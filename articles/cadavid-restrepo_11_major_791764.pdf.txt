Abstract
Background: Pathogens depend on peptidase activities to accomplish many physiological processes, including
interaction with their hosts, highlighting parasitic peptidases as potential drug targets. In this study, a major leucyl
aminopeptidolytic activity was identified in Trypanosoma cruzi, the aetiological agent of Chagas disease.
Results: The enzyme was isolated from epimastigote forms of the parasite by a two-step chromatographic
procedure and associated with a single 330-kDa homohexameric protein as determined by sedimentation velocity
and light scattering experiments. Peptide mass fingerprinting identified the enzyme as the predicted T. cruzi
aminopeptidase EAN97960. Molecular and enzymatic analysis indicated that this leucyl aminopeptidase of T. cruzi
(LAPTc) belongs to the peptidase family M17 or leucyl aminopeptidase family. LAPTc has a strong dependence on
neutral pH, is mesophilic and retains its oligomeric form up to 80°C. Conversely, its recombinant form is
thermophilic and requires alkaline pH.
Conclusions: LAPTc is a 330-kDa homohexameric metalloaminopeptidase expressed by all T. cruzi forms and
mediates the major parasite leucyl aminopeptidolytic activity. Since biosynthetic pathways for essential amino
acids, including leucine, are lacking in T. cruzi, LAPTc could have a function in nutritional supply.

Background
The kinetoplastid protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi is the
aetiological agent of Chagas disease, a debilitating
chronic infection that is highly prevalent in Latin America and a worldwide concern because of human migration. Its complex life cycle includes four main distinctive
developmental stages. In the insect vector, blood trypomastigotes transform into dividing epimastigotes that,
after growth, undergo differentiation into the infective
metacyclic trypomastigotes. In the cytoplasm of mammalian cells, metacyclic trypomastigotes transform into
amastigotes that multiply and differentiate into trypomastigotes, which can reach the blood stream upon host
cell disruption [1]. There is no vaccine for prevention of

Chagas disease and the drugs currently employed in
treatment strategies are toxic and ineffective in inhibiting disease progression to the chronic phase, resulting
in thousands of deaths each year. In this context, the
molecular and functional characterization of T. cruzi
targets is necessary for the development of new chemotherapics for Chagas disease [2,3].
Peptidase activities are implicated in many aspects of
the physiology of organisms, as well as in pathogen-host
cell interface and pathogenesis, and are thus considered
good drug targets [4,5]. T. cruzi growth, differentiation,
dissemination through host tissues and infection of
mammalian cells are highly dependent on proteolytic
activities. The genome of T. cruzi contains many genes
homologous to those encoding proteases which are considered virulence factors in other pathogens. However,
only a few of these enzymes have been functionally
characterized to date. Among them, cathepsin L, which
is known as cruzipain, is associated with both T. cruzi

development and infection [6,7]. Oligopeptidase B and
POP Tc80, which are members of the prolyl oligopeptidase family of serine proteases, play important roles
during parasite entry into mammalian cells [8-10]. T.
cruzi differentiation depends on proteasome activity,
while antibodies against surface metalloproteases partially block infection by trypomastigotes [11,12]. Additionally, the cysteine protease cathepsin B, a serine
carboxipeptidase, and, more recently, two cytosolic
metallocarboxypeptidases, a serine oligopeptidase and
two aspartyl proteases have been biochemically characterized [13-17]. In contrast, the study of aminopeptidases has been limited to the detection of such activity
in cell extracts of T. cruzi epimastigotes [18].
Leucyl aminopeptidases (EC 3.4.11.1; LAPs) are metalloaminopeptidases that catalyse the removal of N-terminal amino acid residues, preferentially leucine, from
proteins and peptides. LAPs comprise a diverse set of
enzymes with different biochemical and biophysical
properties, are found in animals, plants and microorganisms, and play important roles in physiological processes, such as the catabolism of endogenous and
exogenous proteins, peptide and protein turnover and
processing, modulation of gene expression, antigen processing and defence [19]. LAPs in the peptidase family
M17 show two unrelated domains, with the active site
in the C-terminal domain. Their activities require two
metal ions, are found to be maximal at neutral/basic
pH, and are sensitive to bestatin and amastatin [20].
Because of their essential functions in the life cycle of
microorganisms such as Plasmodium, Fusobacterium
nucleatum, and the African trypanosome, LAPs are
emerging as novel and promising pathogen targets for
drug design [21-23]. Furthermore, LAPs are considered
potential vaccine candidates, as evidenced by specific
immune protection of sheep and cattle against fascioliasis [24].
The aim of this study was to examine leucyl aminopeptidase activity present in the developmental forms of
T. cruzi. We report the identification, purification and
characterization of the major leucyl aminopeptidolytic
activity mediated by a hexameric 330-kDa leucyl aminopeptidase of T. cruzi (LAPTc), whose assembly does not
depend on interchain disulfide bonds. Its molecular and
enzymatic properties lead us to classify LAPTc as an
archetypal member of the peptidase family M17. Different from its recombinant form that is alkaline and thermophilic, LAPTc purified from epimastigotes is neutral,
mesophilic, and retains its oligomeric structure after losing activity at 80°C. Our data suggest that the enzyme
localizes within vesicles in the cytoplasm of epimastigostes, trypomastigotes and amastigotes of T. cruzi. We
postulate that LAPTc might be a potential target for the
development of new drugs to treat T. cruzi infections.

Results
T. cruzi enzyme extract mediates hydrolysis of the
aminopeptidase substrate Leu-AMC

The sequencing of T. cruzi genome revealed genes coding for putative peptidases that mediate aminopeptidolytic activities http://www.tcruzidb.org/tcruzidb/home-ori.
jsp. To identify such activities in T. cruzi, we prepared
enzyme extract from epimastigoste forms of the parasite
and incubated it with Leu-AMC, N-CBZ-Leu-AMC,
Pro-AMC or Asp-AMC. Under these experimental conditions, only Leu-AMC was hydrolyzed by the enzyme
extract from epimastigotes, with a calculated specific
enzymatic activity of 45.86 ± 3.75 mU/mg of protein.
The values of specific enzymatic activity obtained with
enzyme extracts prepared from trypomastigotes and
amastigotes were 30.56 ± 3.00 and 56.46 ± 4.62 mU/mg
of protein, respectively. These results may suggest that
this enzymatic activity is differentially regulated in the
parasitic forms. Since the enzyme extract failed to
hydrolyze N-CBZ-Leu-AMC (the blocked version of
Leu-AMC), the hydrolysis of Leu-AMC may be
mediated by a leucyl aminopeptidase. The molecular
mass of the enzyme displaying such activity was estimated by gel enzymography. For this assay, the proteins
present in the enzyme extract were separated by SDSPAGE, followed by gel washing for enzymatic activity
recovery and incubation in reaction buffer containing
Leu-AMC. A single fluorescent band just above 200 kDa
molecular mass was revealed which corresponded to
free AMC released upon hydrolysis of the substrate (Figure 1A, lane 1). The enzymatic activity on Leu-AMC
was observed to co-localize with a protein band upon
staining of the same gel (Figure 1A, lane 2).
Leucyl aminopeptidase is assembled into a homooligomer

The enzyme mediating hydrolysis of Leu-AMC was purified to homogeneity from freshly prepared enzyme
extract by a combination of ion exchange and size
exclusion chromatography with final yield and purification factor of 65 and 42%, respectively. The leucyl aminopeptidase activity was eluted from a DEAE-Sepharose
column from 0.54 to 0.63 M NaCl as a single peak of
activity. The active fractions were further purified on a
Superose-6 HR column; again a single 300-kDa peak of
enzymatic activity was observed (results not shown),
which indicates that, under the conditions of this experiment, only one peptidase in the enzyme extract prepared from T. cruzi epimastigotes displays hydrolysis of
Leu-AMC. The lack of hydrolysis of fluorogenic protease substrates such as Pro-AMC, Asp-AMC, N-CBZLeu-AMC, Gly-Phe-AMC, Gly-Arg-AMC, and Gly-ProAMC, as well as the protein substrates bovine serum
albumin, immunoglobulin G and gelatin (not shown)

a single 55-kDa protein band was revealed upon staining
of the gel (lane 5). These data indicate that this active
leucyl aminopeptidase is assembled into a homo-oligomer formed by monomers of about 55 kDa. We could
not assess whether the monomer mediates enzymatic
activity because it was only obtained upon boiling the oligomeric aminopeptidase.
To investigate the involvement of inter-monomer disulfide bonds in the stabilization of the aminopeptidase’s
oligomeric state, purified protein, previously boiled or
not, was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing or
nonreducing conditions (Figure 1A, lanes 4 and 5 versus
lanes 6 and 7, respectively). The presence of a reducing
agent did not change the electrophoretic migration pattern of the purified aminopeptidase (lanes 1-5). In contrast, high temperature induced monomerization of the
protein oligomeric form; the active oligomer was only
seen in the gels where the samples had not been previously heated to 100°C (lanes 1-4 and 6), while its 55kDa monomer was revealed upon sample boiling (lanes
5 and 7). Since monomerization of the endogenous aminopeptidase occurs regardless of the presence of reducing conditions, we conclude that inter-monomer
disulfide bonds do not take part in the assembly of the
active oligomer.
Figure 1 Leucyl aminopeptidase behaves as an approximately
200-kDa homo-oligomer under electrophoresis and lacks
interchain disulfide bonds. (A), gel zymographic experiments of
total proteins of T. cruzi show a leucyl aminopeptidolytic activity
upon Leu-AMC under UV light (lane 1). The same gel was
Coomassie-stained (lane 2). Two purification steps of native LAPTc:
DEAE-Sepharose column fraction (lane 3), Superose-6 column
fraction without (lane 4) or with (lane 5) previous boiling, and under
reducing (lanes 4 and 5) or nonreducing (lanes 6 and 7) conditions.
(B), western blot analysis of LAPTc after 8% SDS-PAGE of
epimastigote total proteins with (lanes 1 and 3) or without (lane 2)
previous boiling, showing both oligomeric (arrow) and monomeric
(arrowhead) forms of the enzyme. (C), purified rLAPTc was subjected
to 8% SDS-PAGE zymography without previous boiling of the
sample (lane 1). The same gel was subsequently stained with
Coomassie Blue (lane 2). The recombinant enzyme was also
subjected to PAGE in the presence of 0.1 (lane 3) or 0.01% SDS
(lane 4). Arrow and arrowhead indicate oligomeric and monomeric
forms of the enzyme, respectively.

suggests that the purified aminopeptidase displays narrow-spectrum activity.
The electrophoretic profiles of enzymatic active fractions on Leu-AMC obtained at each purification step are
shown in Figure 1A (lanes 3 and 4). A single Coomassiestained band of approximately 200 kDa is seen after 8%
SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions without previous
boiling of the sample, which indicates that the aminopeptidase was obtained with high purity. However, when the
purified enzyme was heated to 100°C for 5 min prior to
electrophoretic analysis under reducing conditions, only

Mass spectrometry identification of the purified
aminopeptidase

The molecular identity of the aminopeptidase with specificity for Leu-AMC was assessed by peptide mass fingerprinting. For this experiment, the purified native enzyme
was digested with trypsin and the resulting peptides were
subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis. Mass values of the
detected peptides were compared to those theoretically
deduced from sequences deposited in the database. Ten
peptides showed mass matches to peptides obtained from
theoretical digestion of the predicted leucyl aminopeptidase of T. cruzi EAN97960 (Table 1), which is encoded by
gene ID Tc00.1047053508799.240 http://www.tcruzidb.
org/tcruzidb/home-ori.jsp. This leucyl aminopeptidase
gene (laptc) encodes for a 520-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 55,891 Da, and whose
sequence does not comprise a predicted peptide signal.
These observations correlate well with our experimental
data showing that the purified enzyme displays leucyl aminopeptidase activity.
According to sequence homology, this leucyl aminopeptidase of T. cruzi (LAPTc) belongs to the metallopeptidase M17 family, also known as the leucyl
aminopeptidase family [25]. It shares 34 to 66% identity
to other members of the M17 family, including assigned
and unassigned leucyl aminopeptidases of kinetoplastidae parasites. Multiple amino acid sequence alignments
(Figure 2A) also revealed that the C-terminal portion is

Masses are MH monoisotopic, with accuracy up to 0.2 Da. The enzyme was digested with trypsin, and masses of resulting peptides were determined by
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and compared to theoretical ones produced by in silico digestion of proteins found in the database (NCBInr). An oxidation of

the most conserved region in this family, reaching 72%
identity and 83% similarity between T. cruzi and T. brucei. The sequence of LAPTc comprises the highly conserved active site (Lys 299 and Arg 373 ), metal binding
residues (Lys287, Asp292, Asp310, Asp369 and Glu371) and
the signature NTDAEGRL sequence of the M17 family
[26]. The phylogenetic tree shows divergent groups of
proteins that cluster by phylum or class (Figure 2B). It
is interesting to note that bacteria, mammalia, viridiplantae and apicomplexa have an indication of a common ancestor with a strong bootstrap support.
Kinetoplastid sequences are divided in two defined
clades, again with very strong bootstrap support. One
group of kinetoplastids comprises sequences annotated
as aminopeptidases and the other group contains
sequences assigned as leucyl aminopeptidases. Although
these two clades are members of the M17 family, their
sequence divergence indicates that the ancestral trypanosomatid giving origin to both Leishmania and Trypanosoma already contained these two enzymes.
LAPTc assembles into a hexamer

The recombinant active and soluble form of LAPTc was
produced in E. coli containing a His-tag at its N-terminus. It was purified by affinity chromatography on a
nickel column upon elution with 200 mM imidazol and
then submitted to size exclusion chromatography. The
activity co-migrates with the main protein peak of 320
kDa (not shown) that was submitted to SDS-PAGE analysis. In-gel enzymography of the gel showed that only a
220-kDa protein band mediates enzymatic activity on
Leu-AMC when PAGE was carried out without previous
heating of the sample and in the presence of 0.1% SDS
(Figure 1C, lane 1). Protein bands of about 220 and 55
kDa were revealed upon staining of the same gel (Figure
1C, lane 2). Under the same experimental conditions,

sample boiling resulted in complete monomerization of
rLAPTc (Figure 1C, lane 3). Unlike its endogenous form
that conserves an oligomeric structure in the presence
of 0.1% SDS (Figure 1A), rLAPTc is very sensitive to
this detergent and is only entirely seen as an oligomer
in the presence of SDS as low as 0.01% (Figure 1C, lane
4). These data show that, regardless of their sensitivity
to SDS, both endogenous and recombinant forms of
LAPTc behave the same when submitted to PAGE and
size exclusion chromatography.
To solve the divergence in its molecular mass determination, we further submitted affinity chromatography
purified rLAPTc to SEC-MALLS and to analytical ultracentrifugation analysis. MALLS measurements allow the
molecular mass of macromolecules in solution to be calculated, taking into account the absolute concentrations
obtained with a differential refraction index detector. The
elution profile showed the presence of five resolved peaks
corresponding to different oligomeric species eluting at
6.5, 8.5, 9, 10 and 11.2 ml (Figure 3A, continuous line).
The main protein peak was eluted at 10 ml and represents 45% of the mass recovery. As expected, light scattering measurements (Figure 3A, dotted line) exhibited
higher signal for the larger species eluting first, given that
light scattering is directly related to the concentration
and molecular mass of the observed objects. Molecular
mass calculations (Figure 3A, discontinuous line) revealed
that the first protein peak (6.5 ml) corresponds to highly
aggregated species with molecular masses above 10,000
kDa. The peaks eluting at 8.5, 9, 10 and 11.2 ml correspond to oligomers of 1025, 625, 314 and 176 kDa,
respectively. In conclusion, SEC-MALLS experiments
showed that rLAPTc is predominantly assembled into a
314-kDa oligomer, but other minor species, not detectable during the purification procedure of the endogenous
enzyme, also co-exist (Table 2).

analysis of the program SEDFIT. (C), corresponding c(s) distribution
in the range 1-45 S.

The hexameric form of LAPTc was confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), a versatile and powerful tool for the identification of oligomeric states and
the determination of protein molecular masses [27]. Figure 3B shows the experimental and fitted sedimentation
velocity profiles obtained at 56 μM by monitoring the
absorbance at 295 nm. The derived sedimentation coefficient distribution (Figure 3C) exhibits four main species sedimenting at 5.1, 10.2, 15.3 and 19.5 S (s20,w =
7.0, 13.9, 20.9 and 26.6 S, respectively). The s-value
depends on the molar mass, M, and Stokes radius, RS,
of the particle, according to the Svedberg equation:
¯
s = M(1 − ρ v)/(NA 6π ηRS ). To calculate the corresponding molecular masses, calibrated size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed with the same samples,
giving Stokes radii for the two main species eluting at 9
and 10 ml of 6.8 and 5.7 nm, respectively. The combination of the s-values of 15.3 and 10.2 S with RS = 6.8 and
5.7 nm (SEC-AUC method) gives the estimates for the
species of M = 593 and 330 kDa, respectively (Table 2),
confirming the results obtained by SEC-MALLS. Considering the monomer molecular mass deduced from
the sequence, 58.7 kDa, the calculated number of subunits present in the main species eluting at 10 ml is 5.6,
suggesting a pentamer or, more likely, a hexamer. Taking into account 5 or 6 as the number of subunits, the
inferred RS values from the Svedberg equation are 5.1
and 6.1 nm, which correspond to frictional ratios of
1.16 and 1.31, respectively. These are within the values
expected for globular proteins. However, the frictional
ratio obtained for the pentamer hypothesis is somewhat
low for a 330-kDa protein. Thus, these data indicate
that the main rLAPTc species is a hexamer. The sedimentation distributions of rLAPTc at 170, 56 and 10
μM present the same main features. However, the ratio
of hexamer to trimer decreases when the concentration
of the enzyme goes from 56 to 10 μM. In addition, at
concentrations as high as 170 μM the amount of large
aggregates increases significantly. Our data thus show a
complex equilibrium among different multimers
depending on enzyme concentration.

Figure 4 Optimal temperature for activity versus eletrophoretic
migration pattern of LAPTc. (A), both native (solid squares) and
recombinant (open circles) purified enzymes were incubated with
Leu-AMC in reaction buffer at different temperatures for 15 min and
the AMC released was measured as described in Experimental
Procedures. Standard deviations were less than 10%. LAPTc (B) or
rLAPTc (C) was incubated at 20 (lanes 1), 37 (lanes 2), 50 (lanes 3),
60 (lanes 4), 70 (lanes 5) 80 (lanes 6) or 100°C (lanes 7) for 10 min in
reaction buffer, followed by 8% SDS-PAGE analysis. Oligomeric
(arrow) and monomeric (arrowhead) forms of the enzymes are
indicated. Gels were Coomassie-stained.

Recombinant and native forms of LAPTc display distinct
activity features

The influence of pH on the activity of purified LAPTc
and rLAPTc was determined. Maximal specific activity
for the native enzyme was measured at pH 7.0 (data not
shown). At pHs 6.0 and 8.0 the recorded specific activities were 45% of that measured at pH 7.0, whereas at

pHs 5.0 and 9.0 the enzyme was shown to be inactive.
Conversely, for rLAPTc the optimal pH is 8.0; at pH 7.5
and 9.0 the enzyme loses 60 and 75%, respectively, of its
activity recorded at pH 8.0. These data demonstrate that
LAPTc has a strong dependence on neutral pH, whereas
its recombinant form displays maximal activity at pH
8.0. The optimum temperature for LAPTc activity on
Leu-AMC was shown to be 37°C. Nevertheless, the
enzyme retained 85% of its activity over a broad temperature range 30-50°C), suggesting stability and absence
of regulation depending on the T. cruzi host (Figure
4A). In contrast, rLAPTc exhibits a distinct activity profile at different temperatures; specific activity measured
at 37°C corresponded to only 25% of the recorded maximal activity observed at 60°C (Figure 4A). These data
indicate that the native enzyme is mesophilic, whereas
its recombinant form produced in E. coli is thermophilic. To study the thermostability of LAPTc, hydrolysis of
Leu-AMC by native and recombinant forms of the
enzyme was assayed at 37 or 60°C, respectively, after
preincubation at different temperatures for either 15 or
240 min (Table 3). Under these experimental conditions,
the enzymatic activity of LAPTc was not significantly
modified after preincubation at 37°C for 240 min. However, preincubation at higher temperatures resulted in
significant loss of enzymatic activity. rLAPTc was shown
to be more stable than its native form, which correlates
well with its higher optimal temperature of activity.
The Michaelis-Menten constant (K m ) and maximal
velocity (Vmax) of LAPTc were determined according to
the hyperbolic regression method. The endogenous
enzyme has a Km value of 12.0 ± 0.8 μM Leu-AMC and
its calculated catalytic constant (kcat) and catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) are 12.47 ± 1.2 S-1 and 1.04 ± 0.09 μM1 -1

rLAPTc are 185.9 ± 17.0 μM, 34.84 ± 2.9 S-1 and 0.19 ±

native and recombinant LAPTc exhibit different kinetic
parameters.

Purified LAPTc and rLAPTc were preincubated for 15 or 240 min at different temperatures, and then their activities on Leu-AMC were measured at 37 or 60°C,
respectively. a Control consisted of enzyme activity test without prior incubation. Standard deviation was less than 11%.

LAPTc retains its oligomeric structure after losing activity

We asked whether the temperature-dependent enzymatic inactivation of LAPTc was due to monomerization of the oligomer. This question was addressed by
incubating LAPTc for 15 min at different temperatures,
followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Although its enzymatic
activity was almost completely lost at 60°C, the peptidase fully retained its oligomeric form upon preincubation up to 80°C (Figure 4B). Complete disassembly of
the oligomer was achieved after boiling the sample,
since LAPTc migrated as a single 55-kDa band in the
gel. These data indicate that LAPTc keeps its oligomeric
form after temperature-induced inactivation. On the
other hand, rLAPTc monomerization as a function of
temperature correlates well with its loss of activity (Figure 4C).
LAPTc is a metalloaminopeptidase

The enzymatic activity of LAPTc on Leu-AMC was
completely inhibited by 100 μM bestatin, while 250 μM
1,10-phenanthroline and 10 mM EDTA inactivated 83
and 45% of the peptidase activity, respectively (Table 4).
LAPTc hydrolytic activity was not sensitive to PMSF,
TLCK, E-64, leupeptin or pepstatin A. The activity of
the enzyme previously inactivated by EDTA or 1,10phenanthroline was potentiated by 0.4 mM Mn2+ or Ca2
+
and restored to 80% of the control by Zn2+ but not by
Fe2+ or Mg2+. In contrast, assay in the presence of Al3+
or Co 2+ resulted in considerable inactivation of the
enzyme (Table 4). Since LAPTc was specifically inhibited by metal chelating agents such as 1,10-phenanthroline, we consider it a member of the metalloprotease
family.
LAPTc is expressed as an oligomer

To assay the expression of LAPTc by T. cruzi, total proteins of epimastigote cells were resolved in SDS-PAGE
with or without previous heating to 100°C, transferred
to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with specific

polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified enzyme
(anti-LAPTc). Under the conditions of this experiment,
anti-LAPTc reacted only with the oligomeric form of
the enzyme where the proteins had not been boiled, and
recognized its monomer upon heating epimastigote proteins. These results show that LAPTc is expressed as an
oligomer by T. cruzi (Figure 1B). Anti-LAPTc antibodies
were employed to determine where the enzyme localizes
in the parasite through an immunofluorescence assay
(Figure 5). Pre-immune serum was used in control
experiments. The spot-like labeling pattern observed
inside parasite cells suggest that LAPTc is located within
vesicles in the cytoplasm of epimastigotes, amastigotes
and trypomastigotes of T. cruzi. However, accurate localization of the enzyme in T. cruzi forms requires additional experiments.

Discussion
T. cruzi whole genome sequencing has revealed 28
genes encoding putative aminopeptidases, amongst
which there are three methionine, two aspartic, two puramycin-sensitive and three leucyl aminopeptidases of the
M17 family. In the present work, we report the identification, purification and biochemical characterization of
a major leucyl aminopeptidase activity of T. cruzi. The
enzyme displaying this activity is the product of the
Tc00.1047053508799.240 gene and was named LAPTc
to designate its activity. Under the conditions examined,
a single activity on Leu-AMC was observed either during the purification procedure or upon enzymography
assay. These results suggest that LAPTc mediates a
major leucyl aminopeptidase activity in T. cruzi epimastigotes. However, the absence of other such activities
could be due to insolubility, low expression levels or
instability of the products. For example, in contrast to
other T. cruzi proteases such as oligopeptidase B and
cathepsin B, the activity of POPTc80 cannot be detected
by enzymographic assay due to irreversible denaturation
[13,28,29]. The absence of detectable hydrolysis of BSA,

gelatin, Pro-AMC and Asp-AMC substrates suggests
that the activity of LAPTc is restrictive, which is in
agreement with the specificities of M17 family members
that are associated with degradation and processing of
peptides and proteins by removing specific N-terminal
amino acidic residues [30]. The differentiated expression
of LAPTc activity by T. cruzi forms might be due to
their different requirements of metabolites and processing of peptides and proteins. Epimastigotes live in axenic cultures, trypomastigotes are infective and found
mainly in the blood and amastigotes divide inside mammalian host cells.
Aminopeptidases are widely distributed in animals,
plants and microorganisms, and found in the extracellular millieu, in the cytoplasm, in many subcellular organelles, and as components of membranes [19]. These
enzymes are either monomeric or multimeric, comprising one, two, four or six subunits. Although members of
the M17 family have been mainly described as multimeric, some of them behave as monomeric. For example, recombinant LAPs of Leishmania spp. and P.
falciparum exhibit a homohexameric structure, while
those of Haemaphysalis longicornis, Schistosoma monsoni and Schistosoma japonicum seem to be monomeric
enzymes [21,31-33]. In contrast, LAPTc displays an electrophoretic migration pattern corresponding to a homotetramer. However, it must be taken into account that

Page 9 of 14

some proteins display abnormal migration both in SDSPAGE and size exclusion chromatography [34], and
assembly of recombinant proteins might differ from that
of their native forms. In addition, LAPTc three-dimensional structure may contribute to its fast migration
since it was not heated before PAGE. Oligopeptidase B
of T. cruzi also displays abnormal electrophoretic migration under the same experimental conditions [35].
Nevertheless, other enzymes such as T. cruzi cathepsin
B and the hexameric leucyl aminopeptidase of Borrelia
burgdorferi (TAP Bb ) show the expected migration
[13,36]. The hexameric nature of LAPTc was thus confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation and MALLS
assays, which are accurate techniques to determine
molecular masses of macromolecules in the absence of
any interaction with matrices or surfaces. As it has been
observed for members of the M17 and M29 families,
such as leucyl aminopeptidase of bovine lens, aminopeptidase A of E. coli, and TAPBb [36-38], the oligomeric
assembly of LAPTc does not require the presence of
interchain disulfide bonds because monomerization
occurs in the absence of a reducing agent. The oligomeric structures of these enzymes may be maintained
through hydrogen bridges, Van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions as is observed for bovine lens aminopeptidase [26]. The advantage of multimeric over
monomeric structures is still unclear, but it is possible
that a quaternary structure allows not only hydrophobic
regions to be hidden within the protein assembly but
also the reduction of the macromolecule surface in contact with the medium, thus restraining the amount of
water required to stabilize these proteins [39]. The association between enzymatic activity and multimeric structure of leucyl aminopeptidases suggests that either the
active sites are formed at the subunit junctions or the
three dimensional assembly stabilizes the active site of
each monomer. The latter hypothesis is supported by
the fact that the activity of bovine lens leucyl aminopeptidase depends on the stabilization of each monomer
active site by the structure of the oligomer [26].
LAPTc comprises several distinctive characteristics of
M17 leucyl aminopeptidases. In addition to conserved
amino acid sequences, especially at the C-terminus,
which contains two M17 Pfam domains, it also lacks the
HEXXH signature found in the M1 family. Amino acid
sequences deduced from cDNAs from many genomes
have revealed amino acid sequence homologies in
organisms as diverse as bacteria and mammals, particularly around residues involved in catalysis and metal ion
binding [19]. As expected, LAPTc shows the highest
identity with the M17 leucyl aminopeptidases of the
kinetoplastids L. major and T. brucei, and less extensively with the unassigned aminopeptidase II of T. cruzi.
Despite conservation of amino acid sequences, M17

Cadavid-Restrepo et al. BMC Biochemistry 2011, 12:46
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/12/46

members show variable pH and temperature optima.
Although LAPTc is active over a broad range of temperatures, its activity shows a marked dependence on
neutral pH, since at pH 6 and 8 the enzymatic activity
is only 45% of that measured at pH 7. Furthermore, the
enzyme is completely inactive at pH 5 and 9. It should
be taken into account that an enzyme may mediate its
activity over a broad pH range, depending on the substrate. Recombinant forms of Leishmania spp. LAPs
show optimal activity at pH 8.0-8.5 on Leu-AMC and
have zinc as a cofactor but its 62-kDa monomer does
not mediate enzyme activity [31].
The distinguishable features between the two forms of
the enzyme might be explained by folding differences,
given that rLAPTc was produced in E. coli and LAPTc
isolated from T. cruzi. The higher sensitivity of rLAPTc
to SDS is in agreement with this hypothesis. This correlates well with observations that recombinant members
of M17 assemble into active oligomers at 60-70°C and
alkaline pHs [19]. Temperatures above 70°C, however,
promote inactivation of the thermophilic TAP Bb , a
member of the M29 family of metallopeptidases,
through a transition from the hexameric to the monomeric state [36]. Since the active form of both endogenous enzymes lack interchain disulfide bonds, the
oligomeric state of LAPTc is even more resistant to
high temperatures than that of TAP Bb . However, the
three-dimensional structure of LAPTc seems to unfold
at 60°C, the optimal activity temperature of TAPBb. In
spite of displaying leucyl aminopeptidase activity,
sequence identity among members of M29 and M17
families is almost absent. Resolution of three-dimensional structures of M29 peptidases may lead to a better
understanding of the evolution and activity mechanism
of the leucyl aminopeptidase superfamily members.
Members of M17 aminopeptidases have a broad range
of functional properties beyond the degradation of peptides. In animals, plants and bacteria, these enzymes have
been implicated in many physiological processes such as
protein turnover, regulation of cell redox status, cataract
development, MHC I-dependent antigen processing and
presentation to cytotoxic T cells, nutritional supply, transcriptional regulation, protein and peptide maturation
and defense [19,40]. A P. falciparum M17 peptidase is
involved in amino acid uptake and regulation and, thus,
is considered a virulence factor [21]. Arphamenine-A, an
aminopeptidase inhibitor, restrains in vitro growth of T.
brucei, a close relative of T. cruzi [23]. In this study, we
show that LAPTc mediates the major leucyl aminopeptidase activity in T. cruzi extracts and, thus, it likely has
important functions in physiological processes involving
protein and peptide processing, degradation of proteins
and amino acid recycling. T. cruzi, Leishmania spp. and
T. brucei lack the biosynthetic pathways to synthesize the

Page 10 of 14

essential amino acids of humans, including leucine [41].
In spite of the metabolic relevance of amino acids for
these parasites, their transport and recycling are poorly
known. Although many putative amino acid transporter
genes have been identified in silico, only arginine and
proline transporters have been biochemically characterized in T. cruzi [42-44]. Considering that a biosynthetic
pathway is missing, T. cruzi must acquire leucine through
specific transport and/or recycling. Since amastigotes live
and divide within host cells where the concentration of
free amino acids is low, leucine aminopeptidases would
play a major role in leucine supply to the parasite
through hydrolysis of exogenous and endogenous proteins and peptides. Inactivation of LAPTc activity by specific inhibitors or through gene disruption may help
reveal its functional properties and thus its importance to
the host-T. cruzi interface.

Conclusions
LAPTc is a 330-kDa homohexameric enzyme that mediates the major leucyl aminopeptidase activity in T.
cruzi. Inter-monomer disulfide bonds do not take part
in the assembly of the active oligomer. LAPTc is a
member of the metallopeptidase M17 family or leucyl
aminopeptidase family. It retains its oligomeric structure
after losing activity and is expressed by all T. cruzi
forms.
Methods
Parasites and preparation of enzyme extract

T. cruzi epimastigote, amastigote and trypomastigote
forms from Berenice stock were cultured and purified as
described previously [10]. Cell-free extracts were prepared from 100 ml of epimastigote culture (5 × 10 7
cells/ml) in the log phase. Parasites were harvested by
centrifugation (5,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C) and washed
four times in PBS. Cells were resuspended in 1.0 ml of
Milli-Q water in the presence of 10 μM of the protease
inhibitors trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E-64; Sigma-Aldrich) and tosyl-lysylchloromethane (TLCK; Sigma-Aldrich) and disrupted by three
cycles of freezing at -20°C and thawing. The insoluble
material was removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g for
20 min at 4°C) and the supernatant, referred to hereafter
as enzyme extract, was immediately used for the assays
or stored at -80°C. Protein content was determined by
the Bradford method.
Assay of peptidase activity

T. cruzi aminopeptidase activity was assayed on the
fluorogenic substrates L-Leu-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin
(Leu-AMC), N-carbobenzoxy-Leu-AMC (N-Cbz-LeuAMC), L-Pro-AMC (Pro-AMC) and Asp-AMC, which
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Enzyme activity

Cadavid-Restrepo et al. BMC Biochemistry 2011, 12:46
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/12/46

was determined by measuring the fluorescence of AMC
released by hydrolysis of the substrates as described previously [28]. Assays were performed by incubating 1.0 μl
of enzyme extract (2.5 μg of protein) or 30 ng of purified LAPTc, as specified, for 15 min at the desired temperature in 100 μl final volume of reaction buffer (25
mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) in the presence of 20 μM fluorogenic substrate. Enzymatic activity is expressed in mU/
mg, where 1 U represents 1 mmol of released AMC/
min. In-gel leucyl aminopeptidase activity of either
enzyme extract (5 μg) or purified LAPTc (0.1 μg) was
performed on 8% SDS-PAGE essentially as described
previously [29]. Samples were solubilized in Laemmli
buffer containing 0.1 or 0.01% SDS and subjected to
electrophoresis at 4°C under non-reducing conditions
without prior heating to 100°C. Next, the gel was
washed 4 times in reaction buffer, 20 min each time,
and incubated at 37°C for up to 30 min in the presence
of 50 μM Leu-AMC. To determine kinetic parameters,
purified LAPTc was incubated in reaction buffer with
variable Leu-AMC concentrations (1 to 100 μM) and
the enzyme reaction was carried out as described above.
Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the rate
data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. kcat was calculated by the equation kcat = Vmax/[E]0, where [E]0 represents the active enzyme concentration.

conditions without previous boiling, and the gel silverstained. The presence of interchain disulfide bonds, the
molecular mass and the oligomeric structure of the
enzyme were evaluated by electrophoresis as described
previously [36].
Identification of T. cruzi aminopeptidase by peptide mass
fingerprinting

The purified native protein (2 μg) was digested with
trypsin (Promega, Madson, Wis) at 37°C for 12 h for
peptide mass fingerprinting as described [45]. The
digested sample was applied to a MALDI-TOF Reflex
mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). Experimentally
measured peptide molecular masses were subjected to a
protein identity search against the nonredundant database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) via BioTool 2.0 (Bruker Daltonics) and the
Mascot program http://www.matrixscience.com. The following parameters were used for database searches:
monoisotopic mass accuracy up to 0.2 Da for internally
calibrated spectra; up to one missed cleavage site; carbamidomethylation of cysteine as fixed chemical modification; and oxidation of methionine as variable chemical
modification. The protein was identified as a leucyl aminopeptidase (LAP; accession number EAN97960).
Phylogenetic relationship of LAPTc with other LAPs

LAPTc purification and electrophoretic analysis

T. cruzi peptidase with specificity for Leu-AMC was
purified from freshly prepared enzyme extract by fast
liquid chromatography. Enzyme extract (1 ml; 5.6 mg of
protein) was buffered with 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane and applied to a
DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (Sigma-Aldrich) column (5 cm
× 1 cm), previously equilibrated with 25 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.5. After washing the column, bound proteins were
eluted with a linear gradient performed in the same buffer from 0.3 to 0.65 M NaCl for 30 min, and then from
0.66 to 1.0 M NaCl for 10 min at a 0.5 ml/min flow
rate. Fractions of 0.25 ml were collected on ice, and an
aliquot of each fraction was assayed with Leu-AMC.
Enzymatically active fractions were pooled and concentrated to 250 μl with a Centricon 100 (Amicon) at 4°C.
The solution was then submitted to size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (GE
Healthcare) isocratically perfused with 25 mM Tris-HCl,
150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, at a 0.3 ml/min flow rate for 80
min, and calibrated with bovine serum albumin (67
kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), ferritin
(440 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa). Each 250- μl
fraction was instantly stored on ice until enzyme activity
assay, and the active ones were pooled and concentrated
to 100 μl as above. Then, 30 ng of the purified protein
were subjected to 8% SDS/PAGE under non-reducing

Cloning and expression of the recombinant enzyme
(rLAPTc)

According to the sequence of the gene encoding LAPTc
(gene ID Tc00.1047053508799.240; http://www.tcruzidb.
org/tcruzidb/home-ori.jsp), specific primers (forward
primer 5’ -CTAGTGACATATGAACAGACCTCCTGCTACA - 3’, NdeI site in bold, and reverse primer 5’ TAGTGACTCGAGTTATCGTAAATTACGAAGATATTCC - 3’, XhoI in bold) were designed and used to
amplify the laptc open reading frame from T. cruzi
genomic DNA. The PCR product was cloned into the
pCR2.1-TOPO vector. The clone was digested with
NdeI and XhoI and the 1563 bp full-length fragment
was cloned into the pET-19b expression vector (Novagen). Gene cloning was confirmed by DNA sequencing.
The N-terminal His-tagged rLAPTc was produced in E.
coli BL21(DE3) through 1.0 mM IPTG induction at 20°
C over 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation,
resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM
NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 0.2% lysozyme, pH 7.9), submitted to sonication on ice and centrifuged at 15,000 ×
g for 10 min at 4°C. Then, the supernatant was submitted to affinity chromatography on a nickel column
and rLAPTc was eluted with 400 mM imidazole and
further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a
Superose 6 HR 10/30 column as described above.
rLAPTc, the main peak of activity obtained after the last
purification step, was used for enzymatic assays and
analyzed by 8% PAGE in the presence of 0.1 or 0.01%
SDS, followed by Coomassie staining of the gel.
Molecular organization assay: analytical
ultracentrifugation and light scattering

Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed
using a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge and an
AN-60 TI rotor (Beckman Coulter). Experiments were
carried out at 10°C for rLAPTc, obtained after affinity
chromatography, at 170, 56 and 10 μM in 25 mM Tris
pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, corresponding to absorbancies at
280 nm of 3.5, 1.2 and 0.2, respectively. A volume of
110 μl (for the most concentrated sample) or 420 μl was
loaded into 0.3 or 1.2 cm path cells and centrifuged at
42,000 rpm. Scans were recorded every 6 min, overnight, at 295 and 285 nm and by interference. We used
the Sednterp software (free available at http://www.
jphilo.mailway.com) to estimate the partial specific
volume of the polypeptide chain, v, the solvent density,
¯
r = 1.00667 g/ml, and the solvent viscosity, h = 1.335
mPa.s, at 10°C. Sedimentation profiles were analyzed by
the size-distribution analysis of Sedfit (freely available at
http://www.analyticalultracentrifugation.com). In Sedfit,
finite element solutions of the Lamm equation for a
large number of discrete, independent species, for which
a relationship between mass, sedimentation and

Page 12 of 14

diffusion coefficients, s and D, is assumed, are combined
with a maximum entropy regularization to represent a
continuous size-distribution [48]. We used typically 200
generated data sets, calculated on a grid of 300 radial
points and using fitted frictional ratio for sedimentation
coefficients comprised between 1 and 50 S. For the regularization procedure a confidence level of 0.68 was
used.
The molecular mass of LAPTc in solution was also
determined by size exclusion chromatography coupled
to multiangle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS) and
refractometry (RI). rLAPTc (20 μl), purified by affinity
chromatography as above, at 170 μM (10 mg/ml) in 25
mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, was injected in a
KW 804 column preceded by a guard column (Shodex),
equilibrated in the same solvent, at 20°C with a flow
rate of 0.5 ml/min. Protein concentration was measured
on-line by refractive index (RI) measurements using an
Optilab rEX (Wyatt Technology) and considering ∂n/∂c
= 0.186 ml/g. On-line MALLS detection was performed
with a miniDAWN TREOS detector (Wyatt Technology) using laser emitting at 658 nm. Data were analyzed
and weight-averaged molar masses were calculated using
the ASTRA software (Wyatt Technology Corp.). Elution
profiles (left ordinate axis) were monitored by RI. The
molecular mass distribution (right ordinate axis) was
determined from combined MALLS and RI data.
Assay of optimal pH and temperature for activity and
thermostability of LAPTc

The optimal pH for activity of both endogenous and
recombinant LAPTc was determined as described above
in 50 mM acetic acid-50 mM MES-50 mM Tris-HCl
buffer adjusted to the desired pH. To assay the optimal
temperature for aminopeptidase activity, reactions took
place at 20, 25, 30, 37, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or 100°C in
reaction buffer. Enzyme thermostability was assayed by
incubating the purified proteins at the same temperatures for either 15 or 240 min in reaction buffer before
the aminopeptidase activity assay on Leu-AMC. An 8%
SDS-PAGE analysis of the molecular organization of the
native or recombinant LAPTc followed. PAGE was performed in the presence of 0.1 or 0.01% SDS without
previous boiling of either protein.
Inhibition pattern and cation dependence of LAPTc

Different concentrations of tosyl-lysylchloromethane
(TLCK), bestatin, EDTA, L-trans-epoxysuccinylleucylamido-(4-guanidino) butane (E-64), phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride (PMSF), 1,10-phenanthroline, leupeptin, or
phosphoramidon were incubated with 50 ng of purified
LAPTc in 100 μl reaction buffer for 20 min at room
temperature before the substrate was added. Enzymatic
reactions were monitored as described above. All

inhibitors were from Sigma-Aldrich. To assess the
effects of cations on enzymatic activity, purified LAPTc
was incubated in reaction buffer containing 10 mM
EDTA or 250 μM 1,10-phenanthroline for 30 min at
room temperature. After extensive dialysis against reaction buffer at 4°C, 20 μM Leu-AMC (final concentration) and AlCl3, CaCl2, FeCl2, CoCl2, MgCl2, MnCl2, or
ZnCl2 (final concentration, 0.4 mM) were added to the
reaction system, followed by a 15 min incubation at 37°
C. Hydrolysis of the substrate was measured as
described above. Controls consisted of enzymatic reactions carried out either without EDTA or 1,10-phenanthroline treatments or in the absence of cations.
Analysis of expression and immunocytolocalization of
LAPTc

One 4-month-old female rabbit was immunized with 13
μg of purified LAPTc emulsified in complete Freund’s
adjuvant followed by two biweekly boosters with the
enzyme in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant. Four days after
the last booster, serum was collected and Western blotting monitored the presence of anti-LAPTc specific antibodies. To assay the expression of LAPTc by T. cruzi
epimastigotes, total parasite proteins were subjected to
8% SDS-PAGE with or without previous heating to 100°
C and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The
membrane was blocked by incubation in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk/PBS for 3 h at room temperature. Blots were
incubated in 1% non-fat milk/PBS for 2 h in the presence of either pre-immune or immune serum diluted
to 1:400, followed by extensive washing in PBS. Then,
the membranes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG diluted to 1:2000,
washed in PBS and the immunocomplexes revealed with
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-1-phosphate/Nitro Blue
Tetrazolium (Promega). For immunofluorescence, epimastigotes, amastigotes and trypomastigotes of T. cruzi
were fixed overnight at 4°C with 3.7% formaldehyde, airdried on poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides, permeabilized
with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and incubated with preimmune or anti-LAPTc serum (1:50 in 1% non-fat milk/
PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. After extensive washing in 1% non-fat milk/PBS, cells were incubated with
Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h. This
was followed by washing and staining parasite DNAs
with 5 μg/ml 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5
min. Glass slides were washed, mounted and observed
with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica
Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).
