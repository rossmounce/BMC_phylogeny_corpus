model organism Schmidtea mediterranea

Abstract
Background: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute one of the largest groupings of eukaryotic proteins,
and represent a particularly lucrative set of pharmaceutical targets. They play an important role in eukaryotic signal
transduction and physiology, mediating cellular responses to a diverse range of extracellular stimuli. The phylum
Platyhelminthes is of considerable medical and biological importance, housing major pathogens as well as
established model organisms. The recent availability of genomic data for the human blood fluke Schistosoma
mansoni and the model planarian Schmidtea mediterranea paves the way for the first comprehensive effort to
identify and analyze GPCRs in this important phylum.
Results: Application of a novel transmembrane-oriented approach to receptor mining led to the discovery of 117
S. mansoni GPCRs, representing all of the major families; 105 Rhodopsin, 2 Glutamate, 3 Adhesion, 2 Secretin and 5
Frizzled. Similarly, 418 Rhodopsin, 9 Glutamate, 21 Adhesion, 1 Secretin and 11 Frizzled S. mediterranea receptors were
identified. Among these, we report the identification of novel receptor groupings, including a large and highlydiverged Platyhelminth-specific Rhodopsin subfamily, a planarian-specific Adhesion-like family, and atypical
Glutamate-like receptors. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out following extensive gene curation. Support vector
machines (SVMs) were trained and used for ligand-based classification of full-length Rhodopsin GPCRs,
complementing phylogenetic and homology-based classification.
Conclusions: Genome-wide investigation of GPCRs in two platyhelminth genomes reveals an extensive and
complex receptor signaling repertoire with many unique features. This work provides important sequence and
functional leads for understanding basic flatworm receptor biology, and sheds light on a lucrative set of
anthelmintic drug targets.

Background
The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily
constitutes the most expansive family of membrane proteins in the metazoa. These cell-surface receptors play a
central role in eukaryotic signal transduction, and conform to a structural archetype consisting of a core
domain of seven transmembrane (TM)-spanning ahelices. GPCRs are also established drug targets, acting
as sites of therapeutic intervention for an estimated 3050% of marketed pharmaceuticals [1,2]. This is undoubtedly a function of their extensive involvement in a wide
range of important physiological processes. The diverse

panel of known GPCR ligands includes biogenic amines,
photons, peptides, odorants and classical neurotransmitters [3]. This diversity is mirrored by the significant
degree of primary sequence variation displayed among
GPCRs.
At present, there exists no comprehensive study of
GPCRs for the phylum Platyhelminthes. This important
phylum houses prominent endoparasites, both flukes
and tapeworms, as well as free-living species that serve
as established model organisms in the realm of developmental biology. Lack of sequence data and a reliance on
techniques with a definably narrow expectation of success such as degenerate PCR have contributed to the
very modest number of GPCRs thus far identified or
characterized [4-9] in this phylum. The arrival of EST

repositories [10-12] has only marginally contributed to
this number, perhaps as a consequence of GPCR underrepresentation [13]. The recent availability of Schistosoma mansoni [14] and Schmidtea mediterranea [15]
whole genome sequence data provides basis for the in
silico accumulation and analysis of undiscovered and
potentially novel receptors.
The blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni is the primary
etiological agent of human schistosomiasis, a chronic
and debilitating condition that afflicts a staggering 207
million people in 76 countries [16] and accounts for
280,000 deaths per annum in sub-Saharan Africa alone
[17]. It is calculated that up to 70 million disabilityadjusted life years (DALYs) are lost to schistosomiasis
annually [18]. This figure surpasses the global burden
posed by both malaria and tuberculosis, and is nearly
equivalent to that of HIV/AIDS. At present, this overwhelming disease burden is met with a near exclusive
reliance on treatment with the drug praziquantel. The
threat of drug resistance [19,20] has spurred recognition
of the pressing need for new antischistosomals [21-23].
In this context, as modulators of a diverse range of critical biochemical and physiological pathways, GPCRs hold
great promise as potential targets for disruption of crucial parasite survival and proliferation activities.
The free-living planarian Schmidtea mediterranea is
an important platyhelminth studied extensively for its
regenerative abilities [24,25]. Like other planarians, it is
abundantly seeded with totipotent stem cells with the
ability to migrate and undergo division and differentiation at sites of injury. In addition to its current role as a
powerful model organism for regeneration and stem cell
biology, S. mediterranea presents itself as a potential
parasite drug discovery model [26]. In the case of nematodes, the biology of the free-living model organism
Ceanhorhabditis elegans features prominently in many
anti-parasitic drug discovery efforts [27,28]. Like C. elegans, S. mediterranea is significantly more tractable to
modern genomic approaches compared to the parasitic
members of its phyla. It is relatively easy to maintain
and it is amenable to RNA interference (RNAi) [29].
Genome-wide analysis and comparison of the GPCR
complements of S. mansoni and S. mediterranea is a
major step towards engaging this hypothesis.
The growing number of sequenced genomes has provided a GPCR mining platform for a number of organisms, including Homo sapien [30], Mus musculus [31],
Gallus gallus [32], Rattus rattus [33], Tetraodon nigrovirdis [34], Anopheles gambiae [35], Drosophila melanogaster [36], Ciona intestinalis [37], Branchiostoma
floridae [38], Xenopus tropicalis [39] and Canis familiaris [40]. For these organisms, GPCR sequences have
been accumulated with a range of bioinformatic methods that include homology-based searching (BLAST),

Page 2 of 21

hidden Markov models (HMMs) and motif-driven
queries [41]. The more sophisticated GPCR mining protocols have involved the application of a combination of
such methods and algorithms.
Phylogenetic studies of the GPCRs in a number of
eukaryotic genomes have led to the introduction of the
GRAFS classification system [42,43]. GRAFS outlines
five major protein families thought to represent groupings of receptors with shared evolutionary ancestry present in the Bilateria: Glutamate, Rhodopsin, Adhesion,
Frizzled, and Secretin. In addition to these primary
families, some organisms are known to house groupings
of lineage-specific receptors that constitute distinct
GPCR families. Examples in the phylogenetic vicinity of
the Platyhelminthes include the nematode chemosensory
receptors [44] and insect gustatory receptors [45]. Any
in silico protocol for genome wide GPCR identification
should therefore cast a broad enough net to reveal any
such highly-diverged receptor groupings, while also providing stringency to limit false positives.
Here, we apply an array of sensitive methods towards
the goal of identifying, manually curating and classifying
putative G protein-coupled receptor sequences in two
prominent platyhelminths. Our hypothesis is that organisms in this phylum possess an extensive and complex
complement of GPCRs, including phylum or speciesspecific GPCR groupings. We perform phylogenetic analysis of putative receptors with respect to the GRAFS
classification system and employ a machine-learning
approach for ligand-based classification of full-length
Rhodopsin GPCRs.

Results and Discussion
In this study, we developed a robust transmembranefocused strategy to identify, curate and classify putative
platyhelminth GPCRs. TM-focused profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) were used to mine the predicted
proteomes of S. mansoni and S. mediterranea in order to
identify receptors at the GPCR family plane. Subsequent
rounds of filtering were used to remove false positives,
followed by homology-based searches against the original
genome assemblies. Extensive manual curation of the
final sequence dataset allowed for more refined phylogenetic analysis. Greater classification depth was achieved
with a complementary transmembrane-focused support
vector machine (SVM)-based classifier. An overview of
this bioinformatics protocol is outlined in Figure 1.
Identification of GRAFS family receptors with TM-focused
profile HMMs

Towards the goal of identifying members of the GRAFS
GPCR families in our genomes of interest, we relied primarily on the use of family-specific profile HMMs. This
alignment-rooted method has been successfully applied

Figure 1 Transmembrane domain-focused GPCR sequence mining strategy. (A) Family-specific profile HMMs are built using TM-only
pseudosequences (TOPs) extracted from the GPCRDB [49] sequence repository. The predicted proteomes of both S. mansoni and S. mediterranea
are processed in a manner identical to that of the training sequences and are searched against a set of family-specific profile HMMs. Results are
ranked statistically and sequences meeting a conservatively selected cutoff undergo an automated BLASTp campaign against the NCBI “nr”
database. The output is parsed, and transmembrane proteins exhibiting significant homology to non-GPCR proteins are removed. Redundant
sequences are removed with the BLAT utility. The surviving sequence pool is then manually assessed and curated, followed by homology-based
searches of these sequences against the whole genome assemblies. Adhesion and Secretin GPCR sequences are distinguished from one another
by inspection of their N-terminal ectodomains. Putative full-length Rhodopsin GPCRs, defined by the presence of an intact 7TM domain, are subclassified via SVM. (B) Construction of TOPs is a two-step process involving the prediction of TM boundary coordinates by HMMTOP, followed by
the ordered concatenation of TM domains flanked bi-directionally by 5 amino acids.

in other genomes and has been shown suitable for the
identification and classification of GPCR sequences at
the family level [41,46]. In a departure from previously
described protocols, we chose to focus HMM training
exclusively on the most highly-conserved structural features that extend throughout the GPCR superfamily.
The idea behind this measure was to dampen challenges
posed by the inexact gene structures that underlie the
flatworm predicted proteomes, as well as the sizable
phylogenetic distance of this phylum from organisms
with characterized GPCR complements.
In this framework, receptor transmembrane domains
are convenient markers that can be identified with
greater confidence than other GPCR stretches using
sensitive prediction algorithms such as HMMTOP [47]
and TMHMM [48]. Training sequences were procured
from GPCRDB [49] and processed into what we will
refer to as “transmembrane-only pseudosequences”
(TOPs), representing the ordered concatenation of TM
domains flanked bi-directionally by 5 amino acids (Figure 1b). TM-focused HMMs were constructed for each
of the major GPCR families, as well as for the nematode
chemosensory and insect odorant families. The Adhesion
and Secretin training sets were combined to build a single HMM, given that sequences belonging to these
families are not easily distinguishable beyond the Nterminal ectodomain [13].
The predicted proteomes of S. mansoni and S. meditearranea were first filtered for the removal of globular
proteins. Typical strategies limit investigation to proteins
with 6-8 predicted TM domains, tolerating errors in the
algorithmic prediction of these regions. We significantly
relaxed this filter and broadened the search scope to
include all proteins with 3-15 TM domains. The utility
of this change then was to alert us to partial sequences
or incorrectly predicted gene models that may be reconstructed with manual curation and that otherwise would
have been screened from detection. Family-derived profile HMMs already provide an adequately stringent filter
for distinguishing between GRAFS family receptors and
other transmembrane proteins.
The proteins that survived this filter were processed
into TOPs in the same manner as the training
sequences. These sequences were searched against the
set of profile HMMs, and the resulting hits for each
GPCR family were ranked according to E-value. A primary cut-off was selected at the point where subsequent
hits showed significant homology to other known proteins or GPCRs belonging to other families. This was
accomplished with a BLASTp [50] search of all hits
against the NCBI non-redundant (nr) database (Additional File 1). Sequences that displayed GPCR-related
homology, along with those that returned no significant
BLAST results, were retained. As evidenced later, the

Page 4 of 21

requirement of statistically meaningful GPCR-related
homology introduces an unnecessary selection bias that
can mask the identification of unique receptors.
Application of the Rhodopsin HMM to the S. mansoni
predicted proteome led to the examination of the 400 topranking hits (E-value < 0.007), 77 of which remained after
removal of false positives via homology-based searches.
Similarly, 270 of the 450 top-ranked (E-value < 0.002) Rhodopsin HMM hits remained for S. mediterranea. Redundancy within the S. mediterranea genome assembly
warranted the detection and removal of identical
sequences. BLAT [51] was used to self-align the nucleotide
sequences of the predicted proteins that survived the
HMM filtering process. Redundant sequences were
removed and if a choice was presented, the longest member of a set of identical sequences was retained. This led to
the removal of 14 Rhodopsin sequences from the S. mediterranea dataset. Figure 2 displays the overall transmembrane distribution for both proteomes at these various
stages of processing for the Rhodopsin family. These steps
were likewise performed for the nematode chemosensory
and insect odorant GPCR families, however no flatworm
orthologs were identified. This is not unexpected, considering their lack of conservation among the Ecdysozoa.
Manual editing of gene models

Candidate GPCR sequences underwent manual inspection, and the corresponding gene models were edited
where necessary. This labor-intensive step is crucial in
improving the reliability of any further analysis on this
gene family. Common manual edits included the merging or splitting of gene models, movement of intronexon boundaries, and sequence extension or truncation.
This process was aided by examination of open reading
frames (ORFs) in the vicinity of a gene models. ORFs
that housed common receptor motifs, displayed GPCRrelated homology or contained transmembrane stretches
were typically incorporated. In many cases, sequencing
gaps prevented any meaningful improvement. S. mansoni GRAFS sequences and S. mediterranea GAFS
sequences were curated in this manner. We avoided
genome-wide manual curation of S. mediterranea Rhodopsin sequences in light of the dubious condition of
the draft genome. The A/T rich (69%), highly repetitious
(46%) and heterozygous nature of the genome has complicated automated assembly efforts. However, as we elaborate later, we did construct and edit gene models for
a particular grouping of Rhodopsin-like planarian
GPCRs. The significant level of improvement achieved
by manual gene editing is shown in Figure 3.

gene models used do not provide perfect accounting of

all gene-encoding regions within the assemblies, we
exercised a translated nucleotide BLAST (tBLASTn) and
carried out genome-wide gene prediction using genBlastG [52]. For each receptor family, putative fulllength GPCRs were combined from both species and
used in parallel to query the nucleotide assemblies and
to generate homology-based gene models. tBLASTn hits
with E-value < 0.1 were examined for GPCR-related

homology, and genBlast prediction was carried out with
default settings (E-value < 0.01). In cases where identified regions of homology overlapped with a given gene
model, that gene model was added to the sequence
pool. Conversely, if no gene model was found to be present at a particular genomic location, a simple preliminary gene model was built by connecting the highscoring segment pairs (HSP) that contributed to the hit.

Figure 3 Manual curation and expansion of Schistosoma mansoni GRAFS GPCRs. The transmembrane distributions for the filtered S. mansoni
HMM pool is shown before (top) and after (middle) manual editing of the underlying gene models, as predicted by HMMTOP. The number of GPCRs
with a predicted intact 7TM domain increases from 27 to 41, coupled with a significant contraction of the distribution spread. The mean TM count
shifts from 6.00 to 6.41, which equates to the identification and addition of roughly 42 missing TM domains during the first round of curation.
Homology-bases searches against the genome assembly increased the putative 7TM receptor count to 59 (bottom). Receptors in the 8 and 9 TM bin
can be considered full-length for our purposes, as the erroneously-predicted additional TM domains can be excised for phylogenetic analysis. Inclusion
of these receptors brings the total putative full-length (7TM) receptor tally to 68 (of 117 total sequences).

In keeping with the HMM approach, only putative
receptors with a TM count ≥ 3 were retained. CD-HIT
[53] was used at 90% sequence identity to generate a
non-redundant dataset and to help remove splice variants, polymorphisms and previously identified genes.
This led to a further significant expansion of the total
unique sequence count in both organisms (Table 1).
This reported sequence count is not equivalent to a
receptor count, as many of these sequences may represent fragments of a single protein or prove to be redundant sequences. To bridge this gap and to improve the
general state of this additional sequence data, manual
editing of gene models was again performed. Comparison of our final receptor dataset to GPCRs uncovered in
the recently released Smed454 transcriptome dataset
[54] is encouraging. Of 79 receptors identified, only five
short-length sequences (< 100 bp) were found absent
from our dataset. Fragments of these sequences were
found in the assembly, but were filtered due to their
lengths. With subsequent improvements in the assembly, we could attempt to ‘rescue’ these and similar
sequences.
Overall phylogenetic view

Putative receptor sequences were tentatively divided into
three sequence bins based on the number of predicted
TM domains: full-length, near full-length and partial. Fulllength sequences were those that likely had their entire
7TM domain intact as predicted by HMMTOP with user
oversight. Alignments to homologous proteins were used
to help make a final decision with respect to the potential
algorithmic miscounting of TM domains. Near full-length
sequences are predicted to contain ≥ 4 TM domains,
while all other sequences (< 4 TM domains) were placed
into the partial sequence bin. Phylogenetic analysis was
carried out for full-length and many near full-length
receptors. Figure 4a displays a topological overview of the
primary flatworm GPCR groupings. This phylogenetic
analysis confirms the distinct and analogous presence of

Sequence counts are provided for each GPCR family at different stages in the
receptor mining protocol. The S. mansoni count is shown after application of
the TM-focused HMM and filtering of the predicted proteome (HMM),
extensive manual curation (MC), homology-based searches against the
nucleotide assembly (H) and a final round of manual curation (Final). This
progression is similarly displayed for S. mediterranea, with additional stages
for the shedding of redundant sequences using BLAT (R).

the primary GRAFS families, and further reveals two novel
flatworm GPCR families: Platyhelminth-specific Rhodopsin-like orphan family 1 (PROF1) and Planarian Adhesionlike receptor family 1 (PARF1).
The Rhodopsin family

The Rhodopsin family is divided into four main groups
(a, b, δ, and g) and further subdivided into 13 major
sub-families via analysis of fully sequenced mammalian
genomes [55]. The a and b subfamilies are well-populated in both S. mansoni and S. mediterranea (Figure
4b), while the δ and g subfamilies are absent. Table 2
provides a preliminary classification of receptors identified with respect to the GRAFS classification system
from a comparative perspective.
Alpha (a) receptors

The a subfamily houses amine, opsin-like, and melatonin
receptors. Among these, the amine grouping is typically
largest. This metazoan trend holds true for S. mansoni
and S. mediterranea, each possessing at least 24 and 66
putative aminergic receptors, respectively. These numbers
are greater than those observed among ecdysozoans, and
in the case of S. mediterranea, the figure surpasses even
the human amine GPCR complement. Biogenic amines
such as serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT), dopamine,
and histamine have been shown to play a prominent role
in the flatworm nervous system [56,57]. Although a small
number of aminergic GPCRs have been characterized in
this phylum, the majority of receptors that mediate aminergic signaling have thus far remained elusive. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out on the flatworm amine
GPCR complement with respect to C. elegans aminergic
receptors, as shown in Figure 5. Two diverged flatwormspecific groupings can be outlined, including one that signifies a major paralogous expansion in schistosomes.
Other flatworm receptors are grouped and tentatively
associated with ligands corresponding to their phylogenetic relationships with deorphanized C. elegans GPCRs.
Four melanopsin-like receptors were identified in S.
mansoni. Six melanopsin-like receptors were identified
in S. mediterranea, along with a single receptor that displays moderate homology to various ciliary opsins.
Along with the presence of cyclic nucleotide gated
(CNG) ion channels in the planarian genome, this raises
the possibility of ciliary phototransduction. Another
noteworthy observation is the conspicuous absence of
melatonin-like receptors in S. mansoni, while S. mediterranea houses a relatively large complement of 9 such
receptors. Melatonin is endogenously synthesized in planaria in a circadian manner [58,59], and has been implicated in regeneration [60]. Identification of melatonin
receptors is a requisite for a more complete mapping of
the underlying signal transduction pathway(s) in these
important processes.

complements. Maximum parsimony analysis (bootstrap value = 100) was carried out using putative full-length non-Rhodopsin GPCRs and a
subset of full-length Rhodopsin-like GPCRs. In addition to the phylogenetic clustering of sequences into the primary GRAFS families, this analysis
reveals the presence of two distinct phylum-specific groupings: PROF1 and PARF1. * Sequence family is present in S. mediterranea. ** Sequence
family is present in both S. mansoni and S. mediterranea. (B) Neighbor-joining tree of flatworm Rhodopsin-like GPCRs. To maximize the number of

melatonin, and PROF1 groupings are highlighted. Branches terminating in S. mansoni receptors are shown in green, and branches terminating in
S. mediterranea receptors are shown in blue.

Beta (b) receptors

The b subfamily contains the great majority of peptide
and peptide hormone GPCRs in examined organisms.
Neuropeptidergic signaling is known to play a fundamental role in flatworm locomation, reproduction, feeding, host-finding and regeneration [61,62]. The known
flatworm neuropeptide complement has recently undergone considerable expansion with the application of
bioinformatics and mass spectrometry-based (proteomics) approaches [63,64]. This represents a significant
advance from the original handful of FMRFamide-like
peptides (FLPs) and neuropeptide Fs (NPFs) first identified in the phylum. Many of these newly-identified amidated peptides are planarian or flatworm-specific, while

others exhibit relatedness to peptides in other phyla,
including myomodulin-like, buccalin-like, pyrokinin-like,
neuropeptide FF (NPFF)-like, and gonadotropin (or
thyrotropin) releasing hormone-like peptides.
Our efforts yielded at least 130 and 36 putative peptide
receptors in S. mediterranea and S. mansoni, respectively.
These numbers further evidence the notion that peptidergic signaling is the predominant mode of neurotransmission in the Platyhelminthes. Flatworm peptide receptors
do not cluster into a single phylogenetic group (Figure
4b). It can be noted that the putative flatworm peptide
receptor count greatly outnumbers the set of currently
known peptide ligands. Although this may be explained by
peptide promiscuity and receptor redundancy, it is also

The GPCR repertoires of S. mansoni and S. mediterranea are shown from a GRAFS-based perspective, alongside those of other organisms with characterized GPCR
complements. For Rhodopsin sub-classification, BLAST searches were used to help tentatively assign putative ligands to receptors omitted from phylogenetic
analysis.

very possible that many neuropeptides have yet to be
uncovered. Ligands cannot be confidently assigned to the
majority of identified receptors. While some show moderate homology to characterized FLP and NPF-like receptors, most receptors display weak or insignificant
homology to an assortment of thyrotropin-releasing hormone, capa, sex peptide, growth hormone secretagogue,
proctolin, pyrokinin, myokinin, tachykinin, galanin, and
orexin receptors. These tentative BLAST-based annotations (Additional File 2) may be used with caution to help
guide receptor deorphanization efforts.
Unclassified receptors

A large number of Rhodopsin receptors could not be
individually annotated with confidence, and were placed
in the “Unclassified” Rhodopsin receptor bin. Receptors
in this category lack phylogenetic support to be clustered with known Rhodopsin groupings and lack meaningful homology to receptors with known ligands. Many
receptors in this bin exhibit some weak peptide or
amine receptor-relatedness, but these require functional
validation before they can be added to the a or b subfamily counts. Many of these receptors are likely unique
to the phylum, and therefore obscure the Rhodopsin
family subdivisions apparent in the vertebrate lineage.
Planarian homologs of parasite GPCRs

Given the relative tractability of planarians to experimental manipulation, we identified the nearest

homologs of S. mansoni Rhodopsin receptors in the S.
mediterranea pool (Additional File 3, Table S1). It is a
reasonable expectation that there is significant conservation in the biological and pharmacological properties of
receptors sharing high sequence identity between these
species. The characterization of certain planarian receptors is likely to inform us about the function and druggability of parasite receptors. Each S. mansoni receptor
was first matched to its most similar S. mediterranea
sequelog, and sequence pairs were ranked according to
amino acid percent identity (PID): 6 receptor pairs were
identified sharing > 50% PID, 21 with 40-50% PID, 48
with 30-40% PID, and the remaining sequences with <
20% PID. The top grouping is comprised exclusively of
amine (GAR and 5HT) and peptide GPCRs. Among
them is a receptor pair orthologous to Gt-NPR1 [7], the
only neuropeptide receptor deorphanized in this phylum. This degree of sequence conservation promotes the
use of planaria as a convenient heterologous system to
study parasite receptors.
Platyhelminth-specific Rhodopsin-like orphan family 1
(PROF1)

A large and distinct sequence clade comprised of 19 S.
mansoni and 47 S. mediterranea proteins was identified
and labeled Platyhelminth Rhodopsin Orphan Family 1
(PROF1). Members of this novel and highly-diverged

Figure 5 Aminergic receptors: S. mediterranea and S. mansoni. Neighbor-joining tree (bootstrap value = 500) of putative aminergic GPCRs.
Included in this analysis are 21 (of 24) S. mansoni and 57 (of 66) S. mediterranea full-length and near full-length aminergic receptors, alongside
14 known C. elegans amine receptors. The latter grouping includes receptors that respond to tyramine, octopamine, dopamine, serotonin, and
acetylcholine [97]. Branch lengths are scaled to bootstrap support, branches terminating in Schistosoma receptors are shown in green, and
branches terminating in Schmidtea receptors are shown in blue. Flatworm receptors are outlined (solid lines) and classified by ligand with
respect to their nearest-related C. elegans homologs. Two diverged flatworm-specific receptor groupings are outlined with a dashed line.

phylogenetic grouping are predicted to house a 7TM
domain with an extracellular N-terminus and seem to
be exclusively derived from intronless genes. Most
PROF1 sequences were revealed with homology-based
searches after a small number of bait sequences survived
the Rhodopsin HMM filtering stage. In fact, 38 of the 47
S. mediterranea PROF1-containing ORFs were identified
via homology-based searches, and only one of these
ORFs coincided with an existing gene model. Similarly,

13 of 19 S. mansoni PROF1 were identified in this manner and only four of these were represented in the predicted gene set.
These receptors display remnants of classical Rhodopsin motifs at corresponding positions (Table 3), yet
show no significant overall homology to any previously
discovered GPCRs. It is valuable to point out that the
absolute requirement of GPCR-related BLAST homology as part of the post-HMM filtering stage would have

masked the identification of PROF1 receptors. BLASTp
searches of all PROF1 sequences against the NCBI nr
database (E-value cutoff = 0.1) returned no hits for the
majority of sequences. The small pool of hits that did
result, exhibit both very poor homology and represent
an incongruous range of receptors that include peptide,
lipid and odorant GPCRs. This further highlights the
unique nature of these receptors.
Maximum parsimony analysis led to the subdivision of
PROF1 into three primary phylogenetic groupings with
good bootstrap support (Figure 6). Group I is the largest
among these with 29 and 13 members from S. mediterranea and S. mansoni, respectively. The lack of obvious
one-to-one orthologs between species suggests

PROF1 motifs are compared to ubiquitous Rhodopsin family motifs. Motifs are
displayed as regular expressions. The two most frequently occurring amino
acids are shown for each position in order of frequency, except in cases
where a particular residue is absolutely conserved or when there is no clear
second in frequency rank. Bolded text is used to highlight positional

Figure 6 Phylogenetic analysis of PROF1 GPCRs. Maximum parsimony tree for all identified PROF1 receptors. An alignment block that
included TM domains I-IV was bootstrapped 1000 times for parsimony analysis. PROF1 can be subdivided into 3 families with good bootstrap
support (> 50%; relevant values displayed): I, II and III. Schistosoma sequences are shown in green and Schmidtea sequences are shown in blue.
The tree is rooted with a schistosome opsin-like GPCR (AAF73286.1). Schmidtea PROF1 receptors with transcript expression confirmed by RT-PCR

expansion or contraction of these receptors occurred
after the splitting of planaria and trematodes in the flatworm lineage. Group II includes 6 S. mansoni and 12 S.
mediterranea sequences, while group III houses 6 S.
mediterranea sequences. It is likely that the closest
related receptor to the ancestral gene for this family is
contained in group I or II. A multiple sequence alignment of TM domains I-IV (used for phylogenetic analysis) is shown in Figure 7.
Of additional interest, short PROF1-like sequence
fragments were identified in both genome assemblies
that could not be incorporated into full-length gene
structures. These may constitute pseudogenes, or be
ascribed to errors in assembly. RT-PCR was used to
confirm transcript expression for a selection of putative full-length planarian PROF1 receptors: 8 from
group I, 2 from group II and 3 from group III (highlighted in Figure 6). Correct-sized amplicons were
visualized for all 13 targets. Similarly, we selected a
representative from each schistosome PROF1 grouping
and confirmed transcription in the adult stage. It is
not currently possible to assign functions or putative
ligands for the PROF1 family. However, given that they
constitute one of the largest Rhodopsin-like subfamilies

The Adhesion and Secretin Families

Adhesion and Secretin receptors share sequence similarity in their 7TM domains and are commonly grouped as
Class II GPCRs. The phylogenetic separation of these
families under the GRAFS paradigm is mirrored by
noticeable structural differences in their N-terminal
ectodomains. Archetypal Adhesion GPCRs have a long
N-terminus containing a diverse arrangement of functional domains. In the vertebrate lineage, this family
constitutes the second largest grouping of GPCRs after
Rhodopsin and is further partitioned into eight clusters.
Secretin GPCRs usually display N-terminal hormonebinding domains (HBD) that confer responsivity to peptide hormones and are thought to descend from the
group V Adhesion receptors [65]. Additional Adhesionlike proteins have been identified in various organisms
that stake more dubious evolutionary positions. The
insect Methuselah receptors are one such example that
have become the subject of great investigation, attributable to their role in life-span regulation and stress

resistance [66]. More recently, a cluster of Adhesion-like
receptors (NvX) was identified in the basal cnidarian N.
vectensis which share some homology with Methuselah
receptors [65,67].
We have identified a novel cluster of 12 Schmidtea
GPCRs that show moderate (> 20% PID) homology to
NvX receptors. We denote this cluster Planarian Adhesion-like receptor family 1 (PARF1). Like NvX, PARF1
receptors contain a single Somatomedin B domain,
except in the case of SMDC005966C which is predicted
to contain two. Interestingly, no schistosome PARF1
orthologs were identified. A single Adhesion GPCR in S.
mansoni (SMP099670) was found to house a Somatomedin B domain, but it otherwise shares no significant
homology with planarian PARF1 receptors. Two Adhesion-like Schmidtea GPCRs (SMD002396 and
SMD002965) were identified that most resemble vertebrate group V orphan GPR133. Two Schmidtea GPR157
homologues (SMD002980 and SMD009091) were also
identified via Adhesion/Secretin HMM, however, these
receptors exhibit vague sequence similarity to more than
one GPCR family [33].
Latrophilin-like receptors were found to be present in
both flatworms. S. mediterranea SMD011811 contains a
GPS domain, and can be grouped with sequence fragments SMDC001354A and SMDC001354B. S. mansoni
SMP176830 contains a Somatomedin B domain, but
shares no significant sequence similarity with the identified latrophilin-like planarian receptors. Evidence of the
potential druggability of these particular receptors
comes from the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus, where a latrophilin-like receptor has been identified
as a target of an anthelmintic cyclodepsipeptide [68].
One other Adhesion-like parasite GPCR was identified
(SMP058380) that displays an N-terminal GPS domain,
but with no clear planarian ortholog.
The Secretin flatworm complement is comparatively
smaller. Two S. mansoni and one S. mediterranea Secretin GPCRs were identified. SMP125420 and its planarian
ortholog SMD004009 show high sequence similarity to
diuretic hormone receptors and contain an N-terminal
hormone receptor domain (HRM). These receptors
likely play a role in homeostatic regulation. Schistosoma
SMP170560 exhibits an HRM domain and parathyroid
hormone receptor homology. This receptor is likely to
have a planarian ortholog, but despite the recognition of
a short, nearly identical Schmidtea sequence fragment,
we were unable to identify the rest of the hypothetical
gene within the assembly.
The Glutamate Family

Glutamate GPCRs respond to a wide range of signals,
including glutamate, g-aminobutyric acid (GABA), Ca2+
and odorants. The mammalian complement of

Page 13 of 21

metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) consists of
8 proteins that fall into three groups. They universally
possess a large extracellular domain that contains a
ligand binding domain (LBD). The Drosophila mGluRlike complement consists of two receptors, DmGluRA
and DmXR. DmGluRA shares the structural profile of
mammalian mGluR2 and mGluR3. DmXR constitutes
one member of a larger insect-specific clade, and displays an atypically-diverged LBD that responds to Lcanavanine [69,70]. Outside of the metazoa, a group of
17 Dictyostelium GABA B -like receptors (GrlA-GrlR)
have been forwarded as potential evolutionary precursors to mGluRs [71,72].
We identified 2 S. mansoni and 9 S. mediterranea
Glutamate-like sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of these
sequences was performed with respect to both mammalian and non-mammalian Glutamate receptors (Figure
8). The S. mansoni Glutamate-like receptors both have
corresponding orthologs in the S. mediterranea genome.
GSMP052660 and its ortholog GSMD025402 group
with DmGluRA, and most of the remaining planarian
sequences fall in the phylogenetic vicinity of the major
mGluR groupings. However, GSMP128940 and its
ortholog GSMD001419, along with GSMD004608, seem
to be significantly diverged from both GABA B and
mGluR receptors. In the case of DmXR and Grl receptors, the examination of key LBD residues involved in
glutamate binding led to the eventually validated conclusion that glutamate was not the primary ligand. We perform similar analysis as depicted in Figure 9. Although
the residues of GSMD001419 involved in a-amino and
a-carboxylic groups of glutamate are conserved, the
residues associated with the g-carboxylic group are not.
This runs parallel to the observations made for DmXR.
GSMP128940 displays an even more atypical LBD and
conserves only a single putative glutamate-interacting
residue. We hypothesize that these particular receptors
either bind other amino acid-derived ligands or possess
unusual pharmacological profiles.
The Frizzled Family

Wnt-mediated Frizzled signaling plays a significant regulatory role in a number of crucial developmental processes, including cell fate determination, cell motility,
cell polarity, and synaptic organization [73]. In planaria,
the canonical Wnt/b-catenin pathway is implicated as a
molecular switch for anteroposterior polarity in regeneration [25,74]. We identified four S. mansoni Frizzled
sequences, along with the 10 S. mediterranea sequences
previously identified. A single Smoothened-like sequence
was found for each species.
In humans, 10 Frizzled receptors are phylogenetically
grouped into four clusters: Fzd1/Fzd2/Fzd7 (I), Fzd5/Fzd8
(II), Fzd4/Fzd9/Fzd10 (III), and Fzd3/Fzd6 (IV) [73]. Both

Figure 8 Phylogenetic analysis of Glutamate GPCRs. Maximum parsimony tree of Glutamate family GPCRs. TM domains I-VII were used for
phylogenetic analysis with the alignment bootstrapped 1000 times (bootstrap support values are provided). Schistosoma sequences are shown
in green and Schmidtea sequences are shown in blue. GSMD007320 and GSMD015264 were excluded as they remain incomplete over the
sequence range used. GABAB receptors are highlighted, along with the primary vertebrate mGluR groupings and the more recently discovered
insect Group X receptors. A human Calcium-sensing receptor (AAA86503.1) was used as an outgroup. Putative flatworm GPCRs that are diverged
from both the GABAB and glutamate-responsive receptors are outlined in red. The ligand-binding domains of these receptors are further
analyzed in Figure 9.

flatworm genomes house a single receptor (FSMP118970
and FSMD000018) that groups in cluster IV, sharing
~45% amino acid identity with Drosophila Fzd1 and ~38%
identity with human Fzd6. Four planarian (FSMD023435,
FSMD010098, FSMD017743 and FSMD000054) and two
schistosome (FSMP139180 and FSMP155340) receptors
appear to belong to cluster II. Other flatworm Frizzled
receptors show less clear relationships with their vertebrate counterparts (Additional File 4).
Ligand-based support vector machine (SVM) Rhodopsin
subclassification

Support vector machines (SVM) represent a powerful
supervised-learning method for data classification. Given

a combined set of positively and negatively labeled training instances, an SVM produces a binary classifier that
can then be used to label unknown samples. Each
instance is associated with a fixed-length numerical feature vector, containing certain attributes of the data to
be classified. The SVM identifies a maximum-margin
separating hyperplane to distinguish between vectors
representing instances of opposite sign. More often than
not, training instances are not linearly separable in the
feature space, and feature vectors must first be mapped
to a higher dimensional space. Non-linear classification
is then performed by application of kernel functions
which allow for the construction of a hyperplane in the
transformed feature space. Recently, this approach has

seen extensive use in the area of biosequence discrimination, and relevant to our goals, the particular problem
of GPCR classification.
In the first study on the matter, SVM-based classifiers
were shown to drastically outperform their BLAST and
HMM-based counterparts for level 1 and level 2 GPCR
subclassification [75]. Subsequent studies further
improved the predictive performance of SVMs with the
introduction of dipeptide composition feature vectors
[76,77], achieving accuracies of 97.3% and 96.4% for
level 1 (Rhodopsin) and level 2 (amine) classification,
respectively. Alternative feature vectors have since been
similarly validated [78,79]. Although these computational approaches are touted as among the most sensitive, to the best of our knowledge, they have seen no
utilization in the realm of genome-wide GPCR mining
studies.
Perhaps one reason for this is that even in the case of
publicly available SVM classifiers, training and validation

occurs exclusively with full-length sequence data. More
suitable classifiers would be tailored to the general deficiencies of sequence data resulting from in silico methods, where inexact gene structures are an unavoidable
phenomenon. In this respect, we developed a classifier
to complement our particular GPCR identification
approach. This involved focusing SVM training on
transmembrane domains, as identification of these conserved blocks had been a primary aim of both our
receptor mining and manual curation protocols.
Multi-class SVM

Multi-class SVMs refer to classification problems where
the number of classes, k, is greater than 2. Such problems are typically approached with either the “one-versus-rest” (OvR) or “one-versus-one” (OvO) method. In
the OvR scenario, k binary classifiers are trained, such
that each classifier separates one class from all others.
The “winner-takes-all” strategy is then commonly used
to label unknown samples, whereby the classifier with

Zamanian et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:596
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/596

the highest output decision function assigns the final
k(k − 1)
binary classifiers
class. In the OvO scenario,
2
are constructed in a pair-wise manner. A voting strategy
is then typically employed in classification, whereby
each classifier accounts for one vote and the class with
the maximum number of votes assigns the final label.
Although the OvO method has been shown to perform
better on a number of fronts [80], as far as the authors
are aware, all previously described SVM-based GPCR
classifiers available for online use rely on the simpler
OvR method. We constructed OvO GPCR classifiers for
two levels of Rhodopsin family sub-classification.
Building feature vectors for ligand-based receptor
discrimination

The general fixed-length feature vector, F , contains frequency information for the 202(400) possible dipeptides
over a given stretch of sequence, L amino acids in
length. Dipeptides are counted in both possible frames
and there are therefore L - 1 total amino acid pairs.
F = P1 , P2 , ..., P399 , P400
Pi =

fi
, where fi represents the frequency of dipeptide i
L−1

To better associate an SVM-based classification
approach with our gene-mining strategy, we explored
the idea of again focusing our efforts exclusively on the
transmembrane domains. Two options in the way of
final feature vector construction were pursued: XT1 and
XT1 . XT1 represents the 400-element dipeptide frequency vector taken over the entire length of a TM-only
pseudosequence, while XT7 represents the 2800-element
dipeptide frequency vector generated from the ordered
concatenation of the dipeptide frequency vectors for the
seven individual TM domains. The standard dipeptide
frequency vector calculated for full-length proteins, XFL ,
was used for comparison. We will refer to the corresponding SVM classifiers as SVM T1 , SVM T7 , and
SVMFL.

with 5-fold cross-validation. For each proposed feature
vector construction, the best performing (C,g) pair was
selected in domains C = 2-5, 2-4, ..., 215 and g = 2-15, 214
, ..., 215 and used to train a final classifier (Table 4).
Our original expectation was that SVMT1 would display lower accuracy than SVMFL, given that a smaller
subset of sequence information would be used for training. We hoped that this presumed disparity would be
compensated by SVMT7 with the addition of positionspecific information. Instead, both SVMT1 and SVMT7
registered higher cross-validation accuracies than
SVMFL for Rhodopsin subfamily classification. XT7 was
the best-performing classifier with 99.47% accuracy.
These results led us to conclude that for the Rhodopsin
family, the exclusion of sequence information outside of
the transmembrane bundle improves dipeptide-based
SVM classification. Encouragingly, this is in agreement
with structure and ligand interaction data for the Rhodopsin family [81]. The same procedure was carried out
in constructing classifiers for amine GPCRs. SVMT1 was
the best performing classifier with a cross-validation
accuracy of 96.44%.
SVM classification results

Rhodopsin sequences with seven TM domains as predicted by HMMTOP were classified by the two-tiered
SVM. TOPs were aligned and manually examined to
correct for erroneously predicted TM domains.
Sequences were then subclassified with the Rhodopsin
SVMT7 classifier, and those discerned as amine-responsive were further sub-classified with the amine classifier
SVMT1. A total of 122 S. mediterranea and 58 S. mansoni sequences were classified via Rhodopsin SVM. The
majority of these receptors were identified as peptideresponsive (Additional File 5, Table S2). This grouping
also contains all PROF1 receptors included in this classification stage, perhaps providing some clues as to their

classifiers exclusively employ transmembrane sequence data, and outperform
the classifiers trained with full-length sequence data.

ligands. A subset of 22 S. mediterranea and 19 S. mansoni sequences were identified as amine-responsive, and
classified via amine SVMT1. These classification outputs
are detailed in Table S3 (Additional File 6). These
results can inform receptor deorphanization efforts,
alongside traditional homology-based approaches.

Conclusions
This is the first comprehensive genome-wide study of G
protein-coupled receptors in the phylum Platyhelminthes. Our transmembrane-focused receptor mining
approach yielded a lower-bound estimate of 117 S. mansoni and 460 S. mediterranea GPCRs. Phylogenetic analysis established the presence of the primary metazoan
GRAFS families, along with well-populated a and b
Rhodopsin subfamilies in both examined genomes. The
identification of these receptors complements previous
and ongoing efforts to identify biogenic amine and neuropeptide-like ligands in flatworms, and will help identify specific receptors that mediate important aspects of
flatworm biology associated with the aminergic and peptidergic signaling systems.
The flatworm GPCR repertoire is also shown to house
entirely novel receptor groupings with large numerical
representation, including a Platyhelminth-specific Rhodopsin subfamily (PROF1) and a planarian-specific
Adhesion-like family (PARF1). These particular lineagespecific expansions, along with the many other highlydiverged and receptors identified, may reveal functional
innovations specific to these organisms. Many of these
receptors have enhanced appeal as selective pharmacological targets. While their diverged structures are an
attractive feature in the parasite drug discovery paradigm, this presents a challenge in posing more exact
hypotheses related to receptor function.
To further aid the process of functionally pairing
receptors and ligands, we provide a preliminary classification of full-length receptors using SVMs. This represents the first effort to apply SVMs to the problem of
GPCR classification in a whole-genome manner, a task
made difficult by the evolutionary distance of flatworms
from other species with well-characterized GPCR complements. SVM results may be used in conjunction with
phylogenetic and homology-based approaches to receptor classification. These results suggest that PROF1
receptors may respond to phylum-specific peptide
ligands. As the quality of the underlying gene models
improves, and as a greater number of full-length receptor transcripts are sequence characterized, these SVMs
can be refined and applied to an expanding subset of
identified GPCRs. Functional characterization of flatworm GPCRs is also likely to improve SVM accuracy by
providing more relevant training examples.

The notion that schistosome GPCRs represent lucrative anthelmintic drug targets is strengthened by data
on the crucial biological role of related receptor signaling molecules in nearly-related organisms [82,83], as
well as that of predicted platyhelminth GPCR ligands
[56,57,61,63]. The receptors, ligands and downstream
biochemical pathways associated with GPCR signaling
have been identified as potential targets for parasite lifecycle interruption [23,84]. Enlistment of schistosome
reverse genetics approaches alongside receptor sequence
data can lead to the validation of specific receptors as
drug targets.
In this regard, RNAi in schistosomes [85,86] provides
new opportunities for focused exploitation of this dataset. A simple medium-throughput phenotypic classification system has recently been described for both
schistosomula and adult schistosomes [87]. These endpoints could readily be used in an RNAi-mediated
GPCR loss-of-function screen. Assaying the temporal
expression profiles of parasite GPCRs can also be a
worthwhile measure as a selection tool for receptors
expressed in intra-host stages. On this front, we further
the case for planarians as a convenient model organisms
to interrogate the function of trematode receptors, and
provide a list of inter-species receptor pairings ranked
by sequence identity.
While we further the case of planarians as model
organisms for flatworm parasite research, differences
between the receptor complements of parasitic and
free-living flatworms are also very likely to reveal
important molecular actors. Phylogenetically distinct
planarian receptors are more likely to be involved in
regenerative processes, while receptors unique to schistosomes are more likely to play key roles in parasite
pathogenesis. Both of these avenues present fertile
ground for the targeting and functional elucidation of
specific receptors.

Methods
Predicted proteomes and training sequences

The most recent release of the S. mansoni genomic
assembly is accompanied with a set of 13,197 predicted
proteins [14]. The S. mediterranea predicted proteome
consists of 31,955 predicted proteins that were produced
with MAKER, although this number may represent a
significant overestimate of the true protein count
[15,88]. HMM and SVM training sequences were downloaded from GPCRDB [49]. In total, 268 Glutamate,
5025 Rhodopsin, 175 Adhesion, 354 Frizzled and 185
Secretin sequences were procured for HMM training.
20,920 GPCRDB sequences were used for Rhodopsin
SVM training, and 2,105 sequences were used for amine
SVM subclassification.

Nomenclature

Putative receptors retain their original GeneDB,
MAKER, or GenBlast IDs in modified form. In cases
where a gene model was created, receptors were given a
label in similar form that includes genomic contig or
scaffold information. Letters are appended to the ends
of these labels where necessary to distinguish among
multiple gene models associated with a single contig or
scaffold. All putative flatworm GPCR sequences are provided in association with their tentative IDs (Additional
File 7).
Transmembrane domain prediction

We applied two common algorithms, TMHMM 2.0 [48]
and HMMTOP 2.1 [47], to identify transmembrane
domains in our GPCR training set. HMMTOP correctly
predicted 7 TM domains for 93.8% (4712/5025) of rhodopsin family receptors, compared to 81.9% (4119/5025)
in the case of TMHMM. This disparity in sensitivity
held for all GPCR families, and was the basis for our
decision to employ HMMTOP for most subsequent
work. A robust Perl script (Additional File 8) was written to parse coordinate predictions output from
HMMTOP, and to generate sequence files containing
only regions of interest from the original protein
sequences as required.
TM-focused Profile hidden Markov model (HMM)
construction

Provided a multiple sequence alignment, HMMER-2.3.2
[89] builds a probabilistic model (profile HMM) that
can be used to query sequence databases to find (or
align) homologous sequences. To prepare each GPCR
family training set, predicted TM domains flanked bidirectionally by 5 amino acids were extracted and concatenated using coordinates produced in the previous
section. These sequences were aligned with Muscle 3.6
[90] and a profile HMM was constructed for each family
with hmmbuild. All models underwent calibration using
hmmcalibrate, with the default parameters.
HMM-based GPCR identification

All predicted proteins in the S. mansoni and S. mediterranea genomes with a predicted number of TM
domains in the range of 3-15 were processed in a manner identical to the HMM training set. These TOP-converted protein sets were searched against our familyspecific profile HMMs using hmmpfam. The resulting
hits for each GPCR family were ranked according to Evalue, and a cut-off was selected at the point where subsequent hits showed significant homology to other
known proteins or GPCRs belonging to other families.
This was accomplished with a BLASTp search of all hits
against the NBCI nr database. The BLAST results were

Page 18 of 21

parsed with a script and top results were examined for
removal of false positives.

A large number of GPCR sequences underwent manual
inspection of gene structure, and the original predictions
were edited where possible. Common manual edits
included the merging or splitting of gene models, modification of intron-exon boundaries, and sequence extension or truncation in either or both directions. All
editing was performed with Artemis [91]. Curation was
primarily guided by homology-based searches and identification of TM domains and family-specific GPCR
motifs in ORFs that occurred in the vicinity of a gene
model. In the case of S. mansoni, this labor-intensive
process was aided by the extraction of GeneDB [http://
www.genedb.org/] annotations for scaffolds thought to
contain one or more receptors. More specifically, a
script was written to compile pertinent scaffold information stored in EMBL formatted files, including the
orientation, the number of predicted transmembrane
domains and the top BLAST hits for proteins identified
by the profile HMMs. This data was parsed into a
spreadsheet and proved significant in helping identify
instances where manual curation was appropriate (Additional File 9). In the case of S. mediterranea, annotated
genomic regions were loaded into Artemis and edited in
a similar manner.
Phylogenetic analysis

Near full-length (TM > 5) receptors were first processed
for removal of the N- and C-termini. ClustalX 2.0 [92]
was used to generate multiple sequence alignments of
the GPCRs to be examined, with default parameters.
PFAAT [93] was used to edit the resulting alignment
with attention to key motifs and residues housed within
transmembrane domains. Low-entropy sequence blocks
present in all sequences were retained. The Phylip 3.6
[94]package was used to generate phylogenetic trees.
Alignments were bootstrapped using seqboot. Maximum
parsimony trees were calculated with protpars with
input order randomized. Neighbor-joining trees were
calculated with protdist and neighbor using the JTT
(Jones-Taylor-Thornton) distance matrix and with input
order randomized. Consensus trees were built with consense, and visualized and edited with FigTree [http://
tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/].
PROF1 RT-PCR

Total RNA was extracted from flatworm (schistosome
or planarian) tissue using the RNAqueous Kit (Ambion),
and RNA was treated with Turbo DNAase (Ambion)
per manufacturer’s instructions. A two-step RT-PCR
was performed, where reverse transcription was first

carried out with the Retroscript kit (Ambion). Primers
were designed for two schistosome PROF1 sequences
and 13 planarian PROF1 sequences using Primer 3.0
[95] (Additional File 10). PCR products were visualized
by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm transcript
expression.

written to perform the work described.
Additional file 9: Parsed schistosome EMBL files. CSV file containing
EMBL parser output. This preliminary output of schistosome autoannotated GPCR-related receptor genes helped guide first-pass manual
curation.

SVM

Programs were written to process training sequences
into feature vector form for the training of three SVM
classifiers: SVMT1, SVMT2, and SVMFL (Additional File
3). TM prediction was performed on training sequences
with HMMTOP, and fixed-length dipeptide frequency
vectors were calculated in correspondence with each
model. SVMs were implemented with the the LIBSVM
[96] package. The RBF kernel was chosen and a gridsearch was performed with an available python script
for selection of kernel parameters. C and g were assayed
in the domains C = 2-5, 2-4, ..., 215 and g = 2-15, 2-14, ...,
215 to identify the C,g pair that maximizes 5-fold cross
validation ACC. The classifiers were trained in accordance with the GPCRDB ligand-based groupings, and
applied to a subset of flatworm Rhodopsin receptors
with 7 predicted TM domains.

PROF1 receptors are labeled with ‘*’. A total of 180 receptors were
classified, with the vast majority placed in the peptide and amine
groupings. Interestingly, all 45 PROF1 receptors were classified as
peptide-responsive.
Additional file 6: Table S3. Amine SVM classifier results. Ligandbased classification of flatworm amine-responsive GPCRs with amine
SVMT1. A total of 41 receptors were identified as aminergic via Rhodopsin
SVM classification. In cases of erroneous TM boundary prediction, the
SVMFL classifier was used. The classifier results display correct predictions
for the three schistosome receptors thus far deorphanized in this
subfamily, including two histamine-responsive GPCRs and one
dopamine-responsive GPCR (labeled with ‘*’).
