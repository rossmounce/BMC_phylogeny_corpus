Abstract
Background: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) are regulators of gene expression in all domains of life.
They control growth and differentiation, virulence, motility and various stress responses. The
identification of ncRNAs can be a tedious process due to the heterogeneous nature of this
molecule class and the missing sequence similarity of orthologs, even among closely related species.
The small ncRNA Yfr1 has previously been found in the Prochlorococcus/Synechococcus group of
marine cyanobacteria.
Results: Here we show that screening available genome sequences based on an RNA motif and
followed by experimental analysis works successfully in detecting this RNA in all lineages of
cyanobacteria. Yfr1 is an abundant ncRNA between 54 and 69 nt in size that is ubiquitous for
cyanobacteria except for two low light-adapted strains of Prochlorococcus, MIT 9211 and SS120, in
which it must have been lost secondarily. Yfr1 consists of two predicted stem-loop elements
separated by an unpaired sequence of 16–20 nucleotides containing the ultraconserved
undecanucleotide 5'-ACUCCUCACAC-3'.
Conclusion: Starting with an ncRNA previously found in a narrow group of cyanobacteria only,
we show here the highly specific and sensitive identification of its homologs within all lineages of
cyanobacteria, whereas it was not detected within the genome sequences of E. coli and of 7 other
eubacteria belonging to the alpha-proteobacteria, chlorobiaceae and spirochaete. The integration
of RNA motif prediction into computational pipelines for the detection of ncRNAs in bacteria
appears as a promising step to improve the quality of such predictions.

Background
Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are sequence-specific regulators of gene expression, mediating a plethora of cellular
responses to changing environmental conditions and
morphological differentiation. In bacteria, ncRNAs are a
heterogeneous group of functional RNA molecules normally (but not always) lacking a protein-coding function.

They are frequently smaller than 200 nt in size, and act to
regulate mRNA translation/decay but can also bind to
proteins and thereby modify protein function (recent
reviews [1,2]). In many cases, these ncRNAs function
through sequence-specific base pairing; hence they frequently have a (partial) base complementarity to their target RNA molecules. The vast majority of known ncRNAs is

encoded at genomic locations far away from the target
genes (trans-encoded ncRNAs). However, a small number
of ncRNAs is transcribed from the reverse complementary
strand of the respective target and hence these are fully or
partially overlapping with their target RNAs. This latter
class of ncRNAs is called cis-encoded or antisense RNAs.
As a result of recent systematic searches, more than 70
ncRNAs are now known in E. coli, most of which had been
overlooked by traditional genome analysis. Many, or possibly most major stress responses in E. coli include at least
one small regulatory RNA as part of the regulon [2]. Systematic biochemical, genetic, genomic or computational
searches for ncRNAs are still lacking for most eubacterial
phyla outside the enterobacteria. In general, genes encoding ncRNAs are not annotated during standard genome
analysis procedures. The efforts to accomplish their identification in bacteria can broadly be divided into (i)
sequencing the population of sRNAs (directly or after
cloning) as comprehensively as possible (RNomics) or
(ii) prediction by bioinformatics tools (mostly) followed
by experimental verification (see [3] for a recent review).
There is currently only very scarce information on regulatory RNAs and their genes in cyanobacteria. In addition to
the more common types of ncRNA (tmRNA, 6S RNA,
RNAse P RNA and ffs RNA), less than 10 different ncRNAs
and only three antisense RNAs have been described for
this whole group of bacteria so far [4-6]. Among the
known ncRNAs are Yfr1-7 (cYanobacterial Functional
RNA). The existence of these ncRNAs was predicted for
one (Yfr4 and Yfr5), two (Yfr3 and Yfr6), three (Yfr1) or
four (Yfr2 and Yfr7) strains of the Prochlorococcus/Synechococcus lineage in a comparative genomics-based
approach and their actual presence was demonstrated
under various growth and stress conditions that they
encounter in the natural environment [7]. However, functions and phylogenetic distribution of these ncRNAs have
remained unknown. There are 19 genome sequences from
the Prochlorococcus/Synechococcus clade in the public
domain now, providing an excellent data set for comparative genomics-based computational prediction of
ncRNAs. However, for more distantly related cyanobacteria there are only few such data sets available, rendering
the direct identification of ncRNAs through comparative
genomics difficult. An exception is ncRNA Yfr7. Due to its
exceptionally highly conserved sequence and based on an
extended structural model, this RNA was identified as the
cyanobacterial homolog of a ubiquitous eubacterial
riboregulator, the RNA polymerase – interacting 6S RNA
[8]. Molecular details of its expression in synchronized
cell cultures of Prochlorococcus MED4 are given in more
detail separately [9]. The RNAs Yfr2 through Yfr5 in
Prochlorococcus MED4 constitute a family of closely related
ncRNAs with a length of 89–95 nt [7]. Gene copy num-

bers of Yfr2-5 homologues in other Prochlorococcus and
Synechococcus genomes seem to differ widely and there is
only very little synteny among them. Therefore, here we
selected Yfr1, with 54, 57 and 56 nucleotides in Prochlorococcus MED4, MIT 9313 and Synechococcus WH 8102 the
smallest ncRNA detected in cyanobacteria so far [7], to
address the question if it is possible to find more
orthologs of a short bacterial ncRNA in an alternative
computational-experimental approach. This approach is
likely to be successful also in other cases in which comparative data suggest a highly conserved ncRNA secondary
structure that can be taken as a starting point.

Results and discussion
Yfr1 in marine unicellular cyanobacteria
Cyanobacteria are phototrophic bacteria which perform
oxygenic photosynthesis and populate widely diverse
environments such as freshwater, the oceans, rock surfaces, desert soil or the Polar Regions. Therefore, various
types of regulatory RNA can be expected that interplay
with the different signal transduction pathways and stress
responses. Antisense RNAs found within the gas vesicle
operon in Calothrix PCC 7601 [4], or covering the ferric
uptake regulator gene furA in Anabaena PCC 7120 over its
full length [6], or regulating the light-absorbing protein
IsiA under conditions of iron limitation and redox stress
in the unicellular Synechocystis PCC 6803 [5] are three
known examples for such RNAs in cyanobacteria. Based
on comparative computational analysis, we predicted a
whole set of putative trans-acting ncRNAs with unknown
function, which we called Yfr1-Yfr7 [7].

We have previously shown the existence of Yfr1 in three
out of four tested marine cyanobacteria belonging to the
genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus [7]. Unicellular
marine cyanobacteria of these genera provide an excellent
dataset for computational predictions that require comparative genome information since currently 19 different
genome sequences from very closely related isolates are
available. Thus, there is an extensive dataset to take compensatory base mutations into account for the prediction
of novel ncRNA candidates. In these genomes, orthologs
of Yfr1 can be found even by simple BLAST searches (Fig.
1A).
Prediction of Yfr1 homologs in different classes of
cyanobacteria based on an RNA motif
Despite some recent progress [10], marine unicellular
cyanobacteria are not trivial in functional studies requiring genetic manipulation. Therefore, finding possible
orthologs of Yfr1 in one of the cyanobacterial model species amenable for genetic manipulation would be desirable. The direct identification of such an ncRNA is not
intuitively possible based on sequence similarity alone. In
Table 1, BlastN hits are given for three such model strains,

Figure 1 of putative Yfr1 RNAs from 15 different Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus
Comparison
Comparison of putative Yfr1 RNAs from 15 different Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. A. Sequence alignment of
the top scoring sequences obtained by BlastN using the known Yfr1 sequences [7] as a query. The respective strain numbers
are prefixed "Pro" and "Syn" for Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. B. Sequence/structure model for putative Yfr1 RNAs from
15 different Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus as shown in part A. Sequence is given in IUPAC-notation (R: A or G; Y: C or U;
S: G or C; K: G or U; B: G, U or C; V: G, C or A; D: G, U or A; H: A, C or U). Base pair colors indicate the number of different
base pairs which occur in the different sequences at this position (red = 1, yellow = 2, green = 3) and their shading resembles
the frequency of base pairing, i.e. the number of sequences where this base pair is not present.
Synechocystis PCC 6803, Synechococcus PCC 7942/6301,
Anabaena PCC 7120 and the marine Synechococcus WH
7803. Using the yfr1 full length sequence of Prochlorococcus MED4 (5'-atgggggaaaccccatactcctcacacaccaaatcgcccgatt
tatcgggcttt-3') as a query, only for Synechocystis PCC 6803
a hit to the correct sequence was found, ranking only at
the third position. Similar results were obtained when the
yfr1 full length sequence of Synechococcus WH 8102 was
taken, except that the ortholog in the very closely related
Synechococcus WH 7803 was found with clear statistical
support (score = 77.8 bits, e-value = 4e-16; not shown).
Thus, sequence homology alone is not sufficient and we
reasoned to complement it by comparative structure
information. Taking up this idea, the initial set of the

three previously identified Yfr1 sequences from Prochlorococcus MED4, MIT9313 and Synechococcus WH8102 plus
the novel putative orthologs from the marine Synechococcus/Prochlorococcus were subjected to a comparative
sequence/structure analysis. As a result we derived an initial sequence/structure-model (Fig. 1B) consisting of two
stem loops and a central unpaired section of 18–19 nt.
Interestingly, both loop sequences appeared unconserved
and therefore these were set to aNy nucleotide in our subsequent searches. In contrast, we noted the presence of an
eleven nt highly conserved sequence stretch within the
unpaired central section. We reasoned if this sequence element would be essential and tried different RNA motif
descriptors in which the undecanucleotide had to be fully
conserved or allowed one or two mismatches. Further-

Figure alignment of Yfr1 RNA from 31 cyanobacteria

data in Fig. 1. This model was used to search for orthologs
within genomes of other cyanobacteria and also other
eubacteria. Candidates found by this method were incorporated into the model and, finally, this procedure led to
the identification of putative Yfr1 orthologs in 31 (28
new) out of 33 available cyanobacterial genomes. All here
identified Yfr1 candidates are summarized in a multiple
sequence/structure alignment shown in Fig. 2. An outstanding property appearing in this alignment is the perfectly conserved 11 nt long sequence motif (5'ACUCCUCACAC-3') within the unpaired region. The reason for this perfect conservation might be that this short
sequence is targeting a conserved sequence element in one
or several other RNAs, mRNAs or ncRNAs, through basepairing interactions as it is known for many ncRNAs.
Alternatively, it could also be a protein binding motif. The
rather high concentration of Yfr1 in the different organisms is rather untypical for an ncRNA acting through basepairing.
From this set of orthologs, a comprehensive sequence/
structure-model for Yfr1 was derived (Fig. 3). The 5'-end
forms a 6–10 bp stem-loop, which may be interrupted by

one bulge or internal loop. At the 3'-end the sequences
show a 6–9 bp GC-rich hairpin, followed by a U-tail.
These features make this element very likely to be a Rhoindependent terminator. Furthermore, together with the
5'-terminal helix the 3'-helix may ensure the unpaired
state of the conserved sequence motif and/or protect the
RNA against degradation. One would expect approximately 0.5 instances of a specific 11 nt motif in a 2 MB
genome and equal base distribution of 0.25. The here
identified ultraconserved 5'-ACUCCUCACAC-3' occurs
more often then by chance in the investigated genomes
(for instance, three times in Prochlorococcus sp. MED4,
genome size 1.66 MB; four times in Synechocystis
PCC6803, genome size 3.57 MB, but also twice in Prochlorococcus sp. SS120 where it is not related to Yfr1 and is not
located within a comparable context of possible secondary structure). Therefore, this motif alone is not sufficient
to find homologs of Yfr1. However, it is interesting to note
that the two additional occurrences in Prochlorococcus
MED4 both are located in intergenic spacer regions, close
to two other ncRNAs: 160–150 nt upstream the mapped
5' end of Yfr2 and 128–138 nt upstream of Yfr5 [7]. The
only two cyanobacterial genomes for which no Yfr1

ortholog was found were Prochlorococcus sp. SS120 and
MIT9211. These latter two examples were chosen to test
when the RNA motif prediction would find likely false
positives. When the score was reduced to 0.0 still no candidate Yfr1 homologs were found in these two genomes.
Only when in addition one or two mismatches were
allowed in the central consensus element, candidates were
found (see additional file 1). However, these candidate
sequences could not be aligned to each other or to the
other Yfr1 sequences. In case of Prochlorococcus sp. SS120
also a previous experimental screen had remained negative [7]. Therefore, the candidates found under these very
relaxed conditions (additional file 1) do not appear realistic. Thus, the here desribed search method allows for an
excellent discrimination between true positives and false
positives. This finding is in agreement with studies in
which RNA motif prediction was integrated into computational pipelines for the high-throughput prediction of
cis-regulatory RNA sequences [11].
Conservation of genomic location and flanking genes can
also be a powerful tool for finding related ncRNAs.
Indeed, the yfr1 gene is at a conserved position in the
majority of the here investigated genomes. In 25 out of 31
genomes, it is found upstream a guaB gene, coding for
inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (Table 2).
Even more obvious is the frequent association with a
downstream located trxA gene (27 of 31 genomes, Table
2).
We extended the search also to non-cyanobacterial photosynthetic bacteria, such as the alpha-proteobacteria Erythrobacter litoralis, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Silicibacter sp.
TM1040, the chlorobiaceae Chlorobium tepidum, Chlorobium chlorochromatii and Cytophaga hutchinsonii, as well as

of Yfr1 within these. So far, the occurrence of Yfr1 seems
to be restricted to cyanobacteria. Since cyanobacteria represent a separate eubacterial phylum for at least 2.5 billion
years of evolution it is very likely that Yfr1 originated very
early in the progenitors of this group and must have co-

time.

we also do not predict one here. Summarizing, we found
reasonable orthologs of Yfr1 in 31 out of 33 cyanobacterial strains and, furthermore, their existence could be validated for ten out of ten in this and a previous study.

Experimental verification of Yfr1 in phylogenetically
different groups of cyanobacteria
According to morphologic criteria, cyanobacteria can be
organized into five different sections [12]. These sections
are only partially congruent with molecular phylogenetic
data, therefore we chose six cyanobacterial species which
clearly are very different from each other, judged by their
morphology, 16S rRNA sequence and life style, to test our
result by Northern hybridization. We also included RNA
from Microcystis PCC7806 for which no genome sequence
was available and, hence, no candidate predicted. The
results are given in Fig. 4 and clearly show that Yfr1 is
present in all tested species. Together with the three previous identified ones [7] our experiment raises the number
of validated Yfr1 homologs to ten. In our previous study
we did not identify an Yfr1 homolog in Prochlorococcus
SS120. This is substantiated by the result of this study as

7942 elong. 6803 7806 7120 punct. 7421

Superimposing our results with a phylogenetic analysis
based on 16S rRNA yields the tree shown in Fig. 5. The
widespread existence of Yfr1 over large evolutionary distances points to an important function of Yfr1 throughout
the cyanobacterial domain. Interestingly, Prochlorococcus
SS120 and MIT9211, neither of which is predicted to hold
an Yfr1 homolog, appear in one separate cluster. This lets
us conclude, that these two or a common ancestor of them
lost Yfr1 secondarily. This may be related to their special
habitat. Different Prochlorococcus isolates can broadly
become subdivided in an ecotype adapted to low light
and another one adapted to high light. These ecotypes are
genetically and physiologically distinct [13] and show a
distinct distribution under natural conditions [14,15].
Prochlorococcus SS120 and MIT9211 have both been iso-

16S rRNA-based phylogenetic tree summarizing the presence or absence of Yfr1 in all major cyanobacterial
lineages. Cyanobacteria for which genome sequences are currently available from public databases are in boldface letters.
Those strains, for which a Yfr1 ncRNA was computationally predicted are labeled Yfr1+. Those, for which we provide experimental evidence for the presence of Yfr1 are labeled Yfr1*. We have shown the presence of Yfr1 in the Prochlorococcus strains
MED4 and MIT9313 and in Synechococcus WH 8102 before [7]. The tree is based on a multiple sequence alignment of 16S
rRNA sequences analyzed in MEGA3.1 [24]. Statistic support values were generated by bootstrapping and are only shown if >
70. The 16S rRNA of Chlorobium tepidum TLS served as an outgroup. The sections I-V of cyanobacterial taxonomy [12] are

Starting with a known ncRNA from one lineage we show
here the highly specific and sensitive identification of its
homologs within all lineages of cyanobacteria. The integration of RNA motif prediction into computational pipelines for the detection of ncRNAs in bacteria appears as a
promising step to improve the quality of such predictions.
The only cyanobacteria that appear to lack Yfr1 are
Prochlorococcus SS120 and MIT9211, which both are
adapted to live at very low light intensities and must have
lost Yfr1 secondarily. Therefore, one essential function of
Yfr1 might have to do with the ability to cope with high
photosynthetic energy fluxes or redox conditions.

Methods
Cultures of cyanobacteria
Marine unicellular cyanobacteria were grown as previously published [7]. Cultures of Microcystis aeruginosa,
Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, Thermosynechococcus
elongatus BP-1, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, Nostoc sp. PCC
7120 and Gloeobacter violaceus were obtained from the
Pasteur Culture Collection and one, Nostoc punctiforme
ATCC 29133, from American Tissue Culture Collection.
All cultures were grown as recommended by the Pasteur
Culture Collection.
Extraction and analysis of RNA
Total RNA was isolated as previously described [7] but
with modified lysis conditions for PCC strains, Anabaena
and Nostoc as follows: Disruption by adding an equal volume of glass beads, 33.3 µl 20 % SDS solution and 583 µl
acidic phenol to 500 µl concentrated cell solution, following several cycles of vigorous agitation, freezing in liquid
nitrogen and thawing in a water bath. Centrifugation of
the mixture for 15 min at maximal speed at 4°C yielded
an upper aqueous phase which could be cleaned up by
standard phenol-chloroform-extraction. Finally, the
phases were separated by centrifugation at 9.000 rpm for
15 minutes at 4°C. The RNA was precipitated from the
aqueous phase with 100 µl isopropanol for several hours
at -20°C, pelleted by centrifugation, washed with 75%
ethanol, dried and resuspended in 100 µl of DEPC-treated
water. Total RNA was separated in 10 % polyacrylamideurea gels. Polyacrylamide gels were stained with ethidium
bromide (0.3 µg/l) in 1× TBE buffer, rinsed with water and
analyzed with a Lumi-Imager F1 system (Roche). Transcript sizes were determined by correlation to MspIdigested DNA of plasmid pUC19.
Sequence data
The Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 (=PCC 73102)
genome sequence was downloaded from the JGI website

Comparative sequence/structure analysis
Multiple sequence alignments were generated using ClustalW [19] with default parameters for DNA. Comparative
structure prediction was done with RNAlishapes [20], a
tool which predicts a consensus structure for a set of
aligned sequences by taking covariance and free energy
into account. The resulting consensus structure was analysed together with the multiple sequence alignment
using RALEE [21]. The latter served also for manual optimisation of the alignment and the consensus structure,
respectively, and for the production of color annotated
alignments. Homology searches were done using
RNAMotif [22] based on a combined sequence structure
motif description for Yfr1. The final RNAMotif descriptor
was:
