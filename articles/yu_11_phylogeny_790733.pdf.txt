Abstract
Background: Mustelidae, as the largest and most-diverse family of order Carnivora, comprises eight subfamilies.
Phylogenetic relationships among these Mustelidae subfamilies remain argumentative subjects in recent years. One
of the main reasons is that the mustelids represent a typical example of rapid evolutionary radiation and recent
speciation event. Prior investigation has been concentrated on the application of different mitochondrial (mt)
sequence and nuclear protein-coding data, herein we employ 17 nuclear non-coding loci (>15 kb), in conjunction
with mt complete genome data (>16 kb), to clarify these enigmatic problems.
Results: The combined nuclear intron and mt genome analyses both robustly support that Taxidiinae diverged
first, followed by Melinae. Lutrinae and Mustelinae are grouped together in all analyses with strong supports. The
position of Helictidinae, however, is enigmatic because the mt genome analysis places it to the clade uniting
Lutrinae and Mustelinae, whereas the nuclear intron analysis favores a novel view supporting a closer relationship
of Helictidinae to Martinae. This finding emphasizes a need to add more data and include more taxa to resolve
this problem. In addition, the molecular dating provides insights into the time scale of the origin and
diversification of the Mustelidae subfamilies. Finally, the phylogenetic performances and limits of nuclear introns
and mt genes are discussed in the context of Mustelidae phylogeny.
Conclusion: Our study not only brings new perspectives on the previously obscured phylogenetic relationships
among Mustelidae subfamilies, but also provides another example demonstrating the effectiveness of nuclear noncoding loci for reconstructing evolutionary histories in a group that has undergone rapid bursts of speciation.

Background
The Mustelidae is the largest and most-diverse family of
Carnivora with a distribution throughout all continents
except Australia and Antarctica [1,2]. Recent classifications of the Mustelidae recognize up to eight subfamilies: Mustelinae, Galictinae, Helictidinae, Martinae,
Melinae, Lutrinae, Mellivorinae, and Taxidiinae [3-5].
Phylogenetic relationships among these subfamlies have
been hotly disputed in pioneer studies [3-15] and are
not well established yet. The main problem is that the

family Mustelidae represents a typical example of rapid
evolutionary radiation and recent speciation event [6,7],
dating back to the Oligocene [16-18]. For this reason,
attempts to clarify relationships among the eight Mustelidae subfamilies based on a variety of molecular studies
have encountered challenges.
Previously, molecular studies of the phylogenetic
reconstruction of subfamilies within the Mustelidae
were based on short fragments of nuclear and mt DNA.
Recently, some efforts have been made to obtain the
phylogenetic tree based on large datasets, including
those using 12 mt protein-coding genes [15], 5 nuclear
genes [4,12], 4 nuclear genes and 1 mt gene [10,14], 21
nuclear genes and 1 mt gene [5] and 25 nuclear genes
and mt genes [13]. Despite numerous efforts, however,

Figure 1 Hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships among Mustelidae subfamilies. Trees were reconstructed based on
(a) 46 morphological characters [8], (b) analyses of 21 nuclear genes and 1 mt gene [5], (c) analyses of 5 nuclear genes and 1 mt gene [10]
(support values are indicated above the line) and 25 nuclear genes and mt genome [13] (support values are indicated below the line), (d)
analyses of 5 nuclear genes [4] (support values are indicated above the line) [12] support values are indicated below the line), (e) supertree
analyses of 5 nuclear genes [4].

evolutionary relationships among the Mustelidae subfamilies remain controversial (see Figure 1).
Hence, it is necessary to exploit larger independent
sources of phylogenetic characters to clarify these enigmatic problems. Several studies have shown that relative
to the commonly used nuclear protein-coding and mt
genes, the noncoding intron sequences can be an
equally fruitful source of phylogenetic characters as they
possess a number of traits that are desirable for molecular phylogenetics [19-24], for example, lack of functional
constraints, a high substitution rate and less homoplasy
[19,25,26]. In these studies, the nuclear introns have
been shown to provide powerful complementary data to
address the ambiguous relationships of different taxonomic levels, including the beaked whale species [23],
the Asian pitvipers genus [19], the carnivoran families
[24,27], and the eutherian orders [21].
In the present study, we aim to sequence 17 nuclear
intron loci comprising a total of >15 kb from 17 mustelids. The mustelids examined here represent all subfamilies of Mustelidae, except for Mellivorinae and
Galictinae. Of the 17 nuclear loci, 14 were first applied
in the studies of Mustelidae phylogeny. In addition, we
undertook the sequencing of the mt genome from these

species and presented a phylogeny based on the mt genome data currently available for mustelids. Our objectives were to: (1) provide new insights into the
relationships among the Mustelidae subfamilies, and (2)
examine the utilities and evolutionary dynamics of the
nuclear and mt genes in the context of Mustelidae phylogeny, with special attention to the previously unexplored nuclear intron genes.

Results
Characteristics of the Nuclear Intron Data and Mt
Genomes

The general characteristics of the nuclear intron data
and mt genomes are summarized in Table 1. The
17 nuclear introns of 21 species varied in length from
642 (Fgb-7) to 1685 (Plod2-14) aligned positions. The
removal of ambiguous areas resulted in length variation
of the aligned sequences from 523 (Fgb-4) to 1332
(Coro1c-4) positions. The numbers of parsimony-informative sites range from 71 (13.58%) (Fgb-4) to 343
(30.25%) (Cidea-1). According to different gap selection
criteria in Gblocks, the alignment of the combined dataset comprised 15688 (allowed gap positions = all), 15038
(allowed gap positions = with half) and 12570 (allowed

gap positions = none) positions. The parsimony-informative sites in these three datasets are 2170 (13.83%),
2137(14.21%) and 1735 (13.80%), respectively. An A-T
bias (average = 58.64%) and low transition (Ti)/transversion (Tv) rate ratio (average = 1.93) were observed in
most introns. In addition, most introns showed gamma
shape parameters (a) close to or larger than 1.0. The
nuclear sequence divergence among ingroup taxa ranged
from 3% (Wasf1-7) to 8.2% (Tbc1d7-6), and averaged
4.7%.
The complete mt genomes of 25 species ranged from
16388 to 16623 bp in size. Length differences are largely
due to the variation in tandem repeats within the control region. All genomes shared the same 13 proteincoding genes, 22 tRNAs genes, 2 rRNAs, and a control
region, and also the same gene order. These mt genomes are apparently AT-biased (average = 60.1%). The
sequence divergence among ingroup taxa ranged from
16.3 (ND6) to 23% (ND2) for the protein-coding dataset
(average 20.4%), from 9.2 (12S rRNA) to 10.5% (16S
rRNA) for the rRNA dataset (average 9.85%), 7.3% for
the tRNA dataset, 11.4% for the control region, and
16.6% for the complete dataset.
Occurrence of Transposable Elements (TEs)

In our intron datasets, pervasive transposable element
(TE) insertions were discovered (Table 2), which are
mainly non-long-terminal repeat retrotransposons (nonLTR), e.g., long interspersed elements (LINEs), short
interspersed elements (SINEs), mammalian-wide interspersed repeats (MIRs), and DNA transposons. MIRs
and DNA transposons integrated into the orthologous
loci of all examined species, which suggested an ancient
origin. The result was consistent with the earlier finding
that these two classes of TEs represented remnants or
“fossils” of TEs, predating the radiation of mammalian
orders, and had long ago become inactive in mammalian
lineages [28-30].
The great majority of LINEs and SINEs identified here
were members of the L1_Canid (Fc) and CAN SINE
groups that have been exclusively found in Carnivora
[31-38]. Most of SINEs showed restricted taxonomic
distributions and were characterized by sporadic locations in the intronic regions. This suggests that those
SINEs emerged after species diversification, likely retaining their ability to retrotranspose.
The insertions of TEs at genomic sites are often considered irreversible and random [39], which suggests
that they may be excellent homoplasy-free markers in
phylogenetic analyses [40-43]. Here, we identified one
SINE insertion shared by Martes flavigula, Martes zibellina, Martes foina, Martes pennanti, Martes amaricana,
and Gulo gulo, supporting their close relationship and
the monophyly of Martinae subfamily.

Occurrence of Intra-individual Allele Heterozygotes (IIAHs)

The overall incidence of intra-individual allele heterozygotes (IIAHs) in our 14 new introns appears universal
(Table 3). There were 106 cases of IIAHs in total. Of
the 21 species examined, 3 to 11 cases of IIAHs were
detected from each intron. IIAHs were observed to be
either of equal or variable length. 11 of 14 introns had
allele length variant heterozygotes due to a 1-bp indel,
with the other nucleotide sites either the same or distinct at 1-11 bp. IIAHs of identical length were discovered in all introns with 1-10 substitutional differences.
Generally, IIAHs formed monophyletic pairs on the
phylogenetic trees as expected (see Additional file 1).
Two cases of strongly-supported nonmonophyletic
IIAHs were illustrated by the close relatedness of one
allele of the least weasel Mustela nivalis to one allele of
the European polecat Mustela putorius (Plod2-13 and
Guca1b-3 genes; Figure 2), which are most likely to
indicate the cases of incomplete lineage sorting.
Phylogenetic Inference

Although individual nuclear gene analyses produced
inconsistent topologies with low levels of support
(Additional file 1), possibly due to limited phylogenetic information harbored in a single gene, the analyses of the combined nuclear data set using three gap
selection criteria in Gblocks (allowed gap positions =
none, with half, and all) and different tree-building
methods (MP, ML and Bayesian methods) yielded
nearly identical, well-resolved trees with strong support for all nodes, except for the relationships among
Gulo gulo, Martes americana, and Martes pennanti
(Figure 2). In the tree, Taxidiinae diverged first (MP
BS = 100%, ML BS = 100%, PP = 1.00), followed by
Melinae (MP BS = 85%, ML BS = 98%, PP = 1.00).
The remaining mustelids were divided into two clades,
one consisting of Martinae and Helictidinae (MP BS =
99%, ML BS = 99%, PP = 1.00), and the other one
consisting of Lutrinae and Mustelinae (MP BS = 82%,
ML BS = 99%, PP = 1.00). In addition, both the inclusion of IIAHs in the combined nuclear analysis using
software POFAD [44] and the Bayesian concordance
analysis (BCA) analysis (Additional file 2) using software BUCKy [45] produced the same tree topologies
as that in Figure 2. At the subfamily level, all nodes in
the BCA analysis received high concordance factors
(CF) value (1.000).
For individual mt gene analyses, the rRNA and tRNA
data sets demonstrated reduced resolving power for phylogenetic inference compared to protein-coding gene
analysis (Additional file 3). The complete mtDNA genome-based analyses, irrespective of the used tree-building
methods and parameter sets, produced a well-resolved
and well-supported tree (Figure 3), with the tree topology

and branch supports identical to that of the combined
protein-coding gene analysis. At the subfamilial level, the
single difference between mt genome tree (Figure 3) and
combined nuclear gene tree (Figure 2) is the phylogenetic
position of Helictidinae. In mt genome tree, Helictidinae
is closer to the clade uniting Lutrinae and Mustelinae
than to Martinae (MP = 60%; ML BS = 95%; PP = 1.00).
The phylogenetic tree reconstructed from the combined
nuclear and mt genome data set by using the BCA analysis [45] produced a tree topology (Additional file 2)
identical to that from the combined nuclear gene analysis (Figure 2). At the subfamily level, all nodes received
high CFs (1.000), except for that of Helictidinae (CF =
0.502), whose position is the single discrepancy between
the combined nuclear and mt gene trees.
Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test and the approximately
unbiased (AU) test were carried out to examine the
degree of significant difference between the nuclear and

mt trees produced in the present study. Both tests indicated significant topological incongruence concerning
the phylogenetic position of Helictidinae between the
nuclear and mt trees. When using nuclear data, the mt
genome tree topology, in which Helictidinae is closer to
the clade uniting Lutrinae and Mustelinae, was rejected
by the AU and SH tests (P < 0.05). When using mt genome data, the nuclear tree topology, in which Helictidinae and Martinae are grouped together, was rejected by
the AU and SH tests (P < 0.05).
Divergence Time Estimation

Divergence time estimates for the origin and diversification of Mustelidae subfamilies yielded broadly consistent
results between combined nuclear and mt genome data
set (Table 4). Combined nuclear gene analysis placed
the earliest branching Taxidiinae around 23.73 Mya
(95% confidence intervals = 22.80-24.70 Mya). After

Discussion
Phylogeny of Mustelidae Subfamilies

Among mammalian phylogenies, those characterized by
rapid species radiations have long been one of the plaguing and challenging problems in species tree reconstruction [46]. This is the first study utilizing data from
such large-scale nuclear non-coding loci from
Mustelidae.
Both our combined nuclear intron and mt genome
phylogenies not only strongly favor the prevailing view
that Taxidiinae was the most basal member within
family Mustelidae [4,5,10-14], but also provide strong

evidence that Melinae diverged between Taxidiinae and
all the other mustelids examined as well. The latter is in
contradiction to morphological investigations [8], but
supports the nuclear gene results from Sato et al.
[11,12] and Wolsan and Sato [13], and disagree those
from Koepfli et al. [5] and Yu et al. [15].
Notably, the sister relationship between Lutrinae and
Mustelinae was reinforced by consistent recovery from
both our mt genome and combined nuclear intron analyses with high confidence, upholding and strengthening
the hypothesis drawn by almost all sequence-based analyses in previous studies [4,5,7,10-15]. In contrast, the
position of Helictidinae varied between our nuclear and
mt genome analyses. Nuclear data analysis placed it as
sister to Martinae, whereas mt genome data indicated a
sister-taxa association of it to the clade uniting Lutrinae
and Mustelinae. Our mt genome result (Figure 3) is
consistent with that inferred from most previous nuclear
studies [3-5,10-13], but dissented from morphological
view and karyological analyses [8,47-49]. Interestingly,
our combined nuclear analysis (Figure 2) yields a result

that is different from all previous hypotheses, suggesting
for the first time Helictidinae and Martinae are more
closely related to each other than any other taxa in
Mustelidae.
Corresponding tests (AU and KH tests) have indicated
significant topological incongruence between nuclear
and mt trees. When using nuclear data, the mt genome
tree topology was rejected by the AU and SH tests (P <
0.05), and vice versa. Phylogenetic incongruence
between nuclear and mitochondrial genes has also been
reported in Drosophila, Aves and bears [50-53]. Various
elements may bear the responsibility for the presence of
conflicting signal regarding the placement of Helictidinae, including different evolutionary histories and gene
properties in gene regions from different genomes, sampling error and lineage sorting. The probability of their
occurrence increased especially when separation time
between different species is short [54-57], as in the present study. Although the BCA analysis of the combined
nuclear intron and mt genome sequences, which is an
approach that allows for gene tree discordance, retrieved

Therefore, the analyses involving more characters in the

Implications for Mustelidae Radiation

Mustelidae has one of the most extensive fossil records
of extant Carnivora families [8], and molecular dating of
the Mustelidae radiation has also been attempted in several studies previously. Our results, from an independent
character source, provide important insights into the
time scale of the origin and diversification of extant subfamilies of Mustelidae. It is interesting to draw a comparison of the dating results estimated from prior and
present studies (Table 4).
Among the subfamilies, Taxidiinae is the basal-most
branching lineage in mustelid diversification dating to
the late Oligocene, which is more concordant with the
time estimate of Koepfli et al. [5], but earlier than those
of Bininda-Emonds et al. [58], Yonezawa et al. [15] and
Eizirik et al. [59]. The divergence time of the next
branching lineage, i.e., Melinae clade, is dated to the
early Miocene in our analysis, which is more broadly
consistent with the paleontological data [60] and the
sequence-based data from Yonezawa et al. [15] than
those from Sato et al. [2], Bininda-Emonds et al. [54],
Koepfli et al. [5], and Eizirik et al [59]. The estimates of
the origin of the remaining mustelids are more recent
than those fossil-based ages [61], and older than the
other sequence-based dates [2,5,15,58,59].
Among the remaining mustelids, one important event
of the mustelid diversification is the divergence between
Lutrinae and Mustelinae. Our estimated dates are consistent with the corresponding fossil records [60,62] and
that from Yonezawa et al. [15], but more recent than
those from Hosoda et al. [63], Wayne [64], and Sato
et al. [2], and older than those from Koepfli et al. [5]
and Eizirik et al. [59]. Other important events are the
origins of Mustelinae and Martinae. Our estimates for
them are both much older than the existing fossil record
[65,66]. The dates of Mustelinae origin are older than
most of the other molecular estimates, but in good
agreement with that of Koepfli et al. [5]. As regards the
origin of Martinae, there is large difference between our
nuclear and mt genome estimates. The nuclear estimate
is more in agreement with those from Koepfli et al. [5]
and Eizirik et al. [59], while the mt estimate is more
concordant with those from Hosoda et al. [63] and
Yonezawa et al. [15].
In addition, our analyses resulted in time estimates of
divergence of Helictidinae that more agree with that
from Koepfli et al. [5] than that from Bininda-Emonds
et al. [58], which is younger than the present results.

More intensive taxonomic sampling will improve accuracy on the time estimation of mustelid diversification.
Utilities of the nuclear introns in phylogenetic study of
Mustelidae subfamilies

Several recent studies have indicated that nuclear
introns hold considerable signals for resolution of difficult phylogenies at both shallow and deeper species
level hierarchies [21-24,27,67,68]. We are among the
first to use large-scale nuclear intron genes in inferring
phylogenies of Mustelidae. Our analysis not only brings
new perspectives on the phylogenetic relationship of
Mustelidae subfamilies, but provides another example
demonstrating that the nuclear non-coding genes can be
an effective data source for reconstructing evolutionary
histories in a group that has undergone rapid bursts of
speciation as well.
We assessed the phylogenetic utilities of individual
introns and mt genes in resolution of the inter-subfamilial relationships of Mustelidae by counting the number
of congruent nodes between the individual phylogenies
and the combined gene trees (Table 5). In the individual
nuclear gene analyses, the Plod2-13 gene recovered all 8
nodes of the combined nuclear gene tree. Anyway, the
Plod2-13 and Plod2-14 genes recovered the highest
number of congruent nodes of the combined nuclear
gene tree, whereas the Wasf1-7, Guca1b-3, Ssr1-5, and
Tbc1d7-6 genes showed the lowest phylogenetic performance. As regards the mt gene analyses, we observed
that the ND5 and CYTB genes recovered all 9 nodes of
the mt genome tree. Ranking the single mt gene shows
that the ND5, CYTB, 16SrRNA and ND2 genes are better indicators of Mustelidae phylogeny at subfamilial
level than are other genes, such as Atp8, Atp6 and
ND4L genes. This result agrees broadly with previous
conclusions about the rough classification of mt genes
into good, medium, and poor performance categories
[69-74] (Additional file 4). In summary, the assessment
of phylogenetic utility and limits of these individual
nuclear and mt genes makes it possible to preselect subsets of genes for future molecular studies of vertebrate
phylogeny.
Although the use of nuclear introns as genetic markers has now been implemented as a powerful approach
in recent phylogenetic studies, there are, however,
numerous potential problems associated with this
approach. Chief among these is the difficulties in
sequence data acquisition, alignment, and analysis of the
nuclear introns compared to the traditional mt and
nuclear protein-coding genes, as a result of the higher
rates of variation and frequencies of indels. The common presence of indels (including TEs, small gaps and
tandem repeats) and IIAHs, as reported in this study,
makes experimental work labor-intensive by virtue of

Yu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:92
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/92

the additional time and money required to isolate alleles
and optimize PCR amplification and sequencing. In
addition, they can create positional homology problems
associated with areas of ambiguous alignment [75]. Several studies have also shown that the phylogenetic inference is sensitive to the various treatments of indels.
These issues are central to the appropriate application
of intron data in phylogenetic reconstruction and they
should be comprehensively and explicitly addressed in
the future studies [19].

Conclusions
The phylogenetic relationships among Mustelidae subfamilies have posed one of the major problems concerning
Carnivora systematics. In this study, phylogenetic relationships among Mustelidae subfamilies are presented
based on 17 nuclear intron loci and mt whole genomes.
Our results resolve some of the ambiguous issues in
Mustelidae phylogeny, whereas some phylogenetic relationships require confirmation by analyzing additional
samples and character information, such as the precise
position of Helictidinae. Our study not only brings new
perspectives on the previously obscured phylogenetic
relationships among Mustelidae subfamilies, but also
provides another example demonstrating the effectiveness of nuclear non-coding loci for reconstructing evolutionary histories in a group that has undergone rapid
bursts of speciation.
Methods
Sequence Data

Detailed information of the 14 nuclear intron loci first
used in the Mustelidae phylogeny is shown in Additional file 5. These loci were amplified with primers as
described in Yu et al. [27] from 17 mustelids and 4 nonmustelid carnivoran species. Three other nuclear introns
(Ttr-1, Fgb-4 and Fgb-7), which were available from our
previous published studies [14,76,77], were also included
in the present nuclear data set.
The species examined in this study and their Genbank
accession numbers are listed in Additional file 6. A
“touch-down” PCR amplification was carried out using
the following parameters: 95°C hot start (5 min), 10
cycles of 94°C denaturation (1 min), 60-50°C annealing
(1 min), 72°C extension (1 min), and finally 25 cycles of
94°C denaturation (1 min), 50°C annealing (1 min), 72°C
extension (1 min). The amplified DNA fragments were
purified and sequenced in both directions with an ABI
PRISM(tm) 3730 DNA sequencer following the manufacturer’s protocol. In the case of poor performance of
direct sequencing resulting from complex DNA structures, tandem repeats or intron heterozygotes, the
amplified PCR products were gel-purified and cloned
into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co.,

Page 12 of 16

Ltd. Dalian, China) and transformed into ultracompetent
E. coli cells (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Dalian,
China). Thirty positive clones per ligation reaction were
sequenced. All sequences obtained were checked carefully and queried in BLAST searches of GenBank to
assess homology. In a few cases, PCR attempts using different primer pairs and cloning methods failed to produce sequence data (see Additional file 6). These
sequences were excluded from the independent gene
analyses and treated as missing data in the combined
analyses. The newly determined nuclear sequences have
been deposited in GenBank with accession numbers
HM063147-HM063412.
The mt complete genome sequences were amplified
using LA PCR™ Kit (Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd)
and 9 universal long PCR primers from 14 mustelids
and 2 non-mustelid carnivoran species (Additional file
6). In addition, 23 species-specific primers were
designed when the universal PCR primers failed to produce successful PCR amplification. A “touch-down” long
PCR amplification was carried out using the following
parameters: 95°C hot start (2 min), 10 cycles of 98°C
denaturation (10 sec), 67-58°C annealing (1 min 30 sec;
°C/cycle), 72°C extension (5 min), and finally 25 cycles
of 98°C denaturation (10 sec), 58°C annealing (1 min 30
sec), 72°C extension (5 min). At the end, a final 10-min
extension at 72°C was performed. Long PCR products
were sequenced in both directions using a primer walking strategy with a total of 306 primers. Sequencing was
performed in an ABI PRISM(tm) 3700 DNA sequencer
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Primer sequence
information is available upon request. Where necessary,
PCR products were cloned into the pMD18-T vector
and transformed into ultracompetent E. coli cells
(TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Dalian, China) in order
to resolve the difficulty of direct sequencing of control
regions arising from long tandem repeats. Five positive
clones per ligation reaction were sequenced. Mt
sequences obtained were checked to ensure that they
did not include nuclear copies of mtDNA-like pseudogenes. In addition to these new 16 mt genomes, 6 other
mustelid and 3 other non-mustelid mt genomes available in public database were included in the mt analyses
(Additional file 6).
Alignments and sequence Characterizations

Sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL X under the
default settings [78]. The nuclear alignment was divided
into two data sets: (1) each of the 17 intron loci and (2)
combined sequences of all introns. The mt alignment
was divided into four data sets: (1) each of the 13 protein-coding genes, (2) 22 tRNAs, (3) two rRNAs, and (4)
combined sequences of the tRNAs, rRNAs and proteincoding genes. Due to the presence of ambiguous areas

Yu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:92
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/92

in the nuclear alignments, we excluded the alignment
ambiguities using Gblocks 0.91b [79] with default parameters (allowed gap positions = all).
Pairwise comparisons and sequence characterizations
were estimated using MEGA 4.0 [80]. Given that
nuclear introns tend to be favorable chromosomal
regions for integration of transposable elements (TEs)
[81], they were screened for interspersed repeats by
using the program RepeatMasker (Smit, Hubley and
Green, RepeatMasker Open-3.0. 1996-2004, http://www.
repeatmasker.org).
Phylogenetic Analyses

Phylogenetic analyses of the individual introns and mt
genes, i.e., nuclear data set (1) and mt data set (1), (2),
and (3), were performed using PAUP* 4.0b10 [82] for
maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood
(ML) analyses, and using MrBayes 3.1.2 [83] for the
Bayesian inference. In MP analyses, a heuristic search
was performed with tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR)
branch swapping, random addition of taxa, and 1000
replicates per search. Only one of the best trees found
during branch swapping was saved. In ML analysis, the
best-fit models of sequence evolution were selected
using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [84,85]
with Modeltest version 3.7 [86]. The chosen models and
their parameters were used to infer ML trees with the
heuristic algorithm, 10 random-addition sequence replicates, and TBR branch swapping. The tree reliability
under ML analysis was assessed using a bootstrap
resampling of 100 replicates (BP) [87]. In Bayesian inference, each Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) run for all individual genes employed
the model selected by ModelTest for that gene, or the
nearest model to that model that could be implemented
in MrBayes. Three heated chains and a single cold chain
were used in all MCMC analyses and run for 2 × 106
generations, Trees were sampled every 100 generation.
The average standard deviation of split frequencies was
close to 0.001 when the run was end. The first 25%
were discarded as the burn-in. A 50% majority-rule consensus of post burn-in trees was constructed to summarize posterior probabilities (PP) for each branch.
In addition to individual analyses, phylogenetic reconstruction were performed based on the combined data
sets, i.e., nuclear data set (2) and mt data set (4), using
PAUP* 4.0b10 [82] for MP analysis, RAxML online web
server [88] for partitioned ML analysis and using
MrBayes [83] for partitioned Bayesian analysis (pBI)
[89]. For the combined data sets, we identified model
partitions based on partitioning matrices by locus. That
is, in the analysis of combined nuclear data set, each
nuclear intron gene was considered as a different

Page 13 of 16

partition, whereas in that of combined mt data set, each
of the 13 individual protein-coding genes, all tRNAs,
and each of the two rRNA genes were considered as different partitions. Based on the selected models using the
AIC [84] as mentioned above for individual analyses, we
assigned a separate substitution model for each of the
data partitions. Three heated chains and a single cold
chain were used in all MCMC analyses and run for 5 ×
106 generations, sampling trees every 100 generations.
The average standard deviation of split frequencies was
close to 0.001 when the run was end. The first 25%
were discarded as the burn-in. A 50% majority-rule consensus of post burn-in trees was constructed to summarize posterior probabilities (PP) for each branch.
In addition, given the heterogeneous gene trees
observed among 17 nuclear intron gene analyses and
between the combined nuclear intron and mt genome
analyses, Bayesian concordance analysis (BCA) [45]
implemented in the program BUCKy [45], which uses
individually calculated gene trees to infer the species
tree that maximizes the bipartition concordance among
each gene tree, was also performed for both the nuclear
intron gene datasets and the nuclear plus the mt genome datasets. Tree reliability was evaluated by sample
concordance factors (CFs). The MCMCMC sampled
with 2 × 106 generations was employed (4 runs and 4
chains) and a priori level of discordance a = 2.5 was
used in BCA.
In all analyses, trees were rooted with the red panda
Ailurus fulgens and the skunk Mephitis mephitis, based
on the general consensus that they branched off earlier
than the mustelids [2,4,11,12,76,77].
Intra-individual allele heterozygotes

For individual intron analyses, both copies of alleles
from a species were included. For combined nuclear
data sets, we performed phylogenetic analyses by (1)
choosing randomly an allele per species for portioned
ML analysis and Bayesian analysis (without the inclusion
of IIAHs), and (2) using POFAD v1.03 algorithm (Phylogeny Analysis From Allelic Data) [90] to incorporate
IIAHs. POFAD is a recently developed method of constructing phylogeny from multiple datasets that contain
allelic information. It converts a distance matrix of
alleles into a distance matrix of organisms so that individuals become the terminals of the analyses. First, we
calculated the average uncorrected pairwise distances in
PAUP* [82]. These distances then served as the input
for the calculation of standardized pairwise distances
between species in POFAD [90]. The standardized distances were then used as input for the neighbor-joining
analysis conducted using PAUP* [82] to produce a phylogenetic tree.

Divergence time estimation

Divergence times based on combined nuclear intron and
combined mt data sets were estimated using the Bayesian
relaxed phylogenetic approach implemented in BEAST
v1.5.4 [91]. We assumed a GTR+I+G model of DNA substitution with four rate categories. Uniform priors were
employed for GTR substitution parameters (0, 100),
gamma shape parameter (0, 100) and proportion of
invariant sites parameter (0, 1). The uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock model was used to estimate
substitution rates for all nodes in the tree, with uniform
priors on the mean (0, 100) and standard deviation (0,
10) of this clock model. We employed the Yule process
of speciation as the tree prior and a UPGMA tree to construct a starting tree, with the ingroup assumed to be
monophyletic with respect to the outgroup.
Three calibration points from the fossil records were
applied in the dating analyses. These calibration points
are all implemented as minimum age constraints,
including 27.6 Mya for the split between Procyonidae
and Mustelidae [12,15,92], 24 Mya for the crown Mustelidae [2,5,17], and 5.3 Mya for the origin of the genus
Mustela in Mustelinae [5,93]. All fossil constraint priors
were set as means of a normal distribution, with a standard deviation of 1.0 MYA. Two independent MCMC
runs of 30,000,000 generations were performed for each
data set with parameters logged every 1,000 generations.
The Auto Optimize Operators function was enabled to
maximize efficiency of MCMC runs. Two independent
MCMC runs for each analysis were combined to estimate the posterior distribution of the substitution model
and tree model parameters, as well as node ages. Analyses of these parameters in Tracer 1.5 [94] suggested
that the number of MCMC steps was more than adequate, with effective sample sizes of all parameters often
exceeding 1,000 and Tracer plots showing strong equilibrium after discarding burn-in.
Testing Tree Incongruence

The incongruence among different tree topologies was
evaluated using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test [95]
and the approximately unbiased (AU) test [96], as
implemented in the CONSELV0.1i program [97] with
default scaling and replicate values. The site-wise loglikelihood values were estimated by PAUP* [82].
