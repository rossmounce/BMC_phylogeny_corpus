Abstract
Four primate (PTLV), human (HTLV) and simian (STLV) T-cell leukemia virus types, have been
characterized thus far, with evidence of a simian zoonotic origin for HTLV-1, HTLV-2 and HTLV3 in Africa. The PTLV envelope glycoprotein surface component (SUgp46) comprises a receptorbinding domain (RBD) that alternates hypervariable and highly conserved sequences. To further
delineate highly conserved motifs in PTLV RBDs, we investigated the intrahost variability of HTLV1 and STLV-1 by generating and sequencing libraries of DNA fragments amplified within the RBD
of the SUgp46 env gene. Using new and highly cross-reactive env primer pairs, we observed the
presence of Env quasispecies in HTLV-1 infected individuals and STLV-1 naturally infected
macaques, irrespective of the clinical status. These intrahost variants helped us to define highly
conserved residues and motifs in the RBD. The new highly sensitive env PCR described here
appears suitable for the screening of all known variants of the different PTLV types and should,
therefore, be useful for the analysis of seroindeterminate samples.

Findings
Human T-cell lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) and their simian T-cell lymphotropic virus (STLV) counterparts belong
to the Retroviridae family and are globally referred to as
primate T-cell lymphotropic viruses (PTLV). Thus far, four
distinct groups of PTLV have been discovered: PTLV-1, -2
and -3 include both human (HTLV-1, -2, -3) and simian
(STLV-1, -2, -3) viruses while the fourth type (HTLV-4) has
only been described in humans [1-3]. HTLV-1 is a persistent virus, infecting 15–25 million people worldwide, the

majority of whom remain asymptomatic their entire life.
However, HTLV-1 is the etiological agent of a malignant
CD4 lymphoproliferation (adult T-cell leukemia [ATL])
[4] and a chronic progressive neuromyelopathy (tropical
spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy [TSP/
HAM]) [5,6]. In addition, HTLV-1 has been shown to be
associated with a range of other inflammatory diseases
[7,8]. Transmission of PTLV occurs predominantly from
mother to child by breast feeding [9] and by sexual or
blood contacts [10,11].

The close relationship between HTLV and STLV suggests a
simian origin for HTLV. The HTLV-I strains can be classified into six different subtypes according to their geographic origin [2]. Moreover, phylogenetic analyses of the
global spread of PTLV-1 strains has shown that some
HTLV-1 strains are closely related to STLV-1, suggesting
the occurrence of multiple cross-species transmissions
between primates and humans and also between different
primate species [12].
Unlike other retroviruses, which in general show a high
rate of nucleotide substitutions, PTLV exhibit a remarkable genetic stability [13]. This is generally attributed to the
fact that these viruses replicate in vivo mainly via clonal
expansion of infected cells [14-17]. Despite this low level
of variability of HTLV-1 (from 1% to 8% between strains
[18-20], a few PCR-based variability studies have shown
some intrastrain variability in several parts of the viral
genome, such as the LTR U3, tax or env [18,21-23]. On the
other hand, almost no genetic variation has been
observed in the 5'end of HTLV-1 env in samples obtained
from 2 asymptomatic patients [24]. Thus, the extent of
intrahost genetic diversity in HTLV-infected individuals is
not well known.
The extracellular surface component (SU) of retroviral
envelopes is involved in cellular tropism, target cell infection, and induction of host viral immunity. For any retrovirus, the SU exhibits the highest level of protein
variability [25]. The prototypic Gammaretrovirus MLV SU
comprises several variable regions that confer receptor
binding properties which are distinctive of MLV subgroups [26]. The HTLV-1 envelope glycoprotein consists
of an SUgp46 associated to a TMgp21 transmembrane
component. HTLV SU has been shown to have a modular
structure similar to that of MLV SU [27,28] and like all
identified gammaretrovirus envelopes [29,30] it recognizes a multimembrane-spanning nutrient-transporter as
a receptor. The first 160 amino acids of the 291 residuelong mature HTLV-1 SU have been shown to contain the
HTLV Env receptor binding domain (RBD) and to direct
binding to the glucose transporter GLUT1 shown to be a
HTLV-1 and 2 receptor [28,31,32]. This binding involves
the carboxy terminal 6th extracellular loop (ECL6) in
GLUT1, whereas other receptor determinants in ECL1 and
ECL5 of GLUT1 appear to modulate post-binding viral
entry events [32].
In order to delineate conserved motifs that are likely to be
involved in binding or post-binding events, we have
investigated the intrahost variability of HTLV-1 and STLV1 RBD by sequencing intrahost libraries of DNA fragments amplified from the RBD-encoding part of the env
gene.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/29

DNA directly isolated from blood samples obtained from
three unrelated infected individuals, one asymptomatic
seropositive donor, one ATL patient, and one TSP/HAM
patient, were used to derive a fragment library of SU RBD
and tax amplicons. In parallel, we amplified the equivalent regions in samples obtained from 2 STLV-1 naturallyinfected Celebes macaques (Macaca tonkeana) from Indonesia [33].
Using a multiple envelope alignment of all available PTLV
strain types, we designed degenerate PCR primers spanning the RBD in order to allow the detection of all PTLV
env-like sequences. We delineated a 195 nt sequence surrounding the env gene codon corresponding to Tyr114 in
the HTLV-1 SU RBD, previously shown to be a critical
determinant for HTLV Env receptor binding [31]. This
PTLV-env PCR was highly sensitive when tested on several
blood samples obtained from HTLV infected individuals
as well as from STLV infected monkeys. As a highly conserved control sequence we also amplified and sequenced
intrahost fragments corresponding to a 219 bp fragment
of the HTLV-1 tax gene. For our study, we used degenerate
PCR primers in order to match all different sequences
present in the template. One μg of DNA from fresh
PBMCs for each sample was amplified by nested PCR
using the primers and cycling conditions as follows(using
standard abbreviations for degenerate positions) : 83VS,
5' TAYBTATTYCCNCATTGG 3'; and 240VAS, 5' RTANAGNACRTGCCA 3', located in the Y/LFPHW motif and
WHVLY motif, respectively (positions 5452 to 5926 in the
ATK-1 reference strain [34]) for the first amplification
round and 83VS and 146VAS, 5' NACYTCYTGRGTRAARTT 3', the latter corresponding to the NFTQEV
motif, for the second round of amplification. Touchdown PCR was performed using High Fidelity Platinium®
Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) including a hot start
(94°C for 2 min), with the following cycle conditions: 26
cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 50°C decreasing by 0.5°C per
cycle, and 72°C for 45 s; this was followed by 12 cycles of
94°C for 30 s, 48°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 45 s, with a
final elongation at 72°C for 5 min before cooling to 4°C.
Then, 1/15th of the first PCR volume was used as the
source of templates in a semi-nested amplification performed with the same cycling conditionsexcept for the
annealing step (50°C decreasing 0.5°C per cycle for the
first 10 cycles followed by 30 cycles at 50°C). The tax-rex
fragments were amplified using previously described
generic primers and PCR conditions [35]. PCR amplification products were then purified by gel extraction and
cloned into pGEM-TEasy vector (Promega). Recombinant
plasmids were sequenced using cycle sequencing and dye
terminator methodologies (DYEnamic ET Terminator
Cycle Sequencing Kit [Amersham Biosciences]) on an
automated sequencer (ABI Prism 310, Applied Biosystems). Fifty independent clones and 68 to 86 independent

clones were sequenced for tax and env regions, respectively. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences (corresponding to the PCR fragment without primers) were aligned
with ClustalW(1.7) [36], and analysis of the selective pressure was performed for all env sequences as described by
Nei and Gojobori [37].
We used highly cross-reactive tax primer pairs, previously
shown to match sequences from a variety of divergent
HTLV and STLV strains, to amplify our samples. Sequencing and subsequent analyses of the corresponding 183 bp
fragments of 50 independent PTLV-1 tax clones derived
independently from one healthy carrier, one ATL patient
and 2 macaques (Mac1 and Mac2), resulted in only a single nucleotide change in 2 clones. One change was
observed in a clone derived from Mac1, while the second
change was observed in a clone derived from the ATL

patient sample. Each change translated into a different
amino acid substitution when compared to the consensus
sequence. Thus, in our experimental conditions, the frequency of bases changes that could be attributed to the
Taq polymerase remained under 0.4%.
Intrahost variations in PTLV-1 RBD sequences
In contrast to the apparently homogeneous viral population observed after tax sequencing, a significant degree of
variability was seen with env. Indeed, there was an important sequence heterogeneity within each isolate, indicative of a quasispecies nature of HTLV-1/STLV-1 infections,
as revealed by intrahost variations in the Env RBD (Figure
1). Overall, the different point mutations appeared randomly distributed throughout the fragment. The maximum pairwise distances within each group of
quasispecies were 1.8%, 2.5% and 3.8% in the TSP/HAM,
ATL and asymptomatic HTLV-1 infected patients, respectively, and ranged from 1.8% to 4.4% in STLV-1
macaques, reflecting an equal range of quasispecies diversity in the two host species (Table 1). In each sample, six
to 11 intrahost variants were identified at the nucleotide
level. For example, among the 77 clones sequenced from
the TSP/HAM patient, 16 clones had one or more point
mutations in the RBD, amongst which 37.5% led to an
amino acid change. Two variants in the TSP/HAM patient
presented a G-to-A mutation that translates into a stop
codon at position 120 of the gp46 (Figure 1). Frequencies
of nucleotide substitutions in the three HTLV-1 patients
were comparable to those of the 2 STLV-1 macaques.
Overall, we recorded 88 point mutations, with T-to-C
transitions more frequently observed than A-to-G, as previously reported by others for env variants [38]. Altogether, these 88 point mutations led to 46 amino acid
substitutions (Table 1). With the low percentage of background Taq polymerase error estimated with tax, it was
clear that the majority of the RBD variants observed in our
study occurred in vivo in both the simian and human natural hosts.

The rate of nonsynonymous changes per nonsynonymous
site (dn) and the rate of synonymous changes per synonymous site (ds) were calculated for the RBD sequences of
each patient and macaque. A nonsynonymous substitution rate higher than the synonymous substitution rate
indicates positive selection for advantageous mutations,
whereas a nonsynonymous rate lower than the synonymous rate indicates « purifying selection » that prevents
the spread of detrimental mutations [39,40]. A significantly higher rate of nonsynonymous substitutions was
observed with the ATL sample as compared to the TSP/
HAM sample. Although this might be related to the infection history and clinical features of the two patients, a
larger series of samples will be required to assess this initial observation. The dn/ds ratio we calculated were rela-

tively low (< 0.5) for all blood samples, irrespective of the
host species and the clinical status. Therefore, despite the
significant level of intrahost variations observed in the
RBD sequences, strong constraints against sequence variation prevailed in the RBD region of the PTLV-1 env genes.
Conserved residues in RBD
Our multiple alignments of the amplified region of the SU
RBD showed that several residues such as, K91, S101,
D106, Q118, W120, Y124, S129, P131, W133 and D138
or motifs such as, G98Y99 and C112PYLG116 are highly
conserved between all HTLV and STLV virus strains available from Genbank. Comparative analyses of all our RBD
variants highlighted a fewer number of positions with
conserved residues, including D106, D138, GY and
CPYLG (Figure 1). Y114 in the CPYLG motif and D106,
previously described as important for HTLV Env receptor
binding were conserved in all our variants. A P113 to S
change observed within the highly conserved CPYLG
motif might have either derived from Taq errors or represented a bona fide mutant. It would, therefore, be interesting to test whether this mutation affected different Env
functions.

Interestingly, the low degree of env sequence variation
found between isolates does not reflect the significant
degree of env sequence variation found within individuals. However, the same dominant HTLV-1 sequence was
found independently in the three unrelated infected
patients and the two STLV-1 macaques, in agreement with
a strong positive pressure on this highly conserved consensus. Altogether, our results point to the selective transmission of an optimally adapted form, rather than to an
absence of replication or to a stricter polymerase fidelity
of PTLV-1.
Importantly, our new highly sensitive env PCR protocol,
based on degenerate primers matching conserved motifs
in the RBD, allows the detection of all known PTLV types
(data not shown). This property will help elucidate further the detection of undescribed PTLV divergent variants
as well as that of potentially undescribed PTLV types
which would be masked under conventional PTLV PCR
screening.

Env: envelope glycoprotein

In summary, our results illustrate the diversity of proviral
sequences that coexist within the env RBD. These in vivo
findings suggest that there is an ongoing viral replication
in PTLV-1 infected hosts, regardless of the clinical status
and the host species. In light of these results that unveil
significant intrahost variations in the env RBD region and
not in the tax region, it will be of interest to evaluate intrahost variability, ideally at different stages of infection,
within other regions of the viral genome.

HTLV : Human T-cell lymphotropic virus

Some of the variants identified here have never been
described previously. Moreover, several variants were
identified in unrelated samples (variants common to the
asymptomatic and ATL donors, and variants common to
the two macaques), suggestive of a robust selectivity conferred in vivo by these mutations (see legend to Figure 1).
