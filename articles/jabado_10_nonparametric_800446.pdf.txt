Abstract
Background: The analysis of oligonucleotide microarray data in pathogen surveillance and discovery is a challenging
task. Target template concentration, nucleic acid integrity, and host nucleic acid composition can each have a
profound effect on signal distribution. Exploratory analysis of fluorescent signal distribution in clinical samples has
revealed deviations from normality, suggesting that distribution-free approaches should be applied.
Results: Positive predictive value and false positive rates were examined to assess the utility of three well-established
nonparametric methods for the analysis of viral array hybridization data: (1) Mann-Whitney U, (2) the Spearman
correlation coefficient and (3) the chi-square test. Of the three tests, the chi-square proved most useful.
Conclusions: The acceptance of microarray use for routine clinical diagnostics will require that the technology be
accompanied by simple yet reliable analytic methods. We report that our implementation of the chi-square test
yielded a combination of low false positive rates and a high degree of predictive accuracy.
Background
Improvements in microarray fabrication and scanning
technologies have enabled the production of high-density
arrays that can facilitate the detection of all viral isolates,
even those belonging to large, diverse families. Methods
have been developed to identify conserved nucleic acid
regions that are common to larger groupings (lineages,
serogroups, genera, or families), thereby minimizing the
number of probes required and increasing the chance of
detecting novel viruses. The more recent strategies for
achieving this include (i) using pairwise sequence comparisons to identify conserved sequences for probes [1-3]
as well as (ii) identifying specific regions from a multiple
sequence alignment [4-6]. Additionally, our group developed a method for designing probes within conserved
protein regions [7]. Finally, oligonucleotide tiling arrays
used in viral resequencing have been applied to both
virus detection [8-11] and viral transcript profiling [12].
Although best practices have been established for fluorescent signal analysis in expression profiling [13], standardization has not yet been attained for pathogen

detection arrays. While low-density microarrays can be
analyzed by visual inspection [14], high-density arrays
require computational solutions. Correlation of fluorescence to a predicted hybridization signal has been used to
infer the presence of a virus [15], while a t-test based
method has also been validated with the same datasets
[16]. Other methods include semi-supervised classification using the K-nearest neighbor technique [17], an
empirical determination of signal cutoffs for tiling arrays
[18], and a likelihood metric informed by taxonomic hierarchies [19]. Resequencing arrays are able to leverage
redundancy and deep-coverage, thereby helping the scientist to infer what the viral nucleotide sequence is [10],
but whether highly divergent strains of viruses can be
correctly annotated by this method is unclear.
Pathogen microarray data is noisy; viral signatures can
be masked by cross-hybridizing host transcripts, biased
template amplification, imperfectly matching probes or
as the result of different probe sensitivities. Additionally,
only a small proportion of probes are likely to hybridize if
virus is present in a sample, leading to distributions with
high variance. Nonparametric tests transform data into
rank order or categories; this has the effect of rescaling
variance and simplifying the distribution to one more
easily modeled. If data variance is high or the distribution

is heavily skewed, nonparametric tests are more conservative than equivalent parametric tests. What is more,
nonparametric tests are valid with small sample sizes
(less than 20); this is an advantage in cases where the
presence of a virus is being investigated by a small number of probes. Nonparametric methods such as the Mann
Whitney U test have been applied in detecting differential
gene expression of by microarrays [20].
We compared the ability of three specific nonparametric statistical tests to predict the presence of viral agents
in a hybridization experiment The three tests were (1) the
Mann-Whitney U, a test of central tendency; (2) the
Spearman rank correlation coefficient, a measure of the
relation between two variables; and (3) the chi-square, a
test of event probability based on the binomial distribution. Along with negative controls, nine viral isolates
from different families were hybridized; the isolates had
genome sizes ranging from 7 to 156 kilobases. Type I
errors that can result from multiple testing were controlled by using the method created by J.D. Storey [21].
Positive predictive value and false positive rates were
used to assess the ability of the three different statistical
methods to identify viruses.

Methods
Reference array design and hybridization

Microarrays were fabricated wherein probes were synthesized in situ (at Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara,
CA) in two orientations: plus (coding sense) and minus
(non-coding antisense, the reverse complement); all
probes were covalently anchored at the 3' end [7]. For
testing purposes, a microarray was fabricated wherein
8,553 probes were deposited in both orientations and in
duplicate (GreeneChip Pilot: 38,546 total probes, barcode
25161471, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Platform
GPL10319, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo). Another
microarray was fabricated with a larger number of virus
specific probes deposited in both orientations but singly
(GreeneChip 1.52RC: 31,771 total probes, barcode

25177711, GEO Platform GPL10320). Negative control
probes were generated from 1,500 randomly-chosen
shuffled viral probe sequences. These probes used the
same proportion of nucleotides as the viral probes, but
were not homologous to any known sequences. All
probes were randomly positioned on the array.
To approximate clinical sample contexts yet allow for
examination of a wide range of viral targets, hybridization
experiments were conducted in which known concentrations of WNV viral extract were spiked into reactions
containing either 10 or 200 nanograms (ng) of human
lung tissue RNA (data available in GEO Series GSE21317;
see summary of data availability in additional file 1).
We employed viruses that varied in genome type and
length to assess the sensitivity and specificity of three
methods for statistically analyzing viral microarray data.
The data pool included three single-stranded positive
sense RNA viruses: West Nile virus (WNV, strain New
York 1999, AF202541, ca 11 kb), SARS coronavirus
(HCoV-SARS, strain Tor2, AY274119, ca 30 kb), and
human echovirus 18 (EV18, strain Metcalf, ATCC VR-48,
AF317694, ca 7.4 kb); two segmented single-stranded
negative sense RNA viruses: Lassa virus (LASV, strain
Josiah, ca 3.4 kb and 7.3 kb) and influenza A virus H1N1
(FLUA H1N1; A/Texas/36/91, CY009316-CY009323, 8
segments of ca 2.3, 2.3, 2.2, 1.7, 1.5, 1.4,1 and 0.9 kb); two
non-segmented single-stranded negative sense RNA
viruses: Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV, NC_002549, ca 19 kb)
and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, Indiana strain,
NC_001560, ca 11.1 kb); and two double-stranded DNA
viruses: human adenovirus 4 (HAdV-4, ATCC VR-1572,
NC_003266, ca 36 kb) and human herpesvirus 1 (HSV-1,
viral culture, NC_001806, ca 152 kb) (see Table 1; data
available in GEO Series GSE21318 and Additional File 2).
After both random amplification and dendrimer labeling [22,23] were completed, the arrays were visualized
with an Agilent slide scanner. SPSS version 16 http://
www.spss.com was used for statistical analysis and data
plotting.

Computation of probe-target characteristics

A database of probe-virus target homologies was created
for use in our analysis algorithms. The EMBL viral nucleotide sequence database [24] was filtered for short HIV-1
sequences and combined with the NCBI viral referencesequence database [25]. A non-redundant database of
74,044 sequences was generated with CD-Hit [26], using
a similarity cutoff of 98% to define sequences as identical.
All probe sequences were compared to the non-redundant set of viral sequences; the number and position of
any mismatches was stored for each probe-virus target
pair. Change in Gibbs free energy (ÎG) at 65Â°C (hybridization temperature) was calculated as a measure of
probe-target binding strength [7], a table of values is
available in GEO Series GSE21319. The ÎG of probereverse complement hybrids was also calculated; probes
with higher GC content had a greater ÎG. A Lowess fit of
probe-reverse complement ÎG and the fluorescent signal
was computed for all hybridizations and used to correct
for sequence composition [27].
Closely related viruses may have indistinguishable
hybridization profiles (e.g., the intensity of signal from
probes will have the same values). We identified a set of
viral sequence records likely to be distinguishable by the
array. Using the ÎG values, we computed an in silico
hybridization profile and used it to compute distances
[28]. A cut-off of -32 kJ was used to determine whether a
probe was likely to hybridize. In silico hybridization profiles that differed by less than 6 probes were consolidated.
Cross validation with a public dataset

To assess the applicability of our analytic method to
another pathogen microarray platform, we used the EPredict training set [15] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo/ accessions GSM40806 to GSM40861 inclusive). The
dataset was comprised of 56 ViroChip microarray hybridizations of viral samples previously characterized by
direct immunofluorescence. The viruses represented
were human papillomavirus 18 (15 samples derived from
HeLa cells), influenza A virus (8 samples derived from
nasal lavage), hepatitis B (1 sample derived from serum),
respiratory syncytial virus (10 samples derived from nasal
lavage) and human rhinovirus (22 samples derived from
viral culture in cell lines). One clinical isolate of influenza
A virus also contained a respiratory syncytial virus
(GSM40845). The array was comprised of 12,505 probes;
the 265 probes excluded from the E-Predict analysis were
also excluded from this study.
Statistical tests and implementation

Three well-known statistical tests were used to evaluate
the presence or absence of viruses in our hybridization
experiments (see Additional File 3, Figure S1). A set of
negative control probes was used as a reference. Probe

pairs for both the plus (coding sense) and minus (noncoding antisense) orientations were present on the array.
We assessed the relative utility of probe pairings by performing statistical tests using the plus strand alone and
the minus strand alone, and by pooling the pairs together.
Permutation tests were performed when needed to determine significance. Programs for statistical computation
were written either in Perl or with modules from the R
Project for statistical computing http://www.r-project.org.
Mann-Whitney U Test

T-tests and ANOVA tests are the most common form of
statistical tests in microarray analysis literature [29], and
have been successfully applied to pathogen arrays [16].
The Mann-Whitney U test (also called the "Wilcoxon
rank-sum test") is the nonparametric analogue of the Student's t-test. By using ranked data, it assesses whether
two groups of samples are drawn from the same distribution.
In our experimental application, the signals of viral
probes that targeted a single strain were compared to an
equal number of negative control probes. If a virus was
targeted by less than 10 probes, negative control probes
were supplemented to achieve an n of 20. The null
hypothesis (H0) was that virus specific probes and negative control probes had the same central tendency (e.g.,
they were drawn from the same population). In each
instance, the significance of the U statistic was computed
with the commonly-used normal approximation for large
samples [30].
Spearman correlation

Correlation is the strength of the linear relationship
between two variables. The most common method of
assessing correlation between two continuous variables is
Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient. A normal data distribution is not a requirement of the test
although equality of variance (or "homoscedasticity") is
assumed [31]. The variance assumption has been shown
to be a confounder in microarray analysis [32]; thus we
decided to use a more conservative correlation measure
that makes use of ranked data: namely, Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient.
In this application, the change in the Gibbs free energy
values of the predicted probe-virus target hybrids was
used as the independent variable, while the dependent
variable was the observed probe signal (see [7] for a
graphical example). ÎG was used to predict fluorescence
and to model surface hybridization kinetics [33,34]. An
equal number of negative control probes were pooled
with viral probes to ensure that a wide range of signals
would be examined. This was necessary to ensure that a
correlation could be computed, because a uniformly high
signal would be regarded as uncorrelated to the ÎG value.
For negative control probes, the independent variable

Jabado et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:354
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/354

was the ÎG of the predicted human ribosomal RNA
duplexes. The null hypothesis was that a fluorescent signal would not be predicted by ÎG (e.g., the signal might,
rather, be randomly distributed with respect to ÎG). One
sided p-values for correlations were computed using a
standard Student's t-distribution approximation [30].
Binomial Test

The binomial test is a subset of the X2 (chi-square)
method; it tests the probability of observing a series of
events according to an expected probability rate. An
example of this kind of test would be an assessment of the
fairness of gaming dice [30].
In this application, we "binned" the probe signals into
percentiles and then categorized them as positive or negative based on whether their computed values were
located above or below a certain threshold. Probes for a
single virus were tested against the X2 distribution in such
a way that the expected probability was equal to the probability rate of the negative control probes. The null
hypothesis was that above the threshold, there was no difference between the proportion of virus specific probes
and negative control probes. The threshold choice for the
binomial test clearly has a strong influence on the results;
our own exploratory testing of various percentile thresholds (70th, 80th, 90th, 95th and 99th) showed that the 90th
percentile generated the best performance for our needs.
All binomial tests were conducted using the 90th percentile in categorizing probes as "positive" or "negative." We
concluded that the threshold value for the test, whatever
it might be, should be considered a parameter for optimization.
Multiple test correction via the False Discovery Rate (FDR)

An issue that often arises in testing a series of null
hypotheses is the increase in the probability of the occurrence of a type I error (e.g., the rejection of H0 when it is
true). Conservative familywise correction methods such
as Bonferroni's have been applied to microarray data. An
alternative method, first described by Benjamini and
Hochberg [35] and then revised by Storey [36], involves
correcting the proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses.
Here we used Storey's method and defined its parameters, within our study, as the proportion of the viruses
identified through array hybridization that prove to be
false leads (i.e., the q-value) [21]. In a multiple hypothesis
test scenario, requiring a q value of â¤ 5% for there to be
"significance" would indicate that up to 5% of the viruses
identified as present in a sample may, in fact, have been
truly absent. In contrast, requiring a p value of â¤ 5% for
there to be "significance" indicates that up to 5% of all
truly absent viruses may be identified as present. Q-values were calculated from test p-values by using the qvalue module from the R Project contributed by Storey.

Assessment of test performance

A table of correct predictions for each hybridized virus
was created by using the NCBI Taxonomy database
(available as Additional File 4). A prediction was considered a "true positive" if either the specific virus introduced in the experiment or any other virus in the same
genus was, thereby, predicted. Q-values with a threshold
of 10% were used; and the top 250 predictions for each
method were evaluated. Species prediction could also
have been assessed, but would have been less indicative of
algorithm performance because the concept of what constitutes a viral species is not comparable between the various taxonomic families (e.g., by serology or by molecular
phylogeny). What is more, highly similar strains may be
impossible to distinguish by examining their microarray
signature, yet still be defined as different species; in contrast, viruses from different genera are more easily distinguishable.
False positive rate (FPR) and positive predictive value
(PPV) were used to assess the performance of the various
test models. PPV is a commonly used standard for diagnostic tests; it is the probability that a positive test result
will reflect the presence of a virus in the sample. PPV is
the ratio of the number of true positives to the sum of the
number of true positives and false positives; false negatives are not used in the PPV method. In our particular
application of the method, it was the ratio of the number
of statistically significant (q â¤ 0.10) and correct predictions to the sum of all the statistically significant predictions generated; predictions below the significance
threshold were ignored. PPV is a useful measure of algorithm performance because it is not sensitive to heterogeneity or misclassification in viral taxonomy; it is not
necessary to predict that all members of a genus are present in order to achieve a favorable score.

Results
Deviation from normality in fluorescence distribution

To assess the effects of variability that derive from the
concentration of viral nucleic acid and host nucleic acid
in clinical samples, we characterized the effect of a varying input of human RNA on the fluorescence distribution
of the log-transformed probe signals. While an analysis
by Giles and Kipling of Affymetrix arrays based on 25 nt
probes indicated that the fluorescence distributions of
their log-transformed probe signals were indeed close to
normal (Gaussian) [37], our experience with 60 nt probe
arrays showed strong deviations from a normal distribution. Increases in RNA input have complex effects on signal distribution: the degree of skew is increased and the
upper tail is lengthened (see Figure 1). We tested the normality of these distributions and found strong deviations
for all three experiments (using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test, where p < 0.05). Sample distributions of fluorescent

Tests for normality indicated significant deviation, with the following Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z values: (a) 41.5, (b) 14.6, (c) 12.1 (all p < 0.01).

signals deriving from virus-infected tissue-culture cell
hybridizations are available in Additional file 5, Figure S2.
The observed signal distributions included Gaussian,
highly kurtotic and bimodal; host RNA concentration can
only partially explain these differences. Other explanations include: a large proportion homologous probes on
the array increasing the upper tail, differences in amplification or labeling efficiency from sample to sample, and
differences in hybridization affinity due to guanine/cytosine proportion in viral transcripts. While more complex
methods of transformation have been described elsewhere, these have focused on improving the sensitivity of
transcript profiling measurements and, we surmised,
were unlikely to improve sensitivities in our application.
Parametric analysis of microarray data is particularly sensitive to transformations; violations of normality will lead
to a loss of power, and may result in invalid p values [38].
Reverse complement controls reduce noise

Replication of hybridization experiments can improve
specificity [39]; however, the expense incurred by processing multiple arrays or low quantities of nucleic acid in
one's clinical sample may preclude the use of this
approach. Alternative strategies that might be adopted
include the application of either replicate probes and/or
reverse complementary probes to the same array. A study
using Agilent 60 nt in-situ synthesized arrays found that
replicate probes were highly concordant [40], and useful
both in improving normalization and in identifying outlier signals [41]. Reverse complements have been used on
spotted oligonucleotide arrays for pathogens [1],
although no quantitative assessments of their advantages
have been reported up to this point. In such studies as are
mentioned above, in situ synthesized oligonucleotides are
immobilized at the 3' end. Probe-target helix stability
near the surface is likely to be reduced due to steric hindrance. Thus, probes that are mismatched to their targets

will be strongly affected by the specific mismatch position (e.g., mismatches near the 5' end will reduce the
hybridization signal more than those near the 3' end
[42]).
To identify a printing strategy that would reduce false
positive signals, we conducted pilot studies using infected
cell extracts of WNV containing 104 and 106 copies of
viral template RNA as input for the reverse transcriptase
reaction. Amplification products were hybridized on an
array containing both replicate and reverse complement
probes, while human lung RNA was used as a control. In
all experiments, replicate probe pairs were better correlated than reverse complement pairs for both WNV cognate probes and non-flavivirus probes. When WNV was
present, reverse complement probes had a higher correlation than when no WNV was present; this differential
response was stronger in probes that had the highest
degree of signal (i.e., those in the top 10th percentile) (see
Table 2 and Additional File 6, Figure S3).
Correcting for sequence composition reduces the false
positive rate

Seven negative control hybridizations and nine viral isolate hybridizations were used to compute false positive
rates (FPR) (see Table 1). The top 250 predictions for each
statistical test were evaluated. A q-value threshold of 10%
was applied; this corresponds to a condition in which 1 in
10 predictions may prove to be false. The binomial test
performed well, achieving a 2% false positive rate,
whereas the Mann-Whitney U and Spearman correlation
tests had high average FPRs (48% and 58% respectively;
see Table 3). We noticed that a strong relationship existed
between the GC content and the fluorescent signal in our
platform (see Additional file 7, Figure S4); it is worth noting that high GC content has previously been implicated
in off-target hybridization [43,44]. We applied a probe-

level correction and found that a substantial decrease in
the FPR occurred in the case of both the Mann-Whitney
U and Spearman correlation methods as a result (see
Table 3; data available in additional file 8 and additional
file 9).
Even after GC correction, a strong prediction for a
chicken endogenous retrovirus was identified from the
influenza virus hybridization by all three methods. The
virus was cultured in eggs that are likely to express the
viral transcripts, indicating that a microarray can indeed
identify co-infections.
A binomial test correctly predicts the viral genus in a
majority of cases

Statistical methods were compared for GC-corrected signals by using PPV (Positive Predictive Value), which is the
probability that a diagnostic test will correctly report the
causative agent of an illness. In clinical applications, the
identification of a viral genus is sufficient to direct other
molecular identification methods (e.g., consensus PCR)
as well as to prescribe initial clinical measures. Thus, we
measured the success of each statistical method by

whether it correctly predicted the presence of a hybridized viral isolate or any other virus within the same
genus. The precise number of times that the most statistically significant prediction proved to be correct was also
tabulated (see Table 4 for an enumeration of both measures). Statistical analysis was carried out with coding
sense probes, antisense probes, or both probe types
pooled together, as independent measures of the quantity
of viral nucleic acid. A strategy of averaging probe values
resulted in a performance similar to that of those
instances when coding sense probes alone were used.
The binomial test obtained the highest PPV of 91%
when both sense probes and antisense probes were taken
into account, while the Mann-Whitney U test also performed favorably. In contrast, the Spearman correlation
coefficient test had a substantially lower PPV of 33%. A
relaxation of the multiple-testing correction requirements resulted in an improvement in the Spearman PPV
for antisense probes to 76% but such a relaxation of correction requirements is undesirable due to the potential
rise in false positives that might result (see Additional file
10, Table S1). In two cases (those of HSV-1 and HAdV-4),

the use of both sense and antisense probes reduced the
overall PPV; however the input virus was nonetheless
correctly predicted. In another case (that of the LASV,
binomial test), the pooling of the two probe methods
resulted in detection where the virus would otherwise
have been missed.
Validation of binomial and Mann-Whitney U test
performance on the ViroChip platform

A publically available dataset from Urisman et al. (ViroChip E-Predict training set; [15]) was downloaded and
analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U and binomial tests.
The ViroChip dataset was comprised of 56 hybridizations
of samples derived from tissue culture, nasal lavage or
serum. The samples contained papillomavirus, influenza
A virus, hepatitis B virus, respiratory syncytial virus or
human rhinovirus. The ViroChip platform differs from
ours in the following ways: oligonucleotide probe length
(70 nt vs. 60nt), number of probes (~12,000 vs. ~30,000),
fabrication method (robot spotted vs. in situ synthesis),
incorporation of fluorescence (amino-allyl dUTP vs. secondary hybridization) and presence of GC-matched negative control probes. However, the ViroChip platform
does include the use of reverse complement probes and
employs a random-PCR based nucleic acid amplification
strategy that is similar to ours.
Two other methods (E-Predict [15] and DetectiV [16])
reported a high degree of predictive accuracy when they
were used to examine the same dataset. Similarly, we
report having achieved a high degree of accuracy when
using two nonparametric testing methods (binomial test
and Mann-Whitney U) together with the same parame-

ters that were used for our in-situ synthesized probe platform. We report on our performance in this instance by
relying on a simple metric: the rank of the first correct
prediction (see Table 5). The first prediction of the
Mann-Whitney U test was correct in 47% of the cases; a
correct prediction was present among the first ten predictions in 91% of the cases. The average correct prediction rank for the Mann-Whitney U test was 3.7. The
largest number of incorrect predictions were for human
herpesvirus 7 (HHV7), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6A/B)
and human herpesvirus 5 (HHV5), regardless of the sample source. The first prediction of the binomial test was
correct in 75% of the cases; a correct prediction was present among the first ten predictions in 98% of the cases.
The average correct prediction rank for the binomial test
was 1.6. As in the Mann-Whitney U results, the majority
of incorrect predictions were for HHV7. Watson et al.
reported a similar false-positive result using a t-test
method [16]. HHV7 has a seroprevelance of 85% in
humans and can be readily detected in blood, saliva and
cervical tissue [45]. The degree of prevalence suggests
that the predictions represent a true co-infection; however, validation of this would require further molecular
tests. Both the binomial and Mann-Whitney U methods
generated statistically significant predictions for an influenza virus and RSV co-infected sample.
The binominal test outperformed the Mann-Whitney
test on the ViroChip data, largely because Mann-Whitney's ranking on HHV7 was lower. The binomial test's
performance without optimization was comparable to
that of E-Predict (95% correct for first predictions, 100%
correct for the first ten) and to that of DetectiV (98% cor-

rect for first predictions, 100% correct for the first ten),
however, a binomial test does not require probe-level
weighting or assumption of normality.

Discussion
Although expression profiling and viral microarrays may
employ similar methods for printing probes and for preparing and hybridizing nucleic acids, they differ markedly
in their analytical strategy. A fundamental assumption in
expression profiling is that the majority of the various
gene transcript mRNAs are present in the sample (albeit
at different concentrations). Differential expression is
identified by computing the ratio of probe signal for a
gene in two conditions (e.g., tumor vs. normal tissue). In a
viral microarray experiment, absence of signal from all
probes is a plausible result. This may reflect any of the
following: (1) that no agent is present; (2) that an agent is
present but there are no probes for it because it is either
truly new or sufficiently different to confound hybridization; (3) that a known agent is present and that probes are
appropriate but that levels are insufficient to enable
detection.
The results presented here indicate that the quantity of
host nucleic acid used in hybridization has substantive
effects on a probe's fluorescent signal distribution that
manifest as deviations from normality. We speculate that
these deviations represent mass effects when concentrations are high enough to drive up the proportion of partially hybridized strands. Probe sequence composition
was identified as a major confounder that resulted in high
FPR. Probe signal correction by GC content improved
predictions. We tested the effect of various probe control
strategies on the FPR. A hybridization requirement for
both sense and antisense probes was more helpful in
reducing the FPR than the use of hybridization to replicate probes. An additional important negative control
was the inclusion of shuffled viral probes that enabled
examination of the effects of array-wide GC content.
A key strength of this study was its effective control of
the familywise error rate, achieved via its use of Storey's
FDR technique [36]. While this method successfully lowered the FPR, there was a mild violation in the independence assumption as some probes target multiple viruses.
Q values remain useful when p values are correlated
within blocks [21], a condition we expect to be true
within our probe-sets. Methods that explicitly address
dependence have recently been under investigation [46]
and should be incorporated in any future versions of our
method.
Nonparametric statistical methods are more conservative than equivalent parametric ones; consequently, they
are less likely to require that one reject the null hypothesis when it is false (as in the case of type II errors or false

Page 10 of 12

negatives). The variability of microarray signal distributions in our study suggested that parametric predictions
may be inaccurate; for this reason, we tested a number of
nonparametric approaches. Of the three methods that we
assessed, the binomial test was the most successful,
achieving a 91% PPV. A further development of our study
might include empirically determining a more optimal
threshold by using spike-in controls or by adding more
categories to reflect different levels of confidence (e.g.,
positive, marginal and negative). The Mann-Whitney U
test was also successful in that it predicted the presence
of nearly all agents. This result conforms with a similar
study using t-tests [16]. Yet the Mann-Whitney U assessment was sensitive to sequence composition; its PPV on
uncorrected signal data was only 48%.
The Spearman correlation performed poorly, correctly
predicting only three disease agents. A Pearson correlation method (E-Predict) has been successfully applied to
pathogen arrays, according to Urisman et al. [15]. The Epredict method performs an in silico hybridization
between fully sequenced viral genomes and a viral array.
After a clinical sample is hybridized, the predicted fluorescence for each virus is compared to the observed signal. The strength of correlation is used to identify which
virus, if any, is responsible for the signal pattern. In our
study and in Urisman's, the Spearman correlation performed poorly. We re-explored this result by relaxing the
requirement for a multiple testing correction and found
that it improved the degree of predictive accuracy, but the
Spearman assessment still did not perform as well as the
other tests (see Additional file 10, Table S1). Accordingly,
we concluded that the Spearman correlation as implemented was not as discriminative as other nonparametric
tests.

Conclusion
We report the successful application of two nonparametric tests that require few assumptions that have a high
degree of predictive accuracy and have extremely low
false positive rates. In a direct assessment of the binomial
and Mann-Whitney U tests on a related pathogen
microarray platform, the binomial test performed comparably to other reported methods (e.g., E-Predict [15]
and DetectiV [16]). In contrast to these methods, the
binomial test achieved a high degree of predictive accuracy on ranked data without probe-specific weighting
parameters, iterative analysis or assumptions of normality.
