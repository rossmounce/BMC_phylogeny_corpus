Abstract
Background: Chromosomal replication is the central event in the bacterial cell cycle.
Identification of replication origins (oriCs) is necessary for almost all newly sequenced bacterial
genomes. Given the increasing pace of genome sequencing, the current available software for
predicting oriCs, however, still leaves much to be desired. Therefore, the increasing availability of
genome sequences calls for improved software to identify oriCs in newly sequenced and
unannotated bacterial genomes.
Results: We have developed Ori-Finder, an online system for finding oriCs in bacterial genomes
based on an integrated method comprising the analysis of base composition asymmetry using the
Z-curve method, distribution of DnaA boxes, and the occurrence of genes frequently close to oriCs.
The program can also deal with unannotated genome sequences by integrating the gene-finding
program ZCURVE 1.02. Output of the predicted results is exported to an HTML report, which
offers convenient views on the results in both graphical and tabular formats.
Conclusion: A web-based system to predict replication origins of bacterial genomes has been
presented here. Based on this system, oriC regions have been predicted for the bacterial genomes
available in GenBank currently. It is hoped that Ori-Finder will become a useful tool for the
identification and analysis of oriCs in both bacterial and archaeal genomes.

Background
With the increasing availability of complete genome
sequences, it has become clear that an essential factor
influencing bacterial proliferation is the organization of
the oriC region. In bacteria, chromosome replication initiates at a single chromosome locus, called the replication
origin (oriC), from which replication proceeds bidirectionally to the terminus. At the beginning of replication,
ATP binds DnaA, resulting in a large oligomeric complex
consisting of DnaA monomers bound to a series of 9-mer
consensus elements termed DnaA boxes [1]. As a general
rule, bacterial chromosomes are characterized by one

bidirectional origin of replication and one terminus that
define the boundaries of replichores [2]. The replication
process is asymmetric with respect to the two DNA strands
from the fact that the leading strand is synthesized continuously, whereas the lagging strand is synthesized as Okazaki fragments. DNA strand asymmetry can also be
described in terms of gene content and nucleotide composition. Moreover, all rRNA genes, the majority of ribosomal protein coding genes and essential genes are mainly
transcribed in the same direction as DNA replication
(leading strand) [2]. Therefore, identifying the oriCs of
bacteria is one of the key steps not only in understanding

the mechanisms of bacterial replication but also in gaining insight into gene distribution and function of these
bacterial genomes.

plemented with the language of C++. The output graphs
are generated by gnuplot graphic routine [9].
The software kit consists of the following programs.

The pioneer work to identify oriCs in silico is the GC-skew
analysis, which is deemed as a routine method [3,4].
Based on the GC-skew analysis, Frank and Lobry also
developed Oriloc, a program for predicting bacterial oriCs
[5]. Meanwhile, an oligomer-skew method was also proposed to predict oriC regions in bacterial genomes [6], and
later used to identify oriCs in 200 bacterial or/and
archaeal genomes [7]. Use of GC-skew analysis together
with location of the dnaA gene and distribution of DnaA
boxes led to more accurate prediction of oriC regions [8].

(1) The program to calculate the coordinates of the RY,
MK, GC and AT disparity curves [10].
(2) The program to calculate the distribution of DnaA
boxes for the input genome sequence.
(3) The program to assign and rank the priority of every
intergenic sequence.
(4) The gene-finding program ZCURVE 1.02 [11].

Identification of oriCs is necessary for almost all newly
sequenced bacterial genomes. Given the increasing pace
of genome sequencing, the currently available software
for predicting oriCs, however, still leaves much room to be
improved. For instance, 1) Most, if not all, available software only predicts one approximate position instead of
the boundaries of oriCs. Since the oriC is an intergenic
region rather than one site, it is necessary to present oriC
regions with definite boundaries. 2) Most software does
not provide the distribution of species-specific DnaA
boxes, which are strong indicators of oriCs. 3) No automated web server is available so far, e.g., Oriloc, in which
the program can be downloaded and run locally by users.
Web-based tools are more convenient, since they are platform independent and there is no need to download and
install the software. 4) Only the GC-skew and/or AT-skew
are provided. In addition to G/C and A/T bases, R/Y and
M/K bases can also show asymmetrical distributions
around oriCs. It is more informative to show all the base
composition asymmetries than using GC and/or AT-skews
alone.
To identify oriC regions of unannotated bacterial
genomes, we have developed an online tool, Ori-Finder,
based on an integrated method comprising gene identification, analysis of base composition asymmetry using the
Z-curve method, distribution of DnaA boxes, occurrence
of genes frequently close to oriCs and phylogenetic relationships. Output results that contain detailed information of predicted oriCs, DnaA box distributions, base
composition disparity curves, and coordinates of identified genes by ZCURVE 1.02, are exported to an HTML
report, which offers convenient views in both graphical
and tabular formats.

(5) The Perl script integrating the above programs into
one system.
Input to sever
Ori-Finder has a user-friendly and intuitive input interface. Users can choose to paste the sequence into the input
box or upload the sequence (FASTA format) in a file.
Additionally, the server requires the specification of some
optional parameters listed as follows.

(1) Select 'species-specific' DnaA boxes according to the
species. It defaults to the Escherichia coli perfect DnaA box
(TTATCCACA). In addition, 'species-specific' DnaA boxes
have also been provided, and some of them are proposed
based on the phylogenetic relationships, which have not
been reported previously, such as 'TTTTCCACA' for
Chlamydiae, 'TTATCGAAA' for Dehalococcoides and 'TGTTTCACG' for Bradyrhizobiaceae etc. For example, the motif
'TGTTTCACG' is proposed to server as DnaA boxes for the
genomes of the family Bradyrhizobiaceae (including Rhodopseudomonas, Nitrobacter and Bradyrhizobium). Currently, ten genomes of Bradyrhizobiaceae have been fully
sequenced. Note that the predicted oriC regions of them
are all closely next to gidA gene as well as the switch of GC
disparity curve, and all contain the palindromic sequence
'TGTTTCACGTGAAACA', which is composed of two proposed DnaA boxes 'TGTTTCACG'. Consequently, the 'species-specific' DnaA boxes proposed by us are consistent
with the phylogenetic relationships. Users can also choose
to search for the DnaA boxes defined themselves. By
default, only nonamers differing in no more than one
position from the selected DnaA boxes are scanned, but
this can be changed according to the requirements of
users.

Implementation
The web server Ori-Finder is implemented on Apache
server and the web interface is designed using CGI (Common Gateway Interface) Perl scripts. The algorithms to
predict oriC regions of bacterial genomes in silico are com-

(2) Whether to upload a protein table file (".ptt" file) containing the coordinates of genes in the input genome
sequence. The ".ptt" file is a table of protein features,
which is usually provided by GenBank in NCBI's RefSeq

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:79

ftp site [12]. Users can choose to download the ".ptt" file
provided by GenBank or produce their own genome
annotation that has the same format as the ".ptt" file
according to their requirements. For Ori-Finder, if no
".ptt" file is uploaded, the gene-finding program ZCURVE
1.02 will be called to generate the gene list. In general,
ZCURVE 1.02 or other gene-finding software alone
couldn't annotate gene function. To obtain the ".ptt" file
with annotation of genes related to oriCs, a database of
indicator genes (such as dnaA, dnaN, hemE, gidA etc) has
been collected by us, and BLAST program has also been
installed locally for users' convenience (click 'Database'
on the home page for more detail). Therefore, users can
Blast the query sequences and find the homologues of
these genes in the sequences.
(3) Whether to display RY, MK, GC or AT disparity curves
and the DnaA box distribution in the output graphs. It
defaults to displaying all of them in the output graphs.
Output from the sever
The output web page shows the process of Ori-Finder, and
provides links to the output results by Ori-Finder: (i) the
genome size, GC content, location, length, DnaA box
number, the motif of DnaA boxes, the conserved genes
adjacent to the predicted oriCs, the precise coordinates of
extremes of the four disparity curves and the sequence of
identified oriC regions as an HTML table; (ii) the DnaA
box distribution and the coordinates of the four disparity
curves as text files; (iii) the integrated plot for the original
sequence and (iv) that for the rotated sequence to display
the obtained results, such as general genome information,
the four disparity curves, distribution of DnaA boxes,
locations of indicator genes and oriC regions in PNG format. A typical example of the output results obtained by
Ori-Finder is shown in Figure 1. If no ".ptt" file is
uploaded, the gene list file generated by ZCURVE1.02 will
also be outputted. Users can do a Blast search using each
output result by Ori-Finder against DoriC, a database of
oriC regions [13], to confirm the reliability of the prediction. Refer to Figure 2 for the complete procedure of OriFinder to identify oriC regions. The output results by OriFinder for the newly sequenced genomes in GenBank are
also available at our website.

Results
Based on this online system, we have predicted oriC
regions for the bacterial genomes available in GenBank
currently. To estimate the accuracy of the predicted oriCs
by Ori-Finder, a simple and straight way is to compare the
predicted oriCs with those confirmed by experimental
data. Consequently, the experimental confirmed oriCs so
far are in accordance with those predicted by Ori-Finder
[13]. In addition, other lines of evidence from oriC types,
the coherence of all the three methods (i.e., typical base

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/79

composition asymmetry, DnaA box distribution and indicator genes positions), and comparative genomic analysis,
have shown the high reliability of the predicted oriCs by
Ori-Finder.
In what follows we will discuss the unique merits of the
present method, showing the evidence why this method is
superior to other methods currently available. First of all,
the in silico methods currently available to identify oriCs
include the GC-skew analysis, and the oligomer-skew
method etc. Jointly using the three methods (GC-skew,
location of the dnaA gene and distribution of DnaA
boxes) resulted in better prediction of oriC regions by
Mackiewicz et al [8]. Although DnaA and its binding sites
are well conserved throughout the bacterial kingdom, replication origins from different species show considerable
diversity in terms of the number, arrangement and even
the consensus sequence of DnaA boxes. In addition, genes
adjacent to oriCs include not only dnaA gene itself but also
dnaN, hemE, gidA or hemB etc. The information mentioned above has all been taken into consideration by the
present approach, such as 'species-specific' DnaA boxes,
possible genes adjacent to oriCs and phylogenetic relationships. However, by analyzing the GC-skew, Blasting
for the dnaA gene and searching for DnaA boxes, the oriCs
for only ~60% of genomes can be predicted. For example,
the oriCs were identified for only 76 chromosomes out of
the 120 chromosomes (76/120 = 63.3%) [8], which has
also been confirmed again by our result for 568 chromosomes available currently in GenBank. Out of the 568
chromosomes, there are only 342 chromosomes (342/
568 = 60.2%) whose oriCs are adjacent to dnaA gene and
near the switch of GC-skew. Second, the present work can
find oriC regions with definite boundaries with the accuracy of single base pair. Consequently, the integrated
method presented in this paper outperforms those jointly
applying the three methods mentioned above, as reflected
by the fact that using the integrated method, the oriC
regions can be identified for over 98% chromosomes out
of the 568 bacterial chromosomes analyzed. For example,
the genome of Synechococcus sp. JA-3-3Ab (NC_007775)
does not exhibit any typical GC skew pattern. Therefore,
based on the location of the dnaA gene, the origin is tentatively assigned to the rpmH-dnaA intergenic region [14].
However, in the family of Synechococcus genomes the oriC
regions are closely adjacent to dnaN gene rather than dnaA
gene and the DnaA box motif is 'TTTTCCACA' rather than
'TTATCCACA'. Here, by taking the above information into
account, the oriC of Synechococcus sp. JA-3-3Ab can be easily predicted by Ori-Finder. For another example, applying the methods based on GC-skew, dnaA gene location
and E. coli perfect DnaA box distribution to the genome of
Synechococcus sp. WH 8102 (NC_005070), each of the
three methods identifies a different region, respectively
[8]. Consequently, none oriC can be identified for this

Note that the coordinate origin of the rotated sequence begins and ends in the maximum of the GC disparity curve.

rently using the integrated method presented here,
whereas ~40% of 568 genomes cannot be solved using
only the information of GC-skew, location of the dnaA
gene and distribution of DnaA boxes. However, for the
chromosomes whose oriCs remain unresolved by OriFinder, the distribution of DnaA boxes and the extremes
of GC (AT, RY and MK) disparity curves are still provided
by Ori-Finder, which are helpful to obtain the approximate position of oriC region.
For the convenience of users' query, the predicted oriC
regions have been organized into a MySQL database,
called DoriC, which is freely available online [15].

Conclusion
With the availability of an increasing number of bacterial
genomes, the prediction will be more accurate and reliable since the DnaA boxes or genes frequently close to oriCs
can be analyzed by comparative genomics. Currently, the
web server Ori-Finder is designed only for the identification of oriCs in bacterial genomes. However, the architecture of the system is also suitable for archaeal genomes by
changing DnaA box into ORB (origin recognition boxes)
elements. The current version contains an input option by
which users can define their own DnaA boxes or ORB elements. It is hoped that Ori-Finder will become a useful
tool for the identification and analysis of oriCs in both
bacterial and archaeal genomes.

been identified by the integrated method Ori-Finder.
Finally, we should point out the limitation of the present
method. Note that the replication origins from different
species show considerable diversity and sometimes annotation mistakes affect the performance. Therefore, the
present method couldn't solve the problem of identifying
the oriC for every bacterial genome currently available, of
course, nor could other methods. Accordingly, oriCs for
only ~2% of 568 chromosomes remain unresolved cur-
