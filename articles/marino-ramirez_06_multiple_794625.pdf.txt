Background: Core histone genes are periodically expressed along the cell cycle and peak during
S phase. Core histone gene expression is deeply evolutionarily conserved from the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae to human.

Core histone genes encode four families of proteins that package DNA into the nucleosome, which is the basic structural
unit of eukaryotic chromosomes [1]. The four core histones
are H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, and each nucleosome consists of

146 base-pairs (bp) of DNA wrapped around an octameric
core containing two copies of each histone protein. Comparative studies of core histones have revealed that their
sequences are among the most evolutionary conserved of all
eukaryotic proteins [2]. For instance, the human H4 protein

Conclusion: The dissonance between the evolutionary conservation of the core histone gene
regulatory phenotypes and the divergence of their regulatory mechanisms indicates a highly
dynamic mode of regulatory evolution. This distinct mode of regulatory evolution is probably
facilitated by a solution space for promoter sequences, in terms of functionally viable cis-regulatory
sites, that is substantially greater than that of protein sequences.

Results: We evaluated the evolutionary dynamics of the specific regulatory mechanisms that give
rise to the conserved histone regulatory phenotype. In contrast to the conservation of core histone
gene expression patterns, the core histone regulatory machinery is highly divergent between
species. There has been substantial evolutionary turnover of cis-regulatory sequence motifs along
with the transcription factors that bind them. The regulatory mechanisms employed by members
of the four core histone families are more similar within species than within gene families. The
presence of species-specific histone regulatory mechanisms is opposite to what is seen at the
protein sequence level. Core histone proteins are more similar within families, irrespective of their
species of origin, than between families, which is consistent with the shared common ancestry of
the members of individual histone families. Structure and sequence comparisons between histone
families reveal that H2A and H2B form one related group whereas H3 and H4 form a distinct group,
which is consistent with the nucleosome assembly dynamics.

(NP_003539) is 92% identical to its yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae ortholog (NP_014368) [3]. The high levels of core
histone sequence conservation are thought to be due to severe
structural constraints imposed by their assembly into the histone octamer [4] as well as the similar functional constraints
across species associated with the compact binding of DNA
[5].
Most of the packaging of genomic DNA by core histones
occurs primarily during the S phase of the cell cycle, when
DNA is being actively replicated; stoichiometrically appropriate levels of histone proteins are required to bind DNA immediately following replication [6]. As such, the expression of
core histone genes is tightly regulated and peaks sharply during S phase [7]. Much like the histone sequences, this histone
gene expression pattern is highly conserved among eukaryotes ranging from human to the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe [8-13].
The mechanisms that underlie the cell cycle specific regulation of core histone genes have been intensively studied [6,7].
Although most of this work has focused on the regulation of
transcription via the interaction of cis-regulatory elements
and transcription factors, a number of studies have also
addressed the role of post-transcriptional regulation of core
histone synthesis. Here, we focus exclusively on the regulation of core histone gene expression at the transcriptional
level. Numerous studies have characterized core histone cisregulatory sites and their cognate transcription factors [7,1423]. Sequence logos representing 14 experimentally verified
cis-regulatory motifs, along with the names of the transcription factors that bind them, are shown in Figure 1.
The studies that resulted in the characterization of these
motifs and transcription factors have led to the elucidation of
core histone gene regulation in model experimental systems
such as S. cerevisiae. For example, the yeast transcription factor Spt10p was recently demonstrated to activate core histone
gene expression [16]. Interestingly, the SPT10 gene was originally identified as a suppressor of Ty insertion mutations
[24,25] and as a global regulator of core promoter activity
[26]. However, despite the fact that Spt10p affects the expression of hundreds of yeast genes, it specifically binds cis-regulatory sequences, referred to as upstream activating elements,
which are found only in core histone gene promoters. Thus,
the global regulatory properties of Spt10p are based solely on
changes in levels of core histone gene expression. In support
of this model of histone gene regulation, the DNA-binding
domain of Spt10p was recently characterized and shown to
mediate sequence-specific interaction with the core histone

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/12/R122

gene upstream activating element [27]. There are a number of
such examples, from S. cerevisiae and other model systems,
of efforts to characterize experimentally the mechanisms of
core histone gene regulation. In addition, efforts are underway to investigate core histone promoters among different
species computationally [28].
Despite the substantial body of knowledge on the regulation
of core histone genes, little is known about the evolutionary
dynamics that have given rise to these regulatory mechanisms. We present here an evolutionary analysis of core histone gene regulatory mechanisms. The emphasis of this work
is placed on understanding the evolution of cis-regulatory
sites along with their cognate transcription factors. We analyzed the phyletic distributions of 14 experimentally verified
core histone cis-regulatory elements among 24 crown group
eukaryotes. The evolution of core histone gene cis-regulatory
sites and transcription factors is considered in light of core
histone protein sequence and structure evolution. Despite the
highly conserved core histone sequences and expression patterns, the mechanisms of histone gene regulation were found
to be highly divergent and lineage specific. The implications
of this dissonance with respect to the evolution of gene regulatory systems are explored.

Results and discussion
Gene expression patterns
The expression of core histone genes is tightly regulated during the cell cycle and peaks specifically during S phase, concomitant with DNA replication (Figure 2). This is thought to
be due to the requirement for histone proteins to bind DNA
immediately after its synthesis. A number of recent studies
have revealed the extent to which this S phase specific pattern
of core histone gene expression is conserved among eukaryotic species; the histone expression pattern has been demonstrated for human core histone genes as well as for histones
from S. cerevisiae and S. pombe [8-13]. This highly conserved
regulatory phenotype (the expression pattern) is consistent
with the deep conservation of histone protein sequences and
further underscores the strong functional (selective) constraint that histone genes are subject to. Considering the
highly conserved regulatory phenotype of core histone genes,
it would seem to follow that their regulatory mechanisms are
similarly conserved.

Lineage-specific cis-regulatory mechanisms
Contrary to the expectation that core histone genes would
have conserved regulatory mechanisms across species, the
best studied core histone genes - namely human and S. cere-

visiae (yeast) - have different promoter architectures; in fact,
they are regulated quite differently [7]. The human and yeast
core histone promoters, many of which are bidirectional, are
illustrated in Figure 3. Human core histone gene promoters
contain more known cis-regulatory binding sites, relative to
yeast promoters, which is consistent with the involvement of
more transcription factors and the greater complexity of
human histone gene regulation. Out of the 14 experimentally
characterized cis-regulatory sites that are known to be
involved in histone gene regulation in the two species, only
one site, the TBP/TATA box, is shared between the two species (Table 1). Furthermore, the phyletic distributions (the
presence/absence among species) of the trans-regulatory

binding proteins that interact with these sites tend to be lineage specific (Table 2).
In order to evaluate the evolution of core histone promoter
cis-regulatory sites in more detail, the phyletic distribution of
all 14 experimentally characterized DNA binding motifs
among 24 crown group eukaryotic species was assessed. To
do this, position frequency matrices (PFMs) of the cis-regulatory motifs (Figure 1) were taken from the TRANSFAC database [29] or were generated from the binding site alignments
reported in the original citation. Intergenic promoter regions
of core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) for all 24 species
were then searched for the presence of the 14 cis-regulatory

sequences (Figure 4). Surprisingly, when histone promoter
sequences are related in this way, they tend to form clusters
that are relatively lineage specific with respect to the species
from which they are derived rather than their family of origin.
For instance, there are fairly well defined clusters of histone
promoters that are fungi specific and others that are metazoan specific (see red blocks in Figure 4). Importantly, these
distinct clusters contain promoters from all four histone gene
families. In general, histone promoter sequences from different families are completely intermixed on the tree (they do
not tend to group into gene family specific clusters). This suggests that some core histone promoter regions may be evolv-

ing in concert within evolutionary lineages, perhaps due to
similar lineage-specific regulatory constraints.
The lineage-specific nature of core histone promoter
sequence evolution was further explored by generating a
species distance matrix analogous to the sequence distance
matrix described above. For the species distance matrix,
CLOVER scores were calculated for sets of all promoter
sequences from individual species. Species-specific CLOVER
vectors calculated in this way were compared using r value
distances, and the resulting distance matrices were used to
compute a neighbor joining tree (Figure 5a). As a control, the
same comparison was done using promoter sequences that
were randomly permuted with preservation of their monoand dinucleotide frequencies (Figure 5b). Although the topology of the control tree shows no relationship to the species
phylogeny, the topology of the tree generated from the
observed data is in general agreement with the species phylogeny and thus underscores the within-species coherence of
the core histone promoter cis-regulatory motifs. There are,
however, some interesting exceptions to this trend. For example, S. pombe and Aspergillus nidulans are found in a cluster
that includes Drosophila mojavensis; in addtition, Arabidopsis thaliana is nested close to vertebrates as opposed to being
an outgroup to the entire ensemble, as would be expected.

Motif evolutionary dynamics
Further examination of the cis-regulatory motif distribution
within the yeast group of species (order Saccharomycetales)
shows that different combinations of motifs have distinct evolutionary trajectories, suggesting lineage-specific mechanisms of regulation (Figure 6). For instance, Spt10p and TBP
combine to regulate core histones among all Saccharomycetales species evaluated here, whereas the NEG element

four experimentally characterized binding sites for each bidirectional promoter in S. cerevisiae (Figure 3). Accordingly,
when the relative position of Spt10p cognate sequence motifs
are evaluated among all species where they are present, they
exhibit a marked clustering in the center of the promoter

NEG and TBP are excluded from the centers of the core
histone promoters and tend to map closer to the translational
start sites (Figure 7c-f).

the distance was taken as d = 1 - zr. The resulting pair-wise
distance matrix was used to build a neighbor joining tree for
the four histone families (Figure 8a). This tree shows that
H2A and H2B form one related cluster, whereas H3 and H4
form another. Interestingly, these evolutionary relationships
are reflected in the structure (Figure 8b) and assembly
dynamics of the histone octamer [38]. H3 and H4 first form
dimers that come together as a tetramer. Meanwhile, H2A
and H2B form dimers separately and these H2A-H2B dimers
join the H3-H4 tetramer to form the octamer.

Sequence and structure evolution

A more detailed analysis of the evolutionary relationships
within and between histone protein families was performed
using a comparative analysis of the HFD. The HFD is represented in the Pfam database, and an alignment of its representative members has been used to generate a hidden
Markov model (HMM) that captures the position-specific
sequence variation characteristic of the domain. In order to
build a multiple sequence alignment that unites members of
all four families, representative members of each family from
the 24 species analyzed here were aligned in register to the
HFD-HMM. This HFD multiple sequence alignment was then
used to calculate all pair-wise distances, within and between
families, and to build a HFD phylogeny (Figure 8c). As
expected, all members within any given family are more
closely related to one another than to members of any other
family. The phylogenetic relationships within families are
largely consistent with the established taxonomic relationships of the species from which the sequences were derived.
However, the relatively high within-family sequence identities, as well as the level of resolution afforded by the betweenfamily HMM approach, do not lend themselves to robust
delineation of evolutionary relationships within families. Perhaps most germane is the fact that the between-family relationships illustrated by the HFD-HMM approach are
identical to those seen in the DALI structural comparison. It
is worth reiterating that these family-specific protein
sequence relationships are totally discordant with the largely
lineage-specific promoter sequence element relationships.

The lineage-specific pattern of core histone promoter evolution revealed by the comparative analysis of cis-regulatory
motif sequences stands in contrast to the evolution of core
histone protein sequences and structures. There are four families of core histone proteins, namely H2A, H2B, H3 and H4,
and these families are present in all eukaryotes, indicating
that they probably evolved via three ancient gene duplication
events that preceded the diversification of the eukaryotic lineage. Given this evolutionary scenario, it can be expected that
all protein sequences (structures) of a given family will be
more closely related to one another, regardless of the species
from which they are derived, than they are to members of
other families. Straightforward sequence comparison methods, such as BLASTP [33], bear this expectation out (data not
shown). In fact, although sequences within families are highly
conserved, it is not possible to identify members of different
families using pair-wise BLASTP comparisons. On the other
hand, despite its low sequence similarity among core histones, the histone fold domain (HFD) is present in all four
core histones [34,35].
In order to explore the sequence/structure relationships
within and among core histone protein families, sensitive
methods of comparison are needed. For instance, comparisons of three-dimensional protein structures [36] can often
reveal deep evolutionary relationships that are not apparent
when protein sequences alone are compared. A high-resolution structure of the Xenopus laevis nucleosome exists, and
structural comparison of the individual histone units, which
correspond to distinct histone families, was performed using
similarity scores from the DALI database [37]. The
statistically significant similarity scores observed indicate
that the signal of common ancestry among all histone families
is preserved at the structural level. For each histone variant,
its pair-wise DALI Z scores were normalized by the self-comparison of Z scores (Zij/Zii) to yield a relative Z score (Zr), and

Conclusion

We have demonstrated a striking dissonance between the
deep evolutionary conservation of core histone regulatory
phenotypes and the profound divergence of their regulatory
mechanisms. Core histone genes exhibit similar cell cycle (S
phase specific) expression patterns from the yeast S. cerevisiae to human (Figure 2). This regulatory conservation is con-

sistent with the high levels of sequence conservation among
core histone proteins. Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanisms that are used to achieve the conserved expression
patterns of core histone genes are almost entirely lineage specific. The cis-trans machinery involved in core histone gene
regulation has changed substantially between lineages
through gain and loss of transcription factor proteins and
their cognate binding sites. This suggests that, for families
like the core histone genes, phylogenetic footprinting [39]

may have limited utility for identifying functional regulatory
elements across all but the most closely related species.
In addition to the divergence of cis sites and trans factors, a
distinct level of post-transcriptional regulation of core histones emerged along the metazoan evolutionarily lineage

As an addendum, during revision of the manuscript we
became aware of a recently published paper [54], which confirms that the specific periodic pattern of core histone gene
expression is uniquely evolutionarily conserved. The report
by Jensen and coworkers also demonstrates how many different regulatory solutions have evolved to control the periodic
expression of integrated biological systems that function in
the cell cycle.

refereed research

The comparative genomics of core histone gene regulation
reveal a novel evolutionary mode, which we dub 'circuitous
evolution'. Circuitous evolution of core histone gene regulation is distinct from convergent evolution, because the conservation of the core histone gene regulatory patterns
suggests that the same pattern existed in the last common
ancestor of all species analyzed here. After divergence from
the last common ancestor, the core histone expression patterns remained unchanged but the regulatory mechanisms
that give rise to the conserved phenotype diverged dramatically. Thus, with respect to core histone gene regulation,
where you are from and where you are are far more important
than how you get there.

deposited research

Even though the four core histone gene families (H2A, H2B,
H3, and H4) diverged before the species studied here, the regulatory mechanisms are more similar for different family
members within species than for the same family members
between species (Figures 4 and 5). Thus, there is a kind of
concerted regulatory evolution operating between members
of different core histone gene families. This pattern stands in
stark contrast to the pattern of core histone sequence evolution, whereby members of the same family are more similar to
one another across species reflecting their more recent common ancestry (Figure 8). This suggests that very different
modes of evolution exist for histone gene regulation versus
protein sequence and structure. The solution space for promoter sequence evolution (the space of functionally viable
cis-regulatory binding site sequences) may be far more vast
than that of core histone protein sequences. This results in a
much more dynamic evolutionary paradigm for promoter
sequences and the transcription factors proteins that bind
them. Purifying selection may be less efficacious at eliminating variants of cis-regulatory sites because a number of
sequence variants may bind transcription factors with similar
affinities. In addition, new cis-regulatory sites, which are
short and degenerate by nature, may arise relatively quickly
through mutation along the promoter. It is possible that these
new variants can lead to an exploration of expression space
and rapid fixation of adaptive variants by positive selection.
Adaptive expression changes of this type may be facilitated by
the emergence of intermediate redundant regulatory
programs that maintain the ancestral expression pattern and

It is currently unclear whether the turnover of regulatory
mechanisms, in the face of conserved expression patterns, is
unique to core histones or also occurs for other gene families.
Some studies on the evolution of gene regulation do report
evidence of conserved regulatory sequences and expression
patterns [47,48], whereas others indicate that gene regulatory networks do in fact diverge rapidly [49-51]. However,
regulatory divergence usually leads to distinct expression patterns [51-53]. Interestingly, although yeast core histone
transcripts include polyA tails, core histone transcripts are
unique among metazoan transcripts in that they lack polyA
tails. The absence of polyA tails, which are often bound by
poly(A)-binding proteins to promote translation initiation,
may necessitate, to some extent, species-specific solutions to
core histone gene regulation.

reports

There are additional regulatory elements that may help to
achieve coordinated regulation of core histone genes in metazoans. For instance, a sequence found in core histone gene
encoding regions is important for their expression and may
serve as an internal promoter element common to the
mammalian lineage [41-43]. In addition, the transcription
factor NPAT has been implicated as a global regulator of core
histone gene expression among metazoans even though it
does not seem to bind any DNA sequence directly [44-46].
This may provide yet another global lineage specific regulatory mechanism that distinguishes the metazoan mode of
core histone gene regulation from that of yeast.

function while simultaneously allowing for selective testing of
novel expression patterns [47]. Such an evolutionary mode,
with less pronounced purifying and more prominent adaptive
selection, could explain the observation that novel cis-trans
combinations are subject to substantial turnover and may be
regularly reinvented among evolutionary lineages. In
addition, the inherent evolutionary flexibility of regulatory
systems may allow for coordinated within-species changes
that respond to epistatic pressure from other regulatory pathways in the same lineage that share transcription factors.

reviews

sible for 70% of the upregulation of core histones in S phase.
The sequence that forms the stem loop is conserved across
metazoans (Figure 9b). The emergence of this mechanism
may have allowed for some of the turnover of the cis-trans
regulatory machinery among metazoan genomes subsequent
to their divergence from the yeast evolutionary lineage.

alignments reported in the original citation. The PFMs were
used with the program CLOVER [30] to search the core histone promoter regions for the presence of the cis-regulatory
motifs. The complete set of CLOVER predictions is provided
in Additional data file 4. CLOVER output was used to construct promoter-specific vectors composed of scores of overrepresented and/or under-represented cis sites for each
sequence; the vectors were then used to compare promoter
sequences with pair-wise Pearson correlation coefficients.
CLOVER also gives the position of each predicted motif and
these positions were normalized by the length of the promoter sequence to give the relative lengths shown in Figure 7
panels a, c and e. Locations were randomly sampled from a
uniform distribution in order to generate the negative control
plots shown in Figure 7 panels b, d and f.

nomenclature reported by Marzluff and coworkers [56] was
used for the human and mouse core histone genes.
