Abstract
Background: North American Agalinis Raf. species represent a taxonomically challenging group
and there have been extensive historical revisions at the species, section, and subsection levels of
classification. The genus contains many rare species, including the federally listed endangered
species Agalinis acuta. In addition to evaluating the degree to which historical classifications at the
section and subsection levels are supported by molecular data sampled from 79 individuals
representing 29 Agalinis species, we assessed the monophyly of 27 species by sampling multiple
individuals representing different populations of those species. Twenty-one of these species are of
conservation concern in at least some part of their range.
Results: Phylogenetic relationships estimated using maximum likelihood analyses of seven
chloroplast DNA loci (aligned length = 11 076 base pairs (bp) and the nuclear ribosomal DNA ITS
(internal transcribed spacer) locus (733 bp); indicated no support for the historically recognized
sections except for Section Erectae. Our results suggest that North American members of the
genus comprise six major lineages, however we were not able to resolve branching order among
many of these lineages. Monophyly of 24 of the 29 sampled species was supported based on
significant branch lengths of and high bootstrap support for subtending branches. However, there
was no statistical support for the monophyly of A. acuta with respect to Agalinis tenella and Agalinis
decemloba. Although most species were supported, deeper relationships among many species
remain ambiguous.
Conclusion: The North American Agalinis species sampled form a well supported, monophyletic
group within the family Orobanchaceae relative to the outgroups sampled. Most hypotheses
regarding section- and subsection-level relationships based on morphology were not supported
and taxonomic revisions are warranted. Lack of support for monophyly of Agalinis acuta leaves the
important question regarding its taxonomic status unanswered. Lack of resolution is potentially due
to incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms among recently diverged species;
however the gene regions examined did distinguish among almost all other species in the genus.
Due to the important policy implications of this finding we are further evaluating the evolutionary
distinctiveness of A. acuta using morphological data and loci with higher mutation rates.

Background
The increase in use of molecular systematics in studies of
angiosperm evolution has resulted in numerous phylogenies describing relationships across a range of evolutionary history [1]. Studies of closely related species [2] are
particularly important for filling in the tips on the
angiosperm tree of life [3]. Phylogenetic hypotheses of the
evolutionary relationships among members of the same
genus provide frameworks for comparative research on
mechanisms of diversification and speciation [4]. These
phylogenies are also valuable resources for people concerned with conservation in that they provide a relatively
objective means of quantifying evolutionary distinctiveness and resolving taxonomic ambiguities involving rare
taxa [5-8]. It is this application to identifying lineages that
are sufficiently distinct to warrant taxonomic status and
thus are eligible for legal protection (i.e., species, subspecies, and varieties) that greatly interests us.
A basic assumption of many species concepts [e.g. [9-13]]
and operational species delimitation methods [14] is that
individuals of one species share common ancestry to the
exclusion of members of other species. This shared common ancestry, which is a logical consequence of reproductive isolation between two groups, is expected to
ultimately be reflected by genealogical exclusivity or
monophyletic relationships inferred from phylogenetic
analysis of DNA sequence or fragment data [11]. However, the rapidly accumulating phylogenies of congeneric
taxa with mismatches between gene trees and an expected
species tree [15,16] is yielding a startling picture of the
extent to which the expectation of monophyly is not met.
Such mismatches can indicate imperfect taxonomy, lack
of sufficient variation to detect differentiation, incomplete
lineage sorting of shared ancestral polymorphisms, or
contemporary hybridization or introgression. The
amount of evolutionary time required for mutations to
accumulate and for shared ancestral polymorphisms to
sort out after speciation events [17-19] can make distinguishing among recently diverged taxa quite challenging.
Coalescent theory predicts that it will take on the order of
~8.7 Ne generations for reciprocal monophyly of neutral,
biparentally inherited loci to evolve in diverging lineages
[17,20]. Thus, although the degree and duration of isolation necessary to achieve monophyly (especially across
multiple loci) guarantees the evolutionary independence
of monophyletic operational taxonomic units, absence of
evidence for such independence, however, cannot automatically be assumed to mean that two entities are not
reproductively isolated [21]. In these cases, additional evidence will be required to resolve ambiguities.
In this study, we examined phylogenetic relationships
among 29 North American Agalinis (Raf.) species. This
genus of flowering plants is restricted to the Western

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/264

Hemisphere where approximately 40 species occur in the
eastern and central United States and Canada and approximately 30 species are found in South America, Mexico,
and Central America [22-27]. Due to taxonomic uncertainties, the exact number of species in the genus is
unclear; acceptance of particular taxa varies across authors
and taxonomic revision is in progress. Historically, Agalinis was considered to be part of the family Scrophulariaceae but multiple phylogenetic analyses support
placement in the family Orobanchaceae [28-30]. This
plant family was traditionally associated with holoparasitism; however the broadened concept includes a number
of autotrophic genera, such as Agalinis, that are hemiparasitic.
The majority of North American Agalinis species grow on
the coastal plains of southern and southeastern North
America. A secondary concentration of species occurs in
the midwestern part of the continent and an even smaller
number of species extend to the piedmont and to the
coastal plains of the Mid-Atlantic, New England and the
southern reaches of the Maritime Provinces in Canada
[22-24,31,32]. Throughout this geographic range, habitats occupied by Agalinis species are typically grasslands
and savannas, grassy openings in woodlands and forests,
or other herb dominated habitats. Soil moisture requirements vary greatly across taxa, ranging from inundated
wetlands (including bogs, streams, ponds, and salt
marshes), to wetland edges, to dry uplands. Because Agalinis species thrive in relatively open sites with no or low
cover of shrubs and trees, many of them are found in early
successional habitats and are most abundant following
fire or other disturbance events. Due to overall declining
trends in grassland extent and condition resulting from
both development and lack of natural disturbance, a
number of Agalinis species are increasingly restricted to
forest edges and anthropogenically maintained openings
such as utility corridors, and road verges. Although the
more ruderal species can be extremely abundant and
widespread in these highly modified habitats, our observation indicated that some less abundant and more geographically restricted species are susceptible to mowing
during the reproductive season, insufficient disturbance
to remove woody vegetation, herbicide applications, and
invasions of aggressively competitive non-native species.
General characteristics of the genus Agalinis include membranaceous, ephemeral corollas mostly with red-purple
spots and yellow guide lines and wingless seeds that have
variously reticulate seed coats [22,23,33,34]. Beyond the
above characteristics, life form, morphology, anatomy,
and floral form and color are variable, particularly in
South American taxa. Unfortunately, relationships among
the South American taxa are poorly understood, they are
not included in any published classification schemes for

the genus, and we were unable to obtain material to
include them in this work. With exception of the perennial species A. linifolia, all North American species are
annual herbs and all but three species (A. auriculata, A.
densiflora, and A. heterophylla) have linear to filiform or
scale-like leaves. Although mating systems have not been
described for all members of the genus, the species that
have been investigated include obligate outcrossing (A.
strictifolia [35]), mixed mating (A. acuta [36], A. skinneriana [37], A. obtusifolia [38], A. decemloba [38], and A. auriculata [39]), and predominantly selfing due to cleistogamy
(A. neoscotica [40]).
The genus is taxonomically difficult and there have been
numerous revisions of species and subspecies. In addition
to taxonomic uncertainties, relationships among Agalinis
species have been enigmatic and section-level classifications have been anything but stable. Pennell [23] originally suggested five sections within the genus but later
suggested only three sections with five subsections [22].
Work based on seed, stem and leaf, and seedling characteristics as well as karyotypes [34,41-46] yielded revisions
to Pennell's classification that recognized five sections
(Erectae, Heterophyllae, Linifolieae, Purpureae, and Tenuifolieae) and three subsections within the Purpureae
(Pedunculares, Purpureae, and Setaceae). Previous phylogenetic analysis of 15 Agalinis species based on 7323
aligned bp of nucleotide sequence variation at three
cpDNA loci (rbcL, ndhF, and matK) [47] did not fully support either Pennell's or Canne-Hilliker's section-level classifications, although one section and some subsections
suggested by Canne-Hilliker appeared to represent natural
groups. Specifically, monophyly of Section Erectae was
supported but Sections Purpureae and Heterophyllae
were polyphyletic. Subsection Pedunculares was monophyletic but did not appear to be related to other Section
Purpureae taxa as had been presumed. Limited taxon sampling and relatively low cpDNA sequence variation in that
study prevented more thorough evaluation of relationships among Sections Linifoliae and Tenuifolieae and
other subsections within the Purpureae.
In the present study, we provide a more comprehensive
phylogenetic treatment of the genus by examining 29
North American Agalinis species using 7 cpDNA loci and
1 nuclear locus. Our specific objectives included simultaneously evaluating the monophyly of sections, subsections, and species that have been named solely based on
anatomy and morphology. Every polytypic section and
subsection is represented by multiple species and 27 species are represented by multiple individuals. In contrast to
traditional sampling approaches in systematics studies
that include only one representative per species [15,48],
we were able to treat species labels as testable hypotheses
[49]. The extensive sampling also provides a genus-wide

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/264

context in which to evaluate the amounts and patterns of
divergence among putative species that can be detected
using the loci we sampled. This context is particularly critical for interpreting cases in which we fail to detect differentiation.
In addition to describing the evolutionary relationships
among the sampled individuals, this study has important
implications for conservation. We sampled 21 species that
are considered imperiled (S2) or critically imperiled (S1)
in at least 1 state in which they occur; 6 of these species are
also globally vulnerable (G3 or G3–G4) and 3 are critically imperiled (G1) [Table 1; [50]]. Data on the divergence of and relationships among such a large number of
species of conservation concern can help prioritize rare
species for conservation [51,52] by estimating their degree
of uniqueness within the genus. We were specifically
interested in addressing questions regarding the taxonomic status of three sets of species whose distinctiveness
from one another and thus conservation status had previously been questioned: A. acuta and A. tenella, A. tenella
and A. obtusifolia, A. decemloba and A. obtusifolia. The status
of A. acuta has been questioned previously and Neel and
Cummings [47] found only a single nucleotide difference
between A. acuta and A. tenella across 4048 bp of cpDNA
that included rbcL and matK. Agalinis acuta occurs on the
coastal plain in eastern Massachusetts; Rhode Island; on
Long Island, New York; and in Maryland. Agalinis tenella
occurs on the coastal plain from South Carolina south to
Florida and west to Alabama [22]. Morphologically, A.
acuta is distinguished from A. tenella by having a shorter
corolla, smaller seeds, and shorter pedicels [22]. We were
interested in the other two sets of species because the current taxonomic treatment in the USDA PLANTS database
[27] suggests that A. tenella and A. decemloba are synonymous with A. obtusifolia [53]. If this taxonomic treatment
is accurate and A. acuta is also not distinguishable, combining all four taxa would be appropriate and there would
be important conservation policy consequences. As originally described, A. decemloba grows on the piedmont in
Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina [22,23].
Agalinis obtusifolia is known from collections from Maryland south to Florida and then west through Georgia to
Louisiana on both the piedmont and the coastal plain.
Clarifying the taxonomic status of A. acuta [54] is essential
because if it is not a species, subspecies, or variety it is not
eligible for listing under the U.S. Endangered Species Act
[55]. If it is synonymous with other species, the status of
A. acuta would need to be revised based on the distribution, abundances, and threats of the populations representing those other species.

Methods
Taxon sampling
A total of 79 individuals representing 29 out of the ~40
putative North American Agalinis species were included in
this study (Table 1). The sampled species represented all
North American sections and subsections and all polytypic groups were represented by more than one species.
The number of individuals per species ranged from 1–9
and when multiple individuals were used, they were from
different populations. Sample locations for most species
were selected somewhat opportunistically and often coincided with locations sampled for anatomical and morphological work by Dr. J. Canne-Hilliker. We attempted to
include samples from geographically distinct locations for
each species in order to capture the potential range of
within-species variation (Additional file 1). Samples of A.
acuta represent all geographic regions from which this
species is known, and include most extant populations
(Additional file 1). Samples of A. obtusifolia and A. tenella
were also distributed to represent the range of each species
(Additional file 1). The two A. decemloba populations were
from the north central portion of the range. One representative of each of four outgroup species was also sampled: Aureolaria pedicularia (L) Raf., Aureolaria pectinata (L)
Raf., Brachystigma wrightii (A. Gray) Pennell, and Dasistoma macrophylla (Nutt.) Raf. Fifteen of the Agalinis individuals and three of the four outgroup individuals were
the same as those used in the previous phylogenetic study
of the genus and related genera (Aureolaria pectinata is new
and Seymeria pectinata Pursh was not included) [47].
Vouchers are located at University of Guelph, University
of Maryland, Iowa State University, and University of
Texas Austin. Specific information on the location of particular specimens is available on request. We did not collect voucher specimens from the endangered A. acuta
because these populations are well documented by state
Natural Heritage Programs and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service.
DNA isolation, amplification, and sequencing
Total genomic DNA was isolated from fresh or frozen (80°C) leaves and flower buds by grinding 50–100 mg of
tissue to powder in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle, and then using GenElute Plant Genomic DNA Kits
(Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) or
Qiagen DNEasy Kits (Qiagen Corporation, Valencia, California USA) following manufacturer's instructions.

We analyzed sequences from seven chloroplast gene
regions (matK, rbcL, ndhF, trnT (UGU)-trnF (GAA), rps2,
rpoB, and psbA-trnH) and the nuclear DNA (nDNA) locus
ITS (18S-5.8S-26S). The first three cpDNA loci were used
in the previously mentioned study [47] and they represent
relatively slowly evolving portions of the chloroplast
genome. Although there is rate variation among sites

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/264

within these loci [47] that inform different levels of the
phylogeny, they are most useful for resolving more ancestral relationships. The other chloroplast loci and the
nuclear ITS locus were chosen because they have been
shown to be informative at distinguishing among recently
diverged taxa and even among populations within species
[56-58]. Our strategy was to assay rbcL and matK from at
least one individual of each species to resolve the deeper
relationships within the genus. We then attempted to
sequence the other five loci from all sampled individuals.
All but two of these loci were amplified using a single forward and reverse primer pair. The exceptions were trnTtrnF which required two PCR reactions per individual
using trnT-a/trnL-d and trnL-c/trnF-f [59]. The rps2[28]
locus was problematic for certain species but amplifications using the alternative forward primer rps2-47F,
instead of rps2-18F, were successful. Details of amplification and sequencing for rbcL and matK are given in Neel
and Cummings [47]. In previous work ndhF was extremely
difficult to amplify from a number of Agalinis species and
although we did not pursue additional ndhF sequences,
we used the ones available from Neel and Cummings [47]
in our analysis.
Despite the well documented problems with using ITS for
phylogenetic analyses, due to high copy number and difficulty optimizing PCR [e.g., [60]], we reliably obtained
sequences using two primer pairs (ITS4 and ITS5 or ITS1
and ITS4)[61]. These primers did yield multiple PCR
products and attempts to design species-specific primers
for these taxa did not sufficiently reduce the number of
copies. We therefore extracted the desired PCR product,
(identified as the brightest band nearest to the target size),
from an agarose gel using Qiagen's QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Inspection of the sequence trace curves confirmed that only a
single copy had been sequenced.
All polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were done with
Eppendorf MasterTaq PCR kits (Brinkman, Westbury,
New York, USA) on MJ Research PTC-200 Thermal
Cyclers. In general, the PCR temperature profile was 30
cycles of 94°C for 60 s, annealing temperature set approximately 5°C below the lower of the two primer melting
temperatures for 90 s, 72°C for 150 s, and a final 15 min
elongation period at 72°C. Amplified DNA fragments
were purified using the Qiagen QIAQuick PCR Purification Kit according to manufacturer's instructions, unless
noted otherwise.
Because many of the individuals and species we investigated were closely related and thus sequence variation was
likely to be low, four replicate sequencing reactions were
carried out for both forward and reverse primers for a
given locus, resulting in eight-fold coverage across most

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:264

regions of all loci. This conservative sequencing strategy
ensured accuracy and prevented erroneous base calls associated with sequencing error that can cause serious issues
when only single sequences are analyzed. Sequencing
reactions were conducted with BigDye Terminator v3.1
Cycle Sequencing chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, California, USA) with reactions set up in 96-well
microtiter plates. Total reaction volume was 7 μl (1–3 μl
DNA template, 1.5 μl 5× Sequencing Buffer, 1 μl primer
[25 μM], 0.5 μl BigDye Terminator, and 1–3 μl ddH2O).
Cycle sequencing of purified PCR product was performed
on an MJ Research PTC-200 Thermal Cycler and subsequent cleanup and preparation for sequencing was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Data analysis
The program Sequencher v4.6 (Gene Codes Corporation,
Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) was used for base calling,
quality assignments, and assembling consensus sequences
for each sample from the replicate bi-directional sequence
reads. Contigs for each locus exported from Sequencher
were aligned using the default settings of MUSCLE [62].
BioEdit [63] was used to manually edit alignments of the
cpDNA loci rps2, trnT-trnF, and psbA-trnH which had
numerous
insertions/deletions.
Alignments
were
exported as FASTA files and then converted to non-interleaved NEXUS files using MacClade v4.06 [64]. Three different data matrices were created: 1) cpDNA only, 2)
nuclear ITS sequences only, and 3) a concatenation of all
sequences.

To evaluate the variability of each locus, we calculated the
number of characters that were constant, parsimony
informative, and autapomorphic using the default parsimony settings in PAUP* [65]. We also estimated the maximum likelihood pairwise distances between sampled
individuals within and among Agalinis species for each
locus separately. Nucleotide substitution model parameters for the maximum likelihood distance measures were
chosen using MODELTEST [66]. MODELTEST evaluates
the likelihood scores of the same neighbor-joining tree for
each of the 56 nucleotide substitution models calculated
using PAUP* and the best fitting model was chosen using
Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC).
Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the program
GARLI v0.951 (Genetic Algorithm for Rapid Likelihood
Inference) [67]. GARLI performs heuristic phylogenetic
searches under the GTR + Γ + I (General Time Reversible
with Gamma distributed rate heterogeneity and a proportion of invariant sites [68,69]) nucleotide substitution
model where topologies are evaluated based on their likelihood. The program calculates the maximum likelihood
of a topology in the same manner as PAUP* but uses a
genetic algorithm [70] to more efficiently evaluate alter-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/264

native topologies. For each dataset, the best tree was
found by running GARLI on the original data matrix with
the default settings. We used likelihood ratio tests as
implemented in PAUP* to assess whether branch lengths
associated with the best topology inferred with GARLI
were significantly greater than zero. To estimate the support for each node, phylogenies were created for 1000
bootstrap replicates of each dataset. A 50% majority rule
consensus tree of the 1000 bootstrap replicates from
GARLI was then created using PAUP*. The support values
at each node on the consensus tree were added to the best
tree found by GARLI, which allowed us to display both
node support values and branch lengths.
To decrease the computational time required to complete
the bootstrap replicates we reduced the number of generations that were performed without finding a better scoring topology before a replicate was terminated from 10
000 to 5000. To complete the bootstrap analyses for the
cpDNA and all loci combined datasets in a relatively short
time we used Grid computing through The Lattice Project
[71]. The GARLI executable was converted to a Grid service such that batches of bootstrap replicates were distributed among hundreds of computers where they were
conducted asynchronously in parallel [72]. The 1000
bootstrap replicates for the smaller ITS dataset were
accomplished on a single desktop computer.
We used the approximately unbiased (AU) test [73] as
implemented in the program CONSEL [74] to evaluate
whether a tree that constrained both A. acuta and A. tenella
to be monophyletic was significantly worse than the best
tree from an unconstrained analysis using the same data
set. We repeated this test for each of the three data matrices. The AU test calculates a probability value of different
topologies from bootstrap replicates of the site-likelihoods [73]. We also used the AU test to determine the
influence of missing data on phylogenies inferred from
the cpDNA and ITS datasets and to assess the degree of
congruence between the phylogeny based on cpDNA loci
and the phylogeny based on the complete data set. It is
not possible to directly assess the incongruence between
the topologies from the concatenated cpDNA dataset and
the ITS locus because the data matrices differed in the
number of individuals. However, given that the cpDNA
dataset and the all-loci-combined dataset differed only in
the inclusion of ITS, we used the AU test to compare these
two topologies as a means to estimate the incongruence
with the cpDNA phylogeny introduced by the ITS locus.

Table 2: Summary of the cpDNA loci and the nDNA locus ITS used in this study

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:264

076 bp and the total aligned length for ITS was 733 bp
including only a few small (tri- or tetranucleotide) insertions. The aligned concatenated dataset of ITS and the 7
cpDNA loci was 11 809 bp (Table 2).
The percent of constant characters among Agalinis species
varied from 68.76% – 93.95% for ITS and ndhF respectively (Table 2). After ndhF, rbcL had the largest percentage
of constant characters (90.53%). The number of parsimony informative sites for individual loci ranged from 52
(rpoB) to 320 (trnT-trnF) (Table 2). ITS exhibited the widest range of pair-wise maximum likelihood distances
among species within the genus, ranging from 0.14% –
21.26%. The most conserved locus was rbcL with pairwise
distances among Agalinis species ranging from 0 – 3.07%
and averaging 1.07%; psbA-trnH had the largest range of
among-species pairwise maximum likelihood distance of
all the cpDNA loci, ranging from 0 – 20.50% and averaging 7.75% (Table 2).
Levels of variation we observed were similar to those
found in other phylogenetic studies of congeneric species.
The extensive length variation we observed in trnT-trnF
(shortest sequence length of 1228 bp compared to the
length of the alignment of 1868 bp) has also been
observed within the confamilial genus Pedicularis [75]. A
study of Mimulus (Phrymaceae) [2] in which only the trnLtrnF portion of trnT-trnF was sampled found a similar
degree of variability expressed as the percent of parsimony
informative characters (20.7% compared to 17.13%
observed in this study). In Lymania (Bromeliaceae) 577 of
602 (96%) bases of psbA-trnH were constant [76] compared to 669 of 884 (75.68%) constant characters within
this study. The maximum level of variation we observed at
the nuclear ITS locus (ML distance = 21.26%) is similar to
that found in other genera within the Orobanchaceae
(Pedicularis [77] and Orobanche [78]).
General phylogenetic hypotheses
The phylogenies inferred from the three data matrices differed in tree shape and support for specific relationships
(Figs 1, 2, 3). Results of the AU test [73] suggested that
topologies derived from the cpDNA and the complete
data set (Figs. 1 &3) were significantly different from one
another (P < 0.05). To rule out the possibility that samples
missing from the ITS dataset (Additional file 1) were causing some of the incongruence with the cpDNA phylogeny
a reduced data matrix of the cpDNA loci was created that
included only those samples also present in the ITS dataset. Results of the AU test (P < 0.05), indicated that the
resulting topology (data not shown) was similar to the
one from the complete cpDNA dataset, suggesting that
missing individuals are not responsible for the incongruence between the nuclear and chloroplast DNA datasets.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/264

Incongruences between phylogenies based on nDNA and
cpDNA are not uncommon [e.g., [79-81]] and can indicate specific biological processes in species evolution. For
example, hybridization has often been posited as an
explanation for incongruence [82,83]. Alternatively, differences between the topologies might simply reflect the
stochastic nature of the coalescent process [84]. The lack
of bootstrap support for many of the internal nodes on
the phylogenies (particularly those on the phylogeny
inferred with the ITS dataset) prevent us from making
strong statements regarding the meaning of the incongruences. Our discussion of relationships among putative
taxa relies primarily on the full and chloroplast data sets
because they tended to provide better support for inferred
relationships. We point out specific instances where the
estimates of relationships are different and well supported
in the ITS data set.
All three topologies we examined provided strong statistical support for the monophyly of the sampled Agalinis
species relative to the sampled outgroup species. Species
now recognized as Agalinis have variously been included
in the genera Gerardia, Tomanthera, and Virgularia. Gerardia had previously been applied to another taxon and the
name was abandoned in favor of Agalinis [31]; Tomanthera
and Virgularia are now synonymous with Agalinis. Aureolaria, Brachystigma, Dasistoma, Seymeria, and Esterhazya are
considered close allies and at times have been considered
congeneric with Agalinis [22,23]. Morphological evidence
suggested Agalinis was a distinct genus from Brachystigma
and Aureolaria [33], which our results clearly support.
Phylogenetic analysis of the Orobanchaceae based on a
single locus (phytochrome A) [85] indicates that the
South American genus Esterhazya may be more closely
related to Agalinis than are Aureolaria or Seymeria. South
American species of Agalinis have not been included in
any systematic studies and the only publicly available
sequence from Esterhazya represents a locus we did not
sample [87]. Sampling additional Esterhazya species and
South American Agalinis species will be essential to fully
understanding evolutionary relationships in this group as
a whole and to confirm the monophyly of the genus.
Section-level hypotheses
Agalinis linifolia is the only perennial Agalinis species in
North America and has additional distinguishing characters that have resulted in placement in its own monotypic
section (Table 1) that has been suggested to be basal to the
rest of the species. The unique ensemble of traits includes
the type of thickenings on the inner walls of the seed coat
cells [34], lack of yellow lines on the corolla, dense pubescence at the bases of the posterior corolla lobes, presence
of aerenchyma in stems, conspicuous endodermis in
roots, and palisade tissue in leaves that is developed more
strongly towards the lower surface [23]. Monophyly of A.

linifolia was supported; however, its placement within the
genus remains ambiguous due to lack of support for surrounding nodes in all trees (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Despite this
ambiguity, there is no evidence that this taxon is basal
because it is placed within a relatively derived clade that is
well supported. Further, a tree placing A. linifolia as basal
had a significantly worse likelihood score than the best
tree from the unconstrained analyses (P < 0.05). Thus, the
perennial growth habit appears to be derived within this
genus of otherwise annual species.
Members of Section Heterophyllae have also been suggested to be basal within the genus based on having relatively large, broad, lanceolate leaves; leaf-like calyx lobes
that are longer than the calyx tube; oblong or ovoidoblong capsules, and glabrous stems [22]. In particular,
Pennell [22] suggested that A. auriculata most closely
resembled the ancestral state of the genus based on also
having relatively large corollas with pubescence limited to
the area below the posterior sinus, and having posterior
anther cells that are smaller than the anterior cells in addition to the characters described above [23]. Diagnostic
aspects of leaf anatomy include thickened epidermal cell
walls, bands of sclerids and fibers between the cortex and
phloem, patterns of the subepidermal collenchyma on the
leaf midribs, and lack of specialized trichomes [42,43].
We found only two of the three species hypothesized to
comprise this section (A. heterophylla and A. calycina) to be
monophyletic, and this well supported clade is indeed
basal within the genus in the cpDNA and full data sets. Of
these two species, we could obtain ITS sequence only for
A. heterophylla, which was placed sister to the Subsection
Pedunculares clade, but with low bootstrap support. The
third species, A. auriculata, is not closely related to this
group in any of the trees (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Agalinis auriculata
was known to differ from A. heterophylla in leaf and stem
pubescence [42], and the perceived importance of differences suggested by those features are supported by our
molecular data (Figs. 1, 2, 3).
Section Tenuifolieae has long been taxonomically problematic [42]. Pennell [23] united Agalinis tenuifolia, A.
divaricata and A. filicaulis in this section based on lack of
pubescence on the posterior corolla and upper corolla
lobes being arched forward rather than erect or reflexed
back as is seen in the rest of the genus. Canne-Hilliker and
Kampny [42] placed A. tenuifolia in Section Purpureae
based on morphological and anatomical features, while
retaining A. divaricata and A. filicaulis in Section Tenuifolieae. Most obviously, the upper corolla lobes in A. divaricata and A. filicaulis are less than 1/3 the length of the
lower lobes and the corolla is greatly flattened, occluding
the opening to the throat. In contrast, the upper corolla
lobes of A. tenuifolia are more equal in length to the lower
lobes and the corolla throat is closer to round in cross sec-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/264

tion. Agalinis divaricata and A. filicaulis also share peculiar
seedling and trichome types [41] and stem anatomy [42]
that are not similar to any other Agalinis species and thus
their placement has been challenging. High bootstrap
support and the relatively long branch length supporting
this clade in both the cpDNA and nDNA trees (Figs. 1, 2,
3) strongly support a sister relationship between A. divaricata and A. filicaulis. At the same time, branch lengths separating these two species are the longest of any sistertaxon pairs in the data set (Fig. 3). Relationships of this
clade to other members of the genus depicted in the
cpDNA tree conflict with those in the ITS tree. The cpDNA
sequence data indicate that the most likely placement of
the A. divaricata/A. filicaulis clade is sister to a clade including Section Purpureae (Fig. 1), and in the phylogenies
from the ITS and the full data set these species have a more
basal placement within the genus (Figs. 2 &3).
Relationships of A. tenuifolia to other taxa are ambiguous;
the cpDNA phylogeny supports a sister relationship of A.
tenuifolia with all Agalinis species except the A. heterophylla/A. calycina clade (bootstrap support = 100%) (Fig.
1). Phylogenies based on the ITS and full data sets indicate
an alliance with A. maritima and A. gattingeri (bootstrap
support = 84%) (Figs. 2 &3). In no case, however, does
this species appear to be closely related to A. divaricata and
A. filicaulis.
With the exception of A. gattingeri, which is found within
the clade discussed above, the monophyly of Section Erectae is strongly supported in the full data tree (bootstrap
support = 95%) (Fig. 3). This section is united by the following genetic, anatomical, and morphological characters: chromosome number of n = 13 [43], yellow-green
colored foliage that does not blacken upon drying, small
flowers that have relatively short corolla tubes and
reflexed corolla lobes, pedicels longer than the calyx tube
and light brown seeds [34,42]. Lack of blackening upon
drying is thought to be due to low concentrations of aucubosides [38] that are at higher concentrations in other
members of the genus. Placement of A. gattingeri apart
from other members of the Erectae is problematic because
it contradicts evidence that suggests close evolutionary
relationships based on chromosome number [45] and the
unique seed type [34] shared by other members of the section. However, A. gattingeri was always considered peripheral within Section Erectae due to its lack of anatomical
features of the stem that are characteristic of the rest of the
group [43]. Additional sampling is necessary to determine
if this placement outside the Erectae is accurate or due to
misidentification of the collections we sequenced or misinterpretation of the anatomical and morphological features.

Section Purpureae as defined by both Canne-Hilliker and
Pennell was the largest section in the genus and it has
been considered to have 3–5 subsections. Members were
united by having globose capsules, dark brown seeds, narrow leaves that turn black upon drying and calyx lobes
that are shorter than the calyx tube. We found little support for any of the historical concepts of this section or the
majority of the recognized subsections (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Only
Subsection Pedunculares appears to be a natural group
(Figs. 1 &3); however, this subsection is sister to taxa comprising Section Erectae rather than to other taxa considered to be in the Purpureae. Subsection Pedunculares was
considered to be distinct from the Erectae based on
corolla form and pubescence patterns, seed color and surface patterns, and stem and leaf anatomy [43]. Neel and
Cummings [47] had previously suggested a sister relationship between the Pedunculares and the Erectae but their
results were based on fewer species and the relationship
did not have strong bootstrap support. Aligning the
Pedunculares with the Erectae unites all the taxa with 13
chromosomes except A. gattingeri, which is placed with
species considered to be in Section Purpureae. If not for
the problematic placement of A. gattingeri, it would
appear that n = 14 was ancestral and the haploid chromosome number of 13 arose only once in the genus.
We found no support for the monophyly of Subsections
Purpureae or Setaceae and many nodes supporting members that have been recognized to comprise these groups
have weak bootstrap support (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Thus, despite
the fact that most species are separated by well supported
branches with non-zero lengths (exceptions will be discussed below), higher level relationships among species
remain unclear. We did, however, find support for some
hypothesized relationships. For example, our data support close relationships of A. fasciculata, A. purpurea, and
A. paupercula in all trees (Figs 1, 2, 3). We also found support for a sister relationship between A. setacea and A.
plukenettii in the full data set (Fig. 3) that had previously
been hypothesized based on both species having acute trichomes [41]. We found no support for a close relationship of A. laxa to these two taxa in the full data set but A.
laxa and A. plukenettii were part of a poorly supported
clade that also comprised the A. tenuifolia/A. gattingeri/A.
maritima clade in the ITS tree. Although it had been classified with A. setacea and A. plukenettii in Subsection Setaceae, Agalinis laxa was known to differ in having capitate
trichomes on the hypocotyls and lacking acute trichomes
[41].
Overall, our results suggest that North American members
of the genus comprise six major lineages, however we
were not able to resolve branching order among many of
these lineages. We propose that Section Heterophyllae
consisting of A. calycina, A. heterophylla (and potentially A.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/264

densiflora but we did not sample this species) represents
the basal group. Following the divergence of Section Heterophyllae, a rapid diversification resulted in five additional primary lineages. These lineages include one
comprising what have been considered Section Erectae
and Subsection Pedunculares, two unrelated monospecific lineages (one comprising A. auriculata and the other
A. linifolia), a fourth lineage corresponding roughly to Section Tenuifolieae, and a fifth consisting of the remaining
taxa that have been included in Section Purpureae. We
further recognize Section Erectae (sans A. gattingeri) and
what was Subsection Pedunculares as distinct sister lineages that are relatively derived within the genus.
One potential explanation for lack of bootstrap support
for the more basal relationships in the genus is a rapid
diversification of lineages (i.e., a hard polytomy) [e.g.,
[86]]. This explanation is also supported by presence of
comparatively short branches towards the base of the phylogeny (Fig. 3). Alternatively our data may simply not be
sufficient to determine the order of branching (i.e., a soft
polytomy) [e.g., [86]]. Although there is the potential that
sequencing additional nuclear loci may be able to resolve
the branching order at interior nodes on the phylogeny,
we believe that a soft polytomy seems unlikely given the
amount of DNA sequence we sampled and the levels of
variation we observed in those sequences. Because our
objectives included estimating both deep and shallow
relationships, we specifically chose an array of loci that
were expected to be useful for estimating relationships
across the ranges of divergence anticipated.
Testing Species-level hypotheses
Our results corroborate most of the species designations
in the genus and clarify some previous taxonomic ambiguities. Based on likelihood ratio tests, 83% (24 of 29)
sampled species in the genus have significant (non-zero)
branch lengths and 78% of species with multiple samples
have bootstrap support > 98%. There are also multiple
cases in which branch lengths between conspecific individuals are greater than zero (e.g. the two A. aphylla samples [Fig. 3]) indicating that there is substantial
differentiation among conspecific populations. Although
we do not believe that there is a single particular amount
of differentiation that determines a cutoff for recognizing
a species-level distinction, we do expect populations
within species to lack strong hierarchical structure due to
tokogenetic processes [87]. The hierarchical structure
indicated by significant branch lengths and high bootstrap support within species (e.g., A. skinneriana, A. decemloba, A. oligophylla, A. fasciculata, and A. tenuifolia)
indicates the need for closer examination of the biological
basis of the observed patterns. Sampling additional loci
and populations and using phylogeographic analytical

methods would contribute to understanding whether
these populations actually represent different species.
Exceptions to overall pattern of monophyly described
above are the apparent polyphyly of A. harperi; the lack of
differentiation between A. purpurea and A. paupercula; and
the lack of differentiation among A. decemloba, A. tenella,
and A. acuta (Figs. 1, 2, 3). All rare species that are of conservation concern except A. acuta and A. paupercula were
supported as distinct.
The two sampled A. harperi individuals had identical ITS
sequences (Fig. 2) but were polyphyletic based on cpDNA
data (Fig. 1). Both individuals were part of a moderately
supported clade (bootstrap support = 83%) consisting of
representatives of putative A. purpurea and A. paupercula,
A. fasciculata and A. gattingeri individuals. However, A.
harperi 13FL is most closely related to A. gattingeri and the
other appears sister to the A. fasciculata/A. purpurea/A. paupercula clade (Fig. 1). Reamplification and sequencing of
rpoB, rps2, and trnT-trnF loci from the two A. harperi samples yielded sequences that were identical to those used in
constructing the phylogenies, thus ruling out the possibility that samples were mishandled. Therefore, the difference between the cpDNA and nDNA may be best
explained by hybridization or introgression from another
species that is represented by chloroplast capture [88].
Although it is not possible to say with much certainty
given the lack of statistical support for the relationship
between the A gattingeri samples and A. harperi 13FL, A.
gattingeri may be the species from which cpDNA has introgressed into the A. harperi collection from Florida. Sampling from more A. harperi and A. gattingeri individuals
and populations is required to resolve this issue.
Agalinis purpurea and A. paupercula have been the subject
of debate, with taxonomic hypotheses ranging from treating them as two species, as two varieties of A. purpurea, or
synonymizing them under a single species. Pennell suggested relatively recent divergence related to the last ice
age [22]. These putative taxa differ from one another in
that A. paupercula is reported to have smaller corollas (10–
20 mm) and broader calyx lobes that are greater than half
the length of the calyx tube [22]. Agalinis purpurea has
corollas ranging from 18–38 mm long and narrow calyx
lobes that are less than half the length of the tube.
Although they share many features during floral ontogeny, they do differ in A. paupercula var. borealis having different anther orientation, filament insertion points closer
to the ovary height, later stigma initiation, and less exsertion of the stigma at anthesis than A. purpurea [44]. The
effect of these characteristics on mating system or reproductive isolation is unknown. It is also not known if these
characteristics extend to other A. paupercula varieties. Our
data do not support recognizing A. paupercula as a distinct

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/264

taxon. However, we did not thoroughly sample from a
large number of putative populations of A. paupercula and
it remains possible that some populations that have been
attributed to that species represent a distinct entity. Further it is possible that higher resolution markers would
allow us to differentiate A. paupercula and A. purpurea as is
discussed below for A. acuta.
One of the primary objectives of this study was to evaluate
the evolutionary distinctiveness of the federally listed
endangered species Agalinis acuta. Potential synonymy of
A. acuta with A. tenella was raised by Neel and Cummings
[47] due to lack of sequence divergence in two cpDNA loci
between two individuals. Sampling nine representatives
of A. acuta and five of A. tenella in this study allowed us to
more thoroughly examine this issue. Previous taxonomic
revisions [53] that synonymized A. tenella and A. decemloba with A. obtusifolia necessitated inclusion of accessions
attributed to the latter two species. Rather than clarifying
relationships among these taxa, our results show a more
convoluted situation than was previously thought to exist.
The ITS phylogeny shows A. tenella, A. acuta, A. decemloba
and A. obtusifolia to be polyphyletic (Fig. 3); however,
there is little support for this topology. The phylogenies
based on cpDNA loci alone and all loci combined (Figs. 1
&3, respectively) show A. tenella to be monophyletic and
subtended by a branch with a length that is significantly
different from zero based on the likelihood ratio test.
There is, however, no bootstrap support for this clade and
it is nested within a clade that includes A. acuta and A.
decemloba. On both topologies, A. acuta and A. decemloba
are polyphyletic (Figs. 1 &3) and an AU test indicated that
forcing the monophyly of A. acuta and A. tenella yielded a
topology that was significantly worse than the best topology for all three datasets (P < 0.05). Although A. acuta, A.
decemloba, and A. tenella form a highly supported monophyletic clade, one accession of A. decemloba (6VA) is distinguished from all other accessions of these three taxa
based on branch lengths that are significantly different
than zero and 98% bootstrap support (Fig. 3). This differentiation is the result of differences within the trnT-trnF
locus. These include numerous single nucleotide differences and a 16 bp deletion, the majority of which are also
present in the A. obtusifolia samples.
Regardless, our results do not provide statistical support
for separate species status for A. acuta, A. decemloba, and A.
tenella under the criteria of either a phylogenetic species
concept [89] or a genealogical species concept [11]. Agalinis obtusifolia comprises a monophyletic clade that is sister to the clade containing A. skinneriana, and A. tenella, A.
acuta, and A. decemloba, thus strongly refuting the recent
taxonomic revision synonymizing both A. decemloba and
A. tenella with A. obtusifolia [e.g., [27,53]].

Lack of monophyly of even morphologically well defined
species can result from incomplete lineage sorting of
shared ancestral polymorphism or contemporary gene
flow [16,17,90]. Given that it takes on the order of ~8.7 Ne
generations for an 0.95 probability of reciprocal monophyly to evolve at a single locus after speciation events
[17,20], it can be challenging to distinguish among
closely related taxa using phylogenetic methods. It is also
possible that the DNA sequences we examined do not
have sufficient mutation rates to have accumulated nucleotide differences in the time since divergence. However,
the loci sampled appear to have a sufficient amount of
variation to distinguish ~83% of the 29 sampled species
in the genus, some of which are likely to have recently
diverged from a common ancestor. Due to the important
policy implications of combining A. acuta, A. tenella, and
A. decemloba into a single taxon, additional research is
being conducted on the morphological and genetic differences, using more variable loci, from samples collected
from throughout the range of each species.
As mentioned above, we found that A. skinneriana formed
a well supported clade that was sister to the clade containing A. tenella, A. decemloba, and A. acuta (Figs. 1 &3). Prior
to this work, taxonomic boundaries and phylogenetic
affinities of A. skinneriana were not understood. Additionally, the Maryland populations that we sampled were
problematic for experts to identify because these populations were beyond the known range for the species at the
time they were discovered. The morphological characteristics of A. skinneriana most closely matched these populations, but there was some lingering question as to their
identity. Our results confirm that these populations are
sister to the A. skinneriana sample from Missouri and they
represent an extension of this otherwise Midwestern prairie taxon to the grasslands of the Atlantic coastal plain.
However, the branch separating the Maryland populations from the Missouri population is significantly different from zero indicating that further investigation of the
phylogeography of this putative species may be warranted
to determine if the Maryland populations are actually an
unrecognized species. Clarifying these relationships is
important because this species is considered rare in the
state of Maryland and correct identification is essential for
both protecting a rare entity and not imposing restrictions
for something that does not warrant them.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the sampled Agalinis species form a well
supported, monophyletic group relative to the other genera sampled from within the family Orobanchaceae.
Despite the well known taxonomic difficulty in this
genus, 24 of the 29 the species we sampled that had been
recognized based on anatomy and morphology were well
supported. We confirmed the monophyly of 19 rare spe-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/264

cies, thus supporting their eligibility for receiving conservation attention. The species that do not form well
supported clades based on DNA sequence data include
the federally listed species A. acuta and the state-rare species A. paupercula. Although we were able to resolve some
relationships among these species, most notably that the
synonymization of the latter two with A. obtusifolia is
unwarranted, a number of ambiguities remain. Due to the
important policy implications raised by this finding, we
are examining relationships among A. acuta, A. decemloba,
and A. tenella further by sampling more individuals and
populations using higher resolution molecular markers
and morphological data. It is clear that most hypotheses
regarding section- and subsection-level relationships
based on morphology are not supported and taxonomic
revisions are warranted.
