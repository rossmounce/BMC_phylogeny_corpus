Abstract
Background: The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily is one of the largest evolutionarily conserved
families of proteins. ABC proteins play key roles in cellular detoxification of endobiotics and xenobiotics.
Overexpression of certain ABC proteins, among them the multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP),
contributes to drug resistance in organisms ranging from human neoplastic cells to parasitic protozoa. In
the present study, the Plasmodium berghei mrp gene (pbmrp) was partially characterized and the predicted
protein was classified using bioinformatics in order to explore its putative involvement in drug resistance.
Methods: The pbmrp gene from the P. berghei drug sensitive, N clone, was sequenced using a PCR
strategy. Classification and domain organization of pbMRP were determined with bioinformatics. The
Plasmodium spp. MRPs were aligned and analysed to study their conserved motifs and organization. Gene
copy number and organization were determined via Southern blot analysis in both N clone and the
chloroquine selected line, RC. Chromosomal Southern blots and RNase protection assays were employed
to determine the chromosomal location and expression levels of pbmrp in blood stages.
Results: The pbmrp gene is a single copy, intronless gene with a predicted open reading frame spanning
5820 nucleotides. Bioinformatic analyses show that this protein has distinctive features characteristic of
the ABCC sub-family. Multiple sequence alignments reveal a high degree of conservation in the nucleotide
binding and transmembrane domains within the MRPs from the Plasmodium spp. analysed. Expression of
pbmrp was detected in asexual blood stages. Gene organization, copy number and mRNA expression was
similar in both lines studied. A chromosomal translocation was observed in the chloroquine selected RC
line, from chromosome 13/14 to chromosome 8, when compared to the drug sensitive N clone.
Conclusion: In this study, the pbmrp gene was sequenced and classified as a member of the ABCC subfamily. Multiple sequence alignments reveal that this gene is homologous to the Plasmodium y. yoelii and
Plasmodium knowlesi mrp, and the Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum mrp2 genes. There were no
differences in gene organization, copy number, or mRNA expression between N clone and the RC line,
but a chromosomal translocation of pbmrp from chromosome 13/14 to chromosome 8 was detected in
RC.

Background
The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily is one of the
largest evolutionarily-conserved families of protein transporters. ABC proteins play key roles in cellular detoxification of xeno- and endobiotics. Overexpression of certain
ABC proteins, among them the multidrug resistance protein (MDR) and the multidrug resistance associated proteins (MRPs), contribute to drug resistance in a variety
organisms ranging from parasitic protozoa to human neoplastic cells.
Membrane transporters, such as the Plasmodium falciparum
chloroquine resistant transporter (pfcrt) and the Plasmodium falciparum mdr1, which is a member of the ABC
superfamily, have been identified as key contributors in
decreasing susceptibility to several anti-malarial drugs [14]. Research to identify additional potential contributors
to Plasmodium drug resistance has lead to the identification of new candidate transporter genes, some of which
belong to the ABC transporter superfamily [5-8]. The ABC
transporter superfamily is comprised of eight subfamilies
in eukaryotes: ABCA, ABCB, ABCC, ABCD, ABCE, ABCF,
ABCG, and ABCH. Proteins within this superfamily were
classified based on the sequence and organization of their
conserved nucleotide binding domains (NBD). Characteristic motifs within these NBDs are found in the majority
of adenine nucleotide hydrolases: the Walker A and
Walker B boxes, ABC signature motif, H (histidine) loop,
D (aspartate) loop, and Q (glutamine) loop [9-13]. In
general, functional ABC proteins contain two NBDs and
two transmembrane domains (TMD) consisting of 6–11
transmembrane helices. Genes are organized either as full
transporters containing two of each domain or half transporters with one of each (Figure 1c).
Members of the ABCC sub-family have been associated
with drug resistance in organisms ranging from bacteria to
man. This sub-family is comprised of a variety of proteins
some of which have been designated as multidrug resistance associated proteins (MRPs). These proteins serve as
primary active transporters of an array of structurally
diverse compounds including organic anions such as glucuronide, glutathione (GSH), sulphate, drugs conjugated
to GSH, and non-conjugated agents by GSH co-transport
[14,15]. The human ABCC sub-family consists of 13
members, nine of which are transporters: MRP1, MRP2,
MRP3, MRP4, MRP5, MRP6, MRP7, MRP8, and MRP9
[16,17]. The human MRP1 has been the most studied
among the MRP proteins because of its ability to transport
a broad range of anticancer drugs through cellular membranes mediated by GSH co-transport or by the export of
GSH-drug conjugates [14,18]. In addition, MRPs have
been associated with drug resistance in other organisms
such as the heavy metal resistance protein MRP-1 in
Caenorhabditis elegans [19], the GSH conjugate transport-

ers AtMRP1, AtMRP2, and AtMRP3 in Arabidopsis thaliana
[20-22], and yeast cadmium factor gene (ycf1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [23]. Several mrp orthologs have been
identified and linked to drug resistance in protozoa such
as Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania spp. In T. brucei,
reduced sensitivity to melarsoprol has been linked to the
overexpression of the MRP homologue, TbMRPA [24]. In
Leishmania, the pentamidine resistance protein 1(PRP1/
ABCC7) and MRPA (formerly known as P-glycoprotein A/
ABCC3) were shown to confer pentamidine resistance
and antimony resistance, respectively [25-29].
Homologues of these proteins have been identified in
Plasmodium spp., but there is no clear evidence linking this
transporter to anti-malarial resistance. Expression of MRP
homologues was reported in P. berghei and P. yoelii [7] as
well as in P. falciparum [30]. The P. falciparum mrp1 gene
is an intronless gene with highest mRNA expression in the
late trophozoite and schizont stages. The P. falciparum
mrp2, however, is mostly expressed in ring stages [31].
Protein expression of these genes has only been reported
for pfMRP1, where it has only been detected in the schizont stage, except in the CQ resistant P. falciparum strain,
FAC8, where it was also detected in the trophozoite stage
[30]. Mutations within this gene have been associated
with anti-malarial resistance in clinical isolates [5,6,32].
In this study, the pbmrp gene was partially characterized
using bioinformatics and molecular biology methods. We
sequenced pbmrp and classified it as an ABCC sub-family
member. Multiple sequence alignments with MRPs from
P. y. yoelii, P. vivax, P. knowlesi and P. falciparum reveal a
high degree of conservation within transmembrane and
nucleotide binding domains. Bioinformatic analyses indicate that pbMRP is homologous to a Plasmodium spp.
MRP2 gene. In addition, the gene copy number, structural
organization, chromosomal localization and mRNA
expression levels of the pbmrp gene were determined in
drug sensitive (N clone) and the drug resistant derived
line RC which was selected under CQ pressure and displays the multidrug resistance phenotype.

Methods
Plasmodium berghei lines and maintenance
Random-bred Swiss albino female mice were infected
intravenously with the P. berghei drug sensitive N clone or
the RC line which was selected under CQ pressure and displays the multidrug resistant phenotype. These lines were
kindly provided by Wallace Peters [33,34]. Mice infected
with the RC line were dosed once with CQ 1 hr after infection in order to maintain drug selection pressure [35].
Platelets and white blood cells were removed from the
infected blood by glass bead and CF-11 cellulose columns, respectively. Infected red blood cells (IRBCs) were

differentially lysed with 0.15% saponin [36] and free parasites were collected.
Nucleic acid extraction
Plasmodium berghei DNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction [37]. Total parasite RNA was extracted
using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test Inc.) according to manufacturer's specifications. Chromosome blocks were prepared
as described by Serrano et al [38].

PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of the P.
berghei mrp
Plasmodium berghei genomic DNA from the N clone was
subjected to PCR amplification using primers designed
based on the mrp gene identified in P. y. yoelii [7] (Additional file 1). Amplification of pbmrp fragments was carried out under standard conditions. Amplified products
were cloned into pGEM®-T-EASY (Promega) plasmids
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified

clones were sequenced using the Applied Biosystems Big
Dye Terminator V3.0 sequencing chemistry (Davis
Sequencing Inc., CA). Every position of the putative open
reading frame for the pbmrp gene was sequenced at least
twice in each direction.
Bioinformatic analyses
The pbmrp gene was assembled by aligning the overlapping translated sequence of the P. berghei cloned PCR
products along the translated P. y. yoelii mrp gene [GenBank: XP_725434]. Once the entire putative open reading
frame (ORF) was assembled, the predicted amino acid
sequence was analysed to identify conserved motifs using
the InterProScan sequence search tool [39] and the Conserved Domain Search service [40]. The presence of internal transmembrane domains and their organization was
predicted using the TMHMM v. 2.0 prediction server [41]
and the DAS transmembrane prediction server [42]. Plasmodium mrp sequences were retrieved by sequence similarity searches using the pbmrp translated sequence from the
PlasmoDB ver. 5.4 [43] and the BLAST search tool hosted
at PlasmoDB and at NCBI [44,45]. To obtain the closest
human homologue, we performed sequence similarity
searches against human genome protein database using
the P. berghei mrp predicted protein sequence.

The following sequences were recovered and used for subsequent sequence analyses: P. falciparum mrp1 [GenBank:
ABV24500], P. falciparum mrp2 [GenBank: ABV24501], P.
vivax mrp1 [GenBank: XP_001612680], P. vivax mrp2
[GenBank: XP_001617379], P. knowlesi mrp [GenBank:
CAQ42240], P. berghei mrp [GenBank; AAS46595], and P.
y. yoelii mrp [GenBank: XP_725434]. Multiple sequence
alignments and analyses were carried out using the ClustalW program hosted at the European Bioinformatics
Institute [46]. Alignments were visualized by using GeneDoc (provided by the Pittsburg Supercomputing Center)
[47]. The phylogenetic analysis of the MRPs from Plasmodium was performed as follows. The predicted protein
sequences for the MRP genes from Plasmodium listed in
Table 1 and the MRP2 from Homo sapiens [GenBank:
CAB45309] (which was used as outgroup for placement

of the root) were retrieved from NCBI in FASTA format.
The multiple sequence alignment was done with ClustalW
as described above. The alignment was submitted to the
GBlocks server to trim the sections of large variability that
would affect the phylogenetic analysis [48]. The GBlocks
analysis was carried out using the less restrictive settings of
smaller blocks and permitting gaps within the blocks. The
suggested multiple sequence alignment, which retained
approximately 49% of the alignment positions, was
taken. The phylogenetic analysis was done using the
PHYLIP suite of programs [49]. The program SEQBOOT
was used to generate a bootstrapped data set of 500 replicates. The program PROTDIST was used to generate the
distance matrices for the analysis. The rooted phylogenetic trees were constructed according to the program
NEIGHBOR using the neighbor-joining algorithm [50].
The program CONSENSE was used to build a rooted consensus tree using an extended majority rule.
Southern blot analysis
Southern blots and subsequent hybridizations were performed as described by Gervais et al., 1999 [51]. Genomic
DNA (gDNA) from the P. berghei lines, N clone and RC,
were digested with HindIII, EcoRI, or EcoRV. Membranes
were hybridized with 5' and 3' pbmrp specific probes
which were amplified with the following primer combinations: pbmrp 5' (Forward primer-TAATATAGATAAAAATGAGGGGG
and
Reverse
primerAAAGTGCATAACAGTTACTTCC) and pbmrp 3' (Forward
primer-TACAATAGTTATGGCAATATTAG and Reverse
primer-CATCAATAATTTCTTATCAGA).
Hybridizations
were carried out at 65°C in 2× sodium chloride/sodium
citrate solution (SSC) with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate
(SDS).
Chromosomal blot and localization
Plasmodium berghei (N clone and RC) chromosomes were
separated by pulse-field gel electrophoresis [52,38]. To
optimize separation (BioRad CHEF DRII) running conditions were modified as follows: 125 V, 120-s pulses for 24
h and 300-s pulses for 24 h at 14°C. Chromosomes were
blotted onto a Zeta Probe membrane (BioRad) and

hybridized at 65°C in 2× SSC/0.1% SDS with a radiolabeled P. berghei mrp specific 3' probe. Subsequently, the
membranes were stripped and hybridized to known P.
berghei chromosome markers: a chromosome 13/14
probe (probe 9.45 kindly provided by Dr. Marta Ponzi)
[52] or a chromosome 8 probe directed to a known gene
previously localized to this chromosome, the P. berghei γglutamylcysteine synthetase gene (pbggcs) [53,54].
RNase protection assay (RPA)
Alpha-32P UTP labelled riboprobes for pbmrp and β-tubulin (βtub, used as a normalizing control) were synthesized
in vitro by antisense transcription using the T7 RNA
polymerase (Maxiscript® SP6/T7 Kit, Ambion). Riboprobes were co-precipitated with dilutions of total RNA
from the P. berghei sensitive N-clone or the drug resistant
derived line RC. RPA was performed using the RPAIII™
system (Ambion, Austin, Texas) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protected RNA hybrids were
resolved on denaturing acrylamide gels which were subsequently exposed to autoradiography films. Autoradiograms were scanned and analysed using Quantity One 1D Analysis Software (Bio-Rad, v. 4.4). Ratios of the densities of the normalized pbmrp signals were subsequently
normalized to the drug sensitive N-clone to estimate
mRNA expression levels in RC.

Results
Identification and characterization of an mrp homologue
in P. berghei
An mrp homologue was identified in P. berghei using
primers designed to PCR-amplify the pbmrp gene in the
drug sensitive N clone. Sequence analysis of the pbmrp
gene shows an open reading frame (ORF) of 5820 nucleotides. This single exon gene encodes a predicted protein
of 1939 amino acids (Additional file 2). Based on the
NBD amino acid sequence, the NCBI's Conserved
Domain Database classified pbMRP as a member of the

ABCC transporter sub-family (Figure 1a). This transporter
possesses the general structural features associated with
MRPs. Transmembrane helix predictions by both the DAS
and TMHMM transmembrane prediction servers predict
that pbMRP has 12 transmembrane helices organized into
two TMDs and that both, the N-terminal and C-terminal,
are intracellular. A model presenting domain organization of the predicted pbMRP amino acid sequence, which
contains two TMDs and two NBDs, is shown in Figure 1c.
Five of the six characteristic motifs associated with ABC
NBDs were found within the NBDs of pbMRP (Figure 2).
In NBD1, the Walker A, Q loop, ABC motif, Walker B and
the D loop were identified, with a large variable insertion
between the ABC motif and the Walker B motif. Within
NBD2, the Walker A, Q loop, ABC motif, Walker B and the
H loop were found. However, the H loop in NBD1 and
the D loop within NBD2 were not found (Figure 2). Consensus motif sequences and the Plasmodium spp. motif
sequences found within the NBDs are reported in Table 2.
The predicted pbMRP amino acid sequence was used to
identify homologues in other Plasmodium species by
sequence similarity searches in PlasmoDB. A partial
sequence was found in the P. berghei genome, two
homologous genes in P. falciparum (pfmrp1 and
pfmrp2), two in P. vivax (pvmrp1 and pvmrp2), one in P.
knowlesi (pkmrp), and one in P. y. yoelii (pymrp). A multiple sequence alignment of the protein sequences shows
that pbMRP has highest similarity with its homologue in
the rodent malaria species, P. y. yoelii (Figure 3 and Additional file 3). Sequence identity between pbMRP and the
MRPs from Plasmodium spp. ranges from 82–32% with
the highest percent identity with pyMRP and the lowest
with pfMRP1 (Table 1). BLAST results show that pbMRP
is more closely related to pyMRP, pkMRP, pfMRP2 and
pvMRP2 with expectation values reported as 0 although it
also exhibits a high degree of relatedness to pfMRP1 and
pvMRP1 (Table 1). Sequence similarity searches against

the human genome protein database show that MRP2 is
the closest homologue to pbMRP with an expectation
value of 9e-30. The phylogenetic gene tree supports the
results presented in Table 1 (Figure 4). The MRP1 subfamily and the MRP2 subfamily are clearly grouped into
separate clusters indicating these are paralogous genes.
The bootstrap values for all branches are above 97 percent
indicating highly significant support for the clades seen in
the gene tree.
pbmrp gene organization in drug sensitive and resistant
lines
To explore whether pbmrp genetic rearrangements and/or
an increase in gene copy number contribute to drug resistance in resistant P. berghei lines, Southern blot analysis
were performed on restricted gDNA from each of the P.
berghei lines (Figure 5). The 3' probe hybridized to a single
band for each enzyme used. Similarly, the hybridization
with the 5' probe also resulted in a single band for each
enzyme. Results show no difference in the band patterns
and hence there is no difference in the genetic organization of pbmrp between the drug sensitive N clone and the
CQ resistant RC line. In addition, there is no difference in
hybridization intensities between the drug sensitive (N
clone) and resistant line (RC) indicating the same pbmrp
gene copy number in both parasite lines.
Chromosomal location of pbmrp in drug sensitive and
resistant lines

Black arrows above the locus represent the restriction sites
within the gene or in flanking areas. Below the coding region,
the black lines represent the 5' and 3' specific probes used.
Genomic DNA from N clone and RC line was digested with
Hind III (H3), Eco RI (RI), and Eco RV (RV). The predicted
bands and their sizes are depicted by black arrows. (B) Both
probes hybridize to a single band for each of the enzyme
used: 14.1 kb for RV, 3.5 kb for RI, and 2.0 kb for H3 (left
panel) and 9.5 kb with RI, 6.5 kb with H3, and approximately
2.5 kb with RV (right panel), respectively.

pbmrp gene was localized to the largest chromosome band
corresponding to chromosome 13/14, which co-migrate
in P. berghei (Figure 6). However, in CQ selected line
(RC), the pbmrp gene was detected only in chromosome 8
indicating that a translocation event took place. This
translocation was observed using pbmrp specific probes
targetting the 3' terminus.
Comparison of pbmrp expression profiles in drug sensitive
and resistant lines
RNase protection assays were employed to measure pbmrp
expression at the level of transcription in the drug sensitive N clone and the drug resistant line, RC. Expression in
RC was 1.26 ± 0.49 (mean ± std.dev) relative to N clone
pbmrp RNA expression levels (Figure 7). Similar pbmrp
transcription levels were detected in RC when compared
to N clone.

Discussion
Energy-dependent transporters are responsible for maintaining the metabolic homeostasis in organisms. Understanding transporters involved in cellular detoxification
and/or drug efflux in Plasmodium spp. can provide critical

Chromosomal location of the pbmrp gene. Representative results for the chromosomal location of pbmrp gene in
the P. berghei N clone and RC line. P. berghei chromosomes
were visualized with ethidium bromide (EtBr) prior to transfer. Chromosome membranes were hybridized with a 3' specific pbmrp probe, a chromosome 13/14 specific marker [52]
or to a chromosome 8 probe [54]. Note, that the pbmrp
gene was localized to chromosome 13/14 in N clone and to
chromosome 8 in the CQ selected line (RC).

information about their function and their potential as
new drug targets. Plasmodium berghei, a rodent malaria
model, is a proven and valuable tool for studying Plasmodium biology as well as the development of resistance to
anti-malarials which continues to be global health problem. In this study, a multidrug resistance associated protein gene in P. berghei was sequenced. This gene, pbmrp,
was classified and characterized using bioinformatics. The
pbmrp gene organization, copy number, and gene expression levels were compared between the drug sensitive N
clone and the CQ selected (RC) P. berghei line.
The pbmrp gene has an intronless ORF of 5820 nucleotides
and is predicted to encode a protein comprised of 1939
amino acids. NCBI's Conserved Domain Database classified pbMRP as a member of the ABCC transporter subfamily (Figure 1a). Using the predicted pbMRP sequence,
six homologues were identified in four Plasmodium species (P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. knowlesi and P. y. yoelii) by
sequence similarity searches in the PlasmoDB and in
NCBI. We note that at the time the analyses were performed the annotation of the proteins at NCBI and PlasmoDB is only complete for the pfMRP2 and pfMRP1. For
pvMRP1 and pvMRP2 the annotations are ABC transporter and multidrug-resistance associated protein,
respectively. The classification as MRP1 and MRP2 is
based on the results presented here from similarity
searches and phylogenetic analyses. For pkMRP2,
pyMRP2 and pbMRP2 the annotations are transporter/
putative mrp, ABC transporter, and multidrug-resistance

associated protein respectively. As before, classification as
MRP2 is based on the results presented here from similarity searches and phylogenetic analyses. At this time, the
presence of two mrp genes appears to be unique for the
two human malaria species, P. falciparum and P. vivax
(Table 2). An additional mrp gene may confer a biological
advantage for P. falciparum or P. vivax with respect to fitness or the evolution of drug resistance but this has yet to
be proven experimentally. BLAST results support that
from an evolutionary standpoint pbMRP is more closely
related to pyMRP, pkMRP, pfMRP2 and pvMRP2 rather
than to pfMRP1 and pvMRP1 (Table 1). Interestingly,
sequence similarity searches against the human genome
show that pbMRP is more closely related to the MRP2.
Taken together, the fact that pbMRP is more similar to
pvMRP2 and pfMRP2 in addition to having the closest
relatedness to the human MRP2 confirms that the P.
berghei transporter is a member of the ABCC MRP2 subfamily. The phylogenetic analysis presented in Table 1
and Figure 4 supports the hypothesis that the MRP2 fam-

ily is the ancestral family of MRPs in Plasmodium. It is
noteworthy that at this time the MRP1 sub-family only
appears in parasites that infect humans. Given the lack of
knowledge about the function of the MRPs in Plasmodium,
it is not possible to assess the significance of the finding at
this time. It is also important to note that the MRP2 clade
groups the gene from P. knowlesi with that of P. vivax, in
agreement with published phylogenies [[55] and references therein]. Human MRP2 is involved in the terminal
phase of detoxification and excretion of endogenous and
xenobiotic organic anions in a unidirectional manner.
This protein actively transports glutathione, glucuronate,
or sulphate conjugates in addition to a variety of non-conjugated anionic substances including glutathione and glutathione disulfide [56]. Although MRP2 has broad
substrate specificity, it has highest affinity for gluconarate
and GSH conjugates of lipophilic substances [57,58].
Based on the sequence similarity to MRP2 and taking into
account the biological function of this membrane transporter, it would be reasonable to suggest that the biological function of pbMRP might be related to cell
detoxification and the secretion of conjugated and/or non
conjugated endogenous and xenobiotic anions. In addition, human MRP2 has been shown to confer drug resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents in cell lines
expressing the recombinant protein or antisense constructs [59-61]. Given that MRP2 confers resistance in
human cells in addition to the fact that the overexpression
of homologues in Leishmania and T. brucei [24,26,29] is
associated with drug resistance raises the possibility that
pbmrp may also contribute to this phenomenon.
The pbMRP displays the typical core ABCC/MRP domain
organization of two units of a TMD and a NBD (Figure
1c). All human MRPs, the best and most completely characterized members of this sub-family, possess this typical
core structure with the exception of MRP1, MRP2, MRP3,
MRP6 and MRP7 which have an additional N-terminal
region composed of a third transmembrane domain
(TMD0) [62,63,17,64]. The pbMRP does not possess this
additional TMD0 (Figure 1b) similar to the other members of human MRP family such as MRP4, MRP5, MRP8
and MRP9 [63,65-67].
The NBD size and organization in the MRPs of the Plasmodium spp. studied were similar to those described in other
organisms. A high level of similarity was observed in multiple sequence alignments, in particular within the NBDs
with the exception of a large, non conserved insertion of
approximately 103 amino acids in NBD1 (from position
961 to 1110 in the multiple sequence alignment) (Figure
3, Additional file 3). Characteristic NBD motifs such as
the Walker A, Q loop, ABC motif, Walker B, D loop and
the H loop were found within the NBDs (Figure 3). All of
the characteristic motifs were identified with the excep-

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/1

tion of the H loop in NBD1. This NBD is unique in the
sense that there is an insertion between the ABC motif and
the Walker B motif. This insertion was present in all the
Plasmodium MRP sequences studied. The Walker B motif
and the D loop were identified after this large insertion in
the multiple sequence alignment. The location and
sequence of the Walker B motif in the region following the
insertion is similar to that described as the Walker B in
pfMRP1 [30]. The D loop could not be identified in the
MRP NBD2 in all the Plasmodium species studied (Figures
2 and 3). The failure to identify the H loop in NBD1 and
the D loop in NBD2 may be due to a lack of conservation
in the sequences encompassing these motifs in Plasmodium. Both the H loop and the D loop have structural
functions within the NBD although their precise role in
the molecular mechanism is not clear. The H-loop histidine contacts the bound nucleotide and the D loop may
form a hydrogen bond with the Walker A backbone
[13,68]. Remarkably, the sequences characteristic of an
ABC transporter NBD were highly conserved among the
Plasmodium species studied but these are not strictly conserved when compared to the consensus sequences
described for these motifs in vertebrates (Table 2).
The structure and function of MRP2 genes in Plasmodium
has not been described. In neoplastic cells as well as in
Leishmania, gene duplication and/or overexpression correlate with the drug resistant phenotype [69,70]. In this
study, the pbmrp gene was shown to have has similar gene
organization and the same gene copy number in both the
drug sensitive N clone and the CQ selected RC line (Figure
5). In addition, this gene was not differentially expressed
at an mRNA level between these two lines (Figure 7).
However, amplification or increased expression might
have been lost upon removal of drug pressure given that
RC line was not under continuous CQ pressure in these
experiments. In primary cultures of rat brain endothelial
cells treated with dexamethasone, increased expression of
mrp2 at the mRNA and protein level was detected in a concentration dependent manner. This increase in expression
was reversible in the absence of drug pressure [71]. In a
CQ selected P. falciparum clone, an increase in the size of
chromosome 3 was observed with increased CQ pressure
as a result of DNA amplification whereas removal of CQ
selection resulted in the return of chromosome 3 to its
original size [72]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms
within pfmrp1 have been associated with anti-malarial
resistance in field isolates [5,6,32]. Nevertheless, mutations within pbmrp may also contribute to the CQ drug
resistance phenotype.
The pbmrp locus was mapped to chromosome 13/14 in
the drug sensitive N clone. Similarly, synteny analysis
between the P. falciparum and the P. y. yoelii genome indicate that pymrp is located in chromosome 14 [73]. How-

ever, a striking finding in our study was that unlike N
clone, the CQ selected line RC exhibited a chromosomal
translocation of this gene to chromosome 8 (Figure 6). In
a CQ resistant P. falciparum isolates subjected to mefloquine selection and constant drug pressure, pfmdr1, a
member of the ABCB transporter sub-family, was amplified resulting in an increase in size of chromosome 5 [74].
A partial chromosomal duplication of the region containing the mdr1 gene was described in a Plasmodium chabaudi
line selected for a stable mefloquine-resistance, where a
second copy was translocated from chromosome 12 to
chromosome 4 [75]. Pyrimethamine selection of a P.
chabaudi line resulted in the duplication of the DHFR gene
and a rearrangement of chromosome 7 [76]. The detection of pbmrp solely in chromosome 8 in the RC line and
the fact that this chromosome appears to be of similar size
as its counterpart in the drug sensitive N clone support
that our observation is a translocation event without gene
duplication. Previous work mapped the pbggcs gene to
chromosome 8 in the P. berghei lines studied [54]. Cotransfection experiments in Leishmania with the genes for
PGPA and GGCS demonstrated that they work synergistically to confer resistance to antimony [77].

Additional material
Therefore, the relocation of the pbmrp gene to the same
chromosome of a potential linked gene, pbggcs, is intriguing and deserves further examination. It remains to be
established whether pbMRP transports anions such as
GSH, and/or GSH S-conjugates and whether it confers
resistance to any anti-malarials.

Conclusion
The P. berghei mrp gene was sequenced and compared to
homologues of this gene in other Plasmodium species and
organisms. Using bioinformatics the pbmrp gene was
found to have the highly conserved ABC motifs and was
classified as an ABCC/MRP2 type membrane transporter.
There were no differences in gene organization, copy
number, or level of expression when comparing a drug
sensitive and a CQ selected drug resistant P. berghei line. A
chromosomal translocation of the pbmrp gene from chromosome 13/14 to chromosome 8 was observed when
comparing the drug sensitive N clone and the CQ resistant
line RC.
The fact that some of these proteins are involved in the
drug resistance phenomenon in other species justifies further investigations on the potential contribution of ABC
transporters to anti-malarial resistance in Plasmodium. The
results of this study justify the examination of the role of
the Plasmodium berghei multidrug resistance associated
protein in Plasmodium detoxification pathways. Future
research on membrane transport mechanisms and intracellular biochemical processes mediated by these trans-
