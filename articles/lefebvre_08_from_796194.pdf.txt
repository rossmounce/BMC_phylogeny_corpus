Abstract
Background: Although much research has been carried out into European Reticulitermes
taxonomy in recent years, there is still much discussion about phylogenetic relationships. This study
investigated the evolution from intra- to interspecific phylogeny in the island subspecies
Reticulitermes lucifugus corsicus and threw new light on this phenomenon. An integrative approach
based on microsatellites and mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences was used to analyze
samples taken from a wide area around the Tyrrhenian sea and showed how the subspecies evolved
from its origins to its most recent form on continental coasts.
Results: According to mitochondrial phylogeny and molecular clock calculations, island and
continental taxa diverged significantly by vicariance in the Pleistocene glacial period. However,
more recently, numerous migrations, certainly human-mediated, affected the structure of the
populations. This study provided evidence of direct hybridization and multiple introgressions which
occurred in several hybrid areas. Analysis using STRUCTURE based on microsatellite data
identified a population in Provence (France) which differed considerably (Fst = 0.477) from
populations on the island of Corsica and in Tuscany in the Italian peninsula. This new population,
principally distributed in urban areas, is highly heterogeneous especially within the ITS2 regions
where homogenization by concerted evolution does not appear to have been completed.
Conclusion: This study provides an unusual picture of genetic interaction between termite
populations in the Tyrrhenian area and suggests that more attention should be paid to the role of
introgression and human impact on the recent evolution of European termites.

Background
The entomologist P. Rossi [1] described the first subterra-

nean termite species in Tuscany in 1792. The Reticulitermes
lucifugus species was first called Termes lucifugum and for a

long time was the only recognized species in Europe.
Since then, extensive studies of the Reticulitermes genus in
this region have shown the existence of six sibling species
and a Tyrrhenian subspecies [2]. The precise classification
of taxonomic groups is still of current interest and a matter of priority firstly for economic reasons and the need to
define urban pests and secondly, of more fundamental
importance, to reveal more information about the phylogenetic and biogeographical relationships in the genus [310].

onies on the continent. This sympatric existence, in which
hybridization is possible, can be considered as a real window on evolutionary processes [19,20] in the Reticulitermes genus. This area contains populations of termites
that could possibly shed light on the past and recent evolution of the species complex, from the first speciation
events to possible hybridization. More than two centuries
after Rossi's discovery, Tuscany could once more be a
region that may provide useful information for the study
of European termites.

Reticulitermes lucifugus corsicus, a subspecies of a European
subterranean termite [2], is a species that may help to
explain current issues. Although it was established that
these termites lived exclusively on islands, recent studies
have found the species on the mainland, in Tuscany (Uva
et al. found the species in two urban areas [8] and Marini
and Montovani found it in one urban area [4]) and in Provence [this study]. The hitherto unsuspected presence of
the species on the continent raises certain questions about
the characteristics specific to the Corsican termite, in particular its actual taxonomic status and the way in which it
migrated to the continent. Its distribution across Tuscany
and interaction with Italian termites need to be studied.

This phylogeographic study in the Tyrrhenian area reveals
how the island Reticulitermes lucifugus corsicus termite
evolved, from its origins to its recent appearance in continental coastal areas. An integrative approach was used to
clarify the phylogenetic relationship with the Italian R.
lucifugus termite and to detect any hybrid forms, using various genetic markers [21], such as mitochondrial and
nuclear DNA sequences, and several microsatellite
regions. These markers have different mutation rates and
can, therefore, provide information about evolutionary
events on different time scales.

R. lucifugus corsicus has still not been clearly defined and is
known from subsidiary descriptions in general publications [2,11,12]. As it is closely related to the Italian subspecies and as there is no evidence of reproductive
isolation between the two taxa, R. lucifugus corsicus has
been classified as an endemic subspecies of the islands of
Corsica and Sardinia. Biometric data clearly puts the Corsican termites closer to continental R. lucifugus and only
quantitative differences can be noted from chemical data
– defensive secretions of the soldiers [13] and cuticular
hydrocarbon proportions [2,14]. Only the yellow color of
the tibia of reproductives is a significant morphological
indicator of their Corsican origin, distinguishing them
from R. lucifugus [2]. The best identification method
remains the comparison of DNA sequences [3,4,8], as
mitochondrial or nuclear haplotypes clearly distinguish
the two taxa.
These characteristic differences probably developed after
isolation on the islands and confirm that the taxon is
endemic. However, it is difficult to date accurately at what
stage R. lucifugus corsicus diverged from the Italian R. lucifugus. The geological history of the area is very complex
[15-17]. The main hypothesis put forward by Plateaux
and Clément [18], later supported by Uva et al. [8] and
Luchetti et al. [5] is that the speciation event dates from
the last glaciation period with a classic scenario of vicariance and post-glacial colonization. Any questions about
the biogeographical history of the island subspecies can
be answered by studying the development of termite col-

Results
Phylogeny based on mitochondrial genes
The COII sequences of 60 samples (except Vitrolles B; see
Table 1 and Figure 1) were aligned and no length polymorphism was detected. Forty-four of the 677 base pairs
(bp) were variable and 35 were parsimony-informative.
Phylogenetic analyses performed on 54 samples either
with maximum parsimony (MP) (not shown; CI = 0.928,
RI = 0.988) or with Neighbor-Joining (NJ) methods (Figure 2) gave the same topology. Two major clades were
supported by high bootstrap values of 95% and 100%
respectively. They correspond to the lucifugus (L) and corsicus (C) taxa matching sequences already in Genbank
[4,5] and used for this study (Table 1). Twenty-one private
substitutions distinguished the first two groups (p-distance = 0.0347, Table 2). The Sicilian sequences (Palermo
and Agrigento) form a third clade (S) with the same
degree of divergence from the L and C clades (Table 2).
Twenty-two nucleotides separated the consensus
sequence of the L clade, 20 compared to Rosarno (Calabre, South Italy) and 26 compared to Viareggio (Tuscany,
Italy).

Several haplotypes were identified in the two main clades
in this study, supported by bootstraps higher than 60%.
Therefore, with only two subgroups (C1 and C2) found in
many different localities, clade C had lower genetic variability than clade L (sequence diversity within clade C =
0.001750 vs. clade L = 0.003148, Table 2). The haplotype
C2 was the most common. It was found on all the Tyrrhenian islands (including Elba) as well as in several samples
from Provence and Tuscany which, a priori, were geo-

graphically non-concordant (Vitrolles, Marseille-O, Uccelina, Follonica, Giannella). Similarly, the other Corsican
haplotype (C1) found in the Marseille-C sample could
possibly be a continental introduction or introgression.
Within clade L, termite colonies from Bastia were also
included in an unexpected group from Tuscany (L3) and
all the French colonies were linked with colonies from
Lazio, South Rome (L2 and some samples of L1).
Nuclear sequence analysis
The nuclear sequences (ITS2), which generally evolve
more slowly than the organelle genome [22,23], were far
less variable with only 3 nucleotides of the 372 that differentiate the two taxa (Figure 3). Colonies from Follonica,
Gianella, Uccelina (Tuscany, Italy) and Valle d'Alesani
(Corsica, France) were included in the 'lucifugus' clade,
which was contrary to their mitochondrial data. This was
also the case for the Castiglioncello colony (Tuscany,
Italy), which had a 'Corsican' nuclear haplotype. This lack
of concordance between nuclear and cytoplasmic genotypes could be an example of the asymmetrical introgression already described by Avise et al [24].

The nuclear data shows evidence of hybridization. Both
taxa (Marseille-A: R. lucifugus and Marseille-C: R. l. corsicus) were found in Marseille (Provence, France) as well as
a colony with a mix of both haplotypes for the same individual (Marseille-O, Figure 3). The sequence electropherogram (Figure 3) clearly revealed an overlap of the two
peaks corresponding to the private substitution of each
taxon at each variable site. The absence of noise in the
areas round these peaks excluded the possibility of artefacts [25]. This was not an isolated case in Provence
(Vitrolles-A). Other colonies in Provence had even more
complex forms, either with a crossing-over type mutation
on the third diagnostic locus (Marseille-B, Martigues, Plan
de Cuques, Venelles) or the insertion of a microsatellite
repeat (Vitrolles-B) (Figure 3).
Microsatellite analysis
Five microsatellite loci were analyzed. Heterozygosis was
often low (Mean Ho = 0.16) with a mean of 3.83 alleles
per locus (Additional file 1). These microsatellite regions
were identified in phylogenetically distant Reticulitermes
species [26] and seemed to have lower diversity in the
Transtyrrenian specific complex. However, analysis of this
data using structure [27] revealed significant differences

between the populations. It can be difficult to determine
the population structure of termites in a sample [28,29]
and so the number of populations was estimated using
our own biological appreciation [30]. Using the probable
estimated values ln P (X|K) and the graphic results (Figure

such as Valle d'Alesani (Corsica), Vitrolles-A and Marseille-O (Provence). Based on these results, the genetic differentiation between the three populations was calculated
using F-statistics (Table 3). It appears that all the populations are highly distant to each other (Fst > 0.25). The
population related to R. l. corsicus is the most differentiated population (mean Fst = 0,534), but, among R. lucifugus taxon, the Provencal population is also highly
separated to the Italian population (Fst = 0.265).

Discussion
lation in Provence, France. The Bastia colony (Corsica)
formed a separate cluster for K = 4 and particularly for K =
5. The Marseille-C colony was partly assigned to this Bastia group (Q4.moy = 0,237). Finally, by over-estimating K,
the program attributed colonies to populations. This
could indicate genetic variability within the R. lucifugus
peninsular group. However, this illustrated the homogeneity in the populations in the island samples (from Valle
d'Alesani to Ponte Leccia, and Elba), colonies that had
apparently been introduced (Bastia) and colonies in Provence (from St Rémy to Salon de Provence, and Marseille
A).
The results obtained using factorial correspondence analysis (FCA) also showed a similar distribution into 4 populations (Figure 5). Axis 1 (26.28%) distinguished R.
lucifugus from R. l. corsicus. A hybrid colony (Uccelina)
also appeared between the two groups. Axes 2 (12.42%)
and 3 (10.49%) separated R. lucifugus colonies into two
populations: one from Italy and one from Provence. Close
to these clusters, the Bastia colony formed a separate population which was much more similar to the population
in Italy. Finally, the lucifugus Italian group included colonies originating from unexpected geographical regions

Past evolution: Origins of endemism
The mitochondrial phylogeny shows that the Tyrrhenian,
Sicilian and mainland populations of Reticulitermes form
three clearly distinct clades with a high level of divergence.
The genetic distances between the island clades (C, S) and
the mainland clade (L) are similar (mean distance ≈
0.0350, Table 2). This suggests that the island populations
(C, S) have a comparable evolutionary history. Today,
very little is known about Sicilian populations of Reticulitermes. It would be interesting to investigate the level of
endemism of these populations to see whether they could
be considered as a subspecies, as has already been suggested [5].

The large number of mutations that have accumulated
between the three clades shows a long-term separation
without any interbreeding. The different hypotheses suggesting that all present-day European Reticulitermes taxa
started to diverge from different southern Ice Age refugia
[2,5,7,8,12,18] confirmed the postglacial colonization
routes described by Taberlet et al. [31] and Hewitt [20].
More recently, Luchetti et al. suggested that Corsican and
Sicilian populations differentiated later from the peninsular populations during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)

seems relatively recent in comparison to species-level differences observed in other taxa from these areas [20].
Some endemic taxa of the island of Corsica would have
started to diverge from 0.01 to 0.08 Myr for mammals
[33-35] and from 1.2 to 2.7 Myr for insects [36,37]. Many
Corsican taxa may also have originated from the Messinian period (5 Myr) and earlier [38,39]. To justify the high

rate of substitution seen in European Reticulitermes populations, Luchetti et al. argued that the social and geographical structure of populations could significantly increase
the mtDNA substitution rate [32,40]. But the calibration
of the molecular clock used by the authors and based on
a geological event could also be questionable. Indeed, several marine regressions occurred in the early Pleistocene
[15] which would have led to many junctions-disjunc-

tions between the Tyrrhenian islands and the mainland.
In our view, it is so possible that the present-day European
Reticulitermes taxa have older origins than previously
thought.
It is, however, difficult to determine whether dispersion or
vicariance play a greater role in cladogenic events [41,42].
The geological history of the Transtyrrhenian area is
highly complex [16,17] and does not support any particular theory. As mentioned above, many species of the Tyrrhenian area have different evolutionary and
biogeographical histories. The possibility of an insular
colonization from Tuscany after post-glacial expansion

through the Italian peninsula has also been suggested
[32]. Furthermore, the high level of genetic homogeneity
(mitochondrial, nuclear and also microsatellite loci)
observed in termite populations in Corsica could be the
result of a founding effect initiated by a migratory and colonizing event. The endemic origin of R. l. corsicus is also a
possibility, with ancestral origins from an isolated population in an Ice Age refugium. Thus, each taxon would
have been separated from taxa from different refuges (in
South Italy, in Sicilia, and somewhere in Corsica or in
Sardania). This could explain why the three clades have
almost the same number of substitutions (about 20 nucleotides) and consequently the same divergence time. As
the Corsican mitotype is closer to the Calabran (19 nucleotides) than to the Tuscan (23 nucleotides), the populations in Corsica and Sardinian may have started to diverge
before recolonization of Italy.

The expansion on the continent is confirmed by mitochondrial and microsatellite data. Colonization was slow
and may have lasted several thousand years. At the mitotype level, this expansion through the Italian peninsula
generated a South/North cline, already reported by Uva et
al. [8]. The expansion rate was probably the same as for
the Iberian Reticulitermes, as the divergence times are sim-

ilar [6]. Moreover, subterranean termites disperse over
short distances in natural conditions. For these reasons,
Italian recolonization by R. lucifugus could correspond to
a 'phalanx' expansion mode [43]. The microsatellite data
(Figure 4) shows a clear allelic diversity, specific to continental populations (island-continental model [44]).
However, with the exception of the Provencal area, the
colonies form a homogeneous entity. This unusual structure could be attributed to a bottleneck event during the
post-glacial colonization, particularly when crossing the
Ligurian Alps. The mitochondrial haplotypes, similar to
those in Rome could also suggest a more recent introduc-

Recent evolution: Introductions, hybridization and
introgression
In the more recent past, since 2000 BC, human civilization developed considerable marine traffic in the Tyrrhenian region. It is therefore highly probable that colonies
of Reticulitermes were introduced into unexpected zones
by human transport [2]. This kind of event has already
been documented – R. lucifugus in Bordeaux (France)
(personal communication Bagnères.), R. grassei in Devon
(UK) ([45] and personal communication Bagnères), R.
santonensis in Hamburg (Germany) and Santiago (Chile)
[2], and R. urbis in France and Italy ([7] and Bagnères et al.,
unpublished results). Three colonies -Bastia, Viareggio
and Marseille-C- appear to have been introduced. Of
these, the colony in Bastia is of particular interest as it
forms an entity, neither entirely Provencal (Figure 4, run
2) nor entirely Italian (Figure 4, runs 1 and 3). The two
other introduced colonies may have crossed with autochtonous populations, as shown by traces of allochtonous
genes in the microsatellite data.

More generally, migrations in the Tyrrhenian region have
created different hybrid zones. They resemble the bimodal
zones described by Jiggins and Mallet [46] and are characteristic of a quasi-absence of direct intermediate forms.
Only the Uccelina-O colony has F1-type hybrids. Nevertheless, there are signs of varying degrees of hybridization
in colonies such as the presence of unexpected genotypes.
Other authors [4,5,8] suggested that some hybrid zones
were situated in natural areas in the Tuscany pine-woods.
This study did in fact find some introgressive forms in Tuscan colonies – Parco del Uccelina, Reserve of Follonica,
Castiglioncello and Gianella – with conflicting mitochondrial and nuclear haplotype data (Table 4). Although
most of these Tuscan colonies have an allochtonous mitotype, introgression seems to act in both directions.
Indeed, termites in Castiglioncello have Corsican nuclear
sequences with an Italian mitotype. The fixation of allochtonous haplotypes can occur through backcrossing to the
parental populations [21,47] or can be helped by biased
sex-ratios already observed in Reticulitermes lucifugus
[48,49].
On the opposite shore, the persistence of Corsican microsatellite alleles in the Follonica sample (Tuscany) and the
presence of microsatellite alleles characteristic of Tuscany
along the East coast of Corsica (Solenzara, Valle d'Alesani)
could also indicate relatively recent hybridizations. In
general, these traces of hybridization tend to diminish
and even disappear by backcross with local populations.

In Southern France, the Provence region may be a specific
new hybrid zone. Among the multiple copies of the ITS2
gene, some colonies (Figure 3) have a mix of haplotypes
from the two origins, several forms of which come from
DNA recombination. However, no signs of hybridization
can be detected with microsatellite markers. Perhaps a
higher number of microsatellite markers is required to
improve detection of hybrid individuals [50]. The numerous variants in the sample may result from mechanisms
such as unequal crossing-over and gene conversion during
the concerted evolution, which may have homogenized
the number of rDNA copies [51,52]. ITS sequence homogenization by concerted evolution has already been
observed in a species of subterranean termites Coptotermes
gestroi (Rhinotermitidae) by Jenkins et al [53]. The concerted evolution might currently be slow [54], and in the
end slower than microsatellite loci homogenization by
backcross or by genetic drift. This might explain why no
apparent signs of hybridization are found in Provence.
Nevertheless, current results do not exclude the possibility
that these different forms come from an ancestral polymorphism, but the presence of both Corsican mitotype
and Italian nuclear haplotypes in the Vitrolles A colony
(Table 4) clearly supports the theory of a hybrid origin of
ITS2 mixed forms.
The Provence region appears quite different from Tuscany
and Corsica. Firstly, there is a distinct population entity,
which is different from the Italian R. lucifugus and R. l. corsicus groups (Figures 4 and 5). Secondly, most of the colonies sampled were collected from urban areas (Figure 1).
Thirdly, there are genetic particularities (mixed forms for
ITS genes) not found anywhere else in the data (Figure 3).
This raises the questions of whether these characteristics
are correlated and whether the urban environment influences the termites' adaptation process and the evolution
of hybrids.

Conclusion
Reticulitermes lucifugus corsicus is one of the best-described
subspecies of termite, defined by its distribution (Corsica,
Sardinia, Elba and some continental localities), by various
taxonomic criteria (genetic, morphological and chemical)
and also by this complex phyletic evolution (see also the
subspecies of Reticulitermes speratus [10]). Its divergence
goes back to cladogenic events during the Ice Age. However, owing to many migratory events, the evolution of
transtyrrhenian populations of termites has been more
complex. The study carried out in the area revealed the
existence of three very different populations (FST = 0.477,
Table 3): one population on the Italian peninsula (Tuscany), a second in the Tyrrhenian islands (Corsica) and a
third in Provence. With the Sicilian phylum, they form
strong cladistic units, constituting a complex of species
within R. lucifugus. Although hybrids occur, it seems that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/38

systematic homogenization of the genomes occurs subsequently. With a few intermediate forms and even some
introgressive forms, these taxa may maintain an identity
signature, and may finally be on the way to speciation.
Nevertheless, evidence of introgression in hybrid zones
could influence how Reticulitermes adapt. Allowing horizontal transfers of the genetic material, better adapted
forms could appear in some small populations [21]. The
colonies sampled in this study are small and patchily distributed in pinewood areas, especially in anthropized
environments and could, therefore, fulfill the conditions
necessary for such adaptation. From this point of view, it
is important to consider the Reticulitermes as urban pests
and study how they are adapting to cities – as for urban
colonies in Provence. After thousands of years of speciation under paleogeographical constraints, human impact
[2,5,55,56]-urbanism, maritime transport, and accidental
infestations-seems to be the determining element in
recent Reticulitermes evolution.

Methods
Sampling
Various Reticulitermes samples from the Tyrrhenian region
were analyzed. Some samples had been collected recently
in Corsica (France) and Tuscany (Italy), others came from
old collections that had been kept in a laboratory (Uva
1999) or from ad hoc donations. Of the 61 collection sites
detailed in Table 1, 42 were in natural areas near pinewoods and 19 were from infested urban sites. A transect
was taken in Uccelina (Tuscany). A hundred specimens
from each colony were stored in 96% alcohol for genetic
analyses. Further information on the samples is given in
Table 1 and the sites are shown on a map in Figure 1.
DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing
Total DNA was extracted from a single termite preserved
in alcohol, using a modified version of the method
described by Kocher et al. [57]. PCR amplification was
performed using a Biometra 96 T1 thermal cycler or a
Stratagene robocycler Gradiant 96. Different programs
and amplification conditions were used depending on the
types of primers used for sequencing or microsatellite
analyses (Additional file 2).

Two types of sequencing commonly used to study the
phylogeny of the Reticulitermes genus were used – mitochondrial sequences – cytochrome oxydase II gene (COII)
[3,6,58]- and nuclear sequences – the ITS2 region (internal transcribed spacer) of the ribosomal DNA [6,45,58]
(Additional file 2). Amplified DNA was purified using the
Quiagen-PCR purification kit and sequenced in both
directions. Each sequence generated by this study was
deposited in GenBank database (the accession numbers
are given in Table 1).

Phylogenetic analysis
Multiple consensus sequences were aligned using the
Clustal W algorithm [59] from the BIOEDIT 7.0.1
sequence editor [60] and corrected manually. Phylogenetic analyses of this data were performed using MEGA
3.0 [61]. DNA sequences were first analyzed using the
neighbor-joining (NJ) method [62] on Kimura 2-parameter distances [63]. Maximum parsimony (MP) analyses
were then conducted using a heuristic search method with
100 repeats and tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) with
all characters unordered and unweighted. R. santonensis
was chosen as the outgroup. Node support was estimated
by searching on 1000 non parametric bootstrap replicates
[64].
Microsatellite genotyping
Ten termites from 36 Corsican and Tuscan colonies
(including the Uccelina transect) were genotyped at six
microsatellite loci previously isolated in the species R. flavipes [65] and R. santonensis [26](Additional file 1). PCR
products were separated by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels run on a LI-COR 4000 L sequencer. Alleles
were scored using Gene Profiler 4.03 (Scanalytics, Inc.).

A factorial correspondence analysis (FCA) was then performed using genetix 4.05.2 software to classify the populations in different clusters [66]. genepop was used to
calculate Fst values between the different clusters defined
by the AFC [67]. STRUCTURE was then used for the
genetic identification of clustered populations, allogenous introductions and potential admixed colonies [27].
This software uses a model-based clustering method to
infer population structure using multiloci genotypes. Each
individual in the colony was probabilistically assigned to
K populations. Runs of various lengths were performed
with different numbers of genetic clusters (K), testing all
values of K from 2 to 7. Because the populations could
potentially hybridize, the admixture model [27] provided
by the software was used.
