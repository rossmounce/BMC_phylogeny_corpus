Abstract
Background: Halophilic bacteria have shown their significance in industrial production of polyhydroxyalkanoates
(PHA) and are gaining more attention for genetic engineering modification. Yet, little information on the genomics
and PHA related genes from halophilic bacteria have been disclosed so far.
Results: The draft genome of moderately halophilic bacterium, Halomonas sp. TD01, a strain of great potential for
industrial production of short-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), was analyzed through computational
methods to reveal the osmoregulation mechanism and the evolutionary relationship of the enzymes relevant to
PHA and ectoine syntheses. Genes involved in the metabolism of PHA and osmolytes were annotated and studied
in silico. Although PHA synthase, depolymerase, regulator/repressor and phasin were all involved in PHA metabolic
pathways, they demonstrated different horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events between the genomes of different
strains. In contrast, co-occurrence of ectoine genes in the same genome was more frequently observed, and
ectoine genes were more likely under coincidental horizontal gene transfer than PHA related genes. In addition,
the adjacent organization of the homologues of PHA synthase phaC1 and PHA granule binding protein phaP was
conserved in the strain TD01, which was also observed in some halophiles and non-halophiles exclusively from gproteobacteria. In contrast to haloarchaea, the proteome of Halomonas sp. TD01 did not show obvious inclination
towards acidity relative to non-halophilic Escherichia coli MG1655, which signified that Halomonas sp. TD01
preferred the accumulation of organic osmolytes to ions in order to balance the intracellular osmotic pressure with
the environment.
Conclusions: The accessibility of genome information would facilitate research on the genetic engineering of
halophilic bacteria including Halomonas sp. TD01.

Background
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) were firstly discovered in
prokaryotes as carbon and energy storage materials [1].
They are one of the most promising members of biodegradable polymers, which are considered as environmentally friendly substitutes of petrochemical-derived
plastics [2]. Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) was the earliest commercially available product. However, poly(3hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) possessed
more favourable thermomechanical properties for wider
applications as medical materials (sutures and bonenails/pins), films products (mulch films, shopping bags
and compost bags), disposable items (pens and tableware) and packaging materials (especially for food
packaging) than PHB [3]. As the market for green plastics has been growing rapidly, demand for a more productive and low cost PHA production process is evident
[1]. Although some microorganisms, such as Ralstonia
eutropha and genetically engineered Escherichia coli,
were thoroughly investigated as PHA industrial producers with high productivity, the research and development of strains and methods with further reduced cost
were still necessary for PHA commercialization [3-6].
Halophiles are referred to some organisms, which are
able to grow optimally in 5% (w/v) and survive in no
less than 10% salt medium [7,8]. Halophiles have shown
advantages for lowering fermentation costs for PHB and
PHBV production, thus gaining attention from many
researchers. As early as 1972, PHA granules were
detected in a haloarchaea Haloarcula marismortui, and
then numerous halophiles were identified as producers
to accumulate PHB or PHBV [7]. Halophiles were
widely spread in the three domains of life: archaea, bacteria, and eukarya [7]. According to the optimal growth
concentration of salt tolerated by cells, they could be
roughly divided into two groups, moderate and extreme
halophiles [9]. Recently, the application of some halophiles for PHA production and copolymer characterization were evaluated [4,7,10,11]. The application of
halophiles as PHA producers significantly reduced the
costs of fermentation and recovery processes: high salt
concentrations were able to minimize the possibility of
contamination by non-halophilic microorganisms, and
thus the cost and energy consumption for sterilization
can be decreased; haloarchaeal cells were able to be
lyzed conveniently through osmotic shock treatment
with salt-deficient water, and thus the cost for polymers
recovery also can be decreased [12]. Moreover, the residual salt in the broth post-fermentation, could be concentrated and recycled, which circumvents
environmental problems from the exhaust of waste products and further lowered the production cost [7].
When hydrolyzed whey was used as carbon source, the

Page 2 of 15

cost for the production of P(3HB-co3HV) by Haloferax
mediterranei was about 30% lower than that for the production of PHA by recombinant E. coli [7]. Our recent
study showed a new isolated halophilic strain termed
Halomonas sp. TD01, has great potential for PHA production, accumulating over 80 wt% PHB under a continuous fermentation process without sterilization [13].
PHA synthases, the crucial enzymes for PHA biosynthesis, have received more attention for elucidating
their characteristics in these microorganisms. PHA
synthases were classified into four groups according to
their substrate specificities and subunits organization
[1]. Although class I and II PHA synthases comprise
enzymes consisting exclusively of one PhaC subunit,
they prefer to synthesize short chain length (3-5 carbon
atoms) and medium chain length (6-14 carbon atoms)
PHA, respectively. Class III and IV PHA synthases comprise enzymes consisting of two different types of subunits, PhaC and PhaE (III) or PhaR (IV, such as that in
Bacillus megaterium) subunits; both of them prefer to
utilize CoA thioesters to produce short chain length
PHA [1]. The study on PHA synthases isolated from
PHA accumulating halophiles began with the characterization of PhaC from Halopiger aswanensis, which
showed some interesting properties including high thermostability, narrow substrate specificity and tolerance
against high salt concentration [14]. A novel subclass of
PhaCs was proposed through systematic and detailed
studies on the PHA synthases from haloarchaea, which
were in high similarity with the class III enzymes from
bacteria [15]. However, the H. mediterranei PhaC subunit was larger, and the PhaE subunit was smaller than
its bacterial counterparts [16].
Osmoregulatory mechanisms of halophiles against the
high salt concentration condition were typically divided
into two strategies: extreme halophiles, i.e. halophilic
archaea, were able to absorb KCl to balance the osmotic
pressure discrepancy across the cytoplasmic membrane;
most moderate halophiles were able to accumulate
osmolytes (compatible solutes), which mainly consisted
of organic compounds with low molecular weight,
including amino acids, amino acid derivatives, sugars,
and other polyols [17]. Organic compounds did not
notably disturb the essential metabolism for cell survival,
and protected proteins by mitigating detrimental effects
of freezing, drying and high temperatures [8]. Ectoine is
one of the most widespread osmolytes, which are also
well known as commercial protectants for enzymes,
DNA and whole cells [18].
In this study, the draft genome of the moderately
halophilic bacterium Halomonas sp. TD01 was obtained
and analyzed. Several genes relevant to PHA and osmolytes biosynthesis were elucidated and phylogenetically

analyzed. Moreover, the predicted proteome was analyzed and compared with that of other species. The
results provided invaluable clues, not only to the understanding of the evolution and genes transfer, but also to
the strategic guidance of the genetic engineering of
halophilic Halomonas sp. TD01 for co-production of
PHA and ectoine.

Methods
Strain and genome DNA preparation

Halomonas sp. TD01 was isolated from a salt lake in
Xinjiang, China, and grown optimally in glucose mineral
medium under 5% (w/v) NaCl and pH 9.0 [13]. And it
was deposited in China General Microbiological Culture
Collection Center (CGMCC No.4353). To construct the
insert libraries for sequencing, high-quality total cellular
DNA was prepared with the help of the E.Z.N.A. bacterial DNA kit (Omega Bio-Tek Inc. USA).
Sequencing strategy

Two random genomic DNA libraries with insert sizes of
500 and 2,530 base pairs (bp) were constructed, respectively.
The sequencing of these libraries was carried out following
the Solexa sequencing protocols (Illumina, Inc. USA) in the
Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI, Beijing, China). Eliminating the low-quality results and adapter contamination, raw
data was assembled into contigs and scaffolds with SOAPdenovo software (v1.04, BGI, Beijing, China).
Genome annotation

Glimmer 3.0 software [19] was adopted to predict genes
de novo. For annotation, the alignments of predicted proteins against databases, including KEGG [20], COG [21],
Swiss-Prot [22], TrEMBL [23] and nr (at NCBI, National
Center for Biotechnology Information), were carried out
with the program blastall (version 2.2.21) [24]. Genes
encoding transfer RNA (tRNA) and their secondary structure were predicted using tRNAscan [25]. Genes encoding
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were predicted through RNAmmer [26] or homologous comparison. Genes encoding
other RNA, including microRNA (miRNA), small RNA
(sRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) were predicted
by Rfam [27]. Transposons were identified through
RepeatMasker and RepeatProteinMasker [28].
After the assembly, global guanine-cytosine composition of the whole non-redundant sequence was calculated with the in-house program (BGI, Beijing, China).
The predicted open reading frames (ORFs) inferred by
Glimmer were also counted for GC content and length
distribution.
Promoter and signal peptide prediction

The promoter, including -35, -10 and transcription start
site (TSS) regions, were predicted through Neural

Page 3 of 15

Network Promoter Prediction [29] and Sequence Alignment Kernel [30] methods. The signal peptide for
secreted proteins was predicted by SignalP [31].
Multiple sequences alignments and identification of
protein motifs

Multiple alignments of predicted proteins with conserved sequences were performed with Constraint-based
Multiple Alignment Tool (COBALT) [32] at NCBI. Conserved motifs were identified by searching sequences
against the COG database.
Evolutionary and phylogenetic analysis

The distances between conserved sequences were calculated from the multiple alignments with ClustalW [33].
Neighbor-joining tree phylograms were constructed,
bootstrapped (500 replications), and drawn in MEGA
(version 5.03) [34].
With the evolutionary distances, the evolutionary pressures imposed on keeping any two genes in the genome
were inspected by computing a Pearson correlation
coefficient for any two genes. The missing genes (designated as “ND”) were useful in inspecting the co-evolutionary relationships, and usually defined as zero.
However, here, the smaller the evolutionary distance,
the closer a homologue is to the gene in TD01. To
make use of the missing genes, we transformed the evolutionary distances into similarity scores with e(-1*distance)
and defined the missing genes (ND) as zero, i.e. a
shorter distance relates to an increased similarity score.
Then a Pearson correlation coefficient was computed
for any two genes using the converted similarity scores.
Calculation of isoelectric point values

FASTA format protein sequences, either predicted from
Halomonas sp. TD01 or retrieved from NCBI were submitted to ExPASy Proteomics server (http://web.expasy.
org/compute_pi/). The isoelectric point (pI) distribution
of each strain was counted with an interval of 0.2 differences from 3 to 13.
Accession numbers

The draft genome assemblies for Halomonas sp.TD01
were submitted into the GenBank database; its accession
number was GenBank: AFQW00000000. Other accession numbers of the sequences involved in this study
are listed in Table 1 and Additional file 1, Table S1.

percentages of genome coverage were 102.64% and
99.56% based on k-mer analysis and reads comparison,
respectively. 3,894 Open Reading Frames (ORF) predicted by Glimmer had occupied 89.18% of the whole
assembled sequences. The GC content within coding
sequences was 53.23%, which was a little higher than
that of the whole sequences (52.57%). Most putative
proteins were distributed within the length ranges
between 200 and 300 amino acids (aa) (Additional file 2,
Figure S1). In addition, the putative proteins were classified according to the COG function (Additional file 3,
Figure S2A) and KEGG pathway (Additional file 3, Figure S2B). The comparison of the predicted protein
sequence set of Halomonas sp. TD01 with the nr database (NCBI) revealed its close relationship with Halomonas elongata DSM 2581, Chromohalobacter salexigens
DSM 3043 and Aromatoleum aromaticum EbN1.
Although the sequence of the scaffolds of Halomonas
sp. TD01 have not been confirmed, the alignment
between the chromosome of C. salexigens and the scaffolds of Halomonas sp. TD01 showed distinguishable
co-linearity (Additional file 4, Figure S3).
Identification and evolutionary analysis of PHA relevant
genes from Halomonas sp. TD01

The genes relevant to PHA were identified through
homologous alignments against the public annotation
databases, including KEGG, COG, Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL
and nr, using the BLAST program. As inferred from the
similarity results, there might be two putative genes
encoding PHA synthases (PhaC), three encoding PHA
depolymerases (PhaZ), one encoding phasin (PhaP) and
one encoding PHA synthesis repressor/regulator (PhaR,
which showed 45% identities with YP_725943 of Ralstonia eutropha H16) in the genome of halophilic PHBV
producing strain Halomonas sp. TD01 (Table 1). In
addition, although the putative PhaC1 shared only 19%

identity with PhaC2, both of them hit COG (clusters of
orthologous groups) 3243 in the conserved domain
database (CDD) at NCBI, implying that they belonged
to PHA synthases [35]. Similarly, all the three PhaZs
deduced from the genome of Halomonas sp. TD01
shared remarkably the same hits on COG3509 and
pfam10503 in CDD, which strongly proposed their functions as PHB depolymerases. Phylogenetic trees clearly
illustrated that the putative PhaZ, PhaP and PhaR from
Halomonas sp. TD01 had close relationships with the
corresponding, well-characterized enzymes from nonhalophiles, which presented clear, in silico evidence for
their function in PHA degradation and regulation (not
shown).
The evolutionary differences of PHA synthases between
archaeal-, bacterial- and non-halophiles were revealed by
phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1). PHA synthases are clustered into different groups (Figure 1). The PhaCs from
haloarchaea shared general features with class III
enzymes, forming a novel subclass; the PhaCs from halophilic bacteria were closer to class I enzymes [15]. PHA
synthases of class I and II appeared to originate from a
common ancestor, while synthases of class III and IV originated from an alternative common ancestor (Figure 1).
However, the common ancestor of putative PhaC2 from
strain TD01 and its homologues seemed relatively distant
from the well-characterized PHA synthases in the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1). Furthermore, the molecular
masses of putative PhaC2 and its homologues were
between 81 and 92 kDa, while the Class I enzymes are
usually between 61 and 73 kDa [1]. Revealed by the multiple alignments, the putative PhaC2 from Halomonas sp.
TD01 shared longer C-terminus with those homologues
from H. elongata DSM 2581, C. salexigens DSM 3043
and A. aromaticum EbN1 than that of the well-studied
classical class I PHA synthases (Figure 2). It is possible
that the longer C-terminus of the PhaC2 was important

for the function of PHA synthase at high salt concentration, which was observed in the haloarchaeal PhaC
[15,16]. However, their N-terminus, which proved quite
important for the function of classical PHA synthases
[36,37], was shorter than that of the well-studied classical
class I PHA synthases (Figure 2). Yet, enzymatic and
structural studies are required to determine whether the
putative PhaC2 from Halomonas sp. TD01 and its homologues are a novel subclass of PHA synthases. Although
there is still uncertainty about the classification of PhaC2
from Halomonas sp. TD01, PhaC1 from the strain TD01
exhibited relatively high similarities with the classical
class I PHA synthases. For example, PhaC1 from TD01
has high sequence similarity (44% and 34% sequence
identities with YP_725940 and YP_726471, respectively)
with the known class I PHA synthases from Ralstonia
eutropha H16 (Figure 1). The molecular mass of PhaC1
was about 70 kDa, which is within the common range of
well-studied class I enzymes [1]. In addition, the conserved lipase-like box residues were recognized in the
PhaC1 enzyme (Figure 2).

The detailed analysis through multiple sequences
alignments of putative PhaC1 and PhaC2 with their
homologues was performed. The most similar homologues of both PhaC1 and PhaC2 came from H. elongata
DSM 2581 (78%, 73% identities, respectively), C. salexigens DSM 3043 (67%, 67% identities, respectively) and
A. aromaticum EbN1 (48%, 69% identities, respectively)
(Additional file 5, Table S2). The multiple sequences
alignments showed strong conservation between these
protein sequences and the well-characterized PHA
synthases (Figure 2). The conserved lipase-like box residues were recognized in all of these proteins (Figure 2).
In addition, three residues (cysteine, aspartic acid and
histidine), composing the conserved catalytic triad of
PHA synthases, were also identified in these proteins
(Figure 2). However, it is interesting to find that, instead
of the traditional lipase-box pattern “GxCxG”, all PhaC1
homologues (listed in Figure 2, except for YP_159076
from non-halophilic A. aromaticum EbN1), have
“SxCxG”, and all the PhaC2 homologues (listed in Figure 2) have “GxCxA”. These interesting patterns may

imply the existence of a new class of PHA polymerases
among the halophilic bacteria. Yet, more experimental
data are needed to elucidate whether these patterns are
related to the hypersaline environments.
With the progress on the research of PhaCs from
halophiles, our vision on PHA synthesis in these strains
was amazingly broadened [38]. In contrast, few efforts
had been devoted to the studies on other enzymes
involved in PHA metabolism excluding PhaC. The putative PhaZ3 was supposed to be a secreted protein
through the prediction of signal peptides (Additional file
6, Figure S4), whereas the other two PHA depolymerases (PhaZ1 and PhaZ2) lack signal peptides and
may be responsible for the intracellular PHA
degradation.
Most of PHA relevant genes are scattered in the genome, except for the phaP and phaC1, which were connected with a space of 92 bp (Figure 3A). However, an
independent promoter of phaC1, with highly conserved
-35 and -10 binding sites for s70, was identified (Figure
3B). The -35 motif extended into the tail of phaP coding
region, and the putative transcription start site (TSS)
was 73 bp on the upstream of the translation start site
(TLS) of phaC1 gene (Figure 3B). The existence of an
independent promoter of phaC1 suggested the separated
regulation on the gene expression of phaP and phaC1.
It was understandable that phasins were usually
expressed in large quantities during PHA storage period,
whereas massive expression of PHA synthases was
required during synthesis period [39,40].
Osmoregulatory mechanisms of Halomonas sp. TD01
inferred from the genome information

The pI values provide simple indication of protein acidity. To compare the differences of protein acidity
between halophiles and non-halophiles, the pI distribution of representative proteome from halophilic

Page 7 of 15

bacterium Halomonas sp. TD01 and Halomonas elongata DSM 2581, halophilic arhaeon Haloarcula marismortui ATCC 43049 and non-halophilic E. coli
MG1655, was calculated with the interval of 0.2 pI from
3 to 13. Bimodal distribution of pI appears clearly on
the plot for each strain (Additional file 7, Figure S5).
Both acidic peaks of Halomonas sp. TD01 and H. elongata DSM 2581 were at 5.1, which were a little lower
than the non-halophilic E. coli MG1655 (at 5.5), but
much higher than the extremely halophilic archaeon H.
marismortui (at 4.3). While H. marismortui only showed
a small peak representing basic proteins, the other three
strains shared the distinct basic peaks at around pI 9.5.
The median pI values of Halomonas sp. TD01, H. elongata, H. marismortui and E. coli were 5.67, 5.51, 4.46
and 6.17, respectively, which displayed a similar pattern
with the pI distribution.
As moderate halophiles, accumulation of organic
osmolytes, instead of inorganic ions was supposed to be
the main strategy to deal with high osmotic environment [8]. So far, many organic solutes, characterized
with small molecule masses and fast turnover through
de novo synthesis or absorption from environment and
degradation, were identified to function as osmoregulators [41]. The genes relevant to betaine and ectoine, two
of the most widespread compatible solutes in nature,
were identified and annotated based on the genome
information of Halomonas sp. TD01. There were two
putative genes clusters encoding compatible solute
synthesis systems for betaine (betABI) and ectoine
(ectABC) (Table 1 and Additional file 8, Table S3). The
genes (doeABCD) involved in the degradation of compatible solutes were also discovered in the genome of
Halomonas sp. TD01 (Additional file 8, Table S3) [41].
In addition, five genes encoding the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type proline/glycine betaine transporters
(ProU) and eight genes encoding betaine/carnitine/

choline transporters (BCCT family) were identified
through the comparison with well-studied betaine transporters (Additional file 8, Table S3) [42]. The ABC-type
transporters generally showed broader substrate specificities than the ones belonging to the BCCT family [43].
In contrast, only one gene (teaA) encoding a homologue
of tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic transporters
(TRAP-T) for ectoine was unveiled (Additional file 8,
Table S3) [44]. Most of these osmolytes relevant genes
shared close similarities with the homologues from C.
salexigens and H. elongata, as revealed by evolutionary
analysis (Additional file 5, Table S2). These similarities
were also observed in their PHA relevant genes (Additional file 9, Figure S6) and 16S rDNA sequences (Figure 4) based phylogenetic analysis.
The evolutionary analysis of PHA and ectoine relevant
proteins from Halomonas sp. TD01

As revealed through the analysis of the osmoregulatory
mechanism, Halomonas sp. TD01 was possibly able to
synthesize ectoines with commercial interest as protectants against proteolysis [18]. The existence of PHA and
ectoine synthesis genes qualifies Halomonas sp. TD01 as a
candidate for the combined production of PHA and osmolytes [7]. Moreover, it was interesting to observe that many
species other than halophiles possessed both homologues
of putative PHA and ectoine relevant enzymes from Halomonas sp. TD01 (Additional file 1, Table S1). Based on the
evolutionary distances of 16S rDNA (Figure 4), PHA and
ectoine relevant protein sequences, Halomonas sp. TD01
shared closest relationship with Chromohalobacter salexigens DSM 3043 and Halomonas elongata DSM 2581,
which were also known as halophilic bacteria and
belonged to the same family Halomonadaceae as the
strain TD01 (Additional file 5, Table S2). It was interesting
to find that, with regard to PHA relevant enzymes, similarities (the average evolutionary distance of PhaCs: 0.666)
between TD01 and rhizobia strains, which fix nitrogen
and are symbiotic with plant roots, were significant (Additional file 5, Table S2). The homologues of ectoine synthesis and PHA degradation (PhaZs) enzymes from
Halomonas sp. TD01 were present in some species
belonging to the class Actinobacteria, are a group of
Gram-positive bacteria with high G+C content (Additional
file 5, Table S2). In addition, it was noticed that only proteins from some g-proteobacteria species exhibited significant similarity with the PhaP from strain TD01
(Additional file 5, Table S2), which implies this PhaP possibly possesses a relative independent evolution pathway
in the g-proteobacteria. However, it seemed that the other
homologues of strain TD01 spread in a-, b-, g-proteobacteria (Additional file 5, Table S2), suggesting that PHA
and ectoine related enzymes from the halophilic strain
TD01 shared common ancestors with the non-halophiles.

The plots of evolutionary distances of PHA and
ectoine relevant enzymes versus that of 16S rDNA were
drawn with the aim of better understanding of the evolutionary relationship among these genes and 16S rDNA
(Figure 5). When the evolutionary distances of 16S
rDNA were lower than 0.15, there was an obvious colinearity between the evolutionary distances of 16S
rDNA and those of the ectoine relevant enzymes (Figure
5B). Yet, among the PHA relevant enzymes, only the
evolutionary distances of PhaC1 and PhaP showed some
co-linearity with those of 16S rDNA when the evolutionary distances of 16S rDNA were lower than 0.15
(Figure 5A). However, when the evolutionary distances
of 16S rDNA were higher than 0.15, the evolutionary
distances of PHA and ectoine relevant enzymes seemed
non-colinear with those of 16S rDNA (Figure 5).
Inferred from this non-colinearity, there may be extensive horizontal gene transfer of PHA and ectoine relevant genes between the ancestors of these species listed
in Additional file 1, Table S1. For example, although
Azotobacter vinelandii DJ was evolutionarily distant
from strain TD01, their phaC and phaR genes shared
significant similarities; the phaR genes of Achromobacter
piechaudii ATCC 43553, which was distantly related to
TD01 with respect to 16S rDNA sequences, shared significant similarities with that of TD01 (Additional file 5,
Table S2). Although PhaC, PhaP, PhaR, and PhaZ genes
were all involved in PHA metabolisms, they were under
different horizontal gene transfer (Figure 5A). The fact
that there were similar evolutionary distances of ectoine
genes from closely or distantly related genomes to Halomonas sp. TD01 (Figure 5B), may suggest that there
were also horizontal gene transfer of ectoine genes.
Mycobacterium smegmatis str. MC2 155 and Stackebrandtia nassauensis DSM 44728, for instance, were distantly related to strain TD01 based on 16S rDNA
sequences, they shared similar ectoine genes with that
of Halomonas sp. TD01 (Additional file 5, Table S2).
Moreover, there were some similarities between the
phylogenetic trees of 16S rDNA (Figure 4) and PHA,
ectoine relevant enzymes (Additional file 9, Figure S6),
especially for the closely related strains Halomonas elongata DSM 2581, Chromohalobacter salexigens DSM
3043. Although the sequence similarity of PHA and
ectoine relevant genes implies the existence of horizontal gene transfer events between different species, no
distinguishable transposable elements, which were identified through the RepeatMasker and RepeatProteinMasker [28], were found flanking these genes in the genome
of Halomonas sp. TD01 (Additional file 10, Table S4
and S5). There remained a challenge to disclose how
these genes transferred between the different species.
To further understand the functional relationships
between PHA and ectoine relevant enzymes, Pearson

Figure 5 Evolutionary analysis based on the 16S rDNA, PHA and ectoine relevant enzymes sequences. The evolutionary distances of 16s
rDNA, PHA (A) and ectoine (B) enzymes between Halomonas sp. TD01 and other strains were calculated from the multiple alignments with
ClustalW [33]. For each strain, the evolutionary distance of 16s rDNA was plotted on the X axis, and evolutionary distances of PHA (A) and
ectoine (B) relevant enzymes were plotted on the Y axis. The same enzyme of different species was linked, while broken lines indicated the
genes missing from the genomes of the corresponding strains (Additional file 1, Table S1).

correlation coefficient was calculated after the transformation of evolutionary distances, with the aim of illustrating the evolutionary pressure imposed to keep any
two genes in the genome. It was obvious that EctA,
EctB, EctC, and EctD were highly related to each other,
as they almost co-occur in the genome of all strains
investigated in this study, and the correlations of their

evolutionary distances to those in TD01 were very high
(Figure 6). This was in agreement with the fact that they
formed an operon in the genome of some strains, such
as Sphingomonas sp. SKA58 and Stackebrandtia nassauensis DSM 44728, etc (Additional file 1, Table S1).
In addition, as elucidated in the heatmap and cluster
dendrogram, PhaZ1, PhaZ2 and PhaZ3 were closely

related to each other, and all of them share distinct relationship with other PHA genes (Figure 6). Within these
three PHA depolymerases, PhaZ1 and PhaZ2 were more
closely related to each other than to PhaZ3, which was
in accordance to the fact that PhaZ1 and PhaZ2 were
putative intracellular depolymerases, whereas PhaZ3 was
putative extracellular depolymerase, as suggested by the
signal peptide prediction (Additional file 6, Figure S4).
Although PhaP seemed evolutionarily closer to ectoine
relevant enzymes, this was probably because it was
absent in 36 out of 44 strains (Additional file 1, Table
S1). More studies including both in silico and wetexperiment, should be implemented for further clarification of their relationships. As illustrated by Figure 6, it
seemed that there were not high evolutionary pressures
to keep PHA genes together in the same genome, and
whether to keep or lose certain PHA genes may be
dependent on specific environment of each strain. For
instance, Ralstonia eutropha H16, a ubiquitous inhabitant of soil and freshwater, suffers most from energy
limitation, and has been well adapted with the accumulation of high content PHA as carbon reservoir. Therefore, multiple PHA relevant genes were maintained in
its genome, whereas ectoine genes were missing as there
was no environmental pressure for the presence of
ectoines. This suggested that genetic engineering of single PHA related genes, such as knockout or addition of
PHA genes, may not have astonishing impacts on bacterial growth and PHA production, yet it may be necessary in order to achieve higher PHA production in some
strains, such as Halomonas sp. TD01. In contrast, the
evolutionary pressures to keep ectoine genes together in
the same genome were much higher (Figure 6),

suggesting these genes may all be necessary for ectoine
metabolism. Thus, inhibiting the expression of any of
the four ectoine genes may have a strong impact on the
ectoine biosynthesis and the survival in high osmotic
environments. This finding may help develop better
genetic engineering strategies for future production of
PHA and ectoine.

Discussion
So far, there have been relatively few studies on the
PHA synthases from halophilic microorganisms [7].
Recently, the detailed studies on the PHA synthases
from the halophilic archaea have extended our insights
on their classification, providing solid evidences to support the existence of a novel subclass (IIIA) synthases
with distinguished features from the subclass (IIIB) isolated from bacteria [15]. The widespread novel PHA
synthases in halophilic archaea consist of two subunits,
PhaC and PhaE, both of which are required for their
activities [38]. However, these novel PHA enzymes are
clustered separately from the ones isolated from the
halophilic bacteria, including Halomonas sp. TD01, H.
elongata, C. salexigens, and Halorhodospira halophila,
etc (Figure 1). As illustrated by the phylogenetic analysis, PHA synthases (especially the putative PhaC1) from
halophilic bacteria, shared the significant similarities
with class I enzymes, which were different from the
well-studied enzymes from halophilic archaea (Figure 1)
[7]. PhaCs in Halomonas sp.TD01 were able to synthesize PHB with a molecular weight of 600 kDa in fedbatch fermentation, which was in accordance with the
characteristics of class I PHA synthases [1,13]. The conserved catalytic residues, firstly discovered in the PHA

Cai et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10:88
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/1/88

synthases of Chromatium vinosum and R. eutropha,
were also recognized in PhaC1 and PhaC2 from Halomonas sp. TD01 (Figure 2), indicating that they share
similar catalytic mechanisms and substrate specificities
[7,45]. In addition, PHBV was detected when glucose
and propionic acid (or valeric acid) were supplemented
as carbon sources in the medium, which also agreed
with the features of class I synthases [13]. Under the
catalysis of putative PhaC1 and/or PhaC2, PHBV accumulation was able to reach 80 wt% of cell dry weight
consisting of 30% 3-hydroxyvalerate 3HV fraction when
supplemented with valeric acid as additional carbon
source, which qualified Halomonas sp. TD01 as a strain
of industrial interest for PHBV production [13]. Nevertheless, physiological and enzymatic characterization of
the PHA synthases from halophilic bacteria are still
required to elucidate whether the putative PhaC2 from
Halomonas sp. TD01 and its homologues form their
own class of PHA synthases, as implied by the phylogenetic studies and multiple sequences alignment of putative PhaC2 (Figure 2).
While PHA synthases from halophiles have received
attentions, the studies on PHA depolymerase, regulator/
repressor and phasin from halophiles, which also play
crucial roles in the PHA cycle, remained unclear [15].
Evolutionary analysis demonstrated that the PhaC,
PhaZ, PhaP, PhaR and ectoine relevant enzymes from
halophilic Halomonas sp. TD01 share close relationships
(the average evolutionary distance: 0.945) with those
from non-halophilic strains (Additional file 5, Table S2).
It is very clear that further systematic and detailed studies on these genes from halophiles would improve our
understanding on their functions and evolution, potentially leading to enhancing PHA production at reduced
costs. Moreover, genome-scale metabolic analysis would
also advance the progress of PHA production by halophiles [46].
The most well-known genetic organization of representative PHA synthases in class I was the phbCAB
operon from R. eutropha, containing genes encoding
PHA synthases, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase and 3hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase in sequence [1].
However, in Halomonas sp. TD01, phaC and phaA,
phaB genes were scattered throughout the genome
(Table 1, Additional file 8, Table S3). More interestingly,
the neighborhood genetic organization of the homologues of putative phaP and phaC1 from Halomonas sp.
TD01 was also conserved in both halophiles and nonhalophiles exclusively from g-proteobacteria, which can
imply that there may be extensive horizontal gene transfers between their ancestral strains, possibly suggesting a
same living environment in the past (Table 2). The
interval lengths between phaC1 and phaP genes varied
from 55 to 204 bp (Table 2). Most of these species were

Page 12 of 15

isolated from an aquatic (especially oceanic) environment, similar to the saline lake from where Halomonas
sp. TD01 was isolated [13]. It is possible that the horizontal gene transfer may have occurred in ancient
times, when the universal common ancestors of these gproteobacteria mentioned in Table 2 survived in the
same aquatic environment, leading to the acquisition of
adjacent phaP and phaC1 genes by the ancestor of
Halomonas sp. TD01. With the geological evolution, the
ancestors of these g-proteobacteria were then separated
into their present environments and the phaC1 and
phaP genes with their interval sequences evolved independently to their current status. The conservation of
adjacent organization could play an important role in
the regulation and metabolism of PHA cycles in g-proteobacteria, which deserves further study.
Wild-type cells require PHA synthesis and degradation
cycle to maintain carbon supply balance under changing
environments [2]. However, for industrial production of
PHA, degradation is not favored, because it leads to the
waste of carbon sources and consequently reduces PHA
accumulation [47,48]. For example, it has been reported
that the knockout of phaZ in P. putida KT2442 inhibited the decrease of PHA content during batch fermentation processes [47]. For Halomonas sp. TD01, the
presence of three putative PHA depolymerases likely
decreased PHA accumulation in batch fermentation processes (unpublished observations). Thus, identification of
these phaZ genes could help the intentional knockout of
PHA degradation pathways in Halomonas sp TD01, in
the hope of promoting more PHA accumulation. In
addition, distinguishing the intracellular (PhaZ1 and
PhaZ2) and extracellular (PhaZ3) depolymerases allow
the possibility to identify targets of most importance,
reducing the time and labor required for gene knockout.
To maintain the balance of osmotic pressure across
the cell membrane, high concentrations of ions or
organic osmolytes are accumulated in the cells [49].
Neutral proteins would become denatured in hypersaline condition, while acidic ones, with more negatively
charged amino acid residues on the surfaces, were able
to stay functional through the binding of hydrated salt
ions in the cytoplasm [50]. It was reported that the proteomes of extremely halophilic archaea, such as H. marismortui, showed a notable general tendency towards
acidity, which was illustrated by the pI distribution
(Additional file 7, Figure S5) [49]. Contrary to this, less
acidic proteomes from halophilic bacteria, including
Halomonas sp. TD01 and H. elongata, were observed
and implied their decreased dependence on the absorption of salt to maintain ionic balance in hypersaline
environments [51]. To survive in hypersaline conditions,
it was believed that halophilic Halomonas sp. TD01
adopted another universal strategy, accumulating

organic compatible solutes instead of inorganic ions to
balance the osmotic pressure with a surprisingly broad
salt concentration range [8]. This was illustrated by the
widespread of biosynthesis and transporter genes for
multiple organic osmolytes over the genome. Even
though halophilic microorganisms seemed to optimize
their metabolism to minimize the energetic cost for
osmotic adaptation, the de novo biosynthesis of osmolytes was less favorable with respect to either energy
consumption or flexibility than their absorption from

environment [52]. In addition, there are many transporters for betaine, which possibly suggested that betaine
was also one of the compatible solutes utilized by Halomonas sp. TD01 [53]. However, a complete comprehension of the occurrence and distribution of organic
osmoregulatory solutes in Halomonas sp. TD01 remain
to be determined. Moreover, as the environmental factors, especially the nutritional ones, are able to strongly
influence the production of PHA, the effects of both
environmental factors and genetic background of

Cai et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10:88

Halomonas sp. TD01 on the production of PHA should
be further studied.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the disclosure of the genome sequences
of Halomonas sp. TD01 improves our understanding on
the metabolism and evolutionary relationship of PHA
and osmoregulatory solutes from halophilic bacteria.
Detailed and systematic in silico analysis on the PHA
and osmolytes relevant genes provides abundant insights
on their classifications, functions and phylogeny.
Osmoregulatory mechanisms were also discussed
through the comparison of pI distribution. The availability of genomic information would inevitably pave new
ways for the application of numerous post-genomic
technologies and accelerate our work in the genetic
optimization of Halomonas sp. TD01 for the industrial
production of PHA, and possibly accompanied with the
co-production of compatible solute ectoine.
