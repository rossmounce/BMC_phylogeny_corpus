Abstract
Background: Serine proteinase inhibitors (Serpins) are a large superfamily of structurally related,
but functionally diverse proteins that control essential proteolytic pathways in most branches of
life. Given their importance in the biology of many organisms, the concept that ticks might utilize
serpins to evade host defenses and immunizing against or disrupting their functions as targets for
tick control is an appealing option.
Results: A sequence homology search strategy has allowed us to identify at least 45 tick serpin
genes in the Ixodes scapularis genome that are structurally segregated into 32 intronless and 13
intron-containing genes. Nine of the intron-containing serpins occur in a cluster of 11 genes that
span 170 kb of DNA sequence. Based on consensus amino acid residues in the reactive center loop
(RCL) and signal peptide scanning, 93% are putatively inhibitory while 82% are putatively
extracellular. Among the 11 different amino acid residues that are predicted at the P1 sites, 16
sequences possess basic amino acid (R/K) residues. Temporal and spatial expression analyses
revealed that 40 of the 45 serpins are differentially expressed in salivary glands (SG) and/or midguts
(MG) of unfed and partially fed ticks. Ten of the 38 serpin genes were expressed from six to 24 hrs
of feeding while six and fives genes each are predominantly or exclusively expressed in either MG
and SG respectively.
Conclusion: Given the diversity among tick species, sizes of tick serpin families are likely to be
variable. However this study provides insight on the potential sizes of serpin protein families in
ticks. Ticks must overcome inflammation, complement activation and blood coagulation to
complete feeding. Since these pathways are regulated by serpins that have basic residues at their
P1 sites, we speculate that I. scapularis may utilize some of the serpins reported in this study to
manipulate host defense. We have discussed our data in the context of advances on the molecular
physiology of I. scapularis. Although the paper is descriptive, this study provides the first step
toward a comprehensive understanding of serpins in tick physiology.

Background
Ticks, segregated into two families; Ixodidae (hard ticks)
and Argasidae (soft ticks) are important vectors of several

pathogens with a global veterinary and public health
impact [1,2]. Although research on ticks has for the most
part been directed towards agricultural interests, ticks

have been recognized as the second most important vectors of human disease agents after mosquitoes [2]. Globally, the impact of tick borne disease agents on public
health has been on a dramatic rise [3-6] since the discovery of Borelia burdgoferi as the causative agent for Lyme disease in 1982 [7,8]. Literature reviews by Parola and Roult
[3] listed 15 new tick borne bacterial agents being discovered or recognized as human pathogens between 1982
and 2004. In the United States ticks transmit more causative agents of vector borne diseases than any other vector
arthropod [9]. Tick borne human diseases reported in the
USA include Babesiosis, ehrlichisosis, Southern TickAssociated Rash illness (STARI), Lyme disease, tick-borne
relapsing fever, anaplasmosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, [9]. From a human health perspective, Ixodes
scapularis and its close relatives, I. pacificus, I. ricinus and I.
persulcatus and I. holocyclus are the most important ticks as
they transmit the majority of emerging human disease
pathogens. The importance of these ticks to human health
was the key justification for funding of the I. scapularis
genome, sequencing project [10]. Key anticipated outcomes of the tick genome sequencing project will be provision of opportunities to identify unique tick genes that
could be exploited for tick control and, thus the control of
tick borne diseases [10]. We are interested in understanding the role of the serine proteinase inhibitors (serpin) in
tick physiology and feeding.
Serpins represent the largest family of proteinase inhibitors that is widely conserved across taxa, from animals to
plants, viruses and bacteria [11-18]. Of the 68 families of
proteinase inhibitors listed on the MEROPS database (version 7.6, http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/, [19]), the serpin
family (denoted as I4) has the largest number of entries.
In humans, serpins make up 2% of total blood plasma
proteins [20] and are involved in the regulation of important pathways such as blood coagulation, complement
activation, inflammation, fertilization and food digestion
[11-14]. The importance of serpins in humans can be
attested to by more than 90 human diseases such as cirrhosis, emphysema, blood coagulation disorders and
dementia that arises from serpin malfunctions due to
mutation [12]. In arthropods, serpins were linked to
immunity in mosquitoes [21,22], the fruit fly [23-26] and
the tobacco hornworm [27], development in the fruit fly
[28], control of the hemolymph coagulation cascade in
the horseshoe crab [29-31]. Given the importance of serpins in the biology of multicellular organisms, it has been
hypothesized that, ticks might utilize serpins to evade
host defenses and immunizing against or disrupting functions of these proteins is an appealing option for designing new tick control strategies [17,32].
More than 30 serpin encoding cDNAs have now been
cloned in several economically and medically important

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/217

ticks including Amblyomma americanum [33], R. appendiculatus [17] and I. ricinus [34] and I. scapularis [35]. Serpin
encoding ESTs and cDNA sequences of I. scapularis and R.
microplus cited in [33] are also available in GeneBank.
Studies by Sugino et al., [36], Imamura et al., [37] and
Prevot et al., [38] have provided encouraging evidence
suggesting the potential of serpins as targets for tick control. These authors [36-38] showed that feeding of ticks on
animals immunized with recombinant tick serpins caused
ticks to obtain smaller blood meals and as consequence
reduced tick fecundity and mortality. These findings
clearly suggest that serpins play important roles in tick
physiology.
Given the availability of I. scapularis genome sequence
information in GeneBank and at VectorBase [38] we
thought to get some insight on the size of the serpin protein family in ticks. We report here on the identification
and characterization at least 45 I. scapularis serpin genes.
A sequence based analyses show that ~93% of these serpins are putatively inhibitory with 88% (31/35) of fulllength serpins being putatively extracellular. Our RT-PCR
expression analyses data demonstrated that 84% (38/45)
are differentially expressed in midguts and salivary glands
of unfed and partially fed ticks. We have discussed our
findings towards advances in I. scapularis tick molecular
biology.

Methods
Discovery of Ixodes scapularis serpin genes
The strategy to annotate serpin genes in the I. scapularis
genome is summarized in figure 1. In the first step, we
downloaded supercontig DNA sequences from VectorBase [39,40] and created a local database. In the second
step, the supercontig database was subjected to BLASTX
homology search using the FASTA3 software version 3.4
[41] to identify serpin-encoding supercontigs. Queries for
this search, included α1-antitrypsin and 30 tick serpin
sequences; 17 A. americanum [33], one H. longicornis [36],
four R. appendiculatus [17], six I. ricinus (DQ915842,
DQ915843, DQ915844, DQ915845 and AJ269658), and
two in I. scapularis (AAM93649 and AAV80788 [35]). In
the third step, coding genomic DNA sequences were
assembled using GenomeScan analysis [42] and the VectorNTI DNA analysis software (Invitrogen, Carlsbard, CA;
version 10, academic free license). GenomeScan analysis
[42] was used to align supercontig sequences with tick serpin protein sequences that were used as queries. This
alignment identified exons, which were manually assembled into genomic coding sequences using the VectorNTI
DNA analysis software (Invitrogen, Carlsbard, CA; version
10, academic free license). In step four cDNA sequences
were assembled. This was done by scanning genomic
DNA coding sequences from step three against the I.
scapularis trace archive EST database. Trace archive ESTs

STEP 1:

Create the local database of supercontigs of the I. scapularis genome

STEP 2:

Perform a local BLASTX search of the supercontig database
using other tick serpin downloads as queries to identify serpin
encoding supercontigs

STEP 3:

Assemble Use genomic (g) DNA coding domains .Use GenomeScan
analysis to align tick serpin protein sequences with supercocontig
sequences to identify exons. Use VectorNTI DNA analysis software
to manually assemble into genomic (g) DNA coding domains

STEP 4:

Assemble cDNA sequences. Perform BLASTN scanning of exons or gDNA
coding domains against trace archive database to retrieve ESTs and their mates.
Use the VectorNTI contig assembly to assemble ESTs and their mates into
cDNA sequences

STEP 5:

Determine the gene map. With parameters set to Drosophila melanogaster
use the SPIDEY software to delineate exon and intron boundaries based
on the GT-AG donor splice sites.

STEP 6:

Perform BLASTN scanning of assembled coding sequences against the
whole shortgun genome database to retrieve accession numbers of
primary sequences used to assemble supercontigs used in this study

showing e-values of zero (probability that the observation
was not by chance) and their mates were retrieved and
assembled using ContigExpress (Vector NTI package version 10). Prior to assembly any vector sequence contamination was removed using vector screen at NCBI. In step
five, exon and intron boundaries were delineated based
on donor-acceptor splice sites (GT-AG). This was accomplished by mapping cDNA sequences onto appropriate
supercontig sequences using the Spidey software [43] at

NCBI with parameters set to Drossophila melanogaster. In
step six, coding domains were scanned against the whole
shotgun genome database to retrieve accession numbers
for primary sequences that were used to assemble the
supercontigs used in this study.
Bioinformatics analyses
For comparisons to known serpins, assembled coding
sequences were scanned against known protein entries in

GenBank using the BLASTx or BLASTp homology search
program. To validate their accuracy, inferred amino acid
sequences were inspected for two amino acid motifs,
"NAVYKFG" and "DVNEEG," that are conserved in most
known serpins [30,44]. Full-length and partial sequences
were determined on the basis that, a typical serpin molecule ranges between 350–450 amino acid residues long
[11,12]. To gain insight on probable functionality,
inferred amino acid sequences were scanned against
amino acid motif entries in ScanProsite and signal peptides in the SignalP servers (ExPASY Proteomics Server
http://ca.expasy.org/). The reactive center loop (RCL)
which determines the functionality (inhibitory and noninhibitory) of a serpin molecule was determined based on
consensus 20/21 residue peptide "p17 [E]-p16 [E/K/R]p15 [G]-p14 [T/S]-p13 [X]-p12-9 [AGS]-p8-1 [X]-p1' -4' "
in carboxy-terminus region [11,45]. The numbering here
is based on the convention in which residues on the
amino terminal side of scissile bond (p1-p1') are labeled
as p17 to p1 and those on the carboxy terminal side are
labeled as p1' -p4' [46]. The putative scissile bond (p1p1') and the p1 residue were predicted based on the conserved features that there are generally 17 amino residues
(p17 to p1) between the start of the hinge region of the
RCL, and scissile bond [11].
Guide phylogeny tree
In order to determine relationships among tick serpins, a
guide tree of 68 tick serpins sequences, 34 full-length serpins from this study, and 34 other tick serpins that were
downloaded from GeneBank, and human α1-antitrypsin
(out group, AAB59495) as an outlier were used to construct the guide tree using the neighbor joining method.
Specifications were set for bootstrap values at 1000 replications, gaps proportionately distributed and correction
for distance set to a Poisson distribution. To determine the
homologous features that influenced the clustering patterns, sequences of each clade were subjected to multiple
sequence alignment analyses.
Structural based sequence alignment and comparative
modeling
To determine secondary structures, randomly selected
representative sequences of each cluster in the guide phylogeny tree, serpins S1, 19, 22, 34 and 35 were subjected
structural based sequence alignment using the web based
STRAP (Structure based Alignment Program) http://
www.charite.de/bioinf/strap/. Subsequently, secondary
structures were superimposed on the structurally aligned
sequences using the human α1-antitrypsin tertiary structure (1HP7, [47]) as template. The aligned sequences were
subsequently viewed using the GeneDoc sequence analysis software for windows http://www.nrbsc.org/gfx/gene
doc/index.html.

Expression analyses by RT-PCR
OligodT primed salivary gland (SG) and midgut (MG)
cDNA templates of unfed ticks and ticks that were fed for
6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hrs used in this study were a gift from
Dr. Shahid Karim, formerly at the University of Rhode
Island, now at University of Mississippi. The harvest of
tick tissues and synthesis of cDNA were done as previously
described by Kotsyfakis et al., [48]. One μl aliquots of
these templates were used in a PCR reaction with specific
PCR primers (Tables 1 and 2). PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The tick actin gene (Table 1) was used for
PCR template load control. To determine mRNA abundance, densitograms of amplified PCR bands were determined using the web based ImageJ software http://
rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/. To correct for variations in PCR template concentrations, PCR band densities were normalized using the following formula; Y = V + V (H-X)/X where
Y = normalized mRNA density, V = observed Ispin PCR
band density in individual tissues (MG and SG), H = highest tick actin PCR band density among tested tissues (carcass in this case 24 hrs MG), X = tick actin density in MG
or SG [33].

Results
Discovery of I. scapularis serpin genes
We successfully used homology search engines, Fasta3
version 3.4 [41], BLASTX and BLASTN to scan supercontigs of the I. scapularis genome and annotated 45 serpin
genes in the I. scapularis genome (Table 3). Of the 45
genes, serpins (S) 1 to 11 occur in a cluster spanning 170
kb of DNA sequence (figure 2) and the rest occur singly or
in pairs. When scanned against the I. scapularis trace
archive cDNA database, 72% (32/45) of the serpin coding
regions showed matches in the EST database with e-values
of zero (probability that this observation was not by
chance) (Table 3). The delineation of introns and exons
boundaries based on Spidey [43] and Genome Scan [42]
programs revealed that, the 45 serpin genes are structurally segregated into 32 intronless and 13 intron-containing genes. The intron-containing genes, have four exons
with the first and second exon coding for the 5' untranslated region (UTR) and the third and fourth exons coding
for the open reading frame and the 3' UTR (figure 3). Of
the 13 intron-containing genes, nine belong to the cluster
of 11 genes shown in figure 2.

As summarized in table three, all I. scapularis serpin
sequences showed best matches exclusively to other tick
serpin sequences. Except for S5, 9, 17 and 40 that respectively showed 96, 97, 99, 96 and 95% amino acid identity
to I. ricinus serpin (Irs) 4 (accession [acc] # DQ915844),
Irs1 (acc# DQ915842), Irs8 (acc# DQ915845), the I. ricinus immunosuppressant serpin (AJ269658, [34]) and Irs2
(acs# DQ915843), the identity levels between serpins in

this study and other tick serpins ranged between 34 to
57% (Table 3). Two of the serpins genes in this study, S5
and 7 are 99 and 98% identical to previously annotated I.
scapularis serpins, AAM93649 and AAV80788 respectively [35] (Table 3). At the time of preparing this manuscript, a preliminary annotation of the I. scapularis
genome (version 0.5) was released http://www.vectorbase.org/index.php. When scanned against this database,
88% (40/45) of the serpin sequences produced matches
with e-values of zero. The reader is notified here that
because neither supercontig accession numbers nor the
preliminary gene annotations are referenced in
GeneBank, whole genome shotgun sequence and/or trace
archive accession numbers are given in table three to provide the source for primary sequence data that was used in
this study.

Inferred amino acid sequence analyses
A typical full-length serpin molecule may range between
350-to-450 amino acid residues long [11,14]. On this
basis and in addition to possessing in frame start and stop
codons, 35 of the 45 inferred serpin sequences were determined to be full-length (Table 3). As indicated in table
three, eight of the ten partial sequences are truncated at
their amino terminus, while the remaining two sequences
are truncated at their c-terminal. At their c-terminus, serpins are characterized by a flexible reactive center loop
(RCL), the primary determinant of functionality (inhibitory or non-inhibitory) that acts as a pseudo-substrate for
the target proteinase [11,42]. Based on consensus amino
acid residues [11,14,45], RCLs have been detected in all
sequences (figure 4), except for serpin 25 and 28 that are
truncated at their c-terminus (Table 3). On the basis that

inhibitory serpins have more than 50% of "A" between
p12-9 and that charged amino acid residues at p14 or "P"
residues at p12 or p10 in the RCL, causes loss of inhibitory
function [11], 41 of the 43 serpins that have a RCL are predicted to have inhibitor functions (figure 4). In the RCL
the P1 residue determines substrate specificity [11,45]. By
consensus there are generally 17 amino acid residues (p17
to p1) between the start of the hinge region of the RCL,
and scissile bond [p1-p1'] [11,49]. On this basis, visual
inspection of putative RCL amino acid sequences revealed
a diversity of 11 different residues K, R, L, G, A, S, E, C, Y,
I and M at the P1 sites (figure 3). As shown in figure 2, 16
of the 43 serpin, sequences that have RCLs are predicted
to possess basic charged amino acid residues, "R" or "K"
at their P1 site (figure 4). Of the 16 serpin sequences,
seven belong to the cluster of 11 serpin genes that are
shown in figure 1. It is also interesting to note that eight
other serpin genes possess basic residues at their P2 site.
Amino acid motifs scan analyses
Motif scan analyses on the ScanProsite server [50]
revealed that the serpin signature motif pattern PS00284
([LIVMFY]-G- [LIVMFYAC]- [DNQ]- [RKHOS]- [PST]-F[LIVMFY]- [LIVMFYC]-X- [LIVMFAH] was present in all
sequences (results not shown). On the SignalP3.0 server
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/, 89% (31/35) of
the 35 full-length serpin sequences were predicted to have
leader sequences (Table 3). Other important motifs
include the putative N-glycosylation (NX [S/T]) sites in 38
of the 45 serpin sequences. Except for S11, which was predicted to have eight putative N-glycosylation sites, the rest
have between one to three sites. We also found the cell
attachment motif "RGD" in four sequences, S1, 7,17 and
42.

Guide phylogeny analysis
In order to determine the relationship among tick serpins,
we used the neighbor joining method to generate a phylogeny guide tree of 68 tick serpin sequences. From the α1antitrypsin outlier, 68 tick serpin sequences segregated
into five main clusters, A-E supported by 93, 90, 96, 88
and 93% bootstrap values (figure 5). Except for Bmserp1,
all other sequences in main branch "A" have no signal
peptides. The remaining sequences, all of which have signal peptides are segregated into branches "B-E".
I. scapularis serpins posses key residues that characterize
the secondary structure the serpin superfamily
Irving et al., [51] performed a sequence alignment of 219
serpin sequences and identified 51 core amino acid residues that underlie the functionality of inhibitory serpins.
Here we adopted this analysis by aligning the 35 full serpin sequence with the human α1-antitrypsin (accession #
AAB59495) and found that the 51 core residues that
underpin the efficient functioning of an inhibitory serpin
[51] are 67–96% (34–49/51) conserved in I. scapularis serpins (figure 6). The inhibitory mechanism of the serpins
relies on their structural flexibility, which is controlled by
the shutter region [11,52]. Two amino acid motifs S53-P54X55-S56 and I157-N158-X159-X160-V161 (numbering is based
on the serpin human α1-antitrypsin) that underpin the
functioning of the shutter region [11,52] are 100% conserved in 20 of the 34 I. scapularis serpin sequences (figure
6).

Given the high conservation of core residues that underpin the functionality of serpins, we thought to determine
whether or not the serpin common fold of 7–9 α-helices
and three β-sheets (A-C) and the RCL [12] were also con-

A cluster of 11 serpin (S) genes (S1-to-11) spanning 170 kb of DNA sequence
A cluster of 11 serpin (S) genes (S1-to-11) spanning 170 kb of DNA sequence. Structurally, nine serpin genes, S1-to9 have introns, while S10 and 11 are intronless. When scanned against the whole genome shotgun DNA sequence database,
encoding these open reading frames of these genes are ABJB010004033 for S1, ABJB010065261 for S2, ABJB010418850,
ABJB011135496, ABJB0109755250 and ABJB010321224 for S3, ABJB011011198 for S4, ABJB010283366 for S5,
ABJB011103238 and ABJB010459188 for S6, ABJB010459188 for S7, ABJB010459188 for S8 and ABJB010543279 for S9, 10
and 11. Based on genomic DNA sequence, complete open reading frames (ORF) were detected for all serpins except for S11
and S6, which are partial and their ORFs were assembled from EST sequences indicated in Table 3. Open arrow heads (⇐)
denote intronless, closed arrow heads (⇒) denote intron-containing genes.

Typical structure of intron-containing serpin genes
Typical structure of intron-containing serpin genes. The cDNA sequence that were assembled from trace archive EST
sequences were aligned with supercontig DNA sequences using the Spidey mRNA and genomic DNA alignment software at
NCBI [43] and identified the donor-acceptor splice sites (GT-AG). Displayed here is S3 whose cDNA was assembled from
trace archive EST and its mate, accession #s 1446657576/1446661330 respectively. The cDNA was mapped onto genomic
DNA sequences corresponding to whole genome shotgun sequence (ABJB010418850, ABJB011135496, ABJB0109755250 and
ABJB010321224). The first and second exons encode the 5' untranslated region (UTR) and while the third and fourth exon
encode the open reading frame, and the 3' UTR.
served in the deduced serpin sequences. As shown in figure 6, structural based sequence alignment of
representative sequences (S1, 19, 22, 34 and 35) from
each of the five main branches shown in figure 4, revealed
that the serpin secondary structure is conserved in I. scapularis serpins (figure 7).
Transcriptional analyses
To begin determining the role of serpins in this study in
tick feeding and physiology, semi-quantitative RT-PCR
was used to establish temporal and spatial expression patterns in salivary glands (SG) and midguts (MG) of unfed
and ticks that were partially fed for 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96
hrs (figure 8). Of the 45 serpin sequences, 40 are
expressed in SG and MG; 34 being strongly expressed (figures 8A and 8B) and five weakly expressed (not shown).
For clarity and limitations on space, we have presented
our RT-PCR data in two panels. Panel one (figures 8A and
8B) show expression patterns of serpin sequences that
possesses basic residues (R/K) at their P1 sites, while
expression patterns of the rest of the genes are displayed
in panel two (figures 8C and 8D). On the basis of visual
intensity of PCR bands (figure 8A and 8C) and analysis of
normalized PCR band densities (figure 8B and 8D),
expression patterns of the 35 genes can be segregated into
four profiles. In the first pattern, six genes (S1, 2, 4 and 7
in panel one, S3, 28, 38 and 44 in panel two) whose transcript increased with tick feeding were expressed from six
or 24 hrs of tick feeding. The next set of genes, are constitutively expressed in both MG and SG with their transcript
abundance either increasing (S17 and 32 in panel one, 23
and 37 in panel two) or decreasing (S19 in panel two) as
ticks continued to feed. The third group of genes S6, 9, 12,
16, 21, 26 and 27 in panel one and S20, 25 and 40 in
panel two displayed a dichotomous expression pattern. In
the case of S6, it is expressed from 24 hrs in SG but constitutively expressed in MG with its transcript abundance
increasing in both organs as ticks continue to feed. In the

case of serpin S16 and 26, which are induced from 24 hrs
in SG and their transcript abundance increasing thereafter,
are constitutively expressed in MG with transcript abundance decreasing as ticks continue to feed. For S9 and 27
in panel one, S20, 25, 30, 33, 40 and 41 in panel two, they
are constitutively expressed in both organs, but their transcript abundance increases in SG and decreases in MG as
ticks continue to feed. The fourth profile consist of genes
that are predominantly or specifically expressed in SG (S1,
5, 16, 31, 35 and 36) and MG (S10, 14, 18, 21 and 22)
with transcript abundance decreasing for the former and
increasing for the later as ticks continued to feed.

Discussion and conclusion
Analysis of genome sequence data has led to the discovery
of large families of serpins in multicellular organisms,
including 36 in humans, nine in Caenorhabditis elegans
[16], 29 in Drosophila [26] and plants [53]. On the Merops
database, 17 and 18 serpin sequences are listed for Aedes
aegypti and Anopheles gambiae. In ticks, documentation of
multiple serpin encoding cDNAs has provided indirect
evidence suggesting that ticks do encode large serpin families. For instance, we recently described 17 serpin cDNAs
that are expressed by A. americanum during feeding [33].
Here we describe the annotation and characterization of
45 serpin genes in the I. scapularis genome. The observed
high amino acid sequence identity between I. scapularis
and I. ricinus serpins was not surprising as these two ticks
belong to the same genus. It is important to point out that
eight of the 45 annotated were not represented in the preliminary peptide build at VectorBase. This finding may
raise the prospect of error in annotations reported here.
Interestingly, this possibility is ruled out, as ESTs of six of
the eight serpins in this study (S1, 13, 23, 24, 33 and 39)
were present in the trace archive database, while coding
regions of serpins S26 and 32 were amplified from unfed
and partially fed ticks (see figure 7).

The adoption of the consensus serpin secondary structures
[11,12] and the high conservation of the core amino acid
residues [51] that underpin the structure and functionality
of serpins strongly suggested that, I. scapularis serpins are
functional. The majority of known serpins function as
inhibitors of serine proteinases and hence the name [54].
However others with activity against cysteine proteinases
and those with no inhibitor functions have also been
described [12]. Although on the basis of sequence analysis
[11], we are able to distinguish between inhibitory and
non-inhibitory serpins, available data in this study is
insufficient to specify their preferred proteinase sub-

strates. Putative RCLs and scissile bonds of serpins in this
study were predicted based on consensus that there are 17
amino acid residues between the start of the RCL hinge
region and the scissile bond [11,45,51]. As some of the
characterized serpins such as α2-antiplasmin [11] or
serpin1k from Manducca sexta [55], utilize shorter RCLs,
we are interpreting our predictions of RCLs and scissile
bonds with caution.
Our finding that 82% of the full-length serpins in this
study have signal peptides is consistent with observations
in humans where the majority of known serpins exist in

Figure 4 I. scapularis serpin reactive center loops (RCL) (B)
Predicted
Predicted I. scapularis serpin reactive center loops (RCL) (B). RCLs were determined based on the eight, residue pattern (A) that characterizes inhibitory serpins [45]. The residues in the RCL are numbered according to the standard nomenclature developed by Schechter and Berger [46], where residues on the amino-terminal side of the scissile (P1-P1') are not
primed and those on the carboxy terminal side primed. Assuming that there are 17 residues between the base of RCL hinge
and the scissile bond [45], boldfaced residues are predicted P1 residues with the broken line arrowhead indicating the position
of the scissile bond.

the extracellular form [14]. Findings in this study are not
unique, in that similar results were reported in A. americanum where 13 of the 17 putatively inhibitory serpins in A.
americanum were predicted to be extracellular [33]. From
the perspective of finding target antigens for vaccine
development, it is encouraging to note that the majority
of I. scapularis serpins are putatively extracellular as they
will be accessible to host immune response factors. Predictions based on sequence analysis, may not be consistent with the situation in vivo. However it is interesting to
note that the four serpin sequences (S30, 32, 35 and 38)
that were predicted to be intracellular sequences, based on
lack of a signal peptide also posses "C" residues in the
exposed regions of their RCL, a feature that has been
observed in many intracellular serpins [14].
The use of alternatively spliced RCLs appears to be a wide
spread strategy in insects to diversify the range of target
proteinases that can be controlled by a single serpin gene
[56-58]. A classic observation of this phenomenon is the
serpin gene-1 of the tobacco hornworm, M. sexta, which
has 12 different alternatively, spliced RCLs [56]. Effectively this gives rise to 12 serpins regulating 12 different
proteolytic pathways. An interesting structural feature
among the 12 variants of M. sexta serpin gene 1 is that the
first 336 amino acids are exactly identical with difference
restricted to the RCL [56]. The identity patterns among I.
scapularis serpins sequences of where, stretches of identical
and variable domains were spread across the entire
sequence suggest that the diversity among serpins in this
study may have arisen by duplication other than alternative splicing of RCL encoding exons.
From the perspective of understanding how the tick
manipulates the mammalian host's defense against tick
feeding, the finding of 18 serpins with basic residues at
their P1 sites was exciting. In humans, this feature is associated with key serpins such as α1-antichymotrypsin, α1antiplasmin, antithrombin III, protein C inhibitor and C1
inhibitor [11], which regulate important pathways such as
inflammation, blood coagulation and complement activation. As these pathways are thought to represent the
mammalian host's defense against tick feeding [59,60], it
is tempting to imagine that ticks could utilize some of
these serpins to manipulate host defense to facilitate tick
feeding and disease transmission. It is also possible that
these serpins may not be directly be involved in facilitation of feeding. However, like their mammalian counterparts, they may be involved in regulation of important
pathways in the tick, which if disrupted can affect the
capacity of ticks as vectors.
Although the biological significance of gene expression
data will be strengthened if correlated with protein production, our RT-PCR data provide some useful insights on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/217

probable biological roles of serpin genes in this study in
the physiology of I. scapularis. Speculatively I. scapularis
genes that were induced or up regulated after ticks had
penetrated their host skin may signal their involvement in
facilitation of blood meal up take. This is particularly true
for the 11 genes that were induced in both SG and MG
(S1, 2, 3, 4 and 7) or SG alone (S5, 6, 16, 26, 35 and 36)
in ticks that were fed for 6–24 hrs. This period corresponds to the preparatory feeding phase when tick
attaches onto host skin and creates its feeding lesion [2].
During this period the tick must overcome inflammation
and blood coagulation for it to successfully start the feeding process. Similarly, the group of serpin genes (S17, 23,
25, 32, 37, 38 and 40) that were constitutively expressed
but their transcript abundance increased with tick feeding
may also play a role in facilitating blood meal up take. For
those genes that were constitutively expressed, S9, 12 and
27 in the MG, and S19 in both SG and MG, but were progressively down regulated as ticks continued to feed,
could be involved in regulating physiological processes at
the front end of tick feeding process. The expression of
S10, 14, 18, 21 and 22, specifically or predominantly in
the MG is interesting as it signals the potential role for
these genes in facilitation of not only blood meal processing, but also in the crossing of the gut barrier by pathogens. From the perspective of our long-term interest to
find tick proteins that are used by ticks to evade host
immunity, it was exciting to note that some serpins were
specifically expressed in SG. It will be exciting to investigate whether or not any of these genes are injected into the
host during tick feeding. It is possible that the genes analyzed here could be expressed in multiple tick organs
besides the SG and MG. However, from the perspective of
our long-term interests to understand molecular mechanisms that underlie tick-host interactions, our analysis
here is biased to biological functions of serpins at the SG
and MG levels. The SG is critical for feeding and disease
transmission while the MG is important for blood meal
processing and the passage of pathogens from the blood
meal into the tick hemolymph [2]. Our future questions
will thus address the role of the serpins in facilitation of
tick feeding and blood meal processing.
Most known serpins are glycosylated [12,16] and thus it is
not surprising that 40 of the 43 serpin sequences that were
tested are predicted to possess putative N-glycosyslation
sites. As pool feeders, ticks accomplish feeding by lacerating small blood vessels and then sucking blood from the
hematoma that forms in the feeding site [2]. In order to
complete feeding, ticks must prevent host blood from
coagulating to ensure continued blood flow into the
hematoma for the entire tick feeding period, which may
last for over the 10–14 and 4–7 day feeding periods for
adults and immature ticks respectively [2]. From the perspective of solving the paradox of how the tick interferes

with the coagulation cascade of its mammalian host, it
was interesting to note that ~9% (4/45) of the sequences
contain the RGD motif. Previous studies have shown that
tick proteins containing the RGD motif such as variabilin
[61] and savignygrin [62] were potent inhibitors of platelet aggregation. Platelet aggregation is critical to stopping
bleeding of injured small blood vessels such as occurs at
the tick bite [59]. Thus, if functional, the RGD motif containing serpins could represent important molecular targets aimed at countering the ability of ticks to suppress the
mammalian's host's blood clotting system. In addition to
the anti-platelet aggregation function, RGD motif containing proteins are also involved in regulating cell-cell
interactions in mammals [63], immunity in arthropods
[64], and plants [65]. From the foregoing, it is clear that
the RGD motif containing serpins could also be involved
in regulation of multiple other functions in the tick,
besides platelet function at the tick feeding site. It is interesting to note that our RT-PCR data suggested that the
expression of three (S1, 7 and 16)) of the four serpin RGD
motif-containing genes was responsive to tick feeding
activity (see figure 8).
When compared to the 3100 Mbp human genome that
encodes at least 36 serpin genes [16] the 45 serpin genes
identified in I. scapularis, which has a 2100 Mbp genome
is considerably high. While the biological significance of
the high number of serpin genes in the I. scapularis biology
cannot be ascertained at present, we speculate that this
may signal the significance of serpins in tick physiology.
In light of lack of genome sequence data of many tick species, the sizes of tick serpin families will remain unknown.
Ticks are diverse, both in terms of their biology [2] and
their genome sizes [66-68]. Thus it is likely that the sizes
of serpin families in ticks are going to vary. However, this
study provides some insight on the probable sizes of serpin families in ticks.
