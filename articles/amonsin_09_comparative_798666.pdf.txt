Abstract
Background: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a causative agent
of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS). In this study, the complete nucleotide
sequences of the selected two Thai PRRSV isolates, EU (01CB1) and US (01NP1) genotypes were
determined since both isolates are the Thai prototypes.
Results: 01CB1 and 01NP1 contain 14,943 and 15,412 nucleotides, respectively. The viruses
compose 2 untranslated regions (5' UTR and 3' UTR) and 8 open reading frames (ORFs) designated
as ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2-7. Phylogenetic analysis of full length of the viruses also showed that
the 01CB1 and 01NP1 were grouped into the EU and US genotype, respectively. In order to
determine the genetic variation and genetic relatedness among PRRSV isolates, the complete
nucleotide sequences of PRRSV isolated in Thailand, 01CB1 and 01NP1 were compared with those
of 2 EU strains (Lelystad, and EuroPRRSV), 6 US strains (MLV, VR2332, PA8, 16244B, SP and
HUN4). Our results showed that the 01CB1 genome shares approximately 99.2% (Lelystad) and
95.2% (EuroPRRSV) nucleotide identity with EU field strains. While, the 01NP1 genome has 99.9%
nucleotide identity with a live vaccine strain (MLV) and 99.5% and 98.5% nucleotide identity with 2
other US isolates, VR2332 and 16244B, respectively. In addition, ORF5 nucleotide sequences of 9
PRRS viruses recovered in Thailand during 2002-2008 were also included in this study. Phylogenetic
analysis of ORF5 showed high similarity among EU and US genotypes of the recent Thai PRRS
viruses (2007-2008 viruses) with 01CB1 and 01NP1.
Conclusion: Overall, the results suggested that the Thai EU isolate (01CB1) may evolve from the
EU prototype, Lelystad virus, whereas the Thai US isolate (01NP1) may originate and evolve from
the vaccine virus or its derivatives. Interestingly, the US-MLV vaccine was not available in the Thai
market in 2001. The Vaccine-like virus might have persisted in the imported pigs or semen and later
spread in the Thai swine industry. This report is the first report of complete nucleotide sequences
of the Thai PRRS viruses both EU and US genotypes.

Background
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus
(PRRSV) belonging to the genus Arterivirus in the family
Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales is a major swine virus
causing economic losses in the swine industry worldwide
including Thailand. Porcine reproductive and respiratory
syndrome (PRRS) was first evident in the North American
countries in 1987 and later in the European countries in
1990 [1]. In Thailand, PRRSV was first isolated in 1996 [2]
but was serologically evident since 1989. Our previous
report demonstrated that in Thailand both US and EU
genotypes exist and sequential analysis of ORF5 gene confirmed genetic variation of Thai PRRS viruses [3].
Full-length genome sequences of PPRSV are essential and
have been used for gene functional study, pathogenesis
study, and evolutionary study as well as vaccine development of the virus. Full-length sequences of several PRRSV
both US and EU genotypes are available in the public
database. For example, the US prototype (VR2332) [4]
and European prototype (LV) [5] are well characterized.
The US genotype strains including the US field strains
(16244B) [6], the US-MLV vaccine (MLV) [7], Canadian
field strain (PA8) [8], Asian vaccine strain (SP) [9] and
Asian field strain (BJ-4 and HUN4) [10] are available in
the database. In addition, full-length sequences of EU
genotype strain (EuroPRRSV) [11] was also identified.
Phylogenetic analysis and full-length sequence comparison of the prototype viruses revealed that US and EU
strains share approximately 63% nucleotide homology
[6]. It has been known that ORF1a is relatively high variable, while ORF1b is more conserved among US and EU
genotypes. Recent example is that the variation of ORF1a
(multiple deletions in Nsp2 region) related to atypical virulence of PRRS in China [10,12]. The structural protein
encoding genes (ORFs2-7) are 20% (3 kb) in length of the
genome. Out of 6 structural genes, ORF5 and ORF7 have
been widely characterized and used to study the genetic
diversity of the viruses in several reports [13-17]

In this present study, we described the genetic comparison
of full-length sequences of two Thai PRRSV prototypes of
both EU (01CB1) and US (01N1) genotypes. ORF5 nucleotide sequences of 9 PRRS viruses recovered during 20022008 were also included in the analysis. Overall, 01CB1
closely related to the Lelystad virus (99.2%) and EuroPRRSV (95.2%). On the other hand, the 01NP1 genome
was similar to the US-MLV, VR2332 and 16244B at
99.9%, 99.5% and 98.5% identity, respectively. The availability of complete genome sequences of Thai PRRSV is
essential and useful for the evolution study of PRRSV as
well as the development of infectious clones or vaccines in
the future.

Results
Complete genome of Thai PRRS viruses
During the 2001 PRRS outbreaks in Thailand, the PRRS
viruses, 01CB1 and 01NP1 were isolated from the intensive swine farming areas. Additional 9 PRRS viruses isolated in Thailand from 2002-2008 were also included in
the study (Table 1). To study the relationship and genetic
characteristics of those Thai viruses, two isolates, "01CB1
and 01NP1", considering the Thai prototypes were
selected for full-length genome sequencing since the pathogenicity of both viruses were previously studies. The
viruses were identified as the EU (01CB1) and the US
(01NP1) strains based on ORF 5 analysis [3]. In this
study, we have elucidated the full-length sequences of
PRRSV of 01CB1 containing 14,943 bp (52.67%GC) and
01NP1 containing 15,412 bp (52.76%GC). The viruses
had untranslated regions (5' UTR and 3' UTR) and 8 open
reading frames (ORFs) designated as ORF1a, ORF1b and
ORF2-7. The details of genome organization of PRRS
viruses, 01CB1 and 01NP1, were shown in table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis of the viruses showed that 01CB1
and 01NP1 were grouped into the separated lineages represented by the EU (LV and EuroRRSV) and US (MLV,

The 01CB1 was the most closely related to the LV virus
(EU prototype), while the 01NP1 was the most closely
related to the US MLV strain and the US prototype
(VR2332). In general, phylogenetic analysis of full length
sequences of PRRSV indicated that the Thai viruses were of
both US and EU origin and exhibited the highest sequence
similarity to those of EU prototype (LV) and the US prototype (MLV), respectively (Table 3). Phylogenetic analysis of ORF5 sequences of recent Thai PRRSV (2002-2008)
were also analyzed, the results also showed high similarity
among EU and US genotypes of the recent Thai PRRS
viruses (2007-2008 viruses) with 01CB1 and 01NP1 (Fig
2). In addition, all EU isolates from Thailand (01CB1,
02SB3, 08RB103, 08NP144) are clustered into the EU
genotype - subtype 1, which is the common subtype for
EU-PRRSV worldwide as well as the EU vaccine strains.
Genetic analyses
Pair-wise sequence comparisons of full-length sequences
of the Thai isolates are presented in table 3. The two Thai

isolates were compared with eight representative PRRS
viruses of both genotypes obtained from the GenBank
database that had been completely sequenced. The 01CB1
displayed the highest percentage of nucleotide identity to
the EU isolates (LV and EuroPRRSV), while the 01NP1
had high percentage of similarity to the US isolates (MLV,
VR2332, 16244B, PA8, SP, HUN4) with more than 98%
nucleotide identity. However, the percent homology
between the two Thai isolates, 01CB1 and 01NP1, was
59.81%.
In this study, 5' UTR of 01NP1 and 01CB1 had 189 bp and
144 bp in length. 5'UTR of 01CB1 was almost identical to
the 5'UTR of VR2332 (99.5%) and the US-MLV (98.6%)
(data not shown), while 5' UTR of 01NP1 displayed profound nucleotide sequence identity (more than 90%)
with the US isolates. Similar findings were also observed
in 3' UTR that 01CB1 and 01NP1 shared high percentage
of nucleotide identity of 3' UTR of the EU and US genotypes.

ORF1a and ORF1b of 01CB1 and 01NP1 encoded proteins of 2,396 and 1,463 and 2,503 and 1,463 amino
acids, respectively. ORF1a and ORF1b of 01CB1 were similar to those of the EU strains (99.2% and 99.3%) (data
not shown). Comparison of deduced amino acids
revealed that ORF1a had more polymorphic sites than
ORF1b proteins. Polymorphic sites in ORF1a of 01CB1
and 01NP1 were 125/2396 and 61/2503. On the other
hand, polymorphic amino acids in ORF1b were 27/1463
(01CB1) and 16/1463 (01NP1). These findings indicated
that ORF1a was continuously changing and evolving as
previously described especially in the Nsp2 region [8]. In
this study, deduced amino acids of the Nsp2 proteins of
01NP1 were compared to those of US strains (MLV,
VR2332, PA8, 16244B, SP and HUN4) (Fig 3). Amino
acid deletions were found at position 482 (1 aa) and 533561 (28 aa) in Nsp2 of the Chinese isolate (HUN4) but

ORFs2-7 genes encoded structural proteins of the PRRSV
including envelop protein (ORF2-5), matrix protein (ORF
6) and nucleocapsid protein (ORF 7). Structural genes of
01CB1 and 01NP1 were approximately 3 kb in size. In this
study, ORF 2-7 of the two viruses were conserved (less
polymorphic sites). ORF 2-7 of 01CB1 and 01NP1 were
similar to ORF2-7 of the LV and the US-MLV viruses
(>99.0% identity) (Data not shown). Out of 5 structural
genes (ORFs2-7), ORF 7 was highly conserved in both EU
and US strains, while ORF5 was less conserved among
both strains. Deduced amino acids of ORF5 gene of
01NP1 and 01CB1 and additional 9 PRRSV (2002-2008)
were compared to those of US strains (MLV, VR2332, PA8,
16244B, SP and HUN4) and EU strain (LV and EuroPRRSV) (Fig 4 and 5). The results showed that the US
strains (01NP1) had 11 polymorphic sites comparing to
US consensus and the EU strains (01CB1) had 13 polymorphic sites comparing to the EU consensus (Fig 4 and
5). Interestingly, polymorphic sites in ORF5 of EU strains
were found more than those of US strains. Sequence distances of ORF5 among PRRS viruses are 82.0-99.5%
(among US genotype) and 84.7-99.5% (among EU genotype). These findings indicated moderate genetic diversity
among Thai PRRSV in both genotypes.
In summary, genetic analyses of untranslated region (5'
UTR and 3' UTR) and ORF 1-7 showed that 01CB1 was
mostly similar to the EU prototype, LV (98.5% -99.7%).
The Thai US strain, 01NP1 was closely related to the USMLV vaccine strain (99.4%-100%).

Discussion
In this study, we reported full-length sequences of the
Thai PRRS viruses of both EU (01CB1) and US (01NP1)
genotypes. The full-length size of the EU strain, 01CB1, is
14,943 bp, similar to the two EU strains (LV; 15,101 bp
and EuroPRRSV; 15,047 bp) [5,11]. On the other hand,
01NP1 isolate has 15,412 bp in size. The size of this virus
is similar to the US strains (VR2332, 15,411 bp and
16244B, 15,411 bp) [4,6], the US-MLV vaccine (MLV,
15,412 bp) [7], Canadian field strain (PA8, 15,411 bp)
[8], Asian vaccine strain (SP, 15,520 bp) [9] and Asian
field strain (BJ-4, 15,410 bp and HUN4, 15352 bp) [10].
Genome organization of the Thai PRRS viruses contained
8 open reading frames. Two non structural genes, ORF1a
and ORF1b, composed 70% in size of the genome. ORF1a
and ORF1b encoded replicase polyproteins, which subsequently cleaved to 13 subunits (Nsp1a/b-Nsp12). ORF27 were structural genes that encode envelop protein
(ORF2-5), matrix protein (ORF 6) and nucleocapsid pro-

tein (ORF7) [8]. Most full-length sequences of PRRSV had
identified of 8 ORFs in the genome, however some studies
have reported additional ORF2 (ORF2a and ORF2b)
encoding unknown protein function.
Comparison of full-length sequences of the Thai PRRS
viruses (01CB1 and 01NP1) with other PRRS viruses from
the European, north American and Asian countries
revealed that 01CB1 virus was similar to the EU strains
especially the EU prototype, Lelystad (99.2%). Unexpectedly, 01NP1 had nucleotide sequences similar to the USMLV (99.9%) and the US-prototype (VR2332) (99.5%).
Phylogenetic analysis showed that 01CB1 and 01NP1
were clustered into the EU and the US lineages, respectively. 01CB1 was closely related to the LV virus, the EU
prototype whereas, 01NP1 was closely related to the USMLV (vaccine strain) and VR2332 (US prototype). Our
results indicated that the Thai EU strain evolved from the
LV. The introduction of the Thai EU strain of PRRSV may
possibly due to the importation of persistently infected
pigs or semen. Interestingly, 01NP1 was closely related to
the US-MLV vaccine strain. Since the US-MLV vaccine was
not available in Thailand until 2005, the contaminated
vaccine-like virus might have persisted in the imported

pigs or semen at that time. Our previous report found that
the Thai EU isolates were closely related to the Danish
viruses and the Thai US isolates were closely related to the
Canadian viruses [3]. Since the US-MLV has been found in
the Danish pig population [18] at the same time of the
first PRRSV report in Thailand [2]. 01NP1 might originate
from persistently US-MLV infected imported pigs either
from Canada or Denmark. Similarly, the evidence of the
field strain (PA8) that originated and evolved from the
US-MLV vaccine strain (RespPRRS) had been documented
in Canada [8]. Unfortunately, full length nucleotide
sequence of the Spanish vaccine virus (Amervac) was not
available for analysis since only the Spanish vaccine was
the only live vaccine available at that time. The analysis
will rule out the possibility that the Thai EU strain may
also evolve from imported Spanish vaccine strains in the
90s.
In this study, the most variable ORFs were ORF1a (Nsp2)
and ORF5. Both ORF1a and ORF5 were previously
reported as highly variable regions. ORF1a (Nsp2 subunit) can be used as genetic marker for monitoring the
mutation or genetic changes as well as for differential
diagnosis of PRRS viruses [9,19,20]. Recently, atypical
PRRS outbreaks have been reported in China since 2006
causing severe economic losses in the Chinese swine
industry. Genome analysis of the Chinese viruses revealed
that the viruses contain 2 distinct amino acid deletions in
the Nsp2 gene indicating highly virulent of PRRS viruses
[10,12]. The multiple deletions in this specific Nsp2
region reported in the Chinese isolates causes the socalled 'Swine high fever syndrome' [10]. The pathogenesis
of turning virulence of the Chinese viruses is still unclear
and needed to be elucidated. Fortunately, we did not see
any deletion in our Thai isolates similar to the Chinese
viruses.
Similar to other studies, the variation of ORF5 region can
be applied for identification and differentiation of the
PRRSV. In addition, ORF5 can also be used for the study
of genetic diversity of the viruses [3,17,21,22]. In this
study, 9 additional PRRS viruses were analyzed in the
ORF5 region. Phylogenetic analysis of ORF5 clearly separated US genotype and EU genotype, which both genotypes can be found circulating in Thailand (Fig 2). It has
been known that the US genotype is more diverse than the
EU genotype. However, in this study, all Thai EU-genotype isolates are more diverse and belonged to the EU genotype-Subtype 1, similar to some European isolates (The
Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, Poland and Italy) but not
the PRRSV from Eastern European which are belonged to
EU genotype-Subtype 2, 3 and 4 (Belarus and Lithuania)
[23]. Currently, both EU and US genotypes are still circulating in the Thai swine industry with predominantly the
US genotype (data not shown). Interestingly, our results

Virology Journal 2009, 6:143

indicated that all Thai PRRS viruses in this study had
evolved from the Thai PRRSV prototypes of both genotypes. No evidence of recent imported new PRRSV strains
was found in this study possibly due to the Department of
Livestock Development, Thailand do not allow the importation of PRRSV-positive animals.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our study provided full-length genome
sequences of the Thai PRRS viruses of both genotypes. The
genetic and cluster analysis of the Thai PRRSV of the EU
genotype (01CB1) may evolve from the EU prototype, the
Lelystad virus. On the other hand, the Thai PRRSV of the
US genotype (01NP1) may originate and evolve from the
US-MLV vaccine virus or its derivatives. It should be noted
that ORF1a (Nsp2) and ORF5 contained highly variable
regions and can be used as diagnostic markers for prevention and control of newly emerged PRRSV. This work
highlights the significance of full-length sequences of
PRRSV in Thailand for future studying of the genesis and
evolution of the PRRS viruses.

Methods
PRRS viruses
The Thai EU isolate (01CB1) used in this study was isolated from the nursery pigs having PRDC problem in
Chonburi province, the Eastern region of Thailand in
2001. The EU PRRSV caused reproductive failure in a
3,000 sow herd and later the respiratory disease with
moderate morbidity and mortality in the nursery pigs. The
Thai US isolate (01NP1) was isolated in Nakhon Pathom
province located in the central region of Thailand in the
same year from the nursery pigs in a 2,000 sow herd with
more than 10% loss after weaning. Both farms are practicing a continuous-flow system and piglets are weaned
weekly. The pathogenesis study of the 01CB1 and the
01NP1 virus was done and the 01CB1 was identified as a
low virulence strain while the 01NP1 was identified as a
high virulence strain. Based on ORF5 sequence analysis,
01CB1 and 01NP1 were characterized and grouped in the
EU and the US genotypes respectively [3]. Additional 9
PRRS viruses isolated in Thailand from 2002-2008 were
included in the study (Table 1). The viruses were later
identified as EU genotype (n = 3) and US genotype (n = 6)
based on ORF5 nucleotide sequencing and then include
in the phylogenetic analysis.
Virus isolation
Virus isolation was done from the lung tissues as previously described [24]. The cell culture-adapted viruses were
propagated in MARC-145 cells in minimum essential
medium (MEM) (Hyclone, USA) with 5% fetal calf serum
(FCS) (Hyclone, USA) for 3 passages. Immunoperoxidase
monolayer assay (IPMA) using SDOW-17 was used to
confirm the presence of PRRS virus [3]. The virus concen-

tration of 103 TCID50/ml was used for viral RNA preparation in this study.
Viral RNA and cDNA preparation
RNA isolation using QIAamp RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) was done on the stock virus solution
following the manufacture's instruction. In brief, 200 μl
of virus-containing supernatant was mixed with 200 μl
buffer AVL and incubated for 10 minutes. Then, 500 μl of
ethanol was added to the mixture. The mixture was then
transferred to QIAamp spin column and centrifuged at
8000 rpm for 2 min. The spin column was subsequently
washed with 500 μl of buffer AW1 and AW2 and centrifuged at 8000-14000 rpm for 3 min. Finally, 50 μl of
buffer AVE was added and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 3
min to elute viral RNA. cDNA synthesis was then performed by incubating viral RNA with 0.5 μg Random
primers (Promega, Madison, WI) at 70°C for 5 min and
then 4°C for 5 min. The mixture was then added with 1×
Improm-II reaction buffer (Promega), 0.5 mM dNTPs
(Fermentus), 2.5 mM MgCl2 (Promega), 10 U of Rnasin
Ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega) and 1 μl of Improm-II
Reverse Transcriptase. The mixture was incubated in thermal cycler at 25°C for 5 min, 42°C for 60 min and 70°C
for 15 min.
PRRSV genome sequencing
Oligonucleotide primers used in this study were designed
based on sequence information of the EU and US prototypes, LV and VR2332, respectively. Additional primers
were designed for gap closure to complete whole genome
sequences of the viruses. Sequence information of each
oilgonucleotide primers are provided in additional file 1.
PCR amplification of viral RNA was performed as previously described [3]. In brief, 25 μl of PCR reaction was
prepared by adding 2 μl of cDNA, 1× Eppendrof Master
Mix (Eppendrof, Hamburg, Germany) and 0.8 μM of oligonucleotide primer. The PCR reaction mixture was incubated in thermal cycler with condition: 95°C for 10 min
and 35 cycle of denaturation (95°C for 45 Sec), annealing
(55°C for 45 Sec), extension (72°C for 90 Sec), and final
extension of 72°C for 15 min. The PCR products were
then analyzed in 2% gel electrophoresis (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME). The PCR products were then purified
using the Perfectprep Gel Cleanup Kit (Eppendorf,) for
further DNA sequencing. The DNA sequencing reaction
was performed, using a commercially available kit (Big
Dye Terminator V.3.0 Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction;
Foster City, CA), at a final volume of 20 μl, containing 8
μl of dye terminator and 12 μl of specific sequencing
primer at the concentration of 3.2 pmol. The sequencing
products were analyzed with the ABI-Prism 310 Genetic
Analyzer (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT). ORF5 nucleotide
sequencing was also performed using the oligonucleotides specific for ORF5 and then subjected for DNA

Sequence alignment of NSP2 of PRRSV viruses (US strains). Deduced amino acids of NSP2 gene of 01NP1 were compared to those of US strains (MLV, VR2332, PA8, 16244B, SP and HUN4). No amino acid deletions position 482 and 533-561
were found in most US strain except HUN4 (solid blocks). While 36 amino acid insertions were observed in SP (Asian vaccine
strain) (dotted block).

sequencing. At least 4 coverages of viral nucleotide were
performed in the study, to ensure the quality of PRRS
genome sequencing.
Analysis of nucleotide and amino acid changes in PRRS
viruses
Genome assembly was conducted by using a computer
program SeqMan (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). In this
study, the full-length genome sequencing of 2 viruses
(01CB1 and 01NP1) was conducted to reach at least 4
time coverages of each virus. In addition, the chromatograms of nucleotide sequences of each PCR products were
rechecked and validated to ensure the type and position of
nucleotide and amino acid changes in PRRS genome. The
sequence alignment and amino acid comparison were
done by computer program, MegAlign (DNASTAR). The

phylogenetic analysis was performed using the PAUP version 4.0 software (Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA)
applying NJ algorithm with distance setting of total character difference and the MEGA3 software applying NJ
algorithm with Kimura 2- parameter. Bootstrap analysis
was conducted with 1000 replications. The nucleotide
sequences of the Thai PRRS viruses, 01CB1 and 01NP1
were submitted to the Genbank database under the accession numbers: [01CB1: DQ864705 and 01NP1:
DQ056373]. The ORF5 nucleotide sequences of 9 viruses
were also in the Genbank database under the accession
numbers: [FJ908074-FJ908082].
