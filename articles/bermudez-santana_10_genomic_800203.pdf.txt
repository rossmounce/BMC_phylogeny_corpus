Abstract
Background: Surprisingly little is known about the organization and distribution of tRNA genes and tRNA-related
sequences on a genome-wide scale. While tRNA gene complements are usually reported in passing as part of genome
annotation efforts, and peculiar features such as the tandem arrangements of tRNA gene in Entamoeba histolytica have
been described in some detail, systematic comparative studies are rare and mostly restricted to bacteria. We therefore
set out to survey the genomic arrangement of tRNA genes and pseudogenes in a wide range of eukaryotes to identify
common patterns and taxon-specific peculiarities.
Results: In line with previous reports, we find that tRNA complements evolve rapidly and tRNA gene and pseudogene
locations are subject to rapid turnover. At phylum level, the distributions of the number of tRNA genes and
pseudogenes numbers are very broad, with standard deviations on the order of the mean. Even among closely related
species we observe dramatic changes in local organization. For instance, 65% and 87% of the tRNA genes and
pseudogenes are located in genomic clusters in zebrafish and stickleback, resp., while such arrangements are relatively
rare in the other three sequenced teleost fish genomes. Among basal metazoa, Trichoplax adhaerens has hardly any
duplicated tRNA gene, while the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis boasts more than 17000 tRNA genes and
pseudogenes. Dramatic variations are observed even within the eutherian mammals. Higher primates, for instance,
have 616 ± 120 tRNA genes and pseudogenes of which 17% to 36% are arranged in clusters, while the genome of the
bushbaby Otolemur garnetti has 45225 tRNA genes and pseudogenes of which only 5.6% appear in clusters. In contrast,
the distribution is surprisingly uniform across plant genomes. Consistent with this variability, syntenic conservation of
tRNA genes and pseudogenes is also poor in general, with turn-over rates comparable to those of unconstrained
sequence elements. Despite this large variation in abundance in Eukarya we observe a significant correlation between
the number of tRNA genes, tRNA pseudogenes, and genome size.
Conclusions: The genomic organization of tRNA genes and pseudogenes shows complex lineage-specific patterns
characterized by an extensive variability that is in striking contrast to the extreme levels of sequence-conservation of
the tRNAs themselves. The comprehensive analysis of the genomic organization of tRNA genes and pseudogenes in
Eukarya provides a basis for further studies into the interplay of tRNA gene arrangements and genome organization in
general.
Background
Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are among the most ancient
genes. They can be traced back to the putative RNA
World [1] before the separation of the three Domains of
Life. There is clear evidence, furthermore, that all tRNA
gene are homologs, deriving from an ancestral " proto-

tRNA" [2], which in turn may have emerged from even
smaller components, see e.g. [3-7].
Besides their primary ancestral function in translation,
tRNAs appear to have acquired several additional modes
of employment throughout evolution. Several recent
studies, for instance, reported tRNA-derived small RNAs
in different Eukaryotic clades [8-12], which at least in
part appear to be utilized in the RNAi pathway. Furthermore, tRNA genes are a prolific source of repetitive elements (SINEs) [13], and of tRNA-derived small RNAs
such as the small brain-specific non-messenger RNA BC1
RNA [14,15] and other SINE-derived ncRNAs [16].

Multiple copies of functional tRNA genes, the existence
of numerous pseudo-genes and tRNA-derived repeats are
general characteristics of tRNA evolution throughout
Eukarya [17]. In general, tRNA genes appear to evolve
rapidly. In E. coli, the rate of tRNA gene duplication/deletion events is of the order of one per million years [18],
and a recent analysis of schistosome genomes revealed
striking differences in the tRNA complement between
the close related platyhelminths S. mansoni and S. japonicum [19].
Although the tRNAs themselves and their sequence
and structural evolution has received quite a bit of attention [20-23], much less is known about the genomic organization of tRNA genes. Recent evidence, however,
indicates that tRNA genes play a role in eukaryotic
genome organization [24] e.g. by acting as barriers that
separate chromatin domains. In trypanosomes, for example, tRNA genes mostly appear at the boundaries of transcriptional units and may be involved in the deposition of
special nucleosome variants in these regions [25]. Furthermore, there is a link between tRNA loci, in particular
clusters of tRNA genes, and chromosomal instability [2630]. A recent study showed that tRNA genes may act as
barriers to DNA replication fork progression [24], providing a possible mechanism for the formation of genomic
fragile sites. The genomic evolution of tRNA gene thus
may be linked to the evolution of genome organization.
Nevertheless, reports on clade-specific features, such as
the strong increase of tRNA introns in Thermoproteales
[31], are rare.
A peculiar feature of tRNA gene organization are tRNA
tandem repeats, which so far have been reported only in
the protistan parasite Entamoeba histolytica [32,33].
MicroRNAs derived from a precursor in which an imperfectly matched inverted repeat forms a partly doublestranded region, as observed in Chlamydomonas [34,35],
furthermore, suggests that head-to-head or tail-to-tail
arrangements of tRNA gene might form an evolutionary
source of small RNAs.
In this contribution, we survey the genomic distribution of tRNA genes and pseudogenes throughout the
Eukarya and provide a comprehensive comparative view
of the eukaryotic tRNA genomics. Our study makes use
of the near-perfect sensitivity and specificity of tRNAscan-SE[36], which reliably determines the complete
tRNA complement of eukaryotic genomes.

Results and Discussion
Numbers of tDNAs

For each of the 74 genomes included in our survey we
collected summary statistics on the number of tRNA
gene and tRNA pseudogenes as well as on their genomic
clusters. To simplify the language, we will use the term "
tDNA" to refer to both tRNA genes and tRNA pseudo-

Page 2 of 14

genes, while " tRNA gene" will be reserved to loci with
probably intact tRNA sequences. In practise, we use
tRNAscan-SE to distinguish between tRNA genes and
tRNA pseudogenes (see Methods for details).
We define two adjacent tRNA gene or tDNAs as " clustered" if their distance is less than 1000 nucleotides. This
threshold is motivated by a statistical analysis of the distances between adjacent tDNA loci, which shows that at
this distance we have to expect very few or no tDNA pairs
in the genomes under investigation (see Methods for
details). We then distinguish between homogeneous clusters, consisting of tDNA with the same isoacceptor family
(i.e., coding for the same aminoacid), and heterogeneous
clusters. Within clusters, we separately consider the three
relative orientations → →, ←→, and →←. Data have
been analyzed for putatively functional tRNA gene (as
classified by tRNAscan-SE), and for all tDNAs. Fig. 1
shows a sample of a graphical representation of the survey results. The full figure comprising all 74 genomes is
provided as Additional File 1. Complete lists of tDNAs in
gff format can be found at the website [37].
Despite an overall correlation with genome size, there
does not seem to be a general trend in the number of
tRNA genes. Although some mammals, for instance,
exhibit tens or even hundreds of thousands of tDNA copy
numbers, other mammalian genomes harbour only a few
hundred copies. For instance, old world monkeys and
great apes have about 616 ± 120 tDNAs, while the related
bushbaby (Otolemur garnetti) exhibits 45225 tDNAs. The
highest counts are reached for the cow and rat genomes
with more than 100000 tDNAs. For the 12 sequenced
Drosophila species, we find 320 ± 73 tDNAs. Trichoplax
adhaerans, one of the most basal animals has no more
than 50 tRNA genes, while the cnidaria Nematostella
vectensis has more than 17000. Within teleosts, tDNAs
range from about 700 in Tetraodontiformes to 20000 in
zebrafish. Variations by about an order of magnitude are
also common in other major clades. Naegleria gruberi, for
example has 924 tDNAs, while Kinetoplastids (Leishmania and Trypanosoma have only 91 and 65 copies). Surprisingly, the variation is very small in the " green
lineage". Spermatophyta show little variation with 706 ±
96 loci, the basal land plants Physcomitrella patens (432
tDNAs) and Selaginella moellendorffii (1290 tDNAs) and
even the unicellular algae Volvox carteri (1051 tDNAs)
and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (336 tDNAs) have similar numbers.
Despite the often large variation among even closely
related lineages, we observe the expected correlation
between the number of tDNAs with genome size, Fig. 2.
The correlation is significant, with correlation coefficient
ρ ∈ (0.71...0.76), but subject to a high level of variation
reflecting large differences in the evolutionary history of
different lineages. While the total number of tDNAs

scales approximately linearly with genome size, α = 0.93 ±
0.10, the growth in the number of intact, probably functional tRNA genes is much slower, consistent with N2/3.
The number of tRNA pseudogenes, on the other hand,
grows faster than linearly, ~N1.61 ± 0.18. The reasons for
this difference in scaling remains unclear. One may speculate that selective forces maintain only a limited number
of functional tDNA copies causing the sub-linear growth
of intact tRNA genes with genome size, while the duplication/deletion mechanism acts towards a uniform coverage of the genome with a rate that is to a first
approximation constant throughout eukaryotic genome,
accounting for the linear growth of the total number of
tDNAs.
Several selective forces could act on the tRNA genes
and/or all tDNA loci to cap their number. The bias
towards small deletions over insertions observed in [38]
is one potential candidate that is independent of special
properties of tRNAs. Variations in codon usage might
provide another selection-based explanation for the variation of tDNA copy numbers. In eubacteria, a correlation
between tRNA abundance, tRNA gene copy number, and
codon usage is well established [39]. Whether codon bias

causes tDNA copy number variation or vice versa
remains topic of an intense debate, however. A mechanistic explanation describing the coevolution of codon usage
with tRNA gene content is given in [40]. It remains
unclear to what extent the correlation of tRNA copy
numbers and codon usage carries over to eukaryotic
genomes. A detailed investigation in Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum finds no correlation
between tRNA gene numbers and codon usage, while a
statistically significant but still very weak correlation is
observed in Schmidtea mediterranea [19]. In Nasonia,
the correlation of codon usage and the copy numbers of
tRNA genes appears to be restricted to highly expressed
genes. The strength of this correlation decreases with
GC-content in plant genomes [41].
In any case, codon usage cannot be employed to explain
the observed differences in tDNA copy numbers that
span several orders of magnitude. These huge fluctuations, which are observed both within some lineages and
between closely related lineages, argues against a mechanism that relies on selection on the tRNAs. Instead, the
more than linear scaling of tRNA pseudogenes with
genome size suggests a faster tDNA turnover in larger

genomes - after all, pseudogenes and gene relics are steps
in the evolutionary degradation of genes.
tDNA clusters

In order to investigate the propensity for the formation of
tDNA clusters, we consider the cumulative distribution
of consecutive tDNA pairs as a function of their genomic
distance. Based on a statistical evaluation of the distances
between adjacent tDNAs (see Methods), we define two
tDNAs to be clustered in the genome if they are located
within 1000 nt.
Not surprisingly, in species with small tDNA copy
number, clusters typically are rare. In Trichoplax adherens, for instance, all tDNAs are isolated. There is no
clear-cut relation between tDNA copy number and clustering, however. In Nematostella vectensis 89% of the
tDNAs appear in clusters. In mammals, which have even
larger tDNA copy numbers, less than a quarter of the
tDNAs appear in clusters. Again, there do not appear to
be any large-scale phylogenetic regularities. In teleost
fishes, for example, the stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus has 87% clustered tDNAs, in zebrafish this number
reaches 65%. On the other hand, pufferfishes and medaka
(Oryzias latipes) have predominantly isolated tDNAs.
Similarly, large variation appears in other clades, see Fig.
1 and Additional File 2. Higher primates have 17% to 36%
of their tDNAs in clusters, with the exception of the
bushbaby Otolemur garnetii, with only 5.6% of its 45225
tDNAs located in clusters. In plants there are also no
clear regularities. The fraction of clustered tDNAs stays
below 25% in Spermatophyta, while the chlorophyceae

Volvox carteri and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have 41%
and 56% of their tDNAs localized in genomic clusters.
Most tDNA clusters are small, containing only a few colocalized tRNA genes. Typically, the frequency of larger
clusters quickly decreases, at least approximately following an exponential distribution. This is particularly obvious in the case of mammals and drosophilids. In some
cases, however, longer clusters are more abundant.
Exceptionally large tDNA gene clusters, with fifty and
more members, are observed for example in Nematostella and in the genomes of teleost fishes, Fig. 3.
The internal structure of tDNA clusters also differs
widely between lineages. Fig. 1 and Additional Files 2 and
3 summarize the relative abundances of homogeneous
and heterogeneous clusters, respectively. More precisely,
we record the fraction of adjacent tDNA pairs coding for
the same aminoacid. While Tetrahymena, Monosiga, and
the drosophilids exhibit mostly homogeneous pairs, we
observe mostly heterogeneous pairs in kinetoplastids,
Nematostella, clawed frog, and zebrafish, see Fig. 4 for an
example. In order to further investigate the structure of
heterogeneous clusters we determined how often combinations two isoacceptor families appear in adjacent pairs.
These data are conveniently represented in triangular
matrices such as those in Fig. 5. Homogeneous clusters
populate the main diagonal, whereas heterogeneous pairs
are represented by off-diagonal entries. As for other features of the genomic tRNA distribution there are neither
strong common patterns among all organisms investigated, nor are there systematic phylogenetic patterns.
While Monosiga, for example, has almost exclusively
homogeneous pairs, other species exhibit a wide variety
of heterogeneous pairs. In Danio, for instance, K-N, K-S,
and R-T are most frequent. In the cow genome, many
clusters involve tRNA pseudogenes, which are much less
prevalent in the other three examples. In the cow, C-C
pseudogenes account for more than 30% of the pairs. A
comprehensive collection of co-occurrence tables is provided as Additional File 3. Not surprisingly, there is a general trend towards more complex co-occurrence matrices
for species with larger numbers of tDNAs. Most adjacent
tDNA pairs in both homogeneous and heterogeneous
clusters have parallel orientation. If the arrangements
were random, we would expect that 50% of pairs are of
this type. In many cases, e.g. Arabidopsis, Selaginella,
Xenopus, or Danio, nearly all pairs are in parallel. Among
the anti-parallel pairs, some species have a strong bias for
either head-to-head (e.g. primates, and Cryptococcus) or
tail-to-tail arrangements (Oryza and Caenorhabiditis).
Even within primates, the ratio of head-to-head and tailto-tail pairs varies considerably.
In most species with very large tDNA copy numbers we
can expect some tDNA clusters to appear by chance. We
tested this by randomizing the tDNA locations (see

Methods for details). The results for eutherian mammals
are compiled in Tab. 1, a full list of random pair configuration is given in Additional File 2. In most genomes,
there are significantly more tDNA pairs than expected,
suggesting a mode of tDNA evolution of favours the formation of local clusters. Local DNA duplications, also
underlying the copy number variations within many populations (see e.g. [42,43] and the references therein), are
of course the prime suspects.
We observe significant under-representations of tDNA
pairs only in a few species with very high tDNA counts:
Dasypus novemcinctus, Felis catus, and Loxodonta afri-

cana. At present, we have no biological explanation for
this observation.
Clusters of tDNAs have been implicated in interfering
with the DNA replication forks [26]. The tDNA clusters
might thus be instrumental in orchestrating the timing of
DNA replication. On the other hand, replication fork
pause sites are associated with genomic instability [27-30]
and hence may contribute to the rapid evolution of these
tDNA clusters. Furthermore, retrotransposable elements
tend to select tRNA genes as chromosomal integration
sites [44], appearently in order to avoid gene disruptions
upon retrotransposition. A recent comparison of yeast
genomes associated genomic rearrengements, losses, and

additions with tRNA genes [45]. Taken together, tDNA
clusters thus appear as highly dynamic unstable genomic
regions.
Synteny

Transfer RNAs have been reported to behave similar to
repetitive elements as far as their genomic mobility is
concerned. They appear to evolve via a rapid duplicationdeletion mechanism that ensures that copies of tRNA
genes within a genome are usually more similar to each
other than tRNA gene of different species [18,46]. In E.
coli, for example, the rate of tRNA gene duplication/deletion events has been estimated to be about one event
every 1.5 million years [18]. We are not aware of (semi)quantitative estimates from eukaryotes. Our analysis is
consistent with this mechanism (see below).
Since tRNA genes with the same anticodon are typically
nearly identical, the only way to estimate rates of tRNA
gene turnover is to determine, for each tRNA-bearing
locus, whether tDNAs can be found in a syntenic locations in evolutionarily related species. We have determined such data here for eight selected species, including
six mammals, namely the Catarrihni Homo sapiens, Pan
troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus, and Macaca mulatta, the
rodent Mus musculus, and the Marsupialia Monodelphis
domestica. The data set includes also more distant vertebrates Gallus gallus and Xenopus tropicalis to investigate
whether there are tDNAs with very stable genomic locations.
Tab. 2 shows the results for the one- and two-side linkage analysis (see Section Methods). The number of
related synteny regions based on the single-side linkage
analysis is significantly higher than the region number
created by the two-side linkage analysis. Since the latter
analysis approach is more restrictive, the results between
both analysis approaches also differ. While synteny
regions in related species are mostly assigned by the single-side linkage analysis, the results of the two-side link-

age analysis are more differentiated. Therefore, we
discuss only the results of two-side linkage analysis in the
following.
Within Catarrhini, tDNA locations are quite well conserved. For instance 80% (394/493) of human tDNA
regions are conserved in the chimp, and there are still
63% (284/450) of the rhesus tDNA locations recovered in
chimp. Somewhat surprisingly, there is also a large fraction of syntenic loci between mouse and opossum (80%
[19,466/24,352] of the mouse loci and 76% [16,634 of
21,810] of the opossum loci). We suspect that the large
fraction is confounded by the large overall number of
tDNA loci and the rather larger intervals of five flanking
genes used to define synteny, which taken together cover
a substantial fraction of the genome. A second group of
comparisons identified only a small number of syntenically conserved loci. Asymmetric results, which large
retention in one direction is observed when the tDNA
numbers are dramatically different. This concerns the
comparisons between Catharrini, on the one hand, and
opossum and mouse on the other hand. Between frog and
Catharrini, finally, there is only a small number of syntenically conserved tDNAs.
We also analyzed the tDNA mobility in two invertebrate clades, drosophilids and nematode genus
Caenorhabditis. Within these nematodes, we observe a
rather high degree of syntenic conservation, ranging from
45% between C. elegans and C. japonica up to 84% for the
most closely related pair C. remanei and C. brenneri. In
general, conservation levels are consistent to the known
phylogeny of the Caenorhabditis species [47]. For the
genus Drosophila with the twelve common representatives, on the other hand, there is much less syntenic conservation. The lowest value is 17% (D. wilistoni and D.
persimilis). The best conserved tDNA arrangements are
observed between the two closely related species D. simulans and D. sechellia with 78%. On average, the percentage of conservation is just around 50% or less. Full data

4 for Drosophila.
The sequence conservation of syntenically conserved
tRNAs is consistent with the duplication/deletion mechanisms. Additional File 5 shows a neighbor-joining tree of
the tRNA-Ala sequences of nematodes, which includes
also a few additional species that are not part of the

genome-wide survey. We find that syntenically conserved
tRNAs genes are typically conserved with an identical
sequence across species, even though some tRNAs with
the same anticodon located elsewhere in the genome
show small sequence variations.
The fraction of syntenically conserved tDNAs correlates with the divergence of the genomes at sequence

level, Fig. 6 and Tab. 4. The correlation is significant even
though the data is rather noisy, a fact that can be
explained at least in part by the unavoidable artifacts
resulting from our approach. Utilizing annotation data
directly to determine local synteny is problematic, for
instance, near members of very large recently duplicated
gene families. In principle, syntenic conservation could
be inferred more accurately from genome-wide alignments. Since tDNAs are treated like repetitive elements
in the currently available pipelines, this strategy cannot
be employed in practice. Nevertheless, the method provides at least a crude estimate of the tDNA turnover rate,
indicating the tDNAs are relocated at time-scales only 25 times slower than background mutation rate, i.e., at an
evolutionary distance of 1 mutation per site, 20% to 60%
of the tDNAs have been deleted or relocated in one lineage.
These values should be regarded as upper bounds of
syntenic conservation, i.e., tDNA turnover is probably
even faster. For example, the identity of the tDNA (i.e., its
anticodon) was not used in the analysis. Despite of the
high mobility of tDNAs there are some ancient conserved
loci. We further investigated two of the 77 syntenic loci
conserved between Xenopus and Human in which
tDNAs with the same anticodon were retained. Manual
inspection of the flanking protein coding genes confirmed synteny. Neither locus is syntenically conserved in
stickleback, lamprey or lancet, however.

Conclusions
We have developed a pipeline based on tRNAscanSE[36] to extract and analyze the locations of tRNA genes
and pseudogenes of eukaryotic genomes. In our analysis,

we focus not only on the number of tRNA genes, but also
on their relative genomic locations, and in particular on
the formation of tDNA clusters. Surprisingly, we found
no distinctive clade-specific features or large scale trends,
with the exception of the rather straightforward observation that the larger metazoan genomes typically tend to
harbour large numbers of tDNAs.
In some species, large clusters of tDNAs occur. This
effect has first been reported in Entamoeba histolytica.
The origin of this gene organization in the genus Entamoeba clearly predates the common ancestor of the species
investigated to date. Their function of the array-like
structure remains unclear [32]. We report here that this
phenomenon is not restricted to a particular clade of protists but rather appears independently in many times
throughout eukaryotes.
In most eukaryotes, tRNAs are multi-copy genes with
little or no distinction between paralogs so that orthology
is hard to establish, in particular in the presence of tRNA
gene clusters. As a consequence, the evolution of
genomic tRNA arrangements is non-trivial to study over
larger time-scales. Upper bounds on syntenic conservation can be estimated, however, by considering small sets
of flanking protein coding genes for which homology
information can be retrieved from existing annotation.
We found that tRNAs change their genomic location at
time-scales comparable to mutation rates: syntenic conservation fades at roughly the same evolutionary distances as sequence conservation in unconstrained
regions.
The absence of large numbers of partially degraded
tRNA copies in many of the investigated genomes provides a hint at the mechanisms of tRNA mobility: At least
in part the relocation events appear to be linked to chromosomal rearrangements rather than mere duplicationdeletion of the tRNA genes themselves. The latter mechanism, which appears to be prevalent e.g. in mitochondrial
genomes [48], certainly also plays a role, since tRNA
pseudogenes are readily observed in many species, as do
tRNA retrogenes [49]. A link between tRNA loci, and in
particular tRNA clusters, and chromosomal instability

has been pointed out repeatedly in the literature, showing
that tRNA genes can interfere with the replication forks
[26-30]. The data collected here provide a basis to investigate this connection more systematically in the future.
Overall, the tRNA complement of Eukaryotes is highly
dynamic part of the genomes whose organization evolves
rapidly and in a highly lineage specific manner - a behavior that is in striking contrast to the extreme conservation
of sequence and function of the tRNAs themselves.

Methods
Sequence data

We retrieved 74 eukaryotic genome mainly from the following public resources: NCBI, Ensemble Genome
Browser and Joint Genome Institute. For a detailed list of
the individual genome assemblies we refer to the Additional File 6.
tRNA detection

Detection of tRNAs was performed by using tRNAscan-SE v.1.23 (April 2002) with default parameters,
i.e., the TRNA2.cm covariance with strict filter parameter
32.1 was used to screen each genome for tRNAs and
tRNA pseudogenes. All analyses were performed using
both the set of all intact, putatively functional tRNAs
identified by tRNAscan-SE and using all tDNA loci, i.e.,
the union of tRNA genes and tRNA pseudogenes.
The distinction of tRNA genes and pseudogenes necessarily relies of a set of heuristics implemented in tRNAscan-SE. These are well-founded in what is known
about functional tRNA genes [50-55]. Processing and recognition of specific tRNAs imposes stringent constraints
on the sequence (and secondary structure) of tRNAs; several nucleotides of mature tRNAs need to chemically

modified in most species, imposing further constraints
on the primary sequence. tRNAscan-SE's consensus
models implement these contraints with reasonable accuracy but by no means perfectly. In the absence of detailed
experimental information on the expression and the
functionality of a particular tDNA it is of course impossible to distinguish between tRNA genes and tRNA
pseudogenes with absolute certainty. For the statistical
evaluation of genome-wide comparison reported here,
however, the accuracy of tRNAscan-SE appears to be
sufficient [21,36,56]. There are, however, several sources
for errors, in particular in the presence of RNA editing
e.g. in the mitochondrial tRNAs of many plants and the
protist [57-60]. Such organellar data are not considered in
this contribution, however.
tRNA-geo pipeline The tRNA-geo pipeline is a Perl
program that parses tRNAscan-SE output and produces summary information as well as overview graphics
such as those shown in Figs. 1 and 5. First tDNA locations
are sorted in consecutive order along each input
sequence, distances are measures (see below for exact
definitions), tDNA pairs and tDNA clusters are identified, summary statistics are computed. Graphics are produced using PSTricks macros and LaTeX.
Every tDNA is represented by a quadruple P = (a, b, o,
t), where a < b are the start and end positions within each
input sequence (chromosome, scaffold, or contig), and o
∈ {+, -} is the orientation of the tRNAs. We say that two
tDNAs are of the same type t if they belong the same
isoacceptor family, i.e., if they code for the same aminoacid. The tRNA loci are ordered such that Pi ՞ Pj if and
only if ai <aj. The distance between two consecutive loci
Pi and Pi+1 is defined as δi = ai+1-bi.

Bermudez-Santana et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:270
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/270

A cluster C is a maximal sub-sequence of loci C = (Pi,
Pi+1, ..., Pj) such that δk < 1000 for i ≤ k <j. The cut-off of
1000 was chosen because the overwhelming majority of
consecutive tDNA pairs in the random control have
larger distances while a large fraction of the tDNA pairs
in the real data have smaller distances than this cut-off
value, see Fig. 7 here.
A cluster is called homogeneous if all its tDNAs are of
the same type tk; otherwise, it is called heterogeneous. A
sub-sequence consisting of two consecutives loci located
within a cluster C is called a pair. The pair (Pi, Pi+1) is
homogeneous if ti = ti+1 and heterogeneous otherwise. A
pair has parallel orientation if oi = oi+1. For anti-parallel
pairs, oi = oi+1, we distinguish head-to-head oi = + and oi+1
= - (←→), and tail-to-tail oi = - and oi+1 = + (→←) orientations.
In order to test whether the observed proportion of
homogenous and inhomogeneous pairs depends strongly
on whether tRNA pseudogenes are included in the analysis, we used Fisher's exact test. Differences in proportion
are significant only in a few species, typically those with
very large number of tDNAs (see Additional File 7) suggesting that pseudogenization and degradation of tRNA
genes is to a first approximation independent of the
mutual positioning of tDNAs.
Simulations

In order to investigate the statistical significance of the
tDNA pairs we compare the genomic tDNA organization
with randomized configurations. To this end, we remove
the collection of tRNA genes and pseudogenes from the
genome and re-insert them at positions chosen from a
uniform distribution on the remaining sequence. Empirical p-values, defined as

Page 11 of 14

p = #{i | y(i) ≥ x} / N ,

(1)

where y(i) is the number of clustered tRNAs in replicate
i, x is the number of clustered tRNAs in the genome, are
determined from N = 50 to N = 1000 random replicates.
For large (insignificant) p-values, simulations were terminated at fewer replicates to save computer time.
Statistical tests were performed using the R statistics
environment [61]. In particular, Fisher's exact test [62]
with 2 × 2 contingency tables was used to determine
whether different filtering procedures influenced the proportion of homogeneous versus heterogeneous tDNA
pairs.
Synteny

To analyze the synteny between species, we utilized two
different pipelines depending on available genomic data
and their interrelations in public data sources. The BioFuice [63] integration platform is used to analyze the
synteny in eight different vertebrate species Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus, Macaca mulatta,
Mus musculus, Monodelphis domestica, Gallus gallus,
and Xenopus tropicalis. The analysis runs in several steps.
Firstly, the Ensembl data source (version 53) is utilized to
create the genomic mappings between the tRNAs and/or
tRNA pseudogenes and at most five consecutive proteincoding flanking genes in both directions, up- and downstream. The number 5 was chosen pragmatically as a
trade-off between the need to evaluate local information
and the unavoidable incompleteness of genome annotations, whence homologs of many genes are missing in
individual genomes. These genomic mappings are chromosome- and strand-specific, i.e., the resulting genes are
located on the same chromosome and strand as the input
tDNAs. Next, the resulting genes are associated to protein-coding genes of other mammalian species using the
homologous data available in Ensembl Compara (version

Figure 7 Cumulative distribution of tDNA pairs distances. Measured data are shown in red, random expectation from randomly placed tDNAs are
shown as gray background. At a distance of 1000 nt the vast majority of clusters cannot be explained by the random background.

Bermudez-Santana et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:270
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/270

53). These homology relationships between genes in different species are then filtered to focus on those genes
flanking tRNAs. Finally, tDNAs of different mammals can
be associated based on the genomic mappings to their
flanking genes (gene-tRNA) and the homology relations
between those (gene-gene). We consider two alternatives
for creating such tDNA relationships:
1. Two tDNAs are associated by the single-sided linkage relation if there is at least one homology relationship between their pre-selected flanking genes. Here
we do not require that the homologous genes have the
same relative orientation or relative location w.r.t. to
the tDNAs.
2. Two tDNAs are associated by the two-sided linkage
relation if there is at least one pair of homologous
genes in both the up-stream and the down-stream
region. Again, relative orientations are not taken into
account. The tDNAs need to be located between the
two homologous gene-pairs, however.
The Single-sided linkage relation turns out to be not
very informative because many-to-many homology relations for large gene families and the relatively large
regions used to define the synteny relation severely limit
the sensitivity. We therefore limit a details discussion to
the two-sided linkage relation.
For invertebrate genomes, synteny information was
extracted directly from genome annotation using a custom-made pipeline based on Perl and awk scripts. For
the nematodes C. elegans, C. briggsae, C. japonica, C.
brenneri, C. remanei we considered a region of 40.000 nt
up- and downstream of the tRNA loci. A pair of tDNAs
was defined as syntenic if we could found in this range at
least two orthologous proteins between them. The flanking proteins were taken from the genome annotation gfffiles from Wormbase WS204. A list of orthologous proteins was computed using OrthoMCL [64] to determine if
two proteins are ortholog. Tab. 3 summarizes the prevalence of tRNA synteny within the genus Caenorhabditis.
The tDNAs in the genus Drosophila were analyzed in the
same way. The flanking proteins were take from Flybase (release FB2009_09). Since a sufficiently complete
orthology annotation was not readily available, we used
ProteinOrtho [65] for this purpose. The results are
compiled in Additional File 4.
The fraction of syntenically conserved tDNAs was
compared to the evolutionary distances for each pair of
genomes in the three data sets described above. The evolutionary distance for the Vertebrates and Nematodes is
gathered by the tree model underlying the UCSC 28-way
alignments [66]. For the genus Drosophila the evolutionary distances are genomic mutation distances computed
from 4-fold degenerated sites in all coding regions corrected for base composition as in [67].
