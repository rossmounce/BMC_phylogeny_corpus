Abstract
This review is atypical by design. It has used a synthesis of the available literature relating to the
aetiology of AIS to draw attention to the lack of progress in this area despite intensive research for
more than 100 years. The review has argued that if progress is to be made in this area then
significant changes in approach to the problem must be made. Such changes have been outlined and
major areas of potential focus identified with the intention of creating debate and discussion. There
is no doubt that people are working hard in this area of research but this review has deliberately
attempted to question its achievements and future directions.

Introduction
This paper is not a typical review of the literature that
might be expected when considering a review of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). In this electronic age, using
keywords such as 'scoliosis review' in Google or a medical
database quickly reveals an enormous amount of material
on this topic which should satisfy those people seeking
fundamental, factual material (1478 'hits' by simply typing just 'scoliosis review' into PubMed database) [1-7].
Instead, this paper uses a synthesis of the available material to provide direction for future, more-productive and
successful research.
Scoliosis has been recognized since at least the time of
Hippocrates and presents itself as an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine accompanied by vertebral rotation.
Interestingly, the plasticity of the elements of the spine
allows scoliosis to take many different forms dependent

on the multitude of different forces being applied to the
various tissues making complex any classification and recognition of underlying causes. Some causes of scoliosis
are readily apparent (e.g. congenital hemivertebra) and
such cases have been removed from the general population of scoliosis patients because the underlying mechanism can be explained. Similarly, several diseases have
been associated with scoliosis development (e.g. poliomyelitis, neurofibromatosis) and these too have been
removed from the general pool of patients even though
the underlying mechanism for the development of scoliosis is sometimes not clearly understood. However, even
with the removal of these cases from the general pool of
patients with scoliosis, there remains a large pool of
patients (80%) who are justifiably classified as having idiopathic scoliosis because the cause remains unknown.
Consequently, idiopathic scoliosis is a diagnosis by elim-

ination rather than by positive identification which is a
significant distinction.

from the literature. Maybe another conclusion can be
drawn:

Idiopathic scoliosis has three apparent peaks of time for
diagnosis: congenital, infantile, and adolescent. AIS manifests itself at the time of puberty. Accordingly this paper
focuses on AIS which is the most common type of scoliosis and which has received the most attention.

If major advances in understanding the aetiology of AIS are to
be made, then the methods currently being used and the
approaches being made must be changed because they have not
been very productive so far.

Previous research into AIS
A simple review of the mountain of available literature
shows that the aetiology of AIS has been explored extensively for more than 100 years. Seemingly, every conceivable aspect of development and tissue associated with the
spine appears to have been placed under close scrutiny
using the best techniques available at that time often with
repeat evaluations occurring as techniques have improved
or become available. Interestingly, the basic conclusions
from this research can be synthesized as follows:

The development of AIS is associated with:
- the growth spurt at the time of puberty
- greater severity of curve development in females than males
- multiple variations of deformity (single curves, double curves,
curves to the left or right, different vertebral levels involved, different degrees of curvature)

It has been said that one sign of madness is to continue
doing the same thing repeatedly and expect different
results. If the current methods to study the aetiology of
AIS continue to be applied, why should different results
be expected when such intense, detailed research in the
past has revealed so little? What changes should be made
if advancement in an understanding of the aetiology of
AIS is to be achieved?
Basic question to answer and its effects on experimental
design
To study the aetiology of AIS efficiently and effectively, an
experimental model needs to be developed to form the
foundation of any experiments. The results from the
experiments will either support the model as being correct
or provide direction for making changes which can then
be tested further. Fundamental to any model for the study
of AIS is the question:

Do all cases of AIS have the same single underlying cause or are
the abnormal curvatures the common end-result of several different causes?

- an inheritance within families
Unfortunately, despite the intensity of the research over
such a long period of time, these are the only reliable conclusions that can be made. When you consider the time
and money that has been directed towards producing
these few conclusions it is disappointing to realize that an
observant visitor to a scoliosis clinic could reach the same
conclusions probably within 20 minutes.
Why is this? Why have more significant advances into
understanding the aetiology of AIS not been made? In
contrast, there have certainly been significant advances
made in the treatment strategies used for AIS and this area
forms the bulk of presentations and materials at research
meetings. The lack of parallel advancement in understanding the aetiology of AIS is disturbing and disappointing. It is further surprising because a better understanding
of the aetiology of AIS would presumably result in the
development of better treatment strategies but while there
has been much interest, there has been little useful
advancement.
With further thought, perhaps the four conclusions outlined above are not the only ones that could be drawn

While this is a very simple question, the answer has enormous consequences especially for experimental design
and is an important question to be considered when viewing the available research literature.
If the answer selected on which to build an experimental
model is that all cases of AIS have the same single underlying cause, then the traditional experimental design
would be to obtain samples or measurements from a
group of patients who have severe AIS (extreme cases) and
compare the results to similar ones collected in the same
way from a group of control subjects. The focus of the
experiment would be on identifying any significant differences between the mean values of the measurements
taken from each group. Experiments with this basic design
are common in the literature but the results for any
parameter being examined vary widely. It is no surprise
that there is confusion and little forward progress being
made when results from similar experiments are so
diverse. Alternatively, perhaps there is a message in this
important and extensive literature that has been overlooked. Perhaps the wide diversity and inconsistency in
the results from similar experiments is suggesting strongly
that the model being used (a single cause) might be wrong

Page 2 of 7

Scoliosis 2008, 3:5

and that AIS actually has several different underlying
causes (the alternative model).
If the true experimental model for AIS should be built on
the premise of there being several different causes then no
significant differences for any parameter would be
expected using the traditional experimental design. Consider the following situation: if the hypothesis was that
there were fewer spindles in the vertebral muscles of
patients with AIS (hypothetical) then the traditional
experimental design would include samples being collected from patients with AIS and appropriate controls.
The samples would be sectioned and stained and the
number of muscle spindles counted and compared
between the experimental and control groups. Unfortunately, the mean values of the two groups of subjects
would probably be very similar and not significantly different even though the hypothesis being examined (e.g.
fewer muscle spindles) might well be an underlying cause
of AIS. If fewer muscle spindles are the basic cause in only
10% of AIS patients, then their contribution to the mean
values of numbers of muscle spindles in the group of AIS
patients will be overwhelmed by the normal values from
the 90% of AIS patients in the same group who have normal values but whose underlying cause is quite different.
Unfortunately, this experimental design has been the used
in many experiments performed in search of the aetiology
of AIS and, not surprisingly, no reliable evidence has been
found to support any conclusions for any parameter studied. In experiments designed in this way, the interesting
values would be those of the 'outliers' in the experimental
group rather than the mean values of the whole group but
these extreme values rarely get reported.
If AIS has multiple, different causes then experiments
designed with a single-cause being the underlying mechanism (such as described above) will not reveal any meaningful results even if the suspected cause of scoliosis being
tested is quite valid. Reviewing the literature from this
point of view suggests very strongly that the diverse results
obtained so far confirm that AIS is the common end result
of several different causes and not just a single cause common to all cases. Contributors to conferences and authors
of manuscripts should be required to explain their experimental design to clarify this issue.
Is there just one cause remaining to be found within the
patients with AIS?
As groups of patients with associated diseases have been
culled from the group of AIS patients, the associated disease has been recognized as the underlying cause. As these
groups have been removed, the number of underlying
causes within the remaining AIS group presumably has
been reduced by one. This raises an interesting question:

http://www.scoliosisjournal.com/content/3/1/5

In the current population of patients diagnosed with AIS, is
there just one cause remaining to be identified or are there still
several different causes within the population that are simply
proving more difficult to identify?
For example, currently there is considerable discussion
related to identification of syringomyelocoele in boys as
being an underlying cause of scoliosis and debate exists
over whether or not such cases should be removed from
the general AIS pool. On this basis alone, it seems most
likely that among patients currently diagnosed with AIS
several separate causes have yet to be identified within the
population rather than there being a single underlying
cause common to all.
In contrast, the evidence to support AIS having just a single underlying cause is very limited. Certainly, curve progression seems to have many common characteristics and
AIS can usually be recognized from a series of radiographs
taken of a patient but there is not much else.
Confounding issues affecting the research
Vacuous but critical time period when no measurements of patients
with AIS are available
When a child develops AIS, they are unaware of its development in the early stages when the curve is small. Usually, it requires observation of sloping shoulders or other
physical characteristic by another person before the lateral
curve is recognized. By this time, the curve is already quite
large for this manifestation to be noticed and has probably been present for several months, if not years, before a
specialist is seen. This period of time when the abnormal
spinal curves were first developing is critical for research
purposes because the underlying cause will be present and
yet it is a time of anonymity when no measurements can
be made. Extrapolation of later measurements into this
time period have proved to be limited because treatment
strategies have affected curve development and, consequently, any extrapolation procedures.
The underlying cause might have gone at the time of examination
and further curve development is purely a biomechanical problem
The biomechanics associated with spinal curve development are complex and not well understood. As it is usually several months (18?) from the time the curve started
to when it is first recognized in a patient with AIS, it is possible that the underlying problem causing the development of the curve has been corrected without any
treatment. The continued curve progression seen in AIS
patients might then be due entirely to the biomechanical
aspects of curve development rather than the continued
effects of the underlying problem. In these cases, the
patient with AIS might be completely normal when being
examined! In particular, the experimental group in any
experiment might well be perfectly normal in regards to

Scoliosis 2008, 3:5

the hypothesis being tested even though the hypothesis
was in fact true – but only at the early stages of development. Presumably this would be particularly important
when considering possible causes such as differences in
hormonal production or timing of hormonal changes,
parameters that are very evident during puberty and
which might well have harmonized by the time of measurement. It is certainly a problem when patients with
severe AIS are selected for the experimental group
because, while such patients certainly represent the
extreme cases, they are usually much older than when
their curve first started to develop – which is the most
important time for examination to identify the underlying
cause. Unfortunately, the time of initial curve development cannot be identified.
Unable to separate cause from effect
At present, patients with AIS cannot be identified prior to
initial development of the spinal curve. There is no
marker available which can predict future scoliosis development. Consequently, it is almost impossible to separate
cause from effect of the scoliosis from any measurement
taken from patients with AIS because there are no earlier
measurements available for comparison. This makes
interpretation of results from experiments involving AIS
patients very difficult to interpret as a genuine cause of
scoliosis with any degree of confidence when considering
the experimental parameter because any significant
changes found could be the result of the scoliosis.
Necessity of bipedal stance ensures no appropriate animal model
can be identified
A bipedal stance appears to be necessary for development
of scoliosis and Man is the only true bipedal animal. Bipedalism arose in Man because the increased lumbosacral
angle allowed Man to hold his head and torso high while
retaining quadrupedal characteristics in the pelvis and
lower limbs, necessary for locomotion. No other animal
appears to have adopted the same evolutionary pattern.
Consequently, the selection of an animal on which to
develop a research model is very difficult. Avians, with
their pseudo-bipedal stance, have been used with some
success but there is a large phylogenetic gulf between birds
and mammals and significant differences in physiology
and biochemistry make progress in understanding any
mechanism very difficult. For example, pinealectomy in
newly-hatched chickens often results in scoliosis development but similar surgery in young mammals (quadrupeds) has no effect UNLESS they are also made bipedal by
removal of their upper limbs and tail. This model certainly has potential but questions remain concerning the
effects associated with the extent of deviation from normal morphology as well as actual time spent in a bipedal
stance when compared to normal, quadrupedal mammals.

http://www.scoliosisjournal.com/content/3/1/5

Multifactorial and multi-elemental
A strong case has been made in this review to suggest that
among the population of patients with AIS there are several, different underlying causes that remain to be identified. Consequently, the cause of AIS is described as being
multifactorial. Unfortunately, the problem is probably
much more complex than simply being a series of different underlying causes because each separate cause might
consist of several contributing elements themselves. For
any single underlying cause, these constituent elements
might also not be equal in importance with some elements being essential for future curve development while
others may or may not need to be present either alone or
in combination with the other elements for any spinal
curve to develop. This interweaving of the threads associated with scoliosis development creates a complex knot
and, currently, there is insufficient data to create a theoretical model on which to build.
Areas of research that appear to have the potential for the
greatest success in the near future
Detailed re-read of the literature
Despite the criticism of the available literature outlined
above, there remains a wealth of information contained
in the literature which could be gained by re-reading the
literature using a different approach. The useful data is
mixed in with data from badly designed experiments
which have been designed based on a model of AIS having
a single underlying cause (as described above). Such
experiments need to be identified and their data re-evaluated and either removed or incorporated into a new database of information. In particular, the outliers from
experiments designed with a single cause as the model
should be identified if possible and their values looked at
very carefully.
Development of an idea related to the underlying cause of scoliosis
If many underlying causes for AIS remain to be identified,
then they need to be evaluated and explored separately.
However, this cannot be approached in the traditional
way of collecting samples and measurements from a
group of patients with AIS and comparing these values
with similar measurements from a control group. Instead,
a new approach needs to be developed along the lines of:

- develop a theory based on the literature and thoughtful
ideas
- consider if it can be demonstrated in an appropriate animal model
- outline the symptoms that would be seen in a specific
group of patients with scoliosis if the theory was correct

Page 4 of 7
(page number not for citation purposes)

Scoliosis 2008, 3:5

- search for such patients retroactively or among current
patients
This approach is far more laborious (needle in a haystack?) than the traditional approach but any results
would be positive and constructive.
Genetics
There are two types of molecular approach that would be
productive:
Mendelian genetics
It is well recognized that there is a familial relationship in
scoliosis. However, this relationship is confusing and not
well defined probably because of the complex nature of
AIS, especially the multifactorial (more than one cause)
and multi-elemental nature of the underlying cause. The
environmental influence on scoliosis development is also
unknown but the fact that there is only 70% concordance
in identical twins diagnosed with AIS illustrates its significance. Similarly, it is interesting to note that the concordance between dizygotic twins (basically, siblings in the
same uterus) is only 37% and yet the concordance
between non-twin siblings is only 6–7%. Such differences
raise the question of what influence does prenatal environment have on scoliosis development? The data to
explain these differences and the influence of the environment on scoliosis development needs to be expanded so
that the focus of research can be more directed.
Molecular genetics
Currently, identifying genes that are different to normal in
patients with a specific disease is receiving major attention
in many areas other than AIS. In some instances, single
specific genes have been identified and make for dramatic
headlines. Other diseases have been found to be much
more complex with several, if not many, genes being identified as being involved with the disease. AIS falls into the
latter group of diseases even though there have been headlines claiming the finding of just single genes being identified as the underlying cause of scoliosis. Again, the
problem would probably be reduced if it was possible to
identify curves that had developed from different causes
and study them separately but, currently, the pool of AIS
patients is heterogeneous with a mix of all types of underlying cause in most cases. Certainly, more-refined strategies where members from the same family are being
examined will probably reduce the number of suspect
genes but if the underlying, single cause has many constituent elements then the situation and model to be developed becomes very complicated and continues to be
difficult to solve. Adding to the complexity, the concordance for AIS between monozygotic twins is only 70%
which implies that there are some people with identical
DNA where one has developed scoliosis while the other

http://www.scoliosisjournal.com/content/3/1/5

has not. Furthermore, how do you identify the contributing genes for scoliosis among family members where the
DNA is not identical when scoliosis may or may not
develop among people with identical DNA! Similarly, if
the complexity of the multifactorial, multi-elemental
model proposed for the aetiology of AIS in this review is
accepted, then it is quite possible that the lack of concert
in gene expression for the elements within a single cause
means that some members of the same family will possess
similar critical genes but because of the differences in timing patterns, some members of the family develop scoliosis while others do not. This will be a long and difficult
process [8].
It used to be thought that 'one gene' meant 'one protein
(or enzyme)' but recent advances in cell biology have
revealed that gene expression is modified at various levels
before protein expression occurs with, in at least one case,
at least 180 proteins being found to be expressed from
one gene. The unexpected, relatively few genes found in
the human genome appears to have been a mask to hide
the real complexity and volume of proteins being
expressed.
Nevertheless, given the success of molecular genetic
research in making progress in understanding the aetiology of other diseases, a molecular genetic approach to the
aetiology of AIS appears to have the best chance for longterm success. Perhaps it is also possible to make even
more rapid progress by copying the methods employed in
research of a disease with similar characteristics to AIS but
it is difficult to identify one which might be appropriate
for comparison because of its complexity. Suggestions for
a comparative disease might include cancer and autism,
both of which appear to have similar end-results among
their patients but which have apparently many different
underlying causes. However, it must be realized that even
though the genetic differences from normal have been recognized for many years in many diseases, very little
progress has been made in introducing corrective genes to
the patient.
Revelation of the path between cause and curve development
Even if an association is made between scoliosis and a particular characteristic (e.g. poliomyelitis, cerebral palsy)
there is a long path and much explanation required to
connect the underlying mechanism with the development
of a spinal curve. What is perceived as an association
between a particular characteristic and AIS must be connected to a mechanism to produce the spinal curve – and
this is often a very difficult and complex path to understand and isolate. Nevertheless, research in this area
would be valuable because it would provide insight into
the mechanisms of scoliosis development which is cur-

rently poorly understood and guide development of successful treatment strategies [9,10].
Engineering
There are three prime areas in which a prominent engineering approach would be beneficial and valuable in
obtaining a better understanding of the aetiology of AIS:
Understanding 3-Dimensional (3D) curve structure and
performance
Postero-anterior and lateral radiographs have been used
routinely to observe overall curve morphology, especially
degree of curvature, as well as curve development between
clinic visits. Such images allow a basic 3D image to be created in a rather primitive fashion but it has proved particularly useful to the surgeon in deciding treatment.
However, it must be remembered that a radiograph is
compression of a 3D structure into 2D and has many
inherent problems for interpretation. Scoliosis is a 3D
deformity and, as such, should always be thought of in 3D
terms. In particular, the compression of a 3D structure
into 2D (as in radiographs) does not allow for the exclusion of the same spinal curve being thought of as changing in severity and classification between visits when only
simple rotation of the spine has occurred. The ability to
observe or image the spine in 3D has improved enormously in recent years and its availability has also
increased especially with refined development of MRI
technology. If a complete understanding of spinal curve
development is to be achieved, then research evaluations
have to move away from 2D imaging such as with basic
radiographs and observe only 3D images. 2D assessment
should be no longer acceptable for research purposes and
new techniques of 3D assessment need to be developed to
keep pace with the improvements in imaging techniques.
The following statement highlights this area:

'Measure in 2D, you think in 2D; measure in 3D, you think in
3D' – and scoliosis is a 3D problem.
Visits to the scoliosis clinic by patients provide the opportunity to see 'snapshots' along the continuum of spinal
curve development. However, spinal curve development
is a continuous process and not simply a series of images
separated by time. The development of techniques to produce a continuous image (movie?) of curve development
from the images collected from patients during visits to
the scoliosis clinic would be very valuable. Just as more
information would be available by observing curve morphology using 3D imaging, even more information would
be available if continuous imaging of curve development
was also introduced. There is an opportunity for such
techniques to be developed because technology has
caught up with the desires of researchers – it is simply a
matter of defining the techniques wanting to be created.

http://www.scoliosisjournal.com/content/3/1/5

Biomechanical involvement in curve development and
treatment
As a spinal curve develops and increases, it seems reasonable to imagine that the biomechanics associated with
column construction affect curve development and associated rotation and that their influence increases with
curve progression. It also seems reasonable to suggest that
while the abnormal spinal curve remains small, removal
of the underlying cause would allow the body possibly to
return the curve to normal. An understanding of the biomechanical principles involved with column structure
and curve development would be invaluable to understanding the aetiology of AIS but is currently unavailable.
Extending this concept, it also appears possible that a
point of abnormal curve development might be reached
during progression at which correction cannot be
achieved by the body even if the underlying cause was
removed. Such a point might be related to morphological
changes such as those seen with vertebral wedging but the
realization that curve development will continue to
progress even with the underlying, deforming force
removed would be valuable in the development of treatment strategies especially in the area of providing supportive treatments such as those associated with 'bracing' [11].
Development of computer models
Perhaps the ultimate research tool would be the development of computer models to simulate spine morphology
and normal growth which could include curve development. Such techniques have had outstanding success in
other areas of research and there are certainly seeds of
development of these techniques in scoliosis. Clearly, the
potential for unparalleled success in understanding the
mechanics of scoliosis using such techniques suggests
strongly that this area of research should receive much
more attention in the near future.
Four basic questions that should be the focus of attention in any
research
The lack of any really substantial knowledge relating to
the aetiology of AIS as seen in the literature emphasizes
the basic areas that should form the focus of all current
research because knowledge in these areas is most critical
and readily applicable:

The development of a marker to identify those children who
are going to develop AIS. This would allow treatment strategies to be developed to avoid even initial curve development.
The development of a marker which would indicate
whether a small, abnormal spinal curve will progress,
remain the same, or regress. This would allow aggressive
treatment strategies to be applied to those patients whose
small curves have been identified as going to progress.

Summary
In his recent successful book 'Where have all the leaders
gone?' Lee Iacocca, the former CEO of Chrysler, reports
coming into contact for the first time with medical
researchers (for diabetes) in his retirement years. He commented that medical research was much like government
– kind of a self-generating bureaucracy. Cynically, he
noted that people do research so that they can write
papers to get more funding to do more research to write
more papers. He was prompted to ask: 'Hey, isn't anyone
trying to find a cure?' The goal for research into the aetiology of AIS should be to find a cure (other than surgery) as
soon as possible, preferably tomorrow – but, unfortunately, a cure remains a dream and does not even seem to
be on the distant horizon. Researchers in this field, particularly basic science researchers, should ask themselves if
their work has produced results that have affected the
treatment of even a single patient with AIS and, if not,
then why not?
Finally, a plea for better communication: in today's electronic
and computerized environment with relatively easy access
to video cameras and the ability to both see and hear each
other so readily available, could a world-wide research
environment be created that involves all interested
researchers in all the different areas with regular intercourse and discussion?
