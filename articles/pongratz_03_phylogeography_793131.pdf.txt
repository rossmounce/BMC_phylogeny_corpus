Abstract
Background: Models of the maintenance of sex predict that one reproductive strategy, sexual or
parthenogenetic, should outcompete the other. Distribution patterns may reflect the outcome of
this competition as well as the effect of chance and historical events. We review the distribution
data of sexual and parthenogenetic biotypes of the planarian Schmidtea polychroa.
Results: S. polychroa lives in allopatry or sympatry across Europe except for Central and NorthWestern Europe, where sexual individuals have never been reported. A phylogenetic relationship
between 36 populations based on a 385 bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I
gene revealed that haplotypes were often similar over large geographic distances. In North Italian
lakes, however, diversity was extreme, with sequence differences of up to 5% within the same lake
in both sexuals and parthenogens. Mixed populations showed "endemic" parthenogenetic lineages
that presumably originated from coexisting sexuals, and distantly related ones that probably result
from colonization by parthenogens independent from sexuals.
Conclusions: Parthenogens originated repeatedly from sexuals, mainly in Italy, but the same may
apply to other Mediterranean regions (Spain, Greece). The degree of divergence between
populations suggests that S. polychroa survived the ice ages in separate ice-free areas in Central,
Eastern and Southern Europe and re-colonised Europe after the retreat of the major glaciers.
Combining these results with those based on nuclear markers, the data suggest that repeated
hybridisation between sexuals and parthenogenetic lineages in mixed populations maintains high
levels of genetic diversity in parthenogens. This can explain why parthenogens persist in populations
that were originally sexual. Exclusive parthenogenesis in central and western populations suggests
better colonisation capacity, possibly because of inbreeding costs as well as hybridisation of sexuals
with parthenogens.

Background
Theory predicts that stable coexistence of sexual and parthenogenetic conspecifics must be rare [1,2]. Mixed asso-

ciations are therefore seen as a transition towards the
extinction of one of the two forms [3]. A non-overlapping
spatial distribution pattern of sexuals and parthenogens is

frequently found and has been termed geographic parthenogenesis [4]. Typically, the (ancestral) sexual population
is located in the distribution centre of the species, while
parthenogens are present at the margin of the distribution
[5]. An ecological explanation for this pattern does not
exist [6]. Lynch [7] proposed that parthenogens might fail
to establish themselves in the presence of sexuals as backcrosses with the ancestral sexual forms may hamper the
independence of purely parthenogenetic forms. But parthenogens may have better colonizing capacities: They
have a higher intrinsic growth rate and do not pay the deleterious effects of population bottlenecks (e.g. inbreeding) that may act on sexual populations [7]. As a result,
they may colonize areas where sexuals have difficulties
establishing a population [6].
Non-adaptive explanations for geographic parthenogenesis take historical events into account, e.g. when colonisation was recent. In Europe, as elsewhere, the climate
changed dramatically during the past 20,000 years from
the last glacial height to the present interglacial period
[8,9]. As a result, previously glaciated areas have become
available for species that could not withstand the earlier
low temperatures [10]. Recolonization, however, also
requires migration routes that allow dispersal from 'refugia'. Hence, distributions will be affected by dispersal barriers such as mountain ranges like the Pyrenees, the Alps
and the Balkans [11,10]. Using mitochondrial DNA
sequences it has become possible to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships between populations of the same
species, thereby identifying the source populations of the
lineages that (re)colonized Central and Northern Europe
[12].
Intraspecific phylogenies may also reveal age and origin of
parthenogenetic lineages [13–15]. Since mtDNA is maternally inherited, it is also a suitable tool to identify the
maternal ancestors of hybrid parthenogens [16–20]. Both
allow identification of the rate at which new parthenogenetic lineages arise, and to what extent the presence of sexual conspecifics is required.
Schmidtea polychroa is a freshwater planarian with a
Europe-wide distribution. It is a simultaneous hermaphrodite with sexual and parthenogenetic biotypes and has
been used for various studies on the costs and benefits of
sex [21–24]. In much of Western and Central Europe sexuals are absent [25], whereas mixed populations of sexuals and parthenogens occur in Italy [25,26] and Sweden
[27]. It is not known whether coexistence is in equilibrium or whether invasion and displacement are still in
progress. Allozyme markers indicated a polyphyletic origin of parthenogens from sexuals [26]. Parthenogens were
more closely related to sympatric sexuals from the same
population than to parthenogens elsewhere.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/3/23

Here, we studied the phylogenetic relationships of sexual
and parthenogenetic S. polychroa collected at 38 sites in
Europe to explain their distribution. In a first step we
review all available distribution data from the literature.
Using an mtDNA marker, we then investigate (1) whether
parthenogens arose repeatedly or whether they are monophyletic, and (2) whether there are indications for recent
or ancient parthenogenetic strains. Special attention was
paid to mixed populations and to evidence for hybridisation between sexuals and parthenogens. We discuss what
these data imply for the recolonisation of Central and
Northern Europe by sexual and parthenogenetic S.
polychroa.
Schmidtea polychroa: Diploid sexuals and polyploid
parthenogens
Schmidtea (formerly Dugesia) polychroa consists of four
karyologic forms, or biotypes A to D [28]. B, C and D represent polyploid, parthenogenetic forms derived from the
diploid sexual biotype A (2x = 8). Benazzi [28] differentiated between synaptic (B) and asynaptic (C, D) oogenesis.
In the synaptic biotypes, production of triploid or tetraploid eggs is achieved by endoduplication of the polyploid chromosome set, followed by meiosis during which
the identical, duplicated sister chromatids pair. This
means that normal meiotic processes, including segregation and recombination, occur, but eggs still have the
same genetic information as their mother. The other biotypes produce triploid (C) and tetraploid (D) eggs mitotically. In all parthenogens (B–D) egg development
requires fusion with allosperm. The sperm nucleus, however, does not fuse with the egg nucleus, but degrades and
is expelled [29].

Schmidtea polychroa is a generalist and can be found in
meso- to eutrophic freshwater habitats like lowland rivers,
streams, ditches, and lakes. Sexuals and parthenogens are
widespread and live in sympatry in several localities in
Italy. Sexuals have never been reported from Central and
Western Europe, but are present in Sweden (see results). It
is therefore unlikely that differences in climatic preferences or variance in colonization ability alone can explain
the distribution pattern.

Results
Distribution of sexual and parthenogenetic Schmidtea
polychroa
Sampling coverage is good for much of Europe, except for
Eastern Europe and the Iberian Peninsula (Table 1). Large
numbers of collection sites in close proximity of a single
study area [e.g. locality 30] were pooled as a single locality. Due to a large number of data points in some areas,
not every single location was listed when no additional
biotype was found. This applies to the British Isles and
some Mediterranean islands.

The majority of studies reported either sexuals or parthenogens for a given locality (Fig. 1). Sexual populations are
abundant in Italy, including Sardinia and Elba. Reports
from sexual forms elsewhere are rare, but span a wide geographical range: Hungary (2 sites), Austria (Graz), Spain
(3 sites) and Sweden (3 sites). Sexual populations have
not been found North and West of the Alps, including
France, Germany, Switzerland, large parts of Austria, the
Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Great Britain and Ireland. In all those countries, only polyploid (mainly trip-

loid) populations have been reported. No data are
available for much of Eastern Europe, except for the more
general statement that Dugesia [=Schmidtea] polychroa
reaches its eastern distribution limit at the Volga [31,32].
Parthenogenetic S. polychroa are found all over Europe.
Biotype B appears to be most widely distributed, but one
needs to consider that most studies do not distinguish
between biotypes B, C and D. Mixed populations of sexuals and parthenogens were only reported from Pisa, Italy

(Monti Pisani: [25,30]), North Italian lakes (Lago Maggiore: [33]; Lago di Caldonazzo: [22]; Lago d'Iseo: this
study), and one locality in Spain [34].
Phylogenetic relationships among COI haplotype
sequences
From 176 individuals we identified 31 different sequences
(haplotypes hp01-31; Fig. 2 and 3). Within haplotypes,
letters were used to differentiate between individuals with
the same haplotype but different ploidy (2x, 3x or 4x) or
geographic origin. This resulted in 82 S. polychroa
sequences for phylogenetic analysis and allowed the comparison of single or multiple origins of parthenogens in
the analysis (see below). Note that hlE03 (S. lugubris, biotype E) and hlF01 (S. nova, biotype F) were used as
outgroups.

Within S. polychroa, polymorphisms were found at 59
positions, 28 of which were parsimony informative.
Forty-nine out of a total of 63 substitutions were synonymous. Many of the rare haplotypes differed by a single
substitution from a common haplotype (hp03, Fig. 2 and
3). Within S. polychroa, the largest genetic distance was 24
nucleotides, or 6.2% (Table 3). Between Schmidtea species, the differences ranged between 61 and 87 substitutions. S. polychroa sequences, sampling site and biotype
information are accessible in GenBank (AF287052 –
AF287133).
Both phylogenetic methods (Bayesian and maximumlikelihood ML) gave very similar results recovering most
monophyletic groups with posterior probability ≥90%
(Fig. 2). In both analyses parthenogens (3x and 4x) were
scattered on several branches indicating repeated origin
from sexuals. To test this possibility, three constraint analyses were performed using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test
(one-tailed). The first assumed a single origin for all parthenogens (both 3x and 4x). The next two assumed a single origin for either 3x or 4x parthenogens (Table 4). All
three are significantly worse than the Bayesian phylogeny
and therefore we reject the possibility of a single origin for
parthenogenesis. Figs. 2 and 3 show that a single haplotype (hp03) is widespread among Central European parthenogens. The four sexual S. polychroa with hp03 are
restricted to 4 lakes in Northern Italy (Fig. 2).
The network analysis shows hp03 as a central, presumably
ancestral haplotype in the TCS analysis. Some haplotypes
could not be joined without exceeding the maximum
number of mutational steps as specified by the parsimony
criterion. One of these was the very divergent hp31 from
the only Spanish sexual S. polychroa. Another four (hp06,
hp14, hp25 and hp26) clustered together in a small
separate network. All haplotypes within this cluster are
from Northern Italy (Fig. 3). Two other divergent groups

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/3/23

were represented by parthenogens from France (hp12,
hp13 and hp21) and sexuals from Central Italy (hp02,
hp18 and hp23). Three more highly divergent, single haplotypes (hp05, hp17 and hp19) were only found in
parthenogens.
From all sampled areas, Northern Italy shows most diversity. Although part of this must be attributed to the high
sampling effort in this area, it is also the region where two
widespread, but distinct clusters overlap. These two differ
by about 5% and consistently appeared on different
branches of the tree, irrespective of the method used.
Parthenogenesis: recent or ancient?
The degree to which parthenogenetic lineages diverge
from their closest sexual progenitors should correlate with
their ability to persist for a time long. Differences between
parthenogenetic strains in the degree of divergence would
then be a relative measure of the age of such lineages, and
allow to distinguish relatively "young" from relatively
"old" lineages. In all main clusters both sexuals and parthenogens were found (Fig. 2, 3). Some parthenogenetic
lineages had haplotypes identical or similar to sympatric
or geographically close sexuals, indicating recent (sexual)
ancestors (Table 2, Fig. 2). Other parthenogens, however,
showed large differences to nearby sexual haplotypes. The
largest observed difference was 13 nucleotide substitutions and was found between parthenogenetic S. polychroa
from Lac d'Annecy (France) and sexual individuals from
Northern Italy, which represents a divergence of approximately 3%. Hp19, present in parthenogens from Central
Italy, differs by six substitutions from sympatric sexuals
(hp18, hp23), a 1.8% divergence. Parthenogens in Lago di
Como (hp05) and Ammersee (hp17) show a similar pattern when compared to the nearest sexual populations.
Divergent lineages like these may represent ancient parthenogenetic lineages. However, it cannot be excluded
that some more closely related sexual haplotypes are
present in the field, but were not sampled.

Discussion
Geographic distribution
Although the distribution of sexual and parthenogenetic
S. polychroa suggests 'geographic parthenogenesis' [4], the
picture is complicated. On a large scale, the pattern is
clear: sexuals are absent from areas North of the Alps,
including France, Germany, parts of Austria, Belgium,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Great Britain. Yet, mixed populations occur in Italy, Spain and Sweden. Data for Eastern Europe are poor, but sexuals occur
in Hungary. Since sexuals have never been observed in
any other place North of the Alps, their occurrence in Sweden raises questions about long-distance dispersal aided
by waterfowl [35,36] or humans. Anthropogenic dispersal
is invoked for the success of the North-American Girardia

(Dugesia) tigrina in Europe. Planaria torva may have
invaded Great Britain by such a process [37]. Similarly,
human activity is the likely cause of the introduction of S.
polychroa to North America [38]. But there are also alternative explanations.
As Scandinavia was ice-covered during the last glaciation,
present-day populations in Southern Sweden must be
descendants of lineages that persisted in refugia. The Baltic Sea may have aided dispersal into Scandinavia, since its
salinity dropped to freshwater levels during certain peri-

ods ('Ancylus Sea') [39]. At present, several freshwater
planarians, including Schmidtea polychroa, can be found in
brackish regions along the Swedish East coast [27,40].
Colonization of Scandinavia after the last glaciation
through the Baltic has been shown for the European perch
using genetic data [41,42]. The fact that sexual S. polychroa
are absent from Denmark and Germany suggests that
Sweden was colonized by Eastern populations. Extensive
karyological and genetic data from Eastern Europe and
Scandinavia are needed to confirm this possibility.

Our (limited) genetic data for parthenogens from Denmark suggests that they are descendants of Central European populations. It suggests that the Kattegat Strait
between Denmark and Sweden is a dispersal barrier for S.
polychroa. Support for this possibility comes from another
planarian, Polycelis nigra, which occurs throughout Europe
up to Northern Germany and Denmark, but is missing
from Sweden [43]. Yet, P. nigra is one of the commonest
European planarians and often lives under conditions
similar to those prevalent in southern Sweden [35].
Phylogeography of European species, and geographic
distribution of haplotypes
Hewitt [44] analysed the effects of recurrent ice ages and
concluded that species ranges have contracted and
expanded repeatedly. The consequences are loss of variation, divergence among populations due to isolation,
genome reorganization and hybridisation of slightly
divergent genomes [44,45]. In principle, geographic and
genetic variability allow identification of recolonisation
routes and hybrid zones after the last ice ages [10,11].
However, in our data the intraspecific divergence among
mtDNA lineages is so extreme, that it appears as if major
lineages split long before the quarternary ice ages. This

means that the latter did not cause, but possibly maintained or reinforced existing divergence [11].
During the ice ages not all species went extinct in Central
Europe. Cold-adapted species survived in the ice-free corridor between the Scandinavian and the Alpine ice sheets.
Some planarians, including S. polychroa, may well have
belonged to this community [46]. Planarians, including S.
polychroa, also survived the last ice age in Britain's ice-free
Southwest [35]. This implies that recolonization of
previously glaciated habitats may well have started from
persisting nearby populations rather than from remote
refugia. Although low temperatures in ice-covered lakes
does not seem to affect adult survival, S. polychroa requires
temperatures to rise above 7.5°C for cocoon production
[35]. This coincides with Central European summer temperatures during glaciations, which were around 9°C
[47].
With few exceptions, clusters of related haplotypes belong
to certain geographical regions (Fig. 2). Spanish samples
differed clearly from all others. Similarly, no haplotypes
were shared between Central Italy and any other region.
Two very different clusters were exclusively found in

Page 11 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2003, 3

Northern Italy, coexisting with even more types. North of
the Alps, however, haplotype variation is low. This does
not necessarily indicate recolonization from a single
source population after the last glaciation. The COI gene
may be too conserved to allow resolution of divergence
caused by the most recent glaciation. In contrast to other
phylogenetic studies, the Alps do not seem to represent an
absolute genetic barrier for some haplotypes. Hp03, dominant in Central Europe parthenogens, also occurs in
Northern Italy. However, the Alps do seem to represent a
dispersal barrier for sexual, diploid S. polychroa, which are
absent from countries on their western and northern edge
(France to Austria).
Origin and divergence time of parthenogenetic lineages
Our results support the multiple, repeated origin of parthenogenetic lineages [26] from sexuals. A single origin is
rejected by the constraint analyses (Table 4).

Inferring the age of a parthenogenetic lineage from genetic
data is based on nucleotide divergence with its closest sexual relative (the hypothetical ancestor). If the true ancestor has gone extinct or has not been sampled, this
procedure overestimates the age of the lineage. It also
requires a reliable molecular clock for the focal sequence.
Nevertheless, if the sampling pattern is dense enough, at
least a qualitative identification of "ancient" parthenogens should be possible. Estimates for the mutation rate
of the mitochondrial COI gene of arthropods are in the
range of about 2% per million years [48–50]. Although
mutation rates differ between taxa, we apply this rate to S.
polychroa for a preliminary estimate. It suggests that most
parthenogens are not older than 500,000 years. The parthenogenetic lineages from France (hp13, hp12 and
hp21), however, differ by about 1.5 to 3% from their
closest sexuals. This suggests divergence times of 750,000
to 1.5 million years. If this is true, parthenogens from the
same or adjacent areas should form a monophyletic clade
of exclusively and rather ancient parthenogenetic lineages. Better phylogeographic coverage for Southern France
and Switzerland is required to prove this.
Finally, tetraploid parthenogens of localities 14 and 15
(Fig 1) differ strikingly from coexisting sexuals (Fig 2 and
3). Further sampling from more populations from adjacent areas is required to confirm their relationship. As the
Italian distribution of sexuals and parthenogens is a true
mosaic, these tetraploids may be descendants from extant
but as yet unsampled diploid populations.
Hybridisation between sexuals and parthenogens in mixed
populations
Mixed populations encourage ecological and genetic
interactions between sexuals and parthenogens, allowing
the study of the evolutionary advantage of sex and the ori-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/3/23

gin of parthenogenesis. Hermaphroditic parthenogens
that have a functional male gender may spread genes for
parthenogenesis in the sexual gene pool, thus diluting and
ultimately displacing sexuality. Jaenike & Selander [51]
explored the ecological conditions under which such
processes work and applied them to explain the distribution of parthenogenetic oligochaetes in North America.
Being a hermaphrodite, S. polychroa always has both sex
functions in the same individual, also in parthenogens.
Unusual is that parthenogens are sperm-dependent and
produce haploid sperm, an unusual trait for a polyploid
[53]. They require sperm from a partner (sexual or parthenogenetic) to activate parthenogenetic development of
their eggs [52]. However, neither sexuals nor parthenogens are able to self-fertilize. Hybridisation between sexuals and parthenogens has been studied extensively in the
population of Lago di Caldonazzo (Trento, N-Italy). The
frequency distribution of sexuals and parthenogens varied
strongly between sites but was not explained by ecological
parameters [22]. Genetic and karyological data indicate
that new triploid, parthenogenetic lineages arise regularly
as a result of hybridisation between sexuals and parthenogens [21,26,54]. Higher heterozygosity and diversity
among parthenogens may be attributed to triploidy and
fixed heterozygosity. However, it is also evidence for secondary contact of sexuals and parthenogens. If parthenogens had exclusively originated from local sexuals, their
genetic variability should be within that of sexuals, which
is not the case. Our results show that although some haplotypes are shared (Hp01, Hp07), others are exclusive to
parthenogens (Hp06, Hp14). This pattern is supported by
a detailed study with large samples from several sites
within Caldonazzo [54]. Interestingly, parthenogenetic
lineages differ not only with regard to their mitochondrial
COI sequence, but also with regard to sex allocation and
female fecundity. This indicates that they may represent
different stages of adaptation to clonal reproduction [54].

Conclusions
Sexual S. polychroa are absent from Central and Western
Europe, where populations are exclusively parthenogenetic. The pattern South of the Alps reveals a complicated
overlapping mosaic between parthenogens and sexuals.
Coexistence also exists in Spain and Southern Sweden.
Clustering of COI haplotypes identified groups of geographically close lineages. In northern Italy, two haplotype clusters are present that differ by about 5%, but
overlap geographically. Both types were found among sexuals as well as parthenogens. The data suggest that
postglacial colonisation in Europe was not from a single
refugium, but from several sources that already had
diverged to some extent. It is likely that Scandinavia was
colonised from the East, whereas Central and Western
Europe were colonised from the South or Centre. The data

further indicate that parthenogenetic lineages are present
on several branches in a phylogeographic tree, indicating
repeated origin. The latter may be enhanced by hybridisation between sexuals and parthenogens, as shown in
studies using microsatellites [54]. This can explain the
coexistence of identical sexual and parthenogenetic haplotypes. Yet other parthenogenetic haplotypes differed
clearly from coexisting sexuals, indicating dispersal and
secondary contacts. Coexistence of sexual and parthenogenetic forms must therefore be seen as a dynamic process
of genetic exchange, arisal (and extinction) of new lineages, and dispersal. Exclusive parthenogenesis in Central
and Western populations suggests better colonisation
capacity of parthenogens. It is unclear why this is, but
since sexuals are obligate outcrossers, they may suffer
from inbreeding costs in small founder populations,
slowing down their colonisation rate relative to parthenogens. Sexuals may also be poor competitors when invading already established parthenogenetic populations.
Sexuals cannot obtain paternity in parthenogenetic partners, and even "help" to generate new parthenogenetic
lineages through hybridisation.

Methods
Review of distribution data
Distribution records were extracted from publications and
personal communications. All studies with karyological
data and a description of sample origins were considered,
but with an emphasis on continental Europe. Because
field samples were collected differently in different studies, only presence or absence of a certain ploidy level was
scored, not abundance. Differentiation of biotypes B, C
and D requires cytological analysis of the final stages of
oogenesis in fresh cocoons. Most studies, however, were
limited to simple chromosome counts and only allow
identification of (diploid) sexual and (polyploid) parthenogenetic lineages (Table 1).
Own data
Additional data were obtained from field trips to 38 localities in Europe between 1996 and 1999. Collection, transportation, and preparation of metaphase chromosome
spreads are described in Pongratz [26]. For two samples
(Sarca and Palancia), ploidy was not determined by karyotyping but inferred from allele numbers at up to four,
highly polymorphic microsatellite loci (data not
shown)[55].
mtDNA sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted following the protocol in
Pongratz [55]. In total, we analysed 176 individual S. polychroa from 36 different localities (Table 2). 81 samples
were from diploids, 75 from triploids, and 20 from tetraploids. For use as an outgroup in phylogenetic analyses,
several specimens of Schmidtea biotype E and F [28,56]

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/3/23

were sequenced. These were collected in populations 37
and 38 (Table 2).
Sequencing of COI
We amplified a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome-oxidase I (COI) gene using primers pr-a2 (5'AGCTGCAGTTTTGGTTTTTTGGACATCCTGAGGT-3')
and pr-b2 (5'-ATGAGCAACAACATAATAAGTATCATG-3')
[57]. Although these primers were developed for Dugesia
japonica, they amplify the same region in S. polychroa. For
details see Pongratz [58]. PCR products were purified
using Geneclean® Kit (Bio 101), yielding 15 µl solution of
clean template in appropriate concentration for sequencing reactions with the ABI PRISM™ Dye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Kit (PE Applied Biosystems). Fragments were
analysed on an ABIPRISM310. All samples were
sequenced in both directions.
Phylogenetic analyses
All sequences were identical in length (385 bp) and were
aligned manually. Polymorphisms were analysed with
DNASP3.0 [59] and DAMBE3.7 [60]. The latter was also
used for translation into amino acid sequences using the
flatworm mitochondrial code in order to differentiate
between
synonymous
and
non-synonymous
substitutions.

A total of 82 S. polychroa sequences, plus one sequence
from each of the two outgroup taxa, S. lugubris (biotype E;
GenBank accession No. AF290021) and S. nova (biotype
F; AF290023) were used in the phylogenetic analyses.
Phylogenetic relationships were estimated using Bayesian
analysis and maximum-likelihood (ML). Modeltest v. 306
[61] was used to select the most appropriate model of
sequence evolution under the Akaike Information Criterion. This was the General Time Reversible model (GTR)
taking into account the shape of the gamma distribution
(G). ML analyses were performed in PAUP*4.0b10 [62].
These consisted of heuristic searches involving tree bisection and reconnection (TBR) branch swapping. Bayesian
phylogenetic analyses [63,64] were performed with
MRBAYES v. 2.01 [65] using the GTR+G model with
parameters estimated as part of the analysis and four
incrementally heated Markov chains with the default
heating values. The analysis ran for 1. 5 × 106 generations,
with sampling at intervals of 100 generations that produced 15000 sampled trees. After the run, the log-likelihood values of sample points were plotted against the
generation time and all trees prior to reaching stationarity
were discarded. A 50% majority rule consensus tree was
generated combining only the last 5000 sampled trees.
The frequency of any particular clade of the consensus tree
represent the posterior probability of that clade [65]; only
values above 95% were considered to indicate that nodes
were significantly supported. Intra-specific mtDNA haplo-

type networks were reconstructed using the program TCS
v1.13 [66]. Where appropriate, topological constraints
were generated using MacClade v.4.0 [67] and compared
to our optimal topology using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa
(SH) test implemented in PAUP*4.0b10.
