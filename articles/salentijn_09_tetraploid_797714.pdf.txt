Abstract
Background: Α-gliadins form a multigene protein family encoded by multiple α-gliadin (Gli-2)
genes at three genomic loci, Gli-A2, Gli-B2 and Gli-D2, respectively located on the homoeologous
wheat chromosomes 6AS, 6BS, and 6DS. These proteins contain a number of important celiac
disease (CD)-immunogenic domains. The α-gliadins expressed from the Gli-B2 locus harbour fewer
conserved CD-epitopes than those from Gli-A2, whereas the Gli-D2 gliadins have the highest CDimmunogenic potential. In order to detect differences in the highly CD-immunogenic α-gliadin
fraction we determined the relative expression level from the homoeologous Gli-2 loci in various
tetraploid and hexaploid wheat genotypes by using a quantitative pyrosequencing method and by
analyzing expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences.
Results: We detected large differences in relative expression levels of α-gliadin genes from the
three homoeologous loci among wheat genotypes, both as relative numbers of expressed sequence
tag (EST) sequences from specific varieties and when using a quantitative pyrosequencing assay
specific for Gli-A2 genes. The relative Gli-A2 expression level in a tetraploid durum wheat cultivar
('Probstdorfer Pandur') was 41%. In genotypes derived from landraces, the Gli-A2 frequency varied
between 12% and 58%. In some advanced hexaploid bread wheat cultivars the genes from locus GliB2 were hardly expressed (e.g., less than 5% in 'Lavett') but in others they made up more than 40%
(e.g., in 'Baldus').
Conclusion: Here, we have shown that large differences exist in relative expression levels of αgliadins from the homoeologous Gli-2 loci among wheat genotypes. Since the homoelogous genes
differ in the amount of conserved CD-epitopes, screening for differential expression from the
homoeologous Gli-2 loci can be employed for the pre-selection of wheat varieties in the search for
varieties with very low CD-immunogenic potential. Pyrosequencing is a method that can be
employed for such a 'gene family-specific quantitative transcriptome profiling'.

Background
Wheat (Triticum spp.) is one of world's major food crops.
Products derived from wheat flour are consumed by
humans in many forms such as bread, pasta and other
baked foods, and wheat gluten are used as additives in
sauces, soups and sweets. T. aestivum (2n = 6x = 42;
AABBDD genome) is an allohexaploid that was formed
through hybridization and successive chromosome doubling of three diploid Triticum/Aegilops species. The diploid ancestors of the D genome and the A genome of T.
aestivum are respectively A. squarrosa (DD) and T. urartu
(AA). A. speltoides (SS) species have been suggested as the
ancestor of the B genome, but the exact diploid progenitor
remains uncertain [1,2]. While T. aestivum varieties are
used for bread making, tetraploid T. turgidum var. durum
(AABB genome) varieties are especially suitable for pasta
production. The composition of the gluten fraction of the
wheat grain is essential for the industrial quality. The gliadins (α, β, γ and ω gliadins) and glutenins (HMW and
LMW glutenins) are typical gluten components of Triticeae
cereals and these protein types determine respectively the
viscosity and elasticity (strength) of the dough [3,4].
Gluten proteins are also the cause of celiac disease (CD),
a T-cell-mediated disease with prevalence between 0.5–2
percent in human populations [5]. The disease is characterized by a chronic intestinal inflammation upon ingestion of gluten peptides [6-8]. Gluten peptides derived
from α-gliadins are especially immunodominant, inducing strong T-cell responses in the large majority of CDpatients, as compared to peptides derived from other gluten proteins such as γ-gliadins and glutenins [9]. Furthermore, α-gliadins harbour the p31-43/49 peptide that is
assumed to trigger the innate response pathway [10,11].
The α-gliadins are encoded by the Gli-2 locus located on
the short arms of three homoeologous wheat chromosomes in hexaploid wheat (6AS, 6BS and 6DS). The individual loci are designated as Gli-A2, Gli-B2 and Gli-D2
[12]. Each Gli-2 locus is complex as it contains clusters of
α-gliadin gene copies, with different levels of gene dispersion [13]. Estimates for α-gliadin gene copy number range
from 25–35 to perhaps even 150 copies per haploid
genome [14-16]. Most of the copies contain in-frame stop
codons [17], but as these are not frequently observed in
expressed α-gliadin sequences, they probably are pseudogenes that are not expressed [18].
Variation in immunogenicity exists among cultivars
[19,20] and work is in progress to identify wheat varieties
with a reduced amount of CD-epitopes to be used in a
breeding program. However, the development of molecular markers specific for presence or absence of CDepitopes in these cultivars is hampered by the complexity
of the loci that harbour gluten genes. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of genomic α-gliadin clones from hexaploid Triticum species and diploids representing the three

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/48

different genomes showed that they could be distinguished according to their genome of origin (A, B or D)
based on sequence homology as well as on a different
average length of the polyglutamine repeat motifs [17].
These differences between genomic origins were also
observed among genomic and EST sequences of α-gliadins from hexaploid bread wheat [17,21]. It was also
observed that the frequency of the HLA-DQ8+ restricted
T-cell epitope Glia-α and the HLA-DQ2+ restricted T-cell
epitopes Glia-α2, Glia-α9, and Glia-α20 differed between
α-gliadins from the three homoeologous genomes
[17,20].
Analysis of α-gliadin transcripts (ESTs) showed that αgliadins were preferentially expressed from the Gli-D2
locus whereas expression levels of α-gliadin genes from
Gli-B2 were relatively low. Two peaks of expression were
visible during seed maturaton: early (at 10 days post
anthesis) and late (at 20 days post anthesis). Several αgliadin genes from the Gli-A2 locus were expressed preferentially late in seed development [21].
In the present studies the composition of the Gli-2 transcriptome of wheat genotypes was analyzed in detail,
showing the differential expression of Gli-A2, Gli-B2 and
Gli-D2 α-gliadins among wheat cultivars. Genetic differences in the 5' part of the α-gliadin gene that are related to
differences in CD-immunogenicity, were analyzed in
detail. With the aim to develop a T-cell independent
method to detect differences in the highly CD-immunogenic Gli-2 fraction of individual genotypes of wheat varieties, pyrosequencing was applied to quantify the
frequency of Gli-A2 genes in the overall Gli-2 transcriptome. This assay will enable the pre-selection of wheat
genotypes that are expected to differ in the amount of αgliadin CD-epitopes in their gluten.

Results
Genetic composition of the Gli-2 transcriptome of selected
wheat lines
The 5' part of the α-gliadin (Gli-2) gene is harbouring
sequences coding for important HLA-DQ2+ CD-epitopes
(Figure 1). With the aim to perform an initial assessment
of genetic variation in transcribed Gli-2 genes and accompanying differences in the CD epitope frequency, Gli-2
transcripts from an individual plant of two hexaploid (T.
aestivum) cultivars, 'Lavett' and 'Baldus', were analyzed in
detail for their genomic origin (Gli-A2, Gli-B2 or Gli-D2)
and for the presence of sequences encoding the CDepitopes in the 5' part of the gene. The two cultivars are
commercially grown in Europe [22]. 'Baldus' has its origin
in The Netherlands, while 'Lavett' is from Sweden. They
contain different HMW glutenin (Glu-1) subunits, which
results in different scores for baking quality of 6 and 9,
respectively [22]. In the assessment of the variation in Gli2 transcripts we also included single genotypes of two lanPage 2 of 14

draces, 'Tripshiro' (CGN12287) and 'Sinde' (CGN12041)
from the collection of the Centre of Genetic Resources,
The Netherlands. 'Tripshiro' was collected as a tetraploid
durum wheat in Libya and carries the HMW glutenin subunits Glu-A1c and Glu-B1b [23] whereas 'Sinde' originates
from Ethiopia and was initially identified as hexaploid
bread wheat (Table 1). Landraces are known to be more
diverse and were included as a source for α-gliadin
sequence variation and as a source of variation in expression among homoeologous loci. As landraces are often a
mixture of genotypes, which are maintained by the
genebank as such in order not to loose variation, we used
seeds obtained from individual plants of these accessions.
Α-gliadin sequences amplified from cDNA of the four different wheat lines were cloned and sequenced and subsequently assigned to one of the homoeologous Gli-2 loci
(Gli-A2, Gli-B2 or Gli-D2) based on sequence homology
as was done for genomic clones in Van Herpen et al. and
Ma et al. [17,24]. Differential homoeoallelic expression
patterns were observed for both the cultivars and the genotypes derived from the landraces. In the two hexaploid
cultivars the Gli-A2 frequency was similar (33% for

'Lavett' and 28% for 'Baldus') whereas a large difference
was observed in the expression rate of Gli-D2 and Gli-B2
genes; the ratio of expression Gli-D2 to Gli-B2 was 12.4
(62% Gli-D2 to 5% Gli-B2) for 'Lavett' but only 0.64 (28%
Gli-D2 to 44% Gli-B2) for 'Baldus' (Figure 2). In the landraces we determined 71% Gli-A2 transcripts in the total
Gli-2 transcriptome of 'Tripshiro' and 85% in 'Sinde' (Figure 2). In both cases this was the result of a low level of
Gli-B2 sequences. Although 'Sinde' was listed as hexaploid
T. aestivum (Table 1), the individual genotype analyzed
here probably was tetraploid because there were no GliD2 sequences expressed.
By studying the deduced amino acid sequences the
number of different isoforms and the frequency Gli-2
transcripts encoding conserved CD-epitopes were determined. In the 5' region (135 to 216 base pairs in size) of
the Gli-2 transcripts analyzed here a total of 37 different αgliadin isoforms were evident (Figure 3 and 4). The transcripts derived from the hexaploid genotypes derived
from the cultivars 'Lavett' (Figure 3A) and 'Baldus' (Figure
3B) and the tetraploid genotypes derived from the landraces 'Tripshiro' (Figure 4A) and 'Sinde' (Figure 4B)

Underlined Q is deamidated in the intestine by tTG.
encoded 12, 17, 8 and 8 different isoforms, respectively.
These numbers are reflecting the minimal variation in αgliadin isoforms expected to be present in the gluten fraction of the genotypes analyzed. Several isoforms were rare
and only encoded by a single transcript, but some were
highly expressed, which reflects their relative frequency in
the gluten transcriptome. For instance, almost 25% of the
α-gliadin transcripts (15 out of 61 ESTs) from 'Baldus'
were encoding one isoform (no. A1, Figure 3B).
The Gli-2 fraction derived from the Gli-B2 locus had a
reduced CD-immunogenic potential as compared to GliA2 and Gli-D2 α-gliadins (consistent with results of Molberg et al. and Van Herpen et al. [20,17]). Also, the Gli-A2
transcripts we obtained lack the sequence encoding the
Glia-α2 epitope. In the hexaploid lines (expressing Gli-D2
genes) the average number of conserved HLA-DQ2+ CDepitopes (Glia-α2 from Gli-D2 sequences; Glia-α9 and
Glia-α20 from Gli-A2 and Gli-D2 sequences) per gliadin
transcript was 2.7 for 'Lavett' and 1.6 for 'Baldus'. In the
case of tetraploid lines, which express only Gli-B2 and GliA2 α-gliadins, the accessions with a low Gli-A2 expression
frequency and thus the lowest number of conserved HLADQ2+ CD-epitopes in the α-gliadin transcriptome (in this
example 'Tripshiro' with an average number of CDepitopes per α-gliadin transcript of 1.3) are more interesting to test for low CD toxicity.
A pyrosequencing assay to assess relative Gli-A2
expression frequencies
The screening of wheat accessions for differential expression of Gli-2 genes from different homoeologous loci, varying in their CD-immunogenic potential, is a step towards

the development of a wheat line with reduced CD-immunogenicity. As EST sequencing is too laborious for routine
application in a breeding program, we developed a pyrosequening method to detect relative differences in the
composition of the Gli-2 transcriptome among samples.
This pyrosequencing method was developed based on
DNA polymorphisms specific for Gli-A2 α-gliadins. Due
to the large repetitive domains in each sequence and the
large number of sequence variants only a few polymorphic sites in the gene were diagnostic for Gli-A2. We used
the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (T/C and
GG/AG or AA) as indicated in Figure 5. The T (pyrogram
position 2) and G (pyrogram position 20) nucleotides
were found in all gliadin sequences derived from locus
Gli-A2, whereas C (pyrogram position 3) and A (pyrogram
position 21) nucleotides are present in all α-gliadin
sequences derived from Gli-B2 or Gli-D2 loci. These two
SNP positions are located in the 3' region of the gene, in
the DNA sequence that codes for the Glia-α epitope. This
epitope is toxic to patients that are HLA-DQ8+ and is conserved in Gli-D2 and Gli-B2 α-gliadin variants. In Gli-D2
isoforms it is physically linked to the more N-terminal
HLA-DQ2+ restricted T-cell epitopes Glia-α9, Glia-α20,
and Glia-α2 (Figure 1).
The specificity of the pyrosequencing assay for Gli-A2
sequences was verified in genomic DNA of the 'Chinese
Spring' homozygous deletion line 6AS-1, which lacks two
thirds of chromosome arm 6AS, including the Gli-A2
locus. This was clearly visible in the pyrograms of this
deletion line in the form of the absence of the T- and Gnucleotide peaks, whereas the C- and A-nucleotide peaks,
representing genes of both the Gli-B2 and Gli-D2 locus

were always clearly detected (not shown). Both SNP positions (pyrogram position 2/3 and 20/21) returned similar
Gli-A2 frequencies (F test, p = 0.067). When comparing
the average Gli-A2 frequency of the two SNP positions in
genomic DNA of two wild type wheat 'Chinese Spring'
lines and deletion line 6AS-1 the pyrosequencing assay
detected large differences in Gli-A2 frequency. Based on
the replicate measurements in the genomic DNA of the
'Chinese Spring' lines, differences as small as 3.3% are
detectable with this pyrosequencing assay (LSD = 3.3% ±
0.0 at F test, p < 0.001; general ANOVA in Genstat) (Table
2).
The Gli-A2 expression frequency during grain development
To study α-gliadin expression from the Gli-A2 locus during grain development, grains from two bread wheat cultivars ('Baldus' and 'Lavett') and one tetraploid durum
wheat cultivar ('Probstdorfer Pandur') were sampled at 7,
14 and 21 days after anthesis (DPA). Van Herpen et al.
[25] showed that the α-gliadin promotor is active during

endosperm development, but did not quantify α-gliadin
expression levels during development. In cDNA samples
of the three developmental stages analyzed we observed
that the Gli-2 transcripts were clearly detectable as RT-PCR
products in approximately similar amounts (results not
shown). As measured by pyrosequencing, the Gli-A2 transcript frequency in the α-gliadin transcriptome of the
durum wheat cultivar 'Probstdorfer Pandur' was 41% on
both harvest dates. In the hexaploid cultivars 'Baldus' and
'Lavett', which in addition also transcribe Gli-D2 genes,
we measured a lower Gli-A2 transcript frequency, ranging
from 10% to 21%. The transcript frequency of Gli-A2 gliadins showed no obvious differences during grain development from 7 DPA to 21 DPA (Table 3). As these are
samples from a few plants from only one cultivation year,
we do not know whether these frequencies are consistently present. Considering the cDNA samples of all wheat
accessions and all harvest dates together, no significant
effect of the harvest date on the Gli-A2 frequency was
found (ANOVA, F test, p = 0.732), whereas the ploidy

p31-49 (PGQQQPFPPQQPYPQPQPF, in blue), triggering the innate immune response; and the HLA-DQ2+ restricted T-cell
epitopes Glia-α9(αI) (PFPQPQLPY, in red); Glia-α9(αIII) (PYPQPQLPY); Glia-α2(αII) (PQPQLPYPQ) and Glia-α20

'Baldus' is respectively 2.7 and 1.6. The consensus nucleotide sequences of the EST contigs were assigned to a predicted
genomic location by clustering (Clustal W) with genomic sequences from diploid species with genome AA (T. monococcum), BB

level does have a significant effect (ANOVA, F test, p <
0.001). Based on the replicate measurements in two
'Baldus' genotypes (Table 3), differences as small as 5.9%
are detectable in cDNA samples with this pyrosequencing
assay (LSD = 5.90% ± 0.02 at F test, p < 0.001; general
ANOVA in Genstat).
The Gli-A2 expression frequency in different wheat
accessions
To pre-select wheat accessions that may differ in the composition of the α-gliadin fraction and in CD-immunogenic potential, individual plants derived from sixteen
different wheat accessions were assessed by pyrosequencing for the Gli-A2 transcript expression frequency in developing wheat kernels. To include more genetic variation
the accessions used originated from different geographical
locations. Furthermore, three different population types

were included: advanced cultivars, selections used for
breeding, and landraces. Advanced cultivars ('Baldus',
'Tripshiro' and 'Probstdorfer Pandur') and selections used
for breeding (CGN10569 and 'Dakar 52') are genetically
more homogeneous compared to landraces, which are
often mixtures of distinct genotypes that may even differ
in ploidy level (personal communication Dr. Noortje Bas
and Van den Broeck et al., in prep). Information on population type and origin is listed in Table 1. The advanced
tetraploid cultivar was included to assess the variation in
Gli-A2 expression in a situation without Gli-D2 homoeologs. In this situation, highly CD-immunogenic
sequences originating from Gli-D2 are absent [20] and
because Gli-B2 copies harbour less CD-epitopes [17] the
CD-immunogenicity mainly comes from expression of
Gli-A2 isoforms.

This N-terminal locus contains several CD-epitopes: p31-49 (PGQQQPFPPQQPYPQPQPF, in blue), triggering the innate immune response; and the

(PQPQLPYPQ) and Glia-α20 (FRPQQPYPQ, in green). The HLA-DQ2+ epitope frequency calculated as the number of conserved α9(αI), α9(αIII), α2(αII) and α20 T-cell epitopes per number of cDNA sequences (ESTs) for 'Tripshiro' and 'Sinde' is
respectively 1.3 and 1.6. The consensus nucleotide sequences of the EST contigs were assigned to a predicted genomic location
by clustering (Clustal W) with genomic sequences from diploid species with genome AA (T. monococcum), BB(SS) (Aegilops

GH160393-GH160413, 'Sinde' GH160366-GH160392.
The Gli-A2 transcript frequencies that were obtained by
pyrosequencing are shown in Figure 6 for two individual
plants per accession. The relative Gli-A2 expression frequencies for individual genotypes ranged from 12% for a
plant from CGN08403 to as much as 58% for a genotype
of the landrace 'Sinde' (CGN12041). In the advanced hexaploid cultivars 'Baldus' and 'Lavett' the highest Gli-A2
expression frequency observed was 13% for 'Lavett' and
19% for 'Baldus' (Figure 6, white bars). In the tetraploid
plants, in which there is no Gli-D2, the Gli-A2 expression
frequency reached relative higher levels. For instance, the
relative Gli-A2 expression frequency of the durum wheat
cultivar 'Probstdorfer Pandur' was 41% (Figure 6, yellow
bar).
To investigate the possibility for Gli-A2 expression frequency analysis in genetically more heterogeneous material several landraces were included (Figure 6, blue bars).
Here the Gli-A2 expression frequency of individual genotypes ranged from 12% to 58% and in most cases significant variation was observed within accessions. Most
individual genotypes displayed Gli-A2 expression frequencies which were intermediate between the hexaploid
(white bars; Figure 6) and tetraploid (yellow bars, Figure
6) situation. Depending on their actual ploidy level these

genotypes are interesting candidates for further analysis
towards the selection of low CD-immunogenic genotypes.
In case of a hexaploid genome, a significantly higher GliA2 expression is desired (as it implies a lower expression
of the highly CD-immunogenic Gli-D2 gliadins [20,17]).
On the contrary, tetraploid genotypes require a low Gli-A2
expression to reduce the already lower CD-immunogenicity of their gluten (as Gli-A2 gliadins contain more CD
epitopes than the very low CD-immunogenic Gli-B2
sequences [17]).

Discussion
The most immunogenic fraction of gluten with respect to
celiac disease (CD) is the fraction of α-gliadin proteins.
Differences in T-cell stimulation were observed among
gluten (gliadin) extracts of different wheat varieties [19].
However, the analysis of CD-immunogenicity of individual wheat varieties by in vitro T-cell clones remains time
consuming and is sensitive to the quality and specificity of
individual T-cell clones. In addition, T-cell tests are qualitative rather than quantitative. To test large numbers of
wheat lines for differences in CD-immunogenicity, T-cell
independent methods are highly desired. Naturally occurring single amino acid changes in the sequences of CDepitopes may cause a significant reduction in the level of

Frequency of Gli-A2 expression in the hexaploid T. aestivum cultivars 'Baldus' and 'Lavett' (AABBDD genome) and the tetraploid T. turgidum cultivar
'Probstdorfer Pandur' (AABB genome) as determined with pyrosequencing in cDNA fractions obtained from different stages of grain development
(7, 14, and 21 days post anthesis (DPA)). The frequencies were calculated as the average of 1–4 different cDNA samples (n) at two different SNP
positions, T2/(T2+C3) and G20/(G20+A21); ± = standard deviation for measurements, including both SNP positions.

in vitro T-cell stimulation [26]; [Mittea et al. in preparation, Salentijn et al. in preparation], which is on its turn a
reflection of clinical relevance. Furthermore, it has been
shown that T-cells recognizing imperfect CD-epitopes are
less frequently present in peripheral blood of CD patients
[27,28]. As the variant CD-epitopesexpressed from the
Gli-B2 locus lack perfect HLA-DQ2+ T-cell epitopes [17],
a relatively high level of α-gliadin expression from this
locus is most desired from the perspective of generating
wheat varieties with a reduced CD-immunogenic capacity.
A tetraploid variety with only Gli-B2 expression would

contain hardly any α-gliadin CD-epitopes. In hexaploid
varieties, in addition to a high expression from the Gli-B2
locus, a higher Gli-A2 (low Gli-D2) frequency is relatively
better, as this reduces the level of the most immunogenic
Gli-D2 isoforms.
Each of the homoeologous genomic loci, Gli-A2, Gli-B2
and Gli-D2, controls the synthesis of a group (block) of
gliadin proteins that are jointly inherited as a Mendelian
unit (alleles). These allelic blocks differ in the number, the
intensity, and the electrophoretic mobility of gliadin

wheat (T. turgidum var. durum) cultivar (in yellow), an accession used for breeding research (CGN10567) and more genetically
diverse landraces (in purple). For each accession, the Gli-A2 frequency in the cDNA fractions of two individual plants was measured with pyrosequencing on two SNP positions C2/C2+T3 and G20/G20+A21. Bars indicate the standard deviation for the
technical replications. The advanced cultivars are either registered as tetraploid (4×) or hexaploids (6×). Landraces (blue bars)
may be mixtures of both ploidy levels and therefore the ploidy level of the individuals derived from a landrace accession is
uncertain. More information about the accessions is given in Table 1.

bands [29]. Only a few gliadin-coding genes were
reported as remote from the gene clusters and able to
recombine with them (referred to as 'selfish', 'removed'
genes or 'additional' gliadin loci) [e.g. [30]]. The allelic
blocks were used to describe genetic diversity in T. aestivum and T. turgidum wheat varieties originating from specific geographic regions and a wide variation was found in
the one- and two-dimensional electrophoretic patterns of
gliadins from both bread and durum wheat genotypes,
including inter-varietal polymorphism, the occurrence of
biotypes within cultivars, alleles specific for a region, and
intermixing and duplication of gene bank accessions
[29,31-34]. A high level of genetic variation was confirmed here in a 5' sequence of α-gliadins coding for CDepitopes. Α-gliadin gene transcripts from two bread wheat
cultivars and two landraces of wheat together encoded 37
different α-gliadin isoforms (14 Gli-A2 isoforms, 13 GliB2 isoforms and 10 Gli-D2 isoforms). These isoforms
were found in a small region (135 to 216 base pairs in
size) in the 5' part of the α-gliadin gene and therefore
reflect only part of the variation within these four genotypes. In a Spanish collection of 22 cultivated diploid
einkorn wheats, which contain the Am-genome (diploid,
T. monococcum L. spp. monococcum), 14 different Gli-A2
allelic blocks were found, with up to four different alleles
per accession. The allele diagrams were composed of a
number of 5 up to 8 principle protein bands [35]. Here we
observed a similar number of Gli-A2 isoforms per genotype ranging from 3 to 10 (Figure 3 and 4).
Several studies have shown the unequal transcription
from the three homoeologous loci in hexaploid wheat
[36,37]. Nomura et al. [38] found differential expression
among the three homoeologous Bx-genes involved in
benzoxazinone biosynthesis and demonstrated a bias in
transcript levels towards the Bx homoeologs of the B
genome. Some of the alleles were efficiently transcribed
but showed only a weak enzymatic activity with the genes
from the B-genome contributing the most to Bx biosynthesis. Recently, Shitsukawa et al. [39] found a differential
contribution of the three homoeologs of a wheat class E
MADS box gene (WLHS1), where the A genome WLHS1
homoeolog appeared to be inactivated by an insertion
and the B homoeolog was predominantly silenced by
cytosine methylation. Kawaura et al. [21] observed that
Gli-B2 transcripts were underrepresented compared to
their homoeologs from the A and D genomes in a set of
ESTs from the NCBI database, which was a mixture of
sequences obtained from 'Chinese Spring' and some other
genotypes. Here, we confirm differences in relative expression of the homoeologous α-gliadin genes among genotypes, both as relative numbers of α-gliadin transcript
sequences from specific varieties as well as by using a
quantitative pyrosequencing assay for detection of relative

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/48

differences in Gli-A2 transcript frequencies larger than
5.9%.
Detailed sequence analysis of cloned α-gliadin transcripts
showed that in some hexaploid varieties the Gli-B2 genes
were hardly expressed (e.g., less than 5% in 'Lavett', Figure
2) but in others they made up more than 40% (in 'Baldus',
Figure 2).
As a consequence, the predicted CD-immunogenic capacity is partly depending on the ratio of differential expression of the homoelogous Gli-2 genes. These differences in
homoeoallelic expression may be due to epigenetic factors, or to the relative efficiency of transcription factors to
stimulate transcription across the homoeologous promoters in the polyploid. In the latter case, the factors could act
partly in cis (promoters that are switched on more easily
or are very specific) or in trans (differences in promiscuity
of transcription factors from the three genomes). Studies
of relative expression levels in progeny of crosses may
answer some of these questions. For this, a method for the
rapid and high throughput determination of differences
in allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms
in pools of DNA would be convenient, and according to
Neve et al. [40] and Wasson et al. [41] pyrosequencing is
a suitable method for this purpose. SNP allele frequencies
with 4% difference between populations could reliably be
detected [27] and for large genomic DNA pools, allele frequencies that differed by more then 5.2% would be significant [41]. Schaart et al. [42] used pyrosequencing to
study differences in the expression level of six different,
but highly (96.3% to 99.8%) homologous alleles of a
pathogenesis-related gene (PGIP) in octoploid strawberry
(Fragaria × ananassa). For genomic DNA samples, PGIP
gene differences in allele frequencies as small as 4.0 ±
2.8% were detected while for cDNA samples a higher variation was observed between the repeats in the experiments, ranging from 7.8 ± 1.3% for leaf and fruit samples
to 10 ± 2.1% in an experiment that included inoculation
with the fungus Botrytis cinerea. In these experiments different PGIP alleles that were specifically expressed in leaf
and fruit tissue were identified. These results demonstrated that pyrosequencing of cDNA samples is a useful
method to determine allele expression frequencies.
For the complex Gli-2 locus, we have developed here a
pyrosequencing assay based on two SNPs that are specific
for Gli-A2 genes. Somers et al. [43] proposed to call such
nucleotide polymorphisms 'homoeologous sequence variants' (HSV) as they do not distinguish alleles that are
inherited in a Mendelian fashion, but rather are sequence
variants that may occur in the same haploid genome. In
genomic DNA of hexaploid wheat cultivar 'Chinese
Spring' our assay detected significant frequency differences for the Gli-A2 genes as small as 3.300% ± 0.004 at P

< 0.001 (general ANOVA in Genstat, Table 2), which is in
the expected range for genomic DNA samples [40-42].
Based on the replications in 'Baldus' (Table 3), differences
in Gli-A2 transcript frequency as small as 5.9% are detectable among cDNA samples with this pyrosequencing
assay (LSD = 5.90% ± 0.02 at F test, p < 0.001; general
ANOVA in Genstat). The larger variation in Gli-A2 frequency in cDNA samples might be due to fluctuations in
expression of Gli-2 genes induced by environmental or
physiological factors. As the plants were grown in the
same season on plots in the same field these differences
were most likely not caused by the environment but may
reflect the high level of genetic diversity among the plants
within wheat accessions from the genebank (see below).

some Northern African landraces display a striking resemblance in their appearance facilitating the mixing of both
genotypes (personal communication Dr. Anton Zeven
and Dr. Noor Bas, CGN). The land variety CGN08190
(Deves) is another example of the mixed nature of some
genebank accessions. This accession is registered as tetraploid durum wheat but after analyzing expressed
sequence tag sequences it turned out that some plants of
this accession contained Gli-D2 transcripts derived from
hexaploid wheat (results not shown). The relative Gli-A2
expression frequencies of 17% and 19% as returned by
pyrosequencing (Figure 6) are comparable to the frequencies found in bread wheat cultivars (which range between
13% and 19%).

The relative differences in frequency of Gli-A2 expression
observed in the cloned expressed sequence tag (EST)
sequences of various genotypes (Figure 2) and those
found with pyrosequencing of Gli-A2 SNPs (Figure 6) correlated well in a comparison including tetraploid and hexaploid genotypes (R2 = 0.96). Pyrosequencing was not
sensitive enough for the detection of relative differences in
Gli-A2 transcript frequency below 5.9%. Also, the absolute levels of Gli-A2 transcripts were always higher in the
EST dataset. The amplicon used for cloning and sequencing of all ESTs is located in the 5'-region of the α-gliadins.
As the Gli-2 transcriptome is complex and may possibly
include over 100 different gene copies with a low overall
homology (<60%), and we were restricted to domains
that are conserved within each of the homoeologous loci
for the development of primers for pyrosequencing, these
primers were designed in the 3'-region of the genes, and
they had to include some degeneracy in the sequences. It
is therefore possible that a part of the Gli-A2 copies might
not be targeted by the pyrosequence primers, which
would account for some underestimation of the Agenome sequences. An alternative explanation is that part
of the Gli-A2 genes would lack the specific SNPs located in
the 3'-part of the gene while they are homologous to Agenomic α-gliadins in the 5'-region. However, this is not
likely as such variants have not been found in our EST
study, or in the genomic clones analyzed by Van Herpen
et al. [17]. We are currently developing a new pyrosequence assay that returned approximately twofold higher
Gli-A2 allele frequencies (results not shown).

As determined by pyrosequencing several T. turgidum
accession have genotypes with a lower Gli-A2 transcript
frequency compared to the advanced durum wheat cultivar 'Probstdorfer Pandur' (<41% Gli-A2 frequency) and
are interesting to include in studies towards the development of low CD-immunogenic tetraploid wheat varieties;
for instance, 'Dakar 52' (26% and 36% Gli-A2 transcripts)
and the landraces CGN07991 (25% and 33% Gli-A2 transcripts) and 'Dibillik Sinde' (26% and 39% Gli-A2 transcripts). The breeding line CGN10567 (26% and 32% GliA2 transcripts) is an interesting hexaploid candidate to
include in further analysis. For the selection of individual
genotypes with reduced CD-immunogenic potential individual genotypes of these accessions need to be characterized for ploidy level and for the frequency of sequences
coding for CD-epitopes in the Gli-2 transcriptome. Next,
the gluten fractions of selected plants have to be subjected
to immunoblot analysis using antibodies raised against
CD-epitopes and in vitro T-cell tests. The pyrosequence
assay developed will be a useful tool in the preliminary
screening of Gli-A2 frequencies wheat genotypes derived
from a wide range of wheat accessions. Furthermore, since
α-gliadins are not the only epitope-containing fraction,
subsequent studies on selected lines should incorporate
assays to screen for variation in other immunogenic gluten peptides that are present in γ-gliadins and low molecular weight glutenins. Future research may use new
generation DNA sequencing technologies [46,47] to enable high throughput analysis of pre-selected wheat lines
for variation in CD-epitopes.

Many genebank accessions and cultivars are not composed of genetically uniform germplasms [34,44,45].
Accessions of landraces are most often a mixture of hexaploid T. aestivum and tetraploid T. turgidum group durum
genotypes, as was evident for 'Sinde' CGN12041 in this
study. The accession was initially determined as hexaploid
T. aestivum (AABBDD) but the individual genotype analyzed here expressed no Gli-D2 sequences suggesting this
plant was a tetraploid (AABB). Indeed, recently it has been
observed that hexaploid and tetraploid individuals of

Conclusion
Here, we have shown that large differences exist in relative
expression levels from homoeologous Gli-2 loci among
wheat genotypes, both as relative numbers of ESTs from
specific varieties (Figure 3 and 4) and when using a quantitative pyrosequencing assay specific for Gli-A2 α-gliadin
genes (Table 3, Figure 6). The Gli-A2 specific pyrosequence assay was used to screen plants derived from a
series of wheat varieties for differential allelic expression
levels (>5.9%). The relative Gli-A2 expression level in a

tetraploid durum wheat cultivar ('Probstdorfer Pandur')
was 41%. In hexaploid bread wheat cultivars the relative
Gli-A2 frequency varied between 13% and 19% and in
landraces between 12% and 58%. The detailed analysis of
ESTs showed that in plants derived from two hexaploid
bread wheat cultivars the expression level of α-gliadin
genes from locus Gli-B2, encoding low CD-immunogenic
α-gliadin isoforms, ranged from less than 5% up to more
than 40% of the α-gliadin transcripts. Screening for differential Gli-A2 expression can be employed for the preselection of wheat varieties in the search for varieties with
very low CD-immunogenic potential.

Methods
[GenBank:GH162284 – GH160413; dbESTid: 6315749663157625]
Plant material
The homozygous 'Chinese Spring' deletion line 6AS-1
(Ta4540 L1), which lacks a part of the short arm of chromosome 6A including the Gli-A2 locus, was obtained
from the Wheat Genetic and Genomic Resources Center
http://www.k-state.edu/wgrc/. This deletion line was used
to test the A-genome specificity of the pyrosequence assay.
The hexaploid (genome composition AABBDD) 'Chinese
Spring' lines CGN04084, CGN04085 and CGN04086
were used as controls. The hexaploid cultivars 'Baldus'
(CGN19285) and 'Lavett' (CGN23549) and the tetraploid
(AABB) cultivar 'Probstdorfer Pandur' (CGN08262) were
assayed for the frequency of the Gli-A2 sequences in the αgliadin transcriptome at three developmental stages; 7
days post anthesis (DPA), 14 DPA and 21 DPA. These and
other wheat accessions (Table 1) were obtained from the
Centre for Genetic Resources (CGN), the Netherlands
http://www.cgn.wur.nl/Uk/. Those listed in Table 1 were
assayed for Gli-A2 frequency in cDNA of developing
wheat grains by pyrosequencing. The plants were grown
in adjacent fields in the spring and summer of 2005 at
location the 'Kievit', Plassteeg, Wageningen, The Netherlands in a sandy soil. The field was fertilized with Tripelsuperfosfate (45% P2O5) 108.97 kg/ha, Kali60 (60%
K2O) 108.97 kg/ha, Kalkammonsalpeter (27% N;
NH4NO3 + 6% CaCO3) 275 kg/ha. Developing kernels of
two individual plants per accession were harvested at
14DPA and 21DPA.
DNA isolation, RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Both, DNA and RNA were isolated according to the
method described by Doyle and Doyle [48] but with 1%
(w/v) poly-(vinylpyrrolidone)-10 in the extraction buffer.
Genomic DNA of the deletion line 6AS-1 and 'Chinese
Spring' lines was isolated from young leaves of 4 to 5 seedlings per genotype. Total RNA fractions of wheat accessions were isolated from grain tissue of 3–4 grains of one
ear of single plants, grown in adjacent fields in the spring
and summer of 2005. The ears were harvested at 7, 14 and

21 DPA. For the production of first strand cDNA 1 μg of
total RNA was treated with DNAse I (Invitrogen, amplification grade; 18068-015) followed by RT PCR (Invitrogen
SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR;
18080-051) using random hexamer primers in a final
reaction volume of 20 μl. Samples without SuperScript™
III reverse transcriptase (minus RT PCR) were included as
controls for the DNAse I treatment.
cDNA analysis
A fraction of 2 μl of the cDNAs was used as a template in
a PCR reaction with α-gliadin-specific primers (α1F: 5'atg
aaR acM ttt cYc atc-3'; α5R; 5'gtt agt acc gaa gat gcc-3').
Subsequently, the PCR products were cloned in pGEM®-T
Easy (Promega). For 'Tripshiro', 'Sinde', 'Lavett' and
'Baldus' the 5'-part of respectively 21, 27, 21 and 61 αgliadin cDNA clones was sequenced. [GenBank accession

This part of the gene contains the sequences coding for
important HLA-DQ2+ CD-epitopes, Glia-α2(αII), Gliaα9(αI), Glia-α9(αIII), Glia-α20 and an epitope involved
in the innate CD-immune response, p31-49 (Figure 1).
The sequences were assigned to one of the homoeologous
Gli-2 loci (Gli-A2, Gli-B2 or Gli-D2) by clustering (Clustal
W) with genomic sequences from diploid species Triticum
monococcum (A-genome; DQ002569 to DQ002583),
Aegilops speltoides (B-genome, DQ002584-DQ002588)
and
Aegilops
tauschii
(D-genome;
DQ002589DQ002599), as in Van Herpen et al. [17].
Pyrosequencing
First, a pyrosequence assay was developed using a primer
set (α-3prime-F1/α-3prime-R1-biotin) to amplify the 3'
target fragment for pyrosequencing, including all Gli-2
genes, from 20 ng of genomic DNA (deletion line 6AS-1
and Chinese Spring) or 2 μl cDNA sample. This amplification was performed in a 50 μl reaction volume, containing
0.4 μM of both reverse and forward primers (α-3primeF1: 5'-cagYctcWRBaRcaatatcc-3'; α-3prime-R1: 5'-BiotintggagggatRtaBacattgc-3'; both were HPLC-purified), dNTP
mix (0.2 mM each), 1.5 mM of MgCl2, 1× Goldstar buffer
(Eurogentec), and 1 U Goldstar DNA polymerase (Eurogentec) (5 U/μl). By performing 50 cycles of PCR all primers are used up to prevent interference with
pyrosequencing. PCR cycling used for cDNA: denaturation at 94°C for 5 minutes followed by 50 cycles of {94°C
for 30 seconds, 51°C for 1 minute and 72°C for 2 minutes} and 72°C for 10 minutes. PCR cycling used for
genomic DNA: denaturation at 94°C for 5 minutes followed by 50 cycles of {94°C for 30 seconds, 48°C for 1
minute and 72°C for 2 minutes} and 72°C for 10 minutes. The PCR product (30 μl) was linked to streptavidine

tion for 10 minutes at room temperature while shaking (4
μl beads in 26 μl 10 mM TRIS-HCl; 2 M NaCl; 1 mM
EDTA; 0.1% Tween 20).
Subsequently, the biotinylated PCR product was isolated
using a Vacuum prep tool, washed in 70% ethanol for 5
sec, denatured in 0.2 M NaOH for 5 sec and neutralized
for 5 sec in 10 mM Tris-acetate, pH = 7.5. Next, the biotinylated strand was transferred to 45 μl primer solution
(0.3 μM primer in 20 mM Tris-acetate, 2 mM MgAc2). To
target as many different Gli-A2 transcripts as possible in
one cDNA or genomic DNA sample a degenerated primer
was used for pyrosequencing. This primer consisted of the
primers α3'-SQ1a to α3'-SQ1e mixed in equally amounts
(0.06 μM each):

average frequency returned by both SNPs was calculated.
For the analysis of the Gli-A2 frequency in the Gli-2 transcriptome of wheat accessions, the analysis was performed
in triplicate on replicate samples of cDNA harvested on
21DPA and 14DPA, and in some cases also on 7DPA.

were also tested in Fishers' unprotected least significant

Calculation of the allele frequencies
The frequency of the Gli-A2 transcripts, expressed from
the A-genome, was calculated as follows:

1. Normalization of peak heights: Each sample was normalized for the background signal by subtracting the zero
peak values from the peak. Subsequently, the resulting
peak heights were calculated relative to a defined reference peak (peak A on position 10) corresponding to a
non-variable position in the sequence.
2. The Gli-A2 frequency was calculated from the normalized peak heights on two SNP positions (SNP1 and
SNP2). For SNP1 the frequency was calculated as the
height of peak position 2 (a T residue on pyrogram position 2 is specific for Gli-A2 genes) relative to the total peak
height for this position, which is the signal at position 2
plus that at position 3 (C on position 3 is specific for GliB2 and Gli-D2 genes). For SNP2 the Gli-A2 frequency was
calculated as the height of peak position 20 (a G on position 20 is present in all Gli-A2 genes) relative to the total
peak height for the SNP position 20 + position 21 (A on
position 21 is specific for Gli-B2 and Gli-D2 genes). Per

This research was funded by the Celiac Disease Consortium, an Innovative
Cluster approved by the Netherlands Genomics Initiative and partially
funded by the Dutch Government (BSIK03009), and the DLO program
'Plant and Animal for Human Health'. S.V.G. was supported by an IAC fellowship of the Netherlands' Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food
Safety.
