Abstract
Background: The territorial fishing zones of Australia and Indonesia are contiguous to the north
of Australia in the Timor and Arafura Seas and in the Indian Ocean to the north of Christmas Island.
The area surrounding the shared boundary consists of a variety of bio-diverse marine habitats
including shallow continental shelf waters, oceanic trenches and numerous offshore islands. Both
countries exploit a variety of fisheries species, including whaler (Carcharhinus spp.) and hammerhead
sharks (Sphyrna spp.). Despite their differences in social and financial arrangements, the two
countries are motivated to develop complementary co-management practices to achieve resource
sustainability. An essential starting point is knowledge of the degree of population subdivision, and
hence fisheries stock status, in exploited species.
Results: Populations of four commercially harvested shark species (Carcharhinus obscurus,
Carcharhinus sorrah, Prionace glauca, Sphyrna lewini) were sampled from northern Australia and
central Indonesia. Neutral genetic markers (mitochondrial DNA control region sequence and
allelic variation at co-dominant microsatellite loci) revealed genetic subdivision between Australian
and Indonesian populations of C. sorrah. Further research is needed to address the possibility of
genetic subdivision among C. obscurus populations. There was no evidence of genetic subdivision
for P. glauca and S. lewini populations, but the sampling represented a relatively small part of their
distributional range. For these species, more detailed analyses of population genetic structure is
recommended in the future.
Conclusion: Cooperative management between Australia and Indonesia is the best option at
present for P. glauca and S. lewini, while C. sorrah and C. obscurus should be managed independently.
On-going research on these and other exploited shark and ray species is strongly recommended.
Biological and ecological similarity between species may not be a predictor of population genetic
structure, so species-specific studies are recommended to provide new data to assist with
sustainable fisheries management.

Background
The Indo-Australian archipelago is a biogeograhically
complex region encompassing a series of continental
shelves, volcanic mountainous islands and deep-sea
trenches. The Indonesian section straddles the equator
and extends about 5000 km from east to west. It has the
world's highest marine endemism; including most the
diverse sea-grass meadows, greatest expanses of mangroves and most extensive coral reef communities [1]. The
Australian section is dominated by an extensive continental shelf extending offshore from three Australian state
jurisdictions; Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia. As the world's fourth most populous nation,
Indonesia has a high demand for food from the sea. The
landed tonnage of Indonesian fisheries is orders of magnitude larger than Australian fisheries. Indonesian and
Australian fishing zones are contiguous along much of the
northern Australian Exclusive Economic Zone that
extends 200 km from shore. There is considerable goodwill between the countries for cooperative management of
shared fisheries stocks [2].
The Indo-Australian archipelago contains about 30% of
the one thousand shark and ray species in the world [3].
Many of the species are endemic and new species of sharks
and rays continue to be described [eg. [4]]. Indonesia has
the world's largest elasmobranch catch [118,000 t in
2003, 1], but data on catch and effort in the commercial
and artisanal fisheries is severely lacking. In Australia, the
elasmobranch catch was approximately 3000 tonnes in
2001 consisting of about 180 species as target and incidental (bycatch) catch [5]. Only seven of these species are
regarded as adequately managed and monitored, with the
remainder being data-deficient for the purposes of assessing the sustainability of current catch rates [6]. Faced with
minimal species-specific information, fisheries managers
have to generalise across biologically similar groups when
making predictions about the effects of fisheries on shark
and ray populations.
Population genetic analysis at and below the species level
is an important starting point for species conservation and
sustainable exploitation. The biological unit described by
fisheries mathematical population models (sensu stock
assessment) is self-maintained by reproduction and subsequent recruitment and experiences natural and humanmediated mortality. Individuals within the unit share the
same gene-pool and are genetically isolated from other
such groups [7]. Population genetic analyses can identify
the number of such management units within the geographical distribution of a target species [8]. Population
genetic analyses can also identify groups of populations
that represent a significant part of the evolutionary legacy
of the species, which may have a higher conservation status than other populations in the range of the species [9].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/40

Other methods, such as otolith microchemical analyses
[10] and analyses of parasite distribution and abundance
[11] can detect population groupings below the species
level that may exist in response to, or in addition to,
genetic differentiation between populations.
The aim of this study was to assess intra-specific population genetic subdivision for four shark species that are codistributed in the Indo-Pacific and that support fisheries
in northern Australia and Indonesia; Dusky Shark Carcharhinus obscurus, Spot-tail Shark Carcharhinus sorrah,
Blue Shark Prionace glauca (Fa. Carcharhinidae) and Scalloped Hammerhead Sphyrna lewini (Fa. Sphyrnidae). Carcharhinids and Sphyrnids are placental livebearers with
low intrinsic rates of increase. Prionace glauca and S. lewini,
however, have notably higher fecundities than C. sorrah
and C. obscurus [12]. All are predators with naturally low
abundances. Except C. sorrah, the study species have
worldwide distributions; C. obscurus is found in coastal
and offshore, but not oceanic, waters; P. glauca is oceanic
but may be found close inshore when the continental
shelf is narrow and S. lewini is semi-oceanic occurring over
continental and insular shelves and adjacent deep water
[13]. Carcharhinus sorrah is restricted to the tropical Indowest Pacific and is found on continental and insular
shelves, primarily near reefs. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (Global) lists C. obscurus, P. glauca and S.
lewini as 'near threatened' and C. sorrah as data deficient.
We expected that the extent of genetic subdivision
between shark populations would be low because of their
capacity to move extensively within the geographic constraints of the study area. Three of the four species (C.
obscurus, P. glauca, S. lewini) attain large body sizes [greater
than 3.0 m; C. sorrah are smaller, 1.5–3.0 m; 12]. All species are regarded as strong and active swimmers, but this
may not lead to dispersal. The average distance moved
was 50 km for 23 species of sharks tagged and recaptured
off the northern Australia coastline between 1983 and
1997 [14], although the maximum distance moved was
greater than 1100 km. Dispersal occurs during juvenile to
adult phases, as there is no larval stage. Genetic subdivision has been demonstrated for S. lewini, but it was
reported on a larger spatial scale than our study area [eg.
between Pacific and Atlantic Ocean basins, [15]]. Genetic
subdivision between populations was observed for
another Carcharhinus species (C. limbatus) linked to the
occurrence of female philopatry to nursery areas in the
Atlantic coast of the US [16]. There are few studies on elasmobranch population structure in the Indo-west Pacific.
Dudgeon et al [17] reports population subdivision in the
leopard shark (Stegastoma fasciatum) in Australia and
south-east Asia, however this species is demersal and its
capacity for dispersal is unknown. Barriers to dispersal in
the Indo-Pacific could include deep-sea trenches and

strong currents. Various phylogenetic 'breaks' for marine
species from sea-horses to mackerel have been proposed
[18-21]. The results are discussed as the type of the information needed by management agencies for sustainable
harvesting plans of elasmobranchs in the bio-diverse
Indo-Australian region.

Methods
Collection locations and DNA extraction
Tissue samples from C. obscurus, C. sorrah, P. glauca and S.
lewini were collected from two areas in Australia and one
area in central Indonesia (Fig. 1). An additional Australian
location was included from the Gulf of Carpentaria for C.
sorrah to provide another test of gene flow restriction
between northern Australia and Indonesia. A more distant
location (mid-north Pacific) was included for P. glauca to
test the spatial extent of genetic homogeneity (Fig. 1). The
mtDNA sequence of one sample of S. lewini from the
Atlantic Ocean was included as a link between this study
and that of Duncan et al [15].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/40

In Australia, sharks were sampled from commercial
catches by on-board observers and fisheries biologists. In
Indonesia, samples were taken from landed catch at local
markets (Muara Angke, western Java and Tanjung Luar,
Lombok) by fisheries biologists. The fishing grounds represented were assumed to be within a 100 – 300 km radius
of the markets. White muscle (~200 mg) was sampled
from each specimen and preserved in either DMSO solution (20% dimethylsulphoxide in saturated NaCl solution) or 70% ethanol solution.
Total genomic DNA was extracted from ten to 50 mg of
preserved tissue using the Chelex method [22]. After heat
denaturation and brief centrifugation (1200 g for 5 min),
the supernatant containing genomic DNA was removed to
a fresh tube for subsequent manipulation and storage.
Taxonomic field identifications were based on morphological features, verified with photographs where necessary. While identification of the four species in this study

is relatively unproblematic for Carcharhinid and Sphyrnid sharks, samples lacking photo verification were confirmed by comparing mtDNA sequence to a reference
data-base for Carcharhiniformes species maintained by
JO's research group and by principal coordinates analysis
of genetic distance using GenAlex 6.1 [23] between all
pairs of samples within a species based on their microsatellite genotype. Outliers and misidentified samples were
removed from the study.
Mitochondrial DNA methods – laboratory
The 5' end of the control region (CR) of the mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) was amplified and sequenced. Approximately 1145 bp (base pairs) were amplified using the forward primers ProL2 (5' CTGCCCTTGGCTCCCAAAGC 3')
and the reverse primer PheCacaH2 (5' CTTAGCATCTTCAGTGCCAT 3') designed by Pardini et al. [24]. Each 50
μl PCR reaction contained 1× PCR buffer, 200 μM of each
dNTP, 1 μM of each primer, 2.5 mM of MgCl2, 4 units of
Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Doncaster, Vic, Australia)
and 5 μl of DNA template. The PCR cycling conditions
were 90 s at 94°C followed by 35 cycles of 5 s at 94°C, 30
s at 50°C and 30 s at 72°C with a final extension of 72°C
for 5 min. Amplified DNA was purified using a commercial purification kit. The cycle sequencing reaction used
ABI Big Dye Terminators v3.1®. Approximately 400 bp of
the control region was sequenced in one direction using
the forward primer. Sequences were obtained using an
automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems 3130xl).
Microsatellite methods – laboratory
Shark samples were genotyped with three to five microsatellite loci (C. obscurus, four loci; C. sorrah, five loci; P.
glauca, five loci and S. lewini, three loci). Microsatellite
loci were sourced from Ovenden et al [25], Feldheim et al
[26] and Keeney and Heist [27] and were generally
applied to non-target species (ie. as cross-species amplifications). Microsatellite PCRs were performed in 96-well
plates using a Perkin Elmer 9700 thermocycler. Reactions
(10 μl) contained 1 μl of PCR buffer ® (Qiagen P/L, Doncaster, Vic, Australia) containing Tris-HCl (pH 8.7), KCl
and (NH4)2 SO4; 4 mM MgCl2; 0.02 μM forward primer
with an M13 extension [28,29]; 0.2 μM reverse primer; 1.9
μM fluoro-labeled M13 primer; 0.3 units Taq DNA
polymerase (Qiagen); 200 μM dNTP (Pharmacia Biotech,
GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences P/L, Rydalmere, Australia);
1% bovine serum albumin and approximately 25 ng
genomic DNA template. The DNA template and enzyme
were denatured at 94°C for 1 min 30 s, followed by 35
cycles consisting of 94°C for 5 s, 60°C for 20 s and 72°C
for 30 s and a final extension at 72°C for 30 min. Loci
were amplified in separate reactions and then combined
for fragment separation according to label colour and
fragment size. Microsatellite fragment separation and
scoring was performed using capillary electrophoresis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/40

(ABI3130xl). The size in base pairs of microsatellite
amplicons was calculated to two decimal places and
amplicons were allocated to a 'bin' that represented the
mean allele size.
Mitochondrial DNA methods – data analyses
MtDNA control region sequence data was edited, aligned
and checked by eye using the software Sequencher v 4.1
(Genecodes, Ann Arbor, MI, US). Haplotypes and numbers of variable sites for each species were determined
using MacClade v3.08. Haplotype and nucleotide diversities were calculated using Arlequin version 3.11 [30].
Intraspecific phylogenies among haplotypes were estimated using Bayesian [MrBayes v 3.1, 31], maximum likelihood (ML) and parsimony methods [PAUP* v 4.0b10,
32]. Candidate species for use as outgroups were evaluated on the availability of CR sequence, ease of sequence
alignment, interspecies genetic similarity based on cytochrome oxidase I sequence [33] and robustness of topologies to alternate combinations of outgroups. For
Bayesian and ML analyses, the most appropriate model of
DNA evolution was selected using Akaike Information
Criteria using ModelTest v 3.7 [34]. The General Time
Reversible (GTR) model with gamma distributed amongsite rate variation was preferred for P. glauca (gamma
0.608). The GTR was also preferred for C. sorrah with
equal rates of variation among sites. The Hasegawa
Kishino Yano 85 model (HYK85) was preferred for C.
obscurus and S. lewini. Gamma was 0.479 for S. lewini and
zero for C. obscurus. ML phylogenies were estimated using
PAUP* v 4.0b10 [32] and nodal support was assessed
using non-parametric bootstrapping involving 2000
pseudo-replicates of the original sequence alignment.
Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was implemented using
MrBayes v 3.1 [31]. Four MCMC chains were run, starting
from different random trees that were sampled every 100
generations. Each MCMC run consisted of one million
generations after which the average standard deviation of
split frequencies was less than 0.01 and the potential scale
reduction factor was reasonably close to 1.0 for all parameters, as recommended by the MrBayes manual. The first
25% percent of generations were discarded as burn in. The
posterior probability values, after burn in and across the
four MCMC runs, were used to construct a 50% majority
rule consensus phylogeny. Intraspecific hapotype networks were constructed using the statistical parsimony
method of Templeton et al [35] with a 95% connection
limit using the TCS v 1.21 software [36].

The proportion of total mtDNA CR sequence variation
that was due to genetic differentiation between populations (pairwise ΦST) was measured for the one Indonesian
and two Australian populations. Where available, additional populations were included in the pairwise analyses.
Tamura-Nei distances [37] were used to describe sequence

variation between haplotypes, with gamma values determined by ModelTest v 3.7 (above). The significance of ΦST
values was tested by comparing the real ΦST with the ΦST
values produced from 1023 random permutations of the
data using Arlequin version 3.11 [30].

among collection locations. For instance, haplotype CO7
was found in 15% of the West Australia samples and 28%
of the samples from East Australia, but was not found in
Indonesia (Table 1). Nucleotide and haplotype diversity
also varied among locations. Both measures were highest
in Indonesia and lowest in the two Australian locations
(Table 1). Two haplotypes, which were only found in
Indonesia (CO01 and CO02), were placed in a well-supported clade (Bayesian posterior probability, 100; ML
bootstrap, 86), but other haplotypes only found in Indonesia (CO4, CO5) were not part of this clade (Fig. 2).
There was evidence that haplotypes CO01 and CO02
formed a distinct lineage within a parsimony network of
haplotypes (Fig. 2).

Microsatellite methods – data analyses
The null hypothesis of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was
tested using Genepop v 4.0.7 [38]. The program Microchecker [39] was used to investigate likely causes for possible deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Microsatellite genetic diversity was characterised by the number
of alleles per locus, expected (HE) and unbiased (UHE)
heterozygosity, observed heterozygosity (HO) and fixation
index using GenAlex 6.1 [23]. The probability of rejecting
the null hypothesis of genotypic disequilibrium between
pairs of loci across populations was tested using Genepop
v 4.0.7 [38]. Bonferroni corrections to p-values for performing multiple tests was determined by the method of
Sankoh et al [40]. Microsatellite allelic diversity was used
to investigate the degree of genetic subdivision between
Australia and Indonesia for the four shark species. This
was done using a standard population-pairwise FST
approach [41] implemented in GenAlex v 6.1 [23] and
Genepop v 4.0.7 [38]. Non-parametric bootstrapping was
implemented in GenAlex v6.1 to estimate p-values over
999 randomizations of the data set. Missing data for population pair-wise comparisons was handled by interpolation in GenAlex v6.1.

Results

Carcharhinus obscurus microsatellite genotypes were
obtained from four loci. Low numbers of microsatellite
genotypes were obtained from East Australia, which had
downstream analysis implications. For that population,
small sample sizes increased the confidence limits around
allele frequencies [42] and most likely caused disequilibrium in genotype proportions at two of the four loci
(Table 2). One of these loci (CS02) was out of HW equilibrium among samples from other locations. The mean
unbiased expected heterozygosity across populations and
loci was 0.762. The mean number of alleles across populations was four for locus Cli108, 10.67 ± 3.33 (mean ±
SE) for locus CS02, 13.33 ± 2.67 for locus CS06 and 3.33
± 0.33 for locus LS24. Genotypic disequilibrium was not
detected for pairwise comparisons of the three loci (ie.
excluding CS02) in the three populations.

change when the analysis was repeated without the locus
that was not in Hardy-Weinberg proportions (CS02).

Comparisons involving East Australia across the two
classes of genetic markers were not significant.
Carcharhinus sorrah
Twelve mtDNA haplotypes were found for C. sorrah, and
there were pronounced differences in their frequencies
between the three collection locations. Two haplotypes
(CS01 and CS10) were only found in Indonesia, nine haplotypes were only found in Australian samples and only
haplotype (CS02) was shared between Indonesia and Australia (Table 4). Phylogenetic analysis separated the Australian and Indonesian sequences into two wellsupported clades (Fig. 3). The haplotype that was shared
between Australia and Indonesia (CS02) showed close
similarity to the Indonesian group of haplotypes. A single
shark with haplotype CS02 was collected from Australian
waters (Gulf of Carpentaria) suggesting that it, or its
maternal ancestor, may have dispersed from Indonesia.
Haplotypes found in Indonesia (CS01, CS02 and CS10)
formed a cluster on the parsimony network and their connection to the remainder was equally parsimonious via
either CS03 or CS04.

Carcharhinus sorrah samples were assayed in sufficient
numbers (43.3 ± 2.6, mean ± SE) for statistical analyses
from four populations using five microsatellite loci (Table
5). There were three instances of genotypic proportions
not following Hardy-Weinberg expectations, but as they
were not associated with particular loci or collection locations, their effect on subsequent analyses were judged to
be slight. Unbiassed heterozygosity was 0.55 ± 0.07 and
the number of alleles was 3.50 ± 0.96 for locus LS15,
12.50 ± 1.66 for locus CT05, 6.25 ± 0.18 for locus CS12,
5.50 ± 0.96 for locus Cli100 and 26.25 ± 1.44 for locus
CS08 across loci and populations. Genotypic disequilibrium was not detected for pairwise comparisons of the five
loci in the four populations.
Population subdivision for C. sorrah was detected
between Indonesia and the three Australian collection

Prionace glauca
Sixteen mtDNA control region haplotypes were identified
(Table 7) with little or no evidence of partitioning among
populations. The most common haplotypes (PG03 and
PG06) were evenly distributed across the four collection
locations. Only the rare haplotypes; for example PG10,
PG15 and PG16, were found in one geographic location;
this apparent range restriction was because they were only
sampled once each (Table 7). Haplotype and nucleotide
diversity was similar across collection locations. There are
no well-supported clades on the phylogenetic tree of haplotypes that show distinctiveness, and the haplotype network has no distinct structure (Fig. 4).

Prionace glauca samples from four populations were
assayed with five microsatellite loci. Sample sizes were
adequate, except for the number of genotypes produced
using locus Cli100 on samples from the Mid North Pacific
(Table 8). Two populations (West Australia and East Australia) showed evidence of lack of equilibrium for genotype proportions for two loci, CS02 and CT06.

Key: Significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are shown (*).

Widespread disequilibrium in genotype proportions for
locus CS02, which was reported here for C. obscurus samples, was not a feature of the results for P. glauca, except
for samples from West Australia where null alleles were
implicated. Detailed analyses of locus CT06 raw data suggested that allele stuttering might have resulted in scoring
errors, as there was a significant shortage of heterozygote
genotypes with alleles of one repeat unit difference.
Instances of departures from Hardy-Weinberg proportions for P. glauca data were judged to be minor and
unlikely to bias results. Unbiassed heterozygosity for P.
glauca loci was 0.58 ± 0.05 and the number of alleles was
15.00 ± 1.08 for locus CS02, 5.00 for locus CT04, 5.75 ±
0.25 for locus CT06, 3.00 ± 0.41 for locus Cli107 and 4.25
± 0.75 for locus Cli100 across loci and populations. Genotypic disequilibrium was not detected for pairwise comparisons of the five loci in the four populations.

There were no instances of genetic subdivision between
collection locations for P. glauca from Australia, Indonesia
or the northern Pacific Ocean with either class of genetic
marker (Table 9).
Sphyrna lewini
Eight mtDNA control region haplotypes were identified
amongst Indonesian and Australian samples (Table 10).
Haplotype SL02 was the most common and was found in
all collection locations at similar frequencies. As such it
provided little to no evidence of population genetic structure on this geographic scale. Likewise, the distribution of
remaining haplotypes provided no consistent information about gene flow between populations. An Atlantic
Ocean haplotype [number 16, 15] was included here as
SL09 to highlight the divergence between the Indo-Pacific
and Atlantic Ocean areas. Haplotypes SL03 and SL07

formed a well-supported clade in the phylogeny and were
outliers within the haplotype network (Fig. 5). Suprisingly, they were as distinct from the remainder as the
Atlantic haplotype (SL09). They were sampled between
one (SL07) and four times (SL03) from West Australia
and Indonesia populations.
Sample sizes of genotypes assayed with microsatellite loci
were adequate for S. lewini, with the mean (± SE) number
being 52.78 (6.17) over the three collection locations and
three microsatellite loci (Table 11). However, the degree
of polymorphism of one locus (CT06) was poor. It was
monomorphic in Indonesia and East Australia, had only
two alleles in West Australia and heterozygotes were not
detected. Lack of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was
detected for locus Cli100 in Indonesia and locus CT07 in
West Australia, which detailed analyses suggested was due
to cryptic allelic stuttering or presence of null alleles. Genotypic disequilibrium was not detected for pairwise comparisons of the three loci in the three populations.
As for P. glauca, genetic subdivision among S. lewini populations from Indonesia, East Australia and West Australia
was not detected with mtDNA control region sequences or
microsatellite allele frequencies (Table 12).

Discussion
We have shown here that fisheries stocks of two species (P.
glauca and S. lewini) most likely extend across the economic zones of Australia and Indonesia, suggesting that
both countries are likely to be exploiting the same
resource. Conversely, there is evidence of genetic population subdivision between the fisheries stocks of the spottail shark (C. sorrah) of the two countries, and there is
some genetic evidence that a fourth species (dusky shark,
C. obscurus) may also be subdivided along these lines. Prionace glauca and S. lewini are relatively large, ocean-going
shark species, which would be expected to move freely
across the Arafura and Timor Seas that are bisected by the
fishing zones of the two countries.
While neither C. sorrah or C. obscurus are off-shore or truly
pelagic species the finding of population subdivision was
not expected. However, the robust design of this study
adds weight to this finding. Two classes of independent
genetic markers were used. Mitochondrial DNA is cytoplasmic, whereas microsatellite loci are derived from DNA
in the cell nucleus. MtDNA is maternally inherited, while
microsatellite loci are biparentally inherited [43]. Nucleotide sequencing was used for mtDNA, while variation in
allelic frequencies was assessed for microsatellite loci.

collection location of sampled haplotypes is numbered (in
italics) according to Fig. 1.

Concordance between markers is taken as robust evidence
of population structure [eg. [44,45]] and is considered
best-practise when defining fisheries stocks [46]. The finding of genetic subdivsion between C. sorrah populations is
emphasised by the apparent lack of subdivision among
samples of other species (eg. P. glauca and S. lewini) that
were collected from the same locations and analysed with
the same suite of genetic methods. The genetic population
subdivision between northern Australia and Indonesia
reported here for C. sorrah needs to be tested with other
methods, such as parasite distribution and abundance [eg.
[11]] or stable isotope analysis of hard parts [eg. [47]].
The application of a range of non-genetic methods in further testing fisheries stock boundaries in all four shark
species studied here would be valuable in view of the challenges faced in this study with the application of microsatellite markers. Cross-species, rather than speciesspecific, loci were used due to the limited availability of
microsatellite loci for sharks and rays. This may have been
responsible for comparatively inconsistent amplification
of loci across samples within a species, leading to lower
than ideal sample sizes. Other problems that may be
potentially clarified in future by using species-specific loci

There are 31 species in the genus Carcharhinus [13]. The
majority are found close to shore and are susceptible to
exploitation. Nine globally distributed species (C. albimarginatus, C. altimus, C. brevipinna, C. falciformis, C. leucas,
C limbatus, C. longimanus, C. obscurus, and C. plumbeus)
occur in the Indo-Pacific, and the distribution of a further
14 species is centred on this region; C. amblyrhynchoides
(also found in Indian Ocean), C. amboinensis (with
Indian), C. amblyrhynchos (with west Pacific)C. borneensis,
C. cautus, C. dussumieri (with Indian), C. fitzroyensis, C.
hemiodon (with Indian), C. macloti (with Indian), C.
melanopterus (with Indian and west Pacific), C. sealei (with
Indian), C. sorrah (with Indian and west Pacific), and C.
tilstoni and Carcharhinus sp. A. Population genetic subdivision has not been investigated for any of these species in
the Indo-Pacific or elsewhere, except for C. sorrah (this
study) and C. limbatus [48]. Keeney and Heist [48] found
two major clades between ocean basins (western Atlantic,
Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea clades, and eastern
Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Ocean clades) based on
mtDNA control region sequence, and shallow population
structure within ocean basins. We strongly recommend
the assessment of population structure of other Carcharhinus species in the Indo-Pacific to assist with their conservation. The group of species has high regional
biodiversity, economic importance and high levels of
exploitation, which predisposes them to non-sustainable
harvesting.
This is underlined by our finding that at least one IndoPacific species (C. sorrah) is potentially exposed to local
population depletion. There is concern for the status of C.
sorrah populations in Indonesia as fishing methods target
this species, but the relative catch rate is consistently
below that of the fishery in northern Australia [49]. Here
we report that Indonesian and northern Australian populations are genetically subdivided. Consequently, the
exploited Indonesian populations may not be replenished
by migration, which justifies concerns for their susceptibility to overexploitation. As C. sorrah is commonly
reported from inshore waters less than 200 m, the deep
water of the Timor Trench (2 – 3000 m) is implicated as
the isolating mechanism preventing gene flow between
northern Australia and central Indonesia. The Timor
Trench divides the northwestern edge of the Sahul continental shelf from the islands of central Indonesia. Deep
water was also implicated in the stock structure of commercial snappers in this region [44,50]. The degree of
population genetic subdivision in C. sorrah in northern
Australia in this study was similar to the overall low levels
of genetic subdivision reported in a previous allozyme
study [data not shown, [51]]. We agree with Lavery and

sample sizes were low, but sample sizes were adequate for
the comparison between West Australia and Indonesia.

Our mtDNA sequence data suggested that genetic population subdivision might exist between C. obscurus Australia
and Indonesia. We strongly recommend that this hypothesis is tested with further studies as our sampling strategy,
particularly on the Australian west coast was sparse. However, Indonesian samples possessed two haplotypes (CO1
and CO2) that were not found in Australia, and there was
evidence that those haplotypes had a common evolutionary history. The same conclusion would have been
reached if samples from West Australia were grouped into
two sampling locations rather than one. Unfortunately,
the power of microsatellite data to resolve population
structure in this species may have been compromised for
the comparison between East Australia and Indonesia, as

In contrast to the genetic differentiation between northern
Australian and Indonesian populations for C. sorrah and
possibly C. obscurus, no differentiation is reported here on
this scale for two other shark species; P. glauca and S.
lewini. Furthermore, the inclusion of a northern Pacific
Ocean sample of P. glauca suggests that genetic homogeneity in this species extends over large geographic scales.
Both P. glauca and S. lewini are distributed worldwide,
have large body sizes and hence are likely to have high dispersal capacity. Duncan et al [15] confirmed this for S.
lewini. They found little mtDNA control region sequence
variaton among samples from in-shore nursery grounds
within ocean basins. However, they did discover an upper
limit to gene flow in females, as genetic subdivision was

pronounced between Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Ocean
basins. Duncan et al [15] also found that control region
haplotype diversity was pronounced within the IndoPacific and our study confirms this. Indonesian and west
Australian haplotypes SL03 and SL07 were as distinct
from the majority of S. lewini haplotypes as SL09, which
was sampled from the North Atlantic Ocean and which
has the same sequence as haplotype 16 from Duncan et al
[15]. Prionace glauca populations have not been previously assessed for degree of genetic subdivision. This
study and the work by Duncan et al [15] on a similarly
oceanic species (S. lewini) provides an hypothesis that can
be tested in future studies: genetic homogeneity in P.
glauca extends within, but not between, ocean basins. Further research that contributes to the sustainable management of this species is urgently needed. Clarke et al [52]
used DNA-based and morphological species identification methods to show that P. glauca dominated (17%, by
weight) dried shark fin auctioned at a Hong Kong market.
This study on shark population subdivision parallels previous research on red and gold snapper in northern Australia and Indonesia, which led to cooperative fisheries
management actions directed at ensuring sustainability.
Four Lutjanidae snapper species with similar biology were
compared from the same collection locations. The species
had the same habitat preferences (marine, reefs to 180 m)
except for L. argentimaculatus, whose juveniles inhabit
freshwater before becoming fully marine on maturation.
Unlike shark species, snapper species are highly fecund
(106 eggs/female/spawning season) with pelagic eggs and

larvae. But like sharks, there was no expectation of population subdivision in the Indo-Pacific. One species (Pristipomoides multidens) had pronounced genetic subdivision
[50,53]. The two red snapper species had moderate [Lutjanus erythropterus, [44]] and low [Lutjanus malabaricus, [44]]
degrees of subdivision. The fourth species [Lutjanus argentimaculatus, [54]] was not genetically subdivided. The
presence of genetic subdivision was explained by previously unrecognised site fidelity across life history stages.
New knowledge about the geographic extent of L. malabaricus fisheries stocks in the region allowed the development of a biomass dynamic stock assessment model,
which showed that current levels of harvesting were
unsustainable. Australia and Indonesia are working
together to co-manage shared stocks and fishing practises
for snapper species have been modified [2]. It is expected
that the work reported here will contribute to co-management actions on shared shark stocks.
Genetic analyses of population structure are an important
component of fisheries management. When populations
are genetically subdivided this information can be used to
define the geographic boundaries of a fisheries stocks.
Boundaries provide the confidence to use estimates of
recruitment, growth and mortality (natural and fishing)
to describe fisheries populations in mathematical models.
However, when genetic analyses of population structure
suggest the absence of genetic subdivision, this implies
fisheries stocks are widely distributed. If this occurs, two
courses of action are appropriate. Firstly, further research
should be sponsored to test the hypothesis of no subdivi-

Indo-Pacific P. glauca and S. lewini populations.

Inferred phylogeny (A) and statistical parsimony network (B) among haplotypes of S. lewini. The phylogeny
was rooted with S. mokarran and E. blochi and nodal support
is given as Bayesian posterior probabilities/ML boostrap support. Dash (-) indicates support of less than 50%. In the network, each indicated step (circle) represents a single
nucleotide difference in the mtDNA control region
sequence. The area of circles is scaled to represent the relative frequency of that haplotype and the smallest circle represent inferred haplotypes that were not sampled. Haplotype
SL09 from the North Atlantic (Atl) is equivalent to Duncan

sion using a range of genetic and non-genetic methods.
Researchers need to keep management agencies up-todate with latest results, in case stock subdivision is found
and management can occur independently. Secondly,
management arrangements need to be applied and coordinated among authorities responsible. It is not sufficient
for exploitation in only one part of the stock to be regulated, as unregulated exploitation elsewhere in the stock

Using mtDNA and microsatellite loci, this study has contributed to the definition of stock boundaries for one (C.
sorrah) and maybe two (C. obscurus) exploited shark species, and has shown that the nations of Australia and
Indonesia are most likely exploiting the same stocks of P.
glauca and S. lewini. Australian authorities are aware of the
need for catch limits on C. sorrah and Indonesia would be
wise to take similar action. Indonesia is drafting a national
plan of action for shark exploitation. Generally, we have
also demonstrated the difficulties associated with predicting the presence of genetic subdivision even for co-distributed and ecologically similar species. For sustainable
management and conservation purposes, we advocate a
species-by-species assessment of population structure, at
least until clear patterns emerge in the bio-diverse IndoPacific region.
