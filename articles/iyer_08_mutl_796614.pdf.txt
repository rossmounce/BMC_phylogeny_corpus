Abstract
: The provenance and biochemical roles of eukaryotic MORC proteins have remained poorly
understood since the discovery of their prototype MORC1, which is required for meiotic nuclear
division in animals. The MORC family contains a combination of a gyrase, histidine kinase, and MutL
(GHKL) and S5 domains that together constitute a catalytically active ATPase module. We identify
the prokaryotic MORCs and establish that the MORC family belongs to a larger radiation of several
families of GHKL proteins (paraMORCs) in prokaryotes. Using contextual information from
conserved gene neighborhoods we show that these proteins primarily function in restrictionmodification systems, in conjunction with diverse superfamily II DNA helicases and endonucleases.
The common ancestor of these GHKL proteins, MutL and topoisomerase ATPase modules appears
to have catalyzed structural reorganization of protein complexes and concomitant DNAsuperstructure manipulations along with fused or standalone nuclease domains. Furthermore,
contextual associations of the prokaryotic MORCs and their relatives suggest that their eukaryotic
counterparts are likely to carry out chromatin remodeling by DNA superstructure manipulation in
response to epigenetic signals such as histone and DNA methylation.
Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Arcady Mushegian and Gaspar Jekely.

Introduction
The microchidia gene product (MORC1) was found to be
required for the completion of prophase I of meiosis during mammalian spermatogenesis [1]. Disruption of the
microrchidia gene also resulted in altered localization of
the meiotic endonuclease, Spo11 [2]. It was noticed that
MORC1 was the prototype of a novel family (MORC family) of eukaryotic chromatin proteins which possess a
gyrase, histidine kinase, and MutL (GHKL) domain [3-5].
Phyletic analysis showed that the MORC proteins are
widely distributed in eukaryotes, being present in most
major crown group lineages (except fungi), apicomplexans and heteroloboseans, suggesting a relatively early ori-

gin in eukaryotes [5]. Consistent with a chromatinassociated role, the MORCs display fusions to several
DNA- and peptide-binding domains, which are commonly found other eukaryotic chromatin proteins [5].
However, their exact functions in chromatin dynamics are
poorly understood. The evolutionary origin of the MORC
family also remains unclear, as their specific relationship
to other conserved eukaryotic members of the GHKL
superfamily remain unstudied.

Identification of prokaryotic Restriction Modification
systems encoding MORC family proteins
To unravel the provenance and relationships of the
MORC family, we initiated sequence profile searches
using the PSI-BLAST program seeded with eukaryotic
MORC proteins. These searches additionally retrieved several prokaryotic homologs (within first 3 iterations; evalue < .01), prior to other members of the GHKL superfamily. A multiple alignment of the eukaryotic MORCs
with these prokaryotic homologs showed that both versions contained all four conserved motifs required for
adenosine and phosphate binding in the GHKL superfamily (Fig. 1). Additionally, the prokaryotic homologs
contained a C-terminal α+β domain with the same secondary structure as the S5-fold domain that is also found
in a subset of the GHKL superfamily, namely the topoisomerase ATPase domains, MutL and Hsp90. This S5
domain usually provides a conserved basic residue, which
might function similar to the arginine or lysine finger
observed in various phosphohydrolase reactions [6].
These findings suggest that the MORCs are active enzymes
capable of ATP hydrolysis. The prokaryotic and eukaryotic
MORC homologs were unified to the exclusion of the
other GHKL proteins by a specific GhXhhpXXRhl motif
(h: hydrophobic, p: polar, X: any) in the S5-fold domain
(Fig. 1). The prokaryotic MORC proteins were widely, but
sporadically, distributed in several distantly related bacteria such as proteobacteria, cyanobacteria and actinobacteria, as well as certain crenarchaea and euryarchaea [7].
Additionally, in a phylogenetic tree versions from the
same bacterial lineage (e.g. proteobacteria) often do not
group together. This is suggestive of extensive lateral transfer of these genes between diverse prokaryotes.

To acquire functional insights on prokaryotic MORCs by
means of contextual information, we systematically
explored their conserved gene neighborhoods or predicted operons. Consequently, we uncovered several types
of predicted operons encoding MORC proteins (Fig. 2). A
consistent theme in the majority of these predicted geneneighborhoods (~70%) was the presence of a gene encoding a superfamily II (SFII) helicase. In computational
experiments, the probability that such an association
occurs by chance alone in phylogenetically distinct bacterial lineages is less than .0001, suggesting that the MORCSFII gene neighborhood was a significant functional association. Based on the evolutionary relationships of the
SFII helicase we identified three major types of predicted
operons (Fig. 2): 1) The first set of these encoded Rad25like helicases, which are usually found in type III restriction-modification (RM) systems. Analysis of the Rad25like helicases showed that they were commonly fused to
C-terminal or N-terminal RE fold DNAses, as is typical of
previously characterized type-III RM systems [8]. In a few
instances, rather than a RE fold nuclease, we found an N-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/8

terminal HKD superfamily phosphoesterase domain, that
could potentially function as a nuclease [9]. 2) The SFII
helicase in the second group of predicted operons
belonged to the SWI2/SNF2 family. These operons also
often encoded DNAses belonging to the HNH (EndoVII
fold) superfamily or EcoRII-like nucleases. Some of these
neighborhoods also encoded a protein with a VP1/RAV
DNA-binding domain, which has also been found in association with REs like EcoRII [10]. 3) The third type of
operon encoded a distinct SFII helicase with a conserved
C-terminal globular α+β domain possessing a DThhQXuRhFG motif (h: hydrophobic, u: tiny). These gene neighborhoods consistently contained an additional gene
encoding an uncharacterized conserved protein. Sequence
profile searches with these protein recovered the members
of the RE fold and they displayed the E-D-ExK motifs typical of the classical RE superfamily [11].
The above gene neighborhoods also frequently contained
genes for DNA methylases (mostly cytosine and rarely
adenine) and predicted endonucleases of the very short
patch repair (VSR) superfamily of the RE fold [11]. A
minority of conserved gene neighborhoods combined
MORC genes with those coding DNA methylases or REs,
but lacked helicase genes. A subset of these of gene neighborhoods also encoded another distinct version of the
GHKL superfamily (hereafter termed paraMORC1 family), with intact catalytic motifs and a distinct conserved
C-terminal extension beyond the predicted S5 domain.
We noticed that members of the paraMORC1 family
might also co-occur in predicted operons with HNH
endonucleases (Fig. 2). Thus, the predicted operons with
prokaryotic MORC genes appear to predominantly
encode a diverse set of RM systems.
Related RM systems contain other distinct families of
GHKL proteins
In course of the above analysis, we noticed some conserved gene-neighborhoods those were closely related to
the above-described MORC-containing operons, but differed from them in lacking a MORC gene. Given that there
are several instances of displacement of genes in operons
by other genes coding functionally equivalent, but evolutionarily distinct proteins families, we examined these
operons for potential replacements for the MORCs. To do
this we systematically explored the related operons without MORCs and represented the neighborhood associations as a network diagram (Fig. 2). As result we
discovered candidate genes that showed comparable
neighborhood associations as the MORCs with the distinct SFII helicase genes, as well as DNA methylases, Vsr
superfamily endonucleases and the above-described predicted endonucleases of the RE fold (Fig. 2). Strikingly,
further sequence analysis of these candidates showed that
they belonged to four new families of GHKL ATPases –

Figure alignment of the MORCs, MGHKls and some characterized GHKL domains
Multiple1
Multiple alignment of the MORCs, MGHKls and some characterized GHKL domains. Jpred predicted Secondary
structure is shown above the alignment. The 75% consensus shown below the alignment was derived using the following
classes of amino acids: hydrophobic (h: ALICVMYFW, yellow shading); the aliphatic subset of the hydrophobic class (l: LIV, yellow shading); hydrophobic (h: ACFILMVWY, yellow shading); small (s: ACDGNPSTV, green); the tiny subset of the small class
(u: GAS, green); polar (p: CDEHKNQRST, blue); alcohol subset of polar (o: ST, brown); charged subset of polar (c: DEHKR,
pink); positive subset of polar (+: HKR, pink). Amino acids in red background are completely conserved. Different subgroups of
MORCS are indicated at the right end of the alignment. The sequences are denoted by their gene name followed by species
abbreviation and GenBank Identifier separated by underscores. The species abbreviations are: Abac: Acidobacteria bacterium;
Atha: Arabidopsis thaliana; Avar: Anabaena variabilis; Bpum: Bacillus pumilus; Bsp.: Bacillus sp.; Bsp.: Bradyrhizobium sp.; Btau: Bos taurus; Buni: Bacteroides uniformis; Bwei: Bacillus weihenstephanensis; Cbar: Clostridium bartlettii; Cbot: Clostridium botulinum; Ccre: Caulobacter crescentus; Cele: Caenorhabditis elegans; Cjej: Campylobacter jejuni; Clit: Congregibacter litoralis; Cpar: Cryptosporidium parvum;
Drer: Danio rerio; Fnuc: Fusobacterium nucleatum; Fpsy: Flavobacterium psychrophilum; Glov: Geobacter lovleyi; Gthe: Geobacillus thermodenitrificans; Hsap: Homo sapiens; Jsp.: Janibacter sp.; Jsp.: Jannaschia sp.; Lbla: Leeuwenhoekiella blandensis; Lwel: Listeria welshimeri; Mace: Methanosarcina acetivorans; Mpen: Mycoplasma penetrans; Msp.: Marinobacter sp.; Nsp.: Nitrobacter sp.; Nvec:

Gene neighborhoods, domain architectures and contextual information graph of MORCS and related GHKL families
Gene neighborhoods, domain architectures and contextual information graph of MORCS and related GHKL
families. A) The gene neighborhoods are shown for selected MORCs (left panel) and paraMORCS (right panel). The direction
of arrows indicates transcriptional direction and dots indicate intervening regions that might contain additional genes. Representative gene names are shown below each operon type. B) Representative domain architectures of MORCs and related proteins are shown. SMC_hinge: Structural maintenance of chromosome protein hinge domain; HTH: helix-turn-helix domain;
BAM: Bromo-associated motif (also known as bromo-associated homology domain); TAM/MBD: C-methyl-DNA-binding
domain; Z1, Z2, Z3 and X1, X2, X3 are uncharacterized domains. C) Ordered graph showing contextual information from
gene neighborhoods and domain architectures. Solid arrows indicated information from domain architectures and dotted lines
indicate information from gene neighborhoods. The direction of arrows denotes the order of genes in operons or order of
domains in proteins from N-terminal to C-terminal. Red edges correspond to physical interactions between the domains.
Genes are shown with hexagons and domains are shown as rounded rectangles. The domain coloring highlights the major contextual themes that are consistently seen with these proteins even if the actual domains belong to different families or are
structurally distinct. For example, domains occurring only in eukaryotes are in yellow, nucleases are colored pink, methylases
in green and non-GHKL ATPases in blue. Standard gene names are used. Additional Gene name abbreviations include: DAM:
DNA Adenine Methylase; DCM: DNA Cytosine Methylase; HKD: possible nuclease domain of Phospholipase D fold; NRE:

paraMORC2-5. While being distantly related to the
MORCs, and lacking the specific motif that unifies the
MORC family, paraMORC1 and the newly identified families paraMORC2-5 showed a general architectural similarity to the MORCs. All of them possess N-terminal
GHKL domains with conserved ATP-binding motifs combined to a C-terminal S5 domain. Of these, the
paraMORC2 and paraMORC3 families are, like the
MORCs, widely but sporadically distributed in distantly
related bacteria and archaea, suggesting extensive lateral
mobility. The paraMORC2 family is predominantly
present in cyanobacteria and Gram-positive bacteria,
whereas the paraMORC3 family is prevalent in proteobacteria and the bacteroidetes clade. The remaining two families (paraMORC4-5) are more infrequent, and patchy in
their distributions.

similar functions as the MORCs, predominantly as components of RM systems. However, a subset of the
paraMORC3 family (i.e. those with C-terminal endonuclease domains), mainly in proteobacteria and bacteriodetes occur as standalone genes without any conserved
neighborhood associations. This might imply that these
members of the paraMORC3 family might have acquired
distinct functions independent of the RM systems or in a
few species may function with RM systems at unlinked
locations.

Members of the paraMORC2 possess a strongly conserved
ExxxH motif in the C-terminal part of their S5 domain,
which might form a distinctive substrate interaction site of
this family. The paraMORC3 family is typified by the presence of an additional conserved C-terminal globular
domain. Sequence profile analysis of this conserved
domain recovered significant hits to several RecB family
nucleases and revealed the presence of a conserved E-DExK motifs [11], indicating that it is likely to be an endonuclease domain of the RE fold. Similarly, several members of the paraMORC4 and paraMORC5 families also
possessed their own conserved C-terminal extensions.
Analysis of the extension of the paraMORC4 family
showed that it is a TIR domain [12], which might alternatively also be encoded in a standalone form by a neighboring gene. The TIR domain possesses a Rossmannoid
fold, with a potential ligand-binding site in the classical
position of this fold, formed by conserved polar residues
in the loop between the first strand and helix and the
region immediately C-terminal to the 3rd conserved strand
(usually a Sx [ND] motif) [12]. In the TIR domains associated with the paraMORC4 family and their close relatives
a highly conserved Hx [ST]xD motif is present in the loop
between first strand and helix. This could potentially form
a catalytic or ligand-binding site of these domains. Given
the presence of similarly linked C-terminal nuclease
domains in paraMORC3 and other GHKL superfamily
members like MutL and topoisomerases (see below) it is
possible that this version of the TIR domain is a nuclease.
Alternatively, it might function as an allosteric nucleotide
or nucleic acid binding site. The C-terminal domain of the
paraMORC5 family appears unrelated to any other previously known domain, but contains some highly conserved polar residues (e.g a HxH motif), which could
again define an uncharacterized nuclease active site.

Mechanistic and evolutionary implications of the
contextual associations of the MORCs and paraMORCs
The above-described architectural and contextual observations on MORCs and paraMORCs provide considerable
clues regarding their potential functional mechanisms.
Their contextual associations imply direct physical and
functional associations between these ATPases, one or
more distinct DNAses and SFII helicases in these RM systems. These are highly reminiscent of the architectures
and functional associations of other members of the
GHKL superfamily with DNA-related functions. In both
topoisomerases and MutL the GHKL domain functionally
interacts with a nuclease domain that is either present Cterminal to the ATPase domain or as a standalone
polypeptide. In the case of topoisomerases the nuclease is
a TOPRIM domain [13]. In the case of MutL from
Escherichia coli and several related proteobacteria, the
nuclease in mismatch repair (MMR) is a standalone protein MutH, while in very short patch pair it is the vsr endonuclease; both nucleases contain a RE fold [11,14]. In a
subset of the eukaryotic Mlh proteins (e.g. PMS2) and
their orthologs from the majority of bacteria, the nuclease
activity is in the same polypeptide, supplied by a module
C-terminal to the S5 domain [15]. This module has a
metal-binding nuclease catalytic site in a unique 4stranded α+β domain into which a KH domain is inserted
after the 3rd strand to form a composite nucleic acid interacting surface. Topoisomerase activity is often combined
with the action of DNA helicases, and in some cases like
the reverse gyrase the two modules are combined into a
single polypeptide. In bacteria like E. coli, MutL physically
interacts with the DNA helicase UvrD which unwinds
DNA starting from the site of nick to initiate degradation
of the strand with the mismatch [16]. In the case of bacterial MMR and VSR the discrimination of the correct template strand is brought about by means of an epigenetic
mark of cytosine hemimethylation [17,18]. This functional association is again reminiscent of the association
of the MORCs and paraMORCs with methyltransferases
(including those mediating hemimethylation like Type III
RM systems [8]).

Thus, in conclusion the paraMORC1-5 families appear to
define a group of GHKL proteins that are likely to possess

In mechanistic terms, the GHKL+S5 modules of both
topoisomerases and MutLs constitute engines that use

ATP hydrolysis to drive alterations in protein-protein
interactions in the complexes they are part of, as well as
mediate large movements of DNA strands – topoisomerization and looping of DNA between the epigenetic marks
and mismatch sites [17]. Based on these models we propose that the MORCs and the paraMORCs in the RM operons are similarly involved in DNA looping, probably
linking the site of endonucleolytic cleavage with the recognition site of the restriction enzyme. Associated DNA
helicases probably contribute to the unwinding of the
DNA starting at the sites of the nicks. This mechanistic
interpretation of the prokaryotic MORCs and paraMORCs
also furnishes functional predictions regarding the
eukaryotic MORCs. Firstly, the presence of a distinct
ancient eukaryotic lineage with a fusion of the MORC
GHKL+S5 module to hinge and coiled-coil domains also
found in SMC-like ATPases suggests that they might function as analogous chromosome looping enzymes [5]. Secondly, the genetic link to the meiotic endonuclease
Spo11, the archaeal Topo VI ortholog, suggests that at
least MORC1 might function in combination with this
protein in DNA strand manipulation during meiotic
recombination [2]. Several of the domains linked to the
MORC module in eukaryotic polypeptides, such as the
Bromo, Bromo-associated motif (BAM), PHDX/ZfCW
and the TAM/MBD are known or predicted to bind potential epigenetic markers in chromatin such as modified histone tails and methylated DNA [5,19]. Thus, like their
prokaryotic equivalents the eukaryotic MORCs might
respond to these epigenetic signals to catalyze alterations
in chromosome superstructure.
In evolutionary terms, the association between nucleases
and the GHKL+S5 module is an ancient one with at least
two representatives in the topoisomerases traceable to the
last universal common ancestor. MutL in contrast appears
to be bacterial innovation. Given the similarities between
the MORCs and paraMORCs from RM systems on one
hand and MutL in MMR and VSR on the other, it appears
likely that these systems arose early in bacterial evolution
from an ancestral version that functionally united GHKL
ATPases, nucleases and helicases. The latter seems to have
acquired a key DNA repair role early in bacterial evolution, in conjunction with the mismatch recognizing ABC
ATPase MutS, resulting in them being fixed in the bacterial
superkingdom. The former group like all RM systems was
highly laterally mobile. This is also supported by a survey
of their chromosomal locations, which suggests that they
behave like transposable elements integrating in
"hotspots" that contain other mobile elements [Additional file 1]. However, on a few occasions they might
have been recruited for some form of DNA mismatch
repair as suggested by the versions which occur in non-RM
contexts. This can be compared to the recruitment of the
restriction enzyme MutH to the MMR system in proteo-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/8

bacteria with the concomitant degeneration of the endogenous nuclease of MutL. Finally, the greater diversity of
these RM system-associated MORCs and paraMORCs in
bacteria suggests that eukaryotes acquired them in a single
lateral transfer event from a bacterial source. Following,
this transfer, their ancestral properties in responding to
epigenetic signals like DNA methylation appear to have
been reused in contexts unique to the eukaryotic chromatin. Thus, MORCs join a growing group of eukaryotic
chromatin-modifying enzymes, such as DNA methylases,
SWI/SNF ATPases and the HIRAN domain that might
have emerged from RM systems and other comparable
mobile DNA elements of bacteria [5,20].

Materials and methods
Gene neighborhoods were determined using a custom
script that uses completely sequenced genomes or whole
genome shot gun sequences to derive a table of gene
neighbors centered on a query gene. Then the BLASTCLUST program is used to cluster the products in the
neighborhood and establish conserved co-occurring
genes. These conserved gene neighborhood are then
sorted as per a ranking scheme based on occurrence in at
least one other phylogenetically distinct lineage ("phylum" in NCBI Taxonomy database), complete conservation in a particular lineage ("phylum") and physical
closeness on the chromosome indicating sharing of regulatory -10 and -35 elements. For obtaining an approximate probability of the neighborhood associations we
chose 11 phylogenetically distinct genomes that contained MORC proteins and reconstituted 10,000 replicates of "pseudo-genomes" of the same size by shuffling
their combined gene-pool. We introduced the constraint
that each such genome possessed at least 1 MORC and 10
SFII helicases. The probability of association between
MORCs and other genes in the neighborhoods by chance
was derived from the observed co-occurrence in the
pseudo-genome replicates. Profile searches were conducted using the PSI-BLAST program with either a single
sequence or an alignment used as the query, with a default
profile inclusion expectation (E) value threshold of 0.01
[21]. Multiple alignments were constructed using the
PCMA and Kalign programs followed by manual adjustments based on PSI-BLAST results. Protein secondary
structure was predicted using a multiple alignment as the
input for the JPRED program. Phylogenetic trees were
constructed with the MEGA4 package [22].

1. Par. 2: "This is suggestive of extensive lateral transfer of
these genes between diverse prokaryotes." This sporadic distribution is equally suggestive of extensive gene loss in many lineages. In order to argue for lateral transfer in earnest, either
make a quantitative argument that involves the number of
branches, their topology, and gene gain-to-loss ratio, or present
case studies of gene tree and species tree incongruency (the
same type of statement is at the end of par.6, the same criticism). In the concluding paragraph, there are some auxiliary
considerations lending support to the LGT scenario, but they
perhaps need to be brought up earlier.
Authors' response
A phylogenetic tree of the MORC ATPases is provided as
supplementary material [7]. The tree recovers the various
MORC families defined in the text. Further, within each
family, the protein tree is very different from the bacterial
species tree (i.e. the predominant phylogenetic signal in
the bacterial genomes). This is even seen in the case of
MORC proteins from closely related species. For example,
within the classical bacterial MORCs, the proteobacterial
homologs do not specifically cluster together to the exclusion of other bacterial groups. Thus extensive lateral transfer between diverse prokaryotic species is the best
explanation of this data.

2. Par. 3–5: "Consequently, we uncovered several types of predicted operons encoding MORC proteins (Fig. 2). A consistent
theme in majority of these predicted gene-neighborhoods was
the presence of a gene encoding a superfamily II (SFII) helicase." – it would not hurt to make this and similar following
statements more quantitative. What is a definition of the neighborhood? Most prokaryotes have perhaps at least 10–15 helicases; with roughly half of them being SFII and taking the
"neighborhood" size to be 10 genes, we can estimate that perhaps 3% of all genes have an SFII helicase nearby. How many
MORCs have a helicase in the neighborhood, how many do not
have one? Is the probability of a MORC having a helicase
nearby higher than that of a random gene (and is perhaps a
probability of not having one lower than of a random gene)?
Helicase/nuclease tandems and fusions are common in all
genomes – are nucleases in the same neighborhood more likely
to be found than would be predicted solely by their association
with helicases? Materials and methods hint at some sort of justification, i.e. the use of conserved orthologous pairs, but there
is no reference to BLASTCLUST nor explaination of what is
measured by the program.
Authors' response
We do not dispute the estimate of the percentage of genes
of having a SF-II helicase in the vicinity, but the available
evidence suggests that the associations reported here are
not artefacts of chance association followed by retention
due to phylogenetic closeness. We evaluated the probability of the associations of MORC and SFII proteins by a

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/8

computational experiment of generating "pseudogenomes". We chose 11 phylogenetically distinct
genomes that contained MORC proteins and reconstituted 10,000 replicates of "pseudo-genomes" of the same
size by shuffling their combined gene-pool. We introduced the constraint that each such genome possessed at
least 1 MORC and 10 SFII helicases (based on real mean
number of detected SFIIs). The probability of association
between MORCs and other genes in the neighborhoods
by chance was derived from the observed co-occurrence in
the pseudo-genome replicates. The probability of observing a MORC next to any SFII in at least 7 of the genomes
(~70% of genomes in the real data show the MORC-SFII
linkage) was <.0001. This probability reduces further if
introduce the realistic constraint that the SFII helicases
should belong to one of the 3 observed families.
3. Par. 6 and Fig. 2C: Is the network shown on Fig. 2C a union
of all interactions/relationships inferred for individual MORC
proteins and SFII helicases that co-occur with them? In other
words, does any given MORC or paraMORC have relationships
to only a small subset of all other proteins in the chart? If the
answer is yes, perhaps it is worth explaining what the chart is
supposed to convey.
Authors' response
The contextual information graph reflects the union of all
interactions between members of the GHKL family of proteins that are fused to an S5 (a subset of which include the
MORCs) and other domains/proteins. The graph highlights the major contextual themes that are consistently
seen with these proteins even if the actual domains belong
to different sequence or structural families. Thus, distinct
chromatin associated domains are colored yellow, diverse
nucleases in pink and distinct ATPases in blue. (See figure
legend).

4. Par. 8. "This might imply that these members of the
paraMORC3 family might have acquired distinct functions
independent of the RM systems." – Does this imply it or not?
Do those species that have a standalone versions of
paraMORC3 also have (unlinked) orthologs of the R-M genes
that are linked in other species? If the answer is yes, then the
neighborhood may be split, but the system is still there, perhaps
even co-regulated?
Authors' response
In principle, it is definitely possible and perhaps true for a
small set of the species that these paraMORC3s function
with an RM system, that is co-regulated and at an
unlinked location in the genome. However, for most of
these species, we failed to detect any solo R-M systems like
those associated with other MORC families in these species thereby leading us to speculate about the evolution of

a distinct function. We have changed the sentence to
accommodate the former possibility.

1. Introduction "being present in most major crown group lineages". The use of the term crown group is not fortunate in this
sense (i.e. excluding apicomplexans etc. that are also descendants of the last common eukaryotic ancestor = crown group).
Authors' response
We agree that with the above phylogenetic definition of
the term crown group we would be excluding many
eukaryotes. However, crown group has also been defined
as: "All the taxa descended from a major cladogenesis
event, recognized by possessing the clade's synapomorphy"
(see
http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/
gloss1phylo.html). Several phylogenetic analyses strongly
support the monophyly of animals, plants, fungi and
amoebozoans with respect to the other eukaryotes. Hence
we use the term in the sense mentioned above for this
group of lineages. We used this term to emphasize the loss
of the MORC proteins in the fungi.

2. The authors propose that the eukaryotic MORC family came
from eubacteria and not archaebacteria where MORCs are also
present. I think diversity alone is not too strong support for this.
Authors' response
We provide a phylogenetic analysis of the MORCs and
related ATPases in the supplementary material. In our survey we only detected three archaeal MORC proteins. Further, the phylogenetic tree shows that the archaeal
versions are not specifically closer to the eukaryotic
MORCs, but instead group with different bacterial versions. This is suggestive of lateral acquisition of the
archaeal and eukaryotic MORCs from bacterial homologs.
