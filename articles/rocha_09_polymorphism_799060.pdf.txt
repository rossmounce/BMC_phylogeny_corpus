Abstract
Background: Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a thermo-dimorphic fungus that causes
paracoccidiodomycosis (PCM). Glycoprotein gp43 is the fungal main diagnostic antigen, which can
also protect against murine PCM and interact with extracellular matrix proteins. It is structurally
related to glucanases, however not active, and whose expression varies considerably. We have
presently studied polymorphisms in the PbGP43 flanking regions to help understand such variations.
Results: we tested the protein-binding capacity of oligonucleotides covering the PbGP43 proximal
5' flanking region, including overlap and mutated probes. We used electrophoretic mobility shift
assays and found DNA binding regions between positions -134 to -103 and -255 to -215. Only
mutation at -230, characteristic of P. brasiliensis phylogenetic species PS2, altered binding affinity.
Next, we cloned and sequenced the 5' intergenic region up to position -2,047 from P. brasiliensis
Pb339 and observed that it is composed of three tandem repetitive regions of about 500 bp
preceded upstream by 442 bp. Correspondent PCR fragments of about 2,000 bp were found in
eight out of fourteen isolates; in PS2 samples they were 1,500-bp long due to the absence of one
repetitive region, as detected in Pb3. We also compared fifty-six PbGP43 3' UTR sequences from
ten isolates and have not observed polymorphisms; however we detected two main poly(A)
clusters (1,420 to 1,441 and 1,451 to 1,457) of multiple cleavage sites. In a single isolate we found
one to seven sites.
Conclusions: We observed that the amount of PbGP43 transcripts accumulated in P. brasiliensis
Pb339 grown in defined medium was about 1,000-fold higher than in Pb18 and 120-fold higher than
in Pb3. We have described a series of features in the gene flanking regions and differences among
isolates, including DNA-binding sequences, which might impact gene regulation. Little is known
about regulatory sequences in thermo-dimorphic fungi. The peculiar structure of tandem repetitive
fragments in the 5' intergenic region of PbGP43, their characteristic sequences, besides the
presence of multiple poly(A) cleavage sites in the 3' UTR will certainly guide future studies.

Background
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a thermo-dimorphic pathogenic fungus. It causes paracoccidiodomycosis (PCM) in
man, which is an endemic mycosis in Latin America that
affects mostly the lungs, but can disseminate to other
organs [1]. P. brasiliensis is multinucleated in both pathogenic yeast and infectious mycelial phases. Genetic transformation in the species has recently been optimized [2],
however genetic manipulation is still in its infancy. It is
now recognized that most P. brasiliensis isolates diversified
into an S1 main species, which is genetically close to the
PS3 group of Colombian isolates, while PS2 is composed
of a few isolates that constitute a phylogenetically cryptic
species [3].
Gp43 is the main diagnostic and prognostic antigen so far
characterized in P. brasiliensis [4,5]. It is a secretory glycoprotein whose peptide structure bears antigenic properties
that are peculiar to the species [6]. Therefore, it confers
high levels of sensitivity and specificity for PCM patients'
sera when used as antigen in diagnostic tests such as
immunodiffusion and capture ELISA, as well as by antigen
detection in biological fluids [7]. Antibody titers are
directly proportional to the severity of active PCM; they
are probably not protective in advanced stages of the disease, but experimental protocols in mice point to the
immunotherapeutic potential of anti-gp43 monoclonal
antibodies [8]. On the other hand, gp43 contains T cell
epitopes that are protective to vaccinated mice [5]. The
best studied T-cell epitope is 15 aminoacid-long P-10,
which showed additive effect in the treatment of murine
PCM when administered with anti-fungal agents [9]. In
addition, gp43 has adhesive properties to extracellular
matrix proteins that may help fungal dissemination
[10,11].
The complete PbGP43 ORF has originally been found in a
cloned 3,800-bp EcoRI genomic region from the Pb339
(B-339) isolate. It comprises 1,329 bp that contain a
unique 78-bp intron [12]. The EcoRI genomic fragment
includes 326 bp from the PbGP43 5' intergenic proximal
region and about 500 bp of the 3' intergenic sequence,
which is shared by a neighboring RanBP homologue. This
gene encodes a nuclear Ran-binding protein in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, or importin 11 in Aspergillus fumigatus,
that transports ribosomal proteins to the nucleus [13].
PbGP43 and PbRanBP are linked in twelve P. brasiliensis
isolates, as observed by Feitosa et al. [14].
Our group has carried out original and detailed studies on
sequence polymorphism in the PbGP43 ORF [15] and 5'
intergenic proximal region [16], which defined at least
five genotypes [17]. When compared to a consensus
sequence, the most polymorphic A genotype carries three
substitutions in the 5' intergenic proximal region and up
to fifteen informative sites in the ORF, mostly concen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/277

trated in exon 2. So far, the A genotype has been detected
in all six PS2 isolates [3]. It is of note that PbGP43 was the
most polymorphic gene in the multilocus analysis performed by Matute et al. [3] in P. brasiliensis. Isolates Pb2,
Pb3 and Pb4, which belong in PS2 group [3], evoked
milder experimental PCM in B10. A mice than representative isolates from the main species S1, including Pb18
[16]. This isolate has been long used in experimental PCM
due to its high virulence.
P. brasiliensis Pb339 has traditionally been employed in
antigen preparation [18]. It secretes high amounts of
gp43, however that is not a rule among isolates [19]. The
amount of gp43 accumulated in the extracellular fluids of
a single isolate also varies with incubation time, culture
medium, fungal phase, as well as with multiple sub-culturing after animal passage. In yeast-phase Pb339, extracellular gp43 decreases through late-log and stationary
phases [18,20], when the culture pH tends to be basic
[21]. Expression regulation of gp43 is only beginning to
be unrevealed. Previous data from our group suggested
that PbGP43 suffers transcriptional regulation, but we
showed that modulation at protein and secretion levels
might also happen [16]. Besides, transcriptional response
of Pb3 isolate to heat shock differed from others belonging to P. brasiliensis S1 group, suggesting that differences
in PbGP43 transcriptional regulation are likely to occur
among isolates [16]. On the other hand, we have recently
mapped NIT2-like binding motifs in the PbGP43 5' intergenic region and described transcription modulation with
nitrogen primary sources. In that case, the degree of modulation was similar among different isolates [22].
Differences in gp43 expression could be related to differences in transcription regulation due to genetic polymorphisms in the PbGP43 flanking regions. In the present
work, we found protein binding sequences in the proximal PbGP43 5' flanking fragment and studied the effect of
substitution sites; we characterized an extended 5' intergenic region up to 2,047 bp from Pb339 in comparison
with other isolates and recognized some peculiar
sequence organization. In addition, we studied polymorphism in the 3' UTR and polyadenylation cleavage site of
the PbGP43 transcript. Accumulation of PbGP43 transcripts was much higher in Pb339 than in Pb18 and Pb3,
however they were similarly modulated with glucose. The
differences we presently found in the Pb339 5' intergenic
region might help understand the features involved in differences of PbGP43 transcriptional regulation.

Results
Search for DNA binding regions in the proximal PbGP43 5'
flanking region
In order to find protein binding sites within the proximal
5' flanking region of the PbGP43 gene cloned by Cisalpino et al. [12] we carried out EMSA using total protein

extracts of P. brasiliensis and selected oligonucleotides
(Table 1). Selection was based on the search for transcription factors using the TFSearch program (Figure 1) and
DNAse I protection footprinting assays (data not shown),
as established in our previous works [22,23]. We were
aware of the incomplete type of information that transcription factor search programs could provide; however
that was the strategy of choice to start our analysis. We
were particularly interested to find DNA binding
sequences in polymorphic regions.
The first set of probes tested by EMSA included Bs2, Bs8.1,
Bs8.1Δ, Bs8.2Δ and Bs10 (Figure 1, Table 1). Bs2 and Bs10
resulted negative (data not shown), while the overlapping
oligonucleotides Bs8.1, Bs8.1Δ and Bs8.2Δ (nt -134 to 103) formed intense shifted bands that were specifically
inhibited with 100-fold excess of cold homologous
probes, suggesting specificity (Figure 2A). Oligonucleotides Bs8.1Δ and Bs8.2Δ (nt -134 to -113) included substitutions at positions -120 (T/A) and/or -104 (C/G) that
are characteristic of P. brasiliensis isolates belonging to
phylogenetic species PS2, which is presently represented
by Pb3 [3,15]. However, these substitutions did not seem
to alter the intensity of protein binding (Figure 2A). In
addition, probes Bs8.1, Bs8.1Δ and Bs8.2Δ cross-competed (Figure 2B). The Bs8.1, Bs8.1Δ and Bs8.2Δ complexes migrated similarly and the probes are similar in
size (22 and 24 mer), suggesting binding to the same protein. Therefore, our results point to a protein binding core
in the overlapping sequence TGCAGAA/TTTATCAA. Alternatively, all the probes are competing for distinct Sox-5like protein binding sites (Figure 1). It is necessary to
point out, however, that all the interpretations drawn
from EMSA using total protein extracts will only possibly
be confirmed by using either purified transcription factors
or specific antibodies in super-shift experiments, considering that differences in shifts could be evoked by the
same protein, while similar migrations could alternatively
be the result of different transcription factors.
The next set of probes tested by EMSA included Et12,
Et23, Et23Δ, Et4 and Et5 (Figure 1, Table 1). We tested

these regions based on apparent protection in DNAse I
protection footprinting assays (data not shown). In
EMSA, probes Et4 and Et5 formed only weak and unspecific complexes with P. brasiliensis total protein extracts
(data not shown), although these regions are rich in predicted transcription elements (Figure 1). We also tested an
Et4 variant that had five extra upstream nucleotides.
EMSA results were still negative, suggesting that the NIT2
motif predicted in this probe (Figure 1) is not functional.
Overlapping Et12 and Et23 oligonucleotides (nt -255 to 215) formed intense complexes that co-migrated and
could be specifically inhibited with 100-fold excess of
cold homologous probe (Figure 3A). In cross-competition
EMSA experiments, cold Et23 strongly competed with
Et12, preventing band shift with as little as 100-fold molar
excess. Cold Et12 was a weaker competitor to Et23 binding, since a noticeable decrease in band intensity
demanded 500-fold molar excess of Et12 (Figure 3B). The
results with Pb18 extracts presented in Figures 3A and 3B
were similar with extracts from Pb339 and Pb3 (data not
shown), suggesting that the same protein in each isolate
binds to both probes; however affinity for Et23 is possibly
higher. Therefore, a DNA binding motif might include the
overlapping region from nt -243 to -229 (CTGTTGATCTTTT), for which there are no motifs recognized by
the TFsearch computer program (Figure 1). We also
designed an Et23Δ probe to verify the influence in EMSA
of substitution at -230 (C/A). We initially noticed that the
Et23Δ band was reproducibly less intense than the Et23
band when assayed with protein extracts from Pb18 (Figure 3C) and Pb339 (data not shown), but equally intense
with Pb3 extracts (Figure 3C). In terms of competition
with the Et12 complex, Et23Δ was as good a competitor as
Et23, while cold Et12 could apparently inhibit band formation with Et23Δ more effectively than with Et23 (Figure 3D). Therefore, a C (instead of an A) at position -230
seems to be important for stronger Pb18 protein binding
to Et23.
Figure 3E shows the Et12 and Et23 bands obtained with
protein extracts from Pb18, Pb339 and Pb3 comparatively
in the same radioautogram. It is noticeable that while the
bands migrated similarly for each individual isolate, the
Pb3 bands (both Et12 and Et23) migrated faster. It is
worth mentioning that we observed similar behavior with
Bs8.1Δ, which was also positive in EMSA with protein
extracts from Pb18 and Pb3; the shifted band migrated
similarly for Pb18 and Pb339, but faster for Pb3 (data not
shown). Bs8.1 and Bs8.2Δ were only assayed with Pb339
extracts.
Manual search through the PbGP43 promoter region
revealed the existence of two CreA-like DNA binding
motifs (C/GC/TGGA/GG), whose sequences (CTGGTG

(Figure 1, Table 1). CreA is a zinc-finger catabolic repressor in A. nidulans [24] and we tested the probes with
Pb339 extracts. We obtained an intense EMSA-positive
band with Et7 that could only be removed with a 3,000fold molar excess of cold oligonucleotide, suggesting lack
of specificity (data not shown). Et6 formed only a faint
band that disappeared upon competition with 250-fold
molar excess of cold probe (data not shown).
Analysis of 2,047 bp from the PbGP43 5' flanking region
In our laboratory, we had long been trying to clone an
extended fragment of the 5' intergenic region of the
PbGP43 gene using different methods and Pb339 as reference isolate. Recently, we have finally managed to
increase sequence information of this region to -2,047 bp
(as detailed in Methods), which prompted us to search for
length polymorphism in other isolates (Figures 4A). In

order to do that, we compared PCR fragments amplified
with P4 (forward) and GRN (reverse) primers (Figures 4B)
and DNA template from 14 isolates (as coded in [15]).
Note that amplicons from Pb2, Pb3, Pb4 and Pb5 had
similar sizes of around 1,500 bp; amplicons from Pb9 and
Pb17 were around 3,000 bp, while those from Pb6, Pb8,
Pb10, Pb11, Pb14, Pb16 and Pb18 were similar to the
original Pb339 fragment migrating at about 2,000 bp.
We next sequenced the Pb3 shorter PCR product; at a similar time frame the P. brasiliensis genome from isolates
Pb3, Pb18 and Pb01 was released http://
www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/
paracoccidioides_brasiliensis/MultiHome.html. Therefore, we had a chance to compare our sequences with
those analyzed by the Broad Institute and the results are
summarized in Figure 4.

was suggested by effective competition with 100 × molar
excess of cold homologous probe. In B, cross-competition

competitors was 100 ×. The position of shifted bands is indicated with arrows.

We detected in Pb339 the presence of three consecutive
repetitive regions: 1a (-652 to -156), 1b (-1159 to -653)
and 1c (-1600 to -1158), which are about 500-bp long
(Figure 4B). Two of the regions have initially been
detected due to the difficulties to arrange the contigs generated through primer walking sequencing. A middle similar region has only been revealed very recently after
further analysis of the data during preparation of this
manuscript. The 1c region lacks an initial 58-bp fragment
upstream (here referred to as "connector"), which is identical in 1a and 1b (Figure 4C). In Pb339, identities
between regions are 89% (1a × 1b), 79% (1a × 1c) and
90% (1b × 1c). In Pb18, the structure and sequence of the
PbGP43 5' flanking region (2,047 bp) are quite similar to
those in Pb339. Sequence identities are also high when
comparing the same regions between Pb339 and Pb18:
99% (1a), 95% (1b) and 97% (1c). Pb3 lacks one repetitive region: 1a in Pb3 is 96% identical to 1a in Pb339,
while 1c/a/b carries nucleotides characteristic of the three
regions, however the level of identity is higher with 1c
(94%) than with 1b (87%) or 1a (78%). Therefore, when
sequence alignments of the repetitive regions from Pb339,
Pb18 and Pb3 were compared in a dendrogram, there
were two main clusters, one with 1a sequences and
another branching into 1b and 1c (and 1c/a/b) regions
(data not shown). Pb3 sequences formed individual
branches, in accordance with the phylogenetically distinct
nature of this isolate detected with PbGP43 gene and
other loci [3,15]. The 442-bp upstream fragment is highly
divergent from the repetitive regions, but conserved
among isolates (about 99% identity).
The highly conserved nature of the connector (Figure 4C)
drove our attention to a more detailed analysis of its con-

tents. We observed that some oligonucleotide sequences
occur exclusively in the connectors, while others can be
found in other positions of the repetitive regions. In Figure 4C, we boxed six sequences (6- to 8-bp long) that can
be found in the positions represented in Figure 4B by
color-coded arrowheads or bars. Note that the blue oligonucleotide (TTTTCAAG) was invariably found 44 bp
upstream of the last base of all repetitive regions. The purple sequence (ATGAAAT) localized 109 bp downstream of
the first base of the connector in the three isolates considered; therefore this sequence is not seen in 1c (or 1c/b/a)
region. The gray sequence TTGATA in the connector could
also be seen in 1b region at -883 (Pb339) and -1006
(Pb3). The green ATGTTA oligonucleotide was detected at
-1756 (Pb339 and Pb18) and -1261 (Pb3) and at -268 in
all isolates. The orange TATAGA was found exclusively in
Pb18 and Pb339 at distances of 186 and 184 bp from the
start base of 1a and 1b regions. The red-coded corresponding mutated sequence in Pb3 (TTATTGAT) was also
detected 238 bp upstream of the last base in 1c/b/a region;
it is not present in Pb18 or Pb339 connector, but it could
be detected at distances varying among 237, 234 and 229
bp upstream of regions 1a, 1b and 1c last bases.
The brown CTTATTT initial connector sequence was
observed only once in 1a region, 67 bp upstream of the
last base in Pb339 and Pb18. Although this exact
sequence is not observed in the Pb3 connector, which
shows a unique CTTCATT oligonucleotide not found elsewhere, in this isolate CTTATTT has been observed twice in
1a region, at 67 bp upstream of the last base, and at a polymorphic -372 site. As seen in Figure 4D, CTTATTT is seen
in protein-binding oligonucleotide Et23 (Figure 3), near
the overlapped fragment with Et12. The Et12/23 fragment
in 1a region is particularly polymorphic when compared
to the correspondent sequences in 1b and 1c; it is one of
the fingerprints of 1a region. In 1b and 1c regions, this
fragment has several putative transcription motifs, as
opposed to Et12/Et23 (Figure 1), however we have not
tested their protein binding features.
Polymorphism in the 3' UTR of PbGP43
We compared the 3' UTR of the PbGP43 gene by analyzing
3' RACE products from ten isolates. We used total RNA as
template, which has been purified from P. brasiliensis yeast
phase grown in rich medium (exception: Pb18, for which
the mycelium phase was used). We sequenced the inserts
of four to ten clones from each isolate and compared the
poly(A) cleavage sites. In our hands, the 3' UTR was conserved intra and inter individuals, i.e., we have not found
substitutions in all the 56 fragments sequenced (exception: site 1418 in a single clone from Pb14); however
there was extensive polymorphism in the poly(A) cleavage site. Out of 56 transcripts we found thirteen close,
however different poly(A) sites, which varied in number
from one to seven per isolate (Table 2). These sites were

from the stop codon, see inset in Table 2) and were mostly

most common sites were 1423 (14 transcripts) and 1434
(10 transcripts).
Total RNA pools (isolated from cells cultivated in rich
medium) used as template in the 3' RACE reactions were
also analyzed for PbGP43 expression using real time RTPCR. The amount of accumulated transcript varied considerably among isolates (data not shown), from not
detected (Pb2, Pb3, and Pb8) to highly abundant (Pb339,
followed by Pb10) or low (Pb4, Pb12, Pb14, Pb18). There

Comparative analysis of PbGP43 transcription
Differences in extracellular gp43 expression among different isolates have been reported in the literature [19] and
constantly observed in our laboratory. We have previously
suggested that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms would contribute to these differences
[16]. Presently, we used Pb339, Pb3 and Pb18 in a controlled comparison of transcript accumulation in yeast
cells cultivated to logarithmic phase in defined F12/glc
medium. At similar cell concentrations for each culture,
transcript accumulation was by far higher in Pb339, followed by Pb3 and Pb18 (Table 3). We have observed that
differences were not apparent upon modulation with primary nitrogen sources, i.e., PbGP43 transcript from Pb3,
Pb18 and Pb339 were negatively modulated with ammonium sulfate at similar rates [22]. We presently tested two
other types of stimuli in cultures growing in F12 medium,
specifically, fetal calf serum (FCS) and glucose. As
observed in Figure 5, supplementation with 2% FCS was
not able to modulate PbGP43 transcript accumulation in
30 min. On the other hand, an increase in glucose concentration from 0.18% (present in F12 medium) to 1.5% for
30 min evoked a decrease in the relative amount of transcripts of about 70% (2,6-fold for Pb3, 4-fold for Pb18
and 3,5-fold for Pb339). This rate of modulation was similar in Pb339, Pb3 and Pb18, although the initial amount
of transcripts varied considerably among them. This kind
of negative expression modulation with glucose would be
expected for glucanase genes [26].

Discussion
By using EMSA and a series of probes covering five regions
within the upstream 326 bp of the PbGP43 ORF we managed to identify protein binding sequences between nt 134 to -103 and nt -255 to -215. Together, these regions
abrogate three substitution sites characteristic of P. brasiliensis PS2 isolates: that might not be incidental, since one
mutation at -230 seemed to alter binding affinity. By
using cross-competition assays with overlapping and
mutated probes we suggested binding cores located
between nt -125/-112 (TGCAGAA/TTTATCAA) and nt 243/-229 (CTGTTGATCTTTT). Fragment -125/-112 bears
putative NIT2 and CdxA binding sites, whereas oligonucleotide from -243 to -229 could be involved in binding
to a so far unknown protein. NIT2 modulates transcription of genes that encode enzymes involved in the catabolism of nitrogen sources during starvation [27]. We have
recently studied PbGP43 NIT2-binding sites and shown
transcription modulation of the PbGP43 with primary
nitrogen sources; however the participation of a NIT2
transcription factor binding to the putative motifs at -179,
-117 and -73 was unlikely [22]. The core sequence of

Figure 4 2,047 bp upstream of the PbGP43 ORF
Analysis of
Analysis of 2,047 bp upstream of the PbGP43 ORF. A, Size comparison of the PbGP43 5' flanking region from fourteen
P. brasiliensis isolates. Ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel showing the amplicons produced with P4 (forward) and GRN
(reverse) primers using genomic DNA from the indicated isolates. M, molecular markers. B, schematic representation of the
PbGP43 5' flanking region from isolates Pb339/Pb18 and Pb3, where the positions of P4/GRN primers are shown. The repeated
regions are boxed and start at the dark gray bar. The lighter-colored box indicates a 58-bp sequence ("connector", shown in
C) that is absent in the upstream repeated region 1c and 1c/a/b. The sequences in the color-coded boxes can be found in the
sites indicated in B by the correspondent colored arrow. D, sequence alignment of the Et12/Et23 probes (-255 to -215 in 1a
region) with the correspondent fragments in other regions from Pb3, Pb18 and Pb339, as indicated. The overlap between these
probes is indicated, as well as one of the connector sequences (brown) boxed in C.
CdxA-binding element is A/TA/TTA/TA/CTA/G [28], thus
allowing for several sequence possibilities. That probably
explains why CdxA is one of the most frequently found
promoter elements in human genes [29]. Transcription
factor CdxA is a homeodomain protein originally
described in the early stages of morphogenesis of chicken
intestinal tract [30], but its role on regulation of fungal
genes has apparently not been addressed. The P. brasiliensis genome does not show any protein with high identities
with CdxA, although other homeobox proteins have been

annotated. On the other hand, there is a slight similarity
of P. brasiliensis proteins with Sox-5, whose DNA-binding
motif is seen in non-overlapping fragments of the probes
covering sequence form -134 and -103.
To date, we have not been able to purify and identify the
DNA-binding proteins detected here. The probes tested
are located close to PbGP43 transcription start sites and
we understand from our previous work that the first -480
bp were sufficient to promote basal levels of gene tranPage 7 of 13

scription and also modulation with ammonium sulfate
[22]. This fragment contains most of 1a region. When we
blasted the overlap -125/-112 (14-mer) and -243/-229
(13-mer) oligonucleotides from EMSA-positive fragments
with P. brasiliensis upstream intergenic regions http://
www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/
paracoccidioides_brasiliensis/MultiHome.html,
exact
matches were found generally at the 11-mer level in about
20 to 30 genes. Sequence CTGTTGATCTTTT has been
found in P. brasiliensis homologous genes encoding betahexosaminidase and chitin synthase, but mostly in genes
encoding predicted or hypothetical proteins. Concerning
the mutated -125/-112 region, we detected identical fragments in the upstream region of one gene encoding betaglucosidase. Therefore, although gp43 is a non-functional
β-1,3-exoglucanase, its gene may have conserved transcription motifs characteristic of those related to carbohydrate metabolism, possibly within the binding sequences
identified here. We presently showed negative modulation with glucose of PbGP43 from Pb3, Pb18 and Pb339
at similar rates, but the participation of the binding DNA

sequences revealed here in this or other modulations is
presently unknown and will have to be addressed using
gene reporter experiments.
Basal levels of PbGP43 transcripts varied considerably
among isolates (Table 3) corroborating differences
observed at extracellular protein levels [19]. By comparing
length polymorphism of PbGP43 upstream sequences we
observed some correlation with P. brasiliensis phylogenetic group PS2 isolates, since DNA from Pb2, Pb3 and
Pb4 yielded a similarly shorter amplicon of about 1,500
bp. However amplicon from Pb5 (S1 group [3] and
PbGP43 genotype D [17]) was also about this size. P. brasiliensis isolates representative of S1 group and PbGP43
genotypes C, D, and E [17] resulted in amplification of a
2,000 bp-fragment, but exceptions of longer fragments
were observed in Pb9 and Pb17 (S1, genotype E). It is possible that these isolates bear a forth repetitive region. We
noticed that although the accumulated PbGP43 transcripts in Pb339 can be as high as about 1,000-fold that of
Pb18 (Table 2), this difference can not be justified by

missing sequences within -2,047 to -1. In addition, even
though there is one region missing in Pb3, accumulated
PbGP43 transcripts were only 129-fold less abundant than
in Pb339. Therefore, the relevance of repetitive regions
will be better investigated at the level of polymorphisms
to explain transcription differences; however the influence
of mRNA stability and 3' regulators should not be disregarded. Additionally, differences at the level of RNA
processing should be better investigated. Several studies
point to intraspecies divergence in gene expression related
to mutations in cis-regulatory elements, such as in Cyp6g
1 (the cytochrome P450 family) from Drosophila melanogaster [31]. Changes in cis-regulatory systems of genes
more often underlie the evolution of morphological
diversity than do changes in gene number or protein function [32]. Cis-regulatory sequences are more susceptible to
mutations; therefore long intergenic regions should accumulate them during evolution. It was surprising, however,
to find highly conserved sequences among isolates
upstream of the repetitive regions in the 5' intergenic
region of PbGP43.
We believe that the quite special arrangements detected in
the 5' intergenic region of PbGP43 are not at all incidental, however we can not precise their role at present. In
addition, when we blasted the whole Pb339 connector
sequence (58 bp) against other dimorphic fungal
sequences
http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/
genome/dimorph_collab.1/MultiHome.html we realized
that fragments of fifteen to thirteen bp or even longer (17
bp) are conserved in the 5' upstream regions from other
genes, although mostly from predicted or hypothetical
proteins. This specific search resulted in, for e.g., six
matches with sequences from Pb18, three from Pb3,
thirty-three from Pb01 and 13 from H. capsulatum. The
sequence TTCAAGGTTTTGATAGTTATAG, including the
blue and gray fragments (Figure 4C) was detected in the
uracil DNA glycosidase superfamily from H. capsulatum

H143; TATTTGAGGTATTTTCAA, including the brown
and blue fragments (Figure 4C) was seen upstream of the
acid phosphatase gene in the same isolate and part of it
(ATTTGAGGTATTTT) was also found upstream of a
reduced viability upon starvation protein in Pb18.
Another fragment containing the red and pink sequences
(Figure 4C) (TTATAGATGTCATGAAAT) is upstream of
the MAP kinase gene in H. capsulatum H88.
Isolate Pb01 probably belongs to a different Paracoccidioides species whose proposed name is P. lutzii [33,34]. In
this isolate, the gene homologue to PbGP43 shows extensive polymorphism in the ORF, bearing only 80% identity
with gp43 from Pb18. The predicted protein (PAAG
05770.1) does not have any N-glycosylation site, mutated
NEP, or conserved P10, therefore it is a potentially active
glucanase. The 5' intergenic region is reduced to about
990 bp, when the first exon from a gene homologous to
that encoding succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase
starts. In this fragment, we could observe one region that
aligns with 1a, 1b and 1c regions, however with many
divergences and two long gaps. Therefore, the transcripts
are probably regulated differently, but there are no experimental data available to confirm that.
Protein binding probes were positive in EMSA carried out
with total protein extracts from Pb339, Pb18 and Pb3;
however EMSA bands migrated generally faster with Pb3
extracts and that could be related to the genetic differences
found in isolates belonging to PS2. Interestingly, we
observed that probes containing an AP-1 recognition
sequence or heat shock elements within the shared 5'
intergenic region between PbLON and PbMDJ1 formed
EMSA bands that migrated consistently faster with protein
extracts from Pb3 [23]. By comparing Pb3 and Pb18 AP-1
and HSF genome sequences, however, we observed that
they are quite conserved; therefore polymorphism could
not explain migration differences, which might be due to
post-translational modifications in the translation factors
or even binding to distinct proteins in different isolates.
One of the processing steps of pre-messenger RNA before
export to the cytoplasm for translation involves endonucleolytic 3' cleavage for definition of the UTR and addition
of the poly(A) tail. In higher eukaryotes, the choice of
poly(A) sites involves, among others, a poly(A) signal
(PAS) hexamer AAUAAA (or variants), localized 10 to 30
nt upstream of the poly(A) site, and U(U/G)-rich region
(DSE) that lays 20 to 40 nt downstream of the poly(A) site
[27,35]. The PAS hexamer binds to a poly(A) specific factor, while DSE bears binding sites to a cleavage stimulating factor that directs polyadenylation. In our studies we
found multiple poly(A) cleavage sites between positions
1,420 and 1,457 of the PbGP43 3' UTR. There is an
AAGAAA sequence 21 nt upstream of position 1,420,

which is a potential PAS, or positioning element as
defined in yeast [25]. According to a survey on PAS hexamers in 13,942 human and 11,150 mouse genes [36],
AAGAAA was the fifth most frequent PAS hexamer found,
at a frequency of 2.99% in humans and 2.15% in mice. In
the same study, the authors observed that heterogeneity of
poly(A) cleavage sites occurred most frequently within a
range of 24 bp. Therefore, they have defined poly(A) sites
up to 24-bp long. They also noticed that the occurrence of
multiple potentially alternative poly(A) sites in 54% of
human genes. We analyzed 56 3' UTR sequences from a
single gene (PbGP43) in ten isolates of P. brasiliensis and
observed that within a range of 37 bp there were two main
clusters (1,420 to 1,441 and 1,451 to 1,457) of multiple
cleavage sites separated by one to five bp (Table 2). They
are separated by ten bp and we could speculate that they
constitute two alternative poly(A) sites. Only 21% of the
sequences (from six isolates) had cleavage sites in the second cluster. It is worth mentioning that the sequence
downstream of the 3'-most cleavage site is U/UG-rich, as
in mammal DSE, although this element has not been
described in yeasts [25]. Differences in the PAS hexamer
could result in diversity of cleavage sites. Our analysis
showed conserved 3' UTR in the PbGP43, therefore polymorphism in poly(A) cleavage site has a different origin.
In yeasts, the role of close but alternative poly(A) site is
unknown [25] and in P. brasiliensis this subject has originally been studied here. Comparison of 326 bp of
PbGP43 3' intergenic region from Pb339 (U2616.2) with
genome sequences http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/paracoccidioides_brasiliensis/MultiHome.html shows substitutions in positions 1,364,
1,385, 1,446, 1,563, 1,594 for Pb3 and Pb18, which have
not been detected in the present work.

Conclusions
We have undertaken extensive studies on polymorphisms
in the 5' and 3' intergenic regions of the PbGP43 gene
from Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. We have characterized
2,047 bp of intergenic region and described a peculiar
type of sequence structure with repetitive fragments. Two
promoter regions containing polymorphic nucleotides
were able to bind protein. We have detected differences
that might guide future efforts to understand transcriptional differences of PbGP43 among isolates.

Methods
Fungal isolates and growth conditions
P. brasiliensis clinical isolates Pb18, Pb3 (originally 608)
and Pb339 (B-339) were the focus of this work. Genetic
material from Pb2 (originally 1925), Pb4 (originally
1014), Pb5 (originally AP), Pb9 (originally 924), Pb10
(originally Peru), Pb11 (originally Mg5), Pb12 (originally
Argentina), Pb14 (originally 470), Pb16 (originally solo)
and Pb17 (originally tatu) were also analyzed for polymorphism in the 3' UTR and poly(A) cleavage site and/or
length polymorphism of the 5' intergenic region. Details
about the origin of these isolates, as well as their genetic
groups according with the PbGP43 phylogeny and multilocus studies can be found elsewhere [3,15]. The isolates
were maintained in the yeast phase in slants of modified
YPD medium (mYPD, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% casein
peptone, 1.5% glucose, pH 6.3) either at 36°C, with subculturing every 20 days, or at 4°C for some months.
Extraction of total DNA, RNA and preparation of total
protein extracts
Total protein extracts used in DNA binding assays were
obtained as detailed previously [23], using P. brasiliensis
yeast cells from Pb18, Pb3 and Pb339 incubated at 36°C

Page 10 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:277

in mYPD with shaking (120 r.p.m.) for four to five days.
Total DNA-free RNA was isolated from Pb18, Pb3 and
Pb339 yeast cells using approximately 0.1 ml of wet pellets and the TRizol reagent (Invitrogen), as previously
described [22]. For RNA extraction followed by real time
RT-PCR, fungal cells were cultivated at 36°C with shaking
in F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 1.5% glucose
(F12/glc). Transcription modulation with fetal bovine
serum (FBS) was verified by stimulating log-phase yeast
cells growing in F12/glc with 2% FBS for 30 min. For transcription modulation with glucose, log-phase cultures in
F12 medium (that has 0.18% glucose in its formulation)
were supplemented with glucose to 1.5% final concentration. Total RNA-free DNA was purified from mechanically
disrupted P. brasiliensis yeast cells cultivated in mYPD
[12,15].
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA)
We followed EMSA protocols described by Tosco et al.
[37] with annealed sense (Table 1) and anti-sense oligonucleotides, as detailed in our previous reports [22,23].
Briefly, double-stranded oligonucleotides (60,000 c.p.m)
were radio labeled with [γ32P] dATP (10 mCi/ml, Amersham) and incubated (15 min at 37°C) with an ice-cold
solution containing 10 μg of total protein extract from P.
brasiliensis, 1.5 μL of poly dI-dC (1.25 mg/mL), 1.5 μL of
BSA (10 mg/mL) and 3 μL of a solution containing 125
mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA and 50% glycerol in a
total reaction volume of 12 μl. Competition assays were
incubated in the presence of molar excess of cold oligonucleotides. The reactions were separated in 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (37.5:1 acrilamide/bisacrilamide) run in 0.5 × TBE buffer either for 45 min at
100 V in a mini-Protean II apparatus (BioRad), or for one
hour at 20 mA in 14 × 12 cm gels. The gels were dried and
exposed to an X-Omat (Kodak) film at -70° C.
Cloning an extended fragment of the 5' intergenic region
of PbGP43
We developed a strategy to clone an extended fragment of
the PbGP43 5' intergenic region using PCR and a combination of primers from i) an internal 5' region of the
PbGP43 ORF (PCRia, reverse primer, 5'-GCGAGAACACAGCTGGCAAGAGCCAGGTTAAGAG-3');
ii)
conserved ORF regions from the 5' neighboring gene of
fungal β-1,3-glucanases homologous to PbGP43 (forward
consensus primers). By the time we used that strategy
there was publicly available genome information from
Aspergillus fumigatus http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/afu1/,
A. nidulans and A. terreus http://www.broad.mit.edu/
node/568. We also counted on H. capsulatum and B. dermatitidis preliminary sequencing data kindly supplied by
Dr. William E. Goldman, presently at the Duke University
Medical Center. We found in H. capsulatum, A. terreus and
A. nidulans a homologous GPI-anchored protein ORF

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/277

lying 5.5 kb to 9.2 kb away from the β-1,3-glucanase gene.
Three primers were designed from homologous DNA
internal regions from that ORF. A series of PCR reactions
were carried out at different annealing temperatures and
primer combinations using a Long PCR Enzyme kit (Fermentas). Primers were also tested individually to control
for unspecific bands. The PCR reactions were visualized in
ethidium bromide gels, then Southern-blotted and
hybridized with a probe covering 110 bp of the PbGP43 5'
proximal flanking region. A 1.8-kb fragment hybridized
more strongly than others with the radioactive probe, and
although it was the product of PCRia primer alone, it was
cloned in pGEM-T vector and sequenced. Sequence information and a series of subsequent PCR, using selected
primers from the newly sequenced region paired with
ORF primers, showed that we managed to fortuitously
clone an extended part of the 5' intergenic region to a total
of 2,047 bp (updated U26160.2). For subsequent length
polymorphism studies of this region, we compared amplicons obtained with internal PbGP43 reverse primer (GRN,
5'-GAGGATCCCATGATGCCTATGCC-3') and forward P4
primer (5'-CAGCAGCATATTTGATTTCCT-3'), as shown in
Results.
3' RACE RT-PCR
We used 3' RACE RT-PCR to obtain individual PbGP43
transcripts and further compare their sequences and
poly(A) sites. The reactions were assayed using the ThermoScript RT-PCR System (Gibco) and total DNA-free
RNA from 10 P. brasiliensis isolates. Total cDNA was elongated using a standard oligo-dT primer (5'GACTCGAGTCGACATCGT17-3'). The second strand and
DNA amplifications were obtained with a forward
PbGP43 internal primer located at the 3' end (5'-CGATGCTCGCTTCCTCAT-3') and reverse corresponding to
oligo-dT without the T-tail (5'-GACTCGAGTCGACATCG3'). PCR reactions (100 μL) were carried out in 50 mM
KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 50 μM of
each dNTP, 1 μM of each primer and 5 U Taq polimerase
(Amersham). Cycling involved 5 min at 95°C, followed
by 30 cycles at 95°C (1 min), 55°C (1 min) and 72°C (3
min, then 10 min). The amplified products were cloned
into a pGEM-T vector (Promega). A series of transformed
bacterial clones were selected for plasmid purification and
insert sequence analysis.
Quantitative real time RT-PCR
Quantitative real time RT-PCR was carried out using the
Syber Green detection system (Applied Biosystems), following the manufacturer's instructions and details provided in our previous report [22]. The PbGP43 ORF
primers used in the reactions were 5'-TCGTGATATAGACAGCACCGTTG-3' (forward) and 5'- AAGACTTGGTTGTGGTATGTGTCG-3' (reverse). P. brasiliensis α-tubulin
gene was used as calibrator with primers 5'-CGGCTAAT-

GGAAAATACATGGC-3' (forward) and 5'-GTCTTGGCCTTGAGAGATGCAA-3' (reverse). Cycling was
performed in an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystem, USA) starting with
one cycle of 50°C (2 min) and 95°C (1 min), followed by
40 cycles at 95°C (15 sec) and 60°C (1 min), and an additional cycle of 95°C (15 sec), 60°C (20 sec) and 95°C (15
sec) for determination of the dissociation curve. Negative
controls did not contain DNA or RNA. Reactions were run
in triplicates and in parallel with the α-tubulin calibrator.
We built a standard curve for each probe by assaying
increasing amounts of theoretical copy numbers of each
gene obtained with serial dilutions of P. brasiliensis
genomic DNA, as described [38]. The final data were presented as the mean ± SD.
Sequence analysis
Nucleotide sequencing was carried out in the facilities of
the Center of Human Genome at the São Paulo University
(USP). Manual sequencing of 3' RACE products was carried out as described [15]. Sequences were analyzed using
the EditSeq, SeqMan and MegAlign programs of the Lasergene System (DNAstar Inc.). Putative transcription motifs
were deduced by the TFSearch program http://
www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html.

Authors' contributions
