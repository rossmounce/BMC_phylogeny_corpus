Abstract
Background: Chloroplasts descended from cyanobacteria and have a drastically reduced genome following an
endosymbiotic event. Many genes of the ancestral cyanobacterial genome have been transferred to the plant
nuclear genome by horizontal gene transfer. However, a selective set of metabolism pathways is maintained in
chloroplasts using both chloroplast genome encoded and nuclear genome encoded enzymes. As an organelle
specialized for carrying out photosynthesis, does the chloroplast metabolic network have properties adapted for
higher efficiency of photosynthesis? We compared metabolic network properties of chloroplasts and prokaryotic
photosynthetic organisms, mostly cyanobacteria, based on metabolic maps derived from genome data to identify
features of chloroplast network properties that are different from cyanobacteria and to analyze possible
functional significance of those features.
Results: The properties of the entire metabolic network and the sub-network that consists of reactions directly
connected to the Calvin Cycle have been analyzed using hypergraph representation. Results showed that the
whole metabolic networks in chloroplast and cyanobacteria both possess small-world network properties.
Although the number of compounds and reactions in chloroplasts is less than that in cyanobacteria, the
chloroplast's metabolic network has longer average path length, a larger diameter, and is Calvin Cycle -centered,
indicating an overall less-dense network structure with specific and local high density areas in chloroplasts.
Moreover, chloroplast metabolic network exhibits a better modular organization than cyanobacterial ones.
Enzymes involved in the same metabolic processes tend to cluster into the same module in chloroplasts.
Conclusion: In summary, the differences in metabolic network properties may reflect the evolutionary changes
during endosymbiosis that led to the improvement of the photosynthesis efficiency in higher plants. Our findings
are consistent with the notion that since the light energy absorption, transfer and conversion is highly efficient
even in photosynthetic bacteria, the further improvements in photosynthetic efficiency in higher plants may rely
on changes in metabolic network properties.

Background
Photosynthesis is one of the most important and fundamental metabolic processes in the biosphere. The appearance of photosynthesis in prokaryotic organisms early in
the earth's history fundamentally changed the composition of the atmosphere and subsequently determined the
evolution of organisms. According to the theory of endosymbiosis, chloroplasts descended from cyanobacteria
[1,2]. During endosymbiosis, the ancestral cyanobacterial
genome was drastically reduced, and many genes were
transferred to the nuclear genome [1,3]. As a result, the
majority of the enzymes in chloroplast metabolic networks are nucleus-encoded, translated in cytosol, and
then imported into chloroplasts [4]. Such massive transportation of proteins requires a large amount of energy
and sophisticated regulation from plant cells. Since the
metabolic networks in chloroplasts are mostly constructed with proteins encoded in nuclear genome, do the
networks exhibit some unique properties and characteristics that deviate from the ancestors' metabolic networks?
To answer this question, we conducted a comparative
study of the metabolic networks between chloroplasts and
several photosynthetic bacteria.
Studies on the evolution of photosynthesis have mostly
focused on individual proteins or protein complexes
related to photosynthesis [1,5-7]. With the recent
advancements in genomics and the development of metabolic pathway databases, we are now able to reconstruct
metabolic networks from complete and annotated
genomes and conduct system-level comparisons of the
metabolic networks. Recently, there have been several
such studies comparing system-wide network properties
among many organisms [8,9]. In this study, we examined
the similarity and differences of network properties
between chloroplasts and the photosynthetic bacteria
including connectivity, clustering coefficient, path length,
network diameter [8,9], and modularity [10-13]. Compar-

isons of modular structures of the metabolic network provide insights about the modification of major
metabolisms of chloroplasts, such as addition or loss of
certain metabolisms and the changes in the organization
of metabolism due to endosymbiosis.

Results
Chloroplast metabolic network exhibits different
characteristics compared to photosynthetic bacteria
The basic statistics of reconstructed metabolic networks in
chloroplasts and photosynthetic bacteria are shown in
Table 1. The numbers of enzymes in all metabolic networks were similar. However, there were more cases of
one enzyme catalyzing two or more reactions in the photosynthetic bacteria. For example, aminomethyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.10) catalyzes three reactions in
synechorocus sp. WH8102 (syw):

Glycine + Tetrahydrofolate + NAD+ <=> 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate + NH3 + CO2 + NADH + H+
5-Formyltetrahydrofolate <=> 5,10-Methenyltetrahydrofolate + H2O
Tetrahydrofolate + S-Aminomethyldihydrolipoylprotein
<=> 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate + NH3 + Dihydrolipoylprotein
In contrast, only the last reaction exists in the chloroplast
network. When we compared enzymes in chloroplasts
and photosynthetic bacteria, we found some differences
among them. For example, there are 376 and 371
enzymes respectively in chloroplast and Synechococcus sp.
WH8102 (syw) metabolic network, among which 210
enzymes are shared by them. The complete list of enzymes
of chloroplasts, photosynthetic bacteria, E.coli, Arabidopsis
thaliana and Cyanidioschyzon merolae are all listed in Additional file 1.

The network is highly clustered around Calvin Cycle in
chloroplasts
For the SubNetwork, which includes reactions directly
connected with the Calvin Cycle, the average clustering
coefficient is higher and the average path length is shorter
than the whole network, indicating tighter linkage
between reactions in the SubNetwork, in both chloroplast
and photosynthetic bacteria (see Additional file 3).
Although the overall chloroplast network shows a lower
average clustering coefficient and longer average path
length compared to photosynthetic bacteria, the ratio of
average clustering coefficient between the SubNetwork
and the whole network is higher in chloroplasts than that
in photosynthetic bacteria. The ratio of average path
length between the SubNetwork and whole network is
lower in chloroplasts than that in photosynthetic bacteria
(Figure 1), suggesting that the chloroplast network is
highly clustered around the Calvin Cycle.

Furthermore, we made an interesting observation when
we ranked the connectivity of different compounds in the
network. We extracted the top ten connected (hub) compounds in the whole network and then checked their
ranks in the SubNetwork. It is interesting to notice that
glutamate, which is a crucial compound for nitrogen

Ratio of topological parameters

Even though the numbers of compounds and reactions in
chloroplast network are fewer than those in photosynthetic bacteria, the average connectivity of compound
nodes is very similar among them (Table 1). In addition,
the distribution of compound connectivity in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria followed the Power law (see
Additional file 2). The average clustering coefficients, the
average path lengths and the diameters of both enzyme
and compound nodes (Table 1) confirmed that the metabolic networks under study are scale-free and small-world
networks using hypergraph model. It is evident from
Table 1 that the topological properties are very similar
among all photosynthetic bacteria, while chloroplasts
exhibit some differences. Although the chloroplast network has fewer compound nodes and hyper-edges in its
hypergraph representation, the average path lengths and
diameters of both enzyme and compound nodes are
longer than those in photosynthetic bacteria. The average
clustering coefficient of both enzyme and compound
nodes are lower in chloroplasts, suggesting an overall
loose network structure in chloroplast. We also conducted
an in-depth comparison of the densities of enzyme networks in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria by analyzing the
cores using Pajek [14]. The k-core of a network is defined
as a subnetwork of a given network where each vertex has
at least k neighbors in the same core. For chloroplasts and
Synechococcus sp. WH8102 (syw), the largest core includes
32 and 37 enzymes respectively, among which 24
enzymes are shared by the two cores.

assimilation, is highly connected (hub) in the whole networks of both chloroplast and cyanobacteria. However,
glutamate does not exist in the chloroplast SubNetwork
but still exists in all cyanobacteria SubNetworks. The difference lies in the reaction L-Glutamate <=> 4-Aminobutanoate + CO2 catalyzed by L-Glutamate 1-carboxy-lyase
(EC 4.1.1.19), which is missing in chloroplast. This observation suggests that the nitrogen assimilation is not
directly linked to carbon fixation in chloroplasts, but is
linked in cyanobacteria.
Simulation of the possible impact of an incomplete dataset
on the topological properties of metabolic network
Most data collected in this study were originated from
genome annotations, which may be incomplete. In order
to assess the effect of such incomplete data, we designed
an experiment using the well-studied and most complete
E. coli metabolic network. First, the topological properties
of the entire network were calculated using the hypergraph model. Then, fractions of enzymes and reactions
were randomly removed from the network and the network properties were again calculated. The results after
random removal of nodes were used to simulate the
impact of incomplete metabolic information on the full
network. Table 2 demonstrates that the topological properties of the metabolic network remain nearly unaffected
when 35% of the enzymes were randomly removed. Even
after removal of 50% the topological parameters change
by less than 5% from those of the complete network. The
diameters increase by 8.33% over the original network,
which represents the most significantly changed parameter, but this value is far lower than the differences of network
parameters
between
chloroplasts
and
photosynthetic bacteria, indicating that the topological
differences of the two networks are unlikely to be caused

by an incomplete dataset. These results strongly validate
the significance of our comparisons between chloroplasts
and photosynthetic bacteria and support the conclusion
that chloroplasts have an overall loose but strongly Calvin
Cycle-centered network structure.
The chloroplast network shows a better modular structure
than photosynthetic bacteria
A natural step after the study of overall properties of a
complex network is to investigate the substructures within
the network and possible functions of the substructures.
One of the methods to decompose a complex network
structure is to find modules within the network based on
the connectivity among the nodes. In this study, we view
modules as sub-networks where the nodes are highly connected within a module, but much less connected
between modules.

Many approaches have been used to detect modules in
metabolic network including elementary modes, extreme
pathways, flux analysis [15-17], and graph clustering techniques such as Markov Clustering [MCL, ], Iterative Conductance Cutting [ICC, ], and Geometric Minimal
Spanning Tree Clustering [GMC, ]. After comparison, we
adopted the method from Guimerà and Amaral [21,22] to
identify modules in metabolic networks in chloroplasts
and photosynthetic bacteria (see detailed description in
the "Methods" section). This method is called the SA
module-detection algorithm in the remainder of the text.
Modular structures differ among different organisms. The
similarity of overall modular structure among chloroplasts, photosynthetic bacteria, E.coli, Arabidopsis thaliana
and Cyanidioschyzon merolae has been calculated and is
shown as a dendrogram in Figure 2 (see "Methods" section for detailed description of the similarity measurements of modules). Remarkably, all cyanobacteria exhibit
very similar modular organization and are different from
chloroplasts. Arabidopsis thaliana and Cyanidioschyzon
merolae are clustered together with high similar modular
structure. This result is consistent with the topological

results (Table 1) that chloroplast metabolic network
shows different characteristics.
Matching modules to particular metabolisms reveals the
possible biological significance of modularity [21,22].
The function of each enzyme module in chloroplast and
photosynthetic bacteria was classified using the classification scheme proposed in KEGG which includes nine
major pathways: carbohydrate metabolism, energy
metabolism, lipid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism,
amino-acid metabolism, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, biosynthesis
of secondary metabolites, and biodegradation of xenobiotics. Based on Guimerà and Amaral [21,22], we mapped
the modules to KEGG functional classifications; if more
than 50% of the enzymes in a module belong to one
major pathway, then the module is considered pathway
specific. The match between modules and KEGG classifications for chloroplasts and Synechococcus sp. WH8102

(syw) are shown in Figure 3. Other cyanobacteria showed
similar functional categories mapping to their corresponding modules. Interestingly, glycan biosynthesis and
metabolism, and biodegradation of xenobiotics are
absent in chloroplasts but present in cyanobacteria (Figure 3A,B). In addition, some metabolic processes related
to gibberellins, abscisic acid, brassinolide, cytokinin,
indole-3-acetic acid, ethylene, polyamine and jasmonic
acid are specific to chloroplasts, which are mostly
included in module 3. Most of these molecules are related
to hormone synthesis or metabolism [23-25].
Several modules were organized around amino-acid metabolic functions in both chloroplasts and Synechococcus sp.
WH8102 networks, which are module 2, 7, 10, 11 in chloroplast and module 1, 2, 3, 4 in Synechococcus sp.
WH8102, respectively. In chloroplasts, module 4 exclusively consists of enzymes in cofactor and vitamin metabolism, and all enzymes in module 9 belong to lipid
metabolism (Figure 3A). However no module in Synechococcus sp. WH8102 completely corresponds to any one specific pathway (Figure 3B). Nearly 90% of the enzymes in
module 3 in the chloroplast network are related to biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Also 80% enzymes in
module 12 relate to hormone metabolism in chloroplasts
(Figure 3A). In contrast, only module 5 and module 8 in
the cyanobacteria contain more than 50% enzymes
belonging to cofactor and vitamin metabolism and to
amino acid metabolism respectively (Figure 3B).
By comparing the similarity between any two modules in
chloroplasts and each photosynthetic bacterium, we
found for each bacterium 5 to 7 modules similar to corresponding modules in chloroplasts. Moreover five pairs of
these modules are very conserved among chloroplasts and
photosynthetic bacteria: three pairs correspond to aminoacid metabolism, two pairs belong to carbohydrate
metabolism and nucleotide metabolism respectively, all
of which are related to the core metabolism. It is evident
that the core metabolic processes are conserved in evolution. As an example, the comparison of modules between
chloroplast and Synechococcus sp. WH8102 was visualized
in Figure 4. The five modules with the same color are composed of similar enzymes, mapped to the same functional
pathways. These five conserved modules include 69.68%
and 80.32% of all enzymes in chloroplasts and Synechococcus sp. WH8102, respectively. Of the common 210
enzymes between chloroplasts and Synechococcus sp.
WH8102, approximately 60% of them exist in the conservative modules. The other modules in chloroplasts
mainly correspond to metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. This
result indicates that the core metabolisms of chloroplasts
are similar to cynobacteria, including carbohydrate
metabolisms, amino acid metabolisms and nucleotide

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/100

metabolism. The difference lies on the specialized pathways.

Discussion
This study showed that the chloroplast metabolic network
is less dense in comparison to photosynthetic bacteria as
indicated by longer path length, larger diameter and fewer
reactions. It has been suggested by Ma and Zeng [6] that
the three domains of organisms exhibit quantitative differences in the metabolic network properties, i.e. eukaryotes and archaea seem to have a longer path length and a
larger network diameter than bacteria. Our results suggest
that global properties of chloroplast metabolic network
are closer to eukaryotes than to bacteria, which may be a
result of re-construction of metabolic networks by most of
nucleus-coded proteins.
When comparing the SubNetwork properties, the chloroplast network is highly centered around the Calvin Cycle,
indicating that the chloroplast network appears to be simplified on one hand but highly specialized on the other.
This notion is further echoed by the subsequent investigation on modular structures (see below). The results could
also support a view that the highly developed apparatus of
light energy harvesting and its conversion to chemical
energy has been optimized in cyanobacteria and that further metabolic advantages could be gained by improving
the carbon fixation reactions in higher plants. Evolution
of the different enzymes involved in photosynthesis has
been studied extensively [26]. Our study suggests that
overall network properties could be an addition to the
phylogenetic analysis of individual enzymes, and might
provide more information about the evolutionary history
of chloroplasts.
In addition to being overall loose and Calvin Cycle-centered, chloroplast metabolic network shows a better modular structure than that of photosynthetic bacteria by SA
module-detection algorithm. Our results showed that
seven of the chloroplast modules are very pathway-specific in that more than 50% of the enzymes in the module
belong to one pathway, such as amino acid synthesis, or
carbohydrate metabolism (Figure 3A). In contrast, of the
eight modules detected in Synechococcus sp. WH8102, only
two modules show such pathway-specificity (Figure 3B).
Moreover, two modules in chloroplasts are composed of
enzymes of two pathways exclusively, lipid metabolism
and the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins. Clearly,
chloroplast metabolic network exhibits very different
modular structure compared to cyanobacteria. Modules
detected in this study represent the grouping of reactions
based on their connections, which reflect in some degree
the coordination of the whole metabolism. In chloroplasts, the overall complexity of the metabolic network
seems reduced with fewer reactions and absence of some

a highly modular structure.

related to hormones are probably a result of later addition
from higher plants.

All of the nine KEGG pathways exist in photosynthetic
bacteria while two of them, glycan biosynthesis and biodegradation of xenobiotics, are absent in chloroplast.
These two pathways are present in the cytosol of plant
cells. Glycan biosynthesis, which underlines the synthesis
of cellulose and glycol-protein on cell walls, is energetically favored to reside in cytosol instead of chloroplasts. If
glycan synthesis resided in chloroplasts, the transfer of
glycan from chloroplast to cell wall would need substantial energy input. Xenobiotic degradation is mostly carried
out in peroxisomes in plant cells [27]. As the site of photosynthesis and O2 release, chloroplast stroma generate
superoxide radicals [28], which could be a good place for
xenobiotic degradation. However, these superoxides in
chloroplast stroma would react with xenobiotics or xenobiotic degradation intermediates and form toxic radicals,
which require a better control and subsequently reduce
the efficiency of photosynthesis. Obviously, the compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells causes the specialization
of functions and increase of efficiency in organelles. We
also notice that metabolic processes related to hormones
exist in chloroplasts, but not in any photosynthetic bacteria. It is quite intuitive that as multi-cellular organisms,
plants need to communicate between cells. Hormones are
the means of such communication. Those reactions

Despite the differences, some of the pathways are conserved between chloroplasts and photosynthetic bacteria.
We noticed that five modules are common among all species in the study, which form a core of metabolism including carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism,
and nucleotides metabolism. But the organization of
these modules is different between chloroplasts and photosynthetic bacteria. The modules in chloroplasts show
higher functional specificity than their counterparts in
photosynthetic bacteria. The modules in photosynthetic
bacteria appear to have a mixture of functions. For example, the Calvin Cycle is completely embedded in one
module in chloroplasts, but split into two modules in Synechococcus sp. WH8102.
Recent studies have shown that cellular evolution might
have been mainly driven by horizontal gene transfer
(HGT) [29,30]. Since the metabolic network of chloroplasts exhibits a more highly modular organization, its
evolution may be a result of multiple HGTs. In fact, multiple horizontal gene transfer events have been implied
through the phylogenetic analysis of the key proteins
involving photosynthetic light reactions [26]. Martin et al.
found 1700 cyanobacteria genes in Arabidopsis nucleus
including 166 genes with EC numbers, among which 92

enzymes are targeted to chloroplasts [3]. We mapped
these 92 enzymes to modules in the chloroplast network
and found 88% of the enzymes exist in the conserved
modules corresponding to the core metabolism. The
highly modular structure of chloroplast metabolism is
possibly a prerequisite for a higher photosynthetic efficiency because a high modular structure can response to
environmental or internal changes in a more coordinated
and robust way. From another perspective, the light
energy harvesting, transfer, and conversion to chemical
energy in the form of ATP and NADPH has reached a high
efficiency even in cyanobacteria [31,32]. As a result,
changes in metabolic stoichiometry, in addition to
changes in enzyme kinetics of certain key enzymes such as
Rubisco [33] might represent the available options for
higher photosynthetic efficiency. In this aspect, this is
consistent with the results that chloroplast metabolism is
centered on the Calvin Cycle.

Conclusion
In summary, by comparing the topological properties and
features of metabolic networks between chloroplasts and
photosynthetic bacteria, we showed that the chloroplast
metabolic networks are reduced and simplified on one
hand, but highly specialized and modular on the other.
While overall density of the metabolic network in chloroplasts is reduced comparing to photosynthetic bacteria,
the density of sub-networks directly linked to Calvin Cycle
is increased. The chloroplast metabolic network also
exhibits a highly modular structure compared to the metabolic network of photosynthetic bacteria. These special
features of chloroplast metabolic network may reflect
changes in the reconstruction of the network during endosymbiosis and the results of horizontal gene transfer.
Functional mapping of the modules revealed that chloroplast metabolic network exhibited high functional specificity to the modules, indicating a better coordination of
the overall metabolism and specialization of functions.
Our findings are consistent with the notion that since the
light energy absorption, transfer and conversion is highly
efficient even in photosynthetic bacteria, the further
improvements in photosynthetic efficiency in higher
plants may rely on changes in metabolic network properties.

Methods
Dataset preparation
The metabolic pathway data for chloroplasts were
extracted from the Database of Chloroplast/Photosynthesis Related Genes collected by the Nagoya Plant Genome
Group [34], which is a general dataset including all chloroplast enzymes in several plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and tobacco. For photosynthetic
bacteria, we extracted the metabolic networks of nine species from KEGG: Anabaena sp. PCC7120 (ana), Chlorobium

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/100

tepidum (cte), Gloeobacter violaceus (gvi), Prochlorococcus
marinus SS120 (pma), Prochlorococcus marinus MED4
(pmm), Prochlorococcus marinus MIT9313 (pmt), Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (syn), Synechococcus sp. WH8102
(syw), Thermosynechococcus elongates (tel). We also collected the metabolic pathways of E.coli, Arabidopsis thaliana and Cyanidioschyzon merolae (red algae) from KEGG.
We coded enzymes and compounds by their corresponding EC number and compound ID number in the KEGG
database, respectively. The direction of reactions was
obtained based on the rules provided by Ma and Zeng [6].
A sub-network was constructed by including all reactions
sharing metabolites with the Calvin Cycle. All enzymes
and reactions in the Calvin Cycle are shown in Figure 5A.
Network reconstruction and topological properties of
networks
Most metabolic reactions have more than one substrate
and/or more than one product, and therefore violate the
condition of a one-to-one relationship between vertices
and edges of a simple graph. Here we used a hypergraph
model [35,36] to represent metabolic networks, where a
hyper-edge represents a reaction and nodes represent different components involved in the reaction (i.e. enzymes
and compounds). The hyper-edge relates a set of substrates to a set of products via enzymes. Figure 5B gives an
example of a hypergraph, which offers an unambiguous
representation of the enzymes and compounds in biochemical networks. The topological properties of both
enzymes and compounds can be represented and analyzed simultaneously. The following topological properties were calculated:
Connectivity (degree)
The connectivity of an enzyme node A is defined as the
number of enzymes sharing compounds with the reaction
catalyzed by A. For example, in Figure 5C, Fructose-1,6bisphosphate phosphatase (3.1.3.11) catalyzes one reaction including two compounds C00354 and C00085.
There are three enzymes catalyzing reactions sharing these
two compounds, which are: fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
aldolase (4.1.2.13), Transaldolase (2.2.1.2) and Transketolase (2.2.1.1). Therefore, the connectivity of Fructose1,6-bisphosphate phosphatase (3.1.3.11) is three. The
connectivity of a compound node is the number of hyperedges containing the given compound. Average enzyme
connectivity and compound connectivity are computed
by averaging these two properties over all enzyme or compound nodes, respectively.
Path length
Path length is the number of hyper-edges in the shortest
path connecting two enzyme nodes or compound nodes.
For example, in Figure 5C, the path length from C00354
to C00279 is two. The average path length (AL) of the

entire hypergraph is the path length between each of two
nodes, averaged over all pairs of nodes.
Diameter
The diameter of a hypergraph is the maximum path length
between any pair of nodes.
Clustering coefficient
This parameter measures the "cliquishness" of the neighborhood of a given node. Assuming k nodes are connected
to a given node v and there are m hyper-edges between
these k nodes (not including hyper-edges connecting
them to v), the clustering coefficient of node v is: C(v) = 2
m/[k(k-1)]. For example, Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate phosphatase (3.1.3.11) has three enzymes connected to it, and

every two of these three are connected, so m is 3 and C(v)
is 1 for this enzyme. The clustering coefficient (CC) of all
enzyme or compound nodes in the hypergraph is defined
as the average of C(v) over all enzyme or compound
nodes.
Some small molecules, such as adenosine triphosphate
(ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and H2O, are normally used as
carriers for transferring electrons or energy and participate
in many reactions, while typically not participating in
product formation. The connections through these compounds should be treated differently when calculating the
path length from one metabolite to another. The following small molecules were disregarded in the calculations

Page 9 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:100

as well as their connections when no product was formed:
ATP, ADP, H2O, H+, NAD+, NADP+, NADH, NADPH,
Orthophosphate, and Pyrophosphate,. It should be noted
that the omission is not determined by the compound,
but by the reaction. For example, H2O is a small metabolite in many reactions, but in the following reaction:Putrescine + Oxygen + H2O <=> 4-Aminobutanal +
NH3 + H2O2, H2O cannot be omitted because it participates in producing H2O2.
The Calvin Cycle is a key pathway in photosynthesis. We
have defined the SubNetwork as a sub-network directly
linked to the Calvin Cycle using the reactions that share
all the compounds in the Calvin Cycle, with the exception
of the small molecules listed before. We calculated the
network properties of the SubNetwork and the ratios of
each property between the SubNetwork and the total network.
Module discovery of enzyme-centric graphs
Module discovery methods based on metabolic flux are
either intractable at the genome scale or have more overlap between modules [15-17]. The graph clustering techniques are regarded as appropriate for network modules
detection; experimental study confirms MCL performs
better than ICC and GMC in many cases [37]. In general,
the MCL algorithm performs well for graph clustering
except for graphs which are very homogeneous (such as
weakly connected grids) and for graphs in which the natural cluster diameter (i.e. the diameter of a subgraph
induced by a natural cluster) is large [38]. It has been successfully adapted to protein family classification, which
has rather complete and definite data. However, MCL
often gives a trivial clustering and is sensitive to signal
noise, which may generate biologically insignificant modules. Guimerà and Amaral [21,22] identify modules in
metabolic networks by maximizing the network's modularity using simulated annealing. By relating the metabolites in any given module to KEGG's nine major pathways,
they validated that more than one-third of the metabolites
in any module belong to a single pathway, which can provide a functional cartographic representation of the complex network.

We compared the modularity of metabolic networks by
MCL and SA, and found MCL generated more small-size
modules compared to SA, which were difficult to map to
higher level functional categories. MCL decomposed the
chloroplast enzyme network into 48 modules and the
photosynthetic bacteria network into 30–40 modules.
The size of the modules exhibits a power-law distribution,
where one or two large modules include many enzymes
from several unrelated biological pathways and many
modules only consist of no more than four enzymes. SA,
in contrast, gives a moderate number of modules. The SA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/100

algorithm detected 12 modules in the chloroplast enzyme
network and 8 to 9 modules for the photosynthetic bacterial species. Each module consists of enzymes involved in
one or several particular metabolic functions. A detailed
list of enzymes in each module by both MCL and SA in all
species can be seen in Additional file 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 13. This comparison indicates that SA might be more
appropriate for the clustering analysis in this study. We
selected modules detected by SA algorithm for similarity
analysis and functional classification.
Deviating from Guimerà and Amaral [21,22], we used an
enzyme-centric graph representation of the metabolic network where vertices were used to represent enzymes and
edges were used to represent compounds. There will be a
directed edge from enzyme E1 to enzyme E2, if E1 catalyzes a reaction generating a product A which is used as
substrate of E2. Reversible reactions are considered as two
separate reactions. Modularization of such enzyme-centric graph categorizes enzymes into different functional
groups.
Similarity measure of modular structures
To compare the modular structures among the networks
from different species, we define a similarity measure
based on Hamming distance [39]. For two modules a and
b in two species, the number of enzymes in each module
is Na and Nb. First, we compute the similarity between any
two enzyme members between module a and b. Any EC
number is treated as a vector with 4 parts, which are given
different weight 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 according to EC hierarchy. For two EC numbers, one vector P emerges to
describe their similarity. If they are same at the kth level,
then Pk is 1, otherwise Pk is 0. Thus the similarity between
any two enzymes i and j is defined as:

Sij =

4

∑ wk Pk

k =1

Note that the comparison of two EC numbers should be
from high level to low level, if different at the kth level,
then all Pt (t>=k) will be 0 regardless of whether they are
the same at lower levels.
After collecting all similarities between any two enzymes,
the most similar enzyme in module b for each enzyme i in
module a is identified. This maximal similarity is represented as Sbesti. Then the global similarity between module a and module b should be defined as:

Simi(a,b) =

1
Na

Na

∑ Sbesti
i =1

Therefore, for any module in one species, its most similar
module in another species can be identified. If two modPage 10 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:100

ules of two species are both most suited each other, they
are regarded as conserved modules between these two species.
In order to investigate the overall modular structure
among different species, we compared the modular similarity between two species based on the similarity between
modules. Each module in each species is regarded as a
sample, and the total of these samples as a large group.
Thus the similarity between two species can be measured
by the similarity between these two groups, which is
defined according to the Hausdorff metric [40]. G1 and G2
are two groups representing two species, Sspecies(G1,G2) is
the similarity between these two species, a and b are samples (modules above) belonging to G1 and G2, respectively. The similarity S(a, G2) between sample a belonging
to group G1 and group G2 is defined as:

⎡
⎤
S(a, G2 ) = max ⎢ Simi(a,b) ⎥
⎣ b∈G2
⎦
Then, the similarity between G1 and G2 is given by:
S(G1 , G2 ) = min [ S(a, G2 ) ]
a∈G1

It is important to note that this similarity is in general not
symmetrical. Accordingly we introduce the similarity
between G2 and G1:

⎡
⎧
⎫⎤
S′(G2 , G1 ) = min ⎢ max ⎨ Simi(b,a) ⎬ ⎥
b∈G2 ⎢
⎩ a∈G1
⎭⎥
⎣
⎦
It is then convenient to introduce the similarity between
two species as:
Sspecies(G1,G2) = min{S(G1,G2),S'(G2,G1)}
The Hausdorff metric provides a more accurate measurement of the structure similarity between two species, since
the lower value of the forward and backward similarity is
selected, which leads to a significantly underestimated
assessment.
