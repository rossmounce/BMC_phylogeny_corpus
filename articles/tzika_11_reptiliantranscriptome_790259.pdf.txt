Reptilian-transcriptome v1.0, a glimpse in the
brain transcriptome of five divergent Sauropsida
lineages and the phylogenetic position of turtles

Abstract
Background: Reptiles are largely under-represented in comparative genomics despite the fact that they are
substantially more diverse in many respects than mammals. Given the high divergence of reptiles from classical
model species, next-generation sequencing of their transcriptomes is an approach of choice for gene identification
and annotation.
Results: Here, we use 454 technology to sequence the brain transcriptome of four divergent reptilian and one
reference avian species: the Nile crocodile, the corn snake, the bearded dragon, the red-eared turtle, and the
chicken. Using an in-house pipeline for recursive similarity searches of >3,000,000 reads against multiple databases
from 7 reference vertebrates, we compile a reptilian comparative transcriptomics dataset, with homology
assignment for 20,000 to 31,000 transcripts per species and a cumulated non-redundant sequence length of 248.6
Mbases. Our approach identifies the majority (87%) of chicken brain transcripts and about 50% of de novo
assembled reptilian transcripts. In addition to 57,502 microsatellite loci, we identify thousands of SNP and indel
polymorphisms for population genetic and linkage analyses. We also build very large multiple alignments for
Sauropsida and mammals (two million residues per species) and perform extensive phylogenetic analyses
suggesting that turtles are not basal living reptiles but are rather associated with Archosaurians, hence, potentially
answering a long-standing question in the phylogeny of Amniotes.
Conclusions: The reptilian transcriptome (freely available at http://www.reptilian-transcriptomes.org) should prove a
useful new resource as reptiles are becoming important new models for comparative genomics, ecology, and
evolutionary developmental genetics.

Background
The field of comparative genomics is constantly
enriched by the addition of newly sequenced genomes:
by the end of 2010, about 1,300 bacterial and 150 eukaryotic genomes had been sequenced http://www.genomesonline.org with various degrees of precision and
coverage. In particular, there is a great interest in mammalian genomes, given their proximity to humans and,
hence, their potential power for generating biomedically-relevant data. Identification of conserved elements
has been a central focus of comparative analyses and

the driving force behind initiatives such as the ’Multiple
Mammalian Genomes for Comparative Annotation’ project http://www.genome.gov/25521745, initially including
24 mammalian species. The recent development of nextgeneration sequencing technologies [1-3] allows the
comparative genomics community to contemplate the
possibility of incorporating high-coverage full genome
sequences from many non-classical model organisms for
a better understanding of how biological diversity and
complexity evolved. For example, the ’Evolution of the
Human Proteome’ initiative aims at sequencing the genome of nine additional chordate species to complete the
coverage of major lineages of the chordate phylogeny
and uncover the genomic changes that correlate with
key morphological and physiological transitions http://
www.genome.gov/25521740.

Among under-represented groups, in terms of genome
sequence data, are the major lineages of Sauropsida,
which diverged 200 to 280 million years ago: Testudines
(turtles), Lepidosauria (the tuatara, lizards, and snakes)
and Archosauria (crocodiles and birds). Even if we
exclude the 10,000 extant species of birds, Sauropsida
still includes over 8,000 species (compared to 5,400 species of mammals) that display a remarkable range of life
histories, sex-determining systems, reproductive modes,
physiologies, and body plans [4]. For example, in squamates, limb reduction has evolved independently at least
25 times [5], and viviparity at least 100 times [6] (versus
less than 15 times each in bony fishes, cartilaginous
fishes, and amphibians, once in mammals, and never in
birds); shifts between genetic and temperature-dependent sex determination have occurred multiple times as
well [7]; and some lizards even exhibit ovulation of tiny
eggs and placental nutrition of embryos [8]. Hence,
comparative genomic analyses incorporating reptilian
genomes promise to uncover evolutionary novelties
more diverse in many respects than those revealed by
genomic comparisons among mammals. Furthermore,
non-avian reptilian genomes would greatly improve the
comparison between mammals and birds by incorporating major missing nodes between these two lineages
[9,10]. Thus far, only the genome of the green anole
lizard (Anolis carolinensis) and a handful of birds (the
chicken, Gallus gallus; the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata; the duck, Anas platyrhynchos; and the turkey,
Meleagris gallopavo) have been fully sequenced. Model
reptilian species, whose genome should be sequenced in
priority, need to be chosen pragmatically [11,12] by
incorporating criteria such as phylogenetic position, nature of the ancestral/derived states of key morphological/
physiological characters, level of diversity within the corresponding higher taxon, ease with which the species
can be handled, housed and bred, and protection status.
Even if next-generation methods make the sequencing
of a complex genome possible in a matter of weeks,
such a project remains very costly and requires much
additional time for assembly and annotation. For species
that are considerably divergent from existing high-quality genomes, gene identification and annotation greatly
benefits from transcriptome data. Again, next-generation
sequencing will probably become the method of choice
for generating high-quality transcriptome data and supplant other methods such as serial analysis of gene
expression (SAGE), sequencing of expressed sequence
tags (ESTs), substractive hybridization, differential display, and even microarrays (at least for non-model species). Indeed, next-generation sequencing of
transcriptomes has recently proven to be highly valuable
for producing functional genome sequences, as well as
gene polymorphism and expression data [13-17]. In

addition, software has been developed for handling the
massive amount of sequence data and for de novo
assembling of contigs without the need of reference genomes [18,19].
Besides large-scale EST libraries available for several
organs of the anole lizard (including a brain library,
dbEST library #23338, yet to be analyzed), reptilian transcriptomes so far are quite limited: a few snake venomgland partial transcriptomes (each consisting of 600 to
1,000 ESTs generally clustering into about 300 unique
sequences [20-22]), a heart transcriptome of the Burmese python consisting of about 2,800 mRNAs [23],
3,064 assembled unique sequences of Alligator missipiensis analyzed for their GC-content [24], and 833
assembled unique sequences available for the red-eared
slider turtle, with a few related to brain development
[25,26]. A notable very recent exception is a garter
snake large-scale multi-individual and multi-organ transcriptome [27], which identified about 13,000 snake
genes on the basis of homology assignment with other
vertebrates, as well as thousands of transcripts of unidentified protein-coding genes.
Here, we used 454 technology for sequencing brain
transcriptomes in four reptilian and one avian species:
(i) the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus), whose
development has recently been described [28], (ii) the
oviparous Corn snake (Elaphe guttata), as a better alternative (in the Evo-Devo context [11,12]) to the viviparous common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis), (iii) the
Bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps), a lizard of the Agamidae family that diverged approximately 150 mya from
the Iguanidae [29] to which Anolis belongs, (iv) the redeared turtle (Trachemys scripta), and (v) the chicken (G.
gallus) as a reference for the performed analyses. We
chose to focus on the brain for one primary reason: it
exhibits one of the most complex (that is, diverse) transcriptomes of all organs in vertebrates [30,31]; hence, it
is a tissue of choice for sequencing a maximum number
of transcripts while reducing the need for normalization.
Note also that reptilian species have been incorporated
in comparative analyses of the vertebrate brain [32]
aimed at understanding the evolution of the sensory and
cognitive novelties associated with the vertebrate central
nervous system [33,34], a topic beyond the scope of the
present paper.
We generated over 3,000,000 reads which were fed
into an automated and publicly-available pipeline,
‘LANE runner’, that performs iterative BLAST searches
and consensus assemblies. A total of 20 to over 31 thousand genes were identified per species, including transcripts that might be lineage specific. This new reptilian
comparative transcriptomics dataset (available at http://
www.reptilian-transcriptomes.org) should prove a useful
resource as reptiles are becoming important new models

for comparative genomics (for example, [35]), ecology
(for example, [4]), and evolutionary developmental
genetics (for example, [36-38]). We also identify thousands of both microsatellite loci and SNPs which can be
used in quantitative and population genetic analyses.
Finally, we built the longest (2,012,759 amino acids (aa))
reptilian multiple alignment of homologous sequences
to date (found in all five lineages of Sauropsida, three
mammals, and two outgroup taxa) and performed
extensive phylogenetic analyses for investigating the
long-standing question of the turtle lineage position
within the phylogeny of Amniotes. Although phylogenetic results must be taken with caution, as sequencing
errors in low coverage transcriptomes could generate
artifacts during phylogeny inference, maximum likelihood analyses of a large dataset (about 250 thousand
characters per species) void of paralogs hint at archosaurian affinities of Testudines.

Methods
cDNA library construction and sequencing

The complete brains of a crocodile (C. niloticus), a corn
snake (E. guttata), a bearded dragon lizard (P. vitticeps),
a red-eared slider turtle (T. scripta), and a chicken (G.
gallus) were each placed in the appropriate amount of
RNAlater (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD, USA) and
homogenized using MixerMill (Retsch Haan, Germany).
mRNA extraction and first strand cDNA synthesis were
performed using the ‘μMACs One-Step cDNA synthesis
kit’ (Miltenyi, Biotech Bergisch Gladbach, Germany),
according to the manufacture’s protocol. The eluted
cDNA/mRNA hybrids were directly used for the second
strand cDNA synthesis, in the presence of Escherichia
coli ribonuclease H and E. coli DNA polymerase I (Fermentas, Canada). After a 2-hour incubation at 16°C, the
samples were treated with E. coli DNA ligase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and T4 DNA polymerase (Fermentas) for filling-in nicks and blunting ends,
respectively. Products were phenol/chloroform extracted
before ligation of unphosphorylated double-stranded
adaptors (OligoI: 5’ - AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTAC - 3’ and OligoII: 5’ - GTACTCTGCGTTGATACCACTGCTT - 3’). The adaptor sequence
corresponds to the ‘CAP’ primers (Clontech, Mountain
View, CA, USA) to take advantage of the PCR suppression effect to preferentially amplify longer molecules
and enrich for full-length transcripts [39]. Prior to
amplification of the ligation product, a fill-in step was
performed to remove the 5’-end nick between OligoII
and the cDNA: a mix of the ds-cDNA+adaptors, dNTPs,
LongExpand polymerase and PCR buffer 1 (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland) was incubated at 68°C for 5 minutes.
OligoI was then added as a primer for cDNA amplification: denaturation at 93°C for 2 minutes followed by 10

Page 3 of 18

cycles of 93°C for 10 seconds, 60°C for 30 seconds, 68°C
for 7 minutes, and 20 cycles of 93°C for 15 seconds, 60°
C for 30 seconds, 68°C for 7 minutes + 20 seconds/
cycle. The cDNA library construction and sequencing
was performed as in [1].
Contig initial assembly

All sequence and quality files were merged (with ’A.F.7
Merge files’ v1.3) separately for each species. Removal of
adaptor sequences is built in our in-house software,
‘LANE runner’ (see below): adaptor sequences identified
at the beginning or end of a read were removed along
with the corresponding quality values. In rare cases,
when the adaptor was identified within the sequence
rather than at its extremities, the adaptor sequence was
removed and the read (and associated quality values)
was split into the two corresponding parts. Near-exact
matches to adaptors and PolyA stretches were removed,
and the remaining sequences were assembled into contigs, using SeqMan NGen v2.0 (DNASTAR). Default
parameters for de novo assembly of ‘454’ reads were
used, except for two settings: the ‘Match Spacing’ was
set to 50 (instead of 10) and the ‘Min Match Percentage’
was set to 80 (instead of 85). The first parameter represents the length of the window of a sequence read
where at least one mer tag (that is, a unique subsequence) will be searched for, and the second is the
minimum percentage of identity between two reads for
every alignment of 50 bases before extension of alignment is attempted. Unassembled reads (singletons) were
trimmed based on sequence quality.
Homology assignment using BLAST

Zero to four reads per species assembly were identified
as bacterial contaminants and were removed. The contigs and singletons were first aligned (BLAST) against
the following databases: (i) ’Ensembl ncRNA v. 56’, containing known non-coding RNA molecules, such as
ribosomal, transfer, or micro RNAs, and (ii) ‘mtDNA’,
comprised of the mitochondrial genome available at
NCBI for each of the five species (accession numbers:
AJ810452, AM236349, AP003322, NC_006922,
NC_011573). We restricted the searches against the
Ensembl non-coding database of two mammalian species (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus), one lizard (A. carolinensis), two birds (G. gallus, Taeniopygia gutatta), one
amphibian (Xenopus tropicalis), and one fish (Danio
rerio). All searches were performed with our in-house
JAVA application, LANE runner, (available at http://
www.reptilian-transcriptomes.org) that provides a userfriendly interface for: (i) defining distinct BLAST settings for each searched database, (ii) submitting input
sequences to a ’wwwblast’ local server, and (iii) parsing
and summarizing all results in an XLS file. For the non-

coding and mtDNA databases, the ’blastn’ settings were:
e-value threshold = 10, gap opening and extension
penalties set to 5 and 1, respectively, word size = 11,
mismatch cost = 1, and match award = 2. Input
sequences were masked with the ‘low complexity’ filter
incorporated in BLAST. Hits with a match length <50
bp and/or an identity <50% were rejected.
All input sequences (contigs and singletons) with a hit
against the ‘mtDNA’ database were reassembled (using
NGen v.2) with the mitochondrial genome sequence of
the corresponding species used as a reference. The
sequences (contigs and singletons) not included in the
mtDNA assembly, nor with a hit against the non-coding
RNA database, were subjected to four additional rounds
of BLAST comparisons (Figure 1). At each round, the
input sequences with a hit were removed and used to
built a consensus (see below), whereas the remaining
ones were passed to the next round. The first round of
BLAST was against the ’Ensembl Coding v56’ database,
which contains all known transcripts (that can be

mapped to species-specific entries in public protein
databases), novel transcripts (for example, genes predicted on the basis of evidence from closely related species), and pseudogenes, along with their 5’ and 3’
untranslated regions (UTRs). The ’tblastx’ settings were:
e-value threshold = 10, gap opening and extension
penalties set to 11 and 1, respectively, word size = 3,
and ’BLOSSUM45’ protein substitution matrix. Input
sequences were masked with the ‘low complexity’ filter.
Hits with a match length <30 aa (that is, 90 bp) and/or
an identity <50% were rejected. The second round of
BLAST was against the ‘Unigene February 2010’ database containing the longest high-quality sequence from
each Unigene cluster. ’Blastn’ settings were as for the
‘mtDNA’ comparisons except that word size was set to
9. For the third round, sequences with no hit against
any of the previous databases were aligned (BLAST)
against the ‘Ensembl Genomic v56’ database containing
the full genome of each reference species (’blastn’ settings as for the Unigene analysis). Finally, the remaining

sequences of each species were compared to the consensus sequences resulting from the previous BLAST
rounds in the four other species (’blastn’ criteria as for
the Unigene analysis). Input sequences still with no hit
were masked using the RepeatMasker Web Server (version open-3.2.9; [40]) with the ‘cross_match’ search
engine and ‘Chicken’ as DNA source. All possible ORFs
in species-specific transcripts longer than 1,000 bp were
identified using ORF Finder [41], and the longest
deduced amino-acid sequence was aligned (BLAST)
against the ’nr’ NCBI database.

compound microsatellites. Monomers were taken into
account when repeated more than 10 times and di- to
hexa-nucleotides more than 5 times. Two or more perfect microsatellites separated by less than 50 bp were
considered as a single compound microsatellite. Highconfidence SNPs in nuclear DNA contigs were detected
with NGen v2, using a minimum sampling depth of
three for the minor allele (to discriminate sequencing
errors from genuine polymorphisms [45]). Note that, as
we used a single individual brain for each species, these
polymorphisms correspond to heterozygous sites.

Building and analysis of consensus sequences

Phylogeny inference

Consensus sequences were built using LANE runnerhttp://
www.reptilian-transcriptomes.org based on the BLAST
results. As one query sequence can hit several sequences
in one database, only the best match was chosen on the
basis of the following successive criteria: smallest e-value,
greatest match length, and highest percent of identity. If
all values were equal between different hits, the input
sequence was attributed to the first best result encountered to avoid redundancy. When the database consisted
of nucleotide sequences, the orientation of each input
sequence (forward or reverse complement) yielding the
best alignment score against the database sequence was
identified with JAligner [42], whereas, for the protein databases, the input sequences were translated using the frame
indicated by the best BLAST match. The query sequences
were aligned against the database sequences using MUSCLE[43] via the EBI server. ‘LANE runner’ automatically
retrieved alignments and computed a majority consensus
(Figure 1c). When the alignment was performed with protein sequences (that is, on the basis of ’tblastx’ results), it
was first back-translated into the original nucleotide
sequence before building the consensus. The database
(reference) sequence is only used for anchoring input
sequences and not for computing the consensus itself,
hence, the portions of the reference sequence that do not
match any input sequence are replaced by gaps (Figure
1b). We cannot exclude the possibility that different sections of paralogous genes are joined during this procedure.
When only one input sequence corresponded to one database reference sequence, no alignment was made and the
‘one-to-one consesus’ comprised only of the input
sequence. Consensus sequences were named after the corresponding database reference sequence. ‘LANE runner’
also computes gap percentages in three user-defined
regions of each consensus: here, the first (5’) 30%, the middle 40%, and the final 93’) 30% (Additional file 1, Table
S1).

We identified 4,689 genes for which at least partial aa
sequences were found in both our C. niloticus and T.
scripta transcriptomes. The homologs (when available)
were retrieved from the transcriptomes of the three
other species (E. guttata, P. vitticeps, and G. gallus) as
well as from Ensembl v56 for D. rerio, X. tropicalis, A.
carolinensis, G. gallus, T. guttata, M. musculus, H.
sapiens, and O. anatinus. For each protein, all aa
sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE server at
EBI ([43]; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/services/muscle). When no Ensembl Gallus sequence was
available, our Gallus sequence was used. New datasets
were built with trimAl[46] by (i) removing all gaps or
(ii) removing the positions that define the maximum
drop in the sorted distribution of gap scores. Additional
protein sequence datasets were generated by combining
sequences from different species into hybrid sequences
(Additional file 1, Figure S4). We performed analyses
with various combinations of hybrids: the two birds, the
three squamates, and the two non-amniote outgroup
species. Different species priorities were also tested, for
example, using the Gallus sequence only when the Taeniopygia sequence is not available, or vice versa.
To remove portions of the alignment where sequences
might be paralogous, we selected in MANTiS[47] the
protein sequences in our reptilian transcriptome dataset
for which none of the corresponding gene in D. rerio, X.
tropicalis, A. carolinensis, G. gallus, T. guttata, M. musculus, H. sapiens, and O. anatinus exhibits paralogs.
All protein sequence alignments were phylogenetically
analyzed (with D. rerio and X. tropicalis as outgroup
taxa) under the WAG or GTR maximum likelihood
(ML) aa substitution models and rate heterogeneity,
with RaxML v7.2.6 [48] using 100 bootstrap replicates,
and with MetaPIGAv2.1 [49] a software available at
http://www.metapiga.org and implementing the metapopulation genetic algorithm [50] together with complex
substitution models, discrete gamma rate heterogeneity,
and the possibility to partition data. For MetaPIGA analyses, we used probability consensus pruning among
four populations of four individuals each, and selected

reptilian-transcriptomes.org) that provides a userfriendly interface for (i) BLAST-aligning multiple
sequences against selected databases with different
parameters (Figure 1a) and (ii) automatically building
consensus sequences (Figure 1b and 1c). First, the contigs originating from the NGen assembly were aligned
using BLAST, together with the singletons, against the
known mitochondrial (mt) genome of each sequenced
species, as well as a non-coding RNA database
(Ensembl v56; http://www.ensembl.org) of seven reference species (G. gallus, T. guttata, A. carolinensis, H.
sapiens, M. musculus, X. tropicalis, and D. rerio). A
total of 6% to 11% of the contigs and 55% to 74% of
the singletons were identified as mt sequences (Table
2) and were thus used for the reconstruction of each
species organelle’s transcriptome. Less than 100
sequences of each species were uniquely linked to
known non-coding RNA (data not shown), probably
because of the selection of poly-A transcripts during
the library preparation and the small size of these noncoding RNA databases. Second, and for each of the five
species investigated, the non-mtDNA sequences were
sequentially aligned (Figure 1a), using BLAST, against
the ’Ensembl Coding v56’ database (including the coding sequence and the 5’ and 3’ UTRs), the ’Unigene
February 2010’ database, and the ‘Ensembl Genomic
v56’ database. In each case, BLAST searches were performed against the same seven reference species (G.
gallus, T. guttata, A. carolinensis, H. sapiens, M. musculus, X. tropicalis, and D. rerio) and the results were
restricted to hits longer than 50 bp. All query
sequences with a BLAST hit against Ensembl Coding
or Unigene were aligned against the corresponding
reference sequences and used for generating consensus
sequences. Finally, the contigs and singletons still with
no hit (orphan sequences) were aligned (using BLAST)
against the consensus sequences built at the previous
steps for the other four species. When a single
sequence hit a reference (’one-to-one’; Figure 1b), the
sequence was simply named (for homology assignment) after the reference. When multiple sequences
hit a reference (’one-to-many’; Figure 1b), their relative
positions, with potential intervening gaps (see Additional file 1, Table S1), were identified using the reference (Figure 1b), but the latter was ignored for
establishing the consensus itself among the query

the best-fitting ML nucleotide substitution model (GTR
and gamma-distributed rate variation across sites) on
the basis of the Akaike Information Criterion implemented in MetaPIGA. To generate an estimate of the posterior probability distribution of possible trees, we
performed replicated metaGA searches and stopped
when a series of mean relative error values [49] among
15 consecutive consensus trees remained below 2%
(with a minimum of 100 replicates).

Results and discussion
Transcriptome sequencing and contig initial assembly

Using a GS FLX genome analyser (454/Roche), we
sequenced amplified double-strand (ds) cDNA on two
plates for C. niloticus, P. vitticeps and T. scripta, and
one plate and a half for E. guttata and G. gallus. The
number of raw reads per species ranged from 524 thousands to 884 thousands (Table 1), with an average read
length of 164 to 207, and 92% to 98% of the reads
passed the quality filters (that is, removal of low-quality,
polyA stretches, adaptors or artifactual sequences).
Using NGen (DNAStar), we assembled between 25,819
and 52,348 contigs (depending on the species, see Table
2 for details) for a cumulated contig length of 10.1 to
21.6 Megabases (Mb) per species, whereas 168,075 to
263,428 reads remained unassembled (=’singletons’).
When considering both contigs and singletons, the
cumulated total length of unique sequences per species
amounted 37.6 Mb (Trachemys) to 69.0 Mb (Pogona).
The average contig length was 360 to 424 bp, but a substantial number of larger contigs was also observed: for
example, 10,709 Pogona contigs were >500 bp, and
2,792 were >1 kb. The longest nuclear and mitochondrial contigs were assembled for Pogona (6,063 bp) and
Crocodylus (7,513 bp), respectively. On average, each
contig contained 9.5 to 13.2 reads and the average
sequence depth was 2.9 to 3.7 (Table 2). Distributions of
contig size, number of reads per contig, and contig
lengths are shown in Additional file 1 (Figure S1).
Homology assignment and consensus building

Our strategy (of which a schematic representation is

available) strongly suggests that the lower percentage
(about 50%) of hits observed for each of the other four
species (Figure 2a) is simply due to (i) the lack of genome sequence data for the corresponding species and
(ii) the large evolutionary distance between the species
under study and the seven reference species used for
BLAST. In other words, the chicken results indicate that
the vast majority of the reptilian sequences reported
here are very likely genuine transcripts. Note that the
50% of genes identified after our de novo sequencing of
reptilian transcriptomes is larger than the proportion
(about 25%) of transcript identification in previous
efforts [27,51-53].
Analyzing consensus sequences

Depending on the reptilian species, 36,241 to 54,284
input sequences (contigs + singletons) generated 20,016
to 26,203 consensus sequences (Table 3) of which the
majority (>70%) were ‘ono-to-one’ consensuses. This
result indicates that de novo sequencing of the brain
transcriptome, as performed here, although it likely
identifies the majority of the species’ genes, does not
provide large sequence coverage of each one. The lower
percentage of ‘one-to-one’ consensuses obtained from
the chicken brain transcriptome sequencing (88,754
input sequences generating 31,021 consensus sequences
of which 58% are ‘one-to-one’; Table 3) is due to the
availability of the corresponding species genome/transcritome that facilitates the joining of contigs/singletons.
This strongly suggests that some of the ‘one-to-one’
consensuses in the other species would be joined by
additional sequencing efforts. Obviously, the efficiency
of homology assignment decreases both with decreased
query sequence length, and with increased evolutionary
distance between the query sequences and the genomes/
transcriptomes against which inter-species similarity
(BLAST) searches are performed. For example, Figure
S2 (Additional file 1) indicates that, for the species with

no specific genome/transcriptome available, the mean
size of input sequences (singletons and contigs) with a
BLAST hit is substantially larger than that of sequences
without a hit. It is likely that normalization of cDNA
before sequencing and ongoing improvements in
sequencing technology will help fill these gaps in transcriptome sequencing.
The sequencing of the reference species (chicken)
highlights some important points. First, whereas only
about half of the Gallus contigs and singletons exhibited
a hit attributed to an Ensembl transcript (Figure 2a),
almost a quarter matched a Unigene entry. Given that
the latter database mainly consists of EST libraries, this
result highlights the importance of splice variants and
variable 3’ UTRs. Furthermore, the 20% of the Gallus
sequences that exhibited a BLAST hit against the
chicken genome (and not against Ensembl Coding or
Unigene databases) likely represent splice variants and
novel transcript boundaries or unprocessed RNAs rather
than genome contaminants, because 41% of them (8,173
reads out of 19,942) are found within gene boundaries,
and an additional 35% are found in close proximity
(within 5,000 bp of estimated boundaries). The fact that
87% of our Gallus transcriptome sequences could be
identified is a clear indication that most of the reads
represent existing expressed sequences, rather than
sequencing or assembling artifacts. Note that more than
half of the remaining 13% (that is, Gallus sequences
with no hit) correspond to sequences that are less than
50 bp long and thus ignored during BLAST searches
(Figure 2a), and/or are masked by the ‘low complexity’
filter applied (Additional file 1, Table S2).
Manual inspection of the resulting annotations indicates that, for each of the sequenced species, a substantial proportion of the longest contigs (as well as the
contigs with the greatest number of reads) are homologized with transcripts known to be expressed in the
brain (Additional file 1, Tables S3 and S4). For example,
the myelin transcript was sequenced with one of the
highest coverage for all species besides Trachemys.
Other identified genes play a role in energy transduction
or the organization of the cytoskeleton. The high complexity of the brain transcriptome also allows for the
detection of transcripts with no known important function in the brain: for example, the testis-specific
GAPDH-2 gene found in the Elaphe brain.
Most of the long contigs (and/or those with the largest number of reads) in de novo sequenced species do
exhibit a BLAST hit. In fact, the rare cases of contigs
>1,000 bp (and/or comprising >1,000 reads) that exhibit
no BLAST hit against any of the reference species are
very likely to represent species-specific transcripts and
warrant additional investigation (Additional file 1, Table
S5). Indeed, only a handful of the 966 species-specific

Tzika et al. EvoDevo 2011, 2:19

transcripts give a significant BLAST hit against the ‘nr’
NCBI database, but they all (except 3 Trachemys
sequences) exhibit a substantial ORF spanning, on average, 250 nucleotides.

Comparisons with existing transcriptome datasets
Human and mouse databases

Phylogenetic distribution of BLAST hits

In Figure 2b, we show, for each sequenced species, the
distribution of consensus sequences in seven categories, corresponding to the seven reference species
against which consensus sequences were built.
Whereas 71% of the Gallus consensus sequences were
identified as Gallus transcripts, 11% generated a better
hit with Taeniopygia sequences, suggesting that part of
the zebra finch genome sequence might be of better
quality than that of the chicken. In addition, 19% of
the Gallus consensus sequences were assigned a best
BLAST hit with yet a more distantly-related species.
We assume that when the improved Gallus genome
assembly [54] becomes available in Ensembl, an even
greater percentage of best BLAST hits will be against
the chicken genome. Because of the absence of reference genome/transcriptome sequences for the four
other species, we expected the distribution of best
BLAST hits to somewhat reflect the evolutionary distances between each sequenced species, on one hand,
and each of the seven reference species, on the other
hand. As anticipated (given the classical suggested
grouping of crocodiles and birds into Archosauria), the
majority of Crocodylus transcripts were assigned a best
hit with a Gallus or Taeniopygia gene (33% and 24%,
respectively). Similarly, Anolis is the species against
which the largest number of Elaphe and Pogona transcripts exhibited a best BLAST hit, an expected result
given the grouping of lizards and snakes into the Squamata clade [29]. More surprisingly, Trachemys exhibits
the same pattern of BLAST-hits phylogenetic distribution as does Crocodylus, fueling the recent discussions
on the possible close phylogenetic relationship between
Testudines and Archosauria [55]. These evolutionary
links are strikingly supported when the orphan
sequences (that is, without a hit against any reference
species) of each Sauropsida species are aligned
(BLAST) against the built transcriptomes of the four
others (Figure 2c): a majority of Elaphe orphan transcripts exhibit a best hit with Pogona transcripts (and
vice versa), and a majority of Crocodylus orphan transcripts exhibit a best hit with Trachemys transcripts
(and vice versa). Because similarity between molecular
sequences is not only a function of the position of the
corresponding lineages in the phylogeny, but also of
the branch lengths of the gene tree, distances are
imperfect indicators of phylogenetic relationships. We
therefore performed extensive optimality-criterionbased phylogenetic analyses using massively-large

Because many of the consensus sequences corresponded
to Ensembl transcripts, we identified the human or
mouse homologs of these sequences (Table 4) using the
Ensembl v56 BioMart database [56]. Recently, it was
suggested that about 14,000 genes are expressed in the
human and mouse brains [31]; we detect expression of
an even greater number of genes in the brain of each of
the sequenced reptilian species (Table 4). It was also
suggested that 7,750 protein-coding genes are ubiquitously expressed across different human and mouse tissues and that the brain expresses one of the most
complex transcriptomes [31]. We find that 4,124 to
5,822 (depending on the species) of these genes have a
homolog in our sequenced transcriptomes, and that
2,595 of these genes are identified in all five species.
Similarly, 6,922 to 9,020 of our sequenced genes are
assigned as homologous to one of the 15,112 genes
listed in the ’Mouse Brain Gene Atlas’, an initiative aiming to identify, with cellular resolution, all genes
expressed in the mouse brain [57].
Avian and reptilian transcriptomes

The Ensembl Gallus genome contains about 18,000
genes, 9,515 of which we identified as partially
sequenced for the chicken brain, confirming the large
complexity of this organ’s transcriptome. Similarly,
when aligning (BLAST) all our chicken transcriptome
sequences against the full chicken Unigene database or
only the chicken brain Unigene database, we identified
61% or 82% of the known transcript clusters, respectively. These results show that a single deep-sequencing
run can provide a large overview of a species’ transcriptome in general, and a specific tissue transcriptome in
particular. Similarly, despite the substantial divergence
(about 150 million years of evolution) between Pogona
and Anolis, we identified 8,397 of the approximately
21,000 Anolis Ensembl genes in the bearded dragon
brain transcriptome. Given that the Anolis brain Unigene database mostly comprises EST libraries including
a large proportion of fast-evolving 3’ UTR sequences,
only 25% of our Pogona sequences matched one of
these Unigene clusters. In addition, among the 5,400 A.
missipiensis ESTs available from a testis and liver library
[24], 2,759 where hit by 2,000 of our 24,676 Crocodylus
consensuses and by 2,395 of our 60,580 Crocodylus
orphan sequences. This clearly demonstrates that (i) the
sequences reported here correspond to genuine transcripts even if BLAST searches against the seven reference species did not identify homology, and (ii) joining

Trachemys sequences BLAST-matched 587 (70%) of the
833 ESTs publicly available (NCBI) for that species.
Again, note that half of these sequences were orphans
when compared to the seven reference species.
Thamnophis elegans transcriptome

The consensus and orphan sequences of the four reptilian species were compared to the Thamnophis recentlypublished transcriptome (containing 96,379 contigs and
92,561 singletons) [27]. As expected, Elaphe was the
species with the greatest number of hits (15,121 consensus and 18,028 orphan sequences) thus reducing the
percentage of orphan sequences from 47% to 34%.
Although half of the Pogona consensus sequences had a
match with the Thamnophis transcriptome, only 937
orphans had a hit. It is thus likely that the Pogona
orphans represent fast-evolving sequences (like UTRs)
and lineage-specific genes. The results for Crocodylus
and Trachemys were similar to those of Pogona with,
respectively, 0.12% and 0.2% of the orphan sequences
matching the garter snake transcriptome.
Gene Ontology Annotation

We investigated gene ontology annotation using GOSSIP [58] through the BLAST2GO platform [59]. The
human homologs of the transcripts identified for each
of the five Sauropsida species were compared to the full
human gene set from Ensembl v56 for assessment of
potential over- or under-representation of biological
processes. Besides very obvious cases (such as the significant – False Discovery Rate <0.05 – under-representation in our brain transcriptomes of genes from the
‘immune system’ and ‘reproductive processes’ categories), the over- or under-representation of first-level
categories are generally difficult to interpret because
they comprise very diverse lower-level categories, and
each gene may belong to more than one category. On
the other hand, many of the lower-level categories

associated with central-nervous system functions are
over-represented in the brain transcriptome of one or
more of the species of interest (Figure 3). Note that the
significant under-representation of ‘neurological system
processes’ and ‘sensory perception’ genes in the brain
transcriptome of all five species is not as surprising as it
might seem. Indeed, these categories group genes that
are directly expressed in sensory organs rather than in
the central nervous system.
Identification of SSR loci and SNPs

It was long assumed that simple sequence repeats (SSRs
or microsatellites) were primarily associated with noncoding DNA, but it has now become clear that they are
frequently located in transcribed sequences. SSRs can
affect gene silencing and transcription, as well as mRNA
splicing, export, and translation, such that they probably
impact on organism development, adaptation, survival,
and evolution [60]. Screening of all our contigs and singletons yielded, per sequenced species, 7,378 to 15,986
SSRs made of 1 to 6 base-long repeats (that is, 0.07 to
0.12 microsatellite per sequence; Additional file 1, Table
S6). For all species, mononucleotides exceed all other
repeat types, except for Elaphe and Pogona that exhibited a similar number of mono- and dinucleotide
repeats. Frequencies of SSR categories decrease with
increasing repeat size, in contradiction with the suggested higher number of trinucleotide than dinucleotide
repeats in coding sequences [61]; but our dataset also
includes 3’ and 5’ UTRs which are not constrained by
codons. A/T and AC/GT are the most abundant monoand dinucleotide repeats, respectively, except for Elaphe
where AG/CT is the dominant dinucleotide. The prominent trinucleotide in Crocodylus is AAT/ATT, and
AGG/CCT for the remaining four species. The most frequent tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotides are (AT)-rich,
as reported for non-mammalian vertebrates [61,62].
By screening all our contigs, we initially identified
39,907 to 122,790 SNPs per sequenced species. However, given the risk of false positives (due to sequencing

errors), we constructed a high-confidence SNP set by
selecting only those with a minimum minor allele frequency of three (thus a minimum sequencing depth of
six). The number of high-confidence SNPs varied from
1,808 in Crocodylus to 18,710 in Pogona, and the greatest number (4.87) per contig was observed in Elaphe
(Additional file 1, Table S7). Similarly, we initially identified 51,719 to 127,926 insertion/deletion polymorphisms (indels) per sequenced species. Selecting only indel
sites with a minimum minor allele frequency of 3
reduces these numbers to 11,916 - 36,276. Note however that 14.3% to 18.8% of these were included in
homopolymers, hence, are low confidence indel sites
because pyrosequencing tends to generate insertion/

deletions errors when encountering homopolymers [63].
The high-confidence SNPs and Indels are all potential
valuable markers for linkage analyses.
Mitochondrial genomes

The mitochondrial sequences were assembled against
and compared with a reference mtDNA genome
sequence (NCBI) for each species. In all cases, our
assembly covered all mt genes except for 1 to 14 tRNAs
(depending on the species) and part of the control
region (Additional file 1, Table S8). Surprisingly, a large
portion of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 gene
was lacking in our Crocodylus and Pogona transcriptome
sequences. As expected, transitions outnumbered

Tzika et al. EvoDevo 2011, 2:19
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/2/1/19

transversions in the comparisons with the reference
conspecific sequence, and very few of the codingsequence mutations occurred at the second codon position (suggesting that all these substitutions are genuine
mtDNA SNPs).
Initial phylogeny inference

Reptilian phylogeny has been heavily debated, especially
regarding the placement of the Testudines (turtles)
clade. Indeed, given that they lack temporal skull openings (Anapsida condition), turtles have traditionally been
considered as the basal linage of amniotes [64,65], that
is, the sister group to those reptiles with two temporal
skull openings (Diapsida condition): Archosauria (crocodiles and birds) and Lepidosauria (tuatara, lizards, and
snakes). This view has recently been challenged by morphological analyses (for example, [66], but see [67,68])
suggesting that turtles may be diapsids that secondarily
lost skull temporal fenestration. Similarly, several molecular phylogenetic studies either suggested a sister relationship of turtles with a monophyletic Archosauria
(crocodiles and birds) [69-73], or joined crocodilians
with turtles to the exclusion of birds [74-76]. Potential
affinity of turtles and crocodilians has also been
observed when evaluating the history of amniote genomes and genomic signatures [35].
Here, we used our transcriptome sequence data for
performing maximum likelihood (ML) molecular phylogenetic analyses of very large multiple-sequence alignments to identify the placement of turtles within the
phylogeny of amniotes. The advantages of our approach
are twofold: the number of characters is exceptionally
large and character sampling is widely distributed across
the genome, reducing the risk of gene-specific biases
potentially present in previous analyses. The disadvantages of our dataset are its low species sampling and the
high error rates generated by low-depth sequencing.
For each of the 4,689 proteins identified in both the
crocodile and turtle transcriptomes, we performed a
multiple alignment with the homologous sequences
(when available) from each of our 3 other transcriptomes (corn snake, bearded dragon, and chicken) as well
as from 8 species in Ensembl v56: Anole lizard, zebra
finch, Western clawed frog, zebra fish, chicken, mouse,
human, and Platypus. This generated a 12-species multiple alignment with >3.3 million aa residues per species.
Note however that for many of the (incompletely)
sequenced proteins, residue positions can be lacking for
one or more of the 12 taxa, generating a mosaic dataset
with different species lacking different genes or portions
of them. Incomplete datasets must be analyzed with
caution because recent simulation studies indicate that
missing data can seriously affect the accuracy of phylogenetic estimates [77]. One effective solution is the

Page 12 of 18

removal of positions on the basis of both gap and similarity distributions in the alignment, that is, favoring the
removal of positions with most gaps and most divergent
residues. Using such an automated procedure (trimAl
[46]), we generated a 12-species alignment with
2,012,759 aa columns that we analyzed under ML (with
WAG substitution model) using RaxML [48]. This analysis generated a highly-supported tree topology with
turtles as the sister group to crocodiles (Figure 4a).
More drastically, we removed all columns including at
least one gap, that is, keeping only the characters represented in all 12 species, and generated an alignment of
only 1,612 columns. Analyses of this dataset using
RaxML or the meta-population Genetic Algorithm [50]
with MetaPIGA-2 [49] under the General-Time-Reversible (GTR) substitution model (with or without rate heterogeneity) all yield the same sister-group relationship
between crocodile and turtle (Figure 4a). Note however
that the RaxML analysis grouped birds with Lepidosauria instead of Archosauria. One solution for keeping
both a large number of characters and a small number
of missing data is to combine (hybridize) sequences
(Additional file 1, Figure S4) from species that clearly
form monophyletic groups. For example, combining the
two birds (Gallus and Taeniopygia), combining the two
non-amniote outgroup species (Danio and Xenopus),
and combining the three squamates (anole lizard,
bearded dragon, and corn snake), before removing gaps
from the alignment, generates a gap-free 8-terminal taxa
dataset with 24,071 aligned aa rather than a 12-species
dataset with 1,612 columns. RaxML and MetaPIGA analyses (GTR with rate heterogeneity) of this hybrid dataset again strongly group birds as the sister group to
[crocodile + turtle] (Figure 4b). Changing the species
priority within hybrid sequences (for example, favoring
Gallus to Taeniopygia) did not change the resulting
topology.
Phylogeny inference after removing paralogs

The meta-analyses performed above can still suffer from
a major problem: it is highly likely that some of the
sequences included in our multi-species multi-gene
alignments are paralogous, hence generating potential
artifacts (possibly with high support values) during phylogeny inference. In an attempt to exclude that problem,
we used MANTiS[47] to select, in our reptilian transcriptome dataset, the protein sequences for which the
corresponding gene in Danio, Xenopus, Anolis, Gallus,
Taeniopygia, Mus, Homo, and Platypus exhibits no
known paralog. Given that these eight genomes are of
high quality, it is likely that all paralogs have been identified such that our approach drastically reduces the risk
of comparing paralogs in the final alignment. Trimming
the selected aligned sequences using gap and similarity

distributions yielded a final alignment of 246,208 columns × 12 species. MetaPIGA analyses (GTR model
with or without rate heterogeneity) of this very large
dataset yield the tree in Figure 4c: remarkably, the
grouping of snake and bearded dragon (to the exclusion
of the anole lizard) observed in the previous analyses
(Figure 4a) disappears and is replaced by the traditional
grouping of the agamid and iguanid lizard families to
the exclusion of snakes, suggesting that indeed paralogous sequences generated an artifact in that portion of
the tree. Similarly, these MetaPIGA analyses excluding
paralogs do not group anymore turtles and crocodiles to
the exclusion of birds, but position turtles as the sistergroup to a monophyletic Archosauria (crocodiles +
birds). Note that the analysis of the same dataset under
RaxML (GTR and rate heterogeneity) still generated, in
our hands, long-branch attractions (corn snake +
bearded dragon as well as crocodile + turtle), possibly
because of the rate-heterogeneity approximations used
by this program.

Conclusions
We report here on the first large-scale comparative
analysis of transcriptomes across Sauropsida, a group
clearly more speciose than mammals. Such transcriptome resources will become increasingly important as
reptiles are emerging models for developmental
[37,78,79], as well as ecological and physiological, studies [4,80-84].
We show that our automated pipeline (LANErunner)
performing (i) recursive BLAST searches against both
Ensembl Coding (including genes predicted on the
basis of evidence from closely-related species) and Unigene (including ESTs) databases from reference species
covering a wide range of evolutionary distances, and
(ii) consensus building, is highly efficient compared to
less flexible available scripts. For example, the recent
analysis of a garter snake multi-individual and multiorgan transcriptome [27] identified 25% of the
assembled contigs and singletons, whereas we identified >50% of our corn snake non-redundant sequences.
In addition, the extensive use of the Ensembl database
gives easy access to other types of information, such as
gene ontology. Our dataset also provides an extensive
Sauropsida resource for microsatellite (SSRs) and polymorphic markers (despite the fact that we started from
a single individual brain for each species) for designing
population genetics or linkage studies. Finally, we used
our transcriptome data for generating very large
sequence alignments and performing extensive maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses (under the GTR
model of aa substitution with rate heterogeneity) to
elucidate the highly controversial phylogenetic position
of turtles.

Our data and analyses are not without limitations.
First, the use of brain tissue for transcriptome sequencing reduces, but does not necessarily eliminate, the
need for normalization. Most importantly, removal of
mitochondrial transcripts is warranted, either through
normalization or removal of these organelles. In addition, despite the fact that the brain exhibits one of the
most complex transcriptomes, dynamic range of mRNA
expression might be high enough to warrant normalization before de novo sequencing. Second, identifying the
presence of genes and transcripts does not equate with
building a phylome, that is, the complete set of gene
family trees across species (as performed in Ensembl
[85] or the PhylomeDB [86]). Phylomes are of great
interest in evolutionary biology because they allow rigorous differentiation of orthologs and paralogs, hence, the
identification of gene gains, duplications, and losses on
the species phylogenetic tree [47,87], as well as the
investigation of gene expression evolution [88-90]. However, data from low-depth sequencing (as used here) can
generate gene-tree building errors that, in turn, can
cause striking artifacts in gene duplication inference,
especially at the most recent common ancestor of lowcoverage genomes/transcriptomes [91]. Regarding species phylogeny inference, undetected sequencing errors
(probably partially responsible for the long terminal
branches of the corresponding taxa; Figure 4) might also
have generated artifactual grouping of long-branches
[92] as illustrated, in some analyses, by the incorrect
grouping of the bearded dragon lizard with the corn
snake to the exclusion of the green anole lizard (Figure
4a). In addition, given that we did not generate a phylome, it is likely that some of the sequences included in
our initial multi-species multi-gene alignments were
paralogous, hence, generating additional potential artifacts during phylogeny inference. In this respect, it is
remarkable that we could recover the correct grouping
of the bearded dragon lizard with the green anole lizard
to the exclusion of the corn snake, when performing
ML analyses (using a GTR model of aa substitution with
or without rate-heterogeneity inMetaPIGA-2; [49]) of a
large alignment of protein-coding genes with no known
paralogs in high-quality full genomes (Figure 4c). These
results suggest that the sister-group relationship of turtles with a monophyletic Archosauria (birds + crocodiles) uncovered under these settings (Figure 4c)
constitutes the best-supported phylogenetic position of
turtles, making them highly-derived diapsid reptiles
which secondarily lost their skull temporal fenestration.
Until additional deep-sequencing is performed, the
data and analyses reported here provide, for the major
lineages of Sauropsida (crocodiles, snakes and lizards,
turtles, and birds), identification of a majority of transcripts (for example, for future gene expression

analyses), detection of thousands of microsatellites,
thousands of SNP and indel polymorphisms (for example, for future quantitative genetics and population
genetic analyses), as well as yield the largest phylogenomic dataset to date for the investigation of a longstanding question: the phylogenetic position of turtles in
the vertebrate evolutionary tree. All developed software
