Abstract
Background: During mating, insect males eject accessory gland proteins (Acps) into the female genital tract. These
substances are known to affect female post-mating behavior and physiology. In addition, they may harm the
female, e.g., in reducing its lifespan. This is interpreted as a consequence of sexual antagonistic co-evolution.
Whereas sexual conflict abounds in non-social species, the peculiar life history of social insects (ants, bees, wasps)
with lifelong pair-bonding and no re-mating aligns the reproductive interests of the sexes. Harming the female
during mating would negatively affect male fitness and sexual antagonism is therefore not expected. Indeed,
mating appears to increase female longevity in at least one ant species. Acps are presumed to play a role in this
phenomenon, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In this study, we investigated genes, which are
preferentially expressed in male accessory glands of the ant Leptothorax gredleri, to determine which proteins
might be transferred in the seminal fluid.
Results: By a suppression subtractive hybridization protocol we obtained 20 unique sequences (USs). Twelve had
mutual best matches with genes predicted for Apis mellifera and Nasonia vitripennis. Functional information (Gene
Ontology) was available only for seven of these, including intracellular signaling, energy-dependent transport and
metabolic enzyme activities. The remaining eight USs did not match sequences from other species. Six genes were
further analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR in three life cycle stages of male ants. A gene with carboxy-lyase activity
and one of unpredicted function were significantly overexpressed in accessory glands of sexually mature males.
Conclusions: Our study is the first one to investigate differential gene expression in ants in a context related to
mating. Our findings indicate that male accessory glands of L. gredleri express a series of genes that are unique to
this species, possibly representing novel genes, in addition to conserved ones for which functions can be
predicted. Identifying differentially expressed genes might help to better understand molecular mechanisms
involved in reproductive processes in eusocial Hymenoptera. While the novel genes could account for rapidly
evolving ones driven by intra-sexual conflict between males, conserved genes imply that rather beneficial traits
might get fixed by a process described as inter-sexual cooperation between males and females.

Background
Substances produced by the male accessory glands
(MAGs) of insects and transferred into the female genital tract during mating are known to reduce pathogen
transmission, to form mating plugs or spermatophores,
and to be important in sperm competition. In addition,
they trigger fundamental changes in female physiology,
behavior, and reproduction [1-4]. The major biologically
active components of MAG secretions are carbohydrates, lipids, and in particular accessory gland proteins
(Acps) [1].
In Drosophila melanogaster, more than 100 Acps have
been identified [5]. They play roles in the regulation of
female receptivity [6-9], defense against bacteria [10],
the activation of the female immune system [11,12], the
efficiency of sperm storage [13,14], and the stimulation
of ovulation and egg maturation [6,8,9]. They are also
decisive for the fertilization of eggs, as shown in experiments in which the activity of sperm of infertile mutant
males lacking MAGs could be restored by subsequently
re-mating females with males that provided Acps but no
sperm [15].
In addition to stimulating immediate female fertility,
MAG products appear to negatively affect female lifespan [16,17]. This reflects inter-sexual conflict [18]: the
reproductive interests of males and females concerning
the consequences of a mating act may differ, in particular when females later re-mate with other partners.
Males prefer the female to maximize short-term investment into the offspring resulting from the present copulation, while females may benefit more from saving
resources for later reproduction with other males.
Sexual conflict may result in sexually antagonistic coevolution and Acps indeed appear to evolve very rapidly,
as predicted from the ensuing arms race [5,19-23].
Compared to the wealth of information on accessory
gland products of drosophilids, studies on other insect
species are seriously lagging behind [1]. This is particularly the case for eusocial Hymenoptera, despite the special implications that their life style and evolutionary
history have on sexual conflict. In contrast to Drosophila
and other non-social insects, eusocial Hymenoptera are
characterized by life-long pair-bonding, even though the
males frequently die after mating [24-26]. Investigations
have shown that monogamy is the ancestral state of all
truly eusocial organisms [27], and lifetime monogamy
seems to be a universal precondition for the evolution
of obligate eusociality [24,25]. The queens of ants, eusocial bees, and wasps indeed mate only once or a few
times early in their adult lives without ever re-mating
again. Sperm received during these matings is stored for
months, years, or even decades, and utilized to fertilize
eggs throughout the queens’ lives. Furthermore, queens

Page 2 of 9

first rear large numbers of sterile workers from fertilized
eggs before switching to the production of female sexuals. Hence, in contrast to males of non-social insects,
eusocial insect males are expected to avoid harming the
female, as this would reduce the total amount of female
sexuals produced and, consequently, male reproductive
success. Instead, males should have evolved mechanisms
that promote female performance. Even where multiple
mating has evolved after the monogamy window has
been passed, competition among ejaculates [28] is not
expected to negatively affect female life span and future
fecundity. Inter-sexual conflict might thus be replaced
by “inter-sexual cooperation”, though intra-sexual conflict might still evolve. Indeed, ant males appear to positively affect queen life span: regardless of being mated
with a fertile or sterilized male, mated queens of Cardiocondyla obscurior lived considerably longer than virgin
queens [29].
Like in other insects, MAG products of eusocial
Hymenoptera are involved in the formation of mating
plugs [30-32] and ejaculate (or eventually sperm) competition [28,33]. In addition, they presumably elicit rapid
changes in the physiology and behavior of freshly mated
queens, e.g., the shedding of wings, reluctance of mating
again, and changes in cuticular hydrocarbons [34]. It is
likely that MAG products, and in particular Acps, are
also involved in the life-prolonging effects of mating
[29]. Nevertheless, very little is known about Acps in
eusocial Hymenoptera other than the honey bee, Apis
mellifera [35-38]. We therefore examined, which genes
are differentially expressed in the male accessory glands
of the ant Leptothorax gredleri.
Virgin queens of L. gredleri attract males through
“female calling”, i.e., they climb up grass stems or similar, elevated positions near their maternal nests and
release droplets of a sex pheromone from their poison
glands [39-41]. During mating, sperm is transferred
within a gelatinous substance, functionally similar to a
spermatophore. The latter stays inside the female’s genital tract for several hours, while the sperm is slowly
transferred into the spermatheca [42]. Females have
been observed to copulate with multiple males but it is
unclear whether ejaculate is transferred during all these
matings. Genetic analyses document single paternity of
their offspring [40].
In order to obtain information on gene products specifically produced by the accessory glands of L. gredleri males
we generated a suppression subtractive library for transcripts using a Representational Difference Analysis (RDA)
protocol. Such an approach enriches tissue-specific transcripts (here: MAGs) by removing from the library
sequences that are shared with control tissue (here: the
body of the males after excision of MAGs).

Results
RDA library characteristics and bioinformatic analyses

To detect differentially expressed genes in L. gredleri
MAGs, we sequenced 192 clones from the subtracted
gland library, resulting in 288 sequencing reads, of
which 158 reads representing 130 different clones were
of appropriate quality (Phred quality ≥ 20). After quality
analysis and following CAP3 assembly we obtained 12
contigs and 8 singlets as Unique Sequences (USs). The
sequences were submitted to GenBank (accession numbers GT897811 until GT897966).
BLASTx analyses of the USs (Table 1) revealed significant matches (E-scores < e-5, a cut-off level frequently
used in EST projects; [43]) for 12 USs. The remaining

8USs showed no significant matches to genes of other
species.
Most of the ESTs (40) clustered to a sequence corresponding to an Apis mellifera predicted gene similar to
CG1486-PA. Based on domain predictions, the fly ortholog
of this gene is annotated in Flybase as being involved in
carboxylic acid metabolism. Another US represented by
12 ESTs showed similarity to a heat shock factor binding
protein 1-like from Apis mellifera, with the corresponding
CG5446-PA in Drosophila melanogaster. Further USs were
also formed by clustering considerable numbers of ESTs
(Table 1), such as US4 consisting of 28 ESTs, and US3
composed of 10 ESTs. None of these transcripts, however,
presented matches when submitted to BLASTx analysis.

In functional terms, the searches for orthologs
revealed that, seven of the L. gredleri USs corresponded
to functionally defined genes (Table 1), with best hits to
predicted A. mellifera proteins. By judging from Gene
Ontology attributes, two are expected to be involved in
energy-dependent transport processes, such as the ATP
synthase gamma chain and Nervana 2, a sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit. The Leukocyte-antigen-related-like protein may function as a protein
tyrosine phosphatase, while the kokopelli gene has a
cyclin-dependent protein kinase regulator activity and is
involved in male germ-line stem cell division. The final
two sequences with predicted molecular functions are
CG6910-PA, with inositol oxygenase activity, and an
Apis mellifera ribosomal protein LP1 (RpLP1) given as
being a structural constituent of ribosomes.
Still unknown are biological processes or molecular
functions for the five remaining sequences with BLASTx
matches. SJCHGC05576 and LOC100123166 are both
predicted proteins of the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis, and Ciao-1 and CG32432-PA and heat shock
factor binding protein 1-like are predicted proteins for
A. mellifera. Neither of these had matches with Drosophila genes.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of RDA library genes

The RDA method is applicable to systems where genomic information is either completely lacking or still in
an incipient stage. RDAs are able to detect both known
and so far unknown transcripts, including regulatory
RNAs. However, being a high throughput approach,
transcripts indicated by RDA as differentially expressed
should be further analyzed by specific gene-expression
analyses, such as quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR).
Thus, we designed gene-specific primers for 19 of the
20 RDA products. One product contained repeats, and
so it was not considered suitable for primer design. For
six of the 19 products we obtained primers, shown in

Table 2, that reliably amplified specific products and,
thus, were suitable for qRT-PCR. These were primers
for the genes leukocyte-antigen-related-like (leukocyte)
and CG1486, representing two genes with BLASTx
matches and predicted functions, for ciao-1 and
CG32432, being genes with matches but of unknown
function, and the final two being for US3 and US7,
representing no-match sequences.
For five of the six genes we could show that their
mean transcript levels are at least two-times higher in
the L. gredleri MAGs relative to body carcasses, this
holding for all three of the analyzed male life cycle
stages, except for ciao-1 in the males running outside
the nest that were sexually mature (males outside nests)
samples (Figure 1). For the sixth gene, US7, overexpression was not validated. This may, thus, represent false
positive RDA identification, represented by a single
sequencing read (Table 1).
When testing for statistical significance of differential
expression by randomization tests built into REST software we could show significant overexpression in two
genes. CG1486, a gene with predicted carboxy-lyase
activity, was not only represented by the highest number
of ESTs (Table 1), but was also confirmed as significantly overexpressed in MAGs of dark-pigmented male
pupae (male pupae; P = 0.010) and sexually mature
males (males outside nests; P = 0.015). The other gene,
CG32432, was shown to be significantly overexpressed
in sexually mature males (P = 0.037) (Figure 1). For all
of these five genes biological variation in expression
levels was considerable, a problem frequently encountered in qRT-PCR analyses, even with highly controlled
cell cultures [44].

Discussion and conclusions
Using the RDA method we successfully identified a set
of 20 genes as being differentially expressed in MAGs of
the ant L. gredleri. Unfortunately, a fully sequenced ant

Gene expression in male accessory glands
(log2 - relative to bodies)

Figure 1 Gene expression in male accessory glands. Relative expression of leukocyte-antigen-related-like, CG1486, ciao-1, CG32432, US3 and
US7 transcripts in male accessory glands of the ant Leptothorax gredleri relative to body carcasses. The y-axis, drawn through 1, corresponds to
the expression level in the body carcass (control tissue) of the respective life cycle stage, these being late male pupae, males inside nests and

genome is not yet available, so an annotation against a
genome was not feasible. Such an annotation would be
needed to identify proteins that are secreted into the
lumen of L. gredleri MAGs, as their RNAs should have
hydrophobic amino-terminal signal sequences [45]. For
example, Swanson et al. [22] found that 24% of the 212
identified genes in their study of Drosophila male reproductive proteins have such a putative signal sequence.
All best hit matches were against A. mellifera or
N. vitripennis predicted genes, emphasizing the importance of these hymenopteran reference genomes in future
gene expression studies in eusocial insects. Nevertheless,
most of our ESTs represented functionally undefined
genes or ones without matches to known genes. At first
sight, this might indicate rapid evolution and species specificity in MAG secretion products, similar to what has
been shown for MAGs of Drosophila [22], where about
50% of the Drosophila Acps have no homologs outside
the drosophilid species complex. When comparing the
genes predicted to be differentially expressed in MAGs of
L. gredleri with those identified in a proteome analysis of
honey bee seminal fluid [38] we did not find any matching gene products for the set with GeneOntology functional attributes. This finding would also be in favor of a
rapid evolution hypothesis for MAG products. Queens of
Leptothorax are predominantly singly-mated [40,46], but

occasional multiple mating might introduce intra-sexual
conflict and thus increase the evolutionary tempo of
seminal fluid proteins. In eusocial species with multiple
mating, the beneficial effect of seminal fluid on sperm
survival is reduced when seminal fluid is mixed with
alien sperm [28]. However, this may actually serve the
interests of the queen rather than inflicting damage.
Furthermore, the queen appears to be in control of ejaculate competition, since the negative impact of seminal
fluid on foreign sperm can be neutralized by secretions
from the queen sperm-storage organ [28]. In this case,
intra-sexual conflict seems to be controlled by inter-sexual cooperation.
Concerning our studies, nothing is as yet known on
the molecular nature of MAG secretions of other ant
species, and with Apis mellifera and Nasonia vitripennis
being the closest species for genomic comparisons, the
percentage of functionally undefined genes and of nomatch ESTs might simply reflect the large phylogenetic
distance separating ants, bees, and parasitic wasps. Speculating about the speed of the evolution of L. gredleri
Acps would, at this point, be premature, especially
since, 2D-electrophoreses of Acps suggest that they are
conserved in L. gredleri and related taxa relative to, e.g.,
muscle proteins (M. Fuessl, A. Oppelt, J. Heinze,
unpublished).

Oppelt et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:273
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/273

Furthermore, not all seminal fluid genes can be subject to rapid evolution, because successful reproduction
must be assured. In a cross-species comparison of Drosophila MAG protein encoding genes, Mueller et al. [23]
found not only rapidly evolving but also conserved
genes, and functionally similar proteins may be represented and relevant in the seminal fluid of other animals
[4]. Members of protein classes conserved across organisms in seminal fluids may reflect their general importance in reproductive physiology [4] and might therefore
be beneficial for both males and females. In this context,
immune defense proteins are of special interest. MAGs
secrete proteins of antimicrobial activity [10] and
proteins, which regulate the expression of genes with
antimicrobial activity in females after sperm transfer
[11,12,47]. Such Acps might successively protect sperm
from microbial attack in the reproductive tracts of
both sexes, as well as coat eggs when they are laid.
A L. gredleri EST, whose ortholog CG6910 is known to
be upregulated in D. melanogaster females after mating
[47], might play such a role. The Drosophila gene is
annotated as possibly showing oxidoreductase activity
and being downregulated after bacterial infection. For
the elucidation of its function in ants, it should be
of interest to see whether the gene similar to CG6910
is also differentially expressed in virgin and mated
L. gredleri queens. Females are not ‘silent partners’
when it comes to seminal fluids and it is always an
interplay of male and female factors that coordinates the
gametes for fertilization [1,28,48].
The CG32432 protein predicted in the honey bee
genome as a Drosophila ortholog with undefined function was found to be significantly overexpressed in
sexually mature L. gredleri males, and one gene similar
to CG1486-PA was found to be overexpressed in two
male life cycle stages. This latter protein is predicted
to have a carboxy-lyase activity and might be involved
in carboxylic acid metabolism, catalyzing the nonhydrolytic addition or removal of a carboxyl group to
or from a compound. Carboxylic acids are widespread
in nature, giving rise to fatty acids. Fatty acids, such as
palmitic-, linoleic-, oleic-, and stearic-acids, have been
described as components of the mating plug in the
bumblebee Bombus terrestris, which form a physical
barrier [30] and prevent re-mating [31]. Mating plugs
were also found in fire ants [32], queenless Dinoponera
ants [49], attine ants [50], stingless bees [51], and in
the honey bee. In the latter, however, they do not play
a function as a plug, but rather as a mating sign that
may even promote multiple matings [52]. In L. gredleri,
the existence of a spermatophore that could be comparable to a mating plug was already shown [42]. The
overexpression of a gene with carboxy-lyase activity in
the late pupal stage, when the accessory glands are

Page 6 of 9

already formed, and in sexually mature males found
outside the nest supports the idea that accessory gland
products are crucial for spermatophore formation in
this species.
Taken together, our current study represents a first
step addressing at a molecular level the reproductive
interplay between L. gredleri males and their mates.
MAG products identified in this study may play different roles, either as conserved or as species-specific
proteins.
Understanding the molecular underpinnings of differences in reproductive strategies among non-social and
eusocial species, and in the latter among monogamous
(the majority of ants bees and wasps) and polygamous
ones (e.g. the honey bees) will still require sequencing of
MAG products in a range of species. Nevertheless, we
believe that at this interface of “molecular communication” between the sexes, much can be gained towards
comprehending the evolution of eusociality at the passage through the monogamy window [25,28], with intersexual conflict being replaced by inter-sexual
cooperation.

Methods
Colony collection and male dissection

Colonies of Leptothorax gredleri Mayr 1855 (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) were collected from nest-sites at the
edge of an abandoned army drill ground in Erlangen,
Germany (49° 35′ 09′′ N, 11° 02′ 02′′ E). Each single colony was transferred into a three-chamber plastic box
with a cavity between two microscope slides serving as a
nest. Colonies were kept under standard rearing conditions [53,54] until they produced sexuals.
Males were dissected in chilled Beadle solution (128.3
mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, and 2.3 mM CaCl2; [55]). The
accessory glands were separated and the seminal ducts
were removed. The intestine was removed to avoid contamination of libraries with microorganismal RNA and
then the rest of the body served as reference tissue.
Glands and the remaining body carcass were stored
separately in RNAlater® (Ambion) for subsequent RNA
extraction. For library preparations, 40 pairs of glands
were pooled for a single sample, to be subtracted against
the carcasses of 20 bodies.
For qRT-PCR analyses we dissected male pupae ready
to eclose, when they are already dark pigmented (male
pupae), newly eclosed males collected from within the
nest (males inside nests), and males running outside the
nest that were sexually mature (males outside nests).
Each sample consisted of at least 20 pairs of glands, to
be compared against corresponding body carcasses. As
the real time RT-PCR analyses were carried out as quintuplicates, this represented biological material of more
than 100 males per life cycle stage.

Representational difference analysis

RNA of both the glands and the remaining body from
males (collected from within nests) was extracted with
TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
standard protocol. We used 2 μg of each RNA sample
to generate the cDNA library. Reverse transcription and
long distance PCR were carried out by employing the
SMART PCR cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech), resulting
in double-stranded cDNA.
For suppression subtractive hybridization we employed
a cDNA RDA [56] adapted for applications in insects
[57]. This strategy removes transcripts shared by the
driver and tester populations and enriches the tester
library for differentially expressed genes. An accessory
gland library was generated using cDNA of accessory
glands as the tester population. The latter was hybridized against cDNA of the remaining body carcass as
the driver population. Double-stranded cDNAs (1 μg)
were restriction digested with MboI (New England
BioLabs), ligated to R-adapters [57], and PCR amplified
following the protocol of Hubank and Schatz [58] to
generate the respective cDNA representations. Enrichment of differentially expressed transcripts was achieved
in two successive rounds of PCR amplifications that
employed different adapters (J and N) and sequential
subtractive hybridizations of the tester to an excess of
driver cDNA, first in a 1:100 and then in a 1:800 ratio
[58]. After each of these successive steps, cDNAs were
purified (Illustra GFX PCR purification kit, GE).
cDNA from the accessory gland library after the
second round of selection was used for ligation into
pGEM®-T Easy Vector System (Promega) and transformation of E. coli DH5a chemocompetent cells. The
cells were reared on solid LB containing ampicillin,
X-Gal and IPTG. Selected clones were grown in liquid
LB medium containing ampicillin. For the sequencing,
the cells were lysed and the plasmids extracted and
sequenced using Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Ready Reaction (Applied Biosystems) with M13 primers
on an ABI-PRISM 3100 (Applied Biosystems) automated
gene analyzer.
Bioinformatic analysis

By means of the E-Gene annotation pipeline [59],
sequencing reads were first filtered to detect and remove
ribosomal RNAs and mitochondrial DNA. Subsequently,
vector sequences were trimmed using Crossmatch. Read
quality was checked and reads were assembled by the
Phred-Phrap program module. Reads that had passed
the quality check were next submitted to CAP3 assembly [60] to obtain USs. All contigs, and singlets were
dynamically translated and compared by BLASTx to a
non-redundant (nr) database (GenBank). ESTs with
similarities to genes of known function in other

Page 7 of 9

organisms were clustered using Gene Ontology (GO)
terms [61] attributed to their respective Drosophila
orthologs. GO attributes were retrieved from the Flybase
server http://flybase.org.
Differential gene expression analysis by quantitative
RT-PCR

For real time qRT-PCR analysis, gene-specific primers
were designed for a set of selected USs using Gene Runner version 3.05 and Primer3 softwares.
As reference gene we chose elongation factor 1-alpha
(elf1-a), a recommended control gene for honey bee
qRT-PCR studies [62]. To obtain an L. gredleri sequence
for elf1-a we aligned the corresponding sequences of
Leptothorax muscorum (a direct sister species to L. gredleri) and Temnothorax rugatulus (a more distantly
related ant species) (GenBank accession numbers
ABK54792.1 and ABK54711.1, respectively) and
designed primers to a conserved region. An L. gredleri
elf1-a fragment was cloned and sequenced, and qRTPCR suitable primers were designed (Table 2). For the
qRT-PCR analyses, we used male pupae, males inside
nests and males outside nests. Each sample consisted of
a least 20 male bodies or glands. RNA of the glands and
remaining bodies carcasses was extracted using TRIzol.
The RNA samples were treated with 0.1 U DNaseI
(Invitrogen) for 40 min to eliminate possible DNA contamination. First strand cDNA was produced using a
SuperScript II (Invitrogen) protocol at 42°C for 50 min
and 70°C for 15 min.
Quality and annealing temperatures of the gene-specific primers were tested in a temperature-gradient PCR
protocol run in a PTC200 thermal cycler (MJ Research).
Product length varied from 305 bp for elf1-a to 98 bp
for the shortest of the L. gredleri singlets.
Subsequently, a dilution series was analyzed for each
primer pair using a composite cDNA sample from
bodies and glands of all stages in order to obtain standard curves for determining primer efficiencies. These
and subsequent qRT-PCR amplifications were performed by using a SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems)
protocol in an ABI Prism 7500 system (Applied Biosystems). The amplification protocol was 50°C for 2 min,
95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for
1 min. Subsequently, dissociation curves were acquired
to check melting peak quality. For each life-cycle time
point we ran five biological replicates, each assayed in
technical triplicates, both for accessory glands and body
carcasses.
Threshold cycle (Ct) values for each technical replicate
were used to calculate 2 -ΔΔCt values [63] using the
means of the five body carcass replicates of each life
cycle stage for normalization of the respective gland
samples. For statistical analysis, Ct values were used as

were considered as statistically significant.
