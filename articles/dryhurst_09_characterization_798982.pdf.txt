Abstract
Background: Within chromatin, the histone variant H2A.Z plays a role in many diverse nuclear
processes including transcription, preventing the spread of heterochromatin and epigenetic
transcriptional memory. The molecular mechanisms of how H2A.Z mediates its effects are not
entirely understood. However, it is now known that H2A.Z has two protein isoforms in
vertebrates, H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2, which are encoded by separate genes and differ by 3 amino
acid residues.
Results: We report that H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 are expressed across a wide range of human
tissues, they are both acetylated at lysine residues within the N-terminal region and they exhibit
similar, but nonidentical, distributions within chromatin. Our results suggest that H2A.Z-2
preferentially associates with H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 compared to H2A.Z-1. The phylogenetic
analysis of the promoter regions of H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 indicate that they have evolved
separately during vertebrate evolution.
Conclusions: Our biochemical, gene expression, and phylogenetic data suggest that the H2A.Z-1
and H2A.Z-2 variants function similarly yet they may have acquired a degree of functional
independence.

Background
In the eukaryotic cell, the template for all DNA metabolic
activities including DNA repair, replication, recombination and transcription, is chromatin. Chromatin is a
nucleoprotein complex in which approximately 147 base
pairs of DNA are wrapped around a histone core consisting of two each of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and
H4, resulting in a repetitive structure called the nucleosome. Linker histones of the H1 family bind to the linker
DNA regions connecting adjacent nucleosomes in the
chromatin fiber. Histones represent the major protein
component of chromatin and most of the synthesis of the
canonical forms takes place during S phase of the cell cycle
to allow for efficient packaging of the newly replicated
DNA. In contrast, a subset of histone variants is synthesized throughout the cell cycle and can replace canonical
histones to specify chromatin domains for specific functions [1,2]. Histone H2A.Z is one such replacement histone variant and while it is very widely studied, its
structural and functional roles have not only proven to be
many and diverse but also controversial [2,3].
From a functional perspective, histone H2A.Z has been
found to be present in heterochromatin, where it participates in the formation of pericentric and centric chromatin, [4,5] and in euchromatin [6,7], where it is usually
found associated with promoters of active genes [8].
Recent work has revealed that promoters are marked by
complexes that contain H2A.Z in conjunction with the
H3.3 variant indicating that replication-independent histone variant replacement plays a role in generating an
appropriate chromatin landscape at these loci [9]. The
concept that H2A.Z serves to poise promoters for transcriptional activation but is displaced from chromatin
once transcription is initiated has been widely documented [10-13].
Recently, another very interesting function has been
ascribed to H2A.Z, which is that it aids in localizing genes
to the nuclear periphery and in doing so marks them for
more rapid reactivation even after several cell divisions
[14]. Many of these functions of H2A.Z, although seemingly very different, may not be entirely unrelated in a
broad sense if H2A.Z is considered a mark that is required
to specify the nuclear location of a given region of the
genome perhaps with respect to the nuclear periphery, or
the nuclear matrix in general.
At the structural level, H2A.Z has been shown to enhance
the stability of the nucleosome [15,16] despite the fact
that the H2A.Z-H2B dimer exhibits a reduced stability
compared to H2A-H2B dimers [16,17]. H2A.Z has also
been shown to alter nucleosome mobility [18]. When
present in nucleosome arrays, H2A.Z increases the
intramolecular interactions and promotes HP1α-medi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/86

ated folding of the fiber [19,20]. Furthermore, several
well-positioned H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes flank
sites occupied by the insulator binding protein CTCF
which prevents the spread of heterochromatin [21].
How H2A.Z is able to participate in these many cellular
events could be based on whether it is placed within isolated nucleosomes or within contiguous stretches of chromatin, as is the case at many polycomb group genes in
embryonic stem cells [22]. Alternatively, post translational modifications shown to exist on H2A.Z, including
acetylation, ubiquitination and SUMOylation, may direct
certain populations of H2A.Z for a specific function.
Recently, we identified the presence of two H2A.Z protein
isoforms in chicken that differ by 3 amino acids [23]. Our
group has also provided evidence of distinct phylogenetic
patterns for the H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 variants during vertebrate evolution [24]. Importantly, H2A.Z is the only histone variant that has been shown to be indispensable for
survival in Drosophila [25] and mice [26]. However, in
this latter study, only H2A.Z-1 was knocked out. This indicates that H2A.Z-2 is incapable of compensating for the
loss of H2A.Z-1 in mice. Whether this is because of lower
amounts of total H2A.Z or because of differences in the
nuclear localization, post translational modification, biochemical interactions or temporal expression of the
H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 genes is unknown. In the present
work, we show that both isoforms are expressed across a
wide range of human tissues and that they display a similar nuclear distribution and levels of N-terminal acetylation. Furthermore, we show that the distribution of
H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 within chromatin differs, as does
their association with histone H3 trimethylated at lysine
4. Despite the high degree of amino acid sequence similarity between these H2A.Z isoforms, they display very divergent promoter sequences that could result in temporal
and tissue-specific differences in gene expression.

Results
The N-terminal tails of H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 are
acetylated in vivo in chicken cells
We employed a mass spectrometric approach in order to
determine if the N-terminal tail of H2A.Z-1 is acetylated in
vivo in a similar way to the recently described acetylation
of the same region in H2A.Z-2 [27]. Total H2A.Z protein
was purified from chicken erythrocytes and sodium
butyrate-treated MSB cells by a combination of gel filtration chromatography and RP-HPLC. Purified H2A.Z was
then derivatized with propionic anhydride to limit trypsin
digestion to arginine residues as previously described
[27]. The H2A.Z peptides were next analysed by LC-coupled tandem mass spectrometry which enabled sequence
determination of the first 19 residues of both H2A.Z-1
(AGGKAGKDSGKTKTKAVSR) and H2A.Z-2 (AGGKAG-

KDSGKAKAKAVSR). This technique also afforded the
identification of multiple acetylation sites on both of the
N-terminal peptides from the sodium butyrate-treated
sample. Figure 1A and 1B illustrate the mass spectrometry
(MS/MS) spectra of the most abundant form of the N-terminal peptide identified in the sodium butyrate-treated
sample which was a triply-acetylated form with acetylation present on K4, K7 and K11. In fact, four different
forms of the H2A.Z-1 N-terminal peptide were detected,
similar to those previously described for H2A.Z-2 [27].
Selected ion chromatograms, shown in Figure 1C, illustrate the presence and abundance of the unmodified, singly-acetylated, doubly-acetylated and triply-acetylated
peptides from both H2A.Z isoforms. Albeit at lower relative abundance, doubly-acetylated species were also
enriched in this sample and include forms concurrently
acetylated at K4 + K7, K7 + K11 and K4 + K11 for both isoforms. Singly-acetylated species were also detected but
were present at significantly lower abundance and, as a
consequence, the acetylation sites were not able to be
determined for these forms. However, it is likely that they
are very similar to those previously determined for H2A.Z2, since all other modified forms are also very similar for
both isoforms.
H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 are mainly distributed in
euchromatin in mouse fibroblasts and in HEK 293 cells
In order to determine the pattern of H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z2 distribution within chromatin, asynchronous mouse
embryonic fibroblasts were transfected with YFP-H2A.Z-2
and CFP-H2A.Z-1 and imaged live (Figure 2). Figure 2
indicates that YFP-H2A.Z-2 (top right panel) and CFPH2A.Z-1 (bottom left panel) have a near identical distribution throughout chromatin. The composite image
showing Hoechst DNA staining (green) and YFP-H2A.Z-2
(red) indicates H2A.Z-2 is preferentially located within
regions of euchromatin (orange). However, since both
variants localize to the same regions, it stands that H2A.Z1 would also be mainly present in euchromatic regions.
Both variants, however, are also present within the DNAdense chromocenters, as shown by their yellow staining in
the composite image. To ensure that the transfected proteins were able to be incorporated into nucleosomes,
chromatin from these cells was isolated, digested with
microccocal nuclease and separated on sucrose gradients
in order to obtain mononucleosomes [28]. Western blot
analysis of these mononucleosomes with an anti-GFP
antibody confirmed the incorporation of the transfected
H2A.Z variants (data not shown).

In order to analyse the distribution of H2A.Z variants
within chromatin biochemically, C-terminal Flag epitope
tagged H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 were stably transfected into
HEK 293 cells, nuclei were isolated and digested with
microccocal nuclease and the chromatin was separated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/86

into S1, SE and Pellet fractions. The stably transfected
clones that were selected had nearly identical expression
levels of the respective Flag-tagged H2A.Z that represented
less than 30% of the total endogenous H2A.Z (Figure 3A
and data not shown). The highly nuclease-accessible and
low salt soluble S1 fraction contains mainly mononucleosomes having a DNA length of approximately 146 bp
that generally represents active chromatin, while the more
nuclease-resistant SE fraction contains mainly repressed
chromatin with DNA of varying lengths (Figure 3B) [29].
The insoluble Pellet fraction most likely represents a mixture of transcriptionally active and repressed chromatin
that is insoluble due to its association with large protein
complexes such as the RNA Pol II and chromatin remodelling complexes or components of the nuclear matrix
(Figure 3B) [29]. This fraction contains far fewer histones
compared to other high molecular weight proteins. Western blot analysis of the histones extracted from these fractions, using an antibody against H2A.Z that does not
discriminate between the variants, indicates that total
endogenous H2A.Z (bottom band, arrow 1) is present in
all three chromatin fractions but is more abundant in the
S1 and SE compared to the P (Figure 3A). This antibody is
also able to detect the Flag-tagged H2A.Z proteins (top
band, arrow 2) and indicates that, although these forms
fractionate similarly to the endogenous forms, the H2A.Z2-Flag protein is present in higher amounts in the S1 fraction. This pattern can also be seen when the blot is probed
with an anti-Flag antibody (Figure 3A). These blots were
further probed with an antibody against total H4 as a
loading control and against H3 trimethylated at lysine 4
(H3 Tri-Me K4). Staining with the latter antibody indicates that this modification does not partition equally
among the fractions, but is proportionally more abundant
within the pellet fraction. Since H3 Tri-Me K4 is a marker
of promoter regions of active genes, this result is in agreement with the notion that the Pellet fraction contains
genomic regions that are actively being transcribed.
H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 associate with different forms of
post-translationally modified H3 and H4 within the
nucleosome
We next sought to determine if the H2A.Z variants differentially associate with several post-translationally modified forms of other histones within the nucleosome.
Following the protocol of Sarcinella and colleagues [30],
C-terminal Flag-tagged versions of H2A.Z-1, H2A.Z-2 and
H2A as a control were transiently expressed in HeLa cells
and the chromatin was digested to mononucleosomes
using micrococal nuclease. Each preparation of mononucleosomes was analysed on native acrylamide gels in
order to ensure complete digestion of the chromatin (data
not shown). The nucleosomes containing the Flag-tagged
proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-Flag agarose beads and the specificity of the immunoprecipitations

was monitored by AUT-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Figure 4A). Figure 4A shows that the immunoprecipitations are specific for H2A-Flag, H2A.Z-2-Flag or
H2A.Z-1-Flag containing nucleosomes. The identity of
these histones was further confirmed by two-dimensional
PAGE with an acid-urea-triton (AUT) gel in the first
dimension followed by a sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)
gel in the second dimension (Figure 4B). Figure 4A also
indicates that a proportion of both the H2A.Z-1-Flag and
H2A.Z-2-Flag nucleosomes only contain one copy of the
tagged protein in the histone octamer, as an H2A band
with equal staining intensity is also present in the gel. In
order to confirm this result, SDS-PAGE followed by a
Western blot using an anti-H2A antibody was performed
on the histones from the immunoprecipitated mononucleosomes and is shown in the bottom panels of Figure
4A. Bands corresponding to H2A are present in all three
normalized mononucleosome preparations but with a
higher intensity in the H2A.Z-2-Flag and H2A.Z-1-Flag
nucleosomes (Figure 4A, bottom panels). The presence of
these heterotypic H2A.Z nucleosomes has been previously
documented in HeLa cells by mass spectrometry [31]. The
histones of the immunoprecipitated nucleosomes that
were normalized with respect to total H4 were resolved by
SDS-PAGE and transferred to membranes which were
probed with antibodies specific for several post-translationally modified forms of histones (Figure 4C). Both
forms of H2A.Z nucleosomes are enriched in H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 compared to H2A nucleosomes as
shown by other groups (Figure 4C) [30,31]. However, this
enrichment is greater in the case of the H2A.Z-2-Flag
nucleosomes than in the H2A.Z-1-Flag nucleosomes. The
promoters of most protein coding genes contain nucleosomes that have the H3 Tri-Me K4 mark along with H3
acetylated at K9 and K14 [32,33]. When the immunoprecipitated nucleosomes were probed with an antibody
against this latter H3 modification, roughly equal
amounts can be seen in the H2A-Flag, H2A.Z-2-Flag and
H2A.Z-1-Flag nucleosomes (Figure 4C). H3 trimethylated

at lysine 27 is a marker of inactive promoters and mediates transcriptional silencing [34]. The levels of this modification are relatively equal among all the Flag
immunoprecipitated nucleosomes (Figure 4C). Similarly,
the levels of H4 acetylated at lysine 16 are equal among
nucleosomes. Interestingly, H2A.Z-1-Flag and H2A.Z-2Flag nucleosomes are enriched in H3 phosphorylated at
serine 10 compared to H2A-Flag nucleosomes. This pattern was also seen when the transfected cells were arrested
in mitosis by nocodazole treatment before generation of
mononucleosomes and immunoprecipitation. It is possible that the majority of the H3PhosS10 staining in the
asynchronous cells could be due to the proportion of
mitotic cells within that population. This is probably the
case, since the staining intensity is increased in mitotic
H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 nucleosomes.
H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 are differentially expressed among
tissues
In order to compare the levels of H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2
mRNA expression in different tissues and in HeLa cells, we
performed quantitative polymerase reaction (PCR) on a
panel of adult and fetal human tissue samples. Primers
were designed that specifically amplify the cDNA of either
H2A.Z isoform based on substantial sequence differences
within the untranslated regions (UTRs). The specificity of
the PCR reaction was monitored by DNA sequencing of
the amplicons and by melting curve analysis. The highest
levels of H2A.Z transcripts were seen in HeLa cells and in
the testes (Figure 5). Figure 5 also shows that the levels of
H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 transcript expression were similar
in several adult tissues, including testes, ovary, prostate,
peripheral blood leukocytes, small intestine, pancreas and
HeLa cells. The adult brain showed approximately four
times more H2A.Z-1 transcript than H2A.Z-2. A twofold
increase in H2A.Z-2 transcript levels over H2A.Z-1 was
seen in the adult liver and kidney. The widest range of
expression levels between tissues for each variant was fivefold (liver versus testes) for H2A.Z-1 and fivefold (brain

versus testes) for H2A.Z-2. In order to determine if the
expression levels of the H2A.Z variants differed depending
on developmental stage, we also analysed their expression
in three fetal tissues for which there was an adult counterpart. When comparing the fetal H2A.Z variant transcript
levels with one another, H2A.Z-1 was more abundant
than H2A.Z-2 in the brain (twofold) and they had similar
levels in the fetal liver and kidney (Figure 5, compare
hatched bars). While the fetal kidney showed a similar
H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 expression pattern compared to
adult kidney (Figure 5), the patterns observed in brain
and liver were different between fetus and adult suggest-

The promoter sequences of the H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2
genes are substantially different
The evolutionary process responsible for the differentiation between H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 has been described as
a refined stepwise mutation change within the codons of
the three differential residues (triresidue), leading to differences in the intensity of the selective constraints acting
upon the two H2A.Z isoforms in vertebrates [24]. In order
to determine whether the variation in expression patterns
of the H2A.Z variants could be attributed in part to differences in transcription factor binding sites in the promoters and, therefore, potential differential gene regulation,
we dissected the proximal promoter regions of both
H2A.Z variants in mammals (Figure 6A), where the evolutionary differentiation between H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 has
reached its maximum. Recurrent search rounds for transcription regulatory elements were performed on H2A.Z
promoter regions from human, rhesus monkey and
mouse, leading to the identification of several putative
promoter elements as well as to the localization of previously studied modules shown to be critical for H2A.Z-1
promoter activity [35]. However, comparisons between
H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 promoter regions revealed completely different promoter architectures (see Additional
Files 1 and 2). H2A.Z-1 shows the presence of typical elements common to other replication-independent histone
variants as well as putative binding sites for other transcription factors. A perfect TATA box, three CAAT boxes
and several putative GC-boxes (among which GC.1, GC.2
and GC.3 have been previously reported to form complexes with the Sp1 transcription factor) are observed in
the proximal promoter region. Among these elements,
one CAAT box (CAAT.2) and a GC-box (GC.2) are critical
for H2A.Z promoter activity [36]. Furthermore, binding
sites for c-myc are present within the upstream region of
the H2A.Z-1 promoter (-459, -563) where they have been
shown to specifically bind MYC and increase H2A.Z-1
transcription in response to estrogen [37].

The characterization of the H2A.Z-2 promoter emphasizes
the existence of a clear differentiation between H2A.Z-1
and H2A.Z-2. The H2A.Z-2 promoter contains no TATA
box and the positions of the CAAT elements and GCboxes do not coincide with those identified in H2A.Z-1
(Figure 6A). Furthermore, it seems that H2A.Z-2 promoters show a lesser degree of conservation across the mammalian species studied, as indicated by the lack of the
positional consensus in the elements identified (see Additional files 1 and 2). Searches for potential regulatory elements in the proximal promoter region resulted in the
identification of three CAAT elements as well as several
binding sites for transcription factors including c-Myc and

N-Myc. However, the positioning of these latter binding
sites at the proximal region suggests that they may function in constitutive gene expression rather than in inducible regulation in response to agents such as hormones
[36,37].
The differentiation between the H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2
promoters has also been analysed from a phylogenetic
perspective (Figure 6B). Our results reveal the differentiation of two major evolutionary lineages based on H2A.Z
promoter sequences, one encompassing the H2A.Z-1 promoter sequences and the other including H2A.Z-2 promoter sequences (Figure 6B). Such topology is in
agreement with the phylogenetic inferences reconstructed
on the basis of H2A.Z protein sequences and nucleotide
coding regions, which also show an evolutionary differentiation between H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 variants. The presence of such differentiation at promoter regions strongly
supports the presence of evolutionary constraints which

act with different direction and intensity on the H2A.Z-1
and H2A.Z-2 proteins.

Discussion
H2A.Z is the most extensively studied histone variant and
it has been shown to be involved in several seemingly
unrelated and divergent processes. Understanding how
this protein participates in different cellular events has
undoubtedly been further complicated by the use of different biological systems, since, while certain general
functions of H2A.Z may be universal in all organisms, the
specific details and fine-tuning in higher eukaryotes may
not be present, or may be the work of other proteins, in
yeast or flies. Part of this fine-tuning of H2A.Z in vertebrates could be due to the co-existence in the cell of two
H2A.Z protein isoforms (H2A.Z-1/H2A.Z-2) that was first
determined by mass spectrometry in total H2A.Z isolated
from chicken erythrocytes [23]. An evolutionary and phylogenetic analysis of these isoforms revealed a substantial

conservation at the protein level where they differ by only
three amino acids (see Figure 6C), but a marked divergence at the nucleotide sequence level [24]. It also
revealed that the two H2A.Z isoforms had a common origin early in deuterostome evolution that was followed by
a subsequent process of differentiation [24]. Indeed, it
appears that the strength of the evolutionary constraints
operating at the nucleotide level are not equal between
the isoforms, with H2A.Z-2 being significantly more constrained than H2A.Z-1 [24]. Cumulatively, the evolutionary evidence points toward a possible functional
diversification of these two proteins.
Recently, our group has characterized the sites of acetylation within the N-terminus of H2A.Z-2 from chicken
erythrocytes and from chicken erythroleukemic (MSB)

cells treated with sodium butyrate to inhibit histone
deacetylases [27]. Notably in the chicken, H2A.Z-2 is the
variant that has traditionally been called H2A.Z or H2A.F/
Z. In mouse and human H2A.Z-1 has customarily been
considered H2A.Z, while H2A.Z-2 was previously known
as H2A.V/F. In the current work, we determined that
H2A.Z-1 is acetylated at at least three lysine residues
within the N-terminus, as is H2A.Z-2. The patterns of
acetylation are similar for both isoforms, where a triplyacetylated (K4, K7 and K11) form as well as doublyacetylated (K4 + K7, K7 + K11, and K4 + K11) forms of the
N-terminal peptides were identified within the sample.
Singly-acetylated N-terminal peptides were also detected.
However, the sites of acetylation were not able to be determined owing to the low abundances of these species. In a
previous study, we identified multiple singly-acetylated

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 mRNA transcript levels in adult and fetal human tisFigure 5

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 mRNA transcript levels in adult and
fetal human tissues. The abundances of H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 transcript levels were determined relative to a standard
curve of known DNA amount for each primer set. Fetal levels are denoted with hatched bars while adult levels are represented by solid bars.

H2A.Z-2 peptides, with the abundance of acetyl K4-containing species being relatively equal to the acetyl K7 species [27], and this is likely to be the case with the singlyacetylated forms of H2A.Z-1. Previously, H2A.Z-1 has
been shown to be monoubiquitinated at one of several
lysine residues within the C-terminus, as well as
SUMOylated. However, neither modification was
observed on either H2A.Z variant in chicken cells,
although this could be a result of the purification method
used here, or the cell type [30,38].
Our results regarding the nuclear localization of the
H2A.Z isoforms indicate that they are identically distributed mainly in the euchromatin of mouse embryonic
fibroblasts, as seen by other groups [6,30]. However, both
H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 staining are also present within
DNA-dense regions that represent the centres of chromosomes. This is most probably due to the known presence
of H2A.Z in pericentric and centric chromatin [4,5]. This
distribution of H2A.Z is corroborated by our biochemical
analysis of chromatin fractions indicating that endogenous H2A.Z is present in greater amounts within the S1
(euchromatin) and SE (heterochromatin) fractions com-

pared to the Pellet (insoluble chromatin). In accordance
with the distribution of endogenous H2A.Z within these
fractions, we see that both stably transfected H2A.Z-1-Flag
and H2A.Z-2-Flag are also present in all fractions. However, interestingly, H2A.Z-2-Flag protein is present in
greater amounts within the S1 fraction compared to
H2A.Z-1-Flag. This suggests that H2A.Z-2 may play a
greater role in the function of H2A.Z within the nuclease
accessible euchromatin than does H2A.Z-1. Several systems have shown that H2A.Z functions in part to poise
promoter chromatin for transcriptional activation, since it
is remodelled from promoters of actively transcribing
genes [10-13,39,40]. H2A.Z functioning in this manner
would probably fractionate within the S1 fraction, since
this chromatin would be in a more open conformation.
Furthermore, the low levels of H2A.Z present within the P
fraction also agree with its not playing a significant role
after the initiation stage of transcription. Therefore, in
HEK 293 cells H2A.Z-2 may be playing a greater role than
H2A.Z-1 in poising chromatin for transcription, which
agrees with our results indicating that H2A.Z-2 also shows
a greater association with H3 Tri-Me K4 than H2A.Z-1 (see
below).

Genome-wide distribution patterns indicate that H3 TriMe K4 and H2A.Z are both present at the promoters and
5' ends of genes in yeast and humans [8]. Therefore, it is
not surprising that H2A.Z and H3 Tri-Me K4 are present
within the same nucleosome [30,31]. The fact that H2A.Z2 associates with H3 Tri-Me K4 to a greater extent than
H2A.Z-1 is interesting because it indicates that there is a
greater overlap in the regions of chromatin where H2A.Z2 is incorporated in conjunction with the H3 Tri-Me K4
mark than H2A.Z-1. This reinforces the idea that H2A.Z-1
and H2A.Z-2 could be incorporated at different locations
within the genome. The remodelling of H2A.Z into chromatin in mammals is known to occur via the action of sev-

eral distinct complexes that contain the SRCAP protein,
p400 or TIP 48/49 as the adenosine triphosphate-dependent remodelling subunits and evidence suggests that the
deposition patterns of these complexes may differ [39,4143]. It is tempting to speculate that one complex may prefer a specific isoform over the other, or that one complex
may be responsible for incorporating H2A.Z at low levels
across the genome and another for the increased levels of
H2A.Z that are necessary to promote appropriate chromatin architecture at promoters [44]. Furthermore, H2A.Z
nucleosomes flank nucleosome free regions whose formation is DNA-sequence dependent in several organisms
including humans [8]. Whether one of the human com-

BMC Biology 2009, 7:86

plexes that integrates H2A.Z into chromatin contains a
subunit that recognizes a specific DNA sequence is unclear
but points to the potential for more than one mechanism
to specify the location of H2A.Z nucleosomes [45].
Indeed, a recent in silico analysis suggests that both genetic
and epigenetic factors can predict whether a nucleosome
will contain H2A.Z [46].
The functional output of the increased association of
H2A.Z-2 with H3 Tri-Me K4 is unclear, but it is highly
unlikely that it results in a structural alteration of the
nucleosome that would otherwise not be observed in
those containing H2A.Z-1 with H3 Tri-Me K4 given the
high sequence similarity of the isoforms. At least one of
the effects of having H2A.Z and H3 Tri-Me K4 within the
same nucleosome could be related to the recruitment or
function of the RNA Pol II complex, since both the C-terminal region of H2A.Z and H3 Tri-Me K4 have been
shown to interact with components of this complex
[47,48]. Another possibility is that nucleosomes containing both H2A.Z and the H3 Tri-Me K4 mark protect less
DNA than other nucleosomes, making the DNA more
accessible for transcription [21,49]. Nevertheless, it is possible that any differences in the genomic localization and
association with post translationally modified forms of
other histones of the endogenous H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2
could reflect spatial and temporal differences in their
nuclear availability as determined by their levels of expression, or by their import into the nucleus.
Our results also reveal that H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 nucleosomes are enriched in H3 phosphorylated at S10 compared to H2A nucleosomes in asynchronous and mitotic
HeLa. This association is interesting because like H2A.Z,
H3 PhosS10 has been shown to be involved in processes
requiring open and condensed chromatin, namely in
transcription and chromosome condensation during
mitosis [50]. The structural and functional consequences
of H3S10 phosphorylation are not entirely clear; however,
this modification does correlate with increased expression
of immediate early genes after induction of MAP Kinase
cascades [51,52]. Furthermore, it is not surprising that
H4AcK16 is found to associate with H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z2 nucleosomes because it has been shown that this modification of H4 is required for incorporation of H2A.Z into
subtelomeric chromatin in budding yeast [53].
Our analysis of the transcript levels of H2A.Z-1 and
H2A.Z-2 indicate that there is no one dominant form,
rather they are both expressed across a wide range of
human tissues and that the expression levels vary depending on developmental stage. This pattern of expression
probably reflects the significant sequence variation within
the promoter regions of these genes and the differences in
abundance of specific transcription factors within the tis-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/86

sues. However, it could also reflect subtle changes in the
requirements of the tissues for one isoform over the other,
based on any functional differences between H2A.Z-1 and
H2A.Z-2. Indeed, it has recently been shown that H2A.Z2 is specifically upregulated during macrophage differentiation and activation [54] and our analysis of the promoter of H2A.Z-2 indicates the presence of putative
binding sites for the Ikaros transcription factor which is
known to play a role in hematopoietic cell development
[55]. Also as previously mentioned, genetic knockout
studies in mice show that H2A.Z-1 is essential for development, indicating that H2A.Z-2 cannot compensate for
the loss of H2A.Z-1 at least at early stages of mouse
embryo differentiation [26].
The evolutionary evidence presented here suggests that it
is highly possible that H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 appeared in
vertebrates as a result of the entire genome duplication
that took place between the divergence of the prochordates from the ancestral chordate lineage and the evolution of vertebrates, as stated by the 2R hypothesis [56].
While most of the genes arising from this duplication
event were silenced, some of them were retained and their
protein products either acquired a neofunctionalization
(a completely new function) or a subfunctionalization in
which the two new proteins acquired specialized functions [57]. This latter situation appears to be the case in
going from H2A.Z-e to H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 in vertebrates.

Conclusions
We present evidence that the two forms of H2A.Z present
in mammals display similar genomic localization patterns mainly within euchromatin but that subtle differences in their association with post translationally
modified forms of other histones exist. Thus, it is possible
that throughout the course of vertebrate evolution, the
two H2A.Z isoforms have acquired a degree of independent function that may contribute to the increased complexity and large diversity of roles for this histone variant
in higher organisms. It is also possible that differences in
chromatin localization patterns of the isoforms could be
due to the temporal regulation of their genes, especially
considering the dissimilarity in the promoter regions.

Methods
Immunofluorescence
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's
modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf
serum, plated on glass coverslips and allowed to attach
and grow until between 40% and 80% confluent. The
coding region of H2A.Z-1 was fused in frame to the 3' end
of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) into the pAmCyan1-N1
vector (Clontech) and the coding region of H2A.Z-2 was
fused in frame to the 3' end of yellow fluorescent protein

(YFP) into the pZsYellow1-N1 vector (Clontech, CA,
USA). The cells were then co-transfected with H2A.Z-1CFP and H2A.Z-2-YFP using effectene transfection reagent
(Qiagen, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The cells were grown for an additional 16-20
h followed by replacement of the medium and the addition of 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342. After 10 min, the medium
was replaced with fresh medium containing no Hoechst
dye. The coverslips were then mounted onto glass slides
after using vacuum grease to create a small reservoir for
media and imaged immediately using a Zeiss Axiovert 200
M inverted fluorescence microscope. Images were collected with a 100 × 1.4 N.A. PlanApo objective and a Photometrics CoolSnap fx CCD.
Native H2A.Z purification
Native H2A.Z was purified from chicken MSB cells
(chicken erythroleukemic cells transformed by Marek's
virus) treated with 5 mM sodium butyrate for 16 h as in
[58]. Isolated nuclei were extracted with HCl to solubilize
the histones as described in [59]. Approximately 30-40
mg of total histones was loaded onto a 1.5 cm × 120 cm
BioGel P-60 (Bio-Rad) column and eluted in 50 mM NaCl
and 20 mM HCl [60]. H2A.Z eluted within a peak that
also contained H2A and these fractions were selected for
further purification by several rounds of reverse phase
HPLC on a C18 column (Vydac, GA, USA).
Mass spectrometry
Upon purification of H2A.Z, as described above, the
H2A.Z fraction purified from sodium butyrate treated
MSB cells was lyophilized and reconstituted in 100 mM
ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8. An aliquot (10%) of each
fraction was treated with propionic anhydride to derivatize unmodified ε-amino groups of lysine residues. Chemical derivatization with propionic anhydride converts the
amino groups to their corresponding propionyl amides,
and these methods have been detailed previously [61]. In
brief, equal volumes of propionylation reagent (15 μL)
and H2A.Z (15 μL) were reacted and derivatization was
performed twice to ensure full conversion. The sample
was vacuum-dried after each derivatization. The derivatized H2A.Z samples were then digested with 4 ng trypsin
(Promega, WI, USA) for 8 h at 37°C. Derivatization
blocks lysine residues from cleavage and, thus, trypsin
cleaves C-terminal to arginine residues only. Following
digestion, the samples were again reacted with propionic
anhydride to derivatize the amino-termini of the trypsingenerated H2A.Z peptides. Both samples were dried a
final time in a speed-vac concentrator, and were subsequently reconstituted in 0.1% acetic acid.

The resulting H2A.Z peptide mixtures were analyzed via
tandem MS/MS. Each sample was pressure-loaded onto a
capillary pre-column (360 μm outside diameter [(OD] ×

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/86

75 μm inside diameter [ID] fused silica) packed with 4 cm
of C18 reverse phase resin (5-20 μm diameter). After
washing for 5 min with 0.1% acetic acid, the pre-column
was connected to an analytical column (360 μm OD × 50
μm ID fused silica) packed with 8 cm of C18 (5-μm diameter) resin and equipped with an electrospray emitter tip
as previously described [62]. H2A.Z peptides were eluted
using nanoflow HPLC with an 1100 series high-performance liquid chromography (HPLC) pump (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) and a 60 nL/min flow rate was
achieved by splitting the flow from the HPLC. The gradient consisted of 0-60%B in 50 min and 60-100%B in 10
min (solvent A: 0.1 M acetic acid, solvent B: 70% acetonitrile, 0.1 M acetic acid). Gradient-eluted peptides were
ionized using an electrospray ionization source, modified
for nanospray, and were analysed using a hybrid quadrupole linear ion trap Fourier transform (LTQ-FT) mass
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA). The LTQ-FT
instrument was operated with a data-dependent method,
which consisted of acquisition of a full mass spectrum
using the FT as analyser followed by 10 MS/MS acquisitions of the 10 most abundant ions in the initial full spectrum. Full mass spectra were acquired for m/z 300-2000
using a resolution of 100,000. Upon collision-activated
dissociation (CAD) of precursor ions, MS/MS spectra were
acquired using the ion trap as the analyser. Dynamic
exclusion was enabled, by which precursor ions were
selected for dissociation twice within 20 s before they
were added to the exclusion list for 30 s. All CAD MS/MS
spectra were interpreted via manual validation for identification of the N-terminal peptides of both H2A.Z isoforms. Accurate mass measurements acquired in the FT
were utilized to generate selected ion chromatograms
(SICs). A window of +/- 0.005 Da around the theoretical
monoisotopic m/z values of the [M+2H]+2 and [M+3H]+3
ions was used to generate the SICs for the N-terminal peptides of H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2.
Stable transfection and chromatin fractionation
H2A, H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 sequences were amplified
from HeLa cell cDNA and Flag tags were added in frame
to the 3' ends by PCR. The sequences were then cloned
into pcDNA3.0 vector (Invitrogen, CA, USA) and the plasmid was linearized by digesting with Sca1. HEK 293 cells
were transfected using PolyFect reagent (Qiagen) and cells
stably expressing the Flag-tagged protein were selected for
by the addition of G418 (Gibco, CA, USA) to cell culture
medium (DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum).
After several weeks, stable colonies expressing similar levels of the proteins were selected. Nuclei were isolated and
digested with Micrococal Nuclease (Worthington, NJ,
USA) at 30 U/mg of DNA for 5 min at 37°C. The reaction
was stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mM on ice, and the sample was centrifuged at
10,000 g for 10 min at 4°C to yield an S1 supernatant and

a pellet. The pellet was resuspended and lysed in 0.25 mM
EDTA pH 8 and stirred for 1 h at 4°C. Upon centrifugation as before, a supernatant SE and a final pellet P were
thus obtained. Under the experimental conditions used
here, S1, SE and P correspond to approximately 5%-10%,
25%-30% and 60%-65%, respectively, of the total nuclear
DNA. Western Blotting was performed on the normalized
protein component of these fractions using SDS-PAGE
and standard procedures. Flag antibody (Sigma, NY, USA)
dilution was 1:5000, H2A.Z antibody (Abcam) dilution
was 1:1000, H3 Tri-Me K4 antibody (Millipore, MA, USA)
dilution was 1:5000, and H4 antibody was made in-house
and used at a 1:10,000 dilution.
Preparation of mononucleosomes and
immunoprecipitation
Mononucleosomes were prepared from HeLa cells transiently transfected with H2A-Flag, H2A.Z-1-Flag or
H2A.Z-2-Flag within the pcDNA3.0 vector following the
procedure of Sarcinella and colleagues [30]. When
required, cells were treated with 100 mg/ml nocodazole
for 16 h after 24 h of transfection and an aliquot was monitored by fluorescence acitvated cell sorting after treatment
with propidium iodide to ensure mitotic arrest. Briefly,
isolated nuclei were digested with Micrococal Nuclease
(Worthington) at a concentration of 100 U/mg of DNA at
37°C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of EGTA to a final concentration of 1 mM and the suspension was centrifuged at 600 g for 10 min. The resulting
pellet was resuspended in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.2 mM
EGTA, 420 mM NaCl and 1.5 mM MgCl2 and incubated
on ice for 1 h then spun at 1000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was then brought to 150 mM NaCl by addition of
20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EGTA and
25% glycerol dropwise on the vortex. This suspension was
centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min and monitored on 4%
native acrylamide gels to ensure complete digestion of the
chromatin to mononucleosomes. For the immunoprecipitation, 10 ul of anti-Flag agarose beads (Sigma) was used
to immunoprecipitate Flag-containing mononucleosomes from H2A-Flag, H2A.Z-1-Flag, H2A.Z-2-Flag or
mock transfected control HeLa cells. The beads were
washed eight times in 1 ml 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM
NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EGTA, 0.2% Triton X-100,
resuspended in SDS sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol, boiled, followed by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol to the supernatant. Immunoprecipitated
nucleosomes were run on 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred
to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (BioRad, CA, USA).
Anti H3 AcK9K14, anti H3 Tri-MeK27, anti H3 PhosS10
and anti H4 AcK16 were all from Millipore and used at a
1:1000 dilution. Anti H2A antibody was from Abcam and
used at 1:1000 dilution.

Two-dimensional PAGE
Total histones from HeLa cell nuclei were extracted in
0.6N HCl as described in [59]. These histones were electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide AUT gel [63] in
several lanes, one of which was cut out and soaked in 125
mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol and 1.43 M
β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at room temperature while
the other was stained with Coomassie blue solution. The
unstained gel strip was laid horizontally and electrophoresed in a 6% polyacrylamide stacking, 15% polyacrylamide separating SDS gel prepared according to [64].
Quantitative PCR
Samples from three human cDNA panels derived from
various human fetal and adult tissues were obtained from
Clontech Laboratories Inc (CTL; CA, USA). These
included normal tissue from adult (CTL MTC panel I, CTL
MTC panel II) and fetal (CTL MTC fetal MTC panel)
sources. Each cDNA sample represented a pool of individuals of either gender. For quantitative PCR (QPCR) analysis, cDNA was diluted 20-fold in RNase/DNAse free
water. H2A.Z-1- and H2A.Z-2-specific primers were
designed based on the 5' and 3' untranslated regions and
amplicon sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
H2A.Z-1 forward primer: TTGCTTGAGCT TCAGCGGAATT, reverse primer: TTCCTTGTTATCTCAGGACTCT
H2A.Z-2 forward primer: GCGGCCGAGCGGAGGCGGAG, reverse primer: TGCTTAGAGGGATGCTTTAAC. The
levels of H2A.Z transcripts were analysed by SYBR Green
incorporation using a Stratagene MX3005P QPCR system
and MXPro software. Each 15 μl DNA amplification reaction consisted of 2 μl of diluted cDNA and 13 μl of Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG with Rox
(Invitrogen) containing 2.5 pmol of each primer. Thermocycling conditions for both primer sets were: 9 min
95°C followed by 40 cycles of 15 s 95°C, 30 s 60°C and
45 s 72°C. Reactions were performed in quadruplicate
and averaged cycle threshold was converted to transcript
copy number by interpolation from a standard curve. The
standard curve was constructed using a dilution series of
purified H2A.Z-1 or H2A.Z-2 amplicon.
Phylogenetic analysis
Nucleotide sequences corresponding to promoter regions
of H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 histones were retrieved from the
GenBank database through recurrent BLAST searches performed on general nucleotide collections as well on completed genomes [65]. A total of 27 nonredundant
sequences belonging to mammals were compiled and
properly classified as either H2A.Z-1 or H2A.Z-2 (see
Additional File 3). Multiple alignments of the promoter
sequences were conducted using the CLUSTAL W and the
BIOEDIT programs [66,67]. Conserved regulatory elements have been simultaneously identified from the
alignments of mammalian H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2

sequences by using the program Transcription Regulatory
Element Search (TRES, http://bioportal.bic.nus.edu.sg/
tres/) to perform searches in the object-oriented transcription factors database (ooTFD) [68]. Phylogenetic relationships among H2A.Z promoter regions were reconstructed
using the neighbour-joining method using uncorrected
nucleotide p-distances using the complete deletion
option. The reliability of the resulting topology was tested
by both the bootstrap and the interior-branch test methods, producing the BP and CP values, respectively, for
each interior node after 1000 replicates [69]. The tree was
rooted with the H2A.Ze sequence from sea urchin, representing an early chordate in which H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2
variants are not yet differentiated [24].
