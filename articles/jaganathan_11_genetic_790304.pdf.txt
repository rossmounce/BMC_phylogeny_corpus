found in Malaysia

Abstract
Background: Porcine circovirus type 2 is the primary etiological agent associated with a group of complex multifactorial diseases classified as Porcine Circovirus Associated Diseases (PCVAD). Sporadic cases reported in Malaysia
in 2007 caused major economic losses to the 2.2 billion Malaysian ringgit (MYR) (approximately 0.7 billion US
dollar) swine industry. The objective of the present study was to determine the association between the presence
of PCV2 and occurrences of PCVAD.
Results: This study showed that 37 out of 42 farms sampled were positive for PCV2 using PCR screening. Thirteen
whole genome of PCV2 isolates from pigs with typical PCVAD symptoms were successfully sequenced. These
isolates shared 98.3-99.2% similarities with sequences of isolates from the Netherlands. All thirteen isolates fell into
the same clade as PCV2b isolates from other countries. Amino acid sequence analysis of the putative capsid
protein (ORF2) of the PCV2 revealed that there are three clusters found in Malaysia, namely cluster 1C and 1A/1B.
Of interest, three of the isolates (isolates Mal 005, Mal 006 and Mal 010) had a proline substitution for arginine or
isoleucine encoded at nt. position 88-89. Eight of the isolates had mutations at the C terminus of the putative
capsid protein suggestive of higher pathogenicity which may account for the high reports of PCVAD clinical
symptoms in 2007.
Conclusion: Phylogenetic study suggests that there may be a link between movements of animals by import of
breeders into the country being the route of entry of the virus. While it is not possible to eradicate the virus from
commercial pigs, the swine industry in Malaysia can be safeguarded by control measures implemented throughout
the country. These measures should include improved biosecurity, disease surveillance; vaccination as well as
enforcement of regulations formulated to control and prevent the spread of this disease on a national scale.

Background
Porcine circovirus (PCV) is a small non-enveloped DNA
virus with a single-stranded circular DNA and a genome
of about 1.76 kbp, making it the smallest autonomously
replicating virus [1-6]. Porcine circovirus was first isolated as a non-cytopathic contaminant of the porcine
kidney cell line PK15 in 1974 [7-9] and since then has
been associated with many diseases related to swine.
There are several genotypes of PCV. The most commonly reported genotypes are PCV1 and PCV2 [10-12].
However, a new PCV genotype was recently documented in Canada which contains the ORF1 of PCV1 and

the ORF2 of PCV2a. This new genotype which was
assigned PCV1/2a has so far only been reported in
Canada [13]. Within the PCV2 genotype, there are several sub-types (PCV2a-2e). PCV2c has been reported in
pigs from Denmark [14], PCV2d are dominant in pigs
from China [15] and PCV2e are found in pigs from
Thailand [16]. Although PCV1 and PCV2 show high
levels of nucleotide similarity, PCV1 is considered nonpathogenic whilst PCV2 has been reported as pathogenic and has been identified as the causative agent of
PCV-associated diseases (PCVAD) or sometimes also
referred to as postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), a term used to describe all PCV2-associated clinical and subclinical manifestations [17-23].

identified 2 groups of PCV2 genome with a total of
eight clusters (1A to 1C and 2A to 2E) [11,24,25].
Group 1 has the sequence CCCCG/TC which encodes
for proline and arginine/leucine (PR/PL) at nt. position
88-89, while group 2 has the sequence AAAATC which
encodes for lysine and isoleucine (KI) at nt. position 8889 [26]. It is generally understood and accepted that
group 1 represents PCV2b whilst group 2 represents
PCV2a. Olvera et al. [26] reported genomes belonging
to cluster 1B could be the product of a recombinant
event between a genome of cluster 1A as the major parent and a genome of group 2 (most probably belonging
to cluster 2D) as the minor parent [26] with PCV2b
being the most prevalent form displaying highest pathogenicity compared to other genotypes [27]. Mutations
have also been reported in many PCV2 strains worldwide including elongations in the putative capsid protein
as a result of a single lysine (K) residue deletions at the
C-terminus of the putative capsid protein in the stop
codon of the open reading frame 2 (ORF2)
[15,24,26,28]. This could account for the variations in
the PCV2 findings reported worldwide in particular, the
recent PCV2 studies where several new genotypes have
been reported in Canada [13], Denmark [14], China [15]
and Thailand [16]. Overall, both genotypes share less
than 80% nucleotide sequence homology and approximately 75% homology at the amino-acid level
[5,22,25,29-32].
In Malaysia, PCV2 was first identified by the Veterinary Research Institute in 2004 using RFLP methods followed by the first case study of PCVAD in 2007 based
on clinical features, histopathology findings and PCR
screening [33]. Globally, the virus has been reported in
pigs in Canada and the United States, several European
countries and some countries in Asia and can be considered as one of the most economically important
emerging swine pathogens [14,15,19,26,34-38]. Realizing
the impact it has on the swine industry in Malaysia
which is worth over 2.2 billion ringgit, there is a need to
understand the genetic characteristics of PCV2 to monitor its distribution. By understanding the genetic presence of PCV2 and its relationship to PCVAD,
veterinary practitioners may be able to develop better
vaccination programs against the disease. Currently,
there are very few publications about PCV2 in this
country. This study represents the complete genetic
characterization and phylogenetic analysis of PCV2
reported for the first time in Malaysia.
42 pig farms were screened for PCV1 and PCV2. Thirteen positive samples from pigs with confirmed PCV2 were
genetically characterized. These samples were from different states in Malaysia. Genetic variation among isolates
from this study and PCV2 sequences from other countries
deposited in Genbank were analyzed and compared.

Results
The detection of PCV1 and PCV2 from the Malaysian pig
herd

Samples were collected from animals with typical clinical signs of PCVAD which include enlarged lymph
nodes, wasting, dyspnea, pallor, severe weight loss and
jaundice [37]. Samples tested positive for PCV1 were
not used for further analysis. Initial investigations
revealed that 37 out of the 42 farms were positive for
PCV2 by conventional PCR.
Genetic characterization, amino acid sequence analysis
and phylogenetic study of the PCV2 isolates in Malaysia

A preliminary BLAST analysis confirmed that all 13 isolates were PCV2. As reported previously, the PCV genomic sequences ranged from 1758 to 1768 bp [25,38].
Assembly of the complete genomes of all 13 PCV2 isolates showed that all isolates from this study were 1767
bp in length. To confirm that all isolates from this study
have the unique NcoI restriction enzyme site that exist
only in PCV2 [10,38] bioinformatics analysis was
employed to map the restriction enzyme sites present in
the complete genome. Our analysis confirmed that this
unique feature was present in all the complete genomes
isolated in this study at nucleotide position 668 to 673
(Figure 1). Phylogenetic analysis showed that all 13 isolates used for genetic characterization formed a group
with other PCV2b isolates. Amino acid sequence analysis
showed 3 distinct clusters; cluster 1C and cluster 1A/1B.

Discussion
Based on the 2010 data provided by the Department of
Veterinary Services (DVS) on their website, there are
approximately 565 pig farms in Malaysia. There are a
total of 14 states in Malaysia. The 3 states of Kelantan,
Terengganu and Pahang do not have any pig farms
whilst the states of Pahang, Perlis and Negeri Sembilan
have only 1 pig farm each and Kedah has only 2 pig
farms. Therefore, samples in this study were collected
from 6 states with big farms that are key players in the
swine industry to represent the big picture of PCV2 distribution in Malaysia with the aim of characterizing the
PCV2.
To determine the genetic differences among the PCV2
isolates found in Malaysia, the complete genome of
PCV2 isolates from thirteen pigs exhibiting PCVAD
symptoms in six states was amplified and sequenced.
This included three pigs from Selangor (isolate Mal
003/11, Mal004/11, Mal 011/11), three pigs from Melaka
(isolate Mal 001/11, Mal 002/11, Mal 008/11), three pigs
from Penang (isolate Mal 005/11, Mal 007/11, Mal 013/
11), two pigs from Sarawak (isolate Mal 006/11, Mal
009/11), one pig from Perak (isolate Mal 010/11) and
finally one pig from Johor (isolate Mal 012/11). All the

Figure 1 Nucleotide sequence alignment of a fragment of the complete genome of PCV1 and PCV2 found in this study. Alignments
were performed using ClustalW. The unique NcoI restriction enzyme site that is present in all PCV2 [10] isolates is underlined.

PCV2 isolates sequenced were closely related to each
other displaying between 97-99% nucleotide sequence
identity. When compared with other sequences from
Genbank (Table 1), all thirteen isolates had closest relationship to isolate AY484407 from Netherlands with
nucleotide sequence identity score ranging from 98.399.2% (Table 2). The sequences in Table 1 were selected
to represent the various subtypes and also to investigate
the possible connection between countries of origin
from which Malaysia imports the breeder pigs.
Numerous research has been carried out on PCV2
since it is considered to be pathogenic of the two genotypes identified. Amino acid sequence analysis showed
that isolates from this study had three distinct clusters.
The three clusters were cluster 1C and cluster 1A/1B.
Interestingly, 3 of the isolates (isolate Mal 005, Mal006,
Mal 010) had a proline (P) encoded at nt. position 89,
substituting arginine/leucine (R/L). This mutation pattern has not been reported in other papers. Previous
studies have documented that the ORF2 of PCV which
codes for the putative capsid protein [28] encodes a protein of 233 amino acid residues. An amino acid
sequence comparison revealed that the ORF2 genes of
all 13 isolates shared 94.0-100% amino acid sequence
identity. One PCV1 (U49816) and 3 PCV1/2a (FJ655419,
FJ790425, FJ655418) nucleotide sequence from Genbank
was included in this study as out groups. Previous

studies have reported that there exist about 63-68%
amino acid sequence identity between the ORF2 genes
of PCV1 and PCV2 and similarly it was observed that
all 13 PCV2 isolates from this study had 65-68% amino
acid similarities with the PCV1 (U49816) sequence
downloaded from Genbank. All isolates showed about
90-95% sequence similarities with the PCV1/2a
sequences (Data not shown). Eight of the isolates (Mal
001/11, Mal 002/11, Mal 003/11, Mal 004/11, Mal 005/
11, Mal 006/11, Mal 012/11, Mal013/11) displayed an
elongation by one lysine (K) residue at the C-terminus
of the putative capsid protein in a mutation at the stop
codon of the ORF2 (Figure 2).
Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that all thirteen PCV2
isolates in this study grouped together and formed one
distinct group with other PCV2b isolates. Likewise, all
the PCV2a isolates which are closely related formed
another group, while all the PCV1/2a, PCV2c and
PCV2d isolates formed their own groups (Figure 3).
Neighboring countries such as Thailand [16] and
Indonesia [19] have reported the presence of PCV2b
cluster 1C and PCV2b cluster 1A/B respectively suggesting that similar PCV2b clusters as reported in this study
are circulating in these few Asian countries in this
region. This may also suggest that the swine in this
region could be harboring the virus from the same
source.

PCV2 isolates found in Malaysia were compared with other PCV2b isolates and PCV1. Sequence identity scores for the other PCVs are not shown. The upper right
portion is the sequence identity scores of the nucleotide alignment of the whole genome of PCV’s; the lower portion is the amino acid sequence identity scores
for the capsid protein (ORF2) of PCV2b. The highest nucleotide similarity scores for the Malaysian isolates are shown in bold.

This study showed that 88% of the farms (37 out of 42
farms) were positive for PCV2b which confirms that
PCV2 is present in Malaysia. Currently, there are no
regulations for the screening of PCV2 or other porcine
diseases for imported pigs into the country. Based on
statistics provided by the Department of Veterinary Services (DVS), Malaysia, there are some evidence that
breeders and swine products are imported from Australia, Canada, Netherlands, America, Vietnam and other
countries. Although the present study and statistics
available suggests that there may be a link between

imports of pig products, however, no definitive conclusions can be made as data on the countries of import
from the farms in this study are not available for
analysis.
The samples from this study were collected in light of
the PCV2 occurrences in Malaysia in which a high number of clinical symptoms were observed in many farms.
Taking into account the possibility of virus spread
through animal migration and commercial trading, it is
expected that viruses in the commercial swine breeds

understanding the genetic characteristics and diversity of
viruses provides new information to guide and prioritize
decisions for the control of disease in livestock including
the implementation of effective vaccination strategies
and good biosecurity programs for the swine industry.

All animals are susceptible to a wide range of diseases
that may affect its productivity. Among solutions
required to minimize the risk of disease spread,
strengthening the biosecurity and husbandry practices in
a farm is of utmost importance. PCVs are highly

resistant to inactivation by common detergents and disinfectants. This makes decontamination of infected premises difficult, if not impossible. But combining
accurate diagnosis, removal of diseased animals from
farms, routine vaccination programs and a good husbandry practice could be an excellent measure for controlling losses attributed to PCV2 infections.

Each production system requires suitable biosecurity
measures and the key to an enhanced biosecurity lies in
the perception of biosecurity by the stakeholders in the
pig farming industry for a meaningful change to take
place.
In the past, a centralized pig farming has been suggested by the authorities to control pollution, safeguard

these food animals that are meant for human consumption, improve sanitary condition, minimize environmental problems and organize the production of pigs but
unfortunately, the centralized pig farming did not materialize. Perhaps, it is time that the local authorities
review these measures to improve livestock production
systems and to reduce the risk of disease agents.

Conclusion
Publication of whole genome sequences allows researchers to trace the presence and the spread of economically
important viruses, determine their genetic distribution
and assist in making priority decisions for good control
programs. The findings of this study suggests that routine screening would be helpful to monitor the status of
PCV2 and subsequently its control by implementing a
good vaccination program and other measures such as
education to the pig farmers on the consequences of
PCVAD becoming an endemic disease in the country.
More studies need to be done to establish the function
of the mutations present in the group 1 (PCV2b) found
in Malaysia before any conclusions can be made with
regards to its relationship to its pathogenicity.
In conclusion, the 2.2 billion ringgit swine industry in
Malaysia is an economic asset to the country’s
resources. Therefore, all appropriate measures should be
taken to manage it well.
Methods
Sampling and Screening of PCV1 and PCV2 by PCR

Organ samples consisting of lymph nodes, kidney, liver,
lungs and other specimens such as fecal samples were
collected from 42 pig farms in Malaysia from animals
displaying classic PCVAD clinical signs. The states
included in this study were Penang, Perak, Selangor,
Melaka, Johor and Sarawak. The pooled organ samples
were subjected to nucleic acid extraction by using Trizol

LS reagent according to the standard manufacturer’s
protocol. Nested multiplex PCR with modifications from
a method previously described [39] was established. The
primer sets for the first step and nested step are listed
in Table 3. Both the PCR mixtures consisted of 2.5 μl of
10X PCR buffer, 1.5 μl 25 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 μl 10 mM
dNTPs, and 0.5 μl of 5 U Taq Polymerase, DNA template, the respective primer sets and PCR grade water to
make up the final volume of 50 μl per reaction. The
PCR tubes were subjected to PCR amplification in a
thermocycler (MyCycler™, Bio-Rad). The DNA fragment sizes were determined via agarose gel electrophoresis. This multiplex PCR is able to distinguish PCV1
and PCV2 (Figure 4).
All pigs were humanely slaughtered for sample collection under the supervision of veterinarians from the
Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, UPM. There was no
experimental research done on the pigs.
PCR amplification of the complete genome of PCV2

A published primer was used for amplifying the whole
genome of PCV2. The primer sets were able to amplify
two overlapping fragments that represent the entire genome of PCV2. The first set of primers, CV1 and CV2,
amplifies a 989-bp fragment, and the second set of primers, CV3 and CV4, amplifies a 1,092 bp fragment
(Table 3). The PCR amplification of the complete genome of PCV2 was established with modifications from
the method as described by Fenaux M et al. 2000 (Figure 5) [10,23].
Nucleotide sequencing, sequencing analysis and
construction of phylogenetic tree

The PCR products of the expected sizes were purified
using the PCR clean-up gel extraction kit according to
the manufacturer’s protocol with slight modifications
(Macherey-Nagel, Germany). Sequencing of the

bootstrapping method calculated on 1000 repeats of the
alignment (Data not shown). The sequence identity
matrix data was generated with BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor version 7.0.5.2 (Tom Hall, US). Sequences
used for constructing the phylogenetic tree are listed in
Table 1. PCV1 sequences were included in the tree as
an out group, whilst PCV1/2a sequences were included
to investigate whether similar recombinant events of the
ORF1 and ORF2 of PCV2 are found in Malaysia.
Sequences for PCV2e could not be analyzed as the
sequence was not available in Genbank.
