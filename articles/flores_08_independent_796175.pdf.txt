Abstract
Background: Recent translocations of autosomal regions to the sex chromosomes represent
important systems for identifying the evolutionary forces affecting convergent patterns of sexchromosome heteromorphism. Additions to the sex chromosomes have been reported in the
melanica and robusta species groups, two sister clades of Drosophila. The close relationship between
these two species groups and the similarity of their rearranged karyotypes motivates this test of
alternative hypotheses; the rearranged sex chromosomes in both groups are derived through a
common origin, or the rearrangements are derived through at least two independent origins. Here
we examine chromosomal arrangement in representatives of the melanica and the robusta species
groups and test these alternative hypotheses using a phylogenetic approach.
Results: Two mitochondrial and two nuclear gene sequences were used to reconstruct
phylogenetic relationships of a set of nine ingroup species having fused and unfused sex
chromosomes and representing a broad sample of both species groups. Different methods of
phylogenetic inference, coupled with concurrent cytogenetic analysis, indicate that the hypothesis
of independent origins of rearranged sex chromosomes within each species group is significantly
more likely than the alternative hypothesis of a single common origin. An estimate tightly
constrained around 8 My was obtained for the age of the rearranged sex chromosomes in the
melanica group; however, a more loosely constrained estimate of 10–15 My was obtained for the
age of the rearrangement in the robusta group.
Conclusion: Independent acquisition of new chromosomal arms by the sex chromosomes in the
melanica and robusta species groups represents a case of striking convergence at the karyotypic
level. Our findings indicate that the parallel divergence experienced by newly sex-linked genomic
regions in these groups represents an excellent system for studying the tempo of sex chromosome
evolution.

Background
Pairs of sex chromosomes generally display high structural and functional differentiation. Heteromorphism
between the sex-chromosome pair in different lineages

was originally proposed as resulting from convergence,
whereby presence of the primary locus controlling sex
determination on a pair of homologous chromosomes
defines a characteristic pattern of differentiation [1-3].

Autosomal origins of independently derived sex chromosomes have now been clearly demonstrated in humans
[4,5], birds [6], snakes [7] and in several lineages of plants
[8]. Convergence upon similar patterns of heteromorphism in a variety of organisms indicates that common
mechanisms shape the evolution of sex chromosomes [912]; however, the rate at which heteromorphism develops
on a newly derived sex-chromosome pair is unknown, as
are the mechanisms affecting this transition.
Organisms with sex chromosomes in transitory stages of
differentiation provide models for testing hypotheses
relating to sex-chromosome evolution. Since the transition from an autosomal pair to fully differentiated heteromorphic sex chromosomes is a dynamic process that lasts
several million years, studies of sex chromosomes from a
broad spectrum of stages are ultimately needed to develop
a synthetic picture of this process. Sex chromosomes
underlying recent transitions to dioecy in different plant
lineages represent promising sources of model systems
[8,13]. Rearrangements involving translocations onto
existing sex chromosomes represent another source for
studying this evolutionary transition. Sex-linked transmission results from this type of translocation, and the newly
acquired region of the sex chromosomes differentiates
through the same evolutionary pathway as did the original pair of sex chromosomes; i.e., suppression of recombination, degeneration of the heterozygous chromosomes
and dosage compensation [14,15]. In fact, the sex chromosomes in humans are a mosaic comprised of an ancestral sex-linked region shared with non-eutherian
mammals and a newly acquired region unique to eutherian mammals [16].
A rich history of comparative genomics in the genus Drosophila makes this group especially appealing for studies
of sex chromosome evolution. This appeal derives from
several features: i) phylogenetic relationships among several major groups, and even within some groups, are generally understood, ii) extensive chromosomal analyses
have been performed within many species groups, and iii)
long-distance comparisons demonstrate a high degree of
conservation in gene content within chromosomal arms.
Therefore, the chromosomal arm designated as element A
comprises the X chromosome in most extant species and
contains a conserved set of genes [17,18]. The four major
autosomal arms are designated as elements B, C, D, and E,
and the "dot" as element F [19,20]. Comparative studies
reveal several instances of translocations of these autosomal elements to the sex chromosomes, thus establishing newly sex-linked genomic regions subject to same
forces that transform primary sex chromosomes.
Three independent examples of derived sex-linked regions
in the genus Drosophila representing a wide spectrum in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/33

the transition from autosome to heteromorphic sex chromosomes have been the primary targets of research efforts
to understand the mechanisms underlying sex chromosome evolution. At one extreme, an ancient centromeric
fusion between the X chromosome and an autosome, corresponding to element D, occurred in the lineage leading
to D. pseudoobscura and relatives [21]. The newly acquired
arm of the metacentric X chromosome has co-opted the
standard mechanism of dosage compensation utilized by
the ancestral X [22,23]. Interestingly, this fusion is associated with translocation of Y-chromosome genes onto an
autosome, so these previously male-limited genes now
segregate as diploid autosomal loci [24]. Origin and gene
content of the single Y chromosome in the D. pseudoobscura lineage remains unclear, but it potentially represents
the degenerate homolog of the derived arm of the X. Transitional sex chromosomes at an intermediate stage of differentiation are present in D. miranda. This species has an
enlarged Y chromosome due to a fusion between the Y
and element C. The homolog of the neo-Y region segregates as a secondary X (or neo-X) chromosome. Gene
function has been lost for some loci within the newly
acquired region of the Y [25-28] and dosage compensation appears to have arisen regionally on the neo-X chromosome [22,23,29]. An even younger sex-linked region is
present in D. americana, where element B is fused at the
centromere with the X forming a neo-X chromosome. This
rearrangement remains polymorphic with the ancestral
unfused chromosomes, so Y-linked transmission of element B is transient and meiotic exchange still occurs
between the neo-X and these transient neo-Y chromosomes [30,31]. Genes on the neo-Y chromosome are functional [32], dosage compensation is not evident [22,23],
and sequence divergence is accruing specifically in association with a recombination-suppressing inversion complex limited to the neo-X chromosome [33,34]. Overall,
these three rearrangements represent distinct time points
in the transition from autosome to heteromorphic sex
chromosomes, but they only provide a coarse measure of
this progression.
Other cases of fusions involving sex chromosomes and
autosomes have been reported in the genus Drosophila.
For example, a fusion of the X chromosome with an autosome has been described in D. robusta and relatives in the
robusta species group [35,36]. This derived arm of the X
originated through a centromeric fusion with element D
[37-39]. The X chromosome of D. melanica also has two
arms (XL and XR), indicating a fusion between an autosome and the ancestral X [40]. Other members of the melanica species group (D. paramelanica [41], D. euronotus
[42], D. nigromelanica [43] and D. melanura [44]) exhibit
the same rearrangement of the X, but the ancestral
arrangement is retained in D. micromelanica [44]. Comparisons of polytene chromosomes also indicate homol-

ogy to element D for the newly derived XL arm within the
melanica group [45]. These two species groups are both
contained within the virilis-repleta radiation of the subgenus Drosophila, and they are generally recognized as sister
groups based on their high affinity at morphological [46],
chromosomal [40,45] and molecular [47-49] levels. The
close relationship between these species groups, and the
similarity between the chromosomal rearrangements in
each group, raises the possibility that the derived arrangements of the sex chromosomes share a common origin.
Phylogenetic relationships within and between the robusta
and melanica species groups are not resolved. Narayanan
[36] proposed relationships within the robusta species
group based on analyses of polytene chromosomes. Two
species with unfused sex chromosomes, D. colorata and D.
moriwakii, were placed as basal members of the group relative to D. robusta, D. lacertosa, D. sordidula and D. pseudosordidula, all of which contain the derived fusion of the
sex chromosomes (Fig. 1A). However, a subsequent taxonomic revision reassigned D. colorata and D. moriwakii to
the melanica group [50]. Polytene chromosomes were also
used by Stalker [44] to infer the relationships within the
melanica species group. The ancestral unfused sex-chromosome arrangement was inferred for the basal lineage
represented by D. micromelanica and the derived arrangement was inferred for D. paramelanica, D. melanica, D.
euronotus, D. melanura and D. nigromelanica (Fig. 1B).
However, in a subsequent analysis of chromosomal relationships, Stalker [45] suggested an alternative phylogeny
for the melanica group where the divergence of D.
nigromelanica represented the most basal node (Fig. 1C).
He proposed that the alternative arrangements of the sex
chromosomes, currently observed among the species of
the melanica group, arose from a polymorphic population
that existed for an extended period of time. Such a situation currently exists in D. americana, where the frequency
of a segregating X-autosome fusion is correlated with latitude [30]. Phylogenetic relationships of species with the
ancestral arrangement of the sex chromosomes (D. color-

ata, D. moriwakii and D. micromelanica) relative to species
containing the rearranged sex chromosomes are critical
for determining the number of rearrangements involved.
Considering the close relationship between the robusta
and melanica species groups, and the high degree of similarity of their rearranged sex chromosomes, concurrent
cytogenetic and phylogenetic analyses are needed to
establish the evolutionary history of these rearrangements
within these two species groups. Here we present results of
a phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences from two mitochondrial and two nuclear loci on the ancestral X chromosome from select species belonging to the robusta and
melanica species groups and from appropriate outgroups
together with an examination of sex-chromosome morphology. The species were selected based on previous
reports of chromosomal morphology and availability of
live material. Under the assumption that centromeric
fusion is more likely than fission, these data provide a
robust test of the alternative hypotheses of a single origin
versus independent origins of the rearranged sex chromosomes in these sister groups of Drosophila. Based on the
findings, at least two independent fusions with the sex
chromosomes are clearly resolved. Furthermore, the
results provide a phylogenetic framework for designing
future studies of these newly sex-linked regions to test
hypotheses relevant to mechanisms of sex chromosome
evolution.

Note: Each karyotype described by diploid number (2n), pairs of metacentric (M), acrocentric (A) and dot (D) chromosomes, and fundamental
number (FN). Features of the sex chromosomes (X and Y) are summarized in terms of size and morphology.

D. euronotus and D. paramelanica, representatives of the
melanica species group, was confirmed by this analysis.
The fusion is indicated by the presence of long metacentric X and Y chromosomes in contrast with the karyotype
of outgroup species, which have acrocentric X and Y chromosomes similar to the inferred ancestral karyotype for
the genus Drosophila [51]. Variation in the number of
chromosomes (2n = 8, 10 and 12) while maintaining 14
chromosomal arms (represented by the Fundamental
Number, or FN in Table 1)-except in D. colorata which has
16 chromosomal arms- also provided evidence supporting the X-autosome/Y-autosome fusion in the melanica
and robusta groups. The increase in chromosomal arms in
species of the melanica and robusta groups, in relation to
the ancestral karyotype of Drosophila (FN = 12), is due to
a pericentric inversion of the Muller's element B, previously reported in species belonging to both groups, with
the exception of D. pseudosordidula [36,44], which was not
analyzed in this study. The inverted chromosome consists
of the small metacentric chromosomal pair in each of the
karyotypes from species in the melanica and robusta species
groups (See Fig. 2). Here we confirm that this is a synapomorphic rearrangement shared by the members of the
melanica-robusta clade.
Polytene chromosomes also reveal an independently
derived pericentric inversion in Muller's element C of D.
colorata [52], thus giving rise to the extra pair of chromosomal arms (FN = 16) in its karyotype (Fig. 2). In our analysis, the dot chromosome (element F) is absent in this
species and is instead replaced by a large acrocentric chromosomal pair with intense DAPI staining. This is not consistent with the description of the metaphase karyotype

reported by Narayan [36]. Our findings generally agree
with the karyotype description of Wharton [53] and indicate that element F is enlarged in D. colorata, a phenomenon that has also occurred in D. yooni in the
diamphidiopoda species group [54] and in D. ananassae in
the melanogaster species group [55]. Excluding D. colorata,
our descriptions of karyotype structure agree with the
karyotype configurations reported for each species.
Phylogenetic analysis of single partitions and combined
data
Sequences from the mitochondrial genes Cytochrome oxidase I (mtCoI) and Cytochrome oxidase II (mtCoII), and
from the X-chromosome gene regions cacophony (cac) and
scute (sc) were used in the phylogenetic analysis. After
excluding regions of scute with many indels among repetitious codons and introns from cacophony, the alignment
matrix contained the following sizes: CoI = 645 bp; CoII =
657 bp; cac = 588 bp and sc = 579 bp. The mitochondrial
genes (CoI and CoII) showed higher observed frequencies
of transversions than transitions, even for short corrected
pairwise-distances. This is a common pattern for mitochondrial genes in Drosophila [56], and is apparently due
to rapid saturation for transition substitutions. Also, the
corrected distances estimated from the mitochondrial
sequences failed to separate outgroup from ingroup taxa
(Fig. 3). Consequently, third positions of the CoI and CoII
codons were removed in the following analyses. The
nucleotide composition, substitution rates, transitiontransversions ratios and models of nucleotide substitution
for alternative partitions of the data are summarized in
Table 2. Homogeneity tests showed similar phylogenetic
signals for each major data partition, although the two

nuclear genes did exhibit marginally non-significant heterogeneity (ILD test, P = 0.056). However, this weak
incongruence between nuclear genes was not indicated
when outgroups were removed (Table 3); therefore, the
full concatenated dataset was used for hypothesis testing.
Maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, and Bayesian methods all recovered similar tree topologies using
the mitochondrial (Fig. 4A), nuclear (Fig. 4B) and combined (Fig. 5) data partitions. Trees from the concatenated
mitochondrial genes contained several unresolved nodes
at the level of relationships among species within groups
(Fig. 4A). However, the nodes supporting the melanica
and the robusta species groups, excluding D. colorata,
were resolved with high confidence. Despite being currently recognized as a member of the melanica species
group, D. colorata was placed basal to the melanica and
robusta groups. The relationships among outgroups was

poorly defined, even for the pair of species representing
the two major phylads within the virilis species group.
The phylogenies derived from the concatenated nuclear
genes exhibited high support at almost all nodes (Fig. 4B).
The robusta and the melanica species groups were discriminated with high bootstrap support. D. colorata was again
placed basal to the robusta and melanica groups but, as in
the phylogeny obtained from mitochondrial genes, its
position was not strongly supported. Importantly, D.
micromelanica, a species with unfused sex chromosomes,
was placed as the basal lineage within the melanica species
group.
The trees from the analysis using the total concatenated
data set did not display conflicts with those obtained from
the separate mitochondrial and nuclear partitions (Fig. 5).
Here, the melanica species group was monophyletic and

Overall, our results indicate that the melanica-robusta clade
contains two separate lineages with metacentric sex chromosomes arising from independent fusions with an auto-

somal element. One fusion is present in the karyotypes of
four species belonging to the melanica species group
(node a in Fig. 5) and the other is present in the two species contained within the robusta species group (node d).
Two nodes (nodes b and c) that apparently represent the
ancestral arrangement of the sex chromosomes separate
these two lineages.

Hypothesis test of the sex chromosome rearrangement
Contrasts between different topologies relevant to the origin of rearranged sex chromosomes in the melanica and
robusta groups reject the hypothesis of a single origin.
Three alternative topologies consistent with independent
origins of rearranged sex chromosomes are each shown to
be credible by the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) and the
approximately unbiased (AU) tests. Each of these topologies reflects alternative placements of D. colorata relative
to the melanica and robusta groups. Forced monophyly of
species having rearranged sex chromosomes corresponds
with a significant reduction in likelihood score (Table 4).
These differences in likelihood scores are also reflected in
the tree lengths obtained from weighted parsimony. Overall, this comparison indicates that topologies disrupting
monophyly of the melanica group, including D. micromelanica which maintains the ancestral arrangement of the
sex chromosomes, are significantly incompatible with the
data. Monophyly of all species containing a similar rearrangement of their sex chromosomes is, therefore,
rejected in favor of topologies supporting the hypothesis
of two independent rearrangements.
Estimated ages of the derived sex chromosomes
By estimating dates of divergence at specific nodes within
the consensus tree, the intervals in which these two rearranged sex chromosomes arose were inferred. Both the
rate of synonymous substitutions (Ks) and the penalized
likelihood (PL) methods yielded similar estimates of the
dates for the relevant nodes used to determine these intervals (Table 5). On the other hand, Bayesian dating (BD)
yielded higher estimates of the dates for the four relevant
nodes. In addition, confidence intervals were considerably broader with BD than with other methods.

Rapid divergence at the base of the melanica group constrains the timeframe in which the centric fusion in the
group could have arisen. Origin of the centric fusion in
the melanica group was estimated to have occurred
between 7.5 and 9 Mya using the dates obtained by PL
(Table 5). The maximum value of this interval is based on
the estimated date of the divergence of D. micromelanica.
The minimum value corresponds to the first instance of
divergence within the clade sharing the apomorphic

(fused) arrangement of the sex chromosomes, which corresponds to the divergence of D. nigromelanica.
On the other hand, low diversity in the robusta group provides little constraint on the age of this centric fusion, and
a window of 10 to 15 Mya is estimated from the lineages
represented in the analysis (Table 5). Uncertainty in the
time of origin is due to the absence of a closely related
basal lineage with unfused sex chromosomes and having
only two species with fused sex chromosomes. Inclusion
of a greater diversity of Asian representatives of the robusta
group that also contain rearranged sex chromosomes
[36,49] would undoubtedly increase the minimum age of
this fusion, but should have little effect on the maximum.

Discussion
Resolution of the phylogenetic relationships among species sharing similar rearrangements of sex chromosomes
is critical for proposing and testing hypotheses about parallelism and convergence of evolutionary pathways
underlying the differentiation of new sex chromosomes.
This phylogenetic analysis of the robusta and melanica species groups, two closely related lineages, revealed two
independent origins of a fusion between the sex chromosomes and an autosomal pair. Our results are consistent
with centromeric fusion between an autosome and the X
(and possibly the Y) occurring independently in both of
these groups. The independent origin of each fusion is
strongly supported by the consensus tree topology,
inferred via different data partitions and methods, since
the two clades containing rearranged sex chromosomes
are separated by at least two nodes representing common
ancestors with pleisiomorphic (unfused) sex chromosomes (Fig. 5). In agreement with the history of the chromosomal rearrangements depicted by the consensus
topology, the alternative hypothesis of a monophyletic
origin is rejected based on statistical criteria upon application of tests for contrasting phylogenetic hypotheses.
Given the topology of Figure 5, a monophyletic origin of
the fused arrangement of the sex chromosomes and autosomes in the robusta and the melanica groups would be
feasible only if reversal of the rearrangement through fission is considered plausible. Under this hypothesis, inde-

but it does require one additional instance of chromo-

somal rearrangement, entailing one fusion followed by
two independent fissions, thus it is less parsimonious
than the inference of two independent fusions within
both the melanica and robusta species groups. Further-

more, taking into account that autosomal arms diverge
through gene loss and dosage compensation after fusion
with the sex chromosomes [9,26,58], reversion of this
type of chromosomal rearrangement is generally considered unlikely. Consequently, the character states studied
here (fused and unfused sex chromosomes) are treated as
polarized. A more direct test of the plausibility of chromosomal fission in these groups would require a phylogenetic analysis including additional taxa contained in the

melanica-robusta clade and having unfused sex chromosomes–coupled with better resolution of the relationships
among D. micromelanica, D. nigromelanica, and the other
species in the melanica group. By inference from other
studies, the ancestral arrangement of the X in D. longiserata and D. tsigana [59], coupled with the placement of this
species pair as a single clade arising from a basal node of
the melanica group [49], further suggests fission as an
unlikely mechanism for generating the observed karyo-

typic variability and implies the independent origin of the
rearranged sex chromosomes in the robusta and melanica
species groups. Preliminary phylogenetic analyses utilizing available sequences of D. moriwakii indicate it is a sister of D. colorata, so unfortunately, its placement does not
provide an additional node to inform the history of the
chromosomal forms, but it could help resolve the position of these species within the melanica-robusta clade (see
below).

was less than one step shorter (using a differential weighting scheme) than the topology constrained with D.
nigromelanica as the basal lineage, thus these alternative
topologies do not differ statistically (data not shown).
Although the consensus topology obtained here is consistent with a single fusion of the sex chromosomes within
the melanica species group, thus agreeing with the phylogeny of the melanica group initially proposed by Stalker
[44], this topology was weakly supported by the analysis.

These analyses strongly supported monophyly of the traditionally recognized melanica species group (i.e., exclusive of D. colorata); however, topological relationships
within the group are not strongly supported by any
method. At the base of the melanica clade, the branching
order for D. micromelanica, which has unfused sex chromosomes, and the branches containing species with fused
sex chromosomes represented by D. nigromelanica and the
lineage leading to the other species in the melanica group
are poorly supported. Low support for these nodes,
derived from nonparametric and Bayesian MCMC methods, may be due to insufficient phylogenetic signal indicated by the short internode distance (node a to b, Fig. 5).
In a direct contrast, the constrained topology with D.
micromelanica as the basal lineage for the melanica group

Placement of D. nigromelanica as the basal lineage for the
melanica group is indicated by comparison of polytene
chromosomes even though it conflicts with overall chromosome morphology [45]. In order to explain the existence of both fused and unfused sex chromosomes in
derived nodes, Stalker proposed the maintenance of the
sex-chromosome fusion as a polymorphism in the population from which the basal lineages of the melanica group
arose. A similar type of polymorphism is currently
observed in D. americana [30,60]. Under this hypothesis
the fusion between sex chromosomes and autosomes predated the diversification of the melanica group, and fixation/loss occurred separately in different lineages.
Although the resolved topology for the melanica group is
inconsistent with this hypothesis, it cannot be rejected

due to the tight clustering, and ultimately, weak support
for each of the basal nodes. On the other hand, accounting for all cases of fused and unfused sex chromosomes
for the entire melanica-robusta clade through ancestral polymorphism requires the maintenance of both chromosomal forms over a period of about 8 My (Node d to a, Fig.
5). Although a short-term polymorphism may account for
conflicting phylogenetic signals among lineages in the
melanica group, the later scenario seems unlikely since the
hypothesis entails the maintenance of the polymorphism
for an extended period of time represented by the split
between the two groups until the initial diversification of
the extant lineages within the melanica group.

tor of this North American clade from Asia [49]. Diversification of the subgroup comprising D. melanica, D.
euronotus and D. paramelanica was dated at 2.2 mya (CI
1.33 – 3.91, PL analysis). Therefore, newly derived sex
chromosomes in the melanica group are currently represented by two distinct lineages (D. nigromelanica and the
"melanica subgroup"), which diversified near the point
when this rearrangement arose in their common ancestor.
Considering this history and extant biodiversity, the new
chromosomal arms fused to sex chromosomes in the melanica group represent an excellent substrate for exploring
patterns of parallel evolution arising from divergence of
the newly sex-linked regions.

Our analysis indicates uncertainty in the exact position of
D. colorata. The contrasts among alternative topologies
testing the number of fusion events within the melanicarobusta clade revealed that D. colorata could be placed
either basal to the melanica clade, basal to the robusta
clade, or basal to both (Table 4). Chromosomal morphology, including an unfused X chromosome, indicates that
D. colorata is a sister species of D. moriwakii [44], and a
recent molecular phylogeny placed D. moriwakii basal to
the robusta group [49]. Taken together these observations
indicate uncertainty in the phylogenetic position of a
clade containing D. colorata and D. moriwakii and suggest
the possibility that these species are contained in a separate clade originating near the split between the melanica
and robusta species groups. Resolution of the phylogenetic
position of D. colorata and D. moriwakii as originating
from a basal node in either the melanica or robusta groups
would further clarify the evolutionary history of these
alternatively arranged sex chromosomes.

Although our results do not confirm the identities of the
chromosomal arms fused with the sex chromosomes,
independent fusions putatively involving the same chromosomal element in both species groups represents a case
of extreme convergence. Additional cases of translocations to the sex chromosomes are reported for species contained within the virilis-repleta radiation, which represents
one of the major clusters of species diversity within the
genus Drosophila. Other than the rearrangement of the X
chromosome of D. americana [60], these newly derived
regions of the sex chromosomes have not been examined
very extensively. Phylogenetic relationships of the virilis
section obtained by Wang et al [49] and karyotypes
described by He et al. [62] indicate that the karyotype of
D. lacertosa represents at least one additional case of
fusion between an autosome and the sex chromosomes in
a lineage closely allied with the melanica-robusta clade.
Additionally, two members of the repleta species group, D.
canalinea and D. castanea, have been reported as having
sex chromosomes fused with autosomal elements [37,38].
In the phylogeny of Robe et al. [57], D. canalinea represents a basal lineage of the repleta section within the virilisrepleta radiation and the phylogenetic position of D. castanea is currently unknown. Overall, the fusions with the
sex chromosomes represented by D. americana (B element), D. lacertosa (D element), D. canalinea (D element),
D. castanea (B element) and the two analyzed in this study
of the melanica and robusta species groups (both D element), delineate six independent fusion events involving
either the B or D elements in the virilis-repleta radiation, a
clade that is estimated to have originated around 36 mya
during the late Eocene [46].

Interpretations of the ages of these chromosomal rearrangements are presented in the context of the Ks and PL
estimates, since the BD method yielded larger values with
considerably broader confidence intervals. The current
taxa broadly constrain the estimated age of the centromeric fusion in the robusta group. This rearrangement
could have arisen in an interval from 10 to 15 mya constrained by the time of divergence between D. robusta and
D. sordidula to the split between the robusta and melanica
groups (Fig 5, Table 5). Origin of the fusion in an Asian
ancestor prior to the divergence and dispersal of D. robusta
into North America is indicated [49], but this suggests a
more recent date than the 20–25 My previously inferred
for this dispersal event [61]. Conversely, origin of the
fusion in the melanica group is tightly constrained within
the consensus topology. The estimated age of fusion in the
melanica group is constrained to a minimum of 7.5 My,
corresponding to the divergence of D. nigromelanica, and
a maximum of 9 My, corresponding to the initial divergence within the group. This chromosomal rearrangement
apparently occurred following the dispersal of the ances-

Currently, sex chromosome evolution in the genus Drosophila has been investigated in a set of species representing disparate time points since the origin of the
rearrangements that form the newly sex-linked regions.
The youngest rearrangement is the fusion between the X
chromosome and an autosome in D. americana, which
appears to have originated less than 0.5 mya [60] and is
still segregating in populations with the ancestral arrange-

ment [30]. A slightly older (~1 My), but clearly more
diverged, newly sex-linked region is present in D. miranda
[63]. A fusion involving the sex chromosomes within D.
albomicans may represent an intermediate between these
two points [64]; however, the extent of divergence
between the newly X-linked and Y-linked regions is currently unknown. The derived component of the sex chromosomes in D.
pseudoobscura
is completely
heteromorphic and the causative rearrangement has been
estimated within a broad window of 6 to 10 mya [65].
This analysis suggests an older age for the origin of the
newly sex-linked arm in D. robusta, so given the recruitment of the dosage compensation machinery along the
newly derived arm of the X in both of these species
[22,23], a period of less than 10 My appears sufficient for
a complete transition to a heteromorphic state in the
absence of male crossing over. Narrow constraints on the
origin of the rearranged sex chromosome in the melanica
group, followed quickly by the divergence of two lineages
containing this rearrangement, makes this newly sexlinked region especially appealing for further analyses of
temporal patterns of divergence. Synapomorphic changes
within the newly sex-linked region of D. nigromelanica
and, for example, D. euronotus would reveal early events in
the transition from autosome to sex heteromorphic sex
chromosomes, whereas autapomorphic changes in these
species would reveal later events in this transition. However, these studies will ultimately require direct assessment of regions isolated from the neo-sex chromosomes.

Conclusion
The robusta and melanica species groups are two closely
related clades in the genus Drosophila containing independent rearrangements of their sex chromosomes. Ages
of the chromosomal fusion events responsible for generating the newly sex-linked arms in both groups are quite
old, consistent with previous studies indicating acquisition of dosage compensation on the new arm of the X
within D. robusta. Diversification in the melanica group
near the time of origin of its newly sex-linked region generated independent lineages in which the transition from
autosomal pair to heteromorphic sex chromosome may
have proceeded in parallel. The phylogenetic context
established by this analysis provides a framework for
comparative studies of sex chromosome evolution.

logical examination using a taxonomic key to the United
States species of Drosophila [66]. Species represented in the
analysis and previously unavailable in a public repository
have been deposited in the Tucson Drosophila Stock
Center.
A broad sample of outgroup taxa, representing the ancestral arrangement of the sex chromosomes, was also
included in the analysis. Sequences of D. funebris and D.
macrospina, representing the funebris species group, which
is basal to the virilis-repleta radiation [47,57], were used as
a distant outgroup to define the root in the phylogenetic
trees. Also, D. pavani and D. gaucha, belonging to the mesophragmatica species group, were used as representatives
of an early bifurcation of the virilis-repleta radiation [57].
D. virilis and D. borealis were included as representatives of
the virilis species group, which is closely related to the
robusta-melanica clade [47,49,57]. This sampling strategy
allowed the use of alternative biogeographic assumptions
in the dating estimation of the origin of the centric fusions
(see below).
Karyotype analysis
Metaphase chromosomes were obtained from third-instar
larval ganglia following the method of Pimpinelli [67].
Briefly, ganglia were dissected in 0.7% sodium chloride
and then transferred to a hypotonic treatment by incubating in 0.5% sodium citrate for 10 min. The ganglia were
fixed for 10 to 20 seconds in 3:1 ethanol:acetic-acid and
transferred to 4 μl of 45% acetic acid on a siliconized coverslip. Finally, each ganglion was squashed and preps
were frozen in liquid nitrogen for about 1 minute. Coverslips were removed and the preparations were dehydrated
in 95% ethanol for 10 minutes. Slides were stained with
4'-6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and mounted in
glycerol. Metaphase chromosomes from males and
females were digitally imaged and compared to reveal the
morphology of the sex chromosomes.

Sex chromosomes were identified by comparing the karyotypes of males and females to detect heteromorphism
between X and Y chromosomes. In particular, differential
degree of DAPI-staining was used as a morphological
marker of sex chromosomes, since Y chromosomes typically exhibit high affinity for DAPI due to enrichment in
AT-rich heterochromatin [68,69].

Methods
Flies
Flies were either obtained from recently collected material
maintained as iso-female lines or from the Tucson Drosophila Stock Center (Tucson, AZ). When possible, two different strains of each ingroup taxon were included in the
analysis. The source of each line used in the analysis is
listed in Table s1 (see Additional file 1). Species identification of collected material was determined by morpho-

DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing
A single fly from each line was homogenized and DNA
was extracted using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen). PCR
amplification was performed by mixing 1.0 μl of extracted
DNA with 49 μl of PCR master mix. Reaction conditions
for the PCR were 1× reaction buffer, 0.1 mM each dNTP,
0.2 μM each primer, and 2.5 units of Taq Polymerase
(New England Biolabs). Table s2 (see Additional file 2)

summarizes the primer sequences, annealing temperatures and fragment sizes of the PCR products used to
obtain the sequences of mitochondrial genes Cytochrome
oxidase I (mtCoI) and Cytochrome oxidase II (mtCoII), and
for nuclear X-chromosome gene regions of cacophony (cac)
and scute (sc). An MJ Research thermocycler was used to
incubate the reactions for 2 min at 95°C, and cycle 35
times at 95°C for 0.5 min, 0.5 min at the annealing temperature and 72°C for 1 min followed by 10 min at 72°C.
PCR product was purified with the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen).
Purified PCR products were sequenced with Big Dye Terminator Chemistry V3 (ABI). 5–10 ng of amplified target
was added to 4.5 μl of Big Dye reaction mix with 0.4 μM
of primer to a total volume of 10 μl. Reactions were
ramped to 96°C at 2.5°C/sec and cycled 30 times for 10
sec at 96°C, 5 sec at 50°C and 2 min at 60°C. Sequences
were cleaned using Wizard(r) Magnesil Green Sequencing
Reaction Clean-Up System (Promega) and analyzed with
an ABI 3730. Sequences were trimmed and edited using
Sequencher 3.1 (Gene Codes).
Phylogenetic analysis
Sequences of the mitochondrial genes were aligned using
ClustalX 1.81 [70] using default parameters. The nuclear
genes contained many indels within coding regions, so
following the removal of introns, the exon regions were
aligned against the respective alignment of amino acid
sequences using ClustalW as implemented in DAMBE
4.2.13 [71]. Nucleotide alignments were corrected by
hand using BioEdit [72]. Sites lacking clear evidence of
homology due to indels of codon repeats, as observed in
sc, were excluded from the analyses. Saturation at third
codon positions was inspected by plotting the uncorrected distances of transitions and transversions against
GTR + Γ pairwise distances estimated using PAUP 4.0b10
[73]. Codon positions with significant saturation were
removed to reduce noise in the phylogenetic signal.

In order to test for congruence among data partitions, 104
replicates of the partition homogeneity test (ILD) [74,75]
were run in PAUP 4.0b10, comparing the phylogenetic
signal within each of the following partitions: a) between
both mitochondrial genes, b) between both nuclear
genes, c) between mitochondrial versus nuclear genes,
and d) among all genes.
Phylogenetic analyses were executed in PAUP 4.0b10 for
maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood
(ML), and in MrBayes 3.0b4 [76] for Bayesian analysis
(BA). Optimal models of nucleotide substitution supported by the Akaike information criterion test (AIC) [77]
as implemented in ModelTest [78,79] were used in ML
and BA. Parameters for the priors of topology inference,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/33

used in BA, were tested and selected using MrModeltest
2.0 [80]. The confidence values for each clade in MP and
ML were assessed by bootstrap [81] with 103 pseudoreplicates, heuristic searching, and random-addition of
sequences. MP was assessed with differential weights for
transitions and transversions, using the values of those
parameters as estimated by ModelTest. In the BA analysis,
the run was conducted for 106 generations in four independent chains. The generations needed to reach the stationary state were evaluated by plotting the likelihood
values (-lnL) for 104 sampled trees. Only generations from
the stationary period were included in the computation of
the consensus tree, applying the 50% majority rule.
Hypothesis testing
A contrast among five plausible topologies bearing on the
origin of the rearranged sex chromosomes was performed.
The contrast included three constrained topologies consistent with independent origins of rearranged sex chromosomes in the melanica and robusta species groups, and
two topologies consistent with a single monophyletic origin of rearranged sex chromosomes. Although the general
contrast relating to alternative hypotheses regarding the
origin of the rearranged sex chromosomes was specified a
priori, the specific topologies used from this analysis were
based upon and included the maximum likelihood tree,
and therefore, the comparisons represent a mix of a priori
and a posteriori hypotheses (see Goldman et al [82] for statistical issues arising from such contrasts).

Contrasts were obtained using the approximately unbiased (AU) [83] and Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) [84] tests
performed in CONSEL ver. 0.1i [85]. Site-wise log-likelihoods were estimated for the five alternative topologies
using PAUP* under the GTR+I+Γ substitution model. The
credible set of topologies was determined using the
default parameters in the program makermt of the CONSEL package to obtain P-values derived from 10 sets of
10,000 bootstrap replicates of the likelihood matrix.
Dating estimation
The molecular clock was tested using the parameters estimated in Modeltest (see Results). Likelihood ratio tests
[86] did not reject the occurrence of a molecular clock
when mitochondrial or nuclear loci from the complete
data set were analyzed (CoI – CoII: -2ln Δ = 12.54, 18 df,
P = 0.82; cac – sc: -2ln Δ = 28.56, 18 df, P = 0.054). However, the molecular clock was rejected when only the melanica and robusta groups (the focal groups of this study)
were considered (CoI – CoII: -2ln Δ = 86.32, 18 df, P <
0.01; cac – sc: -2ln Δ = 838.47, 18 df, P < 0.01). Therefore,
the age of the centric fusions was estimated assuming a
molecular clock and with two relaxed methods not
dependent on this assumption.

Clock-based dating estimations were performed using the
concatenated sequences of the nuclear genes and the
Kimura 2-parameter distances for synonymous substitutions (Ks) as implemented in K-Estimator [87]. For the
molecular clock calibration we used a rate of synonymous
substitution of 7.95 × 10-9 substitutions per year, which
was obtained from analysis of Adh sequences including
17 species belonging to the planitibia group with D. picticornis as the outgoup (Genbank Accessions AY006408,
AY006410 – AY006425). Origin of the planitibia group
was dated at 6.1 mya by Bonacum et al [88] using levels of
molecular divergence and multiple geological calibration
points.
The divergence among mitochondrial sequences was
compared in a second analysis of dating estimation based
on Ks distances. Caletka and McAllister [60] proposed 3
Mya for the divergence between D. lummei and the common ancestor of the North American members of the virilis group based on biogeographic and paleoclimatic
evidence. Therefore, we estimated the Ks divergence
between D. lummei and the D. americana-D. novamexicana
clade using mtCoI in order to obtain an estimate of the
substitution rate of the mtDNA.
Despite the potential violation of the molecular clock,
divergence of synonymous substitutions was used for dating estimation because it permitted us to use a different
set of assumptions (rates of divergence, biogeographic
milestones and models of nucleotide substitutions) than
two relaxed molecular clock methods: penalized likelihood and Bayesian dating estimation.

exposed to the effect of dependence of parameters among
trees, since the MCMC algorithms modify only a few
parameters per generation. We set the prior for the mean
of the origin of the virilis-repleta radiation at 36 Mya, as
suggested by Throckmorton [46] based on the present distribution following the disjunction of tropical and temperate floras in North America, which occurred during the
late Eocene, and supported by the survey of molecular
divergence in Drosophila by Beverley and Wilson [91].
Bayesian dating (BD) was performed as implemented in
Multidivtime, which allows multiple data partitions
[92,93]. By using a MCMC algorithm, the posterior distributions of rates and divergences were obtained by specifying different substitution models for each partition. Four
partitions were used in this analysis: CoI (1st and 2nd
codon positions), CoII (1st and 2nd codon positions), cac
and sc. Parameters for the F84 + γ model, the most parameter-rich model implemented in Multidivtime, were estimated using PAML 3.14 [94]. Maximum likelihood and
variance-covariance matrix of the branch lengths were
estimated using the Estbranches program. Multidivtime
was used to obtain the posterior distribution of divergence dates and substitution rates for each node. MCMC
was performed by running 106 generations, with sampling
frequency every 100 generations and a burn-in period of
105. Confidence in node ages was assessed using 95%
credibility intervals. The posterior distribution analyses
were run ten times and the congruence among results was
checked in order to ensure the Markov chain reached stationarity. The calibration point was the same as used in
the PL method.

Penalized likelihood (PL) allows variation in rates along
branches was assessed using r8s version 1.7 [89]. First,
cross validation was performed to estimate the optimum
value of the smoothing parameter λ, by using the truncated-Newton method. The gamma shape estimated via
Modeltest for the concatenated data set was used as input
for this analysis. The virilis-borealis clade was pruned prior
to rate and divergence time estimations.

Authors' contributions

Estimation of confidence for node ages was assessed by
two different approaches. First, 103 trees were generated
by bootstrapping the data matrix and obtaining branch
lengths for the constrained consensus topology using
maximum likelihood. The resulting trees were used as separate inputs for r8s. Second, post-burnin trees, sampled
each 250 generations, were obtained using MrBayes and
filtered with PAUP to obtain a sample of 1,105 trees differing in branch length but containing the consensus
topology. The first approach has the inconvenience that
only one model of nucleotide substitution is applied to
the concatenated matrix. As pointed out by Schwarz et al
[90], the second strategy overcomes that difficulty, but is
