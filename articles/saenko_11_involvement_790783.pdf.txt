Involvement of the conserved Hox gene
Antennapedia in the development and evolution
of a novel trait
Suzanne V Saenko1,2, Marta SP Marialva1,3 and Patrícia Beldade1,3*

Abstract
Background: Hox proteins specify segment identity during embryogenesis and have typical associated expression
patterns. Changes in embryonic expression and activity of Hox genes were crucial in the evolution of animal body
plans, but their role in the post-embryonic development of lineage-specific traits remains largely unexplored. Here,
we focus on the insect Hox genes Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and Antennapedia (Antp), and implicate the latter in the
formation and diversification of novel, butterfly-specific wing patterns.
Results: First, we describe a conserved pattern of Ubx expression and a novel pattern of Antp expression in wing discs
of Bicyclus anynana butterflies. The discrete, reiterated domains of Antp contrast with the typical expression of Hox
genes in single continuous regions in arthropod embryos. Second, we show that this pattern is associated with the
establishment of the organizing centres of eyespots. Antp upregulation is the earliest event in organizer development
described to date, and in contrast to all genes implicated in eyespot formation, is exclusive to those centres. Third, our
comparative analysis of gene expression across nymphalids reveals unexpected differences in organizer determination.
Conclusions: We show that the Antp’s recruitment for the formation of novel traits in butterfly wing discs
involved the evolution of new expression domains, and is restricted to a particular lineage. This study contributes
novel insights into the evolution of Antp expression, as well as into the genetic mechanisms underlying
morphological diversification. Our results also underscore how a wider representation of morphological and
phylogenetic diversity is essential in evolutionary developmental biology.

Background
The origin and diversification of novel traits is one of the
most exciting unresolved issues in evolutionary developmental biology [1-4]. In the past two decades, multiple
studies revealed that novelties often evolve through
“teaching old genes new tricks”, as shared genes and/or
gene regulatory networks become co-opted to perform
new functions during development (reviewed in [5-8]).
Such recruitment can occur via the acquisition of new
expression domains, as has been shown for insect appendage patterning genes redeployed for the development of
head/pronotum horns in beetles [9], abdominal legs in
sepsid flies [10], and wing eyespots in butterflies [11].
Conserved transcription factors can also acquire new

target genes within their ancestral expression domains;
the diversification of insect wings, for example, has been
associated with changes in the set of genes regulated by
the Hox protein Ultrabithorax [12-14].
Hox proteins are conserved homeodomain transcription
factors that specify segment identity and are expressed in
characteristic patterns along the antero-posterior axis of
metazoan embryos [15]. For example, Ultrabithorax (Ubx)
and Antennapedia (Antp) are crucial for the specification
of thoracic segments and are associated with emblematic
homeotic transformations of insect appendages [5,15].
Comparative studies of Hox genes during embryogenesis
revealed that changes in their expression and activity
played crucial roles in the evolution of animal body plans
[16-18]. In contrast, little is known about their contribution to the formation of lineage-specific traits that develop
during post-embryonic stages. Here, we investigated the
involvement of Ubx and Antp in the development and

diversification of butterfly colour patterns that start to be
established in larval wing discs.
Butterfly wing patterns are visually compelling examples of evolutionary innovation. Pattern elements such as
stripes, spots, chevrons, and bands are not homologous
to pigment patterns in other animals [3], and can play
important roles in predator avoidance [19] and/or mate
choice [20]. Wing pattern diversity is astounding, with
striking variation documented not only between species,
but also between different wing surfaces of the same individual [21]. Nevertheless, colour patterns of most butterflies can be recognized as derivations of the “nymphalid
groundplan”, a schematic representation of homologies
among different elements, inferred from their morphology and location on the wing [21,22]. Many butterflies of
the family Nymphalidae bear (a series of) marginal eyespots, also called border ocelli, composed of concentric
rings of contrasting colours. Even though the morphology of nymphalid eyespots can vary considerably, their
location along the wing margin suggests that they have
evolved through modification of ancestral marginal
bands, which first ‘resolved’ into spots and later diversified in size and colour [21,22] (but see [23] for an alternative hypothesis). Similarities in the cellular and genetic
mechanisms of eyespot formation, revealed in laboratory
models Junonia coenia and Bicyclus anynana (reviewed
in [24-26]), further support a common evolutionary
origin of these pattern elements in nymphalids.
Several regulatory genes and signalling pathways involved
in such conserved processes as embryo segmentation
[27,28], appendage formation [11], and wound healing [29]
have been recruited for eyespot formation in butterfly
wings. Colour rings are presumably induced in a concentration-dependent manner by morphogens produced in the
presumptive eyespot centres in pupal wings [30,31]. The
establishment of these organizing centres occurs during the
last larval instar and involves the Hedgehog (Hh) and
Notch (N) signalling pathways and the transcription factors
Distal-less (Dll) and Spalt [32-35]. Similar expression of
these genes in eyespot organizers of all species examined to
date is consistent with the common evolutionary origin of
these pattern elements [21,22]. In this study, we report on
the recruitment of the Hox gene Antp in the early establishment of eyespot organizers during post-embryonic development. Our broad comparative analysis across nine species
of the family Nymphalidae shows that the involvement of
this and other genes in eyespot formation can be very lineage-specific, raising interesting issues about homologies.

Results and discussion
A novel expression pattern for Antp in the organizers of
an evolutionary novelty

Immunostainings in larval wing discs of Bicyclus anynana revealed a conserved expression pattern for Ubx

and a novel expression pattern for Antp. In 30 individuals
examined, spanning all sequential stages of larval wing
development (cf. the extent of tracheal extension into
vein lacunae [35]), the Ubx protein was detected
throughout the entire hindwing and nowhere in the
forewing (Figure 1A). The difference between fore- and
hindwing is identical to that described in other insects
and is consistent with Ubx’s role in the specification of
the third thoracic segment, including the associated
appendages and their characteristics [13-15]. The fact
that Ubx is expressed ubiquitously on the hindwing with
no association to any particular wing regions suggests
that this Hox gene, for which changes in expression have
been associated with colour pattern transformations in
J. coenia [13], is not involved in the determination of any
specific colour pattern element in B. anynana.
In contrast to Ubx, the Hox gene Antp was up-regulated
in both fore- and hindwings in discrete reiterated domains.
These correlate with the position and shape of eyespot
organizers in ‘wild-type’ butterflies (Figure 1A; 140 individuals) as well as in mutants with altered eyespot shape
and number (Figure 1B; 12 individuals). Both mRNA
(Figure 1C) and protein (Figure 1A) were detected in the
seven hindwing and in the four (potential) forewing eyespot organizers (that is, two that typically lead to eyespot
formation in ‘wild-type’ butterflies and two that can, and
that do so in laboratory mutants and selection lines
[36,37]). Hence, the up-regulated levels of Antp in larval
wings coincide with the epidermal cells which are competent to induce eyespot formation later on. Furthermore, to
our knowledge, such an expression pattern is novel for
Antp, which was never before detected in the developing
insect wing blade (even though it is up-regulated in the
margin of imaginal wing discs of Drosophila [15]), nor in a
series of discrete and reiterated domains. This seriallyrepeated pattern along the antero-posterior axis of the
wing contrasts with the characteristic continuous domain
of any Hox gene along the antero-posterior axis of developing arthropod embryos (see [15] and Figure 1E). Interestingly, this is also one of the few known examples of
Hox gene co-option through evolution of a new expression
pattern [38-41]. Other Hox genes, on the contrary, have
been shown to regulate the formation of insect novelties
through acquisition of novel targets within their ancestral
domains of expression [42].
Antp expression is the earliest event in organizer
establishment

Up-regulation of Antp occurs shortly after the last larval
molt, before that of any other gene so far associated
with the establishment of eyespot organizers. The protein was already detected in eyespot centres in 21 out of
26 individuals examined during the first two days of the
final instar, before the extension of trachea into the vein

artefact). Antp is detected in the presumptive eyespot organizers in both fore- and hindwing. (B) Adult (top) and larval (bottom) hindwing of

lacunae (Figure 1C and Additional file 1). All other
previously described organizer genes, for example, N
(until now the earliest gene detected in eyespot organizers [34]), and Dll and engrailed (two other early “eyespot genes” [32,33]) are known to be up-regulated in
eyespot centres only after the tracheal expansion [35].

Importantly, Antp was up-regulated in the presumptive
eyespot centres only. This is in contrast to all previously
described genes, whose expression in eyespot organizers
in larval wing discs is accompanied either by 1) butterfly-specific expression in intervein stripes (N and Dll),
presumably associated with midvein pigment patterns

[34], or 2) insect-specific expression along the wing
margin (Dll) and in the posterior wing compartment
(engrailed), associated with their conserved function in
wing development [32,33].
The finding that Antp is expressed exclusively in eyespot organizers suggests that the recruitment of this
Hox gene is specifically associated with the development
of these novelties in larval wing discs. Also, its early
expression suggests its involvement in the very initial
step of organizer establishment. It will be fascinating to
investigate the specific molecular changes underlying
the co-option of this Hox gene, as well as its interactions
with downstream regulators of eyespot development.
Future biochemically-focused analysis can establish if
and how Antp is up-regulated by (yet unknown) signals
diffusing from the wing veins and/or margin [21]. It can
also investigate if Antp activates Dll transcription via N
signalling in butterfly wings, a type of interaction that is
known to induce ectopic leg formation on Drosophila
heads [43]. The latter is reminiscent of the idea that
eyespots evolved by co-option of the insect appendage
patterning network and can be seen as ‘flat legs’ on butterfly wings [11]. Another exciting issue is whether this
regulatory network was co-opted as a whole, or whether
genes such as Antp, N and Dll were recruited to eyespot
patterning individually and re-wired de novo [44].

eyespot organizing centres is not as conserved as previously thought [26]. We, therefore, examined whether
other genes, implicated in eyespot formation in J. coenia,
and assumed to play similar roles in B. anynana, have
comparable expression patterns in both species.
Previous work implicated Hh signalling, crucial for
compartmentalization of insect wings [49], in J. coenia
eyespot organizer determination [33]. We examined
expression patterns of hh (the same part of the transcript
detected in J. coenia eyespots [33]) and its receptorencoding gene patched (ptc) in larval wing discs of B.
anynana (48 and 25 individuals, respectively; Figure 1D).
Transcripts of both genes were detected in spatial patterns typical of all insects (that is, hh in the posterior
wing compartment, ptc along the antero-posterior compartment boundary [33,50,51]). However, they were not
detected in the eyespot fields of B. anynana, even though
all stages of the last instar wing development were examined. This suggests that the Hh signalling pathway might
not be involved in eyespot organizer determination in
B. anynana. This absence of the Hh ligand and its receptor Ptc is quite remarkable as it suggests a potentially
Hh-independent activation of the signal transducer cubitus interruptus and its target engrailed, both previously
shown to be expressed in B. anynana organizers in larval
wings [33].

Different genes in eyespot organizers of two nymphalid
lab models

Broad comparative analysis reveals genetic divergence in
organizer establishment

Our analysis of Antp expression in B. anynana (subfamily
Satyrinae) suggested a role in the establishment of eyespot
organizers. Next, we investigated whether this Hox gene
plays a similar role in another nymphalid eyespot model,
Junonia coenia (subfamily Nymphalinae). Despite the fact
that the two species have diverged some 90 MYA [45],
their eyespots have strikingly similar appearance: in both
species they are formed by a central white pupil, an inner
black disc, and an outer golden ring (Figure 2). Like all
nymphalid border ocelli, they are thought to have a common evolutionary origin [21]. Surprisingly, our analysis of
wing discs from 85 J. coenia individuals, covering all stages
of the last instar wing development, revealed that, in contrast to what happens in B. anynana (Figure 2A), Antp is
never expressed in eyespot organizers or elsewhere in the
wings of J. coenia (Figure 2B). Immunostainings in
embryos of B. anynana and J. coenia (Figure 1E) showed
typical expression of Antp (strong in the thorax and weak
in the abdomen [46-48]), confirming that the anti-Antp
antibody does recognize the target protein in both species.
In contrast to Antp, N and Dll were detected in the intervein midlines and in eyespot organizers in both lab models
(Figure 2A, B). These findings suggest that expression of
N and Dll in J. coenia is under the control of some other
factors, and that the regulatory network establishing

The findings that different genes are expressed in eyespot organizers on wing discs of two lab models are in
stark contrast with all previous studies [32-34], and raise
questions about the origin and diversification of border
ocelli in Nymphalidae. To further address the involvement of Antp in the evolutionary diversification of nymphalid (eye)spots, we examined the expression of
different organizer genes in representative species from
the subfamilies Satyrinae and Nymphalinae (Figure 2).
Our analysis in four more species of the tribe Satyrini
(subfamily Satyrinae [45]), revealed that Antp, N, and Dll
are expressed in the presumptive eyespot organizers,
similar to B. anynana which also belongs to this tribe
(Figure 2A). In the more basal Caligo memnon (tribe
Brassolini, subfamily Satyrinae [45]) (Figure 2C), only
Antp was detected in the presumptive organizers. In this
species, N and Dll were not detected in the organizer
regions but were still present in other cells of the developing wing: N throughout the wing, Dll along the wing
margin. The absence of these two proteins in Caligo eyespots and intervein areas (contradicting a recent suggestion that expression of these genes in the intervein
midline is common to all butterflies [34]) might be associated with their unusual morphology (lack of round
white centres) or with their unusual location (hindwing

larval wing discs of representatives of the subfamily Satyrinae. Shown are sections of adult wings and the corresponding sections of larval wing
discs at late stages of development, when tracheae are extended into vein lacunae (visible here as black lines). N and Dll are initially expressed
in non-organizer areas (both in the intervein stripes, and Dll also along the wing margin), their expression in eyespot organizing centres occurs
after extension of the trachea into the lacunae (except in the basal satyrine C. memnon). (B) Expression of N and Dll in subfamily Nymphalinae
resembles that in Satyrinae, but Antp is absent from eyespot organizers at all stages of larval wing development. In both panels, numbers of

eyespots are shifted proximally). We also analyzed two
additional species of the subfamily Nymphalinae, to
which J. coenia belongs [45]. Representatives of this subfamily exhibit a wide range of marginal patterns (Figure
2B), including eyespots (as in J. coenia) or spots with no
obvious concentric rings (as in Inachis io and Melitaea
cinxia). Immunostainings revealed that expression of N

and Dll, but not of Antp, is associated with the establishment of these pattern elements in larval wing discs of
Nymphalinae.
The diversification of nymphalid eyespot morphology
had been previously attributed to changes in gene interactions during the pupal stage [27], with the same transcription factors associated to different eyespot rings and/or

Saenko et al. EvoDevo 2011, 2:9

pigments in different species [52]. In contrast, similarities
in the inductive properties of, and genes expressed in, the
eyespot organizers of J. coenia and B. anynana [30-34]
supported the idea that organizer determination in the
larval stage is conserved, reflecting their common evolutionary origin. However, our analysis of gene expression in
nine butterflies from the family Nymphalidae revealed
unexpected differences in the earliest known step of
pattern formation. We found that Antp and Hh signalling
are associated with eyespot organizers in Satyrinae and
Nymphalinae, respectively, while N and Dll are present in
the intervein midline and border ocelli in both subfamilies,
with C. memnon as an exception (Figure 2A). Taken
together, our findings suggest that the genetic mechanisms
underlying the first known step of eyespot formation differ
substantially across nymphalids. This can be either
because of their independent evolutionary origin, or
because of later divergence and great flexibility in gain and
loss of some components of the eyespot regulatory
network.

Conclusions
Our study describes a novel expression pattern for the
Hox gene Antp in butterfly wings, associated with the
initial differentiation stage of an evolutionarily novel
trait. We show that Antp is upregulated exclusively and
before any other described gene in the presumptive eyespot organizers, but only in one of two butterfly lineages
examined. Altogether, our results show that Antp was
redeployed to the developing wing disc and is associated
with the target novel trait (and is probably involved in
its formation), but only in a particular lineage (that is, it
is associated with its diversification). Co-option of this
conserved embryonic patterning gene to eyespot formation in larval wings occurred through the acquisition of
a new expression pattern - a series of discrete domains
that contrast with the characteristic Hox gene expression
in contiguous broad domains in arthropod embryos.
This illustrates that key developmental genes can evolve
novel expression characteristics, and opens up more biochemically-centred questions, including the identification and characterization of the molecular factors
immediately up- and downstream of Antp in this novel
context.
We also show that the expression patterns of Ubx, hh
and ptc in larval wing discs of B. anynana are consistent
with their conserved roles in all insects and do not correlate with any particular colour patterns in this species.
This is particularly interesting for ptc and hh which have
been associated with eyespot formation in another eyespot
model and are not expressed in B. anynana eyespots even
though their signal transducer cubitus interruptus and
downstream target engrailed are [33].

Our comparative analysis across nine species of Nymphalidae further highlights the genetic divergence in the
first step of organizer determination and demonstrates
that the redeployment of conserved genes can be very lineage-specific. This raises interesting issues about the identification of homologies. Homology is a concept with a clear
definition (common ancestry) but of notoriously difficult
assessment (see [3,53-55]). Homologies among structures
or patterns are typically inferred from their morphology
and location, and are further confirmed by comparative
studies of the underlying developmental programmes and
associated genetic networks [52,56]. However, homologous
structures can be determined by (more or less) diverged
genetic machinery, as are segments of insects [57]. Conversely, non-homologous structures can share genetic and
developmental mechanisms, as is the case for beetle horns
and insect legs [9]. Nymphalid eyespots, with well studied
serial homologies across elements repeated on one wing
and homologies across species [21-23], offer a good opportunity to investigate the extent to which morphological
and genetic data are consistent in the assessment of common evolutionary origin. Our broad comparative analysis
revealed the genetic divergence of the early stages of
eyespot organizer establishment, which might suggest
independent evolution of eyespots in different lineages.
This study emphasizes how a wider representation of both
morphological and phylogenetic diversity is so crucial in
evolutionary developmental biology [58,59].

Methods
Experimental animals

Bicyclus anynana wild-type and Cyclops laboratory stocks
were reared as in [60]. Larvae of other species were purchased from butterfly houses or provided by colleagues,
and reared in climate rooms or at room temperature
indoors and fed on Oplismenus (Heteropsis iboina) or
Poa grasses (Pararge aegeria and Melanargia galathea),
wheat (Lasiommata megera), narrowleaf plantain (Junonia coenia and Melitaea cinxia), nettles (Inachis io), or
banana leaves (Caligo memnon).
Gene cloning in B. anynana

Total RNA was extracted from embryos and larval wings
with Trizol (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and treated with
DNase (Ambion, Nieuwerkerk a/d lJssel, The Netherlands). The first strand complementary DNA was prepared
using Reverse Transcription System (Promega, Leiden, the
Netherlands) and the SMARTer RACE kit (Clontech,
Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) A 159 base pairs (bp)
fragment of Antp was amplified from embryonic cDNA
with degenerate primers 5’-CAGACCCTGGAGCTGGAGAARGARTTYCAYT and 5’-GCCCTTGGTCTTGTT
CTCCTTYTTCCAYTTC, and extended with the 5’RACE

in two rounds using primers 5’-GATTTGGCGCTCGGTGAGACAGAGG and 5’-CCGCGTCAGGTATCGGTTGAAGTGG. Sequence analysis of the obtained 450 bp
fragment of Antp revealed that this partial cds encodes
150 amino acids and shares 95% amino acid identity with
the Antp protein of the reference lepidopteran, the silkworm Bombyx mori (Additional file 2). A 339 bp sequence
of hh (provided by Arjen van’t Hof) was extended to 548
bp with the 5’RACE using 5’-GCTCCAGTGCCCACTGATGATTCTG and 5’-ACACTGATGGCGAGCGTG
TTCAACT primers. The corresponding 182 amino acid
product is closely similar to Hh proteins of other insects,
and shares 93% identity with Hh of J. coenia (Additional
file 2). A 2,305 bp sequence of ptc was provided by Arjen
van’t Hof. The corresponding 744 amino acid product
shares 97% identity with Ptc of J. coenia (Additional file 2).
All sequences were edited in BioEdit and aligned against
their insect homologues in NCBI BLAST, conserved
domains were detected with CD-search option. ExPASy’s
translation tool [61] was used to obtain the translations of
the nucleotide sequences. The ClustalW2 multiple alignment tool [62] was used to produce the protein alignments
and trees (with default settings). The nucleotide sequences
of B. anynana Antp, hh and ptc have been deposited to
GenBank (respective accession numbers:HQ020406,
HQ020407, HQ020408).
