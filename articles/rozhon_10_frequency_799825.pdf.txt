Frequency and diversity of small cryptic plasmids
in the genus Rahnella
Wilfried Rozhon1*, Elena Petutschnig2, Mamoona Khan1, David K Summers3, Brigitte Poppenberger1

Abstract
Background: Rahnella is a widely distributed genus belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae and frequently present
on vegetables. Although Rahnella has interesting agro-economical and industrial properties and several strains
possess antibiotic resistances and toxin genes which might spread within microbial communities, little is known
about plasmids of this genus. Thus, we isolated a number of Rahnella strains and investigated their complements
of small plasmids.
Results: In total 53 strains were investigated and 11 plasmids observed. Seven belonged to the ColE1 family; one
was ColE2-like and three shared homology to rolling circle plasmids. One of them belonged to the pC194/pUB110
family and two showed similarity to poorly characterised plasmid groups. The G+C content of two rolling circle
plasmids deviated considerably from that of Rahnella, indicating that their usual hosts might belong to other
genera. Most ColE1-like plasmids formed a subgroup within the ColE1 family that seems to be fairly specific for
Rahnella. Intriguingly, the multimer resolution sites of all ColE1-like plasmids had the same orientation with respect
to the origin of replication. This arrangement might be necessary to prevent inappropriate synthesis of a small
regulatory RNA that regulates cell division. Although the ColE1-like plasmids did not possess any mobilisation
system, they shared large parts with high sequence identity in coding and non-coding regions. In addition, highly
homologous regions of plasmids isolated from Rahnella and the chromosomes of Erwinia tasmaniensis and
Photorhabdus luminescens could be identified.
Conclusions: For the genus Rahnella we observed plasmid-containing isolates at a frequency of 19%, which is in
the average range for Enterobacteriaceae. These plasmids belonged to diffent groups with members of the ColE1family most frequently found. Regions of striking sequence homology of plasmids and bacterial chromosomes
highlight the importance of plasmids for lateral gene transfer (including chromosomal sequences) to distinct
genera.

Background
Rahnella, a genus of the Enterobacteriaceae, is commonly found in the rhizosphere [1,2] and phyllosphere
[3], seeds [4], fruits [5,6], water [7] and intestinal tracts
of herbivores including snails, slugs, and even American
mastodon remains [8,9]. In addition, Rahnella strains
have been isolated from the extreme environment of
uranium and nitric acid contaminated soil adjacent to
disposal ponds of the DOE Field Research Centre in the
Oak Ridge National Laboratory Reservation in Tennessee [10]. The genus Rahnella comprises three closely
related species that cannot be phenotypically

differentiated: Rahnella aquatilis, Rahnella genomospecies 2 and Rahnella genomospecies 3 [8].
In recent years interest in certain Rahnella strains
increased because of their remarkable properties. Rahnella might be useful for control of plant pathogens like
Erwinia amylovora causing fire blight of apple trees or
Xanthomonas campestris, the causal agent of black rot
[11,12]. Several strains seem to improve plant nutrition,
as they are able to fix nitrogen [2] and to solubilise
hydroxyapatite, thus converting phosphate to a plant
utilisable form [13]. The production of polysaccharides,
especially levan and lactan, by different Rahnella isolates
is intensively studied, because these macromolecules
have ideal properties for industrial applications [14-16].

opportunistic human pathogen but infections with Rahnella are usually limited to immunocompromised
patients and recovery is rapid [17-19]. However, antibiotic resistances and enterotoxins encoded by several
strains [20-22] might spread within microbial communities. Thus, an improved understanding of mobile
genetic elements of Rahnella is crucial to assess the
potential of lateral gene transfer to other species including human pathogens. Nevertheless, although Rahnella
is widely distributed and frequent on vegetables and
therefore likely to be routinely present in the human
diet, little is known about plasmids of this genus. So far
only one Rahnella plasmid, pHW15, has been characterised [6]. pHW15 belongs to the ColE1 family, is nonmobile and stably maintained even in the absence of
selective pressure. To gain insights into the frequency,
diversity and evolution of small (less than 15 kb) Rahnella plasmids, we isolated strains from different geographic origins and sample materials. Most plasmids
belonged to the ColE1 family but we also found members of other groups, including plasmids replicating by
the rolling circle mechanism. In addition, sequence analysis provided evidence for lateral gene transfer within
Rahnella as well as between Rahnella and other genera.

Results and Discussion
Isolation of strains, screening for plasmids and cloning

Forty five Rahnella strains were isolated from vegetables
obtained from supermarkets or sampled from fields. Isolates from the same sample were only included in the
collection if they differed in at least one biochemical
characteristic or the partial 16S rRNA gene sequence to
avoid multiple sampling of the same strain. This collection was complemented by 6 strains obtained from culture collections and two strains that had been previously
investigated for plasmid content (Table 1). Thus, in total
53 strains were included in this study and 10 of them
(19%) contained small plasmids, as revealed by DNA
isolation and subsequent gel electrophoresis. Nine of
these strains contained one plasmid and one of them
had two. Therefore, 10 novel plasmids were detected in
addition to pHW15. Their sizes ranged from 2.9 to 7.0
kb, which is typical for small plasmids from enterobacteria [23]. The method we used for detection of plasmid
DNA preferentially selects for small plasmids (below 20
- 30 kb) rather than large DNA molecules. Thus, the
presence of large plasmids in the investigated strains
cannot be excluded. Cloning and sequencing of the isolated plasmids revealed that the majority of them (7 of
11; 64%) belonged to the ColE1 group (plasmids
pHW15 to pHW42, Fig. 1). In addition, one ColE2-like
plasmid (pHW66) was isolated. The three remaining
plasmids (pHW121, pHW104 and pHW126) are likely
to replicate by the rolling circle mechanism. pHW121

belonged to the well-described pC194/pUB110 family,
while pHW104 and pHW126 showed homology to different groups of poorly characterised plasmids.
ColE1-like plasmids

The replication regions of the ColE1-like plasmids
showed the typical elements: RNA I, RNA II, a single
strand initiation site (ssi) and a terH sequence for termination of lagging-strand synthesis. Phylogenetic analysis
based on the RNA II sequence revealed that pHW15,
pHW120, pHW114A, pHW114B, pHW30076 and
pHW4594 represented a subgroup within the ColE1
family together with pECA1039, a plasmid isolated from
Pectobacterium atrosepticum [24]. pHW42 did not fall
into this subgroup and was more related to other
ColE1-like plasmids (Fig. 2A). Not only the replication
regions but also the multimer resolution sites (mrs)
were closely related in all ColE1-like plasmids of Rahnella. In a phylogenetic tree based on mrs sites (Fig. 2B)
most plasmids isolated from Rahnella formed a cluster
similar to the RNA II tree, confirming that they form a
separate class within the ColE1 family.
It might be thought surprising that all multimer resolution sites of plasmids depicted in Fig. 1 are in the
same orientation with respect to the replication origin
(oriV). This is also true for all ColE1-like plasmids in
Fig. 2A. The explanation for this observation may lie in
the intimate association of replication control and multimer resolution in the stable maintenance of ColE1-like
plasmids. Because all of the ColE1 replication origins in
a cell function independently, plasmid dimers (which
have two origins) replicate twice as often as monomers.
As a result, dimers accumulate rapidly and clonally in a
process known as the dimer catastrophe [25]. RNAIRNAII copy number control counts origins rather than
plasmids, so a dimer is not differentiated from two
monomers. Consequently the copy number (i.e the
number of independent molecules) of dimers is approximately half that of monomers. ColE1 lacks active partition, so plasmid stability requires the maintenance of a
high copy number. As a result the copy number depression caused by dimer accumulation causes plasmid
instability [26]. One part of the solution to this problem
is the resolution of dimers or higher multimers to
monomers by site-specific recombination. The multimer
resolution site of ColE1 (designated cer, for ColE1 resolution) contains binding sites for the host-encoded
recombinase XerCD and the accessory protein ArgR
(Fig. 2C). They act together with PepA (whose binding
site is less clearly defined) to convert dimers to monomers by site-specific recombination [27-30]. Conserved
A-T tracts phased at approximately 10.5 bp intervals
facilitate the curvature of the region between the ArgR
and XerC/XerD binding sites, which is thought to be

beneficial for recombination complex formation [31,32].
These sequence elements are conserved in the mrs sites
of the ColE1-like plasmids (Fig. 2C).
Multimer resolution is necessary but not sufficient to
combat the threat of the dimer catastrophe. A checkpoint, mediated by the small regulatory transcript Rcd,
ensures that the cell does not divide before multimers
have been resolved completely to monomers [33]. Rcd
binds to the enzyme tryptophanase, stimulating the production of indole which inhibits cell division by an
unknown mechanism [34]. Rcd is expressed from the
Pcer promoter within cer. Pcer is active in plasmid multimers but is repressed in monomers by FIS and XerCD
[35]. A FIS binding site important for regulation of Pcer
has been mapped recently [35] (Fig. 2C).
As stated above, we observed that the multimer resolution sites of the ColE1-like plasmids were in the same
orientation with respect to the replication origin (Fig. 1).
In other words RNAII and rcd are invariably transcribed
in the same direction. A possible explanation could lie
in the complex regulation of P cer . FIS is required for
high fidelity repression of the promoter in plasmid
monomers but it is the lifting of XerCD-mediated
repression in plasmid dimers which is thought to induce
synthesis of Rcd and the inhibition of cell division [35].
The main evidence supporting this hypothesis is that,
while the mutational inactivation of either XerC or
XerD in a cell containing plasmid monomers gave a
substantial increase in Rcd expression, there was no
induction of Rcd expression when ArgR or PepA was
inactivated [35]. RNAII read-through transcription
entering cer (or the mrs on related plasmids) would first
displace ArgR/PepA which will ensure that Pcer remains
inactive. If, however, cer was in the opposite orientation,
transcription might displace XerCD, inducing transient
expression of Rcd from plasmid monomers. A similar
argument can be made for the progress of the replication fork through cer. In the existing orientation the
fork will displace ArgR before XerCD, thus ensuring
that Pcer remains repressed during replication. Moreover,
active P cer facing in the opposite direction might

transiently stall the replication fork, since active promoters can act as replication barriers [36,37].
In addition to the replication unit and the mrs all
sequenced ColE1-like plasmids possessed a conserved
open reading frame with homology to excI of ColE1
(Fig. 1 and Additional file 1). ExcI was originally
believed to mediate entry exclusion of homologous plasmids [38] but later it was convincingly shown that
mbeD exhibits this activity [39]. Therefore the function
of ExcI remains unknown.
In addition to these general features most ColE1-like
plasmids contained highly conserved regions as indicated in Fig. 1. Clearly these plasmids show a highly
mosaic structure. Since pHW114A and pHW114B reside
in the same strain, their similarity can be potentially
explained by recent recombination events in their host.
However, the structures of the other plasmids argue
strongly for frequent horizontal transfer within Rahnella
and between Rahnella and Pectobacterium, the host of
pECA1039. Interestingly, none of the ColE1-like plasmids from Rahnella possessed any known mobilisation
system.
pHW66 is a ColE2-like plasmid

pHW66, like the ColE1-family plasmids, showed a
hybrid structure. It possessed a ColE2-like replication
system composed of a repA gene encoding the replication protein and a conserved nucleotide sequence that
might function as oriV (Fig. 3). While the replication
origins of ColE2-like plasmids are usually located immediately downstream of the repA gene [40], the putative
oriV of pHW66 was separated from repA by an insertion
of more than 2 kb with an unusually low G+C content
of 36% (the host strain of pHW66 has a G+C content of
51.8 ± 0.6%; Table 1). Interestingly, this insert comprised two genes that seemed to be cistronic with repA.
ORF2 showed distant similarity to a putative ATPase
from Shewanella woodyi and ORF3 was weakly homologous to a hypothetical protein from Lyngbya sp. (Additional file 1). Whether these genes have a role in
plasmid replication or maintenance cannot be predicted.

Larger regions exhibiting more than 85% sequence identity at the DNA level are marked with grey areas or are indicated below the sequence.
Nucleotide sequence identities are given in percent. Replication and transfer origins are shown above the DNA when they are located on the
sense strand and below if they are placed on the antisense strand. The plasmids pECA1039 and ColE1 as well as parts of the chromosomes from
P. luminescens TT01 and E. tasmaniensis Et1/99 are shown for comparison. Abbreviations: DRs, direct repeats; mrs, multimer resolution sites; oriT,
origin of transfer; oriV, origin of replication; ssi, single strand initiation site.

An insert of low G+C content adjacent to repA has also
been described for the ColE2-like plasmid pUB6060 [41]
but the inserts of pHW66 and pUB6060 are distinct.
Another module found on pHW66 was a mobilisation
system of the ColE1-superfamily composed of a conserved transfer origin (oriT) and 4 genes: mobA, mobB,
mobC and mobD [42]. Close homologues of these genes
were present on pUB6060, highlighting the close relationship between pHW66 and pUB6060. It is also interesting to note that neither pHW66 nor pUB6060
possessed a XerCD-type multimer resolution system,
although this type is frequent among ColE2-like plasmids [40]. The last module was located downstream of

the mobilisation system and consisted of two open reading frames with remarkable homology to two consecutive genes of unknown function in the chromosome of
Erwinia tasmaniensis Et1/99 [43]. The significance of
this will be discussed below.
Plasmids sharing homology to rolling circle replicons

While the plasmids described above exhibited clear
homology to previously classified plasmids, database
searches with pHW121 retrieved only distantly-related
sequences. The translated amino acid sequence of the
largest ORF of pHW121 was 19%, 17% and 16% identical to replication proteins of pZMO1, pCA2.4 and

pUB110, respectively (Additional file 1). Importantly, the
metal binding domain showed the typical signature
HUHxLUxV and the catalytic domain contained the
conserved Tyr residue involved in the nucleophilic
attack on the plasmid DNA at initiation of replication
[44], identifying orf1 as repA and pHW121 as a member
of the pC194/pUB110 family. A sequence was present
upstream of repA that might function as oriV (Fig. 4A).

Figure 3 ColE2 origins of replication. The thick arrow indicates
the primer RNA and direction of replication in ColE2-P9. Further
codes as in Fig. 2.

Interestingly, the putative oriV was preceded by 16 perfect and 1 imperfect direct repeats of the sequence
GGGTTTT. Such a motif has not been described so far
for any pC194/pUB110-like plasmid. In addition,
pHW121 possessed a putative mobilisation protein of
the MOBQ family. Although the homology was low, the
typical motifs were present [42]. Due to a lack of conservation no putative oriT could be identified. ORF3 of
pHW121 was similar to ImcC of Legionella pneumophila. Several genes of the imc/dot complex are essential
for the ability of L. pneumophila to survive in macrophages during lung infection such as Legionnaires’ disease. However, no function has so far been attributed to
ImcC [45].
pHW104 showed similarity to members of a poorly
studied plasmid family (Fig. 4B). A 298 amino acid protein of pHW104 showed more than 70% identity to the
putative replication protein of pVCG1.2 and 22.5% identity to RepA from pAM10.6. The involvement of the latter in replication has been proven experimentally [46].
In addition pHW104 comprised a ColE1-type

Figure 4 pHW121, pHW104 and pHW126 belong to different classes of plasmids replicating by the rolling circle mechanism. (A) A
stretch upstream of the pHW121 repA gene is similar to replication origins of pC191/pUB110-family plasmids and the E. coli bacteriophage
öX174. The experimentally determined cleavage sites of pC194 and öX174 are indicated by vertical arrows. (B) pHW104 and pHW126 are
members of poorly characterised families of rolling circle plasmids. The G+C contents calculated for pAM10.6 and pM3 are based on partial
sequences. (C) Evidence that pHW126 replicates via the rolling circle mechanism. Constructs containing two origins of replication of pHW126
and, as control, pHW15 were grown E. coli INVaF’ for 40 generations. Subsequently DNA was isolated and analysed by restriction digestion with
HindIII (similar results were obtained for digests with SalI; data not shown). The expected positions of constructs containing one or two origins
are indicated by arrows. The deletion of the second origin was confirmed by sequencing (data not shown). The size of the marker bands is

sequences retrieved from the Genome Project Database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes. For strains with unavailable genomic G+C

mobilisation system (Fig. 5A) and two open reading
frames of unknown function.
pHW126, the smallest plasmid found in the genus
Rahnella, belonged to a novel, yet uncharacterised class
of plasmids. It consisted of only 2886 bp and possessed
two ORFs. ORF1 showed similarity to relaxases of the
pMV158-superfamily mediating plasmid mobilisation.
The characteristic motif HxDExxPHxH, as well as an
invariant Arg residue in the N-terminus, were present
[42] and a putative oriT could be identified approximately 100 bp upstream of orf1 (Fig. 5B). Thus orf1 was
named mob. BLAST and FASTA searches with the

translated amino acid sequence of ORF2 identified
homologous sequences from two uncharacterised plasmids from Klebsiella pneumoniae, pIGRK and
pIGMS31, and one plasmid from Ruminobacter amylophilus, pRAO1 (55.8%, 26.1%, and 22.7% identity,
respectively). Iterated PSI-BLAST searches with ORF2
from pHW126 as well as with Rep from pHW104
retrieved sequences of replication proteins from pSN2like plasmids and pJW1, indicating that all these plasmids might form a super-family (Fig. 4B). However, the
Rep sequence identity between members of different
clades shown in Fig. 4B was around 10% in pair wise

alignments and only two amino acids are invariant in all
replication proteins of the plasmids analysed (Additional
file 2). A final decision whether these plasmids are
members of a common super-family is not possible.
The very weak similarity of pHW126 to well characterised plasmids raised the question whether pHW126
should be classified as a rolling circle plasmid. However,
we observed that increasing the size of pHW126 to more
than 5 kb by insertion of foreign DNA fragments rendered this plasmid unstable (data not shown) which is a
common phenomenon for rolling circle vectors [47]. To
provide further experimental evidence a construct containing the rep gene and two copies of the upstream
sequences in tandem repeat was generated. These
upstream sequences are presumed to contain the origin
of replication which is usually located 5’ of the rep gene
in rolling circle plasmids. This construct was transformed
into the recA - strain E. coli INVa F’ and independent
clones were grown for 40 generations. Plasmid DNA prepared from these cultures showed two bands after linearisation with restriction enzymes (Fig. 4C). The larger band
of approximately 3.1 kb corresponded to the introduced
plasmid. The smaller band, present in variable amounts,
had a size of approximately 2.7 kb, consistent with the
loss of one copy of the origin of replication. Frequent
deletion of one replication origin is evidence for a rolling
circle replication mechanism, because replication
initiated at the second origin may terminate at the first.
This causes that the part of the plasmid between the two

origins to be deleted [47]. As a control a similar construct
containing two copies of the ori from pHW15 (a ColE1
like plasmid replicating by a theta mechanism [6]), was
tested in the same way. This construct maintained both
origins as indicated by presence of only one band with a
size of 3.7 kb (deletion of one ori would have reduced the
size to 2.5 kb). These data provide convincing evidence
that pHW126 replicates by the rolling circle replication
mechanism, and that the origin of replication is located
upstream of the rep gene.
Both pHW121 and pHW126 showed strikingly low G
+C contents of only 37.3% and 31.5%, respectively.
Usually the G+C contents of plasmids are correlated
with the chromosomal G+C contents of their hosts
(Fig. 4B and 4D). pHW121 as well as pHW126 and its
close homologues pIGRK, pIGMS31 and pRAO1
clearly deviate from this rule. Many rolling circle plasmids isolated from Gram positive bacteria have a low
G+C content [48-50] (Fig. 4B). Thus pHW126 and its
homologues might have been acquired from Gram
positive bacteria. On the other hand, Ruminobacter
amylophilus, the host species of pRAO1, has a G+C
content of approximately 41%. Recently plasmids with
low G+C content in their replication regions, which
are distinct from pHW121 or pHW126, were isolated
from soil bacteria. These plasmids could replicate in E.
coli but their natural host might be Acinetobacter [51],
a genus of Gram negative bacteria with a G+C content
of about 40%. Also some genera of the Enterobacteriaceae, e.g. Buchnera, Hamiltonella, Proteus or Moraxella have strikingly low G+C contents. It will be
interesting to see if plasmids similar to pHW126 are
isolated from such genera or from Gram positive
microorganisms in the future.
Evidence for horizontal exchange of genetic information
between plasmids from Rahnella and
bacterial chromosomes

Several plasmids possessed genes or regions homologous to sections of enterobacterial chromosomes
(Additional file 1). The most interesting examples were
parts of pHW66, which were homologous to the chromosome of Erwinia tasmaniensis Et/99, and a gene
cluster of pHW4594 similar to an operon of Photorhabdus luminescens TT01. Stretches of approximately
1600 bp and 140 bp of pHW66 had identities of more
than 90% to parts of the chromosome of E. tasmaniensis Et1/99 at the nucleotide level (Fig. 1). The 140 bp
region of pHW66 was a small part of the plasmid
mobA gene while the 1600 bp region comprised orf5
and 89 bp upstream of it, orf6, the intergenic region
between orf6 and repA and the main part of repA. The
corresponding region on the E. tasmaniensis chromosome had a similar architecture: two small open

Rozhon et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:56
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/56

reading frames of unknown function and a repA-like
gene. Interestingly, while RepA proteins encoded by
ColE2-like plasmids showed a high degree of similarity
from the N- to the C-terminus, the RepA-like protein
of E. tasmaniensis Et1/99 was highly similar at the Nterminus but the last 45 amino acids were unrelated
(Additional file 3). This RepA version might therefore
not be functional. A BLAST search with the E. tasmaniensis Et1/99 region homologous to pHW66 indicated
a hybrid structure: the 3’ part harbouring the two
ORFs was similar to other enterobacterial chromosomes, while the 5’ part containing the truncated repA
retrieved only plasmid sequences. With the full-length
sequence there was no hit apart from pHW66. This
region of the E. tasmaniensis Et1/99 chromosome
might therefore be the result of a recent insertion of a
part of a plasmid related to pHW66.
pHW4594 possessed a cluster of three genes, orf4,
orf5 and orf6, that showed homology to an operon of
the P. luminescens chromosome (Fig. 1). Although
similar genes were also present in other genera, this
particular arrangement could only be observed in P.
luminescens. However, since the chromosome of Rahnella is not sequenced, this gene cluster of pHW4594
might also originate from the genome of its host. To
test this hypothesis we investigated genomic DNA of
several Rahnella strains by Southern blot analysis
using a probe containing the main parts of orf5 and
orf6 (Fig. 6). Only in the host strain of pHW4594,
DSM 4594 T , a signal could be detected which corresponded to the expected restriction fragment of the
plasmid itself. Signals indicative of genomic copies of
orf5 and orf6 could neither be detected in DSM 4594T,
nor in any other strains of Rahnella aquatilis. Different
strains of Rahnella genomospecies 1 and genomospecies 2 did not show any signal either. Thus, it is most
likely that the orf4 orf5 orf6 gene cluster originates
from P. luminescens (or another species) but not from
Rahnella.
Photorhabdus is an enterobacterial symbiont of soil
nematodes that infect various insects. After the nematode attacks an insect P. luminescens is released and
produces a wide range of virulence factors ensuring
rapid insect killing [52]. Recently it has been shown that
Rahnella is the predominant species in the intestinal
tract of the ghost moth Hepialus gonggaensis [53], indicating that Rahnella might frequently be present in
insects. On the other hand, E. tasmaniensis is common
on apple and pear barks and blossoms, and Rahnella
has been isolated from apple and pear fruits [5,6,54].
Therefore, Rahnella seems to have overlapping habitats
with P. luminescens and E. tasmaniensis, which might
favour exchange of mobile genetic elements between
Rahnella and these species.

Figure 6 The orf4 orf5 orf6 gene cluster of pHW4594 is not
derived from its host. DNA from different Rahnella strains was
digested with HindIII (right panel) and subsequently analysed with
an orf5 orf6 specific probe (left panel). Two different amounts of
DNA were loaded of DSM 4594T, the host strain of pHW4596, to
account for plasmid copy number (approximately 3 μg and 0.2 μg
in the first and second lane, respectively). The detected band
corresponded to the restriction fragment of the plasmid pHW4594
with an expected size of 1.3 kb. The same result was obtained with
HpaII digested DNA (data not shown). GS, genomospecies.

Conclusions
The frequency of small (less than 15 kb) plasmids is
highly variable within the Enterobacteriaceae. For
instance, they are extremely rare in Citrobacter freundii
while 42% of Escherichia coli isolates possess at least
one plasmid [23]. For the genus Rahnella we observed
plasmid-containing isolates at a frequency of 19%, which
is in the average range. ColE1-like plasmids were the
predominant family, which is typical for enterobacterial
genera. Most ColE1-like plasmids from Rahnella formed
a subgroup within the ColE1 family on the basis of
RNA II or mrs-based phylogenetic trees. The mrs sites
of the ColE1-plasmids were arranged in a constant
orientation with respect to the replication origin. Such
conservation is likely to prevent inappropriate activation
of the Pcer promoter by read-through transcription or
during replication. High-fidelity control of Pcer is essential because the promoter directs expression of a small
RNA that causes inhibition of cell division by stimulating indole production. The ColE1-plasmids shared
extensive regions of high sequence homology in coding
and in non-coding regions, indicating frequent horizontal gene transfer and recombination events among plasmids within the genus Rahnella. Interestingly, none of
the ColE1-like plasmids found in this study possessed a
mobilisation system. In contrast, the other plasmids

Rozhon et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:56
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/56

analysed (one ColE2-like plasmid and three rolling circle
plasmids) contained mobilisation genes. pHW121 is a
member of the pC194/pUB110 family. pHW104 and
pHW126 belong to different groups of poorly-characterised plasmids and might form a super-family with
pSN2-like plasmids and pJW1. To our surprise the plasmids lacked genes which confer an obvious benefit upon
their hosts. Of course some of the genes with unknown
function might encode proteins with advantageous functions but at least for some of the plasmids the term
“selfish DNA” seems appropriate. The best example is
pHW126, the smallest plasmid found in Rahnella. This
plasmid possessed only two ORFs, a putative replication
gene and one for mobilisation. Since these coding
sequences cover more than 70% of the plasmid, and
additional regions are expected to function as oriV and
oriT, the plasmid is simply too small to bear any gene
beneficial to the host. The low G+C content of this plasmid might indicate that Rahnella is not its normal host.
In contrast, the close similarities among the ColE1-like
plasmids provided compelling evidence that Rahnella is
their normal host. The presence of genes probably
derived from P. luminescens on pHW4594 and stretches
of the chromosome of E. tasmaniensis highly homologous to parts of pHW66 highlight the importance of
plasmids for genetic exchange of even chromosomal
sequences among different genera.

electrophoresis. The strains WMR15 and WMR58
(Table 1) were used as positive and negative controls,
respectively. Plasmid DNA for cloning was isolated with
a Genomed plasmid midi kit and further purified by
agarose gel electrophoresis. Plasmid DNA was digested
with appropriate restriction enzymes and cloned into
pBluescriptIIKS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) cut with the
same enzyme or an enzyme forming compatible ends.
Both strands were sequenced by primer walking. A complete sequence for each plasmid was obtained by assembling individual reads with ContigExpress from the
VectorNTI package (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Sequence annotation and phylogenetic analysis

E. coli and Rahnella strains were grown in MLB medium (10 g/l peptone, 5 g/l yeast extract, 5 g/l NaCl, pH
7) at 37°C and 30°C, respectively, if not otherwise indicated. When necessary, ampicillin was added to a concentration of 100 mg/l.

Plasmid DNA sequences and predicted open reading
frames were used for BLAST, PSI-BALST and FASTA
databank searches at the genebank http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov and ddbj http://www.ddbj.ac.jp websites. AlignX
from the VectorNTI package was used to identify
further less conserved or short elements e.g. oriV, oriT
or ssi sites. The same program was employed to calculate the global identity of plasmid ORFs and sequences
retrieved from databases. Phylogentic analyses were performed with MEGA4 [56]. Neighbour-joining (NJ) trees
were constructed using the p-distance model for DNA
and the JTT matrix for amino acid sequences. Positions
with gaps were usually completely deleted except for
alignments containing highly diverse sequences, where
pair wise deletion was chosen. Bootstrap values were
calculated from 1000 replicates and indicated at the corresponding nodes. Almost identical tree topologies were
obtained with other methods (minimum evolution and
UPGMA) and models (Poisson correction, PAM). G+C
contents of plasmids were calculated using ARTEMIS
10 [57].

Isolation and identification of Rahnella strains

Detection of ori deletion

Different types of plant materials (Table 1) were homogenised in sterile PBS and dilutions plated on LevineEMB agar (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). After incubation at 36°C for 48 ± 8 h dark colonies were sampled
and restreaked twice on MLB plates to obtain pure cultures. Strains were classified by routine biochemical
tests and partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing [6]. For
amplification of the 16S rRNA gene the primer pair fD2
and rP1 was employed. The PCR product was purified
with a Nucleospin Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) and directly sequenced using the primers 16S-3
and 16S-5. Primer sequences are shown in Additional
file 4.

pHW126 was digested with BglII and HindIII and the
1463 bp fragment containing the putative rep gene and
the upstream intergenic sequences cloned into pBKanT
[6] linearised with BamHI/HindIII. The resulting construct, designated pB126ΔBH, was digested with SpeI,
the 446 bp fragment isolated and cloned into the same
construct digested with XbaI which led to construct
pB126-2ori. This construct was used to assay replication origin deletion: pB126-2ori was digested with SalI
and the fragment containing the Kan R gene and the
pHW126 sequences isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The purified DNA was diluted to a concentration of 1 ng/μl and self-circularised by incubation
with 1 U T4 ligase for 1 h at room temperature in a
total reaction volume of 20 μl leading to pHW1262ori. After transformation into E. coli INVa F’ the
cells were plated on MLB-kanamycin (30 μg/ml) plates

Methods
Media and growth conditions

Cloning and sequencing of the plasmids

Presence of plasmids was investigated by standard alkaline lysis miniprep [55] and subsequent agarose gel

Rozhon et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:56
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/56

and incubated overnight at 37°C. Three individual
colonies were transferred completely to 100 ml MLBKan medium each and grown overnight. Plasmid DNA
was isolated from these cultures using a Genomed
plasmid midi kit as recommended by the manufacturer. Formation of plasmids containing only one
pHW126 origin of replication was observed by agaraose gel electrophoresis after digestion with HindIII or
SalI. For confirmation, both bands were cut out,
extracted with a Macherey-Nagel gel extraction kit and
used as a template for PCR amplification with the primer pair pHW126-11/Kan rev. The amplification product was cleaned and directly sequenced employing
the same primers as used for PCR. As a control
pHW15-2ori, which possesses two pHW15 origins of
replication in tandem repeat, was tested in the same
way. pB15In(NsiI) was constructed by inserting
pHW15 [6] linearised with NsiI into pBKanT. Subsequently, this construct was linearised with HindIII and
PstI and ligated with the 1218 bp fragment obtained by
digesting pBKanT-pHW15Δ(ORF1+2+3) [6] with HindIII and NsiI. This led to construct pB15-2ori which
was finally digested with SalI and self-circularised to
obtain pHW15-2ori.
Southern blot analysis

Approximately 3 μg genomic DNA were digested with
an appropriate restriction enzyme and separated by
agarose gel electrophoresis. After denaturation with 0.5
M NaOH, neutralisation with 5× TBE and equilibration
with 1× TBE the DNA was transferred to a Hybond-N+
membrane (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) by
semi-dry electroblotting using 1× TBE as transfer buffer.
Cross linking was achieved by irradiation with 120 mJ/
cm2 UV of 254 nm. Subsequently, the membrane was
pre-hybridised with Church buffer [58] containing 100
μg/ml freshly denaturated herring sperm DNA. The
probe was prepared by PCR: a 50 μl reaction contained
1 U GoTaq (Promega, Madison, WI), 10 μl 5× buffer
containing Mg2+, 1 ng pHW4594 as template, 1 μl primer mix (pHW4594-fwd/pHW4595-rev; each 5 μM), 1
μl nucleotide mix (0.5 mM each of dATP, dGTP and
dTTP and 0.05 mM dCTP) and 30 μCi [a-32 P]-dCTP
(3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). After an
initial denaturation step at 94°C for 5 min 35 cycles of
94°C for 30 sec, 50°C for 1 min and 72°C for 2 min
were performed prior a final extension step at 72°C for
10 min. The denaturated amplicon (95°C, 10 min) was
added to the blocked membrane and hybridised for 18 h
at 60°C. The membrane was washed 5 times with 0.05%
SDS in 1× SSC [51] at 60°C and once with distilled
water at room temperature. Signals were detected by
autoradiography.
