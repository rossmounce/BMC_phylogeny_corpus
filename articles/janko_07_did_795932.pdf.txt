Abstract
Background: Circum-Antarctic waters harbour a rare example of a marine species flock – the Notothenioid fish, most species
of which are restricted to the continental shelf. It remains an open question as to how they survived Pleistocene climatic
fluctuations characterised by repeated advances of continental glaciers as far as the shelf break that probably resulted in a loss
of habitat for benthic organisms. Pelagic ecosystems, on the other hand, might have flourished during glacial maxima due to the
northward expansion of Antarctic polar waters. In order to better understand the role of ecological traits in Quaternary climatic
fluctuations, we performed demographic analyses of populations of four fish species from the tribe Trematominae, including
both fully benthic and pelagic species using the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and an intron from the nuclear S7 gene.
Results: Nuclear and cytoplasmic markers showed differences in the rate and time of population expansions as well as the likely
population structure. Neutrality tests suggest that such discordance comes from different coalescence dynamics of each marker,
rather than from selective pressure. Demographic analyses based on intraspecific DNA diversity suggest a recent population
expansion in both benthic species, dated by the cyt b locus to the last glacial cycle, whereas the population structure of pelagic
feeders either did not deviate from a constant-size model or indicated that the onset of the major population expansion of these
species by far predated those of the benthic species. Similar patterns were apparent even when comparing previously published
data on other Southern Ocean organisms, but we observed considerable heterogeneity within both groups with regard to the
onset of major demographic events and rates.
Conclusion: Our data suggest benthic and pelagic species reacted differently to the Pleistocene ice-sheet expansions that
probably significantly reduced the suitable habitat for benthic species. However, the asynchronous timing of major demographic
events observed in different species within both "ecological guilds", imply that the species examined here may have different
population and evolutionary histories, and that more species should be analysed in order to more precisely assess the role of
life history in the response of organisms to climatic changes.

Background
The Antarctic and its surrounding ocean are mostly considered as a system isolated from the rest of world by the
Antarctic Polar Front (APF), a circum-Antarctic current
extending to about 1000 m depth, which greatly reduces
the exchange of surface waters and marine organisms [1].
Despite some interconnections of marine biota from
north and south of the APF [2-4], it seems likely that evolution in isolation within the APF resulted in cladogenetic
events that lead to the formation of endemic taxa [5-9].
Organisms within the APF had to contend with freezing
water temperatures and the potential eradication of their
habitat by ice sheet advance and grounding, a phenomenon that that affects the Antarctic ecosystem on a scale
much greater than elsewhere.
Antarctic ice sheet extension over the continental shelf
during the glacial maxima [10] and the related intense
flows of debris [11], extensively reduced the habitat suitable for benthic biota. In consequence, these species were
either fragmented into geographically restricted glacial
refuges, or escaped to a greater depths [12]. In contrast,
pelagic ecosystems are likely to be less affected and might
have even experienced a population expansion during glacial maxima as suggested e.g. by the Northward shift of
the APF during last glacial maximum (LGM) [[13];
although this scenario is still debated] or by Northward
expansions of Antarctic plankton [14] and increased ecosystem productivity [15,16]. Such a glacial-mediated eradication hypothesis provides us with testable predictions
about the evolution of benthic and pelagic biota.
A coalescent population genetic model constitutes a
framework for the development of efficient tests (either
analytical or based on computer simulations), from
which we may draw inferences about the forces affecting
the evolution of populations including selection, population structuring, and demographic fluctuations. Many
methods using different assumptions and types of
sequence information have been proposed to detect the
traces of population growth from DNA sequence data (for
review see [17]). Recent advances in computational methods have also given rise to demographic inference tools
that take into account phylogenetic relationships among
haplotypes (see e.g. [18]). It is also possible to test for scenarios more complicated than simple population growth,
such as a bottleneck, characterised by drop in population
size at some time with a reduction of diversity, followed
by a population expansion [19].
Only a few studies of the demographic histories of Antarctic marine and coastal organisms have been done because
of the difficulties in obtaining samples. Studies using historical demographic inference tools have so far found that
population expansions are linked to deglaciations for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/220

coastal populations of Collembolans and penguins
[20,21] and indicated population expansions of pelagic
krill [22] and fish [16], putatively correlated with the
onset of ice sheet expansion.
Notothenioid fish occupy an interesting position in evolutionary research because of an adaptive radiation
thought to be associated with the onset of freezing water
temperatures during the Miocene [12]. It seems plausible
that the radiation had a high-Antarctic origin [rev. in [23]]
probably associated with niche opening after the loss of a
tertiary fish fauna unable to cope with low temperatures
in the Miocene. It is proposed that a putative notothenioid benthic ancestor that possessed antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGP; [24]) protecting against the growth of ice
crystals in the blood or gut was able to uniquely exploit
now vacant ecological niches. This led to a radiation of
many species strikingly diverse in morphology and lifehistory, ranging from small bottom feeders to neutrallybuoyant pelagic species more than two metres in length.
There remains doubt as to about the timing of the radiation of AFGP-bearing Notothenioidei, which is variously
estimated to have occurred from 11 millions of years ago
(Mya) [25] to 21 Mya [5], or 24 Mya [26]. Furthermore, at
least three recent radiations appeared within the Notothenioidei, giving rise to the Channichthyid-Bathydraconid subfamily crown group [27,28] and to the tribe
Trematominae [29,30].
Despite much work into the phylogenetic relations of
notothenioids and their physiological adaptations and
ecology [e.g. [23,31,32]], little is known of the microevolutionary patterns of these fishes. To investigate the role of
glacial cycles and the subsequent habitat changes, we
studied the genetic variability and historical demography
of four notothenioid species belonging to the tribe Trematominae; Trematomus bernacchi, T. pennelli, Pagothenia
borchgrevinki and T. newnesi. This tribe is thought to result
from an adaptive radiation roughly correlated with
Pliocene warming about 3.5 My ago [29], or dated at 9.8
My ago [[26]: Table 1 line L]. All four species are distribTable 1: Geographical origin of the samples of used in this study

uted in the high Antarctic zone, but with different life-histories. Trematomus bernacchii and T. pennelli are bottom
feeding stationary fish with demersal eggs and some kind
of parental care and pelagic larvae, whereas P. borchgrevinki and T. newnesi are cryopelagic (i.e. living in platelet
ice) and semipelagic, respectively, with pelagic larvae
[33,34]. We were particularly interested in the responses
of these four species to well-documented climatic changes
that are likely to have affected all the Southern Ocean
fauna. We predict that benthic fish species are more prone
to local extinctions caused by glacial advance onto the
shelf, than are pelagic or semipelagic fish, and therefore
benthic species are likely to have passed through more
severe and recent population bottlenecks during glacial
maxima than have pelagic or semipelagic species.

Methods
Collected samples are summarized in the Figure 1 and
Table 1.
DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing analyses
Total genomic DNA was extracted from muscle or fin tissues using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen) following the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/220

manufacturer's specifications. A 600 bp fragment of cytochrome b (cyt b) was amplified in both species by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers CytBU15786-Tremato (5'- TGAGGkGGrTTTTCGGTAGATA-3')
and CytB-L16317-Tremato (5'- GATrTAnGGrTCCTCAaCGGG-3'). Polymerase chain reactions were performed according to the published protocol [28]. The first
intron in the S7 gene was amplified under following conditions:
primers
S7RPEX1F
(TGGCCTCTTCCTTGGCCGTC)
and
S7RPEX2R
(AACTCGTCTGGCTTTTCGCC) [35]; the reaction volume
of 25 μl contained 2,5 μl of reaction buffer, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 1 μl of A, T, C, G nucleotide mix (0.01 M), 0.5 μl
of each primer (0.01 M), 1.25 units of Taq polymerase
(TopBio) and ~100 ng of genomic DNA; thermal cycling
consisted of one initial cycle of denaturation at 94°C for
2 min, followed by 34 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for
30 sec, annealing at 58°C for 1 min and extension at 72°C
for 2 min with a final extension at 72°C for 8 min. The
PCR fragments were screened on a 1% agarose gel, purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and
both strands directly cycle-sequenced by the dideoxychain-termination method. Primers used for sequencing

were the same as for PCR. Sequencing reactions were performed through the (French) national sequencing platform Genoscope, otherwise with an Applied Biosystems
ABI PRISM BigDye terminator ready reaction cycle
sequencing kit v3.0 following the manufacturer's instructions. Analyses were done on an ABI Prism 310 automated sequencer and edited sequences were deposited in
the GeneBank database under the accession numbers
EU250385-EU250471.
Sequences were edited in the SEQMAN II program, version 5.05 of the DNASTAR software package. In the case
of the cyt b gene, they were aligned manually with published sequences of Trematomus whereas S7 sequences
were aligned to each other using CLUSTALX software.
Evaluation of intralocus recombination and the
determination of gametic phases
an important assumption in the subsequent analyses is
that all sites within studied loci share the same genealogical history, because recombination as a macromutation
event may artificially introduce long branches into the
genealogy [36]. To assess the prevalence of historical
recombination within intron sequences we applied the
"four-gamete test" [37]. Although this test evaluates only
minimum number of intralocus recombination events, it
is sensitive to the presence of recombination, which was
our aim. We first used only S7 sequences from
homozygous individuals to circumvent the potential misidentifications of gametic phases. Then, for any species
dataset where the test suggested intralocus recombination, we discarded the sites left or right of the putative
recombination events in order to retain the longest possible contiguous unrecombined sequence for subsequent
analyses. We subsequently used the Bayesian statistical
method implemented in the PHASE software [38] to
reconstruct the gametic phases of heterozygous individuals. After treatment of intralocus recombination events, all
the phase assessments had posterior probabilities greater
than 95%.
Phylogenetic analyses, molecular clocks and genetic
diversity
For both loci, the minimum spanning networks among
haplotypes within species-specific datasets were reconstructed by the Maximum Parsimony criterion using the
algorithm of statistical parsimony [39] implemented in
the TCS program, version 1.06, [40]. This approach evaluates the maximum number of nucleotide differences
among haplotypes for which the assumptions of Maximum Parsimony are not violated, i.e. infers the probability that observed character changes defining the
connections of haplotypes are due to no more than single
mutations.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/220

To compare the substitution rates between both loci and
calibrate the molecular clocks, we tested for the rate constancy as the first step. Because both this analysis and
molecular clock calibration should not be influenced by
the recombination, we used the whole sequence of S7
intron. Using the hierarchical likelihood ratio test implemented in the MODELTEST program, version 3.06 [41],
we chose the HKY 85 model of DNA substitution [42]
with the gamma shape equal to 1.0126 and proportion of
invariable sites = 0.4574 as suitable for the cytochrome b
gene. For the S7 intron, the HKY 85 model with gamma
shape parameter equal to 0.7804 was selected. We chose
sequences of Lycodes toyamensis and Eleginops maclovinus as
outgroups for the cyt b and S7 loci, respectively, and performed the relative rate tests implemented in HYPHY software [43] with the sequence substitution models
described above. We then tested for the significance of differences in distances between the outgroup and every
sampled haplotype on the one hand, and those between
the outgroup and the haplotypes detected in a single C.
hamatus specimen on the other.
Molecular clocks were calibrated by setting the divergence
between Channichthyidae and Trematominae to 24 ± 0.5
Mya [[26]; most recent common ancestor of AFGP-bearing Antarctic notothenioids], and assessed the divergence
rate by calculating the mean pairwise nucleotide divergence between haplotypes detected in the focal species
and those from C. hamatus with the PAUP* software package, version 4.0b10 [44]. Because of rather low intraspecific variability in the cyt b gene, we used complete
datasets demographic analyses (see below) and therefore
estimated an average rate for the whole sequence for comparisons with the S7 locus. However, since most of the
observed intraspecific variability was in third positions,
which presumably mutate more rapidly, we also estimated their substitution rate to date the expansion events
more accurately. To avoid the problem of mutation saturation, we first estimated the divergence rate at 1st and 2nd
positions using C. hamatus as above and an appropriate
model estimated by the MODELTEST. Subsequently, we
estimated mean divergence within dataset composed of
sequences from the four closely related focal species and
compared it to estimated divergence at 3rd positions to get
an idea about relative mutation rate in both datasets.
The haplotype diversity (h) and mean nucleotide divergence (π) were estimated by ARLEQUIN software, v. 2.0
[45]. Contingency table and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
tests were used for significant differences among species
reflecting different habitat preferences in both measures,
respectively.

Neutrality tests
since the inferences of historical demography may be seriously compromised by selective pressure on the study
loci, we first performed the HKA test [46], which compares among loci the observed amounts of segregating
polymorphisms within species to the number of differences between the species. It allows determining whether
the amount of intraspecific polymorphism in any particular locus is significantly higher or lower than expected. In
neutral case, the amount of polymorphisms and divergence are correlated in all loci. Since the test statistic is not
expected to follow the χ2 distribution in closely related
species [47], we compared it to the distribution generated
from 1000 coalescent simulations using the software
HKA. We applied HKA tests to all four species using T.
scotii, which is a basal species in the Trematominae radiation [48] as an outgroup. The McDonald-Kreitman test
[49] was further used to assess whether the cyt b variability conforms to expectations under neutrality. Fisher's
exact test implemented in the DnaSP software [50] was
used to test whether the ratio of silent to replacement polymorphisms is the same as the ratio of silent to replacement fixed differences. Again, T. scotii was used as an
outgroup.
Inferences of past population size changes
Several approaches were employed to detect the traces of
historical demographic changes in studied species:

The Tajima's test of neutrality [51] evaluates the significance of the amount of recent mutations. Significant
excess of such mutations (negative Tajima's D values) may
suggest selective sweep or population expansion events,
while significant lack of recent mutations (positive values) could be attributed to balancing selection, population structure or decline.
Similarly, the method of Wakeley and Hey [52] implemented in SITES software [53] takes into account the distribution of polymorphisms in population and was used
to fit the data to a model of sudden population expansion,
which is characterised by parameters θancestral, θfinal and τ
(the time in generations scaled in mutation units since the
size change took place). Using the substitution rate per
locus per year (μ), the absolute time in years since the
expansion (t) may be obtained as: t = τ/2μ.
From the tests considering the information from haplotype frequencies and number, we used Fu's Fs test [54],
which is expected to take negative values in expanded
populations and is considered as one of the strongest in
detecting traces of simulated logistic [54] as well as stepwise expansion models [17].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/220

The mismatch distribution (MD) [55] takes into account
the distribution of the number of pairwise mutation differences between sequences, which is expected to be irregular in shape in constant-size neutral model, while it is
supposed to be unimodal in recently expanded populations. This test assumes a stepwise population growth
model characterised by three parameters, i.e. θinitial, θfinal
and τ (the time elapsed since the size change took place;
absolute time t = τ/2μ) [56]. The validity of this model
was assessed by the parametric bootstrap approach using
the sum of the squares of the deviations between observed
and expected mismatch distributions as a statistic as
implemented in ARLEQUIN. According to original
method [56], the time of the putative population expansion (τ) was calculated from the mean and variance of the
MD using the DNAsp. Since this method may lead to
underestimates in case of rate heterogeneities, we also
used the general non-linear least-squares approach [57] as
implemented in ARLEQUIN, which also assesses the 95%
confidence intervals around the estimated value of τ.
Low variability in mtDNA data of the benthic species
resulted in frustratingly large C.I. of τ (see the Results section). We therefore applied the method of Saillard et al.
[58] to estimate the time to the most recent common
ancestor (MRCA) of T. bernacchii and T. pennelli
sequences. This may be considered as an upper limit for
the expansion date, since the onset of population expansion inferred from observed genealogies might hardly be
older than genealogies themselves. We inferred the average distance of all individuals from the ancestral haplotype in the number of mutation steps (ρ = {n1l1 +...+
nkl1}/n, where n is the number of specimens and l is the
length of the kth branch expressed in mutation steps), and
the variance of the estimate σH2 = {n12l1 +...+ nk2l1}/n2.
This estimates divided by per locus mutation rate give the
absolute age of the genealogy and corresponding standard
errors.
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach taking
into account phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes as implemented in FLUCTUATE v. 1.4 [18], was further used to assess the goodness of fit of the exponential
growth model characterised by equation (θt = θinitial-gt) to
our data and to compute Maximum Likelihood (ML)
based estimators of exponential growth rate (g). We set
the transition/transversion ratio to 10 and starting value
of θ was calculated as the Watterson [59] estimator of this
parameter. When consistent estimates were obtained
among runs with different number of steps in chains and
initial values of g [60], we performed the final estimates
running the program with five short chains of 15, 000
steps and two long chains of 400, 000 steps with a sampling increment of 20. Significances of g were assessed
from the confidence intervals provided by FLUCTUATE

[60]. Because of upward bias of g [18], we also adopted
the conservative approach [61], where only values greater
than three standard deviations of g are considered significant. We further combined both loci to perform the
joined ML search for both parameters using LAMARC software, v. 2.0.2, since addition of unlinked loci is the most
powerful way to reduce the bias of g. For the latter analysis, we assigned the effective population size for mtDNA
as four times less than for the S7 intron and the mutation
rate was set four times greater for the cyt b gene. We ran
several analyses with varying random seeds and checked
for consistency of results.
In addition to the above tests, we applied the approach of
Galtier et al. implemented in the software SWEEP-BOTTLENECK [19] to detect significant traces of diversity
reducing events, resulting from demographic (bottlenecks) or selective (sweeps) causes. Since the software
assumes an equal effective population size for all loci, we
couldn't run combined analysis to disentangle between
both scenarios and only searched for significant deviations from a no-founder model (i.e. neutral model with a
population of constant size) in individual loci. Since the
test is applicable only to data where no more than two
states are observed at any position and where both
sequence and nucleotide sites give identical phylogenetic
information (the suitability of the dataset is recognised by
the software), we could not use it for T. newnesi and P.
borchgrevinki mtDNA and P. borchgrevinki S7 datasets.
Geographical structure may affect the estimates of all the
above tests, so we used Analysis of Molecular Variance
(AMOVA) [62] implemented in ARLEQUIN to test for it.
Since ARLEQUIN does not allow the correction of genetic
distances according our best-fitting model of DNA substitution, we used the Kimura [63] method. We estimated
the level of genetic structuration within populations,
between populations within a region and between
regions. We defined the regions according to traditional
biogeographic separation of Antarctic Peninsula and con-

tinental Antarctica. Thus, all populations from the vicinity
of the Ross Sea were grouped together and compared
against samples taken from the vicinity of the Peninsula.
We further measured the ΦST [62] over all populations,
which is analogous to Wright' FST, but takes into account
the divergence between haplotypes. We chose only T. bernacchi and T. newnesi for these analyses, since in the other
two species we either managed to sample only two localities, or we obtained highly unbalanced sample numbers
among populations and they both were concentrated
within relatively small region. In nuclear datasets of all
species we tested for significant departures from HardyWeinberg equilibria (HWE) using test implemented in the
HWE package developed by J. Brusztowski, which uses the
Markov Chain algorithm of Guo & Thompson [64] to correct for bias inherent in small sample sizes.

Results
The summary of mtDNA and S7 data is given in the Table
2. As expected for a coding region, we observed no indels
or stop codons in the cyt b dataset. We observed 1, 0, 1
and 2 recombination events in the T. bernacchi, T. pennelli,
P. borchgrevinki and T. newnesi data respectively. We
observed higher genetic diversity as well as nucleotide
diversity in pelagic species relative to both benthic species
for both markers. The differences between benthic and
pelagic species in both measures were highly significant (P
~ 10-16). Concordantly, haplotype networks of the benthic
species were rather simple consisting of one frequent haplotype surrounded by several rare haplotypes, compared
to more complex cladograms and higher average distance
among haplotypes in pelagic species (Figure 2).
Calibration of molecular clocks and relative mutation
rates
Relative rate tests did not result in rejection of rate constancy in any comparison performed. The average pairwise divergence between Chionodraco hamatus and
haplotypes sampled in the four Trematominae species
was 0.232 (0.225 – 0.253) for the cyt b gene and 0.071

0.15; P. borchgrevinki, χ2 = 0.0002, P = 0.98700). A
McDonald-Kreitman test also revealed no signatures of
selective pressure on the cyt b gene in any of the species
(T. bernacchi P = 1.0, T. pennelli P = 1.0, P. borchgrevinki P
= 0.445, T. newnesi P = 0.43).
Population structure
We observed no significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in either species (P-values were: T. bernacchi 0.9, T. pennelli 0.33, P. borchgrevinki 0.31, T. newnesi
0.99). At the nuclear locus, fixation indices (ΦST) over all
populations were insignificant (-0.0013 for T. bernacchi (P

= 0.35) and 0.018 for T. newnesi (P = 0.15)) and AMOVA
suggested that the within-population variance accounted
for 100% and 98.2% of total molecular variance in each
species respectively. At the cyt b locus, T. newnesi still
showed no significant and negative ΦST values over all
populations (-0.021 (P = 0.8)) and AMOVA suggested
that all the molecular variance is explained by withinpopulation variances. The results for T. bernacchii were different however, suggesting that the South Shetlands and
Ross Sea populations are divergent. We observed large
and highly significant ΦST over all populations (0.69916
(P << 0.05)). AMOVA suggested the differentiation
between the South Shetland and Ross Sea populations
accounted for 69.48% of total variance, while only
30.08% could be attributed to within-population variability, and less than 0.5% could be attributed to variation
among populations within the Ross Sea region.
Inferences of past population size changes
The results from the six tests are summarized in Table 3.
Since we observed significant population structure in T.
bernacchii, which may suggest separate refugia for populations from the South Shetlands and the vicinity of the
Ross Sea (see below), we performed all analyses on a
whole dataset of this species as well as separately on populations from the Ross Sea with a high overall sample size.

Except for nuclear data from T. newnesi all Tajima's D and
Fu's Fs coefficients were negative, which may be suggestive
of population growth, although we observed significant
deviation from the neutral model only in mtDNA. Similarly, Wakeley and Hey's [52] method indicated population growth in all datasets, except for T. newnesi S7,
although the expected patterns under sudden population
expansion were closely met only in the cyt b sequences
from both benthic species. In remaining datasets we
observed a poor fit with the expected values.
Mismatch distributions significantly deviated from
expected distributions under the Rogers [56] model of
sudden population expansion only in T. bernacchii and T.
newnesi S7 sequences and are shown in (Figure 3). Both T.
newnesi datasets had highest divergences of all species and
a clearly multimodal curve, which is rather typical for
populations of stable size [55].
The ML values of growth parameter g estimated separately
for both loci using FLUCTUATE indicated significantly
positive population growth in all cases except for T. newnesi S7 dataset, where the zero value couldn't be excluded
from the estimated interval and standard deviation. Combined analyses of both loci resulted in significantly positive population growth in all species.
The Galtier et al. [19] test based on cyt b data suggested
that both benthic species underwent a strong diversity
reducing event, such as a bottleneck, occurring recently in
T. bernacchi (in fact, the result suggested its occurrence 0
generations ago). Unfortunately, the low variability of T.
pennelli cyt b prevented clear timing of the bottleneck,
since after fixing the analysis for various values of the time
parameter, we obtained very similar likelihood scores.
This test further detected significant support for a recent
(0.0001 × 2Ne) strong bottleneck in both T. bernacchi and
T. pennelli S7 datasets.
Timing of the major demographic events
In addition to the above evidence of recent bottlenecks in
benthic species, which nonetheless do not allow the comparison between both groups of species, the estimators of
the parameter τ derived from MD [56] and the Wakeley
and Hey's [52] method suggest much more recent expansion event in both benthic species than in the pelagic species at the cyt b (see Table 4). However, the C.I. of
Schneider and Excoffier's [57] estimator of T. bernacchi
expansion overlapped with that of P. borchgrevinki
(although its mean value was about half that of the latter
species). More importantly, when applied to T. pennelli
and the Ross Sea population of T. bernacchi, Schneider and
Excoffier estimator resulted in uninformative values with
large C.I. In both cases, the Saillard et al [58] estimators of
the times to MRCA stand in favour of more recent expan-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/220

sions of benthic species as the age of the T. penelli genealogy is estimated to 26.5 ± 1.6 kya and the T. bernacchi Ross
Sea population to 61 ± 6 kya (the coalescence of the whole
T. bernacchi's genealogy was estimated to 166 ± 37 kya).
These estimates changed to 22.5 ± 1.4 and 52 ± 5 when
only 3rd positions were considered.
The age of population expansions suggested by the
nuclear marker were considerably older in all species.
Although generally indicating more recent expansions in
benthic species, disagreement among applied methods
and ranges of C.I. (see Table 4), including the Saillard et
al.'s estimates (data not shown), prevented any clear-cut
conclusion. It should be stressed that for T. bernacchi and
T. newnesi data, we could only use the estimates from
SITES, which provides no confidence intervals, as their
MD significantly differed from expectations of sudden
expansion model assumed by this method.

Discussion
Comparison among markers and demographic
interpretations
The extreme difficulties of sampling in Antarctica resulting in relatively low sample sizes and coverage, prevent
any detailed conclusions about Trematominae population structure. Some aspects deserve discussion, however,
especially due to the potential effect on demographic
inferences. Whereas analysis of the S7 locus detected no
deviations from panmixia in both species, analysis of
mtDNA suggested a distinctive South Shetland population of T. bernacchi, which was previously postulated [65].
Such discrepancies between nuclear and cytoplasmic
markers have been more or less frequently encountered in
other studies, and may result from a number of mechanisms. Whereas some studies clearly stand in support of
deterministic explanations, such as selective pressures or
different evolution of sexes [66,67], other cases (including
Antarctic toothfish [68]) were explained by a simpler stochastic effect of different coalescence dynamics of mtDNA
and nuclear markers [e.g. [69-73]]. A four-fold smaller
effective population size of mtDNA relative to nuclear loci
makes it more sensitive to population oscillations [[73]
and citations therein], and suggests that genetic drift will
result in a faster population subdivision relative to a
nuclear locus.

We prefer the latter explanation given the lack of evidence
of sex-specific dispersal in Trematominae and no apparent
signs of either direct or background selection on polymorphism in either locus. Trematomus bernacchi, in common
with other benthic fish [74] shows a pronounced population structure on a continent-wide scale. Grounded ice
sheets did not cover the whole shelf in the Ross Sea during
LGM [75,76], which is therefore considered as a potential
refugium for benthic biota in particular [77]. Together

with a decrease of oceanic current activities during glacial
periods [78] reducing passive larval dispersal [79,80], our
data are concordant with fragmentation into separate refugia with subsequent independent population expansions. Our sampling is far from complete and the
following interpretations are only very approximate. The
observed patterns and assumption of geographic homogeneity inherent with the demographic inference tools, at
least justify the analysis of the Ross Sea population as a
separate entity. The South Shetlands population was not

analysed separately due to the low sample size from this
location.
Despite generally concordant signals of population
expansion from both loci, demographic analyses indicated another potential conflict between mtDNA and
nuclear markers: 1) We couldn't significantly reject the
constant-size model in traditional methods of Tajima's D
and Fu's Fs in the S7 datasets despite negative values, 2)
estimates of g were lower in nuclear genes and 3) inferred
expansion dates were much more ancient in S7. Locus-

specific selective sweeps may explain such discrepancies
[[81] and citations therein], but our results make such an
explanation unlikely. Whereas Tajima's D and Fu's Fs are
sensitive to demographic oscillations, we detected no
signs of selection in the McDonald-Kreitman or HKA tests,
which are not expected to be affected by population size
changes. Furthermore, these traditional measures seem
more conservative than ML methods, which also use phylogenetic information [19,61]. Our interpretation of concordant expansion signals is further strengthened by the
similar results of Galtier et al. test for both datasets of benthic species. In addition, significantly positive population
growth estimated independently from both loci was supported by the results of a combined analysis, which is
known to effectively reduce the upward bias in estimates
of g [18].
In our opinion, contrasting signals from cyt b and S7
markers with respect to expansion rates, times and the significance of MD, Tajima's D and Fu's Fs, are better
explained by the different properties of each marker and
population histories that were not identical to the simple
models assumed by demographic methods. Given that g
is scaled by the locus-specific mutation rate [18], lower
rates in S7 likely come from an approximately four-fold
difference in mutation rate of both markers (M. Kuhner
and L. Smith, pers. comm.). It also suggests that a fasterevolving locus like cyt b is likely to incorporate traces of
more recent demographic events [82]. Furthermore,
demographic histories of the studied species were probably more complex than simple exponential or stepwise
expansion due to repeated climatic cycles during the Pleis-

tocene. Rogers and Harpending [55] and Rogers [56]
showed that in cases of complex population histories, the
parameter τ correlates with the initial expansion, which
would obscure the effects of later events (including bottlenecks) for some time. Nuclear markers with longer coalescent times relative to mtDNA are expected to accumulate
the information of demographic history over longer periods and indicate older events. It is also possible that, compared to the cyt b, temporal changes in population growth
rate attenuated "more ancient" signals of population
expansion in S7 to a greater extent.
Clear discordance between cyt b and S7 was nonetheless
observed in the T. newnesi data, where positive values of
Tajima's D and Fu's Fs (significant Tajima's D) may suggest
population subdivision (albeit not detected in AMOVA,
Φst and HW analyses) or balancing selection in S7 (but see
the discussion above). We also reanalysed T. newnesi data
with exclusion of the South Shetland population to avoid
the effect of any undetected population structure, but
obtained almost identical results (data not shown). Alternatively, positive values may also indicate a drop in population size, which is further supported by the method of
Wakeley and Hey and insignificance of g estimates.
Although combined analysis of both loci suggested positive growth in this species, it was the lowest among all species and our data probably do not allow us to make strong
conclusions about the demographic history in this case.
When looking at the time-scale of faster-evolving mtDNA,
which also allows the comparison with other published
studies, the expansion events in pelagic species seem more

Page 11 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:220

ancient compared to benthic ones (the expansion of T.
newnesi – if any – has the oldest date) although confidence
intervals were quite large and partly overlapping especially between the P. borchgrevinki and T. bernacchi complete dataset. Unresolved estimates of τ for T. pennelli and
the T. bernacchi Ross Sea population based on Schneider
and Excoffier's [57] method (compare with lower τ values
estimated from whole T. bernacchi data where the MD was
skewed more to the right) may suggest that there were too
few informative sites in our data for this method to provide reliable estimates. In any case, we have shown that
lower C.I. for expansion event in P. borchgrevinki is older
than the age of whole genealogy of the Ross Sea population of T. bernacchi (the age of T. pennelli is even younger).
Since all inferences of demographic histories were based
in one or the other way on mutation spectre in observed
data, it is not possible, in our opinion, to detect expansion
times older than the data themselves, supporting a more
recent expansion of benthic species.
In summary, while the demographic history of T. newnesi
remains somewhat obscure, the data from remaining
three species strongly indicate that they underwent significant population growth events during the Pleistocene.
Given the results of Galtier et al. test, the proposed population expansions may be linked to recovery from recent
strong bottlenecks at least in case both benthic feeders
(this method does not indicate the beginning of the event
however, as the same bottleneck effect may come from
short and strong population reduction or a long but weak
one). Given the time estimates from both loci, we assume
that populations of these species were fluctuating during
much of the Pleistocene. The more recent expansion times
of benthic feeders assessed by means of mtDNA may suggest different reactions of each group to historical climatic
events.
Using the comparative approach [61], there is no apparent distinction between benthic and pelagic species with
respect to the expansion rate, since ML values of g were
overlapping between both groups. Thus, we may not confirm the hypothesis that population oscillations were
more dramatic in benthic species. Our data suggest that
the benthic T. bernacchi stands at one extreme of the
expansion rate estimates, whereas the pelagic T. newnesi
stands at the other.
Comparisons to other Southern Ocean organisms
Increasing numbers of studies of Northern Hemisphere
marine fish suggest their populations have generally
undergone important population size oscillations, which
are interpreted in relation to Pleistocene changes of currents, sea-level or temperature [e.g. [83-89]]. Some species-specific ecological characteristics may nonetheless
buffer the impact of climatic fluctuations on populations

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/220

of marine organisms, while others, such as restriction to
habitats prone to dessication or greater specialisation in
diet and habitat preferences, make them more vulnerable
to such changes [e.g. [90-93]].
In constrast, the scarcity of population genetic and phylogeographic studies on Southern Ocean marine organisms
limits our understanding of Southern populations. Our
finding of more recent expansion dates in benthic Trematomus suggest that habitat preference may have modified
the impact of Pleistocene climatic shifts in agreement with
the glacial-mediated habitat eradication hypothesis. However, absolute dating of demographic events and their
relation to particular climatic events may be compromised by errors associated with molecular clock calibration and should be considered as approximate. On the
other hand, such estimates may provide useful comparisons among species. Provided our calibration is correct,
our data seem to provide a surprisingly good match of T.
pennelli expansion to the onset of the last deglaciation,
beginning about 25 kya but possibly as early as 30 kya in
some parts of Antarctica [94]. The T. bernacchi expansion
also probably happened during the last major glacial
period (or during the last ~50 kya when considering the
3rd cyt b position dataset). The best estimates from our
data suggest that major population expansions of both
pelagic Trematominae species by far predated the
Holocene, and even the last interglacial, although, strictly
speaking, the expansion of P. borchgrevinki might have
occurred as recently as 70 kya according to 95% C.I..
A similar picture is suggested by data published so far,
since other pelagic organisms, namely the krill Euphausia
superba [22] and the silver fish Pleuragramma antarcticum
[16], have most likely experienced populations expansions and/or bottlenecks by far predating the Holocene,
dated to between 205 – 304 kya according to alternative
molecular clocks and around 120 kya (48 – 142 kya
according to 95% C.I.) in each species respectively. In
their study of three benthic icefish (Chionodraco), Patarnello et al. [74] found high haplotype diversities, low
divergences and negative values of Tajimas' D otherwise
supportive for population bottlenecks. However, the
insignificant values found in this study prevented the
authors from reaching conclusions about the demographic history of these icefish. Reanalysing these data, we
found in all three species smooth unimodal mismatch
distributions and significantly negative values of Fu's Fs in
C. hamatus. In the remaining species, both Tajima's D and
Fu's Fs were significant at 10% level. We also found significantly positive values of g on the order of 102 in all three
species (data available upon request). Using the same substitution rate as in [16], the population expansions in two
of the three benthic species seem more recent compared
to previously published data on pelagic feeders – most

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/220

likely values suggested their onset approximately at 90, 47
and 25 kya in C. hamatus, C. myersi and C. rastrospinosus,
respectively (95% C.I. suggested upper dates at 180, 95
and 90 kya, respectively).

species such as Chionodraco spawn on rocks, consume
large amounts of Euphausiids and pelagic fish, prefer
greater depths and therefore might not necessarily be so
vulnerable to glacial expansions.

To compare these data with our results we have to synchronise molecular clocks among the above studies
[16,74] and this paper. This is because we calibrated the
clocks by the separation of Channichthyidae and Nototheniidae dated to 24 Mya according to the fossil-calibrated molecular clock [26], while Zane et al. [16] used as
calibration the split between Eleginops maclovinus and the
rest of Notothenioidei dated approximately to the same
time (22–25 Mya) because supposedly corresponding to
the formation of the APF (surprisingly, that divergence
was set to about 40 Mya using the fossil calibration [26]).
On the one hand, the calibration in Zane et al. [16] refers
to previous reports [5,95] using a calibration point of
"perciform radiation" at 60 Mya, which is highly tentative,
since we actually don't know what a perciform is [96].
This consequently led to a correspondence between the
formation of the APF and the separation of Eleginops from
the rest of the notothenioids. In our opinion, this event
rather correlates with the diversification of AFGP-bearing
notothenioids (i.e. the divergence time between Pleuragramma and Chionodraco), which corresponds to the data
on Notothenioidei [26,97]. On the other hand, Near [26]
based the calibration of his molecular clock on a single
point with a fossil record and there have been doubts that
this fossil really was a notothenioid. Both calibrations
therefore suffer from some uncertainties.

Conclusion

Applying either one or the other calibration point to all
fish datasets, we generally observed more recent expansion events in the benthic species relative to the pelagic
organisms, except for C. hamatus. This indicates that habitat preferences affect the response to climatic shifts. Using
the calibration date as in Zane et al. [16] (resulting in 1.6
to 1.8 times faster mutation rates compared to our calibration), the data would further suggest that population
expansions of both benthic Trematomus correlate with the
last glacial retreat.

Our study represents the first multilocus attempt to link
demographic events of several Antarctic marine species to
their life history and climatic events. Although we
observed discordant between-locus signals in relation to
the time and rate of demographic events, our study suggest that most or all of the analysed species underwent
population fluctuations during the Pleistocene. Based on
mtDNA variability of the species studied in this work, it
seems very likely that benthic species underwent a dramatic population bottleneck associated with the last glacial advance. If we trust our application of molecular
clocks, it seems that at least T. pennelli started to recover as
recently as in the Holocene. In contrast, pelagic populations either expanded much prior to LGM or remained
stable in size. Taking into account previously published
data, we still observed generally more recent population
bottlenecks/expansions in benthic species relative to
pelagic, but the onset of major demographic events seems
asynchronous in both groups. We propose that the glacial-mediated habitat eradication hypothesis (see above)
is a plausible explanation of genetic patterns observed in
studied species, but requires further testing by comparing
demographic histories of more species across taxonomic
groups. This would also help to assess the ecological traits
that best explain among-species differences. Such a study
needs a better and more consistent calibration of molecular clocks. This is not an easy task for Southern Ocean
biota given the chronic lack of fossils or other external calibration points.

Authors' contributions
On the other hand, the non-concordant signals in the rate
and onset of population expansions within both groups
of species complicate a clear-cut general conclusion. In
addition to problems in using molecular clock estimates
to compare the results for organisms as unrelated as fish
and krill, it is possible that the sensitivity of species to glacial oscillations is determined by more complex traits
than simple distinction between benthic and pelagic lifestyles. For example, some benthic species, like T. bernacchi, prefer shallow waters, feed mostly on benthic prey
and use large sponges as spawning grounds, and thus
require undisturbed habitats [33], while other benthic
