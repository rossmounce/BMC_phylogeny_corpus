Background
HTLV-1 is endemic in Brazil (0.07-15.9%) and HIV/
HTLV-1-coinfection has been detected, mostly in the
North and Northeast regions. This study characterized
HTLV-1 isolates from HIV-coinfected patients from
Southern and Southeastern Brazil.
Material and methods
DNA from 17 HIV/HTLV-1-co-infected patients; 5 from
the South and 12 from Southeast were amplified by
nested-PCR (env and LTR) and sequenced. HTLV subtyping was performed by NCBI-Genotyping and REGASubtyping tools websites and by phylogenetic methods
using Paup4 and MEGA4.
Results
Env sequences (705-bp) from 15 isolates and LTR
sequences (731-bp) from 17 isolates were obtained.
Molecular analysis of env and LTR sequences disclosed
respectively, nucleotide similarities of 99.5% and 98.8%
within sequences, 99% and 97.4% with ATK, and 91.6%
and 90.3% with Mel5. Four sequences that showed the
highest similarities with ATK clustered separately in the
trees (p≤0.001 for env and LTR, bootstrap=96% for
LTR); they had C386T and T594C nucleotide substitutions in LTR sequences. All except these four sequences
had mutations T5637G, T5730C, A6120G in env and
T500A, A549G, G676A, T766C, T767G in LTR
sequences. Six sequences presented the amino acid
change V1981I and clustered together in the env tree.

All isolates belonged to Cosmopolitan HTLV-1a
subtype.

Conclusions
These data show that Cosmopolitan HTLV-1a subtype
is also frequent in HIV-coinfected patients from
Southern and Southeastern Brazil, suggesting spreading
of HTLV-1 in the country. The mutations observed
should be monitored in the context of molecular
epidemiology.
