Abstract
Correction to Evans, N.M., Lindner, A., Raikova, E.V., Collins, A.G. and Cartwright, P. Phylogenetic
placement of the enigmatic parasite, Polypodium hydriforme, within the phylum Cnidaria. BMC Evol
Biol, 2008, 8:139.

Correction
Following the publication of this study [1] it was brought
to our attention that the partial 28S rDNA sequence for
Polypodium hydriforme used in some of our reported analyses was in fact a contaminant of an undetermined cnidarian species belonging to the genus Obelia. This
contaminant was an isolated case involving a small batch
of reagents and we are confident that no other sequences
published in this work [1] are suspect. The 18S rDNA
sequences were obtained in two laboratories using different reagents and different genomic DNA preparations
derived from distinct tissue samples and are similar to a
previously published 18s sequence from Polypodium.
The results of our 28S rDNA analyses (Additional file Two
and Six, [1]) and our combined 18S and 28S rDNA analyses (Figure Two, Additional files One and Seven [1])
should be disregarded. We have reanalyzed the combined
dataset including the Polypodium 18S and Obelia 28S as
separate samples. The topologies with regards to the

placement of Polypodium are consistent with those of our
18S rDNA only analyses (Figure ThreeB and Additional
file ThreeB [1]).
Although the 18S rDNA analyses alone, excluding the
long branch attractor Myxozoa, support our major conclusion that Polypodium hydriforme is a cnidarian (Figure
ThreeB and Additional file ThreeB [1]) this placement
should be viewed as tentative due to low bootstrap support (83% supporting a monophyletic Cnidaria that
includes Polypodium) (Additional file ThreeB [1]). Further
investigation of both the placement of Polypodium and the
placement of Myxozoa within Metazoa are warranted.
We regret that this error was not discovered before publication and we apologize for any inconvenience this has
caused. We gratefully acknowledge Maximiliano Maronna
and Dr. Antonio Marques who, being the first to sequence
28S rDNA from Obelia, graciously brought this matter to
our attention.
