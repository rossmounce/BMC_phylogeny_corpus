Abstract
Background: Laribacter hongkongensis is a newly discovered, facultative anaerobic, Gram-negative, motile, sea gull-shaped rod
associated with freshwater fish borne gastroenteritis and traveler's diarrhea. A highly reproducible and discriminative typing
system is essential for better understanding of the epidemiology of L. hongkongensis. In this study, a multilocus sequence typing
(MLST) system was developed for L. hongkongensis. The system was used to characterize 146 L. hongkongensis isolates, including
39 from humans and 107 from fish.
Results: Fragments (362 to 504 bp) of seven housekeeping genes were amplified and sequenced. Among the 3068 bp of the
seven loci, 332 polymorphic sites were observed. The median number of alleles at each locus was 34 [range 22 (ilvC) to 45 (thiC)].
All seven genes showed very low dn/ds ratios of < 0.04, indicating that no strong positive selective pressure is present. A total
of 97 different sequence types (STs) were assigned to the 146 isolates, with 80 STs identified only once. The overall
discriminatory power was 0.9861. eBURST grouped the isolates into 12 lineages, with six groups containing only isolates from
fish and three groups only isolates from humans. Standardized index of association (ISA) measurement showed significant linkage
disequilibrium in isolates from both humans and fish. The ISA for the isolates from humans and fish were 0.270 and 0.636,
indicating the isolates from fish were more clonal than the isolates from humans. Only one interconnected network (acnB) was
detected in the split graphs. The P-value (P = 0) of sum of the squares of condensed fragments in Sawyer's test showed evidence
of intragenic recombination in the rho, acnB and thiC loci, but the P-value (P = 1) of maximum condensed fragment in these gene
loci did not show evidence of intragenic recombination. Congruence analysis showed that all the pairwise comparisons of the 7
MLST loci were incongruent, indicating that recombination played a substantial role in the evolution of L. hongkongensis. A
website for L. hongkongensis MLST was set up and can be accessed at http://mlstdb.hku.hk:14206/MLST_index.html.
Conclusion: A highly reproducible and discriminative MLST system was developed for L. hongkongensis.

Background
Laribacter hongkongensis is a newly discovered, facultative anaerobic, Gram-negative, motile, sea gull-shaped
rod that belongs to the Neisseriaceae family of β-proteobacteria. It was first recovered from the blood and
empyema thoracis of a patient with alcoholic liver cirrhosis in Hong Kong in 2001 [1]. Since the patient's underlying disease and the presence of ascites suggested that the
gastrointestinal tract may be a possible source of infection, L. hongkongensis was intensively sought in human
fecal specimens. During a period of two months, the bacterium was recovered from the stool of three patients with
community-acquired gastroenteritis on charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar. A similar finding was observed in
three other patients in Switzerland [2]. Subsequently, in a
multi-centered prospective study using a newly developed
selective medium [3], the bacterium was shown to be
associated with community-acquired gastroenteritis and
traveler's diarrhea [4]. L. hongkongensis is likely to be globally distributed, as travel histories from patients suggested that it is present in at least four continents,
including Asia, Europe, Africa and Central America [3,4].
Recently, L. hongkongensis has also been reported from
another coastal province in mainland China [5]. In a
recent review, L. hongkongensis, together with enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis and Klebsiella oxytoca, were
included as newly appreciated agents associated with
acute diarrhea [6]. Although the causative role of L. hongkongensis in gastroenteritis is yet to be established [7],
these data provide strong evidence that the bacterium is a
potential diarrheal pathogen that warrants further investigations.
L. hongkongensis has been found in the intestines of
healthy freshwater fish but not other studied animals that
are commonly used for cooking in Hong Kong [4,8,9].
The bacterium was recovered from the guts of 24% of 360
freshwater fish studied, with the highest recovery rates
from grass carp (60%) and bighead carp (53%) and during spring and summer [6,7]. Moreover, L. hongkongensis
has also been recovered from drinking water reservoirs in
Hong Kong [10]. The presence of a heterogeneous population of L. hongkongensis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) among isolates from freshwater fish [9] and the
association of L. hongkongensis gastroenteritis with fish
consumption [4] suggested that freshwater fish is likely
the major reservoir of the bacterium and the source of
human infections.
A highly reproducible and discriminative typing system is
essential for better understanding of the epidemiology of
L. hongkongensis. Previously, we have used PFGE for typing
L. hongkongensis [4,7,8]. However, due to experimental
variations, PFGE patterns are difficult to compare among
different laboratories. As multi-locus sequence typing

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/21

(MLST) is well known to be highly reproducible and discriminative for bacteria, we developed such a typing system for L. hongkongensis using the sequence information
of the L. hongkongensis complete genome sequence
project. In this article, we report the development of an
MLST scheme for L. hongkongensis using 146 isolates from
humans and fish.

Methods
L. hongkongensis isolates
A total of 146 L. hongkongensis isolates, including 39 isolates recovered from humans and 107 isolates from fish,
were used in this study (Additional file 1). L. hongkongensis
isolate HKU1 was recovered from the blood culture and
empyema pus of a patient with bacteremic empyema thoracis [1]. The other 38 isolates from humans (isolates
HLHK2 to HLHK39) were recovered from the stool of
patients with community-acquired gastroenteritis [2,4].
Isolates HLHK 2–4 were recovered from patients in Switzerland while the rest were from patients in Hong Kong.
The 107 isolates from fish were recovered from the guts of
freshwater fish sampled from retail food markets in Hong
Kong [4,9]. These included 50 isolates (FLHK1–8,
FLHK25–26, FLHK36–43, FLHK50–59, FLHK61–71,
FLHK77–84 and FLHK94–96) recovered from grass carp
(Ctenoharyngodon idellus), 42 isolates (FLHK9–14,
FLHK27–33, FLHK44–49, FLHK72–76, FLHK85–93,
FLHK97–100 and FLHK103–107) from bighead
carp(Aristichthys nobilis), 12 isolates (FLHK15–21,
FLHK34–35, FLHK60 and FLHK101–102) from mud carp
(Cirrhina molitorella) and three isolates (FLHK22–24)
from large-mouth bass(Micropterus salmoides). The identification of all L. hongkongensis isolates were confirmed
phenotypically by standard conventional biochemical
methods and genotypically by 16S rRNA gene sequencing
[1,4].
DNA extraction
Bacterial DNA extraction was modified from our previous
published protocol [1]. Briefly, 800 μl of NaOH (0.05 M)
was added to 200 μl of bacterial cells suspended in distilled water and the mixture was incubated at 60°C for 45
min, followed by addition of 240 μl of Tris-HCl (pH 7.0),
achieving a final pH of 8.0. The resultant mixture was
diluted 100× and 0.5 μl of the diluted extract was used for
PCR.
PCR amplification and sequencing
Extracted DNA from the 146 isolates of L. hongkongensis
was used as the template for amplification of seven housekeeping genes [transcription termination facter Rho (rho);
aconitate hydratase (acnB); cell division protein (ftsH);
anthranilate synthase component I (trpE); ketol-acid
reductoisomerase (ilvC); thiamin biosynthesis protein
ThiC (thiC); enolase (eno)], using primers listed in Table

1. The seven housekeeping genes were chosen because
either the gene itself or other genes in the same metabolic
pathway has been used in MLST schemes of other bacteria.
The sequences of the seven genes were obtained from our
on-going L. hongkongensis complete genome sequence
project (unpublished data).
The PCR mixture (100 μl) contained denatured L. hongkongensis DNA, PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3 and
50 mM KCl), 2 mM MgCl2, 200 μM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphates and 2.5 U Ampli Taq Gold DNA
polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
For rho, trpE, ilvC, thiC and eno, the sample was amplified
in 40 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1.5 min and
72°C for 2 min, and with a final extension at 72°C for 10
min in an automated thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). For acnB and ftsH, the sample was
amplified using a reannealing temperature of 60°C.
Twenty microliters of each amplified product was electrophoresed in 2% (w/v) agarose gel, with a molecular size
marker (GeneRuler™ 50 bp DNA ladder, MBI Fermentas,
Canada). Electrophoresis in Tris-borate-EDTA buffer was
performed at 120 volts for 40 min. The gel was stained
with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml) for 15 min, rinsed
and photographed under ultraviolet light illumination.
The PCR product was gel-purified using the QIAquick
PCR purification kit (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany). Both
strands of the PCR product were sequenced using BigDye
Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit version 3.1 with an ABI
Prism 3700 DNA Analyzer according to manufacturers'
instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)
and the PCR primers. BioEdit version 7.0.5.2 was used for
reading the sequences and aligning the forward and backward reads [11].
Allele and sequence type assignment
The nucleotide sequences of the seven gene loci used for
MLST in all the L. hongkongensis isolates were aligned and
compared with those of isolate HLHK1 using Clustal W
multiple alignment [12] implemented in BioEdit version

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/21

7.0.5.2 [11]. An arbitrary number was assigned to each
distinct allele at a locus. The numbered alleles at each
locus were combined in order to establish the sequence
type (ST) for each isolate. Each ST was numbered in the
order of identification (ST-1, ST-2, etc.). The data have
been deposited in our Laribacter hongkongensis complete
genome sequence and MLST database http://
mlstdb.hku.hk:14206/MLST_index.html
Sequence analysis
The proportions of nucleotide alterations that led to a
change in the amino acid sequence (non-synonymous
substitution, dn) and the proportions of nucleotide alterations that did not lead to a change in the amino acid
sequence (synonymous substitution, ds) were calculated
with START2 http://pubmlst.org/software/analysis/[13].
Phylogenetic analysis was performed using ClonalFrame
algorithm with the software package ClonalFrame version
1.1, using 50,000 burn-in cycles and 100,000 further iterations [14]. Over 500 trees were generated from which a
75% majority-rule consensus tree was derived with MEGA
version 4.0 [15]. STs were grouped into lineages with
eBURST [16]. The members of an eBURST lineage were
defined as groups of two or more independent isolates
where each had identical alleles at six or more loci with at
least one other member of the group. The linkage disequilibrium between alleles at the seven gene loci was measured using the standardized index of association (ISA)
with LIAN 3.5 http://pubmlst.org/analysis/[17,18]. Split
decomposition analysis was performed using the SplitsTree program (version 4.10) [19]. Sawyer's test analysis
for intragenic recombination was performed with START2
http://pubmlst.org/software/analysis/[13]. Gene tree congruence analysis was performed using the ShimodairaHasegawa (SH) test [20] as implemented in PAUP 4.0b10
using the RELL method and 10000 bootstrap replicates
[21]. Ninety-seven STs were selected and used in the SH
test. Maximum-likelihood trees for each MLST gene of the
97 STs were inferred under a general time-reversible
model, with an estimated gamma distribution, using
PHYML v3.0 [22].

Results
Variation at the seven MLST loci
Single bands of the expected sizes were observed for each
gene locus amplified using the specific primers. Among
the 3068 bp of the seven loci, a total of 332 polymorphic
sites were observed in the 146 isolates of L. hongkongensis.
Two hundred and sixty-five and 246 polymorphic sites
were observed in the 39 isolates from humans and 107
isolates from fish respectively. No insertion, deletion or
premature termination was observed in any of the polymorphic sites. Allelic profiles were assigned to the 146 isolates of L. hongkongensis (Additional file 1). The alleles
defined for the MLST system were based on sequence
lengths of between 362 bp (ilvC) and 504 bp (acnB). The
median number of alleles at each locus was 34 [range 22
(ilvC) to 45 (thiC)].

The dn/ds ratio for the seven gene loci are shown in Table
2. All seven genes showed very low dn/ds ratios of < 0.04
(median 0.0154, range 0.0000 – 0.0355), indicating that
no strong positive selective pressure is present.
Relatedness of L. hongkongensis isolates
A total of 97 different STs were assigned to the 146 L. hongkongensis isolates, with 80 of the 97 STs identified only
once (Additional file 1). Thirty-eight different STs were
observed in the 39 isolates from humans and 62 different
STs observed in the 107 isolates from fish, with 29 STs in
50 grass carp, 30 STs in 42 bighead carps, 11 STs in the 12
mud carps and two STs in three large mouth bass. Three
STs (ST-7, ST-23 and ST-26) were found in both isolates
from humans and fish. The most common ST (ST-41) was
identified nine times, followed by ST-42 (eight isolates)
and ST-45 (seven isolates). The overall discriminatory
power for the 146 isolates was 0.9861, that for the isolates
from 39 humans was 0.9987 and for the isolates from fish
was 0.9755. ClonalFrame was used to construct a dendrogram using the concatenated nucleotide sequences of the
seven gene loci of the 146 isolates (Fig. 1).

eBURST grouped the isolates into 12 lineages, with 14 STs
in group 1, 12 STs in group 2, seven STs in group 3, three
STs in groups 4–6 and two STs in groups 7–12, whereas 43
STs did not belong to any of the 12 groups (Fig. 2 and
Additional files 1 and 2). These 43 singleton STs were isolated from 25 patients and 19 fish (one ST was found in
both). All these 12 groups were also observed as clusters
in the dendrogram (Fig. 1). Groups 2, 3, 7, 8, 11 and 12
contained only isolates from fish, group 1 contained 34
isolates from fish and two isolates from humans, group 4
contained three isolates from fish and one isolate from
human, group 9 contained one isolate from fish and two
isolates from humans, and groups 5, 6 and 10 contained
only isolates from human. ISA measurement showed significant linkage disequilibrium in both isolates from
humans and fish. The ISA for the isolates from humans
and fish were 0.270 (0.243 if the three isolates from Switzerland were removed and 0.251 if the allelic profiles of
the 38 unique STs of the isolates from humans were used)
and 0.636 (0.469 if the allelic profiles of the 59 unique
STs of the isolates from fish were used), indicating that the
isolates from fish were more clonal than the isolates from
humans. Only one interconnected network (acnB) was
detected in the split graphs (Fig. 3). The P-value (P = 0) of
sum of the squares of condensed fragments in Sawyer's
test showed evidence of intragenic recombination in the
rho, acnB and thiC loci, but the P-value (P = 1) of maximum condensed fragment in these gene loci did not show
evidence of intragenic recombination (Table 2). Congruence analysis showed that all the pairwise comparisons of
the 7 MLST loci were incongruent, indicating that recombination played a substantial role in the evolution of L.
hongkongensis. (Table 3).
No relationships were observed among the L. hongkongensis isolates with respect to their years of isolation; the
locations of the hospitals, age and sex of the patients and
the presence of plasmids in the isolates from patients [23];
nor to the species of the fish and the locations of the markets where the fish were purchased.

among the 97 STs was assessed by ClonalFrame algorithm based on the pair-wise differences in the allelic profiles of the seven
housekeeping genes. Numbers immediately to the right of the dendrogram show the eBURST clonal clusters to which the STs
belong.

BURST analysis of L. hongkongensis isolates in this study
BURST analysis of L. hongkongensis isolates in this study. Each number represents a MLST sequence type (ST) and each
line connects STs that differ in only one of the seven housekeeping genes. Boxed numbers represent STs found in both human
and fish, shaded numbers represent STs found only in human, and un-boxed and un-shaded numbers represent STs found only
in fish. Hollow circles and squares represent predicted group and subgroup founders respectively. The sizes of the circles and
squares are proportional to the number of isolates within each ST.

Discussion
A highly discriminative MLST scheme was developed for
L. hongkongensis. Seven housekeeping genes with very low
dn/ds ratios of the range of 0.0000 – 0.0355, similar to the
housekeeping genes in other MLST schemes, were
employed to produce a highly discriminative MLST
scheme, with discriminatory power of 0.9861, comparable to the MLST schemes of other pathogenic bacteria, for
molecular typing of L. hongkongensis. When the same L.
hongkongensis isolate was subcultured 50 times, no difference was observed between the sequences of the seven
gene loci in the original isolate and the one after 50 subcultures (data not shown). Therefore, these seven loci are
discriminative enough for typing, but not evolving too
rapidly to an extent that will mask genetic relatedness, as

in the case of Helicobacter pylori, another urease positive, Sshaped and motile alimentary tract microbe [24,25].
The L. hongkongensis isolates recovered from fish were
clustered. In our previous study on ecoepidemiology of L.
hongkongensis using PFGE of SpeI digested chromosomal
DNA, it was found that the isolates from fish and humans
were clustered separately [9]. Analysis of the sequences of
the seven gene loci using both dendrogram and eBURST
groups revealed a similar phenomenon to the previous
ecoepidemiology study, although the clustering pattern of
the isolates in the present study was different from that in
the previous one (data not shown). eBURST group analysis showed that six of the 12 groups consisted exclusively
of isolates from fish, whereas three of the 12 groups consisted exclusively of isolates from humans (Fig. 2). All

Split decomposition analysis of MLST data of L. hongkongensis isolates in this study. Split decomposition network
was constructed using the individual (rho, acnB, ftsH, trpE, ilvC, thiC and eno) gene sequences. The scale bar represents the
number of substitutions per site.

these 12 eBURST groups were also found in clusters in the
dendrogram (Fig. 1), although ISA measurement showed
that the isolates from fish were probably more clonal than
the isolates from humans. All these results of clustering of
isolates from fish and humans into different groups
observed in both the previous PFGE and the present MLST
studies suggested that some clones of L. hongkongensis
could be more virulent than others.

Although the isolates from fish appeared more clonal
than the isolates from humans, a heterogeneous population of L. hongkongensis existed in the same ecosystem. STs
recovered from the same species of fish or the same fish
market did not cluster together. Over 80% of freshwater
fish consumed in Hong Kong are imported from fish
farms in mainland China, whereas the remaining 20% are
locally reared in fish farms in rural areas of Hong Kong.

Since the same species of freshwater fish in a particular
market is usually obtained from the same fish farm and
multiple STs were present in L. hongkongensis isolates
recovered from the same species purchased from the same
market, it implied that multiple clones of L. hongkongensis
probably existed in the same aquaculture farm in mainland China or Hong Kong.

Conclusion
Seven housekeeping genes with very low dn/ds ratios were
employed to produce a highly discriminative MLST
scheme for molecular typing of L. hongkongensis.
