Abstract
Background: Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) to the plant mitochondrial genome has recently
been shown to occur at a surprisingly high rate; however, little evidence has been found for HGT
to the plastid genome, despite extensive sequencing. In this study, we analyzed all genes from
sequenced plastid genomes to unearth any neglected cases of HGT and to obtain a measure of the
overall extent of HGT to the plastid.
Results: Although several genes gave strongly supported conflicting trees under certain
conditions, we are confident of HGT in only a single case beyond the rubisco HGT already
reported. Most of the conflicts involved near neighbors connected by long branches (e.g. red algae
and their secondary hosts), where phylogenetic methods are prone to mislead. However, three
genes – clpP, ycf2, and rpl36 – provided strong support for taxa moving far from their organismal
position. Further taxon sampling of clpP and ycf2 resulted in rejection of HGT due to long-branch
attraction and a serious error in the published plastid genome sequence of Oenothera elata,
respectively. A single new case, a bacterial rpl36 gene transferred into the ancestor of the
cryptophyte and haptophyte plastids, appears to be a true HGT event. Interestingly, this rpl36 gene
is a distantly related paralog of the rpl36 type found in other plastids and most eubacteria.
Moreover, the transferred gene has physically replaced the native rpl36 gene, yet flanking genes and
intergenic regions show no sign of HGT. This suggests that gene replacement somehow occurred
by recombination at the very ends of rpl36, without the level and length of similarity normally
expected to support recombination.
Conclusion: The rpl36 HGT discovered in this study is of considerable interest in terms of both
molecular mechanism and phylogeny. The plastid acquisition of a bacterial rpl36 gene via HGT
provides the first strong evidence for a sister-group relationship between haptophyte and
cryptophyte plastids to the exclusion of heterokont and alveolate plastids. Moreover, the bacterial
gene has replaced the native plastid rpl36 gene by an uncertain mechanism that appears inconsistent
with existing models for the recombinational basis of gene conversion.

Background
Unlike the dynamic mitochondrial genome of flowering
plants, which frequently incorporates plastid and nuclear
sequences via intracellular gene transfer [1-3], the plastid
genome is highly resistant to the uptake of intracellular
DNA [4,5]. Recently, a large number of discoveries of HGT
involving mitochondrial genes of land plants have been
reported [6-15]. Most, if not all of these transfers seem to
be the result of a gene being transferred from the mitochondrial genome of one species to that of another. No
analogous case of plastid-to-plastid transfer has been
reported, but these mitochondrial discoveries recommend a thorough assessment of plastid HGT.
To date, only a single non-intron example of HGT to the
plastid has been found. This is the ancient transfer of the
rubisco operon (rbcL and rbcS) from a proteobacterium
into the common ancestor of red algal plastids and their
secondary derivatives [16], a case that is revisited in this
study. In contrast to transfers of constituent genes, acquisition of new introns may be relatively common in plastids [17-25], based on their disparate phylogenetic
distribution among plastid genomes, especially in green
algae, and the fact that some introns are mobile elements.
The evidence found thus far for HGT to the plastid proceeded from studies of a particular gene or intron. To
quantify the overall extent of HGT in plastid genomes, we
searched exhaustively for HGT among the 42 sequenced
plastid genomes available when this study began. Our
search relied primarily on phylogenetic analyses, but also
involved scrutiny of each potential case (including generation of new gene sequences from phylogenetically relevant taxa) to rule out artifacts and various types of
homoplasy.

involves a very short gene that nonetheless offers strong
support for a bacterium-to-plastid HGT.
HGT of rpl36
The Guillardia theta rpl36 gene is very divergent from the
rpl36 genes present in the surveyed plastid genomes and
in cyanobacteria. In trees, it branches with a paralogous
rpl36 type with strong support regardless of the phylogenetic method used (Figure 1). Here we refer to the type
found in Guillardia as rpl36-c (for cryptophyte), and the
type found in most plastids and most cyanobacteria as
rpl36-p (for plastid). The 144-bp-long Guillardia gene
shares, with all rpl36-c genes relative to rpl36-p, three
indels (insertions of one and six amino acids, and a deletion of three amino acids), as well as an overall aminoacid and nucleotide similarity (Figure 1 and Additional
File 2). Guillardia rpl36-c has a 7 amino-acid 3' extension
present in 18 gamma-proteobacterial species, in the
planctomycete Rhodopirellula baltica, and in the cyanobacterium Crocosphaera watsonii (Additional File 2). The rpl36
HGT was not detected by our initial phylogenetic filter
because our trees sampled only plastid-containing taxa,
and this gene is too short to give strongly supported
groupings within the plastids (Additional File 3). We
detected this conflict only after building trees containing
a broader sampling of rpl36 genes.

In addition to the plastids and cyanobacteria, rpl36-p is
found across many groups of bacteria, including diverse
proteobacteria, and in fungal nuclear genes targeted to the
mitochondrion. Most gamma-proteobacteria and a few
beta-proteobacteria and actinobacteria contain both
forms of the rpl36 gene (e.g. Figure 1). Crocosphaera
watsonii has an rpl36-p with a frame-shift insertion near
the 5' end, suggesting that it has been functionally
replaced by a horizontally transferred rpl36-c.

Results
Of the 204 protein genes present in four or more of the 42
examined plastid genomes, 34 produced maximum likelihood (ML) trees that had at least one node that conflicted
(see Methods) with the reference plastid tree (Additional
File 1), with bootstrap proportion (BP) ≥ 80%. Fifteen
had conflicts with BP ≥ 90%, and 11 had conflicts with BP
≥ 95%. Thirteen of the genes with BP ≥ 80% involved rhodophyte/Odontella/Guillardia
relationships,
eight
involved conflicts within the four grass taxa, and the rest
were various other conflicts. In eight trees, multiple nodes
had well-supported conflicts. Usually these pointed to a
single rearrangement in the tree, but three trees had wellsupported conflicts in different regions of the tree.
After closer analysis, in some cases requiring the generation of additional sequences for key taxa, none of these
conflicts proved to be strong cases of HGT. Ironically, one
case that was not detected by this phylogenetic filter

The rpl36 gene is located between secY and rps13 in all six
sequenced plastid genomes from red algae and their secondary photosynthetic derivatives, including Guillardia
theta (Additional File 2). This is within a larger syntenic
group of 22 genes conserved in the red algal plastids and
diverse bacterial lineages. None of the rpl36-c genes in
bacteria are adjacent to secY or rps13, nor are any located
within the larger syntenic region.
To identify the approximate time/phylogenetic boundary
of transfer and to confirm the validity of the Guillardia
gene, we sequenced rpl36 from three additional, diverse
[26] cryptophytes: Hanusia phi, Chroomonas mesostigmatica, and Cryptomonas tetrapyrenoidosa. Using PCR, we isolated only rpl36-c from all three cryptophytes (and only
rpl36-c was found in the unpublished plastid genome
sequence of the cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina

rpl36 tree and alignment
rpl36 tree and alignment. The M3 codon model in MrBayes was used to calculate the tree using the alignment shown.
Nodes with posterior probability <0.95 are collapsed. Posterior probabilities (left) and PROML BP values >50% (right) are
shown on the remaining nodes. The PROML bootstraps were run with four rate categories (estimated with PUZZLE) and global rearrangements. Nucleotide and amino-acid based ML analyses using PAUP* and MrBayes also gave 100% support for the
division between the c-type and p-type rpl36 genes. This support is maintained when all positions containing gaps are removed.
Because the 3' extension unique to some c-type rpl36 genes (see Additional File 2) was excluded from this phylogenetic analysis, it is not shown in the alignment. In the alignment, each base is colored according to the key. Taxa in red include the red
algae and their secondary plastid containing relatives. A subset of the many proteobacterial species which contain both the ptype and c-type genes is shown in purple. The p-type Pseudomonas, Photobacterium, and Vibrio genes are not shown here.
nication). These genes possess high sequence similarity
(nucleotide identity between 79% and 96%) to rpl36 of
Guillardia theta. We obtained high-quality sequence for a
region comprising all of rpl36, both of its flanking spacers,
219 bp at the 3' end of secY, and 300 bp at the 5' end of
rps13 (Figure 1 and Additional File 2).
The plastid genome of the haptophyte Emiliania huxleyi,
which was sequenced too recently [27] to be included in
this study, also contains rpl36-c in place of rpl36-p (Figure
1 and Additional File 2). Emiliania rpl36 shares the c-type

indels and 3' extension with the cryptophyte rpl36 genes
and contains no additional indels over its entire length. Its
amino-acid identities to the cryptophyte rpl36-c genes
range from 85 to 90%, and its nucleotide identities range
from 72 to 79%. It too is located between secY and rps13,
with 5' and 3' intergenic spacers of length 139 bp and 14
bp, respectively. The Emiliania sequence groups as sister to
the cryptophyte rpl36-c genes with good support (Figure

shown, but see Additional File 2).

resulting tree (Figure 2B) strongly suggests that the original result was an LBA artifact, as Oenothera goes within the
Myrtales (and within its family Onagraceae) with the better sampling.

The clpP conflict
In what follows, we describe and discuss genes that initially gave conflicting trees with relatively high bootstrap
support, but which for various reasons were either
strongly rejected or brought into question as potential
horizontal transfers.

The ycf2 conflict
The published Oenothera elata ycf2 gene branched as sister
to the asterids Atropa and Nicotiana with BP of 100%,
instead of with other rosid sequences (e.g. Arabidopsis and
Lotus). To verify this, we sequenced ycf2 from a number of
diverse Myrtales including O. elata itself. This new Oenothera sequence did not match the published O. elata plastid genome sequence [31], several regions of which (up to
1.5 kb in length) have 100% sequence identity with the
Nicotiana ycf2 gene (Figure 3A). These cover regions that
have long insertions in our O. elata sequence but that are
missing in the O. elata genome sequence. This latter
sequence also contains insertions shared with Nicotiana
but not with our O. elata ycf2 sequence. Regions in the
published sequence that do match our sequence appear to
have single base errors, given that our O. biennis sequence
is more similar to our O. elata sequence than is the published sequence in these regions (Figure 3A). Although

The clpP gene from Oenothera elata is highly divergent.
With the taxon sampling used in this study (Additional
File 1), it branches, with 84% BP (see Figure 2 legend), as
the sister to the grasses, which are also a long-branched
group (Figure 2A). Suspecting long-branch attraction
(LBA), we obtained more genes (provided by L. Goertzen
and C. Long) from the order Myrtales, to which Oenothera
belongs (including Clarkia, Fuschia, Eucalyptus, Punica,
Callistemon, and Oenothera organensis) and from other
non-grass monocots (including Acorus and Flagellaria) to
test if the grouping with the grasses was an artifact. The

this region, gappy positions were removed prior to phylogenetic analysis, which resulted in 2567 positions. When the entire

very divergent, the new O. elata sequence branches in the
expected position with other Myrtales (Figure 3B). We
strongly suspect that this conflict is due to extensive error

in the ycf2 region of the published O. elata genome [31],
perhaps due to inadvertent incorporation of Nicotiana
sequence during genome assembly (see Additional File 4).

The rhodophyte/chromalveolate conflicts
The chromalveolates [Guillardia (cryptophytes), Odontella
(heterokonts), and apicomplexans in our sampling] are a
putatively monophyletic group that, with respect to plastid phylogeny, branch within the red algae, with the Cyanidiales being sister to the Porphyra/Gracilaria/
chromalveolate clade (Additional File 1). Relationships
among the different chromalveolate groups are not well
established [32], but the consensus topology provides a
reasonable working hypothesis. Most of the conflicts that
we found relative to this topology involve Guillardia and/
or Odontella branching as sister to all the rhodophytes
instead of as sister to Porphyra/Gracilaria. Although some
of these conflicts could in principle be true cases of HGT,
the combination of long branches and near-neighbor
exchanges makes these conflicts suspect, even given high
bootstrap support. For some of these we have seen evidence (assuming our plastid tree is correct) of codonusage bias. For example, the psbB gene tree goes from
100% BP for rhodophytes being monophyletic to the
exclusion of Guillardia and Odontella, using all three
codon positions, to weak support for a topological change
to the consensus tree when only second positions are
used. First and second positions together still give strong
support for the conflicting tree, indicating that first positions may also contribute a significant bias for psbB [33].

Another well-supported conflict, psbA, is discussed in
Additional File 5. The remaining genes that had conflicts
supported by BP of 80% or higher are psbC, atpH, psaK,
dnaK, atpF, atpB, rpl31, ycf4, ycf17, ycf45, and ycf37. As
above, we could not reject the conflicts outright, but we
could show weakened support or induce topological
changes with alternative data filtering such as using second codon positions alone or amino acids. In no case did
we observe any telltale signals such as uniquely shared
indels in the conflicting clades.
The grass conflicts
Eight gene trees conflicted with the consensus tree (Additional File 1) with respect to relationships among the four
grasses examined. Four gene trees (atpI, psbH, atpF, rpl16)
supported the monophyly of Triticum/Saccharum/Zea,
while the other four (rpl22, ndhD, psaA, psbA) supported
monophyly of Oryza/Saccharum/Zea. In all cases there is a
long branch leading to the grasses, which reflects both the
lack of any close outgroups (no other monocots were
included) and the well-established rapid evolution of the
chloroplast genome in the stem group leading to grasses
(Stefanovic et al [34] and references therein). We hypothesize that all eight gene trees whose within-grass topologies conflicted with the consensus topology reflect
spurious results stemming from the lack of close outgroups to the grass sequences. To test this hypothesis, we
reanalyzed the two genes (atpI and psbH) that showed the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/31

highest level of conflict (BP = 96%), using all other monocot sequences available (from Sorghum, Hordeum, Phyllostachys, Typha, Yucca, Phalaenopsis, and Acorus) for these
two genes. With this improved sample, the atpI phylogeny
was no longer in significant conflict with the organismal
tree; instead, relationships among Triticum, Oryza, and
Saccharum/Zea were entirely unresolved under an all
nucleotide position ML model (Additional File 6). For
psbH, however, the situation did not change markedly; we
obtained a BP of 91% for Oryza being sister to Triticum/
Saccharum/Zea, but this corresponds to only three parsimony informative characters. Such a small number of
informative characters could easily be homoplasious, and
better taxon sampling is required to resolve these conflicts
firmly.
Other conflicts
The remaining conflicts with BP ≥ 80% were all brought
into question using alternative phylogenetic analyses that
led to reduction of bootstrap support or topology change.
All of these involved conflicts with branches that are near
each other in the consensus tree.
rRNA and tRNA genes
The small and large subunit ribosomal RNA genes had
strong support for the euglenids going outside the green
algae (sister to red/green algae for 16S and within the red
algae for 23S). Increasing taxon sampling using other
available rRNA genes [35] gave a weakly supported placement of the euglenids within the green algae. No clear
cases of HGT in tRNA genes were detected, but interpretation of these alignments and trees is difficult, owing to the
short length and extensive paralogy of these genes.
Scrutiny of long-branched lineages
The approach used here is limited by the taxon sampling.
Because our initial trees included only plastid genes, we
could essentially detect HGT only from one plastid
genome to another, but not transfers from other genomes
into plastids. We reasoned that transfers of non-plastid
genes should normally result in a long branch leading to
the donee taxon within the plastid gene trees. A description of our analysis of these long-branch lineages is presented in Additional File 7. No additional cases of HGT
were detected in this analysis.

Discussion
The rpl36 transfer: the chromalveolate hypothesis and
algal phylogeny
The unique, derived presence of the horizontally transferred rpl36-c gene in haptophyte and cryptophyte plastids, but not in heterokont and alveolate plastids,
provides the first strong evidence for the "sisterhood" of
haptophyte and cryptophyte plastids. The most parsimonious scenario is that the rpl36-c gene was transferred once

Page 6 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2006, 4:31

to the ancestral plastid of the haptophytes and cryptophytes after this plastid lineage and the lineage(s) leading
to heterokonts and alveolates diverged. Less parsimonious alternative scenarios can be imagined, but the similarity between the haptophyte and cryptophyte rpl36 genes,
their position as sister lineages among the rpl36-c genes
(Figure 1), and the fact that the transfer appears to have
occurred via an improbable recombination event make
alternative explanations unlikely.
The haptophytes and heterokonts have been recognized
as sister groups based on ultrastructural and pigment similarities [36,37], and named 'chromobiotes'. In addition,
phylogenies based on concatenated plastid genes tend to
group the haptophytes and heterokonts [38,39] (see Additional File 8 for further discussion of chromalveolate phylogeny). However, on a per-gene basis, the signal is mixed,
and nearly half the plastid genes actually group haptophytes and cryptophytes as sisters (Additional File 9 and
Additional File 10). The morphological characters linking
haptophytes to heterokonts could all be ancestral to the
chromophytes (chromobiotes plus cryptophytes) or even
the chromalveolates (chromophytes plus alveolates)
[32,40]) and lost differentially. For example, chlorophyll
c3 and autofluorescence of the rear cilium could have
been lost in the cryptophytes, and the nucleomorph
(present in cryptophytes) could have been lost independently in the haptophytes and heterokonts (it is well established that the nucleomorph has been independently lost
in the secondary, green-derived plastid of euglenids). In
contrast, the presence of the c-type rpl36 in only haptophytes and cryptophytes cannot be explained by differential loss unless one posits its unlikely insertion via HGT
immediately adjacent to, rather than in place of, the
ancestral p-type gene. It remains to be seen whether the
hypothesis of haptophyte/cryptophyte plastid monophyly is supported or rejected by future phylogenetic analyses involving many more plastid and nuclear genes and/
or taxa from across the chromalveolates. One possibility,
which is based on the serial symbiosis models developed
by Bachvaroff et al [38,39], is that the cryptophyte and
haptophyte plastids, but not their nuclear lineages, will
turn out to be sister groups. This would be the case if, say,
the cryptophyte plastid was of secondary, red-algal origin
and the haptophyte plastid of tertiary, cryptophyte origin.
However, a study using six nuclear cytosolic protein genes
did group haptophytes and cryptophytes with weak support [41], suggesting that their nuclear genes may also be
monophyletic.
The donor of the rpl36-c gene
rpl36-c was probably transferred to the ancestral plastid of
haptophytes and cryptophytes directly from a bacterium
rather than from the mitochondrion or nucleus, as there
is no evidence of a rpl36-c in these compartments. At the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/31

amino-acid level, plastid rpl36-c is most similar to Rhodopirellula baltica. Interestingly, the complete shotgun
sequences from two other planctomycetes (Blastopirellula
marina and Gemmata obscuriglobus) contain only rpl36-p.
Thus, a potential transfer between the Rhodopirellula lineage and the cryptophyte lineage would likely postdate the
Rhodopirellula/Blastopirellula/Gemmata divergence. However, a recent HGT from an unknown donor into Rhodopirellula is also possible. On balance, based on the current
bacterial sampling, the donor of the plastid rpl36-c was
most likely a planctomycete related to Rhodopirellula or a
proteobacterium. A cyanobacterium related to Crocosphaera watsonii is a less likely but potential donor since
the Crocosphaera branches within the gamma-proteobacterial c-type group (tree not shown; but see Additional File
2), but was probably recently acquired from this group via
HGT (see Results).
The rpl36 transfer: mechanism and functional
consequence
Because plastid rpl36-c and rpl36-p are both located
between secY and rps13 in the same orientation, we suspect that the rpl36 HGT was mediated by homologous
recombination. This would be extraordinary, because the
Guillardia and Porphyra rpl36 genes are only 49% identical
in nucleotide sequence in non-gap regions. At this level of
divergence, homologous recombination is thought to be
highly unlikely [42,43]. It is implausible that flanking
sequence could have been used to initiate gene conversion, as intergenic regions between distant taxa are essentially random, and no bacterial c-type rpl36 genes are
flanked by secY and rps13. Additionally, the 3' end of secY
and the 5' end of rps13 in Guillardia do not appear to have
been replaced by divergent sequence, as they are still
highly similar to the red algal and cyanobacterial genes
relative to Rhodopirellula and proteobacteria (Additional
File 2A). Even the last 30 bases of Guillardia secY have a
higher sequence identity to red algal and cyanobacterial
homologs than to all other known sequences. As the 3'
end of the rps13 first and second position alignment is
iteratively removed, Guillardia continues to group with
the red algae and cyanobacteria until about 40 bp are left,
at which point phylogenetic resolution is lost, owing to
relatively high sequence conservation. There is no significant sequence similarity between the Guillardia rpl36
intergenic regions and those from any available c-typecontaining bacteria. In fact, there is only modest conservation among the intergenic regions of the additional cryptophyte genomes we examined. The cryptophyte
intergenic spacers 3' to rpl36 ranged in length from 42 to
53 bp with sequence identities, in non-gap regions, of 68–
80%, while the 5' spacers ranged in length from 30 to 150
bp with sequence identities of 59–74%.

This leads to the hypothesis that recombination may have
been initiated by very short regions of conservation
between the rpl36-c and rpl36-p genes themselves. Most
reported recombination events between bacterial species
tend to be among highly similar sequences [44]. However,
this may not be entirely due to the level of sequence similarity but also to interspecies barriers, such as mismatch
repair [45]. The minimal sequence identity required to
initiate recombination varies depending on the system
and species being tested, but has been shown to involve
20 or fewer consecutive identical nucleotides for some
types of recombination [46,47].
Although the overall similarity between rpl36-c and rpl36p is very low (Figure 1), the 5' and 3' ends are more conserved than the rest of the gene. Specifically, the plastid
rpl36-c genes share an 8-bp 5' sequence (AGTAAAGT)
with all rpl36-p genes in the red algal lineage, as well as
with several green algae and land plants and with several
rpl36-p and rpl36-c bacterial genes. A less well-conserved
6-bp 3' sequence (CAAGGT) exists in cryptophyte and
some alpha-proteobacterial rpl36-c genes and in the rpl36p gene from some cyanobacteria, land plants, green algae,
and red algae. This identity extends leftwards by a further
3 bp (CGTCAAGGT) in Cryptomonas, some cyanobacteria,
and Odontella. These similarities between the plastidal
and bacterial rpl36-c and the rpl36-p genes in the red-plastid lineage are consistent with one or both ends being
involved in recombination. A gene replacement along
these lines would represent, to our knowledge, an unprecedented recombination event in terms of sequence distance. Although it is conceivable that the rpl36-c and
rpl36-p genes involved in this putative recombination
some 1 billion years ago shared more sequence similarity
than the extant genes, rpl36-c has not diverged greatly
among haptophytes and cryptophytes, and rpl36-p is
quite conserved among plastids (Figure 1).
This being the case, possible alternatives to recombination, and HGT itself, should be considered, such as convergent evolution. However, even though rpl36 is very
short, convergence is unlikely, given the sequence divergence between the p- and c-type rpl36 genes and that the
algal c-type genes emerge as a nested clade from within
the larger group of c-type genes (Figure 1). The convergence hypothesis would require a staggering and unprecedented number of convergent events. At the amino-acid
level, the Guillardia rpl36 shares 36 identities with Rhodopirellula, but only 13–18 identities with its red-algal relatives. It also shares three gaps and a 7 amino-acid 3'
extension with bacterial rpl36-c (Figure 1 and Additional
File 2). Although functional convergence does occur in
protein genes [48], nothing approaching the extent that
must be invoked for rpl36 has been shown. Protein functional convergence usually occurs at very short, key areas

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/31

of the protein; for example, within active site regions of an
enzyme.
In contrast to convergent positive selection for function,
GC content can have a dramatic effect on amino-acid and
codon usage [49]. However, plastids, including Guillardia
and Emiliania, have a low genomic GC content relative to
the bacterial genomes of the taxa shown in Figure 1. The
rpl36-c genes mirror the genomic GC content. For example, Guillardia rpl36-c is 31% GC (genome is 33%) while
Rhodopirellula rpl36-c is 54% (genome is 55%). In contrast
to convergence, these differences in GC content probably
account for much of the divergence between the plastid
and bacterial rpl36-c genes and make chance convergence
much less likely.
rpl36-c almost certainly physically replaced rpl36-p in certain algae; but did it also functionally replace it? The two
types are highly divergent from one another (Figure 1 and
Additional File 2), and to our knowledge, rpl36-c has
never been shown to play the equivalent ribosomal function in any organism. It is therefore conceivable that a
nuclear-encoded, plastid-targeted rpl36-p exists in the
cryptophytes and haptophytes, while rpl36-c serves some
other function. However, upon consideration of the crystal structure of the 50S ribosomal subunit from E. coli [50]
it is plausible that rpl36-c could functionally replace rpl36p. First, the amino acids making van der Waals and hydrogen bond contacts with the 23S ribosomal RNA are fairly
well conserved between the two rpl36 types (Additional
File 2). Second, the region where the 3 amino-acid insertion exists in the c-type makes no intermolecular contacts,
but instead protrudes into the solvent where an insertion
is unlikely to cause a functional problem. Interestingly,
this insertion creates potential N-myristoylation and Nglycosylation sites that could have functional importance.
Third, the crystal structure reveals a large empty space, in
contact with the C-terminal glycine, that could easily
accommodate the 7 amino-acid C-terminal extension in
rpl36-c. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that rpl36-c could
functionally replace rpl36-p without any major steric
interference or loss of intermolecular contacts. In addition, rpl36-c is highly conserved between the haptophyte
and cryptophytes as would be expected for a functional
ribosomal protein.
Rubisco HGT revisited
It was first recognized nearly 20 years ago [51-53] that red
algae and their secondary symbiotic derivatives possess a
rubisco operon (rbcLS) of highly unusual evolutionary
origin. Whereas all green plastids and those of glaucophytes contain rbcLS of expected cyanobacterial origin,
red plastids possess rubisco genes of apparent proteobacterial origin. Based on phylogenetic considerations, Delwiche and Palmer [16] argued in 1996 that the red algal

Page 8 of 15

BMC Biology 2006, 4:31

rubisco was acquired from proteobacteria by horizontal
transfer in the common ancestor of all red algae. In addition, they provided evidence for several other rbcLS transfers, all among eubacteria. Martin and Schnarrenberger
[53] argued that the cyanobacterial endosymbiont instead
carried both the red-like and green-like rubisco genes
from a duplication predating cyanobacteria and proteobacteria, and that differential loss in the plastid lineages
and loss in all cyanobacterial lineages resulted in the
observed pattern.
In the context of the current study, and with the passage
of some 10 years and the accumulation of hundreds of
bacterial genome sequences, we revisit this issue. Figure 4
shows an rbcL phylogeny for a representative sampling of
currently available sequences. The overall structure of this
tree is very similar to that of Figure 2 of the paper by Delwiche and Palmer [16]. Importantly, however, a number
of new proteobacterial rbcL sequences have become available that show even greater similarity to red algal rbcL
than those considered by that study [16]. For example, the
recently sequenced genome of Nitrosospira multiformis
shares 86% amino-acid identity with Gracilaria over a
contiguous 381 amino-acid region of rbcL. This is within
the range of identities among the red algae over this same
region. The rbcL tree (Figure 4) groups the red algal rbcL
genes with those of Nitrosospira and Nitrosococcus. With
the advent of these and other related bacterial sequences,
the red algal rbcL clade is now two steps nested within the
overall clade of red-like proteobacterial rbcL sequences,
whereas previously [16] it was simply sister to a more limited set of proteobacteria.
Now, with many more rubisco sequences in hand, and
with complete genomes available for many of these
organisms, the duplication/loss model strongly conflicts
with the phylogenetic and presence/absence data. None
of the 15 or more sequenced cyanobacterial genomes contains a red-like rbcL. Furthermore, out of the many bacterial rbcL sequences now available, only a single organism,
Rhodobacter azotoformans, has been found that contains
both red-like and green-like rbcL [54], and this is clearly
due to a bacterial HGT event instead of retention of both
copies from an ancient duplication. So the hypothesis of
an ancient duplication and differential loss of paralogs is
becoming increasingly untenable.
Alternatively, instead of a transfer to the recent ancestor of
the red algae, a recent ancestor of the cyanobacterial endosymbiont could have received a red-like rbcL from a proteobacterium followed by differential losses in the plastid
lineages [55]. This possibility is less parsimonious, however, as it still requires one horizontal transfer, plus at
least two independent losses in the plastid lineage and at
least one in cyanobacteria. In conclusion, it is likely that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/31

the rbcLS operon of red algae represents a genuine HGT
event to the plastid genome.
HGT in plastids: rare but choice
Comprehensive examination of all 204 genes present in
four or more of the 42 examined plastid genomes has
revealed but a single new, well-supported case of HGT.
This rpl36 transfer and the rbcLS transfer described years
ago [16] and revisited above share several features: (i) they
both involve bacterial donors; (ii) they are both relatively
ancient [56-58], having occurred in the common ancestor
of red algae (rbcLS), perhaps 1.0–1.5 billion years ago, or
in the common ancestor of cryptophytes and haptophytes
(rpl36), probably not much more recently; and (iii) in
both cases, the transferred genes are known (rbcLS; see
Delwiche and Palmer [16,51-53], Valentin and Zetche
[16,51-53], Boczar et al [16,51-53], Martin and Schnarrenberger [16,51-53], and references therein) or thought
(rpl36) to have functionally replaced native homologs,
which would explain their retention for eons as intact
genes. The rpl36 transfer also serves as an important phylogenetic marker and is intriguing from a mechanistic
standpoint. Thus, although HGT in plastids is extremely
rare, when it happens it can be of considerable consequence and interest.

Both cases of plastid horizontal gene transfer occurred
anciently in red algae or their secondary derivatives, while
several cases of potential [22] or likely [20,21] horizontal
acquisition of introns are evident in green algae plastids.
In contrast, no cases of HGT were evident in our analyses
of sequenced plastid genomes of land plants, nor has HGT
been reported for any of the many plastid genes that have
been widely sequenced (in hundreds to thousands of
plants) for phylogenetic purposes. This contrast is noteworthy because far more plastid sequencing has been performed in land plants (99671 entries from an NCBI
Entrez search for plastid genes) than in algae (6731
entries). Are algal plastids, an admittedly paraphyletic
group, somehow more amenable to HGT than plant plastids?
HGT and getting the right tree
We initially constructed many phylogenetic trees that gave
well-supported, conflicting results suggestive of HGT, but
which were ultimately deemed wrong or showed weakened support under closer scrutiny. The largest source of
conflicts arose within the red algal lineage and their secondary descendants (and to a lesser extent with the green
algae), where limited taxon sampling and early diversification of lineages led to a series of long terminal branches
connected by short internal branches. This is where phylogenetic reconstruction is most prone to fail due to LBA
[59]. Subsequent analyses with improved taxon sampling
and/or filtering of fast-evolving codon positions caused us

to reject all of these cases as potential HGTs. Some of these
conflicts might still represent actual HGT events, but further taxon sampling will be required to resolve the issue
completely. Sequencing errors should be considered a
possibility and the anomalous sequences verified where

conversion/replacement to occur. The rpl36-c HGT also
serves as a striking phylogenetic character that establishes
an important new phylogenetic connection, linking haptophyte and cryptophyte plastids as sister groups to the
exclusion of heterokont and alveolate plastids.

Methods
Why is HGT so less common in plastids than in
mitochondria in land plants?
Some 40 cases of HGT have now been reported in plant
mitochondrial genomes [6-15] versus none in plant plastids. This is despite far less sequencing of plant mitochondrial genes (7075 Genbank entries) than plastid genes
(99671 Genbank entries). Similarly, plant mitochondrial
genomes are rich in plastid and nuclear sequences
acquired via intracellular gene transfer [1-3], whereas
plastid genomes entirely lack such sequences [4,5]. What
could account for such differences? To be sure, plant mitochondrial genomes are less compact (72–89% noncoding
DNA in sequenced angiosperm genomes) and less constrained in size (varying over 10-fold in size). Nevertheless, angiosperm plastids contain considerable noncoding
DNA (generally 40–45%), suggesting that the greater propensity for mitochondrial HGT is not simply a function of
the total amount of "junk" DNA. Rather, the differences
may be how efficiently the organelles take up exogenous
DNA. Plant mitochondria possess an active DNA uptake
system [2]; no similar activity has been reported for plastids, but it is also unclear whether this has been assayed
for. This uptake system may lower a rate-limiting barrier
in the incorporation of both foreign and native DNA. A
major, well-documented difference between the two
organelles is the tendency of mitochondria to fuse. This
may account for some of the observed mitochondrion-tomitochondrion HGT. Plant mitochondria regularly fuse
[60,61], promoting recombination between parental
mitochondrial genomes in the case of somatic hybrid
plants generated by protoplast fusion, whereas chloroplasts virtually never fuse under similar conditions
[62,63].

Conclusion
This study confirms and quantifies the hypothesis that
HGT is rare in plastids. Only rpl36 and the rubisco operon
are clear cases of HGT to the plastid genome. Both are
ancient transfers, whereby bacterial genes have replaced
native homologs and have become permanent, functional
residents in their respective lineages. In contrast, the frequent (and recent) transfers in plant mitochondria occur
by plant-to-plant transfer and are essentially ephemeral
events, few of which seem to be of functional significance.
The horizontal transfer of bacterial rpl36-c into the plastid
genome represents an unprecedented example of apparent homologous recombination that defies current concepts of the sequence relatedness required to allow gene

addition, the sequence of the Pisum sativum plastid
genome was provided by John C. Gray (unpublished
data), and the Vitis vinifera coding sequences were
extracted and pieced together (unpublished result) from
all NCBI nucleotide databases including dbEST [64]. A
combination of BLAST searches with closely related
genomes, Perl scripts for parsing output, and hand editing
was used to define the protein and RNA genes in the
unannotated genomes of Pisum sativum, Vitis vinifera, and
Medicago truncatula.
Gene clustering
In total, 5676 protein, tRNA and rRNA genes were
extracted from the 42 plastid genome sequences. A BLAST
[65] database was created with these DNA sequences, and
then each sequence was used as a BLAST query against the
database. From the BLAST output, a pairwise distance
matrix was constructed based on the best BLAST expectation value for each query/hit pair. For a pair to be considered, the BLAST expectation value had to be ≤0.1, and at
least 20% of the longer sequence of a pair had to be
included in the alignment. Pairs for which these criteria

were not met received a large distance value of 1.1. A huge
neighbor-joining tree was constructed with PAUP* software, [66] using this distance matrix. Gene families and
superfamilies were easily identifiable in the resulting tree.
Unrelated gene families formed a polytomy of long
branches at the root node. From this tree, 204 protein
gene families containing four or more genes were hand
selected by visual inspection. Ribosomal RNA genes were
easily resolved in the tree, but transfer RNA genes were
clustered into many hard-to-resolve paralogous families.
The distinct tRNA clusters were separated into groups for
further clustering using maximum parsimony (MP) and
ML analyses.
Gene alignment
Protein and nucleotide alignments were made for each of
the gene families using MUSCLE software [67] with
unlimited iterations, and were inspected manually to correct errors. Initially, amino-acid alignments were constructed for sequences whose translation could be
obtained. The protein alignment was then back-translated
to nucleotides using the known nucleotide sequences.
Sequences that could not be translated (such as pseudogenes and RNA genes) were aligned based on nucleotides.
Positions containing mostly gaps, especially where
homology was deemed questionable, were excluded from
phylogenetic analyses.
Phylogenetic analyses
ML models for each gene family were determined using
the likelihood-ratio test criterion of MODELTEST [68]
except where specified. Final model parameter values
were estimated by iteratively building ML trees and recalculating parameter values until the best trees converged.
Heuristic ML searches using tree bisection-reconnection
branch swapping in PAUP* were performed to find these
trees. All three codon positions were included for the initial phylogenetic screening of gene families, but first and
second position and other character-sampling strategies
and software were used secondarily if needed to clarify the
phylogenetic support for a conflicting tree. One hundred
ML bootstrap replicates were performed using the same
model and search method as used for searches for the best
trees. Neighbor-joining and MP analyses were also carried
out to allow for comparison to the ML results. Additional
phylogenetic methods and programs (e.g. MrBayes, PAML
and PROML) are indicated where used.

of a taxon that is part of that clade were marked as in conflict. Conflicting nodes were ordered by their ML BP values, using a PERL script developed for finding these
conflicts. Trees were viewed graphically, with conflicting
clades highlighted to determine whether further processing was necessary. To rule out HGT in well-supported conflicts, we scrutinized the alignment in more detail,
increased taxon sampling, and tried other models and
phylogenetic methods.
New gene sequences
Several new sequences for rpl36 (DQ365944–
DQ365946) and ycf2 (DQ370441–DQ370447) were
obtained using standard PCR and sequencing protocols
[69]. Cryptophyte genomic DNAs (for rpl36 isolation)
were generously provided by Chris Lane and John
Archibald. Angiosperm DNAs (for ycf2 isolation) were
isolated [70] directly from young plant leaves or were
taken from lab stocks.

Authors' contributions
DWR carried out all the analyses, wrote the new software
used in this study, generated the new rpl36 and ycf2
sequence data, and drafted the manuscript (text and figures). DWR and JDP jointly directed the project, and JDP
contributed substantially to the final manuscript. Both
authors read and approved the final manuscript.

a particular gene). (A) The topology found using MrBayes with 21,659
plastid amino-acid positions shared among the chromophytes, Gracilaria,
and Porphyra. Invariant sites and gamma distributed rates were used
with the Cprev model [72]. The posterior probabilities were 1.0 for all
nodes. (B) The topology was found as in (A) except that Guillardia and
Emiliania were constrained to be monophyletic. The node corresponding
to the chromist clade had a posterior probability of 0.98 and the other
nodes had 1.0.
