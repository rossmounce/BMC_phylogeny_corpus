Abstract
Background: We have developed and fabricated a salmonid microarray containing cDNAs
representing 16,006 genes. The genes spotted on the array have been stringently selected from
Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout expressed sequence tag (EST) databases. The EST databases
presently contain over 300,000 sequences from over 175 salmonid cDNA libraries derived from a
wide variety of tissues and different developmental stages. In order to evaluate the utility of the
microarray, a number of hybridization techniques and screening methods have been developed and
tested.
Results: We have analyzed and evaluated the utility of a microarray containing 16,006 (16K)
salmonid cDNAs in a variety of potential experimental settings. We quantified the amount of
transcriptome binding that occurred in cross-species, organ complexity and intraspecific variation
hybridization studies. We also developed a methodology to rapidly identify and confirm the
contents of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library containing Atlantic salmon genomic
DNA.
Conclusion: We validate and demonstrate the usefulness of the 16K microarray over a wide
range of teleosts, even for transcriptome targets from species distantly related to salmonids. We
show the potential of the use of the microarray in a variety of experimental settings through
hybridization studies that examine the binding of targets derived from different organs and tissues.
Intraspecific variation in transcriptome expression is evaluated and discussed. Finally, BAC
hybridizations are demonstrated as a rapid and accurate means to identify gene content.

Background
Atlantic salmon are part of the Salmonidae family which
comprise all salmon, trout, whitefish, grayling, and charr.
A tremendous amount of basic biology is already known
about salmonids from studies carried out on their physiology, population dynamics, behavioural ecology and
phylogenetics [1]. Salmon also provide an excellent
model system in which to study fundamental genetic
mechanisms of growth, development, reproduction and
response to infection and disease. For example, salmonids
serve as prominent models for studies involving environmental toxicology [2], carcinogenesis [3], comparative
immunology [4], the molecular genetics and physiology
of the stress response [5], olfaction [6], vision [7],
osmoregulation [8], growth [9] and gametogenesis [10].
Answers to fundamental scientific questions can also be
gained from the study of salmonid genomes. The ancestor
of all extant salmonids underwent a whole genome duplication and after a series of subsequent genetic events,
salmon are now considered to be pseudo-tetraploid. How
a genome reorganizes itself to cope with a duplicated
genome and the importance of gene duplications for evolution and adaptation are long standing issues that
remain unresolved. Questions regarding the origins of
genomes have direct implication for our understanding of
the roles of gene families, duplication and deletion of segments of genomes, and the mutational process in human
health and disease. They also provide a foundation for
understanding the genome of Atlantic salmon to benefit
conservation and enhancement of wild stocks, aquaculture and environmental assessments. Genomic resources
enable us to address fundamental scientific questions
concerning the evolution of salmonid genomes, and the
expression of genes and proteins in a wide variety of natural and altered environments and conditions.
Toward these goals, more than 175 cDNA libraries have
been constructed from a wide variety of tissues and different developmental stages and more than 300,000 salmonid cDNA sequence reads have been combined from a
consortium comprising groups from Canada (Ben Koop
et al. and the Genomics Research on Atlantic Salmon
Project (GRASP); Susan Douglas et al. and the Institute for
Marine Biosciences, NRC); France (Yann Guiguen et al.
and INRA-SCRIBE); Norway (Bjorn Hoyheim et al. and
the Norwegian School of Veterinary Science (NSVS)) and
the U.S.A. (Caird Rexroad III and the USDA/ARS National
Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture). These
sequences were assembled into over 40,000 unique contigs. A preliminary microarray of 3,557 cDNAs was constructed and assessed on its' ability to provide new data in
the study of cellular and tissue responses to pollutants,
diseases and stress, as well as for reproduction and development [11-15]. On the basis of these results, a larger

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/126

array of 16,006 genes has been constructed and initial
results have shown sensitivity of gene expression patterns
to disease challenge, and to small environmental and
physiological changes [16].

Results and discussion
Library construction (directional cloning by 5'EcoRI,
3'XhoI in pBluescript II XR, Stratagene; or TOPO TA cloning of suppression subtractive hybridization PCR products, Invitrogen and Clontech) and subsequent EST
sequencing (using M13 forward primer) were designed to
generate 3'-end sequences to enable us to distinguish
between potential paralogs arising from the recent salmonid genome duplication. We have determined from a
weighted average measurement comparing four different
directionally-cloned library types (such as non-normalized versus normalized libraries) that approximately 9%
of inserts are in the reverse orientation and therefore yield
5' sequence with the M13 forward primer [11]. The
GRASP 3'-end reads were used as a framework on which
to build the contigs from additional data provided by the
NRC, INRA, USDA/ARS and the NSVS. Part of the evaluation process for selecting genes for the microarray
required criteria that would guard against chimeras. Simply put, this meant that each gene choice had to be part of
a contig with multiple distinct clones covering each
region, or that it was sufficiently similar to another
sequence across its whole length that it was unlikely to be
chimeric. We did select for immune-specific and reproduction-relevant genes for the microarray, but the preponderance of ESTs on the 16K chip were randomly picked
based on EST cluster quality and uniqueness and therefore
represent a wide variety of different classes of genes.
Application of a 16K cDNA microarray to different species
To explore the validity of using the 16K microarray with
other fish species, the 13,421 Atlantic salmon (AS) and
2,576 rainbow trout (RT) cDNA features were interrogated with labeled liver targets from four members of the
order Salmoniformes (AS, RT, chinook salmon and lake
whitefish) and one member of the order Osmeriformes
(rainbow smelt) (Table 1). The average percentage binding of AS, RT, chinook salmon, lake whitefish (LW) and
rainbow smelt liver targets to the 16K chip was 54.0%,
63.3%, 51.0%, 50.6% and 30.1%, respectively. The average percentage of targets bound to AS and RT features for
each species are also shown (Table 1).

Our study indicates that there are no significant differences in the percent of targets that bound to the 16K
microarray for the four salmonids examined (AS, RT, chinook and LW). There is a similar hybridization performance for all salmonids. However, RT targets do
consistently show higher overall binding to the microarray; the reason for this efficiency is not yet clear.

The hybridization performance of the rainbow smelt targets were roughly one-half those of the salmonid cDNAs.
Of the species contributing targets to our heterologous
hybridization experiment, the osmerid targets were the
most phylogenetically removed from the salmonid features. Indeed, a recent mitogenomic study places the
Osmeroidei in a separate clade from the Salmoniformes
[17]. These two clades are separated by at least 200 MY
with the Salmonidae having undergone at least one
genome duplication event since their divergence [18,19].
Other factors such as genome gene content (ie., numbers
of paralogs) and genome size are likely to be factors affecting the overall degree of hybridization [11].
Application of a 16K cDNA microarray to different tissues
Different tissues and organs exhibit differences in transcriptome complexity, depending on their cellular heterogeneity and differentiated specializations. The mRNAs of
a typical somatic cell are divided into three classes based
on their sequence complexity and diversity [20]. The most
prevalent class consists of only a few mRNA species that
comprise the abundant transcripts present in a cell. Often
these transcripts are dedicated to cellular functions common to all tissues, but they usually represent genes that
specify an organs' unique function. The high complexity
class of mRNAs includes thousands (perhaps millions) of

different mRNA species, each represented by fewer than
15 copies per cell [20].
However, it should be noted that some subsets of genes
that have been thought to be unique to one organ have
been found to be expressed in others. This has been demonstrated for transcripts in the brain-gonad axis, and is
probably not exclusive to these organs. For example,
mammalian pheromone/odorant receptors and specific
piscine hormones and receptors of the brain are also
expressed in the gonad [12,21,22]. To date, the biological
functions of these transcripts in the gonad have not been
determined, raising intriguing questions regarding multiplicity of functions for complex transcripts, even in diploid vertebrates such as mammals.
To determine the differences in the transcriptome complexity of seven different AS tissues and organs, the 13,421
AS and 2,576 RT cDNA features were hybridized with
labeled targets from midgut, brain, spleen, muscle, ovary,
kidney and testis (Table 2). The average percentage binding of midgut, brain, spleen, muscle, ovary, kidney and
testis targets to the 16K chip was 64.4%, 54.7%, 54.6%,
52.8%, 51.0%, 49.7% and 30.2%, respectively. In general,
about 45% of the salmonid microarray features were not
bound by targets from the various AS tissues and organs.
Application of a 16K cDNA microarray to the same tissue
from cohorts
To determine the amount of gene expression variability
that exists between individuals of a single species, we
compared the transcriptomes of livers from three fish with
identical histories. We compared the average percent of
variation (or scatter) in expression of liver transcripts
between cohorts 1 and 2 (liverpairs 1/2), cohorts 1 and 3
(liverpairs 1/3) and cohorts 2 and 3 (liverpairs 2/3). Two
separate experiments of six hybridizations each were conducted with each liverpairing having one dye-flip.

Examining each individual array in the intraspecies study
showed that the overall mean scatter was 12.6% (Table 3).
When the liverpair arrays and their respective dye-flips

were combined and averaged, the overall mean scatter was
reduced to 9.7%. This indicates that systematic unequal
dye incorporation exists resulting in high scatter values.
This dye bias has been well-documented by other
researchers [23-25] and illustrates the importance of
incorporating dye swap pairs when performing microarray hybridizations whenever possible. The overall mean
scatter was further reduced to 5.2% when the analysis
included technical dye swap replicates between respective
liverpairs (Table 3). This demonstrates that increasing the
number of technical replicates in a microarray experiment
is an important factor to consider for reducing random
scatter. It is encouraging that the overall scatter between
individuals from the same broodstock was quite low.
Thus technical and biological variability across arrays and
individuals can be significantly reduced by the investigator if the appropriate experimental design is employed.
Application of a 16K cDNA microarray to analyze BAC
contents
To assess the use of the 16K array as a screening tool to
identify the genes present in a salmonid BAC, the 13,421
AS and 2,576 RT features were interrogated with nebulized and labeled fragments from a single BAC whose
sequence has been determined (Table 4). Analysis of our
initial BAC hybridizations revealed that a high proportion
of transposon-like sequences and long and short interspersed nuclear elements were binding to the array. It is
known that many different repeat elements derived from
once-mobile transposable segments comprise large portions of the Atlantic salmon genome [26-29]. In an effort
to improve the specificity of target binding to the microarray for BAC hybridization, we employed a Cot-1 DNA
protocol to reduce the binding of these repetitive elements (Table 4). The addition of Cot-1 DNA increased the
number of expected genes identified and the number of
hits for the expected genes by displacing many of the
repeat family and transposon associated elements.

Although Cot-1 DNA did improve the ability to identify
genes for the BAC we examined, Cot-1 DNA alone is not
enough to block the complications that arise from repetitive elements in whole genome hybridizations. In preliminary comparative genomic hybridization studies we have
found that even with Cot-1 DNA included in the
hybridizations, the repetitive DNA segments found in salmonid genomes interfere with the interpretation of the
data. Most investigators are not interested in these repeti-

tive segments, but rather in the genes that are interspersed
between them. Moreover, we have found that often these
repetitive elements lead to false positives. Using other
methods, such as including repeat-element amplified
products with Cot DNA, as well as higher stringency
washes, might improve binding specificities. We are currently working on various strategies to maximize blocking
of this repeat element 'noise'.

Conclusion
We validate and demonstrate the usefulness of the 16K
microarray over a wide range of teleosts, even for transcriptome targets distantly removed from salmonids phylogenetically. We show the potential of the use of the
microarray in a variety of experimental settings through
hybridization studies that examine the binding of targets
derived from different organs and tissues. Intraspecific
variation in transcriptome expression is evaluated and discussed. Finally, BAC hybridizations are demonstrated as a
rapid and accurate means to identify gene content. We
expect that this array will serve as an important resource
for genetic, physiological, ecological and many other
fields of salmonid study.

Methods
Gene selection
cDNA library construction, recombinant plasmid preparation and extraction, sequencing, sequence analysis and
contig assembly for the GRASP have been described previously in detail [11-13]. Selection criteria for unique Atlantic salmon (AS) and rainbow trout (RT) cDNAs for
inclusion on the 16K microarray were as follows: ESTs
(cDNA fragments) were assembled into contiguous
sequences (contigs) by PHRAP [30] under stringent
assembly parameters (minimum overlap score:100;
repeat stringency: 0.99). Contig consensus sequences and
singleton sequences were aligned with non-redundant
GenBank nucleotide and amino acid sequence databases
using BLASTN and BLASTX, respectively [31,32]. Threshold for a significant BLAST hit was set at E = 1e-15.

It was determined that a contig must contain at least one
"usable" sequence, where "usable" was a)- the sequence
must be 3' (with high probability; containing polyA signal
or having been sequenced with an oligo-dT primer or
being at the 3'-end of a contig, with orientation determined by a strong hit against a protein in GenBank's nonredundant protein database), b)- be a sequence stretch

aBAC 92I04 was previously characterized. The assembled BAC sequence was BLASTED against the microarray gene identification list to determine
the expected gene number. Repetitive elements, transposon-associated sequences and unknown ESTs were not included in the total. Only the top

containing more than 400 bp, and c)- the sequence must
be at least 95% similar to the consensus of the contig.
It was also determined that if a contig was a singleton or
singleton-equivalent (where all sequences were from the
same plate or library thus not providing sufficient evidence for non-chimera status), then the contig selection
was reinforced either by a)- a significant BLAST hit, E<1e15 (BLASTN or BLASTX), or b)- it having 94% (or more)
identity with a homolog (either paralog or ortholog) covering at least 400 nucleotides. If the contig was a non-singleton, it was determined that it must be a)- one "block"
(having no regions in the interior of the contig covered by
only one sequence, to decrease probability of chimeras),
and b)- of high enough overall quality (with an overall
score > 95% positions without conflicts, weighted by
number of sequences which support the consensus) and
c)- have few leading and trailing singleton positions (no
more than 25%), since such positions make it a de facto
singleton.
Approximately 3,500 additional sequences were selected
with the following criteria: a)- no chosen contig could
have 94% or more identity with another chosen contig,
and b)- tentative consensus sequences (TC) identified by
TIGR [33] could be included. By these criteria, approximately 1000 clones were picked indiscriminately from
both normalized AS and RT cDNA libraries, 800 clones
were selected from suppression subtracted hybridization
libraries and 700 sequences were added from requests of
potential array users. Additionally, 949 non-overlapping
sequences (856 AS, 93 RT) from clones included in the
preliminary 3,557-gene chip (plus one T cell receptor
beta) were selected. Finally, approximately 500 immunespecific genes were also chosen to bring the total number
of genes represented on the chip to 16,006. In the 16,006
cDNA features there are 13,421 AS, 2,576 RT, 4 chinook
salmon, 3 rainbow smelt and 2 LW representatives.

Gene identification
EST contigs were built using cDNAs on the array as reference and all ESTs currently in the GRASP database. Subsequent to microarray fabrication, the consensus sequences
were screened for repeats using a custom salmonid repeat
database with RepeatMasker. Masked consensus
sequences were compared to GenBank databases. Using
the stringent selection threshold above, the current percentage of the 16K features that are known and unknown
genes is 55.8% and 44.2%, respectively. Analysis at less
stringent thresholds is ongoing to identify all genes on the
microarray.
Microarray fabrication
Clones were robotically rearrayed from daughter glycerol
stock 384-well plates into 96-well plates pre-filled with
7% glycerol in LB + ampicillin, incubated overnight at
37°C, and checked for uniform optical density. Plasmid
inserts were PCR amplified in a Tetrad PTC-200
thermocycler (MJ Research) using 1 ul overnight culture,
0.2 mM M13/pUC forward primer (5'-CCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACG-3'), 0.2 mM M13/pUC reverse
primer (5'-AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGG-3'), 2 mM
MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl, 250 mM dNTPs, 1U
AmpliTaq (Perkin Elmer), and nuclease-free H2O (Gibco)
to 100 ul. PCR conditions were: 2 min for 95°C; then 35
cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 45 sec, 72°C for 3 min;
followed by 72°C for 7 min. Five ul of each PCR product
were run on a 1% agarose gel to assess yield and quality.
PCR products were robotically cleaned (Qiagen) and consolidated into 384-well plates, lyophilized by speed-Vac,
and resuspended in 20 ul 3X SSC. Each purified PCR
product concentration was determined and diluted to give
a final concentration of 400 ng/uL.

All cDNAs were printed as single spots on EZ Rays aminosilane slides (Matrix/Apogent Discoveries) with the
Biorobotics Microgrid II microarray printer (Genomic
Solutions). Microspot™ 10K quill pins (Biorobotics) in a
48 pin tool were used to deposit approximately 0.5 nl (0.2
ng cDNA) per spot onto the slide. The slides were

crosslinked in a UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene) at 300
mJ. The resulting microarrays have a 4-by-12 metagrid layout with 19 X19 spot subgrid, each spot having an approximate diameter and pitch of 100 um and 0.20 mm,
respectively. A 280 bp GFP (green fluorescent protein)
cDNA was amplified from a GFP clone (Clontech) using
the primers (5'-GAAACATTCTTGGACACAAATTGG-3')
and (5'-GCAGCTGTTACAAACTCAAGAAGG-3') and
printed in each subgrid corner to assist in gridding.
Six exogenous genome (Arabidopsis) cDNAs were amplified from the following clones kindly provided by The
Arabidopsis Information Resource: rubisco activase [GenBank:T41667], protochlorophyllide reductase precursor
[GenBank:R30630], chlorophyll a/b-binding protein
CP29 [GenBank:N65746], PSII oxygen-evolving complex
protein 2 [GenBank:H36167], tonoplast intrinsic protein
root-specific RB7 [GenBank:AA067532] and ferredoxin
(2Fe_2S) precursor [GenBank:W43249]. The Arabidopsis
cDNAs were spotted in quadruplicate on each microarray
and used for thresholding (determining number of transcripts present). Also, a ubiquitin normalizer serially
diluted (50 pg, 5 pg, 500 fg, 50 fg, 5 fg, 0.05 fg and 0.005
fg) was applied to the array. Spot morphology was
assessed by visual inspection, SYBR® Green 1 (Molecular
Probes) staining or hybridization with labeled non-specific probe. To check clone tracking, 47 high quality
sequences were obtained from randomly-selected wells of
the cleaned, consolidated 384-well plates used for microarray printing. Each tracked clone had BLAST identifiers
matching gene IDs predicted from the re-array spreadsheet, indicating highly accurate clone tracking throughout the process of microarray fabrication.
Animals
Various tissues (brain, kidney, midgut, spleen, ovary, testis, muscle) were sampled from two three-year-old AS (S.
salar) adults (Pacific Biological Station, Nanaimo, B.C.).
Livers were obtained from several 2.5 year-old AS (McConnell strain) and chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) subadults (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, West Vancouver,
B.C.). RT (O. mykiss) tissues (Spring Valley Strain) were
obtained from Mountain Trout Sales (Sooke, B.C.). LW
(C. clupeaformis) livers were obtained from three-year-old
animals (Laboratoire Bernatchez, Université Laval, Quebec) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) livers were
obtained from adult smelt (NRC Institute for Marine Biosciences and Memorial University of Newfoundland).
Each institution that provided tissue, raised and treated
the fish in compliance with ethics committee or government body guidelines.
Tissue and RNA extraction
Fish were exsanguinated for several minutes. The tissues
were removed and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/126

stored at -80°C until RNA extraction. Flash frozen tissues
were ground using baked (220°C, 5 h) mortars and pestles under liquid N2, then total RNA was extracted in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNAs obtained from these
preparations were used for generating labeled targets for
microarray hybridizations.
Microarray hybridizations
The microarray experiments were designed to comply
with MIAME guidelines [34]. To minimize technical variability, all targets were synthesized in one round and each
hybridization experiment was conducted simultaneously
on slides from a single batch where possible. Each hybridization experiment included dye-flips to compensate for
cyanine fluor effects. Total RNA samples were quantified
and quality-checked by spectrophotometer and agarose
gel, respectively.

All hybridization experiments were performed using the
SuperScript Indirect cDNA Labeling System kit and
instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly, 5.0 ug total RNA was
reverse transcribed using an anchored oligo d(T)20 primer
in cDNA synthesis reactions that incorporated aminoallyland aminohexyl-modified nucleotides. The modified
cDNAs were then labeled with fluorescent Cy5 or Cy3 dye
in reactions with the amino-functional groups in coupling
buffer.
BAC DNA preparation
Previously sequenced Atlantic salmon BAC 92I04
obtained from the Children's Hospital Oakland Research
Institute Atlantic Salmon BAC library (CHORI – 214) was
isolated and purified. A total of 30 ug BAC DNA was
added to shearing buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl pH
7.5, 1 mM EDTA and 20% glycerol. The DNA was sheared
into fragments to a concentrated mass of 1500 bp by nebulization in an Invitrogen nebulizer (Cat# 45-0071) at 30
psi of N2 and concentrated by ethanol precipitation.

A total of 5 ug of nebulized BAC DNA was combined with
7.5 ug of pd(N)6 random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences), heated to 100°C for 5 minutes and then cooled
on ice for 5 minutes. BAC fragment probes were then generated using Klenow Fragment DNA Polymerase (exo-)
(New England Biolabs) in the presence of amino-modified nucleotides (Invitrogen) and labeled with fluorescent
Cy3 dye in coupling buffer (see above). Before hybridizations, labeled BAC with Cot-1 salmon DNA was heated to
100°C for 15 minutes, placed on ice for 5 minutes, then
warmed to 37°C; labeled BAC without Cot-1 salmon
DNA was heated to 80°C for 10 minutes and then cooled
to 65°C, before application of treated BAC to microarrays
(see below).

Microarray preparation
All microarrays were prepared for hybridization by washing 2 X 5 min in 0.1% SDS, washing 5 X 1 min in MilliQ
H2O, immersing 3 min in 95°C MilliQ H2O, and drying
by centrifugation (5 min 2000 rpm in 50 ml conical tube).
All slides were prehybridized in 5 X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.5%
BSA for 1.5 h at 49°C. Arrays were briefly washed 2 X 20
sec in MilliQ H2O, then dried by centrifugation. Labeled
DNAs were hybridized to prewarmed microarrays in a formamide based buffer (25% formamide, 4X SSC, 0.5%
SDS, 2X Denhardt's solution) 16 h at 49°C. The arrays
were washed 1 X 10 min in 49°C (2X SSC, 0.1% SDS),
and then 2 X 5 min in (2X SSC, 0.1% SDS), 2 X 5 min in
1X SSC and 2 X 5 min in 0.1X SSC at room temperature,
then dried by centrifugation.
Microarray analyses
Fluorescent images of hybridized arrays were acquired
immediately at 10 um resolution using ScanArray Express
(PerkinElmer). The Cy3 and Cy5 cyanine fluors were
excited at 543 nm and 633 nm, respectively, at the same
laser power (90%), with adjusted photomultiplier tube
settings between slides to balance the Cy5 and Cy3 channels. Fluorescent intensity data was extracted from TIFF
images using Imagene 5.5 software (Biodiscovery). Quality statistics were compiled in Excel from raw Imagene fluorescence intensity report files. Features were sorted
(16,006 salmonid spots each representing different
cDNAs; 24 Arabidopsis spots representing 6 different
cDNAs) and median signal values and mean numbers of
salmonid features passing threshold were determined for
Cy3 and Cy5 data separately.

For cross-species and tissue-on-tissue experiments, the
hybridization performance of labeled targets to salmonid
features was assessed as a percentage of features bound
from the numbers of AS and RT features passing a hybridization signal threshold, defined as two standard deviations above Arabidopsis signal mean. No transformations
or normalizations were performed on these data. Only
features deemed present by Imagene 5.6.1 (excluding
marginal and absent values) were used for analyses. We
also analyzed some of these data at two standard deviations above empty spot mean signal intensity and found
that this was a less stringent method of thresholding (data
not shown).
Intraspecific liver and BAC hybridization data analysis
(background correction, Lowess normalization, and fold
change gene list formation) was performed in GeneSpring
6.1 (Silicon Genetics). All scanned microarray TIFF
images, extracted ImaGene grid files, the gene identification file and ImaGene quantified data files are available
on-line as supplemental data [35]. The data is deposited

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/126

in NCBI's GEO repository under PLATFORM GPL 2716
[36].
