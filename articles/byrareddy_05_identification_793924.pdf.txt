Background
HIV-1 subtype-C strains are associated with more than
half the infections globally. The molecular nature of the
viral subtypes circulating in India is not adequately characterized. In the largest study ever to appear from India,
we recently reported a predominance of subtype-C infections in the southern states of the country (Siddappa N.B
et al AIDS in press). Unexpectedly, we identified 3 unique
B/C recombinant viruses in our cohort that contained
envelope of subtype-B origin.

Methods
608 seropositive volunteers were enrolled during 2000–
2004 for this study. Genomic DNA from the blood samples was characterized using a novel PCR that differentially identified subtype-C viruses in the viral LTR. A
subset of 115 samples was also analyzed in the env, using
DNA sequencing and / or HMA.

type-C. In this backdrop, the B/C recombinant viruses we
identified in southern India attain importance as these
recombinants contain naturally evolved B-env. We are
presently isolating molecular clones of these unique B/C
recombinants for further characterization of subtype-C
viruses.

Conclusion
Globally, the number of circulating recombinant forms of
HIV-1 is rapidly increasing. Importantly, the overall incidence of the recombinants is also on the rise. Our identification of two different types of unique B/C
recombinants in southern India, at a significant frequency, warrants an extensive nationwide investigation to
determine if a new epidemic is emerging in India.

Results
Out of a total of 608 samples, 602 (99%) were identified
to be subtype-C in LTR. Additionally, two subtype-A one
subtype-B and 3 B/C recombinants were also identified.
Interestingly, env sequences of two of three B/C recombinant viruses phylogenetically clustered with subtype-B
strains of the USA and the third one with Thai-B. SubtypeC viruses are hypothesized to have evolved to greater levels of attenuation, hence are less pathogenic to the host.
This hypothesis was further supported by the observation
that the prominent recombinants of subtype-C (B/C and
C/D) invariably retain env sequences derived from sub-
