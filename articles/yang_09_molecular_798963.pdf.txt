Abstract
Background: Porcine sapovirus was first identified in the United States in 1980, hitherto, several
Asian countries have detected this virus. In 2008, the first outbreak of gastroenteritis in piglets
caused by porcine sapovirus in China was reported. The complete genome of the identified SaV
strain Ch-sw-sav1 was sequenced and analyzed to provide gene profile for this outbreak.
Methods: The whole genome of Ch-sw-sav1 was amplified by RT-PCR and was sequenced.
Sequence alignment of the complete genome or RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene
was done. 3' end of ORF2 with 21-nt nucleotide insertion was further analyzed using software.
Results: Sequence analysis indicated that the genome of Ch-sw-sav1 was 7541 nucleotide long
with two ORFs, excluding the 17 nucleotides ploy (A) at the 3' end. Phylogenetic analysis based on
part of RdRp gene of this strain showed that it was classified into subgroup GIII. Sequence alignment
indicated that there was an inserted 21-nt long nucleotide sequence at the 3' end of ORF2. The
insertion showed high antigenicity index comparing to other regions in ORF2.
Conclusion: Ch-sw-sav1 shared similar genetic profile with an American PEC strain except the
21-nt nucleotide at the 3' end of ORF2. The insert sequence shared high identity with part gene of
Sus scrofa clone RP44-484M10.

Background
Caliciviridae is a family of positive sense single-stranded
RNA viruses comprised of both human and animal pathogens [1]. Caliciviridae family contains four genera, Lagovirus, Vesivirus, Norovirus and Sapovirus [2]. Various
caliciviruses possess common features. For example, they
are small, non-enveloped virus, 27-38 nm in diameter.
They possess a single-stranded, 7.3-8.3 kb plus-sense RNA

genome, a single 56-71 kD capsid protein [3], and a polyprotein containing confering motifs of a putative 2C helicase, 3C-like protease, and 3D RdRp. SaV are recognized
as emerging enteric pathogens in humans, swine and
mink [4]. SaV infection may cause diarrhea especially in
the younger [5]. It is currently divided into eight distinct
genetic groups (GI-GVIII) based on the RdRp gene.
Among these genetic groups, GIII can't infect humans but

can be cultured in vitro in the presence of bile acid [6]. The
genome of SaV consists of 7.1-7.5 kb nucleotide and
encodes two or three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1
encodes one polyprotein that contains coding sequences
for the nonstructural proteins and the major capsid protein (VP1), ORF2 encodes the minor structural protein
(VP2), while ORF3 is only present in strains from genotypes GI, GIV and GV, and encodes a small basic protein
[7]. SaV is considered as a significant global enteropathogen of acute gastroenteritis [8]. Recently, it was shown that
the host tropism of some calicivirus is less specific. Some
calicivirus may have zoonotic potential, and animals such
as domestic pig may be a reservoir for caliciviruses [9-11].
Porcine sapovirus was first identified in the United States
by electron microscopy in 1980 [12] and genetically characterized as a sapovirus in 1999 [13]. Recently, SaV infections have been identified in Japan, South Korea,
Venezuela, Hungary and Belgium [14-18]. In the United
States, porcine sapovirus was also detected from Oyster
[19]. Although porcine SaV was mainly detected in pigs,
some studies indicated that some porcine SaV might be
potential pathogencity transmitting to humans. For example, the porcine SaV strain (Sapovirus pig/43/06-18p3/
06/ITA) isolated from Italy was most closely related to

human SaV through the alignment of RdRp sequences,
suggesting the possibility of a pig reservoir for human
strains or vice versa [20]. We previously reported an outbreak of gastroenteritis in piglets in China caused by the
first Chinese porcine SaV strain [21]. In this study, gene
profile of this strain was investigated, the entire viral
genome and 3' end of Ch-sw-sav1 were cloned and
sequenced.

Methods
Samples
Porcine SaV positive fecal samples were collected from
commercial pig farms in Shanghai as introduced in our
previous study. Samples were converted to 20% (wt/vol)
suspensions in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.01 M,
pH 7.2 to 7.4) and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 g
for 10 min.
Primers Design
In order to amplify the full-length sequence, 15 sets of
primers were designed based on the sequences of
AF18276 and DQ056363 that were previously submitted
in the GenBank: Nucleotide sequence and position of the
primers are listed in Table 1.

RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
Viral RNA was extracted with TRIzol Reagent from supernatants of fecal suspensions, according to the manufacture's instructions. The cDNA synthesis was primed by
Oligo dT16 or the reverse one of each set of primers using
TaKaRa RNA PCR kit (TaKaRa, Japan) in a 10 μL reaction
volume. The reaction condition was 40 min at 42°C, then
15 sec at 86°C.
PCR and RACE amplifications of the full-length SaV
genome
PCR was carried out in 50 μL reaction volume, containing
8 μL dNTP Mixture (25 mM), 5 μL 10×Ex-taq buffer, 0.2
μL Ex Taq, 1 μL (25 mM) of each primer, 10 μL of template and adding sterilize H2O to 50 μL. The reaction was
done with the following profile: Activation of DNA
polymerase at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of
denaturation of DNA at 95°C for 40 sec, annealing at the
50°C for 1 min, extension at 72°C for 1 min and then followed by a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min.
Purfied PCR products were ligated to pMD-18T vector
(TaKaRa, Japan) and 3 to 5 positive colonies were
sequenced.
3' RACE
The 3' RACE was carried out with TaKaRa RNA PCR Kit
(TaKaRa, Japan) following the manufacture's instructions.

Briefly, ten microliters of RNA were used as template to
synthesize cDNA with AMV Reverse transcriptase for 1 h
at 42°C. The external reverse primer which has a poly (T)
tract was used to prime the cDNA synthesis. The cDNA
was then amplified with the external forward primer (5'TCAATTGGCTGGG TCACGTGAAG-3', nucleotide position numbers 7027-7049) and internal forward primer
(5'- CAAACACCTTTGGTCCACCAAGG-3', nucleotide
position numbers 7070-7092) with Ex Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Japan). The PCR reaction mixture was incubated for 2 min at 94°C, followed by 35 amplification
cycles comprising denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 65°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 30 s. The
product was extended for another 7 min at 72°C to ensure
a full extension.
The PCR products were purified from 1% agarose gel
using the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Gemany).
Purified PCR products were ligated into pMD18-T Vector.
For each product, three to five positive colonies were
selected and sequenced.
Phylogenetic analysis
Nucleotide sequences of the following calicivirus in Genbank were used in the phylogenic analysis (Table 2): SVs:

Results
Genomic organization of Ch-sw-sav1 virus
The complete RNA genome of Ch-sw-sav1 is consisted of
7541 nt, excluding its 3' end poly(A) tail, was longer than
the USA strain (GenBank no.: AF182760). It's A, C, G, U
ribonucleotide composition was 19%, 14.3%, 33.3%, and
33.3%, respectively. The 5' terminus genomic RNA started
with the featured trinucleotide GTG. Similar to the
genomes of SVs and LVs, the Ch-sw-sav1 genome contained two predicted ORFs. ORF1 was 6765 bases (2255
aa) in length encoding non-structural proteins and VP1
(544aa). ORF2, consisting of 516 bases (nt 6771-7286),
was predicted to encode VP2 protein with 172 aa. (Fig.
1A). The predicted polyprotein encoded by ORF1 contained the common 2C helicase (GPPGIGKT), 3C protease (GDCG), and RdRp (GLPSG and YGDD) motifs that
were highly conserved in all calicivirus. The PPG motif
was also present in the predicted VP1 (data not shown).

Sequence comparison
We compared the entire genome sequence identities of
Ch-sw-sav1 with those of other calicivirus, A phylogenetic
tree based on the entire genome sequence showed that
Ch-sw-sav1 was closely related to the SLVs than to the
other caliciviruses (Fig. 2). The phylogenetic tree was then
constructed on the basis of concentrated alignments of
RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene sequence of 31 SaV
strains by the neighbour-joining method (Fig. 3). All eight
genotypes were separated into corresponding lineages.
Within the genotype-3 lineage, there were four distinct
subgroups. The analysis indicated that Ch-sw-sav1 formed
a subgroup together with two USA strains, one Japanese
strain and one Hungary strain. Further analysis indicated
Ch-sw-sav1 shared 82.2%-91.2% identities with the other
GIII SaV strains, and it was closely related to the Hungary
variant DQ383274 (Table 3). Whereas, it was less similar
(< 57.1%) to the strains of GI, GII, GIV, GV, GVI, GVII,
GVIII.

the Treeview programs and are based on 100 bootstrapped
data sets. All sequence used in this analysis were collected
from GenBank. The virus detected in this study was marked
with black triangle and it was composed of a cluster with
PEC/swine-Id3/2005/HUN and Sapovirus swine/NCQW270/03/US, they also belong to porcine SaV genotype
GIII.

The 5' terminus of the genomic and predicted subgenomic
RNAs of Ch-sw-sav1 possessed leader sequences with a
Kozak structure (G/ANNATGG), which was favourable for
translation initiation of eukaryotic mRNA [22] (Fig. 1B),
similar to that of PEC (GenBank No.: AF182760) [13],
The VP1 region (544aa) of Ch-sw-sav1 was the same in
length as in PEC and slightly shorter than those of SaVs of
human origin. The ORF2 overlapped 4 nucleotides with
VP1 gene, common to others in PEC (Fig. 1C), but the
length of ORF2 was distinct. Sequence alignment based
on the 3' end of ORF2 of six available sequences in GenBank indicated that there was 21-nt long nucleotide
sequence insertion, which was similar to the gene module
of OH-JJ-259-00-US strain (GenBank No.: AY826423)
with 27-nt long nucleotides inserted (Fig. 4). Analysis of
antigen index showed that the inserted sequence was

Discussion
Sapporo virus was identified in 1982 from an outbreak of
diarrhea in an orphanage in Sapporo, Japan [23]. Schuffenecker [24] classified them into three major genetic
groups. Furthermore, it has been divided into eight genogroups based on the genetic diversity of the viral polymerase [25]. PEC, the first of pig origin, was discovered in
1980s in the United States and belongs to SaV GIII [12].

Hitherto, SaV has been identified in many countries [1418]. Traditionally, we thought only SaV GIII infected pig.
However, strains detected in USA and Italy that belonged
to new genotype showed high homology with human
SaVs respectively. It indicated that animals might act as
reservoirs for human caliciviruses. So it is necessary to
analyze the genetic profile of porcine SaV for the first step
of controlling the pathogen. In February 2008, we
reported the first outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by
porcine SaV in piglets in China mainland. It may be
caused by simultaneous contact with virus polluted water

or food and the virus gene profile was further investegated. Ch-sw-sav1 was chosen to be sequenced and compared with other SaV published. Results showed that it
shared high homology with PEC for the similar gene
structure and similar sequence motif at 5' terminus that
was favorable for translation initiation of eukaryotic
sequence [22]. However, there was 21-nt nucleotide insertion at the 3' end of ORF2 of Ch-sw-sav1. The inserted
sequence had a high antigenicity index analyzed with
DNAstar software. It's predicted that ORF2 encodes capsid
protein that is correlative with the assembly, antigenicity
and receptor interations of SaV. So the inserted sequence
may affect antigenicity profile or other profiles of capsid
protein which need to be further identified [1]. Accordingly, in phylogenetic analysis, we classified Ch-sw-sav1
into Genogroup III of SaV basing on the partial RdRp gene
sequence, and it shared highest nucleotide identity with
the Hungary SaV (91.2%) which was isolated from a
diarrheaed pig [17].

References

The porcine SaV strain in the present study came from an
outbreak of gastroenteritis in piglets group, which had
inserted sequence at the 3' end of ORF2. The role of the
inserted sequence was unknown, but it is highly divergent
in sequence and differs in size in caliciviruse s. Since the
ORF2 protein is functionally conserved and may be
involved in protein-protein interactions or proteinnucleic acid interactions during replication based on its
strong positive charge. The inserted sequence likely has
special biological function. So establishing full-length
infectious clones containing or not containing this
inserted fragment would now be the next step towards the
identification of this fragment involved in symptomatology and pathogenicity.

Conclusion
Complete sequence of the first Chinese porcine SaV was
determined and analyzed providing a gene profile of porcine SaV presented in swine population in China today.
Sequence analysis showed that it was classified into genogroup III with two ORFs. A 21-nt insertion in ORF2
changed antigenicity index of capsid protein.
