Abstract
Background: Proteins interact through specific binding interfaces that contain many residues in
domains. Protein interactions thus occur on three different levels of a concept hierarchy: wholeproteins, domains, and residues. Each level offers a distinct and complementary set of features for
computationally predicting interactions, including functional genomic features of whole proteins,
evolutionary features of domain families and physical-chemical features of individual residues. The
predictions at each level could benefit from using the features at all three levels. However, it is not
trivial as the features are provided at different granularity.
Results: To link up the predictions at the three levels, we propose a multi-level machine-learning
framework that allows for explicit information flow between the levels. We demonstrate, using
representative yeast interaction networks, that our algorithm is able to utilize complementary
feature sets to make more accurate predictions at the three levels than when the three problems
are approached independently. To facilitate application of our multi-level learning framework, we
discuss three key aspects of multi-level learning and the corresponding design choices that we have
made in the implementation of a concrete learning algorithm. 1) Architecture of information flow:
we show the greater flexibility of bidirectional flow over independent levels and unidirectional flow;
2) Coupling mechanism of the different levels: We show how this can be accomplished via
augmenting the training sets at each level, and discuss the prevention of error propagation between
different levels by means of soft coupling; 3) Sparseness of data: We show that the multi-level
framework compounds data sparsity issues, and discuss how this can be dealt with by building local
models in information-rich parts of the data. Our proof-of-concept learning algorithm
demonstrates the advantage of combining levels, and opens up opportunities for further research.

Background
The functions of many proteins depend highly on their
interactions with other proteins. Complete protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks provide insights into the
working mechanisms of proteins at a global level. While
high-throughput experiments such as yeast two-hybrid
(Y2H) [1-4] and tandem-affinity purification with mass
spectrometry (TAP-MS) [5,6] have enabled the survey of
whole PPI networks, the resulting data are noisy with a lot
of false positives and false negatives [7,8].
The construction of more reliable PPI networks has been
assisted by computational techniques. These techniques
usually employ a supervised [9-12] or unsupervised and
topological [13-16] machine learning method to predict
the interaction of proteins. While some of the methods
could predict PPI networks with high accuracy, they do
not explain how the proteins interact. For instance, if protein A interacts with both proteins B and C, whether B and
C could interact with A simultaneously remains
unknown, as they may or may not compete for the same
binding interface of A. This observation has led to the
recent interest in refining PPI networks by structural information about domains [17-19]. It has also called for the
prediction of protein interactions at finer granularities.
Since binding interfaces of proteins are enriched in conserved domains in permanent interactions [20], it is pos(a) The three levels

sible to construct a second-level interaction network with
protein interactions annotated by the corresponding
domain interactions. An even finer third-level interaction
network involves the residues mediating the interactions
(Figure 1, visualization of (a) by VMD [21]).
As will be described in the next section, some recent studies have started to perform interaction predictions at the
domain and residue levels. The data features used by each
level are quite distinct. While protein level features are
mostly from functional genomic and proteomic data such
as gene expression and sub-cellular localization of whole
genes and proteins, domain level features are mainly evolutionary information such as phylogenetic-occurrence
statistics of the domain families, and residue level features
are largely structural or physical-chemical information
derived from the primary sequences.
In the literature of domain-level prediction, the term
"domain" is usually used to mean a domain family, which
could have multiple occurrences in different proteins. In
this study we use the terms "domain family" and "domain
instance" to refer to these two concepts respectively, in
order to make a clear distinction between them. For example, PF07974 is a domain family from Pfam, where
ADP1_YEAST.PF07974 is a domain instance in the protein ADP1_YEAST.

Since the data features of the three levels describe very different aspects of the biological objects, potentially they
could contribute to the prediction of different portions of
the interaction networks. For example, some protein
interactions could be difficult to detect using whole-protein level features since they lack fine-grained physicalchemical information. These can be supplemented by the
residue level features such as charge complementarity.
Likewise, for the protein interactions that occur within
protein complexes, there could be a high correlation
between the expressions of the corresponding genes. With
proper gene expression datasets included in the protein
features, there is a good chance of correctly predicting
such protein interactions. Then if one such interaction
involves a pair of proteins each with only one conserved
domain, it is very likely that the domain instances actually
interact.
One may worry that if the predictions at a particular level
are inaccurate, the errors would be propagated to the
other levels and worsen their predictions. As we will discuss, this issue can be handled algorithmically by carefully
deciding what information to propagate and how it is
propagated. With a properly designed algorithm, combining the predictions and utilizing the data features of all
three levels can improve the predictions at each level.
In this work we propose a new multi-level machine-learning framework that combines the predictions at different
levels. Since the framework is also potentially useful for
other problems in computational biology that involve a
hierarchy, such as biomedical text mining (a journal contains papers and a paper contains key terms), we start with
a high-level description of multi-level learning and discuss three key aspects of it. Then we suggest a practical
algorithm for the problem of predicting interactions at the
protein, domain and residue levels, which integrates the
information of all three levels to improve the overall accuracy. We demonstrate the power of this algorithm by
showing the improvements it brings to the prediction of
yeast interactions relative to the predictions from independent levels (Software available [additional file 1]).
Related work
Two main ingredients of protein-protein interaction predictions are the selection of a suitable set of data features,
and an appropriate way to integrate them into a learning
method. Many kinds of features have been considered
[12], including sub-cellular localization [22], gene expression [23,24], and phylogenetic profiles [25]. With the
many different kinds of data features, Bayesian
approaches [10] and kernel methods [9,12,26] are natural
choices for integrating them into a single learning algorithm. The former unifies the whole inference process by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/241

a probabilistic framework, while the latter encodes different kinds of data into kernel matrices that can be combined by various means [27].
Domain family-domain family interaction predictions are
related to the more general goal of identifying protein
interaction interfaces. While some studies tackle the problem using features at the domain level only [28], most
other work assumes that a set of protein-protein interactions are known a priori, and the goal is to predict either
domain family interactions (i.e., which domain families
have their instances interact in at least one pair of proteins) or domain-instance interactions (i.e., through
which domain instances do proteins interact in known
interactions) [28-49]. The data features are mainly derived
from statistics related to the parent proteins. For example,
for a pair of domain families, the frequency of co-occurrence in interacting proteins is an informative feature,
since a higher frequency may indicate a larger chance for
them to be involved in mediating the interactions.
At a finer level, identifying protein interaction interfaces
involves the prediction of residue interactions, which
could be divided into two sub-tasks: 1) predicting which
residues are in any interaction interfaces of a protein [50],
and 2) predicting which of these interfaces interact [51].
Data features are mainly derived from the primary protein
sequences or from crystal structures if they are assumed
available. Docking algorithms [52] represent related
approaches, but have a fundamentally different focus:
Their goal is to utilize largely physical information to
deduce the structure of the complex from the unbound
protein structures, a considerably harder problem. Therefore, we do not consider them in this article and focus on
large-scale techniques.
From a theoretical perspective, our multi-level learning
framework is loosely related to co-training [53] and the
meta-learning technique stacking [54]. We will compare
them with our framework after introducing the information flow architectures and the coupling mechanisms in
Sections and respectively. Also, our framework by nature
facilitates semi-supervised learning [55]. We will briefly
discuss semi-supervised learning and its relationships
with PSI-BLAST [56] in Section.
Problem definition
We now formally describe the learning problem we tackle
in this study. The inputs of the problem consist of the following:

• Objects: a set of proteins, each containing the
instances of one or more conserved domains, each of
which contains some residues. Each protein, domain
instance and residue is described by a vector of feature

Page 3 of 14

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:241

values. Some additional features are available for pairs
of objects, such as the likelihood for a pair of proteins
to interact according to a high-throughput experiment.
• Gold standard positive sets of known protein-protein, domain instance-domain instance and residueresidue interactions. As in other studies on protein
interaction networks, we use the term "gold standard
set" to mean a set of sufficiently reliable data useful for
the prediction purpose, instead of a ground-truth set
that is absolutely correct. The positive sets could be 1)
contaminated with false positives, and 2) incomplete,
with false negatives, and a pair of upper-level objects
in the positive set may not have any corresponding
lower-level object pairs known to be in the positive
sets.
• Gold standard negative sets of non-interactions at
the three levels.
We assume no crystal structures are available except for
the proteins in the gold-standard positive sets, so that the
input features cannot be derived from known structures.
This is a reasonable assumption given the small number
of known structures as compared to the availability of
other data features.
The objective is to use the gold standard sets and the data
features to predict whether the object pairs outside the
gold standard sets interact or not. Prediction accuracies
are estimated by cross-validation using holdout testing
examples in the gold standard sets not involved in the
training process.
In this study we focus on kernel methods [57] for learning
from examples and making predictions. The main goal of
this study is to explain how the predictions at the different
levels can be integrated, and to demonstrate the resulting
improvements in accuracy. We do not attempt to boost
the accuracy at each individual level to the limit. It may be
possible to improve our predictions by using other features, learning algorithms, and parameter values. As we
will see, the design of our algorithm provides the flexibility for plugging in other state-of-the-art learning methods
at each level. We expect that the more accurate the individual algorithms are, the more benefits they will bring to the
overall accuracy through the multi-level framework.

Methods
In order to develop a method for predicting interactions at
all three levels in a cohesive manner, we need to define the
relationships between the levels, which is the topic of Section. We first describe two information flow architectures

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/241

already considered in previous studies, and then propose
a new architecture that maximally utilizes the available
data. In Section we discuss various possible approaches to
coupling the levels, i.e., ways to pass information between
levels. In Section we discuss the data sparsity issue. In particular, we describe the idea of local modeling, which is
also useful for network predictions in general. Finally, in
Section we outline the actual concrete algorithm that we
have developed and used in our experiments.
Information flow architectures
Architecture 1: independent levels
A traditional machine-learning algorithm learns patterns
from one single set of training examples and predicts the
class labels of one single set of testing instances. When
there are three sets of examples and instances instead, the
most straightforward way to learn from all three levels is
to handle them separately and make independent predictions (Figure 1bi). We use this architecture to setup the
baseline for evaluating the performance of the other two
architectures.
Architecture 2: unidirectional flow
A second architecture is to allow downward (from protein
to domain to residue) or upward (from residue to domain
to protein) flow of information, but not both (Figure
1bii). This architecture is similar to some previous
domain-level interaction methods described above,
which also use information from the protein level. However, in our case protein interactions are not assumed to
be known with certainty. So only the training set and the
predictions made from the training set at the protein level
can be used to assist the domain and residue levels.
Architecture 3: bidirectional flow
A third architecture is to allow the learning algorithm of
each level to access the information of any other levels,
upper or lower (Figure 1biii). By allowing both upward
and downward flow of information, this new architecture
is the most flexible among the three, and is the architecture that we explore in this study. Theoretically, this architecture is loosely related to co-training [53], which
assumes the presence of two independent sets of features,
and each is capable of predicting the class labels of a subset of data instances. Here we have three sets of features,
each of which is capable of predicting a portion of the
whole interaction network. Practical extensions to the
ideal co-training model allow partially dependent feature
sets and noisy training examples, which fit our current
problem. Learning proceeds by iteratively building a classifier from one feature set, and adding the highly confident predictions as if they were gold-standard examples to
train another classifier using the other feature set. The
major difference between our bidirectional-flow architec-

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:241

ture and co-training is the presence of a hierarchy between
the levels in our case, so that each set of features makes
predictions at a different granularity.
Different approaches to coupling the levels
To design a concrete learning algorithm, we need to specify what information is to be passed between different levels and how it is passed. Here we suggest several
possibilities, and briefly discuss the pros and cons of each
of them.
What information to pass
i. Training data
One simple idea is to pass training data to other levels
(Figure 1c, arrow 1). This can be useful in filling in the
missing information at other levels. For example, many
known protein interactions do not have the corresponding 3D structures available, so there is no information
regarding which domain instances are involved in the
interactions. The known protein interactions can be used
to compute statistics for helping the prediction of
domain-level interactions.
ii. Training data and predictions
The major limitation of passing only training data is that
the usually much larger set of data instances not in the
training sets (the "unlabeled data") would not benefit
from multi-level learning. In contrast, if the predictions
made at a level are also passed to the other levels, much
more data instances could benefit (Figure 1c, arrow 2 and
3). For instance, if two domain instances are not originally
known to interact, but they are predicted to interact by the
domain-level features with high confidence, this information directly implies the interaction of their parent proteins.

Algorithms adopting this idea are semi-supervised in
nature [55], since they train on not only gold-standard
examples, but also predictions of data instances that are
originally unlabeled in the input data set. Note that the
idea of semi-supervised learning has been explored in the
bioinformatics literature. For instance, in the PSI-BLAST
method [56], sequences that are highly similar to the
query input are iteratively added as seeds to retrieve other
relevant sequences. These added sequences can be viewed
as unlabeled data, as they are not specified in the original
query input.
How the information is passed
i. Combined optimization
To pass information between levels, a first approach is to
combine the learning problems of the different levels into
a single optimization problem. The objective function
could involve the training accuracies and smoothness
requirements of all three levels. This approach enjoys the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/241

benefits of being mathematically rigorous, and being
backed by the well-established theories of optimization.
Yet the different kinds of data features at the different levels, as well as noisy and incomplete training sets, make it
difficult to define a good objective function. Another
drawback is the tight coupling of the three levels, so that
it is not easy to reuse existing state-of-the-art prediction
algorithms for each level.
ii. Predictions as additional features
Another approach is to have a separate learning algorithm
at each level, and use the predictions of a level as an additional feature of another level (Figure 1c, arrow 2). For
example, if each pair of proteins is given a predicted probability of interaction, it can be used as the value of an
additional feature 'parent proteins interacting' of the
domain instance pairs and residue pairs. In this approach
the different levels are loosely coupled, so that any suitable learners can be plugged into the three levels independently, and the coupling of the levels is controlled by a
meta-algorithm.

A potential problem is the weighting of the additional features from other levels relative to the original ones. If the
original set of features is large, adding one or two extra
features without proper weighing would have negligible
effects on the prediction process. Finding a suitable
weight may require a costly external optimization or
cross-validation procedure. For kernel methods, an additional challenge is integrating the predictions from other
levels into the kernel matrix, which could be difficult as its
positive semi-definiteness has to be conserved.
The idea of having a meta-algorithm that utilizes the predictions of various learners is also used in stacked generalization, or stacking [54]. It treats the predictions of
multiple learners as a new set of features, and uses a metalearner to learn from these predictions. However, in our
setting, the additional features come from other levels
instead of the same level.
iii. Predictions as augmented training examples
A similar approach is to add the predictions of a level to
the training set of another level (Figure 1c, arrow 3). The
resulting training set involves the original input training
instances and augmented training data from other levels,
with a coefficient reflecting how much these augmented
training data are to be trusted according to the training
accuracy of the supplying level. This approach also has the
three levels loosely coupled.

A potential problem of this training set expansion
approach is the propagation of errors to other levels. The
key to addressing this issue is to perform soft coupling,
i.e., to associate confidence values to predictions, and

Page 5 of 14

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:241

propagate only highly confident predictions to other levels. For kernel methods, this means ignoring objects falling in or close to the margin. This approach is similar to
PSI-BLAST mentioned above, which selectively includes
only the most similar sequences in the retrieval process.
In this study, we focus on this third approach. It requires
a learning method for each level, while the control of
information flow between the different levels by means of
training set expansion forms the meta-algorithm. Since
each level involves only one set of features and one set of
data instances, traditional machine learning methods can
be used. We chose support vector regression (SVR) [58],
which is a type of kernel method. We used regression
instead of the more popular support vector machine classifiers [59] because the former can accept confidence values of augmented training examples as inputs, and
produce real numbers as output, which can be converted
back into probabilities that reflect the confidence of interactions.
Global vs. local modeling, and data sparsity issues
Global modeling
Taking a closer look at the prediction problem at each
individual level, one would realize that applying a traditional learning method is actually non-trivial since we are
dealing with network data. In a traditional setting, each
training instance has a class label and the job of a learning
algorithm is to identify patterns in the feature values for
predicting the class label of each unlabeled object. In our
current situation, each data instance is a pair of biological
objects (proteins/domain instances/residues), with two
possible class labels: interacting and non-interacting. In
order to construct a learner, one would need features for
pairs of objects. A model can then be learned using a traditional machine learning method for all object pairs. We
call this 'global modeling' since a single regression model
is built for all the data instances. Global modeling has a
number of major drawbacks:

1. Features for object pairs: it is not easy to construct
features for pairs of objects, since most available data
features are for single objects. This is particularly a
problem for kernel methods, which require a kernel
matrix to encapsulate the similarity between each pair
of data instances. For network data, this means a similarity value for each pair of object pairs. While methods have been proposed to construct such kernel
matrices [9], the resulting kernels, while formally correct, are difficult to interpret.
2. Time complexity: working with pairs of objects
squares the time requirement with respect to the
number of objects in the dataset. While state-of-the-art
implementations of kernel methods could easily han-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/241

dle thousands of proteins, it would still be challenging
to deal with millions of protein pairs, let alone the
even more daunting numbers of domain instance
pairs and residue pairs.
3. Space complexity: the kernel matrix has a size quadratic in the number of data instances. With n objects at
a level, there are O(n2) pairs and thus the kernel matrix
contains O(n4) entries.
4. Sub-clusters: the two classes of data instances may
contain many sub-clusters that cannot be handled by
one single global model. For instance, proteins
involved in permanent complexes may use a very different interaction mechanism from transient interactions in signaling pathways.
Local modeling
To avoid these problems, one alternative is local modeling [26]. Instead of building one single global model for
all object pairs, one local model is built for each object.
For example, if the dataset contains n proteins, then n
models are built, one for each protein, for predicting
whether this protein interacts with each of the n proteins.
The advantages of local modeling are obvious: 1) data features are needed for individual objects only, 2) the time
complexity is smaller than global modeling whenever the
learning method has a super-linear time complexity, 3)
much less memory space is needed for the kernel matrix,
and 4) each object can have its very specific local model.
For all these benefits, in our experiments we only considered local modeling.

Local modeling is most useful when the training data are
abundant and evenly distributed across different objects,
such that each object receives a reasonable amount of positive and negative examples to train its local model. However, when the training data are sparse and uneven, some
objects may have insufficient (or none at all) training
examples. For instance, among the millions of yeast protein pairs, there are only a few thousand known interactions, so many proteins have very few of them.
Our proposed solution uses concepts related to semisupervised learning: use high confidence predictions to
augment training sets. Suppose protein A has sufficient
known positive and negative examples in the original
training sets, and the local model learned from these
examples predicts with high confidence protein B to be an
interaction partner with A. Then when building the local
model for B, A can be used as a positive training example.
Predicted non-interactions can be added as negative
examples in a similar way. This idea is consistent with the
training set expansion method proposed above for interlevel communication. As a result, the information flow

Page 6 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:241

both between levels and within a level can be handled in
a unified framework. The expanded training set of a level
thus involves the input training data, highly confident
predictions of the local models of the level, and highly
confident predictions from other levels. Practically, training set expansion within the same level requires an
ordered construction of the local models. Objects with
many (input or derived) training examples should have
their local models constructed first, as more accurate
models are likely to be obtained from larger training sets.
As these objects are added as training examples of their
predicted interaction partners and non-partners, they
would progressively accumulate training examples for
their own local models.
The concrete algorithm
We now explain how we used the ideas described in the
previous sections, namely bidirectional information flow,
coupling by predictions passing, and local modeling with
training set expansion, to develop out concrete learning
algorithm for prediction of protein, domain instance and
residue interactions. We first give a high-level overview of
the algorithm, then explain the components in more
detail.

The main steps of the algorithm are:
1. Setup a learning sequence of the levels.
2. Use the model learned for the first level in the
sequence to predict interactions at the level.
3. Propagate the most confident predictions to the
next level in the sequence as auxiliary training examples.
4. Repeat the previous two steps for the second and
third levels, and so on.
Learning at each level
We use training set expansion with support vector regression (SVR) to perform learning at each level. Each pair of
objects in the positive and negative training sets is given a
class label of 1 and 0, respectively. An SVR model is
learned for the object (e.g. protein) with the largest
number of training examples (denoted as A). The model
predicts a real value for each object, indicating the likelihood that it interacts with A. The ones with the largest and
smallest predicted values are treated as the most confident
positive and negative predictions, and are used to expand
the training set. For example, if B is an object with the largest predicted value, then A and B are predicted to interact,
and A is added as an auxiliary positive training example of
B. After training set expansion, the next object with the
largest number of training examples is re-determined, its

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/241

SVR is learned, and the most confident predictions are
used to expand the training set in the same manner. The
whole process then repeats until all models have been
learned. Finally, each pair of objects A and B received two
predicted values, one from the model learned for A and
one from the model learned for B. The two values are
weighted according to the training accuracies of the local
models for A and B to produce the predicted value for the
pair. Sorting the predicted values in descending order
gives a list of predictions from the pair most likely to interact to the one least likely. The list is then used to evaluate
the accuracy by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) [60]. We have tried a range of values for defining the most confident set of predictions
(results available at supplementary web site), and the general trends of prediction accuracies were observed to
remain largely unchanged.
Setting up the learning sequence
One way to setup the learning sequence is to use the above
procedure to deduce the training accuracy of the three levels when treated independently, then order the three levels into a learning sequence according to their accuracies.
For example, if the protein level gives the highest accuracy,
followed by the domain level, and then the residue level,
the sequence would be "PDRPDR...", where P, D and R
stand for the protein, domain and residue levels, respectively. Having the level with the highest training accuracy
earlier in the sequence ensures the reliability of the initial
predictions of the whole multi-level learning process,
which is important since all latter levels depend on them.
Notice that after learning at the last level, we feedback the
predictions to the first level to start a new iteration of
learning.

In our computational experiments we also tested the accuracy when only two levels are involved. In such situations,
we simply bypassed the left-out level. For example, to test
how much the domain and residue levels could help each
other without the protein level, the learning sequence
would be "DRDR...".
Propagating predictions between levels
The mechanism of propagating predictions from a level to
another depends on the direction of information flow.

For an upward propagation (R→D, R→P or D→P), each
object pair in the next level receives a predicted likelihood
of interaction from each pair of their child objects. For
example, if predictions are propagated from the domain
level to the protein level, each pair of domain instances
provides a predicted value to their pair of parent proteins.
We tried two methods to integrate these values. In the first
method, we normalize the predicted values to the [0, 1]
range as a proxy of the probability of interaction, then use

the noisy-OR function [48] to infer the chance that the
parent objects interact. Let X and Y be the two sets of
lower-level objects, and p(x, y) denotes the probability of
interaction between two objects x ∈ X and y ∈ Y, then the
chance that the two parent objects interact is 1 - ∏x∈X,
y∈Y(1 - p(x, y)), i.e., the parent objects interact if and only
if at least one pair of its children objects interact. In the
second method, we simply take the maximum of the values. In the ideal case where all predicted values are either
0 or 1, both methods are exactly the same as taking the OR
of the values. When the values are noisy, the former is
more robust as it does not depend on a single value. Yet
its value is dominantly affected by a large number of fuzzy
predicted values with intermediate confidence, and is thus
less sensitive. Since in our tests it does not provide superior performance, in the following we report results for the
second method.

Data
Protein level
Data features were gathered from multiple sources (Table
1), including phylogenetic profiles [62], sub-cellular
localization [22], gene expression [24,63], and yeast twohybrid [1,4] and TAP-MS [5,6] networks. Each of them
was turned into a kernel matrix and the final kernel was
the summation of them, as in previous studies [12,26].

For a downward propagation (P→D, P→R or D→R), we
inherit the predicted value of the parent pair as the prior
belief that the object pairs from the two parents will interact. For example, if we are propagating information from
the protein level to the domain level, each pair of domain
instances has a prior belief of interaction equal to the predicted likelihood that their parent proteins interact.

A gold standard positive set was constructed from the
union of experimentally verified or structurally determined protein interactions from MIPS [64], DIP [65] and
iPfam [66] with duplicates removed. The MIPS portion
was based on the 18 May 2006 version, and only physical
interactions not obtained from high throughput experiments were included. The DIP portion was based on the 7
Oct 2007 version, and only interactions from small-scale
experiments or multiple experiments were included. The
iPfam portion was based on version 21 of Pfam [67]. A
total of 1681 proteins with all data features and at least
one interaction were included in the final dataset, forming
3201 interactions. A gold standard negative set with the
same number of protein pairs was then created from random pairs of proteins not known to interact in the positive set [9,32].

In both cases, after computing the probability of interaction for each pair of objects in the next level based on the
predicted values at the current level, we again add the
most confident positive and negative predictions as auxiliary training examples for the next level, with the probabilities used as the confidence values of these examples.

Domain level
We included two types of features at the domain level: coevolution and statistics related to parent proteins (Table
2). These are similar to the features used by previous studies for domain family/domain instance interaction predictions [28,47,68].

In the actual implementation, we used the Java package
libsvm [61] for SVR, and the Java version of lapack http:/
/www.netlib.org/lapack/ for some matrix manipulations.

The gold standard positive set was taken from iPfam,
where two domain instances are defined as interacting if
they are close enough in 3D structure and some of their
residues are predicted to form bonding according to their
distances and chemistry. After intersecting with the proteins considered at the protein level, a total of 422 domain
instance interactions were included, which involves 272
protein interactions and 317 domain instances from 223

proteins and 252 domain families. A negative set with the
same number of domain instance pairs was then formed
from random pairs of domain instances in the positive set.
All known yeast Pfam domain instances of the proteins
were involved in the learning, many of which do not have
any known interactions in the gold standard positive set.
Altogether 2389 domain instances from 1681 proteins
and 1184 domain families were included.
Residue level
We used three data features derived from sequences
(Table 3). Charge complementarity and other features
likely useful for interaction predictions are implicit in the
sequence profiles. The features are similar to those used in
a previous study [51]. However, as we do not assume the
availability of crystal structures of unlabeled objects, the
secondary structures and solvent accessible surface areas
we used were algorithmically predicted from sequence
instead of derived from structures. We used SABLE [69] to
make such predictions. Information about empirical kernel map and constant shift embedding can be found in
[70] and [71], respectively.

In a previous study [51], the feature set of a residue
involves not only the features of the residue itself, but also

neighboring residues closest to it in the crystal structure,
which allows for the possibility that some of them are
involved in the same binding site and thus have dependent interactions. In the absence of crystal structures, we
instead included a window of residues right before and
after a residue in the primary sequence to construct its feature set. We chose a small window size of 5 to make sure
that the included residues are physically close in the
unknown 3D structures.
The gold standard positive set was taken from iPfam,
where the interacting residues are determined based on
their proximity in known crystal structures of interacting
proteins. Since there is a large number of residue pairs, we
only sampled 2000 interactions, which involve 228 protein pairs, 327 domain instance pairs and 3053 residues
from 195 proteins, 279 domain instances and 224
domain families. Only these 3053 residues were included
in the data set. A negative set was created by randomly
sampling from these residues 2000 residue pairs that do
not have known interactions in iPfam.
Evaluation procedure
We used ten-fold cross validation to evaluate the performance of our algorithm. Since the objects in the three levels

are correlated, an obvious performance gain would be
obtained if in a certain fold the training set of a level contains some direct information about the testing set
instances of another level. For example, if a residue interaction in the positive training set comes from a protein
pair in the testing set, then the corresponding protein
interaction can be directly inferred and thus the residue
interaction would create a fake improvement for the predictions at the protein level. This problem was avoided by
partitioning the object pairs in the three levels consistently. First, the known protein interactions in iPfam were
divided into ten folds. Then, each domain instance interaction and each residue interaction was put into the fold
in which the parent protein interaction was assigned.
Finally, the remaining protein interactions and all the
negative sets were randomly divided into ten folds.
Each time, one of the folds was held out as the testing set
and the other nine folds were used for training. We used
the area under the ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristics) curve (AUC) [60] to evaluate the prediction accuracies. For each level, all object pairs in the gold standard
positive and negative sets were sorted in descending order
of the predicted values of interaction they received when
taking the role of testing instances. The possible values of
AUC range from 0 to 1, where 1 corresponds to the ideal
situation where all positive examples are given a higher
predicted value than all negative examples, and 0.5 is the
expected value of a random ordering.
We compared the prediction accuracies in three cases:
independent levels, unidirectional flow of training information only, and bidirectional flow of both training
information and predictions. For the latter two cases, we
compared the performance when different combinations
of the three levels were involved in training.
For independent levels, we trained each level independently using its own training set, and then used the predictions as initial estimates to retrain for ten feedback
iterations. This iterative procedure was to make sure that
any accuracy improvements observed in the other architectures were at least in part due to the communications
between the different levels, instead of merely the effect of

semi-supervised learning at a single level. For unidirectional flow, we focused on downward flow of information. The levels were always arranged with upper levels
coming before lower levels.

Results
Table 4 summarizes the prediction accuracies of the three
levels. All numbers correspond to the average results
among the ten feedback iterations. Each row represents
the results of one level. For unidirectional flow and bidirectional flow, the levels involved in training are also
listed. For example, the PR column of unidirectional flow
involves the use of the protein-level training sets in setting
up the initial estimate of the residue interactions. This has
no effect on the predictions at the protein level since information only flows downward. The cell at the row for protein interactions is therefore left blank. The best result in
each row is in bold face.
We first notice that the results for independent levels are
consistent with our expectations. Having many diverse
data features, the protein level has a satisfactory accuracy.
On the other hand, the accuracies of the domain and residue levels were relatively low due to their weak and noisy
features. Note that we are predicting whether two arbitrary
domain instances or two arbitrary residues interact, rather
than only those in known interacting protein pairs. This
setting is more realistic for organisms with no known protein interaction network, and the problem is significantly
harder than when the protein interaction network is available.
Downward flow of training information did help the prediction of domain instance interactions. However, the
results of the residue level are quite unsatisfactory, with
accuracies even lower than those with independent levels
no matter assisted by the training examples of the protein
level or domain level. In contrast, the results for bidirectional flow are encouraging. In all cases, the accuracies are
higher than the other two architectures. For example,
while using the domain level to help the residue level
decreased the accuracy of the latter from 0.5675 to 0.5128
with unidirectional flow, the accuracy was increased to
0.6182 with bidirectional flow. As an illustration of the

The improvements for both the domain and residue levels
are quite dramatic, with maximum AUC gains of more
than 0.15. This clearly shows the benefits of passing not
only training information, but also highly confident predictions. Consider a domain instance pair in the testing
set of a certain fold. Since the corresponding parent protein pair must not be in the training set at the protein level
of the fold, the passing of training information does not
directly help predict the interaction status of the domain
instance pair. On the other hand, if the interaction status
of the protein pair is predicted correctly with high confidence, passing this information to the domain level can
make a direct influence on the prediction of the domain
instance interaction. For instance, if the protein pair is correctly predicted as not interacting, the domain instance
pair would probably be correctly predicted as not interacting, too.

lar, while each of the protein and domain levels improved
the residue level by a certain amount, the combination of
them provided yet another significant amount of
improvement.

In general, it is observed that levels with a higher raw accuracy with independent levels could offer a bigger improvement to the other levels. For example, the protein level
increased the accuracy of the residue interaction predictions from 0.5675 to 0.6581, while the domain level
could only increased it to 0.6182. However, it is also crucial to note that although the domain level has a low accuracy with independent levels, it could still make good
improvements to the prediction of residue interactions.
This observation supports our design of passing only
highly confident predictions in avoiding the propagation
of errors. The combination of all three levels has the
potential to further improve accuracy. For both the protein and residue levels, the best results were obtained
when all three levels were involved in training. In particu-

As a concrete example of information flow between the
three levels, several of the interacting residue pairs
between the hexokinase 1 (PF00349) and hexokinase 2
(PF03727) domains of the hexokinase isoenzyme 2
(HXK2) protein are correctly identified with high likelihood of interaction. For example, residue 46 in the hexokinase 1 domain and residue 278 in the hexokinase 2
domain are predicted to interact with a score of 0.89 out
of 1.0. This might be partially due to the charge complementarity of the two residues in their PSI-BLAST profiles,
with the most conserved residues being the positivelycharged arginine and the negatively-charged aspartic acid
at the two positions, respectively. The detecting of such
residue interaction helps raise the likelihood of the corresponding domain interaction from a score of 0.27 to 0.72.

In turn, this helps detect the self-interaction of the glucokinase (GLK1) protein, which also has the two
domains. The interaction was verified in a two-hybrid
assay [1].

performance evaluation is very tricky. As we discussed,
careless definitions of training and testing sets could produce biases to the resulting performance. It is instrumental to study the optimal way of evaluation.

Discussion

Biologically, there are many interesting follow-up questions to be studied. The intricate interactions between the
different levels are not yet clear, and could form a larger
study of how the predictions change after receiving information from the other levels. One could compare different kinds of data features at the three levels and identify
the ones with the greatest complementary effects. Another
direction is to choose different kinds of residue samples
(e.g., only charged residues) and inspect the relative
improvements they provide to the protein and domain
levels, to determine the residues that are more significant
in a protein interaction.

The experimental results have demonstrated the great
potential of linking up the prediction problems at the different levels. This initial success encourages deeper investigations of the idea along various directions.
Algorithmically, other approaches to combining the different levels, including combined optimization and predictions as extra features, need to be studied. Currently the
features at the domain and residue levels are weak, as
reflected by their low accuracy when learned independently, and the small improvement they could cause to the
protein level. It is interesting to study ways to improve the
predictions at these two levels, and more directly extract
the complementary information hidden in these levels
that are useful for the protein level.
The current study is limited by a highly disproportionate
dataset, with much more training examples at the protein
level than the domain level. Together with a much weaker
feature set, the raw accuracy at the domain level is much
lower than the protein level, and the former could only
slightly improve the predictions of the latter in the multilevel learning framework. It is hoped that as more structures of protein complexes are solved, the disproportionality would be alleviated. In the meantime, it is interesting
to study ways to derive other features that could better
predict the domain interactions, and the mechanism by
which the domain-level information improved the protein-level predictions.
In this article we have pointed out some important issues
of both multi-level learning and network prediction,
including data sparseness and the existence of sub-clusters. While we have proposed methods to tackle them, a
detailed analysis of how these issues affect prediction performance and what other algorithmic strategies for tackling them are yet to be studied.
To predict the whole interaction network, it is needed to
reduce the time and space requirements. One possible
way is to intelligently select what data to exclude, such as
residues that are predicted to be buried deep inside the
core of a protein. Another idea is to group objects into
interaction groups so that each cluster can be handled
independently.
More insights could be gained by studying some theoretical aspects of multi-level learning, such as the hierarchical
structure of the prediction problems, and the issue of
noisy and incomplete training sets. With multiple levels,

Conclusion
In this article we have introduced the approach of integrating protein interaction prediction at the protein,
domain and residue levels. We have described the potential benefits of this multi-level learning framework due to
the availability of distinct and complementary data features at each level. We have defined three information
flow architectures for learning from the different levels,
and proposed various ways to couple the levels in terms of
what and how information is passed between them. We
have focused on the training set expansion method, which
is a meta-algorithm that passes predictions of a level as
augmented training examples of other levels. To avoid the
propagation of errors, we have discussed soft coupling,
which associates confidence values to predictions and
passes only highly confident predictions other levels. The
confidence values are used as the inputs of support vector
regression. For learning the interaction network at each
level, we have compared global and local modeling,
which has also highlighted the issue of data sparsity. We
have performed computational experiments using yeast
data, and shown that the bidirectional flow of supervised
and semi-supervised information between the different
levels improved the predictions over independent levels
and mere downward flow of training information. The
evaluation procedure involved special experimental procedures including training-set balancing and consistent
cross validation. Finally, we have suggested a number of
follow-up research topics.
