Abstract
Background: The high diversity of HIV variants driving the global AIDS epidemic has caused many
to doubt whether an effective vaccine against the virus is possible. However, by identifying the
selective forces that are driving the ongoing diversification of HIV and characterising their genetic
consequences, it may be possible to design vaccines that pre-empt some of the virus' more
common evasion tactics. One component of such vaccines might be the envelope protein, gp41.
Besides being targeted by both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system this protein
mediates fusion between viral and target cell membranes and is likely to be a primary determinant
of HIV transmissibility.
Results: Using recombination aware analysis tools we compared site specific signals of selection
in gp41 sequences from different HIV-1 M subtypes and circulating recombinant forms and
identified twelve sites evolving under positive selection across multiple major HIV-1 lineages. To
identify evidence of selection operating during transmission our analysis included two matched
datasets sampled from patients with acute or chronic subtype C infections. We identified six gp41
sites apparently evolving under different selection pressures during acute and chronic HIV-1
infections. These sites mostly fell within functional gp41 domains, with one site located within the
epitope recognised by the broadly neutralizing antibody, 4E10.
Conclusion: Whereas these six sites are potentially determinants of fitness and are therefore
good candidate targets for subtype-C specific vaccines, the twelve sites evolving under diversifying
selection across multiple subtypes might make good candidate targets for broadly protective
vaccines.

Background
Detailed characterisation of the selective forces that are
shaping HIV-1 evolution is crucial if we are to fundamentally understand HIV pathogenesis. To design vaccines
that will protect against HIV, we might ultimately require
accurate predictive models of how particular viral proteins
will evolve in response to particular selection pressures.
To avoid host immune responses, the virus' survival strategy is dominated by high mutation and recombination
rates that, while possibly jeopardizing its long term survival as a species, guarantees its short term success [1].
This selection for continual change, called positive (or
diversifying) selection, is driving HIV evolution against a
background of negative (or purifying) selection favouring
preservation of functionally important protein sequences
[2]. Thus, HIV evolution is characterised by a perpetual
tug-of-war between the immediate short term benefits of
positively selected immune escape mutations, and the
long term selective advantages of maintaining optimal
protein function [3,4].
These conflicting forces are perhaps most manifest within
the env gene that encodes the HIV envelope proteins. The
HIV envelope is made up of two components: gp120 and
gp41. These two proteins are targeted by both the
humoral and cellular arms of the immune system.
Whereas positive selection that is detectable in parts of env
encoding the exposed surfaces of gp120 is most likely
driven by the need for the virus to escape either neutralizing antibodies [5,6] or cytotoxic T lymphocytes, positive
selection at sites encoding unexposed residues is presumably driven by selection for both escape from cytotoxic T
lymphocytes and altered cell tropism [7-13]. Although
certain regions of env are particularly accommodating of
positive selection, most codons are functionally important and as a consequence many residues are detectably
evolving under negative selection [14].
Both gp120 and gp41 have functionally distinct but additive roles in HIV infection and pathogenesis [15]. While
gp120 mediates entry via CD4 and co-receptor binding,
gp41 is essential for post receptor binding events including viral fusion and assembly [16-20]. Despite these gp41
mediated processes being amongst the most significant
determinants of replicative capacity and pathogenic
potential in any given strain [21] there has been much
more research focused on the selective forces acting on its
partner, gp120.
Recently emphasis has been placed on the study of viruses
sampled close to transmission (during acute and early
infection) based largely on the premise that protection
against these variants must be the primary target of vaccine and microbicide development strategies. HIV is

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/141

believed to experience extremely severe population bottlenecks during transmission with usually only one, or at
most a few, genetic variants establishing an infection
within a new host [14,22,23]. As a large proportion of
transmissions are thought to occur during the acute phase
of infection [24], evolutionary innovations arising early
on in infections may also be disproportionately important for the long-term evolution of HIV in that many selectively advantageous mutations occurring later in
infections have a greater chance of "missing the boat" for
transmission [25]. The viruses that make it through the
transmission bottleneck may contain a lot of immune
evasion mutations that are irrelevant or possibly even evolutionarily harmful within the context of their new host's
immune environment. It would be expected that many of
these formerly useful mutations – especially those with
associated replicative fitness costs – would be strongly
selected against [26-28]. While the evolutionary relevance
of "transmission fitness" and the "transmission sieve" in
HIV [29,30] are currently under debate (see Lemey et al
[31] for a review), it is widely acknowledged that the
reversion of immune escape mutations that incur replicative fitness costs is a prominent feature of HIV evolution
[27,32,33].
Given that (i) transmission may selectively favour genotypes with high transmission fitness, (ii) recently transmitted viruses will have, on average, spent a greater
proportion of their evolutionary histories in acute infections than viruses sampled during chronic infections and
(iii) transmitted viruses generally enter an environment
selectively favouring the rapid reversion of some former
immune evasion mutations, we anticipated that the genes
of recently transmitted viruses might display marks of
selection that differentiated them from viruses sampled
during chronic infections.
We show here that whereas signals of selection in gp41 are
largely conserved between both different HIV subtypes
and viruses sampled during different stages of HIV infections, at least six sites in gp41 display signals of selection
that appear to differentiate viruses sampled during acute
and chronic infections.

Results
Recombination in gp41
As recombination occurs at high frequencies during HIV
infections [34-36] and can seriously confound inferences
of positive selection [37-39] it was necessary to account
for the positions of recombination breakpoints in nine
gp41 datasets drawn from different subtypes and circulating recombinant forms. The presence of potential recombination breakpoints in these datasets was first
determined using the GARD method [40]. The distribution of detected breakpoints was apparently non-random

with three breakpoint clusters identified (Figure 1): one in
the loop region; the second around the major trans-membrane domain; and the third in the region downstream of
the Kennedy sequence into the LLP2 domain. Analysis
using alternative recombination analysis methods implemented in the program RDP3 [41] confirmed that breakpoints clustering around the transmembrane domain
constituted evidence of a statistically significant (global P
< 0.01) recombination hotspot (Additional file 1). This
result supports a recent claim that gp41 is the site of a
major "inter-subtype" recombination hotspot in HIV-1M
genomes [42]. In fact the breakpoint hotspot detected in
the part of gp41 encoding the transmembrane domain
maps to almost precisely the location identified by Fan et
al [43].

than parental viruses, purifying selection will yield
genomes with breakpoints clustered within genome
regions that tolerate recombination well [44]. As with
mutation events, it is probably most accurate to think of
there being a continuum of different kinds of recombination events: From those that are lethal through those that
are only mildly deleterious or neutral to those that are
advantageous. Since the least deleterious recombination
events tend to be those that exchange self-contained
sequence "modules" which continue to function properly
within the context of genomic backgrounds very different
from those in which they evolved [45-47], it is possible
that the recombination breakpoint clusters that are detectable in gp41 simply demarcate the main modules of this
protein.

None of the three areas of gp41 where breakpoint clusters
were observed contain predicted hairpins or other detectable RNA-secondary structures that might have mechanistically predisposed these regions to recombination.
Besides being caused by biochemical predispositions to
recombination, recombination hotspots are also potentially caused by purifying selection acting on defective
recombinants. By culling recombinants that are less viable

selection signals detectable in multiple HIV subtypes have
already been described within gp41 [48,49], these signals
were detected without taking recombination into account.
Using the three recombination-aware selection analysis
methods in Hyphy we collectively detected a total of 346
positive selection signals across all 9 datasets (59 by SLAC,
159 by FEL and 128 by IFEL) at 89 different sites within
gp41. Purifying selection in gp41 is pervasive with 214 out
of its 352 sites detectably evolving under purifying selection in at least one of the nine datasets.
Examination of every site that is detectably evolving under
any form of selection in any of the datasets indicated varying levels of selection acting on the various gp41
domains. Analysing the ratio of sites evolving under positive and purifying selection in different parts of gp41 indicated that the LLP1 domain has the highest (0.578947)
followed by the MPER (0.545455) and the loop region
(0.461538). The fusion protein also has a high ratio of
sites evolving under positive selection (0.428571). The
trans-membrane domain (0.363636) and the C and Nheptad repeats (0.242424 and 0.184211, respectively)
have the lowest ratios of positively:negatively selected
sites. The trans-membrane domain is conserved and
shares common characteristics with other viral and cellular membrane spanning domains [50-52] and is therefore
unlikely to tolerate high levels of immune evasion driven
positive selection. Similarly the N and C-heptad repeats
need to productively interact with one another within the
gp41 trimer [53] and the conserved residues in their
coiled coil and helical domains required for these interac-

tions [54] are understandably evolving under strong purifying selection.
Seventeen gp41 sites were consistently detected to be
evolving under positive selection in two or more of the
nine analysed datasets (i.e. in at least two different subtypes or CRFs; Table 1 and Figure 2). All of these sites
other than that at position 172 were also detectable evolving under positive selection by more of the three analysis
methods. Of these 17 sites, five were situated in the overlapping rev exon 2 reading frame and, due to the confounding effects of overlapping reading frames on the
inference of selection [55], these sites should probably be
discounted. Nevertheless, the twelve other identified sites
are presumably globally subject to the same selective pressures and might therefore indicate good targets for
broadly effective treatment or vaccine interventions.
Studies by Choisy et al. [48] and Travers et al. [49] have
used multiple subtypes to respectively identify nine and
eight sites evolving under positive selection in gp41.
Whereas the Choisy et al., study focused on comparing the
locations and strengths of positive selection signals in different HIV-1 sequence alignments, that of Travers et al.,
focussed on likely selective pressures that have consistently shaped the evolution of HIV-1 group M env
sequences since their diversification from the original
group M founder virus. Choisy et al used a set of four subtype-specific alignments in their analysis and Travers et al.,
used a single alignment of 40 sequences containing
viruses from multiple subtypes. Although both these stud-

Graphical
Graphical representation of the sites under selection seen in table 1 on a consensus scheme of the gp41 domains. Each detection method is shown in a different colour. Positively selected sites are at the top and negatively selected sites are on the bottom. The height of the top bars is proportional to the number of subtypes in which the position is detected as evolving under
positive selection. On the underside only sites detectably under purifying selection in more than 3 datasets are represented.
The diamonds denote sites detected to be evolving under positive selection by Travers et al (2005), while stars denote sites
detected to be evolving under positive selection by Choisy et al (2003). The area overlapping the rev exon 2 is shaded in grey.

ies used a set of maximum likelihood methods with six
models of codon substitution, neither took recombination into account. Despite, the different methodologies
and datasets used between our analysis and these two
other studies, seven of the twelve sites we have identified
as convincingly evolving under positive selection across
multiple subtypes were also identified in these other studies. Importantly, our list helps reconcile differences
between these other studies in that it includes six sites that
were identified in one but not the other of the studies.
This both confirms the robustness of the methodology we
have employed and adds credibility to the notion that the
five other sites we have identified have also probably been
evolving under positive selection since the origin of the
HIV-1 M subtypes.
The locations of both the 12 positively selected gp41 sites
falling outside the overlapping rev exon and the five
within the exon were examined in relation to probable
glycosylation sites (PNGs), the position on the envelope

spike, and the presence of CTL and nAb epitopes. Glycosylation in gp41 appears to be required for stabilisation of
fusion active domains and efficient functioning [56]
rather than for immune escape. We accordingly found no
evidence of enrichment of positively selected codons associated with PNGs. We also found no significant association between the locations of CTL or nAb epitopes and
sites under positive selection. We obtained the same
results when all sites detected by two or more methods in
each subtype were considered.
Given that the majority of nAb sites are in the external
exposed domains of gp41, we analysed the sequences
encoding these regions separately from the rest of the
gene. In contrast with our previous result, within these
domains alone, of the 173 sites analysed, the nine sites
detected to be under positive selection in multiple datasets (Table 1) had a significant tendency to be located
within neutralizing and other antibody epitopes (p =
0.01356: chi squared). The LLP1 domain alone has 3 sites

evolving under positive selection, two of which were previously identified by Choisy et al. The LLP domains influence the surface expression of Env [57] and it is
conceivable therefore that they may affect susceptibility to
major broadly neutralizing antibodies such as 4E10 and
2F5 that target gp41.
Differences in the selection signals detectable in sequences
sampled during acute and chronic HIV infections
It is probable that the HIV transmission chain comprises
a repetitive series of selective sweeps that intermittently
remove much of the maladaptive evolutionary baggage
that accumulates under host specific selection. Whereas
this cyclical selection has probably amplified many of the
positive selection signals detectable in the coding regions
of HIV genomes, the strength and pervasiveness of these
signals is obstructive when it comes to pinpointing when
during the course of infection particular codons are evolving under positive selection. To identify sites evolving
under different selection pressures at different times during infection, intuitively it might seem as though one
need only sample some sequences during a particular
infection phase and compare the selection signals detectable in these to the signals detected in sequences sampled
during a different infection phase. The problem with
doing this, however, is that inferring the types of selection
operating on individual codons involves examination of
the entire phylogenetic history of the sequences in question. Thus selection signals detectable in sequences sampled during acute infections may have been generated by
selective process operating during the portion of their evolutionary histories spent in the chronic phases of past
infections.

It is however possible that the cyclical purging of deleterious immune evasion mutations during acute and early
infections coupled with the influence of a selective "transmission sieve" [14] might have left marks of selection on
sequences sampled during acute infections that differentiated them from sequences sampled during chronic infections. We hypothesised that while viruses sampled during
the acute phase of infection should carry slightly fewer signals of positive selection arising from transient maladaptive immune escape mutations, they might instead carry
unique selection signals indicative of long-term adaptation that would otherwise be obscured in sequences sampled from chronically infected individuals.
To test this hypothesis we compared selection signals
detectable by various methods in the subtype-C acute
infection (AI) and chronic infection (CI) gp41 datasets in
the context of selection signals detectable in datasets
drawn from other HIV subtypes and circulating recombinant forms. We devised a simple linear regression test
that could be used to visualise relationships between the

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/141

selection signals detectable in different datasets. Given the
largely overlapping evolutionary histories of the two subtype C datasets (Additional file 2), it was important that
we determine whether they also shared selection signals
that were more similar to one another than to those
detectable in other HIV-1 subtypes. This test clearly indicated that selection signals detectable in the AI and CI
subtype C datasets were more similar to one another than
were any other pair of signals we compared (Figure 3a and
3b comparing signals detectable by the FEL and IFEL
methods, respectively).
Given that the shared evolutionary histories of the AI and
CI datasets are contributing to many of the selection signals detectable in both, we sought to determine whether
certain subsets of codons within gp41 were detectably
evolving under different selection pressures in the two
datasets. To do this we partitioned all nine datasets into
sites for which there was significant evidence (p < 0.05) of
either positive or negative selection in any one of the nine
gp41 datasets. These "positive" and "negative" datasets
were further subdivided into three datasets each containing sites that, in any one of the nine datasets, were detectably evolving under positive or negative selection by (i)
the FEL method, (ii) the IFEL method and (iii) the FEL
method but not the IFEL method.
Whereas both the FEL and IFEL methods detect selection
signals associated with the internal branches of phylogenetic trees, the FEL method also queries nucleotide substitutions that map to terminal tree branches and are thus
assumed to have occurred more recently. According to our
hypothesis, the most likely source of selection signals differentiating between our AI and CI datasets should be the
substitutions occurring on these terminal branches. The
reason for this is that, relative to the CI sequences, on average a greater proportion of the recent evolutionary histories of the AI sequences will have been spent in acute
infections. By focusing on sites that were detectably evolving under positive or negative selection by the FEL
method but not the IFEL method (i.e. sites in partition iii)
we could test whether these selection signals were, as our
hypothesis suggested they should be, less conserved
between the AI and CI datasets than those detectable by
the FEL and/or IFEL methods (i.e. sites in partitions i and
ii).
For both the negatively and positively selected site partitions examined with either the FEL or IFEL methods, the
AI and CI datasets were more similar to one another than
any other pair of datasets (Figure 4a to 4d). As we had
anticipated, when only sites detectably evolving under
positive selection by the FEL but not the IFEL method
were considered, the AI and CI datasets were no longer the
most similar two datasets examined (figure 4e and 4f). In

the case of the negatively selected site partition the AI and
CI datasets were no more similar to one another than
either was to the other datasets examined. Importantly
this relative decrease in the similarity of selection signals
detectable in the AI and CI datasets is even more clearly
evident when the only sites considered in the analysis are
those detectably evolving under negative or positive selection by the FEL but not the IFEL methods in either one or
both of these subtype C datasets (Figure 4g and 4h). This
is consistent with our hypothesis that there are potentially
acute and chronic infection associated selection signals
within these datasets
It is important to point out that there was no significant
difference between the AI and CI datasets with respect to
the numbers of positive selection signals detected using
the SLAC (8 in AI, 7 in CI), FEL (18 in both) and IFEL (12

in AI and 14 in CI) methods. As expected there were fewer
signals detectable with the IFEL method than the FEL
method because whereas the former only models selection along internal branches of the sequence phylogenies,
the latter considers the entire tree.
Selection signals differentiating acute and chronic
infection datasets
Whereas no instances were found where there was statistically significant (P < 0.05) evidence of specific codons
evolving under purifying selection in one dataset and
under positive selection in the other using the FEL and
IFEL methods, there were nevertheless 41 sites at which
different selection pressures appeared to be operating in
the two datasets. More than half of these (25) are sites
where the differences between AI and CI were detected
only by the FEL and not the IFEL method with the remain-

der either consistently different for both methods (6) or
different for the IFEL method only (9).
From amongst the 31 sites where the FEL method indicated that there might be differences between selection
signals in the AI and CI datasets, we focused on six sites
where there was statistically significant evidence of selection in one direction in one dataset accompanied by selection in the other direction in the other dataset (Table 2).
Of these six sites, five are apparently evolving under purifying selection in the AI dataset but neutral or diversifying
selection in the CI dataset. We specifically assessed these
six sites for significant evidence of differential selection
pressures using a test based on the relative effects likelihood based selection analysis method PARRIS [37]. This
analysis provided additional evidence that four of these
sites (105, 163, 300 and 309) were evolving under significantly different selection pressures in the CI and AI datasets (Table 2).
The two sites at which the PARRIS based test did not detect
significant evidence of differential selection between the
datasets were 43 and 48. According to the FEL method
these sites appear to be evolving under strong purifying
selection in the AI dataset but under either weak diversifying or neutral evolution in the CI dataset. They are within
the N-terminal coiled-coil (NHR) region of gp41 and,
interestingly, mutations at site 43 are associated with
resistance to the HIV-1 fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide
(fuzeon, or T-20) [58]. A 23 amino acid region of the Nheptad repeat containing these sites described by Moreno
et al [59] interacts with negatively charged phospholipids
initiating the conformational changes that result in disassembly of the envelope trimer core, fusion pore formation
and six helix bundle formation that are essential for
fusion. The essential function of this site presents a sound
basis for it being subject to strong purifying selection.
Whereas the PARRIS analysis confirmed that these sites
were both evolving under strong purifying selection in the

AI dataset, it also indicated that they were evolving under
purifying selection (albeit apparently weaker) in the CI
dataset.
Codon 105, a glycosylation site within the loop domain,
is apparently evolving under strong purifying selection in
the AI dataset but weakly positive or neutral selection in
the CI dataset. In contrast with gp120, the gp41 ectodomain is relatively poorly glycosylated with only four or
five potential glycosylation sites [60-62]. While these glycans do not detectably affect susceptibility to antibodies,
their removal eliminates the ability of Env to mediate
fusion [61]. Codon 105 is demonstrably the most functionally significant of all four glycosylation sites in gp41
as it is the only one capable of restoring fusion activity to
envelopes with glycan free gp41 molecules [56].
Codons 163 and 309 are detectably evolving under strong
positive selection in the CI dataset but under neutral or
mildly negative selection in the AI dataset. Whereas site
163 is within the broadly recognized 4E10 neutralizing
antibody epitope [63] and is understandably subjected to
strong positive selection during chronic infections, site
309 is not within any well characterized CTL or antibody
epitopes. The LLP domains within which site 309 is found
may be directly exposed during fusion [64] and mutations
here are also known to affect Env incorporation, virus
infectivity and possibly virus exposure to neutralization
[57]. Evidence of slightly purifying selection at sites 163
and 301 in the AI dataset may indicate that potential
immune evasion mutations that occur at these sites during chronic HIV infections may incur "transmission fitness" costs.
Site 300 is the only site apparently evolving under significantly weaker negative selection in the AI dataset than is
detectable in the CI dataset. Although it is not clear what
the role of this site is in HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis, the apparent relaxation of selection at this codon during acute infection warrants further investigation.

Conclusion
Although gp41 is the most conserved component of the
envelope gene, it is evident that, as with the more variable
gp120 encoding region, it contains a relatively large
number of sites that are detectably evolving under positive
selection. While we have compiled a map of conserved
selection signals occurring in gp41 sequences of HIV-1M
viruses, we have found interesting differences in the selection signals detectable in sequences sampled during acute
and chronic subtype C infections. Our map of sites that
have possibly been under consistent selection since the
earliest HIV-1M ancestor and our discovery of selection
signals distinguishing acute and chronic infections might
help guide the development of broadly effective vaccine
and treatment interventions. The gp41 gene may feature
prominently in future vaccine strategies given that it contains many of the neutralizing epitopes identified to date.
The different selection signals we have detected in
sequences sampled during acute and chronic infections
might be rationally explained if one considers that viruses
in acutely infected individuals may have a higher transmission frequency than viruses in chronically infected
individuals [24]. One would expect that signals of selection should be clearest in sequences that are both sampled
during acute infection and have moved along transmission chains in which they have spent a disproportionately
large amount of time in acute infections. Although
sequences sampled during chronic infections might have
also experienced transmission chains with similar characteristics to those experienced by viruses sample during
acute infections, they will have spent an average of a year
or more prior to sampling within the evolutionary context
of a chronic infection. This time will have been sufficient
both for the reversion of slightly deleterious immune evasion mutations (and possibly their accessory compensatory mutations) that have occurred in former hosts
[27,65,66] and the accumulation of novel mutations with
adaptive value in their current hosts.
The selective sieve of transmission and the selective
sweeps that presumably follow it are still poorly understood and might remain so unless genetic characteristics
differentiating viruses sampled during acute and chronic
infections are identified. Current evidence relating to the
selective nature of the transmission bottleneck and acute
infection remains somewhat contentious [31]. Our analysis reveals subtle differences in the distributions of sites
evolving under positive and negative selection in chronic
and acute subtype C infections. This implies that selective
processes such as a transmission sieve might indeed be in
operation – a possibility that is supported by the fact that
some of the gp41 residues apparently evolving under
stronger purifying selection during acute infection are
involved in fusion or transmission related functions.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/141

We have shown that across multiple HIV-1M subtypes
and CRFs there are at least 12 gp41 sites that are detectably
evolving under positive selection. While a vaccine that is
protective against the transmitted viruses of particular HIV
subtypes (or even smaller genetic clades within these subtypes) would be a major advance, the holy grail of vaccine
research remains the development of an HIV vaccine that
will protect against all HIV genetic variants. The fact that
we and others have found, using a variety of inference
tools, the same set of gp41 sites evolving under positive
selection in a range of different HIV-1 subtypes indicates
a degree of consistency in both the immunogenicity of
these sites and the ways in which host immune systems
are most likely targeting them. Given this consistency it
may be possible to design a set of broadly protective vaccine immunogens that will induce simultaneous immunity to the common genetic variants found at these
positively selected sites. While vaccines that induce immunity to the common genetic variants of these gp41 sites
might be only partially protective, they should at the very
least constrain the viruses' evolutionary options and, in so
doing, potentially precipitate the evolution of decreased
population-wide HIV pathogenicity.
We have shown that variations in the selective pressures
experienced by viruses during the acute and chronic stages
of infections might be both detectable by comparing
sequences sampled during these infection phases, and a
useful means of identifying viral genetic features that are
important during either transmission or early infection.
Identifying the key genetic determinants of HIV transmissibility through similar but more detailed analyses of
selective forces associated with the transmission bottleneck and acute infection should not only identify good
targets for treatment and preventative interventions but
also inform the biochemical basis on which these interventions might operate.

Methods
Sequence datasets
Our acute infection dataset was derived from a subtype C
acute infection study in Durban, South Africa (CAPRISA
002 Acute Infection cohort) that is currently following a
cohort of HIV-negative high risk individuals and enrolling
study participants upon seroconversion [67]. Long-template HIV-1 cDNA transcripts were generated from viral
RNAs extracted from plasma from the first HIV sero-positive plasma sample of 40 study participants. The time of
infection was defined as the mid-point between the last
sero-negative and first sero-positive visits. Given this estimate plasma samples were on average obtained at 40 days
post infection. Whole genomes were amplified from
cDNA using a modified limiting dilution nested PCR
assay as described by Rousseau et al [68]. First-round
whole-genome products were used as templates to

amplify full-length envelope genes. The ~3-kb PCR fragments which included the entire gp160 were amplified
using the previously described envA and envM primers
[69] and directly sequenced. The gp41 region of these 40
sequences represented an acute infection dataset (AI dataset) which we used to identify genetic features characteristic of early infection [All Genbank: FJ229799, FJ229800,

Recombination analysis

using the GARD method [40] implemented on the datamonkey web server http://www.datamonkey.org Analyses
were run using the HKY85 nucleotide substitution model
with no rate variation (determined automatically to be the

Virology Journal 2008, 5:141

best model by a built in model selection procedure) with
the transition:transversion ratio being determined from
the data.
The distribution of unambiguously detected breakpoint
positions of all unique recombination events detectable
in a composite of all analysed gp41 datasets, (excluding
the AI subtype C dataset to ensure that individual recombination events were counted only once) were analysed
for evidence of recombination hot- and cold-spots with
RDP3 [41] as described previously [72]. Briefly this
involved for each individual dataset, detection of recombination breakpoints using the RDP [73], GENECONV
[74], BOOTSCAN [46], MAXCHI [75], CHIMAERA [76],
SISCAN [77], and 3SEQ [78] methods implemented in
RDP3. Default settings were used throughout and only
potential recombination events detected by two or more
of the above methods, coupled with phylogenetic evidence of recombination were considered significant.
Using the approach outlined in the RDP3 program manual (available from http://darwin.uvigo.es/rdp/rdp.htm,
the approximate breakpoint positions and recombinant
sequence(s) inferred for every potential recombination
event were manually checked and adjusted where necessary using the extensive phylogenetic and recombination
signal analysis features available in RDP3.
Selection analysis
Breakpoint positions inferred in the GARD analyses were
fed directly into the single likelihood ancestor counting
(SLAC) [79] fixed effects likelihood (FEL) [80] and internal fixed effects likelihood (IFEL) [81] analyses implemented on the Datamonkey web server for site-by-site
identification of positively selected codons. The methods
are implemented as a series of HyPhy scripts [80] that
yield site-specific evidence of positive and purifying selection. Using the results from the GARD screen the methods
make allowance for both independent inference of phylogenetic parameters over tracts of sequence separated by
recombination breakpoints and variable synonymous
substitution rates across gp41.

SLAC is a counting method that, given a set of input
sequences, an associated phylogeny and a codon based
substitution model, involves counting the number of synonymous and non-synonymous changes that occur at a
given site. This method examines nucleotide substitutions
inferred to have occurred on every branch of the phylogeny and incorporates weighting of nucleotide substitution
biases estimated from the data to determine whether
more or fewer non-synonymous substitutions have
occurred at particular sites than would be expected by
chance.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/141

Whereas the FEL method also uses the phylogenetic context of all nucleotide substitutions in the history of a sample of sequences to detect evidence of positive and
negative selection, the IFEL method searches for selection
signals only amongst those nucleotide substitutions that
have apparently occurred within the shared evolutionary
histories of at least two different sequences in an analysed
sample – i.e. it only counts substitutions that can be
mapped to the internal branches of an associated phylogenetic tree. Using FEL and IFEL together allows one to
phylogenetically distinguish between sites where signals
of selection are mainly detectable amongst nucleotide
substitutions associated with the terminal branches of
phylogenetic trees – such as, for example, mutations that
are specifically adaptative in individual hosts – and selection that occurs along internal tree branches – such as, for
example, selection associated with ancestral adaptations
in global populations [81]. Details of the methods and
HyPhy scripts used are available on the Datamonkey website.
We compared signals of selection between all pairs of HIV
gp41 datasets using linear Pearson regression analysis of
normalised dN/dS ratios of either all or selected subsets of
individual codons along the length on the gene. For each
pair of gp41 datasets one minus the correlation coefficient, R, was used as a measure of their similarity. UPGMA
[82] and neighbour joining [83] clustering algorithms
were then used to visualise how closely the selection signals in different datasets (represented by a matrix of 1-R
values) resembled one-another.
To obtain additional statistical data on differential selection signals detectable in our AI and CI datasets, we used
the relative effects likelihood based PARRIS selection
analysis method. This method uses likelihoods ratio tests
to fit each codon to one of 3 models of selection (purifying, neutral and positive) and assigns a posterior probability for each rate class at each site. As with the SLAC, FEL
and IFEL methods PARRIS also takes recombination and
synonymous rate variation into account [37].
We devised a simple statistical test to determine whether
homologous sites in the two different datasets were evolving under significantly different selection pressures. We
used PARRIS to estimate posterior probability distributions of ω for each site and from these we estimated the
mean and variance of ω. A variable synonymous substitution rate was selected, and the M1a and M2a models [84]
were compared to detect positive selection. We calculated
the mean estimated value (or μ) for each site using the
formula μ = ∑ PC C, where PC is the posterior probability
for each selection class. The standard deviation (SD) of
each estimate of μ was calculated as SD = (∑ PC(μ-C)2)0.5.
The estimated value of ω ± standard deviation at each site

was calculated and sites at which these ranges did not
overlap were considered to have signals of significantly
different selection pressures between the datasets.
