Fatty acid profiles and their distribution patterns
in microalgae: a comprehensive analysis of more
than 2000 strains from the SAG culture collection
Imke Lang1,2, Ladislav Hodac3, Thomas Friedl3 and Ivo Feussner1*

Abstract
Background: Among the various biochemical markers, fatty acids or lipid profiles represent a chemically relatively
inert class of compounds that is easy to isolate from biological material. Fatty acid (FA) profiles are considered as
chemotaxonomic markers to define groups of various taxonomic ranks in flowering plants, trees and other
embryophytes.
Results: The fatty acid profiles of 2076 microalgal strains from the culture collection of algae of Göttingen
University (SAG) were determined in the stationary phase. Overall 76 different fatty acids and 10 other lipophilic
substances were identified and quantified. The obtained FA profiles were added into a database providing
information about fatty acid composition. Using this database we tested whether FA profiles are suitable as
chemotaxonomic markers. FA distribution patterns were found to reflect phylogenetic relationships at the level of
phyla and classes. In contrast, at lower taxonomic levels, e.g. between closely related species and even among
multiple isolates of the same species, FA contents may be rather variable.
Conclusion: FA distribution patterns are suitable chemotaxonomic markers to define taxa of higher rank in algae.
However, due to their extensive variation at the species level it is difficult to make predictions about the FA profile
in a novel isolate.

Background
The analysis of the overall fatty acid profiles as well as the
occurrence of fatty acids (FAs) in different lipid classes in
microalgae is an emerging field which is expected to reveal
the identification of novel FAs with a variety of new functional groups [1]. Despite a number of reports has been
carried out and published, describing the contents as well
as the composition of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
in mostly marine microalgae [2-4], systematic approaches
that include different or even many genera of microalgae
and particularly those from freshwaters or terrestrial habitats are still missing [5].
Based on current knowledge, FA composition divides
microalgae roughly into two groups, i.e. on one hand the
cyanobacteria and green algae (Chlorophyta and Streptophyta) which contain low amounts of FAs, predominantly

saturated and mono unsaturated FAs as well as trace
amounts of PUFAs, mostly linoleic acid (LA, 18:2(9Z,
12Z): where x:y(z) is a fatty acid containing X carbons
and y double bonds in position z counting from the carboxyl end)). On the other hand Chromalveolate algae
contain significant amounts of PUFAs [6].
Among the various biochemical markers, FA or lipid
profiles represent a chemically relatively inert class of
compounds that is easy to isolate from biological material
and FA profiles are considered as chemotaxonomic markers to define groups of various taxonomic ranks in flowering plants, trees and other Embryophytes [7,8].
Beside the identification of novel FAs, some recent studies report on the use of FAs and lipid profiles of algae as
biomarkers [1,9-11]. Viso et al. determined profiles of FAs
of nine different marine algal groups and they were able to
define even species-specific lipid compositions [4]. Moreover they found a roughly taxon specific profile when the
cells were cultured under identical growth conditions.

were screened for their FA content and the application of
a FA-based cluster analysis has been described for their
identification [12].
FA and lipid composition have also been used as biomarkers to distinguish closely related microalgae at the
species and the generic levels [11,13]. Hitherto no systematic analysis has been carried out on a large scale basis
on either the profiles of lipids or FAs in microalgae.
Therefore, we determined the FA profiles of all available
microalgal strains of the SAG culture collection of microalgae http://www.epsag.uni-goettingen.de which is one of
the most diverse and comprehensive resources of microalgae. At present (March 2011) 2291 strains of mainly
microscopic algae including a considerable variety of cyanobacteria is available. They comprise almost all phyla and
classes of eukaryotic algae, but an emphasis is put on algae
from freshwaters and terrestrial habitats.
Distribution patterns of FAs may be valuable also as a
proxy to identify certain groups, species and strains of
microalgae of particular interest for applied research, i.e.
due to the presence of certain FAs and/or high percentages of total FA content. We also tested whether the
detected FA distribution patterns are meaningful in a phylogenetic context at various taxonomic levels, i.e. to define
taxonomic groups of microalgae by their FA patterns. It
would assist predicting FA content and/or presence of
other valuable compounds if the phylogenetic relationships of algae were reflected in their FA distribution
patterns.
Here the focus was set on esterified long chain FAs (C14 - C-24), which were analysed via Gas chromatography
(GC) with or without mass spectrometry (MS). The large
number of data obtained, were added into a database to
document the FA profiles of the studied microalgal strains.

Results and Discussion
1. A database of FA profiles from diverse microalgae

The characterisation of FA profiles of the SAG microalgal
strains was performed by screening long chain FAs (C-14
- C-24) esterified within lipids. A total of 2076 culture
strains from the SAG (equal 91% of the SAG’s holding)
were screened. A database was established which contained all identified FAs and some other hydrophobic
metabolites. An overview of all substances identified in the
algal strains screened is shown in Table 1. A total of 86
different substances were identified by mass spectrometry,
76 of which represent methyl esters of FAs. Out of the 76
fatty acids, 36 substances were identified by their mass
spectrum and by retention time according to a standard
substance, and the other 40 fatty acids were identified by
their mass spectra only. The remaining 10 substances
were identified by their mass spectra only as well. In comparisons with a standard substance, the compound was

Page 2 of 16

identified by comparison to mass spectra with highest
similarity to the proposed substance in the MS-library
(Nist02 or Wiley98). By this some methyl esters of
branched FAs were detected, for example 12-methyl-14:0
or 3, 7, 11, 15-tetramethyl-16:0. Whereas for most of the
FAMEs, authentic standards or MS references were available, for some other substances only “best hit” identification was possible. The DMOX derivatives enabled the
identification of the remaining 12 FAMEs. Unidentified
substances have yet to be verified with authentic standards, which are not available at this time point. The complete database is shown as additional file 1.
Bacteria in algal cultures (as contaminations or sometimes even through symbiosis) are well known and can be
found in culture strains of almost any algal culture collection. Only a small fraction (about 20%) of the studied SAG
strains may be in axenic state. Therefore, also the FA content of the contaminating bacteria may have contributed
to the obtained FA profile. To test this, we measured
methyl-15:0 and methyl 17:0 that are regarded as markers
for bacterial contaminations [4]. Only 34 strains out of the
2076 analyzed strains contained small amounts methyl15:0. This observed low rate of contaminating bacteria was
supported by microscopic controls which are routine in
the perpetual maintenance of algal strains (data not
shown). In summary, we conclude that only 1-2% of the
strains may have been contaminated and that there is only
a minor influence of bacterial contaminations on the
observed algal culture FA profiles.
In addition we compared the measured major FA profiles of 10 randomly chosen strains from different classes
with published data (Table 2), and it should be noted that
only one out of the 10 strains that were chosen from the
published data originated from the SAG collection. For 6
strains the FA profiles were very similar. In case of the 4
remaining strains major differences were observed in the
degree of desaturation of the FAs with different chain
lengths, which may be explained by the different cultivation conditions used in the different studies.
2. Patterns of fatty acid composition

FAME profiles were rather different among strains. As an
example, FAME profiles from four different genera, i.e.
Chroococcus (Cyanobacteria), Closteriopsis (Chlorophyta,
Trebouxiophyceae), Pseudochantransia (Rhodophyta)
and Prymnesium (Chromalveolates, Haptophyta) are presented in Figure 1. Therefore it was anticipated to
recover certain different FA distribution patterns
between phyla, classes and genera of microalgae. In addition, it was tested whether differences in FA patterns can
also be found for groups at lower taxonomic rank, i.e.
between species of the same genus or even among multiples isolates of the same species.

2.1 Distribution of four important PUFAs among strains of
the SAG algal culture collection

The distribution patterns of FAs among and within the
17 groups (phyla or classes) of microalgae and the cyanobacteria comprised by the examined strains was
investigated in more detail for four PUFAs which are of
high nutritional interest (Table 3). The frequency of

occurrence of these four PUFAs in a certain group of
microalgae is given as the percentage of strains with a
certain FA from all examined strains in Table 3.
Because the SAG culture collection focuses on microscopic algae from terrestrial habitats, the Haptophyta,
Dinophyta and Phaeophyceae were just poorly represented. Therefore, the recovered distribution patterns in

these and other poorly represented groups may not be
representative for the whole group. For instance, for
Phaeophyceae mainly microscopic forms (e.g., Ectocarpus and the freshwater genus Bodanella) were available
and the examined Rhodophyta strains covered mostly
freshwater forms or those from terrestrial habitats (e.g.,
Porphyridium). Although diatoms are very diverse in
terrestrial habitats, the examined small sample of available diatom strains (18) does by far not adequately
represent this group which is probably the most speciesrich algal group. Also, for each of the two classes of
Stramenopiles (heterokont algae), Phaeothamniophyceae
and Raphidophyceae, just two strains are maintained at
the SAG and, therefore, are not further discussed here.
Similarly, there is only a single strain of Chlorarachniophyta (Rhizaria supergroup) in the SAG.
The very long chain PUFA docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA, 22:6(4Z, 7Z, 10Z, 13Z, 16Z, 19Z)) was the third

most frequent FA, present in 15 out of 20 examined
groups (Table 3). In the Dinophyta, Haptophyta and
Euglenoids DHA-containing strains were particularly frequent and DHA was found there in relatively high percentages of total FA content, i.e. in 60% or more of these
strains the DHA proportion was higher than 5%. In the
single studied dinophyte strain of Ceratium horridum the
DHA proportion was even 29.3%. In the other groups
DHA was found in rather low frequencies and also
mostly in rather small proportions, i.e. less than 1% of
total FA content. Although DHA was found in the Cryptophyta and Bacillariophyceae in about every fifth strain,
its percentage of total FA content was less than 5% there,
except in Cryptomonas baltica SAG 18.80 (Cryptophyta)
where it is was 13.7%. Despite DHA was found in rather
low frequencies in the green algae (Chlorophyta), the second highest DHA content of all SAG strains, 18.9% of
total FA, was found in the chlorophyte Chlorococcum

novae-angliae SAG 5.85, followed by the trebouxiophyte
Prototheca zopfii SAG 263-8 with 14.2%. Together these
findings are in accordance with DHA amounts described
before for specific groups of alga [3,4,14,15].
Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5(5Z, 8Z, 11Z, 14Z,
17Z)) was one of the most common PUFAs, found in all
of the 17 groups covered by our study (Table 3). EPAcontaining strains were particularly frequent in the
Eustigmatophyceae, Glaucophyta, Xanthophyceae and
Rhodophyta. The highest EPA proportions of total FA
content were in the Rhodophyta, with about 81% of the
strains exhibiting more than 10% EPA. The highest
values were 52.4% in Compsopogonopsis leptoclados
SAG 106.79 and 44.9% in Acrochaetium virgatulum
SAG 1.81. Also strains of three species of Porphyridium
contained high amounts of EPA (31.2% in P. sordidum
SAG O 500, 27.5% in P. aerugineum SAG 110.79, 26.7%
in P. purpureum SAG 1380-1a). This is in agreement
with a report on P. cruentum suggesting that red algae
are a rich source of EPA [16]. Despite EPA was rather
frequently found in the Glaucophyta, only about half of
all strains had EPA proportions greater than 10% (maximum 31.1% in Glaucocystis nostochinearum SAG 28.80).
This is in agreement with another study which showed
high amounts of EPA (besides ARA) in the glaucophyte
Cyanophora paradoxa [17]. The highest percentage
(87%) of strains with an EPA proportion of greater than
10% was in the Dinophyta, but with a maximum of just
24.3% in Pyrocystis lunula SAG 2014. In the Euglenoids,
Xanthophyceae and Eustigmatophyceae about 67% of all
strains had an EPA proportion of greater than 10% with
maximum values of about 31% (31.4% in Heterococcus
fuornensis SAG 835-5, 31.6% in Euglena proxima SAG
1224-11a) and 34.6% in Goniochloris sculpta SAG 29.96.
EPA was rarely found and mostly in insignificant
amounts (< 5%) in most green algae, but three strains
had an exceptionally higher content of about 20% of
total FAs (24.2%, Chlorella sp. SAG 242.80; 24.0%, Chlamydomonas allensworthii SAG 28.98; 22.3%, Cylindrocapsa involuta SAG 314-1). EPA was the only FA
recovered from Chlorarachnion repens SAG 26.97
(Chlorarachniophyta). That Xanthophyceae and Eustigmatophyceae contain EPA in relatively high proportions
while green algae rarely accumulate EPA supports previous studies [3,4,14,15,18].
Arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4(5Z, 8Z, 11Z, 14Z)) was
most frequently found in the Phaeophyceae where it
was present in all strains except one investigated strain
(Table 3); in about 54% of all Phaeophyceae strains the
proportion of ARA was higher than 10%, but with a
maximum of just 17.7% in Halopteris filicina SAG

The frequency of PUFAs is shown as the percentage of the total number of strains examined per group.

10.96. ARA had the highest proportion of total FA in
the Rhodophyta; there even about 77% of all strains had
an ARA content of more than 10% with a maximum of
68.3% in Pseudochantransia sp. SAG 19.96. Interestingly,
the ARA content was rather high but variable among
the eight examined multiple isolates of the rhodophyte
Porphyridium purpureum. While the average ARA proportion was about 31% in six strains, it was just 3.8% in
SAG 1380-1d, but 44.5% in SAG 1380-1e. We have no
explanation for this variation yet; both strains were isolated from marine habitats and are kept under the same
culture conditions. High proportions of ARA (as well as
EPA) were already found characteristic of another species of Porphyridium cruentum [16]. ARA was present
in about half of all investigated Euglenoid strains and
with relatively high proportions of total FA content, i.e.
about one third of the strains exhibited more than 5%
ARA with extraordinarily high values of 41.3% and
34.3% in Rhabdomonas incurva SAG 1271-8 and Khawkinea quartana SAG 1204-9. Interestingly, another
strain of the same species K. quartana, SAG 1204-9,
had less than half (13.3%) of ARA content and in five
other species of Rhabdomonas no ARA was detected.
This demonstrates that FA contents may be rather variable between species of the same genus and even among
multiple isolates of the same species. Although about
half of all examined strains for the Xanthophyceae and
Eustigmatophyceae contained ARA (Table 3), they had
this FA in relatively low proportions. Only one fourth of
the ARA-containing Xanthophyceae strains exhibited

more than 5% and in the Eustigmatophyceae even no
strain reached 5%. ARA was rarely found in the green
algae, i.e. with an average frequency of about 14% in the
phyla Chlorophyta and Streptophyta, except for prasinophyte green algae where ARA was present in 42.9% of
all strains (Table 3). However, there were a few single
green algal examples with extraordinarily high ARA
contents, i.e. 73.8% (corresponding to 102 μg/mg of dry
weight, the highest ARA content detected in all investigated SAG strains) in the chlorophyte Palmodictyon varium SAG 3.92, followed by 52.9% in the chlorophyte
Trochisciopsis tetraspora SAG 19.95 and 51.8% in the
trebouxiophyte Myrmecia bisecta SAG 2043. That a
high ARA content was found in the latter strain is in
agreement with that it has been found a close relative
with Parietochloris incisa (syn. Lobosphaeropsis incisa,
Myrmecia incisa) [19]. P. incisa has been assigned an
“oleaginous microalga” and the richest plant source of
ARA known so far due to its capability to accumulate
high amounts of ARA (up to 59% of its total FA content) [20]. Interestingly, the SAG strain of P. incisa
(Lobosphaera incisa SAG 2007) had with 13.2% a much
lower ARA content (Table 2).
g-Linolenic acid (GLA, 18:3(6Z, 9Z, 12Z)) was the third
most common FA in the studied sample of SAG microalgal strains, missing only in the Haptophyta, Dinophyta
and Euglenoids (Table 3). It was most frequently detected
in two lineages of green algae, the prasinophytes and the
Streptophyta. In prasinophytes, however, GLA was present only in one out of five genera available for that

Lang et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:124
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/124

group, Tetraselmis, and there in 12 out of the 17 available
strains and with variable proportions, i.e. 0.5 - 7.3% of
total FA content. In the Streptophyta, GLA was more
widely distributed, i.e. it was detected in 17 out of 41
examined genera. GLA distribution was rather variable
within strains and species of a certain streptophyte
genus, similar to findings of ARA in other genera. Relatively high percentages of GLA were found in species/
strains of Closterium (16.5% in C. baillyanum SAG 50.89,
8% in C. lunula SAG 7.84), but GLA was not found in
the other 12 strains of that genus. Similarly, in the many
strains available for Cosmarium (25) and Micrasterias
(16), GLA was found in only 11 and 2 strains, respectively. The highest percentages of GLA were found in the
green algal class Chlorophyceae (29.9% in Deasonia multinucleata SAG 25.95, 28.5% in Desmodesmus multiformis SAG 26.91) and in Cyanobacteria (24.8% in Spirulina
maxima SAG 84.79). In about one third (32%) of all
chlorophyte GLA strains this FA had precentages of 5%
and higher. Distribution of GLA in the cyanobacteria was
rather patchy, i.e. the 27 cyanobacteria strains with GLA
were mainly restricted to three genera, Calothrix (8
strains), Microcystis (7 strains) and Spirulina (6 strains).
Also within each of these genera the GLA percentages
were quite variable, e.g. in Spirulina it varied from 4.6%
to 24.8%, and three strains where without GLA. FA composition has previously been used to discriminate cyanobacteria in isolates and natural samples at the generic
level [21,22]. To discriminate species of cyanobacteria, as
an additional marker the hydrocarbon composition was
used in an earlier study, but in our study we failed to
detect any substance out of this group [23]. Interestingly,
GLA was the only FA that was detected in more than
three out of the 223 examined strains. Therefore, the
SAG cyanobacteria strains may be roughly divided into
those with GLA present (few genera) and those where
almost no PUFAs were present. This corresponds to the
earlier findings that described a bipartition of cyanobacteria, independent of their taxonomic position, into genera producing C-18 PUFA and those which do not
[24,25].
The prasinophyte genus Tetraselmis presented an
interesting example to test for FA variation among closely related isolates. Nine strains assigned to that genus
have been isolated from the same (marine) locality and
regarded as the same species by the isolator (U.G.
Schlösser, pers. comm.). Only in two strains DHA was
present, but in very small traces (0.3% and 0.4%). In
contrast, ARA and GLA were found in all isolates with
percentages varying from 0.8% to 2.7% and 0.5% to
7.3%, respectively.
2.2 Analysis of FA distribution patterns

The detected fatty acid (FA) composition of the 2076
investigated strains was statistically analyzed to test

Page 7 of 16

whether certain patterns of FA distribution among the
various investigated algal groups are present that may
correspond to their phylogenetic relationships. In a first
set of three analyses (higher taxonomic levels) it was
tested 1) whether FA distribution patterns may reflect
differences among algal phyla derived from primary
(Plantae supergroup) or secondary endocytobiosis (Chromalveolates, Euglenoids) compared to cyanobacteria
representing the plastid origin, 2) the distinction of phyla
within the Plantae supergroup (Chlorophyta, Streptophyta, Rhodophyta/Glaucophyta) and 3) major evolutionary lineages (classes) within the Chlorophyta. A second
set of analyses focused at the generic level, i.e.it was
tested whether separation of genera as based on previous
18S rDNA sequence analyses suggested for Chlamydomonas s.l., Chlorella s.l. and Scenedesmus s.l. are reflected
in the FA distribution patterns. For the first set of analyses the many species (266) which were represented as
multiple strains (e.g., Chlamydomonas moewusii, 28) had
to be reduced to only a single strain per species to avoid
biases. This included also the multiple strains unidentified at the species level, i.e. labelled with “sp.” instead a
species name (e.g., Chlorogonium sp., 26). The SAG’s
Chlorophyta strains were particularly rich in such multiple strains. Also excluded were those strains where only a
single FA was detected. This reduced the total number of
strains considered in our calculations to 1193. The
strains were then divided into eleven groups roughly corresponding to phyla or classes (Additional file 2). Strains
belonging to the Chlorophyta (61% of all investigated
strains) were further subdivided into the three classes,
Chlorophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, and Ulvophyceae,
whereas the prasinophyte SAG green algal strains (1.7%
of all considered Chlorophyta strains) were excluded
from the analyses because they comprised only very few
species (10). The strains of Glaucophyta (15) and Rhodophyta (81) were collectively treated as one composite
unit. The Rhizaria - Chlorarachniophyta, was represented
just by a single strain and, thus, was omitted from the
statistical analyses.
Higher taxonomic levels analyses It was tested whether
distribution patterns of FA composition on the investigated strains delineate the three “super groups” of
eukaryotic algae, Plantae, Chromalveolates and Excavates (Euglenoids), and the cyanobacteria from each
other. The Plantae super group comprises exclusively
eukaryotes with plastids derived from primary endocytobiosis, i.e. a cyanobacterium was transformed into an
organelle through uptake and retention by the host cell
followed by the loss of much of its genome [26]. Chromalveolate algae as well as the Euglenoids (the only
algal lineage of Excavates) acquired their plastids
through secondary endocytobiosis from rhodophyte and
a green alga, respectively [26,27]. To consider almost

Lang et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:124
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/124

equal numbers of strains for all four groups, 100 strains
of Plantae, Chromalveolates and Cyanobacteria were
randomly selected which closely amounts the total number of considered euglenoid strains (73). The ordination
which resulted from CVA (Canonical Variates Analysis,
multigroup discriminant analysis) pointed out a strong
difference between cyanobacteria/primary endocytobiosis
(Plantae) and the two groups representing secondary
endocytobiosis (Chromalveolates/Euglenoids) (Figure 2).
The observed difference was without exception

Page 8 of 16

supported by non-parametric significance tests for multidimensional data (NP-MANOVA and ANOSIM). Following SIMPER, the lowest observed dissimilarity
(63.55%) was between Cyanobacteria and Plantae, while
the highest (77.29%) was between Plantae and Chromalveolates. The first canonical variate (CV1) involved
99.99% of all possible differences among the four
groups, hence we examined for possible correlations
between this axis and FAs. Four FAs were significantly
and exclusively correlated with the first canonical variate

(CV1), i.e. 16:0 (rCV1 = -0.61/p < 0.001), 18:2(9Z, 12Z)
(rCV1 = -0.46/p < 0.001), 9-octadecanamid (rCV1 = 0.41/
p < 0.001), and 18:1(9Z) (rCV1 = -0.17/p = 0.001). In a
second analysis it was tested whether FA distribution
patterns distinguish phyla of the Plantae super group,
i.e. the two lineages of green algae, Chlorophyta and
Streptophyta [28,29], and the composite Rhodophyta/
Glaucophyta group. Because the latter was with 54
strains the smallest group, it was compared with equally

Page 9 of 16

large random samples from each the Chlorophyta and
Streptophyta (Table 3). The ordination diagram from a
CVA of the total of 162 investigated strains clearly separated the Rhodophyta/Glaucophyta group from both
green algal phyla (Figure 3). CV1 involved 79% of all possible differences and even CV2 was with 21% not negligible. The significance tests, NP-MANOVA and ANOSIM,
supported the distinction of all three groups. SIMPER
showed the Rhodophyta/Glaucophyta composite group

rather dissimilar from both green algal phyla, i.e. there
were dissimilarities of 70.55% and 71.53% with the Chlorophyta and Streptophyta, respectively. The lowest dissimilarity (55.41%) among the three tested groups was
between Chlorophyta and Streptophyta. There were five
FAs significantly and exclusively correlated with CV1, i.e.
18:3(9Z, 12Z, 15Z) (rCV1 = 0.77/p < 0.001), 20:4 (rCV1 =
-0.49/p < 0.001), 20:5(5Z, 8Z, 11Z, 14Z, 17Z) (r CV1 =
-0.59/p < 0.001), 18:1(9Z) (rCV1 = 0.30/p = 0.001) and
16:0 (rCV1 = -0.56/p = 0, 001). Two FAs were correlated
exclusively with CV2, i.e. they discriminated Chlorophyta
and Streptophyta, 18:1(9Z) (rCV2 = -0.4477/p < 0.001)
and 9-octadecanamid (rCV2 = 0.34/p < 0.001). The by far
largest fraction of all considered strains (60.3%) were
from the Chlorophyta which made it interesting to test
whether FA distribution patterns can discriminate
between the three classes of Chlorophyta, the Chlorophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae and Ulvophyceae. Ulvophyceae
was the smallest of the three with just 49 strains and,
therefore, random samples of almost the same size (54)
from each of the other two classes were used for the statistical analyses. The CVA did not reveal any distinct
groups, i.e. the analyzed strains tended to form three
groups corresponding to the three green algal classes, but
with a considerable overlap among them (Figure 4).
However, the three classes were found significantly distinct from each other in both employed significance tests
and SIMPER. The latter and correlation analyses allowed
to consider 9-octadecanamid (r CV1 = -0.58/p < 0.001;
rCV2 = -0.22/p < 0.010) and the FA 18:2(9Z, 12Z) (rCV1 =
-0.44/p < 0.001; rCV2 = -0.53/p < 0.001) as the only variables to discriminate well Ulvophyceae from Chlorophyceae/Trebouxiophyceae and Trebouxiophyceae from
Ulvophyceae/Chlorophyceae, respectively.
Generic level analyses The three previous analyses
showed that phylogenetic relationships at the level of
phyla and classes among algal groups were reflected in FA
distribution patterns using a large sample of strains.
Therefore, in a second group of analyses, we tested
whether differences in FA distribution patterns may
resolve the same distinction of genera as in rRNA gene
sequence analyses. To test this, we selected three genera
which are widely used in biotechnological applications and
well represented by SAG strains, i.e. Chlorella s.l., Scenedesmus s.l. and Chlamydomonas s.l.. Recent18S rRNA
gene sequence analyses revealed each of the three as paraor polyphyletic assemblages encompassing several distinct
genera. For Chlamydomonas we selected 17 species
(53 strains), out of which 9 were represented by multiple
strains (e.g., C. reinhardtii, 16), which were distributed on
five independent lineages/clades (= genera) in the 18S
rDNA phylogeny [30]. To better represent the “Oogamochlamys“ clade also two strains from the UTEX collection

Page 10 of 16

(2213, 1753) were included. The NMDS ordination clearly
separated the members of the “Reinhardtii“ clade (upper
right in Figure 5), except for three strains, from those of
the “Chloromonas“ clade (lower left in Figure 5). However,
the “Chloromonas“ group as revealed by the FA patterns
also included the three investigated strains of the “Moewusii“ and four of the “Oogamochlamys“ clades which was in
contrast to the 18S rDNA phylogenies of [30]. Also in
contrast to the rDNA phylogenies, the FA analyses split
the genus Lobochlamys, i.e. L. culleus was part of the
“Chloromonas“ group while L. segnis belonged to the
“Reinhardtii“ group. Strains of Oogamochlamys were also
separated on both FA groups, in contrast to their species
assignments as based on the 18S rDNA analyses.
Species and strains formerly assigned to a single genus
Scenedesmus were shown to be actually distributed on several genera by rRNA gene sequence analyses. For example,
the genus Acutodesmus has been segregated from Scenedesmus [31,32]. A NMDS ordination plot of FA distribution patterns revealed a tendency among the studied
strains to be distributed on two clusters, i.e. one cluster of
8 strains of Acutodesmus (mainly including multiple
strains of A. obliquus) was clearly separated from another
cluster containing mainly strains of Scenedesmus s.str.
(Figure 6). The multiple strains of S. vacuolatus were
grouped together with four other strains of the genus,
except for SAG 211-11n which was close to the Acutodesmus cluster. The multiple strains of A. obliquus, however,
were distributed on both clusters (Figure 6). Seven strains
of A. obliquus mainly formed up the Acutodesmus cluster,
whereas five other A. obliquus strains grouped together
with strains of Scenedesmus s.str. This means that within
the same green algal species, A. obliquus, two distinct FA
patterns exist. AFLP fingerprints already showed extensive
genetic variation among the multiple strains of A. obliquus
while ITS2 rDNA sequence comparisons demonstrated
conspecificity of the multiple strains, except for SAG 27620 (T. Friedl, unpubl. observation). Therefore, the finding
of A. obliquus strains being separated in two FA pattern
groups favours the view that genetic differences resolved
by AFLPs may correspond to different phenotypic properties. Consequently, it may be crucial to carefully record
which strain has been used in any application [33].
Though strain SAG 276-20 was found not to belong to
the same species, A. obliquus, its FA pattern suggests that
it may still be a member of Acutodesmus because it was
grouped in the Acutodesmus cluster (Figure 6).
Chlorella vulgaris forms another example where extensive genetic variation among multiple strains of the same
species has been detected by AFLP analyses [33]. The 15
multiple SAG strains of C. vulgaris were compared to 19
other Chlorella and Chlorella-like strains, i.e. their closest
relatives as seen in 18S rDNA phylogenies, C. sorokiniana

and C. lobophora, members of the Parachlorella clade
sensu [34] as well as more distantly related strains, i.e.
from the Watanabea and Prasiola clades sensu [35].
NMDS ordination based on FA distribution pattern
showed almost no variation within the multiple strains of
C. vulgaris and clustered them together, except for strain
SAG 211-1e (Figure 7). Another cluster distant from C.
vulgaris was formed by members of the Watanabeaclade, whereas Chlorella-like algae of the Prasiola-clade
were not clustered together.

Conclusion
The algae collection at the SAG represents a valuable
resource of natural products as shown in the present
study for FAs and other hydrophobic metabolites. Several general trends in FA distribution reflect phylogenetic relationships among phyla and classes as seen in
genomic and molecular phylogenies and this makes FA
distribution patterns an additional feature to define taxa
of higher rank in algae. However the FA profile alone
may be no useful marker to distinguish among different

genera and species. For this, the comparison of further
metabolites, like sterols, entire lipids and hydrocarbons
should be considered. Thus, PUFA contents in microalgae are rather difficult to predict at the levels of genera
and species, making it difficult to select appropriate
strains for biotechnological research/applications which
aim at yielding high lipid contents. Therefore, each additional or novel isolate will be worth of examination for
its PUFA content.

Methods
Preparation of microalgal cultures

The microalgal cells were harvested from cultures at the
stationary phase and stored at -20°C. Stationary phase
was reached after different periods of culturing ranging
from three months to about one year, depending on the
strain-specific SAG’s standard maintenance protocols.
Before FA extraction the algal material was lyophilised
for two days until the cell pellets were totally dry.

Alkaline hydrolysis, transesterification and extraction of
FA methyl esters (FAMEs)

Prior to FAME extraction the dry weight of lyophilised
algal material was determined and then the samples were
transferred into a 2 ml tube. The samples were extracted
by adding 405 μl of methanol/toluol 2:1 (v/v) followed by
homogenisation of the cells with a potter (Heidolph RZR
2020, Schwabach) for 30 s. To avoid autoxidation, the
samples were overlaid with argon. As internal standard,
10 μg of tripentadecanoate (diluted in 10 μl toluol) was
added. Transesterification of lipid bound FAs to their

corresponding FAMEs was accomplished by adding
150 μl sodium methoxide [36]. After 20 min shaking at
RT the FAMEs were extracted two times with 500 μl nhexane and 500 μl 1 M NaCl. The hexane phases were
transferred into a 1.5 ml tube and dried under streaming
nitrogen. Finally the FAMEs were redissolved in 10 μl
acetonitrile and analysed by GC.
Preparation of 4, 4-dimethyloxaline (DMOX) derivatives

The position of double bonds of unknown FAME isomers was determined by analysing the corresponding

DMOX derivatives to allow identification by MS [37].
FAMEs were prepared as described, but the hexane
phases were transferred into a 1.5 ml glass tube. Samples were dried under streaming nitrogen and 200 μl 2alkenyl-4, 4-dimethyloxazoline (Sigma, München) were
added. After incubation at 180°C over night in a heating
block, the samples were cooled to RT and transferred
with 2 ml dichloromethane into a 12 ml glass tube and
reextracted with 5 ml hexane and 2 ml water. The hexane phase was dried under streaming nitrogen and

redissolved with 50 μl chloroform. The DMOX derivatives were separated on a 20 cm × 20 cm silica gel 60
TLC plate (Merck) with petrol ether/diethyl ether 2:1
(v/v) as a developing solvent. The plate was sprayed
with 0.2% 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulfonic acid to
visualize the DMOX derivatives under UV-light. The
blue/yellow band of the DMOX derivatives was scraped
out and the derivatives extracted by consecutive addition
of 0.4 ml water, 2 ml methanol, 2 ml chloroform and 2
ml saturated NaCl solution. Between each step the

Lang et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:124

sample was vigorously mixed and finally centrifuged for
5 min at 3220 × g to separate phases. The lower phase
was transferred into a new glass tube and dried under
nitrogen stream, redissolved in 10 μl acetonitrile and
analysed with GC/MS.
Identification of FAMEs by GC with flame ionisation
detection (FID)

The prepared FAMEs were analysed by GC/FID using a
capillary DB-23 column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm coating thickness, J&W, Scientific, Agilent, Waldbronn)
according to Hornung et al. (2002). Helium was used as
carrier gas with a flow of 0.1 ml/min. The temperature
gradient was 150°C for 1 min, 150-200°C at 4 K/min, 200250°C at 5 K/min and 250°C for 6 min. Tripentadecanoate
was added to each sample for quantification and the
FAMEs were identified according to the retention time of
the corresponding peaks in the standard “F.A.M.E. Mix
C4-C24” (Sigma, München), which was injected before
every 50th run. The injection volume depended on the
concentration of FAMEs within in the sample.
Identification of FAMEs by GC/MS

FID signals which were not identified by their retention
times on GC and either represented FAMEs or other
unpolar substances were further analysed by their mass
spectra using a 6890 Gas Chromatograph/5973 Mass
Selective Detector system (Agilent, Waldbronn). The
GC/MS conditions were the same as for GC-analysis.
The electron energy was 70 eV, the ion source temperature 230°C, and the temperature for the transfer line
added up to 260°C. The identification of unknown substances was done by comparison of the obtained mass
spectra with the mass spectra library NIST98 and the
“Lipid Library” of the Scottish Crop Science research
Institute http://www.lipidlibrary.co.uk/index.html.
Analysis of FAMEs

All chromatograms of the microalgal samples were analysed by using the ChemStation software version 9.03
(Agilent, Waldbronn). All peaks spanning a peak area of
more than 50 units were integrated. The amount of each
FAME was calculated using a defined amount (1 μg) of
the internal standard tripentadecanoate and the dry weight
(DW) of each sample: area of peak × 1 μg/area of tripentadecanoate/mg d.w = μg FAME/mg DW
Statistical analyses of FA distribution patterns

For each detected fatty acid (FA) its percentage of the
total FA content of a strain was used as variable. For the
investigation of the general structure of the data sets,
common indirect ordination techniques were used, i.e.
Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Correspondence
and Detrended Correspondence Analysis, and Non-

Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS). The significance of the differences among a priori predefined algal
groups were tested using non-parametric multidimensional significance tests (Non-Parametric Multivariate
Analysis of Variance, Analysis of Similarity) and visualised as ordinations from multigroup discriminant analysis (Canonical Variates Analysis). The percentages of
dissimilarity between group pairs were investigated conducting SIMPER analysis. To link the significant differences among algal groups with particular variables/fatty
acids possibly contributing to the observed difference,
correlation analyses were conducted (Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficient, r/rho), permutation significance
tests). All statistical analyses and graphical visualisations
have been conducted in PAST version 2.07 software
package. Final graphical attributes required for publication were adapted in vector graphics editor Inkscape version 4.7 and CorelDraw X3 Graphic suite.
