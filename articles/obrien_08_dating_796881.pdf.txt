Abstract
Precise dating of viral subtype divergence enables researchers to correlate divergence with
geographic and demographic occurrences. When historical data are absent (that is, the
overwhelming majority), viral sequence sampling on a time scale commensurate with the rate of
substitution permits the inference of the times of subtype divergence. Currently, researchers use
two strategies to approach this task, both requiring strong conditions on the molecular clock
assumption of substitution rate. As the underlying structure of the substitution rate process at the
time of subtype divergence is not understood and likely highly variable, we present a simple method
that estimates rates of substitution, and from there, times of divergence, without use of an assumed
molecular clock. We accomplish this by blending estimates of the substitution rate for triplets of
dated sequences where each sequence draws from a distinct viral subtype, providing a zerothorder approximation for the rate between subtypes. As an example, we calculate the time of
divergence for three genes among influenza subtypes A-H3N2 and B using subtype C as an
outgroup. We show a time of divergence approximately 100 years ago, substantially more recent
than previous estimates which range from 250 to 3800 years ago.

Background
Precise estimates are sorely lacking for dating the emergence and divergence of viral subtypes. Improved estimates equip epidemiologists and virologists to begin to
correlate these important establishing events with historical demographic changes, geographical invasions and
zoonoses, the transferring of a virus from one host species
to another [7,1,25]. For example, archeological sequence
data can furnish accurate dates and show that substantial
genomic changes associate with geographical invasion
and zoonosis [14,17]. Further, the recent availability of
viral gene sequences sampled at a pace commensurate
with their rate of nucleotide substitution vastly augments
the ability to rigorously infer the time scale of phylogenies

and hence determine the time of the most recent common
ancestor (TMRCA) for different viral types [18,26,6].
Systematic studies characterize the substitution process
and substitution rate process of several classes of viral subtypes in, for example, Dengue, influenza subtype A,
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the virus
responsible for sudden acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS). For the last three viruses, a unique zoonotic transfer appears to co-occur with substantial changes in both
the composition of nucleotides and amino acids as well as
alterations in the rate of nucleotide substitution [15,14,1].
In Dengue, where a single subtype simultaneously inhabits two hosts (humans and Aedes aegypti) in a persistent

zoonotic process, the introduction of the virus to new geographical environments associates with a dramatic
increase in sequence diversity [25]. Unfortunately, no
studies thus far analyze the rate of nucleotide substitution
during either geographical invasion or zoonosis. Consequently, studies of the date of origins of viral subtypes
must use strong a priori assumptions on the rate structure
of nucleotide substitution.
Two primary methods find use to date the time of viral
subtype divergence. The most commonly employed
approach determines the divergence time of subtypes
using a molecular clock assumption (MCA) over an entire
phylogeny [18,21,5,26]. In its strict formulation, the MCA
posits a proportional relation between the number of substitutions and the intervening time period over the entire
phylogeny. Looser forms of MCAs require only that the
proportionality hold along individual branches, with the
rates across branches drawn from a pre-specified distribution [5]. Committed to some variant of the MCA, current
algorithms then estimate the rate of nucleotide substitution over all taxa in a given set. Consequently, these methods provide inference most suitable for situations where
sequence evolution follows a MCA (e.g. influenza AH3N2 in human hosts, as in [9]) or deviates from the
MCA homogenously in time (e.g. perhaps influenza A in
wild fowl, see [3]). In considering divergence events
between viral subtypes, even when the MCA well-approximates nucleotide substitution within a given subtype, the
above methods may incorrectly infer the time of divergence across subtypes. By either assuming that a single
rate of nucleotide substitution holds for the region preceding the common ancestor of each subtype or by
smoothing the rate of nucleotide substitution over clades
with different numbers of taxa, the adherence to a MCA
prevents direct inference of the rate during subtype divergence.
Suzuki and Nei (2002) propose an alternative, more heuristic method of estimation to counteract the problem of
differing rates of substitution before and after zoonotic
events [23,25]. In these studies, the evolutionary models
draw a distinction between the rate of substitution within
a given subtype and the rate of substitution between subtypes. However, trouble arises since there are no methods
for estimating the latter quantity. Consequently, the models assume that the rate of substitution for portions of the
phylogeny between the subtypes equals the mean rate in
the initial host species population. For instance, in dating
the time of divergence between influenza B hemagglutinin and influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase, Suzuki and
Nei use the rate of amino acid substitution for water fowl
for the portions of the phylogeny previous to the TMRCA
of these two proteins [23]. While this method may accurately reflect the rate within avian and human hosts, it

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/172

neglects whatever additional changes in the rate of substitution are due to the process of zoonotic adaptation, likely
leading to a substantial underestimation of the date of the
TMRCA.
The study here focuses on influenza, although the techniques are readily applied to other rapidly evolving organisms. Influenza has three types, A, B and C, classified
based on serological analysis. To date, only type A
sequences have been demonstrably associated with global
pandemics [4]. Since modern surveillance began in the
1930s, type B has only been responsible for mild epidemics while type C has been nearly asymptomatic in human
infection. Several subtypes of A, notably H1N1 and
H3N2, are currently co-circulating in the human population. As the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes may be as divergent from each other as they are from types B and C, we
will refer to all types and subtypes simply as subtypes for
the remainder of this paper. We select for this study three
genes, coding for hemagglutinin (HA), the matrix protein
(MP) and the non-structural protein (NS) responsible for
interfering with host immune response. Subtype C has a
hemagglutinin-esterase gene that is analogous to the
hemagglutin gene in other subtypes [1]. We hence refer to
the hemagglutinin gene generally and the hemagglutininesterase gene when referring specifically to the subtype C
sequences.
We present a simple estimation tool to determine the date
of divergence among viral subtypes that overcomes the
difficulties encountered with use of the MCA by measuring the pairwise rate of substitution between taxa. Our
estimator derives from the triplet statistic developed in
[26,22,13], where each sequence member of the triplet
draws from a different subtype. In this manner, we generate from each triplet an estimate of the rate of nucleotide
substitution between the most recently diverged subtypes,
and consequently provide an estimate of the TMRCA. This
circumvents the problems posed by earlier methods by
directly estimating the pairwise rate of nucleotide substitution over the set of pairs of sequences straddling the
subtype divergence without any further rate assumptions
other than the existence of a mean. However, this method
is only capable of determining the rate between two subtypes where a third, more distantly related, subtype functions as an outgroup. This method thus trades the ad hoc
rate assumptions of the previous methods with two
implicit conditions: (i) that subtypes have a unique divergence and (ii) a third, comparable subtype is available to
serve as an outgroup. In exchange, we arrive at a precise
statistical measure of the TMRCA that converges as the
number of taxa increases and is robust to the balancing of
the numbers of taxa between different subtypes. We show
that applying this method to dating the divergence of
influenza subtypes A-H3N2 and B gives a time of diver-

Methods
To calculate the rate of nucleotide substitution, we require
a measurement of the number of nucleotide substitutions
occurring in a given time interval. Starting from a given set
of aligned sequences {s1, ..., sn} for n taxa, we define the
pairwise distance in number of substitutions to be the
estimates {Kij} under a given model of nucleotide substitution. Naturally the unobservable true values {Dij} of the
pairwise distances differ from their estimates {Kij}. To
understand this difference, we associate each Dij with an
error Îµij and assume that Îµij tends to zero as sequence
lengths increase without bound. We further assume that
the covariance between errors, cov(Îµij; Îµmn), is bounded
and known. For time measurements, we assume that each
sequence is labeled by a sampling time ti given in consistent units. Since we know only the sampling time of a
given sample up to the unit of time reported (day, month,
year) we posit an uniform error Î½i ~ U [0, 1] underlying
each ti over the unit sampling interval. To complete the
error structure specification we force the two forms of
error (Î½i and Îµij) to be independent. Finally, for a set of
three sequences (si, sj, sk) and their associated pairwise distances, we enforce a fixed topology among sequences, as
shown in Figure 1, via methods outlined in [26]. We augment the topology with the observed sampling times of
the three sequences, Î±, the divergence time between the
two sequences of interest and Î², the divergence time of all
sequences. When necessary for clarity, we write Î±ij to indicate the true time of divergence between sequences i and j.
Under our triplet method, we aim to estimate the true rate
of nucleotide substitution, pij, between sequences si and sj

Ë(
p ijk) to denote its weak dependence on outgroup
sequence k. Dependence is weak as the path of evolution
from tk to Î± is shared between the paths from sequence k
to both sequence i and sequence j and hence largely cancels out in Equation 1. We make this transparent in the
following derivation. For brevity, we consider only unobservable true values, ignoring error terms. Let u be the
location on the triplet in Figure 1 corresponding to time Î±
and let pxy be the true rate along the path connecting locations x and y. Then, as distance is rate multiplied by time,
we have

D ik = p ij (Î± â t i ) + p ku (Î² â t k + Î² â Î± )
D jk = p ij (Î± â t j ) + p ku (Î² â t k + Î² â Î± ).
Subtracting the first equation from the second equation
yields Dik - Djk = pij(tj - ti), which is equivalent to Equation
1. This derivation makes clear that the estimator (1) measures the rate along the path from sequence i to sequence j,
with only incidental dependence on sequence k.

We demonstrate the advantage of our triplet estimator
through analysis of influenza A-H3N2/B subtype divergence using the hemagglutinin (HA), matrix protein (MP)
and non-structural (NS) genes. Each analysis is performed
on 60 gene sequences constructed from 20 genomes each
drawn from influenza subtypes A-H3N2, B and C. We
download these data along with their dates of sampling
from the Los Alamos Influenza Database [16]. We perform sequence alignment using ClustalX [24, version 1.8].
For consistency with previous studies of A-H3N2 HA evolution, we use the HKY model of nucleotide substitution
[10]. We use the TREBLE algorithm, which implements a
MCA, on sets of sequences solely drawn from a single subtype to derive within-subtype rates. The phylogenetic tree,
generated by TREBLE, for the HA gene is depicted in Figure 2(a). We infer similar trees for the MP and NS genes.
We calculate variances for both MCA and pairwise rate
estimates using 200 bootstrap iterates. All dates are listed
as years in the common era.
Consistent with previous studies [1-3], rates vary substantially both among genes and among subtypes. We record
rates as a point estimate (Â± standard error). For the HA
gene, subtype A-H3N2 shows a rate of nucleotide substitution of 3.21 (Â± 0.43) Ã 10-3s/s/yr. This rate is slightly
lower than those recorded in previous studies although
within the margin of error [26]. For subtype B, the rate of
nucleotide substitution is 2.31 (Â± 0.37) Ã 10-3s/s/yr,
which is higher than previous estimates although also
within the margin of error [23], and for subtype C, the rate
is 0.68 (Â± 0.18) Ã 10-3s/s/yr. For the MP gene, rates are
generally lower than those for HA. The subtype A-H3N2
rate is 1.57 (Â± 0.38) Ã 10-4s/s/yr. The subtype B rate is 2.20

similar to those of the MP gene. The subtype A-H3N2 rate
is 2.14 (Â± 0.25) Ã 10-3s/s/yr, the subtype B rate is 1.92 (Â±
0.20) Ã 10-3s/s/yr, and the subtype C rate is 1.68 (Â± 0.51)
Ã 10-3s/s/yr. Table 1 presents these results. Figure 3 provides histograms of the bootstrap distributions for all
three genes and subtypes.
Assuming a molecular clock within a subtype and with the
rates above, we generated the corresponding dates of the
TMCRA. Figure 3 shows histograms of the TMRCA estimates for different genes and subtypes. All genes are similar in dating the TMRCA for A-H3N2 to approximately
1965 (1964, 1965, and 1962 for HA, MP and NS genes,
respectively). These dates are consistent with the emergence of the A-H3N2 subtype into global circulation durTable 1: Within-subtypes rates of nucleotide substitution for

ing the 1968 pandemic [1]. Both the MP and NS genes
date the TMRCA of subtype B to 1943, while the HA rate
places the TMRCA at 1953. This latter value is inconsistent
with the influenza B sub-epidemics of 1950â51 but is
consistent with the emergence of the more lethal Victoria
strain of influenza B in 1953 [11]. Each of these estimates
has a standard error of approximately 2 years and so these
discrepancies may be accounted by measurement uncertainty. The 10 year gap between the TMCRA suggested by
the different genes can be explained by a reassortment
event. Finally, the TMRCA of subtype C is calculated as
1952 and 1953 by the MP and NS genes, respectively,
while the HA gene places the TMCRA at 1906. This nearly
half century discrepancy suggests that the subtype C HA
gene experienced a markedly different evolutionary history than either the MP or the NS gene. A biologically
plausible explanation would be a reassortment event.
Another possible explanation is that non-MCA rate behavior has lead to substantial bias in dating the TMRCA.
We now compare the results from pairwise rate estimates
across subtypes A-H3N2 and B with those from application of the MCA to the same data. These results are summarized in Table 2 and Figure 4. Using the triplet method
developed above, data from the hemagglutinin gene

This discrepancy between the two sets of estimates of the
TMRCA likely owes to the inability of the MCA to integrate information from the period of evolution between
the two subtypes, leading to a substantial underestimate
of the rate of substitution, and consequent underestimation of the date of the TMRCA.

Discussion
We present a new method for ascertaining the rate of
nucleotide substitution between subtypes and apply this
method together with traditional MCA methods to date
the divergence of influenza subtypes A-H3N2, B, and C.
We use three genes, HA, MP and NS, to date two types of
divergence events: the time of the most recent common of
each subtype and the time of divergence between two subtypes, A-H3N2 and B. For the former event type, we show
that the three genes are loosely consistent in their dating
of the TMRCA of the subtypes, with the notable exception
of the HA-derived estimate of subtype C's TMRCA approximately 50 years before the MP- and NS-derived estimates.
This discrepancy may indicate either that subtype C's
hemagglutinin-esterase gene engaged in a biologically significant event, such as reassortment, or that MCA estimation does not adequately model the evolution of the gene.

divergence of several hundred years ago, ranging from the
16th to early 19th centuries. Other analysis have yielded
estimates of 3600 years ago [23]. In the current study,
application of the MCA yielded estimates in the last half
of the 18th century. However, applying the pairwise rate
estimate developed above we find uniformly, across
genes, that the divergence likely occurred in the very early
20th century. The discrepancy between these two measures is likely due to the increased modeling flexibility of
the pairwise rate estimate relative to the MCA.
This discrepancy between the rates and corresponding
TMCRA estimates has important biological consequence.
The phylogenetic divergence between subtype A-H3N2
and B corresponds to a subspeciation event for the virus.
The results in this study indicate that the process of speciation is not neutral but instead a period of rapid and
intense genetic change. The three genes studied here consistently show large acceleration in the rate of nucleotide
substitution for the divergence period relative to the rates
observed within a stable subtype. This study gives strong
evidence that, at least for influenza viral subtype divergence, the process of subspeciation is associated not just

Assuming that the more recent estimate is correct, a subsequent question is whether or not a pandemic or epidemic associates with subtype A-H3N2/B divergence. In
the twentieth century, all influenza pandemics associate
with the emergence or reemergence of subtypes (A-H1N1
in 1918, A-H2N2 in 1957 and A-H3N2 in 1968). Serological analysis indicates that the 1897 pandemic was likely
due to subtype A-H2N2. However, the pandemic of 1900
is of uncertain type, although it is commonly reported in
the literature as being due to A-H3N2 [4]. The above analysis suggests that it is possible to postulate that the cause
of this pandemic is due to the emergence of subtype AH3N2 or B.
As noted above, we condition the results presented here
on a specific sequence alignment. As the question under
consideration concerns the divergence of specific genes
and proteins over a (presumably) long time scale, the
capacity to generate reasonable alignments diminishes
with increasing time of divergence between types, conditional on the rate of substitution. We find that for the
hemagglutinin gene, a proportion of sequence alignments
support the split of subtype B from subtype C after the
split between subtypes A-H3N2 and B, in opposition to
the topology enforced in our analysis. Hence, to some
unknown degree, our analysis is necessarily biased by the
choice of alignment. This suggests that improved dating
can be found by integrating estimation procedures over an
ensemble of alignments [19].

divergence of rapidly evolving organisms without the pitfalls of the MCA.

Conclusion
We present a simple method for calculating the time of
viral subtype divergence that does not assume a molecular
clock over the entire phylogeny. Additionally, the estimator of this method, a weighted sum of pairwise estimates,
furnishes a defined variance for the time of the most common ancestor between subtypes. As a tradeoff for this
increased precision, the structure of the triplet statistic
requires an outgroup set of sequences, usually a closely
related subtype. We apply this estimator to the case of
influenza subtype divergence, considering three genes. We
show that the estimated divergence time of subtypes AH3N2 and B is more than a century later than those calculated with a molecular clock.

Appendix
(
Initially, one might define an estimator p ijk) of the condi(
tional pairwise rate p ijk) to be

The pairwise estimate method presented above is accurate
in the scale

T â n â p ~ O(1),
where T is the total time over the phylogeny and p is
mean rate over the phylogeny [26]. This relation dictates
that as divergence events become more remote the ability
of the triplet method to resolve the time of divergence
diminishes. While this limit prohibits the calculation of
remote divergence events, the example presented above
lies within the appropriate scale.
In place of a specific MCA, the estimates presented here
directly calculate the rate of substitutions between taxa
from different viral subtypes. As such estimates span paths
between subtypes, they simultaneously capture the rate
evolution along branches both within and between subtypes. From these estimates, we are able to directly infer
the time of divergence between subtypes. As a trade-off for
limited MCAs, the method requires an outgroup subtype
to function as an origin relative to the subtypes under consideration. We feel that the triplet method provides a simple and widely applicable way to calculate the dates of

p ijk) =

K ik â K jk
t i ât j

,

that has been previously used in the paper outlining the
TREBLE algorithm [26], and originates in [13]. However,
this apparently natural statistic is substantially biased
when the sampling times of sequences i and j are close. To
be seen in the following derivation, this bias is the result
of the time sampling error structure.
As the true value of the rate of substitution is given by
(
p ijk) =

D ik â D jk
t i âÎ½ i â t j +Î½ j

=

K ik âÎµ ik â K jk + Îµ jk
t i âÎ½ i â t j +Î½ j

,

we then have an expression for the error:
(
(
p ijk) â p ijk)

=
=

K ik â K jk
t i ât j

â

K ik âÎµ ik â K jk + Îµ jk
t i +Î½ i â t j âÎ½ j

(Î½ i âÎ½ j )(K ik â K jk )â(t i â T j )(Îµ jk âÎµ ik )
(t i â t j )(t i âÎ½ i â t j +Î½ j )

.

Taking the expectation yields the bias:

We note that as the sampling time is independent of the
rate of nucleotide substitution, the error increases in proportion to the magnitude of the initial statistic. We can
then create a new, unbiased statistic by counterbalancing
the original statistic with this factor, making a new statistic
