Background
Mean shift, an iterative technique for identifying the
local maxima of a probability density function, has been
successfully used as a clustering method in computer
vision and image processing. We apply the mean shift
technique to the high dimensional space of phylogeny
trees. The basic idea behind this technique is to, given a
set of sample points, shift each point in the direction of
the gradient of the underlying density function in an
iterative manner until the points concentrate at the local
maxima of the density function and form natural clusters [1]. We have developed software named MSCTrees
based on a variant of the mean shift method, called the
adaptive mean shift [2], to perform cluster analysis on a
set of multidimensional data points corresponding to
phylogenetic trees.
Methods
MSCTrees has two components: a C program called
ms_cluster which implements a clustering algorithm
based on the adaptive mean shift method, and a Perl
script called cluster_trees.pl, which converts phylogenetic
trees to multidimensional data points and calls ms_cluster to perform cluster analysis on the resulting points.
The ms_cluster program, developed in C for optimized
performance, takes a set of multidimensional data points
as input, and outputs the clusters of the input points
together with the cluster centers. The ms_cluster performs the following steps: 1) calculate the adaptive
bandwidth for each data point using the k-Nearest
Neighbor (kNN) method; 2) initialize a set of points
using the values of the original data points; 3) shift the
set of initialized points to new locations based on the
mean shift vectors computed at each point; 4) repeat
1

step (3) until all points have converged; 5) merge points
that have converged to the same locations into clusters.
Four auto-optimized (and user-definable) parameters
have been implemented to control the mean shift clustering process.
The cluster_trees.pl script uses the BioPerl modules to
parse a set of phylogenetic trees as the input. It maps a
phylogenetic tree to a multidimensional data point by
calculating the pair-wise distances between the leaves of
the tree as the dimensional values of the resulting point.
The script produces as output clusters of phylogenetic
trees resulting from the clustering of their corresponding data points.

Results and conclusion
We tested MSCTrees with a well-known gopher-louse
data set, which contains two sets of phylogenetic trees
(101 trees each) for 15 species of gophers and 15 species
of lice, respectively. Separate cluster analyses were performed on the two sets of trees, followed by a cluster
analysis on the combined tree sets. A significantly
reduced number of clusters was obtained on the combined data, which suggests similarity between the two
tree distributions and is consistent with the known coevolutionary relationship between gophers and lice. The
pilot results demonstrate that the MSCTrees tool has
strong potential for effective high dimensional cluster
analysis of phylogenetic trees. We are also investigating
other phylogenetic applications, such as identifying gene
transfers via outlier detection.
