Enterococcus faecalis among layer chickens during
hatch

Abstract
Background: Studies on transmission of Enterococcus faecalis among chickens during hatch have not been carried
out so far. Information about vertical transmission and subsequent spreading and colonization of the cloacal
mucosa through cloacal ‘drinking’ during hatch are important to understand the epidemiology of E. faecalis
infections. In the present investigation vertical transmission and subsequent spreading and colonization of the
cloacal mucosa of chickens by E. faecalis through cloacal ‘drinking’ were examined.
Methods: Two different batches of layer chickens originating from 45 weeks old Brown and White Lohmann
parents, respectively from the same farm were sampled in the hatcher. Isolates were confirmed to be E. faecalis by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and further by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to state their population
structure and comparison made to sequence types previously obtained from chicken.
Results: A total of 480 chickens were swabbed from the cloacae just after hatch and after 24 hours. A total of 101
isolates were confirmed as E. faecalis by a species specific PCR. The prevalence of E. faecalis increased from 14% at
0 h to 97% after 24 h for the Brown Lohmann chickens and from 0.5% to 23% for the White Lohmann flock. The
84 isolates analysed by MLST were distributed on 14 sequence types (ST). Three ST (401, 82 and 249) accounted for
64% of all isolates analysed by MLST after 24 h. ST 82 has previously been reported from amyloid arthropathy and
other lesions in poultry.
Conclusions: The present findings demonstrated a high potential of a few contaminated eggs or embryos to
rapidly facilitate the spread of E. faecalis to almost all chickens during hatch.

Background
Enterococcus faecalis is part of the normal intestinal
microbial flora of poultry and man [1]. Under most conditions, E. faecalis is considered as an opportunistic
pathogen. In humans, E. faecalis represents one of the
most important causes of nosocomial infections [2].
Clinical conditions observed in poultry include growth
depression [3], pulmonary hypertension syndrome [4],
and amyloid arthropathy [5] in addition to first week
mortality [6]. In broiler parents, 12 different sequence
types (STs) were reported from valvular endocarditis,
septicaemia, salpingitis, peritonitis, arthritis and combinations of some of these conditions [6]. A specific clone

of E. faecalis has been associated with amyloid arthropathy [7] and was subsequently identified as ST 82 [8].
However, most STs of E. faecalis seem to have the
potential to induce amyloidosis and chronic infections
characteristic for E. faecalis seem essential for developing amyloidosis [6]. Unfortunately, knowledge on epidemiology and pathogenesis of E. faecalis infections in
poultry has remained fragmentary. This has limited
implementation of preventive strategies despite of recent
observations suggesting that E. faecalis represents a new
zoonosis [9].
Several experimental investigations have been
employed to demonstrate possible routes of transmission of E. faecalis among chickens [10-13]. To the
knowledge of the authors, studies on transmission of E.
faecalis among chicks during hatch have not been carried out so far. For the same reason, vertical

transmission and subsequent spreading and colonization
of the cloacal mucosa of chickens through cloacal
‘drinking’ were examined during hatch. In addition, isolates of E. faecalis were sequence typed and compared
with STs previously obtained from clinical conditions in
poultry.

Methods
Flock data

Two studies were carried out on clinically healthy chicks
from a Danish hatchery. Chickens investigated originated from two Brown and White Lohmann breeder
flocks from the same farm, aged 45 weeks (Table 1).
Upon arrival at the hatchery, all eggs were formalin
fumigated before incubation. Hatching started on day 20
of incubation. Two hatchers, each of which contained
8,000 eggs, were randomly selected on day 20 (time 0 h)
just as newly hatched chickens were randomly selected
from trays covering the whole hatcher (Table 1). The
same procedure was applied for selection of chickens on
day 21 of incubation (time 24 h) (Table 1). Due to an
expected lower prevalence of E. faecalis a higher number of chickens was swabbed on day 20.
Sampling and bacterial isolation

A total of 300 newly hatched chicks were sampled at 0 h
while 180 chickens were sampled at 24 h. A cloacal
swab sample from each chick investigated was collected
with a sterile cotton wool swab rotated in contact with
the cloacal mucosa. The swab was plated onto a blood
agar plate (BA, Blood Agar Base, CM55, Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) with 5% sterile calf blood. The same swab
was subsequently used to inoculate a 0.01% potassium
tellurite agar plate (Merck, Whitehouse Station, USA).
All agar plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h after
which the qualitative composition of the microflora on
BA was evaluated based upon colony morphology. From
plates demonstrating colonies characteristic of E. faecalis
a single colony was subcultured and stored at -80°C in
hearth infusion broth (HIB, Difco, Brøndby, Denmark)
added 15% glycerol. In addition, randomly selected isolates with colonies typical of Staphylococcus hyicus were
subjected 16S rRNA gene sequencing for verification.

Analysis of E. faecalis

Boiling lysates from all isolates were used in an initial E.
faecalis specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifying the ddlE. faecalis of 941 base pairs by means of the
primers E 1 5’-ATCAAGTACAGTTAGTCTT-3’ (TAG
Copenhagen, Denmark) and E2 5’-ACGATTCAAAGCTAACTG-3’ (TAG Copenhagen) [14]. Volumes of 50 μl
were set up under the following PCR-conditions: 94°C
for 2 min of initial denaturation, 30 cycles of 94°C for 1
min of denaturation, 54°C for 1 min of annealing and
72°C for 1 min of amplification; followed by a final
extension of 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were run in
a 1% agarose gel (Lonza, Rockland ME, USA) and
stained with ethidium bromide (0.07%, Sigma).
Eighty four isolates identified as E. faecalis in the specific PCR were further characterized by a combination
of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) method
[15] specific for ST 82 of E. faecalis and multilocus
sequence typing (MLST). The 84 isolates represented all
four samplings (Table 1). Unfortunately 17 out of 101
isolates identified as E. faecalis by PCR were not available for investigation. They represented four samples
from 0 h and 13 from 24 h sampling times of the
Brown Lohmann chickens with similar properties to isolates investigated so that their loss did not bias the
investigation. For both methods DNA was first purified
according to the manufacturer’s instructions for DNA
purification of Gram positive bacteria (DNeasy Blood &
Tissue Kit from Quiagen, Hilden, Germany). Extracted
DNA was run in a Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) for SNP
screening for the clone ST 82 of E. faecalis [15]. Six primers were used to amplify one out of two possible allelic sequences in each of the two genes, pstS and xpt
[15]. Reactions were setup in volumes of 25 μl and run
in a MxPro3000 (Strategene) using the following PCR
conditions: 95°C for 10 min of initial denaturation, and
40 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec of denaturation, 58°C for 1
min of annealing, 72°C for 15 sec of elongation and terminated by 1 cycle of dissociation analysis consisting of
95°C for 1 min of denaturation, 55°C for 30 sec of
annealing and 95°C for 30 sec of denaturation [15].
Isolates not identified as ST 82 and eight isolates found
positive by the RT-PCR (controls) were analysed by MLST

by amplifying fragments of seven housekeeping genes. Primers and PCR conditions used were performed as stated
on the MLST homepage for E. faecalis [16,17]. Amplified
products were purified and sequenced by Macrogen
(Seoul, Korea). Products were sequenced in both directions and compared with published alleles using the computer program CLC bio (Aarhus, Denmark). Based on the
seven allelic numbers, a ST was assigned to each isolate.
To analyse the evolutionary relationships between STs
on sequence level, the seven sequences for the alleles of
each ST were concatenated and a multiple alignment
created by ClustalX [18]. In the same program neighbor
joining analysis was carried out, and the phylogenetic
tree was constructed from MEGA4 [19]. 16S rRNA gene
sequencing of two isolates was performed according to
previous reports [20,21]. The isolates were selected to
represent a haemolytic and non-haemolytic variant of
the most frequent colony morphology not representing
Escherichia coli and E. faecalis and found negative in
the E. faecalis species specific PCR.

Results
One hundred and one isolates were identified as E. faecalis by the species specific PCR (Table 1). The prevalence

increased from 14% at 0 h to 97% after 24 h among
chickens originating from Lohmann Brown breeders
while the prevalence increased from 0.5% to 23% among
offspring from Lohmann White layers after 24 h. On
both occasions, the increase was significant (Table 1).
Fourteen STs were detected by MLST (Table 2).
Detection of ST 82 by RT-PCR was confirmed by MLST
for all control isolates. As to chickens originating from
the Lohmann Brown flock, the number of STs increased
from four at time 0 to nine after 24 h, while the same
figures for the Lohmann White were one and eight,
respectively (Table 2). The genetic diversity did not
change significantly from 0 to 24 h. Chickens originating
from the two different parent flocks only shared four
out the 14 STs (82, 249, 273, 314) although both flocks
originated from the same farm.
For Lohmann Brown, ST 82 increased from 5.0% to
23.3% during the 24 hours of hatch (Table 2). For ST 82
at 0 h, one of the five cultures demonstrated massive
growth in pure culture of E. faecalis, indicating vertical
transmission while four chickens demonstrated poor
growth of E. faecalis (Table 2). After 24 h only one out
of 14 isolates of ST 82 showed massive growth in pure
culture, whereas the rest were obtained from a mixed

culture of E. coli and E. faecalis. For ST 249 the same
tendency was observed as for ST 82: the prevalence
increased from 2.0% to 26.7% from 0 to 24 h. After 24 h
three out of 16 plates demonstrated massive growth in
pure culture of E. faecalis. For the other STs, most isolates after 24 h were obtained from plates with poor
growth or in mixed culture. For Lohmann White, only a
single isolate in mixed culture was found at 0 h. This isolate belonged to ST 177. After 24 h, most STs were
represented by isolates that were both obtained from
plates demonstrating either massive growth in pure culture or from plates with poor growth or in mixed culture.
The phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated sequences
showed the most distant relationship of ST 228 (Figure
1). ST 4 and ST 32 only diverged in one (pstS) of the
seven genes (99.9% DNA similarity) and ST 401 and ST
402 in another yqi (99.8% DNA similarity) whereas none
of the other STs were closely related (< 99.6% DNA similarity). Two isolates (4-19, 4-24) selected to represent
bacteria frequently isolated that did not belong to E. faecalis were 16S rRNA sequenced. They showed similarities of 99.7% and 99.6% to the type strain of S. hyicus,
respectively. This colony type was often observed in a
mixed microflora also including E. faecalis and E. coli. In
five cases, abundant growth in almost pure culture of S.
hyicus (more than 90% of colonies) was observed indicating vertical transmission of this bacterium.

Discussion
During the first three days of life, the intestine of chicks
becomes colonized with bacteria [22-24]. E. faecalis and

Enterococcus faecium constitute the enterococcal species
most commonly isolated from day-old chicks [24].
Although the enterococcal distribution changes with age
[24,25], E. faecalis has also been found in the intestine
of adult poultry [1]. The quality of day-old chickens
have major impact on first week mortality and we have
recently shown that E. coli and E. faecalis were the most
significant bacterial pathogens associated with first week
mortality [25].
Our results show that E. faecalis colonized the cloacal
mucosa of chickens during hatch. A significant increase
in the prevalence of E. faecalis of seven and 46 times
within the two flocks investigated, respectively, can be
explained as a result of horizontal transmission through
the oral route and by cloacal ‘drinking’ between chicks
in the hatcher. Both oral uptake and cloacal ‘drinking’
are likely routes for bacterial transmission in naive
chickens. The latter route was documented by van der
Sluis et al. [26], who showed that labelled material
taken up by the cloaca could later be found in the bursa
of Fabricius, caecum and small intestine of the same
chickens. Horizontal transfer of bacteria can occur by
contact between chickens, contact with contaminated
egg shells as well as air-borne transmission of bacteria
through hatchery fluff [23,27].
In the present investigation we have assumed that a
ST represents a clonal entity of E. faecalis in relation to
colonization and transmission. It is further assumed that
massive growth of E. faecalis in pure culture at 0 and 24
h represents vertical transmission from infected eggs.
Poor growth in pure culture of E. faecalis and poor/
good growth of E. faecalis on primary plates with other
bacteria at 0 and 24 h might originate from shells and
represent contaminated eggs or horizontal transmission
in the hatcher. For only one ST (314) with two isolates
observed at 0 h in Lohmann Brown, a vertical transmission was indicated while only five out of the 43 isolates
that were MLST typed at 24 h indicated vertical transmission. For the Lohmann White, a low prevalence at 0
h and lack of transmission of the same ST (177) after 24
h indicated low or no vertical transmission of this ST
while vertical transmission of 12 isolates were indicated
after 24 h. For isolates at 24 h, 23 and five isolates out
of the 73 belonged to ST 82 and ST 174, respectively.
These STs and ST 177 made up 81% of the isolates
associated with lesions in broiler breeders underlining
their disease potential which might have induced a late
hatch [6]. ST 177 was only detected once and only at 0
h in a mixed microflora indicating horizontal transmission or infection as a result of shell contamination. ST
32 has only rarely been isolated from lesions in broiler
breeders [6] while ST 149 has not previously been isolated from lesions in chickens but from human infections [16]. Seven of the 14 STs (4, 32, 82, 117, 141, 174,

Fertner et al. Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica 2011, 53:56

and 249) have previously been reported from poultry
whereas three STs (400, 401, and 402) were demonstrated for the first time. The three STs that demonstrated the highest prevalences were either unique to
this investigation (401), common in chicken (82) or
reported from chicken faeces in Norway (249) [16]. ST
82 has mainly been isolated from amyloid arthropathy
in layers [8] and from different lesions in broiler parent
breeders, including amyloidosis and arthritis [6]. This
ST has also been reported from human clinical source
[16].
Some 25% of the isolates demonstrated abundant
growth in pure culture supporting a genuine vertical
transmission of E. faecalis. Such route has previously
only been indicated to play a minor role during infection of chickens with the clone of E. faecalis involved in
amyloid arthropathy [11]. Whether this observation
represent both genuine vertical infections as a result of
in ovo infection or shell contamination from the cloacal
mucosa of the hen or environment and subsequent shell
penetration remains to be investigated. Chickens
hatched from eggs dipped in fluid with salmonella solution were found to transfer salmonella to the gut of 44%
of chickens hatched from salmonella free eggs [23].
Similar data are not available for E. faecalis but it is
assumed that lack of proper egg hygiene including the
use of floor-and dirty eggs, washed eggs and eggs
demonstrating almost invisible cracks represents a
major risk for transmission of E. faecalis. Unfortunately
the conditions under which certain STs result in disease
and productions loss have not been clearly established
and further investigations are needed for clarification.
The relative high occurrence of S. hyicus and its impact
on subsequent flock health needs further investigations
since only limited data have been published on this bacterium from chickens [28,29]. Our investigation only
reported a snapshot of bacterial transfer between chickens in the hatcher. Further investigations are needed to
investigate the impact of the present findings.

Conclusions
The present findings demonstrated a high potential of a
few contaminated eggs or embryos to rapidly spread E.
faecalis infection to almost all chickens during hatch.
