Full mitochondrial genome sequences of two
endemic Philippine hornbill species (Aves:
Bucerotidae) provide evidence for pervasive
mitochondrial DNA recombination
Svenja Sammler1, Christoph Bleidorn1,2, Ralph Tiedemann1*

Abstract
Background: Although nowaday it is broadly accepted that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) may undergo
recombination, the frequency of such recombination remains controversial. Its estimation is not straightforward, as
recombination under homoplasmy (i.e., among identical mt genomes) is likely to be overlooked. In species with
tandem duplications of large mtDNA fragments the detection of recombination can be facilitated, as it can lead to
gene conversion among duplicates. Although the mechanisms for concerted evolution in mtDNA are not fully
understood yet, recombination rates have been estimated from “one per speciation event” down to 850 years or
even “during every replication cycle”.
Results: Here we present the first complete mt genome of the avian family Bucerotidae, i.e., that of two Philippine
hornbills, Aceros waldeni and Penelopides panini. The mt genomes are characterized by a tandemly duplicated
region encompassing part of cytochrome b, 3 tRNAs, NADH6, and the control region. The duplicated fragments are
identical to each other except for a short section in domain I and for the length of repeat motifs in domain III of
the control region. Due to the heteroplasmy with regard to the number of these repeat motifs, there is some size
variation in both genomes; with around 21,657 bp (A. waldeni) and 22,737 bp (P. panini), they significantly exceed
the hitherto longest known avian mt genomes, that of the albatrosses. We discovered concerted evolution
between the duplicated fragments within individuals. The existence of differences between individuals in coding
genes as well as in the control region, which are maintained between duplicates, indicates that recombination
apparently occurs frequently, i.e., in every generation.
Conclusions: The homogenised duplicates are interspersed by a short fragment which shows no sign of
recombination. We hypothesize that this region corresponds to the so-called Replication Fork Barrier (RFB), which
has been described from the chicken mitochondrial genome. As this RFB is supposed to halt replication, it offers a
potential mechanistic explanation for frequent recombination in mitochondrial genomes.

Background
Since Desjardins and Morais [1] have presented the mt
gene organization of the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus), it is known that birds possess a different gene order
compared to other vertebrates. While the chicken gene
order was found in many other avian taxa as well,

avian mt gene orders and discussed their potential origin.
Gibb et al. [6] suggested a conversion scenario for avian
species according to the tandem duplication and random
loss [TDRL] model [7,8]. Specifically, they assume the
derived avian gene order to have originated from an
initial tandem duplication of the Cytb/tRNA T/tRNA
P/NADH6/tRNA E/CR region, followed by several
gene losses or reductions. Up to now, the completely
conserved tandem duplicate is only reported for

albatrosses [4,6], spoonbills [9], and boobies [10].
Although further intermediate forms with two apparently
functional gene or control region (CR) duplicates are
rarely found (but see [3,5,6,11,12]), it is generally
assumed that the derived gene order has evolved independently more than once [2].
Studying mantellid frogs from Madagascar, Kurabayashi et al. [13] infer two other possible mechanisms of
mt genome reorganization than the TDRL model, both
duplication modes mediated by recombination. One
mechanism is the “illegitimate recombination via minicircle” (e.g., [14,15]), where one part of the mt gene
region is excised from one mt genome, forming a separate minicircle molecule. This molecule is then inserted
into another genome, resulting in nontandem-duplicated
regions within the mtDNA molecules. Another mechanism is the “general (homologous) recombination” (e.g.,
[16,17]), where DNA strands of two genomic portions
with identical or similar nucleotide sequences between
chromosomes or within a DNA molecule are exchanged.
When the exchanged DNA strands contain the same set
of genes or regions, this recombination process does not
cause gene duplication but can homogenize the
sequences (gene conversion). On the contrary, when the
exchanged DNA strands carry unequal sets of genes,
one of the resultant molecules or genomic portions will
have an extracopied gene region (unequal crossing over).
Recombination of the putative clonally maternally
inherited mitochondrial DNA has been detected in several animal species, including birds and mammals [18].
The frequency of such recombination, however, remains
controversial; its estimation is not straightforward, as
recombination under homoplasmy (i.e., among identical
mt genomes) is likely to be overlooked [19]. In species
with tandem duplications of large mtDNA fragments
such as in albatrosses [4], spoonbills [9] and boobies
[10], the detection of recombination is possible, as it can
lead to gene conversion among duplicates. Although the
mechanisms for concerted evolution in mtDNA are not
fully understood yet, recombination rates have been estimated from “one per speciation event” among albatross
species [4], down to 850 years among populations of
killifish [20]. The study of Ogoh and Ohmiya [21] even
shows that gene conversion in the mt genome of ostracods occurs during every replication cycle. To explain
their results, Ogoh and Ohmiya [21] suggest a different
mechanism. According to them, an exact replication
mechanism, not recombination, controls the concerted
evolution: the duplicated fragment is deleted and duplicated afresh in every replication cycle.
Besides studies on recombination and on rearrangements of mt genes, mtDNA as such is considered as a
valuable tool in population genetic, phylogeographic, and
phylogenetic studies [22]. Because useful information can

be detected from many of the mt genes and due to primers being functional for a wide range of avian taxa
[23,24], the number of completely sequenced avian mt
genomes is steadily increasing (e.g., [6,25-38]. Nevertheless, no mt genome from the family Bucerotidae is
known so far and hornbills are missing from many phylogenetic analyses.
Here we present the complete mt genomes of two
Philippine hornbills, endemic to the West Visayas, the
Rufous-headed Hornbill Aceros waldeni and the Visayan
Tarictic Hornbill Penelopides panini, and compare their
characteristic mt genome features to each other and to
those of other birds. We specifically test the hypothesis
that recombination of mtDNA occurs regularly, i.e.,
within individuals of local animal populations.

Results and discussion
Genome organization

The two new mt genome sequences of the Philippine
hornbills have been deposited in NCBI GenBank under
the accession numbers HQ834450 (A. waldeni) and
HQ834451 (P. panini). As expected and known from
other birds, NADH6 and 8 tRNAs are transcribed from
the light strand. All other 12 protein coding genes, 14
tRNAs and the two rRNAs 12S and 16S are located on
the heavy strand (see Additional file 1: Table S1.
Sequence annotation of the mt genome of A. waldeni/P.
panini (as in deposited sequence)). The mt genomes of
the two hornbills are longer than any other avian mt genome reported so far. The deposited sequences are 21,657
bp in A. waldeni and 22,737 bp in P. panini, both substantially exceeding the hitherto longest known avian mt
genome of Diomedea melanophris (18,967 bp) [6]. The
gene order is characterized by a tandemly duplicated
region beginning with the last 526 bp of Cytb, continuing
over tRNA T/tRNA P/NADH6/tRNA E, and ending after
CRII (Figure 1A). The final length of the mt genome is
the result of this duplication event, a repeat motif with
remarkably long units found in both CRs, and another
tandem repeat at the end of CRII. As there was some
intraindividual variation (heteroplasmy) in the number of
these repeats, total mt genomic lengths of both hornbill
species were variable (see below).
Structure of the duplicated region

Within individuals, the duplicated fragments are identical
for the first 1,368bp (A. waldeni) or 1,388 bp (P. panini),
except for a single substitution in two specimens (position 565 (tRNA T) in Pp-1 and position 1384 (CR) in Pp6; cf. Figure 1B, C). This region contains the duplicated
part of Cytb, tRNA T, tRNA P, NADH6, and tRNA E,
and the first part of domain I of the control regions (CR,
Figure 1). In the following 159 bp of A. waldeni, the
duplicated fragments greatly differ within each individual

either (i) only found at the beginning and/or the end of
the repeat region, or (ii) never occurred in that position,
but only in between other repeats (Figure 3). Within each
species, the first repeat unit always started with an identical motif of 19 bp (A. waldeni) or 98 bp (P. panini) (Figure 3). Likewise, the last repeat unit always ended with
an identical motif of 18 bp (A. waldeni) or 49 bp (P.
panini) (Figure 3). In CRII, the same types of repeat units
were found. On average, CRII contains fewer repeat units
than CRI. The number varies between 1 and 8 in A. waldeni (dominant 6, Figure 2C) and between 1 and 10 in
P. panini (dominant 10, Figure 2D).
The following sequence of domain III (around 130 bp
in A. waldeni and around 160 bp in P. panini) is identical among CRI and CRII within each of the species and
exhibits at its beginning some similarity to the repeat
motifs (data not shown; cf. to full mt genome sequences
in Genbank accession numbers HQ834450 and
HQ834451). In A. waldeni, CRI ends directly at the
duplicated part of Cytb, whereas CRII continues after a
spacer of 15 bp with another tandem repeat region. In
P. panini, CRII passes directly into this second repeat
region, whereas a spacer of 12 bp is situated between
CRI and the duplicated part of Cytb. Concerning the
second repeat region, the fully sequenced mt genome
copies contained a truncated unit and between 1 and 27
(A. waldeni) or 33 (P. panini) complete units of 34 bp
length. Even longer repeat regions (with presumably

higher repeat numbers) existed, but sequence analysis
did not reach through the entire repeat region of these
very long mt genome variants, such that the exact number of repeats could not unambiguously be determined.
The tandem repeat units exhibit a high A-content (47%)
on the heavy strand. While A. waldeni possesses only
one type of these tandem repeat units, different units
with transitions at two sites are found in P. panini.
The organization of the mitochondrial genome found
in the two hornbill species is most similar to that
reported for albatrosses (Thalassarche spp. [4], Diomedea melanophris [6]), for the black-faced spoonbill [9],
and for boobies [10]. It might constitute a general pattern at least in these two related taxonomic groups of
seabirds (i.e., Procellariiformes and Pelecaniformes
[6,10]).
Despite the general similarity in mitochondrial genome organization among albatrosses, the black-faced
spoonbill, boobies, and hornbills, there are some fundamental differences among them: The last part of Cytb,
with which the duplicated part begins, is significantly
longer in hornbills, the spoonbill, and boobies, whereas
in Thalassarche albatrosses this short Cytb part is preceded by a further part of Cytb considered to be degenerated [4].
Concerning CR domain III, the albatrosses and the
black-faced spoonbill possess repeat motifs only in CRII,
whereas in both hornbill species and in the three booby
species studied by Morris-Pocock et al. [10], the first
repeat motif is also found in CRI. Equally to the spoonbill study [9], neither Abbott et al. [4] nor Gibb et al. [6]
mention length heteroplasmy in this motif of the albatross in their publications; however, in an updated version of the respective sequence of Diomedea
melanophris albatross [GenBank: AY158677], heteroplasmy is assumed, as well as for the boobies [10].
Furthermore, confirmed length heteroplasmy in these
motifs is described for other bird species, e.g., for the
loggerhead shrike Lanius ludovicianus [39], for the little
blue penguin Eudyptula minor [34], and for the ivorybilled aracari Pteroglossus azara [6]. Two sets of repeat
motifs, as found in the studied hornbills in CRII, are
also described for the control region of penguins (Adélie
penguin, Pygoscelis adeliae [40] and little blue penguin
[34]). The little blue penguin was found to be heteroplasmic for both of these motifs [34].
Evidence for frequent recombination among mt genomes

The analysis of the tandemly duplicated region in 6
individuals of each hornbill species enabled us to evaluate sequence evolution patterns across orthologous and
paralogous duplicates over a total length of 1,930 bp,
encompassing the duplicated parts of Cytb, tRNA T/
tRNA P/NADH6/tRNA E and domains I and the first

Page 5 of 10

parts of domains II of the control regions (Figure 1,
accession numbers HQ834450-HQ834471). This analysis
revealed a remarkable shift in similarity pattern: In a
central section (159 bp in A. waldeni and 59 bp in P.
panini, grey shaded in Figure 1B, C), orthologous copies
(duplicate I of all individuals and duplicate II of all individuals, respectively) are more closely related to one
another across individuals than to paralogous copies
(duplicate I and duplicate II) within individuals (A. waldeni: πInd = 0.020, πDupl = 0.255; P. panini: πInd =
0.043, πDupl = 0.429). This section is situated in
domain I of the control regions. It is surrounded by sections with a reversed diversity pattern (1,368 bp and 403
bp in A. waldeni, 1,388 bp and 483 bp in P. panini), i.e.,
where paralogous copies within individuals are more
closely related (and in fact fully identical for most specimens; πDupl between 0.000 and 0.003) than orthologous
copies across specimens (πInd up to 0.032; Figure 1B,
C). This striking shift in sequence similarity from similarity among orthologues across specimens (grey) to
similarity/identity among paralogues within specimens
(white) is also reflected in our sequence section-specific
phylogenetic analyses using ML (Figure 4). These analyses suggest a homogenization among the duplicated
fragments within individuals (Figure 4A, C), from which
a distinct central sequence stretch (the grey shaded sections in Figure 1B, C) are exempted (Figure 4B, D). This
homogenization encompasses the whole duplicated part
of Cytb, tRNA T/tRNA P/NADH6/tRNA E, the first and

last nucleotides of domain I and the sequenced part of
domain II of the CR (altogether at least 1,771 bp in A.
waldeni and 1,871 bp in P. panini). In this entire region,
both duplicates within individuals are identical (except
for one or two single base pair differences in a few specimens of P. panini (one synonymous Single Nucleotide
Polymorphism (SNP) in tRNA T, the others in the CR);
cf. Figure 1C). At the same time, there is sequence variation at orthologues among individuals, both in coding
genes (one synonymous and one non-synonymous SNP
in Cytb and one synonymous SNP in NADH6 of A. waldeni; one synonymous SNP in tRNA T and one synonymous SNP in NADH6 of P. panini) and in the control
region of both species. If we compare any pair of specimens, their sequences in this region differ from one
another at exactly the same nucleotide sites in both
duplicates. This pattern indicates that the homogenization process must occur frequently, as it appears to have
occurred in every single mitochondrial lineage within
both species.
Kurabayashi et al. [13] postulated a novel scheme for
vertebrate mtDNA replication, which can explain high
frequencies of recombination. Applying this model to
birds, replication of avian mtDNA is initiated throughout the mt genome, excluding the Replication Fork Barrier (RFB) [41]. During each replication cycle, the 3’ end
of the nascent L-strand is suspected to remain free at
the RFB region until replication restarts. During the
relatively long time of exposure, the free strands can
easily be exchanged, leading to a high rate of recombination. This exchange can take place between two
mtDNA molecules, but also within a single molecule
(intragenomic gene conversion) if two independent
replication forks occur.
For both hornbill species, the homogenization of the
duplicates within individuals may be well explained with
this recombination model. The part of the control
region without intra-individual homogenization across
duplicates (grey-shaded in Figure 1B, C; see above) putatively represents the RFB. Kurabayashi et al. [13] found
recombination only on one side of the RFB. Our observation of homogenized sections on both sides of the
putative RFB in hornbills (as also described for albatrosses [4], the black-faced spoonbill [9], boobies [10],
and for the ruff [5]) may be explained by the fact, that
replication occurs in both directions around the circular
mtDNA in birds [41], with a prominent initiation zone
between Cytb and 12S, i.e., exactly in the genomic
region duplicated in hornbills, albatrosses, the blackfaced spoonbill, boobies, and the ruff.
For the CR of mammals, two types of so-called
Extended Termination Associated Sequences (ETAS)
have been described [42]. It is suggested that ETAS1
could contain recognition signals (primary and

Page 6 of 10

secondary structural elements) for the termination of
the nascent DNA or RNA chain, while ETAS2 could
contain the binding sites for termination factors [42].
Subsequently, ETAS were also found in birds (e.g., [43]).
If we align the consensus sequence of mammalian
ETAS1 and ETAS2 to our mt genome data of hornbills,
they best match within the CR of the hornbills exactly
in front of the putative RFB (i.e., exactly adjacent
upstream to the grey-shaded region in Figure 1B, C).
Putatively inferring this to be an ETAS region would
further explain the exclusion of the inferred RFB from
the recombination process.
Organization of the mt genome in hornbills compared
to other birds

Our complete sequences of the mitochondrial DNA of
two hornbill species reveal many peculiar features in
these mt genomes. Each of these features has been occasionally detected in a few avian taxa, but hornbills exhibit a unique combination in one single mt genome, i.e.,
(1) a tandem duplication of a region spanning over
three tRNAs, one partial and one complete proteincoding gene, and the control region, (2) the existence of
two sets of CR repeat motifs, of which one is duplicated
as well, and (3) the remarkably long single units of these
motifs, altogether making hornbills’ mt genome with
21,657 bp (A. waldeni) and 22,737 bp (P. panini) the
longest mt genome known from birds so far.
The hornbills’ gene order differs from the gene order
of most other avian taxa, except for two related groups
of seabirds (Procellariiformes, Pelecaniformes [4,6,10])
and for the black-faced spoonbill (Ciconiiformes [9],
assumed to be related to Procellariiformes and Pelecaniformes [44]). It has been named “duplicate tThr-CR”
[6]. Because Procellariiformes/Pelecaniformes/Ciconiiformes and hornbills are generally not assumed to be
sister taxa [44,45], our study indicates the independent
evolution of the rare “duplicate tThr-CR” gene order.
This gene order has been assumed to constitute an
intermediate form between the “ancestral avian” and the
“remnant CR(2)” gene orders, which is characterized by
two apparently functional control region duplicates
[6,11].
None of the peculiar features found in both Philippine
hornbills was found in the control region of African
hornbills - the closest relatives for which the CR has
been examined [46]. Instead, the authors assumed the
typical avian gene order (“ancestral type”) for Bucorvus
leadbeateri and several species of the genus Tockus.
However, in the light of our results this assumption has
to be re-examined. Delport et al. [46] sequenced only
part of the mt genome (between tRNAs T and F), thus
a duplication event might have been overlooked. Concerning further studies on the CR, we suggest for all

Sammler et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:35
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/35

avian taxa to sequence at least once the complete fragment between the end of NADH5 and the beginning of
12S because all duplication events known so far have
been located in this section.
Whereas repeat motifs are found in domain III of the
Philippine hornbills, Delport [46] discovered such a
motif in domain I of all African hornbills examined.
Thus, an alignment of the CRs of the Philippine with
those of the African hornbills was only possible for the
conserved central domain II. In a phylogenetic analysis
of this central domain, the two Philippine hornbills cluster together and are sister to the African species (see
Additional file 2: Figure S1. ML-analysis of the central
domain of the control region of Bucerotidae). In this
data set, however, the authenticity of the published
sequence of Bucorvus leadbeateri is rendered questionable, as it is indistinguishable from Tockus erythrorhynchus, despite the fact that Bucorvus and Tockus
species are morphologically clearly apart [47]. Furthermore, the assumption that the repeat motif in domain I
of the African hornbills had arisen before the adaptive
radiation of all hornbill species, but after the divergence
of hornbills from other avian taxa [46] clearly has to be
rejected, as (1) Philippine hornbills do not show this
sequence pattern and (2) our re-analysis of the data on
African hornbills strongly suggest that Delport et al.
[46] studied only members of the genus Tockus.

Conclusion
Our full mt genome analysis of hornbill species revealed
a large tandem duplication. Sequences within individuals
are homogenized, except for the central putative Replication Fork Barrier. This sequence pattern suggests very
frequent recombination of the mitochondrial genome.
The studies of Eberhard et al. [3] and Ogoh and Ohmiya
[21] were the first on concerted evolution in mitochondrial genomes in single species. In the ostracod Vargula
hilgendorfii, Ogoh and Ohmiya [21] detected frequent
gene conversion and suggested repeated deletion and
exact duplication in every replication cycle as the underlying mechanism. For hornbills, this mechanism is very
unlikely, as it would imply that deletion and exact duplication occur synchronously on both sides of the RFB in
every replication cycle. In a study on mtDNA of mangrove killifishes, Tatarenkov and Avise [20] found indications for frequent recombination, but did not present
any underlying molecular mechanism. In addition,
they - as others - detected recombination specifically in
the control region. For the case of Philippine hornbills,
we present evidence for frequent gene conversion by
recombination of a large section of the mitochondrial
genome, encompassing several coding genes. MorrisPocock et al. [10] sequenced only one individual of each
booby species, but they also assume that more than the

Page 7 of 10

CR, namely part of Cytb/tRNA T/tRNA P/NADH6/
tRNA E, evolve in concert. A possible mechanism is the
existence of a Replication Fork Barrier, where mt genome replication is halted such that the 3’ end of the
replicated strand remains free and might hence easily
recombine [13]. While there is no reason to assume that
this mechanism is restricted to those species with a
duplication in their mt genome, we argue that such
duplication greatly facilitates our ability to unravel
recombination: Without a duplication, recombination
might affect orthologues and might hence go undetected. The duplication creates the additional possibility
of intraindividual recombination among paralogues
sequence parts. Such recombination causes a homogenization among these paralogues, clearly differing from
the expectation of independent evolution after gene
duplication.

Methods
Sampling and DNA extraction

One drop of blood per sample was taken from captive
hornbills kept by the Philippine Endemic Species Conservation Project (PESCP) on Panay, Philippines, and
stored in 1 ml Queen’s Lysis Buffer [48]. DNA extraction was performed using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions for blood samples. The two genomes presented here were sequenced using DNA from two single
individuals. To test the hypothesis that recombination
occurs within individuals, five further unrelated individuals of each species were sampled.
The research followed internationally recognized
guidelines and applicable national legislation. We
received ethical approval from the deputy of animal welfare of the University of Potsdam.
Amplification, sequencing and cloning

To minimize the possibility of obtaining nuclear copies
of mt genes, we amplified longer fragments starting by
using the primers Pen_Cyt1065-for and Buce_12S240rev (~4.5 kb) designed from published sequences of
Penelopides spp. and other Bucerotidae and related taxa
from NCBI databank (see Additional file 3: Table S2.
PCR primers used to amplify and sequence mt gene
fragments). The PCRs were performed using a longrange polymerase (LA Taq™, TaKaRa Bio Inc, Shiga,
Japan). 15 μl-reaction volumes were set up as follows:
7.5 μl sterilized distilled water, 1.5 μl 10 x LA PCR™
Buffer II (Mg2+free), 1.5 μl 25 mM MgCl2-solution, 2.4
μl dNTP Mixture (2.5 mM each), 0.5 μl of each primer
(2 mM), 1 μl DNA template (~20 ng/μl), 0.08 μl
TaKaRa LA Taq™ (5 u/μl). The reaction was performed
under the following conditions: denaturing at 94°C for
1 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturing at 98°C for

Sammler et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:35
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/35

10 s and elongating at 70°C for 4 min (without additional primer annealing step), and finally, an extended
elongation period of 10 min at 72°C. The EXO-AP purified product was sequenced directly with PCR primers
and additionally with internally primers designed by primer walking (see fragment 5 in Additional file 3: Table
S2. PCR primers used to amplify and sequence mt gene
fragments). The sequencing reactions were performed
using BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing reagents
version 3.1 and run on an ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
To test for the existence of a duplicated control region
we amplified a product with primers AcePen_KRII-for
and AcePenGlu-rev (conditions as above, but 56°C
annealing temperature for 20 s and 68°C elongating
temperature for 3 min). This product was sequenced
with PCR primers and internal primers (see Figure 1
and fragment 4 in Additional file 3: Table S2. PCR primers used to amplify and sequence mt gene fragments).
Due to the detected duplication event, we amplified
the complete mt genomes in five overlapping fragments
(Figure 1A), using the following primer combinations:
1. ~14 kb: AcePen_12S_68-for and AcePen_Cytb250rev/AcePen_Cyt1018-rev (annealing and elongation
both at 68°C for 14 min together);
2. ~1.6 kb: AcePen_Cytb253-for and AcePenGlu-rev
(annealing at 60°C, elongation at 68°C for 1.5 min);
3. ~3.2 kb (A. waldeni), ~3,6 kb (P. panini): AcePen_Glu-for and AcePen_Cyt1018-rev (annealing at
60°C, elongation at 68°C for 3 min);
4. ~2.8 kb (A. waldeni), ~3,1 kb (P. panini): AcePen_KRII-for and AcePen_Glu-rev (annealing at 56°
C, elongation at 68°C for 3 min);
5. ~3.8 kb (A. waldeni), ~4,5 kb (P. panini): Pen_Cyt1065-for and Buce_12S240-rev (annealing and
elongation both at 70°C for 4 min together).
PCR products were subsequently sequenced by using
PCR primers and internal primers (see Additional file 3:
Table S2. PCR primers used to amplify and sequence mt
gene fragments). Because of apparent length heteroplasmy at the end of the control regions, we performed
nested PCRs on fragment 4 with the primers AcePen_KR_Rep-for and AcePen_Cyt638-rev and on fragment 5 with the primers AcePen_KR_Rep-for and
Acewal_KR_Z-rev for A. waldeni and Penpan_KR_Z-rev
for P. panini, respectively (annealing at 56.2°C, elongation at 70°C for 2 min (for sequences of primers see
Additional file 3: Table S2. PCR primers used to amplify
and sequence mt gene fragments). Another nested PCR
was performed on fragment 5 using primers AcePen_KRII-for and AvesDiv_Phe-rev. All these nested PCR

Page 8 of 10

products were cloned using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit
for Sequencing (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. At least 30 clones of each PCR were
sequenced.
1,930 bp encompassing the duplicated parts of Cytb,
tRNA T/rRNA P/NADH6/tRNA E and domains I and
the first parts of domains II of the CRs of 10 additional
individuals were determined by PCR amplification and
sequencing the fragments 2, 3, 4, and 5 (cf. Figure 1A).
Alignments and gene annotation

Transfer RNA genes (tRNA) were identified by their
potential secondary structure and anticodon sequence
using the tRNAscan-SE Server [49]. tRNA S2 was not
found by the server. Thus, we constructed the secondary
structure manually using tRNA S2 alignments from
other birds. The boundaries of ribosomal RNA genes
(rRNA) and the control region were inferred from
boundaries of flanking genes under the assumption that
there are neither intergenic spacers nor overlaps. Start
positions of protein-coding genes preceded by tRNAs
were defined by the first potential start codon after the
end of the flanking tRNA. Start positions of proteincoding genes preceded by other protein-coding genes
were determined by aligning them to other avian mt
genomes using the BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor
[50]. This method was also used to verify the boundaries
of all other genes. Stop codons of all protein-coding
genes were determined according to Slack et al. [34].
Analyses of sequence data

To infer the pattern of evolution of the duplicated
region, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis for 6 individuals per species. The two copies were included separately in each analyses and are designated by an
abbreviation of the species name, a unique number for
the individual, and a roman letter to distinguish the
copies (e.g., Pp-1-I and Pp1-1-II for the two duplicates
of individual number 1 of Penelopides panini). We conducted separate analyses for the region without the
putative Replication Fork Barrier (RFB) and for the
putative RFB fragment only (for determination of the
RFB region see Figure 1 and text below).
All four datasets (Pp_without_RFB, Pp_RFB_only,
Aw_without_RFB, Aw_RFB_only) were aligned in BioEdit [50]. Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis of the dataset was conducted using RAxML version 7.0.3 [51],
using GTR+GAMMA+P-Invar model parameters (4
gamma categories). GTR is the only available nucleotide
substitution model in RAxML.
To test for gene conversion, we compared (a) the mean
p-distance between duplicates within any individual
(πdupl) and (b) the mean p-distance between individuals
separately for each of the two duplicates (πind). This

Sammler et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:35
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/35

analysis was performed separately for the inferred Replication Fork Barrier (RFB; 159 bp in A. waldeni, 59 bp in
P. panini; shaded grey in Figure 1B, C) and the remaining
non-RFB parts of the duplicates (1,368 bp before and 403
bp after RFB in A. waldeni, 1,388 bp before and 483 bp
after RFB in P. panini; unshaded regions in Figure 1B, C)
using Mega 3.1 [52]. Without gene conversion, the two
duplicates are assumed to evolve independently after the
duplication event, such that πind should be expected to
be significantly higher than πdupl. This pattern should
disappear in the case of gene conversion, due to homogenization across duplicates.
Additionally, we compiled a dataset including all available hornbill data for the central region of the control
region (Aceros waldeni [Genbank: HQ834450]; Penelopides panini [GenBank: HQ834451]; Bucorvus leadbeateri [GenBank: AY027930]; Tockus erythrorhynchus
damarensis [GenBank: AY027932]; Tockus erythrorhynchus kempi [GenBank: AY027927]; Tockus erythrorhynchus rufirostris [GenBank: AY027928]; Tockus
leucomelas [GenBank: AY027931]; and Tockus monteiri
[GenBank: AY027934]). Sequences from Grus leucogeranus [GenBank: AF112371], Chlamydotis undulata fuertaventurae [GenBank: AJ544568], and Thalassarche
melanophris [GenBank: AY158677] served as outgroups.
Sequences were aligned using MAFFT version 6 [53],
using the iterative refinement method E-INS-i. Maximum
likelihood (ML) analysis of the dataset was conducted
using RAxML version 7.0.3 [51], using GTR+GAMMA
+P-Invar model parameters (4 gamma categories). Support values were estimated by 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
