phosphoribulokinase genes from two lineages of
“green” secondary photosynthetic eukaryotes:

Abstract
Background: Euglenophyta and Chlorarachniophyta are groups of photosynthetic eukaryotes harboring secondary
plastids of distinct green algal origins. Although previous phylogenetic analyses of genes encoding Calvin cycle
enzymes demonstrated the presence of genes apparently not derived from green algal endosymbionts in the
nuclear genomes of Euglena gracilis (Euglenophyta) and Bigelowiella natans (Chlorarachniophyta), the origins of
these “non-green” genes in “green” secondary phototrophs were unclear due to the limited taxon sampling.
Results: Here, we sequenced five new phosphoribulokinase (PRK) genes (from one euglenophyte, two
chlorarachniophytes, and two glaucophytes) and performed an extended phylogenetic analysis of the genes based on
a phylum-wide taxon sampling from various photosynthetic eukaryotes. Our phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that
the PRK sequences form two genera of Euglenophyta formed a robust monophyletic group within a large clade
including stramenopiles, haptophytes and a cryptophyte, and three genera of Chlorarachniophyta were placed within
the red algal clade. These “non-green” affiliations were supported by the taxon-specific insertion/deletion sequences in
the PRK alignment, especially between euglenophytes and stramenopiles. In addition, phylogenetic analysis of another
Calvin cycle enzyme, plastid-targeted sedoheptulose-bisphosphatase (SBP), showed that the SBP sequences from two
genera of Chlorarachniophyta were positioned within a red algal clade.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that PRK genes may have been transferred from a “stramenopile” ancestor to
Euglenophyta and from a “red algal” ancestor to Chlorarachniophyta before radiation of extant taxa of these two
“green” secondary phototrophs. The presence of two of key Calvin cycle enzymes, PRK and SBP, of red algal origins
in Chlorarachniophyta indicate that the contribution of “non-green” algae to the plastid proteome in the “green”
secondary phototrophs is more significant than ever thought. These “non-green” putative plastid-targeted enzymes
from Chlorarachniophyta are likely to have originated from an ancestral red alga via horizontal gene transfer, or
from a cryptic red algal endosymbiosis in the common ancestor of the extant chlorarachniophytes.

Background
The Russian botanist Mereschkowski articulated the
endosymbioitc theory a century ago [1]. Today, most
biologists believe that the endosymbiosis is responsible
for the establishment of mitochondria and chloroplasts,

which have played a critical role for the evolution of
eukaryotes. Establishment of plastids is attributed to the
process called primary endosymbiosis in which the host
cell engulfed a cyanobacterial ancestor, and then some
red and green algal ancestors were incorporated into
other phagotrophic eukaryotes via secondary endosymbiosis and retained as secondary plastids [2]. Almost all
of the plastids in secondary and tertiary algae from stramenopiles, alveolates, haptophytes and cryptophytes (so-

called ‘chromalveolates’) are thought to ultimately have
originated from a secondary endosymbiosis of a red
algal ancestor [3], whereas two eukaryotic groups, Euglenophyta and Chlorarachniophyta, possess secondary
plastids of green algal origin [4]. Recent studies demonstrated that the origins of the “green” secondary plastids
of these two algal phyla are derived from independent
secondary endosymbioses [4,5].
In the process of primary and secondary endosymbioses, the genomic contents of the endosymbionts are
reduced when compared to their presumed ancestors
[2,6] via gene loss and a process known as endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT), in which a set of genes mostly
assigned to the endosymbiont’s functions is consequently moved to the nucleus of the host and merged
into the chromosome [7-13]. EGT can be regarded as a
special case of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), which is
applicable to broader biological contexts such as a predacious or parasitic process [10,14,15]. Thus, extensive
molecular phylogenetic analysis and careful examination
of multiple possible HGT-derived genes are keys to give
insights into historical events of endosymbioses (even
including a cryptic endosymbiosis) in a eukaryotic cell
[16].
In primary phototrophs, many of the nuclear-encoded
genes encoding Calvin cycle (CC) enzymes are EGTderived [11-13]. Phosphoribulokinase (PRK) (EC
2.7.1.19) is one of those CC enzymes, catalyzes conversion of ATP and D-ribulose 5-phosphate into ADP and
D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate [17]. Phylogenetic analysis
suggested that PRK sequences are divided into two distantly related classes, Class I and Class II, which share
approximately 20% amino acid (aa) identity [18,19]. Proteobacterial Class I enzymes are octamers, whereas
Class II enzymes from cyanobacteria and eukaryotic
phototrophs function as tetramers and dimers, respectively [20]. Although some CC genes are affiliated with
non-cyanobacterial prokaryotic homologs [12,13], the
Class II PRK genes of the photosynthetic eukaryotes
form a robust monophyletic group with cyanobacterial
homologs, suggesting no gene replacement after the primary endosymbiosis (Additional file 1). In addition, PRK
genes are relatively conserved among the CC genes [11].
Thus, PRK may be an ideal gene to trace the historical
events of endosymbioses of the plastids.
Phylogenetic analysis of PRK by Petersen et al. [17]
shed light on the unusual origins of the genes from
two lineages of “green” secondary phototrophs, Chlorarachniophyta and Euglenophyta. Bigelowiella natans
(Chlorarachniophyta) has a “red alga-like” PRK gene
while Euglena gracilis (Euglenophyta) has a “stramenopile-like” PRK. Obviously, unsolved problems remain
because of only one chlorarachniophyte and one euglenophyte OTUs analyzed [13,17]. A recent study on

PRK phylogeny including several additional operational
taxonomic units (OTUs) from green algae and dinoflagellates, in addition to taxon-specific insertion/deletion
in the alignment, demonstrated strong affiliation
between stramenopiles and Euglena likewise between
Bigelowiella and red algae [21,22]. However, each of
the two green secondary phototrophic phyla still
included only a single OTU, and the taxon samplings
were also limited in the Glaucophyta and Chlorophyta
(one of the two major clades of green plants or Viridiplantae) [13,17,21,22].
The present study was undertaken to deduce the origins of “non-green” PRK genes from Euglenophyta and
Chlorarachniophyta and to reconstruct more natural
phylogenetic relationships of PRK from the major algal
groups, employing a wider taxon sampling from various
photosynthetic eukaryotes. We determined five new
PRK genes from one euglenophyte, two chlorarachniophytes, and two glaucophytes and obtained several other
PRK genes from the available genome and expressed
sequence tag (EST) data up-to-date. Our extensive phylogenetic analyses of PRK genes demonstrated ancient
origins of the “non-green” genes from the two algal
groups harboring “green” secondary plastids (Euglenophyta and Chlorarachniophyta).

Methods
Strains and culture

The glaucophytes Gloeochaete wittrockiana SAG 46.84
and Glaucocystis nostochinearum SAG 16.98 were cultured in AF-6 medium [23] that was modified according
to Kasai et al. [24]. Eutreptiella gymnastica NIES-381
and Gymnochlora stellata CCMP 2057 were cultured in
L1 medium [25] in which the natural seawater was
replaced with Daigo’s artificial seawater SP (Nihon Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The cultures were
grown at 20°C with a 14 h: 10 h light: dark cycle. Chlorarachnion reptans NIES-624 was grown as described
previously [5]. All of these strains are unialgal, without
contaminations of other algae.
RNA extraction and cDNA library construction

Cells of E. gymnastica, G. wittrockiana, and G. nostochinearum were crushed using ceramic beads and a Mixer
Mill MM 300 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and RNAs
were subsequently extracted using the SV total RNA
isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Cells of
G. stellata and C. reptans were disrupted and homogenized using brushes [26], and the RNA extraction was
performed using the RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen). Reverse
transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for
all five RNA samples was performed using the Capfishing full-length cDNA Kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea). The
cDNAs were used as templates for PRK gene isolation.

Cloning and sequencing of phosphoribulokinase genes

For amplification of Class II PRK genes from cDNA, we
designed degenerate primers based on conserved aa
sequences of the published PRK protein sequences
(Additional file 2). Nested PCR amplifications using
these degenerate primers were carried out using the
recombinant Taq™DNA polymerase (Takara Bio, Shiga,
Japan). PCR was performed with 35 cycles at 95°C for 2
min, 46°C for 2 min, and 66°C for 3 min, followed by
72°C for 15 min using the Takara PCR Thermal Cycler
(Takara Bio). First PCR products were amplified by PRK
UF-1 and PRK UR-5, and the second were amplified by
PRK UF-2 and PRK UR-4 (Additional file 2). Approximately 240 bp of PCR products were subsequently
cloned into a plasmid vector (pCR ®4-TOPO®) using a
TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
for sequencing. Plasmids from positive clones were then
sequenced using the BigDye™ Terminator v3.1 Cycle
Sequencing Kit and the ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Nucleotide sequences were determined based on at least three
clones sharing the same sequence for each. Besides five
new PRK sequences determined in the present study
(Additional file 3), no other PRK sequences were
obtained from the cloned PCR products, suggesting no
contaminations of other algae during the experiment.
Specific primers (Additional file 2) were designed using
the partial sequences of PRK genes obtained from the
cloned PCR products. A 3’-rapid amplification of cDNA
ends (3’-RACE) was carried out using these specific primers, and the PCR products were sequenced by the
direct sequencing method.
Phylogenetic methods

Most Class II PRK sequences were retrieved from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and Joint Genome Institute (JGI) http://www.jgi.doe.gov/. In this analysis,
besides five new PRK sequences, one brown alga (Ectocarpus siliculosus), seven chlorophytes, and several other
available sequences were added to OTUs used previously [17,21]. Sequences of PRK genes from two charophycean algae, Closterium peracerosum-strigosumlittorale complex (Closterium psl complex) and Chara
braunii, were obtained from unpublished assembled
EST data (Nishiyama pers. comm.). The aa sequences of
PRK from 42 eukaryotic ingroup and 14 cyanobacterial
outgroup OTUs (including five genes sequenced in this
study; Additional file 3) were aligned using SeaView
[27], and ambiguous sites were removed from the alignment to produce a data matrix of 327 aa from 60 OTUs
(available from TreeBase: http://www.treebase.org/treebase-web/home.html; study ID: s11802) (Additional file
4). All of the PRK nucleotide sequences used in the

Page 3 of 10

present study cover more than 300 aa within the 327 aa
alignment except for EST database-retrieved sequences
from the streptophyte Artemisia annua (230 aa), Beta
vulgaris (262 aa), the glaucophyte Cyanophora paradoxa
(153 aa), and the dinoflagellate Amphidinium carterae
(292 aa). The following phylogenetic analyses were carried out, after excluding four dinoflagellate sequences
that exhibit long branches and cause low phylogenetic
resolution (Additional file 5).
Bayesian inference (BI) was conducted using MrBayes
(ver. 3.1.2; [28]) with the WAG+I+Г4 model. BI consisted of two parallel runs with each of four Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) incrementally heated
chains and 1,000,000 generations, with sampling every
100 generations. The first 25% of the generations were
discarded as burn-in, and the remaining trees were used
to calculate a 50% majority-rule consensus tree and
determine the posterior probabilities (PP) of the individual branches. The average standard deviation of split
frequencies of the two MCMC iteration runs was below
0.01 for each analysis, indicating convergence. In addition, 1000 replicates of bootstrap analyses using the
maximum likelihood (ML) method were performed
using both RAxML (ver. 7.0.3; [29]) and PhyML
(ver.3.0; [30]) with the WAG+I+Г4 model. Maximum
parsimony (MP) analysis was also run with PAUP
4.0b10 [31] with the nearest-neighbor-interchange
search method to produce bootstrap values (BV) based
on 1000 replicates.
In addition, we carried out two approximate unbiased
tests (AU test) [32] to examine the phylogenetic positions of the two monophyletic groups of euglenophytes
and chlorarachniophytes. We used two series of the
phylogenetic trees of PRK sequences, where topologies
of all the OTUs excluding either of the euglenophytes
or chlorarachniophytes were fixed, and the alignment
(327 aa) as input data. All possible topologies were generated by re-grafting the branch of euglenophytes or
chlorarachniophytes using the in-house ruby script. The
pools of topologies were analyzed with the AU test
using the site-wise log-likelihood values were calculated
using PhyML (with WAG model+F+I+Г4) and used for
AU test conducted by Consel (ver. 0.1 k; [33]).
Analyses of sedoheptulose-bisphosphatase (SBP) genes
were also carried out based on 275 aa from 37 OTUs
(available from TreeBase: http://www.treebase.org/treebase-web/home.html; study ID: s11802) (Additional file
6) representing a wide range of eukaryotic organisms
(including two chlorarachniophyte sequences) (Additional file 7) using the same phylogenetic methods as
for the present PRK genes described above.
Programs for BI, ML and AU test were executed on a
supercomputer (Human Genome Center, University of
Tokyo, Japan).

Results
PRK phylogeny

As shown in Figure 1, PRK sequences from each of the
two eukaryotic phyla, Euglenophyta and Chlorarachniophyta, with the green secondary plastids was resolved as
a monophyletic group with very high support values
(1.00 PP in BI and 100% BV by the three other methods). Two euglenophyte PRK sequences and those from
stramenopiles, haptophytes, and cryptophytes formed a
large clade (SHC group) supported by relatively high
support values (1.00 PP and 93-96% BV), whereby the
Euglenophyta represented a derived position. Three
chlorarachniophyte and red algal homologs were
resolved as a monophyletic group supported by 1.00 PP
in BI and 50-70% BV only in ML analyses. The monophyly of homologs from green plants (land plants and
green algae) was moderately supported (with 1.00 PP
and 62-86% BV), and the sequences from green plants
and SHC group formed a large monophyletic group
with high support values (1.00 PP and 98-100% BV).
Three OTUs of glaucophytes were resolved as a monophyletic group with 1.00 PP and 61-82% BV, and constituted a basal eukaryotic group with red algal and
chlorarachniophyte homologs. However, phylogenetic
relationships within this basal group were not well
resolved.
Based on the tree topology (Figure 1) and the patterns
of insertion/deletion sequences (Figure 2), PRK proteins
were subdivided into five groups, cyanobacteria, stramenopiles plus euglenophytes, cryptophytes plus haptophytes, green plants, and the basal eukaryotic group
(glaucophytes, red algae, and chlorarachniophytes). The
results of AU tests did not rule out a green algal origin
of PRK sequences from Euglenophyta or Chlorarachniophyta (Figure 3). However, the tree topologies, in which
the euglenophyte PRK clade was nested within or sister
to the chlorophyte clade and at the basal positions of
the green plants, were rejected at the 5% level (Figure
3A). Although the AU test did not reject the positioning
of the chlorarachniophyte sequences at most of the
basal branches of the tree and at distal branches of
green plant homologs, the topologies where the chlorarachniophyte OTUs are positioned within SHC group
(composed of stramenopiles, haptophytes, cryptophyte
and euglenophytes) were rejected at the 5% level (Figure
3B).
SBP phylogeny

The phylogenetic results of SBP sequences are shown in
Additional file 8. As in the previous study [34], the SBP
proteins were subdivided into two groups, one of which
is composed of possible plastid-targeted proteins from
green plants (Streptophyta and Chlorophyta), Euglena,

four red algal sequences, Cyanophora, and two chlorarachniophytes (Bigelowiella and Gymnochlora). The two
chlorarachniophytes and two red algae (Porphyra and
Chondrus) formed a moderate monophyletic group, with
0.94 PP in BI and 61-69% BV in three other phylogenetic methods. Euglena was positioned within one of the
chlorophyte lineages that constituted a monophyletic
group (with 1.00 PP in BI and 65-81% BV in three other
phylogenetic methods).
Many of the nuclear-encoded genes of CC enzymes
are EGT-derived. But several CC enzymes are of noncyanobacterial origin [12,13]. Eukaryotic SBP is a
nuclear-encoded gene of bacterial ancestry [35]. Teich et
al. argued that SBP genes found in phototrophic eukaryotes were likely to have originated from a single
recruitment of plastid-targeted enzyme in photosynthetic eukaryotes after primary endosymbiosis and a
further distribution to algae with secondary plastids via
EGT [34]. Our results are consistent with this scenario
and we postulate that euglenophyte and chlorarachniophyte SBP genes were transferred from a green alga and
a red alga, respectively.

Discussion
Origin of the “non-green” genes from Chlorarachniophyta
and its implication with secondary “green” plastids

Earlier phylogenetic analyses of the plastid-encoded
genes and the nuclear-encoded plastid-targeted PsbO
proteins demonstrated that the “green” secondary plastids of Chlorarachniophyta and Euglenophyta were of
distinct origins, but the sequences from these two
groups and green plants formed a robust monophyletic
group as a whole [4,5]. On the other hand, EST data of
Bigelowiella natans showed the composition of nucleus
genome is a mixture of genes derived from various
sources [36]. Consistent with previous studies [17,21],
our phylogenetic analysis of PRK proteins (Figure 1) and
comparison of insertion/deletion sequences in the alignment (Figure 2) suggested that the three chlorarachniophyte PRK genes likely originated from non-green
lineage, although the present AU test did not reject
their green origin (Figure 3B). Based on the tree topology resolved (Figure 1), the most probable origin of the
chlorarachniophyte PRK genes is a red algal ancestor.
Several lines of research on the phylogeny of the Chlorarachniophyta [37-40] indicated that the three chlorarachniophyte genera examined in this study are
distributed widely within this phylum. Therefore, it is
likely that the PRK gene was transferred from an ancestral red alga before radiation of the extant taxa of
Chlorarachniophyta.
Recent nuclear multigene phylogenetic studies of
eukaryotes suggested that Rhizaria (including

Figure 3 Results of the AU tests for assessing the phylogenetic position of euglenophyte and chlorarachniophyte clades into a
broadly sampled BI tree. The Bayesian posterior probabilities (≥ 0.9) of the individual branches are shown. The probability (p-value by AU test)
for each topology is indicted with the branch thickness (see squares below the trees). (A) Placement of the euglenophyte clade into a 54-taxon

the ancestor of chlorarachniophytes. However, no insertion/deletion information was found in the SBP alignment for supporting the non-green origin of the genes
(Additional file 6). A previous study proposed a hypothesis that the plastid-targeted SBP proteins of non-cyanobacterial origin was introduced and replaced the original
cyanobacterial counterpart in the common ancestor of
primary phototrophs, i.e., green plants, glaucophytes and
red algae [13]. As is the case with PRK, it is likely that
the “red” SBP gene was acquired before the radiation of
extant taxa of Chlorarachniophyta.
Archibald et al. [36] suggested that eight B. natans
genes encoding plastid enzymes were derived from red
algae or secondary algae harboring red algal plastids,
and that these “red” lineage genes in B. natans were
acquired via HGT through the feeding of red algal
prey organisms by mixotrophic host chlorarachniophytes. Given this perspective, one possible explanation for the origin of the multiple red algal-derived
CC genes in the chlorarachniophyte nuclear genomes

is that these genes were transferred from red algal
prey organisms via HGT. Furthermore, the fact that
the essential functions of CC enzymes play key roles
in the plastid metabolism is tempting to speculate that
the red algal prey might have had a close interaction
with the host and provided CC enzymes which
accordingly enhanced photosynthetic performance.
Alternatively, the prey organism might have been captured by and retained in an ancestral (and probably
non-photosynthetic) chlorarachniophyte as an endosymbiont, which was then replaced by a green algal
endosymbiont, giving rise to the extant secondary
plastid in Chlorarachniophyta. Such a cryptic endosymbiosis scenario is consistent with the present consideration that the two CC enzymes (PRK and SBP)
are likely originate from a red algal lineage before the
radiation of the extant taxa of Chlorarachniophyta. To
verify this hypothesis, we need to analyze as many
genes as possible to find the consistent pattern among
the gene trees.

“Non-green” origins of the PRK genes from Euglenophyta

The PRK sequences from the secondary phototrophic
group Euglenophyta also showed the “non-green” affiliation in this analysis (Figure 1), despite the well-established
notion that the euglenophyte plastids originated from
green plants [4,5]. Our results of AU test also did not support that the euglenophyte PRK genes originated from a
basal lineage of the green plants or the prasinophyte-like
secondary endosymbiont that gave rise to the secondary
plastid in Euglenophyta (Figure 3A). Earlier phylogenetic
research on nuclear genes [44-46] suggested that Euglena
and Eutreptiella are representative genera of two major
monophyletic groups in Euglenophyta. Our phylogenetic
tree and comparison of insertion/deletion characters in
the alignment demonstrated that PRK genes of these two
genera are both stramenopile-like (Figures 1, 2), suggesting
that the HGT of stramenopile PRK genes might have
taken place before the radiation of the extant members of
Euglenophyta. A recent study of putative stramenopilederived genes in Euglena and Peranema (phagotrophic
euglenoid), based on the single gene-based phylogenetic
analysis using EST data, proposed a testable hypothesis on
an ancient EGT from a stramenopile ancestor to the common ancestor of Euglenida (including both phototrophic
and heterotrophic euglenoids) [47].
Origin of “green” PRK genes in stramenopiles

Our tree topology robustly resolved that green plants
constitute a monophyletic group adjacent to SHC group
as a sister group (Figure 1). Given the phylogenetic analyses of eukaryotes using slowly evolving nuclear genes
suggesting that a large clade composed of stramenopiles
and alveolates (and haptophytes) are sister to green
plants [48,49], the sister relationship of PRK genes
between green plants and SHC group may have resulted
from their host cell phylogeny. This implies that the
ancestor of SHC group might once have been a photosynthetic alga harboring primary plastids which shared
the same origin with green plants’ counterparts [48-50].
Under this view, after the divergence between the SHC
ancestor and green plants, the PRK genes within some
lineages of SHC group might have been retained in the
host nuclei even after the original “green” plastids were
replaced by the extant “red” plastids via secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga [50].
Alternatively, Moustafa et al. [51] argued that an
ancestor of stramenopiles and alveolates (and Rhizaria)
might once have harbored a green algal endosymbiont.
Besides the PRK gene, an expanded list of green-related
genes has been reported in stramenopiles and alveolates
[52,53], which is consistent with the hypothesis on an
EGT event from a green alga, possibly a mamiellalean
ancestor (prasinophyte), in the ancestor of stramenopiles
and alveolates [51]. However, our PRK protein

Page 8 of 10

phylogeny resolved that SHC group was positioned outside the monophyletic green plants (including mamiellalean algae Ostreococcus and Micromonas) (Figure 1).
Given such a phylogenetic position of SHC group, the
“green” PRK genes in SHC group cannot be explained
by the EGT from a mamiellalean ancestor.

Conclusion
The present phylogenetic results suggest that PRK genes
may have been transferred from a “stramenopile” ancestor
to Euglenophyta and from a “red algal” ancestor to Chlorarachniophyta before radiation of extant taxa of these two
“green” secondary phototrophs. As discussed above, other
stramenopile-like and red alga-like putative plastid-targeted enzymes are recognized in Euglenophyta and Chlorarachniophyta, respectively, allowing us to speculate a
cryptic endosymbiosis of a non-green algal ancestor in
each of the phyla [47]. Thus, the contribution of “nongreen” algae to the plastid proteome in the “green” secondary phototrophs is more significant than ever thought.
