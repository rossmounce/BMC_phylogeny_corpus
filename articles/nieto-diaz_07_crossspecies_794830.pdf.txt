Abstract
Background: Gene expression profiles of non-model mammals may provide valuable data for biomedical
and evolutionary studies. However, due to lack of sequence information of other species, DNA
microarrays are currently restricted to humans and a few model species. This limitation may be overcome
by using arrays developed for a given species to analyse gene expression in a related one, an approach
known as "cross-species analysis". In spite of its potential usefulness, the accuracy and reproducibility of
the gene expression measures obtained in this way are still open to doubt. The present study examines
whether or not hybridization values from cross-species analyses are as reproducible as those from samespecies analyses when using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays.
Results: The reproducibility of the probe data obtained hybridizing deer, Old-World primates, and human
RNA samples to Affymetrix human GeneChip® U133 Plus 2.0 was compared. The results show that crossspecies hybridization affected neither the distribution of the hybridization reproducibility among different
categories, nor the reproducibility values of the individual probes. Our analyses also show that a 0.5% of
the probes analysed in the U133 plus 2.0 GeneChip are significantly associated to un-reproducible
hybridizations. Such probes-called in the text un-reproducible probe sequences- do not increase in
number in cross-species analyses.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that cross-species analyses do not significantly affect hybridization
reproducibility of GeneChips, at least within the range of the mammal species analysed here. The
differences in reproducibility between same-species and cross-species analyses observed in previous
studies were probably caused by the analytical methods used to calculate the gene expression measures.
Together with previous observations on the accuracy of GeneChips for cross-species analysis, our
analyses demonstrate that cross-species hybridizations may provide useful gene expression data.
However, the reproducibility and accuracy of these measures largely depends on the use of appropriated
algorithms to derive the gene expression data from the probe data. Also, the identification of probes
associated to un-reproducible hybridizations-useless for gene expression analyses- in the studied
GeneChip, stress the need of a re-evaluation of the probes' performance.

Background
DNA microarray technology is a basic tool to measure
genomewide changes in gene expression. Microarray analysis of gene expression in non-model mammals may provide very valuable data for biomedical [1-3] or
evolutionary [4-7] studies. However, DNA microarrays are
currently restricted to humans and a few model species,
due to lack of sequence information for other species. This
limitation could be overcome by using arrays developed
for a given species to analyse gene expression in a related
one [4,8-12]. This approach, known as "cross-species
analysis", assumes that the RNA transcripts for one species
will hybridize efficiently with the arrayed sequences of
another species, provided that both species share enough
sequence similarity (over 95% in orthologous 3'-UTR
sequences according to Nagpal et al. [10]). The cross-species approach has been employed in several studies in
mammals, using human microarrays to analyse closely
related species, such as chimpanzees, orangutans and
other primates [4], as well as more distantly related species, such as pigs, cows or dogs [8,9]. These studies assume
that the short time of divergence between mammals (less
that 100 million years) and the preservation of their protein function assures enough nucleotide-sequence conservation among species [9].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/89

this way is open to doubt. Two aspects of measurement
quality appear as most important i) the accuracy of the
measurement-the agreement between the observed and
the true value of a measure; termed validity in statistical
terminology-, and ii) the reproducibility (or precision;
also called reliability in statistical jargon) of the measurement, i.e. whether repeated measurements will give similar values [14]. Different authors have examined both
aspects of cross-species analyses using Affymetrix GeneChips, reaching diverse conclusions [9,10,15-17]. There is
a general agreement in that the array sensitivity and, thus,
the accuracy of the analysis, decreases with increasing
sequence differences between the species being analyzed
and the array species [9,15,16]. In a practical sense, this
implies that cross-species analyses yield significantly more
false negatives-genes that appear not to be expressed
although they are really being expressed- than same-species analyses. This point was clearly illustrated by Chismar
and co-workers [15] showing that the number of detected
transcripts by a human GeneChip were a 50% lower when
analysing Macaca samples than when analysing human
samples. Accordingly, various authors have developed
specific methods to correct the sensitivity reduction of
cross-species analysis [9,10,16].

Among the existing DNA array platforms, Affymetrix
high-density oligonucleotide GeneChips® (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA, USA) have been repeatedly employed for
cross-species analyses. GeneChips estimate gene expression measures-like the presence and abundance of a transcript- by applying analytical methods to the
hybridization values of sets of 11 to 20 pairs of probes
(probesets) for each transcript [13]. Each probe pair consists of a 25 bases long perfect match probe (PM), fully
complementary to the target, and a 25 bases long mismatch probe (MM), that shares only 24 bases with the target sequence. The large number of probes per target used
by Affymetrix microarrays represents an advantage for
cross species analyses with respect to other microarray
platforms, such as those based on cDNA probes. The presence of 11 to 20 probes per target increases the probability
of having probes with enough sequence similarity with
the target transcript to obtain a feasible measure of its
expression [9]. In contrast, the long sequence probes in
cDNA microarrays may favour the hybridization with
orthologous genes from other species compared to the 25
bases long Affymetrix probes. Genechips also have the
advantage of allowing worldwide researchers to access the
same standardized arrays, the same sample processing
methods, and the same image acquisition instruments to
quantify gene expression.

Data reproducibility has received less attention despite
the fact that it is not possible to achieve accuracy in individual measurements if these measurements are associated to high variability. The percentage of transcripts that
can be consistently detected as present (according to an
Affymetrix algorithm [13]) across replicates is significantly reduced when Macaca RNA samples were hybridized to the Affymetrix Hu95Av5 human GeneChip, than
when human RNA samples were hybridized to this chip
[15]. A similar reduction in reproducibility of the present
calls was observed by Wang et al. [17] when analysing
Macaca and Pan samples with human GeneChips. In contrast, Dillman and Phillips [18] observed no reproducibility differences when the gene expression data generated by
hybridizing human, Chlorocebus and Macaca RNA samples
to the Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 human GeneChip were
compared, in agreement with previous observations from
cross-species analyses using cDNA microarrays [8,19].
What is the real effect of cross-species analyses on the
reproducibility of Affymetrix hybridization data? To
explain these apparently contradictory results, we hypothesized that hybridization values were equally reproducible in cross-species and same-species analyses at least
when restricted to mammals, and that contradictions
arose from differences in the way gene expression measures were derived from the hybridization data of the
Affymetrix probes.

Despite the potential usefulness of cross-species analyses,
the quality of the gene expression measures obtained in

To test these hypotheses, we have compared the reproducibility of hybridization data from different mammal sam-

ples analysed with the Affymetrix human GeneChip U133
Plus 2.0. Unlike previous studies that analysed reproducibility of gene expression measures like signal intensity or
detection call, we have used probe intensity data. In this
way, we strictly analysed hybridization reproducibility,
leaving out the effect of the algorithms used to calculate
the gene expression measures from the probe intensity
values. We used specifically data from hybridization to
GeneChip U133 Plus 2.0, to take advantage of the presence of probes with the same sequences in different
probesets of this GeneChip. These internal replicas permit
the study of reproducibility within the same chip, avoiding variations due to differences in the GeneChips or in
their processing (including hybridization, staining and
scanning), which may be responsible for much of the total
variation in microarray analyses [20]. Probe intensity data
originate from the analysis of human, three species of
Old-World primates, and deer RNA samples. We compared data from such a differently related taxa to evaluate
the effect of increasing sequence differences on hybridization reproducibility. Old World monkeys are closely
related to humans (time of divergence 25–30 millions of
years [21,22]) while deers (a representative of the Artiodactyla order) represent a more distantly related taxon,
whose ancestors diverged from the ancestors of primates
at the base of the Placental radiation, nearly 100 million
of years ago [21,23]. Hybridization data from these species were used to test the following:
1. Whether cross-species hybridizations affected the distribution of the hybridization reproducibility, i.e., whether
the number of sequences in different reproducibility categories was similar in same and cross-species analyses.
2. Whether there were probe sequences associated to irreproducible or poorly reproducible hybridizations, and
whether cross-species analyses increased the proportion
of these sequences with respect to same-species analyses.
3. Whether the reproducibility of each sequence tended to
be lower in cross-species hybridizations than in same-species hybridizations.
To further test the effect of sequence differences on
hybridization reproducibility, we repeated these three
analyses comparing the hybridization data for repeated
perfect match (PM) and mismatch (MM) sequences in the
human samples. These comparisons permit to evaluate
the effect of a known and fixed sequence difference (one
change in the 13th base) on hybridization reproducibility.
Finally, we studied the relationship between hybridization value and reproducibility, to test whether low hybridization values were less reproducible than high values and
thus, whether cross-species analyses were less reproduci-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/89

ble because they yielded lower hybridization signals than
same-species analyses.
The results presented show that, within the range of the
mammals studied, cross-species analyses do not significantly affect hybridization reproducibility and suggest
that the analytical methods used to calculate the gene
expression measures are responsible for the previously
observed reproducibility differences between same-species and cross-species analyses. In parallel, we have identified several probe sequences associated to poorly
reproducible hybridizations that should not to be taken
into consideration for quantifying gene expression.

Results
Identification and characterization of the GeneChip
repeated sequences
Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip contains 15472
sequences (7736 PM and 7736 MM) repeated in at least
two different probes. These sequences correspond to
17462 of the 604258 probe pairs present in this GeneChip. Twenty six of the repeated sequences (13 PM and 13
MM), corresponding to 52 probes (26 PM and 26 MM),
hybridize to non-human RNA transcripts included in the
array as spikes to test the array performance. The number
of repetitions ranges from 2 to 20, with most sequences
repeated just once (Table 1). A description of all repeated
probes in the U133 plus 2.0 GeneChip-including the
probeset to which the probe belongs, the oligonucleotide
sequence, and the position of the probe in the GeneChipis provided in the Additional file 1.

RNA samples used in all analyses are detailed in table 2.
Hybridization values of each sample for all repeated
sequences are provided in the Additional file 1. Normal
distribution of these values was checked in 22 sequences
with more than 6 repetitions, using Shapiro-Wilk W test
(see Additional file 2). Hybridization values were normally distributed across replicas in most cases, though for
some sequences differed significantly (p < 0.05) from the
normal distribution, even after applying a Bonferroni correction. Non-normality in these cases was due to the presence of one or a few outlier probes with extreme values
(see graphs in Additional file 2). No differences in normality were apparent between species or between PM and
MM data. Kolmogorov Smirnoff and Lilliefors tests
yielded comparable results (data not shown).
Effect of sequence differences on the distribution of
hybridization variability
The coefficient of variation (CV) of the hybridization values for the repeated PM sequences in each sample for the
various species was chosen as a measurement of hybridization reproducibility and used to analyse the hybridization reproducibility differences between same-species and

cross-species analyses. Although within-subject standard
deviation is the most commonly used measurement of
reproducibility, it was rejected due to its significant correlation with the mean in all samples (see data in Additional file 3 and analysis in Additional file 4). A brief
discussion justifying the use of CV to measure data reproducibility is provided in the methods section (fully discussed in [14,24,25]). CV data for all samples and
sequences may be obtained from the Additional file 3.
A two-way ANOVA was used initially to test whether or
not all species presented a similar number of sequences in
each of the following classes of decreasing reproducibility:
CV<0.1, extremely reproducible; 0.1<CV<0.25, highly
reproducible; 0.25<CV<0.5, reproducible; 0.5<CV<0.75,
slightly reproducible; 0.75<CV<1, poorly reproducible;
CV>1, very poorly reproducible. The number of sequences
in these variability classes (Figure 1 and Additional file 5)
significantly differed between species (interaction term
CV Class*Species; F(20,96) = 1.99, p = 0.014). However,
Tukey's post-hoc test showed that the differences were
restricted to a greater number of sequences with CV below
0.1 in Macaca fascicularis than in Homo sapiens (p = 0.0109;
Figure 1), a difference that may be considered irrelevant.
Therefore, same-species analysis using human samples
neither yielded more reproducible results than cross-species analyses of samples from other mammals nor differed
in any relevant aspect. A comparison of human PM and
MM data yielded similar results. No significant differences
were observed in the number of sequences within each CV
class, between both sets of data (interaction term CV
class*PM/MM; F(5,48) = 1.536, p = 0.196; Figure 2), corroborating that sequence differences do not affect the distribution of the number of sequences in the defined
hybridization variability classes.

Identification of probe sequences yielding poorly
reproducible hybridization values
The next step in the study of the effects of cross-species
analyses on reproducibility was the identification of
probes that, due to features of their sequences or of their
hybridizations with the transcript, resulted in high
hybridization variability in any of the analysed species or
groups of species and to evaluate whether their number
changed in cross-species analyses. These probe sequences,
called throughout the text "un-reproducible probe
sequences" (UPS), were defined as sequences presenting
high hybridization CV in more samples than could arise
from a random combination of the CV values. UPS were
identified for all the species studied and for groups of
these species (all species, ALL; non-human species,
N.H.S.; primates, PRIMATES; non-human primates,
N.H.P.; and genus Macaca, MACACA). To identify UPSs
for a species or group of species, we calculated the probability of a sequence to present high CV values (over 1, 0.75
or 0.5) in n samples of each species or group of species.
The matrices detailing these probabilities are available in
the Additional file 6 and summarized in Figure 3. For any
given sequence, a probability below 0.01 was chosen to
define the maximum number of samples than may randomly present a high CV (see Additional file 6). p < 0.01
was chosen because it is the most widely used significance
limit. Other confidence limits will probably identify different probe sequences as UPS, but we are confident that
they would not change the relative proportions of UPS in
the different species or groups of species. We identified 19
sequences within this limit associated with CV>1, 35 with
CV>0.75 and 52 with CV>0.5, in any of the species or
groups of species defined, representing a fraction between
0.24 and 0.675 percent of the analysed sequences. Nearly
half of these UPSs yielded un-reproducible hybridizations

in both human and non-human species (Figure 3 and
Additional file 7). Almost the same number of UPS was
identified for primate (including human) samples, while
just a few sequences showed poor reproducibility
restricted to individual species or other groups of species.
A description of all UPS (including probe sequence, Affy
probe ID and Target according to Affymetrix and to
BLASTn), as well as the identity of the group in which
these sequences yielded high hybridization CVs, is available in the Additional file 8. Remarkably, many of the UPS
hybridized to the same transcripts. As a consequence,
while 52 sequences yielded un-reproducible hybridizations in any of the groups or species (associated to
CV>0.5), they corresponded to only 32 targets. Six of
them corresponded to non-human bacteria transcripts,
spiked in the hybridization mixture to measure array performance, 11 to poorly defined human targets and the
remaining 15 targets to clearly identified genes. The targets of the sequences yielding very poorly reproducible
hybridizations (those with CV>1) in all samples were, in
8 out of 10 cases, non-human spike probes, while the
remaining 2 sequences corresponded to poorly defined
human targets.

PM sequences yielding un-reproducible hybridizations
with human samples were also compared to the MM
sequences yielding un-reproducible hybridizations with
the same samples. These analyses showed that 15
sequences were associated to hybridizations with CV>1,
29 with CV>0.75, and 40 with CV over 0.5, either in PM
or MM sequences, or in both at the same time (Figure 4
and Additional file 7). The total number of sequences
identified as UPS in any of the three levels defined (CV>1,
0.75, or 0.5) rose to 43. Information on these sequences,
including nucleotide sequence, Affy probe ID and Target
according to Affymetrix and to BLASTn, as well as the
identity of the group is shown in Additional file 8. Some
of these sequences were repeated just once in the array,
but others were used in up to 7 probes. In many cases,
poorly reproducible MM sequences corresponded to
poorly reproducible PM sequences (12 out of 15 with
CV>1, 14 out of 29 with CV>0.75, and 27 out of 40 with
CV>0.5). The number of PM or MM sequences associated
to poorly reproducible hybridizations remained similar,
indicating that sequence differences between PM and MM
probes did not result in a different number of UPSs.
Affymetrix and BLAST-derived annotations showed that

whether the difference in hybridization CV for every
sequence in each species with respect to the human
hybridization CVs (data matrices available in the Additional file 9) was significantly greater than 0. The unexpected results showed that all analysed non-human
species yielded hybridization values significantly less variable i.e., more reproducible, than human hybridization
values (Figure 5a). To examine how relevant these differ-

ences were, we compared them graphically to the 90%

PM un-reproducible probe sequences (UPS) for the different species or groups of species. Results are detailed for
each species or group of species and for CV over 0.5, 0.75 and 1. Freq details the probability of a sequence to present a CV
over each boundary. NRR corresponds to non-random range and specifies the number of samples with a CV over a defined
value (0.5, 0.75 and 1) in a given sequence that cannot result from a random distribution of the hybridization values in each species of group of species. Seqs specifies the number of sequences yielding poorly reproducible hybridization in each species or
group of species. On the right side there is a graphic representation of the distribution of the UPS in the different species and
groups of species. Detailed description of the calculi and the intermediate data can be obtained from the Additional file 6.

the human samples. Taken together, these results indicate
that hybridization of non-human samples to the human
probes was not less reproducible than hybridization of
human samples. The observed differences in reproducibility may be considered trivial when compared to the internal variation of the human hybridizations. However, a
comparison of the human PM and MM hybridization variability yielded a totally different result. All MM and PM
comparisons-either mean or individual sample data-show
that MM hybridizations were significantly more variable
(less reproducible) than PM ones (see Figure 5b). Moreover, a graphic comparison of MM mean values and ranges
with the corresponding PM values shows that MM hybridization variability was in all cases undoubtedly greater
than PM hybridization variability and well beyond the
ranges defined by the human PM samples. Thus, it seems
that the sequence differences of MM probes cause a significant and appreciable decrease in hybridization reproducibility with respect to the PM probes.
Effect of hybridization level on reproducibility
According to previous authors [9,10,15,16], the most
important negative effect of cross-species analyses is the
reduction of microarray sensitivity, which, in turn, may
change its reproducibility [15]. To determine whether or
not hybridization signal and hybridization reproducibility are related, the correlation coefficient of mean hybridization values on hybridization CVs was calculated
independently for the samples of each species and for all
samples together. When all species samples were considered together, 5308 out of the 7736 repeated sequences
(68.6%) presented a negative correlation between mean
hybridization and hybridization CV, with mean correlation significantly below zero (p < 0.01, Student's t-test; see
Figure 6). This relationship stands still even when deer
data is excluded to avoid the effect that may result from its
large leverage (t = -4,209, D.F.= 7735; p < 0.01). This indicates that if the samples for all species are considered
together, the sequences present less reproducible hybridizations when their hybridization values are low. In contrast, analysis of individual species data yielded more
variable results. Only one species, Macaca mulatta, agreed
with the overall pattern, presenting a negative correlation
in 4709 sequences (60.9%) and a mean correlation below
zero, while the other primate species presented a more
even distribution of the correlation values, with approximately 57% of the sequences showing negative correlations (4337, 56.1%; 4429, 57.3%; 4378, 56.6%) and a
mean correlation that did not differ significantly from
zero. Cervus elaphus samples presented a mean positive
correlation, although not significantly different from zero
(see Figure 6), with just 3606 sequences (46.6%) presenting negative correlation between hybridization mean and
CV. Taken together, these data indicate that low hybridization values correlate with some decrease of reproduci-

bility, although such relationship stood only for
interspecies comparisons, not when comparisons were
restricted to individual species.

Discussion
We showed here that over 95% of the 7736 PM sequences
repeated in different probe sets of the human U133 plus
2.0 GeneChip, yielded reproducible hybridizations in all
the mammalian species analysed. Human and nonhuman samples presented a similar number of sequences
in different reproducibility categories, except for a minor
and irrelevant difference in the number of highly reproducible sequences between human and Macaca fascicularis
samples. Moreover, hybridization of non-human RNA on
human microarrays did not cause more sequences to be
associated to un-reproducible hybridizations than did
human RNA. Hybridization reproducibility was also similar across sequences, without relevant changes associated
to cross-species analyses being observed. These results
demonstrate that cross-species hybridizations of nonhuman mammalian samples to human U133 plus 2.0
GeneChip result in hybridization values that do not differ
in reproducibility from the hybridization values of the
human samples, even when analysing samples of species
as phylogenetically distant to Homo sapiens as Cervus elaphus.
Lack of effects of cross-species on hybridization reproducibility points that sequence differences between the transcripts of the sample and the probes of the array do not
result in changes in the reproducibility of the hybridization values with respect to fully complementary transcripts and probes. The reason underlying this result could
be related, in our opinion, to the behaviour of the transcript-probe duplexes. It is well established that the stability of a transcript-probe duplex depends on the base
sequence [26]. Under given physical and chemical hybridization conditions, any transcript-probe duplex will
present a specific stability that may be estimated from
knowledge of the number and identity of their complementary bases. Duplex stability determines the number of
transcripts that will be hybridized to the probes forming a
duplex. That is, for any given number and identity of the
complementary bases between transcript and probe, there
is a fixed probability for a transcript to be hybridized with
the probe forming a duplex. Thus, a smaller number of
complementary bases will result in a lower probability of
transcript-probe hybridization reducing the hybridization
signal, but not making it more variable. It is reasonable to
think that even cross-hybridization of the probes with
unspecific transcripts will follow this scheme. Thus, crosshybridization will increase the noise of the hybridization
value, but will not change the reproducibility of the data.
All these reasoning explains why regardless of the mammal species being analyzed, reproducibility of the hybrid-

ization values remains almost constant. This is perfectly
illustrated by our results from the deer analyses. Sequence
differences between the deer samples and the human
microarray cause a strong decrease in the hybridization
reflected in the fact that, after scaling, less than 10% of the
genes arrayed in the U133 plus 2.0 GeneChip are detected
as present (according to MAS 5.0 algorithm, data not
shown) but, as shown by our results, they do not cause
any significant change in the reproducibility of the
hybridization values.
Previous analysis of non-human primate and human gene
expression with human GeneChips showed reproducibility differences between same-species and cross-species
analyses [15,17]. These studies found that, although the
number of genes that change their detection call (presence
or absence of a transcript) across replicates (flux genes of
Chismar et al. [15]) was similar, there was a clear difference in the distribution of the variability between samespecies and cross-species analyses. Flux genes were more
associated to higher signal intensities in cross-species
analysis than in same-species ones [15]. As a result the
number of genes consistently detected across replicates
showed a significant decrease in cross-species analyses
(from 24 to 12% according to Wang et al. [17]) and the
size of the flux gene set as a percentage of the genes called
present became clearly higher in cross-species analyses
than in same-species analyses (27% vs. 17% in the analysis of [15]). The apparent contradiction of these observations and our results is probably due to the differences in

the data employed. In the present study, we have used raw
intensity values, whereas both Detection Call and Signal
Intensity are gene expression measures that summarize
the information on the probe level data after applying various analytical methods to the intensity values [27]. These
analytical methods imply the use of several algorithms to
normalize and quantify probe hybridization, followed by
the application of other algorithms to summarize the
information of the probes of each probeset into gene
expression values. The analytical methods most commonly used, such as MAS 5.0 [28], dChip [29] or RMA
(Robust Multi-chip Average [27]), differ in their approach
and performance and seem to affect the reproducibility of
the gene expression measures in both same-species and
cross-species analyses [15,17]. In fact, the reproducibility
of Detection Call and Signal Intensity appears to depend
on the algorithm employed, with RMA and dChip algorithms yielding more reproducible results than the
Affymetrix MAS5 [17]. Our study demonstrates, in this
respect, that the reproducibility differences of gene expression measures seen in some previous cross-species analyses [15,17] were not due to differences in hybridization
reproducibility. Rather, they were probably caused by the
processing of the hybridization data, that is, by the algorithms used to estimate the presence and abundance of
the transcripts. This conclusion may also explain why
cDNA microarrays do not show any change in the reproducibility of their gene expression measures when performing cross-species analyses [8,19], while Affymetrix
oligonucleotide microarrays do. Since cDNA microarrays

use just one probe per target, gene expression measures
are directly calculated from the intensity values of the
probe, without using any algorithm that may affect the
reproducibility of the estimates. It also could be that
cDNA microarrays yield reproducible gene expression
measures in cross-species analyses due to the use of long
stretches of nucleotide sequence (up to a complete open
reading frame), which would favour their specific hybridization with orthologous genes. However, as we have
demonstrated, short oligonucleotide probes also result in
reproducible hybridizations in cross-species analyses, in
agreement with some authors that have proposed that
results from individual oligonucleotide probes are as
reproducible as those from long cDNA probes [8]. In fact,
Agilent has been manufacturing oligonucleotide arrays for
years with either three 25 bases long oligonucleotides per
gene or one 60 bases long oligonucleotide per gene,
resulting in hundreds of published papers [9].
The analysis of the relationship between hybridization
value and coefficient of variation showed a negative correlation between both variables, i.e. high hybridization values were more reproducible than low hybridization
values. This correlation was found significant only when
the data from all species were analysed together, but not
when the analyses were restricted to individual species.
Thus, the correlation arises from the combination of
hybridization values and reproducibilities for different
species (Figure 6) because, for a given sequence, some species yield low and poorly reproducible hybridization values, while others yield high and very reproducible
hybridizations. A similar relationship between hybridization level and reproducibility of gene expression measures
was proposed by Chismar et al. [15] to explain the differences in reproducibility between same-species and crossspecies analyses. However, we have shown that human
same-species hybridizations do not differ in reproducibility from cross-species hybridizations. Moreover, all species yield similarly reproducible hybridizations despite
the presence of large differences in the hybridization values of the different species (mean hybridization value in
HSAP = 494.7, DEER = 264.6, CAET = 564.8, MFAS =
969.8, MMUL = 655.2). This raises the question of why
species give similarly reproducible hybridizations in spite
of their differences in hybridization values. Probably, the
differences in hybridization values are not high enough to
affect the reproducibility in a way that may be detected by
our analyses. The effects of hybridization level on reproducibility would be appreciable only if hybridization values from the different samples were very different. That
could be the case for individual probes, but it will never
cause the reproducibility of cross-species data to differ
from same-species data. Indeed, any comparison of the
expression profiles between two or more samples should
always pass through a process of scaling and normaliza-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/89

tion that would make the overall hybridization values
comparable [13].
The comparisons of the human PM and MM hybridization data show that they differ neither in reproducibility
category distribution nor in the number of sequences
associated to poorly reproducible hybridization values.
However, the hybridization values of MM sequences tend
to be less reproducible than the hybridization values of
their corresponding PM sequences. This result is probably
related to the negative relationship between the hybridization value and the coefficient of variation previously
discussed. Since, for each probe pair, MM values tend to
be smaller than PM values (at least, in same-species
hybridizations), their CV will tend to be slightly but systematically higher. However, MM data are difficult to
interpret. Affymetrix GeneChips include MM sequences to
quantify non-specific binding (i.e. hybridization with
RNAs different from the target), a value that is directly or
indirectly subtracted from the PM value in order to obtain
the specific probe hybridization measure [13,28,30].
However, MM hybridization values, besides measuring
non-specific binding, also measure hybridization with the
target [27], though diminished because of the nucleotide
sequence difference. Furthermore, the MM hybridization
value may under or overestimate non-specific binding
respect to the non-specific binding with the PM sequence.
Whatever the causes for MM reproducibility reduction, it
is clear that the uncertainties associated to MM hybridization affect the reproducibility of the derived gene expression measures. As a consequence, the analytical methods
that use PM and MM hybridization values to quantify specific hybridization with the target, also combine the variability of PM and MM hybridization measures, probably
reducing the reproducibility of the gene expression values
obtained. Thus, algorithms like RMA that use only PM
data will produce more reproducible expression measures
in cross-species analyses than dCHip and MAS 5.0, that
use both PM and MM data to measure gene expression, as
shown by Wang et al. [17]. Quantification of probe
hybridization from PM and MM intensity values seems to
be the critical step in the calculation of the expression
measures from raw intensity data, as concluded also by
Fan et al. [31].
Our analyses the effect of cross-species hybridization on
the number of un-reproducible probe sequences have
allow us to identify various probes yielding un-reproducible hybridizations in all samples, regardless of the species
of origin. Such probes produce hybridizations so variable
that should be considered useless for gene expression
analyses according to the criteria proposed by [19], and
therefore, their data are best eliminated from further calculations. The presence of probes yielding un-reproducible hybridizations highlights the need for a deeper

analysis of the probe features in order to improve the gene
expression data obtained from the GeneChip analyses.
Harbig et al. [32] reached a similar conclusion analysing
the targets of individual probes of GeneChip U133 plus
2.0. They demonstrated that about 37% of the probe targets of the U133 plus 2.0 array needed to be redefined. All
these results point that research in Affymetrix GeneChips
should not only concentrate on the mathematics of intensity data processing by developing new algorithms, but
also on the evaluation of the performance of the probes
themselves.

Conclusion
The results of the present study demonstrate that crossspecies analyses do not significantly affect the reproducibility of the hybridization data from Affymetrix GeneChips, at least analysing RNA from a mammal species
with another mammal species microarray. Differences in
the reproducibility of gene expression measurements
between same-species and cross-species analyses using
Affymetrix microarrays are more likely caused by the analytical methods used to calculate the gene expression
measurements from the hybridization data than by a
reduction on the reproducibility of the hybridization data
itself. These results, together with those from previous
authors [9,15,17,18], indicate that Affymetrix GeneChips
permit to obtain feasible hybridization data in cross-species analysis. However, they also make evident that choosing the appropriate algorithm to convert such
hybridization data into gene expression measures is a key
step in these analyses if we wish to preserve the quality of
the obtained hybridization data. In this respect, the variability of the MM hybridization values observed in this
study indicates that algorithms or analytical methods
combining PM and MM hybridization values to quantify
gene expression do result in a loss of reproducibility of the
obtained gene expression measures. MM probes can be
useful to identify and choose the most conserved probe
sequences in cross-species analyses but they become a
source of noise when quantifying gene expression. In the
course of our analyses, we have also identified several
probes yielding un-reproducible hybridizations. Hybridization data from these probes is so variable that should be
considered useless for gene expression analyses and therefore eliminated from further calculations or even from the
GeneChip. The presence of such un-reproducible probes
stresses the need of a re-evaluation of the probes performance in Affymetrix GeneChips.

Methods
Data for primates
Human and non-human primate gene expression data
comes from Dillman and Phillips study [18] and were
downloaded from GEO database of the NCBI ([33], accession number GSE2634; last accessed in November, 2005).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/89

Available files include Affymetrix raw data (.DAT, .CEL,
.EXP files) obtained after analysing with the Affymetrix
U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip®, RNA samples of whole blood
from Macaca fascicularis (4 samples, named here MFAS1
to 4, Table 2), Chlorocebus aethiops (4 samples, CAET1 to
4), Macaca mulatta (4 samples, MMUL1 to 4) and Homo
sapiens (5 samples, HSAP1 to 5).
Acquisition of data for deer
Deer tissue samples come from biopsies of an 8 year-old
male, kept at the Experimental Farm of the University of
Castilla-La Mancha (Albacete, Spain). Samples correspond to the soft tissues overlying bone (epidermis, dermis, periostium and derivatives) at different positions:
samples DEER1 and DEER4 are from the antler tip; sample DEER2 from the antler base or pedicle; and sample
DEER3 from over the frontal bone of the skull. DEER1,
DEER2 and DEER3 samples were harvested during the
period of maximal antler growth (60 days after casting the
previous antlers) while DEER4 was harvested at the end of
the antlers' growing period (120 days after casting). To
obtain the samples, the individual was kept in a hydraulic
restrainer and anesthetized with a low-dose combination
of xylazine (0.5 mg/kg of body weight; Calier, Barcelona,
Spain) and ketamine (1 mg/kg BW; Imalgene 100,
Menial, Lyon, France). After taking the samples, anaesthesia was reversed with yohimbine (0.25 mg/kg BW; SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Samples of the antler tip
(DEER1 and DEER4) were dissected using a sterile saw
blade while DEER2 and DEER3 samples were taken using
4 mm. diameter biopsy punches (Stiefel, Madrid, Spain).
All procedures were carried out by veterinaries and
approved by the ethic committees of the Spanish Science
Research Council and the Ministry of Environment. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80°C until
their processing. Frozen tissues were crushed in a mortar
cooled in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) and purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen,
Valen, CA, USA). RNA quality was assessed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels (Invitrogen Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide (EtBr, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). RNA
preparation, hybridization, staining, and scanning of the
GeneChip® U133 Plus 2.0 was carried out by the Progenika Biopharma laboratories (Derio, Spain)[34], following Affymetrix protocols. According to these
protocols, spike controls were added to the hybridization
mixtures to ensure the correct hybridization, washing,
developing and scanning of the GeneChips. CEL, .DAT,
and .EXP files of all 4 samples were obtained and
employed in the analyses. .CEL and .EXP files may be
downloaded from the GEO database [33] under the accession number GSE4064.

Probes
Information on Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip®
probes was downloaded from the Affymetrix website
([36] last accessed in November, 2005). The tab-delimited
text file thus obtained, details the sequence, position,
number, and probeset of all probes in the GeneChip®.
Additional information about the targets of the probes
was obtained from the Affymetrix database at NetAffx web
page ([37] last accessed in March, 2006) and from the
NCBI databases searched using the nucleotide-nucleotide
BLAST (BLASTn [38]) program of the NCBI ([39] last
accessed in March, 2006).
Statistical analyses
All above information about each probe and their hybridization values with the different samples were exported to
a FileMaker Pro 5.5 database (FileMaker Inc., Santa Clara,
CA, USA). The search tool of FileMaker was employed to
identify all the sequences repeated in more than 1 probe
(caution recommended, because FileMaker Pro 5.5
employs only the first 21 characters to carry out the search
and thus it may recognize as repeated, sequences that differ in their last 4 bases). Probe information and hybridization values of all repeated sequences were exported to
an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) to
be formatted before its analysis with the Statistica 6.0
package (Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA) (see Additional file
1). Normality of repeated hybridization values was
assessed in the sequences repeated more than 6 times,
using Shapiro-Wilk W, Kolmogorov Smirnoff and Lilliefors tests (Additional file 2; for comparison of the different methods; see [40] and Statistica help). For each
repeated sequence in the GeneChip, Statistica was used to
calculate the number of replicas and the mean, standard
deviation and coefficient of variation (CV) of the hybridization values for each RNA sample (see Additional file 3).
PM and MM data were treated as independent samples.

The variability of the repeated hybridization measures was
used to estimate hybridization reproducibility. Different
measurements may be used to describe the variability of
single values on repeated trials [14,24,25], but according
to Hopkins [14], within-subject standard deviation is the
most appropriate one. However, when standard deviation
depends on the size of the measure, the coefficient of variation (CV) should be employed instead. Because in our
dataset, the standard deviation correlated significantly
with the mean (Kendall Tau over 0.3, p < 0.05 in all samples, see Additional file 4), CV was chosen as a measure of
hybridization variability among replicas in all the analy-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/89

ses. CV data of the repeated PM sequences were used to
compare the reproducibility in same and cross-species
analyses. To further test the effect of sequence differences
on hybridization reproducibility, we also carried out the
same analyses comparing CV data for repeated perfect
match (PM) and mismatch (MM) sequences in the
human samples. Description of the statistical procedures
of the analyses is based in the comparison of the PM data
from the different species. The comparisons of the human
PM and MM hybridizations dataset were carried out in the
same way unless specified.
To test whether cross-species hybridizations affected the
distribution of the hybridization reproducibility, the
number of sequences in each of the following classes of
decreasing reproducibility was calculated: CV<0.1,
extremely reproducible; 0.1<CV<0.25, highly reproducible; 0.25<CV<0.5, reproducible; 0.5<CV<0.75, slightly
reproducible; 0.75<CV<1, poorly reproducible; CV>1,
very poorly reproducible. Then, the number of sequences
in each class across species (detailed in Additional file 5)
was compared using a two-way ANOVA, followed by an
unequal number of samples post-hoc Tukey's test. Species
and CV classes were used as independent factors in the
analysis.
Probe sequences associated to irreproducible or poorly
reproducible hybridizations – "un-reproducible probe
sequences" (UPS) – were defined as sequences presenting
high hybridization CV in more samples of a species than
could result from a random combination of the CV values. Three levels of variation (CV>1, >0.75 and >0.5) were
set as the boundaries of poor reproducibility. The probability of a sequence presenting a CV>X in n samples randomly was calculated based on a binomial (Bernoulli)
probability distribution. First, pCV>X, the probability that a
sequence in one sample presented a CV>X was estimated
as the mean number of sequences (across all samples)
with CV>X divided by the total number of sequences
(7736). pCV>X was then used to calculate the probability of
a sequence to present a CV>X in n samples (psqy, CV>X, n),
using the equation:
psqy, CV>X, n = Cm, n [(pCV>X)n(1-pCV>X)m-n]
where Cm, n represents the number of combinations of a
set of m objects taken n at a time and is given by Cm, n=
[(n!)/(r!(n - r)!)], where m is the total number of samples
in the species or group of species considered, and n the
number of samples with CV>X. The probability that at
least one of the 7736 sequences analysed presents n samples with CV>X (PCV>X) was calculated as: PCV>X, n = 1-(1psqy, CV>X, n)7736. The probability values obtained from
these calculations were used to determine the number of
samples that may randomly present a CV>X. A probability

below 0.01 was chosen to define the maximum number
of samples that may randomly present a CV>X. These calculations were made for all species (4 samples in each
non-human species and 5 human samples), and for the
groups of species that follow: all species (ALL), nonhuman species (N.H.S.), primates (PRIMATES), nonhuman primates (N.H.P.) and genus Macaca (MACACA).
The maximum number of samples that may randomly
present CV>X for each species or group of species was calculated for the three levels of CV defined and used to identify un-reproducible probe sequences for each species or
group of species. However, a probe sequence may present
high CVs in samples from different species or groups of
species. To precise in which of the species or groups of
species of those listed above is the sequence associated to
poorly reproducible hybridizations, we have used the following criteria: i) a probe sequence will be considered unreproducible for a given group, if that group shows more
samples with CV>X than randomly expected (p < 0.01)
and the sequence is also considered un-reproducible for
all species within the group or for none of them; ii) a
sequence is not considered un-reproducible for a group, if
the sequence shows more samples with CV>X than randomly expected (p < 0.01) for the group but also for only
one subgroup or species within that group. In such a case,
the probe sequence is considered un-reproducible for that
species or subgroup; finally, iii) when a sequence is considered un-reproducible for two or more species, so it is
for the smallest group that contains those species.
Although these criteria are not absolute and other criteria
would result in different assignations, we are confident
that the overall results will not vary significantly. Description of the targets of identified UPS was obtained from
Affymetrix analysis site (NetAffx [37]) and from the
GeneBank EST sequences using the nucleotide-nucleotide
BLAST (BLASTn) from the NCBI BLAST webpage [39].
For the analysis of the effect of sequence differences on the
values of the hybridization variability, the mean CV for
every PM sequence in each species was first calculated,
and the data used to determine the difference in hybridization CV for every sequence in each species with respect
to the human hybridization CVs (data matrices available
in the Additional file 9). One-tailed t test was employed to
determine whether or not the differences between the CV
for each species and the human CVs were significantly
greater than 0. To examine how relevant these differences
were, interquartile and 5 to 95 percentile ranges were calculated for the CV differences between every species and
the human and were compared graphically to the differences between human sample CVs and the mean human
CVs (Figure 5). When evaluating whether the hybridization variability of the MM sequences was significantly
larger than the variability of their corresponding PM

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/89

sequences, individual sample PM and MM data together
with mean data were also compared.
The possible relation between hybridization variation and
hybridization signal was explored by calculating the correlation between hybridization CV and mean hybridization value in all repeated sequences. The correlation
coefficient between both variables was computed for the
samples of each individual species and for all samples
together. Student's t-test was used to check whether or not
overall correlation coefficients in each case were significantly different from zero.
