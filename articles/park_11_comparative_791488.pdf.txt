Abstract
Background: Among the Solanaceae plants, the pepper genome is three times larger than that of tomato.
Although the gene repertoire and gene order of both species are well conserved, the cause of the genome-size
difference is not known. To determine the causes for the expansion of pepper euchromatic regions, we compared
the pepper genome to that of tomato.
Results: For sequence-level analysis, we generated 35.6 Mb of pepper genomic sequences from euchromatin
enriched 1,245 pepper BAC clones. The comparative analysis of orthologous gene-rich regions between both
species revealed insertion of transposons exclusively in the pepper sequences, maintaining the gene order and
content. The most common type of the transposon found was the LTR retrotransposon. Phylogenetic comparison
of the LTR retrotransposons revealed that two groups of Ty3/Gypsy-like elements (Tat and Athila) were overly
accumulated in the pepper genome. The FISH analysis of the pepper Tat elements showed a random distribution
in heterochromatic and euchromatic regions, whereas the tomato Tat elements showed heterochromatinpreferential accumulation.
Conclusions: Compared to tomato pepper euchromatin doubled its size by differential accumulation of a specific
group of Ty3/Gypsy-like elements. Our results could provide an insight on the mechanism of genome evolution in
the Solanaceae family.

Background
The Solanaceae is an unusually divergent family consisting of approximately 90 genera and 3,000-4,000 species
[1]. Members of the Solanaceae have evolved into extremely divergent forms, ranging from trees to annual
herbs, and they occupy diverse habitats ranging from
deserts to aquatic areas [1]. Such hyper-diversity in one
family makes it useful to study plant adaptation and
diversification. Despite this diversity, all Solanaceous
species evolved during the last 40 million years [2].

Furthermore, almost all members share the same chromosome number (x = 12) [2].
To date, diversity within the Solanaceae has been studied by comparative genome analyses using common
genetic markers. As a result, we know that the Solanaceae genomes have undergone relatively small numbers
of chromosomal rearrangements (e.g., about 5 rearrangements between potato and tomato and about 30 rearrangements between pepper and tomato), maintaining
well-conserved gene content and order [3-8]. The conservation of the Solanaceae genic region was also identified by the comparison of a syntenic segment in
eggplant, pepper, petunia and tomato [7].
Despite such conservation, the genome sizes of the
Solanaceae family members are diverse. For example,
the genome size of the Solanum tuberosum (potato) is

840 Mb, S. lycopersicum (tomato) 950 Mb, Petunia
hybrida (petunia) 1200 Mb, and Capsicum annuum
(pepper) 2700 Mb. However, the genetic analyses conducted to date were not successful at explaining genome
size diversity due to limitations in the genetic markers.
Hence, a sequence-level analysis to investigate the cause
of the genome size diversity is required.
Among the Solanaceous species, pepper and tomato
show strong advantages for the study of genome size
difference because of following reasons. First, the genome size of pepper is three times larger than that of
tomato. Second, the duplication of the whole genome
did not occur during the evolution of both species [8].
Third, although pepper and tomato show large size differences in their genomes, their speciation is estimated
to have occurred recently (approximately 16.2-22.2 million years ago) [7], which makes them not as closely
related as potato and tomato, but more closely related
than tobacco and tomato within the Solanaceae family
[9]. Therefore, the investigation of genome diversity
between pepper and tomato can represent the general
trend of genome diversification among Solanaceous
members that have not undergone the whole genome
duplication.
To date, most studies related to the pepper genome
have been carried out by generating genetic maps
[6,10-14]. In contrast, the structure of the tomato
euchromatic and heterochromatic regions has been the
subject of several studies through the analyses of tomato
BAC sequences [15-17]. Furthermore, the tomato genome sequencing project is currently underway, with the
goal of generating a reference genome in the Solanaceae
[18-21].
As a first study concerning the expansion of the pepper genome, the present work addresses the causes
behind the expansion of pepper euchromatic regions.
For this purpose, 35.6 Mb of pepper sequences from
1,245 BAC clones selected from euchromatin-enriched
regions were generated. Using information from the
tomato genome project, 39.9 Mb BAC sequences of
tomato were chosen for comparing orthologous generich sequences and the constitution of repetitive elements between the pepper and tomato genomes. We
used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to support the results. This study presents an example of the
Solanaceae genome diversity revealing how the pepper
euchromatic region was expanded.

Results
Sequencing of pepper BAC clones

To produce the pepper sequence data representative of
all pepper euchromatic regions, 1,235 pepper BAC
clones of an average insert size of 130 Kb [22] were
sequenced using pyrosequencing technology. To enrich

Page 2 of 13

the euchromatic regions, BAC clones were selected by
BAC screening using labelled cDNAs derived from pepper mRNAs (extracted from flower, fruit, stem and leaf).
A total of 90.8 Mb of assembled sequences was obtained
from 18.22× coverage sequences generated by 454 GS
FLX-Titanium (454 Life Science, Roche). To avoid the
bias caused by the short contig length, we used the long
contigs, whose length is over 30 Kb (total length is 34.6
Mb), in the analyses (Figure 1). In addition, ten selected
pepper BAC clones containing gene-rich regions of pepper chromosome 2 were sequenced using Sanger methods, resulting in a total of 985,237 bp contig sequences
(see Additional file 1). Three of the ten BAC sequences
were assembled into one contig, resulting in a total of
eight full-contig BAC sequences. These eight full-contig
BAC sequences were used in the comparative microsynteny analysis of pepper and tomato euchromatic
regions.
Comparison of visible genome structures

Prior to the comparative sequence analysis between pepper and tomato, we analyzed visible chromosome structures in pepper and tomato using pachytene
chromosomes. On visual inspection, the pepper and
tomato chromosomes showed differences in structure.
The tomato heterochromatic regions were mainly
located on the pericentromeric regions and the euchromatic regions were clearly distinct from the heterochromatin structure (Figure 2A). In contrast, the pepper
pachytene chromosomes showed more extensive

heterochromatic regions (Figure 2B). Furthermore, the
pepper euchromatic regions were intermixed with the
heterochromatin structure (Figure 2B; indicated by
arrows).
Comparison of repetitive elements in the orthologous
gene-rich regions

To investigate the reasons for the presence of differences in euchromatin structure between both genomes,
the orthologous gene-rich sequences of pepper and
tomato were compared. To compare within the same
chromosome, the orthologous gene-rich sequences were
selected in chromosome 2 that has no inter-chromosomal crossover between both species [8]. BAC sequences
distributed over seven positions in chromosome 2 were
used to avoid bias based on position within the chromosome (Figure 3 and Additional file 1). The positions of
the BAC sequences were determined using genetic markers on the tomato genetic map (tomato-EXPEN 2000,
http://sgn.cornell.edu/) [23]. On the basis of tomato
chromosome 2, the centromere is located at the top (0
CM) of the tomato genetic map (Figure 3) [15]. Eight
orthologous pepper BAC sequences of a total of 985,237
bp were compared with the tomato sequences consisting
of 490,745 bp (Table 1).
The comparative analysis of the orthologous gene-rich
sequences revealed many insertions found exclusively in
the pepper sequences. The insertions were transposable
elements, and there were 35 transposable elements in

the compared pepper sequences (Figure 3; colored
boxes and Additional file 2). Boundary of the LTR-retrotransposons was determined in 16 elements by manual
inspection (Figure 3; marked with asterisks in the
colored boxes). The else transposons were found by
gene prediction and repeat BLAST search in Repbase
[24,25]. All of the transposable elements were found in
the inter-genic regions, therefore without a disruption of
the other structural genes. The insertion of the transposable elements resulted in a doubling of the pepper
sequence size in comparison to that of tomato. Accordingly, the gene density was lower in pepper (13,136 bp
per one gene) than in tomato (7,011 bp per one gene).
To determine the most prevalent type of transposon,
the composition of the repetitive elements found in the
compared sequences was analyzed. By repeat BLAST
search in Repbase, a total of 191,393 bp of transposon
sequences were found in pepper and 44,336 bp in
tomato. The repeat sequences were classified into three
groups (Figure 4).
Among identified transposable elements, LTR-retrotransposon sequences were the most abundant. Most of
the LTR-retrotransposons were found in the pepper
sequences (Figure 4). In addition, 28 of the 35 transposable elements found in pepper sequences were identified as LTR retrotransposons. The pepper sequences
contained LTR-retrotransposon sequences with a frequency approximately 22 times higher than in the
tomato sequences. The other two repeat classes also

presented higher proportions in pepper than in tomato.
Pepper had about 1.7 times as many DNA transposons,
4 times the number of non-LTR retrotransposons
(Figure 4).
According to our transposon annotation results, the
total length of the transposons found was 210,341 bp
(see Additional file 2). Among them, Ty3/Gypsy-like element was the most abundant as 134,523 bp in total
length (approximately 64% of the annotated repeats),
which suggests its important role in pepper euchromatin

expansion. The next was Ty1/Copia-like elements as
55,173 bp (approximately 26% of the annotated repeats).
The Non-LTR retrotransposon and DNA transposon
was 12,159 bp and 5,486 bp, respectively.
Similar gene composition between pepper and tomato

In contrast to the repetitive elements, gene constitution
less affected the difference in the sequence size. In the
compared sequences, a total of 145 genes were predicted
excluding the transposable element genes. These

included 75 pepper genes and 70 tomato genes (Table 1).
The total length of the genes combined was 247,338 bp
in pepper and 195,342 bp in tomato, showing a length
difference of 51,996 bp. The total gene-length difference
corresponded to approximately 10% of the total length
difference of the compared sequences. The total genelength difference was mainly caused by the intronlength difference. A total of 136 out of 145 genes were
paired into 56 orthologous sets (see Additional file 2).
In these sets the average length of the pepper coding
regions was 1,366 bp, which was 34 bp longer than that
of tomato (1,332 bp), whereas the average intron length
in pepper was 1,815 bp, which was 356 bp longer than
that of tomato (1,459 bp). Among the 56 orthologous
sets, six sets (10.7%) consisted of duplicated genes.
These six sets corresponded to 37 of the 145 genes
(25%), of which 18 genes were in pepper and 19 in

most significant difference.

tomato (see Additional file 3). Hence, there was no
remarkable bias in gene duplication number between
both species (Table 1).
Identification of LTR retrotransposons in the pepper and
tomato genome sequences

The causes for the accumulation of LTR retrotransposons in the pepper euchromatic regions were investigated by comparing the overall constitution of LTR
retrotransposons between pepper and tomato by phylogenetic analysis. For this analysis, reverse transcriptase
(RT) sequences, which are constitutive genes in LTR
retrotransposons [26], were identified from the pepper
and tomato genome sequences. The RTs were classified
into Ty3/Gypsy and Ty1/Copia types by BLAST search
in Repbase [24,25]. A total of 155 Ty3/Gypsy-like and
166 Ty1/Copia-like tomato RTs were identified from
39.9 Mb of tomato BAC sequences (http://sgn.cornell.
edu/about/tomato_sequencing.pl; downloaded in August,
2008) and 312 Ty3/Gypsy-like and 48 Ty1/Copia-like
pepper RTs were found in the 35.6 Mb pepper BAC
sequences. Because the tomato genome project focused
on the gene-rich region, the number of heterochromatin-preferential LTR retrotransposons might be underestimated in this comparison.
Differential accumulation of a group of Ty3/Gypsy-like
elements

The phylogenetic tree of Ty3/Gypsy-like elements was
generated by 312 pepper and 155 tomato RTs. A total
of three subgroups were clearly identified from the phylogenetic tree (Figure 5). Each subgroup was classified
on the basis of reported elements by BLAST search
against GyDB (http://gydb.org/). The BLAST results
with high confidence (e-value below e-40) were used for
classification reference [27]. The representative elements
of each subgroup which are acquired from the GyDB
were also included in the phylogenetic tree. According
to the classification, the three groups belonged to Tat
and Athila subgroups, which belong to Athila/Tat, and
to Del subgroup, which belongs to chromoviruses. Most
of the Ty3/Gypsy-like elements were found in the three
major subgroups.
The Ty3/Gypsy-like elements in the Del subgroup
were identified as being accumulated in the pericentromeric heterochromatin. Yang et al. reported that the
PCRT1 in the Del subgroup is a tomato Ty3/Gypsy-like
element distributed throughout pericentromeric heterochromatin of tomato [16]. This result was consistent
with our FISH result of another tomato Del element
(Figure 5; indicated by yellow triangle). Furthermore, the
FISH result of the pepper Del element exhibited the
same distribution pattern as that of tomato (Figure 5;
indicated by purple triangle). These results suggest that

Park et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:85

the Del elements constitute pericentromeric heterochromatin in both genomes, which means they do not affect
euchromatin expansion.
The differences that may affect the expansion of pepper
euchromatic regions were observed in the Tat and Athila
subgroups. The number of pepper Tat and Athila elements was approximately twice the number in tomato
(42 in pepper and 23 in tomato). According to the previous report by Yang et al., PCRT2 and PCRT3 are the
tomato Ty3/Gypsy-like elements preferentially distributed in the tomato heterochromatic regions [16]. These
two elements belonged to Athila and Tat respectively,
suggesting that the tomato Ty3/Gypsy-like elements in
these groups are accumulated in heterochromatic
regions. In contrast, the FISH result of the pepper Tat
element showed randomly distributed signals throughout
the pepper chromosomes including the euchromatic
regions (Figure 5; indicated by green triangle). Furthermore, four of the nine black arrows indicating the pepper
Ty3/Gypsy-like elements found in the compared pepper
gene-rich sequences belonged to Tat. Likewise, two of
the nine elements belonged to the Athila subgroup, indicating the elements in this group are also found in pepper gene-rich regions. However, the Del subgroup didn’t
contain any of the Ty3/Gypsy-like elements found in the
pepper gene-rich sequences (Figure 5). These results
show that, in contrast to the distribution in tomato, the
pepper Ty3/Gypsy-like elements in the Tat and Athila
subgroups are randomly inserted throughout the whole
genome, including the euchromatic regions.
Chromodomains in the Ty3/Gypsy-like elements

A chromodomain functions to recognize the heterochromatic regions when the Ty3/Gypsy-like elements insert
into chromosomes [28,29]. To determine the chromatin
selectivity of the Ty3/Gypsy-like elements, the existence
of the chromodomain was investigated in each group.
For this analysis, 72 intact Ty3/Gypsy-like elements were
identified from the pepper and tomato sequences to
check the chromodomain (see Additional file 4). Except
for the Tat and Athila elements, almost all of the other
intact Ty3/Gypsy-like elements contained the chromodomain (Figure 6A; filled dots, Additional file 5). The
existence of the chromodomain in the Del intact elements was consistent with the heterochromatin-preferential accumulation of the Del elements in both species.
Likewise, the absence of the chromodomain in Tat and
Athila was consistent with the random accumulation of
pepper elements. However, the absence of the chromodomain was in disagreement with the anticipated heterochromatin-preferential accumulation of tomato Tat
and Athila elements.
To determine whether the tomato Tat and Athila elements are really accumulated in the heterochromatic

Page 7 of 13

regions in sequence-level, we investigated gene densities
of the 17 tomato BAC sequences that contain the Tat
and Athila elements (see Additional file 6). Two of the
17 tomato BAC sequences were gene-rich regions with
a gene density similar to that of the compared tomato
gene-rich sequences (Figure 7). However, the remaining
15 BAC sequences were gene-poor regions, in which the
minimum gene density was about three times lower
than that of the compared tomato gene-rich sequences.
Considering that the tomato sequences are mainly from
euchromatic regions, the accumulation of the tomato
Tat and Athila elements shows a bias toward the heterochromatic regions. This result was consistent with the
heterochromatin preferential distributions of the PCRT2
and PCRT3, indicating that the tomato Tat and Athila
elements are accumulated in heterochromatic regions
without the chromodomain.
Proportion of the intact pepper Ty3/Gypsy-like elements
in the genome

The proportion of the pepper Ty3/Gypsy-like elements
in the genome was estimated using the intact LTR retrotransposons (see methods for detail) (Figure 6B). The
proportion of the individual elements was broadly different according to the classified groups. The average proportion of the Tat elements was 1.28% but the Athila
was 0.64%, suggesting more active accumulation of the
Tat elements. The elements in the Del showed higher
proportion than other classified groups in the genome
as 2.01% of average proportion.
Highly diversified features with similar lineage collections
of Ty1/Copia-like elements

The phylogenetic tree of Ty1/Copia-like elements presented highly diversified features that differed from
those of Ty3/Gypsy-like elements. However they also
showed similar lineage collections between pepper and
tomato. By blast search against GyDB, four subgroups
of the Ty3/Copia-like elements, Tork, Sire, Oryco, and
Retrofit, were classified (Figure 8). The Tork was constituted with four subgroups that match to Fourf,
Tork4, Tnt-1, and Batata. The six pepper Ty1/Copialike elements found in the eight orthologous pepper
BAC sequences are indicated by black arrows in Figure 8.
These six elements belonged to diverse phylogenetic
positions in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 8). One of
the six pepper elements that belongs to the Retrofit
was tested by FISH analysis, and the signals distributed
randomly on the chromosomes (Figure 8; indicated by
red triangle). The FISH signals of the tomato Ty1/
Copia-like element that belongs to the Tork4 of the
Tork subgroup were also observed in both brightly and
darkly stained chromosome regions, indicating its distribution in heterochromatic and euchromatic regions

distribution (Figure 8; indicated by orange and pink
triangle).

Discussion
The results of the present study revealed that one of the
important factors for the expansion of pepper euchromatic regions was the massive accumulation of the pepper Tat and Athila elements. In the Tat and Athila

subgroups, the Ty3/Gypsy-like elements were found to
be approximately two times more abundant in pepper
than tomato. Considering that the pepper sequences
used in this study were smaller than those of tomato in
terms of total length (three-quarters of tomato) and in
each contig length (Figure 1), the number of pepper Tat
and Athila elements would further exceed that of
tomato. Given that the tomato Tat and Athila elements
preferentially accumulated in the heterochromatic
regions (Figure 7), the higher copy number and random
insertion of the pepper Tat and Athila elements suggests
their important role in the expansion of pepper euchromatic regions.

Figure 7 The gene density of the tomato BAC sequences
containing the Tat and Athila elements. Gene-density of the
seventeen tomato BAC sequences containing the Tat and Athila
elements is presented. The gene density of the ‘Gene-rich region’
depicted by the gray column indicates the average gene density of
the compared tomato gene-rich sequences. The gene number was
counted with the exception of the transposable element genes. The
gene density of the fifteen BAC sequences was lower than that of
the gene-rich region by at least three times. The gene-density of
the remaining two BAC sequences was similar to that of the generich region. No genes were found in the C08SLe0111P08.1 and
C08HBa0074F18.1.

According to the FISH analyses, the Del elements in
both pepper and tomato genomes were identified as
forming the pericentromeric heterochromatin blocks.
Unlike the Ty1/Copia-like elements, the Ty3/Gypsy-like
elements that constitute pericentromeric heterochromatin blocks are known to be selectively inserted into the
heterochromatic regions in A. thaliana [30]. The existence of the chromodomain in both pepper and tomato
Del intact elements can explain this insertion selectivity.
The insertion site preferences of LTR retrotransposons
have also been observed in other plant genomes, including conifers, and members of the genus Helianthus
[31,32]. Although the number of Del elements is predominant in the phylogenetic tree, accumulation of the
Del elements would have expanded the pericentromeric
heterochromatin, not affecting euchromatin expansion
in both species.
Pereira reported that the Ty1/Copia-like elements in
A. thaliana were randomly inserted into the whole genome, after which they underwent purifying selection in
euchromatic regions [30]. This resulted in the preferential accumulation of the Ty1/Copia-like elements in the
pericentromeric heterochromatin blocks of A. thaliana
genome. In the present study, a similar phenomenon
was detected in the heterochromatin preferential accumulation of the tomato Ty3/Gypsy-like elements that
belong to Tat and Athila (Figure 7). The absence of the
chromodomain in the elements indicates its initial random insertions in the genome. However, the purifying
selection may have been eliminated the tomato Tat and

Page 9 of 13

Athila elements from the tomato euchromatic regions,
resulting in their preferential accumulation in the heterochromatic regions.
The comparative analysis of the LTR retrotransposons
in the present study revealed a similar collection of
lineages in both Ty3/Gypsy-like and Ty1/Copia-like elements. Given that the LTR retrotransposons of the same
lineage have similar characteristics, both genomes would
have accumulated the Ty1/Copia-like elements and Ty3/
Gypsy-like elements of the Tat and Athila in their
euchromatic regions. However, the copy number of the
elements in the tomato euchromatic regions may have
been reduced due to the purifying selection, which
could have resulted in the lower accumulation of the
LTR retrotransposons in the tomato euchromatic
regions than in those of pepper.
The number of pepper Del elements corresponded to
twice the number of tomato Del elements (256 in pepper and 122 in tomato). This difference was partially
due to the euchromatin selective sequencing of the
tomato genome project. Although the pepper BAC
clones were selected by the labelled cDNAs of mRNAs,
our bioinformatics survey suggested that a large portion
of pepper BAC clones contained heterochromatic
regions. This phenomenon can be caused by contamination with the transcripts of repetitive elements, such as
retrotransposons, during the selection of the BAC
clones.
The expansion of genome sizes through the accumulation of LTR retrotransposons is well documented among
flowering plants [30,33-35]. Based on the results of the
present study, the expansion of the pepper genome is
also due to the accumulation of LTR retrotransposons.
A similar comparative analysis of repetitive elements in
close species was carried out between A. thaliana and
Brassica oleracea by Zang et al. [36]. Zang et al.
reported that the large size of the B. oleracea genome is
accounted by the higher copy number of each type of
transposable elements within a similar collection of
lineages, explaining the overall genome expansion [36].
However, the gene densities of both genomes were 4.5
kb/gene in A. thaliana and 6.6 kb/gene in B. oleracea
[37], indicating that the euchromatic regions of both
genomes are highly gene-rich, as is the case in tomato.
In contrast with B. oleracea, pepper has an expanded
euchromatin structure, and the present results explained
the expansion of the euchromatic regions. Hence, the
comparison of the pepper and tomato genomes can provide new insights into the expansion of euchromatic
regions by the accumulation of repetitive elements.

Conclusions
The results of the present study show that the Ty3/
Gypsy-like elements in the Tat and Athila play an

Copia-like elements were used in generating the phylogenetic tree. The pepper and tomato Ty1/Copia-like elements are depicted by red and
blue lines, respectively. Classified types of each subgroup are depicted by green letters. The RTs used as FISH probes are marked with triangles
(red, pink, orange, and blue triangles). The FISH result for of the probes is indicated by the dotted lines (see text for details). The black arrows

important role in the expansion of the pepper euchromatic regions. The genic regions of pepper and tomato
were found to be well conserved with regards to gene
order and content. However, the euchromatic regions in
pepper were expanded to twice the size of those in
tomato, mainly due to the insertion of LTR retrotransposons. The LTR retrotransposons in the pepper
euchromatic regions may also explain why the pepper

euchromatic regions look like intermixed with the heterochromatin structures.

Methods
Sequencing of the pepper and tomato BAC clones

The selection of pepper BAC clones for the comparison
of the orthologous gene-rich regions was performed as
described in this section: seven tomato BAC sequences

Park et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:85
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/85

that are distributed on chromosome 2 were chosen. The
tomato sequences were used as queries in a BLASTN
search of the pepper EST database to find orthologous
pepper ESTs. Two or three pepper ESTs that were
orthologous to sequences about 30 kb apart in each
tomato BAC clone were used as probes. The probes
were labelled via PCR amplification using specific primers and 32 P-labeled dCTP. Seven or eight labelled
probes were pooled, and the Southern hybridizations
were carried out on pepper BAC library filters. The filters were sequentially washed in 2 X SSC for 60 min, 1
X SSC for 60 min, and 0.5 X SSC 60 min. The positive
clones were confirmed by colony PCR using the same
primers. The pepper BAC clones that showed positive
PCR results were used for sequencing. Each BAC clone
was fully sequenced and analyzed by NICEM (http://
nicem.snu.ac.kr/) using the ABI 3730xl system (Applied
Biosystems Inc [ABI], Foster City, CA). From each pepper BAC clone, a shotgun sequencing library was constructed using the pUC118 vector with an average insert
size of 3-5 kb. BigDye Terminator chemistry version 3.1
(ABI) was used for the sequencing reactions. All of the
sequences were analyzed by Phred/Pharp/Consed processing [38]. Base-calling and assembling of the
sequences were carried out using the Phred/Phrap software. The Phred scores of the sequences were 30 or
higher. The assembled sequences were edited using
Consed software. Sequence editing for consensus contig
formation was carried out using the Sequencher 4.1.5
(Gene codes Corp., Ann Arbor, USA). The tomato BAC
sequences were generated by the same method as part
of the International Tomato Sequencing Project of
Korea [20].
A total of 1,235 pepper BAC clones were additionally
selected for next-generation sequencing using 454 GS
FLX-Titanium (454 Life Science, Roche). Each BAC
clone DNA was manually extracted and normalized.
The normalized BAC clone DNAs were pooled into 125
clones per a reaction channel of 454 GS FLX-Ti. Each
sequencing reaction of 454 GS FLX-Ti was divided into
two. The sequencing procedures for the 454 GS FLX-Ti
were carried out using manufacturer-supplied protocols
and reagents. The sequences were assembled by Newbler 2.0.1. The average coverage of the contigs was
18.22×. Among the assembled contigs, the contigs
longer than 30 kb were used in the analyses.
Gene prediction and comparative analysis

For accurate gene structure analysis, we predicted genes
using three steps as follows: (1) Genes were predicted
by FGENESH using a trained data set from tomato [39].
(2) The predicted genes were confirmed by BLASTP
searches of the GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/) using the protein sequences of the predicted

Page 11 of 13

genes as queries. Among the predicted genes, those with
scores greater than 100 and e-values less than e-20 were
used in the next step. (3) Among the BLASTP results
for each predicted gene, the protein sequence that had
the highest score was chosen as a reference, and the
gene models were predicted again by FGENESH+ using
the trained data set from tomato. These results were
used as gene models for the pepper and tomato
sequences. The visualization of compared orthologous
sequences was carried out using GATA [40] with minimum bits of 30 and maximum bits of 35.6. The repeat
sequences were found by BLAST search in the Repbase
repeat masking (http://girinst.org/censor/index.php)
[24,25].
Phylogenetic analysis of LTR retrotransposons

The RTs were found by Hmmer 2.1 [41] using the RTs
reported in the Pfam database (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/,
Accession No. PF00078 and PF07727) as a training set.
The super family of the RTs was determined by the
Rebase repeat masking. The RTs were confirmed by
BLASTP searches in the GenBank database, and the
RTs with a score over 200 were used in the analyses.
The RTs containing any frame shift mutations or deletions were manually deleted in the alignment. Intact
LTR retrotransposons were predicted using LTR_FINDER [42] with the default settings or by manual inspection using DOT-PLOT analysis. These analyses were
conducted in the environment of the Comparative Fungal Genomics Platform (CFGP; http://cfgp.snu.ac.kr/)
[43].
The phylogenetic trees were generated using the
MEGA 4.0 software [44]. The alignments were carried
out using ClustalW of MEGA 4.0 with the default settings (see Additional file 7, 8 and 9). The aligned RT
sequences were used for generating the phylogenetic
trees. The Poisson correction model and Neighbor-Joining method were used, and the phylogeny test was carried out by bootstrapping with 1,000 replications.
Chromodomain search and proportion calculation of the
intact LTR retrotransposon in the genome

The chromodomains were found by BLASTX search of
the intact LTR retrotransposons with the chromodomain proteins in the Pfam database (PF00385). The
chromodomains found in the intact LTR retrotransposons were used again in finding the chromodomains in
the other sequences. The intact LTR retrotransposons
that have no chromodomain were confirmed again by
the conserved domain search service in the NCBI
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi).
The proportions of the individual intact LTR retrotransposons in the pepper genome were calculated using
the 90.8 Mbp of the assembled sequence and 3.2 Mbp

Park et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:85
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/85

of additional BAC sequences of pepper. By BLASTN
search against the total 94 Mbp pepper sequence, total
matched sequence length of each intact LTR retrotransposon was calculated. The threshold e-value of the
search was e-5. The total matched sequence length of
the individual intact LTR retrotransposon was divided
by the 94 Mbp of pepper sequence size.
FISH analysis

The FISH probes for analyzing the LTR retrotransposons were produced by PCR amplification using the primer sets listed in Additional file 10 online. Pachytene
chromosomes of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum cv.
Micro-Tom) were prepared according to the methods of
Koo et al. [45]. Metaphase and pachytene chromosomes
of pepper (Capsicum annuum cv. CM334) were prepared as described by Kwon et al. [46]. All probes were
labelled with biotin 16-dUTP or digoxygenin 11-dUTP
by nick translation as described by the manufacturer’s
protocol (Roche, Germany). The FISH experiments for
tomato and pepper were performed according to the
methods described by Koo et al. [45] and Kwon et al.
[46], respectively. The hybridization solutions contained
50% formamide (w/v), 10% dextran sulfate (w/v), 5 ng/μl
salmon sperm DNA, and 20 ng of each probe in 2 X
SSC. The probes were detected using fluorescein avidin
DCS (Roche, Germany) and rhodamine anti-digoxygenin
(Roche, Germany). Pachytene chromosomes were counterstained with DAPI (1 mg/ml) in Vectashield antifade
(Vector Laboratories). All images were captured and
analyzed using the DeltaVision imaging system and
associated software (Applied Precision, USA) with a cool
SNAP CCD camera at NICEM. All images were
improved for optimal brightness and contrast using
Adobe Photoshop.
