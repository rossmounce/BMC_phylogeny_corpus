Abstract
Background: Tectonic, volcanic and climatic events that produce changes in hydrographic
systems are the main causes of diversification and speciation of freshwater fishes. Elucidate the
evolutionary history of freshwater fishes permits to infer theories on the biotic and geological
evolution of a region, which can further be applied to understand processes of population
divergence, speciation and for conservation purposes. The freshwater ecosystems in Central
Mexico are characterized by their genesis dynamism, destruction, and compartmentalization
induced by intense geologic activity and climatic changes since the early Miocene. The endangered
goodeid Zoogoneticus quitzeoensis is widely distributed across Central México, thus making it a good
model for phylogeographic analyses in this area.
Results: We addressed the phylogeography, evolutionary history and genetic structure of
populations of Z. quitzeoensis through a sequential approach, based on both microsatellite and
mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences. Most haplotypes were private to particular locations. All
the populations analysed showed a remarkable number of haplotypes. The level of gene diversity
within populations was H d = 0.987 (0.714 – 1.00). However, in general the nucleotide diversity
was low, π = 0.0173 (0.0015 – 0.0049). Significant genetic structure was found among populations
at the mitochondrial and nuclear level (ΦST = 0.836 and FST = 0.262, respectively). We distinguished
two well-defined mitochondrial lineages that were separated ca. 3.3 million years ago (Mya). The
time since expansion was ca. 1.5 × 106 years ago for Lineage I and ca. 860,000 years ago for Lineage
II. Also, genetic patterns of differentiation, between and within lineages, are described at different
historical timescales.

Conclusion: Our mtDNA data indicates that the evolution of the different genetic groups is more
related to ancient geological and climatic events (Middle Pliocene, ca. 3.3 Mya) than to the current
hydrographic configuration of the basins. In general, mitochondrial and nuclear data supported the
same relationships between populations, with the exception of some reduced populations in highly
polluted basins (Lower Lerma River), where the effects of genetic drift are suggested by the
different analyses at the nuclear and mitochondrial level. Further, our findings are of special interest
for the conservation of this endangered species.

Background
Primary freshwater fishes are strictly confined to freshwater basins, limiting their dispersal capacity. The evolution
and dispersal of primary freshwater fishes are closely tied
to the palaeogeography and history of connections, captures or separation of the water bodies they inhabit [1].
Accordingly, tectonic, volcanic and climatic events that
produce changes in hydrographic systems are the main
causes of diversification and speciation of freshwater
fishes [2]. As these events reflect the geological development of landscapes, the phylogeographic studies of freshwater fishes permit to infer the biotic and geological
evolution of a region [3].
The freshwater ecosystems of Central Mexico are characterized by their genesis dynamism, destruction, and compartmentalization induced by intense tectonic and
volcanic activity. Its major physiographic feature is the
Mesa Central, a large and isolated tropical highland,
which includes the geological active Transmexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB), defined as the southern limit of the
massive uplifted and as the transition area between the
Nearctic and Neotropical provinces [4]. The tectonic activity of the Mesa Central started in the Miocene and reached
its climax during the Pliocene-Pleistocene and has continued intermittently to the present, mainly in the TMVB
region [5]. This intense geologic activity has generated a
complex hydrologic system, which is the promoter of continuous processes of dispersion and vicariance. It has been
suggested as the main cause for the high freshwater fish
species richness (around 100 species) and unusual high
levels of endemicity (around 70%) of the Mesa Central.
Thus, this region is an interesting model for the understanding of the evolution and development of the biotic
components of complex areas [6].
Many studies have discussed the biogeography of the
Mesa Central, and have described the vicariant events that
have resulted in subsequent differentiation in beetles [7],
salamanders [8], toads [9], fishes [10] and mammals [11].
Most of the works centred in central Mexico have involved
terrestrial taxa, but studies dealing with freshwater taxa are
scarce [12]. More specifically, in the last years, the historical biogeography of the ichthyofauna of the Mesa Central
of Mexico has been studied based on historical and

descriptive methods of analysis [6,13-15]. These studies
corroborated the pioneer works of several authors, who
described general patterns of distribution of the freshwater fish fauna of the region, using occurrence data and
detailed morphological comparisons (e.g. [16-18]). These
contributions discussed diverse hypotheses, such as
repeated events of connection and isolation of water bodies, river piracy, centers of origin, ancestral isolations
between populations, and the effect of Pleistocene glaciations. However, these hypotheses have been widely
debated and poorly understood [6,14,19].
Recent molecular studies have demonstrated the genetic
signatures these volcanic, tectonic, and climatic events
have left in some freshwater fish species of the Mesa Central, such as the Poecilids [10], Cyprinids [20] and Goodeines [21]. These studies have investigated the
phylogenetic relationships at higher taxonomic levels and
mainly evoke processes of isolation and vicariance. Nevertheless, to date, no specific evolutionary scenario of any
freshwater organism has been proposed in the context of
a phylogeographical approach with reference to climatic
and geological events.
Within the endemic freshwater fish fauna of the Mesa
Central, the Goodeinae is one of the most diverse groups
(around 41 species), characterized by its particular life history, including internal fertilization, matrotrophy and
viviparity, and a high degree of genetic divergence
[15,21,22]. Within the Goodeinae, the genus Zoogoneticus
is represented by two species, Z. tequila (Webb and Miller,
1998) and Z. quitzeoensis (Bean, 1898). The former is a
microendemic species of the upper Ameca River basin,
while the latter is widely distributed across the hydrological basins that drain the TMVB. Previous works have demonstrated that the populations of Z. quitzeoensis from
Cuitzeo and Zacapu are significantly divergent when compared with populations from Lower Lerma [23] and
Ameca basins [21]. However, no information about its
evolutionary and demographic history has been yet provided. Further, the distribution range of this genus has
been dramatically reduced due to habitat fragmentation
and anthropogenic perturbations [24-26]. Because of
these, Zoogoneticus quitzeoensis is considered an endangered species by the Mexican Official Norm of Ecology,

and its sister species, Z. tequila, is now reported as extinct
in the wild [27]. Thus, Z. quitzeoensis provides an interesting case-study for examining various features of the evolutionary and demographic history of the geologically active
TMVB and its biota. Also, it can serve as a model to understand the processes and events that rule the biodiversity
assemblages of the area and to promote its conservation.

ical events [32]. In this way, the sequential approach to
phylogeography is recommended, as it examines both
haplotype relatedness and demographic history [29,33].
This approach supports the idea that there is not one single and most powerful or informative analysis, but a combination of them [33]. Hence, the use of the sequential
approach in phylogeography and different molecular
markers, gives the opportunity to elucidate not only the
spatial and temporal distribution of genealogical lineages,
but the evolutionary and demographic history at different
timescales.

In this sense, phylogeographical approaches have generally served to establish patterns of evolutionary history in
distinct geographical populations. However, they have
also been successfully used to infer historical demographic processes such as gene flow, effective population
sizes or evolutionary trajectories [28]. Elucidating the evolutionary history of a species is important to understand
population divergence and speciation and to provide
more specific and accurate information of the processes
and events that influence the evolutionary and demographic history of a region and its biota. Further, this
information can be applied to conservation biology, as
historical contingencies have been largely responsible for
creating important genetic subdivisions in most extant
taxa [29].

Herein we describe the phylogeography, evolutionary and
demographic history of Zoogoneticus quitzeoensis across its
whole distribution range. Based on our results, we then
infer the historical biogeographical scenario of its populations and propose future strategies for its conservation.

Results
Sequence variation and phylogenetic reconstruction
By sequencing 1140 bp of the entire mitochondrial cytochrome b gene in 80 individual Z. quitzeoensis specimens
from 12 populations (Figure 1 and Additional file 1), 65
haplotypes were detected (Table 1). Fifty four sites were
variable (4.73%), 37 were non-synonymous, and 17 were
parsimony informative. As expected for a protein-coding
gene, third codon positions were the most variable (10)
followed by first (5) and second (2). The average ratio of
non-synonymous/synonymous substitutions was dN/dS =
0.45 (CI: 0.35–0.56) and no evidence of positively

Mitochondrial DNA is preferentially and commonly used
in most phylogeographic studies [30], although markers
showing a faster evolution rate can uncover patterns on a
more recent temporal scale [31]. Thus, the combined use
of mtDNA and microsatellites has proved to be particularly effective for exploring both contemporary and histor-

In Lineage I, the five-step clade showed significant values;
there was insufficient evidence, however, to discriminate
between range expansion, colonization and restricted dispersal or gene flow. Within this lineage, long distance colonization and/or past fragmentation was inferred for
Clade 3.6 (Clade Ameca) and long distance colonization
associated with subsequent fragmentation followed by
range expansion for clades 3.5 (Clade La Luz-Orandino)
and 4.2 (Clade Chapala-Lower Lerma) [34].

uncorrected p distance between the two lineages were

D ML = 3.05% ± 0.23 and D p = 2.81% ± 0.21. Both lineages showed a well-defined internal structure (Table 2).
Within Lineage I, we found two main clades. One clade
(Ameca Clade) included 18 haplotypes (Hn) from the 3
sampled sites in the Ameca River Basin (Los Veneros,
Magdalena and Moloya), and the other clade (ChapalaLower Lerma Clade: Hn = 22) contained individuals from
the localities sampled in the Lower Lerma Basin and Lake
Chapala. Distances between Ameca and Chapala-Lower

In Lineage II, the inference key [34] suggested long distance colonization and/or past fragmentation for Clade
4.1 (Lineage II).

Genetic structure
The mtDNA ΦST values obtained for the comparisons of
all the populations ranged from 0.006 to 0.940 (Table 3).
Highest significant values were obtained for most comparisons involving the Zacapu population (ΦST = 0.518 –
0.940), except for comparisons with two populations
from Lake Cuitzeo (Belisario and San Cristóbal). Significant ΦST values were also obtained for all the comparisons
of Los Veneros with the rest of the populations, except for
those involving populations within the same basin
(Magdalena and Moloya). The only significant ΦST values
between samples within the same basin were found in the
Lower Lerma River, except for Orandino and La Platanera
(Table 3).

0.2.
In Lineage II, the first clade comprises the Lake Cuitzeo
and Zacapu Lake Basin populations (Cuitzeo-Zacapu
Clade: Hn = 20), and the second one, the San Francisco
del Rincón population (Middle Lerma Clade: Hn = 5). The

D ML between the two clades was 1.17% and D p = 1.21
(Table 2).
Nested clade analysis
The statistical parsimony haplotype network for Z.
quitzeoensis indicated a similar pattern to that revealed by
the phylogenetic analysis and showed the existence of two
well-defined evolutionary lineages (Figure 3). The
number of mutational steps (21) between lineages
exceeded the maximum number of mutational connections justified by the 95% parsimony criterion (14 mutational steps). Thus, each lineage was treated
independently in subsequent analyses.

Pairwise FST values based on microsatellite data were significant for most of the comparisons, except for MoloyaMagdalena in the Ameca basin and for Belisario-San
Cristóbal in the Cuitzeo Lake basin (Table 3). Highest FST
values were observed for the comparisons between La Luz
and San Francisco del Rincón, and La Platanera with La
Mintzita (FST = 0.455, 0.408 and 0.406 respectively).
Although the La Luz and La Platanera populations occur
in the same basin (Lower Lerma), their FST values were
among the highest. Notwithstanding, the other population inhabiting the Lower Lerma Basin (i.e. Orandino)
showed significant yet much lower FST values when compared with La Luz and La Platanera (FST = 0.271 and 0.224
respectively).

The null hypothesis of the nested contingency analysis of
no association between haplotype positions in the cladogram and their geographical locations was rejected in six
of the tests performed (P < 0.05) (Figure 3 and Additional
file 3).
Allopatric fragmentation could have rendered the geographical pattern of the full cladogram of Z. quitzeoensis.

respectively). For the subsequent analyses, populations
were grouped in different hierarchical arrangements
according to previous information and to uncover groupings obtained in the previous analyses (e. g. phylogenetic
analysis and NCA) and by their biogeographical arrangement (Table 4). Significant values were obtained when the
biogeographic arrangement of basins [6] was considered
(ΦCT = 0.787, P < 0.001, FCT = 0.107, P < 0.05). When the
basins where each lineage was found were considered separately, only Lineage I showed significant structure for
mtDNA (Table 5). When two gene pools corresponding to
the two lineages found were considered, 74.8% (P <
0.001) of the total variance was explained as differences

among groups for mtDNA and 11.18% in the case of microsatellite data (P < 0.01). Division of the populations
into the groups suggested by the phylogenetic and NCA
analysis maximised among-group variance for the
mtDNA data (ΦCT = 0.823, P < 0.001). Thus, the structure
previously obtained in the phylogenetic and NCA was statistically supported for the mtDNA, but not for the microsatellite data.
The Mantel test revealed a significant correlation between
geographical and mitochondrial genetic distances (r =
0.4123, P = 0.01). Otherwise, non significant correlation
was found considering the genetic distances obtained
using the microsatellite data (r = 0.1894, P = 0.179) (Figure 4).

The Bayesian structure analysis for the microsatellite data
clearly revealed a genetic structure among the specimens
analysed. According to the maximum likelihood value, we
estimated a number of genetic clusters of K = 6. Estimates
of lnPr(X|K) increased rapidly between K = 1 and K ≤ 6,
whereas beyond K > 6 lnPr(X|K) started to oscillate. But
when we considered Δ K, we obtained clear peak at K = 5
(Figure 5). Conversely, the highest global FST value was
found for K = 6, indicating that these clusters explained
the maximum level of structure in our sample (Additional
file 4). However, for the following discussion we adopted
the more conservative measure of K = 5, obtained with the
correction of Evanno et al. [35]. All populations were
assigned with high probability (Q = 0.844 – 0.962) to
their inferred cluster.

The results derived from the microsatellite NJ tree were
highly congruent with those from the Bayesian clustering
analysis and most of the phylogenetic mtDNA tree, but
with some differences within Linage I (Figure 5). Two
well-supported lineages were obtained. In Lineage II, all
samples from the Cuitzeo and Zacapu basins grouped
together, and San Francisco del Rincón appeared differentiated from these. Otherwise, Lineage I showed a higher
degree of structure, with its populations distributed in
three different clusters (Figure 5). When considering K =
6, Orandino represented a separate cluster. Slightly different results, regarding the position of the Lower Lerma
populations, were rendered by the two types of marker for
population relationships (Figure 5). The population
assignment test correctly assigned 80.59% of the individuals to their original population. While for the Lineage I

Lineage II, gene flow was found among all populations
(72% of the individuals were assigned correctly) except
for the site San Francisco del Rincón, whose individuals
were all unequivocally assigned.
Mitochondrial DNA variation and demographic patterns
Overall gene diversity was Hd = 0.987 and nucleotide
diversity π = 0.0172. Most haplotypes were found at single
sites. Only two haplotypes were shared among individuals from different localities. One of them was also the
most common haplotype overall, found in 8 individuals
from the sites Zacapu, San Cristóbal and Belisario (ZAC-

SCR-BEL 59), and the other one was found in 3 individuals from Magdalena and Moloya (MAG-MOL 2) (Figures
2 and 3). The rest of the haplotypes were shared among
individuals within the same localities.
All the populations analysed showed a remarkable
number of haplotypes (Table 1). The level of gene diversity within populations was H d = 0.987 (0.714 – 1.00).
However, the nucleotide diversity exhibited by most of
the tested populations (π = 0.0015 – 0.0049) was low.
Mean pairwise nucleotide diversity (k) ranged from 1.71
to 5.69 within populations (average number of nuclePage 10 of 19

The mismatch distribution (MMD) for all the data set was
bimodal (not shown), one of the peaks represents the differences between lineages, and the other the differences
among individuals within lineages. The two lineages and
the different clades obtained in the previous analyses were
tested independently. The MMD for Lineage I was unimodal and bimodal for Lineage II (Figure 6), which is
expected when populations are geographically subdivided
[36]. In both cases, raggedness indices (r) were not significant, thus not rejecting the null hypothesis of stationarity. Conversely, Tajima's D-statistic and Fu's statistic (Fs)

ca. 1.4 × 106 (τ = 5.08) and ca. 1.08 × 106 (τ = 5.647),
respectively. In Lineage II, we estimated ca. 860,000 years
since population expansion according to the value of τ =
3.09. For the clades within Lineage II, the estimates of
time since population expansion were ca. 790,000 years

were significantly negative and supported the expansion
model for the different groups tested (Table 5). Both tests
show a significant excess of the number of segregating
sites and singletons compared to the average pairwise
sequence divergence. These tests indicate that the different
groups analyzed are in mutation-migration-drift genetic
disequilibrium with respect to mtDNA alleles. The different results obtained by these three demographic tests
might be due to the low power of mismatch distribution
based tests (e.g. raggedness), compared with methods
based on the mutation frequency (e.g. Tajima's D) or haplotype distribution (e.g. Fu's F). In a variety of cases and
for large samples sizes, Fu's F has been proved to be the
most powerful test to detect population growth [37]. Values of τ differed between lineages and among clades. For
Lineage I, the mean of the mismatch distribution was τ =

Discussion
Phylogeography and evolutionary history
The trees obtained by the different methods (NJ, MP and
BI) using both types of markers (cytochrome b and microsatellites) distinguished two independent lineages, supporting the conclusions of previous studies [21] in which
two divergent groups were identified within Z. quitzeoensis. Lineage I inhabits areas west of the Middle Lerma,
including the Lower Lerma, Ameca and the Chapala Lake
basins. Lineage II occurs at sites east of the Angulo River
and the Middle Lerma Basin, including the Cuitzeo and
Zacapu lakes. Our NCA also supported this conclusion,
indicating the two main lineages were not nested together;
moreover, the 21 mutation steps between the two lineages
exceeded the 95% parsimony limits (14 mutation steps).
This result suggests allopatric fragmentation between the
two clades.

The formation of the two lineages of Z. quitzeoensis was
dated at ca. 3.3 Mya based on the molecular clock calibration of 0.9% divergence per million years [21]. These two
lineages could be the result of a dispersal process of the
ancestral population from the Lower Lerma-Chapala area
to the Middle Lerma-Cuitzeo-Zacapu area (Figure 1), followed by an isolation event. This hypothesis is based on
the facts that: Lineage I is the most widely distributed
group (distributed in Chapala-Ameca-Lower Lerma drainage), and it shows, overall, a higher genetic diversity than
Lineage II (Hd = 0.991, S = 76 and Hd = 0.946, S = 54,
respectively).
The dispersion event we refer to, from the Chapala-Lower
Lerma to the Middle Lerma-Cuitzeo-Zacapu area, could
have been promoted by a period of high precipitation and
humidity occurred in Central Mexico in the early Pliocene
(5.2 – 3.6 Mya). This could have caused an increase of the
water bodies level in this area causing them to get in contact, as was previously proposed for other lakes in Central
Mexico [38,39]. The subsequent isolation of the ancestor
of the two lineages that induced allopatric fragmentation,
could have been the result of the end of the humid period,
and/or the formation of a biogeographical barrier promoted by the geologic activity of the Penjamillo Graben
[40,41], the Chapala-Tula fault or the activity and formation of the Corredor Tarasco volcanic field, which commenced during the Late Miocene-Early Pliocene [40]
(Figure 1). This climatic change and the high tectonic
activity have been proposed as the causes for the isolation
of the palaeolakes along the TMVB during the Late
Miocene-Pliocene (Figure 1) [38].
Since recent geological times, some of the regions where
these two lineages occur have been connected, and at
present constitute one single hydrologic system (Lerma
River). However, our findings of ancestral isolation
between Lower Lerma-Chapala and Middle LermaZacapu-Cuitzeo are supported by at least one pair of sister
species with the same cladogenetic pattern, Skiffia lermaeS. multipunctata, dated around 3.2 Mya [21]. This indicates
that the same biogeographic event could have promoted
the isolation of the two divergent groups and consequently they could be considered as two ESUs [42,43].
Furthermore, considering the morphological differences
between groups, and pending of more detailed morphometric studies, they could be considered as two species.
Within lineage genetic structure and demography
The results of all our analyses revealed significant genetic
structure and differentiation among populations between
and within the two lineages, but with certain differences
as indicated by the two types of molecular markers.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/161

Lineage I: Ameca-Lower Lerma-Chapala area
The two main clades identified within Lineage I correspond to two different hydrologic systems. One clade
appears in the Ameca river basin (Clade 3.6) and the other
is distributed across the Lower Lerma-Chapala Lake area
(Clade 4.2). When Lineage I was tested independently, the
statistical associations in the nested contingency analysis
were not able to discriminate between range expansion
and colonization versus restricted dispersal and gene flow.
However, the fact that haplotype LUZ-40 emerged as the
most probable outgroup in the network, and the significant negative value of the Fu's Fs, and Tajima's D statistics
seem to better support the range expansion and colonization scenario. The haplotype arrangement found within
the three populations sampled on the Ameca river basin
also supports this scenario. Haplotypes from Los Veneros
are placed in a basal position in the phylogenetic trees and
appeared in all the 2-step clades found in the NCA (within
3.6 Clade). Such patterns could indicate that Los Veneros
may represent the ancestral population of the Ameca
Basin. The Los Veneros population is geographically close
to the San Marcos-Atotonilco lakes (~19 Km), which
formed part of the Chapala Palaeolake [44], but also it is
close to the Zacoalco-Ameca paleolake. This supports the
hypothesis that Z. quitzeoensis spread from the Chapala
Palaeolake region to the Ameca River region via the
Zacoalco-Ameca Paleolake (Figure 1). The expansion for
the Ameca River populations was calculated in ca. 1.4 ×
106 (τ = 5.08), in such case the dispersion event could
have taken place at the beginning of the Pleistocene.

A former connection between the Chapala and Ameca
basins have been previously proposed via the Atotonilco
and San Marcos lakes [45] (Zacoalco-Ameca Paleolake
area). Other authors have supported this connection
based on the distributions of related species/population
pairs of fish, as in Poeciliopsis [10], Notropis [46], Chirostoma [17], Ictalurus [19], Yuriria [47] and almost three
events of Goodeines exchange [6,21].
Within Lineage I, another two clades showed a significant
association in the geographic contingency test: Clade 4.2,
in which specimens from the Chapala and Lower Lerma
were included; and Clade 3.5, comprised of the geographically close populations of La Luz and Orandino that are
~4 km apart within the same basin. In both cases, long
distance colonisation possibly accompanied by subsequent fragmentation or past fragmentation followed by
range expansion, was inferred from the NCA. Moreover,
the genetic distance between the population of La Platanera (clade 3.7) and the populations of La Luz and
Orandino (clade 3.5), within the Lower Lerma region, was
larger than the distance between the population of La
Alberca (clade 3.4), in the Chapala Lake region, and the
populations of Orandino and La Luz (Table 2). These

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:161

results are in disagreement with a previous biogeographic
hypothesis, where the Lower Lerma and Chapala Lake
were considered as independent biogeographic entities
[6]. The significant outcome of Clade 3.5 (populations
within the Lower Lerma region) might also be due to the
fact that NCA is likely to give false-positive results, and
consequently detect a significant spatial structure, in populations that have suffered processes that affect local haplotype frequencies, such as bottlenecks [48]. This could be
the case for La Luz and Orandino where the effects of
genetic drift and low population size (e.g. low genetic
diversity and significant inbreeding), caused by human
activities (e.g. pollution, desiccation and isolation of the
water bodies, introduction of exotic species) have been
proved [49] and are congruent with the high genetic differentiation and significant inbreeding revealed by the
microsatellite data (Table 3, Figure 5, Additional file 5).
The pronounced genetic structure among the contiguous
sampling sites of Orandino, La Platanera, and La Luz was
also found at the nuclear level (Table 3, Figure 5). Further,
most of the differences between the mtDNA and nDNA
analyses were found in relation to this area (Figure 5).
Thus, all these results suggest that recent demographic
events could have shaped, through genetic drift, the
genetic structure of the populations in the Lower Lerma
basin.
Lineage II: Middle Lerma-Cuitzeo-Zacapu area
In Lineage II, two well-differentiated groups were recovered by the mtDNA (i.e. ΦST, NCA and phylogenetic trees)
and microsatellite analyses (i.e. STRUCTURE, FST and NJ
tree). The first of these groups comprises the San Francisco
del Rincón population and the second group includes the
populations from Zacapu, La Mintzita, San Cristóbal and
Belisario, the last three belonging to the Cuitzeo region. In
the NCA, only Clade 4.1, which clustered together all the
populations of this lineage, showed a significant geographical association, but insufficient to discriminate
between long distance colonization and past fragmentation (Additional file 3).

According to our demographic results, both scenarios provided by the NCA inference key are candidates for the five
populations distributed across three different basins
(Additional file 3). However, certain features, for instance:
the low genetic diversity in the San Francisco del Rincón
population suggested by the mtDNA and confirmed by
previous microsatellite studies [49] (Additional file 5),
and that this population probably expanded more
recently (ca. 540,000 years), could point to the long distance colonization of organisms from Zacapu-Cuitzeo
and past fragmentation as the most plausible scenario.
This assumption is supported by the neutrality tests of Fu's
Fs and Tajimas's D statistics.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/161

All the populations within this lineage showed evidence
of recent gene flow, except the one from San Francisco del
Rincón. Our results also indicated non significant genetic
differentiation for most of the pairwise comparisons, for
mtDNA, among the four populations inhabiting the
Zacapu and Cuitzeo basins. Haplotypes were shared by
the two basins, a fact that disagrees with the hypothesis
that Zacapu and Cuitzeo constitute two well-defined biogeographic entities [6]. Although the two basin populations are close (≈50 km), at present they are
geographically separated by a mountain chain. The time
since expansion for these populations was estimated at ca.
790,000 years ago. Our results support the idea of an
ancient connection between Zacapu and Cuitzeo lakes,
via a river located in the Chucandiro-Uaniqueo region,
and further disrupted by the geologic and volcanic activity
during the Plio-Pleistocene (≈1 Mya) [14]. This connection is also stated in previous phylogenetic studies that
address population relationships between Zacapu and
Cuitzeo based on species of the genus Notropis [20] and
other Goodeinae species [21]. However, we found differences in the divergence times, suggesting that more than
one event of connection and isolation between the
Zacapu and Cuitzeo regions occurred in the last three million years.
Discrepancies between nuclear and mitochondrial markers
Mitochondrial and nuclear markers reveal different parts
of the evolutionary history of the organisms due to their
different inheritance modes and mutation rates. Even
though mitochondrial markers coalesce faster than
nuclear markers due to the smaller effective size and the
lack of recombination, microsatellites have a much faster
mutation rate which makes them useful to detect more
recent processes [50,51].

In general, the relationships inferred with the mitochondrial and microsatellite data set were congruent, but some
differences were found. Whereas both markers retrieved
the existence of two main clades, the relationships within
them were not the same (Figure 5). Discrepancies were
observed in Lineage I for the comparisons of the ChapalaLower Lerma populations. In this case, both makers
showed significant differences among geographically
close populations. High and significant pairwise FST values were obtained for most of the comparisons of populations from the Lower Lerma basin (Table 3), which also
were assigned to different genetic clusters by the Bayesian
clustering analysis and microsatellite NJ tree, but formed
a single clade according to mtDNA (Figure 5). Some of
these localities have recently suffered a severe reduction in
the size of their water bodies, and become isolated with a
consequent increase of the effects of genetic drift, resulting
in genetic differentiation. Moreover, it has been suggested
that the Lower Lerma populations suffered a more intense

Page 13 of 19

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:161

genetic drift than other populations within Z. quitzeoensis
[49]. Similarly the non-significant correlation between
geographic and genetic distances based on the microsatellite data might be explained by the stochastic processes
that are recently shaping the genetic structure of Z.
quitzeoensis, and consequently the high genetic differences
between nearby localities.
The differences found in the genetic diversity values were
much higher for the microsatellite than the mitochondrial
data, which showed a high diversity for all populations
(Table 1 and Additional file 5). The populations of
Zacapu and San Francisco del Rincón, which showed
allelic richness values of only 2.93 and 2.97, still retained
haplotypic diversities of 0.917 and 0.857. Thus,
eventhough samples sizes are, in some cases, low and unequal we might deduce that the loss of diversity is occurring
at a different rate for the two types of markers [52]. Additionally, none of the Tajima's D values, either for single
populations or lineages, were significantly positive, which
would be indicative of a bottleneck [53], whereas seven
out of the 10 populations analyzed showed a significant
signature for a recent bottleneck, with at least one of the
three microsatellite mutational models (Additional file
5).
Implications for conservation
The importance of fish diversity in Central Mexico has
been largely recognized [54] but very few efforts have
been made to establish a basis for their conservation. Further, no studies have addressed the evolutionary processes
underlying such diversity targeted at maintaining these
processes. Our results, derived from both phylogeographic and population analyses, could prompt certain
conservation management strategies. First, the two reciprocally monophyletic lineages of Z. quitzeoensis, support
the idea that future conservation plans should be aimed at
managing the populations of both lineages independently and, furthermore, be considered as two ESUs
[42,43].

Moreover, within each lineage, we found genetic structure
for the two markers, supporting previously identified
Operational Conservation Units (OCU's) for Zoogoneticus
[49]. When the species under study shows high genetic
structure, ideally all the populations should be protected
since they contain unique portions of the total variation
of the species. This may increase the adaptation and the
survival possibilities of the species as a whole.

Conclusion
The present study is the first attempt to describe, on a fine
scale, the evolutionary history of populations of a fish species in Central Mexico. Our results demonstrate the value
of the use of mtDNA combined with nuclear microsatel-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/161

lite loci to detect genetic structure and to elucidate the
evolutionary history of fish species. The methodology
used integrates independent geological and genetic information to test for interactions between historical and contemporary factors in a highly structured endemic fish in
Central Mexico.
Our results indicate that the evolutionary history and
genetic structure among populations of this fish species is
closely tied to geological and climatic events that promoted changes in the ancient drainages, since the MiddlePliocene, rather than to the current configuration of those
drainages. In addition to this, the results obtained and differences between molecular markers are an evidence of
the effects of genetic drift over the genetic structure in
some highly polluted aquatic environments.
The information provided by this type of study is essential
for the conservation of highly genetically structured species and its phylogeographic hypotheses prompt comparable analyses of other codistributed fish species to test the
scenarios proposed.

Methods
Specimen collection and DNA extraction
Fin clips were obtained from individuals of Zoogoneticus
quitzeoensis. Specimens were collected from 12 sites distributed across six regions along the Mesa Central of Mexico (Figure 1 and Additional file 1), representing most of
the distribution range of the species. The fishes were sampled using minnow traps, seine nets and by electrofishing.
Tissue was preserved in 96% ethanol and most fishes were
returned to the water unharmed. A few fish specimens
were incorporated into the Goodeid Conservation Program of the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de
Hidalgo. Because of the endangered status of Z. quitzeoensis [27] and its scarcity at all the collection sites, sample
sizes ranged from 7 to 20 individuals per population
(Additional file 1). Similar sample sizes have been used
successfully in similar phylogeograpic studies of freshwater fauna [55-61]. However, it has long been proved that
phylogenetic and population genetic inferences are sensitive to the number of taxa included. The number of specimens and populations needed to resolve their
relationships depend on the amount of polymorphism
relative to the extent of divergence. Thus, it would be
appropriate to use small samples per groups when most of
the variation occurs among groups [62]. However, in such
cases other inferences should be taken with caution as
some estimates, for example those based on genetic diversity, could be biased. Sampling at each site was conducted
during the same field season. Total genomic DNA was
extracted according to standard CTAB and phenol-chloroform extraction procedures [63].

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:161

In order to compare the genetic structure between mitochondrial and nuclear markers, we used a microsatellite
data set from a previous study about the effects of human
impacts on the genetic variability of Z. quitzeoensis [49].
However, not all the populations included here for the
mtDNA study were available at that time, and therefore
the number of analysed populations differs between
marker types.
mtDNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
Two overlapping fragments of the cytochrome b gene
(1140 bp total) were amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from 80 specimens distributed in 12 sampling
sites. The primers used were those used in Machordom &
Doadrio [64]. The amplification process was conducted
using the conditions described elsewhere [21]. PCR products were sequenced in an ABI PRISM 3700 DNA analyser.
Chromatograms and alignments were visually checked
and verified. All sequences were deposited in GenBank
under accession numbers: EU679420-EU679499.

We used phylogenetic tree-building algorithms to infer
the phylogenetic relationships among sequence haplotypes. Maximum Parsimony Analysis (MP) was performed by heuristic searching with the tree-bisectionreconnection (TBR) branch swapping algorithm and random stepwise sequence addition using 10 replicates. Two
different weights were given to the characters; first all characters were equally weighted, and second, transversions
(Tv) were assigned eight times the weight of transitions
(Ti) according to the empirically determined Tv/Ti ratio
for Zoogoneticus obtained in PAUP 4.0b10 [65]. The
robustness of the MP topologies was assessed by bootstrapping with 1000 replicates (full heuristic search) of 10
random stepwise addition replicates each. The model of
DNA substitution that best fitted the data set was selected
using MODELTEST 3.7 [66] using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for each codon position and the
Akaike information criterion (AIC). A Neighbour-Joining
(NJ) phylogram was obtained using maximum-likelihood
distances according to the model selected by AIC. Bootstrap values for this analysis were obtained from 1000 replications. All phylogenetic analyses were performed using
PAUP 4.0b10. Bayesian analysis was conducted with
MrBayes 3.1.1 [67]. By simulating a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo reaction for 2 × 106 cycles and using the substitution
model obtained for each codon position selected by BIC
criterion, 20,000 trees were generated, 1000 of which were
burned and discarded. Posterior clade probabilities were
used to assess node support. To identify ancestral and
derived haplotypes, the trees were rooted using Zoogoneticus tequila, the sister species of Z. quitzeoensis, as outgroup,
and a molecular clock of 0.9% per million years was
applied to the pairwise uncorrected p genetic distances
[21].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/161

Evidence of positive selection was sought using a codonbased approach as implemented in Datamonkey [68].
This method does not need to assume equal synonymous
substitution rates throughout the sequence and allows to
choose the most appropriate model for nucleotide substitution. We used the single likelihood ancestor counting
(SLAC) and fixed effects likelihood (FEL) approaches [69]
using a P value of 0.1. In both cases, ambiguities in the
consensus sequence were averaged in the analysis.
Nested Clade Analysis
We constructed a 95% statistical parsimonious un-rooted
haplotype network using TCS 1.18 [70]. As a complementary method to those performed before, and considering
the limitations and drawbacks of Nested Clade Analysis
[48,71], we tested geographical association among haplotypes and clades, based on the most parsimonious haplotype network and followed by a nested cladistic analysis
(NCA), as described by Templeton [34,72]. To test for significant associations between clades and geographical
sites, nested contingency analysis [73] was conducted by
the program GEODIS 2.2 [74]. The AUTOINFER 1.0 [75]
software package was used to infer the most suitable population structure model and historical scenario for the
observed geographical associations.
Genetic structure based on mtDNA
Pairwise ΦST values were calculated among all geographic
populations as an estimate of genetic differentiation. To
assess the significance of genetic differentiation at different hierarchical levels, an analysis of molecular variance
(AMOVA) was performed as described by Excoffier et al.
[76]. Populations were initially grouped according to previous biogeographical information [6]. In subsequent
analyses, we considered the information obtained in both
the phylogenetic and the NCA analyses, but other hierarchical arrangements were also tested. Statistical significance was assessed using 20,000 permutations. A Mantel
test (100,000 permutations, [77]) served to evaluate correlations between linear geographic distances and genetic
distances. All analyses were performed using ARLEQUIN
3.1. [78].
mtDNA diversity and demographic history
Population genetic statistics, such as the number of polymorphic sites (S), haplotype diversity (Hd, [79]), nucleotide diversity (π, [79]) and the average number of
pairwise nucleotide differences (k, [80]) were calculated
using DnaSP 4.0 [81].

To investigate the demographic history of the groups
identified in the phylogenetic analyses and through the
AMOVA results, a mismatch distribution analysis (MMD)
of pairwise substitution differences among haplotypes
was performed for the whole data set and the lineages

obtained. Deviations from the constant population size
model were further tested using the Harpending's raggedness index (r) [82]. To test for deviations from neutrality
we used Tajima's D [53] and Fu's Fs [83] tests as implemented in DnaSP 4.0 [81]. We used the MMD age expansion parameter (τ) to date the onset of population
expansion [84]. This was done by calculating τ using the
equation τ = 2μt, were μ is the sum of per-nucleotide
mutation rates in the DNA region under study (0.9%
PMY; [21]) and t is time in generations (0.5 for goodeines).
Microsatellite analysis
We examined a previous data set, consisting of 135 individuals of Z. quitzeoensis from 10 populations, genotyped
for five microsatellite loci (Additional file 5) [49] to look
for differences in the allele frequencies of the populations
by estimating FST between all sample pairs, according to
Weir & Cockerham [85], using ARLEQUIN 3.1. The significance of these estimates was assessed using 10,000 data
permutations corrected by Bonferroni adjustment [86].

Geographical and phylogenetical genetic variation were
compared among populations and clades by AMOVA. We
assessed genetic isolation by distance [87], testing for
independence between FST estimates and geographical
distances using a Mantel test [77]; regression matrices of
FST/1-FST values versus the linear distance between sample
pairs. All these analyses are implemented in ARLEQUIN
3.1.
To determine relationships among the sampled populations a neighbour-joining tree was created using the POPTREE program [88] based on DA modified Cavalli-Sforza
distances [89] with 5000 bootstrap replications.
Because of the uncertainty that the geographical assignment of individuals to populations could represent biologically significant entities, a Bayesian clustering method
was conducted as implemented in the program STRUCTURE 2.1 [90]. We performed a series of independent runs
from K = 1 to 8 populations assuming correlated allele frequencies and an admixture model. For each value of K, the
MCMC scheme was run with a burn-in period of 5 × 105
steps and chain length of 5 × 106. Multiple runs were performed for each K to assess convergence of the results.
Mean log probabilities were used to calculate ΔK (i.e. a
quantity based on the second-order rate of change of the
log probability of data between successive K values), to
find the true K following the method of Evanno et al. [35].
Global FST values were calculated for each K to find out
which of the structures inferred explained the highest percentage of genetic variation. To assess the level of admixture and gene flow between the central Mexican Basins,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/161

we ran a population assignment test using GeneClass 2.0
[91].
