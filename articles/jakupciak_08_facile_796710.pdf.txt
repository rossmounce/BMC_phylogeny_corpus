Abstract
Background: Mutations in the mitochondrial genome (mtgenome) have been associated with
many disorders, including breast cancer. Nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) from symptomatic women
could potentially serve as a minimally invasive sample for breast cancer screening by detecting
somatic mutations in this biofluid. This study is aimed at 1) demonstrating the feasibility of NAF
recovery from symptomatic women, 2) examining the feasibility of sequencing the entire
mitochondrial genome from NAF samples, 3) cross validation of the Human mitochondrial
resequencing array 2.0 (MCv2), and 4) assessing the somatic mtDNA mutation rate in benign breast
diseases as a potential tool for monitoring early somatic mutations associated with breast cancer.
Methods: NAF and blood were obtained from women with symptomatic benign breast conditions,
and we successfully assessed the mutation load in the entire mitochondrial genome of 19 of these
women. DNA extracts from NAF were sequenced using the mitochondrial resequencing array
MCv2 and by capillary electrophoresis (CE) methods as a quality comparison. Sequencing was
performed independently at two institutions and the results compared. The germline mtDNA
sequence determined using DNA isolated from the patient's blood (control) was compared to the
mutations present in cellular mtDNA recovered from patient's NAF.
Results: From the cohort of 28 women recruited for this study, NAF was successfully recovered
from 23 participants (82%). Twenty two (96%) of the women produced fluids from both breasts.
Twenty NAF samples and corresponding blood were chosen for this study. Except for one NAF
sample, the whole mtgenome was successfully amplified using a single primer pair, or three pairs of
overlapping primers. Comparison of MCv2 data from the two institutions demonstrates 99.200%

concordance. Moreover, MCv2 data was 99.999% identical to CE sequencing, indicating that MCv2
is a reliable method to rapidly sequence the entire mtgenome. Four NAF samples contained
somatic mutations.
Conclusion: We have demonstrated that NAF is a suitable material for mtDNA sequence analysis
using the rapid and reliable MCv2. Somatic mtDNA mutations present in NAF of women with
benign breast diseases could potentially be used as risk factors for progression to breast cancer,
but this will require a much larger study with clinical follow up.

Background
The increased number of cancer cases around the world is
a major concern. Research methods for identifying the
presence of cancerous cells by measuring mutations in
mtDNA is the subject of intense clinical investigation
[1,2]. Frequently, these studies analyze only specific
regions of mtDNA and not the entire mitochondrial
genome (mtgenome). There are several biological characteristics of mitochondria, and in particular the mtgenome
that make it suitable for early detection and monitoring of
neoplasia. This genome has an accelerated mutation rate
in comparison to the nuclear genome and accrues somatic
mutations in tumor tissues [2-5]. The mitochondrial
genome has a high copy number in comparison to the
nuclear archive of DNA; there are potentially 1,000s of
mtgenomes per cell, which enables easy detection of
important biomarkers, even when only low amounts of
samples are available.
Given its small size and vital role in bioenergetics, the
mtgenome is frequently sequenced in its entirety [1,2,6].
MtDNA mutations increase the risk of mitochondrial
associated diseases later in life [7]. Here we report the feasibility of sequencing the complete mtgenome from nipple aspirate fluid (NAF), and the reliability of microarray
based resequencing of the mtgenome to CE sequencing
technology as well as the reproducibility of the resequencing methodology in a cross validation study between the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg, MD USA) and Genesis Genomics Inc. (Thunder Bay,
On Canada). This study also uncovered mtgenome mutations in NAF, a relatively easily obtained body fluid,
which has potential use for early breast cancer detection,
diagnosis and monitoring [8].
Dr. Susan Love pioneered the intraductal approach to
access the lobular units where breast cancer begins [9].
NAF can be recovered from 48% to 94% of women and
represents a minimally invasive technique for obtaining
breast fluids for the evaluation of abnormalities associated with breast cancer [10-14]. NAF production has been
linked to an increased relative risk for breast cancer development [15], and the evaluation of NAF as a potential
screening tool for the detection of breast cancer has been
the subject of intense investigation [16-18]. NAF from

women with no clinical evidence of breast tumors has also
been analyzed to detect mtDNA mutations and for genetic
variants (BRACA1) that are associated with breast cancer
development [19].
A limitation of using NAF for diagnosis has been the sensitivity of detection technologies. However, with recently
developed technologies and modern sensitive cancer
biomarkers [20], the usefulness of NAF deserves re-evaluation. An important limitation of the use of NAF is its low
cellular content, which often precludes histopathologic
analyses [12]; however, analyses of predictive markers in
this biofluid can identify the presence of cancer [21]. Ductal lavage is a technique designed to overcome low cellularity and allows access to an entire duct system. This
procedure results in high cytological/histological specificity (100%), but low sensitivity and accuracy (17% and
19% respectively) [22]. The analysis of NAF to monitor
recurrence may have limited application, because risk
reduction therapies, including selective estrogen receptor
modulators (tamoxifen, raloxifene or oophorectomy),
appear to reduce NAF yields [15].
The high copy number of the mtgenomes [23] is an
advantage of using mtDNA SNP analysis for early detection and monitoring disease progression. In addition,
rapid, accurate and relatively low cost resequencing methods streamline mutation detection and justify complete
mtgenome analysis of cancer associated mutations in
tumor and preneoplastic tissues. Sequencing the entire
mtgenome allows for a complete inventory of the point
mutations in this genome that may develop in association
with disease pathology and provide early detection markers [1].
Herein we report the utility of NAF for rapid whole mtgenome analysis. This study represents the largest number of
NAF samples sequenced, and the first application of DNA
microarray measurement of the mutation load in NAF.
The results were independently cross-validated. Microarray analysis has an increased sensitivity over fluorescent
sequencing [24]. We detected somatic mutations in NAF
that were not present in the matched control tissue. While
our study does not answer the etiology behind mutations
present in NAF, our findings suggest that this paradigm

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/8/95

may be useful for screening NAF for mtDNA mutations
analogous to recent clinical proposals [25].

Methods
Study Subjects
Symptomatic women referred to a surgical oncologist for
a clinical breast examination and who had a negative
result were recruited for this study. A total of 20 women
were selected for the cross validation study. All patients
were recruited in accordance with the ethical guidelines of
the Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Ethics Board in
adherence to the Tri-Council Policy Statement on Ethical
Conduct for Research Involving Humans. Written consent
was obtained from the patients for publication of the
study.
Samples
Blood samples were collected by standard venipuncture
using a BD Vacutainer CPT™. Additionally, blood from a
finger prick was collected on isocode cards from each
patient. MtDNA was extracted from whole blood using a
QiaAmp DNA MiniKit (Qiagen). NAF was recovered by a
qualified practitioner, using a FIRSTCYTE™ Aspirator
(Cytyc Health Corporation) following the recommendations of the manufacturer, and stored in CytoLyt Solution
until extracted. Using this device, NAF was expressed from
1–3 ducts and pooled for the study. This method of NAF
collection is therefore not representative of the entire ductal system, and could miss ducts with lesions. For diagnostic purposes, a better method of NAF collection is needed.
The total volume of NAF collected per patient ranged from
50 – 100 µL. MtDNA was extracted using the QiaAmp
DNA MiniKit (Qiagen) and archived at -86°C. Both NAF
and blood isolated mtDNA samples were randomized
and blinded for the cross-lab validation.
Mitochondrial genome amplification
Method used at Genesis Genomics Inc
The entire mtgenome of both NAF and corresponding
blood samples were amplified using a single back-to-back
primer set or three overlapping primers (see primer
sequences in Table 1). These primers were designed using

proprietary software that precludes pseudogene coamplification. 25 ng of template DNA, 5U LA Taq polymerase
(TaKara), 5 µL buffer, 2.5 mM each of dNTPs, 0.2 µM of
primers were mixed with dH20 to a final reaction volume
of 50 µL. Cycling parameters were as follows: 94°C for 1
min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 10s, 68°C for 15
min, 72°C for 10 min, and a final hold at 4°C.
Method used at NIST
DNA amplification was performed independently at NIST
using three primer pairs previously used for fluorescent
DNA sequencing resulting in 3 amplicons of 5–6 kb in
length for full coverage of the mitochondrial genome
[26]. Samples which did not amplify using these primers
were successfully amplified using the nine primer sets previously validated for full mtDNA fluorescent sequencing
[2]. Each PCR product was visualized on an agarose gel to
obtain a qualitative assessment of the amount of mtDNA
generated by the procedure. The mitochondrial DNA template, 10 µmol of primers, 0.5U LA Taq polymerase
(TaKara), 5 µL buffer, 8 µL dNTPs (10 µmol each) and 33
µL of dH20 were mixed for a total reaction volume of 50
µL. Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 94°C for
2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 68°C for 7
min; final elongation 68°C for 12 min; 4°C hold. PCR
amplification products were analyzed for quality and
quantity as previously [2] or by spectrophotometric methods as described in GeneChip CustomSeq™ Resequencing
Array Protocol Version 2.
PCR Cleanup: MitoChip
PCR clean up was conducted using the QIAquick 96 well
vacuum plate manifold and protocol (Qiagen). DNAs
were eluted into 65 uL of DNAse/RNAse free water.
CE-based Fluorescent Sequencing
Amplified mtgenome template was sent to CoGenics
(Houston, Texas) for capillary electrophoresis sequencing.
Briefly, Big Dye Termination Chemistry and a series of 72
primers were used to sequence in both forward and
reverse directions. The fluorescent PCR-based sequencing
was also conducted independently as a cross validation at
NIST using previously published reaction conditions [2].
Primers contained M13 tags to facilitate DNA sequencing
with M13 forward and reverse sequences. Briefly, the
blood and NAF mtDNAs were sequenced using the Big
Dye™ Terminator (BDT) version 3.1 cycle sequencing kit
(ABI). A one eighth cycle sequencing reaction was used for
each primer. Reactions contained 1 µL of each of the following reagents: BDT reagent, DNA (3–6 ng/µL), M13
primer (forward or reverse; 5 pmol/µL), 5× Dilution
Buffer (ABI), and dH2O to a final volume of 5 µL. Cycling
sequencing conditions for forward primers were as follows: (40 cycles): 96°C for 10 s; annealing, 50°C for 5 s;
elongation, 60°C for 4 min; 4°C hold. Reverse primers

were sequenced using the same protocol, but the annealing temperature was lowered to 37°C.
The Montage™ SEQ96 plate (Millipore Corp., Billerica,
MA) was used for clean-up following the cycle sequencing
reactions. Thirty microliters of Wash Solution was added
to each well of the cycle sequencing plate. The samples
were transferred to the clean-up plate and placed on the
vacuum manifold for 15–20 minutes or until the wells
were dry. A second wash of 30 µL Wash Solution was
added and vacuumed dry for an additional 25 to 30 minutes. Once dry, 20 µL of Injection Solution were added to
each well and the plate was mixed vigorously on a plate
shaker for 10 minutes. Resuspended samples were transferred to a 3100 Optical Plate and diluted with 15 µL of
HI-DI Formamide (ABI). All separations were performed
using the ABI 3130×LGenetic Analyzer with an 80 cm capillary and POP7 polymer system. Samples were electrokinetically injected (30 seconds, 1 KV) and separated at 14.6
KV. Sequences were aligned using the DNA Star SeqMan II
(5.05) program and scanned for polymorphisms and
sequence variants in direct comparison to revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) and the corresponding
sequence of the blood.
Resequencing: MitoChip protocol
The GeneChip® CustomSeq® Resquencing Array Protocol
Version 2 was used with a few modifications. Following
amplification of the mtgenome, template was prepared
and hybridized as recommended by the GeneChip® Resequencing Reagent Kit. MCv2 chips were processed in the
GeneChip® Hybridization Oven 640, GeneChip® Fluidics
Station 450 and the GeneChip® Scanner 3000. Briefly,
either three or nine amplicons representing the patient
and normal control mitochondrial genomes were separately pooled at equi-molar concentrations. The PCR
amplification products were pooled, fragmented, labeled,
hybridized, washed, and scanned. The total quantity of
DNA applied to the array was 0.62 µg. Fragmentation of
the pooled DNAs was conducted using 0.15 units of Fragmentation reagent (0.033 µL) per sample at 37°Cfor 15
minutes followed by 95°C for 15 minutes to inactivate.
The fragments were labeled with 30 units of TdT at 37°C
for 90 minutes followed by 95°C for 15 minutes. The
hybridization cocktail, including separately prepared control fragments, was hybridized for 16 to 18 hours at 45°C
with 60 rpm. Arrays were washed using the
mini_mapping10kv1_450 fluidics protocol, scanned on a
GeneArray® 2500 Scanner or a GeneChip® Scanner
3000G7 Scanner, and analyzed with GeneChip® DNA
analysis (GDAS) and GSEQ Softwares.
MitoChip Sequence Interpretation
Final analysis of all data was conducted using Affymetrix
software GCOS v1.4 and GSEQ v4.0. The probe intensities

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/8/95

for each mutation reported by the software were examined on the forward and reverse strands for every occurrence of a specific base position located on the chip.
Mutations were confirmed and only reported when the
mutation was seen on both strands for locations appearing once, and 3 of 4 strands for locations that appear on
the chip twice. We selected a random subset of our patient
samples (3 tissues each from 4 patients) to evaluate the
accuracy of the MitoChip in comparison to CE DNA
sequencing. All samples were blinded and phylogenetic
trees were returned using the PHYLIP program Dnaml,
Dnapars and Dnadist [27].
Short Tandem Repeat (STR) Genotyping
All samples were genotyped using the PowerPlex® 16 System (Promega Corp, Madison, WI) on a 3130×L genetic
analyzer with a 36 cm capillary array and POP4 polymer
and analyzed using GeneMapper® ID v3.2 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA (ABI). Samples were diluted to
0.5 – 1.0 ng/µL and 1 µL of sample was added to a 24 µL
reaction volume (18.2 µL H2O, 2.5 µL 10× buffer, 2.5 µL
PowerPlex® 16 10× primer pair mix, 0.8 µL (4U) AmpliTaq
Gold® DNA Polymerase (ABI), then PCR amplified using
published conditions. 1 µL of ILS600 internal lane standard and 9 µL of HiDi™ Formamide (ABI) were added to 1
µL of reaction (or 1 µL Allelic Ladder Mix, one for each
run) then the mix was briefly denatured and chilled to
95°C and then placed on crushed ice for 3 minutes prior
to each sequencing run.

Results and Discussion
Quality assurance
STR typing was performed on all samples to eliminate the
possibility of inadvertent sample mix-up or cross contamination.
Sequencing of whole mtgenome from NAF samples
Two previous studies have examined mtDNA mutations
in NAF, however, both studies examined less than 30% of
the mtgenome [18,19]. For diagnostic purposes, it is more
informative to interrogate the complete mtgenome.
Hence, our attempt was to reliably sequence the complete
mtgenome from NAF. NAF was successfully extracted
from 23 of the 28 women recruited for this study. Twenty
two (96%) of the women produced NAF from both
breasts, and 20 NAF samples from the left breasts and
matched blood were chosen for this study. Table 2 shows
the clinicopathologic and demographic data of the study
participants. Overall thirty-nine (20 blood and 19 NAF)
samples were successfully processed; one NAF sample
could not be fully amplified and was not included in the
analysis. The entire mtgenome of 14 out of 19 NAF samples were successfully amplified using a single full length
primer pair, with the remaining 5 samples requiring three
overlapping primers. Although the primers were designed

to preclude pseudogene co-amplification, the ability to
amplify the full length mtgenome in biological samples
such as NAF with reduced cellularity is an added quality
assurance measure against pseudogenes. Sequence comparison between the NAF, blood and rCRS revealed a total
of 490 polymorphisms and 7 mutations. Of the 7 mutations (SNPs discovered only in the NAF and not present in
the blood) noted between all samples, three were associated with known problematic features of MCv2 at nucleotide positions 9179, 9914, and 11719 (Table 3).
Comparison of MCv2 sequence data to the gold standard
(CE) revealed a 99.999% identity. These results indicate
that microarray resequencing of the mtgenome recovered
from NAF is a rapid, sensitive and cost effective technique.
Importantly, this technology enables clinical access to the
information content of the mtgenome of mammary ductal epithelial cells.

records the comparative data between the work done at
NIST and Genesis Genomics, demonstrating repeatability
of the detection method and consensus on the number of
mtDNA mutations. Maximum likelihood clustering analysis of the blinded results from both labs demonstrates
general clustering from the suite of samples from any
given subject (Figure 1), again demonstrating the accuracy
of the data obtained at each institution. Moreover, each
individual was resolved into mitochondrial haplogroups,
as expected. Haplogroup polymorphisms were accurately
detected in both NAF and blood samples from the respective participant. In general, this study population was
essentially of European ancestry. Although Figure 1
appears to indicate differences between the NAF and
blood samples from a given patient, this effect is an artifact since the genetic distances between these samples is
very small (e.g. 0.00001). These small distances are also
true for the general outline of the tree.

Cross validation of MCv2
The ability to rapidly sequence the mtgenome from NAF
was cross-lab validated by independent confirmation at
separate venues with a 99.200% concordance. Table 3

Elevated somatic mtDNA mutations in benign breast
disease
Four out of 19 (21%) NAF samples contained a single
point mutation difference from the matched controls
(blood) (Table 4). Previous work on partial mtgenome
analysis is consistent with our results [18]. This work by
Zhu et al. reported that some mutations detected in NAF
were also found in the patient's primary tumor, emphasizing the possible utility of NAF for breast cancer screening.
Although no tumor was detected in our cohort of women,
these mutations may indicate mtgenome instability, perhaps suggesting an elevated risk for breast cancer in these
4 women. For example, patient 1069 had a C/T heteroplasmy at bp 516, which is within a D-Loop region of
known mtgenome instability in breast tumors [28]. Heteroplasmy is considered an early marker of potential disease [29,30]. Moreover, one study concluded that breast
tumors that have mutations within the D-Loop have less
favorable patient outcomes than those lacking these alterations [31]. Thus this simple, sensitive measurement of
the mutation load from non-invasively collected samples,
offers an alternative for diagnostic purposes.

One important aspect of this project is the massive
amount of genetic data collected in a relatively short
period. Close to 1.6 × 106 mtgenome bases were
sequenced, demonstrating an extremely fine genetic resolution when using the MCv2. This suggests that cross-validated point mutations may indeed be important
indicators of altered molecular processes indicative of
potential transformation. Independent cross-validation
confirmed these mutations. Combined with the broad
resolution demonstrated by the blinded Maximum likelihood clustering results, in association with corresponding
demographic data, this technology is capable of gathering
a broad spectrum of population level data. Moreover, this
methodology may have important utility in the early
detection of breast cancer associated mutations in NAF.

Conclusion
Ductal lavage and random periareolar fine needle aspiration are both used to harvest breast epithelial cells for risk
assessment as well as to evaluate response in chemoprevention trials. The magnitude of increase in relative risk
has been defined and other studies have concluded that
presence of NAF with epithelial cells is associated with an

Resequencing with microarray technology is a rapid,
highly accurate, relatively inexpensive method, which
enables the widespread investigation of mitochondrial
mutations detected in non-invasively collected body fluids associated with solid tumors. The cost saving benefits
of chip-based sequencing techniques, including reagents,
labor, time-to-results, ease and accuracy of data interpretation, are substantial in comparison to typical fluorescent
sequencing methods. For example, 12 mtgenomes can be
sequenced with a chip per day, as opposed to 12 mtgenomes per month, using a 16 capillary DNA sequencer, a
30-fold increase in productivity and data acquisition. This
demonstrates potential, important utility from a disease
detection perspective. Finally, the chip can detect lowlevel heteroplasmy, a condition often associated with the
genesis of disease.

increase in breast cancer risk and that such cells harbor
useful markers for women at higher risk [32]. However,
the evaluation of NAF has shown limited promise in part,
because of poor cytologic reproducibility [33]. The measurement of cancer associated mutations in the entire
mtgenome may overcome such limitations.
