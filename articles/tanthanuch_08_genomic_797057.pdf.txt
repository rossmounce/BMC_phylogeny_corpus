Abstract
Background: Many plant β-galactosidases (Bgals) have been well characterized and their deduced
biological functions mainly involve degradation of structural pectins, xyloglucans or
arabinogalactoproteins in plant cell walls. However, gene multiplicity in glycosyl hydrolase family 35
(GH35), to which these proteins belong, implies diverse functions. In this study, the gene
multiplicity, apparent evolutionary relationships and transcript expression of rice Bgal genes were
examined, in order to predict their biological functions.
Results: Fifteen rice Bgal genes were identified in the plant genome, one of which encodes a
protein similar to animal Bgals (OsBgal9), and the remaining 14 fall in a nearly plant-specific subfamily
of Bgals. The presence of both classes of Bgals in bryophytes, as well as vascular plants, suggests
both gene lineages were present early in plant evolution. All 15 proteins were predicted to contain
secretory signal sequences, suggesting they have secretory pathway or external roles. RT-PCR and
database analysis found two distinct lineages to be expressed nearly exclusively in reproductive
tissues and to be closely related to Arabidopsis Bgals expressed most highly in flower and pollen.
On the other hand, OsBgal6 is expressed primarily in young vegetative tissues, and alternative
splicing in panicle prevents its production of full-length protein in this reproductive tissue. OsBgal11
also showed alternative splicing to produce different length proteins. OsBgal13 produced by
recombinant expression in Escherichia coli hydrolyzed α-L-arabinoside in addition to β-Dgalactoside and β-(1→3)-, β-(1→4)- and β-(1→6)- linked galacto-oligosaccharides.
Conclusion: Rice GH35 contains fifteen genes with a diversity of protein sequences, predicted
locations and expression and splicing patterns that suggest that OsBgals enzymes may play a variety
of roles in metabolism of cell wall polysaccharides, glycoproteins and glycolipids.

Background

β-Galactosidases (Bgals) (EC 3.2.1.23) catalyze the
hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds of terminal non-reduc-

ing β-D-galactosyl residues of oligosaccharides and β-Dgalactopyranosides. This group of enzymes has a broad
distribution, which encompasses plants, animals and

microorganisms. The biological functions of these
enzymes include degradation of structural polysaccharides in plant cell walls [1,2], thereby acting to control
fruit softening during ripening [3], hydrolysis of dietary
lactose [4,5] and degradation of glycolipids and proteoglycans in mammals [6,7], and metabolism of lactose
and other galactosides in microorganisms [8,9]. The
extensive diversity of Bgals raises the question of what is
the basis of their different substrate specificities, which
help determine their functions.
Glycosyl hydrolases (GH) have been grouped and classified as families on the basis of structural similarity [10]
and Bgals fall into glycosyl hydrolase (GH) families 1, 2,
35, and 42, which are part of superfamily A (or Clan A).
Based on amino acid sequence similarities [11], plant
Bgals that have been described belong to GH family 35
(GH35). Like other glycosidase families, GH35 includes
multiple genes in various plant species, including Arabidopsis [12], tomato [13], papaya [14], apple [15], Vigna
unguiculata [16] and barley [17], suggesting that GH35
gene multiplicity is ubiquitous in plants.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/84

In rice, GH35 has not yet been well characterized, and the
biological function of rice Bgals remain mysterious.
Konno and Tsumuki [36] identified both soluble and cellwall-bound Bgal, of which a 42 kDa soluble Bgal was purified and shown to release galactose from larch wood and
rice cell wall arabinogalactans. Likewise, Kaneko and
Kobayashi [37] isolated a Bgal with 40 and 47 kDa subunits from the medium of rice suspension cells. Recently,
Chantarangsee et al. [38] characterized two recombinant
Bgal isozymes, including the 90 kDa OsBgal1 and 72 kDa
OsBgal2, which had different expression patterns, though
both are found throughout plant growth. The complete
rice genome sequence allows extensive study of rice
GH35, so the gene structures, encoded protein sequences
and phylogenetic relationships with other Bgals from rice
and other organisms, which may provide clues to their
evolution and possible functions, were determined. In
addition, the transcript expression patterns of all rice
GH35 Bgals have been determined and OsBgal13 was
expressed in Escherichia coli to gain a clue to OsBgal physiological functions.

Results and Discussion
Analysis of plant Bgal activities led to the proposal of two
classes, I and II [18]. Class I is made up of enzymes with
well characterized exo-β-(1→4)-galactanase activities that
can specifically act on pectic β-(1→4)-galactan. Class II
has hydrolytic activity on the β-(1→3)- and β-(1→6)galactosyl linkages of arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs),
but lacks activity toward pectic β-(1→4)-galactan [19,20],
as reported in spinach leaves [20] and hypocotyls and
young leaves of radish [18]. Class I OsBgals can specifically act on β-(1→4)-galactosyl residues in pectin and
xyloglucan. Therefore, they could play an important role
in modification of the architecture of the cell wall and
intercellular attachment [1,2]. The apparent involvement
of Bgals in pectin disassembly during fruit ripening has
been reported in various plant species, including tomato
[3,21,22], muskmelon [23], kiwifruit [24], persimmon
[25], sweet cherry [26], mango [27], and peach [25]. Bgals
expression also accompanies many stages of plant development in other tissues, for example, spinach leaves [20],
mungbean seedlings [29], radish hypocotyls and young
leaves [18], and meristem zones of roots, cotyledons, vascular tissues, trichomes, and pollen of tobacco [30,31].
Bgals that appear to catalyze galactose removal from
xyloglucans during their disassembly were observed in
cotyledons of nasturtium (Tropueolum mujus L.) seed [32],
Copaifera langsdorffii seed [33], and Hymenaea courbaril
seed, where they were reported to act in cooperation with
α-xylosidase, β-glucosidase, and other enzymes to achieve
xyloglucan degradation [34,35]. Therefore, Bgals appear
to play a role in cell wall remodeling in many plant processes.

Identification of rice GH35 genes and their protein
products
A total of 15 GH35 genes (defined OsBgal) were identified
in rice genome databases (Table 1), each of which encodes
a protein that contains the GH35 β-galactosidase active
site consensus sequence G-G-P- [LIVM]-x-Q-x-E-N-E- [FY]
[39]. Most of the encoded proteins contain a GH35
domain at the N-terminus and a Gal-lectin-like domain at
the C-terminus. Although the speculated carbohydratebinding function of these Gal-lectin domains is not yet
proven, their existence and conserved nature has led to the
suggestion that they may increase the catalytic efficiency
on polysaccharide substrates [12]. The proteins from
OsBgal2, OsBgal7 and OsBgal9 lack the Gal-lectin-like
domain, suggesting that it is not necessary for the functions of these rice GH35 members.

The deduced amino acid sequences of the OsBgal proteins
were used to predict their putative signal peptides, protein
lengths, molecular masses, pI values, possible N-glycosylation sites, and cellular destinations (Table 2). All OsBgals contain putative signal peptides, which range in
length from 20 to 36 amino acids, except for that of
OsBgal8 which is predicted to have 62 amino acids. The
mature OsBgal proteins were predicted to contain from
653 (OsBgal9) to 894 (OsBgal8) amino acids, corresponding to molecular masses of 73.5 to 97.9 kDa. Most
of the proteins were predicted to have pI in the acidic
range (5.56–6.76), except those of OsBgal2, OsBgal7 and
OsBgal10 are in the basic range (7.65–9.1) (Table 2).
Only OsBgal2 and OsBgal7 lacked putative N-glycosylation sites, while the other enzymes were predicted to con-

tain from 2 to 10 sites. Most OsBgal members are
predicted to localize to the organelles of the secretory
pathway, for instance, the Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic
reticulum, or vacuole, or to be secreted. Only 3 OsBgals,
including OsBgal9, OsBgal10 and OsBgal11, were predicted to be localized in the lysosome-like vacuole, which
correlates to the location of mammalian β-galactosidases
in the lysosome (Table 2). Although OsBgal10 and
OsBgal11 are very similar in predicted mature protein
length and possible cellular destinations, their predicted
pI values are quite different. OsBgal5, OsBgal12,
OsBgal14 and OsBgal15 all have high numbers of glycosylation sites, similar MW, pI and predicted possible destinations, which suggests that they may have redundant or
overlapping functions.
Phylogenetic analysis
The multiple alignment of full-length protein sequences
was used to construct an unrooted phylogenetic tree. The
phylogenetic tree, which includes all the GH35 genes
identified in the rice (monocot), A. thaliana (dicot) and
Physcomitrella patens (a bryophyte moss) genomes, as well
as representatives of animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and
eubacteria, has three major branches, one of which is
nearly plant specific (except for one Dictyostelium discoideum gene product), one of which contains representatives of animals, eubacteria and plants, and one of which
contains archaeal, eubacterial and fungal enzymes (Figure
1). Almost all the rice, A. thaliana, and P. patens enzymes

fall within the plant-specific cluster, except OsBgal9,
AtBGAL17 and P. patens EDQ62875, which fall in the cluster with animal β-galactosidases. Previously, it was suggested that the plant enzymes that cluster with animals
might have been transferred to plants by horizontal gene
transfer [12], but the fact that the bryophyte, which is
thought to have diverged from the vascular plants early in
plant evolution, has this type of β-galactosidase and the
broad distribution of organisms with this type of β-galactosidase suggest that plants maintained a copy of this gene
when plants and animals diverged. Perhaps the more relevant question is how the plant specific Bgal ancestor
came to be, and how the C-terminal Gal-lectin-like
domain was acquired by this lineage. It appears that the
fungal-type and plant-type lineages may have diverged
from the animal-type β-galactosidases early in GH35 evolution, but plants retained the animal-type β-galactosidase, as well.
Within the plant-type β-galactosidases, OsBgals can be
divided into three distinct groups (a, b and c in Figure 1).
The major group (group a) contains 5 clusters with total 7
OsBgal members. The cluster a1 contains 4 rice genes,
including OsBgal1, OsBgal2, OsBgal3, and OsBgal7,
along with 6 AtBGALs, the Asparagus officinalis Bgal, and 4
tomato and 5 chickpea Bgals that are not shown, some of
which contain C-terminal galactose-binding lectin-like
domains and some of which do not. Another cluster, a2,
contains OsBgal13, AtBGAL9 and two putative P. patens

Phylogenetic relationship among the rice and other glycosyl hydrolase family 35 proteins. Deduced amino acid
sequences were aligned using ClustalX program [63] and edited with Gendoc [62], then the tree were created using neighbor
joining method and analyzed with 1000 bootstrap replicates, for which the percent reproducibility is shown on the branches
that gave higher than 50% reproducibility. A tree was also made by maximum parsimony with the PHYLIP Protpars program,
and branches supported by this analysis are shown with thicker lines. The rice sequences are named Os and a number according to the OsBgal numbers in Tables 1 and 2. Arabidopsis thaliana sequences are indicated as At, followed by the AtBGAL numbers of Ahn et al. [12].

Bgals (EDQ59880 and EDQ81397), which suggests this
cluster is of ancient origin. Two other putative P. patens
Bgals fall in cluster a3, which appears to be closely related
to cluster a2. OsBgal8 groups with AtBGAL8 and RsBgal1
of radish, which specifically hydrolyzes the β-(1→3)- and
β-(1→6)-linked oligogalactans of AGPs [18], in subsgroup a4. OsBgal4 groups with AtBGAL10 in cluster a5.
The second biggest group, b, contains 4 rice Bgals with
high amino acid sequence similarity, namely OsBgal5,
OsBgal12, OsBgal14, and OsBgal15. These isozymes have
nearly the same protein lengths and gene structures, as
described below. Within group c, OsBgal10 and OsBgal11
(cluster c1) are closely related, while OsBgal6 (cluster c2)
is less clearly associated, though both distance-based and
maximum parsimony trees back this model.
Chromosomal locations of OsBgals
As shown in the map of their chromosomal locations and
directions of transcription in Figure 2, the OsBgals are distributed over all chromosomes, except chromosomes 4, 7
and 11. Three OsBgals are located on chromosome 1,
while 2 OsBgal each are found on chromosomes 3, 5, 6,
and 10, and one OsBgal each is present on chromosomes
2, 8, 9, and 12. Similar to other gene families, OsBgals
appear to have undergone gene duplication, as the rice
genome has undergone genome-wide duplication events,
including polyploidy, which promote the amplification
of gene family members. Segmental duplication analysis
identified four OsBgals located on the duplicated segmental regions in rice chromosomes. OsBgal7 (Rice genome
project
locus
Os02g0219200)
and
OsBgal2
(Os06g0573600) are located on a chromosomal segment
duplicated between chromosomes 2 and 6, while
OsBgal10
(Os08g0549200)
and
OsBgal11
(Os09g0539200) are located on segments duplicated
between chromosomes 8 and 9. These duplications are

supported by the close phylogenetic relationships of these
genes. Therefore, chromosomal segment duplication
appears to have played a role in multiplication of OsBgals
within the rice genome. In contrast, OsBgal12 and
OsBgal14, which have high sequence similarity, are
located close together on the same chromosome. Thus,
these two genes may have diverged by tandem duplication.
Exon-intron organization and primary gene structure
analysis
Automated annotations for all OsBgal genes were available in the public databases, except for OsBgal6, OsBgal14
and OsBgal15. However, we confirmed and corrected
exon-intron organization manually by comparing the corresponding full length cDNA and EST sequences, which
were either already available in publicly accessible databases or were obtained during this study, with genomic
sequences.

Gene structure comparisons showed eight different splicing patterns. The sizes of the majority of the coding exons
are conserved, but some appear to have had intron-loss
events (Figure 3). The pattern with the highest number of
exons, found in OsBgal1, OsBgal3, OsBgal4, OsBgal6 and
OsBgal13, contains 19 exons with 18 introns, with exons
1 through 10 encoding the GH35 domain, and exons 18
and 19 encoding the Gal-lectin-like domain. Ahn et al
[12] observed this same pattern in A. thaliana Bgals and
surmised from parsimony that it is likely to be the ancestral gene pattern and other patterns were derived from it,
mainly by intron loss. The presence of this pattern in
diverse rice genes and in a P. patens gene (EDQ59880)
supports this conclusion. The second most similar pattern
is 18 exons separated by 17 introns with the loss of intron
1, which occurred in OsBgal11. A pattern of two-intron

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/84

ever, their splicing patterns were different. OsBgal2 and
OsBgal7 have patterns similar to other rice GH35 genes
and retain the 5' end of exon 18, but OsBgal2 contains 16
exons with the loss of introns 11 and 16, while intron 15
has been lost in OsBgal7, leaving 17 exons (Figure 3). In
contrast, OsBgal9 appeared to be distantly diverged from
other rice GH35 members since its exon/intron organization does not correspond to the other OsBgals, except that
an intron is found in the same position as intron 1 in the
other genes.

the genes with the same splice pattern are enclosed by red
boxes.

Although the pattern and lengths of exons in rice GH35
genes are similar, OsBgal13 spans approximately 20.8 kb,
because it contains over three-fold longer introns than the
other genes in the family. Long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons elements and other repeated sequences
were found within OsBgal13 gene introns 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 13,
14 and 16, which contain one GC rice region, three AT
rich regions and eight transposable elements (Table 3).
Likewise, OsBgal6, the second largest OsBgal gene due to
its long (4 kb) intron 1, had one AT rich region and seven
transposable elements, all of which were located within
intron 1. In OsBgal genes of normal length, such as
OsBgal1, no transposable elements were observed. These
results may reflect the observation that rice genome
expansion is forced by transposable element amplification [40].
Comparison of gene splice patterns and phylogenetic relationships between plant-type Bgals from rice, A. thaliana,
and P. patens reveals that, although the ancestral gene pattern is the same, no other splice patterns are shared within
a phylogenetic lineage. Therefore, though most introns
appear to have been inserted in the common ancestor
gene for this lineage (an extra exon was inserted in P. patens gene EDQ878340), intron losses appear to have
occurred independently in rice, Arabidopsis and P. patens.
The same may be true for the C-terminal domain, which
appears to have been lost only once in rice (in the putative
ancestor of OsBgal2 and OsBgal7), though it appears to
have been lost at least 4 times in Arabidopsis GH35 Bgals
[12].
Analysis of expression by RT-PCR
OsBgal transcript expression in various tissues and stages
of growth was analyzed by RT-PCR with primers specific
to the 3'UTR of each gene to gain further insight into possible functions. The relative expression levels derived from
normalization with the UBQ6 polyubiquitin gene gave
the same patterns as those shown for normalization with
the β-Actin gene in Figure 4 and Additional file 1, indicating the patterns likely reflect the expression of the OsBgal
genes, rather than that of the control.

OsBgal6

RepeatMasker http://www.repeatmasker.org/cgi-bin/WEBRepeatMasker was used to identify these sequences.

The rice tissues/organs and developmental stages chosen
for RT-PCR analysis are shown in Figure 4. All 15 OsBgal
genes were found to be expressed with different but overlapping expression patterns, confirming that all genes are
active. These relative expression levels were used to define
genes as having expression specific to a given tissue, if the
relative transcript levels of the gene at that stage are significantly higher (color scale above 7, where 10 is the level in
the tissue with the highest expression of each gene) over
the levels at all other stages. The expression profiles
revealed that at least 9 genes were highly expressed in one
of the stages of vegetative tissues and 10 were highly

expressed in reproductive tissues. Only OsBgal13 appears
to be expressed in nearly every organ and developmental
stage, though at different levels (Figure 4).
Nine OsBgals (OsBgal1, OsBgal2, OsBgal3, OsBgal4,
OsBgal6, OsBgal7, OsBgal8 and OsBgal9) displayed their
highest transcript levels in young and early-mature stages
of shoot, root, and leaf sheath. Among these genes,
OsBgal6, OsBgal7, OsBgal8 and OsBgal9 showed highest
intensity in leaf sheath at different times, especially, 15day and 1-month old, which are both fast cell elongation
stages. The high accumulation of OsBgals in this stage

may act in sugar remodeling, since the carbohydrate
remobilized from the leaf sheath and culm to grain can
contribute as much as 38% to rice yield [41]. In contrast,
low levels of most gene transcripts were detected in leaf
blade, except for OsBgal13 transcripts, which were
detected throughout the growth of the blade.
Six genes, OsBgal5, OsBgal10, OsBgal11, OsBgal12,
OsBgal14, and OsBgal15 appear to be expressed primarily
in reproductive tissues. The relative transcript levels for
these genes were at least five times higher in reproductive
tissues than in vegetative tissues (Figure 4). In addition,
no expression was detected at the initiating panicle stage,
but it was high in later panicle development and flowering stages. Only OsBgal10, OsBgal11 and OsBgal15 transcripts were found to accumulate in anther. These genes
appear to have diverged from two ancestor genes, since
OsBgal5, OsBgal12, OsBgal14, and OsBgal15 have
sequences and gene structures that are similar to each
other, as do OsBgal10 and OsBgal11 (Figures 1 and 3).
Interestingly, AtBGAL7 and AtBGAL15, which fall into the
group b with OsBgal5, OsBgal12, OsBgal14, and OsBgal15
(Figure 1), were reported to function in the early stages of
microspore and pollen development [31]. Likewise,
AtBGAL11 and AtBGAL13, which fall in cluster c1 with
OsBgal10 and OsBgal11 (Figures 1), show maximum
expression in mature pollen [31]. So, related rice and Arabidopsis Bgals function in reproductive tissues, suggesting
their roles may be somewhat conserved in the two plants.
Only the OsBgal4 transcript was expressed abundantly in
seed at the imbibition stage, while OsBgal2 and OsBgal13
were also present at low levels. Five OsBgals were
expressed in milk grain and six in grain during dry down.
A high abundance of OsBgal2 and OsBgal13 transcripts
was observed in grain during dry down. This evidence
implies that they may function in grain development and
senescence or are stored for roles in germination, such as
cell wall remodeling. OsBgal1, OsBgal2, OsBgal6, OsBgal8,
and OsBgal13 transcripts were also found in shoots and
roots of seedlings after germination. Chantarangsee et al.
[38] reported β-galactosidase activity in rice seeds, roots
and shoots at 0–7 days after seed-soaking, and detected
OsBgal1 and OsBgal2 proteins in embryos and seedling
roots and shoots. In barley (Hordeum vulgare), Giannakouros and colleagues [17] were able to separate 4 isozymes of β-galactosidase from germinated grain. Thus,
Bgals are present and may play roles in the growth and
emergence of root and shoot primordia from the hull.
To complement the RT-PCR expression profiles of the
OsBals, ESTs retrieved from the UniGene database (UniGene December, 2007, NCBI) were compared with our
findings. Full-length or partial cDNA and ESTs for most
OsBgals are available in the database, except OsBgal6, for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/84

which only one EST from unspecified tissues is available,
and OsBgal15, for which no corresponding ESTs or cDNA
are available (Table 1). However, the other OsBgal genes
had cDNA and ESTs present in the database, with numbers of ESTs that varied from 1 to 253.
The OsBgal8 (Unigene cluster Os.22360, locus
Os03g0255100) has the highest number of ESTs in the
database: 253 ESTs from various tissues, including flower,
stem, leaf, panicle, root, callus, seed, whole plant and
unspecified tissues. The Unigene profiles indicate relatively abundant accumulation in flower, leaf, panicle,
root, seed and stem with 761, 133, 120, 190, 216 and 228
transcripts per million (TPM), respectively (Table 1). The
Unigene profile is somewhat similar to the RT-PCR pattern of OsBgal8, in which the transcripts accumulated significantly throughout rice plant, including in seed during
dry-down, but not in seedling and milk grain.
OsBgal10 (Os.18310), OsBgal11, OsBgal12 (Os.46702)
and OsBgal14 (Os.22528) expression data included
mainly flower and panicle clones, or had relatively high
expression in these tissues, which correlates to our RTPCR analysis. For instance,OsBgal11 shows 249 TPM in
flower and 158 TPM in panicle, while OsBgal14 shows
358 TPM in flower (Table 1).
The EST and cDNA clones for the remaining OsBgals had
diverse origins, which is consistent with the evaluation of
OsBgals by RT-PCR, though the frequencies of expression
derived from these two forms of expression data were not
exactly the same. Therefore, Unigene database analysis
could be used for an initial guideline of gene expression,
though the expression patterns based on ESTs are fragmentary, since the tissues are not equally or completely
represented and the source tissue annotation of many EST
libraries is unclear or incomplete. Microarray experiments, such as that by Ma et al. [42], who assessed expression of 37,132 non cross-hybridizing gene models in rice
seedling shoots, tillering-stage shoots and roots, heading
and filling stages of panicles and suspension cells, offer a
more comprehensive picture of gene expression within a
tissue. Although the tissue coverage in public microarray
databases is as yet limited, the GEO expression data in
Table 1 shows that OsBgal expression levels may be
affected by many treatments.
Rice β-galactosidase cDNAs sequencing and identification
of alternative splicing
Although the expression of all OsBgals can be observed by
RT-PCR and most have corresponding cDNAs and ESTs in
the database, complete full-length cDNA clones were not
available for OsBgal6, OsBgal11 and OsBgal15. Therefore,
to confirm the mRNA sequence and gene structure, these

BMC Plant Biology 2008, 8:84

genes were amplified by PCR and sequenced. The accession numbers for these sequences are listed in Table 1.
The full-length cDNA of OsBgal6 was amplified by a set of
primers corresponding to the transcribed locus
XM_475258. The cDNA was isolated from 15-day leaf
sheaths, a tissue with abundant expression, and exerting
panicles, a tissue with poor expression, based on RT-PCR
expression analysis. Sequencing of the cDNA from the
highly expressing tissue revealed an open reading frame
(ORF) of 2,436 nucleotides encoding a protein of 812
amino acids (Genbank Accession EU602310), which confirmed the our predicted β-galactosidase sequence from
chromosome 5 (Genbank accession no. AC135419 and
AC135429). A search through the dbEST database of O.
sativa found 99% identity with a 520 bp EST from fertile
panicle (CK048087). On the contrary, the Os Bgal6 cDNA
amplified from exerting panicle, where expression is low,
contains only 2,338 bp (Genbank Accession EU603285)
which is 101 bp shorter than the cDNA from high expression tissues. The open reading frame beginning at the initiation codon of this transcript covers only exons 1 to 7
and encodes only 244 amino acids. Alternative splicing of
this transcript occurred to utilize an alternative acceptor
site (CAG) 80 nt downstream of functional acceptor site
for intron 7, which introduced a deletion of 27 amino
acid and a frameshift that leads to an in-frame stop codon
(Figure 5). A second missplicing of this gene occurred at

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/84

the intron 10/exon 11 junction, which again used an alternate acceptor site (CAG) located 20 nt downstream of the
regular acceptor site. So, alternative splicing is likely to be
one of the gene regulation mechanisms, since the transcript would be subject to nonsense mediated decay
(nmd) [43] and the protein produced would be useless as
a β-galactosidase.
OsBgal11 (locus Os09g0539200) is annotated as a pseudogene in GenBank, because of its apparent inability to
produce full-length protein due to a frameshift and subsequent stop codon in the AK119414 cDNA. We hypothesized that such phenomenon probably resulted from
missplicing, as seen in OsBgal6. A 1343-nucleotide fragment from the 3' half of the OsBgal11 cDNA was amplified from exerting panicle (Genbank Accession
EU603286), in which its expression is high based on RTPCR. This cDNA shares 98% identity with the AK119414
cDNA, but had a substitution of 75 nucleotides in place of
95 nucleotides at positions 1282 to 1377 of AK119414.
These substituted sequences allow the full-length translation of the predicted 839 amino acids of OsBgal11,
whereas only 426 amino acids are translated from
AK119414. Comparison with the genomic sequence and
our amplified cDNA sequence indicates that the
AK119414 transcript results from retention of intron 10,
which extends exon 10 by 101 nt, thereby introducing an
in-frame stop codon. In addition, an alternative donor site

for OsBgal1 and OsBgal2 were previously reported by Chantarangsee et al. [38].

located at the functional acceptor site of intron 10 and the
first nucleotide of the functional exon 11 produces an
alternate intron 10 with the acceptor site located 79 nt
downstream, within the functional exon 11, thereby
reducing the size of exon 11. The shortened (456-residue)
protein, includes all of the catalytic domain, based on the
Penicillium sp. β-galactosidase structure [44], so it is possible that it could still function as a Bgal.
No experimentally determined cDNA or ESTs corresponding to OsBgal15 were available in public databases,
despite the fact that our RT-PCR demonstrated its expression. Therefore, the full-length OsBgal15 cDNA was
amplified, cloned and sequenced. The OsBgal15 cDNA
sequence (Genbank Accession EU051629) contains a
2487-nucleotide ORF, which encodes 829 amino acids.
The encoded protein shares over 99% identity with a predicted β-galactosidase of Oryza sativa (japonica cultivargroup) (accession no. AP004733), except that 7 extra
amino acid residues were inserted at residue 293, compared to the predicted sequence from AP004733. Therefore, the correct splice donor site of exon 8 is located 21
nucleotides downstream of that predicted for the mRNA
of AP004733.
The alternative splicing observed in this study introduces
in-frame stop codons into the mRNA of OsBgal6 in the
low expression tissue, but not for the high expression tissues, while it can also introduce a premature stop codon
in OsBgal11, based on the AK119414 cDNA sequence. In
vertebrates, there are a number of well-known alternatively splicing genes, for instance the fibronectin gene,
which can generate over 20 different proteins, some of
which have different patterns of localization and slightly
different functions in human cells [45]. Until relatively
recently, there were very few examples of alternatively
spliced genes in higher plants and still fewer examples
known to generate functionally distinct proteins. Generally, alternative splicing yields two polypeptides of different size that are identical, except for the presence of a
number of additional amino acids at the C-terminus of
the larger isoform, eg., ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) activase [46]; diacylglycerol
kinase in tomato [47]; and chloroplast ascorbate peroxidase in spinach [48]. Missplicing events were observed in
maize (Zea mays) Viviparous 1 (Vp1) transcripts, the majority of which are spliced incorrectly and contain insertions
of intron sequences or deletions of coding region, so that
they do not encode full-length proteins [49]. Although
alternative splicing is a widespread process used in higher
eukaryotes to regulate gene expression and functional
diversification of proteins [50,51], the putative control of
tissue-specific expression by missplicing we observed has
not been well characterized in rice.

Preliminary Characterization of OsBgal13
OsBgal13 is in cluster a2 of group a of the phyloenetic tree
in Figure 1, along with AtBGAL9 and two P. patens Bgals.
This and its general expression pattern suggest it may have
a conserved maintenance function in plants. To assess
what its function might be, OsBgal13 was expressed as a
thioredoxin fusion protein in Escherichia coli strain OrigamiB (DE3), which we previously found to have little background β-galactosidase acitivity [38]. The protein was
purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography
on nickel resin, and most of the OsBgal13 activity eluted
in 5–20 mM imidazole. Further purification was achieved
by gel filtration chromatography and the activity of the
resulting protein was assessed. As shown in Table 4,
among p-nitrophenol (pNP) glycosides, the OsBgal13
enzyme had highest activity toward pNP-β-D-galactoside
(pNPGal), but also had 30% of this activity toward pNPα-L-arabinoside (pNPAra), and low activity toward pNPβ-D-fucoside and pNP-β-D-mannoside, but no detectable
activity toward pNP-β-D-glucoside and pNP-β-D-xyloside
and negligible activity toward pNP-α-D-galactoside.
OsBgal13 also hydrolyzed β-(1→3)-, β-(1→4)- and β(1→6)-linked galactobiose and galactotriose, but no
release of galactose or arabinose could be detected when
the protein was incubated for 24 h with rice seedling alcohol insoluble residue (AIR), larchwood arabinogalactan,
galactan, apple pectin, citrus pectin or oat xylan. So,
despite the intriguing observation that OsBgal13 can
hydrolyze both β-D-galactosyl residues and α-L-arabinosyl residues, components of type I and II arabinogalactans
and xyloglucan and glucuronoarabinoxylan side chains
[52], only short galacto-oligosaccharides can be identified
as possible natural substrates to date.
Possible Functions of Other Isozymes
The activity of mammal β-galactosidase specifically
releases terminal β-galactosyl residues from glycosaminoglycans and the glycolipid GM1 ganglioside.
Similarly, the digestion of the galactolipid monogalactosyldiacylglyerol by vacuolar and chloroplast β-galactosidases was reported in wheat [53]. Likewise, β-galacosidase
of tomato was reported to act in galactolipid turnover and
degradation, which occurs in chloroplasts and chromoplasts during tomato fruit development [54,55]. However,
relatively little is known about metabolism of other glycolipids, glycopoteins and proteoglycans involving plant
β-galactosidases, though it is well characterized in mammals. The fact that OsBgal9 is similar to animal β-galactosidases and is predicted to localize to a lysosome-like
vacuole, suggests it may play a similar role in rice.

Among the plant-like OsBgals, OsBgal10 and OsBgal11
are also predicted to localize to lysosome-like vacuoles, so
they could also play a role similar to animal-type β-galactosidases. However, these closely related isozymes have

reproductive tissue specific expression, as are the isozymes
of cluster b, OsBgal5, OsBgal12, OsBgal14 and OsBgal15.
Similarly, AtBGAL11 and AtBGAL13, which clustered in
group c1 with OsBgal10 and OsBgal11, and AtBGAL7 and
AtBGAL15, which clustered in group b, were found to be
expressed in flower [12] and pollen [31]. It may be that
the ancestral genes for these enzymes developed reproductive-tissue specific roles before the ancestors of monocots and dicots diverged. If these functions are conserved,
these isozymes may have similar roles in the two plants,
though these functions remain to be determined.
Among the other plant-like genes, it is likely many of
them act in cell wall metabolism, but these roles are yet to
be discerned. OsBgal1 was shown to hydrolyze β-(1→3)-,
β-(1→4)- and β-(1→6)-linked oligosaccharides and, at a
low level, arabinogalactan and be expressed in a range of
vegetative and reproductive tissues [38], so it may have a
general role on similar substrates in the cell wall. OsBgal2,
OsBgal3 and OsBgal7 are closely related to it, as are 4
tomato Bgals involved in fruit ripening [13] and an asparagus Bgal thought to act in senescence [56], so a cell wall
function seems likely for these other cluster c1 isozymes
as well, though such a role must be proven. Kaneko and
Kobayashi [37] showed that OsBgal8, which is secreted
from rice tissue culture cells, could release galactose from
galactoxyloglucans and pectic galactans. So, a role in cell
wall metabolism is quite likely for this group a isozyme.
The role of OsBgal6 remains obscure, as no closely related
enzyme has been characterized, however it seems to be
specific to vegetative tissues of the young plant. The fact

that the transcript found in panicle was misspliced to prevent production of active enzyme is intriguing, but the
functional implications of the alternative splicing of both
OsBgal6 and OsBgal11 remain to be clarified.

Conclusion
Fifteen rice glycosyl hydrolase family 35 genes encoding
putative β-galactosidases were identified in this study.
This number is similar to the 17 seen in Arabidopsis and
these plants appear to contain 9 common gene lineages
present in their ancestors before they diverged [12].
OsBgal9 was clustered into the same group as Bgals from
animal species, such as H. sapiens and D. melanogaster in
the phylogenetic tree, while the other rice BGals fall in a
nearly plant-specific subfamily of Bgals, most of which
contain a C-terminal lectin-like domain. The presence of
both types of β-galactosidase in the moss P. patens, a nonvascular plant, suggests that both types of genes were
present early in plant evolution. Within the plant-type
Bgals, group a (Figure 1), contains 7 OsBgals and many
Bgals that have been characterized from other plants (for
example, 9 of Arabidopsis, 4 of C. arietinum and 3 of L. esculentum), including some with and some without C-terminal galactose-binding-lectin-like domains. Many of these
proteins, including OsBgal8 [37], appear to act on the cellwall-derived substrates. The isozymes of phylogenetic
groups b and c1, OsBgal5, OsBgal10, OsBgal11,
OsBgal14, and OsBgal15, appear to have reproductive-tissue specific functions, while OsBgal6 (group c2) is predominantly in young leaves and roots. OsBgal6 appeared
to undergo alternative splicing to prevent its production
in panicle, and alternative splicing was also found for

OsBgal11. Understanding the functions of this gene family
and significance of alternative splicing in this will require
further functional investigation.

Methods
Sequence data and database search
To find all GH35 genes in rice, tBLASTn searches [57] were
performed in the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) Genbank nr, indica rice genome, and
expressed sequence tags (dbEST) databases with OsBgal1
(AK102192) as the query. The retrieved OsBgal genes were
used to identify their Unigene cluster, Gene Locus, conserved domains, gene position on the 12 Oryza sativa
(rice) chromosomes, homolog genes, EST-based expression profiles and GEO profile in the NCBI databases
(please see Availability & requirements for more information). The number and positions of exons and introns for
each individual gene were determined by manually comparing the cDNA and predicted cDNA sequences with
their corresponding genomic DNA sequences. Homologous proteins from other organisms were retrieved by
links from the CAZY website (please see Availability &
requirements for more information) or by BLASTp
searches at NCBI. Putative signal peptides were predicted
with the SignalP program (please see Availability &
requirements for more information) [58]; and putative
N-glycosylation sites were identified with the NetNGlyc
[59]; (please see Availability & requirements for more
information) and manually inspected to remove NPS/T
sites.

Chromosomal locations of genes were identified on and
the map drawn with the NCBI map viewer (please see
Availability & requirements for more information). Segmental duplication analysis was done with DAGchainer
[60] and the TIGR rice segmental duplication database
(please see Availability & requirements for more information) with the maximum length distance permitted
between collinear gene pairs set to be 500 kb. LTR-retrotransposon elements, interspersed repeats and low complexity DNA sequences were identified with RepeatMasker
(please see Availability & requirements for more information).
Construction of phylogenetic trees
The multiple sequence alignment of β-galactosidase protein sequences from rice and other organisms was made
with ClustalW [61] and manually adjusted and edited to
remove unconserved N- and C-terminal regions with
Genedoc (please see Availability & requirements for more
information) [62]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by
the neighbor-joining facility in ClustalX 1.83 [63] and the
branching order verified for maximum parsimony with
the Protpars program in the PHYLIP software suite [64].

Plant material
Indica rice (Oryza sativa L., cv. KDML 105) seeds were
soaked under sterile conditions on tissue paper moistened
with sterile distilled water at 28°C until germination. Germinated rice was moved to soil-filled plastic pots and
grown until 15 days, then moved to large clay pots. Samples were collected every 3 days from seeding until 15 days
after seeding, then sampling was continued every month.
To attain more materials at the flowering stage, samples
were collected from KDML105 fields at the Pathum thani
Rice Research Center in November, 2005. The samples
were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
-80°C until use.
Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated from various tissues: germinated
seed, root, shoot, leaf blade, leaf sheath, node, internode,
initiating panicle, developing panicle, emerging panicle,
anther, flower, milk grain, and grain during dry down by
the following procedure. Tissues (100 mg) were ground to
powder under liquid nitrogen, then RNA was extracted
using RNeasy Plant Mini (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) or Sigma Spectrum RNA extraction (SigmaAldrich, St Louis, USA) kits. For starchy tissues: germinated seed and grain during dry down, RNA extractions
were first done with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA [65]), and the RNA further purified from the
extracts by the spin column procedure of the above RNA
extraction kits. The RNA was quantified in a spectrophotometer at 260 nm.

For RT-PCR, approximately 5 μg of total RNA was treated
with RQ1 RNase-free DNase I (Promega Corporation,
Madison, WI, USA). First stand cDNA was synthesized
from RNA template primed with Oligo (dT)20 with the
SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR
(Invitrogen). The gene-specific primers used for semiquantitative PCR were designed from the 3'UTR or 3' coding sequence of each β-galactosidase gene (Table 5). The
constitutively expressed β-Actin and Ubiquitin-6 genes
were used for normalization. The PCR (10 μl total volume) was done with a 10 ng or 100 ng aliquot of the first
stand cDNA as template and 0.5 units of Taq DNA
polymerase (Promega). The relative expression abundances were obtained by dividing the total densimetric
intensities measured on a Fluor-S gel documentation system with Quantity 1 software (Bio-RAD, Hercules, CA,
USA) for each gene by those for the control gene. All samples were assayed 3 times in separate reactions to give
means and standard deviations for the relative abundances.

Amplification of cDNA clones and sequencing
The first strand cDNA reverse-transcribed from RNA of
developing and emerging panicle was used as a template
to amplify OsBgal6, OsBgal11, and OsBgal15 cDNA. The
set of primers for amplification of partial or full-length
cDNA of each gene was designed from its genomic
sequence. The PCR was catalyzed by Pfu polymerase
(Promega) with heating at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 30
cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 30 s at the appropriate annealing
temperature, (58°C for most primers) and 5 min at 72°C,
and a final extension for 7 min at 72°C. The final product
was gel purified with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit
(QIAGEN), then sequenced by automated sequencing at
Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, Korea).

Two pairs of primers were used to amplify OsBgal6 cDNA:
(1), bgal6_startF (TCAGTCAGTAGTCAGACATG) and
bgal6_QIENEY_R (AATGCAGGCTCAATCATCAG); and
(2), bgal6_QIENEY_F (GATGATTGAGCCTGCATTTG)
and bgal6_stopR (AGTTTCCTGTGTTGCATCAC). The
full-length sequence of OsBgal6 was determined with the
above primer sets and additional primers, including
bgal6_1163r (GGTGTGTTATGCTGATCGAAG),
bgal6_1650f (GGATTCTGGCGCCTACATG),bgal6_1143
F (CTTCGATCAGCATAACACACC), and bgal6_1671r
(CCATGTAGGCG CCAGAATC).
The oligonucleotide primers used for amplification of a
partial OsBgal11 cDNA were: bgal11_Seq_r1 (TCATCGCATGTGCAGTG) and bgal11_STOP_R (CCTTCTTCCTAAGCCGCCTG).

The Osbgal15 cDNA was amplified with 2 pairs of primers.
First, the bgal15_START_F (CGCGTGCCGGCGATGAAG)
and bgal15_QIENE_Rev (CTCGTTTTCAATCTGTGCCAG)
primers were used to amplify a 5' cDNA fragment, and the
bgal15_QIENEY_F (CTGGCACAGATTGAAAACGAG) and
bgal15_STOP_R (TATCAACATGAAGCCTGAACGGTG)
primers were used to amplify an overlapping 3' cDNA
fragment. The products of these first two PCR were mixed
and a sequential PCR was performed with the
bgal15_START_F and bgal15_STOP_R primers. The fulllength CDS cDNA was cloned into the EcoRIsite of pBluescript KS(+) by standard methods [66]. The recombinant
plasmid was sequenced with the T7, M13,
bgal15QIENE_F, bgal15QIENE_REV, bgal15_1138_F
(ACTCATCTTCTGCCTGCTTG), and Bgal15_1797_R
(TACGGTGCCATTGTTG TTG) primers.
Expression of OsBgal13
A cDNA encoding the predicted mature OsBgal13 protein
was amplified from the full-length cDNA clone of Genbank Accession AK065546[67], obtained from the Rice
Genome Resource Center, Tsukuba, Japan. The plasmid
clone was used as template for amplification with the
bgal13matN
(CACCGCCGCCGCGTATGC)
and
bgal13stopR (GATCACATCTCACCGCGAGGCTC) primers and Pfu polymerase (Promega), according the supplier's instructions. The PCR product was gel-purified and
cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen),
according to the supplier's instructions, and sequenced.
The cDNA was transferred into the pET32/DEST vector
[68] by an LR clonase reaction (Invitrogen). The thioredoxin fusion protein was expressed from this plasmid and
expressed as described for OsBgal1 by Chantarangsee et

al. [38]. The protein was extracted and purified on Ni-NTA
IMAC resin (QIAGEN), as with OsBgal1 [38], except that
0.1 mg/mL soybean trypsin inhibitor was added to the
extraction buffer, and the protein was eluted from the
IMAC column with 5–20 mM imidazole. The OsBgal13
protein was further purified by gel-filtration on a Superdex S200 column. The purified OsBgal13 was tested for
glycone specificity by incubation of enzyme with 1 mM pnitrophenyl (pNP) glycosides for 30 min at 30°C, followed by stopping the reaction with 2 volumes 0.4 M
Na2CO3 and measuring the 405 nm absorbance on a
microtiter plate. Action on galactose-containing oligosaccharides and polysaccharides was determined by incubating with 1 mM oligosaccharide or 0.5% polysaccharide at
30°C 24 h, then separating the products on TLC and
detecting carbohydrates, as previously described [38].
