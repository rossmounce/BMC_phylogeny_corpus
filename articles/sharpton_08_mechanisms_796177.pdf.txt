Intron gain and loss in Cryptococcus

Abstract
Background: Genome comparisons across deep phylogenetic divergences have revealed that
spliceosomal intron gain and loss are common evolutionary events. However, because of the deep
divergences involved in these comparisons, little is understood about how these changes occur,
particularly in the case of intron gain. To ascertain mechanisms of intron gain and loss, we
compared five relatively closely related genomes from the yeast Cryptococcus.
Results: We observe a predominance of intron loss over gain and identify a relatively slow intron
loss rate in Cryptococcus. Some genes preferentially lose introns and a large proportion of intron
losses occur in the middle of genes (so called internal intron loss). Finally, we identify a gene that
displays a differential number of introns in a repetitive DNA region.
Conclusion: Based the observed patterns of intron loss and gain, population resequencing and
population genetic analysis, it appears that recombination causes the widely observed but poorly
understood phenomenon of internal intron loss and that DNA repeat expansion can create new
introns in a population.

Background

The evolutionary dynamics of spliceosomal introns has
remained a subject of considerable debate since their discovery over 30 years ago [1]. Although the dynamic nature of
gene structure is well documented - intron position is not
always conserved between orthologs - the frequency of intron
gain and loss and the mechanisms behind these processes
remain controversial subjects. Indeed, single gene analyses
have identified examples of both gain and loss, but such single
case studies are limited in scope and, consequently, trends
and patterns are difficult to identify. With comparative
genomics, many orthologs can be evaluated simultaneously.

Thus, enough events can be characterized to identify trends
and to infer mechanisms pertinent to intron evolution. Several studies have employed such techniques across deep phylogenetic distances to evaluate the relative contributions of
intron gain and loss [2-4]. While successful at demonstrating
the plasticity of eukaryotic gene structure evolution, the long
times for evolutionary events associated with comparisons of
deep divergence can confound estimation of the true number
of events and elucidation of mechanisms responsible for
these events [5]. Comparative analysis of recently diverged
taxa may improve estimation of the number of intron gains
and losses and identify the mechanisms responsible for the

evolution of this aspect of gene structure. In this regard, the
Cryptococcus species complex offers the ideal system to study
the mechanisms of intron gain and loss.
Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii speciated
less than 100 million years ago, so comparing these two species should avoid the problems of deep divergence while
allowing enough time for intron gain and loss to occur [6,7].
A Basidiomycete yeast that causes the disease cryptococcosis
in humans [8], Cryptococcus is subdivided into four serotypes. Currently, genome sequences are available for five
strains spanning three of the serotypes (A, D1 and D2 from C.
neoformans and B1 and B2 from C. gatii; C. gatii serotype C
is not represented by a genome sequence; Figure 1). Additionally, D1 has particularly good gene structure annotation due
to an extensive expressed sequence tag (EST) database
(approximately 23,000 sequences) [9]. By evaluating the conservation of introns across the Cryptococcus clade, we estimated the rate of intron loss in Cryptococcus, identified
genes that rapidly lose introns, propose an intron loss mechanism and discovered a gene that gained two introns through
DNA repeat expansion.

Results
Estimation of divergence time
In a previous study, Xu et al. [7] used a four-gene phylogeny
to estimate that C. neoformans and C. gatii diverged roughly
37 million years ago. We evaluated this prediction by estimating the silent substitution rate (dS) from all aligned orthologs
from the five available Cryptococcus genomes. Pairwise comparisons between serotypes A/D and B identified dS esti-

mates of approximately 0.32. Previous work found that the
Eurotiomycete neutral mutation rate ranges from 1e-8 to 1e9 mutations per year depending on the method of rate calculation [10]. Thus, assuming midpoint rooting and a molecular
clock rate of evolution similar to the Eurotiomycetes, we estimate that C. neoformans and C. gatii diverged between 16
and 160 million years ago. Employing a commonly applied
neutral mutation rate of 2 × 10-9 suggests that the two species
diverged 80 million years ago, doubling previous estimates
that applied these same assumptions [7,11]. However,
because of the difficulty of equating sequence divergence with
time, we report all rate calculations and comparisons in terms
of this date approximation as well as dS. For the purposes of
identifying fixed structural changes by parsimony, we consider D1 and D2 to be the same species, and, therefore, consider the branch subtending these two strains to be a terminal
branch. We calculate the total terminal branch length to be
0.29 substitutions per silent site, and use this figure to calculate the rate of observed gene structure changes on terminal
branches.

Intron loss predominates
The reference strain, D1, has an intron-dense genome with
36,275 introns across 6,954 genes (average of 5.5 introns per
gene). Cryptococcus thus exhibits a density more similar to
humans (7.8) than to other fungi, such as Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (0.05), Neurospora crassa (1.77) or Ustilago maydis (0.75) (from [12]). This relative intron abundance may be
driven by intron gain, a rarely observed phenomenon across
such short phylogenetic distances. Thus, we sought to determine the relative contribution of intron gain and loss in the
evolution of Cryptococcus gene structure.
We aligned orthologs of D1 genes from four other Cryptococcus genomes and searched for D1 introns that were missing in
at least one other taxon. We evaluated 33,473 D1 introns
across 5,700 orholog sets and identified 49 cases where at
least one ortholog was lacking an entire intron in an unambiguous alignment (Figure 2). Using parsimony analysis to distinguish intron gains from losses, it appears that intron loss
significantly predominates over gain along the evolution of
the Cryptococcus clade. Of the 49 events, there are 31 cases of
unambiguous loss along a lineage. We found no instances of
unambiguous gain. There remain 18 unresolved events due to
an inability to infer the ancestral state of the character. A
search for orthologous introns in U. maydis, Phanerochaete
chrysosporium and Coprinus cinereus failed to resolve these
changes as gain or loss. If each loss is considered an independent event and all 49 events are assumed to be losses, the
fastest approximate intron loss rate of 1.04 × 10-11 introns per
year (5.2 × 10-3 times dS) can be inferred (1 - x1/T), where x is
the proportion of retained ancestral introns and T is the time
since divergence (estimated from terminal branch dS), as in
[3]. Resampling analysis of the 49 intron deletion events provided a 95% confidence interval of this rate of 9.67 × 10-12 to
3.08 × 10-11 (4.84 × 10-3 to 1.54 × 10-2). This intron loss rate is

significantly slower than that previously calculated for
Schizosaccharomyces pombe (2 × 10-9), and may, in part,
account for the relatively high intron density in Cryptococcus
[3].

Some genes preferentially lose introns
Introns have been popular phylogenetic markers under the
assumption that gains and losses are relatively rare and
unlikely to be the result of parallel evolution [13]. However,
analysis of the Dipteran white gene warned that some genes
might be prone to parallel gene structure changes [14]. Additionally, studies have shown that some highly expressed
genes are prone to losing introns and may be evolving more
rapidly than previously assumed [15]. We examined Cryptococcus gene structure evolution to identify genes that rapidly
undergo intron gain or loss. Because of the phylogenetic
structure of the taxa involved in this study and the restriction
of the analysis to serotype D introns, it is impossible to resolve
true parallel loss of an intron in serotype A and in serotype B
taxa (as it would appear to be a gain in the serotype D clade).

Thus, we searched for loci that lost different introns along
multiple branches. Assuming that the 49 gene structure
changes are all losses, the probability that a gene will lose an
intron is 1.5e-3. Assuming, then, that there are five introns in
a gene, the probability of a single gene losing two independent
introns is 1.13e-5. Because such events are unlikely to occur
by chance alone, the identification of such events suggests
that some genes preferentially lose introns. We identified two
loci that appear to rapidly evolve their gene structure, losing
single, different introns along independent lineages.
CNE00990, a ubiquinone biosynthesis-related protein that
ancestrally exhibited 5 introns, lost its first intron in B1 and
its fifth intron in A. Similarly, CNF02410, a cytoplasmic protein containing five ancestral introns, lost its second intron in
A and its fourth intron in B1. Both loci are single copy in the
genome and are supported with ESTs. If we treat the adjacent
intron losses observed as single loss events, these relatively
rapid gene structure changes constitute 11.1-22.2% (depending on whether the ambiguous events are true losses) of the
losses observed. Though the sample size is small, this sug-

Poly-A primed mRNA derived intron loss
Poly-A primed mRNA derived intron loss. (a) Reverse transcriptase mediated intron loss. Step 1: a gene is transcribed by RNA polymerase (RNAP) and
the transcript contains both exons (black boxes) and introns (lines between boxes). The transcript is processed to mature mRNA by splicing out introns
and adding a poly-A tail to the 3' end. Step 2: reverse transcriptase (RT) primes off of the poly-A tail to create a cDNA (blue boxes), but falls off in a
length-dependent fashion. Step 3: the partial cDNA then recombines with the gene. Step 4: the resulting gene has lost any introns that span the
recombination junction. (b) Meiotic recombination can create internal intron losses. An individual from a population of Cryptococcus starts with a fourintron wild-type allele (step 1; exons are colored boxes). A subsequent poly-A primed mRNA-mediated mutation of said allele generates a 3' loss allele in
this individual (as indicated by asterisks, introns 2, 3, and 4 are lost). This individual mates with another individual in the population that carries the wildtype allele (step 2). During meiosis, the alleles may pair and recombine, as in step 3. Depending upon the location of the recombination event (crossing
lines in step 3), various recombinant progeny alleles will be generated (step 4). The final product is a 3' loss allele (missing introns 3 and 4) and an internal
intron loss allele (missing only intron 2). Assuming neutrality, both recombinant alleles have an equal probability of eventually being fixed in the population.

gests that a sizable number of gene structure changes in Cryptococcus may not be stochastic, and may help to explain why
parsimony-based inferences of intron loss over larger evolutionary distances tend to underestimate parallel losses and,
consequently, overestimate intron gains [16].

Evaluation of a common intron loss mechanism
The mechanism of intron loss has been the subject of considerable debate [17]. While several mechanisms may work in
concert to create the observed loss patterns, the best-supported mechanism involves reverse transcription of a spliced
mRNA and homologous recombination between the resulting
intron-free cDNA and the intron containing genomic locus
(Figure 3a) [18]. Additionally, to explain the relative paucity
of introns at the 3' end of most genes in most eukaryotic
genomes (Additional data file 2), it has been suggested that
priming of reverse transcriptase occurs at the poly-A tail on
the 3' end of the mRNA [19,20], which favors 3' intron loss
over 5' loss via recombination of partial cDNAs. This mechanism should favor the loss of consecutive introns beginning
from the 3' end and all losses should show precise intron
deletion of sequence between the splice sites. To test the
hypothesis of spliced mRNA intron loss, we evaluated the pattern of intron loss in Cryptococcus.
First, we investigated adjacent intron loss by searching for
multiple, adjacent intron losses and then determined the like-

lihood that the losses were due to a single evolutionary event.
Some genes have lost more than one intron, as evidenced by
the observation that 31 parsimoniously explained intron
losses occurred in only 16 loci. Specifically, genes CNI01550,
CNN02320, and CNA01350 unambiguously demonstrate
multiple, consecutive intron losses (Additional data file 1).
Genes CNK02730 and CNB02430 also have consecutive
introns missing in orthologs, but it is uncertain if these
changes are the result of intron loss. In their study of fungal
introns, Stajich and Dietrich [21] employed a comparative
method that resolved the events in CNK02730 as losses.
Here, given the relative rarity of intron gain and the lack of
any clear mechanism that would enable multiple adjacent
gains, we treat the changes in these two genes as losses. However, without the necessary phylogenetic support, characterization of these particular events is not conclusive.
Multiple adjacent intron loss may be caused by a single evolutionary event (that is, the spliced mRNA based model) or by
multiple, independent losses. To distinguish between these
hypotheses, we generated a loss distribution for each gene
demonstrating adjacent loss via a resampling analysis under
the assumption that losses were random and independent
across a gene (see Materials and methods). These distributions were used to test the null hypothesis that the observed
losses were the result of independent loss events within the
gene (Additional data file 1). This analysis thus evaluates how

intron loss is distributed across the length of a gene regardless
of that gene's intron loss rate. In every gene except
CNA03150, the null hypothesis could be rejected, supporting
the hypothesis that one event accounted for all intron losses
within a single gene. This observation of simultaneous adjacent loss suggests that an mRNA mediated loss mechanism

data to determine if 3' terminal losses are significantly more
numerous than 5' terminal intron losses (one case). Furthermore, only one of the adjacent, multiple intron loss events
previously described included a loss of the 3' terminal intron
(CNK02730). Taken together, these findings suggest an alternative mechanism of loss or a variation on the simple poly-A
primed mechanism previously described.

Given, then, that cDNA likely plays a role in intron loss, we
evaluated whether these cDNAs originated at the 3' poly-A
tail of the transcript. A histogram of the relative positions of
lost introns in a gene indicates a 3' preference for intron loss
(Figure 4a). We also investigated the relationship between
intron loss and absolute distance from the 3' end of the gene.
Most loss events occur within 1,000 bp of the poly-A tail
(median = 672 bp; Figure 4b), but there are extreme cases
where the enzyme would have had to synthesize over 4,000
bp of cDNA under this priming model. Additionally, most
losses appear as internal islands in the gene; there are few lost
introns that are followed by the loss of all downstream 3'
intron positions. Only three events (including CNK02730)
involve the loss of the 3' terminal intron (in the two other
cases, it was the only intron lost) and there are not enough

Identification of a polymorphic, gained intron
We found no clear examples of completely new D1 introns;
however, we did find a D1 gene with additional identical
introns compared to A and D2. By submitting every intron to
a BLASTn homology search against the rest of the genome, we
identified the gene CNN00420, a single copy, six-intron gene
in D1 in which introns 3, 4 and 5 are identical and differ from
intron 2 by a single point mutation; intron 6 has additional 3'
sequence. The introns in this gene are supported by unique
ESTs, indicating that the gene is functional and that splicing
occurs at the canonical splice sites (GT|AG). The orthology
detection method employed in the previously discussed comparative analysis failed to detect this locus due to the lack of
identifiable orthologs in the serotype B genomes. By relaxing
this criterion, orthologs were identified in A (CNAG_06312

[12]) and D2 (GenBank: CNBN0400). The subsequent alignment identified two D1 intron sequences (introns 3 and 5)
that correspond to gaps in the orthologs, implicating gains in
the D1 lineage. Examination of CNN00420 reveals two types
of repeats in the gene: short, internal exonic repeats (approximately 39 nucleotides in length) and longer repeats that
include the ends of exons as well as a full length intron
(approximately 107 nucleotides in length) (Additional data
file 4). The alignment between the D1 and D2 orthologs
indicates that the creation of extra copies of this longer repeat
was responsible for the intron gains in the D1 sequence.
To rule out genome sequencing and contig assembly artifacts,
we resequenced CNN00420 from the Cryptococcus serotype
D population (strains TP0603, WM629, JEC20 (sib to D1),
B3502 (sib to D1 and parent to D2) and genomic strains D2
and D1). Our new sequence verified that the genome
sequences are correct and showed that the intron in D1 is
shared with sib JEC20 and parent B3502 (Additional data file
5). Sequence from the additional individuals demonstrates a
differential number of D1 intron containing repeats among
the strains, suggesting that an expansion or contraction in the
number of repeats accounts for the unique sequence in D1
(Additional data file 6). Because A lacks the introns and
because the introns lay within a repeat, the most parsimonious explanation for the unique intron sequence is that it was
gained by duplication in D1.

Discussion

Cryptococcus genes are more intron-dense than those of
other fungi [9], suggesting that Cryptococcus either gained
introns at a faster rate or lost introns at a slower rate than
other fungi. A screen of 33,473 introns across five taxa identified 31 intron losses and no intron gains. Because of a lack of
phylogenetic resolution, an additional 18 gene structure
changes could not be unequivocally attributed to intron gain
or loss. While some of these unresolved events could be gains,
a previous analysis of Cryptococcus gene structure evolution
that screened for intron gain in the serotype A and B lineages
also found no clear cases of gain [21]. If introns have been
gained since Cryptococcus diverged, then they have done so
at a much lower rate than losses or in such a way that makes
detection difficult. Intron loss appears to be a rare event
(0.09% of introns evaluated were lost) in Cryptococcus,
occurring, under conditions assuming the most possible loss,
at a rate of 1.04 × 10-11 introns per year (5.2 × 10-3 time dS), or
4.33 × 10-12 introns per year (2.17 × 10-3) if adjacent losses are
single events. Conversely, the intron loss rate in S. pombe is 2
× 10-9 introns per year [3]. It should be noted that the S.
pombe rate, the only other intron loss rate calculated in fungi,
was estimated by comparing S. pombe to the Opisthikont
ancestor (estimated divergence approximately 1,500 million
years ago). As the rate of intron loss may not be constant,
there could have been moments during the much longer
period assessed for S. pombe that matched the rate that we

calculated over 80 million years of Cryptococcus evolution.
These results suggest that the relatively large intron density of
Cryptococcus compared to other fungi is not the result of a
faster rate of intron gain, but rather a slower rate of intron
loss.
Not all genes in the genome, however, appear to lose introns
at the same rate. We identified two loci that have lost different
introns along multiple, independent lineages. These gene
structure changes are unlikely the result of chance and may be
driven by some gene specific bias to lose introns. Whatever
the cause, this finding suggests that introns may be lost in
parallel over relatively recent time scales. This should raise
caution about using an intron as a phylogenetic marker, a relatively common technique in evolutionary analysis. Further
studies of such genes may help identify any selective pressures associated with relatively unstable gene structures.
We identified five genes that lost several adjacent introns, a
pattern indicative of a spliced mRNA-intermediate intron
loss mechanism (Figure 3a) [10]. If reverse transcriptase creates cDNA by initiating at the poly-A tail of the transcript and
if homologous recombination between the ends of the spliced
cDNA and the intron-containing gene causes intron loss, then
we would expect to identify a bias towards 3' intron loss and a
single loss event should frequently remove multiple introns
and always include the 3' terminal intron in the loss. We do
observe a bias towards 3' intron loss (Figure 3a), but when we
evaluate where intron losses occur, they are most frequently
internal; we rarely observe the loss of the 3' terminal intron.
While it may be argued that natural selection may favor 3'
intron retention, studies on this subject indicate otherwise,
observing only a 5' intron retention bias [22]. It is noteworthy
that Cryptococcus is not the only organism in which internal
intron loss predominates. A previous analysis found that
extraordinarily long exons, which result from intron loss,
accumulate internally in the genes of many Eukaryotes [23]
and a survey of Ascomycete gene structure evolution identified an internal intron loss bias [4]. Given the diversity of
these observations, a general mechanism of internal intron
loss should be considered.
Several mechanisms could explain internal intron loss via a
spliced mRNA intermediate. First, the points of homologous
recombination between the cDNA and the gene may occur
upstream of the 3' most intron, resulting in its persistence by
being excluded from the double cross-over event. Given that
the mechanism proposed for intron loss involving mRNA is
the same as that proposed for the origin of processed pseudogenes, if internal recombination was common, one would
expect to find processed pseudogenes that are internal segments of genes. However, to our knowledge, there are few
examples of processed pseudogenes that are internal gene
segments [24]. Another point arguing against internal recombination is the model that the ends of cDNA molecules, and
not internal regions, which necessarily exclude the 3' intron,

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R24

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/1/R24

promote cross-over through double strand break machinery
[25]. In the same publication, Hu proposes a different model
for internal intron loss. Here, intron loss could occur when an
intron experiences a double strand break and if cDNA is used
to repair the damage. However, this model would result only
in single intron losses and could not explain our observations
of adjacent intron loss.
Perhaps the mechanism with the best support is so-called
self-primed reverse transcription. Here, internal initiation of
reverse transcriptase occurs because the 3' end of the mRNA
folds back onto the transcript and complementary pairs with
some upstream region of mRNA (resulting in a hairpin in the
secondary structure). cDNA is then synthesized from the
region upstream of this base-pairing. This mechanism is suspected to cause the 4f-rnp intron loss polymorphism in Drosophila [26] and is implicated in the loss of internal introns in
many eukaryotes, including several fungi (Aspergillus nidulans, Fusarium graminearum, Magnaporthe grisea, N.
crassa, Plasmodium falciparum, S. pombe, and U. maydis)
[22]. While subsequent mutation impedes our ability to
determine if this mechanism contributes to intron loss (for
example, erosion of the complementary sequence), the pattern of loss observed in Cryptococcus suggests a different
mechanism contributes to internal intron loss. Because there
is no known bias regarding where, along the length of a transcript, the 3' end can complementary pair, this hairpin-based
loss mechanism should produce intron losses along the
length of a gene with equal probability. The majority of losses,
however, cluster toward the 3' end of the gene (Figure 4a).
Additionally, while there are losses that occur at extreme
distances from the 3' end of the gene in Cryptococcus (Figure
4b), all losses are at distances smaller than the known, active
fungal retrotransposons. Reverse transcriptase is, then, capable of synthesizing cDNA from the transcript's poly-A tail to
these distant positions. Indeed, the only observation that
does not fit the requirements of the poly-A primed mechanism is that intron loss events frequently exclude 3' terminal
introns. Given this loss pattern, we propose a simple explanation to account for the observation of internal intron loss
(shown in Figure 3b). If, within a population, an allele that
had lost a series of introns via recombination with a poly-A
initiated cDNA were to undergo meiotic recombination with
an allele that retained 3' introns, the pattern of internal intron
loss could be created.
To determine if this mechanism is likely, we employed an
allelic sojourn time density function derived from a diffusion
approximation to estimate the frequency with which an initially single-copy, 3' poly-A primed intron loss allele recombines with a wild-type allele before being absorbed or fixed in
the population (see Materials and methods). While we cannot
be certain about historical recombination rates, we can make
a reasonable estimation by employing the measured meiotic
recombination rate determined for C. neoformans serotype D
[27]. Our analysis estimates that 'internal intron loss' alleles

Volume 9, Issue 1, Article R24

Sharpton et al. R24.7

are generated at a rate 2.08 times that of '3'-generated intron
loss' alleles. Assuming equal probability of fixation, we therefore might expect approximately twice as many genes to
exhibit internal intron loss as genes exhibiting a 3' loss of two
or more introns, even though all intron losses are originally
caused by reverse transcription from the 3' poly-A tail. This
model for internal intron loss is built upon an experimentally
verified method of cDNA creation (initiation at the poly-A
tail), explains the relative clustering of 3' intron loss and,
assuming meiotic recombination occurs at random positions
between the cDNA and the gene, accounts for the diverse distribution of losses observed (Additional data file 3). To our
knowledge, this is the first time such a mechanism has been
described to explain the observation of internal intron loss.
While we found no intron gains between the two Cryptococcus species, we did identify a gene that has gained introns
within C. neoformans. The D1 gene CNN00420 contains
unique intron sequences relative to orthologs in A and D2 (no
orthologs could be identified in serotype B). Resequencing
strains from the serotype D population confirmed that these
introns in the D1 allele are unique, implicating a sequence
gain. Because each gained intron has exact identity to three
other introns in the gene (and near exact identity to two others), it is likely that unequal crossing over, gene conversion or
repeat expansion through replication strand slippage caused
the gains. While we cannot discern which of these DNA duplicating mechanisms caused the intron gains in question, several studies have shown that replication strand slippage is a
common and frequent means of varying intergenic repeat
copy number. In Escherichia coli, RecA independent duplications and deletions between repeats of several hundred bases
have been shown to occur at high frequency (10-5 to 10-4 per
cell generation) [28]. In an elegant analysis of FLO gene
repeat variation in yeast, Verstrepen et al. [29] concluded
that replication slippage is the cause of the observed length
polymorphisms and that the repeats could be at least 100
nucleotides in length. Here, we propose its role in generating
new introns in CNN00420 (Additional data file 7).
To our knowledge, there is only one other example of an
intron gain occurring through repeat duplication. Knowles
and McLysaght [30] suggested that this mechanism is
responsible for a gained intron in the TOUCH3 gene relative
to its paralog in Arabidopsis. However, though there is debate
on this point [31], paralogs may undergo wholly different
gene structure evolution than orthologs [2]. Additionally, the
role of the Arabidopsis whole genome duplication on gene
structure evolution is uncertain. Our analysis verifies that this
mechanism can create introns in orthologs and contributes to
gene structure divergence between species. Furthermore, this
is the first time a DNA repeat expansion has been observed to
create an intron polymorphism.
In his study of intron gain rates, Roy noted that certain
ancient lineages underwent big bursts of intron gain while

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R24

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/1/R24

Genome Biology 2008,

subsequent lineages experienced a precipitous decline in
intron gain rates [3]. This suggests that these early lineage
introns may have been created via a wholly different mechanism than those created in contemporary times. While we do
not suspect that intron containing repeat expansion is the
mechanism responsible for the origin of most introns, it
appears to be a more widespread mechanism than previously
expected and may be an important contemporary means of
creating new intronic sequence in the genome. As additional
closely related genome sequences become available, future
comparative genomic studies should verify whether this
mechanism of gain is ubiquitous and identify other contemporary mechanisms that create introns.

Materials and methods
Genome sequences utilized
The C. neoformans serotype D strain JEC21 (D1) genome
sequence and annotation was obtained from GenBank as
deposited by TIGR (January 2005, 20 Mb, 14 chromosomes).
A second serotype D strain sequence, B3501 (D2), was
obtained from the Stanford Genome Technology Center
(June 2004 assembly, 18.5 Mb, 70 contigs). The C. neoformans serotype A strain H99 (A) was sequenced by the Broad
Institute (October 2004 assembly, 19.5 Mb, 210 contigs). The
Broad Institute also sequenced the C. gatii serotype B strain
R265 (B1) (January 2005 assembly, 17.2 Mb, 28 contigs). The
second serotype B strain WM276 (B2) was obtained from the
BC Genome sequencing center (assembly dated March 2004,
18.0 Mb, 33 contigs).

Comparative analysis
Whole genome alignments were created through a multi-step
process using D1 as a reference. First, pairwise alignments
between D1 and the other sequenced strains were created
using PatternHunter [32]. Blocks of four-way homologous
contigs were then identified using a hierarchical syntenyclustering algorithm as described in [33]. Multiple alignments of homologous regions were generated using MultiLAGAN [34].
As described in [6], the annotation for D1 is well supported
because an extensive EST library was used to train the gene
structure predictive algorithms. Thus, we aligned orthologs to
each D1 reference gene and evaluated the conservation of
each annotated D1 intron across the alignment (Figure 2)
[35]. We identified orthologs of D1 genes by searching for best
all-way reciprocal BLASTn hits against the corresponding
genomes that also demonstrated syntenic conservation.
Because previous studies have demonstrated differential
tempos and modes of intron evolution between paralogs [30],
we elected to use this type of conservative ortholog detection
method [30]. To enable comparative analysis, each orthology
cluster had to include a sequence from serotype B, which represented the outgroup of the comparison.

Volume 9, Issue 1, Article R24

Sharpton et al. R24.8

Clusters of orthologs meeting these criteria were aligned separately from the whole genome alignment using the mLAGAN
multiple sequence alignment algorithm and the phylogeny
shown in Figure 1 as the guide tree. To identify introns in
these alignments, Perl scripts were constructed to overlay the
D1 gene annotation onto the alignment. We subsequently
identified sequences with gaps that completely spanned an
intron position. When we detected missing introns, the quality of the gene alignment was evaluated by eye and the principles of parsimony were used to infer whether the intron in
question had been gained or lost. For example, if A is missing
an intron sequence that is found in D1, D2, B1 and B2, then we
score the sequence as an intron loss in A. It should be noted
that parsimony has been shown to overestimate the relative
contribution of intron gain at large phylogenetic divergences
by effectively undercounting the number of parallel loss
events [16]. The close evolutionary distance involved in this
study should mitigate this problem.
The unrooted phylogenetic topology among the five
sequenced strains was determined by a neighbor-joining
analysis [36] on a concatenation of all orthologous open reading frames. Branch lengths based on silent site divergence
observed across a concatenation of 5,700 aligned ortholog
clusters were estimated using the codeml application (model
= 0, NSsites = 0, ncatG = 1) from the PAML 3.15 package [37].

Resequencing analysis
Genome sequenced strains JEC21(D1) and B3051(D2), as
well as additional serotype D individuals TP0603, WM629,
JEC20 and B3502, were generously provided by W Meyer.
The method of Bolano was used to extract genomic DNA from
strains grown in liquid culture [38]. Conserved regions of the
alignment between the D1 and D2 genome sequences were
used to construct PCR primers for touchdown PCR. Amplified
target DNA was cloned with Invitrogen's TopoTA cloning kit
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and subject to standard
BigDye (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) sequencing procedures as in [39]. Sequencher (v4.2.2, Gene Codes
Corp., Ann Arbor, MI, USA) was used to identify high quality
sequence reads and BioEdit's CAP contig assembly tool was
used to construct full length sequences [40]. Initial alignments were generated by ClustalW and edited by hand [41].

Diffusion approximation
We applied a sojourn time density function derived from a
diffusion approximation to estimate the probability that a
recombination event between a 3' generated intron loss allele
(defined in Results) and a wild-type allele could result in an
allele missing only internal introns (Additional data file 8)
[42-44]. Let y represent the vector {x, N, s, h}, where x, 0 ≤ x
≤ 1, represents the frequency of an element in a population of
N individuals, s is the intensity of selection acting on the allele
and h is a heterozygous fitness factor. A newly created element thus appears in the population at a frequency of 1/2N.
Under standard assumptions of the diffusion approximation,

the amount of time, in N generations, an initially single copy
element spends in the population prior to being absorbed (x
= 0) or fixed (x = 1) is:
τ [ y] =

conservation events. We sampled, with replacement, 10,000
introns from this population and then calculated the frequency and subsequent rate. Calculations were conducted
10,000 times and a normal curve approximation of the subsequent rate distribution was used to calculate the 95% confidence interval.

as in [43]. Here, we assume that there is no selective pressure
acting on intron retention (s = 0), that the population is sufficiently large (2N = 10e5), and that the only value for any x <
1/2N is x = 0. Because s = 0, we need not estimate h, the dominance coefficient. Under these assumptions, the frequency
spectrum of alleles is given approximately by:

F [ y] =

τ [ y]
1 τ [ y]dx
∫0

Of interest is the frequency that an allele missing 3' introns
recombines with a wild-type allele (no missing introns) to
create a recombinant allele that is missing only internal
introns. This can be estimated by defining the probability of
recombination between dissimilar alleles as a function of
allele frequency and integrating over the frequency spectrum
as follows:
1

τ [ y]
2 NLrx (1 − x )dx
1 τ [ y]dx

Here, r is the recombination rate and L is the average exon
length. In Cryptococcus, these values are 7.58e-7 recombination events per base-pair per generation [27] and 253 bp,
respectively. Incorporating these values returns an expectation of 2.08 recombination events that would create 'internal
intron loss' alleles for every '3 intron loss' allele generated by
mutation, suggesting that, on average, 'internal intron loss'
alleles are generated at a rate approximately 2.08 times that
of '3' intron loss' alleles.

Statistics
Resampling analysis was conducted to determine intron loss
rate 95% confidence intervals. A total population of 33,473
introns (equal to the total number of screened orthologous
introns) was established, where 49 introns in the population
corresponded to loss events and the remainder were intron

Resampling analysis was also conducted for each gene demonstrating adjacent intron loss to determine the probability
that the adjacent losses were caused by random, independent
events. For each gene, a population equal to the number of
introns in the gene was established, where each individual in
the population has a value corresponding to an intron position within the gene. Samples equal to the number of
observed losses in the gene were taken from this population,
without replacement, and the longest consecutive run of adjacent introns was counted. After 10,000 runs, a histogram of
the longest runs was created and used to evaluate the null
hypothesis that the observed data were due to random, independent loss events.
