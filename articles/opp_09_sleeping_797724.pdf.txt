Abstract
Sleep is an enigma. Why animals forgo eating and reproducing, while potentially increasing their risk
of predation remains unknown. Although some may question whether all animals sleep, it is clear
that all living organisms possess defenses against attack by pathogens. Immune responses of humans
and animals are impaired by sleep loss, and responses to immune challenge include altered sleep.
Thus, sleep is hypothesized to be a component of the acute phase response to infection and to
function in host defense. Examining phylogenetic relationships among sleep parameters,
components of the mammalian immune system and resistance to infection may provide insight into
the evolution of sleep and lead to a greater appreciation for the role of sleep in host defense.

Sleep is perhaps the greatest enigma in all of biology.
Although there have been numerous hypotheses, the
question as to the function of sleep remains unanswered.
Sleep states are well characterized in mammals and birds,
and there is convincing evidence for sleep in animals of
"lower" phyla, including invertebrates [1]. Because many
characteristics of sleep differ quite dramatically across
phyla [2,3], it seems that the lowest common denominator of a core function(s) for sleep must exist at the cellular
level [4,5].
Although we may lack an unequivocal functional explanation for sleep, the same is not true for the immune system.
Quite simply, the function of the immune system is to
keep the organism alive in the face of constant attack by
pathogens. The physical and biochemical components of
the immune system are integrated into a complex network
that is, in many respects, analogous to the networks of
cells and transmitter substances that compose the central
nervous system. Like sleep, the immune system is phylogenetically ancient. Invertebrates exhibit inflammatory

responses to invading pathogens that are functionally
equivalent to those of vertebrates [6]. The ability of invertebrates to effectively defend themselves against pathogens is evidenced by their nearly 1 billion years of
evolution and the fact they comprise about 95% of the 2
million extant animal species.
The relationship between sleep and the immune system
has long been known, but only recently have these interactions been systematically investigated. Investigators
have generally used two approaches. In one, human volunteers or laboratory animals are sleep deprived and
effects on selected immune parameters determined. The
other uses laboratory animals (and in some cases
humans) that have been infected with pathogens or challenged with immunomodulators. It is now possible to
state that sleep loss alters immune function and that
immune challenge alters sleep. What are the mediators of
these bi-directional interactions between sleep and the
immune system?

Cytokines are the major orchestrators of host defense.
Almost twenty of these proteins have been studied to
determine effects on sleep. Of these, interleukin-1 (IL-1)
and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) have been demonstrated
to play a role in the regulation of normal mammalian non
rapid eye movement sleep. Data derived from electrophysiological, biochemical and molecular genetic studies
demonstrate that antagonizing the IL-1 or the TNF systems reduces spontaneous non rapid eye movement sleep
of freely behaving, healthy animals [7,8]. Furthermore,
when faced with antigenic challenge, activity of the IL-1
and TNF systems increases and so does non rapid eye
movement sleep.
Because sleep loss impairs immune function and immune
challenge alters sleep it has been hypothesized that sleep
may be considered a component of the acute phase
response to infection [9] and functions in host defense
[10]. If indeed this is the case, there should be evidence
that evolution has favored organisms that optimized the
relative investments in sleep and host defense. In this
issue, Preston and colleagues [11] ask whether correlations exist between sleep times of mammals and numbers
(and types) of white blood cells. Because white blood cells
are central to immune responses, these authors used
counts as a measure of species investment in the immune
system. Their results indicate that across 26 mammalian
species those with more total sleep have higher numbers
of white blood cells. This positive association of total
sleep time with numbers of cells was revealed in four out
of the five white blood cell types. Such correlations do not
exist for red blood cells, which served as controls because
they are derived from the same hematopoietic precursors
as white blood cells but have no direct immunological
function.
An increase in the number of white blood cells in species
that sleep more suggests they should be more immunocompetent. Are there indicators that the association
between increased sleep time and white blood cell counts
is adaptive? Analysis of sleep times of 12 mammalian species for which data also are available with respect to parasitic load indicates that a 10 hour increase in sleep time is
associated with a 24-fold decrease in parasitism. On the
basis of this intriguing relationship, Preston et al., [11]
conclude that species that have evolved longer sleep times
have been able to effectively increase their investment in
host defense and reduce the impact of parasites.
Results of this study demonstrate for the first time a correlation between phylogenetic sleep parameters and measures of immune investment. Preston et al., hypothesize
that sleep fuels the immune system and they demonstrate
increased resistance to parasites in mammalian species
that sleep more. But how is resistance to parasites con-

ferred? And what does parasite resistance of mammals
suggest about possible evolutionary relationships
between sleep and the immune system?
Although physical barriers are the first line of defense
against pathogens, increased numbers of white blood cells
suggest that what may be important in combating parasites is not just "keeping them out", but the response that
is mounted once the pathogen invades and is detected by
the host [12-14]. Is it possible that it was host defense
responses to antigenic challenge from multiple microbial
pathogens that selected for greater numbers of white
blood cells and subsequent evolution of sleep rather than
increased sleep time leading to greater immunocompetence?
Although they have evolved independently for more than
500 million years, most models postulate a monophyletic
origin for vertebrate and invertebrate immune systems
that predates the bifurcation in their evolution. For example, IL-1-, IL-6-, TNF-, and transforming growth factor
(TGF)-β-like molecules exist in annelids, mollusks, and
arthropods (all protostomes), and in echinoderms and
protochordates (deuterostomes). Not only do these
cytokines exist in invertebrates, they do so in neural tissue
[15-18]. The protostome nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
exhibits a sleep-like state during larval-stage transitions
called lethargus [19]. The only gene thus far implicated in
sleep-like behavior in C. elegans is egl-4, which signals
through the Decapentaplegic, BMP-like/transforming
growth factor-β pathway. Although we do not know
whether activation of innate immune defenses alters the
lethargus sleep-like state in C. elegans, loss of function of
Decapentaplegic, BMP-like-1 does increase sensitivity to
infection. Several mutant lines of the deuterostome insect
Drosophila exhibit short or long sleep [1,20-22], and sleepand wake-related genes have been identified [23]. Expression profiling demonstrates that about 400 Drosophila
genes are modulated during microbial infection, including the gene for the NF-κB-like transcription factor relish.
NF-κB is critical in host defense due to its role in cytokine
transcription and, as in rodents, flies that lack relish sleep
less, and relish increases during sleep deprivation [24].
Cytokines directly alter properties of neurons in the mammalian brain [25-27], including those in regions involved
in the regulation of sleep [28-32]. Although we do not yet
know those neural circuits involved in sleep of invertebrates, discharge rates of invertebrate neurons are altered
during inflammation or in response to cytokines [33,34].
Responses to antigenic challenge, independent of restactivity cycles or metabolic demands, could have led to
selection of a variety of processes in which ancestral
organisms must have engaged. It is not possible to know
if responses to antigenic challenge through the course of

evolution shaped complex behavior of animals in modern
phyla. In theory however, such responses could have
driven the evolution of many behaviors and physiological
processes in which cytokines are now implicated, including sleep, thermoregulation, feeding, and locomotion.
The study by Preston et al., indicates that sleep – immune
interactions may also be viewed within the context of phylogeny, thus providing additional clues in the search for
core function(s) of sleep.
