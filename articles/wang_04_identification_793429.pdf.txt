Abstract
Background: While researchers have utilized versions of the Affymetrix human GeneChip® for the assessment
of expression patterns in non human primate (NHP) samples, there has been no comprehensive sequence analysis
study undertaken to demonstrate that the probe sequences designed to detect human transcripts are reliably
hybridizing with their orthologs in NHP. By aligning probe sequences with expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in
NHP, inter-species conserved (ISC) probesets, which have two or more probes complementary to ESTs in NHP,
were identified on human GeneChip® platforms. The utility of human GeneChips® for the assessment of NHP
expression patterns can be effectively evaluated by analyzing the hybridization behaviour of ISC probesets.
Appropriate normalization methods were identified that further improve the reliability of human GeneChips® for
interspecies (human vs NHP) comparisons.
Results: ISC probesets in each of the seven Affymetrix GeneChip® platforms (U133Plus2.0, U133A, U133B,
U95Av2, U95B, Focus and HuGeneFL) were identified for both monkey and chimpanzee. Expression data was
generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 12 human and 8 monkey (Indian origin Rhesus
macaque) samples using the Focus GeneChip®. Analysis of both qualitative detection calls and quantitative signal
intensities showed that intra-species reproducibility (human vs. human or monkey vs. monkey) was much higher
than interspecies reproducibility (human vs. monkey). ISC probesets exhibited higher interspecies reproducibility
than the overall expressed probesets. Importantly, appropriate normalization methods could be leveraged to
greatly improve interspecies correlations. The correlation coefficients between human (average of 12 samples)
and monkey (average of 8 Rhesus macaque samples) are 0.725, 0.821 and 0.893 for MAS5.0 (Microarray Suite
version 5.0), dChip and RMA (Robust Multi-chip Average) normalization method, respectively.
Conclusion: It is feasible to use Affymetrix human GeneChip® platforms to assess the expression profiles of
NHP for intra-species studies. Caution must be taken for interspecies studies since unsuitable probesets will
result in spurious differentially regulated genes between human and NHP. RMA normalization method and ISC
probesets are recommended for interspecies studies.

Background
Microarray studies on non human primates (NHP) have
been used to address viral pathogenesis [1,2], neurological disorders [3], development [4] and phylogenetic studies [5-7]. Due to the lack of species-specific microarray
platforms for NHP, researchers have used GeneChip® platforms built using human sequence information. An
underlying assumption in such studies is that transcripts
of humans and NHP are highly conserved, and probe
sequences designed to detect human genes will detect
their orthologs in NHP samples. It is estimated that chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and humans shared 98.77 %
DNA similarity [8]. While this statistic is widely quoted
and believed, Britten [9] reported that the divergence
between humans and chimpanzees to be about 5%. Anzai
and colleagues [10] compared the chimpanzee MHC
region (1,750,601 bp) with the human HLA region
(1,870,955 bp), and concluded that the similarity drops
to 86.7% if insertions and deletions were taken into
account. All these analyses are based on genomic DNA
sequences; however, for microarray studies on the transcriptome, the similarity of RNA transcripts is the primary
concern. A single gene does not necessarily generate a single transcript. Splicing variants are very common in the
human [11,12], and humans and NHPs may use different
splicing strategies in some genes. Therefore, it is necessary
to re-assess the reliability of human GeneChips® for NHP
expression analysis.
Few published studies employing human GeneChip® platforms for NHP expression profiling have robustly
addressed the quantitative aspects of cross platform performance. Vahey and colleagues [1] used the HuGeneFL
GeneChip® and demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the dynamic range of the raw fluorescence distribution for equivalent amounts of human
cRNA and macaque cRNA hybridized to the chip. Chismar
and colleagues [13] used the U95Av2 GeneChip® platform
and compared the expression patterns of humans with
that of the rhesus macaque. They concluded that the percentage of 'present' calls observed in the transcriptome of
macaque brain is lower than that of human brain, and
that this is especially true for genes with lower signal
intensity. Caceres and colleagues [5] used the HG-U95Av2
arrays to identify upregulated genes in the human cortex
compared with those of the NHPs. Since sequence divergence could lead to an underestimation of expression levels in NHPs, they excluded 4572 probes that exhibited
different hybridization behaviour between two sets of
samples in order to reduce false positives. However, this
analysis is solely based on probe signal intensities. A more
robust way to assess the utility of human GeneChip® platforms for the study of expression profiles in NHP is to
employ a sequence analysis approach.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/165

In this study, we address the power of human GeneChip®
platforms to assess expression patterns in NHP samples
by: a) identifying ISC probesets based on sequence analysis; b) assessing intra (within NHP species)- and interspecies (between NHP and human samples) reproducibility
of GeneChip® data; and c) applying appropriate normalization methods to improve interspecies reproducibility.

Results and discussion
Identification of ISC probesets
When a probe sequence on the human GeneChip® hybridizes with the transcriptome of a NHP, there are three possible outcomes: 1) it hybridizes with the ortholog of the
NHP; 2) it cross-hybridizes with a non-ortholog transcript, or 3) it fails to hybridize due to sequence divergence. In Affymetrix GeneChip® system, a probeset is
composed of 11–20 probes and each probe is a 25-mer
oligo. We identified probes on the human GeneChip that
are complementary to ESTs in NHP postulating that these
probes would hybridize most optimally with the transcripts of NHP. We defined a probeset as an ISC probeset
if it had at least two complementary probes. The rationale
used to define the criterion that defines an ISC probeset is
described in the methods section. The procedure used to
generate ISC probesets is shown in Figure 1 and described
in methods section. ISC probesets in each of the seven
Affymetrix human GeneChip® platforms (U133Plus2.0,
U133A, U133B, U95Av2, U95B, Focus and HuGeneFL)
were generated for both monkey and chimpanzee.
Detailed information about each ISC probeset such as
probe sequence, GenBank accession and the position and
degree of matching is provided in the supplemental materials (Additional File 1,Additional File 2,Additional File
3,Additional File 4). Table 1 displays a summary of the
statistical characteristics of ISC probesets. Not surprisingly, there were more ISC probesets for monkey (Macaca
mulatta) than for chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). This is not
because monkey EST sequences are more similar to
human sequences than chimpanzee EST sequences, but
because we have a much greater amount of EST sequences
available for monkey. At the time of writing this manuscript, there were 33,474 monkey ESTs available, while
there were only 6,943 ESTs available for chimpanzee. As
the number of defined ESTs will increase in the future,
additional ISC probesets could be identified for both
monkey and chimpanzee using this method.

It is not uncommon, especially in the U133Plus2.0 platform, that multiple probesets target the same gene. For
example, in the U133A and the U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip®s, there are three probesets (217028_at,
211919_s_at and 209201_x_at) that target the gene
CXCR4 at different positions in its transcript. In order to
address this redundancy issue, we converted the number
of probesets into the number of unique UniGene clusters

are complementary to ESTs in NHP. A perfect probeset is the one that all of its probes are complementary to ESTs in NHP.

based on the GeneChip® annotation file provided by
Affymetrix Website [18]. While a UniGene cluster does
not necessarily correspond to a unique gene, it is a reasonable way to assess probeset redundancy. As shown in
Table 1, the Focus GeneChip® and the U133Plus2.0 GeneChip® have the lowest and highest frequency of redundant
probesets for a given gene, respectively.
The U133Plus2.0 is the most current version of human
GeneChip® from Affymetrix and covers the human
genome most extensively. Figure 2 displays the distribution of probesets on the human chromosomes. The yellow bars represent the distribution of all probesets on the
U133Plus2.0 platform, and the blue and red bars represent the distribution of ISC probesets for monkey and
chimpanzee, respectively. As shown in Figure 2, ISC
probesets for both monkey and chimpanzee are distributed throughout the genome, from chromosome 1 to
chromosome 22, including the two sex chromosomes X
and Y. The percentage of ISC probesets on each chromosome is roughly proportional to that of the total
probesets.
Intra- and interspecies reproducibility of detection calls
The qualitative detection call (present / absent) output
from MAS5.0 was the initial approach used to examine
the reproducibility of GeneChip® data observed in intraand
interspecies
samples.
The
intra-species
reproducibility is displayed in Figure 3A and 3B for
human samples and monkey samples, respectively. As
shown in Figure 3A, 66% of probesets showed 100%
reproducibility across 12 human replicates, being either
present in all samples (24%) or absent in all samples
(42%). Similarly, among 8 monkey samples, 69% of
probesets showed 100% reproducibility, being either
present in all samples (12%) or absent in all samples
(57%) (Figure 3B). Although the percentage of absent
calls in monkey samples (57%) is higher than those in
human samples (42%), the detection call itself is consistent across replicates. In other words, an absent call caused
by sequence divergence will be reliably repeated across
monkey samples. This result suggests that it is feasible to
use the human GeneChip® for NHP intra-species studies.

In contrast, if human GeneChip® platforms are used to
compare the expression pattern of humans with those of
NHPs, care must be taken in the interpretation of data. If
we consider a probeset as being expressed when 50% or
more of replicates have present calls, then 3445
(2059+1386) and 2321 (2059+262) probesets are
expressed in the PBMC fraction of humans and monkeys,
respectively (Figure 4A). Approximately 40% (1386/
3445) of probesets being detected in human PBMCs are
not detected in the monkey. Due to the close evolutionary
relationship between human and monkey, one would not

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/165

expect that 40% of genes expressed in human PBMCs are
not expressed in monkey PBMCs. This observation suggests that a subset of human probesets failed to properly
hybridize with the orthologs of monkey. Based on
expression data alone, however, it is difficult to distinguish a genuine absent call from a spurious absent call
resulting from sequence divergence. ISC probesets can
help to distinguish spurious from genuine absent calls. As
shown in Figure 4B, of 868 ISC probesets that were
detected in human PBMCs, only 216 (24.9%) are not
detected in monkey PBMCs. The interspecies discordance
is reduced significantly for ISC probesets (Fisher's exact
test p < 2.2e-16). It is important to point out that ISC
probesets will significantly reduce, but not eliminate
interspecies discordance as it requires only a minimum of
two complementary probes. It can be postulated that a
perfect probeset in which all of its probes were complementary to ESTs of NHP would provide the ultimate
reduction in discordance. However, the identification of
such probesets is limited by currently available sequence
information.
Intra- and interspecies reproducibility of signal intensities
To assess the intra- and interspecies reproducibility of
GeneChip® signal intensities, a matrix that contains signal
intensities of 3445 expressed probesets across 20 samples
(12 human and 8 monkeys) was created. Probesets that
are not expressed in human PBMCs were excluded in this
analysis. Pair-wise correlation coefficients were calculated
for all 20 samples (20C2 = 190 combinations in total). The
correlation coefficients were visualized using heat spectrum graphs where colors ranging from red to white correspond to correlation coefficients of 0.5 to 1.0,
respectively. In figure 5A, the cells in the diagonal line are
all white as they represent samples correlating with themselves with a correlation coefficient of 1.0. The highest
correlations were found among human replicates (lower
left corner), followed by monkey replicates (upper right
corner). The lowest correlations were found in interspecies comparisons (bottom right corner). The means and
standard deviations of human-human, monkey-monkey
and human-monkey correlation coefficients are 0.92 ±
0.013, 0.85 ± 0.039 and 0.65 ± 0.044, respectively. If the
low correlation coefficients of human-monkey are caused
by unsuitable probesets, then ISC probesets should have
higher correlation coefficients. Figure 5B displayed the
correlation coefficients of the same 20 samples as Figure
5A, but limited to ISC probesets. As shown in Fig 5B, the
colors are much less red than those in Figure 5A, indicating higher correlation coefficients. The means and standard deviations of correlation coefficients of ISC probesets
for human-human, monkey-monkey and human-monkey are 0.95 ± 0.0094, 0.92 ± 0.023 and 0.80 ± 0.026,
respectively. The greatest improvement (0.65 to 0.80) in
correlation coefficients are observed in the human-mon-

key comparison (Figure 5A and 5B) using the ISC
probesets. This data suggests that a subset of problematic
probesets interfered with interspecies comparison, and
the ISC probesets could be used to improved interspecies
reproducibility.
The effect of normalization methods on interspecies
reproducibility
Different normalization methods have been shown to significantly affect GeneChip® data variation [14-17]. We
compared three different normalization methods:
MAS5.0, RMA [14-16] and dChip [17], to evaluate the
effect of normalization methods on interspecies reproducibility. Both RMA and dChip methods normalize GeneChip® data at the probe level using a non-linear algorithm

while MAS5.0 normalizes data at probeset level using linear scaling. Sequence divergence usually leads to one or
very few probes in a probeset being problematic while the
majority of probes in that probeset may still work reasonably well. If the variation generated from these problematic probes were normalized, the interspecies
reproducibility should improve. Figure 6 showed the
interspecies correlation coefficients using three different
normalization methods. The average signal intensities of
8 monkey samples were given on the ordinate and that of
12 human samples on the abscissa. The RMA normalization method improved interspecies reproducibility the
most for both expressed probesets and ISC probesets. As
shown in the Figure 6A,6B,6C, correlation coefficients for
expressed probesets using MAS5.0, dChip and RMA were

0.725, 0.821 and 0.893, respectively. Similarly, in Figure
6D,6E,6F, correlation coefficients for ISC probesets using
MAS5.0, dChip and RMA were 0.850, 0.879 and 0.921,
respectively. For the same normalization method, ISC
probesets exhibited higher correlation coefficients than
those of expressed probesets (horizontal comparison such
as Figure 6A vs. Figure 6D). Use of the RMA normalization
method in conjunction with the use of ISC probesets optimized the correlation coefficient between human and
monkey. The resulting correlation coefficient of 0.92 is
equivalent to the human-human correlation using the
MAS5.0 normalization method (Figure 6F and Figure 5A).

Conclusions
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of probe
sequences and GeneChip® expression data as applied to
the derivation of meaningful expression profile data from
NHP. The utility of the human Affymetrix GeneChip® for
the assessment of expression profiles in NHP depends on
the experimental design and on the approach to data normalization and analysis. Our observations suggest that: 1)
it is feasible to use the human GeneChip® in the evaluation of expression profiles of NHP samples for intra-species comparisons; 2) use of ISC probesets and RMA
normalization are recommended for interspecies studies;
and 3) with the increasing amount of ESTs of NHP, additional ISC probesets (and perfect probesets) will be identified in the near future.

Methods
Sequence data source
Affymetrix GeneChip probe sequences were downloaded
from Affymetrix website [18]. The ESTs (Expressed
Sequence Tags) of monkey (Macaca mulatta) and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) were downloaded from NCBI
website [19].
Identification of ISC probesets
Stand alone BALST program was downloaded from NCBI
website [19]. Perl script was written to automatically run
BLAST search between GeneChip® probe sequences and
monkey /chimpanzee EST sequences. The length of a
probe sequence is always 25 nucleotides while the
number of probes in a probeset varies from 11 to 20

depending on GeneChip® platforms (see Table 1). A certain degree of mismatch between a probe sequence and
ESTs is allowed. If a probe has at least 23 nucleotides complementary to at least one EST sequence, this probe is designated as a complementary probe. If a probeset has at
least two complementary probes, we defined this probeset
as an ISC probeset. If all probes of a probeset are complementary probes, this probeset is called a 'perfect' probeset.
The rationale for the definition of ISC probesets is as
follows: 1) since each probe is a 25-mer oligo, the probability of random matching of one probe is 4-25 thus, the
probability of random matching of two probes goes down
to 4-50, being exponentially reduced; 2) in comparison
with an RT-PCR experiment, the primer length is equivalent to our probe length, and two primers (one forward

and one backward) usually generate a unique sequence in
a whole genome; 3) a probe sequence on the Affymetrix
GeneChip® is a well designed sequence with a single probe
hybridizing with a unique transcript in whole transcriptome; and 4) since the EST sequences in NHP are very limited so far, most of them do not cover whole transcript
such that a false negative could be generated if we require
all the probes in a probeset being complementary to
known ESTs. In order to convert probeset IDs to UniGene
IDs and map them onto chromosomes, probeset annota-

tion files were downloaded from Affymetrix website [18].
No animals or human samples were used for the purpose
of this analysis. Affymetrix datasets used in this analysis
are from other approved ongoing projects in our lab. The
procedure used to process these samples was previously
published [1].
Briefly, peripheral blood from healthy human and NHP

Histopaque-Ficoll (Sigma) gradient centrifugation. RNA
preparation, Hybridization, staining and scanning of the
GeneChip® was carried out as described by Vahey et al. [1].
Animal and human samples were handled identically
throughout the process. All 20 samples (12 human and 8
rhesus macaques) were hybridized to Affymetrix's HGFocus GeneChip®. Signal values and detection calls
(present or absent) for all samples were determined by
using MAS5.0 (Affymetrix Inc. Santa Clara, California).
Signal values were scaled to the default target signal intensity of 500). A matrix of detection calls (present, absent
and marginal) and a matrix of signal intensities for all
samples across all probesets were constructed. A gene
must exhibit 50% or more of 'present' calls in all samples
to be considered 'expressed'. In this study, an expressed
probeset in human is a probeset that has 6 or more
present calls among 12 human samples. Similarly, an
expressed probeset in monkey means there were 4 or
more present calls among 8 monkey samples. The signal
intensities output from MAS5.0 were log2 transformed.
Model-based normalization was performed using dChip
version 1.3 [17]. The output signal intensities were log2
transformed. RMA (Robust Multichip Average) normalization [14-16] was carried out using BioConductor package Affy_1.2.30 [20]. The rma() function in the package
was used at its default setting, that is, 'RMA' background
correction, 'quantile normalization', 'PM only model' and
'median polish summarization'. By default, the signal
intensities were already log2 transformed.
Intra- and interspecies correlation coefficients of signal
intensities were calculated by built in function 'cor' in statistical package R version 1.9.0. [21]. Visualization of correlation coefficients matrix was done by the function
'image'. The function 'heat.colors' was used to create heatspectrum (red to white) and set color scales between 0.5
(red) and 1.0 (white).
