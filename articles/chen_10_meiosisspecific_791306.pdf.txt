Abstract
Background: Meiosis is a critical process in the reproduction and life cycle of flowering plants in which
homologous chromosomes pair, synapse, recombine and segregate. Understanding meiosis will not only advance
our knowledge of the mechanisms of genetic recombination, but also has substantial applications in crop
improvement. Despite the tremendous progress in the past decade in other model organisms (e.g., Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster), the global identification of meiotic genes in flowering plants has remained
a challenge due to the lack of efficient methods to collect pure meiocytes for analyzing the temporal and spatial
gene expression patterns during meiosis, and for the sensitive identification and quantitation of novel genes.
Results: A high-throughput approach to identify meiosis-specific genes by combining isolated meiocytes, RNA-Seq,
bioinformatic and statistical analysis pipelines was developed. By analyzing the studied genes that have a meiosis
function, a pipeline for identifying meiosis-specific genes has been defined. More than 1,000 genes that are
specifically or preferentially expressed in meiocytes have been identified as candidate meiosis-specific genes. A
group of 55 genes that have mitochondrial genome origins and a significant number of transposable element (TE)
genes (1,036) were also found to have up-regulated expression levels in meiocytes.
Conclusion: These findings advance our understanding of meiotic genes, gene expression and regulation,
especially the transcript profiles of MGI genes and TE genes, and provide a framework for functional analysis of
genes in meiosis.

Background
Despite more than a century of research, the mechanisms
of meiosis in flowering plants remain largely unknown
with respect to the regulation and progression of homologous chromosome pairing, synapse, recombination, and
segregation [1-3]. Until the late 1990s, yeast was the primary model system for investigating the molecular
mechanisms of meiosis [4], while flowering plants were
only sparingly explored with the exception of cytological
studies [5,6]. In the past decade, however, flowering
plants have become model systems to unravel the principles of meiosis in multicellular organisms [6-8]. Genetic
resources from model plants such as Arabidopsis and

rice have been significantly enhanced since the year 2000
as genome sequences were completed and genome-wide
T-DNA insertion mutants became available [9-12].
Compared to the functional genomic studies on pollen/
gametophyte, in which significant progress has been made
[13-15], using flowering plants to study meiosis has some
inherent methodological challenges, especially the relatively small physical size of anthers that undergo meiosis
in plants, and the small size is particularly the case in Arabidopsis [5]. Although the male meiocytes (pollen mother
cells) are highly synchronized in anther lobes, each anther
contains only a small fraction of male meiocytes. For
instance, male meiocytes constitute about 1% of Arabidopsis anther tissues, making the isolation of meiocytes challenging (Figure 1B). To date, several methods have been
developed to concentrate meiocytes for transcriptome or
proteome profiling. One approach was developed for collecting meiocytes from Brassica that have larger anthers
[5]. Subsequent meiotic proteomics analysis, however,

could not directly characterize gene functions in meiosis
due to the limited genetic resources in Brassica, i.e., a
characterized mutant collection, although a number of
genes with potential functions in meiosis were identified
[5]. Other researchers have collected anthers that are
undergoing meiosis in several species, such as Arabidopsis
[16], rice [17,18], maize [19] and wheat [20] for transcriptomic studies, since anthers are much easier to obtain
compared to meiocytes. As mentioned above, this
approach is inefficient for the exploration of meiosis, as
only a small portion of cells in anthers are meiocytes (Figure 1B). Genes identified through this approach also
included genes that are specific for anther wall development (Figure 1B) [16].
We hypothesize that the meiosis-specific genes can be
identified by comparing transcriptome profiles of meiocytes and anthers with seedling controls. A number of
techniques are available for sampling specific plant cells,
including fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) [21]
and laser capture microdissection (LCM) [22,23]. LCM
has been successfully applied in specific plant cell sampling and transcriptome analyses [24-28], such as transcriptional profiling during Arabidopsis embryogenesis
[29,30]. Although FACS and LCM have been very useful
in many areas of plant transcriptome analyses, the
potential biases, such as the enzyme digestion in FACS
and mRNA amplification in LCM make these methods

less appealing to researchers who perform transcriptome
profiling of key biological processes such as meiosis
[22]. The lack of efficient methods to isolate meiocytes
largely accounts for the lack of progress in global identifications of plant meiotic genes. At present, only 68
meiotic genes have been identified in Arabidopsis, largely through mutagenesis and phylogenetic experiments
[6-8,31] (Additional file 1, Table S1). By way of comparison, 915 core-meiotic genes have been found in yeast
through microarray analysis, and more than 300 have
been studied at the molecular level [4].
In this paper, we describe the application of a newly
developed method to effectively collect male meiocytes,
which enables the collection of sufficient total RNA for
transcriptome studies from highly condensed meiocytes
without mRNA amplification. From the total RNA
collected using this method, we have applied RNA-Seq
technology and bioinformatic analysis to identify meiosis-specific genes in Arabidopsis. As a result, 55 genes on
pericentromeric region of chromosome II that covers a
large mitochondrial genomic insertion (MGI) and 1,036
transposable element (TE) genes were discovered to be
preferentially or specifically expressed in meiocytes.

Results
Transcriptome sequencing

The sequencing of meiocyte, anther and seedling transcriptomes generated average genome and transcriptome
coverage over 10×. Technical replicates were highly
reproducible (Additional file 2, Figure S1 and Additional
file 3, Figure S2). The percentage of reads aligned to the
genome was an average of 79%, 75% and 81% for meiocyte, anther and seedling libraries, respectively. The percentage of reads aligned is a function both of the quality
of the libraries and the relative completeness of the Arabidopsis genome. Through the comparative analysis of
sequencing datasets against the TAIR 9 reference data,
at the cutoff point of five reads per million reads, a total
of 13,723 genes were expressed in meiocytes, with
15,368 and 16,174 genes detected in seedling and anther
controls, respectively (Figure 2A). At a cutoff of one
read per million reads, however, 23,843, 19,930, and
21,473 genes were expressed in meiocytes, seedlings and
anthers, respectively. Together, the results suggest a significantly large population of genes are expressed in
meiocytes at low levels.
Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed groups of functionally-related, annotated genes expressed in meiocytes (Figure S3). A comparative GO analysis among
previously annotated nuclear genes that were detected
in meiocytes, anthers and seedlings revealed distinct
gene expression profiles among the different tissues.
Notably, by cellular components, a significantly
increased number of functionally unknown cellular

component genes were expressed in meiocytes, while
an increased percentage of other cytoplasmic component genes were expressed in anthers and chloroplast
genes in seedlings (Figure 2C). In addition, when genes
expressed in meiocytes were partitioned by biological
process, a smaller number of genes function in DNA
or RNA metabolism, and a larger number of signal
transduction genes were observed, which suggested a
lower level of DNA or RNA metabolic activity and a
higher level of signal transduction occurs in meiosis
(Figure 2B). By molecular function, meiocytes demonstrated significantly higher activities of nucleotide

binding and lower levels of kinase activities when compared to anthers and seedlings (Figure 2D).
Statistical analysis

ANOVA analysis of all pair-wise differences between
seedling (S), anther control (A) and anther meiocytes
(M) was determined as described in the Materials and
Methods. A total of 16,088 differences were noted in
the three comparisons (S vs A = 12,871, S vs M =
13,385, A vs M = 10,157). The heat map analysis suggested a number of the changes were unique to anthers
or meiocytes (Figure 3). Because of the high similarity in

Chen et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:280
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/280

technical replicates (Additional file 2, Figure S1, and
Additional file 3, Figure S2), a second filter of at least a
twofold or greater expression difference in the pair-wise
comparisons was performed to reduce the total number
of significant changes. This reduced the total number of
significantly expressed genes to 12,484 (Figure 4; S vs A
= 8,850, S vs M = 9,723, A vs M = 5,216). To find
unique meiosis genes that were only differentially
expressed within meiocytes compared to anthers, we
performed Venn Diagrams (Figure 4) of the significantly
expressed genes after ANOVA and the twofold filter.
There were 696 genes that were uniquely expressed in a
comparison of meiocytes anthers, among which 607
genes were preferentially expressed in meiocytes.
Transcript profiling of studied meiotic genes

In Arabidopsis, a total of 68 genes have been reported to
date with functions in meiosis (Additional file 1, Table
S1). Among them, MS5, AtSRP2, and AtSRP3 were not
detected in seedlings [32,33]; and MND1, AtSPO11-2,
AtSRP2 and MS5 were expressed at twofold or greater
levels in meiocytes than anthers. However, the expression levels of AtSRP2 and MND1 were very low in
meiocytes, at 0.7 reads per million reads [31-38]. 31
genes were expressed at twofold or greater in meiocytes
than in seedlings and 49 genes were expressed at twofold or greater in anthers than in seedlings. 29 of 68
genes were preferentially expressed in both meiocytes
and anthers compared to seedlings, which include key
meiotic recombination genes, such as AtSPO11-1,
AtDMC1, AtRAD51C, AtXRCC3, AtMSH4, AtMSH5,
AtMER3/RCK, PTD, AtMUS81, and SDS [39-55].
17 genes didn’t show significantly differential expression
in all explored tissues, which included genes that were
not meiosis-specific, or may function in both meiosis and
mitosis, i.e. AML2, AML3, AML5, ASK2, ATK5 [56-58].
Mitochondrial genomic insertion genes on chromosome II
are preferentially expressed in meiocytes

A large genomic block on chromosome II pericentromeric region was found to have genes expressed preferentially in meiocytes. The genomic block included a
~270 KB region that was reported to be of mitochondrial genome origin [59,60], which was believed to be
approximately 620 KB with repeated mitochondrial
genomic fragments and an unsequenced gap [61]. In our
analysis, 152 genes were found in the region spanning
from At2G07650 to At2G08986 (chromosome positions
3222935-3626460) (Figure 5). With the cutoff of one
read per million reads in meiocytes, 100 genes on this
block were preferentially or specifically expressed in
meiocytes versus anthers. Among the 100 genes, 45
genes were considered to be only expressed in meiocytes
with less than one read per million reads in anthers, and

Page 4 of 13

55 genes were preferentially expressed in meiocytes,
including 40 genes that were expressed at fourfold or
greater in meiocytes than in anthers (Figure 5B and
Additional file 4, Table S2).
Transposable element genes expressed in meiocytes

Transposable elements (TEs) are a ubiquitous feature of
plant genomes. At a cutoff of one read per million
reads, 1,271, 138, 379 TE genes were expressed in meiocytes, seedlings and anthers, respectively. In this study, a
total of 1,117 TE genes demonstrated differential
expression in meiocytes and anthers with at least a twofold difference (Additional file 5, Table S3). Among the
1,117 TE genes, 871 genes were only expressed in meiocytes with no reads or less than one read per million
reads in anthers, such as At3G30846, At2G13110; and
only 18 genes were only expressed in anthers. 228 genes
were detected in both meiocytes and anthers with differential expression, including 165 genes that were preferentially expressed in meiocytes versus anthers, i. e.
At2G07080, At5G34851, and 63 genes were preferentially expressed in anthers versus meiocytes, such as
At1G64270, At4G16870 (Additional file 5, Table S3).
Together, there were 1,036 TE genes up-regulated and
81 TE genes down-regulated in meiocytes versus in
anthers. Since the TE genes are enriched in the pericentromeric regions, as shown in Figure 6, the distribution
of differentially expressed TEs in meiocytes versus
anthers is also seen at pericentromeric regions in all 5
chromosomes (Figure 6, Additional file 6, Figure S3 and
Additional file 5, Table S3).
GO analysis has demonstrated that meiocyte preferentially expressed TE genes belong to 10 TE super families
with 3.73% of TEs that are unassigned (Figure 7, Additional file 5, Table S3). 35.94% of differentially expressed
TEs detected in meiocytes are LTR/Gypsy super family
transposons, and 21.47% of belong to the DNA/MuDR
super family. Additional details are also presented
(Figure 7, Additional file 5, Table S3). A tree-map of
functional categories using Agrigo-Revigo toolkit is also
provided (Additional file 7, Figure S4).
A comparative analysis of TE gene expression in meiocytes versus seedlings resulted in a total of 1,223 differentially expressed TE genes (Additional file 8, Table S4).
Among the 1,223 TE genes, 1,148 genes were meiocytespecific with no reads or less than one read per million
reads in seedlings; and only 17 genes that were seedlingspecific. 58 genes were detected in both meiocytes and
seedlings with differential expression, including 27 genes
that were preferentially expressed in meiocytes, and
31 genes were preferentially expressed in seedlings.
Together, there were 1,165 TE genes up-regulated and
48 TE genes down-regulated in meiocytes versus in
seedlings (Additional file 8, Table S4).

Discussion
Refining the criteria for meiotic gene identification by
profiling studied genes that function in meiosis

68 genes in Arabidopsis have been identified and characterized with function in meiosis using forward and reverse
genetic approaches (Additional file 1, Table S1). The 68
known Arabidopsis genes with functions in meiosis can be
assigned to four functional categories: 1) genes which
function in homologous chromosome pairing and recombination (e.g., AtSPO11-1, AtDMC1, AtRAD51, AtRAD51c,
AtXRCC3, AtMSH4, AtMER3/RCK) [40,45,46,55]; 2) genes
that encode structural proteins such as cohesin, histone,
centromere proteins and proteins for synaptonemal complex assembly, e.g., SYN1/DIF1, SMC1, ZYP1, and ASY1
[62-66]; 3) genes which function in chromosome spindle
organization and movement (e.g. ATK1, AESP, ATK5/
AtKin14B, AtPS1) [58,67-70]; and 4) genes which encode
regulatory proteins such as MMD1/DUET, SDS, TAM,

and ASK1 [54,71-74]. By profiling the gene expression of
all 68 genes in meiocytes and control tissues, meiosis-specific candidate genes can be efficiently identified by following the two criteria: 1) genes are expressed at twofold or
greater in meiocytes versus anthers; and/or 2) genes are
expressed at twofold or greater in both meiocytes and
anthers versus seedlings with the exclusion of genes that
are expressed at fourfold or greater in anthers versus
meiocytes.
Three genes, MND1, AtSRP2, AtSRP3, were expressed
at very low levels and only had 0.7 read per million
reads in meiocytes, which suggests more sequence data
or a lower cutoff point is needed in order to cover all
important meiosis-specific genes for these datasets
[33,35,36]. Only 4 genes (AtSPO11-2, MS5, MND1 and
AtSRP2) [32,33,36,75] meet the first criterion with preferential expression in meiocytes, and 29 genes were
expressed twofold or greater in both meiocytes and
anthers comparing to seedlings, which include key meiotic recombination genes, such as AtSPO11-1, AtDMC1,
ASY1, AtMLH3, AtRAD51C, AtXRCC3, AtMSH4,
AtMSH5, AtMER3/RCK, PTD, AtMUS81, and SDS
[49,76-78] (Additional file 1, Table S1). Genes that do
not meet the two criteria are unlikely to be meiosis-specific; for example, ATK5/KIN14B may also have important roles in mitotic cell division [58,68]. AtRAD51 has a
meiosis-specific function in Arabidopsis, but it is

expressed in both meiocytes and non-meiotic somatic
cells [41], which is consistent to the RAD51 gene
expression in other organisms, such as mice B cells [79].
Most of the meiosis-specific genes, especially for those
in the meiotic recombination pathways could be identified by comparative analysis of transcriptome profiles of
meiocytes, anthers and seedlings [6-8,55] (Additional file
1, Table S1).
A visual representation of all statistically different
genes from the ANOVA is presented as in the Ward
Hierarchical Clustering, which suggests a number of
genes that are uniquely expressed in the anther as well
as the meiocyte that may be unique candidate genes for
control of expression (Figure 3). As shown in Figure 4,
with a cutoff point of 5 reads per million reads in at
least one sample, more than 1,000 candidate meiosisspecific genes were identified through this approach
with an additional 607 genes that are preferentially
expressed in meiocytes (Figure 4).

The main purpose of profiling concentrated meiocytes
is to eliminate genes that are expressed and function in
anther wall development, which is critical, because those
genes would be included in the candidate gene pools for
entire anther development if transcriptomic analysis is
performed using anther materials [5]. A criterion we suggest for meiotic gene identification is to exclude genes
that are expressed at fourfold or greater in anthers versus
meiocytes, although the gene expression level may be upregulated in both meiocytes and anthers versus seedlings.
For example, DYT1 was found in a gene pool by profiling
anther transcriptome compared to other organs, and
functions in regulating anther wall development [16,80].
Here we show that DYT1 was read at 7.8, 89.3, 0.0 reads
per million reads in meiocytes, anthers, and seedlings,
respectively. The differential expression indicates that
DYT1 is specifically expressed in anthers/meiocytes with
a significantly preferential expression in anthers, which is
consistent to its function in anther wall development
[80]. Another example is the ATA1 gene that was
reported to be highly expressed in tapetum [81], and the
RNA-Seq results read at 33.4, 564.6, 0.0 reads per million
reads in meiocytes, anthers and seedlings, respectively.
Both DYT1 and ATA1 were preferentially expressed in
anthers versus meiocytes, which implies the feasibility of
excluding the anther wall genes by comparative analysis
of transcriptome profiling of meiocytes, anthers and
seedlings. As indicated in criterion 2 for meiosis-specific
gene identification, genes that are expressed at fourfold
or greater in anthers versus meiosis should be considered
as non-meiosis-specific candidate genes, or candidate
genes for anther wall development.
Although this study has not included a parallel transcriptome study of microspore/gametophyte, the life
after meiosis, a comparison of meiocytes (transition
from diploid sporophyte to haploid gametophyte) should
advance our understanding of the molecular connections between the two key processes of reproduction
development, as well as promoting the means of identification of meiosis-specific genes. Previously, pollen
transcriptome profiling using microarrays have found
7,235 genes expressed in Arabidopsis Landsberg erecta
with 387 pollen-specific [14] and 6,587 expressed in
Arabidopsis Col-0 ecotype[13]. Since the meiocytes we
collected included tetrads, there is likely to be a significant overlap between meiocytes and microspores. A
further deep transcriptome sequencing using staged
meiosis-I meiocytes is currently being performed.

NADH-ubiquinone proteins (5%), which suggest this
group of genes may function in meiosis (Figure 5C).
A preliminary investigation on the T-DNA insertion lines
targeted on MGI genes confirmed that some mutants on
the MGI block have meiotic phenotypes (Chen, et al.,
unpublished results), which further suggest the functions
of MGI in meiosis in the Col-0 ecotype of Arabidopsis.

short arm adjacent to the centromere and was annotated
as a putative mitochondrial genome insertion (MGI)[59].
This annotation was adopted by TAIR [http://www.Arabidopsis.org] and Salk T-DNA Express: the Arabidopsis
Gene Mapping Tool (http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/
tdnaexpress). Fiber FISH analysis uncovered the structure
of the MGI in Col-0 ecotype as an approximately 620 kb
mitochondrial genomic insertion with several duplicated
segments and events [61]. Thirty-two orphan RNAs were
found on this region [82]. Since this region is in the
genetic centromere region and thought to be of mitochondrial origin, the function and transcript profile of
this genomic block remains unknown. Our data showed
that all 55 genes detected in both meiocytes and anthers
were preferentially expressed in meiocytes, in which 40
genes were expressed at fourfold or greater in meiocytes
versus anthers. (Figure 5B). 39% of the 55 genes encode
unknown proteins, 17% for pre-tRNAs, others are ribosomal proteins (11%), cytochrome proteins (11%), transposable elements (7%), transporter proteins (5%) and

While transposable elements (TEs) make up to 14% of Arabidopsis genome [83], the majority of TEs were silenced
during plant development since there were a lack of
mRNAs, but higher levels of small RNAs were detected
[84]. TEs’ activities were usually limited in just one or a few
of developmental stages, in which TEs were expressed [84].
In comparing the transcriptomes of anther and meiocytes,
we observed a large set of TEs that were expressed preferentially or specifically in meiocytes versus anthers. At a cutoff point of one read per million reads, a total of 1,271 TE
genes were expressed in meiocytes, which is about 32.5% of
3,907 TE genes reported or annotated in Arabidopsis [84]
[http://www.arabidopsis.org]. Relatively smaller numbers of
TE genes were expressed in controls: 379 and 138 in
anthers and seedlings, respectively. With 1,036 TE genes
up-regulated and 81 TE genes down-regulated in meiocytes
compared to anthers, TE genes may play unique roles in
meiosis. In addition, 1,165 TE genes were up-regulated and
48 TE genes down-regulated in meiocytes as compared to
seedlings, which are consistent with the comparison
between meiocytes and anthers, and demonstrated more
significant deviation between meiocytes and seedlings
(Additional file 5, Table S3, and Additional file 8, Table S4).
The abundant TE expression in meiocytes suggests substantial activities of TEs in meiosis. It is believed that TEs
affect recombination in all meiotic eukaryotes [85]. Recent
studies on postmeiotic gametophyte development have
found that TE genes are unexpectedly reactivated and

Chen et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:280
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/280

transpose only in the vegetative nucleus, but not in the
sperm cells of pollen [86], which suggest that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from TEs activated in the vegetative
nucleus can target silencing those in gametes [86]. In addition, small RNA pathways have been found to be present
and functional in the angiosperm male gametophytes [87].
During female gamete formation, AGO9 was found to preferentially interact with siRNAs derived from TEs and the
activity of AGO9 is required to silence TEs in female
gametes and their accessory cells [88]. The AGO9 gene
(At5G21150) was preferentially expressed in anthers versus meiocytes (M/A = 78.24/172.37) in this study, which is
consistent with the discovery of a postmeiotic function. In
contrast, the two AGO genes, At1G31290 (AGO3) and
At5G21030 (AGO8) were preferentially or specifically
expressed in meiocytes (At1G31290: M/A = 11.54/3.30;
At5G21030: M/A = 3.03/0.71), which suggest that molecules regulating gene silencing and DNA modification in
meiosis differ from those of postmeiotic gametophyte
development, both in the male and the female. In the postmeiotic gametes, the gene expression map has demonstrated the similarities between plants and animals [89],
which may also be true in meiosis. To date, it still remains
largely unknown how TEs function in meiosis. It is possible that a large number of TEs are activated in meiosis
and then silenced after meiosis through siRNA machinery
and/or modification of heterochromatin.

Co., Tokyo, Japan). Inflorescence and anther photos
were taken using a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic
instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI, USA). Meiocytes
were collected using a modified inverted microscope
(see below). For photographs, one hour collections were
briefly centrifuged at 1,000 g for 30 second and resuspended in 5 μl 0.1% Toluidine Blue O in PBS buffer
(pH = 7.0). Anther thin sections were prepared as previously described [90].
Male meiocyte collection, and anther and seedling
preparation

Conclusion
A high-throughput approach to identify meiosis-specific
genes by comparative profiles of meiocyte, anther and
seedling transcriptomes using RNA-Seq, bioinformatic
and statistical analysis pipelines was established. Two criteria for meiosis-specific gene identification were defined.
Using this method, thousands of genes that are preferentially expressed in anthers would be excluded from a
meiosis-specific candidate gene pool; a MGI block was
found to be specifically expressed during meiosis; and
1,036 transposable element genes were also preferentially
expressed in meiocytes with potential functions in meiosis.
These findings provide a framework for future functional
analysis of genes in meiosis and advance our understanding of meiotic genes, gene expression and regulation.

A manual Arabidopsis meiocyte collection method, the
Capillary Collection of Meiocytes (CCM) was designed
for efficient meiocyte sampling. Briefly, anthers undergoing meiosis were collected (Figure 1A) then squashed
using a sharp clean forceps to release meiocytes. Capillary glass pipettes were used to collect meiocytes under
an inverted microscope (Figure 1C). In this study, meiocytes cover all stages of meiosis, from leptotene to tetrad, were collected, although the CCM allows collecting
of staged meiotic cells, especially meiosis I-meiocytes.
Meiocytes were transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing 500 μl of RNAlater (Ambion #7020), and were
kept at 4°C for up to one month for multiple collections
to achieve the desired cell number. Before extracting
RNA, meiocytes were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 minutes. The cell pellets were either frozen at -80°C or used
to extract RNA directly. One week (~25 hours) of collection resulted in approximately 28,000 cells with a
purity of 98% meiocytes, which were used to extract
total RNA for building the sequencing library.
For controls, 600 of stage 5-7 anthers were directly
dissected and collected from stage 9 flower buds and
stored in RNAlater for up to 4 weeks before RNA
extraction. For collecting seedling samples, the Arabidopsis Col-0 seeds were sowed in soil mix directly and
transferred to a growth chamber for 2 weeks. 10 seedlings were then carefully harvested and soil removed
using running water. Whole seedlings including shoots,
leaves and roots were then put on paper towel for a
few seconds to remove extra water and stored in
RNAlater.

Methods

RNA extraction and measurement

Plant and growth conditions

Total RNA from meiocytes, anthers and seedlings were
extracted using the Ambion RNAqueous®-Micro kit
(Ambion, #AM1931) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The total RNA yields were measured using
Invitrogen® Qubit™ fluorometer and Agilent Bioanalyzer
2100 microfluidics (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). 8.04 μg of
total RNA resulted from the 28,000 meiocyte collection.
5.15 μg and 4.80 μg of total RNA were extracted from
anther and seedling controls, respectively.

The Col-0 ecotype of wild-type Arabidopsis used in this
study was grown in plant growth chambers at 22°C/20°
C (day/night), in 65% humidity with a photoperiod of
16/8 (day/night).
Microscopy

Inflorescences and young flower buds were dissected
using an Olympus SZ40 stereo microscope (Olympus

Sequencing library preparation

Poly-A containing RNA was isolated from total RNA
using oligo-dT25 magnetic beads (Dynabeads; Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). After chemically reversing the Dynabead
binding, the RNA was denatured and used as template
for random-primed cDNA synthesis. The resulting
cDNA was end-repaired by incubation in the presence
of T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow polymerase and dNTPs.
The polished fragments were phosphorylated by T4
polynucleotide kinase, followed by the addition of a single “A” base to the 3’-end of the blunt-ended phosphorylated DNA fragments. The fragments were then
ligated to an Illumina adapter oligo which has an overhanging 3’-T. Ligation products were size-selected by
electrophoresis for 1-2 hours at 80-110 V in low T m
agarose containing ethidium bromide with size markers.
The gel was visualized with a brief UV exposure, and
the desired size range (300-500 bp) was excised. Purified
DNA libraries were amplified by PCR for 15 cycles.
Libraries were qualitatively and quantitatively assessed
by Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham,
MA) UV/Vis spectroscopy and DNA BioAnalyzer 2100
microfluidics (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).
Transcriptome sequencing

Two picomoles per channel of the size-selected meiocyte cDNA library was loaded onto an Illumina singleend flow cell using the Illumina Cluster Station (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). Anther and seedling libraries
were sequenced as parallel controls. 36 bp reads were
collected on an Illumina Genome Analyzer using
sequencing-by-synthesis technology [91,92]. Image data
acquired from the sequencing run was base-called and
quality analyzed with the Illumina Genome Analysis
Pipeline software package. Technical replicates were
performed on different days and instruments. Approximately 21, 17 and 13 million reads were collected from
meiocyte, anther and seedling libraries, respectively,
with an average Illumina quality score of 31.
Data analysis and de novo assembly of transcriptome

Reads were aligned to the TAIR Release 9 of the Arabidopsis genome and its associated annotations and gene
calls using GSNAP [93], the follow-on program to GMAP
[94]. This program aligns short read data to the reference
genomes and transcriptomes, with accommodation for
sequencing errors, indels and alternative splicing. The
alignment was managed through a pipeline associated
with the Alpheus data management software [95], and
loaded into the Alpheus-associated database for further
analysis. The gene expression functionality in Alpheus was
used to provide basic normalization and to return genomically-aligned reads per million per library. Candidate differential gene expression was developed by querying the

Page 9 of 13

database for read counts which were different in bi-directional comparisons between each of the tissue pairs.
In addition to alignments to the genome, reads were
assembled de novo using a hybrid assembly technique.
Reads were preliminarily assembled using ABySS-P
[96,97] and SSAKE [98], and the results of these assemblies merged using PCAP [99] to create the final assembly. ABySS-P uses a parallel implementation of a de
Bruijn graph for assembly; SSAKE uses a stringent prefix
tree. Both robustly handle large numbers of short reads
to give an initial contig assembly. PCAP uses a more
classical overlap-layout-consensus approach to combine
and extend contigs. GO analysis was performed using
TAIR GO tools [http://www.Arabidopsis.org]. The
Agrigo-Revigo toolkit was applied for the classification
and annotation of TEs [100].
Visualization of genomic alignments

In addition to the individual read visualization in the
Alpheus software [95], data was extracted from the
database and loaded into a modified version of the
Comparative Map and Trait Viewer [101]. This visualization software allows the simultaneous viewing of the
genomic tract, a representation of the TAIR annotations
and reads from individual libraries and technical
replicates.
Statistical analysis of sequence-based differential
expression

Illumina GA reads that aligned to the genomic Arabidopsis TAIR9 database were normalized by total reads
per million, and analysis was limited to one or more
total reads per million in at least one of the five samples. Technical replicates were performed on anther
and meiocytes. To provide a technical replicate for the
seedling controls, the seedling reads were split into
two unique columns based from the position of the
polony (each lane on the flow cell contains two columns that are imaged - the columns were split into
two separate columns and were individually normalized by total reads per million). All six samples were
then log2+1 transformed. Statistical analysis was performed as previously described [102]. Briefly, normal
distribution was determined by overlaid kernel density
estimates, univariate distribution results, Mahalanobis
distances, correlation coefficients of pairwise sample
comparisons, unsupervised principal component analysis (by Pearson product-moment correlation) and
Ward hierarchical clustering of Pearson productmoment correlations of read frequencies were performed with JMP Genomics, Version 4.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Analysis of variance against all
pairwise sample comparisons was performed with a 5%
false discovery rate (FDR).

Meiotic gene identification and functional analysis

By comparing the sequencing datasets from three tissues, genes which were differentially expressed in the
different organs suggest a potentially tissue-specific
function. Genes that were expressed only in meiocytes
or at twofold or greater in meiocytes versus anthers
were considered as candidates for meiosis-specific genes.
In addition, we identified novel candidate genes or
exons by comparing the alignment of the Arabidopsis
transcriptome and gene predictions to those reads
which aligned to unannotated regions of the genome.
