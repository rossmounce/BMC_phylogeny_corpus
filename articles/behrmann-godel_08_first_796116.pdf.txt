Abstract
Background: The evolution of reproductive traits, such as hybrid incompatibility (postzygotic
isolation) and species recognition (prezygotic isolation), have shown their key role in speciation.
Theoretical modeling has recently predicted that close linkage between genes controlling pre- and
postzygotic reproductive isolation could accelerate the conditions for speciation. Postzygotic
isolation could develop during the sympatric speciation process contributing to the divergence of
populations. Using hybrid fitness as a measure of postzygotic reproductive isolation, we empirically
studied population divergence in perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) from two genetically divergent
populations within a lake.
Results: During spawning time of perch we artificially created parental offspring and F1 hybrids of
the two populations and studied fertilization rate and hatching success under laboratory conditions.
The combined fitness measure (product of fertilization rate and hatching success) of F1 hybrids was
significantly reduced compared to offspring from within population crosses.
Conclusion: Our results suggest intrinsic genetic incompatibility between the two populations and
indicate that population divergence between two populations of perch inhabiting the same lake may
indeed be promoted by postzygotic isolation.

Background
One of the central issues of evolutionary debate is whether
or not reproductive isolation, which is a prerequisite for
any speciation process, can evolve in the absence of physical barriers to gene flow [1-4]. Many theoretical models
predict that speciation occurs under sympatric and parapatric conditions [2,5]. The most common models that try
to explain sympatric speciation are either based on habitat-race formation, driven by habitat specific deleterious
or beneficial alleles [1,6], or on sexual selection, based on

assortative mating [7,8]. Disruptive selection among ecotypes followed by assortative mating could result in
reduced gene flow between populations [9-14].
There is empirical evidence for the evolution of reproductive isolation under sympatric conditions [3,15-19], however, sympatric speciation remains difficult to prove
because reproductive isolation could as well have originated during an allopatric period, followed by secondary
contact and introgression ([20], but see [19] and citations

herein). To investigate mechanisms of premating isolation under sympatric conditions, Servedio [21] modeled
increased linkage between genes controlling traits associated with mate recognition and genes controlling hybrid
incompatibilities. She demonstrated that hybrid incompatibilities may develop under circumstances of increased
linkage despite some gene flow and state that "postzygotic
isolation may build up during the sympatric speciation
process, accelerating and easing the conditions for speciation to proceed".
Rice and Hostert [22] showed that hybrids of two ecotypes
can suffer reduced fitness, both because they may fall
between distinct ecological niches of their parental populations and be selected against (extrinsic postzygotic isolation), and/or because of genetic incompatibilities
between the parental populations (intrinsic postzygotic
isolation). Negative epistatic effects have been shown to
reduce hybrid fitness if populations that have diverged in
allopatry meet again secondarily [23-25]. This could be
explained by the Dobzhansky-Muller model [26,27]. In
the Dobzhansky-Muller model, hybrid sterility and inviability develop as pleiotropic byproducts during independent allopatric divergence of populations. Thereby
substitutions, which have accumulated during allopatry
and are neutral or beneficial in the genetic background of
one population or species, are deleterious in hybrids
when the species meet secondarily.

Schluter [28], Hatfield and Schluter [29] and Rundle [30]
tested whether extrinsic and/or intrinsic postzygotic isolation played a role in stickleback speciation. They showed
that F1 hybrids and backcrosses of sympatric populations
of sticklebacks, a benthic and a limnetic form, had lower
growth rates in both parental habitats. These results were
regarded as an indication that extrinsic postzygotic isolation can occur. Intrinsic postzygotic isolation was negligible for both populations of sticklebacks.
Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) provide a great opportunity to study postzygotic mechanisms that might promote reproductive isolation and drive population
divergence between populations. Very recently, Bergek
and Björklund [31] have shown that perch populations
within a small lake are genetically differentiated between
areas that may be less than 1000 m apart. The first evidence for similar population subdivision in perch of Lake
Constance was found by analyzing allozyme variation
[32], and differences in parasite infection rates at different
localities around the lake [33]. Motivated by these findings, Gerlach et al. [34] investigated the genetic structure
of perch using microsatellites and found that they are subdivided into two genetically distinct populations (Genetic
index of between population divergence FST = 0.07, [34]).
The populations are geographically stratified within the
lake. One population inhabits the eastern the other the
western part (Fig. 1) while no obvious geographical barrier separates the two [34]. No further genetic sub-struc-

turing or any indication of inbreeding or homing of adults
to spawning sites could be detected within the two populations [34]. The last finding was in contrast to tagging
experiments by Jarv [35] that indicated a homing behavior for Eurasian perch in the coastal waters of western
Estonia.
Lake Constance is a very young prealpine lake, covering an
area of 536 km2 that has formed at the end of the last
Pleistocene glaciations [36]. The earliest colonization by
perch could thus have occurred 15 000 – 10 000 ybp [37].
Perch from the two putative glacial refuges of Lake Constance, the Danube and Rhine rivers, differ in their
mtDNA D-loop sequences [38]. To investigate if genetic
differentiation of perch from Lake Constance was due to
multiple colonization from these two Pleistocene refuges,
Behrmann-Godel et al. [37] sequenced 365 bp of the
5'end of the mtDNA D-loop. Almost exclusively Danube
haplotypes were found within both populations, Rhine
haplotypes also occurred in both populations but in very
low frequencies. However, no significant population substructuring could be observed.
Here we analyze if postzygotic reproductive isolation
occurs between the two perch populations of Lake Constance. We tested F1 hybrid crosses of both populations for
the combined fitness parameters, fertilization rate and
hatching success, to investigate whether intrinsic postzygotic isolation could contribute to divergence between
these perch populations.

crosses, hybrid crosses had a significantly lower CFM (Fig.
2, linear contrast analysis, F1,23 = 10.28, P = 0.004).
Fertilization success of eggs differed within our four experimental groups (Table 1, ANOVA on arcsine square root
of proportions, F3,23 = 4.86, P = 0.009). F12 hybrids had a
significantly lower egg fertilization rate as compared to all
other crosses (eastern pop, 95%; western pop, 99%, F11,
99%, F12, 56%; linear contrast analysis, F1,23 = 14.29, P =
0.001). The hatching success did not differ significantly
between crosses (Table 1, ANOVA on arcsine square root
of proportions, F3,23 = 2.14, P = 0.122).
Six out of nine F12 hybrid crosses were conducted under
laboratory conditions. This method may have resulted in
reduced hybrid fitness of these particular crosses. However, a statistical analysis excluding these crosses did not
alter our results. The CFM between crosses were still significantly different (ANOVA on arcsine square root of proportions, F3,17 = 3.60, P = 0.035) and hybrids still had a
significantly lower CFM than parental crosses (linear contrast analysis, F1,17 = 7.13, P = 0.016 whereas there was no
significant difference in the CFM, neither between the two
parental crosses (linear contrast analysis, F1,17 = 2.82, P =
0.11) nor between the two hybrid crosses (linear contrast
analysis, F1,17 = 0.12, P = 0.74).

Discussion
Our results show reduced hybrid fitness in crosses of two
genetically divergent populations of perch in Lake Constance which only differ by a mean FST value of 0.07

Results
The combined fitness measure (CFM) differed significantly between crosses (Table 1, ANOVA on arcsine
square root of proportions, F3,23 = 5.30, P = 0.006). It was
higher in the parental populations (eastern pop, 63%;
western pop, 82%) and lower in the hybrid crosses (F11,
51%, F12, 34%). There was no significant difference in the
CFM, neither between the two parental crosses (linear
contrast analysis, F1,23 = 1.79, P = 0.193) nor between the
two hybrid crosses (linear contrast analysis, F1,23 = 2.27, P
= 0.146). We therefore pooled the data for the two hybrid
and the two parental crosses. Compared to the parental

Both types of hybrid crosses had significantly lower CFM
values than the within population crosses indicating
intrinsic postzygotic isolation. This could be based on an
acceleration of Dobzhansky- Muller's rate of incompatibilities [26,27] by divergent selection which is generally
believed to be the basis of most intrinsic genetic incompatibilities [39-41].
The comparison of fertilization and hatching success
between parental and hybrid crosses (Table 1) indicated
an asymmetric crossing barrier, which can occur, if the viability of hybrids differ depending on which species is the

maternal parent [42]. Compared to parental populations,
perch F12 hybrid crosses (female western population/
male eastern population) showed significantly reduced
fertilization success; while F11 hybrid crosses (female eastern population/male western population) did not. Such
an unidirectional cross-fertilization has already been
observed in numerous species, e.g. in fish [42,43], in sea
urchins [44-46] in Drosophila [47] and in many plant taxa
[48]. Additionally, we found a trend towards reduced
hatching success of hybrids, indicating additional postzygotic postmating isolation [43]. The decreased hatching
success was based on the high mortality rate during
embryonic development of hybrid crosses (Fig. 3). Many
deformed embryos that died before hatching, were
observed in the F11 hybrid cross and at a much lower frequency also in other crosses. Our results indicate that
hybridization between eastern and western perch populations in Lake Constance could indeed result in a certain
amount of incompatible genotypes in hybrid offspring,
contributing to the disruptive divergence of populations
[49].
The slight differences (approx. one to two weeks) in the
peak spawning times of the two populations could have
resulted in crossing early and late breeders in the hybrid
but not in the parental crosses. Early and late breeders
within populations may be adapted to specific seasonal
conditions and their hybrids may therefore exhibit outbreeding depression [50]. However, we do not think that
this explains the differences found in CFM values. In our

hybrid crosses, all females were caught during peak
spawning of their respective population (see methods section). The reproductive period of male perch exceed that
of females. Males of both populations held in captivity
stay ripe and running and can inseminate eggs from multiple females over a time period of two weeks before and
after the main peak spawning time (Behrmann-Godel,
personal observation). Therefore, reduced CFM values of
hybrid crosses could not have been caused by not yet ripe
or already depleted males.
Since we have no further data to clarify whether the
observed reduced hybrid fitness evolved in sympatry, parapatry or allopatry, we suggest that the two populations of
perch may have diverged during or at the end of the last
ice age, which can be dated to 115 000 to 10 000 ybp [37].
This seems a surprisingly short time span for genetic
incompatibilities to evolve. Russell [51] and Bolnick and
Near [42] have shown that hybrid viability declined with
the time separating pairs of different fish species. Based on
a Centrarchid phylogeny, calculations of Bolnick and
Near [42] revealed that it takes approx. 5–10 my before
the hatching compatibility of interspecific crosses starts to
decrease. Similar results have been found for species pairs
of darters (Percidae: Etheostoma) [43] and also for bird
species [52], but Price and Bouvier [52]could also show
that hybrid infertility arises much earlier (in the order of a
few million years). However, at least for allopatric Drosophila sister species, mathematical modeling shows that
hybrid sterility and inviability evolve fast enough (in the
order of thousands of years, assuming single incompatibility speciation) to contribute to speciation [39].
Our results on reduced hybrid fitness in perch are supported by findings of Lu and Bernatchez [53] and Rogers
and Bernatchez [54] who showed that intrinsic and extrinsic postzygotic reproductive isolation in lake whitefish
(Coregonus culpeaformis) could promote speciation. In
hybrid-parental backcrosses between two allopatric populations of whitefish, Rogers and Bernatchez [54] found
increased embryonic mortality and asynchrony in the
developmental time to emergence of backcrosses. This
indicated both, intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms contributing to the formation and maintenance of reproductive isolation between lake whitefish populations that
have diverged during the last Pleistocene glaciations, 18
000 to 50 0000 ybp, which is a quite comparable time
span to the divergence time we suggested for the two
perch populations of Lake Constance.
Coyne and Orr [55] showed that in Drosophila sister species prezygotic sexual isolation is stronger than postzygotic isolation, and that in sympatric species prezygotic
isolation is greatly enhanced in comparison to allopatric
species. We might expect to find prezygotic isolation

mechanisms prevalent in the perch populations of Lake
Constance as well. The geographical subdivision of the
two populations resulting in slight differences of their
peak spawning times could act to produce the early state
of prezygotic isolation. This could be enhanced by mate
choice decisions, leading to assortative mating [56] and
further be promoted by postzygotic isolation based on
reduced hybrid fitness as shown in this study. We showed
earlier [56] that based on olfactory cues juvenile perch
prefer their own over the other population. This indicates
that a mechanism exists to differentiate between populations that could also be used to avoid mating partners of
the other population. Therefore, prezygotic isolation
mechanism such as population assortative mating may
exist, which could be under positive selection due to
reduced hybrid viability.
Since we used artificial fertilization in our laboratory
experiments, we do not know whether perch will hybridize under natural conditions. So far, we have detected only
slight morphological differences between the two populations (Behrmann-Godel, unpublished). Thus, it is not
possible to identify parental populations and hybrids
based on morphological parameters in order to survey the
lake for the existence of hybrids. Genetic assignment tests
will show, whether hybrids of both populations exist.
Besides indication for intrinsic postzygotic isolation, we
suggest also extrinsic postzygotic isolation corroborating
reproductive isolation of perch populations in Lake Constance. Each population inhabits a lake basin which is
geographically connected to the other but differs in
trophic state, temperature regime, mean water depth, vegetation, proportion of the littoral zone and many more
biotic and abiotic parameters [57]. Each population may
be well adapted to the ecological conditions in their part
of the lake; however, hybrids may experience lower fitness
in either of the two parental habitats.

Conclusion
In conclusion we found reduced fitness in hybrids
between two perch populations inhabiting Lake Constance that may have diverged rather recently, between
115 000 and 10 000 ybp. Our results provide empirical
evidence for the evolution of genetic incompatibilities
between the two populations that might promote reproductive isolation and drive further population divergence.

Methods
Fish sampling and artificial fertilization
Artificial fertilization was used to breed hybrids of the two
perch populations of Lake Constance. In the shallower
Lower Lake (western population), water temperature
increases earlier in spring than in the deeper Upper Lake
(eastern population) causing the western population to

spawn approximately one to two weeks earlier than the
eastern population. For both populations, the entire duration of spawning lasts for about one month, but most fish
reproduce within one week [58]. During peak spawning
of the western population, gill nets were exposed overnight at two to three different localities (approximately
100 to 500 m apart) in both the eastern and western part
of the lake (Fig. 1). Early the next morning males of the
eastern population were carefully removed from the gill
nets and transported alive to the western part of the lake.
Females and males of the western population were
removed from the gill nets and females were stripped
immediately. For the hybridization experiments, eggstrands from western females were fertilized with either
the sperm of a male from the western population (parental cross) or from the eastern population (hybrid cross).
Six days later, egg-strands from eastern females received
the same treatment, but in the reverse direction. Each fish
was crossed only once. This procedure resulted in four different crosses, parental crosses from the eastern (N = 5)
and western (N = 6) population, a hybrid cross F11 using
females from the eastern and males from the western population (N = 7), and a hybrid cross F12 using females from
the western and males from the eastern population (N =
9).
We did not initially catch sufficient numbers of ripe
females from the western population to conduct all F12
hybrid crosses directly in the field. Therefore, we took
seven nearly ripe western females and ripe eastern males
to the laboratory. Females were kept in a 250 liter aquarium (10°C, continuous flow of lake water), males were
kept in aerated water bottles. Since females may become
ripe and running within a few hours, we checked the
females twice a day by applying slight pressure on the
abdomen. As soon as a female could be stripped (3
females on the day following capture, 3 other females during the following 5 days) the egg-strand was fertilized with
the sperm of a male from the eastern population.

To determine hybrid fitness, we used a combined fitness
measure (CFM) according to Hatfield and Schluter [29] by
multiplying the proportion of fertilized eggs by the proportion of larvae that had hatched from fertilized eggs.

Breeding and acquisition of data
Fertilized egg-strands were incubated in separate tanks (9
liters, constant supply of tap water at 0.1 liter min-1, temperature 11°C, raised to 18°C during the following 4
days, 14 h of light). Three to four days after fertilization
the number of eggs in each tank was reduced from several
thousands to approximately 1000 by cutting out a piece of
the middle part of every egg-strand. The number of unfertilized eggs was counted for each egg-strand piece. One to
two days after hatching the number of hatched larvae and
dead embryos was counted. These data were used to calculate the initial number of eggs per tank and find the proportion of eggs that were successfully fertilized and the
proportion of larvae that successfully hatched from fertilized eggs.
