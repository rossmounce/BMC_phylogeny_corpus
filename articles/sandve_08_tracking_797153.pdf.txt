Abstract
Background: Grasses are adapted to a wide range of climatic conditions. Species of the subfamily
Pooideae, which includes wheat, barley and important forage grasses, have evolved extreme frost
tolerance. A class of ice binding proteins that inhibit ice re-crystallisation, specific to the Pooideae
subfamily lineage, have been identified in perennial ryegrass and wheat, and these proteins are
thought to have evolved from a leucine-rich repeat phytosulfokine receptor kinase (LRR-PSR)-like
ancestor gene. Even though the ice re-crystallisation inhibition function of these proteins has been
studied extensively in vitro, little is known about the evolution of these genes on the molecular level.
Results: We identified 15 putative novel ice re-crystallisation inhibition (IRI)-like protein coding
genes in perennial ryegrass, barley, and wheat. Using synonymous divergence estimates we
reconstructed the evolution of the IRI-like gene family. We also explored the hypothesis that the
IRI-domain has evolved through repeated motif expansion and investigated the evolutionary
relationship between a LRR-domain containing IRI coding gene in carrot and the Pooideae IRI-like
genes. Our analysis showed that the main expansion of the IRI-gene family happened ~36 million
years ago (Mya). In addition to IRI-like paralogs, wheat contained several sequences that likely were
products of polyploidisation events (homoeologs). Through sequence analysis we identified two
short motifs in the rice LRR-PSR gene highly similar to the repeat motifs of the IRI-domain in cold
tolerant grasses. Finally we show that the LRR-domain of carrot and grass IRI proteins both share
homology to an Arabidopsis thaliana LRR-trans membrane protein kinase (LRR-TPK).
Conclusion: The diverse IRI-like genes identified in this study tell a tale of a complex evolutionary
history including birth of an ice binding domain, a burst of gene duplication events after cold
tolerant grasses radiated from rice, protein domain structure differentiation between paralogs, and
sub- and/or neofunctionalisation of IRI-like proteins. From our sequence analysis we provide
evidence for IRI-domain evolution probably occurring through increased copy number of a
repeated motif. Finally, we discuss the possibility of parallel evolution of LRR domain containing IRI
proteins in carrot and grasses through two completely different molecular adaptations.

Background
The Poaceae family (grasses) contains some of the most
economically important and well studied plant species,
e.g. maize, wheat, barley, and rice. Generally speaking the
Pooideae subfamily, which includes wheat, barley and
forage grasses, are adapted to cold seasons. Many species
in this subfamily can withstand temperatures far below
freezing and intercellular ice formation [1,2]. Rice and
maize on the other hand belongs to the subfamilies
Ehrhartoideae and Panicoideae, respectively, and are
adapted to warm and tropical climates. Pooideae lineage
(from now on referred to as cold tolerant grasses) adaptation to cold climates makes grasses an interesting model
system for studying climatic adaptation at the physiological and molecular level.
Frost tolerance adaptations are in many organisms associated with the evolution of antifreeze proteins (AFPs) [3].
AFPs can affect freezing- and ice crystallisation related
stress via different mechanisms. Thermal hysteresis (TH)
depresses the freezing point at which ice crystallisation
initiates, which render it possible for organisms to survive
under freezing temperatures. Ice re-crystallisation inhibition (IRI) on the other hand does not hinder ice crystallisation but manipulates the growth of the ice crystals such
that small ice crystals grow at the expense of larger ice crystals, and this has been suggested to prevent or minimize
the cellular damage in plants [4]. A third mode of AFP
action is membrane stabilisation which has been reported
for a fish AFP [5]. Animal AFPs generally possess high
thermal hysteresis (TH) characteristics and lower ice crystallisation initiation temperature by 1–5°C [6,7]. Plant
AFPs on the other hand have low TH-activity, but exhibits
strong ice re-crystallisation inhibition (IRI) activity [6].
Genes encoding peptides with IRI capacity have evolved
independently several times in different lineages of higher
plants. These IRI peptides are homologous to diverse protein classes, e.g. thaumatin like proteins, endochitinases,
endo-B-1,3-glucanase, and leucine rich repeat (LRR) containing proteins [6,8,9]. Three LRR-domain containing IRI
proteins (LRR-IRI) have been identified in plants, one in
carrot (DcAFP; accession number AAC6293) and two in
wheat (TaIRI1 and TaIRI2 with accession numbers
AAX81542 and AAX81543) [10,11]. DcAFP has been classified as a polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (PGIP)
but does not exhibit PGIP activity [12]. LRR motifs span
across the entire processed DcAFP protein and form 10loop beta-helix secondary structure with solvent exposed
asparagine residues at putative ice binding sites [13].
TaIRI1 and TaIRI2 genes (accession numbers AY9968588
and AY968589) have been identified as homologous to
the LRR-domain coding region of a rice phytosulfokine
LRR receptor kinase (OsLRR-PSR: NP_001058711) and an
Arabidopsis trans-membrane protein kinase (AtLRR-TPK:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/245

NP_200200). The wheat IRI peptides differ structurally
from DcAFP in that the LRR-domain only comprises
about half of the processed peptide [10].
In addition to the N-terminal LLR domain, wheat IRI proteins have a C-terminal repeat domain consisting of two
similar A and B motifs, NxVxG and NxVxxG, respectively.
This repeat domain has been reported to exhibit strong in
vitro IRI capacity [14]. Interestingly, blast search yields no
sequences with homology to the IRI-domain outside the
subfamily of cold tolerant grasses [10]. Protein modelling
has shown that the A and B repeated motifs of the IRIdomain folds into a B-roll with ice binding sites matching
the prism face of ice [15]. Expression studies have shown
that increased expression levels in wheat [10] and perennial ryegrass [Rudi et al, unpublished] are correlated to
cold acclimation, but no in vivo studies to determine the
localisation of these grass IRI peptides have been reported
in the literature. However, TaIRI1 and TaIRI2 have been
predicted to encode a N-terminal 20 amino acid signal
peptide domain targeting the proteins to the secretory
pathway, suggesting that the peptides could be located in
the extracellular space [10].
While DcAFP is evolutionarily closely related to PGIPs;
TaIRI1 and TaIRI2 genes are thought to have evolved from
a LRR-PSR like ancestor gene. Furthermore, the evolutionary origin of the IRI-domain in grass IRI genes is much less
obvious, because the IRI-domain is not homologous to
any other sequences outside the cold tolerant grass lineage. Tremblay et al. [10] proposed a "TE-hypothesis" to
explain this apparent lack of homologous coding regions;
that the IRI-domain had arisen by a transposable element
(TE) insertion. However, no TE signature sequence could
be identified surrounding the IRI-domain [10], thus no
empirical data supports the TE-hypothesis so far.
Here we report the identification and characterisation of
novel LRR-IRI homologous genes in cold tolerant grass
species. We perform a detailed study of the evolutionary
relationships between OsLRR-PSR and IRI-like genes by
analysing sequence divergence at synonymous sites. We
also use synonymous site divergence to trace the evolutionary history of the IRI-like gene family with respect to
gene duplication events. The evolution of gene families
per se is in itself a much debated topic, and gene family
expansion and subsequent functional diversification is
thought to have been a significant factor contributing to
adaptations to new environments [16,17]. The evolution
of the IRI-like gene family of cold tolerant grasses is discussed in the context of the Duplication-DegenerationComplementation (DDC) model [18]. Finally we address
the unresolved matter of the evolutionary mechanism
underlying the birth of the cold tolerant grass IRI-domain,

and propose a novel hypothesis on the evolution of this
IRI-domain.

Results
Screening of perennial ryegrass BAC libraries
Initial screening of the perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne)
LTS18 BAC library with the LpAFP primer pair produced
two hits, from which LpIRI1 (EU680848) and LpIRI2
(EU680849) were isolated. The NV#20F1-30 BAC library
produced four hits with the LpIRIx primer pair, and three
hits with the LpAFP primer pair. LpIRI4 (EU680851) was
subsequently isolated from one of the four positive LpIRIx
hits and LpIRI3 (EU680850) was isolated from one of
three positive LpAFP hits. All genes isolated from perennial ryegrass were intronless and encoded putative peptides with high identity to the wheat TaIRI1 and TaIRI2
genes (blastp < 4e-10). LpIRI1, LpIRI4, and LpIRI3 were
similar in size and encoded peptides of 285, 242, and 254
amino acids, respectively. LpIRI2 encoded a shorter ORF
of 150 amino acids that was 94% identical to the LpIRI4
IRI-domain. The IRI-domain of LpIRI3 is identical to an
earlier identified partial IRI peptide encoded by LpAFP
(AJ277399).

Nucleotide alignments of the LpIRI-like genes showed
that LpIRI2 has undergone a deletion of almost the entire
LRR-domain coding region, the only remains of it being a
102 base pair (bp) fragment upstream of the LpIRI2 putative start codon. This could indicate that LpIRI2 is a pseudogene or a non-functional allele. Non-functional
sequences are expected to evolve under neutral expectation, which means that the rate of non-synonymous to
synonymous substitutions (w) is expected to be 1. Average w between LpIRI2 and the other perennial ryegrass
sequences was estimated to be 0.56 which suggests that
LpIRI2 is under selective constraints despite the major
deletion in the LRR-domain.
In silico identification of IRI-like sequences
The blastn EST search resulted in 189 wheat, 100 barley,
21 tall fescue (F. arundinacea), 5 Italian ryegrass (L. multiflorum) and 2 darnel ryegrass (L. temulentum) sequences.
In silico mining produced from zero to eleven full length
IRI-like sequences (i.e. with a start and stop codon) per
species (Table 1), and sequences were annotated as follows; an initial two letters indicating latin species name,
"C" indicating a contig of more than two ESTs, and lastly
an identifier number. The number of ESTs in the contigs
ranged from 2 to 40 (Table 2), with an average of 17 ESTs
per contig. In addition we identified several partial IRIlike sequences; one partial wheat IRI-like contig of 10
ESTs, and three partial barley sequences of 2, 3, and 6 EST
sequences. The partial sequences were not included in further analysis. A barley mRNA, AK249041, did not align to
any barley contig but coded for a full length IRI-like ORF,

hence we included this mRNA in our dataset. In silico mining with tall fescue, Italian ryegrass, and darnel ryegrass
ESTs did not produce any full length IRI-like sequences. In
silico EST mined sequences were considered validated if a
core nucleotide sequence from NCBI had > 99% identity
over > 200 bp. TaC3 was validated as being identical to
TaIRI1, and HvC1 was validated by being identical to a
full length mRNA sequence (AK252915). Accession numbers for ESTs belonging to full length IRI-like contigs
acquired through in silico mining are included in additional material [see Additional file 1].
Predicted protein structure characterisation
The OsLRR-PSR peptide sequence was used as a template
for comparisons of the LRR-domains. The OsLRR-PSR is
suitable for this purpose because it is a putative homologue to the LRR-domain of the IRI-like sequences. In the
following peptide structure characterization we assume
that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all IRIlike grass genes encoded the same domain architecture as
OsLRR-PSR. OsLRR-PSR was predicted to encode one LRR
N-terminal domain (LRR-NT), 21 internal LRR homologous motifs (1–21), and a protein kinase (PK) C-terminal

domain. Only the LRR-NT and six internal LRR motifs
were predicted with significant E-values by Pfam. Compared to OsLRR-PSR all predicted IRI-like peptides have
reduced number of LRR motifs and lacks the PK-domain.
Three internal LRR motifs did not align to any OsLRR-PSR
LRR motifs. These have probably arisen through deletions
in the LRR-domain causing two partial LRR motifs to
merge into a novel LRR motif. Comparative sequence
analysis suggests that deletions between LRR motifs 1–16,
2–16, and 12–16 of a OsLRR-PSR-like grass ancestor gene
have resulted in three novel LRR-domains; LRR1b, 2b,
and 16b (Fig. 1).
The IRI-domain also varies in size by number of repeated
motifs (Fig. 1). About 60% of all sequences with an IRIdomain have 15 repeat motifs or more. Six sequences
were detected to have a reduced number of repeat motifs,
or had completely lost the IRI-domain. Analysis of codon
based nucleotide alignments revealed that frameshift (FS)
mutations could be identified in four of the IRI-like
sequences (TaC3, TaC10, TaC11, and AK249041) that
showed reduced IRI-domain size (data not shown). HvC3
is the only IRI-like sequence with a completely reduced
IRI-domain. For all sequences in the HvC3 contig additional information on abiotic conditions under which the
plants had been grown were included in the EST files.
Without exception all ESTs originated from tissue sampled from etiolated barley seedlings, and not from cold
acclimated tissue. This is congruent with HvC3 lacking the
entire ice binding IRI-domain, suggesting that IRI-like paralogs are involved in several different stress responses.
Prediction of the subcellular location of the IRI-like peptides (see methods) predicted a signal peptide that targets
the peptides to the secretory pathway present in all IRIlike peptides, except from LpIRI2. The lack of an LpIRI2
signal peptide, and the fact that LpIRI2 has undergone a
deletion of almost the entire LRR-domain could suggest
that LpIRI2 is in fact a non-functional allele or pseudogene. However the results from the w estimates contradict
the non-functionality hypothesis. Alternatively the lack of
a signal peptide can be interpreted as that LpIRI2 simply
has evolved a different function than the IRI-like peptides
with a conserved signal peptide.
Phylogenetic analysis of IRI-like paralogs
OsLRR-PSR has highest homology to IRI-like genes outside the Pooideae subfamily (blastp E-value of 2e-46) and
was therefore used as an out-group in the phylogenetic
analysis. The paralog phylogenies of perennial ryegrass,
barley, and wheat IRI-like peptide sequences are given in
Figure 2A, 2B, and 2C, respectively. In the wheat phylogeny TaIRI2, the amino acid sequence with the highest
number of conserved LRR-domains, diverge as a monophyletic branch, while all other wheat sequences with fur-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/245

ther reduced LRR-domain sizes form a second
monophyletic group. This large monophyletic group can
be subdivided into two smaller monophyletic clades (Fig.
2C). In group I a FS mutation in the IRI-domain of TaC3
shortens the ORF and separates TaC3 structurally from the
other sequences. One might be tempted to speculate if
this FS is due to alignment errors but the FS in the TaC3
contig have been validated independently by the full
length mRNA TaIRI1. Group II contain IRI-like genes with
high degree of divergent predicted peptide structure, i.e.
putative peptides with strongly reduced and completely
lost IRI-domain (TaC9 and TaC11) as well as predicted
peptides with large IRI-domains. Alignments of predicted
amino acid sequences with all FS mutations removed, that
were used for the phylogenetic analysis, are presented in
additional material [see Additional file 2, 3, and 4].
Estimation of synonymous divergence of IRI-like sequences
If we assume a molecular clock, synonymous substitution
rates (dS) between two DNA sequences can be interpreted
as a relative measurement of time since MRCA, thus for
two paralogous genes dS can be interpreted as the time
since gene duplication [19]. Without being able to
account for all the IRI-like paralogs existing in a genome
we cannot infer if two paralogs descend from a single
duplication event (i.e. being true paralogs) or if they are
products of two separate duplication events. We therefore
restricted our initial analysis of IRI-like gene duplication
events to only comprise the dSmax and dSmin for all pairwise comparisons. The dSmax-dSmin range can be interpreted as the evolutionary time span in which all
duplications of IRI-like genes in our dataset have
occurred.

The average dS between OsLRR-PSR and LRR-domains of
all IRI-like sequences from cold tolerant grasses was estimated to 0.97 (standard deviation (SD) = 0.11). Hence if
OsLRR-PSR is the true ortholog of IRI-like genes, the radiation of cold tolerant grasses from rice predates the initiation of IRI-like gene family expansion in our dataset (Fig.
3A). All paralog dS ranges for wheat, barley and perennial
ryegrass overlapped, however there are large range differences. These range differences is caused by the low dSmin
range of wheat and perennial ryegrass IRI-like sequences
(Fig. 3A). For perennial ryegrass the dS between LpIRI2
and LpIRI4 lowered the dSmin estimate from 0.40 to 0.03.
Dissection of wheat paralog dS estimates showed that the
low wheat dSmin range could be traced back to low pairwise dS within the monophyletic clades I and II (Fig. 2C).
If dS estimates from sequence pairs within clade I and II
were removed the wheat dSmin shifted from 0.01 to 0.39.
Very low dS between paralog pairs might reflect the inclusion of highly diverged alleles in our paralog dataset.

diverged genotypes in our dataset could potentially give
an inflated polymorphism level producing artificial contigs that are alleles rather than paralogs. To identify putative false paralogs we set an allelic dS threshold of dS <
0.03 (see methods section). Based on this definition we
identified two putative allelic sequence pairs TaC2-TaC11
(dS = 0.01) and LpIRI2-LpIRI4 (dS = 0.03).
Estimation of synonymous divergence between control
genes
The ten control orthologs chosen for evolutionary rate
control and their pairwise dS estimates are listed in Table
3. Based on these genes the average dS between rice and
cold tolerant grasses were estimated to be 0.54 with an
average SD between dS estimation methods of 0.08. The
estimated divergence of rice and cold tolerant grasses
based on the control genes (dS = 0.54) is substantially
lower than the minimum equivalent estimate found by
using OsLRR-PSR and IRI-like genes (dS = 0.72) (Fig. 3A

and 3B). The average dS between perennial ryegrass and
wheat genes were 0.32, with an average SD of 0.04
between the estimation methods.
Molecular analysis of LRR and IRI-domains
The alignment of the LRR-domain of OsLRR-PSR and the
IRI-domains of a subset of the IRI-like peptide sequences
shows two blocks of strikingly high conservation between
the OsLRR-PSR and two IRI-domain motifs (Fig. 4). The
two motifs have 2/3 of the motif sequence residues conserved between rice and cold tolerant grasses. The first
motif has an Ile-Val substitution while the second motif
has a Leu-Val substitution, neither of which are substitutions with large effect on hydrophilic properties.

Relatively low level of conservation between DcAFP and
grass IRI-like peptide sequences was found (blastp 1e-4).
All sequences in the LRR-domain alignment (Fig. 5) have
a blast E-value of < 1e-18 to at least one other sequence in
the alignment, but no larger blocks of conservation
between DcAFP and any monocot LRR-domain can be
identified. However we observe that several blocks of 2–4
conserved residues exist throughout the alignment of the
LRR-domain between DcAFP and grass IRI-sequences.

Discussion
Until now only three cold tolerant grass IRI protein coding genes have been reported; a partial coding sequence of
an IRI-domain from perennial ryegrass [14], and two
highly identical full length mRNA paralogs from wheat
[10]. Through in silico mining and BAC sequencing we
have identified 15 full length and 8 partial novel IRI-like
genes in cold tolerant grasses. In addition, we have
obtained the complete sequence of LpAFP. The data accumulated leaves no doubt: cold tolerant grasses of the Pooideae subfamily have evolved a lineage specific family of
IRI-like genes.
IRI-gene family radiation happened after the cold tolerant
grass divergence
The prevailing hypothesis on the evolution of LRR-IRI-like
genes belonging to cold tolerant grasses is that they are
lineage specific and that an OsLRR-PSR-like gene is the
MRCA [10]. This hypothesis was proposed based on
sequence homology data only and we therefore re-examined this idea using more rigorous statistical methods by
estimating synonymous divergence. When employing a
commonly used mutation rate for grasses of 6.5*10-9 [2022], estimated by Gaut et al. [23], the synonymous divergence level between OsLRR-PSR and IRI-like sequences
suggested a MRCA about 75 Mya. This is slightly higher
than upper thresholds of some published rice-Pooideae
divergence estimates [22]. However, our estimate of divergence time between rice and cold tolerant grasses based
on the control genes suggest a rice-Pooideae divergence

only 42 Mya. This is similar to divergence estimates published by Patterson et al. [24] and Salse et al. [20], dating
back 41–47 and ~46 Mya, respectively. Our wheat and
perennial ryegrass divergence estimates is dated ~10 million years prior to a previously published estimate of ~35
Mya [25].
The observed discrepancy between the two divergence
estimates of rice and cold tolerant grasses in our study
(Fig. 3A and 3B) can be interpreted in two different ways.
The OsLRR-PSR gene is the true ortholog of IRI-like genes
and the incongruent divergence time estimates are caused
by differences in molecular clock rates. Or alternatively, if
the molecular clock rate is similar, it follows that OsLRRPSR diverged from IRI-like genes long before rice and cold
tolerant grasses diverged (Fig. 3). The burst of IRI-like
sequence duplications must then have occurred in the
ancestor genome of rice, and this implies that the rice
genome subsequently must have lost all genes belonging
to the IRI-like gene family. Even though loss of genes and
whole gene families is not an uncommon feature of plant
genome evolution [16,24], elevated clock rate differences
is a more parsimonious explanation to the divergence estimate differences seen in Figure 3A and 3B. Evolutionary
rate differences are highly common among closely related
species, different lineages of a species, and also within a
genome [26,27]. When using a single gene family to estimate divergence between species, as with the IRI-like
genes, deviation from the average genome clock rate
would be expected. As an example the clock rate of the ten
control genes varied from 4.1–7.1*10-9, with an average
rate of 5.4*10-9, when using a divergence time between
rice-cold tolerant grasses of 50 My.

Assuming true orthologous relationship between OsLRRPSR and IRI-like genes we can calibrate an average molecular clock rate for IRI-like genes using the dS = 0.97 and
assuming an absolute divergence time of 50 Mya (see
methods). This gives us an estimate of an IRI-like gene
family specific clock rate of 9.7*10-9. Employing this
adjusted clock rate pushes the estimates for the initiation
of IRI-like gene duplications forward to 36, 27, and 39
Mya for wheat, perennial ryegrass and barley, respectively.
This is approximately 3–14 My after our estimate for
divergence between rice and cold tolerant grasses based
on the control genes.
Species specific differences in IRI-like sequence numbers
Twice as many IRI-like sequences, partial and full length,
were identified in wheat compared to barley (Table 1). In
silico mining is vulnerable to methodologically introduced uncertainties. For example, the fact that the wheat
EST database at NCBI is more than twice as large (1.2 M
ESTs) than for barley (500 K ESTs) could be a contributing
factor to the differences in numbers of IRI-like mined
sequences because we expect that the EST database size is
positively correlated to transcriptome coverage of an
organism. A separate effect of a larger EST database will be
the inclusion of ESTs from an increased number of genotypes, which could be a source of introduction of allelic
polymorphisms.

Even though methodological properties might elevate the
number of wheat sequences identified to some extent, we
believe that much of the difference in wheat and barley
IRI-like sequence numbers are related to genomic ploidy
level differences. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is an allo-hexaploid originating about 8.000 years ago. It has three
homoeologous genomes A, B, and D, which are estimated

to have diverged 4.5–2.5 Mya [25]. Our results from the
phylogenetic analyses, supported by the dS estimates, suggests that IRI-like sequences within monophyletic clade I
and II (Fig. 2) could be homoeologous rather than paralogous. But low pairwise dS can alternatively reflect recent
gene duplications. Consequently our inferences on the
evolutionary relationship between putative wheat
homoeologous sequences must be viewed in a critical
manner.
A model of wheat IRI-like sequence evolution
As mentioned, wheat differs from the diploid grasses in
our study in that it has many more and younger IRI-like
paralogs, some of which probably can be accounted for by
wheat polyploidisation. Using the IRI gene specific clock
rate of 9.7*10-9 we built a model of the evolutionary history of wheat IRI-sequences using a phylogenetic
approach (Fig. 6A). According to literature and the data
acquired in this study wheat and barley specific duplications would be younger than ~35-25 My and wheat specific duplications would be younger than ~11 My [25].
The internal nodes of the phylogeny in Fig. 6 can therefore
be interpreted as putative ancient duplication events happening before divergence within Pooideae (DA), putative

duplication events specific to wheat and barley (DWB),
putative speciation event between wheat and barley (SWB),
putative gene duplication events specific to wheat (DW),
speciation events of the A, B, and D genomes of wheat
(SABD), and lastly allelic divergence (A).
The evolutionary model with adjusted clock rates
strengthens our hypothesis on the homoeologous relationship of the wheat clade I and II sequences (Fig. 2). The
divergence between TaC6 and TaC2/TaC11 are predicted
slightly earlier than the polyploidisation event, thus this
internal node could not be classified unambiguously.
Sub-trees of clade I and II, in which we have included the
barley sequence with lowest synonymous distance to each
clade, are presented in Figure 6B and 6C, respectively. The
sub-trees further support the hypothesis that clade I and II
represents genes that mainly have arisen through polyploidisation events. In both sub-trees the closest related
barley sequence is estimated to have diverged from the
wheat clade I and II about 15 Mya, coinciding with wheatbarley divergence [25]. However without a complete
knowledge of the orthologous relationships of the IRI-like
sequences the inferences on evolutionary relationships
are somewhat speculative.

Structural and functional diversification of the IRI-like
gene family
A striking feature of the IRI-like gene family is the structural differentiation between paralogs (Fig. 1). Structural
diversification of IRI-like genes, as seen in our sequence
collection, would be expected to affect the spectrum of
IRI-like peptide function, because both LRR and IRIdomains are known to be involved in substrate binding
[15,28]. One interpretation of this pattern is that IRI-like
sequences with complementary combinations of LRR
motifs and IRI-domain sizes are selected for and retained
in the genome, which is what we expect from the duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) model of
paralog evolution [18]. DDC predicts that mutations in
regulatory elements increase the probability of paralog
retention because it leads to partitioning of ancestral functions (subfunctionalisation), and the model has proven to
be an important contribution to understanding evolution
of paralogous genes [29,30]. The DDC model has later
been expanded to coding sequences [31,32], and recently
a combination of regulatory and structural DDC has been
demonstrated [33,34].

Regulatory subfunctionalisation in gene expression and
tissue localisation has been demonstrated between TaIRI1
and TaIRI2 (TaC3) [10], two genes coding for highly
divergent LRR-domain structure and length. In our study
we have also found evidence that peptide structure divergence has led to sub- or neofunctionalisation. A barley
IRI-like sequence contig (HvC3) with no IRI-domain still
seems to play a functional role under etiolation. This suggests that the LRR-domain of IRI-like genes may play a
functional role in multiple stress responses. Other LRRdomain containing genes in plants have also been shown
to be involved in stress responses under drought stress
and as a key membrane-bound regulator of absiscic acid
signalling [35,36].
One interesting aspect of the structural divergence pattern
is that all genes except LpIRI2 are predicted to encode a
conserved N-terminus signalling domain targeting the
proteins to the secretory pathway. Secretion to the apoplast is expected for proteins with ice interacting functions. In the light of these data, an interpretation of the
structural variability of LRR-domains, combined with the
apparent conservation of the N-terminal signalling
domain, is that IRI-like genes might be under selective
pressure for a continuous ORF from the signalling
domain across the LRR-domain and into the IRI-domain,
conserving the crucial function of apoplast export of IRI
peptides. The LRR-domain itself might not be under functional conservation. As an example: the full length
sequenced mRNA AK249041 from barley has a N-terminal conserved predicted signal peptide motif, a com-

pletely reduced LRR-domain with no predicted LRR
motifs, and an IRI-domain.
Less dramatic polymorphisms between paralogs, such as
single amino acid substitutions or small motif number
differences could potentially have a large effect on the
functionality. Single amino acid substitutions have been
shown to radically change AFP functionality in both plant
and animal AFPs [13,37]. Chakrabartty and co-workers
[38] showed that only small deletions in an AFP with
repetitive structure from flounder altered the ice interacting properties dramatically. Thus, all the observed polymorphisms between IRI paralogs, even down to single
amino acid substitutions, could potentially be of functional significance.
Birth of an IRI repeat domain
The molecular mechanisms underlying the metamorphosis from an OsLRR-PSR-like ancestor gene into the first
bipartite IRI-like gene have been addressed by Trembley et
al. [10]. They proposed the "transposable element
hypothesis" (TE) suggesting that the IRI-domain is a TE
insertion that has resulted in a FS mutation and caused the
loss of the PK-domain. However no TE signatures were
found flanking the IRI-domain [10]. Based on results
from our sequence analysis (Fig. 4) we propose a competing hypothesis on the evolution of the IRI-domain,
namely the repeated motif expansion (RME) hypothesis.
It has been shown that expansions of domains by duplication of repeated motifs are common in genes of repetitive structure [39]. We suggest that IRI motifs have
increased in copy number by a yet unknown mechanism,
possibly illegitimate recombination, slippage, or uneven
crossing over. Contrary to the TE-hypothesis the RME
hypothesis can explain the evolution of the IRI-domain
and at the same time account for the existence of two IRI
motif-like blocks in OsLRR-PSR (Fig 4). Lastly, if the entire
IRI-domain is a TE-insertion we would expect this TE
sequence to be found at other loci in grasses. However no
such reports of TE-like sequences homologous to the IRIdomain are known to our knowledge.
Convergent evolution of LRR containing AFPs
LRR-domain containing proteins are extremely abundant
in plants. The largest LRR containing plant peptide group
is LRR receptor kinases (LRR-RK), having more than 200
members in the A. thaliana genome [40]. Plant disease
resistance associated genes (NBS-LRR) comprise another
large LRR containing functional group [41]. Common for
the function of LRR domains in any peptide is that they
are associated with peptide-peptide recognition and binding interactions [42-44].

Through comparative protein domain analysis we have
shown that LRR-domains of IRI-like genes are much less

conserved compared to the predicted signal peptide motif
flanking the N-terminus of the LRR-domains. We believe
that this could be due to lack of selective constrains on the
LRR-domain function itself, or perhaps selection for divergent LRR-domain functions as predicted by DDC. Whatever functional role today's IRI-like sequence LRRdomains might play; there is little doubt that the LRRdomain of IRI-like genes in cold tolerant grasses shares an
ancient common ancestor with the LRR-domain of DcAFP
(Fig. 5). However, while cold tolerant grass IRI-like proteins have evolved ice binding capacity through the evolution of an IRI-domain [14,15], DcAFP have evolved ice
binding capacity through changes in the LRR-domain
itself [13]. DcAFP and grass LRR-IRI genes are therefore

intriguing examples of parallel evolution of function by
two completely different molecular mechanisms; evolutionary alterations of a pre-existing LRR-domain and evolution of a novel repeat domain with ice binding
properties.

Conclusion
The IRI-like genes identified by Sidebottom et al. [14] and
Tremblay et al. [10], and in this study tell a tale of a complex evolutionary history that includes birth of an ice
binding domain, a burst of gene duplication events after
cold tolerant grasses radiated from rice, domain structure
differentiation between paralogs, and sub- and/or neofunctionalisation of IRI-like proteins. Given more

detailed functional studies, the IRI-like gene family can
provide a valuable example of how duplicated genes
evolve novel functional spectres. The hypothesis that evolution of IRI-like genes has been important for Pooideae
grass adaptation to cold climate [10] is strengthened by
this study as we show that the evolution of the IRI-like
gene family probably happened after the divergence from
rice, and furthermore that the numbers of IRI-like genes
are higher than earlier known.

same conditions as the LpAFP primers. DNA maxi-preps
of the BAC-clones were preformed using the NucloBond
BAC 100 Kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL, Düren, Germany). For
BAC-sequencing 500 ng BAC-DNA was combined with 20
μM of primer, 8 μl BigDye 3.1 ready mix and dH20, to 20
μl total volume. Following 5 min of denaturising at 95°C,
50 cycles were performed with 30 s at 95°C, 10 s 50°C,
and 4 min 60°C. Subsequently, the sequencing reactions
were precipitated and sequenced on an ABI PRISM 3100
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

Methods
In silico IRI-like sequence mining
A blastn search in the NCBI database was performed using
TaIRI1. All sequences with blast E-value < 1*10-20 were
downloaded from the EST and core nucleotide databases.
Contigs were aligned with alignment parameters set to >
97% identity and > 40 nucleotides overlap using
Sequencher (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
The 97% identity threshold was set to allow contig alignments to include different allelic forms and polymorphisms caused by EST sequencing errors. Non-coding
nucleotides (i.e. promoter and 3'UTR) were removed after
an initial prediction of open reading frame (ORF), and
subsequently the sequences were realigned with identical
parameters. All contigs were translated into their predicted amino acid sequence. Sequence contigs with lack of
start and stop codon due to incomplete sequence coverage
or putative sequence errors causing frame shift mutations
were not included in the analysis. We validated the in silico
mining method by aligning EST mined unigenes with four
full length cDNA clones of grass IRI-like genes from the
NCBI core nucleotide collection (barley; AK252915,
AK249041/wheat; AY968588, AY968589).
BAC identification and sequencing
Two perennial ryegrass BAC libraries were used to identify
novel IRI-like genes [45]. Primers for the initial identification of novel IRI-like genes were designed from coding
sequences of LpAFP (AJ277399) and a partial sequence of
a Festuca pratensis IRI-like homolog (EU684537). The
LpAFP primer pair had forward primer 5'GATGAACAGCC
GAATACGATTTCT3' and reverse primer 5'GCTTCCAGAT
ACAACGTGGTTGCT3', denaturing at 94°C for 4 minutes
and then 35 cycles of 94°C 30 s, 60°C 45 s, 72°C 45 s,
and 72°C 10 min. Primer pairs designed from the F. pratensis sequence were forward primer 5'TGTCATATCGGGG
AACAACA3' and reverse primer 5'ACATGGTTTCGTCCG
GATAC3' denaturing at 94°C for 4 minutes and then 40
cycles of 94°C 10 s, 60°C 45 s, and 72°C 1.30 min, and
70°C for 10 min. We also designed a third primer pair,
referred to as LpIRIx primer pair, with forward primer
5'GAATGCCGTATCTGGGGACC3' and reverse primer
5'GTGGTTCCCGGATACGGTATT3', based on multiple
sequence data acquired from sequencing of the above
mentioned genes. This primer pair was used under the

Pfam [46]. We verified the Pfam results by visual inspection of the sequences defining a LRR motif as LxxLxLxx, or
variations of it where L is substituted with I, V, or A. To
track the molecular evolution of the LRR-domain, OsLRRPSR was used as a template for comparison to the predicted domains of IRI-like sequences. LRR motifs predicted by Pfam were considered significant if the Pfam Evalue was lower than 0.05. IRI-like amino acid sequences
were aligned with the LRR-domain of OsLRR-PSR and the
LRR motifs in IRI-like sequences were named according to
which of the LRR motif number in OsLRR-PSR they
aligned to. IRI-domain characterisation was performed by
visual scoring of the total number of repeat motifs
(NxVxG/NxVxxG). IRI-domain repeat motifs were considered as "present", and counted, when they contained no
more than one amino acid substitution compared to the
consensus motifs. Signal peptide domains were predicted
by TargetP [47].
Estimation of substitution rates
To estimate divergence times between putatively paralogous and orthologous sequences we used the average dS
obtained from three different methods, Nei & Gojobori
[48], Kumar [49], and the Li-Wu-Luo [50] method, in
MEGA (4.0) [51]. As a control for evolutionary rates of
IRI-like genes we calculated the average dS values of ten
randomly selected orthologs from wheat, perennial ryegrass, and rice. Maximum likelihood estimation of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution ratios (w) was
performed using Codeml in the PAML software package (v
3.15) [52]. The 3 × 4 codon substitution model was chosen for Codeml w estimations. PAL2NAL [53] was used to
make codon based nucleotide alignments for the use in
MEGA and PAML. The absolute time of divergence
between orthologs and paralogs was estimated using a
rate of 6.5*10-9 substitutions/synonymous site/year for
grasses [23]. For estimation of mutation rates and absolute divergence times we used the relationship k = dS/2T,
where k is the absolute rate of synonymous substitutions
per year, dS is the synonymous substitution rate, and T is
the absolute time since divergence. To identify putative
alleles not grouped in the same contig due to methodo-

logical errors, a cut-off threshold of dS = 0.03 was used.
This threshold was set on the basis of average inter-allelic
dS for LRR-domains of 27 disease resistance like genes in
A. thaliana [54], and inter-allelic dSmax of LpIRI1 calculated from twelve European perennial ryegrass genotypes
(dSmax = 0.015, data not published).
Molecular and phylogenetic analysis
All amino acid and nucleotide alignments were made by
MAFFT [55] and manually edited in BioEdit [56], and the
phylogenetic trees were constructed in Treefinder [57]. An
AIC criteria test [58], implemented in the Modeltest
option in Treefinder, was used to choose substitution
model for the phylogenetic analysis. ML trees were bootstrapped with 1000 replicates. Synonymous distance
based trees were inferred by UPGMA from a pairwise dS
distance matrix in MEGA. Alignment figures were prepared by BoxShade http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/
BOX_faq.html.
