Abstract
Background: Some of the most difficult phylogenetic questions in evolutionary biology involve
identification of the free-living relatives of parasitic organisms, particularly those of parasitic
flowering plants. Consequently, the number of origins of parasitism and the phylogenetic
distribution of the heterotrophic lifestyle among angiosperm lineages is unclear.
Results: Here we report the results of a phylogenetic analysis of 102 species of seed plants
designed to infer the position of all haustorial parasitic angiosperm lineages using three
mitochondrial genes: atp1, coxI, and matR. Overall, the mtDNA phylogeny agrees with independent
studies in terms of non-parasitic plant relationships and reveals at least 11 independent origins of
parasitism in angiosperms, eight of which consist entirely of holoparasitic species that lack
photosynthetic ability. From these results, it can be inferred that modern-day parasites have
disproportionately evolved in certain lineages and that the endoparasitic habit has arisen by
convergence in four clades. In addition, reduced taxon, single gene analyses revealed multiple
horizontal transfers of atp1 from host to parasite lineage, suggesting that parasites may be
important vectors of horizontal gene transfer in angiosperms. Furthermore, in Pilostyles we show
evidence for a recent host-to-parasite atp1 transfer based on a chimeric gene sequence that
indicates multiple historical xenologous gene acquisitions have occurred in this endoparasite.
Finally, the phylogenetic relationships inferred for parasites indicate that the origins of parasitism
in angiosperms are strongly correlated with horizontal acquisitions of the invasive coxI group I
intron.
Conclusion: Collectively, these results indicate that the parasitic lifestyle has arisen repeatedly in
angiosperm evolutionary history and results in increasing parasite genomic chimerism over time.

Background
The parasitic lifestyle has evolved repeatedly in nearly
every major lineage of life, and in the broad sense includes
brood parasitism, social parasitism, genomic parasitism,
and nutritional parasitism [1,2]. Among plants, nutritional parasites obtain water and nutrients directly from
their photosynthetic host plant through a specialized
feeding structure, the haustorium, which is attached to
either host shoots or roots [3]. These plants include both
hemiparasites (parasites with the ability to photosynthesize) and holoparasites (those that cannot photosynthesize) [3]. While both hemi- and some holoparasites grow
largely exterior to the host, certain holoparasites grow
nearly completely embedded within the host plant tissues
as endoparasites, emerging only during sexual reproduction [3,4]. Though most parasites can be classified according to their photosynthetic status and the nature of their
interactions with their hosts, insight into the evolution of
parasitic traits has been hampered by the lack of a broad
phylogenetic perspective.
The parasitic lifestyle is thought to have evolved 8 [3] to
11 [5] times in flowering plants, but comprehensive phylogenetic analyses have never been performed to investigate the evolutionary frequency and pattern of the shift to
heterotrophy in angiosperms. The lack of a robust phylogenetic hypothesis for parasitic angiosperms has also
hampered studies of genome evolution [6] and the inference of ancestral conditions that may have promoted the
evolution of the haustorial parasitic lifestyle. Furthermore, although considerable progress has been made
towards the molecular systematics of many parasitic
plants [5,7-12], several parasites have obscure positions
within angiosperm phylogeny, accounting for 7 of 18
unplaced taxa in the recent molecularly-based ordinal
classification of flowering plants [13].
Classifying parasitic plants using morphological characters has long been difficult because of the extreme reduction or alteration of vegetative and floral morphology that
occurs in holoparasitic lineages [3,14]. The primary challenge associated with inferring the phylogenetic placement of many parasites using molecular data in a global
angiosperm context is spurious long-branch attraction
[15] caused by their highly divergent DNA sequences
[5,11]. Furthermore, the apparent loss of photosynthetic
and other genes that have been commonly used to study
flowering plant phylogeny [5,6,16] has prevented the
inclusion of many parasites in otherwise comprehensive
studies [13,17,18]. A possible solution to these phylogenetic problems is through the study of plant mtDNA,
which is retained regardless of photosynthetic ability and
has proven useful for determining the phylogenetic affinities of some parasitic plants [10-12]. To infer the number
of origins and distribution of parasitism in a global

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/248

angiosperm phylogenetic context we used three mtDNA
genes:atp1, coxI, and matR.
While mtDNA may offer several advantages for the study
of parasitic plants, its use necessitates careful consideration of the possibility of horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
[19-26]. Of particular relevance to our study are reports
that mitochondrial genes may be horizontally transferred
between hosts and parasites [21,23,25,27]. Also, the invasive mitochondrial coxI group I intron (which is lacking
from most plants) has been independently, horizontally
acquired from unknown vectors in various flowering
plants [28]. One consequence of such transfers is that parasites may appear closely related to their hosts, thereby
obscuring their true phylogenies; however, if such occurrences are relatively uncommon, the majority of loci
should correctly predict the phylogenetic positions of
most parasites. Our multigene approach coupled with
broad angiosperm ordinal sampling will allow us to estimate the number of parasitic plant origins in flowering
plant phylogeny, interpret potential horizontal transfers
of foreign mtDNA into parasitic plant genomes and discern whether parasites are more likely to horizontally
acquire DNA than non-parasites.

Results
Phylogenetic placement of parasites
Analyses of combined atp1, coxI, and matR sequence data
(4,019 aligned base pairs; TreeBASE accession S1932)
were undertaken because initial single gene analyses
showed that there were no strongly supported conflicting
nodes between trees estimated from separate datasets
(trees not shown). Maximum likelihood analyses of the 3
gene combined dataset resulted in a single best tree (-lnL
= 43115.38) that represents the first molecular phylogenetic placement of all parasitic lineages within a global
angiosperm context (Fig. 1 &2). This mtDNA phylogenetic tree shows largely congruent relationships among
non-parasitic angiosperms compared to independent
analyses of chloroplast and nuclear sequence data
[13,17,18]. Highly supported placements were obtained
for nine parasite lineages that corroborate earlier focussed
studies: Hydnoraceae with Piperales (BP = 99; PP = 1.0)
[10], Cassytha with Laurales (BP = 99; PP = 1.0) [8], Cuscuta with Solanales (BP = 99; PP = 1.0) [9], Orobanchaceae with Lamiales (BP = 100; PP = 1.0) [7],
Lennoaceae with Boraginaceae (BP = 100; PP = 1.0) [29],
Mitrastemonaceae with Ericales (BP = 76; PP = 1.0) [11],
Cytinaceae with Malvales (BP = 94; PP = 1.0) [23], Krameriaceae with Zygophyllaceae (BP = 98; PP = 1.0) [30], and
Rafflesiaceae with Malpighiales (BP = 98; PP = 1.0)
[11,31] (Fig. 1). Lesser support was obtained for Balanophoraceae with Santalales (BP < 50; PP = 1.0) (a relationship suggested in previous analyses [12]) and
Apodanthaceae with Cucurbitales (BP < 50; PP = 0.66),

although an Apodanthaceae + Cucurbitales relationship is
further supported by a unique shared 3 bp (one codon)
insertion at bp 341 in matR (coordinates from Arabidopsis
thaliana NC001284). Combined analyses were entirely
unclear about the placement of Cynomorium; however,
sequence data of matR-alone suggest this parasite is
related to Saxifragales (BP = 72; PP = 1.0; tree not shown),
in agreement with previous analyses [12,32]. In contrast,
combined atp1 and coxI analyses support a placement of
Cynomorium with Sapindales (BP < 50; PP = 1.0; tree not
shown).
Within this phylogenetic framework, it appears that haustorial parasitism has arisen at least 12 independent times
as indicated by the orange (mostly hemiparasitic) and red
(holoparasitic) branches (Fig. 1). It is not clear whether
parasitism arose once in the ancestor of Balanophoraceae
+ Santalales or if the parasitic lifestyle independently
evolved in the two lineages because the earliest diverging
branches of Santalales are not parasitic and it is unlikely
that parasitism is a reversible trait [33]. Thus, it is possible
that there are actually 13 origins of parasitism implied by
this tree (Fig. 1). Because some parasite phylogenetic positions did not receive high bootstrap support, we
attempted to discern whether a hypothesis of fewer than
12 origins of parasitism could be rejected. Trees that constrained Apodanthaceae + Cynomoriaceae + Santalales +
Balanophoraceae to be monophyletic in any of the three
positions shown in Fig. 1 were rejected by the S-H test as
significantly worse than the unconstrained tree of Fig. 1 (P
< 0.05 in all cases). Trees that constrained the position of
Apodanthaceae as sister to Cynomoriaceae or Santalales
were significantly worse than the optimal tree of Fig. 1 (P
< 0.05). Trees constraining the position of Santalales +
Balanophoraceae with Apodanthaceae were significantly
worse than the optimal tree (P < 0.05) while a position
sister to Cynomoriaceae could not be rejected. Finally,
trees that constrained the position of Cynomoriaceaeonly to be sister to either Apodanthaceae or Santalales +
Balanophoraceae were not significantly different from the
optimal tree shown in Fig. 1. Thus, these data suggest that
there were as few as 11, or as many as 13, origins of parasitism in angiosperm evolutionary history.
The phylogenetic tree shown in Fig. 1 also reveals a surprising feature of parasite evolution: endoparasitism has
arisen in four independent lineages. These four lineages,
marked by an "E" in Figure 1, include Apodanthaceae,
Rafflesiaceae, Cytinaceae, and Mitrastemonaceae (hereafter referred to as "endoparasites"). Because these four
endoparasite families have traditionally been included in
Rafflesiaceae it was previously assumed that endoparasitism was uniquely derived [3], although several recent
studies have shown that these families are not closely
related [11,21,23,31]. Figure 1 clearly indicates that the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/248

endoparasites are not monophyletic. In fact, trees that
constrained the endoparasite clade to be monophyletic in
any of the four positions shown in Fig. 1 were rejected by
the S-H test as significantly worse than the unconstrained
tree of Fig. 1 (P < 0.05 in all cases).
Putative horizontal transfer of atp1
Because of unexpected phylogenetic relationships noted
in preliminary analyses of atp1 (tree not shown), single
gene studies using one representative for each rosid and
asterid order, together with the four endoparasites, were
performed. Figure 3 shows that analyses of atp1-alone suggest all four endoparasite lineages are closely related to
their primary host lineages: Pilostyles (TX + AZ) with Pisum
+ Psorothamnus (BP = 81; PP = 1.0), Rafflesia + Rhizanthes
with Vitis + Tetrastigma (BP < 50; PP = 0.72), Cytinus with
Helianthemum (BP = 71; PP = 1.0), and Mitrastema + Quercus (BP = 100; PP = 1.0) with Fagus (BP < 50; PP = 0.94)
(Fig. 3A). Although node-specific support for these parasite + host plant sister relationships is not high in most
cases, it is extremely unlikely that they would all independently be related to their hosts by chance alone. In all
of these parasites, atp1 has an intact open-reading frame
and we have never found any evidence for additional copies of the gene using PCR. These results could indicate that
all of these endoparasites are closely related to their primary host lineages; however, the matR and coxI single
gene analyses (Fig. 3B & C), the combined three gene
analyses (Fig. 1 &2), as well as recent studies
[11,21,23,31] suggest otherwise for Pilostyles, Rafflesia +
Rhizanthes, and Mitrastema. In contrast, Cytinus does
indeed appear to be related to Malvales with all three
genes analyzed here (Fig. 3A–C). Host plant contamination cannot explain the results for atp1 because, in all
cases, replication of our methods produced identical
results and comparisons of sequences from the parasites
to the host individuals from which they were collected,
revealed numerous differences (Fig. 3A–C). Rather, these
results suggest a different history for atp1 as compared to
coxI and matR in Pilostyles, Rafflesia + Rhizanthes, and
Mitrastema, most likely caused by historical horizontal
gene transfer (HGT) from their hosts. Conflicting histories
for atp1 relative to matR + coxI in these parasites are also
inferred from statistically significant S-H test results that
compared the unconstrained tree in Fig 3A to one which
constrained the positions of the endoparasites to those of
Fig. 1 (P < 0.05). However, when each parasite was analyzed singly, only the position of Mitrastema was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Furthermore, corrected
pairwise divergences (K) and estimated branch lengths
indicate substantial disparities in the level of divergence
of atp1 compared to coxI and matR in these parasites relative to non-parasites (Fig. 3A–F). Specifically, levels of
sequence divergence and branch lengths for coxI and matR
in Pilostyles are ca. 4–5 times higher than in non-parasitic

plants. However, in stark contrast, the level of sequence
divergence for atp1 is indistinguishable between Pilostyles
and non-parasites. This disparate pattern is also detectable
to a lesser extent in Rafflesia, Rhizanthes, and Mitrastema.
This observation is consistent with the expectation that
recently transferred xenologous atp1 genes should be less
divergent than native sequences that have resided for
longer periods of time in the rapidly evolving parasitic
plant genomes.

To investigate whether the putatively horizontally transferred sequences are expressed and RNA edited in any of
the endoparasites, we performed RT-PCR from Rafflesia
cantleyi floral RNA and compared the atp1 cDNA sequence
to the DNA sequence from the same individual. Figure 4
shows that not only was cDNA obtained from the Rafflesia
RNA, suggesting that atp1 is expressed, it appears that the
RNA undergoes editing because of the observed T at position 931 in the cDNA relative to C in the same position of

the DNA sequence. This result is consistent with a C to U
edit at this site in the transcript. The fact that the atp1 transcript is edited suggests that it is transcribed in the mitochondrion of this species. This edit site is at a
nonsynonymous, first codon position that results in the
encoding of serine rather than proline. This RNA edit site
has not been reported for other species [34].
When comparing the atp1 sequences of two accessions of
Pilostyles thurberi (one from Arizona [AZ] and one from
Texas [TX]), we noted that the two sequences differed at
ten sites. This is a surprisingly large number of differences
considering these are accessions of the same species and
that the mutation rate of mitochondrial DNA in plants is
typically very low [35] (although see [36] and [37] for two
rare exceptions). Eight of the differences were restricted to
the central region of the gene. In contrast, comparisons of
atp1 from Pilostyles (AZ) to the host Psorothamnus individual it was collected from, revealed that the two species
were identical for 804 bp in the central region of the gene,
but have a disproportionate 15 differences at the 5' and 3'
ends. Because the Pilostyles (AZ) sequence was obtained in
multiple PCR amplifications from independent samples,
the result is not likely explained by PCR-mediated recombination. Instead, we hypothesized that Pilostyles (AZ)
atp1 may represent a chimeric xenolog that is the result of
multiple historical horizontal gene transfer events from its
hosts. To investigate this possibility, we performed gene

conversion analyses that detected an 804 bp region of Pilostyles (AZ) (region II; Fig. 5A) that appears to have been
converted by its current host sequence (P < 0.05). Separate
phylogenetic analyses of the two regions including multiple members of Fabales reinforced the hypothesis of a different history for these two regions as well. Regions I of
atp1 show that the two Pilostyles sequences are nested
within Fabales and are most closely related to the caesalpinioid legume, Gleditsia (Fig. 5B), whereas the putatively, recently converted region II shows that Pilostyles
(AZ) is most closely related to its current faboid host, Psorothamnus (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, the region II tree also
suggests that Pilostyles (TX) may have independently horizontally acquired atp1 multiple times as well, perhaps
recently from its modern host, a species of Dalea (Fig. 5C).
An S-H test suggested that the tree estimated from the
putatively converted region (region II; Fig. 5) is statistically incongruent with the data of the adjacent 5' and 3'
regions (regions I; Fig. 5) (P = 0.002) and vice versa (P =
0.009).
coxI intron acquisition in parasitic plants
A final striking and unexpected observation of mtDNA
sequence variation is that the mt coxI gene in nearly every
parasitic lineage has been invaded by a group I intron (all

lineages with the coxI intron are marked by
or ● in Fig.
1). The only sampled parasitic plants lacking introns are

Krameria and Schoepfia, both hemiparasites; all other sampled hemiparasites and all holoparasites possess the
intron. Multiple independent invasions and rampant horizontal transfer of this intron in angiosperms has been
previously reported [28]; however, no correlation to life
history, biogeography or phylogeny was found. Yet, it
appears that there is a correlation between the evolution
of parasitism and the presence of the coxI intron. The
probability of observing 10 gains and 0 losses of parasitism on branches with the coxI intron as reconstructed on
the tree shown in Fig. 1 is very low (P < 0.001). However,

to avoid potential bias due to our exhaustive sampling of
parasite lineages, we investigated this question further at
the ordinal level. Based on our data shown in Fig. 1 and
literature reports [28], more than 350 species of plants
from all monophyletic orders of flowering plants (sensu
[13]) have been surveyed for the intron. Using this innformation, we assigned intron presence or absence to every
order, as well as 6 families that are not currently placed in
an order (Amborellaceae, Nymphaeaceae, Chloranthaceae, Vitaceae, Zygophyllaceae, and Boraginaceae)
(Fig. 6). Out of the 24 orders that we have scored as intron

times on branches that also are inferred to have the intron (shown by numbers within circles). Only Krameriaceae and Cynomoriaceae do not appear to be associated with intron containing lineages. The probability of 10 origins of parasitism and zero
losses of parasitism on branches that have the intron is < 0.001.

negative, 16 have had at least half of the included families
sampled for the coxI intron (Fig. 6). Assuming this tree
representing relationships among all orders of
angiosperms, the probability of observing 10 gains and 0
losses of parasitism is < 0.001. However, because we have
sampled less than half of the included families from Oxalidales, Brassicales, Myrtales, Asterales, Liliales, Asparagales, Poales, and Pandanales, we investigated the effect of
re-scoring these orders as intron positive on the observed
correlation. Even in this case, the probability of observing
10 gains and 0 losses of parasitism is < 0.01. The results
are quantitatively similar regardless if we use ACCTRAN
or DELTRAN to resolve equivocal ancestral states or if we
resolve the polytomous relationships presented in [13]
differently from what is shown.
One hypothesis for the apparent association of parasitism
and the coxI intron is that the parasites have horizontally
acquired the intron from their current hosts. This hypothesis is not supported by our data because in cases where
the parasite is highly host-specific, the host lineages do
not have an intron. For example, Rafflesia and Rhizanthes
only parasitize Tetrastigma (Vitaceae), yet this genus (and
other sampled members of the family) does not have an
intron, and there is no evidence that it ever had one, as
indicated by the lack of intron co-conversion sites [28]. In
other cases, such as Cuscuta and Orobanchaceae, the parasite introns are closely related to intron sequences of
close non-parasitic relatives and thus appear to have been
transmitted vertically from non-parasitic ancestors (Fig.
7). Overall, the intron phylogeny is highly discordant
with angiosperm phylogeny as indicated by a significant
S-H test comparing the optimal tree to one that constrains
asterids rosids, orders, and families of plants to be monophyletic (P < 0.05). This results corroborates earlier findings [28] of widespread HGT of this mobile sequence (Fig.
7).

Discussion
Phylogenetic aspects of parasitism
The pattern of evolution of haustorial parasitism in
angiosperms is striking in several regards. First, it appears
that parasitism has evolved repeatedly in many major
groups of flowering plants from magnoliids to derived
eudicot lineages, and most of these lineages (8 of 11–13)
now consist entirely of nonphotosynthetic parasites.
However, monocots, campanulids, and caryophyllids (ca.
22%, 12%, and 7% of angiosperm diversity, respectively)
have never evolved parasitism or else retain no extant parasitic representatives. In contrast, within lamiids alone
(ca. 12% of angiosperm diversity), parasitism has independently evolved 3 times including both shoot (Cuscuta)
and root (Orobanchaceae and Lennoaceae) parasites,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/248

although this may not be statistically different from zero.
Why some lineages have a propensity to become parasitic
is not clear; however, the strong correlation of the distribution of the coxI intron (which, at the ordinal level, is
also rare in monocot and campanulid orders, but rich
throughout rosid and lamiid orders) with the independent origins of parasitism (Fig. 1 and 6) is tantalizing and
will be discussed below. Second, the highly specialized
trait of endoparasitism [3], in which most of the vegetative portion of the parasite lives inside of its host with
emergence occurring during sexual reproduction, has
evolved independently in at least 4 lineages, Mitrastemonaceae, Cytinaceae, Rafflesiaceae, and Apodanthaceae.
Furthermore, although not studied here, Arceuthobium
(Santalales) is endoparasitic [3]. Evolutionary convergence of the endoparasitic lifestyle in one-third of the parasitic angiosperm lineages and only in the most derived
species of Santalales suggests this may be a common adaptive peak of parasite-host relationships. As in animals, a
selective advantage of the endoparasitic mode for plants
may be to avoid predators (herbivores) and live in a
homeostatic environment [1]. Third, this ordinal levelplacement of all parasitic angiosperms (except Cynomorium), corroborates other recent studies and together
resolve many long-standing taxonomic questions. Thus,
revisions of existing classifications are needed to include
many of these parasites in orders they have not been
placed in previously. This is particularly true of Rafflesiaceae, Mitrastemonaceae, Cytinaceae, and Apodanthaceae. Further work is required to refine the positions of
most parasitic plants within their orders. However, use of
mtDNA will require cognizance of the possibilities of
HGT from host-to-parasite [21] and also from parasite-tohost [25,27]. Surprisingly, in spite of the conflicting
nature of atp1 relative to coxI and matR in the endoparasites Rafflesiaceae and Mitrastemonaceae, confident
placements were obtained in the combined analyses. In
contrast, the position of Cynomorium is obscured by the
conflicting phylogenetic positions implied by matR (Saxifragales) and coxI + atp1 (Sapindales). This conflict could
suggest possible horizontal transfer (HGT) of matR or
both coxI and atp1 in Cynomorium; however, neither Sapindalean nor Saxifragalean hosts have been described in
the literature to our knowledge. A placement of Cynomorium with Saxifragales has been suggested by 18S as well
as matR [12].
Multiple Horizontal Gene Transfers of atp1
One of the major predicted consequences of long-term
parasitic interactions is that genetic transfer will occur
between host and parasite [1,2,38]. Although evidence to
support this hypothesis has been scarce in eukaryotes, the
phylogenetic evidence we present from atp1 of endoparasitic plants is consistent with this prediction. While HGT
is plausible from host-to-parasite, it is not clear that such

coxI intron phylogeny in flowering plants
coxI intron phylogeny in flowering plants. Phylogenetic relationships among 49 angiosperm coxI intron DNA sequences
inferred using ML (-lnL = 5938.60). Lineages shown in green are non-parasitic. Lineages in orange are mostly hemiparasitic,
while those in red are holoparasitic. Bootstrap support values >50 and posterior probabilities > 0.8 are shown before and after
the "/" respectively. Ordinal (or familial, if currently unplaced to order) classification is shown next to each taxon. Basal
angiosperms and monocot orders are labeled in blue, rosid orders are labeled in purple, asterid orders are labeled in black, and
Santalales are shown in yellow. General host plant preference for each parasitic plant lineage is shown next to each parasite
(based on ref. # 3 and personal observations by TJB, JRM, and CWD). Overall phylogenetic relationships of the intron
sequences are highly discordant with angiosperm phylogeny. Horizontal acquisition of the intron in parasites from their hosts
does not seem likely because in no case is a highly supported relationship found between a parasite and any of its host lineages.
Vertical acquisition of the intron in Cuscuta and Epifagus is supported by this tree because of the highly supported relationship
found between these parasites and their close relatives.

transfers should be advantageous to recipients. One possibility in parasites is that if their native mt loci were
degenerate but could have been replaced by a highly conserved copy, then transfer should be strongly selected for
because it would help ensure efficient metabolism in
these extreme holoparasites. Yet, there is no statistical evidence for this hypothesis in the chimeric atp1 sequences
of Pilostyles because the retained portions of the presumably older caesalpiniod xenolog (regions I) are not divergent at nonsynonymous sites relative to photosynthetic
plants. Regardless of any potential selective advantage of
HGT, it appears that atp1 is mobile because of the multiple transfers that we and others have reported [19,23,27].
Because atp1 appears to be located near sites of recombination in some plants [39], its mobility may be facilitated.
Further support for HGT in parasitic plants may come
from surveys of other genes, particularly from the nuclear
genome of these parasites.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/248

ically more widespread historical transformation. This is a
particularly interesting possibility because the coxI intron
in angiosperms is most closely related to those known
from fungi and the evolution of haustorial parasitism has
been hypothesized to have occurred via a mycoheterotrophic antecedent relationship [3]. Recently, genomic
comparisons have revealed that the shift to parasitism in
nematodes may have been facilitated by the recent acquisition of foreign DNA from bacteria [42]. Whether the
acquisition of foreign DNA was a key step in the evolution
of parasitism in plants awaits genomic studies of these
parasites.

Conclusion
Genomic chimerism among angiosperms is probable
given that there have been multiple origins of parasitism
throughout flowering plant history and that HGT is possible from host to parasite [21] and vice versa [27].
Although some parasitic lineages are highly host specific,
many others have a broad range of potential host species
(Fig 7), and host shifting is to be expected through the history of individual parasite lineages [1-3]. Therefore, even
if HGT between plant parasites and their hosts is very rare,
through time this could result in plant genomes that are
complex chimeras of horizontally as well as vertically
acquired sequences.

The close phylogenetic relationships of atp1 between
endoparasites and their hosts, the statistically significant
phylogenetic conflict of atp1 relative to matR + coxI, and
the differential evolutionary dynamics of atp1 relative to
coxI and matR, suggest that atp1 has been acquired horizontally in Rafflesia + Rhizanthes, Pilostyles, and Mitrastema
from their respective host lineages. The possibility of HGT
of plant mtDNA, including atp1, has been raised in other
angiosperms [19-23] and seems a likely explanation for
our results for several reasons. First, the horizontal transfer of macromolecules, including RNA, from host plant to
parasitic plant has been shown to occur experimentally
[40,41]. Second, these parasites (Rafflesia, Rhizanthes, Pilostyles, and Mitrastema) are wholly endoparasitic
angiosperms; they vegetatively grow completely embedded within their hosts to enhance the acquisition of water,
nutrients, and complex macromolecules. Third, because
reproductive tissues arise from the endophytic vegetative
tissue in these species, cells that carry horizontally
acquired host DNA are likely to give rise to reproductive
meristems and transmit the new DNA to future generations of the parasitic plant. Future studies should aim to
determine if a native copy of atp1 still exists in these parasites and characterize the genomic location and flanking
sequence of putatively transferred sequences.

Taxon sampling
We sampled representatives of at least one family from 44
of 45 orders from the recent ordinal classification of
angiosperms [13]. In total, 102 seed plant species from 92
angiosperm families were represented in addition to every
major parasitic plant group [3,5]. Three gymnosperms,
Pinus, Ginkgo, and Zamia, were included as outgroups to
root phylogenetic estimates. Although we attempted to
use the same DNA for all gene isolation, some composite
taxa were used in our analyses (see Additional file 1). In
the case of one of our samples of Malpighiales, Euphorbia
milli was used for matR and Croton alabamensis for coxI and
atp1. In the case of Malvales, Alcea rosea was used for matR
and Althaea officinalis for coxI and atp1. In the rest of the
cases, we isolated the 3 genes from the same DNA or different species of the same genus (see Additional file 1).

coxI intron invasion and genomic chimerism
Although there have been multiple horizontal acquisitions of the homing coxI intron throughout angiosperm
history [28], it is clear that this invasive sequence is more
prone to invade some angiosperm lineages than others
(eg. lamiids and parasites). While the source of the intron
is unclear in the parasites (and angiosperms in general
[28]), the acquisition of foreign DNA has been predicted
to be a key event in the evolution of parasitic angiosperms
[38], and this intron could represent a marker of a genom-

Molecular methods
General molecular methods, including DNA extraction,
PCR, and DNA sequencing were performed as previously
described [11,43]. The basic RNA extraction and RT-PCR
procedures followed published methods [44]. Great care
was taken to limit the possibility of host plant or other
contamination of the parasitic plant DNA samples,
including careful dissection of tissues distal to the hostparasite interface as well using multiple independent isolations from two laboratories and/or related species or

genera. Furthermore, we also sampled the host plant individuals of the holoparasites, Rafflesia pricei (Tetrastigma
diepenhorstii), Mitrastema yamamotoi (Quercus subsericea),
and Pilostyles thurberi (AZ) (Psorothamnus emoryi) so they
could be directly compared. This is a critical aspect of our
study and is absolutely necessary in order to discriminate
between putative cases of horizontal gene transfer and
contamination or the presence of phloem-mobile nucleic

formed data analyses and wrote and edited the manuscript.

Phylogenetic analyses
ClustalX [45] was used to produce preliminary sequence
alignments followed by minor manual adjustments.
Regions of uncertain alignment from all three genes, coxI
intron sequences [28], and known RNA editing sites for
atp1 and coxI were excluded prior to analysis [46]. Modeltest v3.06 [47] was used to determine the best-fit model of
nucleotide substitution for each data set analyzed; these
models were implemented during maximum likelihood
(ML) analyses with PAUP*4.0 [48]. ML heuristic searches
used 10 random addition sequences and TBR swapping.
Support values could not be determined using ML
because of the large computation time required, so bootstrap support (BP) values were obtained using GARLI [49]
from 100 replicates using an automated stopping criterion
set to 5,000 generations. Bayesian analyses were performed using MrBayes v3.0b4 [50]. Five chains were
simultaneously run for one million generations and these
were sampled every 100 generations. The first 10,000 generations were discarded as the "burn-in" period because of
convergence lnL after this point and posterior probabilities (PP) for individual clades were then obtained from
the remaining samples. Corrected pairwise divergences
were calculated using the optimal models of nucleotide
substitution determined by Modeltest for each gene separately. The S-H test [51] was used to test for statistically
significant differences among competing topological
hypotheses. Putative gene conversion events were identified using GeneConv [52]. The concentrated changes test
[53] was used to test for non-random association between
parasitism and the presence of the coxI intron by first tracing the intron distribution onto the tree in Fig. 1 or Fig. 6.
We tested the null hypothesis that gains and losses of
parasitism are randomly distributed over the angiosperm
phylogenetic tree. Probabilities for the 10 gains and 0
losses of parasitism occurring in lineages that possess the
coxI intron were then determined by 1,000 simulations.

HBC surveyed the coxI intron distribution in parasitic and
nonparasitic plants, and initiated the coxI sequencing
efforts
