Developing a method for customized induction
of flowering

Abstract
Background: The ability to induce flowering on demand is of significant biotechnological interest. FT protein has
been recently identified as an important component of the mobile flowering hormone, florigen, whose function is
conserved across the plant kingdom. We therefore focused on manipulation of both endogenous and
heterologous FT genes to develop a floral induction system where flowering would be inhibited until it was
induced on demand. The concept was tested in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis).
Results: Our starting point was plants with strongly delayed flowering due to silencing of FT with an artificial
microRNA directed at FT (amiR-FT) [1]. First, we showed that constitutive expression of a heterologous FT gene
(FTa1), from the model legume Medicago truncatula, (Medicago) was able to rescue the amiR-FT late-flowering
phenotype. In order to induce flowering in a controlled way, the FTa1 gene was then expressed under the control
of an alcohol-inducible promoter in the late flowering amiR-FT plants. Upon exposure to ethanol, FTa1 was rapidly
up regulated and this resulted in the synchronous induction of flowering.
Conclusions: We have thus demonstrated a controlled-inducible flowering system using a novel combination of
endogenous and heterologous FT genes. The universal florigenic nature of FT suggests that this type of system
should be applicable to crops of economic value where flowering control is desirable.

Background
Flowering time is an important plant breeding target
[reviewed by [2]]. The time at which flowering occurs
affects the ensuing success of flower, seed and fruit
development, ease of harvest and marketing. In addition,
since flowering of vegetative crops and forages can be
negatively correlated with yield and nutritive quality,
the ability to delay flowering in such plants would be
advantageous. Therefore, our goal is to develop molecular-genetic tools for customization of flowering in
economically-important plants.
Plants use a combination of environmental and developmental cues to trigger flowering. The genetic networks that are involved in perception and response to
these floral signals is best worked out in the model
plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) [3-8]. Many of
the flowering time pathways ultimately converge on a
set of genes called floral integrators, which includes

FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and a closely related and
partially redundant homologue TWIN SISTER OF FT
(TSF) [9-12]. FT strongly activates flowering in Arabidopsis and mutants lacking a functional FT gene flower
very late, while transgenic plants over expressing FT
flower much earlier than wild type plants [9,10].
FT is the primary target of several flowering time
pathways. These include the long day pathway which
promotes flowering in response to long day photoperiods via CONSTANS (CO) mediated up regulation of
FT, and the vernalisation and autonomous pathways
that function to down regulate the flowering repressor
FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) thereby alleviating FLC’s
repression of FT [reviewed by [6,7]]. FT transcript is
expressed in the leaf vasculature where FT protein is
produced and moves via the phloem to the shoot tip
[1,13-15]. In the shoot apical meristem, FT partners
with FD, a bZIP transcription factor and switches on
genes, such as APETALA1, to initiate floral development
[16,17]. Thus, FT protein functions as an important
component of the mobile flowering hormone, florigen
[see reviews by [6,8]].

Older physiological studies demonstrated the universal
nature of florigen in plants [reviewed by [18]]. Consistent with this, orthologues of the Arabidopsis FT gene
are widespread in the plant kingdom (Figure 1a, b) and
promote flowering even in plants with different day
length requirements to Arabidopsis. For example, the
tomato FT orthologue SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS (SFT)
promotes flowering in day neutral tomato [19] and two
rice FT orthologues, Heading date 3a (Hd3a) and RICE
FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1) promote flowering in
rice, a short-day plant [20,21]. Like Arabidopsis FT, the
SFT, Hd3a and RFT1 genes encode a graft transmissible
floral signal [19,22,23]. In addition, over expression of
FT orthologues such as SFT can promote flowering in
heterologous transgenic plants [19]. Thus, despite differences in the upstream signaling pathways in different
plants, the induction of FT expression in leaves and its
movement to the apex where it triggers flowering
appears to be conserved.
Genetic engineering of flowering time in many cultivated species has been achieved by manipulation of
floral repressors or floral promoters, including the over
expression or inducible expression of FT to accelerate
flowering in transgenic plants [2,24,25]. Because of the
conservation of FT function across the plant kingdom,
we have focused on developing a controlled-inducible
flowering system that manipulates endogenous and heterologous FT genes. This utilizes the induction of a heterologous FT gene to trigger flowering in a background
in which flowering has been inhibited using an artifical
microRNA that targets the endogenous FT gene. The
system is based on the idea that artificial microRNAs
can be designed to specifically down regulate an endogenous gene, but should not affect the expression of a
sufficiently divergent functional orthologue from
another species. Here, we report on the development of
this system for inducing flowering on demand and
demonstrate its utility in Arabidopsis.

function to promote flowering in Arabidopsis. Since, in
a related project we are investigating the role of FT
genes in flowering regulation in the model legume Medicago truncatula (Medicago), we investigated whether a
Medicago FT gene might be a suitable heterologous
candidate. There are five FT genes in Medicago; the partial genomic DNA sequences of three FT genes (FTa1,
FTa2 and FTc) were described previously [27], while our
database mining revealed full length sequences for these
genes and two more, FTb1 and FTb2 (see also [28,29]).
FTa1 is predicted to be the most closely related protein
to FT with 71% identity. FTa2, FTb1 and FTb2 share at
least 64% identity with FT, while FTc is slightly less
similar at 61.7% identity to FT. Two key residues that
are important for FT function in Arabidopsis [30,31] are
present in four of the predicted Medicago FT proteins
(FTa1, FTa2, FTb1 and FTb2) (Figure 1a). The fifth predicted protein, FTc, has the conserved tyrosine residue,
but the conserved glutamine in FT is replaced by a histidine (Figure 1a).
Phylogenetic analysis of FT and the related TERMINAL FLOWER1 proteins, that repress flowering, shows
that FTa1 and FTa2 form a sister clade to FT/TSF) (Figure 1b). However, although FTa1 shares the highest
identity with Arabidopsis FT, all of the FT proteins are
as closely related to FT as the known functional FT
orthologues, Hd3a and RFT1 from rice [20,21] and SFT
from tomato [19].
To test if the Medicago FTa1 gene was likely to be
targeted by the amiR-FT, it was aligned with the amiRFT sequence. No significant similarity was identified
using BLAST nucleotide searches. The best alignment
that could be made using the MultAlin program is
shown in Figure 1c. The number of mismatches in this
alignment is 9 over the 21 base sequence, with 5 of
these in the 5’ region (from bases 2-12), which are
important for efficient target-transcript down regulation
[26]. This indicated that the FTa1 transcript was unlikely to pair with the amiR-FT and be degraded.

Results and Discussion
Selecting a heterologous FT gene to overcome the late
flowering phenotype of amiR-FT Arabidopsis plants

Overexpression of FTa1 rescues the late flowering
phenotype of amiR-FT transgenic plants

Our starting point was a late flowering transgenic line of
Arabidopsis in which flowering was inhibited by the
expression of an artificial micro RNA directed against
the FT gene (amiR-FT) in the phloem companion cells
[1,26]. This amiR-FT pairs with FT transcript in the
companion cells of the phloem and stimulates its degradation leading to gene silencing [26]. The amiR-FT
sequence is complementary to bases 234 to 254 of the
FT coding sequence (with one mismatch) (Figure 1c).
To overcome the late flowering phenotype of the
amiR-FT plants, an FT orthologue was needed that
would not be targeted by the amiR-FT, but could

Our first aim was to over express FTa1 in the amiR-FT
plants to test if this would rescue the late flowering phenotype. An expression construct with FTa1 fused to the
35S promoter (35S::FTa1) was generated. Transformed
T1 plants were selected, grown in flowering-inductive
long day conditions (LD, 16 h light, 8 h dark) and their
flowering time scored (Figure 2a).
Analysis of the leaf number at flowering showed that
the majority of the 35S::FTa1 T1 plants (19/22) flowered
considerably earlier than amiR-FT plants and wild type
control plants, Columbia (Col) (Figure 2a). This result
shows that over expression of FTa1 promotes flowering

Figure 2 Overexpression of Medicago FTa1 rescues the late
flowering phenotype of amiR-FT plants. AmiR-FT Arabidopsis
transgenic plants were transformed with a 35S::FTa1 gene
expression construct. a) Graph showing average total leaf number at
flowering of T1 plants (n = 19), two independent T3 homozygous
transgenic lines with the 35S::FTa1 construct and control plants (n =
11-16). The flowering time of transformant and control Arabidopsis
plants in long day (LD) or short day (SD) conditions was measured

in Arabidopsis and fully rescues the late flowering phenotype of amiR-FT transgenic plants. Thus, FTa1 functions to promote flowering in Arabidopsis, but does not
appear to be targeted by the amiR-FT.
Before constructing an inducible version of FTa1, we
confirmed that the early flowering phenotype observed
in the T1 generation plants was heritable and expressed
in their progeny. Two independent, homozygous T3
transgenic lines with single locus insertions were
selected. The T3 transgenic lines were grown in LD or
short day (SD, 8 h L/16 h D) conditions. The T3 lines
flowered much more rapidly than the control amiR-FT
plants in both conditions (Figure 2a). These results confirmed that the early flowering trait was heritable. In
addition, they showed that 35S::FTa1 also promoted
flowering in non-inductive SD conditions in which flowering of the control Col plants are delayed (Figure 2a).
Expression of the FTa1 transgene and endogenous FT
in the T3 lines and control plants in LD was measured
by qRT-PCR (Figure 2b and 2c). Since Arabidopsis FT
has cyclical diurnal expression, we harvested tissue 12 h
after dawn when FT levels are rising in wild type plants
grown in LD conditions [32]. As expected, in the presence of the amiR-FT, FT levels were lower in both
FTa1 transgenic lines and the amiRNA-FT line as compared to Col plants (Figure 2c). In contrast, the FTa1
transcripts were detected at high levels in the 35S::FTa1
lines (Figure 2b). This result confirmed that the FTa1
transgene was abundantly expressed in the T3 generation plants and this was consistent with their early flowering phenotype.
Ethanol induces synchronous flowering in amiR-FT plants
with an alc::FTa1 construct

Since expression of FTa1 from the 35S promoter rescued the late flowering phenotype of the amiRNA-FT

Yeoh et al. BMC Biotechnology 2011, 11:36
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/11/36

lines, we generated an alcohol-inducible version of FTa1
(alc::FTa1) [33]. AmiR-FT Arabidopsis transgenic plants
were transformed with the alc::FTa1 gene expression
construct and 19 T1 transformants were selected. The
T2 seed from these alc::FTa1 lines were sown out in LD
and exposed to ethanol vapour. Eighteen of these T2
families segregated plants that flowered at 20 leaves or
less (data not shown) which is much earlier than the
amiRNA-FT control plants (see Figure 2a). This result
suggested that flowering in these lines was inducible by
ethanol treatment.
To confirm this result, four independent homozygous
alc::FTa1 T3 Lines (TG1 to TG4) with single copy insertions were selected. Plants grown in LD were exposed to
dual ethanol vapour treatments in which10 day-old seedlings were treated with ethanol for 48 h and then exposed
for a second time at day 17 for 24 h and their flowering
time recorded (Figure 3). Three of the TG lines (TG1, 2
and 4) showed strong induction of flowering compared
to TG plants grown in the absence of ethanol. Analysis of
leaf number at flowering (Figure 3a) shows that the TG
plants flowered as early or earlier (TG1, 12.1 +/- SE 0.2;
TG2, 10.0 +/- SE 0.3 or TG4, 14.2 +/- SE 0.6 leaves) than
wild type Col plants (14.9 +/- SE 0.4 leaves). One other
line (TG3) showed a much weaker flowering promotion
in response to ethanol (32.6 +/- 2.9 leaves) compared to
the -EtOH treatment (52 +/- SE 1.3 leaves). In the
absence of ethanol, the TG lines all flowered late (ranging
from 40.3 +/- SE 1.1 to 54.5 +/- SE 1.1 leaves) and at a
similar time to the amiR-FT line (46.1 +/- SE 1.0 leaves).
There was no effect of ethanol on flowering of control
Col or amiR-FT plants.
The ability of ethanol to induce alc::FTa1 expression
was examined using qRT-PCR (Figure 4). Three out of
the four TG lines (TG1, 2 and 4) showed good induction of FTa1 expression after exposure to 24 h ethanol
while one (TG3) showed very little induction (Figure
4a). The very low FTa1 induction in TG3 correlated
with the delayed flowering in this line (Figure 3a and
3b). However, while TG1, TG2 and TG4 plants flowered
at about the same time after induction, the level of
FTa1 expression was very different. Thus there was an
absence of direct correlation between the level of FTa1
induction and flowering in the rapid flowering lines. In
the untreated TG lines, FTa1 was expressed at much
lower levels (Figure 4a), but was detectable by qRTPCR. However, clearly this was not at sufficient levels to
overcome the late flowering phenotype conferred by
amiR-FT. As expected, ethanol treatment did not alter
endogenous FT accumulation which was expressed at
lower levels in the transgenic lines than wild type Col
(Figure 4b).
In order to investigate the kinetics of FTa1 transcript
accumulation, we carried out an induction time course.

Transcript accumulation in the transgenic lines and control plants
was measured using qRT-PCR with levels normalised to At2g32170.
a) Relative transcript abundance of FTa1 after 10-day-old plants (TG1

time. b) Relative transcript abundance of endogenous Arabidopsis
FT after ethanol induction as in (a) (mean +/- SD of 3 PCR replicates

ethanol vapour. Transcript accumulation was measured using qRTPCR with levels normalised to At2g32170. Time course of
accumulation of FTa1 after 16 day-old TG1 plants were exposed to
ethanol vapour for 8, 12 or 24 h (mean +/- SD of qPCR on 2
biological replicates is shown). Induction was started at dawn.

FTa1 expression in TG1 plants in LD in response to ethanol vapour over 24 h was determined (Figure 4c). Levels of
FTa1 rose strongly within the first 8 h of ethanol exposure
and continued to rise over the next 16 h. No change in
expression was observed in the untreated TG1 plants over
the same time course. This rapid response to ethanol is
consistent with previous reports of ethanol induction of
alc:: reporter gene constructs [33].
These results indicated that ethanol vapour treatments
were sufficient to induce FTa1 expression and synchronous early flowering and thus rescue the late flowering
phenotype of the amiR-FT plants carrying the alc::FTa1
construct. In addition, the alc::FTa1 system gave tight
control of the transition to flowering as the transgenic
plants flowered late in the absence of ethanol.

FTa1 T3 transformants or control plants in LD conditions were
either exposed (+ETOH), or not (-ETOH), to ethanol vapour.

Next we tested if the timing of flowering could be
manipulated on demand by applying ethanol to plants
of different ages. TG1 plants were grown in LD conditions and groups of 10, 14 or 17 day-old plants were
exposed to a single 48 h ethanol vapour treatment. We
also repeated the dual ethanol treatment of 10-day- old
plants as described above. In addition, we tested if flowering could be induced in SD conditions by exposure to
ethanol. The number of days to flowering after the
onset of each ethanol treatment was recorded for each
plant (Figure 5).
In LD conditions, all ethanol treatments resulted in
induction of flowering in the majority of plants (Figure
5a-d). Floral buds were first seen on the earliest-flowering plants 11 days after the onset of all the ethanol
treatments. Thus these plants flowered 21 days, 25 days
or 28 days after sowing. A control group of TG1 plants
that were not exposed to ethanol were grown in parallel.
The first of these plants (3/12 plants) started to flower
39 days after sowing in LD. Thus the alc::FTa1 plants
could be induced to flower as early or earlier than wild
type Col plants (flowered at ~23 days after sowing,

which ethanol is applied.
In LD, all of the 14 and 17 day-old-plants were
induced to flower more rapidly than the untreated TG1
plants by a single exposure to ethanol (Figure 5b-c).
However, the response of the 10-day-old plants to the
single ethanol exposure was weaker (Figure 5a). While
10 of these plants were induced to flower by ethanol,
the two remaining plants were not. One of these plants
flowered 29 days after the start of the treatment (39
days after sowing), while the other still had not flowered
by 30 days after the start of treatment (40 days after
sowing). This was similar to the untreated TG1 controls.
The most effective of all the treatments in LD was the
dual ethanol treatment of the 10-day-old TG1 plants in
LD. This resulted in the most synchronous early flowering (Figure 5d). This indicated that there might be the
need for more sustained expression of FTa1, particularly
in younger plants in LD. This may be similar to wild
type Arabidopsis plants, where endogenous FT is upregulated by exposing SD-grown plants to a single LD,
but three LDs are required for commitment to flowering
[34]. In addition, repeated induction of a heat-shock
responsive FT transgene was most effective at promoting the transition to flowering and ensuing normal
flower development in transgenic poplar [24].
Flowering was also able to be induced in the majority
of TG1 plants by ethanol in SD conditions (Figure 5e).
Twenty day-old SD-grown plants were treated with
ethanol for 48 h followed by a 24 h treatment 5 days
later. Flower buds were seen 11 days after the onset of
ethanol treatment on the earliest flowering plants (31
days after sowing). In LD, the earliest flowering plants
also flowered 11 days after the initiation of ethanol
treatment (Figure 5a-d). However, not all of the SD
plants were induced to flower before the untreated TG1
plants. The latter began to flower from 50 days after
sowing (4/24 plants). Seventeen ethanol-treated TG1
plants had flowered before the untreated TG1 controls
began to flower, while seven had not (Figure 5e). This

Yeoh et al. BMC Biotechnology 2011, 11:36
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/11/36

indicates that in SD there may be a need for more sustained induction of FTa1 or treatment of older plants to
obtain floral induction in 100% of plants.
As controls for the induction experiment in SD, we
also included ethanol- treated Col and amiR-FT plants.
None of these plants had flowered by 63 days after sowing, at which time the experiment was halted. In addition, we grew a control alcohol-inducible transgenic
line, the alc::GUS transgenic line [35]. This gene expression construct allows for ethanol-inducible expression of
the b-GLUCURONIDASE (GUS) reporter gene. None of
the alc::GUS plants, whether ethanol treated or
untreated, had flowered by 63 days after sowing. Thus
the early flowering phenotype of the TG1 plants in SD
is due to ethanol induction of the alc::FTa1 geneexpression cassette.

Conclusions
Flowering time is a key trait in the breeding of crop and
ornamental plants. Our aim was to create a universallyapplicable floral induction system that will allow flowering to be induced on demand. Here, we have described
such a system and demonstrated its utility in the model
plant Arabidopsis.
We showed that the expression of an FT orthologue
from Medicago truncatula, FTa1, can overcome the
delayed flowering of a transgenic Arabidopsis plants
caused by expression of an artificial microRNA to the
Arabidopsis FT gene, amiR-FT. Tight, inducible control
of floral induction was engineered successfully using an
alcohol-inducible version of the FTa1 gene. The timing
of flowering could be manipulated by applying ethanol
to plants of different ages, to give plants that flowered
earlier or later than wild type. Endogenous Arabidopsis
FT remained low in the transgenic lines, consistent with
ongoing silencing by the amiR-FT. This indicates that
the Medicago FTa1 is sufficiently different from Arabidopsis FT to escape being targeted by the amiR-FT, yet
has the ability to strongly promote flowering.
The advantage of the FT- based approach tested here
in Arabidopsis is that because of the likely universal role
of FT in triggering of flowering, it should work in other
plants. Inducing flowering when desired has many commercial uses [2]. For example, one application of our
strategy might be to delay flowering in forage grasses
during grazing to give consistent nutritive value and
yield, but then later induce synchronous flowering for
seed production. Other applications in crops could
include inhibiting flowering, followed by inducing flowering to coincide with important market dates, or to
avoid peak summer temperatures. The use of the alc
inducible system should allow the system to be used in
a field setting [reviewed by [36]]. Thus, our system has

Page 8 of 11

all the attributes required of a biotechnological floral
induction system.
Although we have demonstrated the ability to overcome an artificial microRNA that targets a single FT
gene, in some cultivated species it might be important
to down regulate multiple FT genes to more effectively
delay flowering. For example, Arabidopsis FT has the
closely-related paralogue TSF and double ft tsf mutants
flower much later than the single mutants [1,11]. In
rice, two key FT genes have an even stronger impact on
flowering as plants with RNAi silencing of both genes
had not flowered by 300 days after sowing [21]. Mathieu
et al. (2007) demonstrated that it was possible to design
an artificial microRNA that could target both the Arabidopsis FT and TSF mRNA simultaneously. Plants overexpressing this amiR construct phenocopied the late
flowering of the ft tsf double mutant. Therefore, the use
of one or more artifical microRNAs should allow all the
FT family members involved in the induction of flowering of a particular species to be targeted. Care would
then need to be taken to select an FT orthologue from
another species that would be unaffected by the amiR(s).
In some cultivated species, natural variants exist that
have strongly delayed flowering [2]. In most cases, the
genetic reason for the delayed flowering has not been
determined. However, it is likely that often this is caused
by alterations to pathways upstream of FT that prevent
or delay the induction of FT. Thus, it is an attractive possibility that the late flowering of many natural variants
could be utilized in our inducible flowering system so
that the targeting of the endogenous FT genes using
amiR would not be necessary and that flowering could be
induced simply by using the alcohol-inducible FT gene.
In summary, we present proof-of-principle experiments that demonstrate a novel system for inducing
flowering on demand, which should provide a biotechnological method for the customization of flowering of
commercially important plants.

Methods
Database searches, sequence alignments and
phylogenetic analysis

FT and TFL1 genes in Medicago truncatula (Medicago)
were identified by tBLASTn searches (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, BLAST) with Arabidopsis FT against
Medicago genomic and EST sequences in the National
Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast and the DFCI Medicago Gene Index database http://compbio.dfci.harvard.
edu/tgi/cgi-bin/tgi/gimain.pl?gudb=medicago. FT and
TFL1 proteins from other species were obtained from
GenBank. Protein sequence alignments were performed
with ClustalW ( © 2007 Des Higgins, Julie Thompson,

Toby Gibson) and in some cases manually adjusted
using the BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor (© 19972007 Tom Hall). BioEdit was also used to calculate percentage identity and percentage similarity between a
pair of sequences after alignment. After alignment, boot
strap analysis with 1000 replications was performed with
SEQBOOT. The datasets were then subjected to distance matrix-based phylogenetic analysis using the programs PROTDIST and NEIGHBOR. CONSENSE was
used to combine all datasets into one tree based on the
majority rule consensus method which only includes
groups that are present in more than 50% of the individual trees. All phylogenetic programs were distributed
with the Phylogeny Inference Package (PHYLIP) 3.68
( ©1980-2008 University of Washington). Phylogenetic
trees were displayed with TREEVIEW 1.6.6 ( © 2000

Plant material, flowering time measurements and ethanol
treatments

All plant material used in this work was derived from the
Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heynh accession Columbia (Col).
The amiR-FT transgenic line (SUC2::amiR-FT; #NW48_
1-1) was described previously [1] as was the alc::GUS
(AlcAGus) transgenic line [35]. Flowering time and gene
expression analyses were carried out on plants grown
under long-day conditions (LD, 16 h light/8 h dark) or
short days (SD, 8 h light/16 h dark) in Percival growth
cabinets in ~150 μM m-2 s-1 cool white fluorescent light at
22°C in rockwool blocks moistened with hydroponics
media [38] [without Na2SiO3]. Flowering time measurements were carried out by recording the total leaf number
at the time of flowering and the days to flowering. Analysis
of the flowering time of plants in the presence of ethanol
was carried out by exposing plants to ethanol vapour provided by two microfuge tubes each containing 2 ml of
100% ethanol placed at the opposite ends of a rockwool
block. The plants and tubes were enclosed using a clear
plastic lid (length 38 cm, width 24 cm, height 12 cm) from

a Stewart Unheated Propagator which was not airtight.
The ethanol regimes used are described in the text. Analysis of gene expression in the presence of ethanol was carried out by exposing plants to ethanol vapour. The
regimes used are described in the text.
Plasmids and plant transformation

A genomic clone with the coding region and introns of
the FTa1 gene from Medicago truncatula were fused to
the CaMV 35S promoter (35S::FTa1) by recombination
in the Gateway binary vector PK2GW7 [39], or to the
AlcA promoter (alc::FTa1) in a Gateway compatible
alcR-alcA binary vector [[33], modified to be Gateway
compatible by Lawrence Hobbie and Catherine PerrotRechenmann CNRS, Gif sur Yvette, unpublished].
Details of the cloning procedures can be obtained from
the authors. The constructs were transformed into
amiR-FT transgenic plants which were Basta resistant.
The kanamycin-resistant T1 transformants were selected
in vitro and rescued onto rockwool blocks. Independent
homozygous, single copy, T3 lines were bred and used
for further work. The presence and identity of the transgenes in the transformed lines were confirmed by PCR
and DNA sequencing.
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and qRT-PCR

For gene expression experiments, RNA was extracted
from 50 - 100 mg of pooled plant tissue (total aerial
parts) using the RNeasy ® Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen).
A TURBO DNase on-column treatment was carried out
after RNA extraction (TURBO DNA-free™ Kit, Applied
Biosystem). RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop® N1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies Inc.).
One microgram total RNA was transcribed into cDNA
with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer using a (dT) 17 primer
(5’-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGATTTTTTTTTTTT
TTTTT-3’) [40]. As a control for potential genomic
DNA contamination, the same procedure was carried
out omitting the reverse transcriptase. To determine
relative gene expression levels using quantitative Real
Time PCR (qRT-PCR), 2 μl of a 20-fold diluted solution
of cDNA was used in a total reaction volume of 10 μl
1× SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems)
with final primer concentrations of 0.5 μM. Each cDNA
sample was analysed in triplicate PCR reactions, on a
7900 HT Sequence Detection system (Applied Biosystems). Relative gene expression levels were calculated
using the 2 -ΔΔCT method [41]. The gene expression
experiments were repeated on independently grown
plants and similar results were obtained. Primers used
for quantification of gene expression levels were tested
for amplification efficiency prior to use with a dilution
series of an arbitrary cDNA sample. The following
