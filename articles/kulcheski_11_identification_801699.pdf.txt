Abstract
Background: Small RNAs (19-24 nt) are key regulators of gene expression that guide both transcriptional and posttranscriptional silencing mechanisms in eukaryotes. Current studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs)
act in several plant pathways associated with tissue proliferation, differentiation, and development and in response
to abiotic and biotic stresses. In order to identify new miRNAs in soybean and to verify those that are possibly
water deficit and rust-stress regulated, eight libraries of small RNAs were constructed and submitted to Solexa
sequencing.
Results: The libraries were developed from drought-sensitive and tolerant seedlings and rust-susceptible and
resistant soybeans with or without stressors. Sequencing the library and subsequent analyses detected 256 miRNAs.
From this total, we identified 24 families of novel miRNAs that had not been reported before, six families of
conserved miRNAs that exist in other plants species, and 22 families previously reported in soybean. We also
observed the presence of several isomiRNAs during our analyses. To validate novel miRNAs, we performed RT-qPCR
across the eight different libraries. Among the 11 miRNAs analyzed, all showed different expression profiles during
biotic and abiotic stresses to soybean. The majority of miRNAs were up-regulated during water deficit stress in the
sensitive plants. However, for the tolerant genotype, most of the miRNAs were down regulated. The pattern of
miRNAs expression was also different for the distinct genotypes submitted to the pathogen stress. Most miRNAs
were down regulated during the fungus infection in the susceptible genotype; however, in the resistant genotype,
most miRNAs did not vary during rust attack. A prediction of the putative targets was carried out for conserved
and novel miRNAs families.
Conclusions: Validation of our results with quantitative RT-qPCR revealed that Solexa sequencing is a powerful
tool for miRNA discovery. The identification of differentially expressed plant miRNAs provides molecular evidence
for the possible involvement of miRNAs in the process of water deficit- and rust-stress responses.

Background
Small, non-coding RNAs have been characterized in
plants as important factors involved in gene expression
regulation in developmental processes [1,2], as well as
adaption to biotic and abiotic stress conditions [3,4]. In
general, small RNAs are grouped into two major classes:
microRNAs (miRNAs) and short-interfering RNAs

(siRNAs). These two classes of small RNAs cannot be
discriminated by either their chemical composition or
mechanism of action [5,6]. However, siRNAs and miRNAs can be distinguished by their origin, evolutionary
conservation and the types of genes that they silence
[5,6]. In this way, miRNAs are well differentiated due to
some particular characteristics. These characteristics
include the following: derived from genomic loci distinct
from other recognized genes, processed from transcripts
that can form local RNA hairpin structures, and usually,
miRNAs sequences are nearly always conserved in
related organisms [6,7].

In plants, MIRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II enzymes (Pol II) generating primary miRNA
(pri-miRNA). The pri-miRNA forms an imperfect foldback structure, which is processed into a stem-loop precursor (pre-miRNA) by nuclear RNaseIII-like enzymes
called DICER-LIKE proteins (e.g., DCL1) [8]. The resulting pre-miRNA contains a miRNA:miRNA* intermediate
duplex, formed by a self-complementary fold-back structure. A mature miRNA sequence can range from 19 to
24 nucleotides (nt) in length and act as a regulatory
molecule in post-transcriptional gene silencing by base
pairing with target mRNAs. This leads to mRNA cleavage or translational repression, depending on the
degree of complementarity between the miRNA and its
target transcript [6,9]. The same mature miRNA can
also present several variants of their sequence in length.
These populations of miRNA variants are called isomiRNAs, which are isoforms of microRNAs [10]. They are
caused by an imprecise or alternative cleavage of Dicer
during pre-miRNA processing [10]. IsomiRNAs have
been recently identified in both plants and animals
[10-12].
The first plant miRNAs were described in Arabidopsis
thaliana [13,14] and later in other species. Currently,
miRNAs have been reported in 41 plants species, and all
of their sequences have been deposited in a publiclyavailable miRNA database, miRBase (http://www.sanger.
ac.uk/cgi-bin/Rfam/mirna/browse.pl) [15-18]. Several
miRNAs have been identified in plants, and they are
characterized in a wide variety of metabolic and biological processes in plants with important functions in
development [19,20], phytohormone signaling [21], flowering and sex determination [22] and responses to biotic
and abiotic stresses [3,4,19,23-25].
In soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill), the major
legume crop worldwide, Subramanian et al. in 2008 [26]
identified 35 novel miRNA families for the first time. In
this study, the role of miRNAs in soybean-rhizobial
symbiosis was investigated [26]. During that same year,
Zhang et al. [27] used a comparative genome-based in
silico screening of soybean EST databases and quantitative PCR to provide evidence for 69 miRNAs belonging
to 33 families. A second study involving miRNAs and
soybean root nodules was performed by Wang and colleagues [28]. They identified 32 miRNAs belonging to
11 miRNA families. The identification of nine novel
miRNAs in wild soybean (Glycine soja) was also
reported by Chen et al. [29]. Another study looked at
four different soybean tissues (root, seed, flower and
nodule) and identified 87 novel soybean miRNAs [30].
Recently, Song and coworkers [31] identified 26 new
miRNAs and their related target genes from developing
soybean seeds. Although these studies resulted in a large
number of miRNAs identified in soybean, none of them

looked at microRNAs with respect to biotic and abiotic
stresses.
Drought is the major abiotic stress factor to negatively
affect soybean productivity around the world. The
impact of limited water during the flower formation can
cause shorter flowering periods [32,33], and water stress
during the later phases of soybean reproductive development has been reported to accelerate senescence, which
decreases the duration of the seed-filling period [32,33].
With regards to biotic stress, Asian soybean rust (ASR)
is a foliar disease caused by the fungus Phakopsora
pachyrhizi Sydow & Sydow. This pathogen presents a
rapid aerial spread and a high capacity to colonize leaf
tissue and, to a lesser extent, stem and pods [34]. ASR
is one of the most severe diseases on the soybean culture, which causes damage between 10% and 90% in the
different regions where it has been identified [35,36].
This disease is the main threat in soybean-producing
countries.
Currently, there are 203 miRNAs identified in Glycine
max (miRBase database, release 16, http://www.mirbase.
org/); however, none of these miRNAs were associated
with water deficit or ASR stress conditions. We consider
that the identification of these miRNAs is important to
understanding small RNA-mediated gene regulation in
soybean roots under water deficit stress and in leaves
during rust infection. In this context, our goal was to
identify new miRNAs and to discover those that may be
regulated by water deficit and soybean rust stress. Using
high-throughput sequencing, we constructed four
libraries of small RNAs from the roots of drought-sensitive and tolerant seedlings in response to control or
water deficit conditions. We also constructed four
libraries from leaves of rust-susceptible and resistant
seedlings with mock and infected conditions. A set of
eight small RNAs libraries was analyzed from soybean
plants. A total of 256 miRNAs were detected in Solexa
sequencing. We discovered 24 novel miRNAs families
and also detected several isomiRNAs in soybean. In our
RT-qPCR analysis, we verified that the expression profile
of several miRNAs varied during abiotic and biotic
stresses. This study has important implications for gene
regulation under water deficit and pathogen-infection
conditions and also contributes significantly to increase
the number of identified miRNAs in soybean.

Methods
Plant materials and treatments
Water deficit assay

For water deficit treatment, we used the soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) cultivars ‘Embrapa 48’ as a
drought-tolerant standard and ‘BR 16’ as a sensitive
standard [37]. Plants were grown in a greenhouse at
Embrapa-Soybean (Londrina, Brazil) using a hydroponic

system compound for plastic containers (30 liters) and
an aerated pH 6.6-balanced nutrient solution. Seeds
were pre-germinated on moist filter paper in the dark at
25°C ± 1°C and in 65% ± 5% relative humidity. Plantlets
were then placed in polystyrene supports so the roots of
the seedlings were completely immersed in the nutrient
solution. Each seedling tray was maintained in a greenhouse at 25°C ± 2°C and in 60% ± 5% relative humidity
under natural daylight (photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) = 1.5 × 10 3 μmoles m -2 s -1 , equivalent to
8.93 × 104 lux) for a 12 h day. After 15 days, seedlings
with the first trifoliate leaf fully developed (V2 developmental stage) [38] were submitted to different waterdeficit treatments according to Martins et al. [39]. The
nutrient solution was removed from each plastic container where the roots were kept in the tray in the dark
without nutrient solution or water for 0 minutes (T0 or
control), 125 minutes (T125) and 150 minutes (T150).
At the end of each water-deficit period, the roots of the
seedlings were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at -80°C until RNA extraction. The experimental design was a factorial (cultivars × duration of
water deficit) with three replicates. Each replicate was
composed of five plantlets that were sampled in bulk.
Four libraries of small RNAs were constructed for the
water deficit-stress assays from the following root tissues: 1) roots of drought-sensitive seedlings submitted
to 0 minutes of stress (Drought-Sensitive Root Control
(DSRC)); 2) roots of drought-sensitive seedlings submitted to 125 minutes and 150 minutes of stress
(Drought-Sensitive Root Treated (DSRT)); 3) roots from
drought-tolerant seedlings submitted to 0 minutes of
stress (Drought-Tolerant Root Control (DTRC)); and 4)
roots of drought-tolerant seedlings submitted to 125
minutes and 150 minutes of stress (Drought-Tolerant
Root Treated (DTRT)).
Asian Soybean Rust assay

The ASR reaction was evaluated in soybean plants in a
greenhouse at Embrapa-Soybean (Londrina, Brazil)
using a field population of Phakopsora pachyrhizi collected from soybean fields in the state of Mato Grosso,
which were maintained for over 10 generations on the
susceptible cv. BRSMS-Bacuri. ASR identification was
confirmed by ITS-sequencing analysis as described by
Silva et al. [40], and it revealed a similarity to the MUT
Zimbabwe isolate. The soybean plants were grown in a
pot-based system. The ‘Embrapa 48’ genotype was used
as a susceptible host plant, which develops a susceptible
lesion (TAN) after Phakopsora pachyrhizi infection. The
‘PI561356’ genotype was used as the resistant host,
which carries an ASR resistance gene mapped onto linkage group G (Ricardo V. Abdelnoor, personal communication) and develops a reddish-brown (RB) lesion with
few or no spores.

Urediniospores were collected from infected BRSMSBacuri plants in a separate greenhouse by tapping
infected leaves over a plastic tray. The urediniospores
were then diluted in distilled water with 0.05% Tween20 to a final concentration of 3 × 105 spores/mL. This
spore suspension was sprayed onto three plants per pot
at the V2 to V3 growth stages [38]. A solution without
the spores was used for the mock inoculations. Following the ASR or mock inoculations, water-misting bags
were placed over all plantlets for one day to aid the
infection process and to prevent cross-contamination of
the mock-infected plants. The third trifoliolate leaves of
six plants were collected 12 hours after inoculation (hai)
for RNA extraction. The experiment followed a completely randomized design with the three replicates as
blocks and a full factorial treatment structure consisting
of three treatment factors: hai (12 hours), genotype
(resistant or susceptible), and inoculation type (ASR or
mock).
For the rust-stress assay, we constructed the other
four libraries of small RNAs from leaves which were
compounded by: 1) leaves of rust-susceptible seedlings
with mock inoculation (Rust-Susceptible Leaf Control
(RSLC)); 2) leaves of rust-susceptible seedlings with
rust-spore inoculation (Rust-Susceptible Leaf Treated
(RSLT)); 3) leaves of rust-resistant seedlings with mock
inoculation (Rust-Resistant Leaf Control (RRLC)); and
4) leaves of rust-resistant seedlings with rust-spore
inoculation (Rust-Resistant Leaf Treated (RRLT)).
RNA extraction and sequencing

Total RNA was isolated from fresh leaves and root
materials using Trizol (Invitrogen, CA, USA), and the
RNA quality was evaluated by electrophoresis on a 1%
agarose gel. The amount of the RNA was verified using
a Quibit fluorometer and Quant-iT RNA assay kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen,
CA, USA). Total RNA ( > 10 μg) was sent to Fasteris
Life Sciences SA (Plan-les-Ouates, Switzerland) for processing and sequencing using Solexa technology on the
Illumina Genome Analyzer GAII. The libraries were
constructed from the eight bar-coded samples (DSRC,
DSRT, DTRC, DTRT, RSLC, RSLI, RRLC and RRLI)
sequenced in a total of two channels. Quality scores
were generated from Illumina’s data analysis pipeline,
which are similar to SAGE Phred scores with a maximum value of 40. Quality scores are based on the relative confidence of base calls using elements of cluster
generation and image quality. Briefly, the processing by
Illumina for the miRNA analyses consisted of the following successive steps: acrylamide gel purification of
the RNA bands corresponding to the size range 20-30
nt, ligation of the 3’ and 5’ adapters to the RNA in two
separate subsequent steps each followed by acrylamide

The reads were grouped into unique sequences, and the
read counts were calculated for each library. The
sequences that presented low read counts (read count <
= 2) were discarded from the final list of unique
sequences, which are referred to as a tag. The sequences
were mapped into the soybean genome (http://www.
phytozome.net) assembly using the SOAP program [41],
which returns information concerning the alignment
position, chromosome number and strand. No mismatches were allowed in the alignments. The tag alignment position’s upstream and downstream genomic
sequences (200 bp each) were extracted from the genome assembly using homemade Perl scripts. These
genomic regions were then aligned against the reverse
complement of its respective tag (rc-tag) using the
Smith-Waterman algorithm [42]. To ensure that these
pre-miRNA sequences could be precisely processed into
mature miRNA, the candidates were examined according the following criteria [43]: i) the miRNA and antisense miRNA should derive from the opposite stemarms and must be entirely within the arm of the hairpin;
ii) base-pairing between the miRNA and anti-sense
miRNA were restricted to four or fewer mismatches;
and iii) the frequency of asymmetric bulges was
restricted to less than one and the size should be less
than two bases. The genomic regions that were not possible to align the tag and rc-tag were discarded. Finally,
the genomic regions that were limited between the
alignment positions of the tag and rc-tag were considered as pre-microRNA candidates. From all the premicroRNA candidate sequences that we selected, only
the ones with no more than five matches to the soybean
genome were selected for analyzing the secondary structure using the RNA-folding program Mfold [44]. If a
perfect stem-loop structure was formed, the small RNA
sequence was at one arm of the stem, and the respective
anti-sense sequence was at the opposite arm; then, the
small RNA was consisted as a novel soybean miRNA.

new miRNA pertencing to conserved miRNAs families
in other plants species (MIR397ab); and four were miRNAs belonging to novel miRNAs families (MIR-Seq07,
MIR-Seq11, MIR-Seq13, MIR-Seq15ab). The forward
miRNAs primers were designed based on the full miRNAs sequence, and the reverse primer was the universal
reverse primer for miRNA [45]. The stem-loop primer,
used for miRNA cDNA synthesis, was designed according to Cheng et al. [45]. The stem-loop sequence consisted of 44 conserved and six variable nucleotides that
were specific to the 3’ end of the miRNA sequence (5’
GTCGTATCCAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTATTCGCACTGGATACGACNNNNNN 3’). The RT-qPCR was
performed in an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green I (Invitrogen)
to detect double-stranded cDNA synthesis. Reactions
were completed in a volume of 24 μL containing 12 μL
of diluted cDNA (1:50), 1X SYBR Green I (Invitrogen),
0.025 mM dNTP, 1X PCR Buffer, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.25 U
Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) and 200
nM of each reverse and forward primer. The universal
reverse primer (5’ GTGCAGGGTCCGAGGT 3’) was
used in all RT-qPCR reactions. Samples were analyzed
in biological triplicate in a 96-well plate, and a no-template control was included. We used MIR156b (5’TGACAGAAGAGAGAGAGCACA - 3’), MIR172ab (5’AGAATCTTGATGATGCTGCAT - 3’) and MIR1520d
(5’- ATCAGAACATGACACGTGACAA - 3’) as reference genes, which has been demonstrated as optimal
normalizers for water deficit and rust-stress analysis in
Glycine max [46]. The conditions were set as the following: an initial polymerase activation step for 5 minutes
at 94°C, 40 cycles for 15 seconds at 94°C for denaturation, 10 seconds at 60°C for annealing and 25 seconds
at 72°C for elongation. A melting curve analysis was
programmed at the end of the PCR run over the range
65-99, increasing the temperature stepwise by 0.4°C.
Threshold and baselines were manually determined
using the ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System SDS Software v2.0. To calculate the relative expression of the
miRNAs, we used the 2 -ΔΔCt method. Student’s t-test
was performed to compare pair-wise differences in
expression. The parameters of two-tailed distribution
and two samples assuming unequal variances were
established. The means were considered significantly different when P < 0.05.

miRNA validation and expression analysis by RT-qPCR

Prediction of miRNA targets

To validate predicted new miRNAs, RT-qPCR in respect
to eleven miRNAs was performed to examine their
expression across the eight different libraries. From
those, six were new miRNAs belonging to conserved
soybean miRNAs families (MIR166a-5p, MIR166f,
MIR169f-3p, MIR482bd-3p, MIR1513c, MIR4415b); one

Target prediction for miRNAs is straightforward because
it is assumed that most of them match their targets with
almost perfect complementarity [8,9]. The putative target genes for all miRNAs identified were searched for by
using the web-based computer psRNA Target Server
(http://biocomp5.noble.org/psRNATarget/) [47] which

gel purification, (3) cDNA synthesis followed by acrylamide gel purification, and a final step of PCR amplification to generate cDNA colonies template library for
Illumina sequencing. After removing the adapter
sequences, the sequences were trimmed into different
read lengths from 19 to 24 nt for further analysis.
Prediction of miRNAs

can identify putative targets that may be regulated at
post-transcriptional or at translational levels. Mature
miRNA sequences were used as queries to search for
potential target mRNAs in the Glycine max database
(DFCI gene index release 15). The total scoring for an
alignment was calculated based on the miRNA length,
and the sequences were considered to be miRNA targets
if the total score were less than 3.0 points (mismatch =
1 and G:U = 0.5). Results from these analyses were individually inspected on the Phytozome, where the loci and
protein annotation were obtained. In order to look for
evidences of the predicted targets of the novel identified
miRNA, we searched for the miRNA targets sites in the
soybean degradome libraries published by Song et al.
[31] available under NCBI-GEO accession nμ.
GSE25260. Finally, all putative targets regulated by soybean new miRNAs which were analyzed by RT-qPCR
were subjected to AgriGO database to investigate the
gene ontology [48].

Results
To identify miRNAs from soybean under water deficit
and rust stresses, we generated eight libraries of small
RNAs species. From these libraries, a total of 256 miRNAs ranged from 19 to 24 nt-long sequence sizes were
identified (Table 1). All pre-miRNA sequence candidates
that were selected by the parameters stipulated during
the miRNA prediction and those that had no more than
five matches on the soybean genome were folded using
the Mfold program. All miRNA sequences with the
respective precursor sequence originating at a hairpin
structure were submitted to the miRBase to determine if
they were a new or known miRNA. We separated the
results of these miRNAs according the following classes:
novel miRNAs belonging to miRNAs families never
detected before (29 miRNAs); new miRNAs belonging
to conserved miRNA families in other plants species
detected for the first time in soybean (15 miRNAs);
miRNAs belonging to conserved miRNA soybean
families (71 miRNAs); different isoforms of new and
known miRNAs (121 isoforms); and known miRNAs
already deposited into the miRBase database (20 miRNAs) (Table 1).

Identification of novel miRNAs from soybean

A total of 29 new miRNAs belonging to 24 novel
families (Table 2) were identified by Solexa sequencing
in libraries from water deficit and rust infections of Glycine max. These families were provisory nominated
Seq01 to Seq25 (Table 2). The precursor miRNA
sequences varied from 55 to 239 nt in length. Precursors
of these novel miRNAs were identified, and they formed
proper secondary hairpin structures, with MFEs ranging
from -16.50 to -153.80 kcal/mol (Additional file 1). The
most abundant mature miRNAs were 21 nt in length.
We also evaluated the genomic location of the new
miRNAs (Table 2). Of the 29 new miRNAs genes identified in soybean, around 86% (25) were located in intergenic regions and the rest were situated inside genes.
The mature miRNAs sequences were localized inside
the stem-loop sequence with almost half in each arm:
17 miRNAs were localized in the 3’ arm and 12 miRNAs
were in the 5’ arm. More than 63% of the pre-miRNA
sequences were in the same sense direction (+) as the
soybean genome annotation. For all 24 novel families
identified, four were compounded by miRNAs provided
from two loci, and we detected only one miRNA member for the rest. Sense and anti-sense miRNAs were
detected only in one family, the Seq10, and both were
nominated according the arm localization (3p or 5p).
Most of the new mature miRNA sequences presented a
uracil (U) as their first nucleotide, which is in agreement
with previous results for soybean root sequences [26].
Identification of homologues miRNAs of other plant
species

To determine whether any of the miRNAs identified in
our libraries were conserved among other plant species,
we searched miRBase for homologues. Besides the novel
families identified, we also detected 15 miRNAs belonging to six conserved families in other plants species
(Table 3). The families MIR170, MIR395, MIR397,
MIR408, MIR2118 and MIR3522 were detected for the
first time in soybean. For families MIR170 and
MIR3522, only a single locus was identified, and for
MIR408, three genes were found. In two families,
MIR408 and MIR2118, we detected sense and antisense

miRNAs (Table 3). MIR170 was only conserved in Arabidopsis lyrata and Arabidopsis thaliana. MIR408 was
found in more different plants species than the other
families. It was found in 17 species: Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus trichocarpa, Pinus taeda, Vitis vinifera,
Arachis hypogaea, Arabidopsis lyrata, Citrus sinensis,
Oryza sativa, Saccharum officinarum, Zea mays, Physcomitrella patens, Selaginella moellendorffii, Triticum aestivum, Sorghum bicolor, Brachypodium distachyon,
Ricinus communis and Aquilegia coerulea (Table 3). We
observed two families (MIR2118 and MIR3522) to be
conserved between Glycine max and Glycine soja; however, we expect that more miRNA families could be
conserved between these species considering that they
are closely related. This low number is probably due to
Glycine soja showing fewer miRNAs identified to date.
Identification of conserved soybean miRNAs

To identify conserved soybean miRNAs, all 256
sequences were searched using BLASTn against the soybean miRNAs in miRBase. We identified 22 families of
conserved soybean miRNAs in our libraries. Only 20
miRNA soybean genes that were registered in the miRBase were observed (indicated by the number five in
Table 1). From the remaining 71 miRNA genes, 12 were
miRNAs antisense (in the opposite arm) to the miRNAs
presents in miRBase (indicated as group four in Table
4), and 59 were new members detected from new loci of
known families (indicated by number three in Table 4).
Of the 12 miRNAs identified from the opposite strand
of previously known miRNAs, six were in the 5’ arm
and six in the 3’arm. For the 59 new members of conserved soybean families, 45 miRNAs were 21 nt in
length. The family with the largest number of new
miRNA genes (nine genes) was MIR319 (Table 4). Interestingly, in family MIR166, we found three new members with sense and antisense miRNAs. Also, in
MIR159, two new genes with sequences originated from
both the 3’and 5’arms were identified. One new gene
was detected in MIR169, MIR172, MIR396 and MIR482
with mature sequences originated from both the 3’and
5’arms (Table 4). Similar to the observation for the
novel soybean miRNAs (Table 2), the new genes in
these conserved soybean families were compounded for
a majority of mature miRNAs with a uracil as the first
nucleotide in the 5’ end.
Identification of miRNAs isoforms

Isoforms of microRNAs (isomiRNAs) are a population
of known miRNA variants. They are caused by an
imprecise or alternative cleavage of Dicer during premiRNA processing [10]. We detected numerous
miRNAs with additional nucleotides in the 5’or 3’ terminus compared to the recorded mature miRNAs. As

Page 7 of 17

isomiRNAs were previously reported in soybean highthroughput sequencing [31], we found 121 isomiRNAs
in our libraries (Table 5). These isoforms were observed
in 22 conserved miRNA families and in four novel
families. These miRNA isoforms occurred in both
strands from the 5’ or 3’ arm. The conserved MIR1507a
and MIR1507b were found with the most isomiRNAs
detected (eight isoforms each). MIR1507a showed a variation of three nucleotides in the 5’end and six nucleotides in the 3’end, and MIR1507b showed a variation of
three and five nucleotides in the 5’and 3’ terminal region
respectively (Table 5). From the novel miRNAs identified, the MIR-Seq07 was the read with the most isoforms detected in our sequencing. This miRNA
presented a total of 14 different sequences with 14 varying nucleotides in both the 5’and 3’ ends from six fixed
nucleotides (Table 5). All isoforms and their respective
nominated mature miRNAs can be found in Additional
File 1.
Validation of miRNAs validation and expression profile by
RT-qPCR

The stem-loop RT-qPCR was used to validate and
measure the expression of the respective miRNAs:
MIR166a-5p, MIR166f, MIR169f-3p, MIR397ab,
MIR482bd-3p, MIR1513c, MIR4415b, MIR-Seq07, MIRSeq11, MIR-Seq13 and MIR-Seq15ab, detected by
Solexa sequencing. These miRNAs were validated in all
genotypes analyzed during dehydration and rust stress.
The relative expressions of these miRNAs in the same
eight conditions are shown in Figure 1.
Expression patterns of miRNAs during water deficit

To identify water deficit-responsive miRNAs, we compared the expression profiles of the 11 miRNAs in both
genotypes before and after stress (Figure 1A). A set of
five different miRNAs (MIR166-5p, MIR169f-3p,
MIR1513c, MIR397ab and MIR-Seq13) presented the
same behavior during the water deficit stress. These
miRNAs were commonly up-regulated during the stress
condition in the sensitive genotype, and the opposite
occur in the tolerant genotype, where they were downregulated during the water deficit. MIR-Seq11 and MIRSeq15 demonstrated a similar expression across the four
conditions. Water deficit significantly increased MIRSeq11 and MIR-Seq15 expression in the roots compared
to the control condition in the sensitive genotype, but
both miRNAs did not vary in the tolerant plants.
MIR166f had its level increased in the sensitive genotype
and decreased in the tolerant during the stress compared to the control situation. Interestingly, both genotypes presented the same level during the control
condition. In the sensitive plants, MIR-482bd-3p showed
a strong decrease when submitted to water deficit, being
this low level equally observed in the tolerant genotype

its expression level during the water deficit in the sensitive plants, and its high level was also observed in the
tolerant genotype independent of the condition. Both
sensitive and tolerant genotype exhibited the same

expression pattern for MIR-Seq07 and its level was
increased during the stress compared to the control
situation.

Figure 1 Effects of biotic and abiotic stresses on miRNA relative expression evaluated by RT-qPCR. A) Comparative analyses of four
libraries from the water deficit experiment. For the water deficit-stress assay, the four libraries were named as: DSRC (drought-sensitive seedlings
root submitted to 0 minutes of stress); DSRT (drought-sensitive seedlings root submitted to 125 minutes and 150 minutes of stress); DTRC
(drought-tolerant seedlings root submitted to 0 minutes of stress) and DTRT (drought-tolerant seedlings root submitted to 125 minutes and 150
minutes of stress). B) Comparative analyses of four libraries from the rust infection experiment. For the rust-stress assay, the four libraries were
named as: RSLC (rust-susceptible seedlings leaves mock inoculation); RSLI (rust-susceptible seedlings leaves with rust-spore inoculation); RRLC
(rust-resistant seedlings leaves with mock inoculation) and RRLT (rust-resistant seedlings leaves with rust-spore inoculation). Samples that
significantly differs (P < 0.05) according to a Students t-test statistical analysis, were label as: “*” effective differences between cultivars in control
conditions; “a” effective differences between control and stressed conditions for sensitive or susceptible plants; “b” effective differences between
control and stressed conditions for tolerant or resistant plants and “1” when an effective difference was also observed between sensitive or
susceptible and tolerant or resistant under stress conditions.

Kulcheski et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:307

expression analyses revealed that MIR166a-5p, MIR166f,
MIR169-3p, MIR397ab and MIR-Seq13 were dow-regulated in the susceptible genotype during pathogen infection, and equally expressed in the resistant plants. The
level of MIR482bd-3p did not vary significantly between
the two different conditions in the susceptible. However
in the resistant genotype, its level is higher during the
control condition and decrease with the pathogen
attack. MIR1513c presented unchangeable expression in
the control and stressed condition for both genotypes,
but when we compared the two genotypes; the resistant
was down-regulated compared to the susceptible. A
strong decrease was observed for MIR4415b in the rust
infection when compared with the control in the susceptible plants, and its level is higher in the resistant
genotype showing no expression alteration between the
conditions. MIR-Seq07 was down-regulated with respect
to the soybean rust infection in both genotypes. Significant difference was observed in MIR-Seq11 expression
between the mock and infected plants from the susceptible genotypes. This miRNA presented a low expression
level after rust inoculation, and its level decreased in the
resistant genotypes remaining similar in the both conditions. MIR-Seq15ab expression level was significantly
decreased in the rust compared to the mock treatment
in the susceptible genotype, the opposite occurs in the
resistant genotype, when the control showed a lower
level of expression compared to the stressed condition.
Target prediction of the soybean miRNAs

MiRNAs suppress gene expression by inhibiting translation, promoting mRNA decay or both [9]. Target gene
identification is challenging due to many factors including the following: binding to their target mRNAs by partial complementarity over a short sequence, suppression
of an individual target genes is often small, and targeting
rules are not completely understood. We predicted the
potential miRNAs targets in the psRNA database using
all identified miRNAs as queries. The results of the analysis were divided into two tables, showing the targets
predicted for the novel (Table 6) and for the conserved
miRNAs families (Additional file 2).
Among the 24 novel identified miRNAs families, only
14 families had targets predicted (Table 6). The miRNAs
families MIR-Seq01, MIR-Seq03, MIR-Seq06, MIRSeq07, MIR-Seq08, MIR-Seq12 and MIR-Seq13 had
multiple distinct targets. MIR-Seq10, MIR-Seq15 and
MIR-Seq18 targeted only one locus. Although, MIRSeq05, MIR-Seq11, MIR-Seq16 and MIR-Seq19 presented several loci as targets, all of them are coding for
the same proteins. Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, LRR
(leucine-rich-repetitions)-containing proteins, translation
elongation factor were predicted to be potential targets
of the novel MIR-Seq07 which was investigated by RT-

Page 12 of 17

qPCR. The search for a target of the novel MIR-Seq11,
also analyzed by RT-qPCR, showed a match to Glycine
max peroxidase precursors mRNAs as potential targets.
The oxidoreductase and a transcription regulator factor
were predicted to be targeted by MIR-Seq13; and for
the MIR-Seq15 only a translation initiator factor was
predicted as a target.
After a comparative analysis of our novel identified
miRNAs and the degradome libraries of developing soybean seeds it was possible to identify specific sequences
in the degradome that corresponds to the downstream
sequence of the predicted miRNA recognition site. We
identified target sequences to six among the 24 novel
soybean miRNAs (MIR-Seq01, MIR-Seq 06, MIR-Seq07,
MIR-Seq11, MIR-Seq12 and MIR-Seq16). The list of the
10 identified genes is composed by a glucosyl transferase, serine carboxypeptidase, fructose biphosphate aldolase, three leucine-rich repeat protein, two peroxidases
and two ATP dependent RNA helicases (Additional file
3).
Although many soybean conserved miRNAs targets
have been predicted and validated by previous studies
[26,27,30,31], we also investigated the possible targets
for the 28 known families of miRNAs detected in our
sequencing. Of these, only 21 families had predicted targets and they are listed in the Additional file 2. The
conserved miRNA families showed multiples targets,
however families MIR156, MIR172, MIR396, MIR397,
MIR1510 and MIR1513 were highly conserved about
their targets. For example, all members from the
MIR156 family (which had a predicted target) targeted
SBP (squamosa promoter binding)-domain protein. AP
(2) APETALA 2 transcription factors were targeted by
MIR172 family. The same occur with MIR396, MIR397,
MIR1510 and MIR1513 families that targeted various
genes families as GRF (growth regulating factor) transcription factor, multicopper oxidases, LRR (leucinerich-repetitions)-containing proteins and F-BOX domain
proteins respectively. These results were already
observed across several plant species (except for
MIR1510 and MIR1513) [25,49-53].
Gene Ontology analysis

The targets of those miRNAs which the expression was
analyzed by RT-qPCR were also investigated in respect
to their gene ontology (GO) [48]. Among the 11
miRNA genes, six presented target predictions, which
were: MIR397ab, MIR1513c, MIR-Seq07, MIR-Seq11,
MIR-Seq13 and MIR-Seq15ab. The putative soybean
miRNAs targets presented diverse functions, however
the most representative group was the proteins involved
in oxidoreductase activity followed by the proteins
involved in the catabolic process (Figure 2). The result
demonstrates that more than 76% of the target proteins

are involved in oxidoreductase activity is consistent with
the fact that some of the miRNAs libraries are originated from stressed plants. A consequence of many
environmental stresses - including water deficit and
pathogen attack - is a oxidative stress, i. e. the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which damage
cellular structures [49,54]. As miRNAs MIR397, MIRSeq11 and MIR-Seq13 were predicted to match proteins
with oxidative activity, they may act in some level of
regulation during water deficit or ASR stress.

Discussion
The use of deep-sequencing technology was efficient to
identify 256 miRNAs of Glycine max. These miRNAs
were identified from eight different libraries from precursors with stem-loop secondary structures that also
map to the soybean genome (Additional file 1). They
were detected from water deficit and rust libraries and
were characterized as following: detected for the first
time, already detected in some plant species, conserved
in soybean, or a variant of a known miRNA (isoform).

Figure 2 Go analysis of miRNAs target genes. Blue bars indicate the enrichment of miRNA targets in GO terms. Green bars indicate the
percentage of total annotated soybean genes mapping to GO terms. Only the predicted target genes for miRNAs analyzed by RT-qPCR were
considered.

From these analyses, we found 24 novel families that
had not been detected before, six families that had
already been detected in Coniferophytes, Embryophytes
and Magnoliophytes (dicotyledons and monocotyledons), and 22 conserved soybean families. In terms of
conserved soybean miRNAs, we only detected 20 known
miRNAs in our sequencing. This small number of
known miRNA genes detected in our libraries could be
due to the two filters used in our processing. These filters may have missed some known, conserved soybean
miRNAs because they discarded reads with low frequency and those with more than five matches in the
genome.
We detected 121 miRNAs with additional nucleotides
in the 3’ or 5’ terminus compared to the recorded
mature miRNA. These miRNA variants (isomiRNAs)
were very common in our population of small, detected
RNAs. Out of the isomiRNAs, we observed 21 pairs of
sense and antisense miRNAs. The duplex presents the
antisense strand paired to the corresponding miRNA
with two nucleotides 3’ overhangs (Additional file 1).
This shows that the sense and antisense miRNAs

originated from DCL1 processing and supports their
validation as true miRNAs [26,55,56].
In addition, we validated the conserved miRNAs in
our libraries based on homology to known miRNAs in
miRBase. The phylogenetic conservation of miRNA
sequences is one rule proposed by Ambros et al. [7] to
characterize miRNAs. In this study, we established new
miRNAs in soybean that were already detected in other
plants species. However, as opposed to some studies
that only blast the candidate to the known miRNA
mature sequence, our identifications were determined
by precursor sequence folding and verification of the
genuine hairpin structures.
The complexity of the plant response to biotic and
abiotic stresses involves many genes and biochemical
and molecular mechanisms, and adaptation to these
stresses is achieved through regulating gene expression
at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.
With regard to post-transcriptional regulation, miRNAs
are associated with water deficit response in others
plants, but this was the first time that differential
expression of these small RNAs were observed in

Kulcheski et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:307
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/307

soybean during water deficit. In order to validate 11 of
the novel miRNAs detected in sequencing by the RTqPCR method, we constructed primers stem-loop and
analyzed their expression during abiotic and biotic stresses (Figure 1). We observed that several miRNAs were
up-regulated during the water deficit in the sensitive
genotype (Figure 1A). However, during the same stress,
these miRNAs had a different expression in the tolerant
genotype. This distinct miRNAs behavior between the
two contrasting genotypes under the same conditions
could be involved with the drought-tolerance that is
observed in the tolerant genotype. One of these miRNAs
with this expression pattern is the new MIR-Seq11.
Interestingly, MIR-Seq11 was predicted to target peroxidase protein. As known, stress conditions can produce
excess concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
resulting in oxidative damage at the cellular level [57].
The increase of this miRNA in the sensitive genotype,
when subjected to water deficit, could be one of the factors associated with vulnerability of these sensitive
plants. Whereas in tolerant genotype during the two
conditions, the expression levels of MIR-Seq11 are
lower than in the sensitive cultivar during stress. This
situation could indicate that the unchangeable MIRSeq11 levels in the tolerant genotype may be related to
its drought-tolerance capacity.
Another interesting point is the expression of a novel
miRNA MIR-Seq07 that showed increased expression
levels during the water deficit stress for both genotypes.
This result allows us to associate this miRNA with
water deficit stress mechanism independently of the
genotype background. Our computational approach
showed that one of the loci targeted by MIR-Seq07 corresponds to a fructose-bipfosphato-aldolase enzyme
which is a constituent of both the glycolytic/gluconeogenic pathway and the pentose phosphate cycle in plants
[58]. Therefore increase and/or activation of aldolase
appear to be implicated in the plant growth mainly
through promotion of the glycolytic pathway function to
synthesize ATP [58]. Since, MIR-Seq07 expression was
increased during the stress condition in both genotypes
and assuming that it can inhibit or degrade aldolases, it
could be associated to metabolism decreasing during
water deficit in roots.
Plants possess several adaptive traits to support pathogen attacks. In Glycine max, ASR is responsible for significant losses in soybean growth areas. Nevertheless, no
study investigating miRNAs and ASR disease had been
preformed to date. To determine if miRNAs act as key
factors during rust infection or for resistance maintenance, we performed expression analyses with the same
11 miRNAs during mock and infected conditions in two
different genotypes (Figure 1B). In general the miRNAs

Page 15 of 17

under the fungus infection were down-regulated in the
susceptible genotype (except MIR482bd-3p). For example, MIR-Seq11, MIR-Seq13 and MIR-Seq15 which had
predicted peroxidases, oxidoreductases and translational
initiation factor respectively as targets proteins, were
down regulated when infected with ASR. The peroxidases enzymes help to metabolize H2O2 in higher plants,
and these proteins, as also others proteins with oxidoreductase activity, have already been reported to be upregulated after pathogen infection and especially after
ASR [57], indicating a possible involvement of MIRSeq11 and MIR-Seq13 with the responses to ASR infection. Considering, that a translational initiator factor
was predicted to be targeted by MIR-Seq15, we could
speculate about the participation of this miRNA in the
protein synthesis machinery.
In the resistant plants, most of the miRNAs analyzed
by RT-qPCR (except MIR482bd-3p, MIR-Seq07, MIRSeq15ab) did not vary across the mock and rust infection. Surprisingly, MIR-Seq07 was the unique miRNA
that was down-regulated during the fungi infection for
both genotypes analyzed in our study. We already mentioned that the MIR-Seq07 had predicted protein target
related to metabolism and thus its possible association
with water stress. However MIR-Seq07 also had predicted LRRs (leucine-rich repeats)-domain target which
are known to be present in disease resistance proteins
[59,60]. This suggested a good candidate for the investigation of the miRNAs’ regulatory mechanisms during
ASR stress. Although we investigated the expression
patterns of some miRNAs detected in our sequencing
and predicted the target genes that it regulates, additional experimental approaches must be addressed to
confirm these hypotheses.

Conclusions
The present study detected a large number of small
RNA sequences that were characterized as novel and as
already known soybean miRNAs. We grouped some of
these unique sequences into 24 novel soybean miRNAs
and further classified several of new members in known
families or as new loci in the soybean genome. Validation of new miRNA with quantitative RT-qPCR revealed
that Solexa sequencing is a powerful tool for miRNA
discovery. Many miRNA expression patterns were upor down-regulated by water deficit and rust stresses,
which is an important discovery. Future investigations
should use supplementary experimental approaches to
verify the targets and to understand the complex gene
regulatory network of these miRNAs. This work will
contribute to improve systems to support soybean crop
production and to mitigating crop losses during biotic
or abiotic stresses.
