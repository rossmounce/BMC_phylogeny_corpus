Tracing the legacy of the early Hainan Islandersa perspective from mitochondrial DNA

Abstract
Background: Hainan Island is located around the conjunction of East Asia and Southeast Asia, and during the Last
Glacial Maximum (LGM) was connected with the mainland. This provided an opportunity for the colonization of
Hainan Island by modern human in the Upper Pleistocene. Whether the ancient dispersal left any footprints in the
contemporary gene pool of Hainan islanders is debatable.
Results: We collected samples from 285 Li individuals and analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variations of
hypervariable sequence I and II (HVS-I and II), as well as partial coding regions. By incorporating previously reported
data, the phylogeny of Hainan islanders was reconstructed. We found that Hainan islanders showed a close
relationship with the populations in mainland southern China, especially from Guangxi. Haplotype sharing analyses
suggested that the recent gene flow from the mainland might play important roles in shaping the maternal pool of
Hainan islanders. More importantly, haplogroups M12, M7e, and M7c1* might represent the genetic relics of the
ancient population that populated this region; thus, 14 representative complete mtDNA genomes were further
sequenced.
Conclusions: The detailed phylogeographic analyses of haplogroups M12, M7e, and M7c1* indicated that the early
peopling of Hainan Island by modern human could be traced back to the early Holocene and/or even the late
Upper Pleistocene, around 7 - 27 kya. These results correspond to both Y-chromosome and archaeological studies.

Background
Hainan Island, the second largest island of China, is
located in the Beibu Bay (Gulf of Tonkin) and separated
from Guangdong’s Leizhou Peninsula to the north by the
Qiongzhou Strait (Figure 1). During the Last Glacial
Maximum (LGM), around 19 - 26.5 kya (thousand years
ago) [1], Hainan Island was connected with mainland
southern China and northern Vietnam, as the sea level
was around 80 - 100 m below present day [2,3]. Thus,
Hainan Island might lay on one of the modern human
northward migration routes from Southeast Asia to East
Asia and it is likely that Hainan islanders may maintain
certain ancient footprints of these dispersals [4]. This
scenario has been supported by some recent archaeological evidence, which suggested that Hainan Island might

have been colonized by human in the Upper Pleistocene
or the Upper Paleolithic period [5-8].
Due to the post-glacial sea level rising and the formation of the Qiongzhou Strait, Hainan Island has been
isolated from the mainland for at least 6 thousand years
[3,9]. Presently, Hainan Island is home to people with
many different languages and/or cultures. Compared
with other ethnic/linguistic groups (e.g. Lingao, Han,
and Hmong) - the recent immigrants from mainland
southern China [10], Li (Hlai) people were suggested to
be the earliest settlers, having arrived in Hainan Island
at least 3 kya [11]. In terms of linguistic analyses, the
Hlai language, used by the Li people was suggested to
split from other languages within the Tai-Kadai (Daic)
family ~ 3 - 4 kya [12]. Meanwhile, some current Li
populations still maintain some ancient cultures of the
Neolithic, e.g. bark cloth and original ceramic making
[10]. Therefore, colonization of Hainan Island by the
ancestors of the Li people can be at least traced back to
the Neolithic period (~ 2 - 6 kya) [11,13]. However,
whether the ancestor of the modern human had settled

work [30], we collected new samples from 285 Li individuals. With comprehensive phylogeographic analyses
based on complete mtDNA genomes sequencing, we
identified some potential candidate markers for the early
peopling of Hainan Island, which could be traced back to
~ 7 - 27 kya.

in this region in the Upper Pleistocene and contributed
to the gene pool of modern Li populations in Hainan
Island is unclear.
To depict the prehistoric peopling events in this region,
human genetic approaches based on the uniparental
genetic systems - mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the
nonrecombining region of the Y chromosome (NRY) have been widely adopted [14]. By analyzing the dominant NRY haplogroups (paragroups) O1a* and O2a* in
Hainan aborigines (five Li populations and one Cun
population), Li et al. suggested that Hainan aborigines
had been isolated at the entrance to East Asia for ~ 20
thousand years [4]. However, because of the relatively
poor resolution of phylogeny based on limited numbers
of Y-SNPs, the candidate founders of the ancient dispersal were still ambiguous. Moreover, in their later work
about O1a*, wide connections among the populations
around the Beibu Bay (i.e. Guangxi and Hainan) and
other populations from southern China and Southeast
Asia were observed [15]. This implies that the effect of
some recent gene flows between Hainan islanders and
the populations in the mainland could not be ignored.
In this study, we adopted mtDNA analyses to trace the
ancient peopling of Hainan Island in a maternal perspective, because: 1) the phylogeny of mtDNA in context of
East Asian and Southeast Asian has been improved
thanks to large scale complete mtDNA genome sequencing [16-28]; 2) mtDNA data of many ethnic/linguistic
groups in the neighboring regions of Hainan Island (i.e.
southern China [29-36] and northern Vietnam [23,37])
have been reported. Given that the maternal structures of
the Li populations were poorly characterized in previous

Hypervariable sequence (HVS) analysis and partial coding region testing indicated that all mtDNA lineages of
the 285 Li individuals were unambiguously assigned into
the previously defined haplogroups in East and Southeast
Asians (see Additional file 1). The predominant haplogroups in southern China and Southeast Asia: haplogroups B, F, and M7 together account for ~ 69%, 71%,
and 63% of the maternal gene pools of the populations
Li-BT, Li-LD, and Li-QZ, respectively (Table 1). The prevailing haplogroups in northern China, such as haplogroups A, D4, G, and Z, were rare or even absent in the
three Li populations. Meanwhile, the previously reported
162 sequences from five populations (Li-TZ, Jiamao,
Cun, Danga, and Lingao) in Hainan Island [30] were reevaluated and incorporated into further analyses. The
skeleton of the resulting phylogeny of 447 individuals
from Hainan Island was constructed (Figure 2). The
mtDNA haplogroups profiles of the Hainan islanders
were similar to the patterns observed in the populations
from the mainland southern China and northern Vietnam (Table 1). However, haplogroups M12 and M7e had
higher frequencies (~ 6.3% and ~ 4.5%, respectively) in
the Hainan islanders than those of the populations in the
mainland, whose average were less than 1%.
Comparison of the Hainan islanders with other
populations in the mainland

To compare the Hainan Islanders with other populations
in the mainland (see Additional file 2), the principal components (PC) analysis based on haplogroup frequencies
(see Additional file 3) was performed (Figure 3). In the
first PC, some Sinitic populations (Han-DG, HK, Hakka,
and Chaoshan) clustered in one pole. In the other pole,
except Lingao and Danga, most Hainan islanders were
clustered with some populations from Guangxi, which
were distinguished from the other populations in the
mainland by the second PC. The genetic difference
between Hainan islanders and populations from the
mainland was statistically significant (p < 0.001, Analysis
of molecular variance, AMOVA), whereas the difference
between the Li populations (Li-BT, Li-LD, Li-QZ, Li-TZ,
and Jiamao) and non-Li populations (Cun, Danga, and
Lingao) was not (p = 0.147 ± 0.010, AMOVA). Then, we
used the regression method to estimate the contribution
of each haplogroup to the PCs [38]. The haplogroups

Figure 2 Tree drawn from a median-joining network of 180 mtDNA haplotypes observed in Hainan Island. mtDNA motifs of HVS-I
(16080-16488) combined with HVS-II and/or certain coding region sites were considered to improve the resolution of the tree which was
constructed manually and checked by using the Network 4.510. The circles represent mtDNA sequence types, shaded according to population
with an area proportional to their absolute frequency. The geographic sources of populations were also noted. These are transitions while
suffixes A, C, G and T refer to transversions, “Y” specifies heteroplasmic status C/T at the site, and “@” means a reverse mutation. Seven
haplotypes were determined as the existing of heteroplasmic sites.

Figure 3 Principle components analysis (PCA) of populations in southern China and Vietnam. The detailed information of 50 populations
employed and their haplogroup profiles was indicated in Additional file 2 and 3.

M12, M7e, M7b1, M7c*, and B4b1 were found to contribute most to the pole consisting of Hainan islanders and
the populations from Guangxi (Figure 4).
Dissection of mtDNA haplotypes in Hainan Island

To analyze mtDNA variation at a finer level, we dissected the haplotype information mainly based on HVSI segment 16080 - 16488 (Figure 2). In general, the Hainan Island populations showed fairly high haplotype
diversities compared with Taiwan aborigines or other
populations from the mainland (Table 1). Some haplotypes were shared by the Li and non-Li populations
within Hainan Island. In total of 178 haplotypes (16090
- 16365) observed in Hainan islanders, 80 types could
be found the identical counterparts in the mainland (see
Additional file 4). In addition, the median-joining networks of the most frequent haplogroups (B4b1, B5a,
F1a1, R9b, and M7b1) were unable to identify candidate
founder types which were suitable to date the related
peopling of Hainan Island (see Additional file 5).
For the rest of the three haplogroups (i.e. M12, M7e,
and M7c*) contributing most to the pole of Hainan islanders in PCA (Figure 4), some interesting patterns were
observed. With HVS-I motifs as 16223-16234-16258T16290, 16189-16223-16278 and 16166C-16172-1622316311, three lineages assigned within haplogroups M12,
M7c* and M7e, respectively, were restricted in Hainan

Island. Meanwhile, the lineages of 16223-16234-16258T16290 and 16166C-16172-16223-16311 underwent certain sub-differentiation to generate the derived lineages
(Figure 2). Moreover, haplogroups M12, M7c* and M7e
were more concentrated in the Li populations than those
in other non-Li populations (Table 1). Hence, this implies
that the three haplogroups might be useful to trace the
early peopling of Hainan Island.
Candidate markers for the early peopling of Hainan
Island

As the available phylogeny of haplogroups M12, M7e,
and M7c* has not been well depicted at a fine-grained
level, we sequenced 14 complete mtDNA genomes: eleven from haplogroup M12, two from haplogroup M7e
and one from haplogroup M7c* (Figure 5). The phylogeny of haplogroup M12 was much improved compared
to previous work [20,39]. As the result of the earliest
split, haplogroup M12b was defined by mutations
11359-16129-16172 and haplogroup M12a was determined by 318-12358. Within haplogroup M12a, haplogroup M12a2 was newly determined by two sequences
from Vietnam as sharing mutations 463-16261 and C
insertion at 573. Haplogroup M12a1 was defined by the
sequence variation motif in HVS-II as 125-127-128 and
then was further divided into two clades as M12a1a and
M12a1b. All sequences from Hainan Island were

clustered with the sequences from Guangdong and Vietnam into haplogroup M12a1a defined by transitions
15463-15651. The unique lineage of Hainan islanders
with HVS-I motif as 16223-16234-16258T-16290 was
derived directly from the root of M12a1a suggesting
that the modern human colonization of Hainan Island
was likely to be associated with the differentiation of
M12a1a around 17 - 20 kya.
To characterize the phylogeographic pattern of haplogroup M12, the median-joining network was constructed with all available M12 mtDNAs (Figure 6; see
Additional file 6). Haplogroup M12 was widely distributed in southern China, Southeast Asia and the eastern
part of India, but relatively concentrated in Yunnan and
Hainan Island (Figure 6). The network suggested haplogroup M12 was likely to originate from mainland
southern China and Southeast Asia. The estimated
expansion time of M12a1*, which includes the lineages

from Hainan Island, was 24.2 ± 10.0 kya. The expansion
of M12a1-16362 lineages in Hainan Island was estimated as 6.9 ± 3.4 kya. The results were largely in
agreement with the results from the complete mtDNA
genomes (Figure 5). The two ages would be considered
as the potential upper (~ 24 kya) and lower (~ 7 kya)
limits for the peopling of Hainan Island represented by
haplogroup M12, respectively.
The phylogeny of haplogroup M7e based on complete
mtDNA genomes revealed that the sequence (Li241)
with 16166C-16172-16223-16311 was directly derived
from the root of haplogroup M7e around 6.5 - 8.0 kya
(Figure 5). As the lineages with the proto haplotypes
defined by HVS-I variations 16172-16223-16311 were
mainly found in southern China and Vietnam (see Additional file 7), the colonization of Hainan Island represented by haplogroup M7e would be probably from this
region around 15.1 ± 11.5 kya (Figure 7). However, as

Figure 5 Reconstructed phylogenetic tree of 21 complete mtDNA genome sequences from haplogroups M12 and M7c’e. The six
reported sequences were taken from the literature and were further labeled by the symbols MD [18], AC [39], QK1 [20], and QK2 [28] followed
by “#”, the geographic locations, and the sample codes or the access numbers in GenBank. One sequence (Accession No. EU294322) submitted
by “Family Tree DNA” was retrieved from GenBank. Haplogroup age estimates (±standard errors) are indicated at the branch roots in terms of
the calibrated mutation rate with symbols as SP [58] and LE [66], respectively. Mutations are transitions at the respective nucleotide position
unless otherwise specified. Letters following positions indicate transversions. Recurrent mutations are underlined. +: insertion; d: deletion; @:
back-mutation. “R” specifies heteroplasmic status A/G and was also noted in italic. Amino acid replacements are specified by single-letter code; s,
synonymous replacements; t, change in transfer RNA; r, change in ribosomal RNA gene.

the network of haplogroup M7e was not in the ideally
star-like structure, the time estimates with a huge standard error should be treated with caution. When we
estimated the expansion time of M7e without the Hainan data, the age (9.4 ± 5.9 kya; Figure 7) seemed more
compatible with the result based on mtDNA genomes
(Figure 5).
For the sequences of M7c* with HVS-I motif as 1618916223-16278, the complete mtDNA sequence (Li152)
could be assigned into M7c1 but did not cluster with
any known lineages of M7c1. This pattern implied that
the related peopling of Hainan Island was likely to be
traced back to the initial differentiation of haplogroup
M7c1 as early as ~ 18 - 27 kya (Figure 5).

Discussion
In general, the mtDNA haplogroup profiles of Hainan
islanders are similar to the profiles of the populations
from mainland southern China. This pattern is consistent with the previous work on NRY [4,40-43]. It

suggests the Hainan islanders should have derived from
mainland southern China and/or have had a common
origin with the populations from this region [30]. Especially, most Hainan islanders were clustered with some
populations from Guangxi (Figure 3). This pattern was
also reflected by the genome-wide data: the Jiamao
population in Hainan Island was clustered with the
Zhuang population (i.e. the dominant minority ethnic
group in Guangxi) as a branch in the tree of the “PanAsian” [44]. Thus, the ancestors of the Li populations
were likely from Guangxi.
As the prevailing haplotype sharing has been found
between the Hainan islanders and the populations from
the mainland, the role of the recent gene flow from the
mainland in shaping the maternal pool of Hainan islanders can not be ignored. This result is in agreement with
the archaeological research, which revealed that the tight
links between Hainan Island and mainland southern
China existed during the Neolithic period [5,10,13].
Meanwhile, some haplotypes were shared by the Li

(original aborigines) and the non-Li (recent immigrants)
populations (Figure 2). It suggests that intermarriages
among different populations might be common and
could strengthen the effect of recent demographic events.
As a result, although certain haplogroups in Hainan
islanders present the star-like phylogeny in the network
(e.g. B5a and M7b1, Figure 2; see Additional file 5) and
the characteristics of the candidate founders [45],
whether their expansion time estimates (Table 2) could

be associated with the early peopling of Hainan Island is
still elusive.
To trace the early peopling of Hainan Island, we paid
more attention to haplogroups M12 M7c1*, and M7e,
because: 1) they have relatively high frequencies in Hainan Island and are relatively concentrated in the Li
populations; 2) some lineages within these haplogroups
are only found in Hainan Island; 3) certain sub-differentiation within these haplogroups are observed. Detailed

mainland did emerge, in general, the mtDNA phylogeny
in Hainan Island was represented as a subset in the context of East Asian and Southeast Asian. The ancestors of
the Li people were likely from the populations in mainland southern China, especially in Guangxi. The recent
gene flow from the mainland might play important roles
in shaping the maternal pool of Hainan islanders. Based
on the mtDNA genome sequencing, the phylogeographic analyses of haplogroups M12, M7e, and M7c1*
suggested that the related immigration from mainland
southern China and Vietnam could be trace back to
around 7 - 27 kya, which largely corresponds to the
results from NRY and archaeology.

Methods
phylogeographic analyses based on mtDNA genomes
suggested the initial peopling of Hainan Island was likely
to be around 7 - 27 kya (Figure 5 - 6) when Hainan
Island was connected with the mainland southern China
and/or northern Vietnam [3,9]. The long-standing connection between Hainan Island and the mainland from
the LGM to 6 - 7 kya [3,9] could provide the opportunity for some of the dispersals of modern human. Our
results are largely in agreement with the time estimates
from NRY [4] and are supported by the recent archeological findings [5-8]. However, as mentioned above, the
gene pool of Hainan islanders was likely to be affected
by the recent immigrants from the mainland. To pin
down the recent gene flow and the ancient components
in detail, it is necessary to improve the resolution of
molecular markers, together with extensive sampling,
and even to employ genome-wide autosomal markers,
which could be the future direction and would provide
more details about the peopling of Hainan Island.

Conclusions
Combining the fresh data of the mtDNA variation of the
285 Li individuals and those from previous study, we

Population samples and DNA extraction

In total, we collected samples from 285 unrelated Li
individuals residing in Hainan Island (Figure 2): 86 from
Qiongzhong Li and Miao Autonomous County (Li-QZ);
99 from Baoting Li and Miao Autonomous County (LiBT); and 100 from Ledong Li Autonomous County (LiLD). All subjects were interviewed to ascertain their ethnic affiliations and to obtain informed consent before
blood collection. Comparative mtDNA data from southern China and Vietnam were taken from previous published literature (see Additional file 2). Genomic DNA
was extracted from whole blood samples by the standard phenol/chloroform methods.
MtDNA typing

The mtDNA control region sequences were amplified by
the PCR method previously reported [46]. HVS-I (minimum length sequenced was nucleotide positions (np)
16080-16569; maximum length sequenced np 1600116569) and HVS-II (minimum length sequenced np 1-207;
maximum length sequenced np 1-575) were sequenced in
all samples as described elsewhere [47]. We performed
haplogroup-specific control region motif recognition and

(near-) matching search with the published mtDNA data
to assign each mtDNA into specific, named haplogroups
[46]. Then we selected certain mtDNAs from sequences
having similar HVS motifs to genotype the related diagnostic sites in the coding region to confirm their haplogroup status (see Additional file 1). Moreover, 14 whole
mtDNA genomes were sequenced following protocols
reported elsewhere [48-50]. The sequences generated in
this study have been deposited in GenBank database
(Accession Nos. HQ156470-HQ156754 for HVS and
HQ157971-HQ157984 for mtDNA genome sequences).
Sequences were edited and aligned by Lasergene
(DNAStar Inc., Madison, Wisconsin, USA) and mutations were scored relative to the revised Cambridge
sequence (rCRS) [51]. For the length variants in the
control region, we followed the rules proposed by Bandelt and Parson (2008) [52]. The transition at 16519 and
the C-length polymorphisms in regions 16180-16193
and 303-315 were disregarded in the analyses. The classification of the mutations of each mtDNA genomes
was performed with mtDNA GeneSyn 1.0 http://www.
ipatimup.pt/downloads/mtDNAGeneSyn.zip [53]. To
avoid any nomenclature conflicts, we followed the criterion of PhyloTree (http://www.phylotree.org, mtDNA
tree Build 10) [54] and the recent updating mtDNA
phylogeny in East Asia [28].

28,62-65] were employed but not displayed in the
tree. The coalescent age was also estimated by statistics
r ± s [56,57]. The recent calibrated rates for the entire
mtDNA genome [58] and for only the synonymous
mutation [66] were adopted, respectively (Figure 5).

Additional material
Additional file 1: mtDNA control and coding region information of
285 Li individuals from three populations. The data provide the
markers examined in the subjects of the present study.

this study. The information includes ethnic groups, sample sizes,
geographic locations, language affinities, and the references for all
additional files.
Additional file 3: mtDNA haplogroup frequencies of 50 populations
from Hainan Island, mainland southern China, and Vietnam. The
data were used in the PCA and AMOVA.
Additional file 4: Haplotype sharing between Hainan islanders and
the populations in the neighboring mainland region. The haplotype
sharing was calculated with the fragment 16090 - 16365 in HVS-I.
Additional file 5: Median-joining network of HVS-I sequences of
haplogroups B4b1, B5a, F1a1, R9b, and M7b1. The information refers
sequences from populations in Hainan Island and its neighboring regions
in the mainland.
Additional file 6: mtDNA sequences of haplogroup M12. The
information refers 98 sequences of haplogroup M12 used to reconstruct
the median-joining network.
Additional file 7: mtDNA sequences of haplogroup M7e. The
information refers 35 sequences of haplogroup M7e used to reconstruct
the median-joining network.

Data analyses

For HVS data, we constructed the median-joining network using Network 4.510 http://www.fluxus-engineering.com/sharenet.htm [55]. The coalescent age of a
haplogroup of interest was estimated by statistics r ±
s [56,57] and the rate of 18,845 years per transition
for control region (16090-16365) [58] was used (Table
2). Principal components analysis (PCA) followed the
method developed by Richards et al. with SPSS13.0
software (SPSS) [38]. Analysis of molecular variance
(AMOVA) was computed with the package Arlequin
3.11 http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/arlequin3/ [59].
The counter map of spatial frequency was created by
using the Kriging algorithm of the Surfer 8.0 package
(Golden Software Inc., Golden, Colorado, USA) [60].
To detect the recent gene flow, haplotypes sharing
analyses between the Hainan islanders and the populations from the mainland were carried out based on
phylogeny [61].
For complete mtDNA sequences, the phylogeny was
reconstructed manually and checked by Network 4.510.
Six reported sequences were employed for tree reconstructed (Figure 5). To estimate the coalescence time of
haplogroup M7c1, additional 13 complete mtDNA genomes from the published literature (Accession Nos.
