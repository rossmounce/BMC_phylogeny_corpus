Abstract
Background: Lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) is a cool-season grain legume which provides a rich source of protein for
human consumption. In terms of genomic resources, lentil is relatively underdeveloped, in comparison to other
Fabaceae species, with limited available data. There is hence a significant need to enhance such resources in order
to identify novel genes and alleles for molecular breeding to increase crop productivity and quality.
Results: Tissue-specific cDNA samples from six distinct lentil genotypes were sequenced using Roche 454 GS-FLX
Titanium technology, generating c. 1.38 × 106 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). De novo assembly generated a total
of 15,354 contigs and 68,715 singletons. The complete unigene set was sequence-analysed against genome drafts
of the model legume species Medicago truncatula and Arabidopsis thaliana to identify 12,639, and 7,476 unique
matches, respectively. When compared to the genome of Glycine max, a total of 20,419 unique hits were observed
corresponding to c. 31% of the known gene space. A total of 25,592 lentil unigenes were subsequently annoated
from GenBank. Simple sequence repeat (SSR)-containing ESTs were identified from consensus sequences and a
total of 2,393 primer pairs were designed. A subset of 192 EST-SSR markers was screened for validation across a
panel 12 cultivated lentil genotypes and one wild relative species. A total of 166 primer pairs obtained successful
amplification, of which 47.5% detected genetic polymorphism.
Conclusions: A substantial collection of ESTs has been developed from sequence analysis of lentil genotypes using
second-generation technology, permitting unigene definition across a broad range of functional categories. As well
as providing resources for functional genomics studies, the unigene set has permitted significant enhancement of
the number of publicly-available molecular genetic markers as tools for improvement of this species.

Background
Until recently, strategies for improvement of many global food legume species have been hindered by a lack of
genetic and genomic resources. During the early 1990s,
barrel medic (Medicago truncatula Gaertn.) and Lotus
japonicus L. were selected as candidate model legume
species, due to relatively small genome sizes, inbreeding
reproductive habits and short life-cycles [1,2]. Whole
genome sequencing projects have been undertaken for
these species, providing the opportunity to identify

putative orthologous gene sequence resources in other
crop legume species, especially those located within the
Galegoid clade of the Fabaceae sub-family Papilionoideae [3]. In addition, a draft genome sequence has been
completed for the warm-season food legume, soybean
(Glycine max), which is located in the other major (Phaseoloid) clade http://www.phytozome.net/soybean, providing additional further insights into comparative
genomics within the Fabaceae family.
The current dearth of genomic resources for many
crop legume species prohibits effective exploitation,
through comparative or translational studies, of molecular genetic tools generated from the three genome draft
sequences. There is consequently a pressing need for
significant efforts to either develop markers capable of

cross-species transfer, in order to enrich existing genetic
maps, or generate more informative species-specific
genetic and genomic tools which can enable the identification of orthologous genes through genome synteny
analysis [3].
Lentil (Lens culinaris ssp. culinaris) is an important
grain legume species cultivated throughout Western
Asia, the Middle east, North Africa, the Indian subcontinent, North America and Australia, providing a vital
source of dietary protein in human diets and straw for
animal feed. Lentil is a diploid (2n = 2 × = 14), annual
flowering self-pollinating crop with a genome size of c.
4 Gbp [4]. Lentil shares the ability to fix atmospheric
nitrogen with other legumes, making it important in the
management of soil fertility in cereal based cropping
systems. Lentil also provides rotational benefits for management of weeds, diseases and pests, and in many cases
offers a profitable, high value crop option for farmers
[5]. However, relatively few genomic resources are currently available for lentil, a total of 9,513 EST sequences
being present in the public domain as of 3rd February
2011.
Estimation of elapsed times since species divergence
from a common ancestor is important for plant comparative genomics. The Galegoid sub-family Vicieae,
which contains M. truncatula, lentil, field pea (Pisum
sativum L.) and faba bean (Vicia faba L.), diverged from
the Loteae sub-family (which contains Lotus japonicus)
c. 25 million years ago [6]. Despite this extended period
of divergence, high levels of macrosynteny are observed
between the various Galegoid species [2]. Close genomic
relationships have also been observed for more distant
comparisons, such as between Glycine and Medicago
[7], for which substantial regions of almost perfect colinearity have been observed. Comparative sequence studies with genome-sequenced legumes is hence of
potentially high value for underdeveloped species such
as lentil.
Due to recent advances in sequencing technology it
has become possible to rapidly generate large datasets
with significantly reduced time and labour requirements
[8,9]. These methods offer a cost-effective means to
access the gene space of a target organism through indepth sequencing of the transcriptome. Initial transcriptome sequencing studies were largely exploratory, and
failed to exploit the potential for next-generation transcriptome sequencing at different scales [10]. However,
many recent reports have been published on massively
parallel approaches to transcriptome sequencing [11-13],
largely using model organisms with available draft genomes to assist assembly [14,15]. Nonetheless, successful
studies have also been performed to generate de novo
transcriptome data assemblies for organisms with no
prior genomic resource development [16].

Given that large numbers of plant species are candidates for DNA sequencing, and that technology
resources are currently finite, careful decisions are
required in respect of sequencing strategy [17], especially for species such as lentil which possess large
nuclear genomes. ESTs are single-pass, partial sequences
from cDNA clones that provide a rapid and cost-effective method to analyse transcribed portions of the genome, while avoiding the non-coding and repetitive DNA
components which contribute the majority of nuclear
DNA content in species with large genomes. EST
sequencing has proved useful in accelerated gene discovery, including identification of gene family structure,
expression analysis, determination of phylogenetic relationships, development of molecular markers such as
SSRs and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
[14,18]. Among the different varieties of molecular
genetic markers, SSRs have many advantages including
high prevalence and ubiquitous distribution within genomes, co-dominant multi-allelic nature and high reproducibility of assay conditions [19]. Functionallyassociated EST-SSRs provide an effective means of
molecular marker development that targets nucleotide
diversity in genic regions, allowing the possibility of
‘perfect’ marker development for the molecular breeding
of crop plants. In addition, due to location in conserved
genic regions, EST-SSR markers frequently display a
high degree of operational transferability between
related species [20].
This study describes the generation, de novo assembly
and annotation of a transcriptome-derived EST dataset
derived from cDNA obtained from multiple tissues of
six genotypes of lentil at various stages of development,
using the 454 Life Sciences GS-FLX Titanium secondgeneration DNA sequencing technology. Clustering and
annotation to generate a unigene set has permitted computational identification of SSR loci, and the design and
evaluation of a set of EST-SSR marker-directed primer
pairs.

Materials and methods
Plant material

Lentil seeds were obtained from the Australian Temperate Field Crops Collection held at the Department of
Primary Industries, Horsham, Victoria, Australia. Three
to four seeds from each of six genotypes (Northfield,
ILL2024, ILL7537, ILL6788, Digger, Indianhead),
selected based on diversity and important agronomic,
abiotic and/or disease trait variation, were sown into
commercial potting mix. Germinated plantlets were
grown until maturity under glasshouse conditions with
natural light on the premises of Department of Primary
Industries, Bundoora, Victoria, Australia. Different plant
tissues were harvested for RNA isolation from lentil

Kaur et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:265
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/265

plants at various stages of development, including: leaf
(young and mature), stem, flowers, immature pods,
mature pods and immature seeds. A total of 10 seeds
were also germinated in Petri dishes to harvest seedling
root and shoot samples. All of the vegetative plant tissues (leaf and stem) were pooled for RNA isolation and
designated LS (leaf/stem) tissue. All of the reproductive
organs including flowers, immature pods, mature pods
and immature seeds were also pooled for RNA isolation
and designated FS (flower/seed) tissue. The seedlingderived root (SR) and shoot (SS) samples were used
separately for RNA isolation.
RNA isolation and cDNA preparation

Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit
(QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA samples were visually
assessed on 1% (w/v) agarose gels for sample integrity
before proceeding to cDNA synthesis. cDNA was prepared using SMART cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech
Laboratories, California, USA) and mRNA was reverse
transcribed by SMARTScribe™ Reverse Transcriptase
with the PCR primers SMART IV™ Oligonucleotide
and a modified primer with broken chain polyT (5’AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT CGCAGTCGGTACTTTTTTCTTTTTTV-3’) instead of using the standard CDS-III primer [21]. Modification of the cDNA
synthesis procedure prevents incorporation of long A/T
homopolymer stretches originating from the poly d(A)
mRNA tails, which create problems for efficient synthesis during the pyrosequencing reaction. cDNA obtained
from LS tissue was normalised using the Evrogen (Sapphire Biosciences Pty Ltd, NSW, Australia) Trimmer
cDNA kit to reduce the impact of abundant transcripts
which may dominate the generated population of
sequence reads. This protocol involves the processes of
cDNA denaturation-reassociation, degradation of the
double-stranded fraction formed by abundant transcripts
using the duplex specific nuclease (DSN) enzyme [22],
and PCR amplification of the equalised single-stranded
(ss) DNA fraction.
EST sequence generation, assembly and annotation

cDNA obtained from four different fractions; leaf and
stem (LS), flowers, immature pods, mature pods, immature seeds (FS), root germinants (RG) and shoot germinants (SG) were pooled in equimolar ratio before
proceeding to GS-library preparation. For ILL2024 (a
saline stress tolerant genotype), an additional 10 seeds
were germinated in Petri dishes under high salt concentration (80 mM NaCl). Seedlings were used to extract
RNA and synthesise cDNA which was then pooled
along with other fractions towards the construction of
GS FLX library. Approximately 5 mu μg of pooled

Page 3 of 11

cDNA was sheared by nebulisation at 206 kPa for 2
min. The GS-FLX Titanium shotgun library construction method was then performed following manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Diagnostics). Quantitation of
the ssDNA library was performed using real-time PCR
and emulsions were prepared using the Lib-L emPCR
protocol (Roche Diagnostics, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia). Finally, enriched beads were loaded onto picotitre
plates for sequencing.
Primary sequence output has been deposited in the
sequence read archive of GenBank (JI846297 - JI861594)
prior to assembly. Sequence reads were de novo
assembled using the NextGene software (Softgenetics,
State College, Pennsylvania, USA), adaptor and primer
sequences being removed prior to assembly using the
‘trimming’ function (trim sequences with 100% similarity
to the primer/adaptor sequence). De novo assembly was
performed using the Greedy algorithm and error correction condensation. Assembled contigs and singletons
were compared against the Medicago truncatula (Mt
release 3.0), Arabidopsis thaliana (TAIR 9 CDS) and
Glycine max (Glyma 1.0) transcriptome databases using
BLASTN [23] with a threshold E value of 10-10 applied.
BLASTN analysis was also performed in the non-redundant database of GenBank using the tBLASTX algorithm
to derive putative annotations of the unigene set. Gene
ontology (GO) terms were also assigned to the set of
unigenes that showed hits against the Arabidopsis thaliana database using the ‘Gene Ontology at TAIR’ tool.
EST-SSR detection, primer design and marker validation

EST-SSR locus detection and primer pair design was
performed using the Batch Primer3 software http://
probes.pw.usda.gov/cgi-bin/batchprimer3/batchprimer3.
cgi. The parameters were designed for identifying perfect di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide motifs
with minimum of repeat numbers of 6, 4, 3, 3, and 3,
respectively. Primer design parameters were set as follows: length range = 18 to 23 nucleotides with 21 as
optimum; PCR product size range = 100 to 400 bp; optimum annealing temperature = 55°C; and GC content
40-60%, with 50% as optimum.
Lentil genomic DNA was extracted from a total of 13
diverse lentil genotypes (12 from the cultivated species
and one non-domesticated related species [L. nigricans]
for EST-SSR marker validation using the DNeasy® 96
Plant Kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Fresh leaf tissue from each genotype was
used for each extraction and ground using liquid nitrogen or a Mixer Mill 300 (Retsch ®, Rheinische Straße,
Haan, Germany). DNA was resuspended in 100 μl of
water and dilutions performed to a concentration of 10
ng/μl, followed by storage at either -20°C or -80°C. A
collection of randomly selected EST-SSR primer pairs

were validated experimentally, forward primers being
synthesised with addition of an M13 sequence, to enable
fluorescent tail addition through the PCR amplification
process [24]. PCR conditions included a hot-start at 95°
for 10 minutes, followed by 10 cycles of 94° for 30 s, 6050° for 30 s and 72° for 30 s, followed by 25 cycles of
94° for 30 s, 50° for 30 s and 72° for 30 s and a final
elongation step of 72° for 10 min. PCR products were
separated using an ABI3730xl (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) according to manufacturers’
instructions with the addition of the ABI GeneScan
LIZ500 size standard and amplification product sizes
were determined using the GeneMapper® v3.7 software
(Applied Biosystems).

Results
Sequencing and de novo assembly of EST reads

Structural and functional annotation of ESTs

The derived unigene set was analysed using BLASTN
against the M. truncatula genome draft, and a total of
12,639 unique matches were obtained (6,978 contigs
and 5,661 singletons) (Additional file 3). All consensus
sequences were also compared against the nr database
of GenBank. A total of 12,544 contigs and 33,013 singletons (45,557 unigenes) obtained matches at E < 10-10.
Any query sequences that revealed a most significant
match against a non-plant species were removed from
the list, leaving a total of 44,756 entries (Additional file
4, sheet 4.1). As more than one contig or singleton can
originate from a single gene due to either non-overlapping sequence reads or high levels of sequence error in
a single read, it is feasible to generate a collapsed

No. of contigs

A total of 1.38 × 106 reads corresponding to a cumulative sequence of 448 Mbp were generated from a range
of tissues of six genotypes of lentil using the GS-FLX
Titanium chemistry. Prior to sequence quality filtering,
a median sequence read length of 330 bp was generated. The adaptors, primer sequences and strings of 35
nucleotides from both the 5’- and 3’-termini of each
sequence read were removed in order to generate high
confidence reads. A total of 847,824 high quality reads
were then used to perform de novo assembly. After
clustering and assembly, a total of 15,359 contigs and
68,715 singletons were obtained, representing a total of
84,074 unigenes (Additional files 1 and 2). The unigene
set was then further analysed for quality based on read
length, and any remnant sequences less than 100 bp in
length were excluded from further analysis, leaving a
total of 15,354 contigs and 66,652 singletons. The
length of contigs ranged from 114 bp to 6479 bp, with
an average of 717 bp. Contig coverage varied from 1.25fold to 8779-fold, with an average of 13.9-fold. The
number of reads per contig varied between 2 and
104,007 with an average of 46 (Table 1). The distributions of read length and number of reads per contig are
shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. After assembly,
9,614 contigs were identified with read lengths > 500
bp. In addition, only 0.4% of the contigs displayed a
read length < 200 bp. This effect might be due to the
short length of individual reads, and/or to low coverage
of the transcriptome. The majority of contigs (51.5%)
were derived from less than 10 reads (Figure 2), followed by 21% composed of up to 11-20 reads per contig. A total of 5.9% of the contigs were composed of
more than 100 reads in each contig.
The length of singletons varied from 101-560 bp, with
an average of 286 bp. The majority of singletons (72%)
were between 200-350 bp in length, and 4.3% were
longer than 400 bp (Figure 3).

sequence collection for identification of multiple unigenes that originate from the same gene. A cohort of
gene loci were identified that corresponded to a set of
25,592 unique matches (10,506 contigs, 41%; 15,086 singletons, 59%) (Additional file 4, sheet 4.2). Base substitution rate was determined through comparison of
consensus sequences of orthologues from Lens culinaris,
Medicago truncatula and Arabidopsis thaliana for four
randomly selected genes (each being > 0.5 kb in length)
(data not shown). Average nucleotide substitution rate
in the lentil and M. truncatula comparison was found
to be 9 per 100 bp (stdev = 1.1), but the equivalent
value when comparing lentil to A. thaliana was 23/100
bp (stdev = 2.6). Due to the relatively high degree of
sequence conservation, data from the present study is
also applicable to model species such as M. truncatula
and A. thaliana, providing an opportunity to study comparative genomics and evolutionary relationships
between dicotyledonous plant species.
The consensus sequences were also compared against
Arabidopsis thaliana database and 7,476 unique
matches were identified, including 3,941 contigs and
3,535 singletons (Additional file 5). All unique matches

were annotated and gene ontology (GO) terms were
further assigned corresponding to a total of 34,034 gene
counts and 44,734 annotation counts (Figures 4-6). The
intracellular component category of the cellular component classification class contributed the largest proportion of all annotations (17%), followed by the
cytoplasmic component (13%), chloroplast component
(11%), membrane component (10%), other cellular component (10%), nuclear component (8%) and plasma
membrane component (8%) categories. Other components such as plastid, cytosol, mitochondria, ER, golgi
apparatus, cell wall, ribosome and extracellular components were represented at proportions less than 5% of
total (Figure 4). Among the molecular function classification class, the enzyme activity, transferase activity,
binding activity, hydrolase activity, molecular function,
nucleotide binding and protein binding categories
included the majority of detected matches (Figure 5). In
the biological processes classification class, cellular
(25%) and metabolic processes (22%) constituted the
major categories, followed by protein metabolism (9%),
unknown biological processes (9%), developmental processes (5%), stress response (5%), transport (5%) and cell
organization and biogenesis (4%) (Figure 6).
Finally the lentil unigene set was also compared against
Glycine max EST sequences database [http://www.phytozome.net/soybean, 25] that identified 20,419 unique
matches (Additional file 6).
Frequency and distribution of EST-SSRs in lentil
transcriptome

EST-SSR discovery was performed based on analysis
from assembled contig templates, and a total of 2,929
distinct loci were identified, a frequency of 16% (2,415
SSR containing contigs/15,354 total contigs). A total of
2,393 SSR primer pairs were designed from these loci,
412 template contigs containing at least two SSR loci
eligible for primer pair design (Additional file 7). Incidences of different repeat types were determined (Table
2), the most abundant being trinucleotide arrays (1,424:
60.6%). Frequencies for each array type according to
repeat unit number were also evaluated (Table 2), the
most common class being n = 5 (1,037 loci: 44.1%),
while only 1.1% of loci contained more than 9 repeat
units.

Discussion
Assembly and annotation

A limited amount of genomic data pertaining to the
cool-season food legume lentil (as well as related species
such as chickpea, field pea and faba bean) was publicly
available prior to commencement of this study. Relatively few activities have previously been performed to
address this deficit. The 454 Life Sciences GS-FLX Titanium second-generation sequencing technology provides
a rapid, efficient and cost-effective method for genomic
resource enrichment through generation of large numbers of ESTs with individual read lengths of up to 500
bp. The technology has previously been used to perform

de novo bacterial genome sequencing, whole genome
shotgun sequencing, metagenomic studies, transcriptome characterisation and small RNA sequence determination [26].
In order to produce a maximally informative lentil
transcriptome sequence resource, cDNA from leaf and
stem tissue was normalised prior to sequence analysis.
This process reduces oversampling of abundant transcripts such those derived from the chloroplast or
nuclear genes involved in photosynthetic processes (e.g.
rbcL, rbcS, cab), and more efficient detection of transcripts expressed at low levels in specific tissues. A preliminary study (data not shown) suggested that
normalisation of lentil cDNA could enhance rare transcript detection by c. 10%. A similar approach was effective for detection of lowly-expressed genes from cDNA

sequencing in both M. truncatula and Artemisia annua
[14,27]. Alternatively, laser-capture microdissection followed by second-generation sequencing may be used for
rare transcript identification, but the process is technically challenging [28,29].
The quality of sequence generation, which may be
negatively impacted by poly d(A) content, was also
improved by use of a modified primer with an interrupted poly d(T) tail, leading to an increase of 5-6% in
output of the total number of sequenced fragments
(data not shown). Higher levels of enhanced sequencing
output may be attainable for full length cDNA transcripts, which were not targeted in the current study.
Similar approaches have been taken in other reports to
maximise sequencing output [30,31].
Some recent studies have indicated that short reads
from 454 GS FLX pyrosequencing may be effectively
assembled and used to characterise the gene space in
various organisms [16,21,32,33]. The GS FLX Titanium

technology upgrade has permitted recovery of read
lengths up to 400-500 bp, and hence assembly of larger
contigs. The average contig length produced in the present study was 770 bp, which is significantly longer than
those derived from previous studies (e.g. 197 bp; [34],
334 bp; [27], 440 bp; [31], 500 bp; [16]). A majority
(56.4%) of reads were assembled into contigs, comparable to efficiencies from similar studies (62%, [27]; 48%,
[16]). A large number of singletons (68,715) were also
obtained, consistent with other studies based on 454 GS
technology [16,27]. Singleton generation may be due to
a variety of causes such as sequencing error, template
contamination and effect of assembly algorithm [35]. It
was also noted that most of the singletons were
obtained from source genotype ILL2024 under salt
stress treatment, which may represent a class of genes
that were not expressed in the other genotypes. A total
of 48% of singletons matched GenBank accessions, leaving 52% singletons unmatched, this is in contrast to the

proportions which failed to match known databases in
parallel studies (13%; [16], 32%; [20]). However the 52%
of singletons that failed to match any known sequence
in GenBank is only 4% (35,702) of the total reads
(847,824) that were committed to assembly, which is
relatively common in transcriptome sequence analysis.
These effects may be due to several possible factors,
including the propensity of short read lengths to hinder
assembly, and incomplete incidence of genes

corresponding to low abundance transcripts in current
sequence databases [20]. Among the 33,013 singletons
that revealed significant matches against a known database, 699 were annotated against a bacterial, viral, animal or human genome. In addition, many singletons
showed matches to the same gene, resulting in 15,086
singletons with unique annotations, which contributed a
majority of the c. 25,000 unigenes. This value is comparable to the total number of genes identified in genome

drafts of other diploid plant species such as rice, sorghum, A. thaliana and Brachpodium distachyon [36,37].
Given that next-generation sequencing projects will
soon become common in non-model organisms,
increases in the amount and quality of derived data
should progressively result in the improvement of de
novo assembly algorithms. In addition, enrichment of
genomic resources will further assist in identification of
rare transcripts from collections of sequences that
include those of low quality. However, a large proportion (81%) of the assembled contigs exhibited significant
matches to present versions of public domain sequence
databases. This confidence in annotation has presumably
been assisted by the improvements of contig length
(62% longer than 500 bp) obtained from the use of GSFLX Titanium chemistry. Estimation of the number of
genes and level of transcript coverage represented in an
EST collection is an important objective for transcriptome sequencing projects, but is difficult or impossible
without a completely annotated reference genome
sequence. Assuming a similar number of genes (approx
25,000) as in other diploid plant genomes, the sequences
annotated in this study are likely to represent c. 50% of
the lentil gene complement. These estimates were supported by comparative analysis with M. truncatula, for
which 12,639 unique matches represent c. 50% of the
known gene space. For more distantly related, A. thaliana, the corresponding value was c. 30% of the gene
space. In comparison to G. max, 20,419 unique hits
represent c. 31% of the known gene space (compared
with a total of predicted 66,153 protein-coding loci),
Marker identification and characterization

SSR-based marker systems have increasingly become
popular for population genetic analyses and genetic mapping studies [38]. Traditional methods for development
of genomic DNA-derived SSRs are expensive, laborious
and time-consuming. However, ESTs generated by largescale transcriptome sequencing programs are a potentially rich source for SSR discovery. EST-SSRs exhibit
potential advantages when compared to SSRs located in
non-transcribed regions due to generally more consistent
efficiency of amplification, and enhanced cross-species
transferability [39,40]. Substantial numbers of SSR loci
were identified in the present lentil EST collection, supporting high quality PCR primer design in most
instances. As EST-SSR loci are genic and have been
derived from transcriptome database, the majority of the
EST-SSR loci should occur in the protein-coding
sequences of annotated contigs, representing genes of
known or predicted identity and function.
The frequency of EST-SSR loci detected in cultivated
lentil is similar to estimates from other broad-leaved
plant species (2% to 17%) [41]. These prevalence values

Page 9 of 11

are influenced by the type of software (such as SPUTNIK, SSRIT, Batchprimer3 and FastPCR) and default
parameters used for detection, which would be expected
to produce minor influences on the efficiency of detection [42-46]. In the present study, trinucleotide units are
the most abundant form of SSR repeat structure, consistent with results from other plant species [47,48].
The results of EST-SSR validation using cultivated and
non-domesticated Lens genotypes suggest that polymorphism frequency is highly enhanced by inclusion of
germplasm outside the pooled of contemporary germplasm, as observed for other crop plant species [49-51].
The ability to amplify across specific boundaries is a
common property of EST-SSRs, as previously described,
and has been demonstrated for other legume taxa
through efficient detection of polymorphisms in other
Medicago species such as alfalfa by M. truncatuladerived EST-SSRs [46]. L. culinaris-derived SSRs may
hence be implemented for study of the genus Lens in
the broader sense, to fully access exotic gene pools.

Conclusions
Generation of a substantial EST-derived dataset from
cultivated lentil is described in this study, comprising
84,074 unigenes, of which c. 25,000 have been sequence
annotated. A set of EST-SSR primer pairs has been
designed using unigene templates and demonstrated to
be effective for polymorphism detection within cultivated germplasm and across the genus Lens.
