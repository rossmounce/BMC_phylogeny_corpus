Elementary, my dear Cameron
Mark A Jobling

All science is about creativity and ingenuity: coming up
with a good way to answer a tricky question. But with
forensic science, somehow these qualities take on an
additional lustre. In part, this is the romance of the
whodunit - tales of Dupin, Holmes or Poirot; in part, it
is the application of so many diverse scientific disciplines to the same ultimate goal; and, in part, it is the
knowledge that the effort can bring about a public good,
in the shape of justice.
I read two papers recently that reminded me of this
ingenuity. The first describes the application of a highly
abstract and academic discipline, molecular phylogenetics, to support two convictions for assault [1] and the
second the application of a spin-off from immunology
to determine the age of a person from a sample of their
blood alone [2].
The weapon in the assault cases [1] was, despite its small
size, a deadly one - the virus HIV-1. The question being
asked was about the direction of transmission of the virus
among a set of infected individuals: in particular, does the
phylogenetic evidence support the hypothesis that the
defendant (who knew himself to be HIV-positive in each
case) was responsible for the infections carried by a number of his sexual partners? Two aspects of HIV-1 biology
were exploited in order to address this: first, the virus has
a high mutation rate (about 3 × 10-5 per base per replication cycle) and so, during proliferation within an infected
person, a diverse set of HIV-1 sequences arises; and second, when one person infects another, the population of
viruses goes through a strong genetic bottleneck, so that
three-quarters of new infections are each established by a
single virus.
In each case the sample identity was blinded and parts
of the HIV-1 genome sequenced in the putative offender
and victims. A phylogenetic tree showed that sequences
from one DNA donor contained subsets that were more
closely related to the sequences carried by other donors
than they were to other subsets in the same donor. This
property (’paraphyly’) demonstrates that one DNA
donor is the source of the infections in the others.

In each case the inferred source was revealed to be the
defendant and the DNA evidence contributed to the
conviction.
The second paper [2] exploits the curious fact that, as
a person ages, their thymus shrinks. This organ is the
home of T-lymphocyte development and, as these cells
mature, they rearrange the genes encoding T-cell receptors (TCRs), ejecting a DNA circle in the process. The
concentration of one specific circle can be measured in
a blood sample and normalized by comparing it with a
control gene sequence. This normalized concentration
can be compared with the age of the blood donor, with
the expectation that the older the donor, the smaller
their thymus and the less of the DNA circle their blood
should contain. The correlation is not perfect, but nonetheless impressive, allowing >89% accuracy in assigning
a donor to a particular 20-year window of age. The
method also works on blood that is old or in small
amounts and so provides another tool in the forensic
investigative toolbox when no suspect is available.
Fostering this kind of creativity and ingenuity in forensic science requires investment. Of course, research in
universities funded through diverse sources is important
here - indeed, both the examples given above come from
university-based groups. However, state-funded forensic
science services also play a major role in the development
of novel methods, as well as in setting standards. This is
something the UK government appears not to appreciate
because it has recently announced plans to close its Forensic Science Service (FSS). The FSS traces its origins to
the 1930 s and was a key player in the development of
DNA profiling and the establishment of the first national
DNA database, begun in 1995. Over the last 10 years the
FSS has undergone stepwise changes of status that, in
effect, have transformed it into a company that must
compete with other suppliers of forensic services that do
not have its responsibilities, research capability or scope.
Surprise, surprise, it has not competed effectively in the
marketplace and stands accused today of losing too
much money.
Successive governments have behaved with cynicism
here - acting, as Oscar Wilde put it, as if knowing the

price of everything but the value of nothing. A market
based on the cheapest possible provision of standard
forensic services will fail the UK’s criminal justice system when specialized and innovative methods are
needed for particular cases. David Cameron’s coalition
has already been forced into some embarrassing
U-turns, including a change of heart on the axing of
highly successful schools sports programmes in the year
before the London Olympic Games. Pressure for them
to reconsider their position on the FSS has been increasing from the international community of forensic scientists [3] and in the form of a growing public petition
demanding a debate in parliament. Concerned readers
should add their voices to this chorus: Cameron is making a mistake.
The Editors-in-Chief of the journal have also commented on the closure of the FSS in an editorial, available here http://www.investigativegenetics.com/content/
