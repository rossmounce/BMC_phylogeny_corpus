Converging seasonal prevalence dynamics in
experimental epidemics
Sandra Lass1,2,3*, Jürgen W Hottinger1,2, Thomas Fabbro1,2,4 and Dieter Ebert1,2

Abstract
Background: Regular seasonal changes in prevalence of infectious diseases are often observed in nature, but the
mechanisms are rarely understood. Empirical tests aiming at a better understanding of seasonal prevalence
patterns are not feasible for most diseases and thus are widely lacking. Here, we set out to study experimentally
the seasonal prevalence in an aquatic host-parasite system. The microsporidian parasite Hamiltosporidium
tvärminnensis exhibits pronounced seasonality in natural rock pool populations of its host, Daphnia magna with a
regular increase of prevalence during summer and a decrease during winter. An earlier study was, however, unable
to test if different starting conditions (initial prevalence) influence the dynamics of the disease in the long term.
Here, we aim at testing how the starting prevalence affects the regular prevalence changes over a 4-year period in
experimental populations.
Results: In an outdoor experiment, populations were set up to include the extremes of the prevalence spectrum
observed in natural populations: 5% initial prevalence mimicking a newly invading parasite, 100% mimicking a rock
pool population founded by infected hosts only, and 50% prevalence which is commonly observed in natural
populations in spring. The parasite exhibited similar prevalence changes in all treatments, but seasonal patterns in
the 100% treatment differed significantly from those in the 5% and 50% treatments. Populations started with 5%
and 50% prevalence exhibited strong and regular seasonality already in the first year. In contrast, the amplitude of
changes in the 100% treatment was low throughout the experiment demonstrating the long-lasting effect of initial
conditions on prevalence dynamics.
Conclusions: Our study shows that the time needed to approach the seasonal changes in prevalence depends
strongly on the initial prevalence. Because individual D. magna populations in this rock pool metapopulation are
mostly short lived, only few populations might ever reach a point where the initial conditions are not visible
anymore.

Background
Seasonal changes in prevalence are ubiquitous in infectious diseases of plants, invertebrates and vertebrates
[1-7]. Some of the more famous ones are influenza and
measles, two of the paradigms for regular seasonal epidemics. Understanding the dynamics of such prevalence
patterns has been a major challenge in epidemiology for
the last decades. Numerous factors are known to cause
and influence seasonal prevalence dynamics. Extrinsic

factors affecting prevalence dynamics include physical
conditions such as weather as well as community context of the host-parasite system, i.e. interactions with
other members of the community [6-13]. Transmission
of the influenza virus has been shown to depend on
temperature and humidity and to be favoured by dry
and cold conditions [14]. Intrinsic factors, inherent
properties of the host-parasite system itself, include the
host’s immune system, host genetics, the parasite’s
transmission mode and parasite virulence, all of which
are capable of generating seasonal changes in prevalence
[15]. Seasonal prevalence patterns observed in natural
populations may thus result from the complex interplay

of different mechanisms. In measles, an external forcing
(alternation of holidays and school terms) stimulates an
intrinsic oscillatory behaviour of the host-parasite system caused by its short duration of infection and longlasting host immunity [e.g. [16,17]].
Furthermore, seasonal prevalence patterns can have
very different characteristics, even in the same system.
For example, it is possible for multiple stable patterns to
co-exist in one system [18]. Which pattern is
approached by a system may again depend on multiple
factors. Seasonal prevalence patterns could also be transient, with stable prevalence being reached if time permits [19]. The complexity of the interactions among
factors influencing disease dynamics is hardly ever
understood, even more so, as most studies of seasonality
of prevalence, are observational and comparative [1,20]
whereas empirical testing with experiments or manipulation are often impossible and hence rare. An ultimate
test to understand the robustness of prevalence patterns
is to perturb them in an experimental setting and discern the influence of individual factors. This is the central aim of the current study.
Hamiltosporidium tvärminnensis (formerly misidentified as Octosporea bayeri [21]) is a common parasite in
natural rock pool populations of Daphnia magna. It
undergoes seasonal epidemics, where prevalence rises in
spring and decreases across winter [22]. The observed
disease pattern suggests the existence of an annual pattern that is approached by all populations. In these natural populations seasonal prevalence changes seemed
independent of the time since the parasite appeared for
the first time in a given population: populations that
had recently gotten infected showed the same pattern as
populations that were known to be infected for years
[22]. Experimental manipulations of the disease
dynamics were however not conducted, leaving several
questions about the nature and the stability of these
dynamics open.
One major factor of interest for the Daphnia - Hamiltosporidium system is the role of the initial prevalence
for the disease dynamics. The host species forms a
metapopulation in rock pools, where individual populations undergo frequent extinction and recolonization
[23]. This can lead to drastic differences in the initial
prevalence of the parasites. In cases where the parasite
invades an existing host population via spores or an
infected resting egg the initial prevalence is rather low.
In contrast, initial prevalence can be as high as 100%.
This is because host populations are often founded by
one or few resting eggs [24]. If all founder eggs are
infected the initial prevalence is 100%, with lower values
being possible for different proportions of founders
being infected. Such widely differing initial prevalences
are expected to strongly influence the disease dynamics

in the short term, and possibly even in the longer term.
Here we present a study to test the effect of initial prevalence of the disease dynamics of Hamiltosporidium
tvärminnensis.
To investigate if initial prevalence may lead to different prevalence patterns, we conducted an epidemiological experiment starting with mesocosm populations
differing widely in their initial prevalence (0, 5, 50 and
100%). The host-parasite system was isolated from its
natural context, excluding other parasites and competitors that could potentially influence prevalence [9].
Other factors known to affect prevalence patterns, such
as host and parasite genotype and host population density, were excluded. Experimental populations were
started with one host genotype, the same mixture of
parasite genotypes and the same density. Based on our
observations in natural populations [22], we hypothesize
that seasonal prevalence patterns are robust to initial
prevalence differences in this system.
We further tested if the parasite affects host population density. Based on experiments with other Daphnia
microparasites [25,26], we predict a parasite-induced
reduction of host population density. The extent of
parasite-induced reduction of host population density is
expected to correlate with initial parasite prevalence. As
the parasite is known to reduce host fecundity, and
lower fecundity has been shown to result in lower host
population density [25,26], we expect a stronger reduction in host density in populations with 100% initial prevalence compared to populations started with lower
prevalence. If the parasite also reduces sexual reproduction in its host, this is likely to result in a lower host
population density already in spring after the sexuallyproduced resting eggs hatched. If a lower hatchling density is observed in spring this could alternatively be
explained by a lower hatching success of infected resting
eggs which we will also test for.
The host-parasite system

The host Daphnia magna is a planktonic freshwater
crustacean that reproduces by cyclical parthenogenesis
with clonal reproduction during favourable conditions
and a switch to sexual reproduction when environmental conditions deteriorate. Sexual reproduction results in
the formation of resting eggs enclosed by a so-called
ephippial case (part of the mother’s carapace), in which
eggs can outlast winter frost and summer drought.
When environmental conditions become favourable
females hatch from these resting eggs and start clonal
reproduction.
The parasite Hamiltosporidium tvärminnensis is a
microsporidium specific to D. magna causing chronic
infections. It is an obligate intracellular parasite infecting
the fat cells and the ovaries of its host [27]. The parasite

Lass et al. BMC Ecology 2011, 11:14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/11/14

significantly lowers reproductive success, i.e. production
of asexual offspring as well as of sexually produced resting eggs, and decreases longevity in its D. magna host
as compared to uninfected hosts [28]. It has a direct
life-cycle and transmits horizontally, via spores from
dead decaying hosts and vertically, from mothers to
their offspring [27]. Vertical transmission to asexual
eggs is 100% efficient whereas transmission to sexual
eggs is less efficient [22,27]. Hamiltosporidium is the
most abundant microparasite in D. magna populations
in the Tvärminne archipelago along the south-western
coast of Finland [23] where host and parasite inhabit
rainwater-filled depressions in the rocks of the Skerry
islands. At least seven other ecto- and eight different
endoparasites parasitize D. magna in these rock pools;
and two other Daphnia species, D. pulex and D. longispina, as well as a number of freshwater invertebrates,
including some which prey on Daphnia, co-occur with
D. magna [23,29,30]. The role of these Daphnia antagonists for the dynamics of Hamiltosporidium is unknown.
In the current experiment we excluded them, by conducting the experiment in mesocosms spatially isolated
from the rock pool populations.
In the rock pools, D. magna hatch from resting eggs
in spring (May), reproduce asexually (about 8 asexual
generations per year) and sexually from spring to
autumn (May-October) and undergo diapause during
winter (November-April). The rock pools are characterized by instability caused by frequent drying up in summer, sudden invasions of brackish water from the Baltic
Sea and freezing in winter. Summer drought of pools
also leads to Daphnia diapause. Our experiment
included winter diapause, but we excluded summer
droughts and the invasion of brackish water.
Most importantly for our study, the parasite exhibits
pronounced seasonal prevalence dynamics in natural
populations [22]: Prevalence is low to intermediate in
spring, increases rapidly across the summer, reaching
close to 100% prevalence in most populations by mid
summer. The following spring, prevalence is again at
low to intermediate levels [22]. Prevalence increases due
to a combination of perfect vertical transmission from
mothers into their asexually derived offspring and efficient horizontal transmission enabling parasite spread
[22,27]. The main cause identified for prevalence
decrease is host diapause [22,31]. Several factors seem
to contribute to this diapause-related prevalence decline:
Vertical transmission into sexual resting eggs is imperfect, reducing prevalence after diapause [27]. Imperfect
vertical transmission to sexual offspring is stronger in
outbred sexual eggs than in selfed sexual eggs [31], making host genetic diversity a confounding factor in disease
dynamics [32]. In our experiment, we therefore excluded
the effect of host genetic diversity. Environmental

conditions during diapause further influence the magnitude of the prevalence decrease [22]. Again, we excluded
this factor in our experiment, by treating all populations
equally during diapause.
This host-parasite system offers the unique opportunity to investigate seasonal prevalence patterns and to
improve our understanding of regular prevalence
dynamics using epidemiological experiments.

Results
Parasite prevalence

Parasite prevalence increased significantly during the
hosts’ growing season from spring to autumn (LMM;
28% increase, t = 10.61, p < 0.001) and decreased significantly across winter diapause, i.e. from fall to spring
(LMM; 23% decrease, t = -8.14, p < 0.001, Figures 1a
and 2). Prevalence changes in the 50% and 100% treatments differed significantly from each other (LMM; difference in increase and decrease, t > 5.26, p < 0.001, for
both contrasts) while we did not find any evidence for a
difference between the 5% and 50% treatment (LMM; t
< 0.87, p > 0.35). The midsummer prevalence decline in
the 5% and 50% treatments in 2003 (Figure 1a) was
caused by the fact that the planktonic Daphnia population went extinct in a few populations, and prevalence
was low in two of three populations after they got repopulated by hatchlings from resting eggs.
Host population density

Host density in uninfected populations (0% treatment)
was on average about 1/3 higher than host density in
infected populations (LMM; t = 2.83, p = 0.007, Figure
1b). Host density of the infected treatments did not differ from each other (LMM; t < 0.06, p > 0.9, Figure 1b).
Spring hatchling density differed significantly between
treatments (one-way ANOVAs, 2004: F3, 34 = 3.73, p =
0.02; 2005: F 3, 37 = 4.89, p = 0.006), with uninfected
populations harbouring more hatchlings than infected
populations (Figure 3). Infected populations did not differ significantly in hatchling density.
Number of ephippia and resting eggs

Time had a significant effect on the number of ephippia
produced (repeated-measures ANOVA, time: F13, 27 =
17.86, p < 0.001). With increasing time the treatments
differed in the number of ephippia they harboured
(repeated-measures ANOVA, treatment × time: F39, 81 =
2.17, p = 0.0018) with a higher number of ephippia
accumulating in uninfected than in infected populations
(Figure 1c). Treatment alone did not have a significant
effect on the number of ephippia (repeated-measures
ANOVA, treatment: F3, 39 = 2.12, p = 0.114). As in natural rock pools water volume in the experimental containers was highly variable (between 27-100 L) over

time. This was due to rain, evaporation and sampling.
However, water level fluctuations went in parallel in
all populations and thus did not affect treatments
differently.
Ephippia from uninfected populations contained on
average about 18% more resting eggs (1.47 ± 0.04 eggs
per ephippium) than those from infected populations
(5%: 1.15 ± 0.08, 50%: 1.18 ± 0.10, 100%: 1.31 ± 0.07;
one-way ANOVA, F3,23 = 4.19, p = 0.019; sample size n
= 49 ± 3 (s.e.) ephippia per population).
Hatching success

After winter diapause, hatchlings appeared in all experimental populations around the same time in spring (S.
Lass, personal observation). Comparing percentage of
loculi in the ephippia filled with resting eggs before and

after winter diapause showed that on average 44.5% ±
0.4 (s.e.) of all eggs produced in 2002 hatched in spring
2003 (with 44.7% ± 4.4 in the uninfected controls, 45.6%
± 4.1 in the 5%, 43.1% ± 7.0 in the 50% and 45.1% ± 6.6
in the 100% treatments). Consequently, hatching success
did not differ significantly between treatments (one-way
ANOVA, F3, 23 = 0.018, p = 0.99).

Discussion
Seasonal Prevalence pattern

Disease dynamics of the microsporidium Hamiltosporidium tvärminnensis in populations of its Daphnia
magna host are characterized by pronounced seasonality: Prevalence is low in spring and high in fall in
natural [22] as well as in experimental populations
(Figure 1a). These prevalence dynamics were found in

Lass et al. BMC Ecology 2011, 11:14

populations which were started with very different initial
prevalence (Figure 1a). Although populations started
with 100% prevalence exhibited a decrease in prevalence
after the first winter (to 96 ± 2% prevalence) and a regular seasonal increase and decrease in prevalence thereafter, prevalence changes in these populations differed
significantly from those of the 50% treatment due to
their lower amplitude (Figures 1a, 2).
Prevalence in the 100% treatment can be explained by
the following: During the first summer the 100% efficient vertical transmission to asexually-produced host
eggs [22,27,31] kept prevalence at 100%. The decrease in
prevalence in this treatment after the first winter was
likely caused by a combination of imperfect vertical
transmission into sexual eggs [27,31] and higher mortality of infected compared to uninfected resting eggs during winter diapause [22]. The slow onset of prevalence

experiment. (A) Increase of parasite prevalence across summer and

differences in seasonal disease patterns between experimental host
populations of the host Daphnia magna infected with the
microsporidium Hamiltosporidium tvärminnensis. Host populations

dynamics in the 100% treatment may further be
explained by the accumulation of parasite spores. The
high prevalence in this treatment, leads to a large pool
of infective H. tvärminnensis spores early on, acting like
a spore bank. These spores can survive several months
to a year outside their host (S. Lass & D. Ebert, personal
observation) and thus may accumulate to temporarily
high levels. In particular, high prevalence early in the
season, when high Daphnia densities lead to many dead
infected hosts, can contribute to this effect. Given
enough time it is possible that the dynamics of the
100% treatment may eventually become indistinguishable from those of the other treatments. In our experiment, four years were not enough to answer this
question. Given that the life span of most natural rock
pool Daphnia populations is very limited [33], it is unlikely that the seasonal disease patterns will have a
chance to persist for long enough to become indistinguishable in populations differing strongly in initial prevalence under conditions as in our experiment. While
we excluded host migration in our experiment, migration of Daphnia is common in natural populations
[33,34]. Uninfected immigrating Daphnia experience a
fitness benefit when invading a rockpool harbouring an
infected Daphnia population, and this advantage
becomes even larger with increasing parasite prevalence
in the resident population [35]. Thus, immigration of
Daphnia resting eggs is likely to affect prevalence patterns in natural populations and could contribute to
synchronization of prevalence dynamics in populations
with different initial prevalence.
The seasonal dynamics of Hamiltosporidium have two
components: prevalence increase over summer and prevalence reduction after host diapause. The increase in
prevalence over summer is caused by horizontal transmission of the parasite via spores from dead infected to
uninfected hosts [22]. This is a one-way road, as an
infected line cannot loose the parasite anymore as long
as it reproduces asexually. Declines in prevalence during
the summer are the consequences of low vertical transmission efficiency and higher reproductive success of
uninfected compared to infected females [31,36], which
may occur under low densities and good food condition.
Several mechanisms contribute to the prevalence
decrease associated to host diapause: First, the onset of
resting egg production early in the year when prevalence
is still low (Figure 1c) results in uninfected resting eggs
produced by uninfected females. This is consistent with
data on natural populations, showing that ephippia production peaks in mid summer [37]. This effect is
enhanced by infected females producing a higher proportion of male offspring [38] which do not transmit
the parasite and leaving more ephippia being produced
by the uninfected females. Second, infected females have

Lass et al. BMC Ecology 2011, 11:14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/11/14

a lower fecundity than uninfected females [38] which is
further manifested by our finding that ephippia from
infected populations contained about 18% fewer resting
eggs than those from uninfected populations. The difference in fecundity gains relative importance when
infected hosts compete with uninfected hosts [36]. Thus,
we speculate that a larger number of uninfected resting
eggs is produced in populations containing infected and
uninfected hosts than suggested by the proportion of
uninfected hosts at a given time. Third, infected ephippia have a higher mortality during diapause than uninfected ephippia [22]. Taken together, hatching of resting
eggs in the following spring results in prevalence which
is lower than that observed in the previous fall, i.e.
before diapause. Our study rules out a few factors that
could have contributed to the lower prevalence in
spring: First, we found no evidence for differences in the
time of hatching between uninfected and infected resting eggs. Hatchlings appeared simultaneously in all
populations in spring and thus, hatching of uninfected
and infected resting eggs was synchronized. Second, we
did not find any difference in hatching success between
infected and uninfected populations. We speculate that
also within populations, hatching success of infected
and uninfected resting eggs did not differ. Third, prevalence changes are unlikely to be caused by immigration
from other populations. We have no evidence for migration as uninfected populations remained uninfected
throughout the whole experiment and no Daphnia ever
occurred in the two additional Daphnia free containers.
Our experiment was set up to exclude a number of
confounding factors which were suggested to play a role
for disease dynamics under natural conditions. First,
host genetics have been shown to play an important
role in host susceptibility and disease persistence in
Daphnia [39-41], and epidemics have been suggested to
be terminated by rapid changes in genotype composition
of host populations [42]. We show that in the near
absence of genetic variation, parasite prevalence still
exhibited a regular increase and decrease, excluding
host genetic heterogeneity as a necessary factor for this
pattern. Our experimental populations consisted of a
single susceptible host clone during the first growing
season, which diversified after the first winter when
hosts hatched from eggs produced by selfing. Such a
low genetic diversity is not untypical for the natural
conditions in the metapopulations in southern Finland,
where new populations are frequently founded by single
Daphnia clones [24].
Second, predators, competitors and other parasites can
strongly influence host-parasite interactions and may
considerably alter disease dynamics [8,10,43]. Our previous field observations could not rule out that prevalence dynamics may have been caused by the interplay

Page 6 of 10

of multiple factors and players rather than by the interaction between one host and one parasite species. Here,
we isolated the host-parasite system from its natural
community context and still observed the same seasonal
prevalence pattern. The few potential Daphnia predators
and aquatic insect larvae that invaded temporarily into
some of the mesocosms were rare and different from
those characteristic to the Finnish rock pool communities [29,30]. We conclude that other community members thus do not substantially contribute to the regular
prevalence dynamics in this host-parasite system.
Parasite-mediated host density reduction

Infection with H. tvärminnensis reduced the density in
populations of its host D. magna. Different initial prevalence, however, was not reflected in the extent of density reduction. Comparing host population densities
during three years, we found that density in uninfected
host populations on average exceeded that of infected
populations by one third (Figure 1b). This is consistent
with theoretical [44-47], observational [2] and experimental [25,26,48-50] studies showing that parasites that
affect host fecundity can affect host population density.
Most former studies demonstrating microparasite-driven
reduction of host density in Daphnia have been conducted under constant conditions in the laboratory,
most notably under regular food supply [25,26]. Here,
we demonstrate that an effect of parasitism on host density is even detectable under outdoor conditions that
include fluctuating food supply, varying temperature and
changing water volume. A recent long-term study has
also been able to demonstrate effects of parasite infection on host population density in natural Daphnia
populations [6].
From the second year onwards infected populations
exhibited lower spring hatchling density (Figure 3) compared to uninfected populations. Several mechanisms
contributed to lower spring hatchling densities. First,
lower hatchling densities in 2004 and 2005 result from
the lower number of ephippia produced in infected
populations in previous years (Figure 1c). Population
density and number of ephippia are likely to reinforce
each other as populations of lower density are likely to
produce fewer ephippia leading to lower hatchling density. Second, we found that ephippia in infected populations include fewer resting eggs than ephippia in
uninfected populations. Third, in a previous study we
found that infected resting eggs have lower survival
probability in winter than uninfected resting eggs [22].
Lower hatchling densities in spring and reduced densities throughout the summer may have important consequences for the long term survival of infected D. magna
populations in the metapopulation our hosts and parasites originated from [23]. In this metapopulation

errors of Daphnia magna hatchlings in experimental populations
either uninfected or infected with the microsporidium
Hamiltosporidium tvärminnensis. Host populations differed in the
initial parasite prevalence in April 2002 (0%: n = 14, 5%: n = 10,
50%: n = 10 or 100%: n = 10) and were kept under outdoor
conditions. Hatchling densities were estimated in 2004 and 2005
after hatchlings had been detected in all populations.

D. magna frequently goes locally extinct [33]. The
causes for this extinction in these rock pools are often
linked to abiotic factors, such as summer droughts or
flooding by sea water. Populations may survive such
catastrophic events when sufficient numbers of viable
resting eggs are present. Our finding, that hatchling
densities in infected populations is reduced, suggests
that the parasite may contribute to population extinction in this metapopulation. Long term data on the
metapopulation dynamics and the distribution of the
parasite are needed to test this hypothesis.

Conclusions
Here, we show that the combination of well-controlled
experiments and knowledge of the biology of the hostparasite system under study allows understanding seasonal prevalence patterns. In addition to long-term observations of disease dynamics in natural populations and
mathematical models [6,7,12,22], experimental epidemiology is a powerful tool contributing significantly to
our understanding of the causes, mechanisms and consequences of disease dynamics [48,51,52].
Methods
Epidemiological experiment

We used a single D. magna clone that was the product
of out-crossing between two uninfected clones from two
rock-pool populations (4 km apart from each other) in
southern Finland. The clone was kept in the lab for four
years prior to the experiment. We used a mixture of

seven different H. tvärminnensis isolates from the Finnish rockpools to infect the host clone [53]. Infected
and uninfected Daphnia were cultured in the same way.
On April 18, 2002, the experiment was started by transferring D. magna of different age into 100-L plastic containers, which were filled with 48 L artificial medium
[modified after [54], without adding any well water,
[55]]. Infected and uninfected Daphnia were mixed to
obtain 14 populations without any infected D. magna
(0% prevalence), ten populations with 5%, ten with 50%
and ten with 100% starting prevalence. All infected
populations contained the same mixture of parasite isolates. Under natural conditions a low number of hosts
would found a population. However, as we were interested in the effect of parasite prevalence and did not
want to mingle potential effects of host population bottlenecks and parasite effects on the host population, we
started all populations with the same number of hosts,
240 D. magna (resulting in 12 infected D. magna in the
5% treatment, 120 in the 50% and 240 in the 100%
initial prevalence treatment). To avoid starvation in the
newly set up containers, we fed all populations four
times with 1 × 109 cells of the green algae Scenedesmus
obliquus during the first two weeks of the experiment.
Thereafter, food was not added again.
Containers were placed on a plain meadow in the
Botanical Garden of the University of Fribourg, Switzerland. They were arranged in a grid with equal distances
(1 m) between the containers. Every October, the containers were covered with nets (meshsize 7 mm) to prevent leaves from falling into the water, which would
have made sampling difficult. In November, water levels
were lowered to 24 L to avoid bursting of containers
due to ice, and containers were closed with a lid and
covered with a black, photo resist plastic foil to produce
complete darkness in all containers. Air flow was possible under the foil to prevent anoxic conditions. Every
spring (in March or April), the foil and lids were
removed and 24 L artificial medium were added to each
container. We had two additional containers without
Daphnia within the grid to measure the change in water
volume caused by evaporation, rain and sampling. The
mean volume of these two containers served to get an
estimate for water volume of all other containers. This
was used to estimate the total number of ephippia present in the different populations (see below). Uninfected
populations as well as the additional containers were
also used to detect if the parasite and/or the host
migrated between containers.
Sampling

After the foil had been removed each spring, populations were checked daily until the first Daphnia hatchlings occurred. From April to November, populations

Lass et al. BMC Ecology 2011, 11:14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/11/14

were sampled every other week in 2002 and 2003, every
5 weeks in 2004, three times in 2005 and once in 2006.
In 2006, we omitted sampling the uninfected populations. From 2002-2004, we alternately estimated parasite
prevalence and host population density. We mixed the
populations well prior to sampling a certain water
volume from the populations. Thus, sampling altered
host population size but did not change population density. Four litres (8 samples of 500 mL each) were taken
from each population with exception of the density samples from May 8, Jul 3, 2002, and Jul 16, 2003 when
only 2 L were sampled because of low water levels. Each
sample contained the organisms present at that time
(microorganisms, algae, Daphnia, other aquatic invertebrates that had invaded the containers), ephippia and
debris. All treatments were always sampled in the same
way.
Besides D. magna, we never found any other Daphnia
species in our mesocosms. No other endo- or ectoparasites of Daphnia were observed except for one occasion
when we found an unknown microsporidian parasite in
a single Daphnia. As this parasite grouped with a clade
of microsporidia of mosquitoes in a molecular phylogeny [56], it may have been an accidental infection originating from an immigrating mosquito. Besides,
Diptera larvae (Chironomidae and Culicidae; in 35-44 of
the 44 mesocosms), other aquatic invertebrates were
rare: Baetidae larvae (mayflies) in maximal 3 of 44
mesocosms at a time, occasionally a water strider (Gerridae), one Notonecta specimen (backswimmers) once
and on two occasions one specimen of Dytiscidae (water
beetles). The commonness of the Diptera larvae and the
rareness of other insects in our mesocosms make it unlikely that our treatments are significantly influenced by
them.
Parasite prevalence

Infection with H. tvärminnensis can be assessed via
microscopic detection (phase contrast, 400 × magnification) of the typical spores about 8-12 days after the start
of an infection or, in case of vertical transmission, at an
age of about 8 days [57]. Therefore, we kept Daphnia
sampled for prevalence estimates individually in 100-mL
jars under laboratory conditions (artificial medium, regular food supply, 20°C) for 10-14 days to ensure sufficient spore development. Fourteen animals from each
infected population were randomly chosen. If there were
less, we took all the ones present in a sample. Wetmount preparations of all Daphnia were microscopically
checked for H. tvärminnensis presence and the presence
of other parasites.
To check if the uninfected controls became contaminated by the parasite and to maximize the detection of
even low prevalence, 50-100 Daphnia (if possible,

Page 8 of 10

otherwise all that we sampled) from each uninfected
population were kept in 1 L medium for two weeks to
allow infections by possible parasites to develop. After
this incubation time, Daphnia were homogenized and
the suspension checked for parasite spores. This method
would allow finding a single infected host among 100
uninfected.
For the infected populations, we tested if prevalence
increased significantly across host growing season and if
it decreased across host winter diapause. Prior to analysis, we calculated the prevalence changes across seasons:
We took the difference between the first prevalence estimate in spring and the last in fall of the same year and
the difference between the last prevalence estimate in
fall and the first in spring of the following year. Because
the prevalence at the start of the experiment was
imposed by the treatment (and had an error variance of
zero), prevalence data from spring 2002 were omitted in
this analysis. Data were analyzed with linear mixed
effect models (LMM) accounting for heteroscedasticity
among treatments [58]. Sequential contrasts between
the treatment levels 5% and 50%, as well as 50% and
100% were used to estimate and test the difference in
prevalence increase or decrease.
Host population density

The contents of 2 L sampled from each population were
filtered (mesh size 250 μm) and preserved in 96% ethanol prior to counting. Daphnia and free ephippia were
counted using a stereomicroscope (10-20 × magnification) whereby we also recorded the presence of other
aquatic animals in the sample, if present. In order to
test if Daphnia population density depends on the treatment, we analyzed the data with a linear mixed effect
model (LMM) after log(x + 1) transformation [58]. We
excluded the two initial densities in 2002 from the analysis as all populations were started with the same density. Sequential contrasts between the treatment levels
0% and the mean of 5%, 50% and 100%, as well as 5%
and 50% and between 50% and 100% were used to estimate and test the difference in Daphnia density. The
statistical analysis took the repeated measurements from
the same populations into account, but ignored the
order of samplings.
In order to test for differences in population densities
between treatments in spring, we estimated the density
of hatchlings. We took further samples in spring 2004
and 2005, after Daphnia hatchlings had appeared in all
populations. From each population 2 L were sampled
and Daphnia were immediately counted on site. After
counting, the hatchlings were reintroduced into their
population of origin to minimize disturbance. Hatchling
densities were analyzed separately from the other host
population densities. To test for differences in spring

Lass et al. BMC Ecology 2011, 11:14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/11/14

hatchling density (log-transformed), we carried out two
one-way ANOVAs with treatment as fixed factor.
Number of ephippia and resting eggs

As H. tvärminnensis lowers reproductive success in its
host, the number of ephippia was expected to differ
between prevalence treatments. To test for such differences, ephippia were counted in the well-mixed density
sample (see above). This count was multiplied with the
ratio of water volume in the experimental population/
sample volume to obtain an estimate of the total number of ephippia for each population at that time. We
report ephippia estimates based on these samples without correction for the loss of ephippia in the previous
samples. Therefore total ephippia production is under
estimated, but to the same degree in all replicates and
thus numbers can be compared between treatments.
Due to the very dry summer 2003, water volumes were
lower than in other years, which lead to a stronger sampling effect and thus stronger underestimation of total
ephippia production. The number of ephippia (log-transformed) was analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA
with treatment as fixed factor.
Hatching success

It was not known if the presence of H. tvärminnensis
infection affects hatching of resting eggs. Such a differential hatching success could result in differences in
hatchling and population density. To test for potential
differences in hatching success in different treatments,
we estimated the proportion of resting eggs that hatched
after the first winter diapause (2002/03). We opened
ephippia taken from six populations of each treatment
in spring 2003 before the onset of sexual reproduction
(i.e. before Daphnia with ephippia were observed),
counted the resting eggs they contained and calculated
the proportion of filled loculi. Each ephippium can contain two resting eggs, i.e. has two loculi. The proportion
hatched (arcsine-transformed) was estimated as the difference between the percentages of loculi filled before
and after winter diapause and analyzed by one-way
ANOVA with treatment as fixed factor.
For all statistical analyses, we used either R including
package nlme [58] or Jmp In 5.1 [59]. Model assumptions were carefully inspected using several different
diagnostic plots.
