Evolution of electron transfer out of the cell:
comparative genomics of six Geobacter genomes
Jessica E Butler*, Nelson D Young, Derek R Lovley

Abstract
Background: Geobacter species grow by transferring electrons out of the cell - either to Fe(III)-oxides or to manmade substances like energy-harvesting electrodes. Study of Geobacter sulfurreducens has shown that TCA cycle
enzymes, inner-membrane respiratory enzymes, and periplasmic and outer-membrane cytochromes are required.
Here we present comparative analysis of six Geobacter genomes, including species from the clade that
predominates in the subsurface. Conservation of proteins across the genomes was determined to better
understand the evolution of Geobacter species and to create a metabolic model applicable to subsurface
environments.
Results: The results showed that enzymes for acetate transport and oxidation, and for proton transport across the
inner membrane were well conserved. An NADH dehydrogenase, the ATP synthase, and several TCA cycle enzymes
were among the best conserved in the genomes. However, most of the cytochromes required for Fe(III)-reduction
were not, including many of the outer-membrane cytochromes. While conservation of cytochromes was poor, an
abundance and diversity of cytochromes were found in every genome, with duplications apparent in several
species.
Conclusions: These results indicate there is a common pathway for acetate oxidation and energy generation
across the family and in the last common ancestor. They also suggest that while cytochromes are important for
extracellular electron transport, the path of electrons across the periplasm and outer membrane is variable. This
combination of abundant cytochromes with weak sequence conservation suggests they may not be specific
terminal reductases, but rather may be important in their heme-bearing capacity, as sinks for electrons between
the inner-membrane electron transport chain and the extracellular acceptor.

Background
Species of the Geobacter clade specialize in the oxidation of organic compounds to carbon dioxide coupled
to the reduction of insoluble, extracellular electron
acceptors [1]. These species play an important role in
pristine sediments and soils where they oxidize fermentation by-products like acetate and reduce naturally
occurring insoluble Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxides [1]. In
addition, they play important roles in three biotechnical
applications: they are able to degrade hydrocarbon contaminants in soils, they are able to insolubilize uranium
in contaminated aquifers, and finally, they are able to
transfer electrons from a variety of substrates onto graphite electrodes, from which electricity can be harvested
[2-4].

The mechanisms of electron transfer to Fe(III) and
extracellular electron acceptors generally are not well
understood [1]. While soluble electron acceptors like
oxygen and nitrate can diffuse into the cell, Geobacter
species must transfer electrons onto an essentially insoluble, and therefore extracellular, electron acceptor. Geobacter sulfurreducens is currently the model organism
for the Geobacteraceae family; the genome is sequenced
[5] and there is a genetic system [6]. G. sulfurreducens
completely oxidizes the electron donor acetate to carbon
dioxide via TCA cycle reactions [7]. Electrons are then
transferred into the inner membrane, presumably via
NADH dehydrogenase(s) [8], and a succinate dehydrogenase [9]. Electron transfer out of the inner membrane,
through the periplasm and outer membrane to Fe(III)
presumably requires c-type cytochromes. Several cytochromes have been shown to be required for growth by

Fe(III) reduction, both in G. sulfurreducens [10-16] and
in the other well-studied dissimilatory Fe(III) reducer,
Shewanella oneidensis [17,18]. However, a specific electron transport chain to extracellular Fe(III) has not been
determined for any organism.
The genomes of several closely related Fe(III)-reducing
organisms in the Geobacter family have recently been
sequenced. This work compares the complete or 10×coverage draft genome sequences of six species: G. sulfurreducens, Geobacter metallireducens, Geobacter uraniireducens, Geobacter bemidjiensis, Geobacter strain
FRC-32 and Geobacter lovleyi. The six Geobacter genomes were compared and conservation of electron
transport proteins was determined in order to identify
electron transport genes that may be critical for the
reduction of Fe(III) and other terminal electron acceptors, to better understand the evolution of the family,
and to help provide foundational data for modeling of
subsurface bioremediation.

Results and Discussion
Identification of the protein families in the six Geobacter
genomes

The general features of each of the six genomes are presented in Table 1. Orthologous proteins, those proteins
predicted to have similar functions in the different species, were identified by Markov clustering of sets of reciprocal best BLAST matches [19]. Using all 22,434
protein coding genes in the six genomes (see Additional
file 1), 4,062 protein families with at least two orthologs
were defined (see Additional file 2). The families contained 17,620 (79%) of all proteins. 4815 proteins were
found in only one genome, and 2,196 of these were considered to be from lateral gene transfer (see Additional
file 1) (discussed below). A functional role was associated with each family using the G. sulfurreducens in
silico model annotation [20] and COG categorization
[21].
For each protein family, its phyletic pattern - the pattern of which species encode the proteins in that family
- was determined (see Additional files 2 and 3). By far
the most common pattern was conservation across all

species, 35% of the proteins (7,774) were in families that
included at least one ortholog from each genome (see
Additional file 3). The second most common pattern
was conservation in all of the species except G. lovleyi 6% (1,246) of the proteins had this phyletic pattern (see
Additional file 3).
Forty-three protein families had at least 10 members
(see Additional file 2). Thirteen of these large families
were putative transposases which can be expected to be
present in many copies in a genome. Other large protein
families included three cytochrome families (protein
family IDs 23, 31, and 45), a nickel-dependent hydrogenase family (ID 41), and two histidine kinase sensor/regulator families (IDs 7, 39) (Table 2).
Phylogenetics

A phylogeny of the family was constructed using the
697 protein families that had a single ortholog in each
of the six genomes and the outgroup species Pelobacter
propionicus (see Additional file 4). These proteins from
each genome were concatenated then aligned, and this
alignment was used to create a Bayseian model of the
phylogeny (Figure 1). These proteins included many in
addition to the housekeeping genes classically used to
determine phylogeny, including proteins involved in
information storage, metabolism, cell signaling, and
those with no known function (see Additional file 4).
The resulting phylogeny supports 16S rDNA phylogeny
[22], and shows that the subsurface species from the
contaminated bioremediation sites, G. uraniireducens, G.
strain FRC-32, and G. bemidjiensis form a group distinct
from the model organisms (Figure 1). Analysis of the
clustering of proteins into families showed that relatively
few protein families (89, made up of 283 proteins) were
found only in the three subsurface species, including a
hydrogenase discussed below (see Additional file 5).
Conservation of acetate and hydrogen metabolism

In all Geobacter species, acetate is the primary electron
donor and it is oxidized via the TCA cycle, generating
NADH, NADPH, and reduced ferredoxin (Figure 2)
[7,23,24].

Acetate transporters were conserved in all the Geobacter species. There were two families of acetate transporters [25] that were conserved in all six species; one
family contained a single ortholog from each species
(GSU0518 in family 1057), and the second had multiple

propionicus, as the outgroup. The tree was based on a

orthologs in each species (GSU1068, GSU1070,
GSU2352 in 15) (see Additional file 6).
The genes for the eight reactions for acetate oxidation
via the TCA cycle were conserved in all species (Figure
2). All of the subunits for acetyl-CoA transferase, citrate
synthase, aconitase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, keto/oxoacid ferredoxin oxidoreductase, succinate dehydrogenase
(complex II), fumarase, and malate dehydrogenase were
conserved in all six of the species (see Additional file 6).
G. sulfurreducens, G. bemidjiensis, G. strain FRC-32,
and G. lovleyi can also use hydrogen as an electron
donor in addition to acetate. In G. sulfurreducens the
enzyme required for hydrogen oxidation has been identified as a four-subunit NiFe hydrogenase (GSU0782GSU0785) [26]. This uptake hydrogenase was not conserved in all six of the Geobacter species; orthologs to
the four subunits of this enzyme were found in three of
the species that oxidize hydrogen: G. sulfurreducens, G.
bemidjiensis, and G. lovleyi, and in one that does not: G.
uraniireducens (see Additional file 6). No orthologs to

Figure 2 Conservation of the energy metabolism pathways of Geobacter sulfurreducens. Shown are the pathways for acetate activation
and oxidation via the TCA cycle in the cytoplasm; inner membrane oxidation of TCA cycle products coupled with electron/proton transport and
ATP generation; and periplasmic and outer membrane cytochromes known to be required in vivo for transfer of electrons to an extracellular
acceptor. The genes encoding the enzymes of these pathways and their full conservation pattern across all of the Geobacter genomes are listed
in Additional file 6 of the supplementary material. The enzymes are colored black if there were orthologs for every subunit in all of the species
and red if there were not. OmcB is shown in gray because there positional but not sequence-based orthologs (see text and figure 5).

this hydrogenase were found in G. strain FRC, which
can oxidize hydrogen (see Additional file 6). However,
G. strain FRC-32 and the other species isolated from the
subsurface all encoded an additional hydrogenase, a
four-subunit hydrogenase found only in these species
(families 177, 178, 3032, and 3033, see Additional file 5).
The four genes were similar to the heterotetrameric
hydrogenase found in Pyrococcus that is a cytoplasmic,
NADP-using hydrogenase [27] (Figure 3).
After acetate or hydrogen oxidation, the electrons are
transferred into an inner-membrane bound electron
transport chain, and protons are pumped out of the
cytoplasm for ATP synthesis via an ATP synthase (Figure 2). G. sulfurreducens encodes two NADH dehydrogenases (complex I), one with 12 subunits and one with
14. This reaction is predicted to be the only one at
which protons are pumped during Fe(III) or fumarate
respiration [20]. All six Geobacter species contained
orthologs to one of these enzymes, the 14-subunit
enzyme (GSU0338-GSU0351) (see Additional file 6).
The 12-subunit enzyme was conserved in all species
except G. loveyi (see Additional file 6). The putative
NADPH dehydrogenase [28] was conserved in all six
Geobacter species (Figure 2, Additional file 6).

Regardless of whether acetate or hydrogen is the electron donor, ATP is synthesized with an inner-membrane
bound ATP synthase. G. sulfurreducens encoded one
ATP synthase enzyme in two gene clusters (GSU0108GSU0114 and GSU0333-GSU0334). All six Geobacter
species contained orthologs to all subunits of this
enzyme (Figure 2, Additional file 6).
The best conserved proteins in the Geobacter species

The level of sequence similarity among conserved proteins was estimated using bit score ratios between reciprocal orthologs [29]. 1266 G. sulfurreducens proteins
had reciprocal orthologs in every other Geobacter genome (see Additional file 7). The average bit score ratio
of these proteins was 70%. Only a small subset, 61 proteins, had an average bit score ratio of at least 90%
(Table 3). This subset of very well conserved proteins
contained housekeeping proteins, including ribosomal
proteins, translation elongation factors, Rho transcription termination factor, and amino acid biosynthetic
genes (Table 3). This set also included proteins involved
in electron transfer, including subunits of the NADH
dehydrogenase and the ATP synthase from the inner
membrane, and the citrate synthase and acetyl-CoA
transferase from the TCA cycle (Table 3). Other high-

scoring proteins (at least 85%) included subunits of
many of the other TCA cycle enzymes: succinate dehydrogenase, aconitase, malate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate oxidoreductase (see Additional file 7).
Identifying genes encoding cytochromes

After the electron donors have been oxidized and the
electrons have been transferred into the inner membrane, they must then be transferred out of the cell to
the extracellular electron acceptor like Fe(III) or electrodes. This pathway presumably requires periplasmic and
outer-membrane c-type cytochromes, an abundance of
which is the hallmark of Geobacter species [30,32-34].
Several cytochromes have been shown to be required
for optimal growth by Fe(III) reduction or on electrodes
in G. sulfurreducens: PpcA[12], MacA[13], OmcB[11],
OmcE[16], OmcF[15], OmcG[35], OmcH[35], OmcS
[16], OmcT[16], OmcX (M. Izallalan, unpublished), and
OmcZ (B.C. Kim, unpublished).
Searching all six Geobacter species genomes showed
that at least 100 ORFs in each genome contained at
least one occurrence of the motif for covalent heme
binding (CXXCH), indicating that these may be cytochromes (see Additional file 8). This was more than was
found in 16 other genomes including those of Shewanella, Desulfovibrio, Rhodoferax, and Anaeromyxobacter
species known to be cytochrome rich (see Additional
file 8). Since this definition of cytochrome is minimal, a
more stringent definition was created using 26 sequence

profiles described in the protein database Interpro as ctype cytochromes. These profiles were compared against
all of the proteins in the six Geobacter genomes. Proteins were considered cytochromes if their sequence
contained at least one profile match and at least one
CXXCH motif (see Additional file 9).
These results showed that each Geobacter genome
contained an average of 79 cytochromes (Table 4). G.
uraniireducens contained the most cytochromes, 104,
and G. lovleyi the least, 61. On average, 2.1% of the proteins encoded in the genome of each of the Geobacter
species are cytochromes (Table 4). Not only is the number of cytochromes in the genomes large, 85% of the
cytochromes contain more than one heme motif - with
7.7 hemes per cytochrome on average (Table 4).
Conservation of cytochromes

While an abundance of cytochromes are found in all of
the Geobacter species, very few were conserved in all six
species, in contrast to the excellent conservation seen
for the other energy metabolism proteins discussed
above. There were 471 cytochromes in total identified in
the six Geobacter genomes (see Additional file 9). Only
64 of the cytochromes (14%) were part of a protein
family that included at least one cytochrome from each
of the six genomes. These 64 conserved cytochromes
formed nine protein families (Table 5).
There was poor conservation across the species of
many of the cytochromes that have been shown to be

required in vivo in G. sulfurreducens for wild-type levels
of Fe(III) or electrode reduction (Figure 2). Most of the
cytochromes required in G. sulfurreducens for growth
on extracellular acceptors were not conserved in all species, including OmcE, OmcF, OmcS, OmcT, OmcX,
OmcZ, and MacA (Figure 2, Additional file 9).
Only one of the nine well-conserved cytochrome
families contained a cytochrome, PpcA, known to be
required for wild type levels of Fe(III) reduction [12]. At
least one homolog to PpcA was found in every genome,
and there were multiple homologs in most of the genomes: five in G. sulfurreducens, five in G. metallireducens,
four in G. uraniireducens, three in G. bemidjiensis, two in
G. strain FRC-32, and one in G. lovleyi (see Additional file
2). In related sulfate- and sulfur-reducing δ-Proteobacteria
species, the most abundant and best studied cytochromes
are the of the tetra-heme c3 type [36,37], while those of
PpcA family are of the tri-heme c7 type [38].
Analysis of the well-conserved cytochromes showed
that four of the nine families conserved in all species
were encoded together in a single cluster in each genome (Figure 4, Table 5). These conserved cytochromes
were predicted to be 2-heme (GSU2930), 10-heme
(GSU2934), 12-heme (GSU2935), and 5-heme (GSU
2937) (see Additional file 9). Also in this cluster were an
inner-membrane-bound b-type cytochrome (GSU2932)
and Rieske Fe-S protein (GSU2933) (Figure 4), which

were clearly homologous to the core of the cytochrome
bc complexes [39,40]. The b-type cytochrome and the
Rieske protein were also conserved in all of the genomes
(see Additional file 2). In other species, the cytochrome
bc complex (complex III) catalyzes a key step in electron
transport, that which provides the electrical link
between the inner membrane and periplasm. However,
the protein that provides this link in the Geobacteraceae
has not been characterized, making this well-conserved
cluster a good candidate for further analysis. This
enzyme is especially important because it may be a second possible location of proton pumping in the cell,
which would affect ATP yield during respiration, and
may be different depending on the electron acceptor or
on the redox potential of the cell. Typically, there is a
single c-type cytochrome associated with this enzyme,
which is a tetra-heme cytochrome in other δ-Proteobacteria [41], so the role of the multiple c-type cytochromes
in this highly-conserved cluster is novel and warrants
further investigation.
There were three other cytochrome families that were
well conserved in all six genomes: families of 3-heme, 9heme, and 12-heme cytochromes (Table 5). None of
these cytochromes have been studied.

in this family (51), all 8-heme or 9-heme cytochromes
(see Additional file 9). G. sulfurreducens, G. metallireducens, and G. uraniireducens each contain two Orf2 cytochromes. In G. sulfurreducens, the Orf2 genes are
encoded in a tandem repeat with another duplicated
cytochrome (called OmcB/OmcC) known to be important for Fe(III) reduction[11] (Figure 5). Initial examination of the OmcB/OmcC family (number 1653)
indicated it did not have complete conservation like the
Orf2 family did, but analysis of these genes in genome
context indicates that an operon of similar structure was
conserved in all six species (Figure 5). Alignment of the
orf2-omcB genome regions from all six species showed
that there was at least one operon with similarity to the
orf2-omcB operon in each genome, and furthermore,
there were tandem repeats of this operon in several of
the genomes (Figure 5). Interestingly, while the Orf2
cytochrome gene and the Orf1 gene immediately
upstream were well conserved orthologs across all species, the gene immediately downstream varied. In all
cases there was a multi-heme cytochrome encoded in
the OmcB/C spot in the operon, but the sequence similarity to OmcB/C varied (Figure 5). This indicates that
this operon may be important in all six species, though
while it appears that conservation of the sequence of the
Orf2 cytochromes is important, there may be less pressure for the larger outer membrane cytochromes to
maintain a specific sequence.

genome (see Additional file 9). In other words, they
included paralogs, which may represent duplicated cytochrome genes. The largest cytochrome family had 12
members from 5 genomes (family 23, Additional file 9).
Several families were made up of cytochromes from
only a single genome, indicating recent duplication or
triplication of the cytochrome since that species
diverged (families 3111, 3250, 3413, and 3597).
Several cytochromes known to be required for wild
type Fe(III) metabolism appeared to have been duplicated within single genomes. The OmcS family (64) had
nine members, all 6-heme cytochromes, found in four of
the Geobacter genomes (see Additional file 9). The G.
bemidjiensis genome contained four OmcS proteins, G.
sulfurreducens three, and one in both G. FRC-32 and G.
uraniireducens (see Additional file 9). The OmcZ family
(2307) contained four members from three genomes: G.
sulfurreducens had two members (see Additional file 9).
All six of the Geobacter genomes contained more than
one PpcA-like protein (Table 5).
The Orf2 cytochromes (GSU2732 and GSU2738) were
conserved across all of the Geobacter species (Table 5),
and also showed duplication. There are nine members

encoding c-type cytochromes are shown in yellow, the Fe-S cluster
protein encoding gene is shown in purple, and the cytochrome b
gene is shown in green. All of these protein are orthologs across all
of the Geobacter genomes (Table 5). The c-type cytochromes
contain 2, 10, 12, and 5 heme-binding motifs each, respectively (see
Additional file 9).

The data presented above indicates that cytochromes
are abundant in each genome, but not very well conserved across the genomes. Cytochrome duplication and
divergence appears to have played a role in these genotypes. In addition, to investigate whether cytochromes
were less well conserved because they were acquired laterally rather than inherited vertically, genes originating
from lateral gene transfer were identified using a combination of phylogenetic and BLAST-based analysis. A
neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was inferred for
every protein from the six genomes and homologous
sequences for each protein were selected from the non-

genes, orf1 (red) and orf2(gray) that is duplicated in the genome

orthologs to these genes in all six Geobacter genomes, with
orthologs colored identically. In some cases, there were multi-heme

redundant protein database. These trees were used to
identify proteins for which the nearest relative was not
from the Geobacteraceae. If the phylogeny was strongly
supported (bootstrap ≥ 50) or if the phylogeny was
weakly supported and the most similar sequence in the
non-redundant protein was not a Geobacteraceae species, the protein was considered a lateral gene transfer
candidate.
2,196 of the 21,434 proteins in these six genomes
(9.8%) were predicted to have originated from recent
transfer from a distantly related organism (see Additional file 1). Only 19 of the 472 predicted cytochromes
(4.0%) were identified as lateral gene transfer candidates
- 1 in G. bemidjiensis, 5 in G. lovleyi, 6 in G. metallireducens, 2 in G. sulfurreducens, and 3 in G. uraniireducens (see Additional file 9). None of the cytochromes
shown to be required for wild type electron transport in
G. sulfurreducens were predicted to have originated
from lateral gene transfer (see Additional file 9). These
data indicated that the abundance of cytochromes in
these six species cannot be explained by frequent lateral
gene transfer.

quinol oxidation in the inner membrane is suggested to
be a cytochrome bc complex encoded in an unique gene
cluster that is conserved in all six species. The pathways
used by the better-studied species were also found to be
conserved in the newly discovered species that predominate in subsurface environments undergoing bioremediation, suggesting that the current metabolic model for
G. sulfurreducens[20] provides a good foundation for
broader modeling of microbial metabolism in contaminated subsurfaces during bioremediation. However, the
role of the newly identified hydrogenase unique to these
subsurface species merits further investigation.
In stark contrast to the conservation of the pathway
for ATP generation from acetate is the lack of conservation of the enzymes that dispose of the electrons after
ATP production. The six Geobacter genomes contain an
average of 79 cytochrome genes each, with each cytochrome predicted to bind an average of more than 7
hemes. So an abundance of extracytoplasmic heme is
clearly important in these species. However, only 14% of
the cytochromes are conserved in all six of the genomes.
More surprisingly, even the cytochromes that have been
shown to be required in G. sulfurreducens for electron
transport to Fe(III) or electrodes are not well conserved.
Cells of G. sulfurreducens have been shown to be capable of storing ca. 1.6 × 10-17 mol electrons in the iron
of their cytochromes [42]. This has lead to the proposal
that cytochromes may act as electric capacitors, accepting and storing the electrons from energy metabolism
for short time spans in the absence of an extracellular
electron-accepting surface [43]. The data presented here
indicates that in these species there is a combination of
strong pressure to maintain many cytochrome genes
with weak pressure to maintain the sequence of most
cytochrome genes. This lack of conservation of cytochrome genes suggests that in Geobacter species there
may not be a single common pathway for electron
transport outside the cell, and that cytochromes may be
required for general Fe-bearing capacity, as sinks for
electrons between the inner-membrane electron transport chain and the extracellular acceptor.

Methods
Conclusions
The results show that the genes for oxidizing acetate
and transferring electrons to cytoplasmic carriers, and
for inner membrane electron transport, are well conserved between the Geobacter genomes. These results
indicate that the Geobacter species and their last common ancestor all oxidized acetate using the same TCA
cycle pathway that produces NADH, NADPH, and
reduced ferredoxin. These substances are then oxidized
at the inner membrane, and ATP is generated via oxidative phosphorylation. The previously unidentified site of

Sanger-sequencing of 3-Kb, 8-Kb, and 40-Kb DNA
libraries to 8-9X depth. Open reading frames and their
translations and predicted function based on automated
annotation were taken from NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.

Clustering orthologs into protein families

All proteins in the genomes were clustered into families
of orthologs and recent paralogs using OrthoMCL [19],
which uses reciprocal best similarity pairs from all-vs-all
BLAST [44] to identify orthologs and recent paralogs,
which are then clustered together across all the genomes
using the Markov clustering algorithm [45]. A functional
role was predicted for each cluster using the G. sulfurreducens in silico model annotation [20] and COG categorization [21]. The level of sequence similarity among
conserved proteins was estimated using bit score ratios
between reciprocal orthologs [29].
Phylogenetics

All the ORFs from the six genomes and the outgroup
species Pelobacter propionicus (NC_008609) were put
into orthologous groups using Hal [46], with inflation
parameters from 1.1-5.0 for the clustering algorithm.
The proteins used for the phylogeny were those that
were part of a cluster generated with any inflation value
that had exactly one member from each genome, and
are listed in Additional file 4 of the supplementary
material. All of the proteins in the cluster were concatenated and the resulting sequences aligned by ClustalW
[47]. ProtTest [48] was used to select a model of molecular evolution and MrBayes [49] was used to create a
Bayesian estimation of the phylogeny. The single gene
phylogeny was inferred from a ClustalW[47] alignment
of homologs to the large subunit of the hydrogenase
from the NCBI non-redundant database. Distances and
branching order were determined by the neighbor-joining method[50] with bootstrap values from 1000 replicates in Mega[51].
Lateral gene transfer

A phylogenetic tree was inferred using PhyloGenie [52]
for every protein from the six genomes. Homologous
sequences for each protein were selected by BLAST
from the non-redundant protein database from NCBI
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, alignments were created
with ClustalW [47], and the phylogeny was inferred
using neighbor-joining [50] and 100 bootstrapped replicates. If, for a given protein, a phylogenetic relationship
with non-Geobacteraceae was strongly-supported (bootstrap ≤ 50) or if the relationship was weakly supported
and the most similar sequence in the non-redundant
protein database from NCBI was not a Geobacteraceae
species, the protein was considered a candidate. If the

Page 10 of 12

next branch out contained a single sequence not from
Geobacteraceae species, the query gene was defined as
being from lateral transfer. If the next branch contained
a single sequence from Geobacteraceae, it was not. If
the sister group was a clade or was not strongly supported, the ancestral condition was inferred [53] and
used to determine lateral transfer.
