Abstract
Background: Deproteinized DNA from eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells still contains a lowmolecular weight peptidic fraction which can be dissociated by alkalinization of the medium. This
fraction inhibits RNA transcription and tumor cell growth. Removal from DNA of normal cells
causes amplification of DNA template activity. This effect is lower or absent in several cancer cell
lines. Likewise, the amount of active peptides in cancer cell DNA extracts is lower than in DNA
preparation of the corresponding normal cells. Such evidence, and their ubiquitous presence,
suggests that they are a regulatory, conserved factor involved in the control of normal cell growth
and gene expression.
Results: We report that peptides extracted from wheat bud chromatin induce growth inhibition,
G2 arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis in HeLa cells. The growth rate is decreased in cells
treated during the S phase only and it is accompanied by DNA damage and DNA synthesis
inhibition. In G2 cells, this treatment induces inactivation of the CDK1-cyclin B1 complex and an
increase of active chk1 kinase expression.
Conclusion: The data indicate that the chromatin peptidic pool inhibits HeLa cell growth by
causing defective DNA replication which, in turn, arrests cell cycle progression to mitosis via G2
checkpoint pathway activation.

Background
After intensive deproteinization with NaCl, SDS, chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and phenol the DNA preparation
from eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells still contains a low
molecular weight peptidic material [1]. By further treating
this preparation with alkaline buffer it is possible to
extract a pool of peptides (20 μg/mg of DNA), with a
molecular weight of about 1000 Da, consisting of

sequences with strongly related amino acid composition
[2]. Its binding to DNA is pH dependent and decreases
from pH 7.5 to 9.5 [3]. Using such a procedure of extraction, this family of peptides was found in the chromatin
of eukaryotic (calf thymus, bull spermatozoa, trout testis,
pea bud and wheat germ) [4-6] and prokaryotic (E. coli
and lambda phage) cells [7,8]. They do not seem to be the
products of proteolytic degradation occurring during the

extraction since the same peptide fraction is obtained if a
cocktail of protease inhibitors is added to all the solutions
used [9].
Independently of the source of extraction, their biological
effects are quite similar. It has previously been reported
that these peptides inhibit RNA transcription in cells and
in vitro reconstituted systems with prokaryotic and
eukaryotic RNA polymerase [10,11], and that they stabilize the structure of double-stranded DNA, thus increasing
its melting point [12]. When they are removed by alkaline
buffer from DNA of normal cells DNA template capacity
is enhanced [13] but this effect is lower or even absent in
several cancer cell lines [14]. Transcriptional data are in
agreement with the melting profile of DNA from cancer
cells which show no significant differences between acid
and alkali extracted DNA. Accordingly, the level of active
peptide fraction extracted from the DNA of cancer cells is
markedly lower than that obtained from DNA of the corresponding normal cells [15]. We have also found that the
peptide fraction is able to decrease the growth rate of
HL60 and L1210 tumour cell lines [16]. The biological
effects of this class of peptides and their ubiquitous presence in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells indicate that they
could be involved in a conserved mechanism of cell
growth control and gene expression. Their low concentration in cancer cells DNA as compared to normal cells indicates that this putative control mechanism may be lost
during carcinogenesis. It is, therefore, of interest to investigate their potential role in controlling cell proliferation.
In this paper we report the activity of DNA peptides,
extracted from wheat buds, in inhibiting the growth of
HeLa cells. In order to gain more knowledge about their
molecular mechanism of action, apoptosis induction and
the effects on cell cycle progression were also investigated.

Results
Chromatin peptide fraction inhibits cell growth
HeLa cells were incubated with different concentrations of
the chromatin peptide fraction for 24 and 48 h and the
cell number was determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion method (Fig. 1A). The concentration (5 μg/ml) that
reduced the number of the cells by approximately 40%
with respect to the controls after 24 h of incubation, was
tested further at different time points (Fig. 1B). The peptide fraction inhibits the proliferation of HeLa cells in a
concentration and time dependent manner. The growth
inhibition induced did not seem to be due to general toxicity because the number of dead cells in treated and control cultures was the same (about 5%) as revealed by the
trypan blue exclusion assay. Moreover, in order to exclude
toxicity, the activity of the lactic dehydrogenase enzyme in
the culture medium was determined. It was undetectable
even in cell cultures incubated with high concentration of

chromatin peptides where the inhibition was about 80%.
In all the subsequent experiments the cells were treated
with 5 μg of peptide fraction per ml of culture medium.
Since the peptide sequence effector/s has not been isolated, this concentration represents the total amount of
the peptides constituting the pool.
Chromatin peptide fraction induces apoptosis
Apoptosis levels were measured by using a DNA fragmentation ELISA test in cells incubated for 12, 24 and 48 h (Fig
2A). Apoptosis induction was also quantified by FACS
using a terminal (TαT) deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay
as described in Materials and Methods. After 24 h of incubation with the same peptide concentration the percentage of apoptotic cells was about 30% higher than that
found in untreated cultures. In order to investigate the
apoptotic pathway, the inactivation of PARP, the induction of caspase cleavage and the involvement of Bcl-2 family proteins were analyzed. Figure 2B shows that the
peptide treatment induced the cleavage of caspases 7 and

9 (lines a and b), PARP inactivation (line f), a higher
expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax (line c) and a
decreased level of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein (line d)
(the densitometric values are reported in Figure 2C).
These data suggest that the apoptosis process induced by
chromatin peptides is caspase dependent and involves the
mitochondria.
Effect of chromatin peptides on cell cycle progression
To determine more precisely how the chromatin peptide
fraction inhibits HeLa cell proliferation, we investigated
whether the apoptotic process was accompanied by a cell
cycle perturbation. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on cells treated for 12, 24 and 48 h with 5 μg/ml
of chromatin peptides to assess the distribution of cells in
the various phases of the cell cycle. As shown in Fig. 3A
and 3B the treatment caused an increase in the percentage
of cells in G2/M phase that was accompanied by a decrease
of the cell number in S phase. Coefficients of variation
(CVs) for the G1 peaks in the cell cycle distributions were
5%. The flow cytometry data demonstrate that the chromatin peptides arrest the cells in G2 or early M phase. It is
known that G2 arrest is induced to prevent transition to
mitosis in the presence of DNA damage [17], while early
mitotic arrest is due to the action of checkpoints that
ensure that the cells do not exit mitosis until the genome
has been properly segregated. In order to study the mechanism by which the chromatin peptides affect cell cycle
progression, we examined the position in the cell cycle of
the arrested cells. As shown in Fig 3C, the numbers of the
cells in prophase, metaphase and anaphase + telophase
were not modified by the treatment. This suggests that the
treated cells do not enter mitosis and that chromatin peptides affect the cell cycle of HeLa cells by inducing an
arrest in G2 phase. We therefore investigated the possibility that this cell-cycle block could result from DNA damage induced by the action of this peptide pool.

Selective effect of the chromatin peptides on S phase cells
Previous studies have shown that the chromatin peptides
can inhibit DNA transcription. Moreover, once extracted
from DNA, they can rebind to it in the presence of divalent cations. Consequently the action of these peptides in
modifying cell proliferation and gene expression could
possibly be a result of their effects on DNA activity. In
accordance with this hypothesis we examined whether
treatment with the peptide fraction has a selective effect
on the S phase of the cell cycle. The antiproliferative effect
was therefore evaluated by treating synchronized HeLa
cells during each single phase. Synchronization was performed by the double thymidine block that arrests the
cells at the G1/S boundary, while the removal of thymidine induces the onset of S phase [18]. The duration of S
phase was examined by determination of 3H-thymidine
uptake into DNA immediately after removal of thymidine

block, at 1 hour intervals. The time course of thymidine
incorporation (data not shown) indicates that uptake of
3H-thymidine initiated 1 h after the removal of the thymidine block, reached a maximum after 6 h and dropped to
the initial level after 8 h. The cells were also counted to
establish the mitosis time point. Their number remained
constant for nine hours after the release of the block. At 11
h the number of the cells doubled indicating that cell division was completed. The position of the cells in the cell
cycle was assessed by flow cytometry analysis performed
at 1 h, 6 h and 8 h after removal of the thymidine block
(Fig. 4A). In order to verify whether the synchronization
method interferes with the antiproliferative action of the
chromatin peptides, synchronized cells were incubated
for the whole cell-cycle (23 h) with different concentration of the peptide pool. A dose dependent inhibition of
cell growth was obtained also after synchronization and
its level was comparable to that reported for unsynchronized cells (data not shown). The treatment in S phase
was carried out by incubating the cells with the peptide
fraction for 3 hours starting at 3 h after removal of the thymidine block. Then the medium containing the peptide
fraction was replaced with normal medium and the cells
were counted at the end of M phase. The inhibition was
calculated as percentage of the control cells grown in the
same way.

The treatment during S phase induced a dose-dependent
inhibition, while no differences in cell number were
obtained when the cells were incubated with the peptide
fraction during the G2 phase. No further increase in
growth inhibition was obtained when the treatment was
carried out for the period corresponding to S + G2 phases
except when a high dose of peptides was used (Fig. 4B).
The treatment during G1 phase was performed in HeLa
cells synchronized by the serum starvation method. With
this method the replacement with the normal medium
releases the cells at the G0/G1 boundary [19]. The peptide
fraction was added at this time point and the cells were
counted after 23 hours of treatment. In this situation the
percentage of growth inhibition is about 38%. No growth
inhibition was obtained when the cells were incubated
with the peptide fraction during G1 phase only (15 hours
of treatment) and allowed to grow in normal medium
until the end of mitosis (data not shown). These data indicate that the major effect of cell growth inhibition by chromatin peptides is obtained when cells are treated in S
phase. It suggests that their effect on cell growth is exerted
by targeting a mechanism specific to S phase. To support
this hypothesis we tested the effect of the chromatin peptide fraction on DNA synthesis. At 6 hours after the
removal of the double thymidine block,3H-thymidine
incorporation in the presence of chromatin peptides
showed about 45% inhibition as compared with the controls. This result is consistent with the reported sensitivity

in the S phase of HeLa cells indicating that these peptides
interfere with the DNA template capacity. It is thus reasonable to hypothesize that DNA damage could be
induced by the treatment. DNA damage was therefore
checked by exposing S phase cells to the chromatin peptides at 1 h after the removal of the thymidine block for 2
hours. They were harvested and subjected to Comet assay
under different pH conditions. When the cells are lysed
and subjected to electrophoresis under neutral conditions
only double strand breaks are detected. Under alkaline
conditions, because of DNA denaturation, single strand
breaks are also detected [21]. The peptide treatment
induces increased DNA migration only in the alkaline
Comet assay (Fig. 5). The tail moment, expressed as Arbitrary Units, was in the range of 4–14 for control cells and
44–82 for treated cells. These data indicate that DNA
damage results in the formation of single strand breaks
and support the hypothesis that DNA template activity is
the target for the chromatin peptides. The first step of their
action could be inhibition of DNA synthesis.
Chromatin peptides cause inactivation of CDK1-cyclin B1
complex
It is well known that eukaryotic cells arrest in G2 in
response to DNA damage during S phase. This cell cycle
arrest is crucial to avoid entry into mitosis of cells with

of the S phase cells to the chromatin peptide treatment

It has earlier been reported that the chromatin peptide
fraction binds to DNA and inhibits RNA synthesis and
DNA replication in cells and in cell free systems [6,11,20].
Here we show that the treatment decreases DNA synthesis

genomic defects. The G2/M transition is under the control
of the CDK1 kinase whose activity depends on its association with the regulatory subunit cyclin B1. In cycling cells,
cyclin B1 synthesis begins in late S-early G2 phase. The
formed complex is not active because of inhibitory phosphorylation at Thr14 and Tyr15 by Myt 1 and wee1
kinases [22]. In order to study the mechanism by which
HeLa cells arrest in G2 after peptide fraction treatment, the
status of the CDK1-cyclinB1 complex was investigated.
Asynchronously growing cells were incubated for 24
hours with the peptide fraction and the expression of cyclin B1 determined by flow cytometric analysis in G2 cells
selected on the base of their DNA content. Fig. 6A shows
that the level of cyclin B1 per cell is 1.5 higher in G2/M
treated cells compared to the controls. We then analyzed
whether the CDK1-cyclin B1 was in the active status by
measuring its kinase activity. Synchronized cells were
incubated with the chromatin peptide fraction at 1 hour
after removal of thymidine block. They were harvested in
the G2 phase (at 8 h) and the CDK1-cyclin B1 complex
was purified from nuclear extracts. Despite the higher
level of CDK1-cyclin B1 expression, its kinase activity was
3.4 times lower in treated cells compared with controls
(Fig. 6B). This suggests that the peptide chromatin fraction causes inactivation of CDK1-cyclin B1 complex in G2
cells. To support these data the expression level of the
inactive phospho-Tyr15 cdc2 in the same extract was evaluated. In Fig. 6C it is shown that it is effectively higher
(1.5 times) in the treated cells compared to the controls
(line a).
Involvement of the G2 checkpoint control in the cell cycle
arrest induced by chromatin peptides
Many authors have reported that DNA damage induces G2
arrest by activation of a molecular circuit, known as the G2
checkpoint control pathway which monitors DNA integrity prior to mitosis at the G2/M transition. DNA damage
activates the DNA-PK/ATM/ATR kinases which phosphorylate chk1 at Ser 345, chk2 at Thr 68 and p53. The activated chk kinases inactivate cdc 25 phosphatase via
phosphorylation at Ser 216. This blocks the activation of
CDK1-cyclin B1 kinase and the progression into mitosis
[22]. Since cells exposed to the peptide fraction showed
both DNA damage and G2 arrest, the induction of this
pathway was hypothesized to explain the mechanism of
action of the peptides. The activation of the G2 checkpoint
control was investigated by examining the activation of
the chk1 kinase in G2 cells. Fig. 6C (line b) shows the
expression of the active Chk1 kinase measured in nuclear
extract carried out, as described above, in synchronized
cells 8 hours after removal of the thymidine block. It
results in 1.7 times more chk1 expression in treated cells
compared to the controls. This is consistent with the
increase of expression of the inactive CDK1-cyclin B1
complex and the decrease of its kinase activity observed

after the treatment. These results support the hypothesis
that DNA damage, induced by exposing HeLa cells to the
pool of chromatin peptides, results in G2 arrest via the G2
checkpoint control pathway.

Discussion
A class of small peptides that remains associated with
extensively deproteinized DNA of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells has previously been described in the literature.
The biological activity of these peptides shows that they
might represent a novel factor, shared by prokaryotic and
eukaryotic cells, and active in the regulation of gene
expression and cell growth. Interestingly, tumor cells
express a lower level of this class of peptides as compared
to the corresponding normal cells, therefore we hypothesized a role for them in the prevention of cellular transformation. Similar characteristic features have been reported
for another phylogenetically ancient system of peptidergic
regulation based on a pool of peptides derived from the
proteolysis of functional proteins [23,24]. They too,
might be involved in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and hence, in carcinogenesis and tumor cell growth.
This pool is tissue specific but species un-specific. Lastly, a
series of small endogenous peptides that are N-substituted
at the N-terminal end has been described as factors with a
modulating effect on cell proliferation and differentiation: the hemoregulatory pentapeptide [25]; the epidermal pentapeptide [26]; the colon mitosis inhibitor [27]
and the hepatic pentapeptide [28]. They show tissue specificity and can inhibit even the growth of malignant cells
derived from the tissue organ from which they were isolated. Common to all three groups of peptides is that at
present their target and the molecular mechanism of
action are almost unknown.
In the present study, we wanted to provide some insight
into the role of the afore-mentioned pool of chromatin
peptides in inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells. The
results revealed that peptides isolated from wheat bud
chromatin inhibit HeLa cells growth in a dose and time
dependent manner. This effect is not due to general toxicity, but to the induction of the apoptotic process. The
association of this class of peptides with the DNA and its
ability to affect DNA and RNA synthesis in cell free systems suggests that it brings about a defective DNA template activity. Maximum inhibition of cell growth is
obtained when the cells are treated during the S phase and
it is accompanied by DNA single strand breaks and DNA
synthesis inhibition. Eukaryotic cells have developed
checkpoint control pathways for sensing DNA lesions to
ensure a correct transmission of genetic information [29].
The activation of these pathways induces an arrest of the
cell-cycle progression that allows time for removing
defects or eliminating damaged cells. While normal cells,
when exposed to genotoxic agents, are capable of arresting
in G1 and G2 phases, most cancer cells have lost this abil-

http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/8/1/55

ity. The possibility of recovering these functions might be
a useful strategy in controlling their growth. We have
shown that treatment for 12, 24 and 48 hours with 5 μg/
ml peptide concentration results in an increase of G2/M
cell number accompanied by a decrease in the percentage
of cells in S phase. The distribution of the cells in the different phases of mitosis showed no accumulation of cells
in any mitotic phase. This indicates that the cell cycle
block occurs in G2 before the entry of the cell into mitosis.
These results are consistent with the reported data on
DNA damage and DNA synthesis inhibition. Thus, many
authors have reported that genotoxic agents induce an
arrest of the cell cycle in G2 phase [30,31]. A key element
in controlling the progression to mitosis is the CDK1-cyclin B1 complex, a kinase conserved in all eukaryotes,
which is therefore the target of most antiproliferative signals generated during S and G2 phase. Its activity is maintained at low levels during G1 and S phases, while a rapid
increase is required for entry into mitosis. Several mechanisms are responsible for the regulation of CDK1-cyclin
B1 activity during cell cycle: the synthesis of cyclin B1 to
form the active complex, the inhibitory phosphorylation
in the active site of the enzyme and the expression of
inhibitors. Our data show that cyclin B1 accumulates in
G2 treated cells while the CDK1-cyclin B1 kinase activity
level is lower in comparison to the controls. This suggests
that treated cells fail to activate this complex.
DNA damage or incomplete DNA replication results in
the inhibition of this kinase activity via the activation of
the G2 checkpoint control. This pathway prevents mitotic
entry in the presence of genomic defects and ensures the
proper transmission of genetic information from a cell to
its daughters. In eukaryotic cells the ataxia-telangiectasia
mutated (ATM) and ATM-related (ATR) protein kinases
are activated in response to DNA damaging agents such as
ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light and DNA replication
inhibitors. They activate chk1 and chk2 protein kinases
responsible for the inhibition via phosphorylation of the
cdc25 phosphatase. It mediates the removal of the inhibiting phosphorylations on Tyr15 and Thr14 within the
CDK1 ATP-binding domain. Consequently, activation of
chk1 and chk2 leads to the inhibition of CDK1-cyclinB1
complex, which results in cell-cycle arrest prior to mitosis.
We have shown that the treatment of the cells in S phase
induces in G2 phase cells an increase of the expression of
the active Chk1 kinase and of the inactive phospho-Tyr15
CDK1 kinase in G2 phase cells. This strongly indicates that
the G2 checkpoint control pathway is involved. p53's role
in the inhibition of the CDK1-cyclin B1 kinase complex at
the G2 checkpoint has been reported [32]. However cells
lacking p53 are shown to be capable of a G2 arrest by activating the part of the pathway that is p53-independent
[33]. HeLa cells are p53 negative because they express
HPVE6 protein which leads to the rapid degradation of
p53 [34]; therefore it is likely that the observed G2 arrest is
Page 7 of 11

Molecular Cancer 2009, 8:55

http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/8/1/55

due to the activation of the p53-independent checkpoint
control pathway. Cells which have initiated a G2/M checkpoint pathway in response to DNA damage can undergo a
variety of fates including a prolonged arrest, re-entry into
the cell cycle after DNA repair, apoptosis or progression
through the cell cycle without repairing the DNA damage
responsible for the arrest. In our system G2 arrest is accompanied by apoptosis, so it is quite likely that there is a
close relationship between the two processes. This is consistent with a quantity of evidence by other authors showing that inactivation of CDK1 is related to apoptosis
induction [35]. When we counted the mitotic phases we
also found many cells with apoptotic morphology in G2
phase. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that most of the
cells stained by TdT had a double DNA content. These
findings suggest that, while a certain fraction of the cells
in G2 are quite unaffected and continue through G2 and
M, a number of cells that are blocked in G2 undergo apoptosis. The apoptosis pathway has been shown to be caspase dependent and to involve the activation of Bax, a
likely consequence of the inability of the arrested cells to
repair the genomic defects and to re-enter the cell cycle.
On the basis of the data shown here, we assume that the
pool of peptides inhibits HeLa cell proliferation by causing DNA damage or incomplete DNA replication which,
in turn, activates the G2 checkpoint pathway that arrests
the cell prior to mitosis. Preliminary results show that the
cells that survive peptide treatment undergo G2 arrest also
after the removal of the peptides from culture medium,
thus suggesting that the effects on cell cycle progression
are not reversible. These effect seem to be specific for these
sequences since some DNA binding peptides (pyroGluAla-Glu-Ser-Asn, pyroGlu Ala-Gly-Glu-Ser-Glu-Asp, pyroGlu-Ala-Gly-Glu-Glu-Ser-Asn, pyroGlu-Ala-Gly-Glu-GluGlu-Glu-Ser-Asn) and some known biologically active
peptides (thymosin α1 fragment 25–28, serum thymic factor), used as control, didn't reproduce the regulatory activity on cell growth shown by the native chromatin peptides
[36].

is deleted following oncogenic activation. These observations indicate that the molecular models proposed for
some of the sequences forming our pool of peptides
could: i) play a role in DNA replication/transcription
activity ii) open for the possibility that the pool of peptides could be generated from a proteolytical process of
non-histone proteins, since chromatin bound proteases
have been reported by several authors [37]. However, synthetic peptides, synthesized on the basis of the proposed
models, exhibit effects on RNA synthesis in cell free systems quite similar to those obtained with the native fraction, but were inactive at cellular level. These data suggest
that although the proposed sequences might be effectors
present in the family of the native peptides, further structural analyses are needed to explain the reported effects on
cell growth. We also speculate that the inability of the proposed structures to affect cell proliferation is due to their
poor bio-availability for cell treatment and that they are
present in the native pool in a complexed form which is
more effective for cell interaction.

In a previous study the structural characterization of two
peptide sequences belonging to the pool of this class of
peptides extracted from trout testis chromatin active in
inhibiting DNA transcription was reported. These structures [pyroGlu-Ala-Gly-Glu-Asp-Ser(P)-Asp-Glu-Glu-Asn
and pyroGlu-Ala-val-Glu-Asp-Ser(P)-Asp-Glu-Asp-Thr] or
very similar sequences are present in the portion corresponding to the phosphorylation site for CKII kinase of

Methods

Studies are in progress to better clarify the structure-function relationship of chromatin peptides by including further steps in their purification procedure and by
improving HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis experiments. The overall goal is to obtain different molecular
models of peptide sequences.

Conclusion
In conclusion we have found a new class of DNA-binding
peptides that are able to inhibit the cell cycle by inducing
DNA damage, and to promote apoptosis in HeLa cells.
The reported regulatory effects on the growth of a tumor
cell line are consistent with their ubiquitous presence in
normal cells and their lower level in cancer cells and thus
support the hypothesis that they are relevant in carcinogenesis. Further studies to understand their involvement
in cell proliferation may be helpful in elucidating neoplastic transformation.

Purification of peptides from wheat bud chromatin
The isolation of peptides from plant tissues has been
already described in detail [6]. Briefly, the chromatin was
purified at slightly acidic pH and then subjected to alkaline extraction by adding ammonia to pH 9.5. The macromolecules were precipitated with two volumes of
methanol and removed by centrifugation. The peptide
component was purified from the supernatant by ion
exchange and gel filtration chromatography.
Cell culture
HeLa cells (from ATCC cell lines, catalogue number CCL2) were tested for mycoplasms by using Mycoplasma
Detection Kit (Roche Germany). They were grown in 25

cm2 flasks with 5 ml of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle
Medium with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin at 100
units/ml, streptomycin at 100 μg/ml and 2 mM glutamine
(Invitrogen Paisley UK) at 37°C humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2/95% air. The peptides were added to the culture medium 24 hours after cell seeding (25000 cells/
cm2). Cell numbers were monitored by direct counting
using a hemocytometer. Cell viability was assessed by
trypan blue exclusion and by the determination of lactic
dehydrogenase activity in the culture medium. The
enzyme assay was performed by incubating different
amount of culture medium with 0.2 M K-phosphate
buffer pH 7.6 containing 0.2 mM pyruvic acid and 0.2
mM NADH. All chemicals were obtained from SigmaAldrich corp. (St Louis MO). The reaction was followed by
measuring the absorbance decrease of NADH at λ = 340
nm. All the experiments with cells were performed in triplicate.
Cell synchronization by double thymidine block
HeLa cells in logarithmic growth (10000/cm2 cell density)
were synchronized by a double thymidine block as
described by Kozaki et al [18]. After seeding, they were
allowed to grow for 6 h, then the medium was removed
and the cells were exposed successively to 2 mM thymidine (Sigma) for 16 h, to normal medium for 8 h, and to
2 mM thymidine for 16 h. The subsequent replacement
with normal medium released the cells at the G1/S boundary.
Incorporation of 3H-thymidine into DNA
Synchronized cells were grown at 10000/cm2 cell density
and 3H-thymidine incorporation was determined at different time points after the removal of the thymidine
block by incubating the cells with 1 μCi/ml of 3H-thymidine (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) for 1 h. Then,
the radioactive medium was removed, the cells fixed in
methanol for 10 min, washed twice with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min and solubilized with a solution of
1% trichloroacetic acid and 0.3 N NaOH. Incorporation
of radioactive thymidine was measured by liquid scintillation counting.
Cell cycle analysis
Trypsinized cell suspensions were fixed in 80% ethanol.
The samples were then placed at -20°C until cell cycle
analysis. Nuclei were isolated from fixed cell suspensions
using Vindeløv's protocol [38] stained with propidium
iodide (50 μg/ml), and samples analyzed for DNA content (PI red fluorescence) using a FACSCalibur laser flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems,
San Jose, CA). Pulse-processed fluorescence signals were
used to exclude doublets and aggregates from analyses.
Ten thousand events were acquired for each sample. Percentages of cells in the G1, S, and G2M phases of the cell

http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/8/1/55

cycle were quantified using WinCycle software (Phoenix
Flow Systems, San Diego, CA).
Quantification of apoptosis
Apoptotic response to peptide exposure was quantified
using the TUNEL method for apoptosis detection. Briefly,
apoptotic DNA fragments in control and treated samples
were end-labeled with biotin-conjugated dUTP via terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and detected using
streptavidin-FITC [39]. Cells were counterstained with 5
μg/ml propidium iodide to stain cellular DNA. The resulting labelled apoptotic fractions were quantified in control
and treated cell samples using a FACSCalibur laser flow
cytometer (BDIS, San Jose, CA), after appropriate gating
using pulse-width analysis of the DNA content signal to
exclude doublets and aggregates.
ELISA detection of cytoplasmic nucleosomes
Apoptosis levels were measured in exponentially growing
cells using the cell death detection ELISA kit (Boehringer
Mannheim Ge), following the instructions of the manufacturer. The photometric enzyme-immunoassay allows
in vitro quantification of mono- and oligonucleosomes in
the cytoplasm derived from apoptosis. The results are
expressed as percentage of optical density, resulting from
the activity of the peroxidase-conjugated anti-DNA antibody complexed with cytoplasmic nucleosomes of treated
cells, compared with the control.
Detection of cell cycle regulatory proteins using flow
cytometry
Cells (2 × 106) were trypsinized, washed twice with 10
mM phosphate buffer (PBS) and fixed in 90% ethanol.
After washing in PBS the pellet was treated with PBS plus
0.1% Triton X and resuspended in 100 μl PBS containing
0.1% Triton X100 plus 3% non-fat dry milk. Primary antibodies (cdc2, cyclin B1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were
added to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml, and allowed to
incubate on ice for 1 hour. Suspensions were then washed
in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X100. Pellets were resuspended and incubated with PBS containing 0.1% Triton
X100, 3% non-fat dry milk, and biotinylated horse-antimouse IgG (1:50 dilution of stock, Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) for 30 minutes. Suspensions were then washed
in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X100. Pellets were resuspended and incubated with PBS containing 0.1% Triton
X100, 3% non-fat dry milk, and streptavidin-FITC (1:50
dilution of stock, Amersham Biosciences, UK) for 30 minutes. Suspensions were again washed in PBS containing
0.1% Triton X100, and then resuspended in 5 μg/ml propidium iodide made up in PBS containing 0.1% Triton
X100, to stain DNA. Samples were then run on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer, and correlated analyses of cell cycle
proteins and DNA content (to allow for cell cycle analysis)
were generated.

Preparation of proteins from nuclear extracts
Nuclei purification was performed from exponentially
growing HeLa cells as previously described [40]. The cells,
harvested by trypsinization and washed twice with PBS,
were kept for 8 min at 4°C in a solution (1 ml/2 × 107
cells) containing 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM
MgCl2, 3 mM DTT and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. An equal volume of 1.4 M sucrose was added and the resulting suspension centrifuged at 11000 rpm for 10 minutes
(microcentrifugette ALC 4214 rotor A-12). The nuclei
contained in the pellet were resuspended in a sample
buffer solution (1 ml/2 × 107 cells) containing 50 mM
TRIS HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA,
0.01% Brij35, 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF,
0.05 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM Na-orthovanadate and 25
mM β-glycerophosphate. Nuclear proteins were recovered
in the super after centrifugation at 11000 rpm for 1 hour
(microcentrifugette ALC 4214 rotor A-12) and used for
SDS-PAGE.

mM Na2EDTA, 10 mM TRIS, 10% DMSO 1% Triton X 100
pH 10) for 1 h at 4°C. After 20 min of incubation in electrophoresis buffer (0.3 M NaOH, Na2EDTA 1 mM) the
slides were subjected to electrophoresis for 20 min at 25 V
and 300 mA. Following electrophoresis the slides were
rinsed in neutral buffer (0.4 M TRIS-HCl pH 7,5) and
stained with ethidium bromide to examine the DNA
migration. Neutral comet assay was performed as
described in [43]. The slides were placed in a lysing solution consisting of 30 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, pH 8.0 at
50°C for 4 h. They were then washed in TBE buffer (90
mM TRIS, 2 mM EDTA, 90 mM boric acid, pH 8.5) for 16
h and then subjected to electrophoresis in TBE buffer at 25
volts for 20 min. The slides were rinsed and stained as
above. Tail moment was calculated using Comet assay II
image analysis system (Perceptive Instrument UK) fitted
with a fluorescence microscope.

SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting
The proteins (40 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE on
12.5% acrylamide gels according to Laemmli [41] and
were transferred to nitrocellulose filters by using 25 mM
Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol at 100 V for 1 h,
according to Towbin et al [42]. Nitrocellulose sheets were
incubated overnight with anti-phospho-CDK1 (Tyr15),
anti-phospho-chk1 (Ser345), anti-phospho-Bcl-2 rabbit
polyclonal IgG antibodies and with anti-Bax, anti-cleaved
caspase-7, anti-cleaved caspase-9 and anti-cleaved PARP
rabbit polyclonal IgG antibodies. They were then incubated with a secondary anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked antibody. All antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling
(Beverly, MA) and diluted following the instructions of
the manufacturer. The blots were then developed with
LumiGLO chemiluminescent reagent (Sigma) and the
blot bands quantified using the NIH Image densitometry
program.
CDK1 kinase assay
CDK1 activity was measured by MESACUP cdc2 Kinase
Assay Kit (MBL, Japan) following the manufacturer
instructions. The kit is based on ELISA assay that utilizes a
synthetic peptide as substrate and a monoclonal antibody
recognizing the phosphorylated form of the peptide.
Incorporation of radioactive thymidine was measured by
liquid scintillation counting.
Single cell gel electrophoresis assay (Comet assay)
Cultured cells were harvested by trypsinization and
washed twice with PBS. They were then dispersed and
immobilized in LMP agarose gel on microscope slides.
The detection of comet formation was carried out under
different pH conditions. In the alkaline comet assay [21]
the slides were placed in a lytic solution (2.5 M NaCl, 100
