Abstract
Background: Acinetobacter baumannii has recently emerged as a significant global pathogen, with a surprisingly
rapid acquisition of antibiotic resistance and spread within hospitals and health care institutions. This study
examines the genomic content of three A. baumannii strains isolated from distinct body sites. Isolates from blood,
peri-anal, and wound sources were examined in an attempt to identify genetic features that could be correlated to
each isolation source.
Results: Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multi-locus sequence typing and antibiotic resistance profiles
demonstrated genotypic and phenotypic variation. Each isolate was sequenced to high-quality draft status, which
allowed for comparative genomic analyses with existing A. baumannii genomes. A high resolution, whole genome
alignment method detailed the phylogenetic relationships of sequenced A. baumannii and found no correlation
between phylogeny and body site of isolation. This method identified genomic regions unique to both those
isolates found on the surface of the skin or in wounds, termed colonization isolates, and those identified from
body fluids, termed invasive isolates; these regions may play a role in the pathogenesis and spread of this
important pathogen. A PCR-based screen of 74 A. baumanii isolates demonstrated that these unique genes are not
exclusive to either phenotype or isolation source; however, a conserved genomic region exclusive to all sequenced
A. baumannii was identified and verified.
Conclusions: The results of the comparative genome analysis and PCR assay show that A. baumannii is a diverse
and genomically variable pathogen that appears to have the potential to cause a range of human disease
regardless of the isolation source.

Background
Acinetobacter baumannii remains a significant and difficult-to-treat pathogen that causes a range of interactions
with the human host from asymptomatic colonization and
carriage in the intestinal tract, respiratory tract and skin to
invasive infection, such as septicemia, that can result in
death. Since the identification of A. baumannii as an
emerging pathogen, there has been great interest in the
rapid development of antimicrobial resistance and

nosocomial spread [1,2]. The rapid transmission and subsequent infection of patients with multi-drug resistant
(MDR) A. baumannii has become a major concern in hospitals and other health care facilities [2]. A. baumannii isolates, which routinely cause nosocomial pneumonia, and
bacteremia [3-5], have the potential to be resistant to all
known antimicrobials [6,7]. The one compounding factor
to the rapid spread of antimicrobial resistance is the high
transmission rate of A. baumanni, especially in the hospital and health care setting [8-10]. These factors have
prompted research into the identification of antibiotic
resistance markers and subsequent treatment of nosocomial infections (recently reviewed in [11]).

While the examination of A. baumannii spread and
acquisition of antimicrobial resistance has been the
topic of many studies, surprisingly little is known about
the pathogenesis of this organism. As would be expected
of a mucosal pathogen, biofilm formation has been
demonstrated as a virulence factor both for colonization
[12] and the resistance of host factors [13]. Russo et al.
[12] identified a carbohydrate biosynthesis pathway, as
well as a protein tyrosine kinase, as virulence factors by
using a transposon screen and survival in a rat soft tissue model. This complements the findings by Choi
et al. that complex carbohydrates were required in the
formation of a complex biofilm [14] that is required for
full virulence [13]. Few non-carbohydrate features have
been conclusively identified as virulence factors. One
study demonstrated that the outer membrane protein of
A. baumannii (AbOmpA) mediates the interaction of
epithelial cells and pathogen resulting in persistence of
A. baumannii in blood [15]. Additionally, mutation of
the phospholipase D gene resulted in a decreased ability
to invade epithelial cells in vitro but did not affect the
lung bacterial load in vivo [16]. These initial studies
have provided limited, but significant insight into the
virulence factors of A. baumannii. However, further
detailed studies will be required to more completely
understand the pathogenesis and regulatory networks of
A. baumannii.
Unlike many other emerging pathogens, A. baumannii
quickly had genomic sequence generated and now complete genome sequences are available for six A. baumannii
isolates, with another eight available in draft form (Additional File 1, Table S1). A range of important isolates have
been sequenced, including MDR A. baumannii isolates, in
addition to those that are susceptible to antimicrobials.
These datasets have provided the opportunity for comparative studies that examine the MDR phenotype [17-19].
Comparative genomic analyses have focused on large antibiotic resistance islands (RI), such as the 86-kb region
found in A. baumannii strain AYE (AbaR1) [20], a shorter
region found in A. baumannii strain ACICU (AbaR2) [18],
the AbaR3 region found in A. baumannii strain AB0057
[19], the AbaR5 region found in A. baumannii strain 3208
[21], and the AbaR6 and AbaR7 regions that consist of
deletions compared to AbaR5 [22]. These regions are
interesting in that they are chromosomally encoded,
encode multiple antibiotic resistance mechanisms and are
thought to derive from the integration of plasmids or
other mobile elements from other un-related pathogens.
Antibiotic susceptible A. baumanii isolates can lack these
RIs [20,23], suggesting that this region may be important,
but perhaps not absolutely required, for the observed antibiotic resistance in every isolate. A recent study has
demonstrated that the positive regulation of the AdeL regulator for the AdeFGH resistance-nodulation-cell division

Page 2 of 12

(RND) efflux pump contributes to the multidrug resistance phenotype [24]; the AdeABC [25] and AdeIJK [26]
efflux systems have also been demonstrated to contribute
to a MDR phenotype. These operons are often present in
drug susceptible isolates, which demonstrates that is it not
the mere gene presence that aids to confer the MDR phenotype, but rather the expression, and in some cases the
over-expression, of the efflux pumps that results in the
MDR phenotype [24-26]. Further transcriptomic analysis
of A. baumannii will be required to fully elucidate the
mechanisms responsible for the observed resistance
phenotype.
Most genomic studies of A. baumannii have focused on
the genomic composition of invasive isolates [17-20]. The
present study includes a comparative analysis of genomes
from both invasive and colonization phenotypes to determine if genomic differences could be responsible for the
differences in tissue tropism. The A. baumannii genome,
from antimicrobial resistant or sensitive isolates, contain a
relatively large number of mobile elements suggesting
there are mechanisms for rapid integration of foreign DNA
that may expand the host range and/or virulence of this
pathogen. In this study, draft genome sequences were
obtained from isolates of A. baumannii from human
blood, peri-anal, and wound samples. The isolates were
demonstrated to be different with multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
methods. Further analysis with comparative whole genome
sequencing and comparative genomics approaches were
employed to determine how these isolates are related in a
phylogenetic context, and to identify genomic regions that
may aid in establishing colonization and/or invasive
infection.

Methods
Cohort Description

The University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) is
a 656-bed tertiary-care hospital located in Baltimore,
Maryland, with a 19 bed surgical intensive care unit
(SICU) and a 29 bed medical intensive care unit (MICU)
that provides care to adult patients who have acute or
potentially life-threatening medical conditions. This
study utilized an existing and ongoing prospective cohort
of adult patients admitted to the SICU and MICU at the
UMMC from January 2008 to June 2008 who had routine
(admission, weekly and discharge) peri-anal surveillance
cultures obtained [27]. Bloodstream isolates were
obtained from cohort participants with an imipenemresistant A. baumannii blood stream infection (BSI).
Peri-anal samples for culture were obtained using Staplex
II cotton swabs (Staplex, Etobiocoke, Ontario, Canada),
which are used to swab the peri-anal area in a circular
motion moving from the rectum out [27]. Surveillance
swab cultures were stored by placing swabs in tryptic soy

Sahl et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:291
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/291

broth containing 30% glycerol and stored at -80°C to
allow for future recovery of isolates [28].
A. baumannii isolation

Clinical isolates (blood and wound) were isolated from
UMMC’s microbiology laboratory using standard procedures. Peri-anal swabs were cultured for A. baumannii in
the research laboratory by streaking swabs onto MacConkey agar (Remel, Lenexa, KS) supplemented with 6 µg/ml
of imipenem and incubated at 37°C for 24 to 48 hours.
Recovery of organisms from archived frozen peri-anal specimens has been shown to be 98% effective [28]. Non-lactose fermenting organisms (white colonies on MacConkey
agar) were further identified as A. baumannii using API
NE 20 Identification Strips (BioMérieux Inc.; Hazelwood,
MO, USA) or Vitek II (BioMerieux, Durham, NC).
Strain selection

We selected one isolate from blood, peri-anal swab and a
wound for further characterization. These three isolates
selected were all isolated during a time period in 2008
where a localized outbreak of A. baumannii was ongoing
at the UMMC. UMB001 was a virulent outbreak strain
isolated from the blood of a patient in the SICU; UMB002
was a strain isolated from a peri-anal sample that was not
part of the outbreak but was isolated at the same time in
the MICU; UMB003 was also present at the time of the
outbreak, but was isolated from a wound sample and was
not related to the outbreak strain. In addition to the isolates selected for genome sequencing, a collection of 74
A. baumannii isolates was used for the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) screening of genomic markers specific to
either invasive or colonization isolates (see below). This
collection included 20 randomly sampled peri-anal surveillance isolates collected as part of an ongoing cohort of
intensive care patients; 18 isolates were collected from
February to May 2008 and 2 isolates were historical isolates (2006 and 2007) from patients later known to have
A. baumannii bloodstream infections in 2008. The collection also included 54 invasive isolates from blood infections at UMMC collected from 9/2008-6/2010.

as previously described by Maslow et al [31] and the DNA
was digested with ApaI [32]. DNA was subsequently separated in 1% agarose on a contour-clamped homogeneousfield machine (CHEF-DR II, Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA).
Electrophoresis was performed at 6 V/cm for 18.5 hours,
with pulse times ranging from 7-20 seconds. Following
electrophoresis, the gels were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under ultraviolet illumination.
Interpretation of PFGE was preformed using the criteria
outlined by Tenover et al. [33], where band patterns are
visually compared and classified as indistinguishable (clonal), closely related (clonal variants, three or less band differences), possibly related (four to six band differences)
and unrelated (seven or more band differences).
DNA extraction, genome sequencing, and annotation

Genomic DNA was extracted from the three cultures
grown overnight at 37ºC using standard methods [34].
Genomes were sequenced with the 454 Titanium platform
and raw reads were assembled with Newbler (454 Life
Sciences). The resulting assembly was annotated with an
automated annotation pipeline at the Institute for Genome
Sciences (http://www.igs.umaryland.edu/). Assembly
details are included in Additional File 2, Table S2.
Multiple locus sequence typing (MLST)

The gene sequences for seven housekeeping genes (gltA,
pyrG, rplB, recA, cpn60, fusA, rpoB) were informatically
extracted from genomic contigs with Mugsy [35] and
were compared to allele profiles in the A. baumannii
PF8MLST database (http://www.pasteur.fr/recherche/
genopole/PF8/mlst/Abaumannii.html); sequence types
were then assigned for matching profiles.
Blast score ratio (BSR) analysis

A BSR analysis [36] was performed on the predicted proteome of the three genomes included in this study and 6
finished A. baumannii genomes (Table 1). Peptides were
classified as unique for a BSR > 0.80, divergent for a BSR <
0.80 and > 0.40, and unique for a BSR < 0.40 as described
in previous multi-genome analyses [37-39].

Antibiotic Resistance Methods

Resistance island visualization

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on all
isolates by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Susceptibility testing was performed and interpreted in accordance with Clinical and Laboratory Standard and Institute
(CLSI) guidelines [29].

The AbaR1 gene sequence was downloaded from Genbank (Locus ID CT025832). Each genome was aligned
against this sequence with NUCmer [40]. The resulting
percent identity plot was generated showing conservation over the entire length of the gene, as has been done
recently [41].

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)

PFGE was performed on the three selected isolates. PFGE
was performed following the protocol described at http://
www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/protocols.htm with slight modifications described below [30]. Agarose plugs were prepared

Whole genome alignment and phylogenetics

A whole genome alignment was performed with Mugsy
[35] on a total of 23 available A. baumannii genomes
(Additional File 2, Table S2) using a maximum gap

Columns with gaps were removed from the alignment
with mothur [42] to generate an ungapped multiple
sequence alignment. For phylogenetic studies, extracting
polymorphic positions reduced the size of the alignment.
A phylogenetic tree was then inferred on this reduced
alignment with FastTree [43], with 1000 boostrap replicates and using Acinetobacter calcoaceticus as the
outgroup.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening

The collection of 74 A. baumannii isolates was screened
by PCR for the genomic regions identified from the
Mugsy alignment as being associated with the colonization or invasion phenotypes. Single colonies were grown
overnight in Luria broth at 37ºC. Aliquots of the overnight cultures were boiled at 94ºC for 10 minutes, and
then the cellular debris was removed by centrifugation
for 5 min at 4000 × RPM; this crude cell lysate was
then used as the PCR template. PCR primers were
designed with Primer3 [44]. A list of primers used in
this study is shown in Table 2. Reaction conditions were
as follows: 95ºC for 5 minutes followed by 30 cycles of
94ºC for 30 s, 58ºC for 30 s, and 72ºC for 45 s.

Results
A. baumannii isolate selection

Three isolates were chosen for sequencing: a colonizing
isolate from the peri-anal site (UMB002), an outbreak
isolate from the bloodstream (UMB001), and a non-outbreak wound isolate (UMB003). Each of the isolates has
a different PFGE pattern (Additional File 3, Figure S1),
providing evidence that, while these isolates were
obtained from the same hospital setting in a limited
timeframe, they do not represent highly similar clones
that are part of a single outbreak.
MLST analysis

The allelic profiles were obtained from the genome
sequencing projects of the three new genomes analyzed
in this study. The PF8MLST (http://www.pasteur.fr/
recherche/genopole/PF8/mlst/Abaumannii.html) system
assigned the genomes into sequence types (STs) 2
(UMB001), 16 (UMB002), and 25 (UMB003) (Table 1).
The comparison of these sequence types to the previously sequenced genomes identified that there is not a
consistent MLST pattern associated with the isolates
from invasive or colonization sources (i.e. there is not a
predominant sequence type for invasion isolates). Additionally, the MLST sequence type did not extend to other

phenotypes, for example, strain AB0057 and AB307-0294
are both ST1; AB0057 shows a MDR phenotype, while
AB307-0294 shows a susceptible phenotype.
Whole genome phylogenetic analysis

In an effort to assess the phylogeny of these genomes
in a gene/annotation independent manner we used the
whole genome comparative analysis described previously [34]. The whole genome alignment method
identified 2.25 Mb of homologous sequence data
shared between all available A. baumannii isolates
(Additional File 1, Table S1). From this multiple
sequence alignment, we identified 330,631 polymorphic
positions (14.7% of the total alignment). As has been
demonstrated previously [19], multi-drug resistant
(MDR) strains do not share a monophyletic origin
(Figure 1). Limited genetic variation was observed
between all A. baumannii genomes; an uncorrected
distance matrix for this alignment showed < 2%
nucleotide variation for all 17 genomes.

Figure 1 A phylogenetic tree of all sequenced A. baumannii
genomes constructed using whole genome alignments. Open
boxes represent those strains from the colonization phenotype
(wound, skin) and the star represents those isolates from the
invasive phenotype (blood, urine); the black dots indicate the MDR
strains. For genomes with no phenotype description, the phenotype
is either unknown or does not affect humans. The tree is
constructed based on the >300,000 variable locations in the
genome alignment. The support values at all nodes are > 90%.
There is little clustering based on the isolation source or MDR status
based of the isolates suggesting that these traits may be being
acquired via horizontal gene transfer and are not highly conserved.

A. baumannii pan-genome analysis

Using a pangenome analysis pipeline maintained at the
Institute for Genome Sciences [45-47], we estimated
the size of the A. baumannii pangenome based on 6
complete, publicly available A. baumannii genomes
(Table 1). We estimate the pangenome size to be
approximately 6500 genes (Figure 2A) and approximately 66 new genes are expected with the sequencing
of each additional genome (Figure 2B). These values
are similar to other A. baumannii pan-genome calculations [19].
Blast score ratio (BSR) analysis

The BLAST score ratio analysis will identify the level of
conservation of genes that have been predicted in any
set of genomes [36]. Using a conservative BSR threshold
of 0.4 (similar to <30% amino acid identity over <30% of
the peptide) we identified the unique genes in each of
the new genomes sequenced in this study when compared to the complete genomes in GenBank (Additional
File 2, Table S2). The BSR analysis for the genomes
sequenced in this study identified 180 unique genes in
UMB001, 290 in UMB002 and 496 in UMB003. These
genes and functional annotations for UMB001-UMB003
are included in Additional Files 4, 5, 6, 7, Tables S3-S6),
respectively. For each of these genomes there is no functional annotation for ~ 60% of the unique gene set
(UMB001, 106 genes = 58.9%; UMB002, 182 genes =
62.8% UMB003, 288 genes = 58.1%). The majority of
genes with functional annotation are similar to genes
that are involved in horizontal gene transfer; these genes
include transposases or genes involved in Type IV secretion systems that constitute plasmid mobility and conjugation systems. These plasmid transfer genes further
suggest the presence of plasmids in these isolates.
The largest unique gene set was observed in UMB003.
Interestingly these genes with functional annotation
have similarities that suggest recent lateral gene transfer
between not just other Acinetobacter species, but other
unrelated species. A chloramphenicol acetyltransferase
gene was identified that showed high homology (99%) to
a Klebsiella pneumoniae homolog [48]. While this gene
has been identified in another A. baumannii isolate by
single gene sequencing [49], the previous version
demonstrates a much lower level of homology (81%);
this gene is not present in any publically available
A. baumannii complete or draft genome sequence.
Interestingly, in UMB003 a phenol hydroxylase protein
complex was identified. This complex is responsible for
the breakdown of phenol, the base for many disinfectants; a homologous gene cluster (99% identity) was originally identified in an Acinetobacter calcoaceticus
genome isolated from oil refinery wastewater [50]. A
primer set was designed for a conserved protein in the

Figure 2 Pan-genome analysis of the complete genomes of A. baumannii. Panel A demonstrates the pan genome size of A. baumannii as
calculated based on the power regression model. The plot shows an open pan-genome that predicts the total genome space to contain ~

These values are based only on the complete genomes as it is difficult to predict complete genome size from incomplete genome data.

phenol hydroxylase complex. A screen of the 74
A. bumannii isolates showed that 25 of them were positive for presence of the amplified gene fragment. A
BLAST search of this conserved fragment against all 23
sequenced A. baumannii genomes only showed hits
against UMB003 and the draft genome sequence
AB_4190 [51].
Antibiotic resistance mechanisms

Clinical laboratory testing identified resistance in all
three isolates to several antibiotics including amikacin,
ceftazimide, and gentamicin (Table 3). A genomic comparison identified that each isolate contained a gentamicin 3’-acetyltransferase and an RND type efflux pump
(AdeT) previously demonstrated to be involved in aminoglycoside resistance [52]. All Isolates contained an
AmpC cephalosporinase, which would help explain the
clinical observation of ceftazidime resistance [53]; the

insertion sequence ISAbar1, which has been associated
with over-production of AmpC [54], was also present in
UMB001 and UMB002. The oxacillinase like-gene bla
OXA-69 , which has the ability to hydrolyze carbapenem
[55], was present in all genomes.
Resistance islands (RIs)

Resistance islands are common in A. baumannii as genomic locations for the acquisition and accumulation of
genes required for antibiotic resistance [20,22]. The most
well studied of these RIs is AbaR1 [20]. We utilize the
AbaR1 structure as a reference as it appears to be the largest of the RI and all others appear smaller, however it
must be noted that the complete AbaR1 structure has not
been observed in any other isolate to date. Comparison of
all A. baumannii genomes in this genomic region identifies a wide spectrum of genomic conservation (Figure 3).
Limited, but highly conserved regions (BSR > 0.80) of the

Figure 3 A percent identity plot of all genomes compared to the resistance island AbaR1 in strain AYE. The height of each peak
represents percent identity (755-100%). The annotation for the resistance island is shown at below the percent identity plot. The genomic
coordinates at the bottom of the figure indicate the position of AbaR1 in the AYE chromosome.

AbaR1 RI are present in UMB001 and UMB003, but
absent in UMB002 (Figure 3). Bioinformatic analysis identified that UMB001 and UMB003 contain an aminoglycoside resistance protein and the transposase TN21 that are
present in the prototype AbaR1. UMB002 contains only 5
genes from AbaR1, and none of them associated with antibiotic resistance. An analysis of genomic contigs that contain comM from all three UMB strains failed to identify
additional genes from known RIs; this suggests that homologous genes to those in known RIs are either in previously unknown RIs, or are not present in a genomic
island.
Efflux pumps

Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of
efflux pumps at removing antimicrobials from the cell
and conferring the MDR phenotype. These pump systems are present in the three genomes sequenced in this
study, but are also present in genomes of drug susceptible isolates. Three systems have been demonstrated to
contribute to the MDR phenotype, AdeABC, AdeFGH
and AdeIJK [24-26]. The three genomes sequenced in
this study contain the adeFGH operon, as well as the
gene encoding the regulator, AdeL. A multiple sequence
alignment of the predicted adeL coding sequence

demonstrated no single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) that were unique to either the MDR or drug susceptible phenotypes (data not shown). Additionally, each
of the three new genomes contained highly conserved
adeA and adeB genes from the AdeABC efflux pump
complex; however, UMB002 and UMB003 lack the gene
encoding the outer membrane protein AdeC [56]. A
multiple alignment of the AdeABC regulator, AdeR [57],
also showed no MDR-specific SNPs.
Identification of conserved genomic fragments

Detailed comparative genomic analysis identified one
gene encoding a hypothetical protein (accession
YP_001713249) that is conserved in all 23 A. baumannii genomes and has no identified homologue in 12
other Acinetobacter species genomes. A pairwise alignment demonstrates that there is a high level of conservation for this peptide (Additional File 8 Figure S2).
PCR primers were designed from this coding region
(Table 2) and a PCR based screen of 74 putative A.
baumannii isolates identified 73 positive amplicons
(98.6% sensitivity). A BLAST homology search identified the closest homolog as a protein of unknown
function with 47% peptide identity in the actinomycete
Catenulispora acidiphila.

Colonization and invasion genotype analysis

The majority of A. baumannii genomes sequenced to
date demonstrate an invasion phenotype, as they are isolated from fluids within the human body (Table 1 and
Additional File 1, Table S1). In fact, only one previously
available draft genome, AB900, was isolated from what
the present study defines as a colonization isolate. In
the case of AB090, the colonization site was the perinea
[19]. The current study adds two draft genomes
(UMB002, UMB003) that were isolated from colonization of the peri-anal region and a wound, respectively.
A comparative whole genome approach was employed
to determine if the organisms with either a colonization
(AB900, UMB002, UMB003) or invasion phenotype (AYE,
AB0057, AB307-0294, ACICU, ATCC 17978, UMB001,
AB056, AB058, AB059) contain unique genomic content.
Three additional A. baumannii genomes (AB6013113,
AB6013150, AB6014059) were not included in this analysis due to their uncertain isolation location. The results of
the whole genome alignment approach demonstrate that
unique genomic regions in the invasion isolates consisted
mainly of hypothetical proteins (Table 4). There were also
identified regions within the colonization isolates that
were found to be absent in the invasion isolates. One
region in the colonization genotyped isolates contained a
large (>5000 aa) putative hemaglutinin/hemolysin-related
protein related to a gene that was also present in the body
louse strain A. baumanii SDF [20]. Phylogenetic analysis
of homologous genes in other pathogens showed that this
gene has not been horizontally transferred recently into
the Acinetobacter species group (Figure 4). We developed
a PCR-based assay to determine if these genetic features
were consistently present in a larger group of colonization
or invasive isolates. A screen of 74 A. baumannii isolates
with primers specific to genes present in either colonization or invasion isolates (Table 2) demonstrated that the
genes common to the isolates from each phenotype in the
genomic analysis were not restricted to that phenotype in
a broader population based analysis (Table 4). Only the
two sequenced colonization isolates amplified with the
“colonization specific” primer sets. Furthermore, the

primers designed from “invasion specific” genomic regions
showed no specificity to A. baumannii obtained from
blood compared to peri-anal isolates.

Discussion
The results of this study, which uses whole-genome
comparative methods, demonstrate that the A. baumannii genome has the potential to accommodate a range of
pathogenic phenotypes. This is the first study to use
whole genome alignment and phylogenetic methods to
classify A. baumannii. While methods such as MLST
and PFGE can identify differences between related isolates, whole genome sequencing allows us unprecedented insight into the evolution and relatedness of
cultured isolates. The variable nature of the A. baumannii pangenome [7,19,20,58] suggests that additional
whole genome sequence analysis will help to identify
additional genes associated with antibiotic resistance
and pathogenesis.
Our results demonstrated a wide variety of sequence
types circulating within an individual hospital. With the
PF8MLST typing system, UMB001 was assigned to ST2,
which also contains the outbreak, multi-drug resistant
isolate ACICU, and is one of the most commonly
encountered STs. UMB003 was assigned to ST25 that
contains outbreak strains isolated in Greece and Turkey
[59]. The UMB002 sequence type, ST16, is a much rarer
sequence type; for example, out of a study of ~130 A.
baumanniii isolates, only one, an outbreak isolate from
the Netherlands, has the same allele profile [60]. Each of
these A. baumannii isolates was circulating within
UMMC during the same limited time window, providing
the potential for interaction and additional isolate-toisolate horizontal gene transfer.
From a clinical perspective, the utility of typing a new
isolate is uncertain and provides little, if any data that is
utilized in patient treatment; however, genomics can
provide insights that may impact clinical decisions. For
example, a recent study examined at micro-evolution
between three (AB056, AB058, AB059) phylogenetically
similar clinical isolates [58], but found significant

divergent susceptibilities to antimicrobials. This is highlighted in the current study in that included on the
same phylogenetic branch and showing very little evolutionary distance are isolates expressing both MDR and
susceptible phenotypes (Figure 1). This supports the
mounting evidence that whole genome sequencing is
necessary as a diagnostic tool, because it provides more
detailed information than MLST or other typing methods, and it provides additional information about the
genetic machinery necessary for antimicrobial resistance
and pathogenesis. A recent study by Lewis et al. [61]
utilized whole genome sequencing of A. baumannii for
the investigation of a hospital outbreak in UK. This is
one of the first uses of whole genome sequencing in an
outbreak investigation or epidemiological setting. The
fine scale detail analysis allowed by whole genome
sequencing extended the findings of traditional epidemiological studies that were underway. The combination
of traditional methodologies with next generation
sequencing technologies will provide detailed analyses of
these pathogens.
A. baumannii isolates have been identified from a
wide range of human clinical sources including urine,
blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and wounds [19,20,58]. One

Page 9 of 12

of the goals of this work was to identify if there were
unique genetic features that could be attributed to a
specific pathogenic phenotype. Bioinformatic analysis of
available genomes tested the hypothesis that the gene
repertoire of an invasion isolate (blood, urine) would be
different than a colonization isolate (peri-anal, fecal matter, wound). In this study, peri-anal isolates were considered to be a colonization phenotype; surveillance from
the peri-anal site has been shown in prior studies to
represent the gastrointestinal flora (90% sensitivity,
100% specificity compared to stool samples) [62].
Furthermore, studies have shown that bacteria found on
peri-anal surveillance culturing often persist for prolonged periods [63,64] and are associated with subsequent invasive disease [65].
Genetic features were identified that were exclusively
present in genomes from each phenotype, which suggested
that these genes encode proteins that aid in either A. baumannii invasion causing clinical infection or colonization.
For example, a putative hemolysin gene was present in all
colonization phenotype isolates (Figure 4), but was absent
in all invasion phenotype isolates. A phylogenetic analysis
demonstrated that the gene is present in ancestral Acinetobacter lineages and does not appear to be a recent introduction via horizontal transfer (Figure 4). However, when
genes unique to each isolation phenotype were screened
against a broader collection of isolates including colonization and invasion isolates, no correlation between phenotype and the pattern of gene presence/absence was
observed. The design of the PCR-based assays was based
on a limited number of isolates from each phenotype, and
it’s not surprising that the presence/absence pattern fails
in a broader analysis. These findings demonstrate that
results based solely on comparative genomic analysis of a
limited number of genomes may not be broadly applicable
to diverse culture collections, especially an organism with
the genomic mosaicism of A. baumannii. The study highlights the difficulty in correlating clinical phenotypes with
genotypes in some pathogens.
While the comparative analysis did not identify a consistent genotype associated with each of the isolation source
groups, this study did identify a number of very interesting
traits that highlight the genetic variability of A. baumannii
and could potentially expand the survival of this pathogen
in the hospital setting. For example, genes associated with
phenol metabolism were exclusively found in isolate
UMB002; the absence of these genes in other A. baumannii isolates suggests that these genes were acquired
through horizontal gene transfer as they are similar to
genes found in another Acinetobacter species isolated
from oil refinery wastewater [50]. However, it is possible
that this isolate was selected for over time, as the primary
surface cleanser at UMB contains nonoxynol, which is
phenolic based, and an organism that would potentially be

Sahl et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:291
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/291

resistant to these types of cleaners would have an
increased rate of transmission; this is supported by the fact
that this complex is more frequently found in UMMC isolates, compared to the examined genomic space of the
A. baumannii species. Additional experimental work is
needed to verify that UMB002 can metabolize phenolic
compounds, but the presence of these genes suggests a
mechanism by which this isolate may persist and thrive on
hospital surfaces.
In contrast to the variable genomic features highlighted
here, we also identified a gene that encodes a large, conserved peptide that was found in all sequenced A. baumannii genomes; no homologous peptide was found in
any other sequenced Acinetobacter species. A PCR screen
demonstrated that this gene is present in A. baumannii
isolates (~99% of isolates screened), suggesting that it can
be used as a biomarker for the positive identification of
clinical A. baumannii isolates. Additional population
screening will help determine how well conserved this
peptide is among a more diverse collection of clinical
isolates.

Conclusions
Using whole genome phylogeny we have refined the
genetic relationships of the previously sequenced A. baumannii isolates and new isolates examined in this study.
These findings identified that much of the A. baumannii
variability can be attributed to horizontal gene transfer,
but it cannot account for all of the observed variability. In
all sequenced genomes, we identified a conserved genomic
region unique to A. baumannii that could serve as a biomarker for new clinical strains. In addition, we identified
unique regions in each of the sequenced genomes, as well
as regions unique to both colonization and invasive phenotypes. These regions were examined by PCR in a larger
population size and shown not to be consistent with the
isolation source. These results further highlight the genetic
variability of A. baumannii and emphasize that the genetic
potential of this pathogen is vast enough to infect and/or
colonize multiple human body sites.
