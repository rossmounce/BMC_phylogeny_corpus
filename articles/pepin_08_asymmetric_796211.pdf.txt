Abstract
Background: Within-host competition between strains of a vector-borne pathogen can affect
strain frequencies in both the host and vector, thereby affecting viral population dynamics.
However little is known about inter-strain competition in one of the most genetically diverse and
epidemiologically important mosquito-borne RNA virus: dengue virus (DENV). To assess the
strength and symmetry of intra-host competition among different strains of DENV, the effect of
mixed infection of two DENV serotypes, DENV2 and DENV4, on the replication of each in
cultured mosquito cells was tested. The number of infectious particles produced by each DENV
strain in mixed infections was compared to that in single infections to determine whether
replication of each strain was decreased in the presence of the other strain (i.e., competition). The
two DENV strains were added to cells either simultaneously (coinfection) or with a 1 or 6-hour
time lag between first and second serotype (superinfection).
Results: DENV2 and DENV4 showed significantly reduced replication in mixed infection relative
to single infection treatments. In superinfection treatments, replication was suppressed to a greater
extent when the interval between addition of each strain was longer, and when a strain was added
second. Additionally, competitive effects were asymmetric: although both strains replicated to
similar peak population sizes in single infections, DENV2 was more suppressed than DENV4 in
mixed infections. Superinfection treatments yielded significantly lower combined virus titers than
coinfection or single infection treatments.
Conclusion: Competition between DENV strains in cultured mosquito cells can cause a significant
decrease in peak viral population sizes, which could translate to decreased transmission by the
vector. Effects of competition were asymmetric between DENV2 and DENV4, probably reflecting
significant variation in the competitive ability of DENV strains in nature. Competition was strongest
in superinfection treatments, suggesting that colonization of new DENV strains could be impeded
in areas where numerous mosquitoes are infected with endemic DENV strains.

Background
Infection of a single host by multiple strains of a pathogen
may result in competition for host resources [1]. Such
intra-host competition is predicted to shape a variety of

pathogen traits such as virulence, transmissibility, and
resource partitioning, that could affect epidemiology and
virus population dynamics [2-9]. However, empirical data
demonstrating the action of intra-host competition

among pathogens have been scarce, particularly for medically-relevant organisms [10,11]. Among viruses, the
magnitude of competition is sensitive to the order and
interval of infection by different strains. For example,
when two strains of Cydia pomonella granulomavirus
infect a codling moth host at the same time (coinfection)
replication of both strains is decreased [12], yet coinfection of disparate strains of vaccinia virus in cultured monkey cells does not result in decreased replication [13].
However, in the vaccinia system, when one strain infects
four hours after the other (superinfection), replication of
the second strain is suppressed, and with a ten-hour lag
time between infections, the second strain is unable to
replicate at all (superinfection exclusion). Similar patterns, albeit over different timescales, have been observed
in vivo for Borna disease virus infection of rats [14],
LaCrosse virus infection of mosquitoes [15], and bluetongue virus infection of midges [16]. Notably, competitive suppression is not an inevitable outcome of mixedstrain infection. Avirulent strains of murine cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus may experience enhanced
replication and virulence in mixed-genotype relative to
single-genotype infections [17,18]. Thus, while interstrain interactions appear to significantly impact the population dynamics of viruses, their outcome varies across
biological systems. In order to understand and predict the
evolutionary epidemiology of medically important
viruses that exist as mixed-strain assemblages, it is important to study the interactions within those particular systems.
Dengue viruses (DENV, genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae), the mosquito-borne human pathogens that cause
dengue fever, have increased in geographic range, prevalence, and disease severity in recent decades. DENV is currently considered the most significant emerging threat to
global public health of any vector-borne virus [19].
Genetic variation within this diverse group of RNA viruses
has been categorized as follows: antigenically and genetically distinctserotypes (DEN1–4) are each comprised of
numerous distinct genotypes, which are in turn subdivided into multiple sub-groups or types [20]. Genome
sequence data and phylogenetic analyses suggest that
strain replacement, apparently mediated by competitive
displacement, is widespread in DENV epidemiology [2025]. Most prominently, the Southeast Asian genotype
(SA) of DENV2 invaded the Americas in the late twentieth
century and has subsequently displaced the endemic
American (Am) DENV2 genotype across much of the New
World [20,26]. This displacement has had substantial
impacts on the epidemiology of DENV because the SA
genotype is associated with the most severe manifestations of DENV disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever and
dengue shock syndrome, whereas the Am genotype is not
[26,27]. At present, there are no licensed vaccines or anti-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/28

viral therapies available to control DENV, and vector control has proved ineffective at limiting the global spread of
the virus [28]. In order to develop new control strategies
and effectively deploy existing ones, it will be necessary to
gain a better understanding of the factors that shape the
ecology and evolution of this virus.
For within-host competition among pathogen strains to
happen, multiple strains must occur in the same geographic location, infect the same host, and target the same
cells within that host. DENV meets all three of these criteria. The four DENV serotypes co-circulate across most of
the geographic range of the virus [29-32] and co-infection
of individual humans and vectors by multiple DENV
strains occurs in nature [33-36], and even appears to be
common in some outbreaks [37]. In the mosquito vector,
all four dengue serotypes use the same putative receptor in
the mosquito midgut, the initial site of DENV replication
[38], and initial infection of the mosquito midgut appears
to involve only a few individual cells [39]. The same may
be true in human hosts, but the initial stages of DENV
infection in humans have proven difficult to characterize.
One significant difference between vector and human
infection is that the former persists for life whereas the latter is transient because it is cleared by the host immune
response. This may expand the opportunities for competition in vectors relative to humans.
To date only one study has explicitly considered the role
of competition within the vector on the epidemiological
dynamics of wild type DENV strains: among Aedes aegypti
mosquitoes fed on bloodmeals containing equal quantities of the Am and SA genotype of DENV2, more mosquitoes were infected with the SA genotype [40]. However
this study did not include single genotype infections for
comparison. Since the Am genotype also has lower infectivity in single infections [41], it is unclear whether the differences in the coinfection study are due to competition
within the vector or whether they are simply inherent differences among the genotypes that act independently in
mixed infections. While variation between the Am and SA
genotypes in their intrinsic ability to infect mosquitoes
does appear to contribute to the competitive displacement of the former [40], coinfection studies conducted
with the appropriate single infection controls are needed
to characterize the role of direct competition among
DENV strains infecting a single host.
Data from vaccine research provides the only other experimental evidence suggesting that heterologous DENV
strains can interfere with each other's replication during
coinfection; studies of the replication of live-attenuated
tetravalent vaccine formulations (containing all four serotypes) in humans have shown that the replication of individual serotypes appears to be sensitive to the identity and

concentration of coinfecting serotypes [42,43]. Although
these data suggest that interference between serotypes can
cause decreased replication, it is unclear whether these
effects are due to direct competition or whether they are
mediated indirectly through the immune system.
To test the hypothesis that competition between dengue
virus strains occurs within the mosquito vector, we compared replication of two dengue serotypes (DENV2 and
DENV4) in single relative to mixed infections in cultured
Aedes albopictus mosquito cells (C6/36), a model for replication in one of the primary DENV vectors. Serotypes
infected alone (single infections), or together (mixed
infections) by either coinfection, where both serotypes
were added simultaneously, or by superinfection, where
the second serotype was infected either one or six hours
after the first. Viral progeny output was measured at three
designated time points. Single infections served as controls for interpreting effects of mixed infections. We predicted that if competition occurs: (l) a given serotype
would replicate to higher titers in single infections relative
to mixed infections, (2) the serotypes, which have similar
replication rates in single infections, would be suppressed
similarly in mixed infections, and (3) superinfection
would affect the degree of competitive suppression such
that the longer the interval between the introduction of
two serotypes, the more disproportionate the suppression

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/28

of the serotype infecting second. While predictions 1 and
3 were borne out by our results, we detected intriguing
asymmetries in the response of the two serotypes to competition. Our results highlight that intra-host competition
could affect transmission of different DENV serotypes and
that the degree of suppression depends on time interval
between infection of the two serotypes as well as their
identity.

Results
The experimental design is described in Table 1. To test
whether the replication of a single serotype infecting at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 was suppressed by an
equal dose of the same serotype (e.g. intra-strain competition), we compared the replication of each serotype in a
single infection (MOI 5) with its replication after superinfection by the same serotype 1 or 6 hours following the
initial infection (MOI 5 + MOI 5 = 10). For example, for
DENV2, titers in treatments 1 and 8 (Table 1) were compared with titers in treatments 4 and 11. Each serotype
reached significantly higher titers on average at each timepoint when superinfected by the same serotype (Fig. 1,
Table 2, left; [Additional File 1]), suggesting that single
infections at MOI 5 have not exhausted the potential for
host cells to support virus replication, and that serotypes
in mixed infections (total MOI 10) had the potential to
grow to titers as high as those in their respective single

showed that treatment-type explained a significant
amount of variation in DENV4 titers (Fig. 1 and Table 2,
right).
To test the prediction that the magnitude of competitive
suppression depends on superinfection interval, the titers
at 120 hrs post-superinfection for each serotype in mixed
infection treatments were regressed on the time that the
serotype was infected relative to its competitor. We also
included serotype as an effect in this analysis to test the
prediction that suppression would be similar for both
serotypes. In agreement with prediction, titers for each
serotype in mixed infections showed a significant negative
relationship with the length of time between their infection and infection by the competitor (Fig. 2, Table 3). That
is, the magnitude of competitive suppression for a serotype was stronger, the later that the serotype was added
after the other serotype, and this pattern was consistent
for both serotypes. The analysis also showed that the
intercept of the relationship was higher for DENV4 relative to DENV2, indicating that DENV2 titers were more
adversely affected by competition than DENV4.
To examine effects of mixed-strain infection on total virus
production (i.e., the combined titer for both strains in

Mean titers for DENV2 (circles) and DENV4 (triangles) are

of DENV 2 when DENV 2 was infected 6 hours after DENV

time, etc). Titer data are from the final sampling point (120
hours, N = 4 per data point). The titer of each strain in single
infection (MOI = 5) is plotted as a straight line for comparison; DENV2 (black) and DENV4 (grey).

mixed infections), total titers for coinfection (treatments:
3 and 10, Table 1) and superinfection (treatments: 13 and
14) treatments were each compared to the grand mean of
single-strain infection treatments. The single-strain infection category included data for both DENV2 and DENV4
strains, but only the treatments where the total amount of
virus added was equivalent to a MOI of 10 (treatments: 4,
5, 11 and 12) since the total MOI in the mixed-strain
infection categories was also 10. If mixed infections do
not affect total titers, than the average titer of DENV2 and
4 in single-strain infections should equal the sum of
DENV2 and 4 in mixed-strain infections, when both treatments are initiated with the same dose of total virus. In
coinfections, total titers were similar to those in singlestrain infections (t2,19 = 1.7, P < 0.054; Fig. 3), but in
superinfections they were in fact lower than in singlestrain infections (t2,12 = 1.8, P < 0.048; Fig. 3), indicating
that superinfection decreased total viral replication.

Discussion
To examine whether competition between DENV serotypes can occur, we tested whether high dose infections
with two serotypes in cultured mosquito cells affected
progeny output for either serotype relative to its output in
single-serotype infections. Aedes albopictus is one of the
major vectors of dengue worldwide [31], and while cultured cells are not a perfect model for infection in vivo they
offer a tractable system for assessing the potential effects
of mixed-serotype infections. We found that replication
can indeed be suppressed during mixed infections with
two serotypes, and that the magnitude of suppression of a
given serotypeis stronger for serotypes infecting cells that
already have established infections with a different serotype. This is the first study that quantitatively demonstrates competitive suppression between dengue
serotypes. Since DENV isolation studies have suggested
that mixed-serotype infections in both hosts and vectors
occur, and may even be common in some circumstances,
our data indicate that further investigation of the interactions between dengue serotypes is important for understanding dengue epidemiology.
Although competition affected final titers, population
growth rate during most of the exponential phase was
similar between single infection and mixed infection
treatments. Thus, competitive suppression occurred late
in infection, once virus populations had approached a
plateau in concentration. A similar late-acting effect was
observed when a wild type strain of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) was co-infected with engineered strains
carrying 1–3 point mutations in either the capsid, a structural protein, or the polymerase, a non-structural protein
responsible for replication of the genome [44]. Wild type
virus replication was not suppressed within the first 3–5
hours after introduction to cells, but at later sampling

time points the wild type had produced significantly fewer
infectious progeny relative to single infection controls.
Furthermore, in FMDV suppression of wild type virus replication was not always observed, but rather the outcome
depended on the particular mutations carried by the competitor. Replication ability of the competitor mutants was
characterized in separate treatments (in single infections),
which showed that while some mutants were incapable of
producing infectious progeny, others were almost as fit as
the wild type. Of the three competitors carrying mutations

and DENV4 replicates averaged together. Grey bars represent mixed-strain infections where each assay received both
DENV2 and DENV4 at a MOI of 5 for each. The superinfection category includes both orders of superinfection (2 then

population were significantly lower in superinfection treatments than in single-strain infections (indicated by *).

in the polymerase, only the mutant that produced high
levels of polymerase and infectious progeny caused suppression of the wild type. Interestingly, some of the competitors carrying capsid mutations produced large
quantities of capsid protein early in infection and actually
enhanced the production of infectious particles of wild
type early in infection. Taken together, the results suggest
that competitive success may depend upon a strain's ability to monopolize its own replication machinery and
structural proteins and to acquire those of its competitors
late in infection. Our finding that DENV serotypes are
suppressed later in infection is consistent with the idea
that competition is mediated by the intracellular density
of virus genome templates and copies of virus proteins,
perhaps through competition for polymerase or capsid
proteins [45-48]. Under this hypothesis, a virus strain that
experienced high levels of coinfection with other strains,
such as a new strain invading an area with an endemic
virus population, would benefit from a rapid escalation of
RNA replication early in infection. Our results support
this notion by the finding that the magnitude of suppression depended upon the superinfection interval. Serotypes that infected earlier had an advantage, whereas
those that infected later had the most extreme disadvantage.
The two serotypes of DENV used in this study, which
showed similar rates of replication in isolation, nonetheless showed significant variation in competitive ability,
suggesting that similar variation may occur in nature. A
second implication of this asymmetry is that traits conferring competitive ability in mixed infection may be de-coupled from those that enable high replication rates in single
infections. For example, a virus strain may replicate rapidly when it has sole access to homologous viral polymerase but poorly in a mixed population of genomes
competing for heterologous polymerases. Importantly,
these results underscore that the outcome of within-host
competition is not predictable from replication rates in
single infections. This finding could also be relevant in the
design and development of a tetravalent vaccine, which
must contain all four serotypes. If one serotype is better
able to usurp polymerase in a coinfected cell, then the

Specificity of HMAF antibodies. Stock virus samples containing only DENV2 (left panel) or DENV4 (right panel) were serially diluted and infected on C6/36 cell monolayers at 80–90% confluence in 24-well plates. The two most dilute infections of
the ten-fold dilution series are shown. Infections were done in duplicate. Plates were incubated at 32°C, 5% CO2, and 88% RH.
For staining, DENV2 and DENV4 samples were each incubated with both HMAF antibodies in separate wells (HMAF4: left columns of each panel, HMAF2: right columns of each panel). The antibody dilutions, which were determined to be specific and
thus were used throughout the study, are shown.

production of neutralizing antibodies may be unbalanced, resulting in an ineffective vaccine. In this context,
however, the total dose of virus is low enough that opportunity for inter-serotype interference within cells may be
limited to peripheral cells co-infected at the injection site.
The fact that total titers were significantly lower in superinfections when compared to single infections of the same
MOI shows that interspecific competition was stronger
than intraspecific competition, further suggesting that
competition-related traits are available to selection in this
system. Thus, under the hypothesis that competition for
viral proteins mediates suppression, we predict that
strains isolated from regions where serotypes frequently
coinfect mosquitoes should have the strongest ability to
utilize and compete for genetically different polymerase
or capsid proteins (i.e., generalists). However, with regard
to differences in total titers in single versus mixed infections, there is a slight inconsistency; total titers in coinfections were not significantly lower than single infections
while those in superinfections were. Theoretically, in the
two treatments the frequencies of cells infected with particular numbers of each serotype would have been similar.
The difference is that viruses that superinfect could be at a
numerical disadvantage since those that infect first have

already begun progeny production and thus could outnumber the second serotype once resources become limiting. Our result that superinfection decreases overall virus
production significantly more that coinfection, indicates
that competition resulted in disproportionately more
severe effects on the total population when one of the
strains had a headstart in the infection. This is consistent
with our suspicion that the mechanism of competition
may be density-dependent (i.e., each serotype is suppressed relatively more when the other serotype is more
frequent). Experiments to test this prediction are ongoing.

Conclusion
Our results demonstrate that competition between serotypes can affect virus titers in mixed infections in mosquito cells, suggesting that competitive suppression could
act to decrease transmission. To better understand the role
of inter-serotype competition in emergence of dengue,
future research should aim to identify predictor variables
of suppression, to examine the effects of mixed-serotype
infections on replication throughout both stages of the
virus life cycle (vector and host), and to quantify these
effects in an epidemiological framework. It would also be
useful to examine these effects in live mosquitoes. Recent
studies of single strain infections in Aedes aegypti have

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:28

highlighted that viruses must replicate in, and disseminate to, several different vector tissues before infecting the
salivary glands and disseminating to the saliva for transmission [39,49]. The nature of this pathway and our finding that competitive abilities were uncoupled from
performance in single infections highlight that there is
potential for interaction effects between serotypes at several stages during vector infection, which could complicate prediction of the effects of mixed serotype infection.
Lastly, our results underscore that within-host competition in the mosquito vector may have dramatic effects on
both emergence and long-term virus persistence, and
these potential effects should be explored in the context of
other important factors of dengue virulence such as the
host immune system.

Aedes albopictus epithelial cells (C6/36) [50,51] were
maintained in minimal essential media (Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 2 mM non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), and 50 µg/ml gentamycin at
32°C (hereafter termed C6/36 media), 5% CO2, and 88%
RH. DENV-2-DOO-0372 (DENV2) was originally isolated
in Thailand in 1988 from a Type III DHF case and subsequently passaged in C6/36 seven times, with a final titer
of 5 × 108 pfu/ml. DENV-4-Thai85-052 (DENV4) was isolated in Thailand (associated disease unknown) and passaged in C6/36 three times, with a final titer of 4 × 108 pfu/
ml.
Infections and titering
Virus titers were determined by infecting 80–90% confluent C6/36 cells in 24-well tissue culture treated plates (BD
Falcon™, Fisher Scientific) with a tenfold serial dilution of
the designated virus in duplicate. Plates were incubated
with occasional shaking for 2 hours under conditions for
maintenance of C6/36 described above and then overlaid
with 1 ml/well of 0.8% methylcellulose in Optimem (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2%FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine
and 50 µg/ml gentamycin. Plates were incubated for 5
days at which time plaques were detected by antibody and
visualized by immunoperoxidase staining as previously
described [52,53] with the following modifications: for
one replicate of each duplicate series hyperimmune
mouse ascites fluid (HMAF) against DENV4 at a 1: 2000
dilution was used to detect DENV4 and in the other
HMAF against DENV2 at a 1: 4000 dilution was used to
detect DENV2. HMAF dilutions were optimized to eliminate non-specific staining (Fig 4). Titers were quantified as
pfu/ml, where each plaque represents a focus of infection
initiated by a single virion and detected by antibody.

To test the impact of mixed infection on replication, designated viruses were added to ~80% confluent monolayers of C6/36 cells in 6-well tissue culture-treated plates
(BD Falcon™) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 (5
plaque forming units, pfu, per cell). Media was first
removed from cell monolayers, cells were washed in 2 ml
fresh C6/36 media, and 1 ml of C6/36 media containing
the appropriate number of virus particles was added. Cells
were then incubated at 32°C for 20 minutes, washed with
2 ml of fresh media, and 3 ml of fresh media was added.
For the second infection in the superinfection treatments,
media was removed and the virus solution suspended in
fresh media was added directly to the monolayer, omitting the wash step that was done in the first infection.
Cells were again incubated for 20 minutes, then washed in
2 ml of fresh media, and fed 3 ml of fresh media. All treatments were incubated at 32°C, 5% CO2, and 88% humidity; supernatant samples (1 ml) were collected at 32, 72,
and 120 hours after the last virus sample was added. This
means that in 1-hour superinfection experiments, samples were collected at 33, 73, and 121 hours after the initial infection time, while in 6-hour superinfection
experiments, samples were collected at 38, 78, and 126
hours. The 1 ml samples were immediately replaced with
fresh media.
Experimental design
Table 1 summarizes the experimental design. DENV serotypes were infected as single infections (DENV2 or
DENV4) or mixed infections (DENV2 and DENV4), the
latter including: 1) coinfection in which both strains were
added simultaneously, and 2) superinfection in which
one strain was added after the other. Two superinfection
intervals, 1 hour or 6 hours, and both superinfection
orders (DENV2 first or DENV4 first) were used. Each treatment was replicated three times for a total of four independent infections. In one of these replicates, treatments
were conducted in duplicate or triplicate in order to assess
whether within-treatment effects (e.g., measurement
noise from the titering protocol) contributed significant
variability to between-treatment effects. A repeated-measures nested ANOVA with treatment as the repeated factor
and the within- versus between-replicate effect nested
within treatment, showed that there was a significant
effect of treatment for both DENV2 and DENV4 (F4,96 =
8.5, P < 0.0001; F4,96 = 16.4, P < 0.0001; respectively) but
no significant variation from the nested factor (F5,96 = 0.4,
P < 0.86; F5,96 = 1.1, P < 0.4; for DENV2 and 4 respectively). Thus, we concluded that measurement noise from
our experimental methods was negligible compared to
effects from the imposed treatments. In the replicate
where treatments were conducted in multiple-fold, we
took the means from the multiple data points to represent
the titer of each treatment in that replicate.

Statistical analyses
All titer data were log-transformed and analyzed by
repeated measures factorial ANOVA with assay as the
repeated main effect, time as a main effect, and assay ×
time as an interaction term using StatView (version 5.0.1,
SAS Institute Inc.). Since single infection controls and
coinfection treatments were not significantly different
between the two experiments (1 hour versus 6 hour;
[Additional file 1]) these data were pooled as follows:
1+8, 2+9, 4+11, 5+12, and 3+10, where numbers correspond to the treatment labels in Table 1. To test whether
serotypes replicated to higher titers when infection was
initiated with a greater concentration of virus, single infections of each serotype at MOI 5 were compared to singleserotype superinfections, which had a total MOI of 10
(i.e., 1+8 data versus 4+11 data). To test whether mixedserotype infection explained a significant amount of variation in titers, the titer of each serotype in single infection
treatments of MOI 5 were compared to the titer of that
serotype in all mixed infection treatments pooled (e.g., for
DENV2: 1+8 versus 3+6+7+10+13+14). Finally, to test the
impact of each treatment type on the titer of each serotype, single infection treatments of MOI 5 were compared
to each mixed infection treatment considered individually
(e.g., for DENV2: 1+8 versus 3+10 versus 6 versus 13 versus 7 versus 14).

The impact of the interval of mixed infections were analyzed by ANCOVA using JMP (Version 5.1, SAS Institute
Inc.), where the interval of mixed infection refers to the
time that elapsed between addition of first and second
serotype (see Table 1 for details). In this analysis, the titer
at hour 120 was the dependent variable, the interval of
mixed infection was the covariate, and DENV serotype
was the discrete factor. To test whether the type of infection treatment influenced the total output of infectious
virus (i.e., titers for both serotypes in mixed-strain infections), titers for DENV2 and DENV4 in each mixed infection assay were summed and then log-transformed to
generate 'total titer' data. Total titers in coinfections (treatments: 3 and 10, Table 1) and superinfections (treatments: 13 and 14) were each compared to total titers in
single-strain infections by t-tests using JMP. The singlestrain infection category included both strains, but only
the treatments where the total amount of virus added was
equivalent to a MOI of 10 (treatments: 4, 5, 11 and 12),
since the total MOI in the mixed-strain infection categories was also 10.
