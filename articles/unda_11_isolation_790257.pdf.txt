The raffinose family of oligosaccharides (RFOs) likely
fulfill at least few major physiological roles in plants,
translocation of carbon in the phloem, storage in sink
tissues, and as putative biological agents to combat both
abiotic and biotic stress [1-3]. The synthesis of galactinol from myo-inositol + UDP-galactose, by galactinol
synthase (GolS), is considered a key regulatory step in
RFO synthesis [4].To investigate the functional roles of
this class of compounds in trees, two cDNAs that
encode galactinol synthase (GolS), were identified and
cloned from hybrid poplar (P. alba × grandidentata).
Phylogenetic analyses of the Populus GolS isoforms with
other known galactinol synthases suggested a putative
role for these enzymes during biotic or abiotic stress in
hybrid poplar. The predicted protein sequences of both
isoforms (PaxgGolSI and PaxgGolSII) showed characteristics of galactinol synthases from other species, including a serine phosphorylation site at position 266 and the
pentapeptide hydrophobic domain ASAAP [5]. Kinetic
analyses of recombinant Pa×gGolSI and PaxgGolSII
resulted in K m values for UPD-galactose of 0.79 and
0.65 mM and Vmax values of 660.4 and 1245 nM min-1,
respectively. PaxgGolSI inherently possessed broader pH
range and temperature sensitivity when compared to
Pa×gGolSII. Interestingly, spatial and temporal expression analyses revealed that PaxgGolSII transcript levels
varied seasonally, while PaxgGolSI did not, thereby
implying a temperature-regulated transcriptional control
of this gene in addition to the observed thermosensitivity of the respective enzyme. Based on this evidence, we
suggest that Pa×gGolSI may be involved in basic metabolic activities (i.e.storage), while Pa×gGolSII is likely
involved in seasonal mobilization of carbohydrates.
