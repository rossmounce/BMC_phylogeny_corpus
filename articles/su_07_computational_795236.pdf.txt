Abstract
Background: Phosphorus is an essential element for all life forms. However, it is limiting in most
ecological environments where cyanobacteria inhabit. Elucidation of the phosphorus assimilation
pathways in cyanobacteria will further our understanding of the physiology and ecology of this
important group of microorganisms. However, a systematic study of the Pho regulon, the core of
the phosphorus assimilation pathway in a cyanobacterium, is hitherto lacking.
Results: We have predicted and analyzed the Pho regulons in 19 sequenced cyanobacterial
genomes using a highly effective scanning algorithm that we have previously developed. Our results
show that different cyanobacterial species/ecotypes may encode diverse sets of genes responsible
for the utilization of various sources of phosphorus, ranging from inorganic phosphate,
phosphodiester, to phosphonates. Unlike in E. coli, some cyanobacterial genes that are directly
involved in phosphorus assimilation seem to not be under the regulation of the regulator SphR
(orthologue of PhoB in E coli.) in some species/ecotypes. On the other hand, SphR binding sites are
found for genes known to play important roles in other biological processes. These genes might
serve as bridging points to coordinate the phosphorus assimilation and other biological processes.
More interestingly, in three cyanobacterial genomes where no sphR gene is encoded, our results
show that there is virtually no functional SphR binding site, suggesting that transcription regulators
probably play an important role in retaining their binding sites.
Conclusion: The Pho regulons in cyanobacteria are highly diversified to accommodate to their
respective living environments. The phosphorus assimilation pathways in cyanobacteria are
probably tightly coupled to a number of other important biological processes. The loss of a
regulator may lead to the rapid loss of its binding sites in a genome.

Background
Cyanobacteria are among the oldest life form on Earth.
These organisms inhabit a broad range of ecological environments from fresh water, soil to diverse open oceanographic areas [1]. It is estimated that several cyanobacteria
living in the open oceans contribute a significant fraction
of Earth's primary production [2]. These bacteria also play

important roles in the global cycling of nitrogen and
phosphorus [3,4]. Therefore their activities have significant impacts on global environmental changes.
Phosphorus is one of the essential elements for all life
forms, since it is required for the biosyntheses of nucleotides and phospholipids and for the functional regulaPage 1 of 12

tion of proteins through phosphorylation. However,
inorganic phosphate (Pi), the only form of phosphorus
that can be directly utilized by cells, is limiting in most
ecosystems [5-7]. Thus, bacteria have evolved to develop
various mechanisms to assimilate different phosphoruscontaining compounds available to them. Phosphorus
assimilation pathways have been relatively well studied in
E. coli [8], and B. subtilis [9,10]. For instance, it is generally
known that phosphorus assimilation related genes in E.
coli are regulated by a two-component system comprising
the sensor protein, histidine kinase PhoR, and the transcription factor PhoB [8]. PhoR is activated through autophosphorylation when the Pi level in the environment is
low. Activated PhoR then phosphorylates PhoB, thereby
activating the latter. Phosphorylated PhoB can either activate or suppress the transcription of genes involved in
phosphorus assimilation, resulting in changes in gene
expression pattern that accommodate to the availability
and the types of phosphorus-containing compounds
present in the environment [8]. All the genes whose transcription is regulated by PhoB in a bacterium are collectively called a Pho regulon. The known members of the Pho
regulon in these relatively well-studied species include
genes encoding (a) the two-component system such as
PhoB and PhoR in E. coli [8] or PhoP and PhoRin B. subtilis [9,10], (b) porins and transporters for transporting
phosphorus-containing compounds into the cell, and (c)
metabolic enzymes that are used to break down phosphorus-containing compounds to release Pi. In E coli, PhoB is
known to bind to at least two tandem direct repeats (Pho
boxes) of 8 bp with consensus sequence CTGTACTA separated by an A/T rich 3 bp linker, located 10 bp upstream
of the -10 σ70 binding consensus TAN3T/A [8]. At least 8
operons comprising 39 genes in E. coli have been identified to be regulated by PhoB [8].
The Pho regulon in cyanobacteria has only been relatively
well studied in Synechocystis PCC 6803 (PCC6803)
[11,12]. Previous studies have shown that a two-component system comprising the sensor kinase SphS (orthologue of PhoR in E. coli) and the response regulator SphR
(orthologue of PhoB in E. coli) works in a similar manner
to sense the Pi level in the environment and to regulate the
expression of genes that are directly involved in phosphorus assimilation, forming a Pho regulon similar to that in
E coli [11,12]. However, only three operons have been
identified to be activated by the phosphorylated SphR,
including the operons sphX-pstS1-C1-A1-B1-B1' and pstS2C2-A2-B2, each of which encodes an ABC type high-affinity Pi uptake system, and the operon phoA-nucH, where
phoA encodes an alkaline phosphatase, and nucA an extracellular nuclease [12]. The singleton operon urtA that
encodes a subunit of urea transporter is repressed under
phosphorus limitation by an unknown mechanism [12].
SphR activates the transcription of genes by binding to at

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/156

least three tandem direct repeats (Pho boxes) of 8 bp, but
with a consensus sequence different than that in E. coli,
namely, CTTAACCT, in the promoter regions of these
genes [12]. It is unknown whether the Pho regulon in
PCC6803 includes any other genes in addition to these
three operons. Furthermore, although sphR is encoded in
15 other sequenced cyanobacterial genomes besides
PCC6803, little is known about which genes in these
genomes are regulated by SphR. In this work, we have predicted the Pho regulons in 16 sequenced cynaobacterial
genomes that encode the sphR gene using an efficient phylogenetic footprinting based motif scanning algorithm
[13]. Interestingly, three cyanobacterial genomes, i.e.,
Prochlorococcus marinus CCMP1375 (CCMP1375) and
Synechococcus sp. CC9311 (CC9311) and Synechococcus sp.
CC9902 (CC9902) that do not encode the sphR gene, provide us a rare and highly valuable opportunity to examine
the turnover of the cis-regulatory binding sites after their
regulators were lost during the course of evolution.

Results
1. Conservation of the DNA binding domain of SphR
We have identified orthologues of SphR of PCC6803
(sll0337) in 16 out of the 19 sequenced cyanobacterial
genomes using the criterion described in the Methods section. Interestingly, the genomes of CCMP1375, CC9311
and CC9902 do not encode the sphR gene. As shown in
Figure 1A, the DNA binding domain of SphR of the 16
cyanobacteria is highly conserved, suggesting that the
DNA binding sites of SphRs in these species are likely to
be conserved. In particular, the amino acid residues of
PhoB of E. coli that are in direct contact with the Pho
boxes (marked by red dots) as revealed by the crystal (tertiary) structure of the PhoB-DNA complex [14] are also
highly conserved in the SphR sequences (Figure 1A). This
may explain why both PhoB of E. coli and SphR of
PCC6803 bind to 8 bp tandem repeats with a 3 bp linker
[8,12]. We therefore infer that all the SphRs in these
cyanobacterial genomes bind to cis-regulatory sites with a
similar sequence structure. The phylogenetic relationship
among these SphR sequences is shown in Figure 1B.
2. Profiles of the SphR binding sites predicted by
phylogenetic footprinting
When the phylogenetic footprinting technique is applied
to the pooled 50 upstream regions (data not shown) of
the operons whose genes are orthologous to those that are
regulated by SphR in PCC6803, highly conserved two tandem repeats with a linker are identified in 30 these
sequences by our motif finding program CUBIC [15] with
a cutoff score at p < 0.001. We assume that these motifs are
putative Pho boxes, and are shown in Table 1. The three
known SphR binding sites in PCC6803 are accurately
recovered (Table 1), suggesting that most of the identified
motifs are likely to be true Pho boxes. Shown in Figure 1C

is the logo representation of the sequence profile of these
putative two tandem Pho boxes plus the linker; Figure 1D
is the logo representation of the sequence profile of the
combined putative Pho boxes of the two tandem repeats
shown in 1C. However, such conserved two tandem
repeats are not found for any orthologous genes from
CC9605 MIT9313, CC9311 and CC9902, suggesting that
these genes do not bear Pho boxes or their Pho boxes differ largely from the conserved ones, which cannot be iden-

tified by CUBIC. Interestingly, CUBIC finds high scoring
tandem Pho boxes for the pstC-A-B operon in CCMP1375,
although this genome does not encode the sphR gene, thus
they are unlikely to be functional.
3. Genome wide prediction of SphR binding sites in each
genome
We have predicted all possible SphR binding sites in each
of the 19 sequenced genomes by scanning their genome
sequences with the two profiles of the Pho boxes that we
have constructed above (shown in Figure 1C and 1D),
assuming that a SphR binding site consists of three Pho
boxes with two 3 pb linkers. Given profiles of multiple cooccurring binding sites, our binding-site scanning algorithm computes a log-odds ratio function LOR(s) of the
scores (s) of the candidate sites in a genome. LOR is the
ratio of the probability of finding a SphR binding site in
the intergenic regions divided by the probability of finding a SphR binding sites in randomly chosen coding
regions. We use coding regions as control sequence
because it is less likely that functional SphR binding sites
would occur in coding regions (for details see Methods).
We have argued that our scoring function captures the
essence of true cis-binding sites in a genome so that if the
genome contains functional binding sites described by the
profiles, its LOR(s) will become positive when the score
value s increases beyond some threshold; and the larger a
LOR(s) value is, the higher the confidence for the prediction is [13]. In contrast, if a genome only contains similar
sequences occurring by chance, then its LOR(s) will be
around 0 or lower independent of the increase of the score
value s [13]. As shown in Figure 2, when s increases
beyond a certain value, the LOR(s) becomes positive for
the 16 genomes that encode the sphR gene, and the
LOR(s) values are generally high, suggesting that these 16
genomes contain more high scoring SphR binding sites
than one would expect by chance, thus these high scoring
sites are likely to be functional. In contrast, the LOR(s) for
the genomes of CCMP1375, CC9311 and CC9902, which
do not encode the sphR gene, becomes negative when s
increases beyond a certain value, indicating that the putative SphR binding sites found in the intergenic regions of
these genomes are likely to occur by chance. Therefore
they are unlikely to be functional. We argue that the lack
of strong signals for possible SphR binding sites in
CCMP1375, CC9311 and CC9902 is unlikely caused the
lack of representative Pho boxes from these genomes in
the profiles used in our scanning algorithm. Our profiles
do not contain any representative sites from CC9605 and
MIT9313 (Table 1), yet their LOR(s)' are still positive. In
contrast, though CCMP1375 has representative sites in
our profiles (Table 1), its LOR(s) is negative. We conclude
that our algorithm is not biased towards the genomes
from which the profiles are constructed and it is robust
enough to uncover true SphR binding sites in closely

related cyanobacteria even when no representative site
from them is included in the profiles. In addition, the
results show that our scanning algorithm can tolerate
some level of noise caused by including non-functional
sites in the profiles. Hence, we conclude that CCMP1375,
CC9311 and CC9902 are unlikely to contain functional
SphR binding sites represented by the profiles. On the
other hand, we have predicted putative members of the
Pho regulons in the other 16 genomes based on the presence of a putative SphR binding site found in their promoter regions at a statistical significance level of p < 0.01
(see Methods). These results are listed in the Additional
file 1: Table 1s-16s. The most interesting observations
from these predictions are summarized below.

sphS gene is not encoded in IMS101; and the gene in
MIT9313 is frame-shifted [16,17], and therefore is
unlikely to be functional. Thus, SphS in IMS101 and
MIT9313 may be activated by other regulators as suggested for MIT9313 where multiple regulatory genes are
induced by P starvation [17]. High scoring tandem Pho
boxes are found for the singleton operon sphR in IMS101
(Tery_2902, Table 5s and Figure 3) and for the operon crpsphR-sphS in NATL2A (PMN2A_0435-0437, Table 15s and
Figure 3), suggesting that these operons are regulated by
SphR in their respective genomes. However, the sphs/sphR
genes in the other cyanobacterial genomes are unlikely to
be regulated by SphR. Thus the auto-regulation of the
phoBR operon found in E. coli is not a general rule.
4.2. High affinity ABC-type Pi pst transporter complex genes
All the 19 genomes analyzed in this study encode at least
one Pst transporter complex. In most of these genomes,
the complex is composed of the phosphate binding subunit PstS, the transmembrane subunits PstC and PstA, and
the ATP-binding subunit PstB, whose genes form an
operon in the form of pstS-C-A-B. However, the pstS gene
is split out to form a singleton operon in CCMP1375,
CC9905, MED4, MIT9312, and MIT9313 (Figure 3). Furthermore, in the genomes of ATCC29413, IMS101,
PCC6301, PCC6803, PCC7421, PCC7120, PCC7942, BF1 and WH8102, the Pst transporter complex includes an
additional phosphate binding subunit SphX. The sphX
gene in BF-1, PCC6301 and PCC7942 forms an operon
with the genes of the other subunits of the complex in the
form of sphX-pstS-C-A-B (Figure 3). Interestingly, multiple
copies of the sphX gene are found in downstream of one
of the two pst operons in PCC7421 (Figure 3). High scoring tandem Pho boxes are found for most operons that
encode one or more pst genes (Figure 3), except for those
in the genomes CC9902, CC9311, MIT9313 and
WH8102, where no Pho box is found for the operon pstCA-B and the pstS gene. As mentioned before, Pho boxes are
found for the pstC-A-B operon in CCMP1375 through
phylogenetic footprinting, but they are unlikely to be
functional due to the lack of sphR gene in the genome. The
reason why these Pho boxes remain after sphR was lost is
unknown. On the other hand, while we did not find any
tandem Pho boxes for the pstC-A-B operon in CC9905
using phylogenetic footprinting (Table 1), our scanning
algorithm identifies a putative SphR binding site in its
promoter region with a score value only marginally above
the cutoff (Table 11s). The absence of SphR binding sites
for the pstS gene and the pstC-A-B operon in CC9311 and
CC9902 might be due to the missing of the sphR gene in
their genomes as discussed below. The lack of SphR binding sites for the pstC-A-B operon and the pstS gene in
MIT9313 and WH8102 might be due to the relative abundance of phosphate in their environments as evidenced by
the loss of the sphS gene in the MIT9313 genome. In addi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/156

tion, while experiments have shown that the gene cluster
sphX-pstS1-C1-A1-B1-B1' in PCC6803 form an operon
that is regulated by SphR through the three tandem Pho
boxes in the upstream of the sphX gene [12], we predicted
that sphX and pstS1-C1-A1-B1-B1' can form sub-transcriptional units, and a high scoring SphR binding site is found
in the upstream intergenic region of the pstS1 gene. The
possible function of this putative SphR binding site warrants further experimental investigation.
4.3. Phosphonate transporter complex and C-P lyase genes
Orthologous genes of the phosphonate transporter complex and the C-P lyase in E. coli are found in the genomes
of PCC7120, IMS101 and Bprime, suggesting that these
species are capable of utilizing phosphonates as a phosphorus source for growth. The importance of phosphonates for the prevalence of IMS101 in the vast open oceans
has recently been experimentally demonstrated [4].
Although in E. coli, genes encoding the phosphonate
transporter system (phnCDE) and those encoding the C-P
lyase complex (phnFGHIJKLMNOP) are located in the
same operon in the form of phnC-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-NO-P and are regulated by PhoB [18,19], the phn genes are
split into two operons in Bprime and PCC7120, and the
phnCDE genes are duplicated in IMS102 (Figure 4). High
scoring SphR binding sites are found for the predicted
operons phnC-D-E-G-H-I-J-K-L-M in Bprime, phnD-C-EE2-G-H-I-J-K-L-M in IMS101 and phnC-D-all229-E in
PCC7120, suggesting that they are likely to be regulated
by SphR. These results are consistent with the findings in
IMS101 that when tested, the phnD and phnJ genes were
activated by a phosphorus-deficient medium [4] in which
SphR was presumably activated by an unknown regulator.
4.4. Phosphatase genes

Aprime, Bprime, MED4, NATL2A, PCC6803 and
WH8102, in which the phoA gene is predicted to form an

binding sites are found in their promoter regions except
for CYA_1059 in Aprime, CYB_0274 in Bprime and
PMT9312_0720 in MIT9312 (Figure 5). Furthermore,
high scoring SphR binding sites are found for the PhoD
family members encoded in PCC7120 (alr4976 and
alr2234) and PCC7421 (gll0490), and for other families of
alkaline phosphatases encoded in Bprime (CYB_1198)
and Aprime (CYA_0781) (Table 5). These results suggest
that as in E. coli, alkaline phosphatases in cyanobacteria
play an important role in utilizing the Pi moiety in various
organic compounds, and this process is probably highly
regulated by SphR in most species/ecotypes.

5. Putative Pho regulon members likely to be involved in
phosphorus assimilation related global responses
It is interesting that high scoring SphR binding sites are
found for numerous genes that might not be directly
involved in the phosphorus assimilation pathway but
rather in some other important biological processes, such
as photosynthesis, carbon fixation and nitrogen assimilation (Table 2). We have also predicted that three other
classes of genes bear SphR binding sites, namely, transporters/porins, kinases and transcription factors (Table
2). In addition, high scoring SphR binding sites are found
for numerous conserved hypothetical genes across all the
cyanobacterial genomes that encode the sphR gene, which
are listed in Table 1s-16s. Their specific functions deserve
further experimental characterization.

4.5. Extracellular nuclease nucH gene
It has been shown that the phoA-nucH operon in PCC6803
is activated under P limitation, presumably through binding of phosphorylated SphR to the four tandem Pho boxes
in its promoter region [12], suggesting that NucH might
play a crucial role in the utilization of the Pi moiety in the
nucleic acids in its environment. However, the nucH gene
is not found in the genomes of BF-1, CCMP1375, MED4,
MIT9312, MIT9313, NATL2A CC9602, CC9605,
WH8102, which might reflect the fact that the presence of
nucleic acids in their ecological niche is less likely, such as
in the oligotrophic open oceans. In the genomes where
the nucH gene (Figure 5) is encoded, it is predicted to form
a singleton operon except for PCC6803, PCC7421 and
Bprime. High scoring SphR binding sites are found for the
nucH genes in the genomes of ATTCC29413 (Ava_2698,
Table 1s, and Figure 5), PCC6301 (syc0545_d, Table 6s),
PCC7120 (alr0276, Table 8s) and PCC7942
(Synpcc7942_1000, Table 10s, Figure 5), suggesting that
they are under the regulation of SphR in these species/ecotypes.

1. Degradation of SphR cis-binding sites after SphR was
lost
The low LOR(s) values of the putative SphR binding sites
in the genomes of CCMP1375, CC9311 and CC9902, in
which no sphR gene is found, indicate that these genomes
might not contain functional SphR binding sites. Since all
the CCMP1375, CC9311 and CC9902 genomes encode
other phosphorus assimilation related genes, such as the
pst transporter genes, which are in general regulated by
SphR in the other 16 cyanobacterial genomes that encode
the sphR gene, it is reasonable to assume that the last common ancestor of the cyanobacteria harbored ancient versions of sphR, sphS and other phosphorus assimilation
related genes that were regulated by the SphS/SphR system. Therefore, we conclude that the sphR and sphS genes
in CCMP1375, CC9311 and CC9902 were lost during the

course of evolution. Interestingly, CCMP1375 inhabits a
lower layer of the sea water in oligotrophic open oceans
[20], and both CC9311 [21] and CC9902 [22] were isolated from costal seawater, both of which are known to be
relatively rich in Pi [21,23]. It is likely that the abundant Pi
in these niches relieved the selection pressure to retain
sphR/sphR genes in these organisms, and have resulted in
their complete loss. Alternatively, the function of SphR
could have been hitchhiked by another regulator, which
resulted in its loss in these genomes. In any event, the loss
of sphR would have in turn led to the degradation of otherwise conserved Pho boxes as it has been shown that the
conservation of cis-regulatory binding sites is due to the
constant purifying selection exerted from the binding
interface of their trans-regulators [24].
2. Phosphorus assimilation pathways and their possible
coupling to other biological pathways
Our analysis results indicate that cyanobacteria as a group
of widely distributed microorganisms can utilize a broad

range of phosphorus sources, including free Pi, Pi-containing organic compounds and C-P bond-containing phosphonates, as the relevant transporters and metabolic
enzymes are found in their genomes. However, the distribution of these genes in each genome is quite different,
reflecting the unique environment where a specific organism inhabits. The only genes that are ubiquitously
encoded in all the 19 genomes are those that encode the
four subunits of high affinity Pi Pst uptake system,
namely, the pstS, pstC, pstA and pstB genes, suggesting that
Pi is probably the most widely available source of phosphorus for cyanobacteria despite its low concentration in
some environments. While many genes that are directly
involved in the phosphorus assimilation pathway are predicted to be regulated by SphR, some others are not. This
is in sharp contrast to their orthologues in E. coli, where all
these genes are regulated by PhoB [8]. In addition, the regulatory modes of the phosphorus assimilation genes in
cyanobacteria are also highly diversified in terms of the
distribution of the predicted SphR binding sites for the

Page 8 of 12

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:156

orthologous genes, reflecting the heterogeneity and complexity of the environments where they inhabit.
Intriguingly, numerous putative new members of the Pho
regulon are predicted in each of the analyzed genomes
containing the sphR gene. Many of these appear to not be
directly associated with phosphorus assimilation but
instead encode proteins that are involved in photosynthesis, carbon fixation, nutrients/solutes transportation, signal transduction (sensor kinases), and transcription
regulation (response regulators) (Table 2). A SphR binding site in the promoter region of these genes might serve
as a mechanism of cross-talk between the phosphorus
assimilation pathway and the pathways in which they
play a direct role. It has in fact been shown that nitrogen
fixation in IMS101 is restricted by phosphorus [3], an
indication of coordination between the phosphorus
assimilation and the nitrogen fixation. Interestingly, we
have predicted several nitrogen assimilation genes to be
putative members of the Pho regulon in several species/
ecotypes (Table 2). In addition, it has been shown that in
E. coli [25], B. subtilis [26], MED4 [17] and MIT9313 [17],
P limitation is correlated with up- or down-regulations of
both phosphate assimilation related proteins/genes and
other proteins/genes. For instance, in E. coli, only 39 Pho
regulon genes have been experimentally shown to be
directly involved in phosphorus assimilation, while the
number of proteins involved in the global response elicited by P limitation could be much larger as it has been
shown previously that at least 413 genes are involved in
the global response to P limitation in E. coli [25]. While
some of these 413 genes might be under the direct control
of PhoB, the others could be the results of cross-talks
between the phosphorus assimilation and other biological pathways. This is probably achieved through a network of signal transduction proteins and transcriptional
regulators that are directly or indirectly regulated by PhoB.
Such a regulatory network is also likely to exist in cyanobacteria, as it was shown that P limitation results in
changes in expression of 34 and 178 genes in MED4 and
MIT9313, respectively [17], though only 5 and 2 of them
are predicted to bear putative SphR binding sites, respectively. This suggests that the other genes are probably regulated by other regulators. Alternatively, these genes could
be regulated by SphR through different binding motifs. In
addition, it has been shown that the expression of the urtA
gene in PCC6803 (slr0447) [12] and in MED4
(PMM0970) [17] is strongly repressed during phosphorus
starvation. However, no sphR binding site has been experimentally identified in PCC6803 [12] or by our computational study. Thus the inhibition of urtA by P limitation is
likely to be mediated by a different regulator other than
SphR.

Conclusion
Different cyanobacterial species/ecotypes encode diverse
sets of genes responsible for the utilization of various
sources of phosphorus available in their environment.
Unlike in E. coli, only a portion of cyanobacterial genes
that are directly involved in phosphorus assimilation are
under the regulation of SphR in some species/ecotypes. In
the three genomes, i.e., CCMP1375, CC9902 and
CC9311, where the SphR gene is missing, the Pho boxes
have degraded to a level that is indistinguishable from the
randomly occurring ones (Figure 2). Thus, a regulator
seems to play an important role in retaining its binding
sites. In addition, we have also shown that the predicted
Pho regulons in cyanobacteria might include genes
known to play important roles in other biological process,
such as photosynthesis, carbon fixation, nitrogen assimilation, signal transduction and transcription regulation.
These genes might serve as bridging points to couple the
phosphorus assimilation pathway to the pathways underlying these biological processes.

2. Prediction of operons
Multi-gene operons were predicted using our JPOP program [27,28] for each genome. For genes arranged in tandem on the same strand and not predicted to be part of an
operon by JPOP, we considered them to form an operon
if their intergenic distances are shorter than 45 base pairs.
Genes that were not covered by this procedure were considered to each form a singleton operon.
3. Prediction of orthologs
We used the reciprocal best hit method [29] to predict
orthologous genes between each two genomes by the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/156

BLASTP program with an E-value cutoff 10-6 for both
directions.
4. Phylogenetic footprinting
Since the operons sphX-pstS1-C1-A1-B1-B1', pstS2-C2-A2B2, and phoA-nucH in PCC6803 are known to be regulated
by SphR through at least three tandem Pho boxes in their
promoter regions, we identified the orthologues (if exist)
of these genes in the other 18 genomes. We pooled the
entire upstream regions (if a region is longer than 800
bases, only the immediate upstream 800 bases were used)
of these orthologues in each genome according to the predicted operons. If an intergenic region is shorter than 100
bases, then 10 bases in its upstream coding region was
included. Then a motif containing two 8 bp tandem
repeats with a linker of 3 bp were searched in these
sequences using the CUBIC program [15]. The identified
motifs with a score above a pre-selected cutoff (p < 0.001)
were returned. A profile was built for these identified two
tandem sequences plus the linkers. A second profile was
constructed by combining the two conserved 8 pb blocks
in all these sequences.
5. Genome wide prediction of SphR binding sites
The two profiles of Pho boxes constructed above were
used to scan the genome sequences for all possible SphR
binding sites using an algorithm that we developed previously [13], which is briefly described as follows with some
modifications.

For each predicted transcriptional unit U(g1,...,gn) containing genes g1, ..., gn in genome G, we extract the entire
upstream intergenic region (if the region is longer than
800 bases, then only the immediate upstream 800 bases
were extracted), denoted IU( g1 ,...,gn ) for scanning for possible binding sites. If an intergenic region is shorter than
100 bases, then 10 bases in its upstream coding region
was included. All the extracted IU( g1 ,...,gn ) 's in the genome

G, denoted as CU( g1 ,...,gn ) for scanning for randomly
occurring motifs. All the extracted CU( g1 ,...,gn ) 's in the
genome are denoted as set CU. We say that IU( g1 ,...,gn ) and

CU( g1 ,...,gn ) are associated with U(g1,...,gn) and with each
of the genes g1, ..., and gn as well. The score of a putative
binding site found in an extracted sequence t (t ∈ IU or t ∈
CU) by scanning with a profile M is defined as

where l is the length of the binding sites of M, h any substring of t with length l, h(i) the base at position i of h,
p(i,b) the relative frequency of base b at position i in M,
q(b) the relative frequency of base b occurring in the background, and n the number of sequences in M. A pseudocount 1 is added to the frequency of each base at each
position in the profile when computing p(i,b). The coefficient a is used for normalization so that Ii is in the region
[0,1].
When multiple profiles M1, ..., Mz are used for scanning,
the score of concurrence of multiple putative binding sites
in the sequence t is defined as

sM1...Mz (t ) =

We now define a score for concurrence of multiple binding sites in a sequence associated with a transcription unit
by also considering the presence of similar motifs in the
sequences associated with its orthologous genes in other
genomes. Let t be the extracted sequence (t ∈ IU or t ∈ CU)
associated with a transcription unit U(g1...gn) in genome
T. If gi has orthologues in mi closely related genomes
G1,...,Gmi, let ok(gi) be the same type of extracted sequence
(ok(gi) ∈ IU or ok(gi) ∈ CU) associated with the orthologue
of gi in genome Gk. Then the score of concurrence of the
multiple binding sites in t is redefined as

highly similar to one another in their sequences, then the
orthologues information among them will not be used for
their respective binding site predictions to avoid counting
non-functionally conserved sequences. In the present

then used the following log-odds ratio (LOR) function to
estimate the confidence of the predictions in a genome,

LOR( s) = ln

p(SCU > s)

.

Since p( SCU > s) is the probability of type I error for testing the null hypothesis that IU does not contain a binding
site when SIU is greater than a cutoff sc, we used it to estimate the false positive rate of our prediction, i.e., the pvalue, and a cutoff 0.01 was used for the SphR binding site
prediction in each genome.
