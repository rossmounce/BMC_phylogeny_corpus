peptidoglycan hydrolase HydH5 of Staphylococcus
aureus bacteriophage vB_SauS-phiIPLA88

Abstract
Background: Staphylococcus aureus is a food-borne pathogen and the most common cause of infections in
hospitalized patients. The increase in the resistance of this pathogen to antibacterials has made necessary the
development of new anti-staphylococcal agents. In this context, bacteriophage lytic enzymes such as endolysins
and structural peptidoglycan (PG) hydrolases have received considerable attention as possible antimicrobials
against gram-positive bacteria.
Results: S. aureus bacteriophage vB_SauS-phiIPLA88 (phiIPLA88) contains a virion-associated muralytic enzyme
(HydH5) encoded by orf58, which is located in the morphogenetic module. Comparative bioinformatic analysis
revealed that HydH5 significantly resembled other peptidoglycan hydrolases encoded by staphylococcal phages.
The protein consists of 634 amino acid residues. Two putative lytic domains were identified: an N-terminal CHAP
(cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase) domain (135 amino acid residues), and a C-terminal LYZ2
(lysozyme subfamily 2) domain (147 amino acid residues). These domains were also found when a predicted threedimensional structure of HydH5 was made which provided the basis for deletion analysis. The complete HydH5
protein and truncated proteins containing only each catalytic domain were overproduced in E. coli and purified
from inclusion bodies by subsequent refolding. Truncated and full-length HydH5 proteins were all able to bind and
lyse S. aureus Sa9 cells as shown by binding assays, zymogram analyses and CFU reduction analysis. HydH5
demonstrated high antibiotic activity against early exponential cells, at 45°C and in the absence of divalent cations
(Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+). Thermostability assays showed that HydH5 retained 72% of its activity after 5 min at 100°C.
Conclusions: The virion-associated PG hydrolase HydH5 has lytic activity against S. aureus, which makes it
attractive as antimicrobial for food biopreservation and anti-staphylococcal therapy.

Background
Despite their relatively small size and apparent simplicity, double-stranded DNA bacteriophages propagate by
a tightly programmed infection process which involves a
number of steps. Adsorption of the phage to the bacterial cell wall precedes injection of the nucleic acid and
subsequent DNA replication, eventually giving raise to
new phage particles that are released after lysis of the
host. Muralytic enzymes play essential roles in the life
cycle of phages by degrading the peptidoglycan (PG) of
the bacterial cell wall, facilitating the entry and eventual

release of mature phage particles. Many DNA-tailed
phages employ the holin-endolysin lysis system to
release their progeny. Holins usually form large pores in
the cytoplasmic membrane of the host allowing the
endolysin to gain access to and hydrolyze the PG layer
[1]. In addition to endolysins which are synthesized at
the late stage of the lytic cycle, virions often harbour
murein hydrolases that locally degrade the PG in order
to facilitate the entry of phage DNA during infection.
These virion proteins are responsible of the “lysis from
without” phenomenon caused by some phages when
adsorbed onto the host cell in very high numbers [2].
Virion-associated murein hydrolases appear to be
widespread in bacteriophages infecting both Gramnegative and Gram-positive bacteria as shown by

zymograms of fully assembled virions and homology
analysis of sequenced phage/prophage genomes [3].
Several phages infecting Gram negative hosts contain
hydrolytic activities at a variety of locations within the
virions. A protein with N-acetylmuramidase activity is
often anchored to the base plate structure, as in the
T4 virion tail [4]. Similarly, a lytic endopeptidase was
found to be associated with the nucleocapsid of the
double-stranded RNA bacteriophage F6 infecting Pseudomonas syringae [5]. In the T7 bacteriophage, gp16 is
an internal head protein with transglycosylase activity
that is ejected into the cell at the initiation of infection
but is required only when the cell wall is highly crosslinked [6].
The presence of muralytic activities in virions infecting Gram-positive bacteria has also been demonstrated.
PG hydrolase activities have been described in the virions for S. aureus phages F11 and F85 [3], phiMR11
[7], P68 [8] and in the Lactococcus lactis phage
Tuc2009 [9].
S. aureus is an important human pathogen that has
demonstrated a unique ability to acquire antibiotic resistance traits at high frequency and can cause numerous
serious diseases [http://www.medicinenet.com/staph_infection/article.htm] including food poisoning [10,11]. In
the last few years, there has been a dramatic increase in
the incidence of community-associated methicillin- and
multi-drug-resistant S. aureus infections that can limit
therapeutic options [12]. Therefore, there is a growing
demand of new anti-staphylococcal agents.
In this context, attention has been paid to bacteriophage lytic enzymes such as endolysins and structural PG
hydrolases. Purified phage endolysins have been used as
therapeutics (so-called enzybiotics) against Streptococci
in mice [13,14] and have been proven effective against
other Gram-positive pathogens including Enterococcus
faecalis and E. faecium [15], Clostridium perfringens
[16], group B Streptococci [17], Bacillus anthracis [18]
and S. aureus [19-21].
Previously, we reported the isolation of the S. aureus
bacteriophage vB_SauS-phiIPLA88 (in short, phiIPLA88)
belonging to the Siphoviridae family [22]. The complete
genome sequence was determined (Accession number
NC_011614) and zymogram analysis revealed the presence of a phiIPLA88 virion-associated muralytic
enzyme [23]. In this study, we describe the structural
component of phiIPLA88 particle, HydH5, which exhibits lytic activity against S. aureus cells. HydH5 contains
a CHAP [24,25] and a LYZ2 [7] domain and the contribution of each to cell lysis has been analysed. Finally, we
have determined the optimal activity conditions and
heat-labile stability in order to assess HydH5’s potential
as an anti-Staphylococcus agent.

Results
S. aureus bacteriophage phiIPLA88 contains a structural
component with a putative cell wall- degrading activity

The virions of phage phiIPLA88 possess a structural
component with lytic activity as was previously shown
by zymogram analysis [23]. This lytic activity corresponded in size to that expected for the protein product
of orf58 (72.5 kDa), which is located in the morphogenetic module with most of the phage head and tail
structural genes. Computer-based similarity searches
revealed that protein gp58, designated here as HydH5
(634 amino acids, Acc. Number ACJ64586), showed 91%
similarity with putative PG hydrolases identified in S.
aureus phi11, phiNM and phiMR25 phages (Acc. Number NP_803302.1, YP_874009.1, YP_001949862.1). A
60% similarity was detected between HydH5 and the
recently characterized PG hydrolase gp61 of S. aureus
phiMR11 phage [7]. A phylogeny tree was generated
from alignment of the known staphylococcal PG hydrolases (Figure 1). The 25 different proteins were clustered
into two major groups. No relation between these
groups and the previous S. aureus phages classification
based on their genome organization was observed [26].
Interestingly, PG hydrolases from phages infecting S.
epidermidis strains (phage CNPH82 and phage PH15)
were found to be very similar to those from S. aureus
phages. Furthermore, conserved-domain analyses of
HydH5 identified two typical catalytic domains found in
cell wall hydrolases. At its N-terminal region (15 to 149
amino acids) a CHAP (cysteine, histidine-dependent
amidohydrolase/peptidase) domain was detected [24,25].
The C-terminal region (483 to 629 amino acids) showed
a LYZ2 (lysozyme subfamily 2 or glucosaminidase) [7]
conserved domain. However, additional biochemical
analyses of staphylococcal PG treated with HydH5
should be performed to determine the cleavage sites of
each catalytic domain. The middle region of HydH5
(150 to 482 amino acids) did not show homology to any
conserved sequences. Domain database and comparative
sequence analysis failed to detect any known cell wall
binding domain (CBD) in HydH5. A schematic of the
HydH5 protein is depicted graphically later in conjunction with deletion constructs (Figure 2A).
Predicted 3D structure of HydH5

The HHpred server and MODELLER program were
jointly used to predict the structure of the HydH5 protein and three different domains were deduced. The predicted structure revealed similarity with the crystal
structure of the E. coli Gsp amidase [27] belonging to
the CHAP superfamily [24,25] in the N-terminal region
(domain A, 36-156 amino acids), with the Staphylococcus epidermidis PG hydrolase AmiE [28] in the middle

Listeria monocytogenes PG hydrolase [29] in the C-terminal region (domain C, 491-617 amino acids) (Figure 3).
Domain A (Gsp amidase-like domain) is predicted to
have two a helices and four twisted anti- parallel bsheets. Two conserved catalytic residues are positioned
in the first a helix termini and its neighboring b-sheet
(Figure 3A). A topology similar to these residues can be

found in other members of this family of enzymes [27].
Domain B (N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase-like
domain) is comprised of two a helices and 4 parallel bsheets between the helices. The topology of HydH5 catalytic residue pair is similar to the template structure
but lacks any of the residues comprising the zinc binding site (Figure 3B). Domain C (mannosyl-glycoprotein
endo-b-N-acetylglucosaminidase-like domain) has five

predicted a helices. The conserved catalytic residue glutamine 519 was settled into the second a helix surrounded by three conserved aromatic residues, forming
one side of the catalytic core (Figure 3C). However, the
other side of the catalytic core usually surrounding
another acidic residue is not conserved. This acidic residue is usually positioned in a b-hairpin in the template
structure [29], while the structure of the corresponding
region in HydH5 is predicted as a long coil rather than
sheets. It is thus difficult to confidently predict where
the non-conserved catalytic acidic residue settles into
the predicted domain structure.
Antimicrobial activity of PG hydrolase HydH5 and its
catalytic domains

To confirm the predicted lytic activity encoded by
orf58, the complete gene and the regions encoding the
two identified catalytic domains were amplified by PCR
and individually cloned into the expression vector
pET-Duet1. Due to the high frequency of E. coli low

usage codons in orf58 (9.15% of the total codons),
HydH5 overproduction was performed in E. coli
Rosetta (DE3) pET-Duet1-orf58, which carries the plasmid pRARE containing tRNA genes for six rare codons
in E. coli. Truncated versions of HydH5 containing
each of the individual catalytic domains CHAP and
LYZ2 were overproduced in E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS
(Figure 2B, lanes 1 to 3). Attempts to purify the
HydH5 and derivative proteins after induction of E.
coli cultures gave low yields, presumably due to their
low solubility. Therefore, we proceeded to explore
their recovery from inclusion bodies which were denatured and independently refolded in several buffers
(see Material and Methods section). The purity of the
recombinant proteins in refolding buffer was at least
95% as assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The proteins
migrate according to their calculated molecular masses
plus the 6 × His tag (76.7 kDa, 17.2 kDa, and 21.1
kDa, for the full-length HydH5, the CHAP and the
LYZ2 domains, respectively) (Figure 2A).

domains. The structure models were generated by the MODELLER program and the cartoon representation of the structure models was
prepared using Pymol (http://www.pymol.org/). Secondary structure elements and conserved catalytic residues are labelled. Bottom panels A, B
and C plot the sequence alignments between three HydH5 domains and their corresponding templates. The template identification and
sequence alignments were generated by the HHpred server. The probabilities of remote homologous relationship for each alignment provided
by HHpred are 0.996, 0.993 and 0.996, although the sequence identities of the three alignments are only 17%, 14% and 22% respectively.
Conserved residues between the three HydH5 domains and their templates are labeled by colons under the alignment if they share similar side
chains, and with asterisks if identical residues. Position of a-helix and b-sheet in each domain of Hyd5 is indicated by cylinder and arrow,
respectively.

The PG hydrolytic ability of the different lysates and
purified proteins were qualitatively assayed by zymogram analysis against S. aureus Sa9 cells (Figure 2B,
lanes 4 to 6). Both cell lysates and purified HydH5
showed lytic activity. However, lytic activity was only
observed in the cell lysates of the catalytic domains,
probably due to either a lower specific activity or a
lower protein concentration of the purified truncated
proteins. These results support the functionality of the
putative PG hydrolytic domains found by the bioinformatic analysis. Nevertheless, their activity seems to be
somewhat weaker than that shown by other staphylococcal endolysins, e.g. LysK [19,30,31], phi11 [32,33],
phiMR11 [34] because when classical turbidity reduction
assays were performed, neither HydH5 nor its CHAP
and LYZ2 truncated derivatives were found to be active
against S. aureus Sa9 cells (data not shown).
The antimicrobial activity of purified HydH5, CHAP and
LYZ2 derivatives was quantified by the CFU reduction
analysis. 250 μl of exponentially growing S. aureus Sa9 cultures (4 × 106 CFU/ml) were challenged to 20 μg of either
the full-length or each truncated proteins (0.08 μg/μl, final

concentration). Staphylococcal viability counts were
reduced by 40.4 ± 1.5%, 25.7 ± 4.9%, and 23.1 ± 6.6%,
respectively, compared with the untreated controls. Therefore, despite the fact that lysis was not detected in the
zymograms with the truncated purified proteins both
seemed to be active against S. aureus Sa9 cells.
Moreover, the susceptibility of S. aureus Sa9 cells to
HydH5 seems to be dependent on the growth stage.
Cells collected during the early and mid-exponential
stages of growth were the most susceptible to the PG
hydrolase HydH5 (data not shown). By contrast, challenges using late exponential and stationary growth
stages cells showed a reduction around 50% in HydH5
activity (data not shown).
HydH5 catalytic domains have cell binding capacity
themselves

The relative low lytic activity of the hydrolase HydH5 in
vitro and the lack of a predicted CBD domain might
suggest a poor capacity to bind to the cell wall. To
assess the ability of full-length HydH5 and its truncated
versions to target PG, 5 μg of each protein were added

Discussion
To combat the emergence of antibiotic resistant pathogens, new strategies are being explored. In this context,
the effectiveness of phage-encoded endolysins to eliminate certain infections has been well documented in
mouse models [36-38]. The main advantage of these
proteins is their ability to kill bacteria with near-species
specificity and the reported low incidence of resistance
development [36]. Similarly, other phage lytic proteins

(Figure 5). The highest activity was obtained at NaCl
concentrations lower than 200 mM. All the tested
cations inhibited HydH5 activity even at the lowest concentration assayed.
To assess its thermal stability, HydH5’s antimicrobial
activity was tested and shown to be maintained at high
temperatures (45°C) while lower temperatures decreased
its activity (Figure 6A). Aliquots of HydH5 were also
heated to 72°C or 100°C followed by cooling to allow
refolding and the resultant activity tested at 37°C for 30
min against S. aureus Sa9 cells (Figure 6B). HydH5 was
not inactivated completely by any of the tested temperature/time combinations. HydH5 activity was detected
even after the strongest heat treatment (100°C, 5 min).
In this case, a 72% of activity was observed compared to

[35] was included. This protein harbours a SH3b CBD
domain and specifically recognizes staphylococcal cells
[35]. SDS-PAGE plus Western blot analyses showed that
all the 6× His tagged protein tested (full-length HydH5
and its catalytic CHAP and LYZ2 domains, and LysH5)
were able to bind staphylococcal cells, since a interaction of these proteins with His-tag specific antibodies
were detected when the washed cell pellets were loaded
in the gels (Figure 4). The size marker confirms the
expected size of the 6× His tagged proteins previously
deduced from the sequence data and, thus, the observed
shadow bands could be due to unspecific antibody binding (Figure 4). As HydH5 and its truncated derivatives
bind cells under these experimental conditions, a CBD
domain seems not be required for PG targeting.

PG hydrolases, may also contribute to the supply of new
antimicrobials.
Preliminary sequence analyses of the virion-associated
PG hydrolase HydH5 revealed two putative lytic
domains, namely, N-terminal CHAP domain and LYZ2
domain at the C-terminus. This protein organization
resembles that of other phage muralytic enzymes which,
similar to endolysins, appear to be modular enzymes
containing separate catalytic domains. It has been proposed that the evolution of endolysins, and probably
also structural PG hydrolases, has likely occurred
through domain swapping and that phage lytic enzymes
have co-evolved with host autolysins [39]. In fact, the
predicted 3D structure of HydH5 identified another central domain with remote homology to the AmiE catalytic domain of the autolysins AtlE and AtlA, the major S.
epidermidis and S. aureus autolysins, respectively. However, key residue changes seem to have been selected in
the active site of HydH5 despite the maintenance of the
amidase-like fold, likely rendering a reduced activity
amidase domain [28]. Whether or not these mutations
have catalytically inactivated the AmiE domain remains
to be determined.
It should be noted that LYZ2 domains have been
rarely studied in phages, being the phage phiMR11 the
only example reported so far [7]. However, it has been
predicted that this lysozyme subfamily 2 catalytic
domain (SMART accession number: SM00047) is widely

distributed in Staphylococcus phage, Staphylococcus bacteria and other related bacteria.
In this work, we have demonstrated the staphylolytic
activity of full-length HydH5 and each of its two catalytic domains by both zymogram analysis and CFU reduction analysis. Having two active catalytic domains
decreases the likelihood of resistance development to
this antimicrobial in that the pathogen would potentially
need two simultaneous mutations in the same cell to
become resistant. This is a very attractive trait for
potential antimicrobials. Further biochemical analyses
are required to definitively assign the endopeptidase and
lysozyme activities to these domains and confirm to
what extent both contribute to the lytic activity identified in our assays. It has been previously shown that
some individual endolysin catalytic domains can lyse S.
aureus cells in the absence of the complete protein. For
example, phi11 and LysK endolysins have active CHAP
domain constructs without either the amidase or SH3b
domains required [19,30,32].
Our results also indicated that the lytic activity of
HydH5 and the two catalytic domains does not require
a CBD. Bioinformatic analysis of HydH5 failed to detect
a known CBD. It has been speculated that some endolysins possess catalytic domains operating as cell wallbinding domains that direct the protein to target epitopes on the surface of susceptible bacteria [17,40].
There are also numerous reports of C-terminally deleted

Rodríguez et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:138
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/138

lysins where the N-terminal lytic domain maintains their
staphylococcal- [32] or streptococcal-specificity [41,42]
in the absence of their CBD. More surprising are recent
studies showing that the lytic activity of the B30 (11)
and PlyGBS [43] lysins were maintained or even
enhanced, approximately 25-fold, respectively, in engineered lysins in which the SH3 domain has been
removed. However, it is not entirely clear which part of
the protein determines the specificity. Based on the
results that showed binding of the catalytic domains to
cells, we hypothesized that substrate recognition in
HydH5 might be somehow mediated by its catalytic
domains. However, further analyses are required to
demonstrate the specificity of this binding for S. aureus
cells. In this regard, preliminary results about the
HydH5 lytic spectrum indicated that most of tested staphylococcal strains were susceptible to this protein (our
unpublished results). It should be kept in mind that, in
contrast to endolysins, phage structural PG hydrolases
might not require a CBD because they are delivered to
the PG substrate by the virion particle structure [3].
The proposed function of phage structural PG hydrolases during the first steps of the phage life cycle also
implies that their hydrolytic activity should only damage
the cell wall slightly in order to avoid premature lysis of
the host cell. For this reason, it is not surprising that
the lytic activity of HydH5 and both truncated versions
were not detected in turbidity reduction assays but were
capable of killing S. aureus Sa9 cells in the CFU reduction analysis. The variable quantitative behaviour of PG
hydrolases activities in different lytic assays has also
been observed by other authors [44,45]. The killing
activity of HydH5 was inhibited by some cations and
sodium chloride. Although most of the endolysins
described so far has not been tested for the effect of
cations, there are some which lytic activity is dependent
on or enhanced in the presence of calcium in the assay
buffer [32,35,46].
The highest protein activity was detected against
actively dividing log phase growth staphylococcal cells,
possibly due to a different conformation of the PG. In
fact, the degree of peptidoglycan cross-linking is significantly increased in stationary phase cells of species such
as E. coli and Bacillus spp. [47,48]. (An according result)
A similar result was observed with the bacteriophage T7
gp16 structural transglycosylase which facilitated infection of E. coli cells growing to high cell densities or low
temperatures. In these conditions the murein is more
highly cross-linked and the internalization of the phage
genome is significantly delayed in absence of gp16 protein [6]. Different susceptibility as a function of growth
stage was also observed in the Ply700 endolysin [46],
which is more active against early and mid-exponential
Streptococcus uberis cells.

Another feature that is characteristic of HydH5 and
other phage structural hydrolases is their thermostability, most likely related to a high refolding capability.
HydH5 retained 72% of its activity after a 5-min treatment at 100°C. Likewise, the structural lysozyme from
phage phiKMV infecting Ps. aeruginosa is also a highly
thermostable protein, retaining 26% of its activity after 2
h at 100°C and 21% after autoclaving [47]. By contrast,
the lytic activity of most phage endolysins is destroyed
by heat treatment [35,41]. This makes structural PG
hydrolases attractive antimicrobials to be used in combination with other hygienic procedures based on high
temperature such as those applied in food preservation
and as structural models for highly thermostable
enzymes.

Conclusions
The lytic activity of HydH5, the virion-associated PG
hydrolase from phage phiIPLA88, is due to the presence
of two active catalytic domains, namely, an N-terminal
CHAP domain and a C-terminal LYZ2 domain. HydH5
lysed S. aureus cells in the absence of divalent cations
and this activity was optimal against early exponential
cells and at 45°C. These characteristics along with its
thermostability provide it a potential to be applied as
antimicrobial against S. aureus.
Methods
Bacteria, phages and growth conditions

S. aureus Sa9 was isolated from mastitic milk and routinely cultivated in 2 × YT broth at 37°C [22]. E. coli
DH10B (Gibco, BRL), E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pLysS [50] and
E. coli Rosetta DE3 (Novagen, Madison, USA) were cultivated in 2 × YT broth at 37°C. E. coli transformants
were selected with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and/or 25 μg/
ml chloramphenicol. Bacteriophage vB_SauS-phiIPLA88
(phiIPLA88) was routinely propagated on S. aureus Sa9
[22].
DNA manipulations and plasmids construction

Plasmid DNA was obtained with the High Pure Plasmid
Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim,
Germany). Analytical and preparative gel electrophoresis
of plasmid DNA and restriction fragments was carried
out in 0.8% (w/v) agarose-Tris-Acetate horizontal slab
gels. Phage phiIPLA88 DNA was extracted and purified
as described previously [51]. PCR amplifications were
carried out using the PureTaq™ Ready-To-Go™ PCR
Beads kit (GE Healthcare, England, United Kingdom)
and the PCR fragments were purified using the GenElute PCR clean-up kit (Sigma Missouri, USA). The fulllength N-terminally 6×His-tagged protein HydH5 (671
amino acids) was obtained as follows. The primers H1F
(5’- GATTGAAATGGGATCCATACATGGG -3’) and

Rodríguez et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:138
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/138

H2R (5’- CACACCTCTGAATTCATATTTATCTCTTG
-3’) were annealed to template phiIPLA88 DNA. The
resulting PCR product (1934-bp) was cleaved with
BamHI/EcoRI restriction enzymes (sites are bolded in
primer sequences; Takara, Otsu, Shiga, Japan) and
cloned into plasmid pET-Duet1 (Novagen Madison,
USA; pET-Duet1-orf58). Truncated HydH5 N-terminally
6×His-tagged derivative containing a 161 amino acid
LYZ2 domain was obtained by amplification of orf58
with oligonucleotides LYZF (5’- CGGGATCCCAAGATACTTAAAGGCAAGGGGA- 3’) and LYZR (5’CACACCTCTGAATTCATATTAATCTCTTG- 3’)
which generated a 474 bp PCR fragment flanked by the
restriction sites BamHI and EcoRI (as a consequence of
the cloning process, 12 additional amino acid residues,
Met-Gly-Ser-Ser-His-His-His-His-His-His-Ser-Gln, were
introduced at the N-terminal region and 2 amino acid
residues, Arg-Asp, at the C-terminal region of the formal 147 amino acid LYZ2 domain defined by the PFAM
conserved domain database). Likewise, N-terminal
6×His-tagged CHAP domain was also obtained with the
oligonucleotide pair CHAPF (5’- CGGGATCCCGAAGTAGTAGAGTGGGC- 3’) and CHAPR (5’- GGAA
TTCTTATCTAACAAAATGTGTTACTC -3’) yielding
a 424 bp PCR product (12 additional amino acid residues, Met-Gly-Ser-Ser-His-His-His-His-His-His-Ser-Gln,
were introduced at the N-terminal region of the formal
135 amino acid CHAP domain). Restricted PCR fragments were cloned into plasmid pETDuet-1 (pETDuet1LYZ2 and pETDuet1-CHAP), respectively. All DNA
cloning steps were initially performed in E. coli DH10B
and then electroporated into E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS
and/or E. coli Rosetta (DE3). The integrity of all the
clones was verified by both restriction enzyme site profiling and DNA sequence analysis.
Heterologous overexpression and protein purification

High-level expression of the His-tagged protein HydH5
was achieved in E. coli Rosetta (DE3), while the LYZ2
and CHAP HydH5-derived truncations were expressed in
E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS. Exponentially growing cultures
(A 600 0.5) were induced with 1 mM IPTG (isopropylbeta-D-thiogalactopyranoside). After incubation for 30
min at 37°C, rifampicin was added to a final concentration of 240 μg/ml and incubation continued for 4 h. Cells
were pelleted, washed with 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH
7, and frozen at -80 °C. The recombinant proteins were
not found in the soluble fraction, and were thus purified
from inclusion bodies. Cell pellets from 1.2 l cultures
were resuspended in 10 ml per g of wet weight of 1× cell
resuspension buffer (iFOLD Protein Refolding System 2)
(Novagen, Madison, USA) and sonicated on ice (15×5 s
pulses with 15 s recovery between pulses) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Inclusion bodies containing

Page 9 of 11

HydH5, LYZ2 and CHAP proteins were obtained via centrifugation (8000 × g) and stored as pellets at -80°C. They
were denatured in iFold Guanidine denaturation buffer
and optimal conditions for correct folding (highest activity and solubility) were determined with the iFold protein
refolding matrix and via antimicrobial assays. The highest
activity and solubility was obtained by refolding HydH5
and LYZ2 in buffer A (HEPES 50 mM, NDSB-201 0.5 M,
CaCl 2 0.25 mM, MnCl 2 0.25 mM, MgCl 2 0.25 mM,
TCEP 1 mM, NaCl 24 mM, KCl 1 mM pH 7.5) and
CHAP in buffer B (TAPS 50 mM, NDSB-256 0.5 M,
NaCl 24 mM, KCl 1 mM pH 8.5). Fractions containing
HydH5, LYZ2 and CHAP proteins were diluted in glycerol (50% final concentration), and stored at -80°C. Purity of each preparation was determined in 15% (w/v)
SDS-PAGE gels. Electrophoresis was conducted in TrisGlycine buffer at 30 mA for 1 h in a BioRad Mini-Protean gel apparatus (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Protein was
quantified by the Quick Start Bradford Protein Assay
(BioRad, Hercules, CA).
Determination of the lytic activity

Antimicrobial activity was determined by the CFU
reduction analysis against S. aureus Sa9 strain. Exponentially growing cells (A600 0.5) were recovered by centrifugation, washed and resuspended in 50 mM phosphate
buffer, pH 7 to A 600 0.1. Then, 20 μg of protein
(HydH5, CHAP or LYZ2) were mixed with 4×106 CFU/
ml and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. All these experiments were performed in triplicate. Serial dilutions were
plated in triplicate on Baird-Parker agar plates, and survival was determined after 18 h at 37°C. Buffer alone
controls were included in the analysis. The antimicrobial
activity was expressed as the bacterial viable counts
decrease. This value was calculated as the dead percentage referred to an untreated control. Likewise, the ability of HydH5 to kill S. aureus Sa9 cells at different
stages of growth, its stability under different thermal
treatments and the influence of NaCl and different
cations were also tested using this assay. S. aureus Sa9
cells were harvested at different times throughout
growth: early (A 600 0.2), mid-exponential (A600 0.55),
late exponential (A 600 2), and stationary (A 600 3),
washed and resuspended in 50 mM phosphate buffer,
pH 7 to A600 0.1, and treated as described above. The
influence of temperature on enzyme activity was tested
by challenging S. aureus Sa9 cells with HydH5 enzyme
at different temperatures (4°C, 20°C, 37°C, 45°C) for 30
min and compared to control samples without protein
incubated in the same conditions. Temperature stability
was tested by incubating HydH5 (20 μg) at variable temperatures and times (72°C 15 s, 72°C 5 min, 100°C 1
min, 100°C 5 min) previously to the S. aureus Sa9 cells
challenging.

Zymogram analysis

To detect HydH5, CHAP and LYZ2 domains activities,
zymogram assays were performed using identical 10 ml
15% (w/v) SDS-PAGE with or without S. aureus Sa9
cells from a 300 ml culture (A600 0.5) embedded in the
zymogram. Samples were prepared according to standard SDS-PAGE sample preparation [52]. Gels were run
at 30 mA for 1 h in a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean gel apparatus. SDS gels were stained via conventional Coomassie
staining. Zymograms were soaked for 30 min in distilled
water to remove SDS and then overnight incubated at
room temperature in distilled water to detect areas of
clearing in the turbid gel.
Cell wall binding assay

S. aureus Sa9 was grown to an exponential phase (A600
0.8), harvested by centrifugation, concentrated 10-fold in
PBS (100 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 10 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 2
mM KH2PO4, pH 7.5), and stored on ice. 5 μg of protein
was added to 100 μl of cell suspension and incubated at
37°C for 10 min. The suspension was centrifuged at
10,000 × g, the pellet washed three times with PBS buffer,
resuspended in 50 μl of PBS, boiled with the sample buffer [52] and analysed with 15% (w/v) SDS-PAGE. Electrophoresis was conducted in Tris-Glycine buffer at 30 mA
for 1 h. Unbound (present in the supernatant) and cellbound protein were assayed by western-blotting using
monoclonal antibodies against His-tag (Sigma, Missouri,
USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Bioinformatic analysis

Phylogenetic position of the full length HydH5 protein
was determined by the Neighbor-Joining method. The
evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson-correction method and expressed in the units of the
number of amino acid substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated
from the dataset. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted
in MEGA4 [53]. To predict the three-dimensional (3D)
structure of HydH5, remote homology templates were
identified by a search of HydH5 sequence against PDB
database implementing in HHpred server [54]. Template-based protein structure modelling was done
according to MODELLER [55].
