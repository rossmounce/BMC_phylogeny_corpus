Abstract
Background: Pakistan is a highly endemic area for hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection. The aim of the current study
was to isolate and characterize strains of HEV in two mini outbreaks.
Results: RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed to cDNA. Nested PCR was done for the detection of HEV RNA.
The positive bands were eluted, cloned in TA vector and sequenced in both directions using genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystem Inc, USA). Phylogenetic analysis was done using MEGA4 software. We isolated two new HEV
genotype-1 strains from Lahore, Pakistan, based on cloning and sequencing of ORF2 region.
Conclusions: Our study suggest that both the human HEV strains were closely related to the Sar-55 but different
from the Abb-2B and 87-Pakistan-B HEV isolates sharing 88-91% sequence identity to Pakistani isolate Sar-55. These
results indicated that Sar-55 is the main endemic HEV strain in various areas of the country.

Background
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the causative agent of hepatitis E disease that is one of the six known types of
human viral hepatitis. It is endemic in many developing
countries including Pakistan and is an important public
health disease in Asia, Africa and Mexico [1-3]. Hepatitis E is food-borne/water-borne hepatitis as the disease
is primarily transmitted by the fecal-oral route via contaminated water or food. The overall mortality rate is
generally low (< 1%), however, it has reported to be
severe and mortality rates can be as high as 20-25% in
pregnant women [4-6]. The genome of HEV is approximately 7.2-kb, and contains a single-stranded, positive
sense RNA molecule [7,8]. There are three open reading
frames and a short noncoding region each at the 5’ and
3’ end [9,10]. ORF1 is located towards the 5’ end and
encodes nonstructural proteins; ORF2, which lies at the
3’ end of the genome, encodes the viral capsid protein;
ORF3 partially overlaps both ORF1 and ORF2. The
ORF3 protein has a cysteine rich region near its amino

terminus and has been shown to bind viral RNA and
enter into a complex with the capsid protein [10,11].
There are at least four major genotypes of HEV and
these four types comprise a single serotype [12]. Extensive diversity among HEV isolates has been reported
from patients with acute HEV hepatitis in Pakistan,
China and Taiwan [2,12]. It has already been reported
that manifold HEV genotypes could co-circulate in the
same region and; dissimilar genotypes of HEV could
exist in one patient. In Pakistan at least three isolates
Sar-55(87-Pakistan-A), Abb-2B(88-Pakistan-2B) and 87Pakistan-B of HEV have been characterized so far from
human patients with acute hepatitis E [2,12,13]. All
these three strains belonged to HEV-1 genotype and the
nucleotide sequences of these three HEV isolates show
about 90% homology. So far genotype 1 HEV has
become the dominant cause of hepatitis E disease in
Pakistan [11,12].
To our knowledge, no HEV isolate has been characterized from Lahore, Pakistan to date. In this regard we
examined two HEV isolates from human patients with
acute hepatitis E in two different mini-outbreaks and
determined its ORF2 gene sequence. Our study reveals
that both the HEV strains were HEV-1 genotype and

are divergent from other known strains of HEV-1
strains, confirming that HEV-1 is the predominant genotype of HEV in Pakistan even genetic variation exists
in different HEV strains.

Discussion
Specific HEV PCR bands were observed in two patient’s
samples. Our both HEV infected patients were adults
with ages of 39 years and 33 years that support the previous studies. In both case the infection was acquired
through fecal-oral route. It has already been reported
that in Pakistan, HEV remains highly endemic, mainly

affecting the adult population. A number of miniepidemics have been reported previously from Pakistan
and all of these appear to have been due to fecal contamination of the water supply [14]. The 348-bp DNA
band specific for the HEV ORF2 gene was excised from
the gel, purified with the AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction
kit (Axygen, USA) and cloned into TA-Vector (Invitrogen, USA). Both strands of the inserted DNA amplicons
were sequenced in a DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems
3730 DNA Analyzer; Invitrogen, USA). The consensus
sequences were made for both the isolates. The
sequenced portion of ORF2 gene of both samples was

submitted to NCBI GenBank data base. In order to
explore the evolutionary association of the HEV isolates
sequenced in the current study with other Pakistani
HEV genotype 1 isolates and those isolated from different regions of the world, sequences were aligned using
MegAlign program in the DNASTAR software package.
Using the Mega 4 software http://www.megasoftware.
net/ the phylogenetic tree was constructed.
Pakistani HEV isolates L-7 and L-11 shared 92%
sequence identity to each other and is closely related to
HEV genotype 1 Pakistani isolate Sar-55 than to other
genotypes. The L-7 isolate shared 88% sequence identity
and L11 had 90% sequence identity to Pakistani isolate
Sar-55. OFR2-based sequences indicated that the two
isolates in the present study shared 88-91% identities
and 9-12% variation with the other Pakistani HEV-1
genotype, and the maximum sequence identity (91%)
with another. Phylogenetic analysis show that both the
strains isolated in the current study closely clustered
with other HEV Pakistani genotype 1 strains from
human, forming a subgroup. Though, the isolated two
HEV strains come from Lahore that is geographically far
area from other areas from which the HEV-1 strains
were isolated initially, they still shared about 88-91%
nucleotide homologue with each other, suggesting they
may come from a common source where they may
emerged from a single isolate. Fecal-oral transmission of
HEV genotype 1 may be involved among human in this
region. Figure 2 show the phylogentic tree of Pakistani
HEV isolates sequenced in the present study with the
representative number of sequences for each HEV genotype selected from the GenBank database. The accession

numbers of sequences used for phylogentic analysis
were: HEV type 1 (M80581), type 2 (M74506), type 3
(AB089824) and type 4 (AB097812).

Conclusions
Both HEV isolates were related to Sar-55 but unlike
from the Abb-2B and 87-Pakistan-B. This leads to conclusion that Sar-55 is the main endemic HEV strain in
various areas of the country.
Methods
Study design and data Collection

A prospective study was designed and carried out in
March 2007 (First mini-outbreak) and December 2007
(second mini-outbreak) to determine the seroprevalence,
molecular epidemiology and genotype determination of
HEV infection in two mini-outbreaks of hepatitis E virus
infection in the city of Lahore, Pakistan. Majority of the
subjects were poor, less educated and were more exposed
to some of the important established risk factors for various infections particularly more exposed to viral infections. The studied patients were from 20 years to
30 years. The contact was established with doctors or
directly with the patients. They were explained the purpose and objectives of the present study. Those who were
voluntarily agreed to participate in the study were asked
for written informed consent, following which a printed
questionnaire was filled from each participant before the
collection of blood sample. The questionnaire contained
information on name, age, and sex, and socio-economic
status, potential risk factors for viral transmission, educational level and eating habits. The questionnaire also
included information about any history of jaundice, diagnosis of HAV, HCV or HBV in family.
Blood Samples Collection

Blood samples (5-10 ml) were collected into tubes from
all the enrolled subjects, serum was separated from each
sample within 6 hours, aliquot into three 2.0 ml tubes
and stored at -70°C. One aliquot was tested for antibody
to HEV and HAV by ELISA, routine biochemical liver
tests; second aliquot was used for HEV RNA PCR and
third was used for sequence analysis.

sequence of the isolate in this study and other HEV genotypes
1-4, using the neighbor-joining method and evaluated using
the interior branch test method with Mega 4 software. Percent
bootstrap support is indicated at each node. The scale bar
represents nucleotide substitutions per base. GenBank accession
numbers of sequences used for phylogenetic analysis were: HEV
type 1 (M80581), type 2 (M74506), type 3 (AB089824) and type 4
(AB097812).

All blood samples were tested for routine biochemical
liver function tests (LFTs) such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline
phosphatase and bilirubin. Blood samples were also
screened for the detection of antibodies against Hepatitis A (IgM), hepatitis B (HBsAg), anti-HCV, HEV (both
IgG & IgM) using ELISA kit techniques (DRG Diagnostics, Germany).

Primer design, detection of ORF2 capsid protein (ORF2)
Gene of HEV

For the detection and sequencing of HEV RNA, total 12
primers capable of detecting HEV strains with significant sequence variations were designed based on a multiple sequence alignment of the ORF2 genes of 18
different known strains of human HEV including the
three prototype Pakistani strains of HEV using Primer3
program http://bioinformatics.weizmann.ac.il/cgi-bin/
primer/primer3.cgi.
Briefly, total RNA was extracted from 100 μl serum
samples using Gentra RNA Isolation Kit (Life Technologies, USA). After cDNA synthesis, two rounds of PCR
amplifications were done using outer primers 9&10
(First round) and nested primers 11&12 (second round).
The PCR products were analyzed in a 1.5% agarose gel.
Gel Elution

Template preparation for cloning and sequencing of
HEV RNA positive samples were carried out with ORF2 primers using nested RT-PCR. The PCR products
were run on 2% agarose gel prepared in 0.5× TBE buffer
and purified in a column with a gel extraction kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, California) according to the kit protocol.
Cloning of ORF2 Gene into PCR 2.1 Vector

The PCR product of ORF2 gene was ligated into the
PCR 2.1 vector using TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, USA).
The kit protocol was followed for ligation and the reaction mixture was incubated at 14 °C for overnight. Heat
Shock Transformation method was done by mixing the
ligation reaction product (DNA construct) with 100 μl
competent TOP 10 cells (Invitrogen). The reaction mixture was kept on ice for 30 minutes following by heat
shock at 42°C for 30 seconds. After 3 minutes incubation on ice, 800 μl of LB media was added and again the
cells were incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 50 minutes. The white- blue selection method was used for
transformants selection. After incubation at 37°C the
transformants were spread on agar plates containing
Ampicilin and Tetracycline, X-Gal (40 mg/μl) and IPTG
(mg/μl). Next day blue and white colonies were
observed. The blue colonies contained self ligated PCR
2.1 vector while the white colonies contained desired
fragment in PCR 2.1 vector. So, white colonies were
selected for further investigation.
Plasmid DNA Isolation (Plasmid Miniprep) and
confirmation of cloning

Plasmid DNA was isolated by alkaline lyses and using
JET quick plasmid miniprep spin kit (Genomed, Fermentas) following manufacturer’s protocol. To confirm
the insert in PCR 2.1 vector, PCR was run with gene
specific primers using plasmid DNA as template and

Page 4 of 5

then PCR product was sequenced. Restriction digestion
of PCR 2.1 vector was also done with EcoR1 (Fermentas) for clone confirmation.
DNA Sequencing

The purified DNA was used as templates for sequencing
PCR in the Big-Dye Terminator cycle sequencing ready
reaction kit (Applied Biosystems). Samples were analyzed
on an automated sequencer (ABI PRISM 3100 genetic
analyzer; Applied Biosystems). Products were sequenced
from both strands to get consensus sequences.
Phylogenic Analysis

Pakistani HEV isolates sequenced in the present study
were aligned with the representative number of
sequences for each HEV genotype selected from the
GenBank database with the help of the Multalign program. Pairwise comparisons for percent nucleotide
homology and evolutionary distance were made. The
phylogenetic analyses of isolates were performed with
MEGA 4.0 software. Jukes-Cantor algorithms were utilized, and phylogenetic trees were constructed by the
neighbor-joining method. The reliability of different
phylogenetic groupings was evaluated by using the bootstrap-resembling test from the MEGA program (1,000
bootstrap replications).
