Abstract
Background: Molecular typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains has become a valuable tool in the epidemiology of
tuberculosis (TB) by allowing detection of outbreaks, tracking of epidemics, identification of genotypes and transmission
events among patients who would have remained undetected by conventional contact investigation. This is the first
genetic biodiversity study of M. tuberculosis in Venezuela. Thus, we investigated the genetic patterns of strains isolated in
the first survey of anti-tuberculosis drug-resistance realised as part of the Global Project of Anti-tuberculosis Drug
Resistance Surveillance (WHO/IUATLD).
Results: Clinical isolates (670/873) were genotyped by spoligotyping. The results were compared with the international
spoligotyping database (SpolDB4). Multidrug resistant (MDR) strains (14/18) were also analysed by IS6110-RFLP assays,
and resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin was characterised.
Spoligotyping grouped 82% (548/670) of the strains into 59 clusters. Twenty new spoligotypes (SITs) specific to
Venezuela were identified. Eight new inter-regional clusters were created. The Beijing genotype was not found. The
genetic network shows that the Latin American and Mediterranean family constitutes the backbone of the genetic TB
population-structure in Venezuela, responsible of >60% of total TB cases studied. MDR was 0.5% in never treated
patients and 13.5% in previously treated patients. Mutations in rpoB gene and katG genes were detected in 64% and 43%
of the MDR strains, respectively.
Two clusters were found to be identical by the four different analysis methods, presumably representing cases of recent
transmission of MDR tuberculosis.

Conclusion: This study gives a first overview of the M. tuberculosis strains circulating in Venezuela during the first survey
of anti-tuberculosis drug-resistance. It may aid in the creation of a national database that will be a valuable support for
further studies.

Background
The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that if
the current tools for the treatment and prevention of TB
are not improved, nearly 1 billion additional people will
become infected by M. tuberculosis between the 2000 and
2020. Among these, 200 million will develop the active
disease and 35 million will die from TB. By the end of
2004, 199 (94%) of 211 countries notified 4.4 million
new and relapsed cases, of which 1.9 million (44%) were
new sputum smear-positive. Among these notifications,
3.7 million were from DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short course) areas. The Region of the Americas
notified 235,187 cases in 2004 [1]. Venezuela covers an
area of 916,495 km2 and has a population of around 25
million inhabitants, and has shown a marked decrease in
the incidence of TB during the last years. The TB prevalence rate in 1939 was 98.6 per 100,000 inhabitants for
mortality and 111 per 100,000 inhabitants for morbidity
[2]. Since then, the incidence has decreased dramatically
to reach 6734 cases (26 per 100,000 inhabitants), with
most being confined within the 15 to 45 year age group.
Nevertheless, in indigenous populations, TB incidence
has remained very high (137.4 per 100,000 inhabitants)
[3]. In 1982, the National Tuberculosis Control Program
of Venezuela (NTP) implemented the directly observed
treatment and since 1994 has used a standardised sixmonth treatment for all new TB cases with or without culture confirmation [4].
Venezuela carried out the first survey of anti-tuberculosis
drug resistance during 1998–1999 as part of the Global
Project of Anti-tuberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance,
coordinated by the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) and the WHO. The survey enrolled 873 patients with smear-positive TB, and
living in 23 states from Venezuela [4,5]

ventional epidemiological investigations of TB outbreaks
and as a tool for studying transmission dynamics. The
analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms
(RFLP), which is based on the variability of the chromosomal location and copy number of the insertion
sequence IS6110, is considered the gold standard for the
genotyping of MTC [9,10]. However, this technique is
expensive for developing countries, is cumbersome and
requires a large amount of highly purified DNA, and is
limited for strains with fewer than six IS6110 insertions or
when rapid results are needed. Spoligotyping has emerged
as a robust, easy, cheap and reliable supplementary tool
for the molecular epidemiological study of TB. The establishment of an international database of spoligotypes provides information on the overall diversity of strain
patterns. The combination of spoligotyping with bioinformatics has been proposed as a potential tool for defining major circulating clades of tuberculosis bacilli and to
analyse the complexity of global TB transmission [11-14].
Spoligotyping has also been used to track TB epidemics,
detect new outbreaks, define high-risk populations and to
help to verify suspected false-positive cultures due to laboratory contamination and to confirm nosocomial transmission. In conjunction with other genotyping assays, it
has also been used to investigate the evolutionary genetics
of the tubercle bacilli [15-18].
This present investigation aims to provide an initial idea
of the genetic biodiversity of M. tuberculosis in Venezuela.
We used spoligotyping as a first-line discriminatory test in
670 strains isolated from the 23 surveyed states during the
first anti-tuberculosis drug-resistance survey. RFLP analysis of IS6110 and characterisation of the katG and rpoB
genes were carried out on 14 of the 18 MDR strains
included in this survey.

Results
The molecular characterisation of the isolates collected
during this study was not carried out and there is no information on the major circulating clades of M. tuberculosis.
The mutations involved in drug resistance and the question of whether the Beijing family of the M. tuberculosis
complex had spread into Venezuela have not been studied
until now. Molecular epidemiological studies have
showed the widespread of this family and its association
with drug-resistance [6-8].
In recent years, the genetic typing of M. tuberculosis complex (MTC) strains has been widely used to support con-

Study of population
A total of 873 patients with sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB were included in the survey to determine the
initial prevalence and acquired resistance to the principal
anti-TB drugs. Of these, 769 (88%) had never been treated
for tuberculosis and the other 104 (12%) had previously
received treatment (Table 1). Of the 873 isolates, 783
(90%) were sensitive to all four evaluated drugs and 90
(10.3%) showed resistance to at least one drug. Among
the 769 cultures of the never treated patients, 58 (7,5%)
were resistant to one or more drugs whereas the remaining 711 (92.5%) were susceptible to all four tested drugs.

Results of the first survey of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in Venezuela during 1998–1999.
Resistance to drugs: Isoniazid (H), Rifampicin (R), Ethambutol (E), Streptomycin (S) in never treated and previously treated patients.

The rate of MDR was 0.5% (4) and 13.5% (14) in strains
of never treated and previously treated patients respectively. Total resistance to INH and RIF in never treated
patients was 4% (30 patients) and 1% (8 patients), respectively. This rate was 23% (24 patients) and 18.3% (19
patients) respectively in previously treated patients (Table
1). Most of the patients with drug-resistant isolates (74/
90-82%) were aged between 15 and 54 years. Among the
90 patients resistant to one or more drugs, 72% were
male.
Analysis of the Spoligotyping patterns and comparison
with an international database
Of the 873 M. tuberculosis isolates from the national survey, 670 (77%) could be typed satisfactorily by spoligotyping. There were isolates of the 23 states surveyed
among the genotyped strains (Fig 1). The spoligotype (SIT
= Spoligo-International Type Number, a common pattern
shared by two or more isolates) was determined by comparing our obtained patterns with those in the interna-

tional spoligotype database of the Institute Pasteur of
Guadeloupe [19]. At the time of the study, the database
contained patterns for 29,363 clinical isolates, grouped
into 1689 SITs. Of the 670 strains analysed, 79 (12%)
were non-SIT (orphan patterns) according to spoligotype
database and the remaining 591 (88%) isolates clustered
into 102 SITs. Of these, 74 were found in the international
database. The inclusion of our data to SpolDB4 created 28
new SITs, 20 of them were specifically created with Venezuelan isolates. These were identified with the SITs: 1691,
1692, 1693, 1696, 1698, 1699, 1700, 1701, 1702, 1703,
1704, 1705, 1707, 1711, 1713, 1714, 1715, 1716,1718
and 1719) (Table 2). The new SIT 1691 (characterised by
the absence of spacers 3,13,15,21–24 and 33–36) comprised 14 strains isolated of nine provinces from Venezuela (Dtto. Federal, Carabobo, Aragua, Anzoátegui,
Sucre, Apure, Barinas, Portuguesa and Bolivar). Whereas
the remaining new endemic SITs comprised between two
and five isolates. Eight new inter-region clusters were created (SITs: 1694, 1695, 1697, 1706, 1708, 1709, 1710,

1717) with one Venezuelan and one non-Venezuelan isolate from USA, France, Latvia, The Netherlands, Brazil and
Australia (Table 2). Three isolates of indigenous patients
from the Warao ethnic group (Delta Amacuro State) created the new clusters SITs 1716, 1718 and the interregional SIT 1717.
Of the 591 isolates, 548 (93%) were grouped into 59 clusters (the number of strains in each cluster ranged from 2
to 112). Among the 59 clusters, 18 contained five or more
isolates, which we defined as major spoligotypes. The
total number of these isolates comprised 80% (n = 443)
of the clustered isolates. The major SITs were: 17, 42, 93,
53, 20, 605, 1691, 60, 905, 118, 50, 51, 333, 960, 34, 194,
1696 and 47 (Table 2).
The SITs found in our study allowed the classification of
the isolates into representative patterns describing families or clades [14,20], as 74% (411/556) belong to the
Latin American and Mediterranean (LAM) family (subclades 2,9,5,1,4,3,6), 13% (70/556) belong to the illdefined T (sub-clades 1,2,3,4,5), 3% (16/556) belong to
the Haarlem family (sub-clades 1 and 3), 1%(1/556)

grouped to the S family, and 9% (51/556) were classified
undesignated (SITs: 605, 905, 960, 397, 1692, 162, 1698,
106, 239, 443, 606 and 821) (Table 2). The geographic
distribution (C1) [20] of the shared types was as follows:
24 SITs were ubiquitous types (Ubiq) or are widespread in
the world, 20 SITs were endemic (Venezuela) and 23 SITs
were geographically limited (Loc) (Table 2). We observed
no strains belonging to the Beijing family among the 670
clinical isolates analysed.
Phylogeny reconstruction
We used Biolayout software to build a genetic network of
the SITs detected in Venezuela (Fig. 2) [22]. In this model,
the size of the circles indicating the SIT is proportional to
their quantitative distribution in this study. We used maximum parsimony principles and assumed an underlying
evolution model of the DR locus by deletion of single or
contiguous direct variable repeats (DVRs) to link most, if
not all, of the spoligotypes found in this study. Each arrow
represents a phylogenetic link between two spoligotypes
that differ by a genetic change, whether this change corresponds to single or many contiguous DVRs deletion. Fig 2
shows the phylogenetic clades prevalents as well as that

three variants of the LAM family – LAM2 (SIT17), LAM9

the genetic TB population-structure in Venezuela. A more

complementary genetic markers.

(orphan pattern), RFLP analysis classified eight (57%)
isolates as unique, with the other six (43%) isolates being
grouped into three clusters of two isolates (Fig 3). The
number of IS6110 per strain varied from 9 to 15. Of the
three clusters, two contained isolates from patients from
two different states and one cluster contained isolates
from patients living in the same state (Fig 3). We investi-

gated these isolates to identify the mutation associated
with INH resistance (katG gene) and RIF resistance (rpoB
gene). As summarized in the Fig 3, we found the
Ser315Thr mutation in the katG gene in 6 (43%) of the 14
isolates, identified as: VEN 479, 624, 769, 605, 611 and
617.
Mutations in the rpoB gene were detected in 9 (64%) of
the 14 isolates: VEN 479, 624, 738, 769, 357, 517, 605
611 and 617. No rpoB mutations were found in 5 (36%)
of the 14 strains phenotypically identified as MDR, which
corresponded to 1 previously treated patient and 4 never
treated patients. Two different mutations were observed,
which occurred in codon 531 and codon 516 (Fig 3). The
specific mutation TCG-TTG (Ser/Leu) of the codon 531
was detected in 5 isolates (VEN 624, 738, 769, 357, 517)
and the mutation GAC-GTC (Asp/Val) of the codon 516
was found in 4 isolates (VEN 479, 605, 611 and 617). Six

(43%) of the 14 isolates had mutations in both the katG
and rpoB genes (VEN 479, 624, 769, 605, 611 and 617).
Finally, when the three clusters were studied by RFLP analysis of IS6110, spoligotyping, and mutations of the katG
and rpoB genes, we found that only two of them were
identical by the four different methods, presumably
revealing cases of recent transmission of MDR tuberculosis (Fig 3).

Discussion
In 1994, the WHO and IUATLD launched a Global Project
on Anti-Tuberculosis Drug resistance surveillance to
assess the global extent of drug resistance. During 1998–
1999, the NTP in Venezuela carried out the first national
drug resistance survey through out the entire country for a
period of nine months. The sampling method was the
proportionate cluster method and the total of 873
patients were tested. The Venezuelan NTP has a long history of tuberculosis control and the results of the survey
showed a very low prevalence (0.5%) of MDR-TB in never
treated patients, similar to those reported in Canada,

Cuba, Uruguay, and Chile, which are countries with effective NTCPs [4,5]. However, the prevalence of resistance to
at least one drug among the previously treated cases was
30.8% and MDR-TB was 13.5%.
We used spoligotyping to molecularly characterise 670
(77%) of the 873 isolates, including isolates of the 23
states surveyed. It was not possible to analyse all isolates
by RFLP analysis IS6110. Nevertheless, as the molecular
epidemiology of MDR M. tuberculosis in Venezuela is not
know, we investigated the most of MDR isolates detected
in the survey using spoligotyping, RFLP analysis of IS6110
and point mutations of the katG and rpoB genes.
Comparison of our spoligo-patterns with the international spoligotyping database revealed that 74 SITs had
already been identified. We describe 20 new SITs specific
to Venezuela that were found in 75% of the 23 provinces
surveyed and show that these types are extensively dispersed. The six most prevalent spoligotypes (SITs 17, 42,
93, 53, 20 and 605) included the half of all the isolates.
Among the clades of M. tuberculosis complex described as

(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Microbiology 2006, 6:90

harbouring specific spoligotypes, 89% of the isolates studied belonged to three major genotypic families (LAM, T
and Haarlem). The majority of them belonged primarily
to the LAM family, which has a high prevalence in LatinAmerica, the Caribbean and the Mediterranean region.
This family recently was reclassified in 12 sub-clades [21]
and in this study we identified SITs corresponding to the
sub-clades LAM-2, 9, 5, 1, 4, 3 and 6. However, the genetic
network of spoligotypes showed that the LAM-2, LAM-9,
and LAM-5 do indeed constitute the backbone of the
genetic TB population-structure in Venezuela. A more
detailed picture of this network would require further
investigations using complementary genetic markers to
better identity the clinical isolates within the LAM superfamily of M. tuberculosis, which is highly prevalent in Venezuela.
The "ill-defined" T genetic family encountered in different
regions of the world [20] was the second most common
family. Within this family we found SITs that belonged to
the sub-clades T-1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 [21]. We also found some
isolates belonging to the Haarlem family, sub-clades H-1
and H-3. This family has a European origin and has been
described in the Caribbean and Central America, suggesting that it is remnant of the European colonisation
[23,24]. The Beijing/W genotype was not detected in this
study.
Our finding of seven new isolates belonging to SIT 333
(LAM-5), which has been reported in Guadeloupe, French
Guiana, Haiti and Venezuela, suggest a common origin.
SIT 605 had been reported in the international database as
only being found in Venezuela and the USA, and our
study adds other 18 clinical isolates, to this SIT, from
patients living in seven Venezuelan provinces. Further
studies are needed for a better understanding of the distribution of these spoligopatterns.
When the Venezuelan isolate spoligopatterns were added
to the international database, eight new inter-regional
clusters were created by matches with identical patterns
from USA, Brazil, France, Latvia, Australia and The Netherlands. Curiously, one of these new inter-regional clusters (ST 1717), which included an Australian isolate,
shared a pattern with one of our Venezuelan isolates
belonging to an indigenous patient from the Delta Amacuro state.
We characterised the katG and rpoB genes in 78% (14/18)
of the MDR strains isolated in the survey. We observed
that 64% of the isolates had a mutation in the rpoB gene,
whereas other studies have reported mutations in the 81bp core region in more 90% of MDR strains [25-27]. It has
been reported that a mutation outside of the 81-bp rpoB
region associated with RIF resistance, and the heteroresist-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/90

ance caused by a mixture of mycobacterial subpopulations with different susceptibilities to RIF may influence
the sensitivity of the molecular tests for detecting resistance [28]. In our case, the rifampicin-resistance of these
strains had been confirmed by two phenotypic methods,
however the mutation in the rpoB gene was no detected in
five of the fourteen strains analysed. Nevertheless, a new
test to confirm the resistance of those strains could not be
carried out because the cultures of the strain genotyped
were not available. The Ser531Leu and Asp516Val mutations detected in this study are among the most common
observed worldwide [29-31].
Mutations in the katG gene have been reported between
20 and 80% of INH resistant M. tuberculosis strains. The
mutation Ser-Thr at codon 315 of katG is the most common [32]. In our study, 43% of the isolates showed this
mutation, consistent with other studies [33,34]. Other
mutations in of this gene and other gene regions, such as
the inhA locus, the kasA, ndh, oxyR-ahpC intergenic region,
have been implicated in INH resistance. However, we did
not evaluate these mutations.
The characterisation of rpoB could discriminate between
the three clusters grouped by RFLP analysis of IS6110 and
by spoligotyping, as only one showed identical mutations
suggesting a recent transmission of MDR tuberculosis
[31]. This cluster contained isolates recovered from the
same province. The other two clusters had different resistance-associated mutations, indicating that these isolates
had acquired mutations independently, and were probably transmitted before the acquisition of drug resistance.
There is limited information regarding the distribution of
M. tuberculosis complex genotypes as well as few molecular studies on MDR strains have been carried out in the
most Latin American countries. A recent study describing
the genetic diversity of M. tuberculosis complex and the
world-wide distribution of spoligopatterns [21] showed
only a limited number of registered strains, particularly in
regions outside the immediate vicinity of Venezuela.
Greater financial means are needed to implement an adequate infrastructure and to develop molecular typing techniques for the national reference laboratory at NTP, which
will be an important tool for the control programmes in
these countries.
Although Venezuela has had, a well functioning NTP during many years, the proportion of immigrants from neighbouring countries with a high incidence of TB and MDR
strains, the reduction of TB control activities, and a similar
decrease in the locating and treatment of cases among
indigenous populations may worsen the current TB situation in the coming years. Other national studies incorpo-

rating other molecular epidemiology methods are needed
to evaluate the actual situation of MDR in Venezuela.

Conclusion
As it is important to clarify the molecular epidemiological
characteristics for effective tuberculosis control, we used
spoligotyping as a first-line discriminatory test. This is the
first genetic biodiversity study of M. tuberculosis in Venezuela and our results should be considered a starting point
for the creation of a national genotype database to support the National Tuberculosis Control Program in Venezuela.

Methods
Bacterial strains, drug resistance assays and patients
The study used isolates collected within the framework of
first anti-tuberculosis drug-resistance survey carried out
during 1998–1999 by the NTP of Venezuela. This study
included patients living in the 23 provinces of Venezuela,
with no distinction of sex and age. Information on the
patients – sex, age, and previous history of TB and treatments – were collected by a standard questionnaire for all
patients presenting with bacteriologically confirmed TB
by the laboratories of the NTP.

The specimens from patients were collected and sent to
the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) at the NTP for
culture in Lowenstein-Jensen medium. All isolates were
identified as M. tuberculosis complex using biochemical
tests: production of niacina, catalasa activity, nitrate
reduction, pigment production and growth. Drug susceptibility testing against Isoniazid (INH), Rifampicin (RIF),
Ethambutol (ETB) and Streptomycin (STM) was carried
out using the proportion method [35] and the BACTEC
460 radiometric method [36]. The supranational laboratory assigned by the Pan American Health Organization/
WHO to Venezuela was the National Institute for Food
Protection and Zoonosis (INPAZ), Argentina, which was
later replaced by the National Laboratory of Santiago,
Chile, as the supranational laboratory. Spoligotyping of
670 (77%) of the 873 clinical isolates, was carried out in
the Laboratory of Mycobacterial Genetics, University of
Zaragoza, Spain. The remaining isolates could not be analysed because some presented or contaminated cultures
what prevented the analysis or the poor quality of the
DNA showed not clearly defined spoligopatterns. A sufficient quality of genomic DNA for IS6110 RFLP fingerprinting was obtained from 14 of the 18 MDR strains
isolated in the survey.
Molecular typing
Spoligotyping
Spoligotyping was carried out as previously described
[11]. The DR region was amplified with the oligonucleotides:DRa: 5'-ggttttgggtctgacgac-3'(biotinylated 3') –

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/90

DRb: 5'ccgagaggggacggaaac-3'. The amplified biotinylated
products were hybridised to a set of 43 oligonucleotides
covalently bound to the spoligo-membrane (Isogen Biosciences B.V., Marseen, The Netherlands). Each of these
oligonucleotides represented a known spacer sequence
within the DR locus. DNAs from M. tuberculosis type isolate H37Rv and M.bovis BCG, as well as sterile water, were
used as controls. The hybridised PCR products were incubated with streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate and the
membrane was then exposed to the chemiluminescence
system (Amersham, Little Chalfont, England) followed by
exposure to X-ray film (Hyperfilm ECL, Amersham),
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The X-ray
film was developed using standard photochemical procedures after two hours of exposure. The films were scanned
and analysed using Bionumerics program, version 4.0
(Applied Maths, Kourtrijk, Belgium).
RFLP analysis of IS6110
RFLP analysis was carried out using Southern blot transfer
and DNA hybridisation with IS6110 according to the
internationally standarised methodology [9]. Briefly,
chromosomal DNA extracted by the CTAB method and
digested with PvuII was separated by electrophoresis in an
agarose gel. After electrophoresis, restriction fragments
were blotted onto nylon membrane using a vacuum blotter and hybridised with a peroxidase-labelled 867-bp
IS6110-specific sequence. M. tuberculosis strain 14323 was
used as a marker to allow comparison of the IS6110 patterns. The ECL Direct Labelling and Detection System
(Amersham Biosciencies) was used for probe labelling
and detection of hybridisation signals. The films (Hyperfilm ECL; Amersham) were scanned and the patterns compared.
Molecular characterisation of drug resistance
A point mutation in codon 315 of the catalase-peroxidase
gene (katG) linked to INH-resistance were detected as
described by Uhl et al. [37], and any mutations within an
81-bp fragment of the rpoB gene for RIF resistance were
investigated. Between 10 and 100 ng of DNA was added
to a reaction tube containing a PCR mixture: 50 mM KCl,
10 mM Tris-HCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 μM [each] deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 2.5 U of Taq polymerase (pure Re
Taq™ Ready-To Go™ [PCR] Beads- Amersham, Biosciences), sterile deionised water and 2.5 μM of each
primer.

A 620-bp portion of the katG gene was amplified with
primers KatG 904: 5'-agctcgtatggcaccggaac-3' and KatG
523: 5'-ttgacctcccacccgacttg-3', and the resulting product
was digested with MspI (Boehring Mannheim). After separation in a 3% agarose gel, the fragments were visualised
by ethidium bromide staining and exposure to UV light.

Page 10 of 12

BMC Microbiology 2006, 6:90

The rpoB gene was amplified with primers rpoB1: 5'-tacggtcggcgagctgatcc-3' and rpoB2: 5'-tacggcgtttcgatgaacc,
yielding a 432 bp fragment containing the hot-spot
region. PCR products were purified with a commercial kit
(ExoSAP-IT-USB Corporation). After sequencing (Servicio
de Secuenciación de DNA-CNIO. Madrid, Spain) BLASTn
software was used for DNA sequence comparisons [38].
Computer analysis
The patterns obtained by the different methods were compared. The dendrograms were constructed using the
unweighted-pair group method using average linkages
(UPGMA) after pairwise comparison of strains by calculating the Dice coefficient. Optimisation was set at 1%
and position tolerance at 1.5%.

The spoligotyping results were entered in a binary format
(1 and 0) according to the hybridisation results (positive
or negative, respectively) as Excel (Microsoft, CA) spreadsheets and compared to the updated international spoligotyping database of the Pasteur Institute of Guadeloupe
[19]. Only patterns with 100% similarity were considered
as clusters. At the time of the study, the updated SpolDB4
contained 29,363 patterns distributed into 1689 SITs and
2,860 orphan patterns consisting of entries occurring only
once in the database (SIT is defined as an identical spoligotype in two or more isolates). Some of the patterns were
included in the clades or families already described
[14,20]. A cluster of M. tuberculosis was defined as two or
more isolates with identical spoligotyping or IS6110 RFLP
patterns.
Phylogeny reconstruction
Biolayout software using parsimony principles [22] was
used to construct a genetic network of spoligotypes found
in Venezuela. In the model shown in Figure 2, each arrow
represents a likely evolutionary link between two spoligotypes differing by a single genetic change, whether by loss
of a single or of many direct variable repeats (DVRs), and
the size of the circles indicating the spoligotypes is proportional to the number of isolates in the cluster.
