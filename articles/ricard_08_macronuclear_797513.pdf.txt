Abstract
Background: Nyctotherus ovalis is a single-celled eukaryote that has hydrogen-producing mitochondria and lives
in the hindgut of cockroaches. Like all members of the ciliate taxon, it has two types of nuclei, a micronucleus and
a macronucleus. N. ovalis generates its macronuclear chromosomes by forming polytene chromosomes that
subsequently develop into macronuclear chromosomes by DNA elimination and rearrangement.
Results: We examined the structure of these gene-sized macronuclear chromosomes in N. ovalis. We
determined the telomeres, subtelomeric regions, UTRs, coding regions and introns by sequencing a large set of
macronuclear DNA sequences (4,242) and cDNAs (5,484) and comparing them with each other. The telomeres
consist of repeats CCC(AAAACCCC)n, similar to those in spirotrichous ciliates such as Euplotes, Sterkiella
(Oxytricha) and Stylonychia. Per sequenced chromosome we found evidence for either a single protein-coding gene,
a single tRNA, or the complete ribosomal RNAs cluster. Hence the chromosomes appear to encode single
transcripts. In the short subtelomeric regions we identified a few overrepresented motifs that could be involved
in gene regulation, but there is no consensus polyadenylation site. The introns are short (21–29 nucleotides), and
a significant fraction (1/3) of the tiny introns is conserved in the distantly related ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia. As
has been observed in P. tetraurelia, the N. ovalis introns tend to contain in-frame stop codons or have a length that
is not dividable by three. This pattern causes premature termination of mRNA translation in the event of intron
retention, and potentially degradation of unspliced mRNAs by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway.
Conclusion: The combination of short leaders, tiny introns and single genes leads to very minimal macronuclear
chromosomes. The smallest we identified contained only 150 nucleotides.

Background
Ciliates form an extremely diverse taxonomic group of
protozoa. They are the most complex single-celled eukaryotes, with some genomes containing more than 20,000
genes [1], Examples are the two completely sequenced ciliates Paramecium (39,642 genes) [2] and Tetrahymena
(27,424 genes) [3]. They are abundant in almost every
aqueous environment, from ocean waters to small ponds
and even pockets of soil water; and they can grow as symbionts, commensals and parasites in pelagic, benthic,
sapropelic or intestinal ecosystems. However, despite this
diversity, ciliates have one common and unique feature:
they possess two types of nuclei, each with its own specific
function.
The micronucleus of ciliates represents the germ-line and
contains high molecular weight DNA in the form of large
chromosomes, while the macronucleus encodes proteins
and RNAs required for somatic functions [4]. The macronucleus contains DNA on sub-chromosomal fragments,
which in Paramecium and Tetrahymena range from 50 kb
to more than 1,500 kb [1,5]. Macronuclei are generated
from the post conjugation micronuclei in a complex process that involves DNA elimination and large-scale
genomic rearrangements [5-10]. This process and the
genetic organization of the macronucleus have been
intensively studied in both peritrichous and spirotrichous
(formerly hypotrichous) ciliates [5,7,8,11]. In peritrichous ciliates, such as Paramecium and Tetrahymena, about
20% of the micronuclear DNA is deleted during macronucleus formation, the chromosomes become fragmented
and reorganized in sub-chromosomal molecules. In spirotrichous ciliates such as Stylonychia or Sterkiella
(Oxytricha), the formation of macronuclei is especially
complex since it can involve the loss of more than 95% of
the complexity of the DNA and large-scale reordering of
the protein-encoding DNA segments. Protein-encoding
sequences are joined and assembled into the proper open
reading frame, a process that depends on maternal guide
RNAs [12]. Lastly, the open reading frames (ORFs),
together with non-coding 5' – leader and 3' – trailer
sequences, are released as individual, short DNA molecules. These molecules are capped with telomeres, and
selectively amplified as individual "mini-chromosomes"
[8,13,14].
In certain spirotrichous ciliates, the development of the
new macronucleus involves transient formation of polytene chromosomes [6,10]. These giant chromosomes
resemble the polytene chromosomes of dipteran larvae
but are transcriptionally inactive and disintegrate shortly
after reaching their highest degree of polyteny [6,10].
Genome rearrangements, DNA elimination and, lastly,
reorganization of the residual DNA into "gene-sized

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/587

pieces" occur during the breakdown of polytene chromosomes.
Here we examine the structure of the macronuclear DNA
of Nyctotherus ovalis, a member of a third group of ciliates
known as the heterotrichous ciliates. N. ovalis lives in an
anaerobic intestinal environment. It is of particular interest because it possesses hydrogenosomes that contain a
genome [15] and that therewith have provided evidence
that these organelles evolved from a mitochondrial ancestor [16]. There are some reports [17-20] that the heterotrichous ciliates Nyctotherus cordiformis and N. ovalis, which
live in the intestinal tracts of frogs and cockroaches,
respectively, form polytene chromosomes after conjugation, similar to Stylonychia [21]. With respect to the structure of the N. ovalis macronuclear chromosomes there is
evidence from studies on individual genes, such as those
for hydrogenase [10] and alpha tubulin [22] from telomere-capped sequences [16], as well as from a set of 34
complete macronuclear chromosomes [23], that N. ovalis,
like Stylonychia, has gene-sized chromosomes. Alignment
of the macronuclear chromosomes with known proteins
furthermore has indicated the presence of short (< 30 nt)
introns [15,16,22,23]. We examined the structure of N.
ovalis gene-sized chromosomes and the regulation of their
transcription by combining information from large-scale
cDNA (4,242 sequences) and cDNA libraries (5,484
sequences, including 327 complete macronuclear chromosomes). N. ovalis possesses very minimal macronuclear
chromosomes, with short leaders, tiny introns and single
genes. The introns tend either to contain in-frame stop
codons, or their length is not dividable by three. N. ovalis
thus prevents translation of unspliced mRNAs, as has
been described for P. tetraurelia [24].

Results
1.1 Chromosome structure
1.1.1 Gene-sized chromosomes
We surveyed the genomic organization of the macronucleus of N. ovalis. Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that
the majority of the undigested DNA isolated from intact
N. ovalis was present in the form of low molecular weight
DNA (size range 0,5–10 kb; Figure 1; [15]). Southern blotting revealed that genes were present as gene-sized DNA
fragments (Fig. 1, [10]). To survey the genome organization of N. ovalis at the sequence level, we generated a
macronuclear gDNA library and sequenced 4,242 representative clones, as well as 5,484 cDNAs from a polyAplus cDNA library. It should thereby be noted that N. ovalis cannot be cultured yet. Cells have to be isolated by
hand from dissected hindguts of cockroaches. Only a
small number of cockroaches contain N. ovalis cells at a
density of several hundred cells per hindgut, making it
very difficult to obtain sufficient material for DNA/RNA
isolation. Therefore, performing a total sequencing of the

genome and the corresponding cDNAs will therefore be
extremely difficult if not impossible. In the current study
we obtained 4,755 non-redundant gDNAs and cDNAs
with a limited overlap between them. Assuming a genome
size similar to the published Ciliate genomes (27,000 and
40,000 genes) this corresponds to ~15% of the total
genome. Randomly selected clones were sequenced in a
single reaction. After filtering vector sequences and
poorly-resolved terminal regions (see Materials section),
we clustered the remaining sequences to remove redundancy. Grouping sequences with ≥ 97% identity over a
stretch of at least 100 nucleotides resulted in our identify-

ing 2,841 gDNA clusters (692 containing between two
and 23 sequences and 2,149 single sequence clusters) and
1,914 cDNA clusters (416 containing between two and
843 sequences and 1,498 single sequence clusters). These
will be referred to as the nr-set (non-redundant set).
Sequences with non-determined nucleotides (N) were
excluded from analyses that required correct nucleotides
at all positions, like genetic code analysis (see below).
In the 2,841 gDNA nr-set we identified 327 sequences that
were capped by telomeres at both ends, representing complete macronuclear chromosomes. In none of these could

we find evidence for the presence of more than a single
gene (see Materials). Moreover, we examined carefully all
the incomplete gDNA sequences for multiple genes containing macronuclear chromosomes. Here too we only
observed a single gene per chromosome. The vast majority
of the macronuclear chromosomes were smaller than 7
kb, and the sequencing of clones with inserts less than 6–
7 kb did not provide any evidence for the presence of
more than one gene per chromosome. However, there
were DNA bands (Figure 1a) larger than 10 kb that were
neither cloned nor sequenced. Therefore, we cannot
exclude the possibility that a few chromosomes with several genes were present. Similarly to the protein-coding
chromosomes, the nr-set was found to contain 12 separate chromosomes coding for single tRNA molecules. We
will refer to this pattern as a "one macronuclear chromosome one-transcript rule" rather than a "one-macronuclear chromosome one-gene rule", because the complete
ribosomal array (28S, 5.8S and 18S rRNA genes) is located
on a single macronuclear chromosome and the complete
ribosomal RNA tends to be encoded on a single transcript
in ciliates [8].
We examined the macronuclear chromosome length distribution for all 327 fully-sequenced chromosomes (Figure 1b). The smallest two-telomere-capped sequence we
found that encodes a known gene was a serine tRNA
(AM890335), with 233 nucleotides between the two telomeres. The smallest two-telomere-containing sequence
we found for which no homologs could be identified was
150 nt (accession number AM890150). This sequence is
the smallest putative macronuclear chromosome ever
identified (although, one should keep in mind that these
molecules lack centromeres, unlike true chromosomes).
The presence of this 150 nt macronuclear chromosome
was confirmed by nested PCR with specific primers. It
does not contain a substantial open reading frame and
might therefore code for a structural RNA. However, analysis of its RNA secondary structure did not indicate a significantly lower free energy than for random sequences
with the same base composition, nor did analysis with
miRNA prediction programs indicate a miRNA like structure (see Materials).
1.1.2 Telomere sequences
We sequenced 13 full length macronuclear chromosomes
using the same approach applied to other species [25].
Telomeres were observed with the sequence CCC(AAAACthe
5'
end, and
the sequence

(plus
one

the

(GGGGTTTT)mGGG
(GGGGTTTT)mGGGGTTT) at the 3' end, with n and m
ranging from 1 to 6. There appeared to be a trend of one
long and one short telomere, giving rise to a negative Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between the
number of repeats in 5' and 3' telomeres (-0.83925). This

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/587

contrasts with the report of Cavalcanti et al. [25], who
observed no clear trend in the lengths of telomeres in
Sterkiella histriomuscorum (Oxytricha trifallax). However,
the libraries were generated differently and our initial data
set of 13 sequences was small compared to the 1,028
clones in ref [25].
Using the motifs determined above, we identified telomeres on 2,249 of the 2,841 gDNA sequences. Of these
sequences, 327 contained telomeres on both sides, suggesting that they represented complete macronuclear
chromosomes. Several (larger) chromosomes carrying a
single gene have been sequenced manually using suppression PCR as in [26]. Because we used telomere primers for
amplification of the total gDNA for the generation of the
gDNA library, we could not determine the length of the
telomeres in the set of 327 exactly, as primer-shifting
occurs during the PCR.
1.1.3 Subtelomeric regions
We define the chromosomal leader as the subtelomeric
region that runs from the 5' telomere to the beginning of
the ORF and the chromosomal trailer as the subtelomeric
region that runs from the stop codon to the 3' telomere.
In order to identify these regions, we first oriented 1,459
gDNAs by predicted homology to a known protein in
UniProt (SWX, e-value threshold = 1.e-05). Subsequently
we compared these gDNAs with the 1,914 nr-cDNAs
using GeneDetective (see Materials) followed by manual
checking of all cDNA/gDNA pairs. Combining these data
with the putatively homologous proteins from UniProt,
we could infer the position of 14 ATG start codons precisely. The size of the leaders in these 14 chromosomes
ranged from 60 to 184 nucleotides, with an average of
112, while the length of the 5'UTRs ranged from 8 to 44
nucleotides. We followed the same procedure to identify
the trailers and 3' UTRs: using the cDNAs with a match
against the gDNAs and against a known protein we could
accurately identify eight regions running from the stop
codon until the polyA addition site. The 3' UTR length
ranges from 13 to 68 with an average of 36 nucleotides.
TAA was generally used as stop codon. The size of the
chromosomal trailers ranged from 33 to 125 nucleotides.

To examine whether there were any biases in the nucleotide composition of the subtelomeric regions, we calculated the Shannon entropy, the purine skew, and GC skew
for the 300 first nucleotides after the 5' telomeres and for
the last 300 nucleotides before the 3' telomeres.
761 sequences were found to contain at least 300 nucleotides after the 5' telomere and to have a BlastX hit in UniProt that allowed determination of the coding strand. The
Shannon entropy and the frequency of each base are plotted in Figure 2. For four different states (in our case, four

(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:587

nucleotides), the maximum entropy is two, corresponding to equal nucleotide frequencies. Lower entropies indicate a bias in the composition.
The results indicated a bias in the nucleotide frequencies
in the first 70 bases that was found to disappear at about
130 nucleotides. The region of the bias coincided with the
length of the 5' leaders (between 60 and 184 with an average of 112). To explain the low entropy, we examined different types of biases in the nucleotide composition. We
observed the strongest bias in the purine/pyrimidine
ratio, expressed in the so-called purine skew ((A+G)(C+T))/((A+G)+(C+T)). This index varied from -1 (only C
and/or T) to 1 (only A and/or G), with a value of 0 corresponding to no skew. More purines than pyrimidines
were found in the 5' region of the coding strand (Figure
3), especially in the first ~130 nt.
There were 505 sequences containing at least 300 nucleotides before the 3' telomere, having a BlastX hit in UniProt that allowed determination of the coding strand. As
with the 5' ends of the chromosomes, the Shannon

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/587

entropy indicated a bias in the last ~70 nucleotides, but in
contrast to the 5' leader, a low percentage of G and a general pyrimidine skew. In other words, symmetry was
found in the purine skew. Whether one starts from the 5'
end of the coding strand, or from the 5' end of the noncoding strand, there is a strong purine skew near the telomere. The pyrimidine skew at the 3' end of the chromosomes did not, however, extend into the coding region,
which showed a general purine skew (Figure 3). This
allowed us to predict which strand was coding in chromosomes without detectable homology to a known protein
(see below). The purine skew in the subtelomeric regions
has also been described for the ciliate Sterkiella [25]. The
skew represents a violation of parity rule two, which states
that complementary DNA strands tend to have the same
purine/pyrimidine composition [27-29].
1.1.4 Intron structure
To detect introns, we first performed a comparison
between the cDNA and gDNA clustered sets using GeneDetective (Materials). After removing paralogs and refining the intron boundaries by hand, we identified a total of

the various parts composing the chromosome and cDNA are displayed. The combination of short leaders, short introns and

48 introns in 27 gDNAs. This intron set will be referred to
as the experimentally-derived introns. All introns were
very short, ranging from 21 to 29 nucleotides with an
average of 24 nt and a median of 23 nt (Figure 4a). Intron
prediction based on the comparison with P. tetraurelia
proteins (see below) gave an identical median of 23 nt but
a larger average of 26 nt, due to a tail of a few relatively

long introns (Figure 4a). This is similar to the average
intron length of 27 nt (ranging from 21 – 66) reported by
McGrath et al.[23], which was based on comparison of
gDNAs with known proteins. Comparison of the average
intron length (27) with the intron length range (21–66)
in the analysis of McGrath et al., indicates their intron
length distribution also has a long tail. The existence of

these "long" introns (> 30 nt) is weakly supported, as we
do not observe them in our more direct gDNA/cDNA
based comparisons. Furthermore, by doing BlastX comparisons with a larger database (UniProt) we could correct
8 of the 15 long (11 introns ≥ 30 nt) and very short
introns (4 introns ≤ 18 nt) that were predicted by the comparison with P. tetraurelia to fall within the boundaries
that were identified for the experimental introns (21 to 30
nt). This underscores that intron prediction by comparison against a protein database depends critically on the
proteins in that database.

ond analysis in which we compared the N. ovalis gDNAs
in which intron locations were predicted using Genewise
[32] (Materials) with proteins with experimentally determined (gDNA/cDNA) intron locations in Paramecium
tetraurelia (these were kindly provided by Laurent Duret
[33]). Here we observed conservation of the intron position for 48 introns between P. tetraurelia and N. ovalis, out
of 145 introns that Genewise predicted in N. ovalis based
on comparisons of the N. ovalis gDNAs with the P. tetraurelia proteins. The fraction of conservation of tiny introns
between these ciliates therefore appears to be about 1/3.

The boundaries of the experimentally derived introns are
very similar to each other: exon|GTA......TAG|exon; where
"|" is the border between exon and intron (Figure 4b),
with only two exceptions for which the last three intron
nucleotides are CAG and TGG. Examination of the introns
with AlignACE [30], a program that finds conserved
motifs, did not identify a branch point or any other overrepresented motifs other than the intron boundaries. The
introns contain a high percentage of thymidine (35%) in
the introns versus 23% in the coding sequence. Guanine
(17% vs. 24%) and cytidine (17% vs. 21%) are low, while
adenine (31% vs. 32%) is more or less the same in the
coding regions and the introns. This is different from what
we observe for other non-coding sequences such as the
leaders, where the thymidine content was lower than in
the coding sequence. The introns in protein-coding
sequences appear to be of the type that is excised by the
spliceosome. Supporting the presence of a standard
mRNA splicing machinery, we identified seven homologs
of members of the spliceosome complex: Splicing factor
3B subunit 1, Splicing factor 3A subunit 3, splicing factor
YT521, Splicing factor 1, splicing factor SLU7, Spliceosomal U5 snRNP-specific 15 kDa protein and Splicing factor U2AF 35 kDa subunit.

Jaillon et al. [24] have reported that introns which lack inframe stop codons tend not to occur in lengths dividable
by three. This guarantees that unspliced mRNAs will be
recognized by the NMD by having premature stop
codons, either in the intron itself or caused by the frame
shift resulting from the retained intron. Such a trend is
also visible in the N. ovalis predicted introns. Out of the
145 introns, 40 do not have an in-frame stop codon (TAA,
TAG or TGA, see below). Out of these 40 only 3 have a
length that is dividable by three. In contrast, of the 105
introns that do have an in-frame stop codon, 60 have a
length dividable by three. There is thus, among the introns
without in-frame stop codons, a significant under-representation of introns dividable by three compared to
introns that do contain stop codons (P = 1E-7, based on
the chi squared test).

1.1.5 Intron conservation
To examine the evolutionary conservation of the intron
positions, we compared the 48 introns of the 27 N. ovalis
gDNA sequences (above) with those of their closest
homologs in the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia. The latter
also has tiny introns (comprising between 20 and 33
nucleotides [31]) for which a large number have been
experimentally determined (Materials). Of the ten introns
in N. ovalis sequences with significant best hits in P. tetraurelia, in which the aligned regions "covered" the N. ovalis
introns, four occur at the same position in P. tetraurelia. A
typical example is the succinyl CoA ligase gene that contains two introns in N. ovalis. One of these is conserved in
P. tetraurelia, which itself has two introns in the region
that can be confidently aligned between the two species
(Figure 4c). To our knowledge this is the first observation
of the conservation of these tiny introns. In order to quantify the level of intron conservation, we performed a sec-

The conservation of tiny introns between the very distantly-related P. tetraurelia and N. ovalis indicates that
some introns can be traced back to early ciliate evolution.
We also examined conservation of intron positions with
Tetrahymena thermophila, which does not contain tiny
introns (containing between 53 and 978 nt, see Figure 6).
In the sequence alignments, the positions of three T. thermophila introns lay within 2 amino acids of introns in N.
ovalis [see Additional file 1]. This would argue for independent evolution of intron position and intron length.
Alternatively, in ciliates with tiny introns it is possible that
intron length is strongly reduced during the development
of the macronucleus. In any case, the total number of conserved introns for which there is experimental evidence in
at least one species is small, and precludes definitive statements regarding their independent evolution from
genome structure. We could not detect any conservation
of intron positions in the more distantly-related alveolate
Plasmodium falciparum. We searched for gDNAs resulting
from bacterial to ciliate or archaeal to ciliate Horizontal
Gene Transfer events using a similar method as we used
for rumen ciliates [34]. In this set we found no evidence
of introns.
With a length between 21 and 29 nucleotides and an average of ~24 nucleotides, the introns in the N. ovalis set

described in this report are among the smallest spliceosomal introns known. The shortest spliceosomal introns,
18 nucleotides, have been described in the nucleomorph
of a chlorarachniophyte algae [35]. Several short introns
have been described in ciliates in the literature. For example, the introns in P. tetraurelia are between 20 and 33 nt
[31], and the introns in Sterkiella histriomuscorum are
between 31 and 137 nt in length [36]. In Euplotes octocarinatus, introns were detected in a range of 30 to 145 nt
[37,38]. Four short introns, ranging from 37 to 47 nt, were
also described in gamma tubulin encoding genes of
Euplotes crassus [39].
1.2 Transcriptional properties
1.2.1 Orientation of the sequences
The macronuclear chromosomes we sequenced contain
just one gene. Being able to determine the coding strand
of these sequences would be a first step in annotating
those sequences without hits against known proteins. We
used the observation that the coding strand has a positive
purine/pyrimidine ratio (Figure 3) to orient the sequences
that lack hits to known proteins. Two other methods that
we applied were: 1) finding the best ORF using getORF
from EMBOSS and 2) calculating the GC gradient [40] on
the set of 1,459 sequences having a match against a
known protein from UniProt (UniProt set), as a benchmark. The purine/pyrimidine ratio was the best indicator
of the coding strand with a good prediction in 97% of the
cases, compared to 80% for the ORF prediction and ~50%
for the GC gradient. Using the purine/pyrimidine ratio
allowed us to orient all 1,382 sequences that did not
belong to the UniProt-set with 97% confidence.
1.2.2 Motif discovery
In all ciliate species with gene-sized macronuclear chromosomes which have been studied, approximately 95%
of germ-line DNA is eliminated during the development
of the macronucleus [41]. The incredibly short leader and
trailer that remain must therefore contain a high density
of signals for processes like telomere addition, replication,
copy regulation and transcription. Thus, ciliates provide a
uniquely compact model to study these basic eukaryotic
regulatory systems. Because we identified homologs of a
number of transcription factors (E2F5 family transcription factor, transcription factor Dp-2, MADS box transcription factor, C-MYB-like transcription factor and
transcription factor E2F/dimerisation partner (TDP)) in
our data set, we can also expect their regulatory elements
to be present in the N. ovalis macronuclear genome. We
searched our nr-set of N. ovalis sequences for novel motifs
and known Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS).

As genes with related functions are often co-regulated,
they may be expected to contain comparable signals in
their non-coding DNA [30,42]. Therefore, to search for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/587

meaningful motifs, we first composed groups of related
genes based on a number of different criteria. Genes were
clustered based on membership of an orthologous group
(OG, see Materials) to detect signals shared by paralogous
genes, or on the membership of a common pathway. For
the latter we used both the KEGG pathways and EcoCyc
pathways. In addition we composed a set of 12 nonredundant tRNAs identified with tRNAscan-SE [43]. For
each group of sequences (except for tRNAs, see below), we
searched the first 200 nucleotides after the 5'-telomere
using AlignACE [30] and MEME [44]. Note that 200 nt
should be enough to cover the complete upstream noncoding DNA, even in the sequences where no translation
start site could be identified (Figure 3).
Using this approach, we could identify several potential
regulatory motifs. First, MEME identified a motif with the
consensus sequence AATTAACATGAGTC in the upstream
regions of 12 Chaperonin GroEL genes of the HSP60 family (COG0459; the data set contained the alpha, beta, eta,
theta, gamma and epsilon subunits and HSP60). Searching this motif with MAST, we found that it also occurs
upstream of a protein from the superfamily DNA and
RNA helicase, with the motif profile fitting the helicase
sequence with an e-value of 3.6e-06. HSP60 and helicase
could be regulated concomitantly as they can both be regulated by DNA-dependent protein kinase [45,46].
Another study also reported that dysregulated expression
of an RNA helicase leads to an altered distribution of
HSP60 [47].
Second, we identified conserved motifs in the tRNA chromosomes, by searching the entire set of gene-sized tRNA
chromosomes (Figure 5). Two of the motifs we identified
have very well-conserved positions: a likely TATA box
(~35 nt upstream of the tRNA), and a motif with consensus GCAATTTTTATTCC (~2 nt downstream). This last
motif corresponds to the termination signal of RNA
polymerase III transcription [48,49]. Searching for these
motifs in the whole nr-set using MAST [50] identified no
other sequences that contained these motifs, which is not
surprising, as the protein coding genes are transcribed by
RNA polymerase II. The TATA box could be identified in
some sequences that we checked manually.
In an additional search for known TFBS, we used MAST
[50] to search for the 398 Transfac MATRIX 7.0 motifs
[51]. These results did not link sets of functionally related
sequences (e.g. shared KEGG pathway or COG functional
category, not shown).
Considering the few motifs identified in these analyses, it
should also be noted that the Transfac profiles we
searched for are specific for several eukaryotic species but
not for ciliates. Furthermore, previous studies of spirotri-

Schematic view of the structure of tRNA macronuclear chromosomes. The motifs found with MEME in more than
half of the 12 nr-tRNAs are displayed as a WebLogo picture, together with their positions (from..to (~average)). 0 corresponds to start of the tRNA.

chous ciliates have identified few conserved motifs, leading to the suggestion that telomeres may also play a role
in regulating gene expression/DNA replication [52].
In the trailer region we searched for the consensus eukaryotic polyadenylation signal AATAAA [53,54]. This motif
was not found in our sequences, confirming a previous
study on a smaller dataset [55]. Examining by hand the
eight pieces of trailer sequences identified with the help of
cDNAs and known homologs [see Additional file 2]
revealed no degenerate motif either. McGrath and coworkers [23] have reported an over-represented long
motif in the 5' and 3' ends in their set of 34 complete chromosomes, and a shorter subsequence of that motif in the
5' and 3' ends of all the chromosomes. Neither the consensus sequence of the long motif, nor its shorter subsequence was present in our dataset, nor could we detect
significant similarity to the consensus sequences in our
gDNAs.
1.2.3 Genetic code
In a set of 328 cDNAs that could confidently be aligned
with the C-terminus of known proteins, TAA was most
often the first codon after the C-terminus of the protein
alignment (141 cases), and therewith obviously the stop
codon. Consistent with earlier findings that were based on
smaller sets of sequences [23,55] we conclude that N. ovalis preferentially uses UAA as a stop codon. UAG was
rarely observed in the stop codon position (in 5 out of
328 cDNAs) and UGA was never observed in the stop
codon position. When reexamining the published
sequences from McGrath et al.[23] and Destables et

al.[55] we noticed that when using this strict criterion of
requiring an alignment until the end of the C-terminus of
a known protein and only considering as potential stop
codon the first codon 3' of the protein alignment, also in
these sets TAA was the only stop codon that could confidently be assigned. Nevertheless, UGA and UAG are, like
UAA, avoided in cDNAs that could be aligned with known
proteins or protein domains. Ciliates have a wide variety
of genetic codes [56,57]. For example, several deeplydiverging lineages, including the genera Tetrahymena and
Paramecium, Stylonychia and Sterkiella, and Diophrys [58]
may have independently reassigned UAA and UAG to
glutamine, using UGA as their only stop codon [59]. On
the other hand, Euplotes translates UGA into cysteine and
uses UAA and UAG as stop codons[60], while UGA
encodes tryptophan in the independent lineages including Blepharisma and Colpoda [61]. Nyctotherus thus seems
most similar to Euplotes, using predominantly UAA, and
sometimes UAG as a stop codon. The absence of strong
positive evidence for the usage of UAG and UGA is consistent with a previous claim [57] that Nyctotherus might
represent an evolutionary intermediate between the full
standard genetic code and a variant code. We could, however, find no evidence for the usage of UGA or UAG as a
sense codon, and combined with earlier findings of the
usage of UAA and UGA as stop codon [23] this argues for
a standard genetic code in N. ovalis.

Discussion and conclusions
Evolution of macronuclear gene structure
To analyze the evolution of ciliate macronuclear genome
structure we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the 18S

RNA from the small ribosomal subunit from various ciliates (Figure 6). The Clevelandelids (Nyctotherus) form a
monophyletic group with the Armophorea (Metopus,
Caenomorphidae gen. sp.) and are a sister group of the
Spirotrichea that contains Sterkiella (Oxytricha), Stylonychia
and Euplotes. Despite their differences in ecology (respectively anaerobic and aerobic), these two sister groups
share
many
features,
as
already
mentioned
[3,6,8,15,16,21,25,31,52,62-67]. Another class of ciliates,
namely the Phyllopharyngea, also possess gene-sized
macronuclear chromosomes, but they are not monophyletic with the Spirotrich/Clevelandelids/Armophorids
[22]. 'Invention' of gene-sized-macronuclear chromosomes has therefore either preceded their taxonomic separation or more likely arisen several times in evolution.
Rumen ciliates that are included in the cluster of 'fragmented' macronuclear chromosomes have much larger
(40–80 kb) macronuclear chromosomes with many genes
per chromosome (Hackstein, unpublished data). They
may represent an intermediate between the 'Tetrahymena/
Paramecium" type of long macronuclear chromosomes
and gene-sized-chromosomes. The presence of tiny
introns does not correlate with the presence of mini-chromosomes. Rather, the exact conservation of the location
of a substantial number of the tiny introns between N.
ovalis and P. tetraurelia argues for independent evolution
of the length of macronuclear chromosomes and intron
size. We currently have scarce information about the
germ-line micronuclear genome of N. ovalis. However, all

Chromosome structure
General information

the items discussed above reveal a striking similarity with
the macronuclear genome organization of the spirotrichous ciliates [8,13,59,65]. Codon usage suggests that
Nyctotherus may be more closely related to Euplotes than to
the Oxytrichids; however there is no evidence that it has a
non-standard genetic code.

Methods
Hybridization
The α2-tubulin clone [68] and the β2-tubulin clone [69]
from Stylonychia lemnae were labeled with α-[32P]-dATP by
PCR with M13-forward and -reverse primers.

Genomic DNA from Nyctotherus was separated on a 0.7%
(w/v) native agarose gel and blotted onto a Hybond N+
membrane (Amersham) by downward alkaline southern
blotting. The filter was pre-hybridized for 1 h at 65°C in
hybridization solution (6× SSC, 5× Denhardts solution,
and 0.5% SDS (w/v)). After pre-hybridization, the hybridization solution was refreshed and the 32P-labeled probe
was added. The filter was hybridized at 65°C for 16–19 h.
The hybridized filter was washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1%
SDS (w/v) and twice in 0.5% SSC, 0.1% SDS (w/v) at
65°C. Depending on the signal on the filter an extra washing step with 0.2% SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C was included.
Autoradiograms were exposed for 0.5–4 h at -70°C with
intensifying screens.

Construction of libraries and sequencing
gDNA of Nyctotherus ovalis was prepared by dissolving living Nyctotherus ovalis cells, purified by electromigration
[70], in 8 M guanidiniumchloride. After extraction with
phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) a portion
was analyzed on a 1% agarose gel and 5 fractions of different "size" were isolated. Every fraction was amplified by
PCR with telomere primers (5'-CCAAAACCCCAAAACCCCAA-3'). Fractions with fragments < 2 kb with taq
polymerase from Sigma (elongation time 2'30"), fractions
> 2 kb with the "expand long template PCR system" from
Roche (elongation time 4'00").

The PCR products were purified on Sephacryl-500 (Amersham), extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated. These fragments were ligated in PGEM T-easy
(Promega) and transformed in competent E. coli Electromax DH10B cells. The 1–2 kb and 2–4 kb fractions contained sufficient clones (10,000) and were used for
sequencing.
For the reconstruction of the ribosomal RNA cluster, the
band (indicated by an arrow in lanes 1, 2 and 3 of Figure
1a) was cut out of gel and the DNA from this band was
isolated with a gel extraction kit (QIAEX II DNA Gel
Extraction Kit, Qiagen). A part of this DNA was digested
with EcoR1 and cloned in a pUC-18 cloning vector. The
obtained clones were sequenced and the largest part of the
ribosomal cluster was reconstructed. With a set of specific
telomere primers in combination with internal primers
the complete ribosomal cluster was obtained.
The cDNA library was prepared from polyA-plus RNA of
Nyctotherus ovalis with the "cDNA library Construction"
kit from BD Biosciences/Clontech according prescription.
The cDNA was ligated in the vector pDNR-LIB and transformed in E. coli Electromax DH10B cells (Invitrogen).
Titer: 2.58.107. Randomly picked clones were selected for
sequencing.
5,484 ESTs (Expressed Sequence Tags) and 4,242 gDNAs
of N. ovalis were sequenced. Vectors and linkers were automatically filtered out of sequences. First the vector pieces
were detected using a BlastN search against their respective vector sequences on TimeLogic Decypher machine
http://decypher.stanford.edu using the same parameters
as VecScreen (-q -5 -G 3 -E 3 -e 700 -Y 1.75e12 -F mD).
Regions showing similarity to the vector were trimmed
from the ends of the sequences. If there was a remaining
vector in the middle, it was removed and the longer of the
two remaining fragments was kept.
Data storage and clustering
The sequences and the results of the analyses performed
were stored in a relational MySQL database. In order to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/587

minimize the redundancy of the data, we aligned the dataset to itself using SWN (Smith-Waterman comparison at
the nucleotide level). Sequence pairs having an identity ≥
97% and an overlap of at least 100 nt were considered to
be from the same gene and were put in the same cluster.
Sequences having less or no sequence similarity can be in
the same cluster as long as they are linked via other
sequences. gDNAs telomeres were trimmed prior to the
SWN comparison. However, information about these telomeres was kept associated to the sequence name in the
database.
All sequence comparisons were run on a Decypher TimeLogic using the Smith-Waterman algorithm for pairwise
sequence comparisons and Hidden Markov Models for
sequence-to-profile comparisons, active motifs included.
The output was subsequently analyzed in a Linux environment using Perl scripts.
Datasets
We started with 9,726 sequences (5,484 cDNAs and 4,242
gDNAs). From these we used specific subsets that were
more particularly designed to answer each specific biological question i.e., the best compromise between using as
much data as possible and using good quality data.

We used the following datasets:
- Initial-set: contains the clones that were initially
sequenced: 4,242 gDNAs and 5,484 cDNAs.
- Nr-set: contains the longest sequence of each cluster generated from the Initial-set: 2,841 gDNAs and 1,914
cDNAs.
- UniProt-set: contains all Nyctotherus gDNAs having
homologs with the known proteins from UniProt: 1,459
gDNAs
- UniProt-nr-set: contains Nyctotherus gDNAs from the nrset having homologs within the known proteins from
UniProt: 937 gDNAs.
- Princeton-set: contains 13 carefully sequenced fulllength Nyctotherus macronuclear chromosomes.
All sequences have been submitted to the EMBL nucleotide database. The numbers are: AM894321–AM899804
for the cDNAs, AM890408–AM894321 for the gDNAs
and AM890081–AM890407 for the set of completely
sequenced macronuclear chromosomes.
Telomere removal
From the Princeton-set (see above), we could determine
that macronuclear telomeres of N. ovalis are mostly of the
form CCC(AAAACCCC)n or (GGGGTTTT)mGGG with n

and m comprised between 1 and 6. However this set only
contains 13 molecules and we found longer telomeres
within the Initial-set. Despite the occasional presence of
more repeats in this set, the form of these telomeres
remains the same, so we identified telomeres by the following regular expression in Perl:/^GTN([CAN]CCCC)/
and eventually refined their removal by hand.
Verifying that macronuclear chromosomes contain a single
gene
To determine whether or not the N. ovalis sequences contain only one gene, we compared the 2,841 gDNA from
the nr-set against UniProt release 9.1 database, with a
SWX search and an e-value threshold of 1e-05. For all N.
ovalis gDNAs, we retrieved the boundaries of the "best hit"
to a known protein. Subsequently we examined whether,
in the hit list there were any hits that did not overlap with
the first hit. We never observed cases of such non-overlapping hits, arguing for the presence of only a single gene per
macronuclear chromosome.
Orientation of the sequences
UniProt detection
Sequences were compared against UniProt database
(SWX; e-value threshold = 1e-05). Sequences with a match
on the reverse strand were reversed and in the case of the
presence of one or the two telomeres, the upstream and/
or downstream regions were extracted. 1,459 gDNAs
could be oriented this way representing 937 different clusters/non-redundant sequences.
Purine/pyrimidine ratio
As we discovered that the coding strand had a higher
purine/pyrimidine ratio than the reverse strand, we used
this ratio to orient the sequences that could not be oriented with UniProt hit. Sequences having a purine/pyrimidine ratio < 1 were reversed.
Analysis of subtelomeric regions
The 300 first nucleotides after the telomeres 5' and the
300 nt before the telomeres 3' from the sequences of the
UniProt-set were extracted. We measured the Shannon
n

entropy (H =

1
∑ p(i) log 2( p(i) ) ), the purine skew, defined
i =1

as ((A+G)-(C+T))/((A+G)+(C+T)), the AT skew, defined
as ((A+T)-(G+C))/((A+T)+(G+C)), and the single nucleotide composition of these sequences for the 300 aligned
positions.
We searched for conserved motifs using a Gibbs sampling
program AlignACE [30], and the motif discovery tool
MEME [44] in these regions.

Intron detection
1,914 cDNAs were compared to 2,841 gDNAs of the nr-set
using GeneDetective with the default values except "filter
off" on Decypher and Exonerate [71], with the following
parameters: model = est2genome, percent = 50 and miniintron = 20 and were then validated by hand. Exonerate
only identified introns in 17 sequences, whereas GeneDetective found an additional 10 sequences with introns. To
compare nucleotide percentages in the introns with the
rest of the sequences, we used for the latter the pieces of
cDNAs matching the gDNAs. Intron boundaries were displayed using WebLogo [72]. Introns in Nyctotherus gDNAs
were predicted with Genewise [32]. First, all Nyctotherus
gDNAs were compared with Paramecium proteins for
which experimentally-derived (gDNA/cDNA comparison
based) introns were known, using SWX (Smith-Waterman
X) on a Decypher machine. Subsequently GeneWise was
run for the best hits of Nyctotherus sequences with the Paramecium proteins in the "-splice flat-intron tied" mode to
identify likely introns in the Nyctotherus sequences. From
the GeneWise results we extracted the locations of the
Nyctotherus introns in the Paramecium proteins. The latter
were then compared with the experimental locations of
the Paramecium introns to establish which ones were conserved. Introns were considered conserved when the Nyctotherus introns mapped to the same location in the
aligned Paramecium proteins as the Paramecium introns,
allowing for a maximum shift of 2 amino acids. Supporting the conservation of the 48 thus determined introns
was the observation that they had a conserved phase in all
cases except one. Experimentally-determined intron locations in Paramecium were kindly provided by Laurent
Duret and Jean-François Goût (University de Lyon).

We compared the positions of the introns of N. ovalis
against the position of the introns in their closest
homologs (BlastX e-value threshold = 1.e-05) in another
ciliate T. thermophila and a member of the Apicomplexa P.
falciparum. Ciliates and Apicomplexa are both Alveolata.
The genome of T. thermophila was recently published [3].
Tetrahymena protein and genomic sequences were
obtained from the Tetrahymena Genome Database on
http://www.ciliate.org/. We worked with Assembly2 –
Nov_2003_scaffolds and 27,769 cDNAs from 08-302006. By comparing the N. ovalis sequences to known proteins (Smith-Waterman against UniProt-Swissprot database; e-value threshold = 1e10-5), we identified homologs
of the spliceosome complex.
Motif, miRNA discovery
We used MEME [44], an expectation maximization algorithm and AlignACE [30], a Gibbs sampling program, to
discover over-represented motifs de novo. We then tested
their presence in the whole dataset using MAST [50].

We also used TRANSFAC [51], a database on eukaryotic
cis-acting regulatory DNA elements and trans-acting factors that covers the whole range from yeast to human, to
search these motifs in our set.

We detected tRNAs using tRNAscan-SE [43] with the
default parameters. The potential presence of a miRNA
was examined with the algorithm described in [73]
Genetic Code
We determined the stop codon usage by examining those
cDNAs that aligned with 1) at least 40% identity over 2)
at least 60 amino acids that 3) did not have unknown
nucleotides (N) in the alignment and 4) aligned until the
N-terminus of a known protein. For the 328 cDNAs that
fit those criteria we examined the next codon. TAA (141
cases) is preferentially used as stop codon, TAG (5 cases)
also occurs in those locations, but less than e.g. GAC (40
cases) or GCC (59) cases.

Phylogenetic trees were constructed using an alignment
provided by Muscle [74,75]. Sequences were edited and
the most relevant parts from the alignments were selected
manually using Seaview [76]. Phylogenies were subsequently derived using the program PhyML [77] using the
HKY model and an estimated number of invariable sites
with four substitution rate categories. 100 bootstraps were
performed.
