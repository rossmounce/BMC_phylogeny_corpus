Gene structure, transcripts and calciotropic
effects of the PTH family of peptides in
Xenopus and chicken
Pedro LC Pinheiro†, João CR Cardoso†, Ana S Gomes, Juan Fuentes, Deborah M Power, Adelino VM Canário*

Abstract
Background: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) belong to a family of endocrine factors
that share a highly conserved N-terminal region (amino acids 1-34) and play key roles in calcium homeostasis,
bone formation and skeletal development. Recently, PTH-like peptide (PTH-L) was identified in teleost fish raising
questions about the evolution of these proteins. Although PTH and PTHrP have been intensively studied in
mammals their function in other vertebrates is poorly documented. Amphibians and birds occupy unique
phylogenetic positions, the former at the transition of aquatic to terrestrial life and the latter at the transition to
homeothermy. Moreover, both organisms have characteristics indicative of a complex system in calcium regulation.
This study investigated PTH family evolution in vertebrates with special emphasis on Xenopus and chicken.
Results: The PTH-L gene is present throughout the vertebrates with the exception of placental mammals. Gene
structure of PTH and PTH-L seems to be conserved in vertebrates while PTHrP gene structure is divergent and has
acquired new exons and alternative promoters. Splice variants of PTHrP and PTH-L are common in Xenopus and
chicken and transcripts of the former have a widespread tissue distribution, although PTH-L is more restricted. PTH
is widely expressed in fish tissue but from Xenopus to mammals becomes largely restricted to the parathyroid
gland. The N-terminal (1-34) region of PTH, PTHrP and PTH-L in Xenopus and chicken share high sequence
conservation and the capacity to modify calcium fluxes across epithelia suggesting a conserved role in calcium
metabolism possibly via similar receptors.
Conclusions: The parathyroid hormone family contains 3 principal members, PTH, PTHrP and the recently
identified PTH-L. In teleosts there are 5 genes which encode PTHrP (2), PTH (2) and PTH-L and in tetrapods there
are 3 genes (PTHrP, PTH and PTH-L), the exception is placental mammals which have 2 genes and lack PTH-L. It is
hypothesized that genes of the PTH family appeared at approximately the same time during the vertebrate
radiation and evolved via gene duplication/deletion events. PTH-L was lost from the genome of eutherian
mammals and PTH, which has a paracrine distribution in lower vertebrates, became the product of a specific
endocrine tissue in Amphibia, the parathyroid gland. The PTHrP gene organisation diverged and became more
complex in vertebrates and retained its widespread tissue distribution which is congruent with its paracrine nature.

Background
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related peptide
(PTHrP) belong to a family of endocrine factors with a
highly conserved N-terminal region (amino acids 1-34),
which accounts for their overlapping functions in calcium homeostasis [1-3]. In mammals, single copy PTH

and PTHrP genes are proposed to share common ancestry [1,3,4] an idea reinforced by the identification of
duplicate orthologous genes, PTH1 and 2, and PTHrP1
and 2 in teleost fishes [5-7] which underwent a specific
genome duplication [8]. However, the recent identification of a novel PTH-like (PTH-L) gene in teleosts
throws into question previous evolutionary models for
this gene family [5].
In mammals, PTH is a product of the parathyroid
glands and pre-pro-PTH is processed to liberate the

biologically active mature 84 amino acid hormone,
which regulates serum calcium through its direct
actions in bone and kidney counteracting the action of
calcitonin [1,9]. In contrast, PTHrP is a pluripotent
hormone which acts via intracellular, paracrine and
endocrine pathways and regulates cell growth and differentiation, bone development and lactation, and
embryonic and fetal development and survival [10-13].
Tissue specific proteolytic processing of PTHrP occurs
and generates at least three active fragments [4,11,14],
of which only the N-terminal (1-36) fragment has a
cognate family 2 G-protein coupled receptor, PTH1R,
which also binds PTH [15]. Moreover, alternative promoter utilization and exon splicing generates several
different human PTHrP isoforms which range in
length from 139-173 amino acids [4,16]. In mammals,
a second receptor (PTH2R) is activated by PTH and
tuberoinfundibular peptide 39 (TIP39), while in teleost
fish PTH2R is only activated by TIP39 [17,18]. Moreover, in teleosts a paralogue of tetrapod PTH1R (designated PTH3R) with affinity for PTHrP also exists
[19-23].
PTH and PTHrP have been intensively studied in
mammals but their function in other vertebrates is
poorly documented. In amphibians, PTH/PTHrP receptors have been characterized and an immunoreactive
PTHrP-like peptide with widespread tissue distribution
has been detected [24,25]. In chicken, PTH and PTHrP
homologues have also been isolated and are involved in
chondroblast and osteoblast differentiation, although
their role in calcium transport mechanisms is poorly
understood [26-31]. Amphibians and birds occupy
unique phylogenetic positions, the former at the transition of aquatic to terrestrial life, the latter at the transition to homeothermy, and both organisms have a
complex system in calcium regulation. The presence of
a parathyroid gland in frogs (not present in fish)
coupled with their terrestrial/aquatic environment and
the occurrence in birds of a hollow skeleton and heavily
calcified eggs are examples of physiological/structural
processes which influence calcium and phosphorus
requirements.
The identification of new PTH family members in
Xenopus sp. (Amphibia) and chicken, Gallus gallus
(Aves) by in silico analysis of public databases and
gene cloning is reported. Gene structure, gene linkage,
alternative splicing and tissue specific transcription
are also characterised. The calciotropic activity of
Xenopus and chicken N-terminal (1-34) peptides of
PTH family members in vitro are established using
Xenopus skin and chicken chorionallantois membranes. Finally a model of PTH gene family evolution
is proposed and discussed in the context of functional
divergence.

Results
Xenopus and chicken PTH family members

Homologues of vertebrate PTH, PTHrP and Takifugu
rubripes PTH-L genes were identified or deduced
in silico using the Xenopus and chicken genomes (Additional file 1) and validated by cDNA cloning and
sequencing (Additional files 2, 3 and 4). The Xenopus
and chicken PTH-family members shared at least 30%
amino acid sequence similarity to the Takifugu mature
proteins and 58% to the (1-34) N-terminal amino acid
residues. Sequence comparison of Xenopus and chicken
PTH-family members with other vertebrate homologues
revealed that specific sequence motifs are conserved
(Figure 1 and Additional files 2, 3 and 4). For example,
the cleavage sites located before the mature protein in
human pre-pro-PTH and PTHrP were conserved. Characteristic proteolytic sites within the human PTHrP protein, which generate three distinct peptides were also
conserved: N-terminal PTHrP(1-36), mid-region PTHrP
(38-94) and C-terminal PTHrP (107-139) [12] (Additional files 2 and 3). The first 10 N-terminal amino

acids, involved in the calcitrophic action of the hormones is the most highly conserved domain. Specific
motifs such as, M-H-N in PTH, and L-H-D in tetrapod
PTHrP and the amino acids important in receptor-binding in mammals, L 24 and L 28 are also conserved.
Additional conserved residues in Xenopus and chicken
PTH-family members are V2, Q6, H9 and R20 (Figure 1),
suggesting they are important in peptide function from
fish to mammals.
Gene structure and transcript isoforms

Comparison of gene structure indicates that amphibian
and chicken PTH and PTH-L gene organization is conserved and that the peptide precursors are encoded by
two separate exons (E1 and E2) (Figure 2). In contrast,
the gene structure of PTHrP from Xenopus and chicken
is poorly conserved and 3 exons code for the mature
protein. Alternative splicing generates two distinct

Page 3 of 14

transcripts that differ in their 3’ region and modify the
predicted amino acid sequence of the C-terminal
domain (Additional file 4).
Transcripts - PTH

The Xenopus PTH gene was deduced in silico and
revealed that exon 1 encodes the pre-pro-region of the
protein and exon 2 the mature protein (Figure 2). Xenopus PTH cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR from the
intestine (accession number FM955441) and the predicted protein has 118 amino acids and yields a mature
protein of 87 amino acids. It was not possible to establish the nucleotide sequence of the 5’ and 3’ UTR of
Xenopus PTH. The gene structure of chicken PTH was
identical to the amphibian homologue but no evidence
of alternative splicing was found (Figure 2). Chicken
PTH has 119 amino acids and is identical to the previously described cDNA [NM_205452, [32,33]]. Two
ESTs were identified (CV890868 and CV041147) from
cDNA of a mixture of chicken tissues (whole brain, ultimobranchial gland, parathyroid gland, cecum, tonsil,
and primordial germ cells) and were identical to fulllength PTH (accession numbers NM_205452 and
M36522).
Transcripts - PTHrP

members. Exons are represented by boxes and lines indicate introns.
Coding (E1 to E4) and non-coding (E1’ to E’3) exons are numbered
and annotated in bold and italics, respectively. Dotted-filled boxes
represent the mature coding regions and black lines box the signal
peptide sequence. Arrows represent alternative splice isoforms
identified in Xenopus and chicken and previously reported in human.
The general organization of the conserved vertebrate PTH gene
structure is represented and the size of vertebrate PTHrP and PTH-L
precursors is given (amino acids). The length of the chicken PTH-L
precursor was predicted in silico and is indicated in italics. Dashed
lines indicate incomplete structures that were not confirmed in silico
or amplified by RT-PCR. The start of the mature peptide (+1) and the
size of the signal peptide for all vertebrate PTH family members is
indicated. The localization of the human PTHrP promoter regions (P1,
P2 and P3) and the chicken PTHrP putative promoter sites (P1’, P2’
and P3’) and TATA box consensus sequence within the region of P3’
are shown. The figure is not drawn to scale and Takifugu A structure
was taken from Power et al. [42].

The deduced Xenopus PTHrP gene is composed of at
least 10 exons (Figure 2). The first putative exon contains the pre-pro-peptide and part of the 5’UTR,
although the full gene structure in this region remains
to be elucidated. Exon 2 encodes the mature protein
and part of the 3’UTR and yields Xenopus PTHrP(1131) (XenPTHrP). The largest XenPTHrP transcript
identified has 144 amino acids and results from intraexon splicing of exon 2 to exon 3 as occurs in the
homologue region (osteostatin) in the human PTHrP
gene. Through alternative splicing, exon 3 donates 32
amino acids to the predicted protein and at least seven
downstream exons generate a unique 3’UTR domain.
Xenopus PTHrP encodes the largest 3’UTR region identified for this gene in vertebrates.
Two previously published mRNA (NM_205338 and
AB175678) [34,35] encode XenPTHrP 1-139 and 1-141
which share an identical amino acid sequence with the
exception of two extra arginine (R) residues in the latter
isoform contributed by exon (E3) (Figure 2). Two ESTs
identified in the tailbud (stage 28-30) (accession numbers CR437266; CR433007) encode a predicted
XenPTHrP of 180 amino acids which yields a mature
protein of 144 amino acids [XenPTHrP(1-144)]. A second XenPTHrP isoform encoding a protein of 167
amino acids which generates a mature peptide of 131
amino acids [XenPTHrP(1-131)] was predicted from
analysis of genomic sequences. The existence of
XenPTHrP(1-131) transcript was confirmed by RT-PCR
of bone (accession number FM955442).

The deduced chicken PTHrP gene is composed of at
least 6 exons (Figure 2 and Additional file 5). The first
three exons undergo alternative splicing and contain
part of the 5’UTR (Additional file 5). Exon 4 encodes
the remaining 5’UTR and part of the pre-pro-protein.
The mature protein and part of the 3’UTR of chicken
PTHrP(1-139) are included in exon 5. In common with
human an intra-exon splice of exon 5 to 6 give rise to
chicken PTHrP(1-141). This final exon encodes for the
last 3 amino acids of PTHrP(1-141) and the 3’UTR.
Several chicken PTHrP (ckPTHrP) isoforms which differed in the 5’ UTR and coding region were identified
amongst isolated ESTs (Additional file 1). Five ESTs
(BU252785,
BU384898,
BM489067,
ENSGALESTT00000030972 and BU252877) differing in their
5’UTR region, encoded a ckPTHrP of 141 amino
acids (Additional file 5). No ESTs for putative ckPTHrP
(1-139) were identified in database searches although
RT-PCR revealed it is expressed in several tissues (Additional file 6).
Transcripts - PTH-L

The gene structure of Xenopus PTH-L has only been
partly elucidated and was composed of at least two
exons and appears to have an identical gene structure to
PTH. The deduced protein sequence of PTH-L (accession number FM955443) is 152 amino acids (Figure 2).
Two main transcripts for Xenopus PTH-L (XenPTH-L)
were identified by clustering seven XenPTH-L ESTs
(Additional file 1). One transcript (XenPTH-L5utrE1’)
was represented by three ESTs from gastrula stages 10.512 (AL964863) and a mixture of brain and spinal cord
from tadpoles stages 58-64 (CN076481; CN076482). The
second transcript (XenPTH-L5utrE2’) was represented by
four ESTs from gastrula stages 10.5-12 (AL775245;
AL965929; BX750398; BX764109). The deduced
XenPTH-L was 118 amino acids long and yielded a
mature protein of 86 amino acids (Figure 2 and Additional file 2).
The chicken PTH-L gene had a similar structure to
the PTH gene and was composed of two exons and one
intron. No ESTs for ckPTH-L were identified although
RT-PCR indicated it is expressed in several tissues
(Additional file 6).
Phylogenetic analysis

The topologies of phylogenetic trees constructed with
Neighbor Joining or parsimony methods were similar
and a consensus tree is presented (Figure 3). PTH,
PTHrP and PTH-L were separated into different clades
and the Xenopus and chicken PTH-like family members
clustered with their respective vertebrate homologues
(Figure 3). In teleosts, a specific duplication of the PTH
and PTHrP genes occurred although only one PTH-L
exists and this may be a consequence of; 1) deletion of

the second copy from teleost genomes or 2) a partial
duplication of teleost PTH-like members. The isolation
of homologues of Takifugu PTH-L gene in amphibian
and chicken genomes suggests that members of the
PTH/PTHrP family emerged prior to the teleost divergence and were subsequently maintained in vertebrate
genomes. The exception is eutherian mammals which
lack a PTH-L gene.
Short-range gene environment comparisons

To better understand the evolution of vertebrate PTH
family members, the gene environment of the Xenopus
and chicken genes were characterized and compared
with the homologue regions in Takifugu and human.
Short-range comparisons indicate that gene synteny and
gene order were maintained across vertebrates suggesting that members of this family evolved under conservative pressures (Figure 4). The chicken and human
homologue genome segments were the most highly conserved and similar linked genes were identified flanking
PTH-family members. The genes ARNTL and BTBD10
were localized in close proximity to PTH. Genes

Figure 4 Short-range gene linkage comparisons of the PTH
family members in the Takifugu, Xenopus, chicken and human
genomes. Genes are represented by closed boxes and the size of
the chromosome region analysed is given underneath. Genes were
named using HUGO and lines indicate chromosome/scaffold
segments. The vertebrate PTH family members are in bold and
conserved flanking genes identified within the homologue regions
are underlined. The PTH gene is localized in Xenopus scaffold_235
and in chicken chromosome 5 and two conserved genes ARNTL
and BTBD10 were identified. The Xenopus and chicken PTHrP maps
to scaffold_766 and chromosome 1, respectively and the gene
MRPS35 was found in close proximity in all vertebrate regions
analysed. PTH-L and SFRS3 genes map to Xenopus scaffold_169 and
to chicken chromosome 26. SFRS3 was not linked to Takifugu PTH-L
and is present on human chromosome 6 which lacks PTH-L. For
simplicity, only genes with correspondence across species are
represented. The figure is not drawn to scale.

MRPS35 and SFRS3 were identified within the PTHrP
and PTH-L homologue regions, respectively. The genes
flanking PTH-L in Xenopus and chicken were identified
on human chromosome 6, although PTH-L was lacking
suggesting that specific gene/genome rearrangement
events occurred during the mammalian radiation.
PTH family genes expression

The tissue distribution and relative abundance of all
Xenopus and chicken PTH family transcripts was investigated by RT-PCR (Additional file 6) and q-PCR (Figure

Page 5 of 14

5). PTH and PTHrP transcripts had a similar tissue distribution in both Xenopus and chicken.
PTH-L had a widespread tissue distribution in Xenopus and the highest transcript abundance (copy number
relative to 18S) was detected in brain, lung and bone
(Figure 5). Xenopus PTHrP transcripts were detected in
brain, lung, skin and heart and were low abundance in
spleen and muscle (Figure 5). It was not possible to
design q-PCR primers which discriminated between the
two Xenopus PTHrP transcripts. However, RT-PCR
(Additional file 6) revealed both transcripts have a similar distribution. Xenopus PTH was expressed in bone,
kidney, lung and nervous tissue (mixed brain and pituitary). The presence of PTH family members was not
established in the amphibian parathyroid gland as its
small size and variable morphology made it difficult to
collect [36].
In chicken, PTH transcripts were highly abundant in
the parathyroid gland (Figure 5), although they were
also detected at low abundance in the pituitary, thyroid,
bone and cartilage. Chicken PTHrP transcripts were
widely expressed (Figure 5) and the various isoforms
had a differential tissue distribution suggesting they may
have different functional roles. ckPTHrP(1-141)5utrB
and ckPTHrP(1-141)5utrC were the most abundant
transcripts (copy number relative to 18S) and were
mainly found in cartilage. ckPTHrP(1-141)5utrB,
ckPTHrP(1-141)5utrC and ckPTHrP(1-141)5utrD transcripts had a similar tissue distribution. The tissue distribution of ckPTHrP(1-139) overlapped with ckPTHrP
(1-141)5utrA with the exception of cartilage in which
the latter transcript was absent. ckPTHrP(1-139) was
highly expressed in muscle and was the only isoform
which was not detected in the parathyroid gland. It was
also absent from bone together with ckPTHrP(1-141)
5utrA. In contrast, both isoforms were expressed in kidney where ckPTHrP(1-141)5utrB and PTHrP(1-141)
5utrC were not detected. ckPTH-L transcripts had a
similar tissue distribution to ckPTHrP (Figure 5) and
were most abundant in cartilage but were also present
in pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid glands, muscle, hind
brain and kidney.
Transepithelial calcium transport

The resistance and short-circuit current of Xenopus
abdominal skin and chicken CAM membranes were
substantially different (Table 1). CAM is a leaky
epithelium and the frog skin is a tight epithelium and
both have calcium transporting capacity. All Xenopus
and chicken (1-34) N-terminal peptides were able to
increase unidirectional calcium fluxes from the apical/
basolateral membrane site (Figure 6). XenPTH(1-34)
changed calcium fluxes across Xenopus abdominal skin
from 2.6 nmol.h-1.cm2 to 6.1 nmol.h-1.cm2, XenPTHrP

(Isc) was observed after 50 and 60 minutes of exposure
of Xenopus abdominal skin to XenPTHrP(1-34) and
XenPTH-L(1-34), respectively which suggests these
peptides may also be involved in the transport of other
ions in the skin (Table 1). This possibility was tested
by comparing theoretical and measured short-circuit
current using the formula Isc = Ji.z.F (where Ji,

represents the uptake, z the calcium valence and F is
the Faraday constant) [37]. For PTHrP the calculated
value for Isc (in μ/cm 2 ) was 0.84 vs. the measured
value 0.32. For PTH-L the calculated value for Isc was
0.41 vs. the measured value 0.24. The values of Isc for
the two peptides are within the same range. The difference between calculated and measured values of Isc is
indicative of an additional transport mechanism
responsive to both peptides, e.g. secretion of anions
(likely chloride).

Discussion
In the current study, three PTH family members, PTH,
PTHrP and PRH-L, were characterized in Xenopus and
chicken. Preliminary functional analysis suggests the
action on calcium uptake of the (1-34) N-terminal
region is conserved in PTH family members. Comparison of sequence, structure and gene environment suggests they have evolved by gene duplication and deletion
events. Moreover, a number of novel PTHrP splice variants with a variable 5’UTR were also identified. All
three PTH family members are present in teleost and
tetrapod genomes with the exception of eutherian mammals which have lost the PTH-L gene, probably because
of specific gene or genome rearrangements during the
mammalian radiation. This hypothesis is supported by
the conservation in human chromosome 6 of genes
linked to PTH-L in fish, Xenopus and chicken. Phylogenetic analysis supports previous theories that PTH-like
family members evolved from a common ancestral precursor, from which tuberoinfundibular peptide 39
(TIP39) has also been suggested to have arisen [38]. To
date, PTH family homologues remain to be identified in
invertebrates and their emergence in vertebrates coupled
with their important role in calcium homeostasis and
skeletal development suggest that their origin may be
associated with the acquisition of a calcified
endoskeleton.
Analysis of PTH family members in Xenopus and
chicken indicates that similar post-translation modifications to those previously described for the human
homologue occur [9,16]. The bioactive N-terminal

Pinheiro et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:373
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/373

(1-34) peptide of PTH family members is the most conserved region of the protein (Figure 1). The physicochemical properties of amino acids in the N-terminal
region including L24 and L 28 which are important for
receptor activation [39,40], are maintained in Xenopus
and chicken suggesting they may have similar functional
roles across the vertebrates. Moreover, within this
region the highest conservation is found in the first residues. Previous studies comparing activation of teleost
and human PTHR by PTHrP and PTH suggests they
have distinct activation profiles and indicate the C-terminal region of the protein is also involved [20,23,41].
In addition to amino acid sequence conservation, the
gene organization of Xenopus and chicken PTH and
PTH-L is also maintained (Figure 2) [14,42]. However,
although PTH-L splice isoforms have been found in
Xenopus and Takifugu [5] no alternative PTH splice isoforms have been identified in any species to date. In
contrast, the gene structure of PTHrP is poorly conserved between vertebrates and unique Xenopus and
chicken isoforms which result from exon skipping
events, were identified and resemble those reported for
the human gene [12]. In human, three PTHrP transcripts are expressed as a result of alternative promoter
usage, two of which (139 and 141 deduced amino acids)
are identical in size to those present in chicken. The
only difference between the mature proteins in both
human and chicken is the presence in the 1-141 PTHrP
isoform of two extra C-terminal amino acids (Additional
file 4). In Xenopus a unique PTHrP splice isoform
results from a splice event within the osteostatin region
and the incorporation of a novel coding sequence and
3’UTR giving rise to a longer peptide precursor (144
amino acids). In contrast, to terrestrial vertebrates
including Xenopus where splice variants of PTH family
members are common, none were identified in teleosts.
Variation in the UTR has been associated with tissuespecific [43], developmental stage or cell state specific
[44] regulatory mechanisms. The existence of splice variants suggests that complex regulatory mechanisms for
this gene family were acquired within the tetrapod
radiation and this may be related to the change in
mineral homeostasis which accompanied the adaptation
of vertebrates to a terrestrial environment [3,14,45].
The presence of distinct Xenopus and chicken PTHrP
isoforms and their widespread distribution and expression in bone, cartilage, skin and kidney (classical tissues
involved in calcium regulation) further supports their
role as important calciotropic factors. The PTHrP transcripts identified in chicken are predicted to produce
mature proteins with the same length as the human
PTHrP(1-139) and PTHrP(1-141) proteins, although no
homologue of the human PTHrP(1-173) was identified
suggesting it may be a human innovation. The Xenopus

Page 8 of 14

and chicken PTHrP and PTH-L tissue expression overlaps in the majority of the tissues analysed suggesting
widespread paracrine actions for the two proteins.
PTH distribution is more restricted and in chicken, as
expected, is expressed abundantly and almost exclusively
in the parathyroid gland (Figure 5). In Xenopus, we were
not able to identify the parathyroid tissue and it has previously been noted to be inconspicuous and readily
degenerates [36,46]. In chicken PTH expression was also
detected in the pituitary gland and in Xenopus brain/
pituitary extracts, which is in agreement with studies
which showed that immunoactive protein was detected
in pituitaries from sheep [47], and fish [3,48] (which
lack an organized parathyroid gland structure). PTH
immunoreactivity in brain and pituitary was also
reported for several tetrapods, including chicken [49],
but so far has only been confirmed in rabbit and rat
brain/pituitary. Taken together these results suggest a
high degree of conservation of pituitary PTH expression
and possibly secretion across vertebrates, although in
mouse the thymus is also a source of PTH [50]. PTH
expression in Xenopus lung has not, to our knowledge,
been previously reported. However, the overall PTH tissue distribution largely coincides with the two PTH/
PTHrP receptors identified in this organism [25]. This
supports the hypothesis that PTH may have a more
paracrine action in lower vertebrates.
Although there was an overlapping tissue distribution
of some of the transcripts of the three PTH family
members, expression of PTH and PTH-L, unlike
PTHrP, is more restricted (Figure 5). The PTHrP isoforms identified in chicken seem to conform to specific
patterns and levels of abundance, although only one of
the transcripts produces a different protein. With the
exception of chicken PTHrP(1-141)5utrA, the other
chicken PTHrP are expressed in cartilage at high levels
confirming their important role in this tissue [51]. However, in Xenopus PTHrP transcript seemed to be absent
from cartilage. The different tissue expression profiles of
PTH family members in Xenopus and chicken (and
Takifugu [5]) suggest that specific modulation of gene
expression occurs and detailed analysis of the promoter
region may help clarify this question.
All Xenopus and chicken PTH-like peptides were
found to promote unidirectional calcium influx
(Figure 6). The differing effect of human PTH(1-34) in
chicken and Xenopus is in keeping with what has been
previously observed for the bovine peptide [52,53]. However, after pre-treatment with Vitamin D, bovine PTH
(1-34) is also able to stimulate calcium transport across
the Rana pipiens skin epithelium [52]. Xenopus PTH-L
and chicken PTH peptides were the most effective in
promoting calcium transport across the membranes in
each specific assay. Similar results were obtained for

Pinheiro et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:373
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/373

transport across teleost larvae epithelia [5] and although
more studies are required to establish their specific
function, the results provide new insight into the interlink between evolution and function of the PTH family.
Although the three peptides enhance calcium transport, only PTHrP and PTH-L caused changes in the
short-circuit current in Xenopus skin, indicating an
additional effect on transport of ions other than calcium
(Table 1). Similar effects on the short-circuit current in
the same range of PTH concentrations have previously
been observed with A6 cells derived from Xenopus kidney [54]; on sodium transport of PT cells derived from
chicken kidney [55]; and with PTHrP on fish intestine
[56]. Our results further substantiate the effect of the
PTH family of proteins on the short-circuit current and
suggest that the action of the different peptides on the
short-circuit current is tissue dependent and may vary
with species.
While PTHrP and PTH genes have been identified in
teleosts and tetrapods, PTH-L seems to be absent from
eutherian mammals and it was recently suggested to
be the functional homologue of mammalian PTH, in
fish [5]. In the present study, Xenopus PTH-L in common with teleost PTH-L, was the most potent peptide
promoting calcium transport across epithelia. In
chicken, a different scenario was observed and PTH
seemed to be more efficient in stimulating calcium
transport. Taking into consideration a) the reduced
calciotropic activity of PTH-L in chicken, b) the overlapping distribution between PTH-L and PTHrP and c)
the absence of a PTH-L in the human genome (data
not shown), it is proposed that a transitory functional
role between the vertebrate PTH-L and the tetrapod
PTHrP and PTH occurred after the amphibian divergence. The tetrapod PTH-L probably acquired a minor
role and became potentially non-functional and was
consequently eliminated from the human genome. In
contrast, PTH which in teleosts and Xenopus appears
to be a paracrine factor seems to have gained a more
important functional role during evolution and became
a major endocrine factor with a restricted production
in a highly specialized structure, the parathyroid gland
[34]. Future studies using more in depth functional
studies and other organisms will be needed to support
this hypothesis.

Conclusions
The parathyroid hormone family contains 3 principal
members, PTH, PTHrP and the recently identified
PTH-L. In teleosts there are 5 genes which encode
PTHrP (2), PTH (2) and PTH-L and in tetrapods there
are 3 genes (PTHrP, PTH and PTH-L), the exception is
placental mammals which have 2 genes and lack a
PTH-L. Gene structure of PTH and PTH-L seems to be

Page 9 of 14

conserved throughout the vertebrates while PTHrP gene
structure is divergent and it has acquired new exons
and alternative promoters. The highly conserved Xenopus and chicken N-terminal (1-34) region of PTH,
PTHrP and PTH-L has the capacity to stimulate calcium
uptake across, respectively, the frog skin and chicken
chorionallantois membranes, indicating a conserved role
in calcium metabolism possibly via similar receptors. It
is hypothesized that PTH family genes appeared at
approximately the same time during the vertebrate
radiation and evolved via gene duplication/deletion
events. During evolution PTH-L was lost from the genome of eutherian mammals, while PTH, which has a
paracrine distribution in lower vertebrates, became the
product of a specific endocrine tissue, the parathyroid
gland and gained an important role in calcium regulation. The PTHrP gene acquired during its evolution a
disparate and more complex organization in vertebrates
probably associated with its paracrine nature and pluripotent functions.

Methods
Animals and tissue collection

Adult Xenopus laevis were purchased from Xenopus
Express (France) and maintained at 22°C. Adult chickens (Gallus gallus) were supplied by a local farm. Frogs
and chickens were anesthetized with diethyl ether
(Merck) and euthanized by double pithing and decapitation, respectively. Fertile white leghorn chicken eggs
were obtained from Quinta da Freiria (Serpa, Portugal)
and kept in humid conditions in an automatic incubator
(Brinseca OCTAGON 40) at 37.5°C with gentle rotation.
Tissues were collected, immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80°C.
All animal experiments were performed in accordance
with Portuguese legislation under a “Group-1” licence
from the Direcção-Geral de Veterinária, Ministério da
Agricultura, do Desenvolvimento Rural e das Pescas,
Portugal.
In silico identification and validation of PTH-like
transcripts

Putative PTH-like genes were identified in the amphibian (Xenopus tropicalis) and chicken (Gallus gallus)
genome and EST databases by sequence similarity
searches using human PTH (AAH96144.1) and PTHrP
(AAA60221) and Takifugu rubripes PTHA
(CAG26460.1), PTHB (CAG26461.1), PTHrPA
(CAB94712.1), PTHrPB (CAG26459.2) and PTH-L
(CAG26462.1) and the default settings of tBLASTn
[57]. Amphibian and chicken genomes were accessed
via Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org), Xenbase
(http://www.xenbase.org) and NCBI (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/), respectively. EST sequences were

Pinheiro et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:373
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/373

retrieved from NCBI and BBSRC ChickEST databases
(http://www.chick.manchester.ac.uk/). Isoforms of
Xenopus and chicken transcripts were named according to the size of the deduced mature protein and the
length of their 5’UTR region (A to D). Puffer fish
(Takifugu rubripes) and human (Homo sapiens) genome assemblies available in Ensembl and the human
dbEST NCBI database were also interrogated with
Xenopus and chicken PTH family members to identify
potential novel isoforms.
Validation of transcripts was done by specific PCR
amplifications using Xenopus and chicken cDNAs as
template, the primers listed in Table 2 and the number
of thermocycles and annealing temperatures adjusted
for each amplicon. Xenopus reactions were cycled 40
times with annealing temperatures of 59°C for PTH,
55°C for PTHrPA, 58°C for PTHrPB and 57°C for
PTH-L. For chicken the annealing temperatures and
cycles were, respectively, 53°C and 30 for PTH, 55°C
and 35 for PTHrPA, 58°C and 35 for PTHrPB and
55°C and 40 for PTH-L. All PCR products were analysed on 1.5% agarose gel and sequenced to confirm
their identity.

RNA extractions and quantitative gene expression

Total RNA (tRNA) extracted from adult frog and
chicken tissues using Tri Reagent (Sigma Aldrich, Spain)
was treated with 1 U DNase (DNA-free Kit, Ambion,
UK) for 30 min at 37°C. DNase treated tRNA (500 ng)
was denatured at 65°C for 5 min, quenched on ice for
5 min and used for cDNA synthesis in a 20 μl reaction
volume containing 10 ng of pd(N)6 random hexamers
(GE Healthcare, UK), 2 mM dNTPs, 100 U of MMLVRT and 20 U RNasin® Plus RNase inhibitor. cDNA was
synthesized for 10 min at 20°C followed by 50 min at
42°C and 72°C for 5 min.
Quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR) amplifications of
Xenopus and chicken cDNAs used the primers listed in
Table 2 designed with Primer Premier and Beacon
Design software (Premier Biosoft Int., Palo Alto, CA).
Triplicate reactions (20 μl final volume) containing 1 μl
of template cDNA and 1 pmol of each primer were prepared and reactions repeated twice using Power SYBR
Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA) and a Bio-Rad iClycler iQ thermocycler
system (software version 3.1.7050, Bio-rad, Life Science
Group, USA). The thermocycle consisted of an initial

step at 95°C for 10 min followed by 55 cycles of 95°C
for 30 sec, 20 sec at an appropriate temperature for
annealing of each primer pair, and 72°C for 30 sec.
Annealing temperatures were 60°C for r18S; 56°C, 59°C
and 53°C for the Xenopus PTH, PTHrP and PTH-L,
respectively; and for the chicken amplicons 53°C for
PTHrP(1-141)5utrB; 55°C for PTHrP(1-139); 57°C for
PTH, PTH-L and PTHrP(1-141)5utrC; 58°C for PTHrP
(1-141)5utrD; and 60°C for PTHrP(1-141)5utrA. Melting
curves were performed to detect nonspecific products
and primer dimers. PCR products were quantified relative to a standard curve constructed using serial dilutions of linearized DNA plasmid of the target transcript.
Genomic contamination was monitored by including
tRNA samples without MMLV-RT and r18S was used
as the internal quantitative control for normalization.
Relative gene expression was calculated as: number of
copies (NC) = (A × 6.022 × 1023)/(B × 1 × 109 × 650
kDa), where A is the template quantity (ng of vector
plus insert), B the template length (bp vector plus
insert), and 650 kDa is the average weight of a base pair
according to [58].
Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis

Multiple sequence alignments of PTH family preproand mature proteins were performed with ClustalX
using the following parameters: Gonnet series matrix,
Gap opening penalty 10, Gap extension 0.2 [59]. Alignments were displayed in GeneDoc (http://www.psc.edu/
biomed/genedoc), manually edited and percentages of
sequence identity and similarity calculated. Phylogenetic
analysis was performed using both Neighbor Joining and
Maximum Parsimony Methods [60] with 1000 and 100
bootstrap replicates, respectively, using MEGA 3.1 software [61].
Gene organization and linkage analysis

The gene organization of the Xenopus and chicken
PTH-like members was deduced using Spidey software (mRNA-to-genomic alignment; http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Ostell/Spidey) with the aid
of Ensembl in silico gene annotation and the predicted structures were manually edited using intron/
exon splice boundary consensus sequences (AG/GT)
and by comparison with available EST data. The
immediate gene environment of the PTH, PTHrP
and PTH-L genes in Xenopus was assessed from
scaffold annotation in Ensembl and the chicken
homologue regions using Mapview (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/mapview). To verify if conservation of
the PTH-L genome region in amphibian and chicken
genomes also exists in human and puffer fish, a
search for homologues of neighbouring genes was
performed.

Electrophysiological measurements and unidirectional
calcium fluxes

Previous studies established that PTH promotes calcium
transport across the frog skin [52] and chicken chorionallantois membranes (CAMs) [27] thus providing
assays to test the activity of the new PTH family peptides. The effect of Xenopus and chicken PTH(1-34),
PTHrP(1-34) and PTH-L(1-34) (Genemed Synthesis,
Inc., San Antonio, Texas, USA) on calcium transport
was assessed in vitro using Ussing chambers with adult
Xenopus abdominal skin and CAMs from chicken
embryos of 16 to 18 days [stages 42 HH and 44 HH,
respectively; [62]]. Human PTH (1-34) (Bachem, Germany) and salmon Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH, Bachem) were used as positive and
negative controls, respectively.
The Xenopus experiments were carried out at 22-23°C
in Ringers solution (2.4 mM NaHCO3; 113.8 mM NaCl;
1.9 mM KC 2 H 3 O 2 ; 1 mM CaCl 2 ; 2.1 mM NaC 2 H 3 O 2 ;
0.5 mM Mg(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2 and 5 mM glucose) at pH 8.1
with oxygenation provided by atmospheric air. The
chicken experiments were carried out at 37°C using a
standard bathing solution [130 mM NaCl; 1 mM
MgSO4; 2 mM CaCl2; 8 mM KH2PO4; 15 mM glucose
[63]] at pH 7.4 maintained by gassing with a mixture of
5% CO2 in O2.
The Xenopus and chicken membranes were pinned
over the circular aperture of Ussing chambers (1 cm2)
and 8 ml of saline solution was added to each halfchamber. Epithelial preparations were stabilized for 30
min and the saline solution was replaced before the
addition of radioactive labelled 45 Ca 2+ (0.75 μCi/ml
CaCl2; GE Healthcare, UK) to the mucosa/chorion side.
Time zero was established 15 min after 45Ca2+ addition.
Fluid samples (400 μl) were collected every 30 minutes
over a total of two hours from the serosa/allantoic side
and the first 2 samples served as controls prior to peptide (10 nM) addition. The volume sampled was
replaced by an equal amount of saline and replicate
200 μl samples of the mucosa/chorion side were used to
calculate calcium specific activity by counting in a liquid
scintillation counter (Beckamn LS 6000IC, USA). All
radiotracer experiments were performed under short
circuit conditions.
Bio-electrical variables were recorded with a DVC1000 voltage-clamp amplifier (WPI, Sarasota, US) by
means of Ag-AgCl electrodes connected to the chamber
by agar bridges (2 M KCl/3% agar) and data was collected via a Data-Trax acquisition system (WPI, Sarasota, US) connected to a personal computer (PC). At
the start of experiments the trans-epithelial potential
(Vt, mV) was recorded to check tissue integrity and
then short circuited (Vt = 0) for subsequent experiments. Short circuit current (Isc, μAmp/cm 2 ) was

Pinheiro et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:373

constantly recorded and the current deflections produced by 3 mV pulses once every minute were used for
calculation of tissue resistance (Rt, Ω.cm2) using Ohm’s
law.
Calcium fluxes were calculated using the equation:

paired Student’s t-test was used to test the effect of peptide on calcium fluxes and one-way ANOVA was used
to test the effect of peptide on electrophysiological
measurements (Isc e Rt) using SigmaStat v.3.11 (Systat
software, Inc., USA). The significance level was 5%.

(10), hindgut (11), midgut (12), liver (13), brain (14), lung (15), heart (16),
gonads (17) and thyroid (18 and 19). In (B) the adult chicken tissues
analyzed were forebrain (1), midbrain (2), hindbrain (3), pituitary (4),
parathyroid (5), thyroid (6), bone (7), cartilage (8), muscle (9), kidney (10),
liver (11), lung (12), eggs (13), duodenum (14), hindgut (15) and midgut
(16). C (-) represents the negative control reaction. The ribosomal unit 18S
was used as an internal control to normalize RT-PCR reactions and
amplified products were sequenced to confirm identity.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Xenopus and chicken parathyroid family gene and
transcript dataAccession numbers (GenBank and Ensembl IDs) of
nucleotide sequences, gene scaffolds and tissue of origin of EST of the
vertebrate PTH family members.
Additional file 2: Multiple sequence alignment of vertebrate PTH
family members. The signal peptide (SP) is indicated by a double arrow
and the 1-34 mature peptide is boxed. Potential proteolytic cleavage
sites are in bold and italics and the Pre and Pro sites are indicated. The
M-H-N amino acid motif is indicated in bold. Amino acid conservation is
denoted by “*” and accession number of the sequences used are
indicated in Figure 1.
Additional file 3: PTHrP amino acid multiple sequence alignment.
Description: The signal peptide (SP) is indicated by a double arrow and
the three potential peptides (1-34PTHrP, mid-region and osteostatin)
generated from the human precursor are indicated within boxes. The
alignment includes various human, chicken and Xenopus PTHrP isoforms
which are annotated according to the length of the mature protein
sequence. Potential cleavage sites are in italics and bold and the Pre and
Pro cleavage sites are indicated by arrows. The tetrapod L-H-D and the
teleost M-H-D motifs are annotated in bold. The two lamprey PTH-like
sequences were not included in the alignment since only the mature
peptide region was characterized. Amino acid conservation is denoted
by “*” and accession numbers of the sequences used are described in
Figure 1.
Additional file 4: PTH-L amino acid multiple sequence alignment.
The signal peptide (SP) is indicated by a double arrow and the potential
mature PTH-L peptide is within a box. The potential M-H-D motif
previously identified in the Takifugu precursor is in bold and potential
proteolytic cleavage sites within the signal peptide sequence are in bold
and italics. Sequences underlined and in italics have been predicted in
silico but were not confirmed by RT-PCR. Amino acid conservation is
denoted by “*” and accession numbers are indicated in Figure 1.
Additional file 5: Chicken PTHrP alternative transcripts. The five
PTHrP transcripts that result from alternative exon skipping events are
mapped against the structure of the chicken PTHrP gene and their
respective EST accession number and size (bp) indicated. The novel
chicken transcripts were named according to the size of the deduced
mature peptide (139 or 141) precursor and the length of their 5’UTR
region (A to D). Arrows delimit regions amplified by q-PCR for each
transcript and the deduced mature peptide sequence of each transcript
is given and +1 indicates the start of the mature peptide. Coding exons
are represented by filled boxes, non-coding exons by open boxes and
introns by lines and the dotted-filled boxes indicate the mature PTHrP
peptide region. Non-coding 5’UTR exons are designated by E1’ to E3’
and the predicted intron sizes (bp) of the chicken PTHrP gene are given.
