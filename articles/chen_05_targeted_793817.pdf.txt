Abstract
Background: In the last few years, microsatellites have become the most popular molecular marker system and
have intensively been applied in genome mapping, biodiversity and phylogeny studies of livestock. Compared to
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) as another popular marker system, microsatellites reveal obvious
advantages. They are multi-allelic, possibly more polymorphic and cheaper to genotype. Calculations showed that
a multi-allelic marker system always has more power to detect Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) than does a di-allelic
marker system [1]. Traditional isolation methods using partial genomic libraries are time-consuming and costintensive. In order to directly generate microsatellites from large-insert libraries a sequencing approach with
repeat-containing oligonucleotides is introduced.
Results: Seventeen porcine microsatellite markers were isolated from eleven PAC clones by targeted
oligonucleotide-mediated microsatellite identification (TOMMI), an improved efficient and rapid flanking
sequence-based approach for the isolation of STS-markers. With the application of TOMMI, an average of 1.55
(CA/GT) microsatellites per PAC clone was identified. The number of alleles, allele size distribution,
polymorphism information content (PIC), average heterozygosity (HT), and effective allele number (NE) for the
STS-markers were calculated using a sampling of 336 unrelated animals representing fifteen pig breeds (nine
European and six Chinese breeds). Sixteen of the microsatellite markers proved to be polymorphic (2 to 22
alleles) in this heterogeneous sampling. Most of the publicly available (porcine) microsatellite amplicons range
from approximately 80 bp to 200 bp. Here, we attempted to utilize as much sequence information as possible to
develop STS-markers with larger amplicons. Indeed, fourteen of the seventeen STS-marker amplicons have
minimal allele sizes of at least 200 bp. Thus, most of the generated STS-markers can easily be integrated into
multilocus assays covering a broader separation spectrum. Linkage mapping results of the markers indicate their
potential immediate use in QTL studies to further dissect trait associated chromosomal regions.
Conclusion: The sequencing strategy described in this study provides a targeted, inexpensive and fast method
to develop microsatellites from large-insert libraries. It is well suited to generate polymorphic markers for
selected chromosomal regions, contigs of overlapping clones and yields sufficient high quality sequence data to
develop amplicons greater than 250 bases.

Background
Almost all of the applied protocols to isolate microsatellites de novo include construction of partial genomic
libraries (selected for small insert size) followed by cumbersome screening steps with hybridization probes [2].
Here, we introduce an improved approach called TOMMI
(Targeted Oligonucleotide-Mediated Microsatellite Identification) to develop microsatellites by straightforward
sequencing of clones isolated from large-insert libraries
like PAC (P1-derived Artificial Chromosome) and BAC
(Bacterial Artificial Chromosome) with repeat-containing
oligonucleotides. The need to specifically identify and isolate STS-markers from these types of libraries is unquestionable. First, large-insert libraries are predominantly
used in animal genetics, e.g. [3,4], as tools to identify candidate genes or to generate overlapping contigs of chromosomal regions that are associated with quantitative or
economic trait loci (QTL or ETL). Secondly, the overall
number of microsatellites present in a genome depends
mainly on their complexity and size. Assuming a total size
of 3 × 109 bp and an estimated frequency of a dinucleotide
repeat every 30–50 kb in mammals (as reviewed by [5]),
a genome-wide figure of 100,000 microsatellite markers
of that kind can be assumed [6]. However, only approximately 1,200 porcine microsatellites have been reported
so far [7]. Furthermore, both the total number and the distribution of the loci are still not sufficient to have well-distributed microsatellite coverage throughout the genome
or for several chromosomes, e.g. SSC18 [8]. The objective
of the present study was the selective generation of micro-

satellites from PAC-clones, which were prior to STS development isolated from the porcine PAC library TAIGP714
[3] by a three-dimensional PCR screening strategy [9].
Eight of the eleven clones harbored functional or positional candidate genes involved in health, reproduction,
production, and regulation, whereas the other three
clones have been used in the attempt to construct a PAC
contig covering SSC16q11-13 (Table 1).

Results and discussion
Fifteen of the seventeen microsatellites (Table 2) were
developed with sequencing primers containing one selective nucleotide at the 3'-end: (CA)8T (S0701, S0703, and
S0767), (CA)8A (S0702, S0704, and S0710), (CA)8G
(S0705, S0706, S0712, and S0766), (AC)8C (S0709),
(AC)8G (S0707 and S0715), (AC)8T (S0708 and S0711).
Characterization of microsatellites S0713 and S0714 was
only accomplished by an improved discrimination of the
PAC clone sequences with sequencing primers further
extended at the 3'-end with a second nucleotide [(CA)8AT
for S0713 and (CA)8GC for S0714]. The second nucleotide became necessary because the respective clones
TAIGP714L02061Q (for S0713) and TAIGP714I23038Q
(for S0714) contained additional (CA)8A or (CA)8G
primer binding regions or motifs. Contrary, a further
extension with three nucleotides at the 3'-ends of the
primers did not result in additional microsatellites in any
of the PAC clones or was not required. Therefore, we conclude that repeat primers with two 3'-nucleotides next to
the repeat motif are sufficient to detect and sequence all

repeats potentially present on a large-insert library clone.
The results of our isolation strategy also indicate that two
sequencing reactions (the reverse sequencing primer was
designed based on the obtained sequences) seem to be
sufficient in most cases to gain sequence information of
high quality to amplify microsatellites (Table 2). Usage of
sequencing primers degenerated at the 3'-end proved,
however, to be inadequate as no sequence information at
all was achieved. Also, to avoid overlapping primary
sequences, oligonucleotides that basically extend the
dinucleotide repeat at the 3'-end – such as (CA)8C and
(AC)8A – are not recommended. TOMMI proved to be an
efficient and reliable isolation strategy. Besides new STSmarkers, six previously described microsatellites were also
detected. Three of these loci, microsatellites S0111 [10],
SW742 [11], and SW813 [12], were initially used as
probes for the isolation of clones TAIGP714L02061Q,
TAIGP714I23038Q, and TAIGP714F10061Q. The other
three already described microsatellite sequences reside on
TAIGP714C09004Q [GenBank: AJ440949 (repeat location: 3172–3231) and GenBank: AJ440950 (repeat location: 15831–15860 and 16007–16038)]. They were not
further considered in this study as they were not regarded
as novel. Independently of our effort, two other groups
[13,14] introduced similar sequencing approaches to generate microsatellites from large-insert libraries. There are,
however, several differences between our approach and
the ones of the other groups in terms of sequence generation and selective amplification of microsatellites. Here,
contrary to Waldbieser and colleagues [14] – who used tri-

nucleotide repeat containing primers for sequencing –
both gene-specific primers are not 5'-tailed with extra
nucleotide stretches to enable either product labeling or
to promote alleged non-template adenylation. FujishimaKanaya's group [13] used larger repeat compounds contributing to the primer [(CA/GT)(10) instead of (CA/
GT)(8)]. Secondly, the sequencing primers consisted generally of three selective nucleotides at the 3'-end adjacent
to the repeat motif (e.g. CNA/GVG). There, the first of the
three terminal nucleotides was always identical with the
starting nucleotide of the dinucleotide repeat primer used.
In addition, primers contained a degenerated base according to the International Union of Biochemistry (IUB)
codes at the second position from or directly at the 3'-end.
Thirdly, determination of the double-stranded primary
DNA sequence stretch was achieved by four sequencing
reactions using both a CA-repeat containing primer plus a
GT-repeat containing primer heading in the opposite
direction and two reverse primers were developed based
on the obtained sequence. Finally, they always designed
an additional primer pair for the specific amplification of
the microsatellite. In contrast, we used the single reverse
sequencing primer in combination with a newly developed sequence specific primer (S0766 and S0767) or
designed a new primer pair to amplify the microsatellite
(S0701 to S0715).
The observed number of alleles per locus (monomorphic
locus S0709 is not included in this calculation) in the heterogeneous sampling was as low as 2 (S0702) and as high

as 22 (S0713), leading to an average number of 9.94 alleles, NE ranged from 1.05 to 11.54 and both HT and PIC
from 0.05 to 0.91 (Table 3).
Due to their isolation from partial genomic libraries
selected for small insert sizes most of the publicly available porcine microsatellites lie within DNA-fragments of
about 80 to 200 bp. Their potential combination in multiplex assays – also considering different annealing temperatures and technical limitations of the automated
sequencers (limited number of available fluorescent dyes)
– is therefore hampered. Hence, an enhanced number of
genotypes per run can only be achieved by the integration
of STS-markers covering a larger allelic spectrum. Thus, we
intended and focused on the development of large amplicons for microsatellites by utilizing as much sequence
information as possible for primer design. Indeed, fourteen STS-markers had allele sizes of at least 200 bp and for
five of the isolated microsatellites, sequence information
proved to be good enough to amplify allele sizes of at least
300 bp (Table 3).
By the guided isolation of STS-markers S0709 to S0715
from three SSC16q derived PAC clones (relative position
0 cM to 9.3 cM [7]; 2.33 STS-markers per clone), the
marker density in this chromosomal region was improved
remarkably. An average of 1.55 new microsatellites was
isolated from PAC clones harboring functional candidate
genes (S0701-S0708; S0766 and S0767). Considering all
used PAC clones and developed STS-markers, 1.55 microsatellites per clone were isolated. As the PAC clones had
an average length of 80 kb (as shown by pulsed-field-gel
electrophoresis) the frequency of dinucleotide repeats
every (30 to) 50 kb [5] was more or less confirmed.
TOMMI holds therefore the potential to identify existing
STS-markers linked/adjacent to e.g. candidate genes on
large-insert library clones. Thus, in combination with a
genome scan, respective putative candidate genes could
either be transformed to or excluded as positional candidate genes prior to their complete structural characterization including SNP detection. Linkage mapping results for

S0701, S0705, S0707, S0711, S0712, S0713, S0715, and
S0766 are presented in Table 4. A comparison of their
mapping positions with QTL positions (Pig Quantitative
Trait Loci (QTL) database [15] reveal that S0705 (64.22
cM), S0707 (43.19 cM), and S0766 (102.50 cM) reside on
the respective chromosomes exactly at QTL locations
(S0705: backfat between the last 3th and 4th rib; S0707:
early growth rate and water holding capacity; S0766: backfat thickness at first rib and intra-muscular fat). The other
STS-markers are located in QTL spans of ± 5 cM. This indicates their immediate potential to further dissect these
respective QTL regions.

Conclusion
The sequencing strategy described in this study provides a
targeted, inexpensive and fast method to develop microsatellites from large-insert libraries. It is also well suited to
generate polymorphic markers for selected chromosomal
regions and contigs of overlapping clones and yielded sufficient high quality sequence data to develop marker
amplicons greater than 250 bases.

preparations were done according to the manufacturer's
protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The physical assignment of the PAC clones was performed by Fluorescence in
situ Hybridization (FISH) as described in [16] or alternatively by analysis of the INRA-UMN porcine radiation
hybrid (IMpRH) panel [17]. Microsatellite primers (Table
3) were used to RH map S0703, S0704 and S0708 –
S0715. Marker assignment of S0701, S0702, S0705 –
S0707, S0766 and S0767 was performed with primers
from further sequence segments of the PAC clones.

lyzer (ABI, Weiterstadt, Germany). Sequencing reactions
were done using the BigDye™ Terminator (v 3.0) Cycle
Sequencing Kit (ABI, Weiterstadt, Germany). DNA
sequencing was performed using 10 pmol of the respective oligonucleotide, 1 µl BigDye Premix and 50–100 ng
of purified plasmid DNA as template in a total volume of
10 µl. Sequencing conditions were 96°C for 30 s followed
by 30 cycles of 96°C for 10 s, the respective annealing
temperature for 5 s and 60°C for 4 min. The optimal
annealing temperature for the repeat containing primer
was between 50°C and 52°C, except for the generation of
sequences for S0714, which were at 56°C. To generate
STS-markers, oligonucleotides containing repeat motifs
(CA)8 respectively (AC)8 at the 5'-end and few (one or
two) non-repetitive bases at the 3'-end were originally
used as sequencing primers. Based on the obtained
sequence, specific primers were developed and used as

reverse oligonucleotides to determine the composition of
the repeat region and its 5'-flanking region (Table 2; Figure 1). BLAST comparison followed sequence determination to verify the novelty and uniqueness of the obtained
sequences. Depending on the quality of the sequenced
stretch, primers were developed to amplify seventeen STSmarkers (S0701 to S0715; S0766 and S0767; Table 3). To
confirm the sequence identity of the respective microsatellites [GenBank: AY253989 to AY254003, AY731063,
and AY731064] on genomic DNA, the resulting PCR
products were subcloned into the polylinker of the
pGEM®-T vector (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and
three independent clones each were bi-directionally
sequenced using standard sequencing primers SP6 (5'ATT TAG GTG ACA CTA TAG AA-3') and T7 (5'-TAA TAC
GAC TCA CTA TAG GG-3').

Evaluation of microsatellites and size determination of
alleles were done with appropriate ABI-softwares GENESCAN (3.7) and GENOTYPER (3.6) using GENESCAN™500ROX™ as internal size standard. Oligonucleotides
were designed with the Oligo Selection Program [18] and
synthesized by MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). To
characterize size range, number of alleles, polymorphism
information content (PIC), average heterozygosity (HT)
and effective allele number (NE) of the microsatellites,
STS-markers were separately amplified. PCR assays were
performed at 54°C for S0706, S0708, S0712, S0713,
S0714, and S0767, at 56°C for S0701, S0702, S0703,
S0705, S0707 and S0715, and at 58°C for S0704, S0709,
S0710, S0711, and S0766 in a RoboCycler Gradient 96®
(Stratagene, LaJolla, USA) using PURE Taq Ready-To-Go
PCR Beads® (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany),
along with the respective oligonucleotides (one labeled at
the 5'-end alternatively with fluorescent dyes FAM, JOE or
NED) and 50 ng of genomic porcine DNA in a volume of
12.5 µl (the concentration of each dNTP is 100 µM in 10
mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0 at room temperature), 50 mM KCl
and 1.5 mM MgCl2). In total, 336 unrelated pigs representing nine European breeds (9 Angeln Saddleback, 18
Bunte Bentheimer, 9 German Edelschwein, 15 German
Landrace, 30 Hampshire, 27 Göttingen Minipig, 31 Pietrain, 12 Swabian-Haellian Swine, and 7 European Wild
Boar), and six Chinese breeds (30 Chinese Jiangquhai, 28
Chinese Luchuan, 30 Chinese Minpig, 30 Chinese
Rongchang, 30 Chinese Tibetan, and 30 Chinese Yushanhei) were investigated. The standard PCR profile was as
follows: pre-denaturation at 92°C for 2 min, followed by
35 cycles of 92°C for 30 s, the optimal annealing temperature for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s. The final cycle had an
extension at 72°C for 10 min. PIC, HT and NE were estimated based on algorithms as introduced by Botstein and
colleagues [19], Nei [20], and Kimura and Crow [21].

of each marker. Genotypic data were evaluated with
CHROMPIC and corrections made if necessary. The final
position reported is based on the current MARC swine
linkage map. Amplification primers for the eight successfully mapped markers are presented in Table 4.

Linkage mapping of STS-markers on the USDA-MARC
linkage map
Seven families of the MARC Swine Reference Population
were genotyped as described [22]. Amplified DNA was
radioactively labeled, separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized with autoradiography. To ensure accurate sizing and discrimination of
alleles, amplification primers were redesigned to yield
smaller products for all markers except S0706, S0707 and
S0709. S0767 was not tested in this population. Four
markers were not informative in the MARC Swine Reference Population (S0702, S0706, S0709 and S0714) and
four primer sets failed to produce reliable products
(S0703, S0704, S0708 and S0710). Genotypes were determined and entered into the MARC Genome Database.
Each marker was initially assigned to a chromosome
based on TWOPOINT results of CRIMAP [23], then
multipoint linkage analyses determined the final location
