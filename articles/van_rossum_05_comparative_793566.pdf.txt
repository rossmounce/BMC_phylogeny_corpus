Abstract
Background: In human carcinomas, overexpression of cortactin correlates with poor prognosis.
Cortactin is an F-actin-binding protein involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell migration
by promoting actin-related protein (Arp)2/3 mediated actin polymerization. It shares a high amino
acid sequence and structural similarity to hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein 1 (HS1)
although their functions differ considerable. In this manuscript we describe the genomic
organization of these two genes in a variety of species by a combination of cloning and database
searches. Based on our analysis, we predict the genesis of the actin-binding repeat domain during
evolution.
Results: Cortactin homologues exist in sponges, worms, shrimps, insects, urochordates, fishes,
amphibians, birds and mammalians, whereas HS1 exists in vertebrates only, suggesting that both
genes have been derived from an ancestor cortactin gene by duplication. In agreement with this,
comparative genome analysis revealed very similar exon-intron structures and sequence
homologies, especially over the regions that encode the characteristic highly conserved F-actinbinding repeat domain. Cortactin splice variants affecting this F-actin-binding domain were
identified not only in mammalians, but also in amphibians, fishes and birds. In mammalians, cortactin
is ubiquitously expressed except in hematopoietic cells, whereas HS1 is mainly expressed in
hematopoietic cells. In accordance with their distinct tissue specificity, the putative promoter
region of cortactin is different from HS1.
Conclusions: Comparative analysis of the genomic organization and amino acid sequences of
cortactin and HS1 provides inside into their origin and evolution. Our analysis shows that both
genes originated from a gene duplication event and subsequently HS1 lost two repeats, whereas
cortactin gained one repeat. Our analysis genetically underscores the significance of the F-actin
binding domain in cytoskeletal remodeling, which is of importance for the major role of HS1 in
apoptosis and for cortactin in cell migration.

Background
Cortactin (also designated EMS1 , CTTN, cttn, Amplaxin,
see Genecard [1]) was initially identified as one of the
most prominent tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in vSrc infected chicken embryo fibroblasts [2]. Cortactin was
independently isolated from mouse NIH3T3 cells [3] and
human tumor cell lines [4]. Human cortactin is encoded
by the EMS1 gene, which is located on chromosome
11q13 [4,5]. Gene amplification of 11q13 region and
concomitant overexpression of cortactin frequently occurs
in several human carcinomas [4,6-8] and correlates with
lymph node metastasis and increased mortality [9-11].
Elevated expression of cortactin increases cell motility,
invasion [12-14] and metastasis [15].
The deduced amino acid sequence of cortactin revealed
three main distinguishable domains: the N-terminal
acidic domain containing a DDW-Arp2/3 binding motif
followed by a six and one-half 37-amino acid F-actin
binding repeat domain, a central region and an SH3
domain at the very C-terminal. The DDW-Arp2/3 binding
site and the actin-binding domain together regulate Factin polymerization and dynamics by activating the
Arp2/3 complex [16] and both are necessary for translocation of cortactin to sites of actin polymerization [17].
Recently, we reported the identification of two alternative
splice variants of human cortactin lacking either 6th or the
5th /6th repeat, present in normal tissues as well as squamous cell carcinomas cell lines [14]. These splice variants
differ significantly in their ability to (i) bind F-actin, (ii)
cross-link F-actin (iii) activate Arp2/3 mediated actin
polymerization and (iv) induce cell migration in vitro
[14]. This indicates that also the number of repeats determines the affinity for F-actin and ability to regulate cell
migration. Similar cortactin splice variants were also
reported in the mouse [18], rat [19] and frog [20]. The
SH3 domain is a conserved protein module found in various signal proteins and mediates the interaction with various proteins such as N-WASP involved in actin
polymerization, dynamin-2 in endocytosis, ZO-1 in cellcell interactions and SHANK-2 in neuronal growth cones
(reviewed in [21]). The central part of the protein between
the F-actin repeat domain and the SH3 domain contains
an alpha-helix sequence and a proline-rich region with
three c-Src tyrosine phosphorylation sites [22,23] and
three serine/threonine phosphorylation sites [24]. Cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation occurs in response to growth
factor treatment, integrin cross-linking, bacterial invasion
and cell shrinkage (reviewed in [21]). Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin reduces its F-actin cross-linking activity and is required for its ability to stimulate cell migration
[13]. Since cortactin operates mainly in cytoskeletal rearrangements, it may link other proteins via its SH3 domain
to sites of actin polymerization. Alternatively, serine phosphorylation of cortactin by Erk enhances, whereas Src

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/15

phosphorylation inhibits the activation of N-WASP by
cortactin [25] and as a result affects actin polymerization.
This suggests that cortactin at first instance may be
directed to the site of actin polymerization by other proteins. Thus, changes in protein expression level, phosphorylation state, the relative expression of splice variants and
interactions with other proteins can all influence cell
migration.
Cortactin shows the highest similarity to the hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein 1 (HS1). Human HS1
(also designated HCLS1 , see Genecard [26]) was originally isolated by its homology to the adenovirus E1A gene
[27]. HS1 overall similarity to cortactin at the amino acid
level is 51% but is highest at the SH3 domain (86%) and
the 37-amino-acids repeat domain (86%), except that
HS1 carries only three and one-half repeats. Despite this
high homology, the function of HS1 differs considerable
from cortactin. First, HS1 is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells [27], whereas cortactin is widely expressed
in all cell types except most hematopoietic cells [28]. Only
in platelets and in megakaryocytes both genes are
expressed [29,30]. Second, in concordance with this tissue
distribution, HS1 is tyrosine phosphorylated after receptor cross-linking in B-cells [31], T-cells [32], mast cells
[33] and erythroid cells [34], but at different residues
compared to the functional phosphorylation residues in
cortactin [13,23]. Third, HS1 is, like cortactin, a cytoplasmic protein, but after tyrosine phosphorylation HS1
translocates to the nucleus [35], whereas cortactin is never
found in the nucleus. This is because HS1, but not cortactin, contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) [36,37].
Fourth, HS1 plays an important role in the receptor-mediated apoptosis and proliferative responses as demonstrated by the analysis of HS1 deficient mice [38] and
WEH1-231 B lymphoma cells [37,39]. An HS1 tyrosine
mutant that could not translocate to the nucleus, also
failed to induce apoptosis [37]. Consistent with its role in
apoptosis, HS1 is able to bind to the mitochondrial protein HAX-1, a Bcl2 like protein [40]. Finally, the SH3
domain of HS1 at the C-terminus binds to other proteins
(Ste20 related kinase HPK1 [41] and HS1-BP3 [42]) than
those binding to cortactin, despite the very high amino
acid sequence similarity of both SH3 domains (86%).
This most probably reflects the different tissue-specific
expression pattern.
Cortactin and HS1 share also remarkable similarities.
First, HS1 binds with its DDW-motif directly to Arp2/3
and is involved in Arp2/3 mediated actin polymerization
in vitro , although less efficient than cortactin [43]. Second, HS1 binds to F-actin with its 37-amino-acid repeat
domain [36], however, it contains only three and one-half
repeat in contrast to cortactin. Third, also HS1-splice variants have been detected such as a variant lacking the 3rd

HS1 is sequentially phosphorylated on three tyrosine residues by various Src family tyrosine kinases [31,45] and
two serine/threonine residues [30], although at different
residues than cortactin [25]. Finally, both cortactin and
HS1 can accumulate into podosomes, structures found in
osteoclasts [46] and marcrophages [47], but also in RSV
transformed cells [48] and carcinoma cells [49].
Although cortactin and HS1 share a high amino acid
sequence and structural similarity, their functions differ
considerable. In this paper, we compare their genomic
organization in order to provide more insight into their
evolution, which may form the basis towards understanding specific functions of both genes. We describe the
genomic organization and the exon-intron boundaries for
human cortactin. Both the genomic cDNA and deduced
amino acid sequences of human cortactin were compared
to cortactin and HS1 genes from other species. Genomic
comparisons revealed the evolution and underscore the
significance of the conserved F-actin binding repeat

domain for HS1 and cortactin and the importance of
alternative splicing for cortactin function.

Results and discussion
The genomic organization of cortactin homologues
We have previously described the isolation and sequencing of the EMS1 cDNA [28,49] (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank
Accession No. M98343) coding for the human cortactin
protein. To evaluate the genomic structure, we determined
the exon/intron-boundaries. Nucleotide sequence comparisons with human EMS1 cDNA sequence revealed
homology with two human genomic clones (DDBJ/
EMBL/GenBank Accession No. AP000487 and
AP000405) (Table 1). The genomic structure of the EMS1/
cortactin gene was determined by performing BLASTn
comparisons of EMS1 cDNA against the genomic clones
(Figure 1A). By amplifying the intron sequences (smaller
than 2 Kb) using primers on adjacent exons followed by
end-sequencing of these products, we confirmed the
intron/exon boundaries of the human EMS1/cortactin
gene. The EMS1 gene contains 18 exons spanning over
about 38 Kb of genomic DNA. The length of the individual exons ranges from 55 to 178 bp, except the last exon

(1564 bp). The splice donor and acceptor sequences, the
sizes of the introns and exons of the human EMS1/ cortactin gene are provided in the supplementary materials
[see Additional file 1]. The ATG is at position 169, at the
first nucleotide of exon 3, indicating that the first two
exons encode the 5' untranslated region (UTR). The Factin-binding repeat domain is encoded by exon 5 to exon
12 with 5 exons of 111 nucleotides in length (exons 6, 8,
9, 10 and 11) (Figure 1A and [see Additional file 1]). The
sequence encoding the DDW Arp2/3 binding site is
located within exon 3 and the SH3 domain is encoded by
exon 17 and 18. The 3' UTR is 1420 nucleotides in length
with a polyadenylation signal AATAAA at position 3225.
Other cortactin homologues have been reported in mouse
[3], rat [19], chicken [50], fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster
) [51], and frog (Xenopus laevis ) [20]. We searched in
numerous databases for all known cortactin genes in
other species (listed in Table 1). The identification is
based on overall amino acid sequence and overall structural homology with human cortactin. Cortactin homologues exist in mammalians (human, chimpanzee, cattle,
pig, mouse, rat), birds (chicken), amphibians (frog),
fishes (zebrafish, pufferfish), urochordates (sea squirt),
invertebrates (sea urchin), insects (fruit fly, mosquito),
shrimps, worms and sponges. To date, there is no
evidence for the existence of cortactin in unicellular species, nor in plants. Thus, cortactin seems to be restricted to
metazoans.
For several species, both cDNA and genomic sequences
(total or partial) are available and therefore we were able
to reveal their genomic organization using BLASTn. The
exon/intron-boundaries were determined and compared
to human cortactin [see Additional file 1]. As schematically presented in Figure 1, the genomic organization and
the lengths of the exons as well as the locations of the
exon/intron boundaries are highly conserved from urochordates to mammalians. Pufferfishes have the shortest
known genome of all vertebrate species due to much
shorter introns, nevertheless most exon/intron boundaries were conserved and similar to mammalian cortactin.
Intriguingly, the number of repeats in the actin-binding
domain differs between species (Figure 1A–G). The
number of exons and the location of the intron/exon borders of insect cortactin (Drosophila and mosquito) differ
considerably with mammalian cortactin, despite the proteins sequences are very similar. Drosophila and mosquito
carry 4 repeats in the actin-binding domain. In both species, repeat 1-to-3 and 4 are on separate exons with in
mosquito the 4th repeat of the actin binding domain to be
encoded by a single 111 bp large exon 2 (Figure 1F,G).
Both, sponge (the lowest metazoan) and sea squirt (urochordate) cortactin protein carry 5 repeats. During evolution, after creation of sponges and worms, the coelomata

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/15

divided into insects and urochordates (that evolved later
into vertebrates). The genomic organization of ancestors
of the coelomata should reveal the roots of cortactin evolution. However, complete cDNA and/or genomic DNA of
cortactin homologues in these species are not yet
available.
The genomic organization HS1 homologues
Both nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons
with cortactin revealed the highest similarity with the
hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein 1 (HS1). So
far, HS1 homologues have been reported in human [27],
mouse [33], rat and chimpanzee (NCBI database), suggesting that HS1 exists in mammalians only. We determined the intron/exon boundaries of mammalian HS1
genes by aligning the cDNA with the genomic DNA using
BLASTn (Figure 1H and [see Additional file 2]). The
number and lengths of the exons and the locations of the
exon/intron boundaries were very similar to cortactin,
especially in the exons that encode the actin-binding
domain (compare [see Additional file 1] and [see Additional file 2]). The exons 10–13 of HS1 encoding the centre region between the actin-binding domain and the SH3
domain are longer (633 bp versus 489bp in cortactin) and
more divergent compared to corresponding exons of
cortactin.

In addition to a single cortactin homologue in all other
species, nucleotide sequences comparisons using the
mammalian HS1 mRNA and genomic DNA sequences
revealed (incomplete) genomic sequences in chicken,
pufferfish, zebrafish and frog (Table 1 and Figure 1I–M)
that were more related to the HS1 protein (Figure 3 and
[see Additional file 3]). Because no HS1 homologues for
these species were present in the mRNA/dbEST database
(except for X. laevis HS1), the cDNA (and corresponding
protein) sequences were deduced from the genomic DNA
with BLASTn or were predicted by Ensemble program. In
these lower species, two cortactin related proteins exist. To
distinguish between cortactin and HS1 variants, only the
most conserved N-terminal part of cortactin and HS1 protein variants, including repeat 3 (corresponding to amino
acid 1–190 of human cortactin) was used in BLASTp analysis. In each species, one protein variant turned out to be
more homologous to human cortactin, and was called
cortactin, whereas the other protein variant appeared to
be more related to HS1 and was called HS1. This analysis
unveiled HS1 proteins with more than 3 repeats in
chicken and pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis (containing 4
1/2 repeats), pufferfish Takifugi rubripes and Xenopus laevis
HS1 (5 1/2 repeats) and zebrafish HS1 (6 1/2 repeats)
(Figure 1 I-M).
Moreover, alignments of the exon/intron boundaries of
these HS1 genes to the mammalian HS1 genes [see Addi-

different colors. A lack of boxes means that the boundaries were not found. The genomic organization of some species could
not be fully elucidated, because cDNA/genomic sequences were not completely available. The actin binding repeat domain of
the cortactin protein is represented by red boxes and the SH3 domain by the purple box. The vertical green stripe indicates
the sequence coding for the Arp2/3 binding domain. Pro = proline rich region. The y in the proline rich region represents tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Hs, human; Pt, chimpanzee; Mm, mouse; Rn, rat.

tional file 2] revealed that exon 7 (repeat 3) of HS1 was
most similar to exon 10 (repeat 5) of cortactin suggesting
that in mammalians exon 8 and 9 (repeat 3 and 4) of HS1
were lost during evolution. This is supported by the presence of at least one sequence of 111 nucleotides in the
5670 bp intron 6 of human HS1 (location 3271–3381)
that is predicted by the program HMMER when performing alignments using a consensus sequence of the 37
amino acid repeats. However, this sequence is not functional because it does not represent an exon based on the
consensus sequence of exon-intron junctions ('gt ... ag'
rule of intron sequences) and no human transcripts or
ESTs of HS1 including this sequence are present in the
NCBI databases. In summary, HS1 is not restricted to
mammalians only, but exist also in fishes, amphibians
and birds and its genomic structure is very similar to that
of cortactin.
Different promoter regions explain distinct tissue
specificity of cortactin and HS1
Cortactin is widely expressed in most cell types suggesting
to be important for vital functions, while HS1 expression
is restricted to hematopoietic cells suggesting to be tailored later in evolution to serve a specific function in these
cells. In concordance with their tissue-specific expression
pattern, we suppose that their expression might be differently regulated. Therefore, we compared the upstream
promoter regions of several cortactin and HS1 genes (Figure 2). The mammalian cortactin gene is very GC rich and
contains putative SP-1 transcriptional factor binding sites
that are common to many TATA-less promoters and typical for promoter regions in 'widely-expressed housekeeping genes'. Ets family transcription factors, found in the
HS1 promoters, are specific for hematopoietic cells and
involved in controlling the expression of many B cell- and
macrophage-specific genes [52] and are critical for development of lymphoid and myeloid cell lineages. The promoter region of Drosophila and mosquito cortactin shares
putative transcription factors found both in mammalian
cortactin and HS1. Thus at least in mammalians, the
nature of the promoters seemed to determine the broad
distribution of cortactin expression in various tissues
except most hematopoietic cells and the limited expression of HS1 to hematopoetic cells.
The significance of the actin binding repeat domain in
cortactin and HS1
We recently reported the identification of two alternative
splice variants of human cortactin; SV1-cortactin lacking
the 6th repeat and SV2 lacking the 5th and 6th repeat resulting in a different F-actin binding properties and decreased
cell migration [14]. As shown in Table 1, cortactin splice
variants exist in other mammalians as well as in chicken
and frog. So far, splice variants in other species have not
been identified, suggesting that alternative splicing of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/15

cortactin seems to be restricted to higher metazoans. All
intron sequences of cortactin bordering the splice site
junctions follow the general GT/AG rule [53] except for
intron 11 (GC/AG) [see Additional file 1]. As has been
shown for other genes, a GT-to-GC transition might be
responsible for the generation of an alternatively mRNA
transcript [54]. However, in frog (Xenopus laevis ), the SV1cortactin variant exists despite the splice donor of intron
11 begins with a GT [20]. Thus, concerning the genome of
these different species, alternative splicing of the actinbinding domain of cortactin seems to be facilitated during
evolution by modulating the splicing machinery by a GTto-GC transition to create cortactin related variants that
influences cellular properties [14]. The relative expression
of cortactin splice variants by tissue origin [14] suggested
that splice variants might have tissue-specific functions
such as fine-tuning the organization of the F-actin
cytoskeleton and consequently regulating cell adhesion
and migration.
Alternative splicing also occurs in human HS1. Recently a
splice variant lacking the 3rd repeat (exon 7) has been
found in an SLE patient [44], resulting in enhanced BCRmediated cell death. This alternative splicing event was
due to a germ line mutation. In contrast, the splice donor
of HS1 intron 6 begins with a GC [see Additional file 2].
With respect to the similarities between cortactin and
HS1, it might be of interest to investigate the occurrence
of splicing of HS1 exon 6 and possible biological consequences. The 3rd repeat and its NLS links HS1 to a role in
apoptosis, while such a role has not been described for
cortactin lacking a NLS. Since the cytoskeleton architecture in hematopoietic lineage cells is very different from
that in adherent cells, it is likely that HS1 plays an important role in the construction of tissue-type specific actin
networks. Other types of actin cytoskeleton factors, such
as the Arp2/3 complex activators of the WASP family have
been reported to have distinct tissue specific expression
profiles as well. Thus, the apparent role of HS1 in apoptosis is likely due to its actin remodeling related function.
Additionally, our genomic comparisons revealed that the
3rd repeat of HS1 corresponds with the 5th repeat of cortactin, and therefore it might be of interest to investigate
whether cortactin SV2 variant (lacking the 5th and 6th
repeat) might be involved in apoptosis.
The 4th repeat of cortactin has been suggested to be
required for F-actin-binding [17]. Genomic comparisons
revealed that HS1 lacks this 4th repeat. Nonetheless, HS1
does bind to F-actin and activate the Arp2/3 complex,
although at a lower efficiency than cortactin [43]. This
suggests that not only a single repeat but the number of
repeats is crucial for the F-actin-binding affinity [14,18].
In addition, HS1 contains a PIP2 binding site in each of its
3 repeats, whereas cortactin has only one in the 4th repeat.

PIP2 reduces F-actin cross-linking by cortactin, probably
due to competition for the same binding site. Due to its
higher affinity for PIP2 [36], HS1 restores this cortactin/Factin cross-linking process by trapping PIP2. This might be
of importance in platelets and megakaryocytes where
both, cortactin and HS1 are expressed. Taken together, the
composition of the repeat domain is also involved in
diverting the functions of both genes.

An elegant way to study the function of a protein is to perform loss-of-function experiments. So far, cortactin
knock-out models have not yet been generated successfully, because deletion of one allele of cortactin leads to
premature differentiation of embryonic stem cells (personal communication in [55]). However, complete lossof-function mutants of the Drosophila cortactin gene were
viable and fertile, except impaired border cell migration
during oogenesis [56]. Down-regulation of cortactin by

RNA interference, revealed an essential role for cortactin
in dendritic spine morphogenesis [57] and in E-cadherin
mediated contact formation in epithelial cells [58]. Mice
lacking HS1, showed normal development of the lymphoid system [38], however, the antigen-receptor induced
clonal expansion and deletion of B and T lymphocytes
were impaired. Thus, loss of function studies underscores
the divergent functions of HS1 and cortactin in different
cell systems.
Cortactin and HS1 are derived from an ancestral
vertebrate cortactin-gene by gene duplication
To examine the genesis of the cortactin family, we studied
the relationship between the cortactin and HS1 homologues by generating a phylogenetic tree based on a multisequence alignment with the ClustalW 1,83 program [see
Additional file 3]. We compared the N-terminal regions
including repeat 3 (corresponding to nucleotide 1 to 190
of human cortactin), because this is the best-conserved
region among all homologues (Figure 3). One cluster contains all known HS1 proteins and appeared to be closest
related to a cluster composed by insects (Mosquito (Ag),
Drosophila (Dm)), urochordate (sea urchin, (Sp)) and
sponge (Sd) cortactin. In this last cluster all the species
with only one gene (with the highest similarity with cortactin) are present. This suggests that with the appearance
of the vertebrates, an ancestral gene became duplicated to
create two genes, which later evolved into cortactin and
HS1. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that many
genes duplicated at this stage in the evolution, the overall
amino-acid sequence in both genes is very similar and the
introns are located at the same amino acid position. Furthermore, gene duplication often correlates with a tissue
specific expression pattern of the duplicated genes, which
is true for mammalian cortactin and HS1.

Figure 4 displays a hypothetical model for the origin of
the cortactin and HS1 genes during evolution. The oldest
ancestor is the sponge that, like sea squirt (urochordate),
carries one cortactin protein with 5 c1/2 repeats. Insects
have also one cortactin gene and evolved to 4 1/2 repeats.
During evolution, after the creation of the sponge and the
worms, the coelomata divided into insects and urochordates (that evolved later into vertebrates). This suggests
that during the evolution, the number of repeats
decreased in the insects. Unfortunately, no genomic
sequences of ancestors of the coelomata that could reveal
the roots of cortactin evolution are available yet to perform more detailed genomic analysis.
The genome of pufferfish Takifugu rubripes contains two
cortactin-related genomic sequences both including 5 1/2
repeats. Most likely, an ancestor vertebrate cortactin gene
underwent gene duplication. From this moment on during evolution, two cortactin/HS1-releated genes are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/15

present in all higher species. One gene evolved to mammalian HS1 with a specific function in apoptosis in
hematopoietic cells. For its function, exon 8 and 9 (encoding repeat 3 and 4) were not useful and lost during evolution. However, the HS1 protein in pufferfish Takifugu
rubripes and frog Xenopus laevis contains 5 1/2 repeats,
while chicken and pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis HS1
carries 4 1/2 repeats. It might be of interest to investigate
the function of these HS1 proteins and their functional
differences to mammalian HS1. The other gene evolved to
a ubiquitously expressed mammalian cortactin protein
with a vital function in the organization of the cytoskeleton and cell migration. The 6th repeat of cortactin most
likely originated from a duplication event of the 5th
repeat, since the 6th repeat is most similar to the 5th repeat
in all species with 6 1/2 repeats. We recently demonstrated
that 6 1/2 repeats are necessary for optimal F-actin crosslinking activity and cell migration, while the splice variant
lacking both the 5th and 6th repeats (SV2) was less efficient [14]. Thus, the number of repeats in the F-actin binding domain of cortactin fine-tunes its function in
cytoskeletal remodeling. For that reason, in higher metazoans, alternative splicing of the F-actin binding domain
is most likely facilitated by a GT-GC transition in the
splice donor. Alternatively, we can not exclude that gene
duplication might have taken place after duplicated of the
5th repeat (dotted arrows), since both zebrafish cortactin
and HS1 contain 6 1/2 repeats.

Conclusions
We report the genomic organization of cortactin and HS1
genes of several species. These genes display a conserved
genomic organization as the coding regions have almost
identical exon/intron structure. Comparison of 5'
sequences allows possible regulatory elements that stress
their specific tissue distribution. Comparative analysis of
the genomic organization and amino acid sequences of
cortactin and HS1 provides insight into the evolution of
the conserved actin-binding repeat domain, which forms
the basis towards understanding specific functions of
both genes. Most likely, both genes originated from a gene
duplication event and subsequently HS1 lost two repeats,
whereas cortactin gained one repeat. Our analysis genetically underscores the significance of the F-actin binding
domain in cytoskeletal remodeling, which is of importance for the major role of HS1 in apoptosis and for cortactin in cell migration.

actin sequences (NCBI, GenBank accession no. M98343)
using BLASTn [59] revealed homology with two genomic
clones (GenBank accession no. AP000487 and
AP000405). With these clones, we determined all exon/
intron boundaries and size of all introns and exons (Table
2A) of the human cortactin gene by (1) performing BLAST
comparisons with the cDNA against the genomic DNA
and (2) using the GeneFinder program [60] based on the
consensus sequence of exon-intron junctions ('gt ... ag'

rule of intronic sequence) as well as on the codon usage
within ORF [61].
To confirm the predicted genomic structure, we determined the intron/exon boundaries using a cloning procedure as described [62]. Genomic DNA of two cosmid
clones COS-7.12 and COS-3.72 covering the cortactin
gene as determined by the full-length cDNA [5], was
amplified with randomly selected primers from the cDNA
sequence (GeneBank accession no. M98343). All PCR

products that were larger than the cDNA control sample
were considered to be caused by intron sequences and
compared to genomic sequence (accession number
AP000487 and AP000405) using BLASTn [59]. The size of
intron 1, 5, 8, 12 and 13 was too large to obtain a reliable
sequence.
Because no overlapping genomic sequences immediately
5' of the first exon were present in the database, we performed sequence analysis of a 2.7-kb HincII-HincII fragment representing the first exon and its 5'-flanking
sequences from cosmid COS-7.12 cloned into pUC18
(p5'EMS_3135). In addition, we sequenced a 5-kb PCR
product using a 5'-primer in the vector (within the TET
gene) and 3'-primer (p3135p601: 5'-ccgggtcggccctggattcc3') within exon 1, subcloned in pUC18 (p5'EMS_4911).
Nucleotide sequences of both products were compared
with the genomic clones representing the cortactin gene
present in the NCBI database (Accession number
AP000487 (GI 8118774 and GI 6277297) and AP000405
(GI 8118742)) and used to define the 7.4 kb 5'-flanking

Database searching
The (deduced) protein and genomic sequences of all cortactin and HS1 genes were retrieved from various WEBsites and their available sequence data are summarized in
Table 1. In addition, partial cortactin sequences (ESTs
and/or genomic) of various organisms were identified
based on amino acid sequence homology with existing
cortactin proteins. The genomic organization of the sea
squirt and Takifugu rubripes could not be completely elucidated, because cDNA/genomic sequences were only partially available. All data were compiled using BLAST
searches of the following databases: National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (Bethesda, MD, USA)
[65]; The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Cambridge,
UK) [66]; EnsEMBL of The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Cambridge, UK) [67]; DOE Joint Genome Institute
(Walnut Creek, CA, USA) [68]; TIGR: The Institute for
Genomic Research (Rockville, MD, USA) [69]; DNA Data
Bank of Japan (Mishima, Shizuoka, Japan) [70]; Nematode.net Genome Sequencing Center (St. Louis, MO,
USA) [71]; Wormbase (NY, USA) [72]; European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) (Cambridge, UK) [73]; Genoscope National Sequencing Center (Evry, France) [74];

and UCSC Genome Bioinformatics (Santa Cruz, CA, USA)
[76].

To determine the exon/intron boundaries of all cortactin
and HS1 genes, available genomic sequences were subjected to sequence alignments of each species-specific
cDNA sequence using the BLAST program of NCBI. Using
the same algorithms, as described for human cortactin,
the exon/intron-boundaries could be predicted. The
complete genomic sequences of the 5' flanking region of
cortactin of human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, fruit fly, and
mosquito were determined using the various accession
numbers of genomic DNA in Table 1. Putative transcription factor binding sites of 800 bp of the 5' flanking
regions where determined by the TFSEARCH program
(Figure 2). The predicted exon in intron 6 of HS1 was
predicted by the bio-informatics program HMMER [77])
The human cortactin 6 1/2 repeats of the actin-binding
domain were aligned, resulting in a consensus sequence:
(kfGvqkdrvDksAvGfdyqekvekhesqkDysk). With HMMER
this consensus sequence was 'tBLASTn' to intron 6 of
human HS1. With an acceptable probability (E-value
0.095), the program predicted an exon in this intron 6 (at
location 3271–3381).
Amino acid sequence comparisons
Sequence alignments were carried out using the BLAST
program of NCBI. The multiple sequence alignments of
various cortactin proteins were constructed using Basic
GeneBee ClustalW 1.83 [78]. The genome, cDNA or protein was completed for all cortactin homologues and the
number of repeats differs across species and between HS1
and cortactin. Only the N-terminal of cortactin and HS1
proteins including repeat 3 (corresponding to amino acid
1–190 of human cortactin) was used to generate a phylogenetic tree, because this is the most conserved part. Predicted nuclear localization signals sequences were
obtained using Predict NLS program [79].
