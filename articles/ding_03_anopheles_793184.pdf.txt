Abstract
Background: Twenty-eight genes putatively encoding cytosolic glutathione transferases have
been identified in the Anopheles gambiae genome. We manually annotated these genes and then
confirmed the annotation by sequencing of A. gambiae cDNAs. Phylogenetic analysis with the 37
putative GST genes from Drosophila and representative GSTs from other taxa was undertaken to
develop a nomenclature for insect GSTs. The epsilon class of insect GSTs has previously been
implicated in conferring insecticide resistance in several insect species. We compared the
expression level of all members of this GST class in two strains of A. gambiae to determine whether
epsilon GST expression is correlated with insecticide resistance status.
Results: Two A. gambiae GSTs are alternatively spliced resulting in a maximum number of 32
transcripts encoding cytosolic GSTs. We detected cDNAs for 31 of these in adult mosquitoes.
There are at least six different classes of GSTs in insects but 20 of the A. gambiae GSTs belong to
the two insect specific classes, delta and epsilon. Members of these two GST classes are clustered
on chromosome arms 2L and 3R respectively. Two members of the GST supergene family are
intronless. Amongst the remainder, there are 13 unique introns positions but within the epsilon
and delta class, there is considerable conservation of intron positions. Five of the eight epsilon
GSTs are overexpressed in a DDT resistant strain of A. gambiae.
Conclusions: The GST supergene family in A. gambiae is extensive and regulation of transcription
of these genes is complex. Expression profiling of the epsilon class supports earlier predictions that
this class is important in conferring insecticide resistance.

Background
Glutathione transferases (GSTs) are a diverse family of
dimeric proteins found in almost all living organisms.
Originally studied for their role in detoxification of
endogenous and xenobiotic compounds, they have since

been found to have additional important roles as transport proteins and in protection against oxidative stress [1].
Each GST subunit consists of two domains, each containing two binding sites, the G site and the H site. The highly
conserved G site binds the tripeptide glutathione and is

largely composed of amino acid residues found in the Nterminal domain. The H-site or substrate binding site is
more variable in structure and is largely formed from residues at the C-terminal [2].
Purification of independent homogenous GST preparations with differing substrate specificities indicated the
presence of multiple forms of GSTs [3]. Subsequently, the
availability of N-terminal sequence data led to the recognition of five classes of cytosolic GSTs in mammals, the
alpha, mu, pi, theta and sigma classes [2,4,5] and an additional, structurally unrelated membrane bound microsomal class [6]. Recently the advent of large scale EST and
full genome sequencing projects has led to a marked
increase in the number of GST classes recognized. Some of
these, such as the omega and zeta classes are represented
in a wide range of species [7,8], whereas others, such as
the mammalian kappa class [9], the insect epsilon class
[10] and the plant tau and phi clases [11] have a more
restricted distribution.
Most of these GST classes are encoded by multigene families. Alternative splicing [12,13] and the formation of
heterodimers [14], can add a further level of heterogeneity
to this enzyme family. With this level of diversity, assigning physiological functions to individual GSTs is a complex task, but progress towards this goal can be greatly
facilitated by the process of cataloguing the number of
genes within the supergene family. Armed with this information, details of expression profiles, induction mechanisms, tissue distribution etc. can be accurately obtained
enabling biologically important questions to be
addressed. Automatic annotation algorithms applied to
assembled eukaryotic genomes provide projections of the
sizes of gene families within a species. Using these tools
the numbers of GST genes is estimated at 10 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 57 in Caenorhabditis elegans, 43 in Drosophila melanogaster, 37 in Anopheles gambiae, 46 in
Arabidopsis thaliana and 40 in Homo sapiens [15]. Careful
manual annotation is essential to confirm these predicted
numbers. This process has led to revised sizes of the GST
supergene family in A. thaliana and A. gambiae to 48 and
31 respectively [11,16]. (This gene count in A. gambiae
includes three genes encoding putative microsomal GSTs
but these will not be discussed further in this report).
To facilitate the functional characterization of insect GSTs,
we have studied the annotation of each member of this
supergene family in the mosquito A. gambiae. RT-PCR
experiments demonstrate that all but one of the predicted
GST genes are actively transcribed in adult mosquitoes
and that alternative splicing of two GST genes contributes
additional diversity. We compare this GST supergene family with that of a second Diptera, D. melanogaster and identify classes of GSTs that are conserved between the species

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/35

and other classes that have undergone independent
radiation.
The majority of studies on insect GSTs have focused on
their role in conferring insecticide resistance (e.g. [17–
19]) and, more recently, in protecting against cellular
damage by oxidative stress [20,21]. Reactive oxygen species can be produced in response to infection by pathogens, and this phenomenon has been implicated in the
defense mechanism of mosquitoes against malaria parasites [22]. A. gambiae, is therefore an ideal species in which
to study the role of GSTs in both of these biological processes. This species is the major vector of malaria in Africa
and as such is responsible for over 1 million deaths each
year [23]. Efforts to control the disease by targeting the
mosquito populations have relied on treatment of Anopheles breeding and resting sites with insecticides. The organochlorine DDT was the insecticide of choice for malaria
control for much of the latter half of the 20th century and
is still employed in public health campaigns today but, in
many malarious regions, resistance has rendered DDTbased control programmes ineffectual. In A. gambiae, DDT
resistance is associated with increased GST activity [24].
Genetic mapping using microsatellite markers has located
two loci associated with DDT resistance in A. gambiae
[25]. By aligning the cytogenetic position of these resistance loci with the in situ position of physically mapped
GST genes we previously identified two candidate resistance-associated GSTs [10]. Analysis of the draft genome
sequence of A. gambiae identified a further six GST genes
within this region of the genome [16]. We now report that
the expression of multiple members of this gene cluster is
elevated in DDT resistant insects.
Results and Discussion
Classification of A. gambiae GSTs
Twenty eight genes putatively encoding cytosolic GSTs
were identified in the A. gambiae genome (Table 1).
Nomenclature guidelines originally proposed for vertebrate GSTs and later expanded to incorporate invertebrate
classes [26], were employed when classifying the A. gambiae genes. This led to the renaming of nine genes previously described in the literature (changes are shown in
Table 1).

The putative amino acid sequences of the A. gambiae GSTs
were aligned using ClustalW [27] and GST-1 from C. elegans (Accession number CAA78471) as an outgroup (Figure 1). The alignment was manually truncated by the
removal of twenty positions at both the N-terminal and Cterminal that contained excessive gaps and two small
internal regions of poor alignment, one consisting of six
residues in the linker region between the N and C
domains and the second consisting of 21 residues in the
C-terminal domain of which over 75% were gaps in the

majority of sequences (Figure 1). This manually truncated
alignment, consisting of 218 residues, was used to determine the phylogenetic relationship between the A. gambiae GSTs by both distance and parsimony methods. Two
of the GST genes (GSTd1 and GSTs1) are alternatively
spliced to produce multiple transcripts with identical Ntermini but differing C-termini (see below). To avoid distortion of the phylogeny that may have resulted from
inclusion of conserved N-termini, a second alignment was
generated, in which a further 85 residues from the N-terminal, were removed and this alignment was also subjected to parsimony and distance methods. Although
several different optimal trees were generated from the
two alignments and two phylogenetic methods, their
topology was essentially the same, differing only in the
placement of four GSTs, GSTu1, GSTu2, GSTu3 and
GSTe8, discussed below. A representative distance tree,
derived from the N-terminal truncated alignment is
shown in Figure 2.
The two largest GST classes in A. gambiae are the insect
specific delta and epsilon classes with 12 and 8 members
respectively. Support for the monophyly of these two

classes is low in the tree shown although, when the 218
residue alignment is used, the bootstrap values are more
supportive (data not shown). Criteria for inclusion in a
particular class is based primarily on amino acid sequence
identity and phylogenetic relationship, but chromosomal
location and immunological properties, where known,
were taken into account. Thus GSTe8, although sharing
less than 29% amino acid identity with other members of
the epsilon class, is found immediately adjacent to the
seven epsilon GSTs on chromosome 3R, is immunologically related [28] and, in the majority of the trees, formed
a weakly supported monophyletic group with the seven
bona fide epsilon GSTs. Thus this GST was classified as the
eighth member of the epsilon class [28]. Three GSTs,
GSTu1, GSTu2 and GSTu3, are outliers from the major
delta GST clade (Figure 2). The phylogenetic relationship
of these GSTs to the remainder of the family was not consistent between the different trees. Furthermore, these
GSTs share less than 37% amino acid identity with other
members of the A. gambiae delta GST class (pairwise
amino acid identities between the three tentative delta
class GSTs and the remainder of the class range from
22.1% between GSTd4 and GSTu2 to 36.3% identity

between GSTd11 and GSTu3) and are not physically clustered with the majority of the delta class GSTs on chromosome 2L. Thus it is possible that these GSTs may belong to
an as yet unrecognised GST class (or classes) and in the
absence of clarifying immunological or biochemical data
these GSTs have been designated as unclassified (denoted
by a 'u').
Of the remaining, five A. gambiae GSTs, two belong to the
theta class, originally thought of as the progenitor class of
all GSTs [29]. The ubiquitous omega and zeta classes [7,8]
are each represented by a single gene in A. gambiae, and a
single sigma GST (alternatively spliced to produce two different transcripts (see below)) is also present. Support for

the classification of these five GSTs is provided by a phylogenetic comparison with their orthologous classes from
other organisms (Figure 3).
With the exception of the sigma class, all of the non-insect
specific classes are expanded in D. melanogaster relative to
A. gambiae. Neither species has any sequence related to the
mitochondrial kappa class found in mammals [9]. The
endogenous function of these mammalian GST classes in
insects has not been clearly resolved and therefore the significance of the difference in size of these classes in the
two Diptera examined, is, at present, unknown.

Amplification of A. gambiae cDNAs
Transcripts from 27 of the 28 A. gambiae GST genes were
detected in fourth instar larvae or one-day-old adults by
RT-PCR. Expression of GSTd9 was not detected in any life
stage and thus it is possible that this gene represents a
silent pseudogene, as suggested earlier [10]. A second
putative pseudogene is GSTd6. Utilisation of the first
inframe stop codon for this gene (as present in the
genome sequence database) would generate a transcript
with 885 bp of coding sequence (> 130 bp longer than
any of the other cytosolic GST genes in this species) and
the putative translation would encompass a string of 14
glutamine residues. We therefore sequenced the intergenic region between GSTd6 and the neighbouring gene,

GSTd11 to detect any possible frame shifts or sequencing
errors that may have masked the stop codon but none
were detected. A GSTd6 transcript of 666 bp was amplified
by RT-PCR but attempts at 3' RACE have so far failed to
detect the 3' end of this transcript.
Intron positions and sizes
The cDNA sequences of the A. gambiae GSTs were aligned
with the genomic DNA sequences retrieved from the
genome database and the position and sizes of the introns
noted. Intron size ranged from 64 bp in GSTe1 and GSTd4
to 13,937 bp in GSTz1 with the majority of introns ranging from 50 to 100 bp (Figure 4). Only two of the GSTs are
intronless, GSTd2 and the putative pseudogene, GSTd9.

This contrasts with the situation in D. melanogaster where
20 of the 37 D. melanogaster GST genes are intronless
[10,30].

addition, the phase of this intron is not conserved
between the different classes, and thus the classification of
this as an ancient intron is not well supported.

There are thirteen unique intron sites and 42 introns
within the A. gambiae GST supergene family. The majority
of the introns (28) are phase 0 introns, i.e. the intron does
not interrupt a codon. There is a considerable conservation of intron positions within the different GST classes
(Figure 2) and one intron is found in 17 GST genes spanning three different classes. Interestingly this conserved
intron, found approximately 50 amino acid residues from
the N-terminal, is also the splice site for the alternative
transcripts of GSTs1 and GSTd1 (see below). It has been
proposed, by proponents of the 'introns-early' hypothesis,
that different exons correspond to different domains in a
protein [31]. The highly conserved GST intron however,
splits the N-terminal domain (roughly residue 1–80). In

Clustering of GST genes in the genome
The A. gambiae GST genes are located on all three of the
mosquito's chromosomes but two large, gene-specific
clusters exist (Figure 5). The eight members of the epsilon
GST class are clustered on chromosome 3R division 33B.
In D. melanogaster, a cluster of 10 epsilon GSTs are located
on chromosome 2R, division 55C [30] (Figure 6B). A
search of the D. melanogaster genome identified a further
four members of this family also present on chromosome
2R but at a distant location. These four singletons belonging to the D. melanogaster epsilon GST class do not form a
monophyletic clade with the cluster of 10 DmGSTE genes
(Figure 6A). Instead, one of these Drosophila GSTs
(CG4688) is a probable ortholog of A. gambiae GSTe8.

Schematic diagram indicating the organisation of GST genes in the A. gambiae genome
Figure 5
Schematic diagram indicating the organisation of GST genes in the A. gambiae genome. The numbers represent polytene chromosome divisions. Those genes marked with * are alternatively spliced to produce multiple transcripts.

Within the A. gambiae epsilon GST class there is evidence
of recent internal duplications within this gene cluster.
For example GSTe4 and GSTe5 have diverged recently and
are located next to each other within the cluster. Similarly
GSTe7, GSTe1 and GSTe2 are sequentially arranged and
phylogeneticaly closely related (Figure 6A and 6B).
The A. gambiae delta class GSTs are located in two closely
linked clusters of six genes on chromosome 2R divisions
18B and 19D (Figure 7B). Ten members of the D. melanogaster delta class are sequentially arranged on chromosome 3R, division 87B. We have identified an eleventh
putative member of this class (CG17639) in D. melanogaster that is a clear ortholog of A. gambiae GSTd7 [10]
(Figure 7B). A detailed analysis of the phylogenetic relationship between members of the A. gambiae delta GST
class, supports the suggestion by Holt et al [15] that the

two clusters of paralogous delta GSTs are partly a result of
segmental duplication. The clustering of GSTd8 with
GSTd11, GSTd6 with GSTd9 and GSTd5 with GSTd10 is
consistent with a duplication of a cluster of three paralogous genes, with subsequent further local duplications in
one block to give rise to GSTd4 and GSTd3 (Figure 7A and
7B).
In both A. gambiae and D. melanogaster local duplications
in the epsilon and delta GST families have led to independent expansions of these gene classes. Subsequent
diversification of these enzymes has presumably facilitated the adaptation of the two Diptera to their different
ecological niches.

Alternative Splicing
An A. gambiae delta class GST, GSTd1, that is alternatively
spliced to give four different mature transcripts each
encoding subunits with differing biochemical properties,
has already been described [12]. Here we report that a second member of this supergene family belonging to the
sigma class, is also alternatively spliced in a similar manner producing two distinct transcripts both of which have
been detected in adults by RT-PCR (Figure 8). As with
GSTd1 the two transcripts of GSTs1 share a common 5'
exon but differing 3' exons (64.3% identity at the amino
acid level). As the carboxyl region of the protein contains
the majority of the residues involved in substrate binding

(the H-site), the two subunits encoded by the sigma GST
gene in A. gambiae are likely to encode proteins with differing substrate specificities.
The sigma class in D. melanogaster is also represented by a
single gene, DmGSTs1. The Drosophila GST has an N-terminal extension of 46 amino acid residues relative to the
Anopheles ortholog. This N-terminal extension is not
essential for catalytic activity and may play a role in
attaching the D. melanogaster protein to indirect flight
muscles [21]. The intron positions of DmGSTS1 and A
gambiae GSTs1-1 are conserved indicating a common

ancestor for these genes. Local duplication of the carboxyl
exons of the A. gambiae GSTs1 gene presumably occurred
subsequent to the speciation event separating the two
Diptera.
Alternative splicing as a means of increasing the level of
heterogeneity of GST subunits appears to be a rare phenomenon outside of the genus Anopheles, having, as far as
we are aware, only been reported in a GST from the
nematode Onchocerca volvulus [13]. Two human cDNA
clones encoding alternative transcripts of a mu class GST
have been detected but both are incomplete and thus
unlikely to encode functional GSTs [32].

Expression profiling of epsilon GSTs
Our principal interest in insect GSTs stems from the role
that these enzymes play in insecticide resistance. GSTs
have been implicated in the conjugation, metabolism or
remediation of harmful effects of all major classes of
insecticides, but our studies have focused on the role of
these enzymes in the detoxification of DDT. From genetic
mapping studies [25] we know that a major DDT resistance locus co-localises with the epsilon GST cluster on
chromosome 3R, division 33B. We have previously demonstrated that expression of one member of this GST class,
GSTe2, is up-regulated in a DDT resistant strain [10] and
that a recombinant homodimer of GSTe2 is very efficient
at metabolising DDT [28]. In the present study we used
quantitative PCR to compare the expression levels of all
members of the epsilon class in DDT resistant and suscepPage 11 of 16

tible strains. The results are shown in Figure 9A. Five of the
eight GSTs are expressed at a significantly higher levels in
the resistant strain. The difference in expression levels is
greatest for GSTe2 and GSTe7 (Table 2). Of the five GSTs
that are expressed at higher levels in the DDT resistant
strain, only GSTe2 has confirmed DDT dehydrochlorinase
activity. The ability of recombinant homodimers of
GSTe3 and GSTe7 to metabolise DDT has not yet been
determined. However, we have previously shown that neither GSTe1 or GSTe4 homodimers possess DDT dehydrochlorinase activity [28] and yet the expression of both of
these genes is upregulated in the DDT resistant strain
(Table 2). This result is most readily explained if it is
assumed that the expression of multiple genes in the epsilon cluster is under the control of a common regulatory
element and that an alteration in this element accounts
for the increase in expression of the six epsilon GST genes.
Nonetheless other explanations, such as modifications in
the stability of the mRNA transcripts in the resistant strain
can not be eliminated at this stage.
There was a large variation in the number of transcripts
detected for each of the individual GSTs within both the
susceptible and resistant strains. For example, the normalised copy number of GSTe2 transcripts was over 26-fold
greater than that of GSTe3 in the resistant strain (Table 2).
This indicates that the basal expression of individual GSTs
within a cluster is independently regulated. To confirm
this result, we repeated the qPCR for four of the GSTs
using gDNA as a template. If the differences seen with
cDNA reflect genuine differences in GST transcript copy
number as we hypothesised, then the genomic copy
number for each of the four GSTs would be approximately
the same. Figure 9 and Table 2 support our hypothesis.
Furthermore, as the genomic qPCR was carried out on
DNA extracted from both susceptible and resistant mosquitoes, the results shown in Figure 9B support our
unpublished data from Southern blots demonstrating
that the increases in GST transcript levels seen in the resistant strain is not due to gene amplification (F. Ortelli,
unpublished data).
As a final test of the reliability of our qPCR results we calculated the expected copy number of a single copy gene in
10.4 ng of A. gambiae genomic DNA (the starting amount
of gDNA template in the qPCR reactions with Kisumu
DNA). The theoretical copy number (33,120) was within
an order of magnitude of the range of values obtained
(11,993–17,205).

Conclusion
The insect GST supergene family encodes a diverse set of
proteins. The availability of the full genome sequence for
two insect species has enabled the full extent of this protein family in insects to be realised. Multiple members of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/35

the epsilon class are upregulated in a DDT resistant strain
of A. gambiae and it is proposed that this class plays a
major role in the detoxification of xenobiotics. However,
little is known about the endogenous substrates of insect
GSTs. Functional genomics approaches will no doubt
contribute to our understanding of the role of individual
GSTs in insects and perhaps then the reason for the extensive diversity of this enzyme family will become clear.

Methods
Mosquito Strains
The DDT resistant ZAN/U strain of Anopheles gambiae s.s.
originated from a field population collected from
Zanzibar, Tanzania, in 1982. Adults from this strain have
been maintained under regular selection pressure by
exposure to Whatmans no.1 filter papers impregnated
with 4% DDT according to standard WHO methods [33].
The Kisumu strain is susceptible to insecticides and originates from Kisumu in Western Kenya.
Annotation of A. gambiae GST genes
Members of the GST supergene family were identified in
the A. gambiae genome by BLAST searches [34] using multiple representative sequences from each GST class as
query sequences. The sequences retrieved from the
genome were manually annotated to predict transcription
initiation and termination sites and intron/exon boundaries using BlastX comparisons of putative amino acid
translations [35]. Primers pairs were designed to amplify
the full length of the coding sequence of each gene from
A. gambiae cDNA.
cDNA synthesis
Total RNA was extracted from individual mosquitoes
using the TRI reagent (SIGMA), according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was treated with
DNase to remove any contaminating genomic DNA and
the mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using superscript II (GIBCO BRL) and an oligo (dT) adapter primer
(5'-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGA(dT)17-3'). The PCR conditions for amplifying GST cDNAs were determined empirically for each GST. Products of the expected size were
subcloned into pGEM T-easy vectors (Promega) and used
as templates for sequencing. At least three independent
clones were sequenced for each GST. Sequencing reactions
were performed using Beckman chemistry and the resultant products analysed on a Beckman CEQ800 capillary
sequencer.
Quantitative PCR
Total RNA was extracted from pools of ten (five male and
five female) one-day old adult mosquitoes and the mRNA
was reverse transcribed into cDNA as described above.
Plasmids containing the gene of interest were diluted to
produce seven standard templates at concentrations

ranging from 1 ng/µl to 1 fg/µl. The incorporation of the
fluorescent dye SYBR Green during PCR amplification of
these templates was detected using Roche LightCycler
technology and Quantitect SYBR Green chemistry (Qiagen). For each experiment two replicates of each of the
seven plasmid templates and two replicates of three cDNA
samples from both strains, all synthesised from independent RNA extractions, were used. The binding sites of the
primers used for template amplification were chosen to
avoid regions of allelic variation within the gene
sequences [28]. A control plasmid containing a partial
fragment of the S7 ribosomal protein gene [36] was used
to standardise the initial cDNA concentration in each
sample. Details of the primer sequences and PCR
conditions are given in Table 3. The samples were analysed using LightCycler Software V3 (Roche) and the

number of GST copies in the cDNA sample was determined as described previously [37].
The experiment was repeated on genomic DNA samples
extracted from approx 1 g of Kisumu or ZAN/U strains as
described previously [38]. For the GST genes for which the
initial primers spanned introns, new plasmids were constructed containing the genomic fragment of the gene.
Phylogenetic analysis
Putative amino acid sequences of the GSTs were aligned
using ClustalW [27]. The alignment was manually truncated as described in the Results and Discussion section.
Evolutionary distances were calculated using the JukesCantor algorithm [39] and phylogenetic trees were
determined by the neighbor-joining method [40] with
