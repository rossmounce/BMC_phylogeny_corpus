Abstract
Background: In addition to vertical transmission, organisms can also acquire genes from other distantly related
species or from their extra-chromosomal elements (plasmids and viruses) via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). It has
been suggested that phages represent substantial forces in prokaryotic evolution. In eukaryotes, retroviruses, which
can integrate into host genome as an obligate step in their replication strategy, comprise approximately 8% of the
human genome. Unlike retroviruses, few members of other virus families are known to transfer genes to host
genomes.
Results: Here we performed a systematic search for sequences related to circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
viruses in publicly available eukaryotic genome databases followed by comprehensive phylogenetic analysis. We
conclude that the replication initiation protein (Rep)-related sequences of geminiviruses, nanoviruses and
circoviruses have been frequently transferred to a broad range of eukaryotic species, including plants, fungi,
animals and protists. Some of the transferred viral genes were conserved and expressed, suggesting that these
genes have been coopted to assume cellular functions in the host genomes. We also identified geminivirus-like
and parvovirus-like transposable elements in genomes of fungi and lower animals, respectively, and thereby
provide direct evidence that eukaryotic transposons could derive from ssDNA viruses.
Conclusions: Our discovery extends the host range of circular ssDNA viruses and sheds light on the origin and
evolution of these viruses. It also suggests that ssDNA viruses act as an unforeseen source of genetic innovation in
their hosts.

Background
In addition to vertical transmission and gene acquisition
from other distantly related species via horizontal gene
transfer (HGT), organisms can also capture genetic
material from extra-chromosomal elements (plasmids
and viruses) during evolution. It is widely accepted that
phages represent substantial forces in prokaryotic evolution, with the integrated phages (prophages) accounting
for as much as 10-20% of some bacterial genomes [1,2].
In eukaryotes, animal retroviruses, which can integrate
into host genome as an obligate step in their replication
strategy, comprise approximately 8% of the human

genome in the form of inherited endogenous retroviruses [3]. Moreover, the integrated retroviral genes
have been demonstrated to play critical role in mammalian reproduction [4,5]. Recent data reveal that several
non-retroviral viruses have also contributed to the
genetic makeup of many eukaryotic organisms [6-15].
Especially, genes derived from ancestral nudiviruses
have been co-opted to facilitate a parasitic lifestyle in
parasitoid wasps [7]; and a gene derived from partitiviruses was exapted to regulate the activities of the phytohormone auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in
Arabidopsis thaliana [12]. Still, this type of transfer is
thought to be rare in eukaryotes.
Viruses with circular single stranded DNA (ssDNA)
genomes are the smallest viruses known to infect eukaryotes and are currently grouped into four families:

Anelloviridae, Circoviridae, Geminiviridae and Nanoviridae (Virus Taxonomy: 2009, ICTV, http://www.ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp?version = 2009). The
members of the first two families infect vertebrates and
of the last two families infect plants. Recently a virus
distantly related to circoviruses carrying a covalently
closed circular, partially double-stranded ssDNA genome has been found to infect the marine diatom Chaetoceros salsugineum [16]. A similar virus was also
discovered in C. debilis [17]. Moreover, recent viral
metagenomic studies have shown that small circular
ssDNA viruses are more prevalent and diverse in the
environment than previously recognized [18-22].
Small circular ssDNA viruses commonly replicate
their genomes in the nuclei of infected cells via a rolling circle replication (RCR) mechanism initiated by
virus-encoded replication initiation protein (Rep), and
there are clear similarities among the sequences of
these proteins [23,24]. So far, no associated integrase
activity has been identified for these viruses. However,
Bejarano et al [25] reported multiple repeats of geminiviral Rep DNA that have been integrated into the
nuclear genome of tobacco. In addition, Rep-like genes
were also found in genomes of the parasitic protozoan
Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia intestinalis [26].
These discoveries suggest that the small circular
ssDNA viruses could also contribute to the genetic
heritage of eukaryotic organisms. Considering that the
circular ssDNA viruses are widespread in nature, the
role played by these viruses in eukaryotic evolution
needs to be evaluated.
Accordingly, we performed a systematic search for
sequences related to known small circular ssDNA
viruses in the publicly available eukaryotic genome databases. As our study was being prepared for publication,
an independent group of investigators reported that
sequences related to circoviruses were detected in the
genomes of six vertebrate species [27]. Here we report
our more comprehensive and convincing results based
on sufficiently critical data analysis, bench research and
phylogenetic analysis. Our studies have not only corroborated the integration of circovirus-related sequences
in these six species, but they have also revealed that
numerous sequences related to circoviruses, geminiviruses and nanoviruses have been integrated into the
germlines of diverse eukaryotes including plants, fungi,
animals and protists. Furthermore, we have demonstrated some of these integrated genes were conserved
and expressed in eukaryotic organisms. In addition, we
also identified geminivirus-like and parvovirus-like
transposable elements in the genomes of fungi and
lower animals, respectively. The origin and evolution of
small circular ssDNA viruses were also discussed.

Results and discussion
Identification of circular ssDNA viral Rep-related proteins
in eukaryotic systems

Rep proteins are commonly encoded by mobile elements
(most phages and eukaryotic ssDNA viruses, some plasmids of Gram-positive bacteria, eukaryotic helitron
transposons, etc.) but without cellular homologs and
therefore have been recognized as virus/plasmid-specific
proteins (hallmark proteins) [28,29]. The Rep proteins
of eukaryotic ssDNA viruses contain RCR catalytic
domain and a C-terminal NTPase/helicase domain
[30,31]. With such structure, the sequence of the Rep
protein of geminiviruses readily detected those of the
geminivirus Rep catalytic domain (Gemini_AL1), central
domain (Gemini_AL1_M) and the RNA helicase domain
(RNA_helicase) by using the NCBI Conserved Domain
Database searches (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi) (see Additional file 1: Figure S1).
Likewise, the Rep of nanoviruses and circoviruses
detected the putative viral replication protein domain
(Viral_Rep) and the RNA helicase domain. On the other
hand, the Rep of pLS1 family of prokaryotic plasmids
[32] comprises only plasmid replication protein domain
(Rep_2). Recently, the plasmid Rep containing an additional helicase domain has also been reported in a phytoplasma [33].
To investigate sequences closely related to Rep proteins of eukaryotic circular ssDNA viruses in other systems, we used the representative Rep proteins of
geminiviruses and circoviruses to search against NCBI
non-redundant (NR) protein database by PSI-BLAST
[34]. After removing the known eukaryotic circular
ssDNA viruses and subsequent reverse BLAST comparisons, we obtained a final dataset containing 113 Replike protein sequences from plasmids, other eukaryotic
viruses and cellular genomes respectively (see Additional
file 2: Tabular data S1). Most of these belonged to bacterial plasmids (typically phytoplasmal plasmids) and
bacterial genomes. Conserved Domain searches showed
that, apart from the known Rep_2 plus RNA_helicase
domains, Rep proteins from bacterial plasmids had two
other types of domain arrangements: Gemini_AL1 plus
RNA_helicase and Viral_Rep plus RNA_helicase (see
Additional file 1: Figure S1 and Additional file 2: Tabular data S1). The domain organization of Rep-like proteins from bacterial genomes showed high similarity to
those of plasmids suggesting that these cellular homologs may originate from their plasmid counterparts.
One apparently truncated Rep-like protein from the
mitochondrion of oomycete Phytophthora sojae [35]
contained Gemini_AL1 domain. Interestingly, we also
found its coordinates in mitochondrion type II haplotypes of P. infestans [36] (Figure 1A), which has not

been identified in previous reports. The mitochondrial
regions containing the Rep-like sequences were absent
in mitochondrion of P. ramorum and the type I haplotypes of P. infestans [36]. In addition, they are most closely related to the Reps of plasmids from the red algae
Porphyra tenera [37]. These findings suggest that the
Rep-like sequences are most likely derived from an integrated plasmid. Two circovirus Rep-related sequences
have been found in the genome of canarypox virus [38]
but not in other poxviruses, thus suggesting that they
were acquired horizontally.
Our dataset also included the previously reported Replike genes in the genome of G. intestinalis isolate BRIS/
92/HEPU/1541 and E. histolytica HM-1:IMSS [26].
These genes have been shown to be present in G. intestinalis ATCC 50581 strain GS/M H7 but not present in
the G. intestinalis ATCC 50803 WB genome [39]. We

found that two sequences of human gut viral metagenome from Genomic Survey Sequence (GSS) database
share sequence similarities not only with the Rep-like
genes of G. intestinalis but also with their neighboring
genes (Figure 1B). This could provide evidence that
these genes were originated from integrated proviruses.
In addition to the known Rep-like genes in genomes of
E. histolytica and G. intestinalis, we also identified 20
new Rep-like genes in genomes of other protozoan species as well as fungi, placozoans, and roundworms (see
Additional file 2: Tabular data S1). Among these, the
fungal Rep-like proteins contained the geminivirus-like
domain, while the rest have domain similarities with
Reps of nanoviruses or circoviruses. These findings suggest that the eukaryotic circular ssDNA viral genes may
be of widespread occurrence in their host genomes but
have yet to be discovered.

Identification and validation of eukaryotic endogenous
circular ssDNA virus-like sequences in germline genomes

Characteristics and phylogenies of endogenous circular
ssDNA virus-like sequences

To conduct this survey, we performed a comprehensive
BLAST searches using as queries the viral Rep-like proteins in eukaryotic genomes and the protein sequences
of representative eukaryotic circular ssDNA viruses
against the genomic assemblies of 209 eukaryotes plus
other uncompleted eukaryotic genomes in HTGS, WGS
and GSS databases. This process identified 305 significant matches to Rep or CP proteins of geminiviruses,
nanoviruses and circoviruses (Table 1 and Additional
file 2: Tabular data S2). The most abundant of these
virus-like sequences were related to the Rep genes,
while only three sequences (one geminivirus-like, two
circovirus-like) were related to CP genes, which were
detected in tobacco and sloth genomes respectively.
This finding is consistent with previous metagenomic
research; possibly due to the fact that the Rep gene is
more conserved during evolution. However, the possibility that possession of Rep sequences may offer some
selective advantage to the host species cannot be ruled
out either.
Because circular ssDNA viruses replicate their genomes in the nuclei of their host cells, sequence similarities between these viruses and host genomes could be
attributed to trivial contamination of eukaryotic genomic DNA with viral sequences during cloning or
sequence assembly. To rule out this possibility, we did a
closer inspection of the raw sequence reads used for
WGS assembly and the results indicated deep sequencing coverage across the junctions between the endogenous virus-like sequences and adjacent cellular
sequences (see Additional file 2: Tabular data S2). These
results suggest that the endogenous viral sequences
were not artifacts of cloning or sequence assembly. For
some eukaryotic genomes, the trace archives were not
available, but their endogenous viral sequences underwent various degrees of degradation (see Additional file
2: Tabular data S2), suggesting that the viral sequences
had invaded host genomes millions of years ago and
therefore represent established germline infections. To
validate these observations, we amplified and sequenced
the endogenous circovirus-like sequences and their
flanking host sequences from dog and cat tissues (Figure
2). The results revealed that the PCR products were of
the expected sizes and the experimental sequences were
identical to relevant regions of sequenced animal
genomes.
Altogether, we discovered endogenous virus-like
sequences in at least 35 species broadly distributed
among nuclear genomes of plants, fungi, animals and
protists. Remarkably, no anellovirus-like sequence was
detected in any eukaryotic genome, although these
viruses have been noted in various animal species [40].

Compared to related exogenous viral genes, some endogenous virus-like sequences are full-length or near fulllength genes while many others comprise only gene
fragments. Despite pronounced sequence divergence, the
conserved motifs of Rep protein can still be easily found
in putative protein sequences of endogenous virus-like
genes (see Additional file 1: Figure S2 and S3). The
endogenous viral sequences are generally interspersed
within non-coding regions of host genomes but several
were found to be inserted into the coding regions of
host genes or transposons (Figure 3). This finding suggests that these viral sequences have influenced host
genome evolution through gene disruption.
We next performed a comprehensive phylogenetic
analysis to determine the relationship between the endogenous virus-like sequences and known circular ssDNA
viruses as well as among endogenous sequences (Figure
4 and Additional file 1: Figure S4). As shown in Additional file 1: Figure S4, all the sequences formed three
large clades: geminivirus-like, nanovirus-like and circovirus-like. In each clade, the endogenous virus-like
sequences generally clustered distinctly with the known
viruses but did not fall into the established viral families,
suggesting that these virus-like sequences may have originated from previously undescribed circular ssDNA
viral lineages. An exception was the only virus-like
sequence detected in opossum (Monodelphis domestica)
genome, which clustered within the Circoviridae clade
and was most closely related to pig circoviruses.
Unlike Rep-like sequence in tobacco that were
acquired more recently from members of begomovirus
[41], one genera in the family Geminiviridae, the geminiviral Rep-like sequence in Populus, was located at the
base of the Geminiviridae clade in the phylogenetic tree
(Figure 4), suggesting that it was derived from integration of a Geminiviridae ancestor. Indeed, this sequence
was degenerate, containing three inframe stop codons
and one frameshift, an indication that it has been
inserted a million years ago. Alternatively, it represents
a distantly related geminiviral lineage infecting Populus.
All the virus-like sequences from fungi clustered
together and were most closely related to the Sclerotinia
sclerotiorum hypovirulence associated DNA virus 1
(SsHADV-1) (Figure 4), a mycovirus recently reported
by us [42], suggesting that these endogenous viral
sequences originated from SsHADV-1 like mycoviruses.
Moreover, the SsHADV-1-like Reps were prevalent in
viral metagenomes of different samples, including freshwater, human gut, rice paddy soil, marine environments
and mosquito (see Additional file 1: Figure S5).
Our phylogenetic analysis also suggests that the circular ssDNA viruses were likely to co-evolve with their

hosts over a long evolutionary time frame. For example,
the virus-like sequences from lower eukaryotes (such as
protozoans) were generally present at the base of each
clade while those in relatively higher eukaryotes were
more closely related to the known circoviruses, geminiviruses and nanoviruses that were infecting higher
eukaryotes (see Additional file 1: Figure S4). There were,

however, several exceptions, possibly due to horizontal
viral transfers over short periods of time.
In most cases, the endogenous virus-like sequences
from one species clustered together (such as those in
salmon louse, honeybee mite, Hydra and roundworm
species) (Additional file 1: Figure S4). Sequence comparison showed that, in each genome, some endogenous

viral copies may have resulted from segmental duplication within host genomes after a single original integration, as similar levels of identity are observed between
them as well as between their flanking genomic regions.
While others may have been derived from multiple
independent integration events, as no similarity was
observed among their flanking genomic sequences (see
Additional file 1: Figure S6).
Generally, the copy numbers of integrated viral
sequences are less than 10 copies per species; whereas
near sixty copies were identified in genomes of salmon
louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) and honeybee mite
(Varroa destructor) (see Additional file 1: Figure S4).

Comparison of the viral copies and their adjacent host
sequences in these two genomes showed that for most
viral copies, no similarity was observed among their
flanking genomic sequences, suggesting that most were
derived from multiple invasions of same or very similar
viruses. However, considering that the Rep protein of
eukaryotic ssDNA viruses has DNA binding, endonuclease and NTPase activity required for viral DNA replication [30,31], the integrated genes encoding Rep-like
proteins may catalyze their own single-strand excision
and invasion, and therefore act as selfish genetic elements capable of parasite-like proliferation in the host
genome. This scenario could be supported by the fact

that the putative products of Helitrons [43], a eukaryotic
rolling-circle transposon, shares motifs with the Reps of
RCR plasmids and ssDNA viruses. Based on this fact, it
has been suggested that ssDNA viruses might have
evolved from RC transposons [43]. Our finding of endogenous viral Rep-like genes, however, favors the hypothesis that Helitrons may have arisen from ssDNA viruses
which were integrated into the genome of an early
eukaryotic ancestor [44].
Identification of ssDNA virus-like transposable elements
in eukaryotic genomes

There are 42 geminivirus-like Rep genes or remnants
interspersed in the genome of Perigord black truffle
(Tuber melanosporum), an ectomycorrhizal fungus. All
but one are most closely related to each other and
formed a distinct clade (Figure 4). They share high (>
95%) nucleotide sequence identities with each other
and thus allow us to reconstruct a consensus sequence.
The reconstructed copy contains one interrupted Replike open reading frame (ORF), two transposase ORFs
(one is interrupted and the other is truncated), and
one microsatellite sequence (Figure 5A). It also contains 37-bp terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) but no
obvious target site duplications (TSDs). It is most
likely that this copy represents a novel transposon
related to geminivirus identified in a eukaryotic genome. The genetic distances among these transposable
repeats are very short suggesting that the transposons
have undergone recent large-scale amplification in the
host genome.
In addition to the geminivirus-like transposon, we
have also identified a parvovirus (linear ssDNA)-like
repetitive element in the acorn worm (Saccoglossus
kowalevskii) genome (see Additional file 2: Tabular data
S3). Like parvoviruses, this repetitive element contains
two large ORFs: one putative ORF encodes a protein
containing parvovirus non-structural protein NS1
domain (Parvo_NS, pfam01057) and the other putative
ORF encodes a protein containing parvovirus coat protein VP1 domain (Parvo_coat_N, pfam08398) (Figure
5B). It also possesses a palindromic hairpin structure at
its 5â terminal sequence, which is commonly found in
parvoviruses. There are over 50 copies of this repeat
interspersed in the genome. Some of these contained
degraded ORFs; and some contained only a single ORF
or a fragment. Furthermore, we also identified numerous parvovirus non-structural protein-like sequences in
genomes of the hydrozoan Hydra magnipapillata and
the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea (Figure 5B). We
noted that these have been annotated as integrated
virus-like element: DENSOV_HM and PIVE in Repbase
Update, respectively [Jurka J, Repbase Reports 8(3), 182182 (2008), http://www.girinst.org/2008/vol8/issue3/

Page 8 of 15

DENSOV_HM.html; Rebrikov DV et al. Repbase Reports
8(2), 166-166 (2008), http://www.girinst.org/2008/vol8/
issue2/PIVE.html].
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PIVE is more closely related to planarian (Girardia tigrina) virus, Planaria asexual strain-specific virus-like element (PEVE)
(see Additional file 1: Figure S7), which has not yet been
found to integrate in host genome [45]. The DENSOV_HM was located at the base of the papillomavirus
clade and did not cluster within family Papillomaviridae. Furthermore, their genome structure is different.
Therefore it may have originated from integration of the
virus in new family infecting hydrozoan. The parvovirus-like sequences from acorn worm grouped together
with PIVE_1p and PEVE small segment and these
further clustered with parvoviruses. Considering that the
genome structure of acorn worm repeated element is
also similar to parvoviruses, it is most likely that it
derived from parvovirus lineage infecting acorn worm
distantly related to known parvoviruses.
Consequently, these findings provide direct evidence
that eukaryotic transposons could originated from
ssDNA viruses.
Preservation and expression of endogenous viral genes in
host genomes

Examination of the potential coding capacity of endogenous viral sequences indicates that most were truncated and degraded, containing numerous premature
stop codons, frameshift mutations, and insertions or
deletions (see Additional file 2: Tabular data S2), suggesting that these are unlikely to have functions. Some
endogenous viral sequences however, were found to
encode uninterrupted ORFs. The conservation of relatively long ORFs suggests that they may have evolved
under functional constraints since integration. While
intact ORFs could also reflect recent insertion rather
than functional maintenance in a long-standing history
within the host genome. Analysis of transcription products can provide stronger evidence of functional maintenance. Accordingly, we used putative amino acid
sequences of endogenous viral sequences to search
NCBI Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) database for the
corresponding mRNAs with the tBLASTn program.
Through subsequent sequence comparisons, it was clear
that some endogenous viral sequences are expressed as
mRNAs in host genomes because they share high
sequence identity with most of their ESTs and adjacent
host sequences over full-length sequences (Figure 6 and
Additional file 2: Tabular data S4). Interestingly, ESTs
related to endogenous viral sequences of the rice blast
fungus M. oryzae and two roundworm species were
found in related species whose genome sequences are
not currently available, suggesting that there were

similarly expressed insertions in these species. In fact,
we have also amplified these virus-like sequences from
different strains of the rice blast fungus and detected
their expression (data not shown).
The fact that endogenous viral sequences are conserved and expressed in host organisms suggests that
these viral genes have been coopted to assume cellular
functions in eukaryotic genomes. It should be noted
that expression of mRNA from endogenous viral
sequences was also detected in the parasitic protozoan

E. histolytica, although their long ORFs were defective
(Figure 6). Perhaps selection to maintain these viral
sequences has recently been lost.
We also detected endogenous viral sequence-related
ESTs in some plants and animal species (see Additional
file 2: Tabular data S5). Because the genome sequences
of relevant host species are not available or available but
not well matched with their ESTs, it remains to be
established whether they represent authentic expressed
endogenous viral sequences.

The host range of circular ssDNA viruses

Circoviruses are previously known to infect only birds
and pigs [46]. These viruses have been detected in dragonflies, fish and human most recently [47-49]. Geminiviruses and nanoviruses only have been found to infect
higher plants [23,50]. Recent metagenomic studies
uncovered that these circular ssDNA viruses were commonly found in various environmental samples, but it is
difficult to provide information on the host range and
ecology for these viruses.
The endogenous circovirus-like sequences in honeybee
mite were most closely related to cycloviruses (Additional file 1: Figure S4), members of a recently proposed
genus in the family Circoviridae, which were commonly
found in faecal samples of human and chimpanzee by
viral metagenomics [20]. In addition, the endogenous
virus-like sequences from some species of various
organisms (such as amphibians, algae, diatom, gastropod, etc.) were clustered with viral metagenomic
sequences or circovirus-like genomes identified from
environmental samples [18]. These findings suggest that
these various species are the definitive hosts of relevant
environmental viruses.

Altogether, we discovered endogenous ssDNA viruslike sequences in host species broadly distributed in
four of the five supergroups of eukaryotes [51], namely
Unikonta (including animals, fungi and Entamoeba),
Plantae (including land plants and green algae), Chromalveolata (including diatoms and Blastocystis) and
Excavata (including Giardia) (Figure 7). The endogenous viral sequences identified here as molecular fossil
records of past viral invasions provide unambiguous
definitive hosts for these viruses and extend the host
range of circular ssDNA viruses.
Interestingly, although the endogenous circovirus/
nanovirus-like sequences occurred widely in the genomes of eukaryotic species, ranging from unicellular
organisms to mammals, we did not detect any of these
sequences in plant, bird and pig genomes sequenced todate. In contrast, the nematodes (roundworms) were not
known to be infected by ssDNA virus, but endogenous
circovirus-like sequences occurred in some nematode
species. In addition, geminivirus-like sequences were
found in some fungal genomes. So far, however no
genetically related exogenous counterparts were found
in these fungi, even though some of these, such as the

geminiviruses but harbored one endogenous geminiviral
sequence. These observations suggest that some of the

endogenous viral sequences could provide immune protection in the host similar to the endogenous retroviral
capsid proteins in mice and sheep, which offer protection against exogenous retroviral infections [52,53].

The origin and evolution of circoviruses and nanoviruses

The origin and evolution of geminiviruses

Based on the different phylogenies between the N-terminal and the C-terminal regions of circovirus Rep, Gibbs
and Weiller [54] suggested that circovirus Rep proteins
may have evolved by a recombination event between the
Rep protein of nanoviruses and an RNA binding protein
encoded by picorna-like viruses after the nanoviruses
switched hosts to infect a vertebrate. However, it seems
unlikely that the virus recombination event took place
in a vertebrate considering the fact that endogenous circovirus-like sequences were widely found in nonvertebrate species. To examine more thoroughly the origin
and evolution of circoviruses and nanoviruses, we
selected representative Rep-like proteins from viruses,
plasmids and bacterial genomes and used sufficient samples to construct phylogenetic trees. In consideration of
a possible recombination event, we aligned and performed phylogenetic analysis corresponding to fulllength Rep genes, the N-terminal and C-terminal
regions respectively. As shown in Additional file 2: Figure S8, circovirus-like sequences and viral Rep-like
sequences from bacterial plasmid and bacterial genomes
clustered together in all trees. However, while nanovirus-like sequences clustered with circovirus-like
sequences in the N-terminal tree they were grouped
with geminivirus-like sequences in the C-terminal tree.
In the full-length Rep tree, nanovirus-like sequences
were placed between the geminivirus-like and circovirus-like sequences, possibly due to the compromise of
different phylogenetic signals from the two parts of
nanovirus-like Reps. Therefore, if a recombination event
had occurred, it is likely to have taken place in the
nanovirus-like Reps rather than in the circovirus-like
Reps.
It has been proposed that eukaryotic ssDNA viruses
may have evolved from prokaryotic plasmids or phages
[31]. In our phylogenetic trees, the virus-like sequences
from bacterial plasmid and bacterial genomes were generally located at the base of circovirus-like sequences,
suggesting that circoviruses might have originated from
relevant bacterial plasmids. Considering that the nanovirus-like sequences clustered with circovirus-like
sequences in the N-terminal tree, it is most likely that
the nanoviruses shared the most recent common ancestor with circovirus-like viruses and subsequently the Cterminal sequences of ancestor nanoviral Reps may have
recombined with those of geminivirus-like viruses or
plasmids. But the possibility that nanovirus-like Reps
were the result of convergent evolution cannot be ruled
out. The Canarypox virus and the ancestor of picornalike viruses may have captured the helicase domain
sequences from circovirus-like viruses by recombination.

Based on the observations that geminiviruses occupied a
common ecological niche with phytoplasmas and their
Reps shared a most recent common ancestor with phytoplasmal plasmids in phylogenetic analysis, Krupovic et
al [55] proposed that the geminiviruses may have originated from phytoplasmal plasmid followed by acquisition of the capsid gene from an ssRNA plant virus.
However, in view of the recent reports on the geminivirus-like mycovirus and numerous related sequences in
fungal genomes, the evolutionary relationships among
these geminivirus-like elements need to be revaluated.
To address this question, we constructed phylogenetic
trees for the representative Rep-like proteins from
plants, fungi, phytoplasma and algae using the fulllength Rep genes, the N-terminal RCR catalytic domain
and C-terminal helicase domain sequences respectively
(Additional file 2: Figure S9). In all trees, the plant
geminiviral Reps clustered together with fungal Reps,
suggesting that they shared a more recent common
ancestor with those from fungi rather than from phytoplasmal plasmids. Furthermore, although the Rep protein of SsHADV-1 is related to geminiviruses, the
genome organization of SsHADV-1 and particle morphology is distinct from those of geminiviruses [42].
Although the capsid protein of SsHADV-1 lacks
sequence similarity with those of any geminiviruses, its
most similar sequences are commonly found in environmental samples. In addition, sequences related to
SsHADV-1 were widely found in fungal genomes and
diverse metagenomic samples. These results suggest
that SsHADV-1 and related viruses from fungi and
environment may have evolved independently rather
than being descendent from geminiviruses or vice versa.
Therefore, it is possible that the ancestor of geminiviruses and related fungal viruses may have occurred
prior to the separation of plants and fungi, and subsequently perhaps they had a unique path to evolution in
their hosts.

Conclusions
Our study provided comprehensive and convincing evidence that the genes of small circular ssDNA viruses
have been transferred into a broad range of eukaryotic
genomes, and some of the transferred genes were also
conserved and functional in host genomes. This discovery extends the host range of circular ssDNA viruses
and offers insight into the origin and evolution of relevant viruses. Furthermore, our finding also revealed that
the capture and functional assimilation of exogenous
viral genes may represent an important force in the evolution of eukaryotes.

Methods

Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis

Genome screening

The putative peptides of endogenous viral sequences
were obtained according to BLASTx hits and manual
editing. The in-frame stop codons were indicated as X.
Multiple alignments of protein sequences were constructed either using MCOFFEE (when the number of
sequences < 50) [56] or using COBALT [57] (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/cobalt/cobalt.cgi?link_loc=BlastHomeAd) and manually edited. To give the best
alignment, the alignment parameter Constraint E-value
and Word Size were adjusted for different datasets
when using COBALT. Although many of the endogenous viral sequences are of different lengths in alignments, it is now well known that sequences of very
different lengths can be accurately placed on phylogenies [58]. Hence, all the putative peptides of endogenous
viral sequences were used for the phylogenetic analysis
with proteins of representative exogenous viruses to
determine the full-scale evolutionary relationships
among them. Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies
were estimated using amino acid sequence alignments
with PhyML-mixtures [59,60], assuming the EX2 mixture model [60] and SPR tree topologies search strategy
[61]. Gaps in alignment are systematically treated as
unknown characters. The reliability of internal branches
was evaluated based on approximate likelihood ratio test
(aLRT) statistics [62].

In order to screen for the circular ssDNA virus-related
sequences in eukaryotic genomes, we performed
tBLASTn searches against different NCBI sequence
databases (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) using
as queries the representative peptide sequences derived
from viruses in families Anelloviridae, Circoviridae,
Geminiviridae and Nanoviridae. NCBI databases used
for sequence searches included nr (all GenBank +
RefSeq Nucleotides + EMBL + DDBJ + PDB sequences
+ HTGS phase 3 but excluding HTGS phase 0,1,2,
EST, GSS, STS, PAT, WGS), refseq_genomic (genomic
entries from NCBIâs Reference Sequence project),
NCBI Genomes/chromosome (a database with complete genomes and chromosomes from the NCBI
Reference Sequence project), wgs (a database for whole
genome shotgun sequence entries), gss (Genome Survey Sequence, includes single-pass genomic data, exontrapped sequences, and Alu PCR sequences), htgs
(unfinished High Throughput Genomic Sequences:
phases 0, 1 and 2), and the eukaryotes genomic
BLAST database. All non-redundant matches from
these searches with E-values â¤1e-5 were extracted
along with 1 kb of flanking regions, and then were
used to screen the non-redundant (NR) protein database using BLASTx. All genomic sequences from host
genomes that unambiguously matched viral proteins
were considered as candidate endogenous viral
sequences. These candidate endogenous viral
sequences were used to research the databases for
other homologous sequences that would have been
missed during initial searches using the known extant
viruses. All database searches were performed online
and were completed in June 2010.
Examining possible chimeras or errors in assembling of
endogenous viral sequences

To rule out the possibility that these endogenous viral
sequences were chimeric clones or misassembled
from contaminated sequences of exogenous incidental
viral sequences, we searched against archival data of
the eukaryotic genome sequencing using their endogenous viral sequences and flanking cellular
sequences as megaBLAST queries on the NCBI Trace
Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/mmtrace.
shtml) with the cut-off value: > 95% nt identity,
respectively; and carefully examined the junctions
between endogenous viral sequences and cellular
sequences. The statistics of junction coverages that
show the number of trace records containing the
junctions between endogenous viral sequences and
cellular sequences are listed in Additional file 2: Tabular data S2.

Detection of expression of endogenous viral sequences
from host genomes

To investigate whether endogenous viral sequences
could be expressed in host genomes, we first, used the
endogenous viral sequences to screen the NCBI EST
database using the method described in Genome screening. Subsequently, we used the identified virus-related
ESTs to compare with host genomes and virus genomes
by megaBLAST to determine whether they were
expressed sequences from host genomes or the result of
laboratory contamination.
PCR amplification and DNA sequencing

Genomic DNA samples of dog (Canis lupus familiaris)
and cat (Felis catus) were obtained from Zyagen Laboratories (USA). To PCR amplify the candidate DNA fragments from these DNA samples, primers pairs were
designed based on the virus-like sequences and their
flanking cellular sequences, see Additional file 3: Table
S1 for the primers pairs used. PCR products were fractionated by gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and
stained with ethidium bromide. DNA was sequenced by
Sanger methods at the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI).
New sequences generated in this study were deposited
in the GenBank under accession numbers: JF414126JF414131.
