degradome provides new insights into evolution of
proteases in birds and mammals

Abstract
Background: The degradome -the complete repertoire of proteases in an organism- is involved in multiple key
biological and pathological processes. Previous studies in several organisms have yielded sets of curated protease
sequences which may be used to characterize the degradome in a novel genome by similarity. Differences between
degradomes can then be related to physiological traits of the species under study. Therefore, the sequencing of the
zebra finch genome allows the comparison between the degradomes of mammals and birds and may help to
understand the biological peculiarities of the zebra finch.
Results: A set of curated protease sequences from humans and chicken was used to predict the sequences of 460
protease and protease-like genes in the zebra finch genome. This analysis revealed important differences in the
evolution of mammalian and bird degradomes, including genomic expansions and deletions of caspases, cytotoxic
proteases, kallikreins, matrix metalloproteases, and trypsin-like proteases. Furthermore, we found several zebra finchspecific features, such as duplications in CASP3 and BACE, and a large genomic expansion of acrosin.
Conclusions: We have compared the degradomes of zebra finch, chicken and several mammalian species, with the
finding of multiple differences which illustrate the evolution of the protease complement of these organisms. Detailed
analysis of these changes in zebra finch proteases has shown that they are mainly related to immunological,
developmental, reproductive and neural functions.
Background
The degradome is defined as the set of proteases present
in an organism [1]. The coining of this term reflects the
enormous biological and pathological relevance of proteolysis that pervades virtually every aspect of life, including development, apoptosis, host defense, nutrition,
reproduction and central nervous system biology [2].
From a genomic perspective, the degradome provides a
relatively simple representative subset of the coding
genome of a species. Thus, the human degradome contains about 570 proteases, and can be studied with semiautomated methods. On the other hand, and despite proteases share a common biochemical function, their catalytic domains exhibit high sequence diversity. This

diversity is further increased by the frequent attachment
of auxiliary, non-proteolytic domains to the catalytic
moieties [3]. It is also remarkable that while some of the
protease genes are clustered, most of them are randomly
distributed throughout the annotated genomes [4-7].
Hence, the degradome forms a representative subset of
the coding genome of a species, both in terms of
sequence and genomic organization.
Furthermore, since the role of multiple proteases in
biological processes is well documented, the comparative
study of degradomes may improve our understanding of
these processes in different organisms. The zebra finch
(Taeniopygia guttata) is a bird which has been extensively
used as a model organism for neurological [8], reproductive [9], and immune [10] studies. Therefore, the characterization of the zebra finch degradome may provide
valuable information on the role of proteases in key biological processes.

In this work, we report the analysis of the complete set
of protease and protease-like genes in the zebra finch
genome and its comparison to the chicken and human
degradomes. Where appropriate, other mammalian
degradomes have also been considered to expand the
scope of this protease-based comparative genomic analysis.

Results and Discussion
As expected, we have found that the zebra finch degradome is similar to the chicken degradome. According to
our preliminary prediction, the zebra finch and chicken
degradomes contain about 460 proteases. Reciprocal best
hit analysis of these results with the Ensembl predicted
protein complement of chicken showed that 380 zebra
finch proteases have a reciprocal best hit orthologue in
the chicken degradome. In contrast, 80 predicted zebra
finch proteases have no clear orthologue in chicken. Most
of these proteases belong to large complex families, in
which orthology assignment is difficult to establish. It
must also be noted that gene gains and losses may be confused with lack of genomic data and assembly artefacts.
However, some of these zebra finch specific proteases
seem to have clearly arisen from species-specific duplications.
Comparison of these degradomes with the human
degradome has yielded further information about the
evolution of proteases and has led to hypothesis about
their putative roles in zebra finch physiology. Thus, most
of the major differences characteristic of the zebra finch
and chicken degradomes compared to mammalian degradomes affect proteases involved in a few key biological
processes, including apoptosis, host defense, teeth formation, reproduction, and neural development.

On the other hand, the degradomes of zebra finch and
chicken contain several caspases which are not present in
humans [12] (Figure 1). Thus, CASP18 is present in both
birds. The phylogenetic analysis of this gene is consistent
with the proposed evolutionary history of this gene,
which is present in opossum and absent in placental
mammals [12]. Another gene absent in mammals is
CASP17, which can be found in chicken. Surprisingly, we
have not found any orthologue of CASP17 in the zebra
finch genome. In contrast, there is evidence for a tandem
duplication of CASP3 in the zebra finch genome, but not
in the genomes of chicken or human. Taken together,
these results suggest that the mechanisms leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis in birds might depend on
more proteases than in mammals. In fact, the evolution
of caspases in mammals includes complex events, like the
pseudogenization of CASP12 in most of the human population but not in other hominoids [13]. These changes
may influence processes such as immune system maturation and inflammatory response. In this regard, it is note-

Apoptosis

The detailed comparative analysis of proteases involved
in apoptosis has revealed a series of zebra finch and avian
characteristic features. Thus, group I caspases, involved
in the processing of inflammatory cytokines, is composed
of CASP1, -4, -5, and -12 in humans [11] and only one
(CASP1) in chicken. We have not found any sequence
corresponding to group I caspases in the current assembly of zebra finch nor in zebra finch ChrUn assembly or
sequence traces, nor in EST databases. However, the
genomic contig in which this sequence should be located
is rich in unsequenced stretches. Since this protease is
expected to play a very important role in apoptosis
induced by bacterial infections, it seems likely that the
gene encoding caspase-1 exists in an unsequenced stretch
of the zebra finch genome. Nevertheless, further experimental validation will be necessary to clarify this important question.

worthy that recent data have indicated that blocking
caspase-mediated apoptosis reduces neurogenesis in the
song nucleus of a bird [14].
Host defense

Proteases play important roles in the immune defense
against pathogens by acting as cytotoxic agents or by contributing to processes of activation and proliferation of
immune cells. The pressure of pathogens on the evolution of the immune system has likely led to marked differences in these proteases between birds and mammals.
Immune cytotoxic proteases are serine proteases stored
in the granules of neutrophils, mast cells, and natural
killer lymphocytes and released upon activation. Once
released, these proteases promote apoptosis of infected
cells [15]. In humans, the genes encoding cytotoxic proteases are clustered in three genomic loci. The first cluster contains the genes encoding granzymes A (GZMA)
and K (GZMK). As shown in Figure 2, GZMK is absent in
the genomes of zebra finch and chicken, whereas GZMA
is conserved in both birds. The second human cluster
contains neutrophil elastase (ELA2), complement factor
D (DF), azurocidin (AZU1), and proteinase 3 (PRTN3).

This cluster seems to be lacking in both zebra finch and
chicken (Figure 2). Finally, the third human cluster contains granzyme B (GZMB), granzyme H (GZMH), cathepsin G (CTSG), and chymase (CMA1). The genomes of
both zebra finch and chicken contain a single protease
gene related to all four human proteases, which we have
named GZMZ. Notably, this protease has been duplicated in the zebra finch. The resulting novel zebra finchspecific granzyme (GZMZL) is classified as a non-peptidase homolog, lacking proteolytic capabilities, since its
sequence features two substitutions at key catalytic residues. It should be noted that the most abundant granzymes in humans are A and B, which cause caspaseindependent and caspase-dependent apoptosis, respectively. Therefore, this analysis predicts that avian granzyme A and granzyme Z may play complementary roles
in the cytotoxic immune response. If expressed, granzyme Z-like might modulate the activity of granzyme Z
by sequestering its substrates or inhibitors. Furthermore,
it has been suggested that some of these granzymes
absent in birds induce cell death by mitochondrial or
autophagy-related pathways [16].
On the other hand, human cysteine protease paracaspase (MALT1) has been shown to modulate T-cell activation [17]. Our analysis has uncovered the zebra finch and
chicken orthologues of MALT1, along with two additional paracaspase-like genes in zebra finch and chicken,
which are not present in human. The phylogenetic analysis of caspases suggests that the common ancestor to
mammals and birds had three copies of MALT1, two of
which were lost in mammals (Figure 1). This result is supported by the finding of three MALT1-like genes in Tetraodon nigroviridis (CAG08114.1, CAG07960.1, and
CAG13116.1).
Taken together, these results suggest that the mammalian granzyme clusters constitute an evolutionary
response to special immune challenges, and that the cytotoxic immune response in humans proceeds through
more diverse cellular pathways than the corresponding
response in birds. In contrast, immune cell activation
dependent on paracaspases, might involve more proteases in birds than in mammals.

Teeth formation

Absence of teeth is a specific feature of birds and adult
monotremes. The analysis of avian degradomes shows
that both zebra finch and chicken lack two protease genes
involved in teeth formation, namely the genes encoding
enamelysin (MMP20) and kallikrein-4 (KLK4) [18-20].
While KLK4 is absent in both bird genomes, along with
the rest of the kallikrein family of serine proteases, a
pseudogene resembling MMP20 can be found in a syntenic locus in the chicken genome, but not in the zebra
finch genome. Both proteases cleave several enamel pro-

Quesada et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:220
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/220

teins necessary for enamel formation in all dentate vertebrates.
Likewise, orthologues of human enamel matrix protein
genes (AMBN, AMELX, and ENAM) are absent from
avian genomes. In contrast, other non-dentate vertebrates, like platypus, contain orthologues of these genes.
This may reflect the fact that, unlike birds, young monotremes display rudimentary teeth. Other genes involved
in teeth and bone development are also absent in chicken
and zebra finch genomes, including the genes encoding
matrix extracellular phosphoprotein (MEPE) and dentine-sialophosphoprotein (DSPP). Therefore, teeth loss in
birds seems to have proceeded through multiple gene
losses, including proteases and protease substrates.
Reproduction

One of the most dissimilar processes between birds and
mammals is reproduction. Consistent with this, we have
found multiple differences in protease genes involved in
fecundation and embryo hatching. Thus, no orthologues
of testin serine proteases were found in chicken or zebra
finch. In mammals, testins have been linked to spermatogenesis based on localization studies [21]. Testin genes
have followed diverse evolutionary patterns, with
pseudogenization events in some primates and rodents
[4-6]. This suggests that testins might be related to reproductive fitness or even to speciation specifically in mammals. Likewise, several members of the ADAM family of
metalloproteases involved in fertilization in mammals are
lacking in the genomes of both birds. These include
ADAMs 1-7 and ADAM30. In contrast, other members of
this family not involved in reproductive processes are
conserved. Notably, a family of two pregnancy-associated
plasma metalloproteases, pappalysin-1 and -2 (PAPPA1
and PAPPA2), seem to be perfectly conserved in birds.
Pappalysins are known to cleave IGF-binding proteins
(IGFBPs), and overexpression of PAPPA2 is related to
severe preeclampsia in humans [22]. This result suggests
that IGFBP proteases may play a conserved role in pregnancy both in birds and mammals.
On the other hand, acrosin, a serine protease located in
the sperm acrosome and involved in the lysis of the zona
pellucida to facilitate sperm penetration in the ovum, is
conserved in birds and mammals [23]. Strikingly, while
the genomes of humans and chickens contain a single
acrosin gene (ACR), the zebra finch genome contains 7
non-clustered ACR-like genes. These include a non-peptidase homolog, named ACR1, featuring mutations in all
three catalytic residues. Since no orthologues of these
novel genes have been found in other organisms, ACRlike genes are likely to be due to zebra finch-specific
genomic expansions. As shown in Figure 3, some of these
zebra finch-specific acrosin-like genes, especially ACR5,
seem to have undergone non-neutral evolution, likely

reflecting reproductive pressures. However, we cannot
rule out the possibility of an ancestral genomic expansion
of ACR followed by loss of the novel genes in several species. The substrates of acrosin are called zona pellucida
proteins or ZPs. The human genome encodes four ZP
proteins, whereas the chicken genome encodes six ZP
family members and the zebra finch genome seven ZPs,
due to the specific duplication of ZPAX [24].
Consistent with the important differences in reproduction between birds and mammals after fertilization, proteases involved in implantation in mammals and hatching
are not conserved. Thus, we have found no evidence of
zebra finch or chicken proteases related to murine
implantation serine proteases (ISPs), which have been
shown to participate in embryo implantation and may be
involved in embryo hatching [25]. Furthermore, the gene
encoding mammalian ovastacin, a metalloprotease which
may be involved in embryo hatching [26], is absent in
zebra finch and chicken. In contrast, we have found two
zebra finch proteases related to fish choryolytic enzymes,
which may fulfill this role in embryo hatching. Finally, our
analysis has revealed features specific of eutherian organ-

Quesada et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:220
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/220

isms. Thus, the alpha-aspartyl dipeptidase gene (PEPE),
conserved in bacteria, vertebrates, and invertebrates, is
present both in zebra finch and chicken, but not in eutherians. Likewise, the gene encoding the aspartyl protease
known as nothepsin (NOTS) is present in both birds as
well as in fish, reptilia and platypus but has been pseudogenized in metatherians and eutherians. Interestingly,
both PEPE and NOTS are highly expressed in reproductive organs of different species. This suggests that the
inactivation of these genes, with the concomitant expansion of other protease families, may have played a role in
the striking reproductive differences between oviparous
and viviparous species.
Taken together, these data show that the profound differences in the reproductive function between birds and
mammals are related to multiple gene gain and loss
events. Our results suggest that the evolutionary pressure
on the reproductive function has driven the expansion of
the acrosin family of serine proteases in zebra finch, but
not in chicken or mammals. This abrupt change in genes
involved in reproduction could potentially lead to reproductive barriers and thus play an important role in speciation.
Neural development

The zebra finch is an interesting model of neural development. As noted above, the zebra finch genome features a
zebra finch-specific CASP3 duplication. This event may
have important consequences in neural development
regardless of the role of this protease in apoptosis. In fact,
recent studies have shown that zebra finch CASP3 plays a
dynamic role in song-response habituation, and therefore
is involved in learning and memory [27]. It is important
to notice that this result requires experimental validation,
since tandem duplication can be mimicked by artifacts in
the genomic assembly. Notably, we have found embryo
EST sequences corresponding to both CASP3 copies. On
the other hand, an independent CASP3 duplication has
been shown in opossum [12].
Additionally, we have found a zebra finch-specific tandem duplication of the gene encoding the aspartyl protease β-secretase 1 (BACE). Strikingly, both CASP3 and
BACE have been shown to play a role in αβ peptide accumulation in Alzheimer disease [28]. Since this role is
related to β-secretase, it is tempting to speculate that βsecretase activity and regulation in birds may be influenced by these novel copies of CASP3 and BACE.
Finally, our analysis suggests that the gene encoding the
serine protease neurotrypsin (PRSS12) was duplicated in
an ancestor of birds and mammals, and then one copy
was lost in the mammalian lineage (data not shown).
Neurotrypsin has been linked to neural development in
multiple organisms. Thus, a 4 bp deletion in human
PRSS12 mRNA is believed to cause mental retardation

Page 5 of 9

[29]. Likewise, a Drosophila melanogaster strain lacking
the orthologue of neurotrypsin has been shown to suffer
a long-term memory formation defect [30].
Collectively, these results show several putative duplication events in protease genes involved in neural development. This suggests that gene gain by genomic
duplication may underlie some of the differences in neural development between zebra finch and chicken.
Differences in other proteases

Additional features of the zebra finch degradome may
provide clues about the evolution of the zebra finch
genome compared to other birds and mammals. Thus,
the human genome encodes 24 matrix metalloprotease
(MMP) genes, involved in multiple biological processes,
including development and tissue remodeling [31].
Inspection of the chicken and zebra finch genomes shows
that the number of MMPs is much lower, with 16 members each, due to the lack of MMP-7, -8, -19, -20, -21, 23B, -25, and -26. These dissimilar MMP gene sets might
underlie some of the differences in bone and cartilage
biology or in other tissue-remodelling events between
birds and mammals.
Furthermore, while most of the genes in the ADAMTS
metalloprotease family are perfectly conserved between
zebra finch, chicken, and human, ADAMTS13 seems to
have been specifically duplicated in zebra finch. It is
remarkable that this gene has been related to a human
disease called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
[32]. This disease causes hemolytic anemia with fragmentation of erythrocytes, thrombocytopenia, diffuse and
nonfocal neurologic findings, and decreased renal function. Notably, two members of this family present in
humans are lacking in birds. These are ADAMTS16,
expressed in pre-ovulatory ovarian follicules [33] and
linked to inherited hypertension [34], and ADAMTS4,
which encodes a protease involved in aggrecan degradation and may play a role in the development of osteoarthritis [35]. This suggests that, in birds, other
aggrecanases, like ADAMTS-5, fulfill the tasks that
ADAMTS-4 performs in mammals.
Finally, the differences in the diets of birds and mammals seem to have prompted the remodelling of the pepsinogen system. Thus, while the human genome contains
three pepsinogen A (PGA) genes in tandem, birds possess
two PGA genes duplicated independently. Furthermore,
while the chicken genome contains an ortholog of human
pepsinogen C (PGC), the zebra finch genome seems to be
lacking this gene.
We have also found evidence for changes in multiple
protease genes which are currently being validated (Table
1). Our ongoing studies on these genes may extend the
list of differences in the degradomes of zebra finch,
chicken, and humans.

Conclusions
In summary, the analysis of the zebra finch degradome
and its comparison with those of other birds and mammals may prove useful in the identification of molecular
mechanisms which underlie physiological differences
between these organisms. Thus, we have identified
changes in protease-coding genes such as caspases, granzymes, acrosins, metalloproteases, and pepsinogens,
which might underlie differences in apoptosis, immune
system, bone and teeth development, and reproduction.
This approach has also allowed us to generate hypothesis
about the role of several proteolytic systems in the striking differences in neural development between zebra
finch and other birds. In this regard, we have found zebra
finch-specific duplications in protease genes involved in
neural development, namely CASP3 and BACE. We
expect that these results may contribute to our better

understanding of avian biology and zebra finch characteristic traits.

Methods
Identification and annotation of zebra finch proteases

To annotate the set of zebra finch proteases, we downloaded the zebra finch genomic sequence deposited in the
Genome Center at Washington University, in the context
of the Zebra Finch Sequencing and Analysis Consortium
(Zebra Finch Sequencing and Analysis Consortium: The
genome sequence of the vocal learning zebra finch, submitted). Protease sequences were found and curated with
the BATI algorithm (Blast, Annotate, Tune, Iterate), using
four in-house Perl scripts: Tbex, BlastSniffer, GeneTuner,
and BGmix http://degradome.uniovi.es/downloads. We
started with a previously assembled set including curated
human [6] and chicken http://www.ensembl.org protease

sequences. Each protein sequence in this starting set was
compared to the genomic sequence of zebra finch using
the TBLASTN program of the BLAST suite [36] with
Tbex. Putative orthologues of the starting genes were
located with BlastSniffer and curated with GeneTuner. To
minimize the number of missed protease genes, a composite file with all of the TBLASTN hits sorted by chromosomal location was also generated with BGmix and
inspected. Prediction of chicken and human orthologues
was performed by reciprocal best hit analysis. Information on the degradomes of other mammalian species was
retrieved from the Degradome database http://degradome.uniovi.es.

Phylogenetic analysis

In those cases where orthology could not be established
by reciprocal best hit analysis, phylogenetic studies were
conducted. Protein sequences were aligned with ClustalX
[37] and manually edited with Genedoc http://
www.nrbsc.org/gfx/genedoc/index.html. Then, alignments were bootstrapped 100 times with Seqboot and
most parsimonious trees were generated with Protpars,
both from the Phylip package http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html. Trees were displayed
with TreeView [37]. Only nodes present in more than 50
bootstrapped trees were displayed.
