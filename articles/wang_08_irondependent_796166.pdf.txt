Abstract
Background: Iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2), a post-transcriptional regulator of cellular iron
metabolism, undergoes iron-dependent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. A
stretch of 73 amino acids within the N-terminal domain 1 of the protein was reported to function
as an iron sensor. However, mutants lacking this fragment remain sensitive to degradation in ironreplete cells.
Results: To identify elements within IRP2 involved in the control of its stability, we undertook a
systematic mutagenesis approach. Truncated versions of IRP2 were expressed in H1299 cells and
analyzed for their response to iron. Deletion mutants lacking the entire C-terminal domain 4
(amino acids 719–963) of IRP2 remained stable following iron treatments. Moreover, the
replacement of domain 4 of IRP1 with the corresponding region of IRP2 sensitized the chimerical
IRP11–3/IRP24 protein to iron-dependent degradation, while the reverse manipulation gave rise to
a stable chimerical IRP21–3/IRP14 protein. The deletion of just 26 or 34 C-terminal amino acids
stabilized IRP2 against iron. However, the fusion of C-terminal IRP2 fragments to luciferase failed
to sensitize the indicator protein for degradation in iron-loaded cells.
Conclusion: Our data suggest that the C-terminus of IRP2 contains elements that are necessary
but not sufficient for iron-dependent degradation. The functionality of these elements depends
upon the overall IRP structure.

Background
Iron regulatory proteins, IRP1 and IRP2, post-transcriptionally control the expression of several mRNAs bearing
iron responsive elements (IREs). In iron-deficient cells,
IRE/IRP interactions account for the stabilization of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) mRNA and the translational inhibition of ferritin (H- and L-) mRNAs, resulting in
increased uptake and reduced sequestration of iron [1].

IRPs regulate the expression of additional IRE-containing
transcripts, such as those encoding erythroid aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS2), mitochondrial aconitase, the iron
transporter ferroportin 1, myotonic dystrophy kinaserelated Cdc42-binding kinase α (MRCK α), hypoxia
inducible factor 2 α (HIF2α), and splice variants of the
divalent metal transporter DMT1 and the kinase Cdc14A
[2-4]. Experiments with IRP1-/- and IRP2-/- cells and ani-

mals revealed that IRP2 exerts a dominant regulatory
function in vivo [5].
Both IRP1 and IRP2 share significant sequence similarity
[1,2,5]. A major difference in their primary structure is
that IRP2 contains a unique insertion of 73 amino acids
close to its N-terminus (referred to hereafter as 73d). In
iron-replete cells, IRP1 binds a cubane 4Fe-4S cluster,
which precludes IRE-binding, renders the protein to a
cytosolic aconitase and maintains it in a closed conformation [6,7]. Under these conditions, IRP2 undergoes rapid
ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome
[1,2,5]. Phosphorylation or defects in Fe-S cluster assembly may also sensitize IRP1 to iron-dependent proteasomal degradation, albeit with slower kinetics compared to
IRP2 [8-10].
The mechanism for IRP2 degradation is far from being
understood. It has been proposed that the 73d functions
as an "iron-dependent degradation domain". One model
postulates that the iron-sensing capacity of the 73d is
based on site-specific oxidation of conserved cysteine residues upon direct iron binding [11]. Another model suggests that IRP2 degradation is triggered by oxidative
modification following high affinity binding of heme
within the 73d [12,13]. Nevertheless, experiments in cultured cells showed that IRP2 deletion mutants lacking the
entire 73d remain as sensitive to iron as wild type IRP2
[14-16]. Moreover, the 73d failed to destabilize GFP
fusion indicator constructs in iron-loaded cells [15], casting further doubt on its proposed function as a necessary
and sufficient regulatory element for IRP2 degradation.
Recent results showed that 73d is sensitive to proteolytic
cleavage and that heme binding only occurs in its truncated form [17].
IRP2 is stabilized in response to hypoxia [14,18,19], by
analogy to HIF α subunits that play a crucial role in cellular adaptation to low oxygen levels [20]. Under normoxic
conditions, HIF α subunits undergo post-translational
modification by the prolyl-hydroxylases PHD1–3, which
tag them for ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase
VHL and degradation by the proteasome [21]. These
enzymes, as well as other 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, catalyze the hydroxylation of protein substrates
by using 2-oxoglutarate. The reaction yields a hydroxylated amino acid, succinate and carbon dioxide, and proceeds via an iron-oxo intermediate [22]. The availability
of ferrous iron, oxygen and ascorbate (presumably to
maintain iron in a reduced state) is critical for catalysis.
Experimental evidence supports a mechanism for IRP2
degradation via 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases.
Thus, dimethyl-oxalyl-glycine (DMOG), a substrate analogue of 2-oxoglutarate, protected IRP2 against iron-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/15

dependent degradation [14,15]. Furthermore, ascorbate
and other antioxidants accelerated the degradation of
IRP2 [15]. Nevertheless, the protective effect of DMOG
was restricted to cells that were previously depleted from
iron by the chelator desferrioxamine, indicating that the
iron-dependent degradation of IRP2 is mediated by multiple mechanisms. One of them appears to interfere with
the heme biosynthetic pathway, as succinyl-acetone, an
inhibitor of endogenous heme synthesis, stabilized IRP2
against iron [23]; this result has independently been
reproduced in various laboratories [13,16,19,24]. The E3
ubiquitin ligases VHL [25] and HOIL-1 [26] are not
required for IRP2 degradation in response to iron.
To identify structural elements within IRP2 that may play
a role in iron sensing and in the regulation of its stability,
we undertook a systematic deletion analysis. Our data
suggest that C-terminal sequences are necessary for the
iron-dependent degradation of IRP2. However, these
sequences only operate in a context of IRP structure and
do not have intrinsic iron sensing properties.

Results
The C-terminal domain of IRP2 is necessary for its irondependent degradation
Even though the crystal structure of IRP2 has not yet been
solved, on the basis of IRP1 structural data [6,7] and
sequence homology between IRP1 and IRP2, it can be predicted that the IRP2 molecule is composed of three compact domains (1–3) linked to a fourth domain via a hinge
region (Fig. 1A). Having established that the IRP2-specific
73d is dispensable for iron-dependent degradation, at
least in the context of full-length IRP2 and GFP-fusion
indicator constructs [14-16], we reasoned that other
sequences within IRP2 might possess iron-sensing properties. To address this, we generated a series of IRP2 C-terminal deletion mutants, truncated at domains 2–4
(ΔD2,3,4), 3–4 (ΔD3,4), or 4 (ΔD4), and an N-terminal
deletion mutant, truncated at domain 1 (ΔD1). We also
generated variants of ΔD3,4 and ΔD4 IRP2 lacking the
73d region (ΔD3,4/-73d and ΔD4/-73d, respectively), to
reevaluate a possible regulatory function of this sequence
in the deletion mutants. All mutants (Fig. 1A) were transfected into H1299 cells for tetracycline-inducible expression. Several clones of IRP2 C-terminal deletion mutants
were isolated; however, no stable clone expressing ΔD1
IRP2 could be obtained. The cells were subjected to treatments with hemin or ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) to
analyze the response of the IRP2 deletion mutants to iron.
We employed clones with variable expression levels to
avoid possible confounding effects due to saturation of
the IRP2 degradation machinery [15]. Notably, in contrast
to wild type IRP2 (Fig. 1B), iron loading did not affect the
expression of any of the truncated IRP2 variants (Fig.
1C–G), even though these treatments are known to pro-

mote the degradation of wild type IRP2 [15,16]. These
data provide further evidence that the 73d is not crucial
for IRP2 degradation. As the minimal truncation of the Cterminal domain 4 appears sufficient for stabilization of
the remaining IRP2 polypeptide, these data also suggest
that this region may have a functional role in iron sensing.

The half-lives (t1/2) of the chimeric proteins were then
directly determined by pulse-chase experiments in the
absence or presence of FAC and compared to those of wild
type IRP1 and IRP2 (Fig. 3). Wild type IRP1 did not decay
over 11 h in control or iron-loaded cells (Fig. 3A), consistently with earlier observations [8-10] and references
therein]. By contrast, the FAC treatment dramatically
reduced the t1/2 of wild type IRP2 from ~5 to <2 h (Fig.
3B), again consistently with previous data [15] and references therein]. The presence of IRP2 domain 4 destabilized the IRP11–3-IRP24 chimera compared to wild type
IRP1 and, moreover, sensitized it to iron. Thus, the FAC
treatment further reduced its t1/2 from ~11 to ~6.5 h (Fig.
3C); this effect was statistically significant (p < 0.05). On
the other hand, domain 4 of IRP1 abolished the responsiveness of the IRP21–3-IRP14 chimera to iron and apparently accelerated its decay (t1/2 ~ 3 h) compared to wild
type IRP2 (Fig. 3D), possibly by dramatically altering its
overall structure. Taken together, these results substantiate
the necessity of IRP2 domain 4 in iron sensing and in the
targeting of the protein for degradation.

The C-terminal domain 4 of IRP2 sensitizes IRP11–3-IRP24
chimeras for iron-dependent degradation
To further evaluate the iron sensing capacity of the IRP2
C-terminus, we generated IRP1/IRP2 chimeras by swapping domains 4 between IRP1 and IRP2 (Fig. 2A). The
resulting IRP21–3-IRP14 and IRP11–3-IRP24 constructs were
transfected into H1299 cells and at least three clones with
variable expression levels were isolated and analyzed for
sensitivity to iron. While, as expected, the expression of
wild type IRP2 was diminished following treatment with
FAC (Fig. 2D, lanes 1–2), the replacement of its domain 4
with that of IRP1 rendered the IRP21–3-IRP14 chimera
resistant to iron (lanes 3–8). Furthermore, domain 4 of
IRP2 sufficed to decrease the expression of the IRP11–3IRP24 chimera in iron-loaded cells (Fig. 2E). Under these
conditions, wild type IRP1, as well as a ΔD4 IRP1 deletion
mutant (lacking the C-terminal domain 4), remained
unresponsive to iron treatments (Figs. 2B and 2C, respectively).

IRP2 (B), IRP11–3-IRP24 (C) or IRP21–3-IRP14 (D) were metabolically labeled for 2 h with 35S-methionine/cysteine. Subsequently,
the cells were chased for the indicated time intervals in cold media in the absence or presence of 30 μg/ml FAC. Cytoplasmic
lysates (500 μg) were subjected to quantitative immunoprecipitation with 1 μg HA (Santa Cruz) or FLAG (Sigma) antibodies.
Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% gel and visualized by autoradiography. The radioactive
bands were quantified by phosphorimaging. The percentage of residual radioactivity from three independent experiments
(mean ± SD) is plotted against time.

cline from cells expressing IRP11–3-IRP24 induced IRE/IRP
complex formation (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–2), indicating that
this chimerical protein retains IRE-binding activity. This
was verified by supershifting IRE/IRP11–3-IRP24 complexes with the HA antibody (lanes 3–4). The functional
implications of this interaction are illustrated in the

increased TfR1 levels in cells expressing IRP11–3-IRP24
(Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the replacement of IRP2 domain 4
with that of IRP1 abrogated the IRE-binding capacity of
the protein; thus, the IRP21–3-IRP14 chimera was inactive
in the binding assay and only IRE complexes with wild
type IRP2 could be supershifted with the HA antibody

(Fig. 4C). This is in agreement with the possibility that
this chimera may possess a distorted structure. As
expected, IRP21–3-IRP14 failed to stimulate the expression
of TfR1 (data not shown).
Truncation of the C-terminal domain 4 of IRP2 to identify
minimal iron-sensing sequences
The above data are consistent with an involvement of
IRP2 domain 4 in tagging the protein for proteasomal
degradation. To identify minimal requirements for this
activity, further deletion mutants within domain 4 were
generated, expressed in H1299 cells and analyzed for their
response to iron (Fig. 5). We first noticed that the ΔC168,
but also the ΔC60 deletion mutants remained stable in
iron-loaded cells (Figs. 5B–D), indicating that the
sequence encompassing the 60 C-terminal amino acids of
IRP2 may possess iron-sensing properties. To further
address this, we generated IRP2 variants lacking either the
34 C-terminal (ΔC34) or the adjacent 26 amino acids
(ΔC26). Both the ΔC34, as well as the ΔC26 deletion
mutants were resistant to iron-mediated degradation
(Figs. 5E and 5F).

Even though the peptides encompassing the 60 C-terminal amino acids of IRP1 and IRP2 are largely conserved
(Additional File 1A), they display notable differences and
cluster separately in a phylogenetic dendrogram (Additional File 1B). For example, the IRP2 C-terminus is serine-rich, whereas serines are completely absent from the
respective segment of mammalian IRP1s. We considered
IRP2-specific amino acids in this region as potential regu-

latory sites and hypothesized that their replacement with
IRP1-specific counterparts might confer an IRP1-like phenotype (stabilization in iron-loaded cells). Thus, we
focused on non-conserved amino acids that differ significantly (in terms of chemical side chains) between IRP2
and IRP1 and generated IRP2 variants with S929D, S939R
and L948Y IRP1-like point mutations. However, none of
these manipulations resulted in stabilization of the IRP2
mutants against iron (Additional File 1C).
A bona fide iron sensor would be expected to function not
only within IRP2, but also in the context of an unrelated
protein. To examine this, the region encompassing the Cterminal 60 or 168 amino acids of IRP2 was fused to luciferase indicator constructs (Fig. 6A) and expressed in
H1299 cells. However, none of the fusion proteins exhibited any susceptibility to iron loading, and remained stable following treatment of the cells with FAC (Figs. 6B and
6C). In control experiments, we observed that the expression of an unmodified luciferase indicator did not
respond to iron (data not shown). Thus, while the C-terminal IRP2 sequences are required for IRP2 degradation,
they fail to destabilize the luciferase indicator in response
to iron.

Discussion
The sensitivity of IRP2 to iron has been known for years
[27]. Nevertheless, the mechanism for its iron-dependent
degradation remains unresolved and, moreover, little
progress has been made towards identifying and characterizing IRP2 sequences with iron-sensing properties. The

IRP2 and the ΔC60 and ΔC168 deletion mutants is illustrated in (B).

IRP2-specific 73d has been proposed to function as an
iron sensor either via direct binding of iron to C168, C174
and C178 [11], or binding of heme to C168 [12] or C201
[13]. Nevertheless, several labs have demonstrated that
the above cysteine residues and the entire 73d are dispensable for IRP2 degradation in cultured cells [14,15,19],
even though published data with opposing views exist
[13]. We reasoned that an unbiased systematic deletion
analysis of IRP2 might shed light onto this issue and facilitate the identification of segments of the protein with
iron-sensing capacity in vivo. To this end, we generated
several IRP2 deletion mutants and transfected them into
H1299 cells for tetracycline-inducible expression. To
avoid saturation effects related to overexpression [15], we
selected and analyzed multiple clones with variable IRP2

expression levels for their response to iron treatment. We
were unable to isolate stable clones expressing the N-terminal deletion mutant ΔD1; the reason for this is unclear.
The truncation of IRP2 at its C-terminus was sufficient for
the stabilization of the protein in iron-loaded cells, independently of the presence or absence of 73d (Fig. 1).
These findings not only confirmed that 73d fails to function as an iron sensor in vivo, but also shifted our focus for
the identification of iron-sensing sequences to the C-terminal domain 4 of IRP2. Further support for the significance of this region in the control of IRP2 stability was
provided by experiments with IRP1/IRP2 chimeras, generated by swapping the domains 4 between these proteins
(Figs. 2, 3, 4). Thus, domain 4 of IRP2 accelerated the

decay of the IRP11-3-IRP24 chimera in iron-loaded cells
(Fig. 3C). The stability of ΔD4 IRP1 against iron (Fig. 2C)
denotes that this effect is not due to merely the loss of the
IRP1 C-terminal region. Along these lines, domain 4 of
IRP1 abolished the iron responsiveness of the IRP21–3IRP14 chimera (Fig. 3D). Collectively, these data suggest
that the C-terminus of IRP2 is necessary for its irondependent degradation. It should, however, be noticed
that the response of the IRP11–3-IRP24 chimera to iron was
modest, compared to wild type IRP2 (Fig. 3B), indicating
the involvement of additional IRP2 sequences, outside
domain 4, in controlling the rate of its degradation.

The iron-sensitive IRP11–3-IRP24 chimera retained RNAbinding activity (Fig. 4A) and was functional in regulating
downstream IRE-containing mRNA targets, as shown by
the increase in TfR1 expression (Fig. 4B). By contrast, the
apparently labile IRP21–3-IRP14 chimera was resistant to
iron and failed to bind RNA (Fig. 4C), raising the possibility that the iron responsiveness may be linked to the RNAbinding capacity. We did not directly address this issue;
nevertheless, the recent description of other iron-sensitive
IRP1/IRP2 chimeras that are inactive in RNA-binding suggests that this is not the case [28]. Considering that the
4Fe-4S cluster is necessary to maintain IRP1 in a compact
structure [6,7] and a failure to assemble it sensitizes the

protein for slow iron-dependent degradation [8-10], it
will be of interest to examine whether the chimerical proteins retain a capacity to assemble a 4Fe-4S cluster, and
whether this correlates with their responsiveness to iron.
In an attempt to narrow down the putative iron-sensing
region of IRP2, we further truncated domain 4 of the protein and established that the deletion of just small C-terminal segments abolished iron-dependent degradation of
IRP2 (Fig. 5). However, the fusion of 60 or 168 C-terminal
amino acids of IRP2 to luciferase failed to promote the
degradation of this chimerical protein in iron-loaded cells
(Fig. 6).
Conceivably, the observed stabilization of the IRP2 deletion mutants is related to a disruption of the overall IRP2
structure that may prevent the exposure of iron-sensing
regions. Alternatively, the C-terminal domain of IRP2
may contribute to an iron-dependent rearrangement of
the protein structure, which would render it more sensitive to proteolysis. In this scenario, the actual iron sensor
could be another factor, such as a proteolytic enzyme, that
may attack the destabilized protein upon activation by
iron.

Conclusion
Our results suggest that sequences within the C-terminus
of IRP2 are necessary, but not sufficient for iron-dependent degradation, at least outside an IRP context. Thus, the
C-terminus of IRP2 does not possess the properties of a
bona fide iron sensor but its regulatory function requires
IRP structural integrity and very likely additional elements
within other domains of IRP2 and/or other factors.

Methods
Materials
Hemin and ferric ammonium citrate were purchased from
Sigma (St. Louis, MI).
Construction of IRP2 mutants
IRP2 deletion or point mutants were generated from
either the pUHD-IRP2 or the pUHD-IRP2Δ73 plasmids
[15] with the ExSite mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The forward primer for PCR amplification to yield all C-terminal
deletion mutants was 5'-TACCCATACG ATGTTCCAGA
TT-3'. The reverse primers were: i) for ΔD4 and ΔD4/-73,
5'-TAAGTCCCAT GGAAACAAAA CT-3'; ii) for ΔD3,4 and
ΔD3,4/-73: 5'-TATTGAATTC AGATTAATCT GG-3'; iii) for
ΔD2,3,4: 5'-TAAAGTAAGA GAAACTGGCA GA-3'; iv) for
ΔC168: 5'-TGTCATTACA GCATCATTAC CT-3'; v) for
ΔC60: 5'-GCCCAAGGAA TCTGCATTTT CT-3'; and vi) for
ΔC34: 5'-GCTTGTCTGT ATATTCAATG TA-3'. The ΔD1
deletion mutant was generated with 5'-GAGGGATCCA
CCATGGGCCC AGAGGTGGTT GGATGT-3' (forward)
and 5'-GTGGCACGAA AATTCTCATA CCCATACGAT

GTTCCAGATT ACGCTTAGTA AGGATCCTAC G-3'
(reverse) primers. The ΔC26 deletion mutant was generated with 5'-ACTGGAAAAG TATTCAGCGT GA-3' (forward) and 5'-GCCCAAGGAA TCTGCATTTT CT-3'
(reverse) primers. IRP2 point mutants were generated
with following sets of primers: i) for S929D: 5'-AATATACAGA CAGATACTGG AAAAGTA-3' (forward) and 5'TACTTTTCCA GTATCTGTCT GTATATT-3' (reverse); ii) for
S939R: 5'-AGCGTGATTG CTCGATTTGA AGATGAT-3'
(forward)
and
5'-ATCATCTTCA
AATCGAGCAA
TCACGCT-3' (reverse); and iii) for L948Y: 5'TGGAAATAAC ATACTACAAA CATGGA-3' (forward) and
5'-TCCATGTTTG TAGTATGTTA TTTCCA-3' (reverse). To
generate the ΔD4 IRP1 deletion mutant, pUHD-IRP1 [29]
was digested with MscI/SnaBI (thereby excising domain
4) and religated.
Construction of IRP1/IRP2 chimeras
A hybrid molecule in which the domain 4 of IRP1 was
replaced by that of IRP2 (IRP11–3IRP24) was generated as
follows: The region spanning domains 1–3 of IRP1 was
PCR-amplified from pUHD-IRP1 [29] with 5'-AGTGTGGGAT CCTGTACAAC CAGG-3' (forward) and 5'-AGTGTGCTCG AGTGCCTGGA TCTCGTCTCT AGT-3'
(reverse) primers. Domain 4 of IRP2 was PCR-amplified
from pUHD-IRP2 with 5'-AGTGTGCTCG AGGAAGAACA
TGTTATA-3'
(forward)
and
5'-CGTAGGATCC
TTACTAAGCG TAATCTGGAA CATCGTATGG GTATGAGAAT TTTCGTGCCA C-3' (reverse) primers. Finally, the
two fragments were cloned into the BamH1 site of pUHDIRP1. Likewise, a hybrid molecule in which the domain 4
of IRP2 was replaced by that of IRP1 (IRP21–3IRP14) was
generated by PCR-amplification of the region spanning
domains 1–3 of IRP2 from pUHD-IRP2 with 5'-GCTCGAGGAT CCCATGGACG CCCC AAA-3' (forward) and 5'CTGACGCTCG AGTGCATGAA CTTCTTCTCG ACT-3'
(reverse) primers. Domain 4 of IRP1 was PCR-amplified
from pUHD-IRP1 with 5'-CAGGCACTCG AGCGTCAGTA
TGTCATC-3' (forward) and 5'-AGCGTAGGAT CCTTACTAAG CGTAATCTGG AACATCGTAT GGGTACTTGG
CCATCTTGCG GAT-3' (reverse), and the two fragments
were cloned into the BamH1 site of the pUHD10-3 vector
[15].
Construction of luciferase fusion indicators
A common reverse primer was employed to amplify C-terminal sequences of IRP2, including the hemagglutinin
(HA) tag and a stop codon, from pUHD-IRP2: 5'-AGTGTGCTCG AGCTAAGCGT AATCTGGAAC-3'. The forward
primers were: i) for C168: 5'-AGTGTGGAAT TCAGAGGCAC TTTTGCAAAT-3' and for C60: 5'-AGTGTGGAAT
TCCTCTCCGG TAGAGAAACA-3'. The primers introduce
EcoR1 and Xho1 restriction sites. The resulting fragments
were subcloned into the respective sites of a firefly luciferase cDNA in the pcDNA3.1 vector.

Cell culture
H1299 lung cancer cells were maintained in Dulbecco's
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Stable H1299 clones
for tetracycline-inducible expression of all IRP2 mutants
and IRP1/IRP2 chimeras and for non-inducible expression of luciferase fusion constructs were obtained as in
[15,29]; the clones expressing wild type IRP1 [8-10] and
IRP2 [15] were earlier described. All inducible clones were
maintained in DMEM containing 2 μg/ml tetracycline, 2
μg/ml puromycin and 250 μg/ml G418. The cells were
plated for 24–48 h in tetracycline-free media to allow
expression of transfected proteins. Tetracycline (2 μg/ml)
was then added back to shut off transcription of the inducible promoters.
Western blotting
Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and lysed in "cytoplasmic lysis buffer" (25 mM TrisCl pH 7.4, 40 mM KCl and 1% Triton X-100). Cell debris
was cleared by centrifugation and protein concentration
was determined with the Bradford reagent (BioRad). Cell
lysates (30 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels
and proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters.
The blots were saturated with 10% non-fat milk in PBS
and probed with FLAG (M2-FLAG, Sigma), HA (Santa
Cruz), TfR1 (Zymed), luciferase (Promega) or β-actin
(Sigma) antibodies, diluted 1:1000 (or 1:500 for luciferase) in PBS containing 5% non-fat milk and 0.5%
Tween-20 (PBST). Following wash with PBST, the blots
with monoclonal FLAG or TfR1 antibodies were incubated with peroxidase-coupled rabbit anti-mouse IgG
(1:4000 dilution). The blots with polyclonal HA, β-actin
or luciferase antibodies were incubated with peroxidasecoupled goat anti-rabbit IgG or donkey anti-goat IgG
(1:5000 dilution). Detection was performed with the
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method (Amersham). The immunoreactive bands were quantified by
densitometric scanning.
Pulse chase and immunoprecipitation
Cells were metabolically labeled for 2 h with 50 μCi/ml
Trans-[35S]-label, a mixture of 70:30 35S-methionine/
cysteine (ICN). The radioactive medium was then
removed and the cells were chased in cold media. The
chase was terminated by wash in PBS. The cells were lysed
in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.4, 300 mM
NaCl and 1% Triton X-100. Cell debris was cleared by centrifugation and cell lysates were subjected to quantitative
immunoprecipitation with the HA or FLAG antibodies.
Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDSPAGE. Radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by phosphorimaging.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
Cytoplasmic lysates were analyzed for IRE-binding activity by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay with a 32Plabeled IRE probe [30]. Supershifts were performed by the
addition of HA antibody to the binding reaction [15].
