Abstract
Background: The phylum Chlorophyta contains the majority of the green algae and is divided into four
classes. While the basal position of the Prasinophyceae is well established, the divergence order of the
Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae and Chlorophyceae (UTC) remains uncertain. The five complete
chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequences currently available for representatives of these classes display
considerable variability in overall structure, gene content, gene density, intron content and gene order.
Among these genomes, that of the chlorophycean green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has retained the
least ancestral features. The two single-copy regions, which are separated from one another by the large
inverted repeat (IR), have similar sizes, rather than unequal sizes, and differ radically in both gene contents
and gene organizations relative to the single-copy regions of prasinophyte and ulvophyte cpDNAs. To gain
insights into the various changes that underwent the chloroplast genome during the evolution of
chlorophycean green algae, we have sequenced the cpDNA of Scenedesmus obliquus, a member of a distinct
chlorophycean lineage.
Results: The 161,452 bp IR-containing genome of Scenedesmus features single-copy regions of similar
sizes, encodes 96 genes, i.e. only two additional genes (infA and rpl12) relative to its Chlamydomonas
homologue and contains seven group I and two group II introns. It is clearly more compact than the four
UTC algal cpDNAs that have been examined so far, displays the lowest proportion of short repeats among
these algae and shows a stronger bias in clustering of genes on the same DNA strand compared to
Chlamydomonas cpDNA. Like the latter genome, Scenedesmus cpDNA displays only a few ancestral gene
clusters. The two chlorophycean genomes share 11 gene clusters that are not found in previously
sequenced trebouxiophyte and ulvophyte cpDNAs as well as a few genes that have an unusual structure;
however, their single-copy regions differ considerably in gene content.
Conclusion: Our results underscore the remarkable plasticity of the chlorophycean chloroplast genome.
Owing to this plasticity, only a sketchy portrait could be drawn for the chloroplast genome of the last
common ancestor of Scenedesmus and Chlamydomonas.

Background
The complete chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequences currently available for green plants (green algae and land
plants) point to radically divergent evolutionary trends of
the chloroplast genome in the phyla Streptophyta and
Chlorophyta. The Streptophyta [1] comprises all land
plants and their closest green algal relatives, the members
of the class Charophyceae sensu Mattox and Stewart [2].
In this phylum are currently available the chloroplast
genome sequences of about 35 land plants and six or
seven charophycean green algae (six algae if the controversial phylogenetic position of Mesostigma viride at the base
of the Streptophyta and Chlorophyta [3-5] proves to be
correct and seven algae if its association with the Streptophyta is confirmed [6-8]). The Chlorophyta [9] comprises
the Prasinophyceae, Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae and
Chlorophyceae. The Prasinophyceae represent the most
basal divergence of the Chlorophyta [10,11] and,
although the branching order of the Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae and Chlorophyceae (UTC) remains uncertain [12], chloroplast and mitochondrial genome data
suggest that the Trebouxiophyceae emerged before the
Ulvophyceae and Chlorophyceae [13-15]. Complete chloroplast genome sequences have been reported for five
chlorophytes: the prasinophyte Nephroselmis olivacea [16],
the trebouxiophyte Chlorella vulgaris [17], the ulvophytes
Oltmannsiellopsis viridis [13] and Pseudendoclonium akinetum [15] and the chlorophycean green alga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [18].
In nearly all photosynthetic lineages investigated thus far
in the Streptophyta, the chloroplast genome harbours the
same quadripartite structure and the same gene partitioning pattern, genes are densely packed and most of the
genes are organized into conserved clusters [19,20], the
origin of which dates back to the common ancestor of all
chloroplasts [16]. The typical quadripartite structure is
characterized by the presence of two copies of a large
inverted repeat sequence (IR) separating a small singlecopy (SSC) and a large single-copy (LSC) region. The
rRNA operon always resides in the IR and is transcribed
toward the SSC region. Although the IR readily expands or
contracts by gaining or losing genes from the neighbouring single-copy regions [21], each of the three genomic
partitions (IR, SSC and LSC) shows a distinctive and
highly conserved gene content. Including 106 to 137
genes, the gene repertoire appears to have progressively
shrunk from charophycean green algae to land plants
[20,22]. Slight changes in intron composition of the chloroplast genome also occurred during streptophyte evolution [19,20,22]. The vast majority of introns were likely
acquired early during the evolution of charophycean
green algae.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/37

In the Chlorophyta, the chloroplast genome shows
extraordinary variability at the levels of its quadripartite
structure, global gene organization and intron composition. The cpDNA of the prasinophyte Nephroselmis features the largest gene repertoire (128 genes) and the most
ancestral features, including the quadripartite structure
and gene partitioning pattern observed in streptophytes
[16]. In contrast, all four completely sequenced UTC algal
cpDNAs encode fewer genes (94–112) and are substantially rearranged [13,15,17,18]. Moreover, genes in these
cpDNAs are more loosely packed than in Nephroselmis and
most streptophyte cpDNAs, intergenic spacers usually
contain short dispersed repeats (SDRs) and the coding
regions of some protein-coding genes are expanded
[13,15,18]. Of the four UTC cpDNAs, that of the trebouxiophyte Chlorella has retained the highest degree of ancestral characters; it lacks an IR but has retained many
ancestral gene clusters. Both ulvophyte cpDNAs feature an
atypical quadripartite structure that deviates from the
ancestral type displayed by Nephroselmis and streptophyte
cpDNAs. In each genome, one of the single-copy regions
features many genes characteristic of both the ancestral
SSC and LSC regions, whereas the opposite single-copy
region features only genes characteristic of the ancestral
LSC region. Moreover, the rRNA genes in the IR are transcribed toward the latter single-copy region. From their
observations, Pombert et al. [13] concluded that a dozen
genes were transferred from the LSC to the SSC region
before or soon after emergence of the Ulvophyceae and
that the transcription direction of the rRNA genes
changed. In the chlorophycean green alga Chlamydomonas,
the single-copy regions are similar in size and both their
gene contents and gene organizations display tremendous
differences relative to the same cpDNA regions in ulvophytes, implying that numerous genes were exchanged
between opposite single-copy regions during the evolutionary period separating the Ulvophyceae and the chlorophycean clade represented by Chlamydomonas (a clade
known as the Chlamydomonadales or CW clade [11]).
Gene reshuffling was so extensive that no reliable scenario
of gene rearrangements can be predicted to explain the
observed differences.
To gain insights into the various changes that underwent
the chloroplast genome in the Chlorophyceae, we have
undertaken the complete sequencing of the chloroplast
genome from distinct lineages of this class. We report here
the 161,452 bp chloroplast genome sequence of Scenedesmus obliquus, a member of the lineage that appears to
share a sister relationship with the Chlamydomonadales
(Sphaeropleales or DO clade) [23,24]. All swimming cells
in this lineage are biflagellates with a directly opposed
(DO) arrangement of basal bodies, instead of the clockwise (CW) arrangement seen in the Chlamydomonadales.
Scenedesmus cpDNA was found to be a compact genome

that carries as many derived features as its Chlamydomonas
homologue. It shares with Chlamydomonas cpDNA singlecopy regions of similar sizes, an almost identical gene repertoire and several derived gene clusters; however, the sets
of genes in the single-copy regions of these chlorophycean
genomes are very different. These extensive differences in
global gene arrangement underscore the remarkable plasticity of the chloroplast genome in the Chlorophyceae.

Results
General features
The Scenedesmus cpDNA sequence assembles as a circular
molecule of 161,452 bp encoding a total of 96 genes (not
counting intron ORFs, free-standing ORFs and duplicated
genes) (Fig. 1 and Table 1). With an overall A+T content
of 73.1%, this chloroplast genome is the most A+T rich
among completely sequenced chlorophyte cpDNAs. Two
identical copies of an IR sequence of 12,022 bp are separated from one another by single-copy regions differing by
only 7.5 kbp in size (SC1 and SC2). For both isomeric
forms of the genome, a remarkably strong bias is observed
in the distribution of genes between the two DNA strands.
In the isomer shown in Fig. 1, 82 genes occupy one strand
whereas, only 20, including the six present in the IR,
reside on the opposite strand. Furthermore, 64 consecutive genes, encompassing more than half of the genome,
feature the same polarity. The genes in Scenedesmus
cpDNA are more tightly packed than in the four other
completely sequenced UTC algal cpDNAs, their density

(67.2%) being comparable to that found in Nephroselmis
cpDNA (68.7%). Intergenic spacers have an average size
of 465 bp and feature short dispersed repeats (SDRs). A
total of nine introns, seven group I and two group II
introns, were identified in Scenedesmus cpDNA; five of
these introns display ORFs.
Gene content and gene structure
The gene repertoire of the Scenedesmus genome differs
from that of its Chlamydomonas homologue only by the
presence of two additional genes, infA and rpl12 (Table 1).
As in Chlamydomonas cpDNA, two identical copies of the
trnE(uuc) gene are found on opposite strands outside the
IR. Five ORFs with more than 65 codons were identified
in intergenic regions (Fig. 1). The largest one, ORF932,
resides in SC1 and is part of the long segment carrying
genes with identical polarity. The protein encoded by this
ORF shows limited sequence similarity with bacterial
reverse transcriptases, the observed similarity being
restricted to domain X. The four remaining ORFs display
no homology with any known DNA sequences. All five
ORFs differ from the conserved protein-coding genes at
the levels of codon usage and nucleotide composition.

As is the case for Chlamydomonas cpDNA, the rpoB and rps2
genes in Scenedesmus cpDNA each occur as two contiguous ORFs (Fig. 1) and two separate genes, clpP and rps3,
have extensions in their coding sequences that are absent
from other chlorophyte and streptophyte cpDNAs (Table

the corresponding Mesostigma gene.

2). The extra coding sequences in each of these genes share
the same insertion site in the two chlorophycean algae.
Note that the intein gene previously identified within the
Chlamydomonas eugametos clpP gene [25] lies at a position
different from the insertion sequence reported here for
Scenedesmus clpP. Six additional protein-coding genes in
both Scenedesmus and Chlamydomonas cpDNAs resemble
their Chlorella and/or ulvophyte homologues in exhibiting expanded coding regions (Table 2). In sharp contrast,
the rRNA and tRNA genes of UTC algae show less than 1%
deviation in size relative to their homologues in Nephroselmis and Mesostigma.
Gene partitioning and gene clustering
Our comparison of the gene complements found in the
three genomic regions of Scenedesmus cpDNA with those
observed in the Chlamydomonas genome reveals dramatic
differences in the gene composition of the single-copy
regions (Fig. 1). In each single-copy region of Scenedesmus
cpDNA, we find numerous genes whose homologues map
to the opposite single-copy region in the Chlamydomonas
genome. Of the 43 genes displayed by Scenedesmus SC1
(largest single-copy region), 24 are located in the SC1
region (largest single-copy region) of Chlamydomonas
(genes shown in cyan in Fig. 1), whereas all the others
map to the alternate SC2 region (genes shown in
magenta). Similarly, 19 of the 47 genes present in
Scenedesmus SC2 reside in the SC1 region of
Chlamydomonas, whereas all the others lie in the opposite
SC2 region. Note here that the single-copy regions of both
Scenedesmus and Chlamydomonas were arbitrarily desig-

nated (see Table 1) and that the genes shared by the SC1
or SC2 regions of these algae were not necessarily confined to the same single-copy region in the chloroplast
genome of the last common ancestor of the two algae.
Assuming that the SC1 or SC2 regions in Scenedesmus and
Chlamydomonas cpDNAs are equivalent, it would be necessary to propose that the transcription direction of the
rRNA operon was altered during the evolution of chlorophycean green algae concurrently with the extensive
exchanges of genes that took place between the singlecopy regions.
To identify the ancestral clusters carried by Scenedesmus
cpDNA as well as the derived clusters that are shared with
other UTC algal cpDNAs, we carried out a detailed comparative analysis of gene order. As a first step, we investigated the 24 gene clusters present in both Mesostigma and
Nephroselmis cpDNAs and found that Scenedesmus cpDNA
is identical to its Chlamydomonas counterpart in terms of
composition of ancestral clusters (Fig. 2). Both chlorophycean green algal cpDNAs harbour a single, intact
ancestral cluster (psbB-T-/N-/H, with the slash indicating a
change in gene polarity) and the remains of four other
ancestral clusters: altogether, these conserved clusters
encode 20 genes. These observations confirm the notion
that the lowest degree of ancestral clusters among UTC
algal cpDNAs is found in the chlorophycean lineage
[18,26]. As previously reported by Pombert et al. [13], the
chloroplast genome of the trebouxiophyte Chlorella exhibits the highest conservation of ancestral clusters among
completely sequenced UTC algal cpDNAs; it has retained

Conservation of ancestral gene clusters in Scenedesmus and other UTC algal cpDNAs
Conservation of ancestral gene clusters in Scenedesmus and other UTC algal cpDNAs. Black boxes represent the
89 genes found in the 24 clusters shared by Mesostigma and Nephroselmis cpDNAs as well as the genes in UTC algal cpDNAs
that have retained the same order as those in these ancestral clusters. For each genome, the set of genes making up each of the
identified clusters (either an intact or fragmented ancestral cluster) is shown as black boxes connected by a horizontal line.
Black boxes that are contiguous but not linked together indicate that the corresponding genes are not adjacent on the genome.
Gray boxes denote genes in UTC algal cpDNAs that have been relocated elsewhere on the chloroplast genome; open boxes
denote genes that have disappeared from the chloroplast genome. Although the rpl22 gene is missing from Nephroselmis
cpDNA, it is shown as belonging to the large ribosomal protein cluster equivalent to the contiguous S10, spc and α operons of
Escherichia coli because it is present in this cluster in the cpDNAs of Mesostigma, streptophytes and algae from other lineages.
Note also that the psbB cluster of Oltmannsiellopsis and Pseudendoclonium cpDNAs differs from the ancestral cluster found in
other genomes by the presence of psbN on the alternate DNA strand.

11 intact clusters and four partially conserved ones that
include 62 genes. The chloroplast genomes of the ulvophytes Oltmannsiellopsis and Pseudendoclonium have
retained only five of the 24 ancestral clusters in an intact
state as well as 13 and 10 partially conserved clusters,
respectively.
The overall gene order in Scenedesmus cpDNA was also
compared to the global gene arrangements of other completely sequenced UTC algal cpDNAs. As expected, we
found that Scenedesmus cpDNA most closely resembles its
Chlamydomonas counterpart at the level of derived gene
clusters. The two chlorophycean genomes share 11 clusters that are not conserved in Chlorella, Oltmannsiellopsis
and Pseudendoclonium cpDNAs (Fig. 1 and Table 4). Three
of these clusters (clusters 9, 10 and 11) are adjacent on the

Scenedesmus genome, whereas no shared derived clusters
show contiguity on Chlamydomonas cpDNA. Only the
rpoB-/psbF-psbL cluster originated by fusion of a fragment
of ancestral cluster (psbF-psbL) with other genes. Two of
the 11 derived clusters, petA-petD and trnL(uag)-clpP clusters, as well segments of the atpA-psbI-cemA and psbE-rps9ycf4-ycf3 clusters (relevant segments are underlined) have
been previously identified not only in C. reinhardtii and its
close relative C. gelatinosa [27] but also in the distantly
pair of interfertile algae C. eugametos and C. moewusii [26]
and their close relative C. pitschmannii [28], indicating
their conservation in the Chlamydomonodales. The
Scenedesmus chloroplast genome shares no specific gene
clusters with Oltmannsiellopsis and Pseudendoclonium
cpDNA and only one pair of genes (psaJ-rps12, a subset of
cluster 3 in Table 4) with Chlorella cpDNA.

The seven group I introns of Scenedesmus interrupt four
genes: three introns occur in psbA, two in rrl and the two
others in psaB and trnL(uaa). These introns fall within

four different subgroups (IA1, IA3, IB4 and IC3), with the
IA1 subgroup including the four introns present in psaB
and psbA (Table 3). At 255 bp, the IC3 intron in trnL(uaa)
is the smallest of the Scenedesmus introns. As homologous
introns are inserted at the same position not only in the
chloroplast trnL(uaa) genes of the chlorophytes Bryopsis
and Chlorella (Table 3) but also in the trnL(uaa) genes of
streptophytes and algae from other lineages, this intron is
thought to have been inherited by vertical inheritance
from the common ancestor of all chloroplasts [29]. The
IA3 and IB4 introns in Scenedesmus rrl are also positionally
and structurally homologous to previously reported
introns in green plant cpDNAs (Table 3). Although the
four IA1 introns revealed relatively poor sequence similarity with one another, two of these introns, So.psaB.1 and
So.psbA.3, were found to be clearly homologous to introns
inserted at identical gene locations in Chlamydomonas
moewusii and Pseudendoclonium cpDNAs, respectively
(Table 3). So. psbA.3 and its Pseudendoclonium homologue
display not only similar primary sequences and secondary
structures, but also similar ORFs encoding potential hom-

ing endonucleases carrying the H-N-H motif (44% identity at the protein sequence level). The two other IA1
introns of Scenedesmus, So.psbA.1 and So.psbA.2, represent
unique insertion positions in the psbA gene; they are
located only 5 bp and 6 bp away from the second and
fourth introns in Pseudendoclonium psbA, respectively. For
these two pairs of closely linked introns, similarity was
found to be limited to the So. psbA.1 intron-encoded H-NH homing endonuclease, which shares 33% sequence
identity with the protein encoded by second intron in
Pseudendoclonium psbA.
One of the two group II introns of Scenedesmus is spliced
in trans at the RNA level. This intron occurs in psaA and is
inserted at exactly the same site as the second of the two
trans-spliced introns in Chlamydomonas psaA [30] (Table
3). Like its Chlamydomonas homologue, it has no ORF.
These
positionally
identical
Scenedesmus
and
Chlamydomonas psaA introns both belong to the IIB subgroup, share poor sequence similarity and are both fragmented within domain IV (Fig. 3). The second group II
intron in Scenedesmus cpDNA lies within petD and has no
known homologue (Table 3). This intron harbours in its
domain IV an ORF encoding a reverse transcriptase [31]
with the typical reverse transcriptase, maturase and nuclease domains [32].

latter spacers often form longer repeated sequences that
are not randomly distributed on the Scenedesmus
genome. In Fig. 4, it can be seen that the great majority of
the repeats exceeding 30 bp in size are confined to one
half of the genome. While most of the intergenic spacers
harbouring SDRs reside in regions that differ in gene order
relative the Chlamydomonas genome, some occur in
shared, derived gene clusters (clusters 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7).
In the intergenic spacers displaying copies of the same
repeat unit, these copies are often arranged in direct orientation (Fig. 4) and separated by 23–25 bp; identical
repeats also occur on different strands but, in this configuration, their distances are highly variable (8–116 bp). In
intergenic regions of Chlamydomonas cpDNA, repeated
elements appear to show arrangements similar to those
reported here for Scenedesmus cpDNA. In contrast, in Oltmannsiellopsis and Pseudendoclonium cpDNAs, SDRs occur
predominantly as stem-loop structures [13,15]. None of
the repeat units of Scenedesmus cpDNA was identified as
being part of SDRs in other UTC algal cpDNAs.

Discussion

Short dispersed repeats
SDR elements were identified in many intergenic spacers
and some coding regions of Scenedesmus cpDNA; however, they are less numerous than those found in other
UTC algal cpDNAs (Table 5). The repeats ≥ 30 bp in the
Scenedesmus genome represent 8.7% of the total size of the
intergenic spacers, whereas the fraction of the intergenic
regions represented by such repeats in Chlamydomonas
cpDNA reaches 31.9%. Analysis of the most abundant
repeat elements in the Scenedesmus genome using RepeatFinder revealed three distinct groups of repeat units featuring sequences of 15 or 16 bp (Table 6). With a total of
41 copies, repeat unit B represents the most abundant
group of repeats. Repeat units A and C are restricted to
intergenic regions, whereas some copies of unit B are also
found within the coding regions of five genes that are
expanded relative to their Mesostigma counterparts, i.e.
cemA, ftsH, infA, rpoBa and rpoC2 (Fig. 4 and see Table 2).

Our comparative analyses of the Scenedesmus chloroplast
genome with previously sequenced chlorophyte cpDNAs
highlight the remarkable plasticity displayed by the chloroplast genome in the Chlorophyceae. As expected, we
found that Scenedesmus cpDNA shows the most similarities with Chlamydomonas cpDNA. The almost identical
gene repertoires displayed by these chlorophycean green
algal cpDNAs contrasts with the tremendous differences
they exhibit at the level of gene order and pattern of gene
partitioning between the single-copy regions. This highly
variable gene organization is not the only surprising result
that emerged from our study. Three other features of the
Scenedesmus genome were found to be peculiar: (1) its
high gene density, which mirrors that found for Nephroselmis cpDNA and diverges from the tendency of previously studied UTC algal cpDNAs to grow in size by
gaining sequences in intergenic regions and selected gene
coding regions [13,15,18], (2) the low abundance of its
repeated sequences, which represents the lowest level
identified thus far in a UTC algal cpDNA and (3) the
strongly biased distribution of its genes between the two
DNA strands.

Although repeat units A, B and C occur on both strands of
Scenedesmus cpDNA, they are not evenly distributed
throughout the genome (Fig. 4). Many intergenic spacers
entirely lack copies of these repeat units and tend to be
clustered in distinct cpDNA regions (e.g., the regions in
the vicinity of petD, psbA and rpoC1). On the other hand,
numerous intergenic spacers are populated by two or
more copies of the same repeat unit and/or by several copies representing different units (Fig. 4). The repeats in the

The features shared by Scenedesmus and Chlamydomonas
cpDNAs provide information on the cpDNA of the last
common ancestor of DO and CW green algae; however,
the portrait that could be drawn for this ancestral genome
is rather sketchy owing to the major differences observed
at the levels of gene order and intron content. We infer
that the chloroplast genome of the last common ancestor
of DO and CW green algae harboured a total of 96 genes,
including a duplicated trnE(uuc) gene, that one third of

these genes were organized in the same order as those
found in the 11 gene clusters specifically shared by
Scenedesmus and Chlamydomonas cpDNAs, that both rps2
and rpoB were fragmented in two pieces and that clpP and
rps3 each displayed an insertion sequence. During the
evolution of chlamydomonads, infA and rpl12 genes disappeared from the chloroplast genome and rpoC1 was
broken into two separate reading frames. We also predict
with confidence that the ancestral genome contained
introns in rrl and psaA at the same positions as those
shared by Scenedesmus and Chlamydomonas cpDNAs as
well as introns in trnL(uaa), psaB, and rrl at the same positions as those shared by Scenedesmus and other chlorophyte cpDNAs. Homologues of all these introns, with the
exception of the trnL(uaa) intron, have been identified in
chlamydomonads distantly related to C. reinhardtii (rrl,
[33-35]; psaA, [26,36]; psaB, [37]). In contrast, the
trnL(uaa) intron shows a broader distribution among
green algae and is thought to have been inherited from the
common ancestor of all chloroplasts [29]. Undoubtedly,
as reported for C. reinhardtii cpDNA [38], the psaA intron
of the last common ancestor of DO and CW green algae
featured a break in domain IV, the two psaA exons were
unlinked and transcribed independently along with an
intron fragment, and the intron was spliced in trans. In the
CW lineage, a second trans-spliced group II intron (a tripartite intron comprising the RNA species encoded by the
chloroplast tscA gene) took residence within psaA [38],
group I introns inserted at several new sites within rrl

[33,34,39] and members of the group I family also
invaded multiple sites of the rrs [40,41], psbA [42] and
psbC [37] genes.
The unusual structures displayed by the expanded clpP
and rps3 genes and the fragmented rps2 and rpoB genes are
inventions that arose in the Chlorophyceae. For both clpP
and rps3, it has been shown that the insertion sequence is
not removed at the RNA level [43,44]. Characterization of
the chloroplast ClpP/R protease complex of C. reinhardtii
revealed that the approximately 30 kDa insertion
sequence in clpP, designated as IS1, could be a new type of
intein [45]. Two distinct proteins derived from the chloroplast clpP gene, a long version containing IS1 and a shorter
version lacking this sequence element, were found to be
stable components of this complex. IS1 has been hypothesized to prevent interaction with the HSP100 chaperone
and to be localized in only one of the two heptamers
forming the complex, thus prohibiting access of protein
substrates to the proteolytic chamber of the ClpP/R complex via one of its axial pores. In contrast, a proteomic
analysis of ribosomal proteins in the small subunit of the
chloroplast ribosome from C. reinhardtii revealed that the
insertion sequence in rps3 is an integral part of the mature
product of this gene [46]. In this same analysis, Rps2 was
also found to be an unusually large ribosomal protein;
this protein of 570 amino acid residues encoded by rps2b
(the largest of the two ORFs showing sequence similarity
to the bacterial rps2 genes), contains an N-terminal exten-

exposed to the solvent side and are located near each
other and around the neck of the 30S subunit, may be
related to unique features of translational regulation, or
they may be orthologues of nonribosomal proteins [46].
Finally, it is not yet clear how the fragmented rpoB gene is
expressed at the protein level. This gene is undoubtedly
essential for cell survival in view of the fact that, unlike
their homologues in land plants, the C. reinhardtii nuclear
genome does not appear to encode a chloroplast-targeted
RNA polymerase [47,48].
The considerable differences in gene density and abundance of SDRs observed in Scenedesmus and
Chlamydomonas cpDNAs raise questions about the status
of the chloroplast genome of the common ancestor of DO
and CW green algae with regards to these features. From
the data derived from previously sequenced chlorophyte
cpDNAs, Pombert et al. [13,15] proposed that proliferation of repeated sequences in intergenic regions and
selected genes occurred progressively during the evolution
of UTC algae, thereby accounting for the observation that
the Chlamydomonas genome is the most rich in SDR elements and the least tightly packed with genes. The results
reported here are compatible with this idea and support
the presence of SDRs in the common ancestor of Scenedesmus and Chlamydomonas cpDNAs provided that specific
loss of numerous SDRs occurred concurrently with
streamlining of the genome in the Scenedesmus lineage.
On the other hand, considering that no common SDRs
have been identified in different UTC algal cpDNAs, the
idea that these genetic elements were independently
acquired in UTC lineages cannot be ruled out.
The single-copy regions of Scenedesmus
and
Chlamydomonas cpDNAs are almost equal in size but differ
radically in gene content, indicating that many genes were
exchanged between opposite single-copy regions during
the evolution of the DO and CW algae. This observation
contrasts with the situation reported for the cpDNAs of C.
reinhardtii and C. moewusii [26]. These representatives of
deeply branched chlamydomonad lineages also display

extensive gene rearrangements in their cpDNAs; however,
these rearrangements are mainly confined to individual
single-copy regions. Only two (atpA and psbI) of the 77
genes mapped on the C. reinhardtii and C. moewusii
genomes [26-28] moved from one single-copy region to
the other.
To compare the level of gene rearrangements displayed by
Scenedesmus and Chlamydomonas cpDNAs with those
exhibited by other pairs of chlorophyte cpDNAs, we
examined the orders of the 90 genes common to seven
green algal cpDNAs (Table 7). In these analyses, changes
in gene order were assumed to occur only by inversions,
an hypothesis that is strongly supported by previous mapping analyses of chloroplast genes from closely related
chlamydomonads [27,28]. We estimated that a minimum
of 58 inversions would be required to convert the gene
order of Scenedesmus cpDNA to that of Chlamydomonas
cpDNA. Although extensive, this level of gene rearrangements is less important than those observed in the comparisons involving each chlorophycean genome and a
genome from another green algal class (Table 7). The similar levels of gene rearrangements observed in these interclass comparisons suggest that the gene organizations of
both Chlamydomonas and Scenedesmus diverged considerably from that of their last common ancestor.
The high gene density and strongly biased distribution of
genes between the two DNA strands in the Scenedesmus
genome most probably reflect the influence of natural
selection on genome organization. A bias in clustering of
adjacent genes on the same DNA strand has also been
reported for the Chlamydomonas chloroplast genome [49];
however, this bias is less conspicuous than that observed
for Scenedesmus cpDNA. For Chlamydomonas cpDNA, a
parametric bootstrap approach was used to test if gene
order evolves under selection [49]. In this analysis, the
putative gene order in the common ancestor of
Chlamydomonas and Chlorella was inferred and subjected
to random rearrangements. It was found that the multiple
gene rearrangements in the Chlamydomonas lineage

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:37

resulted in an increased sidedness, i.e. an increased propensity of adjacent genes to be located on the same strand.
Sidedness indices of 0.6966 and 0.8710 were scored for
the common ancestor and Chlamydomonas, respectively,
and simulated genomes showed a significant decrease in
sidedness relative to the ancestral genome. At 0.8842, the
sidedness index we calculated for Scenedesmus cpDNA is
slightly higher than that reported for its Chlamydomonas
counterpart.
Coding strand biases have also been reported for the plastid genomes of the parasitic green alga Helicosporidium sp.
[50], the euglenozoan alga Euglena gracilis [51], and apicomplexan parasites [52-55]. This feature is prominent in
the highly reduced Helicosporidium genome where a symmetry in strand bias of coding regions has been observed,
with nearly all genes on each half of the genome being
encoded on one strand. The two strands of the Helicosporidium and Euglena genomes are also biased with
regards to nucleotide composition and this compositional
bias switches at the putative origin of DNA replication
[50,51]. It has been proposed that the coding strand bias
observed in these genomes is generated by selection to
code highly expressed genes on the leading strand to limit
collisions between RNA and DNA polymerases, thereby
increasing the rates of both replication and transcription.
Unlike their Helicosporidium and Euglena homologues,
Scenedesmus and Chlamydomonas cpDNAs show no strand
bias in nucleotide composition (our unpublished results
and [49]), thus providing no support for the notion that
gene orders in chlorophycean genomes are selected to
maximize the rate of replication. The high degree of sidedness observed for Scenedesmus and Chlamydomonas cpDNAs could result mainly from selection of polycistronic
transcription to coordinate gene expression [49].

Conclusion
Our study revealed that, although Scenedesmus and
Chlamydomonas cpDNAs display nearly identical gene repertoires and a high level of sidedness in the distribution of
their genes on the two DNA strands, their gene orders are
highly scrambled. In future studies, it will be interesting to
investigate whether remodelling of the chloroplast
genome is subjected to different constraints in the DO
and CW lineages and whether the derived state of
Scenedesmus and Chlamydomonas cpDNAs arose early during the evolution of chlorophycean green algae. To test
this hypothesis, it will be necessary to examine other representatives of the DO and CW clades as well as members
of more basal lineages of the Chlorophyceae.

Methods
Strain and culture conditions
Scenedesmus obliquus (Turp.) Kürtz was obtained from the
Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Texas at

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/37

Austin (UTEX 393) and grown in modified Volvox
medium [56] under 12 h light/dark cycles.
Isolation and sequencing of cpDNA
An A+T rich fraction containing cpDNA was isolated and
sequenced as described in Pombert et al. [14]. Sequences
were edited and assembled with AUTOASSEMBLER 2.1.1
(Applied Biosystems). The fully annotated chloroplast
genome sequence has been deposited in [GenBank:DQ396875].
Analyses of genome sequence
Gene content was determined by Blast homology searches
[57] against the nonredundant database of the National
Center for Biotechnology and Information (NCBI) server.
Protein-coding genes and open reading frames (ORFs)
were localized precisely using ORFFINDER at NCBI, various programs of the GCG version 10.2 package (Accelrys,
Burlington, Mass.) and other applications from the
EMBOSS version 2.6.0 package [58]. Genes coding for
tRNAs were localized using tRNAscan-SE 1.23 [59].
Repeated sequences were identified using REPuter 2.74
[60] and classified using REPEATFINDER [61]. Numbers
of SDR units were determined with FINDPATTERNS of
the GCG Wisconsin Package version 10.2. The total length
of genome sequences containing repeated elements was
estimated with RepeatMasker [62] running under the WUBLAST 2.0 search engine [63].

The GRIMM web server [64] was used to infer the minimal
number of gene permutations by inversions in pairwise
comparisons of chloroplast genomes. Because GRIMM
cannot deal with duplicated genes and requires that the
compared genomes have the same gene content, genes
within one of the two copies of the IR were excluded and
only the genes common to all the compared genomes
were analysed. The data set used in the comparative analyses reported in Table 7 contained 90 genes; the three
exons of the trans-spliced psaA gene were coded as distinct
fragments (for a total of 92 gene loci).
