Abstract
Background: The Republic of Korea (South Korea) is one of the countries where vivax malaria had been successfully
eradicated by the late 1970s. However, re-emergence of vivax malaria in South Korea was reported in 1993. Several
epidemiological studies and some genetic studies using antigenic molecules of Plasmodium vivax in the country have
been reported, but the evolutionary history of P. vivax has not been fully understood. In this study, the origin of the
South Korean P. vivax population was estimated by molecular phylogeographic analysis.
Methods: A haplotype network analysis based on P. vivax mitochondrial (mt) DNA sequences was conducted on 11 P.
vivax isolates from South Korea and another 282 P. vivax isolates collected worldwide.
Results: The network analysis of P. vivax mtDNA sequences showed that the coexistence of two different groups (A and
B) in South Korea. Groups A and B were identical or close to two different populations in southern China.
Conclusions: Although the direct introduction of the two P. vivax populations in South Korea were thought to have
been from North Korea, the results of this analysis suggest the genealogical origin to be the two different populations
in southern China.
Background
Malaria is distributed not only in tropical and subtropical
areas but also in some temperate areas of the world. Plasmodium falciparum, which is distributed in tropical and
subtropical areas, accounts for 90% of malaria cases. Like
P. falciparum, Plasmodium vivax is distributed in tropical
and subtropical areas, but its range extends to some temperate areas. In Asian and South American countries, the
proportion of P. falciparum cases is gradually decreasing
due to global malaria controls programmes, such as The
Roll Back Malaria Partnership and The Global Fund. On
the other hand, the proportion of P. vivax cases is gradu-

ally increasing [1]. Therefore, P. vivax should be given
greater attention than it has received.
The Republic of Korea (South Korea) is one of the
countries where vivax malaria had been successfully
eradicated by the late 1970s. This was due to an effective
national eradication programme conducted by the
National Malaria Eradication Service under the operation
of the South Korean government with the support of the
WHO [2-4]. However, in 1993, the first case of indigenous vivax malaria after the eradication program was
reported from the border area between North and South
Korea in the western Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) [5]. The
number of cases steadily increased until 2000 (4,142
cases), at which point they began to gradually decrease
until 2004 (864 cases). However, in 2005, 2006 and 2007,
the number of reported cases increased again (1,311,
2,019 and 2,203 cases, respectively) [6]. Initially, the
patients were South Korean soldiers or veterans that had
served in the western DMZ. However, the numbers of
vivax cases among civilians living in the area were also

gradually increasing [6]. According to the WHO, vivax
malaria in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(North Korea), with 99,582 reported cases in 1999;
298,058 cases in 2001; and 34,485 cases in 2004, was
more prevalent than in South Korea [7,8].
Plasmodium vivax in South and North Korea has
unique characteristics, such as a long incubation period
(maximum 13 months), seasonal transmission (only the
summer season) and it is adapted to a cold climate [3,915]: the endemic areas are covered with snow in winter
season. Although the evolutionary history of P. vivax
from other countries has recently been addressed, thus
far the history of P. vivax in the Korean peninsula (South
and North Korea) has not been clearly understood [1618]. Several epidemiological data showed that the reemergence of vivax malaria in South Korea would be the
introduction from North Korea through the DMZ [3-8].
However, the geographical origin of P. vivax population
in the Korean peninsula has not been determined so far.
In the present study, in order to estimate geographical
origin of the P. vivax population in the Korean peninsula,
phylogeographic analysis of the P. vivax population in
South Korea and the other populations worldwide
(including a North Korean isolate) was conducted.

Materials
Sample collection

Ten blood samples were collected from vivax malaria
patients who were South Korean soldiers that served in
the DMZ in 1999. One blood sample was collected from a
Korean visitor to Japan in 2002. He was a veteran in the
Korean army who had served in the DMZ before he visited Japan and had never been abroad before his visit
[19,20]. The patient blood samples were preserved at 30°C until use. These patients were also diagnosed by
microscopic examination of peripheral blood smears.
This study was performed according to the ethical guidelines for epidemiological studies provided by the Ministry
of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology
and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan.
DNA extraction, Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA
sequencing

The parasite DNA was extracted from the frozen whole
blood samples by phenol-chloroform extraction after
proteinase K digestion [21]. The whole mitochondrial
(mt) DNA sequences (approx. 6 Kb) of the P. vivax isolates form South Korea were amplified by PCR using
three pairs of primer sets:
Pv-mt1 F (5'-TTCCACTACCAAAATATAATCTCCT3')
Pv-mt1 R (5'-CACACAAAATCACCGTTCTTATAA
A-3')
Pv-mt2 F (5'-TAAATGTGCTTTAATATTATTATAG3')

Pv-mt2 R (5'-CATAATTCCATAAGAAATTAATATT3')
Pv-mt3 F (5'-ATCAACAATGACTTTATTTGGTTTA3')
Pv-mt3 R (5'-ACTATAAAACATGTGATCTAATTAC3'), which were designed form the mt sequence of the P.
vivax af20012 isolate [GenBank: AY791517]. Three
amplified DNA fragments (approx. 2 Kb) overlapped with
each other. Sequencing of the PCR products was performed using an Applied Biosystems 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc, Foster City, CA, USA),
using ABI PRISM Big Dye Terminator v.3.1 (Applied Biosystems Inc, Foster City, CA, USA).
Phylogenetic analysis

MtDNA sequences (approx. 6 Kb) of the 11 P. vivax isolates from South Korea (present study) [DDBJ:
AB550270-AB550280] and another 282 P. vivax isolates
collected worldwide that had been deposited in the GenBank database, were used for phylogenetic analysis
[16,17]. Mu et al [16] deposited 176 sequences [GenBank:
AY791517.1-AY791692.1]. Jongwutiwes et al [17] deposited 106 sequences [GenBank: AY598035.1-AY598140.1].
DNA alignment of the whole mtDNA sequences of the P.
vivax isolates was performed by the DNA Alignment version 1.3.0.1 computer software (Fluxus Technology Ltd.)
[22]. A haplotype network was constructed based on
polymorphic sites of the whole mtDNA sequences of the
isolates using the Median-Joining method in the NETWORK version 4.5.1.6 computer software (Fluxus Technology Ltd.) [23].

Results and Discussion
A haplotype network was inferred by the 282 mtDNA
sequences of P. vivax populations that had been collected
worldwide, together with the 11 South Korean isolates
(Figure 1). The network tree indicated that two groups of
P. vivax populations coexist in South Korea (i.e. SK group
A and B). The isolates of the SK group A (shown in green)
were genetically identical or close to some isolates from
southern China (shown in red), and those of the SK group
B (shown in green) were also genetically identical or close
to other isolates from southern China (shown in red). A
neighbour-joining (NJ) tree (Additional File 1a, b) using
the same data set for the network analysis were clearly
demonstrated that the isolates of the SK group A were
clustered with some isolates from southern China, and
those of the SK group B were also clustered with other
isolates from southern China. Therefore, the two clusters
as defined in the NJ tree were named group A complex
and group B complex, respectively. The boundaries of the
two group complexes were shown in red boxes.
In a previous report, Kho et al [24] also noted the
observation of two types of genotypes (i.e. SK type A and
B) in some antigenic molecules of P. vivax in South

Korean populations. In the present study, 91% of the isolates (10/11) were correlated to the results of the previous
studies on the antigenic molecules: the South Korean isolates in the group A complex had SK type A antigenic
molecules, and the South Korean isolates in the group B
complex had SK type B antigenic molecules (Additional
File 2).
The group A complex was genetically close to Southeast Asian populations (shown in gray); most of them
were isolates from Thailand and Vietnam, or close to the
South Asian population (shown in black); they were isolates from India, Pakistan and Iran (Figure 1). The group
B complex was genetically close to the Indonesia population (shown in blue). Generally, old (or ancestral) populations are more genetically diverged than young
populations. In this context, the Southeast Asian populations (shown in gray) and Papua New Guinean populations (shown in white) seemed old populations.
Considering a possible population expansion, the group B

complex seemed to have diverged from the Indonesian
population (Figure 1). The genetic divergence of the
extant P. vivax populations in the world is presumably a
result of ancient hominid geographic expansion [17].
Therefore, the relationships between the group B complex and the Indonesian population suggests a possibility
that the expansion of P. vivax population(s) from Indonesia to southern China was brought about with the migration(s) of ancient hominids. Another possible scenario is
that the group B complex has directly diverged from the
Southeast Asian populations because some isolates from
Southeast Asia are identical to those from Indonesia. In
this scenario, the expansion of P. vivax population(s)
from Southeast Asia to Indonesia was also brought about
with the migration(s) of ancient hominids. Although the
present South Korean P. vivax populations are believed to
have recently derived from North Korea via the DMZ,
this study suggests that the P. vivax lineages in the Korean

peninsula have their genealogical ancestor in P. vivax
populations from southern China.
One of the remarkable characteristics of P. vivax in
Korean peninsula is its evolutionary adaptation to the
cold climate. The long incubation period of Korean P.
vivax is the key to the adaptation, because the parasites in
the liver cells of the human host appears in the blood
streams from the liver cells mainly between June and September (around the summer season) when mosquitoes
are highly prevalent, but the parasites remain in the liver
cells in the other colder seasons when mosquitoes are not
present [3,9,15]. In this phenomenon, it seems as if the
parasites are waiting for the mosquitoes within the host
liver cells by regulating the duration of the incubation
period.
Several workers reported that there seem to be two
types of P. vivax strains (or populations) in the Korean
peninsula: one with a short incubation period and the
other with a long incubation period. The incubation
period of the former type of North Korean strain is 14
days to 1 month, and the incubation period of the latter
type of strain is 8 months to 13 months, as determined by
experimental infection to humans through bites of the
infected mosquitoes [25]. The proportion of strains (or
populations) showing the short incubation period was
26.0%, whereas the proportion of strains (or populations)
showing the long incubation period was 74.0% [25]. One
mtDNA sequence of a North Korean isolate deposited in
the GenBank database was included in the present study.
The North Korean isolate was shown as No. 2 (shown in
dark green) in the group B complex in the haplotype network in Figure 1. The information of the incubation
period of the North Korean isolate was not obtained.
One isolate from the imported patient in Japan [19,20]
with a long incubation period (at least eight months) was
also grouped in the group B complex shown as No. 1 in
the haplotype network (Figure 1). The information on the
duration of the incubation period of the other 10 South
Korean isolates used in this study has not been obtained
thus far, but the branching patterns in the network tree
appear to be related to the phenotypic characteristics of
the parasites within the host.
Further study is needed to demonstrate whether the
two groups of South Korean isolates (groups A and B)
correlate with some clinical or epidemiological differences in the endemic areas. Haplotype network analysis
using the mtDNA sequences of P. vivax is a useful tool for
estimating the geographical origin of isolates as well as
for the prediction of probable phenotypes.

Conclusion
The direct introduction of the present P. vivax populations to South Korea is thought to be from North Korea
via the DMZ, but the true origin of the P. vivax popula-

tions in the Korean peninsula is now suggested to be from
the two different P. vivax populations in southern China.

version 3.1 (Kumar S, Tamura K, Nei M: MEGA3: Integrated Software for
Molecular Evolutionary Analysis and Sequence Alignment. Bioinformatics
2004, 5:150-163) using Kimura's 2-parameter model for calculating genetic
distance. Additional File 1a continued to Additional File 1b. The isolate
(AY598125 Vietnam) with Asterisk (*) at the bottom of the Additional File 1a
is identical to the isolate with Asterisk at the top of the Additional File 1b.
The eleven South Korean isolates (present study) were clustered into either
Group A complex or Group B complex in the Additional File 1b.
