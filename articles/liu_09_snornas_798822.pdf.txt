Abstract
Background: SnoRNAs represent an excellent model for studying the structural and functional evolution
of small non-coding RNAs involved in the post-transcriptional modification machinery for rRNAs and
snRNAs in eukaryotic cells. Identification of snoRNAs from Neurospora crassa, an important model
organism playing key roles in the development of modern genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology
will provide insights into the evolution of snoRNA genes in the fungus kingdom.
Results: Fifty five box C/D snoRNAs were identified and predicted to guide 71 2'-O-methylated sites
including four sites on snRNAs and three sites on tRNAs. Additionally, twenty box H/ACA snoRNAs,
which potentially guide 17 pseudouridylations on rRNAs, were also identified. Although not exhaustive,
the study provides the first comprehensive list of two major families of snoRNAs from the filamentous
fungus N. crassa. The independently transcribed strategy dominates in the expression of box H/ACA
snoRNA genes, whereas most of the box C/D snoRNA genes are intron-encoded. This shows that
different genomic organizations and expression modes have been adopted by the two major classes of
snoRNA genes in N. crassa . Remarkably, five gene clusters represent an outstanding organization of box
C/D snoRNA genes, which are well conserved among yeasts and multicellular fungi, implying their
functional importance for the fungus cells. Interestingly, alternative splicing events were found in the
expression of two polycistronic snoRNA gene hosts that resemble the UHG-like genes in mammals.
Phylogenetic analysis further revealed that the extensive separation and recombination of two functional
elements of snoRNA genes has occurred during fungus evolution.
Conclusion: This is the first genome-wide analysis of the filamentous fungus N. crassa snoRNAs that aids
in understanding the differences between unicellular fungi and multicellular fungi. As compared with two
yeasts, a more complex pattern of methylation guided by box C/D snoRNAs in multicellular fungus than
in unicellular yeasts was revealed, indicating the high diversity of post-transcriptional modification guided
by snoRNAs in the fungus kingdom.

Background
Eukaryotic rRNAs contain a large number of nucleotide
modifications including 2'-O-methylation and pseudouridylation which are directed by box C/D snoRNAs and
box H/ACA snoRNAs, respectively [1,2]. These modifications are usually found in the conserved core regions of
rRNAs, and they play important roles in ribosome function [3]. SnoRNAs are among the most numerous and
functionally diverse non-coding RNAs currently known
[4,5], existing widely in eukaryotes including human [68], plants [9-11], yeasts [12-15] and protists [16-19], as
well as in Archaea [20]. This indicates that they are ancient
molecules that arose over 2-3 billion years ago [21]. In
addition to guiding the posttranscriptional modifications
of rRNAs in eukaryotes and Archaea, snoRNAs also interact with spliceosomal RNAs [22], tRNAs [23,24], SL RNAs
in trypanosomes [25], and at least one brain-specific
mRNA in mammals [26]. Recently, snoRNA U50 was
found to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene in prostate
cancer [27]. The existence of substantial numbers of
orphan snoRNAs indicates that snoRNAs also participate
in diverse biological processes that remain to be identified
[4].
SnoRNAs exhibit canonical sequence motifs and structural features. Box C/D snoRNAs carry the conserved box
C (RUGAUGA, where R can be any purine) and D
(CUGA) motifs near their 5' and 3' termini, respectively.
Additionally, the variants of the C and D boxes, designated C' and D' box, are usually present internally [28].
Box H/ACA snoRNAs possess a hairpin-hinge-hairpin-tail
secondary structure and two conserved sequence motifs,
box H and box ACA. The hinge region contains the H box
(ANANNA) and the tail consists of the ACA box located 3
nt before the 3' end [29,30]. The snoRNAs exert their functions by base-pairing with their targets and recruit related
proteins to the sites of modification [31]. Box C/D snoRNAs can form 10-21 basepairs (bp) with multiple cellular
RNAs. The methylated nucleotide in the target RNA is usually positioned 5 nt upstream of the D or D' box of the
snoRNAs, the so called "D/D'+5" rule [6]. In box H/ACA
snoRNAs, two short antisense sequences in one or both of
the two hairpin domains form 9-13 basepairs with rRNA
sequences that flank the target uridine to be converted to
pseudouridine. The pseudouridine is always located 14 to
16 nt upstream from the H box or the ACA box of the
snoRNA [29,30]. These structural and functional features
of box C/D and H/ACA snoRNAs provide the parameters
for identifying snoRNAs and their function.
The genomic organization of snoRNA genes displays great
diversity in different organisms. In vertebrates, almost all
snoRNA genes are located in the introns of host genes,
with a few exceptions, such as U3 which are independently transcribed [4]. In plants and trypanosomatids,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/515

snoRNA genes are present in polycistronic clusters which
encode both C/D and H/ACA snoRNAs [9,17]. A particular genomic organization, the intronic gene cluster, was
first found in rice and then in Drosophila melanogaster
[32,33]. Moreover, a unique genomic organization (dicistronic tRNA-snoRNA genes) has been characterized exclusively in plants [34]. The genomic organization of
snoRNA genes differs largely in fungi. In the budding
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, apart from seven intronic
snoRNA genes, the majority of snoRNA are encoded by
independent genes as well as five polycistronic snoRNA
gene clusters [12]. In contrast, most box C/D snoRNA
genes from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe are
intron-encoded. This raises the question about the
genomic organization and expression modes of snoRNA
genes in the fungus kingdom. It is well known that multicellular fungi dominate the population of fungi. However,
little is known about snoRNAs in multicellular fungi. It
was thus of interest to determine the snoRNA genes from
a multicellular fungi to shed light on these characteristics.
Neurospora crassa is a filamentous fungus sharing key components with animal cells in cellular physiology and
genetics, contributing to the fundamental understanding
of the genome defense system, DNA methylation, posttranscriptional gene silencing, cellular differentiation and
development [35]. As a model eukaryote, the genome of
N. crassa has been completely sequenced [36]. However,
only four box C/D snoRNAs, snR39, snR52, snR60, snR61
(Rfam) were annotated in N. crassa . Recently, we identified three U3 snoRNA genes from N. crassa; each of them
is independently transcribed and contains a small intron
[37](Table 1). It is evident that the majority of the N.
crassa snoRNAs remain to be identified. Meanwhile, a
comparative genome analysis between yeast and multicellular fungi will provide insights into the evolution of
snoRNA genes in the fungus kingdom. In this study, by
combining computational and experimental methods, an
extensive analysis of snoRNA genes from N. crassa was
performed. Here, we present the first comprehensive list
of two major families of snoRNAs from N. crassa , and further discuss the characteristics and evolutionary significance of the snoRNA genes.

Results
Identification of 55 box C/D and 20 box H/ACA snoRNAs
from N. crassa
We initially carried out the genome-wide analysis of snoRNAs from N. crassa by employing the snoscan [12] and
snoGPS programs [13]. From this database search, 89 box
C/D and 131 box H/ACA snoRNA candidates were predicted (see Methods). To validate the snoRNA candidates
and identify more novel snoRNAs from N. crassa , the box
C/D and box H/ACA snoRNA-specific library of N. crassa
were respectively constructed from mixed-stage mycelium

database http://bioinf.scri.sari.ac.uk/cgi-bin/plant_snorna/conservation. S. c snoRNAs and modifications are from the yeast snoRNA database at
UMass-Amberst http://people.biochem.umass.edu/fournierlab/snornadb/main.php. Abbreviation: S. p, S. pombe; S. c, S. cerevisia; A. t, A. thaliana; H. s,

and spores using anchored primers (18, and see Methods). To exclude the highly abundant clones and enrich
the novel RNA species in our analysis, the radiolabelled
oligonucleotides were used to screen the cDNA libraries
(~1800 clones in the box C/D and ~ 4000 clones in box
H/ACA snoRNA libraries). Subsequently, a total of 338
and 278 clones from box C/D and box H/ACA snoRNA
libraries were sequenced, respectively. Taken together, 65
snoRNAs including 45 box C/D (Table 1) and 20 box H/
ACA snoRNAs (Table 2) were identified. Twenty eight box
C/D snoRNAs from the cDNA library were covered by the
snoscan results. However, only three H/ACA snoRNAs
overlapped with snoGPS results. Because the data from
the computational search of H/ACA snoRNAs may
include excessive false-positive candidates, they were not
included for further analyses in this study.
The snoRNA candidates identified by cDNA cloning or the
snoscan program were subsequently confirmed by northern blot and/or reverse transcription analyses. The expression of 27 box C/D and all 20 box H/ACA snoRNAs were
positively detected as expected (Figure 1 and 2). Among
these snoRNAs, the sequence of CD31 snoRNA obtained
from the cDNA cloning appears uncompleted; it corre-

sponds to the second half of CD31 full-length which is
further validated by the northern blotting.
Together, through the combination of computational
analysis and construction of the specialized cDNA libraries, 55 box C/D and 20 box H/ACA snoRNAs were identified and all the snoRNAs are denominated according to
the order of identification (Table 1 and 2).
In most cases (86%) the C and D boxes in snoRNAs are
highly conserved when compared to the consensus
sequence (UGAUGA and CUGA, see Additional file 1).
However, the C' and D' box are nonconserved and exhibit
much more sequence-degeneracy than their C and D box
counterparts. In some instances, the C' and D' box cannot
be unambiguously inferred as a result of the absence of
the functional region. Generally, the box C/D snoRNAs
from N. crassa are similar to their metazoan and yeast
counterparts in size. However, the sizes of box H/ACA
snoRNAs from N. crassa are peculiar. Almost all of them
are larger than 160 nt (Figure 2), reminiscent of some
irregular box H/ACA snoRNAs in S. cerevisiae. These observations show that the N. crassa snoRNAs have their own
unique sequence and structural features (see Additional
file 2 and 3).

Functional properties of the N. crassa box C/D and box H/
ACA snoRNAs
Based on the modification rules of snoRNAs [2] , 55 box
C/D snoRNAs from N. crassa were predicted to direct 71
methylations. These include 64 methylations on rRNAs
which comprise 43 methyls on 26S rRNA, 20 methyls on
18S rRNA and one methyl on 5.8S rRNA (see Additional
file 4A). The remnant seven methylations consist of four
methyls on snRNAs and three methyls on tRNAs (see
Additional file 4B and 4C). Furthermore, the structure and
function elements of U14 which participate in the
processing of pre-rRNA were unambiguously identified.
Interestingly, two different methylated sites were predicted to be guided by the same functional element of a
single snoRNA CD27. Two box C/D snoRNAs (CD53 and
CD55) lack the sequences complementary to either rRNAs
or snRNAs and therefore belong to orphan snoRNAs.
Fourteen box H/ACA snoRNAs were predicted to guide 17
pseudouridine sites of rRNAs (see Additional file 5), and
no pseudouridine sites on snRNAs were predicted. The
remaining six box H/ACA snoRNAs were also classified
into an orphan snoRNA family lacking functional region
complementary to rRNA, tRNA or snRNA. A different

modification pattern appears in N. crassa as compared to
the two yeasts S. cerevisiae, and S. pombe (see discussion)[38,39].
Interestingly, a novel snoRNA, CD29, possesses two guide
elements that can form duplexes with U2 snRNA and 5.8S
rRNA for 2'-O-methylation. Primer extension mapping of
2'-O-methylated nucleotides of the U2 snRNA and 5.8S
rRNA in the presence of low concentration of dNTPs
resulted in stop signals at the G32 and A43 residues, indicating that U2-A31 and 5.8S-A42 are methylated (Figure
3). We have identified cognates of CD29 in other filamentous fungi, however, these cognates only possess the guide
sequence for the methylation of U2 snRNA. This suggests
that CD29 evolves from the snoRNA with a single guide
function. This is reminiscent of the human small Cajal
body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs) that can guide modification of the RNA polymerase II-transcribed snRNAs such as
U2 snRNA. The comparative analyses revealed that CD29
and its homologs in fungi have one functional element
similar to that of human SCARNA9 which was first known
as Z32 (GeneBank accession no. AJ009638), and therefore
was homologous to this human scaRNA. In addition, we

in N. crassa . CD11 has the potential to direct a methylation in U6 snRNA, and two methylations in 18S and 26S
rRNAs, respectively (Figure 3). Interestingly, the CD11 is
also partially similar to mgU6-47 in mammals [40], but
possesses a novel function that can guide a N. crassa-specific methylation on 26S rRNA at A356.

Genomic organization and expression of the snoRNAs in
N. crassa
The genomic organization of the snoRNA genes in N.
crassa exhibits great diversity. Among the 55 box C/D
snoRNAs, forty five snoRNA genes are intron-encoded in
protein-coding or non-coding host genes. The remaining
nine were found in the intergenic regions with a putative
polymerase II promoter upstream and appeared independently transcribed. Meanwhile, six gene clusters that
only encode box C/D snoRNAs were identified from N.
crassa . Interestingly, an exon-encoded snoRNA (CD6)
was identified in the snoRNA gene cluster III in contrast to
another two intron-encoded snoRNAs (CD9 and CD17)
in the same cluster (Figure 5). Of 20 box H/ACA snoRNA
genes, 16 are located in intergenic regions and two are
intron-encoded. In particular, two snoRNA genes (ACA10
and ACA16) are located in the 3' UTR of two hypothetical
protein genes, one of which is similar to phosphoglycerate
mutase. Obviously, different strategies dominate in the
expression of the two families of snoRNA genes in N.
crassa .

and exons, respectively. The number below indicates the
length (in nucleotides) of introns. Thinner lines indicate

In accordance with the mode of one snoRNA per intron in
vertebrates [4], a large proportion of the box C/D snoRNA
genes (45 of 55) are located within introns of the host
genes. The distances from the intronic snoRNA genes to
the 3' splice sites of introns, which has been proven to be
important for the effective processing of intronic snoRNAs
from their host mRNA precursors [41,42], resemble those
in D. melanogaster [32,41,42]. The distances from the
snoRNA genes to the 5' splice sites appear to mainly be
between 41 to 60 nt, similar to those in human[41] (Figure 4).
Remarkably, five (cluster I to V) of the six box C/D
snoRNA gene clusters arehighly conserved between yeast

and N. crassa (Figure 5). Although these host genes were
not well annotated for their introns and exons in the N.
crassa genome, canonical intron splicing sequences were
observed flanking every cluster of snoRNA genes. To further confirm this observation, the mature RNA transcripts
were identified with the expected sizes by cloning and
sequencing of RT-PCR products. It is worth noting that
two snoRNA genes, CD16 and CD37, in the cluster V are
validated to be co-transcribed by RT-PCR and sequencing,
though each of the snoRNA genes in the cluster has a putative promoter upstream. Intriguingly, the putative promoter upstream of CD37, a homologue of U14, would
play a role in guaranteeing and promoting the function of
U14 that has been demonstrated vital in diverse eukaryotes. Our results further revealed that the genomic organization of the host genes for these five clusters is most like
the UHG gene in animals. The host genes of Cluster I to V
only contain short open reading frames with length ranging from 159 bp to 267 bp, suggesting the little potential
for protein coding just like the gas 5 [43].
Unexpectedly, various alternative splicing events were
found in the processing of polycistronic transcripts from
the snoRNA gene clusters I and II by analyzing cDNA
sequences from RT-PCR of the transcripts (Figure 6). In
cluster I, two alternatively spliced transcripts, differing by
the absence of exon 2 or exon 2 plus exon 3 were detected.
The pattern of alternative splicing in the expression of
cluster II was contingent on an alternative 3' splice site
that allows the lengthening or shortening of exon 3.

interesting to compare the pattern of modifications on
target RNAs of N. crassa to those described in the two
yeasts, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe. Among 71 methylations
predicted by the guide snoRNAs in N. crassa , 32 represent
the most highly conserved modifications shared by the
multicellular fungi and the yeasts, and 31 (43.7%) are
modifications that have not yet been reported in other
fungi when compared with the two unicellular yeasts(Figure 7). In the yeasts, only ten and eight methylations are
S. cerevisiae-specific and S. pombe-specific, respectively.
Our results imply a more complex modification pattern in
multicellular fungi than in unicellular yeasts. They also
reveal the high diversity of post-transcriptional modification of RNAs in the fungus kingdom as it has been shown
that about 40% of methylations are species-specific in a
protozoan Trypanosoma [17]. The species-specific modifications highlight the different modification patterns and
their peculiar importance. Although eliminating a single
modification does not have a dramatic effect on the ribosome [44], loss of three to five modifications in an intersubunit bridge of the ribosome (helix 69) impairs growth
and causes broad defects in ribosome biogenesis and
activity [45]. On the other hand, early studies have demonstrated that ribosome modifications play roles in determining antibiotic resistance or sensitivity [15,46]. Thus
the species-specific modifications have potential use in
finding therapeutic targets for prevention and treatment
of diseases caused by some eukaryotic pathogens.
Another interesting observation in this study was the presence of duplexes between box C/D snoRNAs and tRNAs
(tRNATrp and tRNALeu from N. crassa Database). Duplexes
between tRNA and snoRNAs have been also found in C.
elegans [24] and recently in Plasmodium falciparum [47].
tRNA modification guided by snoRNAs has been also
reported in Archaea [23]. This study provides for the first
time a prediction of fungal snoRNAs and their potential

target sites in tRNAs, although these remain to be confirmed by further experiments.
Structural and functional evolution of snoRNAs in fungi
Our study demonstrates the extensive separation and
recombination of functional regions occurring during the
evolution of snoRNA genes in fungi. For instance, the
CD5 snoRNA in N. crassa possesses two conserved guiding
elements. In S. cerevisiae, however, the conserved function
of CD5 is executed by two independent snoRNAs, snR72
and snR78, with a single functional element [48] (Figure
8). This suggests that CD5 may have evolved as a doubleguide snoRNA through recombination of two different
halves of two ancestral single-guide snoRNAs. The other
possibility is that a gene duplication of a double-guide
snoRNA gene in S. cerevisiae led to specialization of each
paralog to only target one modification site followed by
loss of the other guide element for both paralogs. Another
example is CD50 and CD51 that carry a conserved guiding
function for U24 and U24b in S. pombe, respectively. In
contrast, the U24 in S. cerevisiae has two guiding functions. Comparative analyses revealed that the structure
and function of U24 are well conserved among the budding yeast and the flowering plants A. thaliana and rice,
but the homologues of the S. cerevisiae U24 exist as two
independent snoRNAs in other distant eukaryotes, such as
human and mouse [49]. This suggests that U24 snoRNA
gene has evolved in two pathways, with one leading to a
dual functional snoRNA gene and the other separating the
guiding functions and giving rise to two independent
snoRNA genes.

It has been demonstrated the reciprocal evolutionary
change between snoRNA complementary region and their
rRNA target sequence in plants and nematodes[9,24]. Our
analyses indicate that co-evolution between snoRNAs and
rRNAs exists widely in N. crassa (Figure 9) and plays an
important role in preservation of phylogenetic conserved
methylated sites of rRNAs which is essential for protein
synthesis.
RIP may impact on the generation of snoRNA isoforms by
gene duplication and transposition
SnoRNA gene isoforms or variants exist widely in diverse
organisms, particularly in plants. For example, 97 box C/
D snoRNAs with a total of 175 different gene variants were
identified in the A. thaliana genome [50], and 346 gene
variants encoding 120 box C/D snoRNAs were found in
Oryza Sativa [9]. Compared with the plant snoRNAs, only
a paucity of yeast snoRNA paralogs was detected because
of a relatively small compact genome (~12 Mb for S. cerevisiae). The N. crassa genome (~ 40 Mb) is three-fold larger
than that of the yeast; however, most snoRNA genes in
this species are singleton. Why are the snoRNA genes
devoid of isoforms in the N. crassa genome? It is known
that a mutagenic process termed repeat-induced point

mutation (RIP) has a profound impact on N. crassa
genome evolution, which has greatly slowed the creation
of new genes through genomic duplication and resulted
in a genome with an unusually low proportion of closely
related genes [51]. Of the predicted 10082 protein-coding
genes, only six pairs (12 genes) share >80% nucleotide or
amino-acid identities in their coding sequences [36]. RIP
identifies duplications that are greater than ~400 bp (~1
kb in the case of unlinked duplications) and induces C:G
to T:A during the sexual cycle [52,53]. Early studies have
provided clear evidence of retrotransposons inactivated
by RIP [54,55]. The analysis of the N. crassa genome
sequence also revealed a complete absence of intact
mobile elements [36]. Therefore the creation of new genes
including snoRNA genes or their host genes through gene
duplication and transposition seems to be impeded. It has
been proposed that most, if not all paralogs in N. crassa
duplicated and diverged before the emergence of RIP [51].
We have identified three U3 snoRNA gene variants,
NcU3A, NcU3A-2 and NcU3A-3 in N. crassa (37). The

sequence analysis revealed that these molecules have
undergone nucleotide substitutions rather than RIP
according to the calculation method previously reported
[36]. In the case of CD46A and CD46B, we speculate that
the two snoRNA gene isoforms may have duplicated and
diverged before the emergence of RIP.
Alternative splicing in the expression of non-coding RNA
genes with introns
It is well known that alternative splicing is an important
and widespread process where one gene produces more
than one type of mRNA which is then translated into different proteins in multicellular organisms [56]. Bioinformatic analysis indicates that 35-65% of human genes are
involved in alternative splicing, which contributes significantly to human proteome complexity [57,58]. However,
alternative splicing is rarely reported for non-coding RNA
genes which encode multiple introns. In this study, we
identified several alternative splicing events that occurred
in the processing of RNA precursors transcribed from the
snoRNA gene cluster I and II of N. crassa. It has been
reported that the mouse gas5 gene, a non-coding RNA and
snoRNA host gene, had four alternative splicing transcripts [43]. Although different in snoRNA composition,
the snoRNA gene clusters in N. crassa are most like UHG
genes resembling gas5. Our results show that alternative
splicing occurs frequently in the expression of snoRNA
host genes in lower eukaryotes. This lends support to the
concept that alternative splicing may be an ancient mechanism in regulating the expression of both protein-coding
and non-coding RNA genes with introns. More work is
necessary to elucidate the biological significance of the
alternative splicing in the expression of non-coding RNA
genes.

Conclusion
In this study, we report the first extensive identification of
box C/D and box H/ACA snoRNAs from the filamentous
fungus N. crassa using a combination of computational
and experimental method. The repertoire characteristics,
targets, genomic organization and the unique function of
the N. crassa snoRNA genes were extensively compared

with those of potential orthologues in close and distant
organisms such as S. pombe, S. cerevisiae, A. niger, M. grisea,
A. thaliana and H. sapiens . Our results improve annotation of snoRNA genes in the N. crassa genome, an important model filamentous fungus, and provide insights into
the characteristics and evolutionary significance of the
snoRNA genes in the fungus kingdom.

dicted by Broad/Whitehead Institute automatic gene calling software (a combination of manual annotation,
FGENESH, GENEID, and GENEWISE) [36] were removed.
The BLAST program [61] was used to search gene variants
of all novel snoRNA genes to establish the snoRNA gene
isoforms. About 1 kb of flanking sequences of the snoRNA
gene candidates was searched further for possible box C/
D snoRNA genes and additional non-canonical C/D gene
candidates.

Strains and Media
The N. crassa wild-type strain (As 3.1604, purchased from
the China General Microbiological Culture Collection
Center) was used for the construction of the cDNA library
and all RNA analyses. The strain was grown in PSA
medium (2% sucrose, 20% extract of potato) at 30°C. The
Escherichia coli strain TG1 grown in 2YT (1.6% Bacto tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) liquid or solid
medium was used for cloning procedures.

Northern blot analysis
An aliquot of 30 μg total RNA was separated by electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M
urea and electrotransferred onto nylon membrane
(Hybond-N+; Amersham) using semi-dry blotting apparatus (BioRad). After immobilizing RNA using a UV crosslinker, northern blot hybridization was performed as previously described [49].

Construction and screening of cDNA library
We prepared total RNA from N. crassa culture according to
the guanidine thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform procedure
described by Chomoczynski et al [59]. Small RNA (~20
μg) was fractionated by 50% PEG-8000 and 0.5 M NaCl.
The construction of cDNA library were performed as
described previously with minor modifications (see Additional file 6) [60]. After randomly sequencing clones, we
employed dot hybridization to screen the colony PCR
products with P47 and P48 as described by Liu et al. [37]
We sequenced clones exhibiting the lowest hybridization
signal.
Computational identification of box C/D snoRNA genes
Genomic sequences of N. crassa [36] available at http://
www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/neurospora/
Home.html (N. crassa assembly 7) were downloaded and
searched for potential box C/D snoRNAs target rRNA/
snRNA using snoscan [12] with default parameters. Methylated sites prepared for the snoscan included the conserved methylated nucleotides of S. cerevisiae (yeast
snoRNA database), H. sapiens (snoRNA-LBME-db), and D.
melanogaster [32]. The snoscan results were processed by
an in-house developed perl program for candidate selection. A sequence with the following characteristics was
considered as candidate: ① box C motif bit score ≥ 7.48,
box D motif bit score ≥ 8.05, ✍ the guide bit score ≥ 18.65,
the guide sequence and the target sequence can form a
concatenated 10 bp duplex with at most 1 GU pair
allowed, or can form a concatenated 9 bp duplex with
high GC content. ③ if the guide region is adjacent to the
D' box, the length of spaces between box C and guide
sequence must be ≤ 20 bp. If the guide region is adjacent
to the D box, the length of spaces between box C and
guide sequence must be between 40 and 85 bp. ④ total
sequence length between 75 bp and 130 bp, total overall
bit score ≥ 20. The candidates within CDS region pre-

Reverse transcription and mapping of ribose methylation
Reverse transcription was carried out in a 20 μl reaction
mixture containing 15 μg of total RNA and a corresponding 5'-end-labeled primer. After denaturation at 65°C for
5 min and then cooling to 42°C, 200 units of M-MLV
reverse transcriptase (Promega) were added and extension
carried out at 42°C for 1 hour. The cDNA was separated
on an 8% polyacrylamide gel (8 M urea) and then analyzed with an imager.

The mapping of rRNA methylated sites was determined by
primer extension at low dNTP concentrations as described
previously [40,62]. Briefly, the N. crassa 18S and 26S
rDNA were amplified by PCR with the primer pair
Nc18SF/Nc18SR and Nc26SF/Nc26SR, respectively, and
then cloned into the pMD-18T vector (Takara). The plasmid DNA insert was directly sequenced with the same
primer used for reverse transcription and run in parallel
with the reverse transcription reaction on an 8% polyacrylamide gel (8 M urea).
RT-PCR analysis
15 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with 200 U of
M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) using the box C/
D snoRNA gene cluster specific reverse primers (see Additional file 7) in a 20 μl reaction mixture as described
above for reverse transcription and mapping of ribose
methylations. The negative RT control was carried out
without M-MLV reverse transcriptase. We designed two
specific antisense oligonucleotides: the first reverse primer
used in the reverse transcription reaction overlaps the last
several nucleotides of the second reverse primer used in
the PCR reaction to help avoid non-specific PCR products.
After 1 h at 42°C, 2 μl of RT reaction was used for PCR
amplification with the second reverse primer and the corresponding forward primer (see Additional file 7) in a
final volume of 20 μl. The positive PCR control was perPage 10 of 13

formed on N. crassa genomic DNA with the same pair of
primers. Negative PCR control was performed on 2 μl of
the negative control RT reaction with the same pair of
primers. The PCR program: 30 cycles of denaturation (30
s, 94°C), annealing (30 s, 50-55°C), and extension (1-2
min, 72°C), following by a final extension (10 min,
72°C). The PCR product was purified from a 1.5% agarose gel with the QIAquick Gel extraction Kit (QIAGEN)
and cloned into pMD-18T vector (Takara) and transformed into the strain TG1 of E. coli . Positive clones were
subsequently chosen for sequencing.
