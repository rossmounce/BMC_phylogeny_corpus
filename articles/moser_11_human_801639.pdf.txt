Abstract
Background: Plasmalogens are ether phospholipids required for normal mammalian developmental, physiological,
and cognitive functions. They have been proposed to act as membrane antioxidants and reservoirs of
polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as influence intracellular signaling and membrane dynamics. Plasmalogens are
particularly enriched in cells and tissues of the human nervous, immune, and cardiovascular systems. Humans with
severely reduced plasmalogen levels have reduced life spans, abnormal neurological development, skeletal
dysplasia, impaired respiration, and cataracts. Plasmalogen deficiency is also found in the brain tissue of individuals
with Alzheimer disease.
Results: In a human and great ape cohort, we measured the red blood cell (RBC) levels of the most abundant
types of plasmalogens. Total RBC plasmalogen levels were lower in humans than bonobos, chimpanzees, and
gorillas, but higher than orangutans. There were especially pronounced cross-species differences in the levels of
plasmalogens with a C16:0 moiety at the sn-1 position. Humans on Western or vegan diets had comparable total
RBC plasmalogen levels, but the latter group showed moderately higher levels of plasmalogens with a C18:1
moiety at the sn-1 position. We did not find robust sex-specific differences in human or chimpanzee RBC
plasmalogen levels or composition. Furthermore, human and great ape skin fibroblasts showed only modest
differences in peroxisomal plasmalogen biosynthetic activity. Human and chimpanzee microarray data indicated
that genes involved in plasmalogen biosynthesis show cross-species differential expression in multiple tissues.
Conclusion: We propose that the observed differences in human and great ape RBC plasmalogens are primarily
caused by their rates of biosynthesis and/or turnover. Gene expression data raise the possibility that other human
and great ape cells and tissues differ in plasmalogen levels. Based on the phenotypes of humans and rodents with
plasmalogen disorders, we propose that cross-species differences in tissue plasmalogen levels could influence
organ functions and processes ranging from cognition to reproduction to aging.

Background
Several decades after an early report that humans and
Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) have different susceptibilities to atheromatosis [1], it was established that
lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease risks vary
among human and nonhuman primates [2-5]. In agreement with phylogenetic relationships [6-9], human
blood lipid profiles most closely resemble those of their
closest living relatives, the great apes (chimpanzees,

bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans) [10-17] (Figure 1).
Nevertheless, technological limitations restricted the
types of lipids that could be quantified in these early
studies. More comprehensive measurements are important for testing hypotheses that changes in lipid metabolism influenced the evolution of numerous traits in the
human lineage, including those relevant to cognition
and cardiovascular health [18-27].
Plasmalogens are ether-phospholipids present in mammalian plasma and intracellular membranes [28-31].
They comprise about 20% of the phospholipid mass in
humans and chemically differ from more abundant glycerophospholipids as well as other ether phospholipids
by the presence of a vinyl ether bond at the sn-1

position [30-35]. Plasmalogens can differ based on the
chemical group at the sn-1 position (primarily derived
from C16:0, C18:0, and C18:1 fatty alcohols) and the sn2 position (commonly arachidonic acid or docosahexaenoic acid) as well as their head group [36-39] (Figure 2).
The majority of plasmalogens in mammalian tissues
bear ethanolamine (1-O-alk-1’-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerophosphoethanolamine, plasmenylethanolamine) or choline-linked head groups (1-O-alk-1’-enyl-2-acyl-snglycerophosphocholine, plasmenylcholine) [30]. Plasmalogens are especially enriched in nervous and cardiac
tissues as well as the spleen and cells of the immune
system [30]. Genetic deficiency or cellular mislocalization of one of the two peroxisomal enzymes that initiate
plasmalogen biosynthesis, GNPAT and AGPS, results in
the severe disorder rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP) [40-42] (Figure 3). The clinical phenotypes
of human RCDP patients [40-47] and genetically engineered mouse models [32] indicate that plasmalogens
are necessary for normal neurological, skeletal, visual,
respiratory, and reproductive functions. Decreased brain
tissue plasmalogen levels also have been associated with
Alzheimer Disease [48-55], X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy [56,57], and Down syndrome [58].

Here, we address the possibility that plasmalogens
influence species-specific traits among humans and
great apes. We compared red blood cell (RBC) plasmalogen levels and cellular rates of plasmalogen biosynthesis in cohorts of humans and great apes. Human vegan
RBC data were used to assess the effects of meat and
dairy consumption, which are relevant to comparisons
with the mostly plant-eating great apes [24]. Overall, we
observed that human RBC plasmalogen profiles differed
from those of the great apes and provide indirect evidence that this extends to other tissues, which could
affect functions relevant to the evolution of these
species.

Materials and methods

Figure 2 Basic plasmalogen structure. (A) Plasmalogens are glycerophospholipids characterized by the presence of a vinyl-ether linkage at the
sn-1 position and an ester-linkage at the sn-2 position. R1 and R2 represent straight-chain carbon groups. At the sn-1 position, the chemical
moiety highlighted in red is an alkenyl group, which we use to measure plasmalogen abundance and molecular composition. These alkenyl
groups are most commonly derived from C16:0, C18:0, or C18:1 fatty alcohols. The sn-2 position of plasmalogens is occupied typically by
polyunsaturated fatty acids. X represents the head group, typically ethanolamine or choline for plasmalogens. In contrast, (B)
diacylglycerophospholipids have ester-linkages at their sn-1 and sn-2 positions. As above, R1 and R2 represent straight-chain carbon groups and
X represents the head group. Adapted from reference [31].

research. Chimpanzee blood samples were collected at
the Alamogordo Primate Facility. All chimpanzees took
part in daily enrichment activities to maintain psychological well-being. The chimpanzees were maintained
in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of
Animals (U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services,
Public Health Service, Bethesda, MD., 1996). The APF
and its program were fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care, International (AAALAC). Other great
ape bloods were collected at the Zoological Society of
San Diego (ZSSD). The gender and ages of all blood
donors are provided in Additional File 1. Great ape
diets contain fresh fruits, vegetables, and nutritional
biscuits.

Assays were performed as previously described [61].
They are based on the incorporation of 14C-hexadecanol
and 3H-hexadecyl-glycerol into plasmalogens. All processed data are provided in Additional File 4.

RBC lipid profiling

Statistical considerations

Whole blood samples were collected from fasting subjects and stored in EDTA blood collection tubes. RBCs
were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with physiological saline, transferred to freezer vials, flushed with
nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until analysis. RBCs were
thawed briefly before 100 μl aliquots were taken for analysis of the total lipid fatty acid content as their DMAs
by capillary GC with flame ionization detection [59].
Processed data are provided in Additional File 2.

We analyzed all data on the log2 scale. We used analysis
of variance (ANOVA) to compare average blood lipid
data across humans and great apes. Heterogeneity Pvalues are reported for the test that the mean level is
different in at least one of great apes groups, and Wald
P-values for tests comparing the average level in individual non-human primate groups to humans. Under
ANOVA, statistical tests use an estimate of withingroup variation from all samples. Due to the unbalanced

Primary fibroblast cultures

Great ape dermal fibroblasts were obtained from the
ZSSD while human dermal fibroblasts were obtained
from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research or the
Kennedy Krieger Institute. All individuals are thought to
be unrelated. The gender, age, and biopsy site of all
fibroblast donors and corresponding biochemical analyses are provided in Additional File 3. Fibroblasts were
cultured as previously described [60].

Figure 3 Initial steps of plasmalogen biosynthesis. Plasmalogen biosynthesis requires enzymes located in peroxisomes and the endoplasmic
reticulum. The initial step, catalyzed by the peroxisomal enzyme dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase (GNPAT), is the acylation of
dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) at the sn-1 position to form 1-acyl-DHAP [34]. Fatty acyl-CoA reductase (FAR1 and/or FAR2), located on the
cytoplasmic aspect of the peroxisomal membrane, catalyzes the NADPH-dependent conversion of a fatty acyl-CoA to the corresponding fatty
alcohol [33]. The fatty alcohol enters the peroxisome and displaces the sn-1 fatty acid in a reaction catalyzed by alkyl-dihydroxyacetone
phosphate synthase (AGPS), resulting in formation of 1-akyl-DHAP, which has an ether linkage [35]. Subsequent enzymatic steps occur outside
the peroxisome, including the reduction of alkyl-dihydroxyacetone phosphate to alkyl-glycerophosphate, addition of an acyl group in the sn-2
position, desaturation of the alkyl group to an alkenyl group, and addition of choline or ethanolamine head groups [31]. PEX7 is required for the
import of AGPS into peroxisomes and PEX7 mutations, which are the primary cause of RCDP, lead to impaired plasmalogen biosynthesis.

group sizes, this estimate is driven by the variation in
humans and in chimpanzees. Box plots showing the distribution of the data suggest that the equal-variance
assumption is appropriate. For gene expression studies,
we only considered data from oligonucleotide probes
predicted to be perfectly matched to both genomes and
only assigned gene expression scores to probe sets containing at least four such probes [62]. We tested for differential expression using moderated t-tests and F-tests,
as described [63]. All analyses were done using the R
programming language. All processed data are provided
in Additional File 5.

Results
RBC plasmalogen levels are used in diagnostic tests for
human disorders involving impaired plasmalogen biosynthesis [64,65]. To conduct a cross-species comparison of cellular plasmalogen profiles, we measured RBC
plasmalogen levels in a cohort of humans with Western
diets (N = 120), humans with vegan diets for over one
year (N = 16), chimpanzees (N = 46), bonobos (N = 4),
lowland gorillas (N = 7), and Sumatran orangutans (N =
3) (Additional File 1). We measured the levels of the
C16:0, C18:0, and C18:1 chemical moieties most commonly present in the sn-1 position of plasmalogens
based on their dimethyl acetal (DMA) derivatives produced during sample preparation (Methods) (Additional

File 2). Total plasmalogen levels were estimated based
on the sum of C16:0 DMA, C18:0 DMA, and C18:1
DMA levels. Plasmalogen composition was analyzed
based on the levels of specific DMA derivatives.
Human and great ape RBC plasmalogen levels

Total RBC plasmalogen levels differed in the human
Western diet (WD) and vegan groups relative to the
great apes (ANOVA P < 1 × 10-4 for both comparisons)
(Figure 4). Both human diet groups had lower total plasmalogen levels relative to chimpanzees, bonobos, and
gorillas (≥1.3-fold, P < 1 × 10-6 for all six comparisons).
In contrast, total RBC plasmalogen levels in both
human diet groups were elevated relative to orangutans
(1.9-fold, P < 1 × 10-10 for both comparisons).
Human and great ape RBC plasmalogen composition

The C16:0 DMA, C18:0 DMA, and C18:1 DMA levels
from both human diet groups differed from those of the
great apes (ANOVA P < 1 × 10-15 for all six comparisons) (Figure 5A-C). Both human diet groups had substantially lower C16:0 DMA levels relative to
chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas (≥1.9-fold, P < 1 ×
10 -15 for all six comparisons) (Figure 5A), but only
mildly lower C18:0 DMA levels relative to chimpanzees
(≤1.2-fold, P < 0.05) (Figure 5B). Vegans also had lower
C18:0 DMA levels relative to bonobos and gorillas (1.2-

Figure 5 Human and great ape RBC plasmalogen composition. On the left most panels, we provide modified box plots representing the
percentage of the DMA derivatives of (A) C16:0, (B) C18:0, and (C) C18:1 chemical moieties present in the sn-1 position of plasmalogens relative
to total fatty acids (Y-axis) in RBCs. On the rightmost panels, we provide modified box plots representing the ratio of the abundance of (D)
C16:0, (E) C18:0, and (F) C18:1 chemical moieties present in the sn-1 position of plasmalogens with respect to their cognate fatty acids (Y-axis) in
RBCs. These are reported as DMA/FAME ratios since the vinyl either-linked groups and cognate fatty acids are converted to dimethyl acetyl
(DMA) and fatty acid methylester (FAME) derivatives, respectively, after RBC sample processing. In Panel F, C18:1 FAME levels represent the sum
of C18:1 (n-5), C18:1 (n-7), and C18:1 (n-9) FAMEs. C18:1 (n-5) FAME levels could not be measured in one orangutan, consistent with its trace
abundance in the other two orangutans. The numbers and identities of RBC donors (X-axis) is the same as in Figure 2. Animal cohort data are
color-coded as indicated in Figure 4. The star in Panels B, C, and F indicate that the DMA level or DMA/FAME ratio in the human vegan and
Western diet cohort differ (P < 0.05).

fold, P < 0.05 for both comparisons). Both human diet
groups had markedly higher C18:0 DMA and C18:1
DMA levels relative to orangutans (≥2.3-fold, P < 1 ×
10 -12 for both comparisons). The human WD group
also had lower C18:1 DMA levels relative to chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas (≥1.3-fold, P < 1 × 10-3 for
all three comparisons) (Figure 5C).
To address the fact that the identity of the moiety at
the sn-1 position of plasmalogens is influenced by the
cellular levels of related fatty acid levels, we normalized
C16:0, C18:0, and C18:1 DMA levels with respect to
those of their cognate fatty acids. Since fatty acids are
converted to methyl ester (FAME) derivatives after sample processing, we report these as DMA/FAME ratios
(Figure 5D-F). C16:0, C18:0, and C18:1 DMA/FAME
ratios in both human diet groups differed from those of
the great apes (ANOVA P < 1 × 10-6 for all six comparisons). Relative to both human diet groups, the chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas had higher C16:0 and
C18:1 DMA/FAME ratios (≥1.9-fold, P < 1 × 10-9 for all
six comparisons), but the orangutans had lower C18:0
and C18:1 DMA/FAME ratios (≥2.5-fold, P < 1 × 10-14
for all four comparisons) (Figure 5E,F). Also relative to
both human diet groups, the C18:0 DMA/FAME ratio
was lower in chimpanzees (≤1.1-fold, P < 0.05 for both
comparisons), but higher in bonobos and gorillas (1.21.3-fold, P < 0.05 for all four comparisons).
RBC plasmalogen levels and composition relative to
human and chimpanzee gender

peroxisomal plasmalogen
synthesis (relative activity)

Our cohort provided adequate statistical power to
screen for possible sexual dimorphism in human (WD

group) and chimpanzee plasmalogen levels and composition. No significant (>1.1-fold, P < 0.05) sex-specific
differences in total DMA levels, specific DMA levels, or
DMA/FAME ratios were found within this cohort of
chimpanzees or humans. Nevertheless, human males
had a slightly higher (1.1-fold, P < 0.05) C16:0 DMA/
FAME ratio relative to human females.
Human RBC plasmalogen levels in the vegan and Western
diet (WD) groups

The human vegan and WD groups showed no significant differences in total plasmalogen or C16:0 DMA
levels or their C16:0 and C18:0 DMA/FAME ratios (P >
0.05) (Figures 4 and 5). Nevertheless, C18:0 DMA levels
were slightly higher (1.1-fold, P < 0.01) for the WD
group. Vegans had higher C18:1 DMA level and C18:1
DMA/FAME ratios relative to the WD group (1.3-1.4fold elevated, P < 1 × 10-2 for both comparisons).
Cellular rates of peroxisomal plasmalogen biosynthesis

Cultured skin fibroblasts are used in clinical settings to
measure cellular plasmalogen levels, rates of plasmalogen
synthesis, and other peroxisomal functions [61,66-68]
(Additional File 3). We used this system to show that the
rates of the peroxisomal component of plasmalogen biosynthesis, recently suggested to regulate the entire biosynthetic pathway [69], differed in human relative to
great ape cultured skin fibroblasts (ANOVA P = 2.2 ×
10 -4 ) (Figure 6) (Additional File 4). These rates were
greater in human relative to bonobo (1.4-fold, P = 3.6 ×
10 -6 ), gorilla (1.3-fold, P = 6.7 × 10 -4 ), and orangutan
(1.3-fold, P = 2.8 × 10-3) skin fibroblasts. No differences

were found between human and chimpanzee skin
fibroblasts.
Comparative transcriptomics of peroxisomal plasmalogen
biosynthetic pathways

We re-analyzed existing gene expression data [70] from
human and chimpanzee livers, brains, kidneys, heart,
and testes to begin to explore the possibility that crossspecies differences in plasmalogen composition occur in
these tissues (Methods). We focused on genes described
in Figure 3 that are specifically involved in the initial
steps of plasmalogen biosynthesis [30,69] and identified
differentially expressed genes (DEGs), as stated in the
Figure 7 legend. Cross-species DEGs varied according to
the tissue examined (Figure 7 and Additional File 5).
For example, all the DEGs in brain (AGPS, FAR1, and
FAR2 transcripts) and heart (AGPS and PEX7 transcripts) were more abundant in humans relative to
chimpanzees. In contrast, all the DEGs in kidney (AGPS,
GNPAT, and PEX7 transcripts) and liver (AGPS and
PEX7 transcripts) were more abundant in chimpanzees
relative to humans. In testes, humans showed 3.2-fold
increases in AGPS, but 1.9-fold reductions in GNPAT
transcript levels, relative to chimpanzees. FAR1 and
PEX7 transcripts were also more abundant in human
relative to chimpanzee testes.

Discussion
Plasmalogens have had a complex evolutionary history
with differing biosynthetic pathways in aerobic and
anaerobic organisms [71]. Their levels are also known to
vary among mammals. For example, human, rat, and
guinea pig plasmalogen levels differ in multiple tissues
[72] Furthermore, the higher tissue plasmalogen levels
in long relative to short-lived rodents has been

suggested confer a lower susceptibility to oxidative
membrane damage and contribute to an extended lifespan [29]. Considering how plasmalogen deficits impact
human and rodent health, they represent intriguing candidate molecules that could contribute to developmental, physiological, and cognitive differences among
humans and great apes.
We observed striking differences in human and great
ape RBC plasmalogens. For example, both human diets
groups had lower RBC total plasmalogen levels relative
to the African great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, and
gorillas), but higher RBC total plasmalogen levels relative to orangutans (Figure 4). Most notably, RBC plasmalogens with a C16:0 moiety at their sn-1 position
were considerably more abundant in African great apes
relative to both human diet groups and orangutans,
which had similar levels (Figure 5 A, D). The diverse
plasmalogen profiles in our cohort highlight the importance of including all four great ape species in comparative studies with humans in order to avoid spurious
inferences. Adaptations that occurred in each lineage,
especially those related to their historic diets, could
make it challenging to infer ancestral states.
We favor the hypothesis that cross-species differences
in plasmalogen metabolism are responsible for the distinctions between human and great ape RBC plasmalogen profiles. Although open to discussion [30], recent
evidence suggests that plasmalogen biosynthesis in regulated by the peroxisomal component of this pathway
[69]. In this regard, we observed small differences in the
rates of peroxisomal plasmalogen biosynthesis in human
relative to other great ape skin fibroblasts (Figure 6).
These studies should be replicated and expanded in
order to examine rigorously intraspecies variation, plasmalogen composition, and the ER component of plasmalogen biosynthesis. Likewise, cross-species differences

in plasmalogen turnover rates could have influenced our
results. In this regard, plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 (PLA2) can release the sn-2 fatty acid to yield
lysoplasmalogens [30,31,73], which can be degraded by
lysoplasmalogenases or acylated to produce intact plasmalogens [73-78]. Although lysoplasmalogen levels can
increase after stress [79,80], they are generally thought
to be of minor abundance relative to intact plasmalogens. To the best of our knowledge, RBC plasmalogen
half-lives have not been reported, but the turnover rates
of RBC membrane phospholipids is relatively slow compared to other organs, such as liver [64]. Nevertheless,
rat brain ethanolamine and choline plasmalogens have
short, but different, half-lives [31,49,81].
Another candidate explanation for our observations is
that humans and great apes differ in their ability to
derive plasmalogens from dietary sources. Plasmalogens
are present in substantial amounts in meat and fish products commonly found in Western diets [82]; however,
they are rarely found in plants [83,84]. Wild great apes
are mainly plant-eating and our captive population is
not exposed to significant amounts of meat products
based on their diets, which we previously showed have
very low levels of phytanic acid, a sensitive biomarker of
ruminant fats, dairy, and certain fish products [24]. We
found that the human WD and vegan groups had quite
similar RBC plasmalogen levels and composition (Figures 4 and 5). Even the moderately higher C18:1 DMA
levels in the vegan group did not alter the conclusions
from cross-species comparisons involving C18:1 DMA/
FAME ratios. This is in broad agreement with other studies wherein RBC plasmalogen levels did not change in
a limited number of humans on corn oil, triolein, or
butter fat-enriched diets [85,86]. Nevertheless, modest
increases in C18:1 ethanolamine plasmalogen RBC levels
occurred in subjects on a triolein-enriched diet [85].
Animal models have produced a complex picture of
how diet influences tissue plasmalogens [87-105]. Rats
consuming unnaturally high levels of plasmalogens
(>10% by weight) showed elevated blood plasma and
liver plasmalogen levels; however, their RBC, skeletal
muscle, brain, kidney, lung, or adipose tissue plasmalogen levels were not significantly altered [89]. Alkylglycerols (AGs) are natural products present in human
and other mammalian diets that can be incorporated
into plasmalogens and influence the identity of the
chemical group at the sn-1 position [88,106]. Nevertheless, AG consumption only has a minor influence on
total plasmalogen levels in tissues from whole animals
[107,108]. While the AG dietary levels are not welldefined, one report [88] suggests that adults can daily
consume 10-100 mg of batyl alcohol, a type of AG
especially abundant in shark liver oil [109]. Dietary
fatty alcohols obtained from certain vegetables and fish

Page 9 of 14

could also affect the identity of the chemical group at
the sn-1 position [30]. Nevertheless, the strong similarities between the vegan and WD group plasmalogen
profiles suggest that differences in AG and/or fatty
alcohol consumption did not significantly influence
our results.
Age is another factor reported to affect RBC plasmalogens. In a cohort of younger (25-39 years old) and older
(average 79 years old) humans, RBC 16:0 DMA levels
did not correlate with age, but small age-related
decreases in RBC C18:0 DMA levels were observed
(0.04% per decade) [110]. Nevertheless, although our
human WD group is older on average than our vegan
group (51 vs 35 years), the former has slightly elevated
C18:0 DMA levels relative to the latter. Considering
cross-species differences in life expectancies [111-115],
the age composition of our human and great ape
cohorts is relatively uniform (Additional File 1).We also
note that the C16:0 and C18:0 DMA/FAME ratios in
both our human diet groups are in good agreement
with those reported for neonates and children [116].
While we cannot preclude that donor age influenced
our results, we suggest that these effects are minor compared to those related to donor species.
In efforts to explore the possibility that differences in
plasmalogen levels and composition extend to other tissues, we found that key genes specifically involved in
their biosynthesis were differentially expressed in human
and chimpanzee organs (Figure 7). The higher abundance of FAR1, FAR2, and AGPS transcripts in human
relative to chimpanzee brain is especially interesting
since plasmalogens comprise almost 30% of the glycerophospholipids in the adult human brain and up to 70%
of human myelin sheath ethanolamine glycerophospholipids [49]. Our gene expression analyses suggest the possibility of cross-species differences in brain plasmalogen
levels and/or composition that could have a special
impact on the brain’s white matter, which is critical for
cognitive processes [117]. The potential significance of
white matter volumes in human and non-human primate brain evolution has been discussed [118-122]. The
proposed antioxidant properties of plasmalogens [30,31]
could be especially important in human brains, which
have higher metabolic demands than those of chimpanzees and other non-human primates (NHPs) [123]. The
DEGs in testes are intriguing given male infertility in
mice with plasmalogen defects [124], variation in mammalian spermatozoa phospholipid composition [125],
and differences in human and great ape male reproductive systems [126]. Since comparatively less is known
about the role of plasmalogens in kidney and liver function, we simply note multiple instances of higher plasmalogen biosynthesis-related transcript levels in
chimpanzees relative to humans.

Moser et al. Lipids in Health and Disease 2011, 10:101
http://www.lipidworld.com/content/10/1/101

Although we cannot make definitive conclusions about
the physiological ramifications of the cross-species differences observed in our studies, specific clinical phenotypes have been associated human RBC plasmalogen
levels and composition [127-133]. For example, it was
reported that hyperlipidemic individuals had 20%
reduced RBC ethanolamine plasmalogen levels relative
to healthy controls [127]. Furthermore, significant
inverse correlations have been found between human
RBC C16:0 DMA/FAME ratios and total cholesterol, triglycerides, body fat mass, and glycosylated hemoglobin
[128]. Reduced RBC C16:0 and C18:0 DMA/FAME
ratios were also associated with human malnutrition
[128]. It is formally possible that the observed differences in plasmalogen levels and composition relate to
differences in cholesterol regulation in humans, captive
chimpanzees, and possibly other captive NHPs [21].
Furthermore, it is tempting to speculate that low RBC
total plasmalogen levels in orangutans relate to the basal
metabolic rate of this species, which is lower than those
of humans and chimpanzees [134,135]. Given their antioxidant properties, an increased plasmalogen levels
could be beneficial for species with higher metabolic
rates.
Although caution must be taken when using human
medical data to interpret genetic and biochemical differences among human and NHPs, this approach is useful
for generating hypotheses, which can be tested in appropriate cell culture and/or laboratory animal models
[136-140]. It also will be necessary to measure the levels
of distinct plasmalogens in multiple human and NHP
cell types and tissues in order to refine and test these
hypotheses. Comparative analyses of the human and
NHP nervous, cardiovascular, and reproductive systems
are especially relevant given the phenotypes of humans
and mice with severely impaired plasmalogen biosynthesis. The application and further development of lipidomic tools and technologies will play a vital role in this
process [141].

Conclusions
We observed robust differences in RBC total plasmalogen levels and composition among humans and great
apes. Our favored hypothesis is that cross-species differences in plasmalogen metabolism are responsible for
the distinctions between human and great ape RBC
plasmalogen profiles. In contrast to these speciesrelated differences, the human diets studied had lesser
impacts on RBC plasmalogen composition and none
on total plasmalogen levels. Likewise, we did not
observe robust sex-specific differences in human or
chimpanzee RBC plasmalogen levels or composition.
Gene expression profiles raise the possibility that other
human and great ape cells and tissues differ in

Page 10 of 14

plasmalogen levels, which could influence developmental, physiological, and cognitive functions relevant to
the evolution of these species.
