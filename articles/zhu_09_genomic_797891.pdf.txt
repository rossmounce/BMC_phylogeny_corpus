Abstract
Background: Baculoviruses are well known for their potential as biological agents for controlling
agricultural and forest pests. They are also widely used as expression vectors in molecular cloning
studies. The genome sequences of 48 baculoviruses are currently available in NCBI databases. As
the number of sequenced viral genomes increases, it is important for the authors to present
sufficiently detailed analyses and annotations to advance understanding of them. In this study, the
complete genome of Clanis bilineata nucleopolyhedrovirus (ClbiNPV) has been sequenced and
analyzed in order to understand this virus better.
Results: The genome of ClbiNPV contains 135,454 base pairs (bp) with a G+C content of 37%,
and 139 putative open reading frames (ORFs) of at least 150 nucleotides. One hundred and twentysix of these ORFs have homologues with other baculovirus genes while the other 13 are unique to
ClbiNPV. The 30 baculovirus core genes are all present in ClbiNPV. Phylogenetic analysis based on
the combined pif-2 and lef-8 sequences places ClbiNPV in the Group II Alphabaculoviruses. This
result is consistent with the absence of gp64 from the ClbiNPV genome and the presence instead
of a fusion protein gene, characteristic of Group II. Blast searches revealed that ClbiNPV encodes
a photolyase-like gene sequence, which has a 1-bp deletion when compared with photolyases of
other baculoviruses. This deletion disrupts the sequence into two small photolyase ORFs,
designated Clbiphr-1 and Clbiphr-2, which correspond to the CPD-DNA photolyase and FADbinding domains of photolyases, respectively.
Conclusion: ClbiNPV belongs to the Group II Alphabaculoviruses and is most closely related to
OrleNPV, LdMNPV, TnSNPV, EcobNPV and ChchNPV. It contains a variant DNA photolyase gene,
which only exists in ChchNPV, TnSNPV and SpltGV among the baculoviruses.

Background

Results and discussion

Baculoviruses are a large group of rod-shaped, enveloped
viruses with circular, covalently closed, double-stranded
DNA genomes. These viruses are pathogenic to arthropods, mainly insects within the orders Lepidoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera [1,2]. According to morphology of
the virus occlusion bodies (OBs), the family Baculoviridae
comprises two genera: the Nucleopolyhedroviruses
(NPVs) and Granuloviruses (GVs). The lepidopteron
NPVs can be further divided into two sub-groups on the
basis of their envelope fusion proteins, which are essential
for the spread of infection in the insect and are required
for efficient virus budding. Group I NPVs possess proteins
related to GP64, whereas no GP64 homologues have been
identified in Group II NPVs [3,4]. Instead, members of
Group II encode homologues of LD130 proteins, also
known as Fusion (F) proteins [5]. The taxonomy of the
Baculoviridae genera has recently been changed on the
basis of the hosts. There are now four genera: the Alphabaculoviruses (lepidopteron-specific NPV), Betabaculoviruses (lepidopteron-specific GV), Gammabaculoviruses
(hymenopteron-specific NPV), and Deltabaculoviruses
(dipteron-specific baculovirus) [6].

Nucleotide sequence analysis of the ClbiNPV genome
The genome of ClbiNPV has a size of 135,454 bp [GenBank: DQ504428], slightly smaller than that of Spodoptera
exigua NPV (SeMNPV, 135,611 bp) [15]. ClbiNPV has a
highly AT rich genome. Its overall G+C content is 37%,
similar to that recorded for Agrotis segetum GV (AgseGV)
and Ecotropis obliqua NPV (EcobNPV) [16], and higher
only than those of Adoxophyes honmai NPV (AdhoNPV,
35%) [17] and Adoxophyes orana NPV (AdorNPV, 34%)
among the Alphabaculovirus (see Additional file 1).

In recent years, much research has focused on baculoviruses owing to their potential as agents for biological control of pests in agriculture and forestry [7]. Furthermore,
they can be used as efficient expression vectors of foreign
genes [8,9]. Forty-eight completely-sequenced baculovirus genomes, including 34 Alphabaculoviruses, 10 Betabaculoviruses,
3
Gammabaculoviruses
and
1
Deltabaculovirus (see Additional file 1), with sizes ranging from 81,755 base pairs (bp) in Neodiprion lecontei NPV
(Nele NPV) [10] to 178,733 bp in Xestia c-nigrum GV (XecnGV) [11], have been made available in GenBank since
the Autographa californica NPV (AcMNPV) genome
sequence was reported [12].
Clanis bilineata (Walker), belonging to Lepidoptera Sphingidae, is a major agricultural pest causing considerable damage to soybean production in China. No baculovirus able
to infect C. bilineata larvae was reported until 2006 [13],
when a novel baculovirus named Clanis bilineata nucleopolyhedrovirus (ClbiNPV) was isolated and purified
from the larvae of the sphingid C. bilineata infected with
NPV. Transmission electron micrographs showed that this
virus occludes single-enveloped nucleocapsids and hence
is an SNPV [14]. The ClbiNPV genome comprises 135,454
bp and codes for 139 putative open reading frames
(ORFs) with a minimum size of 150 nucleotides. In this
report, we present the complete sequence and organization of the ClbiNPV genome and compare them to other
baculoviruses through genomic and phylogenetic analyses.

According to convention [18], the adenine residue at the
translational ATG start codon of the polyhedrin gene
(polh) was considered to be nucleotide number 1 of the
genome, and successive nucleotides were numbered in the
direction of the polh gene (see Additional file 2). Analysis
of the ClbiNPV genome sequence led to the identification
of 139 putative ORFs with 50 or more amino acids and
minimal overlapping of adjacent ORFs. There are 60 ORFs
with the same orientation as the polyhedrin gene, and 79
with the reverse orientation. Within 150 bp upstream of
the ATG start codon, 34 ClbiNPV ORFs have baculovirus
early promoter motifs (CAGT), 51 have late promoter
motifs (TAAG), and 29 carry both these motifs.
Of the 139 ClbiNPV ORFs identified, 126 are homologous to at least one other baculovirus, and the 30 core
genes that are probably shared by all baculoviruses are
conserved in the ClbiNPV genome [19]. Thirteen ORFs
(Clbi5, Clbi6, Clbi18, Clbi31, Clbi35, Clbi42, Clbi47,
Clbi49, Clbi56, Clbi57, Clbi70, Clbi75 and Clbi129) are
unique to ClbiNPV; they account for 9% of the whole
genome. Three baculovirus-repeated ORFs (bro genes)
were identified in ClbiNPV (ORF55, 115 and 131) and
were designated bro-a, bro-b and bro-c, respectively, based
on their order in the genome. No typical homologous
regions (hrs) were detected in ClbiNPV, which is similar
to Chrysodeixis chalcites NPV (ChchNPV). The relative locations of these ORFs are shown diagrammatically in linear
format in Figure 1. Their orientations, sizes and other
details are shown in Additional file 2.
Phylogenetic analyses and gene content
The sequences of individual baculovirus genes such as
polyhedrin/granulin (polh), DNA polymerase, egt and gp41
have previously been used for phylogenetic analysis [1].
Among those conserved baculovirus genes, pif-2 (ac22 in
AcMNPV), encoding a per os infectivity factor, and lef-8,
encoding a subunit of the baculovirus RNA polymerase,
proved to be particularly reliable baculovirus markers for
phylogenetic analyses at the virus family level [2]. A combined phylogenetic analysis of the pif-2 and lef-8
sequences further showed a clear, highly-supported classification among the four genera, and Alphabaculoviruses

(lepidopteron-specific NPV) can be subdivided into
Groups I and II. Phylogenetic analysis placed ClbiNPV in
Group II (Figure 2). ORF 139 in the ClbiNPV genome
encodes a typical F protein, and ClbiNPV does not encode
GP64, which is consistent with its classification as a
Group II Alphabaculovirus.

Overlapping ORF pairs in the sequenced
Alphabaculovirusgenomes
Overlapping ORFs in ClbiNPV were searched and 26 pairs
were found. The overlapping ORF pairs in all sequenced
Alphabaculovirus genomes were further analysed (see
Additional file 3).

The gene order of ClbiNPV was compared to AcMNPV
[12], OrleNPV and LdMNPV [20] by gene parity plots
[21]. ClbiNPV shared 102, 108 and 101 ORFs with AcMNPV, OrleNPV and LdMNPV, respectively. In general,
gene order is conserved between ClbiNPV and LdMNPV,
and between ClbiNPV and OrleNPV, although three
inverted areas, involving Clbi25-32, Clbi43-60 and
Clbi132-139, are identified when compared with
OrleNPV. The genomes appear less collinear than AcMNPV (Figure 3).

In Group I Alphabaculoviruses, the numbers of overlapping ORF pairs range from 21 (BmNPV) to 42 (AgMNPV).
Except for ac68/ac69 and ac73/ac74 in OpMNPV, and
ac43/ac44 in HycuNPV, nine (ac43/ac44, ac68/ac69, ac73/
ac74, ac80/ac81, ac81/ac82, ac82/ac83, ac95/ac96, ac98/
ac99 and ac102/ac103) appear in all Group I Alphabaculoviruses.
In Group II Alphabaculoviruses, the numbers of overlapping ORF pairs range from 18 (EcobNPV and OrleNPV) to
42 (AgipMNPV). Except for several NPVs, six overlapping

ORF pairs (ac53a/ac54, ac57/ac59, ac67/ac68, ac80/ac81,
ac82/ac83, ac89/ac90) are conserved, and four pairs (ac81/
ac82, ac95/ac96, ac98/ac99 and ac102/ac103) exist in all
Group II Alphabaculoviruses.
Altogether, overlapping ORF pairs ac81/ac82, ac95/ac96,
ac98/ac99 and ac102/ac103 were conserved in all Group I
and Group II Alphabaculoviruses. These overlapping ORF
pairs are from the coding regions of ac81, tlp20, helicase,
ac96, 38K, lef-5, p12 and p45, most of which have conserved functions in NPVs.
It was interesting that the numbers of overlapping ORFs in
all Alphabaculoviruses were consistent with the phylogenetic tree constructed using the combined pif-2 and lef-8
sequences, meaning that closely-related NPVs have similar numbers of overlapping ORF pairs.
DNA photolyase-like gene sequence with a 1-bp deletion
DNA photolyase is a monomeric protein that directly
repairs lethal and carcinogenic UV-induced DNA lesions.
It has been found in a variety of pathogens and other
organisms [22]. However, among the baculoviruses, this
enzyme exists only in ChchNPV [23,24], Trichoplusia ni
NPV (TnSNPV) [25] and Spodoptera litura granulovirus
(SpltGV).

The complete ClbiNPV genome sequence analysis
revealed the presence of a photolyase-like gene sequence
1,694 bp in length, which has the highest similarity to
ChchNPV phr-2 using translated BLAST searches. Compared with photolyases among baculoviruses, it is interesting that there was a 1-bp deletion mutation (Figure 4).

Clbiphr-1

Clbi57

TTA

50688

In order to confirm this deletion, we analyzed the DNA
fragment library of ClbiNPV. There were seven colonies
including the region with the mutation, and they all contained the 1-bp deletion. To ensure that this mutation was
genuinely present in the original sample, PCR and
sequencing of the gene region around this mutation were
performed using the original ClbiNPV DNA. The sequencing results confirmed that the mutation occurred in this
region. This 1-bp deletion mutation disrupted the
sequence into two small ORFs, labelled phr-1 (Clbi58)
and phr-2 (Clbi59) on the basis of their position in the
ClbiNPV genome relative to the polyhedrin gene (Figure
4). The ORF of Clbiphr-1, corresponding to the 3' end of
ChchNPV phr-2, is 306 bp long and encodes a polypeptide
of 101 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of
12.1 kDa. An early baculoviral transcription initiation
motif (CAGT) was found 48 bp upstream of the putative
translational start site (ATG), suggesting that Clbiphr-1
might be an early gene. In addition, a GATA motif (TGATAA) was found at position -129 bp relative to the translational start codon and might be involved in the
transcriptional regulation of this gene. Clbiphr-2, corresponding to the 5' portion of ChchNPV phr-2, is 1,119 bp
long and encodes a polypeptide of 372 amino acids with
a predicted molecular mass of 42.0 kDa. No motifs characteristic of early (CAGT) or late (TAAG) baculovirus transcription initiation were found in the sequence upstream
of Clbiphr-2. Two poly(A) motifs (AATAAA) are present at
the end of the ORF of Clbiphr-2. Both the cyclobutane
pyrimidine dimer (CPD)-DNA photolyase domain and
the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding domain,
characteristic of photolyases, are conserved in the
ClbiNPV sequence. The CPD-DNA photolyase domain is

located between amino acids 1 to 89 in Clbiphr-1, and an
FAD-binding domain is located between amino acids 121
and 287 in Clbiphr-2.
Baculoviruses are attractive candidates for biological control of insect pests [26-28]. One major factor limiting their
successful use in biological control is their sensitivity to
inactivation by ultraviolet (UV) radiation [29]. The most
significant cellular target of UV is DNA. When DNA is
exposed to UV, it is damaged by producing pyrimidine
dimers [30], which may block the activities of DNA or
RNA polymerases and result in nucleotide misincorporation or inhibit polymerase progression during DNA replication or transcription [31-34]. DNA photolyase is a
photo-reactivating enzyme that can repair the toxic effects
of UV-induced DNA damage. van Oers et al. [23] suggested that the presence of a CPD-DNA photolyase gene
in ChchNPV might be a remnant of the evolutionary history of baculoviruses, or a recent adaptation to a current
ecological niche in Chrysodeixis chalcites or an alternative
host, which might have given ChchNPV a competitive
advantage. However, the functional significance of this
gene in ChchNPV infection has not been proved. We analyzed the photolyase genes in baculoviruses and found
that they are almost all early genes expressed before virus
DNA replication. Therefore, we speculate that baculovirus
photolyases might play a critical role in repairing DNA
damage caused by UV, enabling the replication of virus
DNA to complete successfully. In ClbiNPV genome, the
photolyase-like gene sequence was split into two ORFs by
the 1-bp deletion. However, at present, we cannot give
direct evidence that this mutant affects the function, since
no insect cell line permitting ClbiNPV infection has been
found. Our further research will focus on confirming the
expression pattern of the ClbiNPV photolyase gene and
detecting photolyase activity in baculoviruses.

Conclusion
Our preliminary studies on host range showed that
ClbiNPV infects the larvae of Clanis bilineata tiainglauica
Mell, Ampelophaga rubiginosa Bremer and Grey, Theretra
odenlandiae (Fabricius) and Pergesa elpenor lewisil, and thus
could be a candidate biological control agent for a broad
spectrum of pests.
ClbiNPV is a Group II Alphabaculovirus and encodes 139
ORFs. Twenty-eight of these are best matched with the
ORFs of OrleNPV, while 11 have the highest identities
with LdMNPV, TnSNPV and AgseNPV. The numbers of
ORFs best-matched with ChchNP, SfMNPV and EcobNPV
are 8, 8 and 7, respectively. This coincides with the results
of multi-alignment, phylogenetic analysis and the analyses of overlapping ORF pairs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/91

We also found a variant DNA photolyase-like gene
sequence, which has a 1-bp deletion when compared with
photolyases of other baculovirus. This deletion disrupted
the sequence into two small photolyase ORFs, which correspond to the CPD-DNA and FAD-binding domains of
photolyases, respectively. DNA photolyase may reduce
lethal or mutagenic effects caused by ultraviolet radiation.
This enzyme is present in the genomes of many species
ranging from bacteria and yeasts to aplacental mammals
such as the opossum [22,35]. In contrast, among the baculoviruses, it has been found only in ChchNPV, TnSNPV,
SpltGV and ClbiNPV. Studies have shown that one major
factor limiting the successful use of baculoviruses in biological control is their sensitivity to inactivation by UV
radiation. The existence of DNA photolyase in these four
baculovirus might have played an important role in their
evolution and may reduce UV inactivation when applied
in the field. However, further investigations are needed to
understand the actual functional mechanism of this
enzyme in baculoviruses.

Methods
Viruses
The occluded viruses were isolated from C. bilineata larva
showing features typical of a nucleopolyhedrovirus infection in the field in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province.
Purification of polyhedral inclusion bodies (PIBs)
The C. bilineata larva corpse was homogenized and
diluted with sterilized double-distilled water. The dilution
was filtered through three layers of cheesecloth to eliminate particulates. The filtrate was diluted with 50 mM Tris
(pH 7.0) and centrifuged at 1,000 g for 5 min. The pellet
was resuspended in Tris solution and again centrifuged at
1,000 g for 5 min. The dilution and centrifuging steps
were repeated three times and the pellet was resuspended
in Tris. SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) was added to the
suspension to a final concentration of 0.2%, then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently, the
suspension was washed several times with Tris by following the above-mentioned steps. Finally, the pellet was
resuspended in Tris solution.
Preparation of nucleopolyhedrovirus DNA
The purified NPV PIBs were suspended in lysis buffer containing 0.1 M Na2CO3, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.01 M EDTA
(pH 10.8) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min
to dissolve the polyhedra. The pH of the suspension was
adjusted to 8.0 with 10% acetic acid. Subsequently, SDS
and proteinase K were added to final concentrations of
0.5% and 50 mg l-1, respectively, and incubated at 37Â°C
overnight. The digested solution was extracted progressively with phenol, phenol and chloroform mixture, and
chloroform, and DNA was precipitated with ethanol at a
final concentration of 65%. The DNA was further purified

DNA sequencing
A DNA fragment library of ClbiNPV was constructed
through the shotgun method and the positive clones were
sequenced by the Chinese National Human Genome
Center at Shanghai. The purified viral DNA was sheared
using an ultrasonic processor and blunt-ended using T4
DNA polymerase (TaKaRa). Fragments ranging from 1.6
to 4 kb were recovered from an agarose gel and ligated
into the Sma I restriction site of pUC18. The ligation products were transformed into Escherichia coli DH10B by electroporation and the bacteria were grown on LB agar
containing ampicillin, X-gal and IPTG. Recombinant colonies were picked randomly and DNA templates for
sequencing were prepared using the 96-well plasmid
preparation method. Both ends of the plasmid were
sequenced using an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer and six-fold
coverage of viral DNA was obtained in this shotgun
sequencing strategy.
Sequence analysis
ORFs were identified using ORF finder http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf. All BLAST searches were
done through the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) websites. The phylogenetic tree for
baculoviruses was based on the combined pif-2 and lef-8
sequences of the 48 baculoviruses, which were completely
sequenced at the time of analysis, and the phylogenies
were calculated using ClustalW alignments and MEGA4.0
(molecular evolutionary genetics analysis) software. Gene
Parity Plot analysis was performed on the ClbiNPV
genome versus the genomes of AcMNPV, LdMNPV and
OrleNPV, as described previously [21,36].
