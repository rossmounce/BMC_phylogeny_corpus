SHORT REPORT

Open Access

A molecular phylogeny of Hypnales (Bryophyta)
inferred from ITS2 sequence-structure data
Benjamin Merget, Matthias Wolf*

Abstract
Background: Hypnales comprise over 50% of all pleurocarpous mosses. They provide a young radiation
complicating phylogenetic analyses. To resolve the hypnalean phylogeny, it is necessary to use a phylogenetic
marker providing highly variable features to resolve species on the one hand and conserved features enabling a
backbone analysis on the other. Therefore we used highly variable internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences
and conserved secondary structures, as deposited with the ITS2 Database, simultaneously.
Findings: We built an accurate and in parts robustly resolved large scale phylogeny for 1,634 currently available
hypnalean ITS2 sequence-structure pairs.
Conclusions: Profile Neighbor-Joining revealed a possible hypnalean backbone, indicating that most of the
hypnalean taxa classified as different moss families are polyphyletic assemblages awaiting taxonomic changes.

Background
Pleurocarpous mosses, which are mainly found in tropical forests, account for more than 50% of all moss species [1,2]. Brotherus in 1925 used morphological
characters to partition the pleurocarpous into three
orders. These were Leucodontales (= Isobryales), Hookeriales and Hypnobryales (= Hypnales) [3]. Later molecular analyses showed that the order Leucodontales,
which was mainly defined by reduced peristomes, is
polyphyletic due to convergent evolution [1,4]. The current concept divides the pleurocarpous mosses into: (1)
the subclass Hypnidae (consisting of (i) The Ptychomniales with roughly 100 species, (ii) the Hookeriales with
roughly 750 species and (iii) the Hypnobryales or Hypnales containing about 4,400 species), (2) the hypnodendroid pleurocarps (consisting of Hypnodendraceae,
Racopilaceae, Cyrtopodaceae, Pterobryellaceae and
Spiridentaceae) and (3) the rhizogonian mosses (Rhizogoniaceae, as well as several other species). The hypnodendroid pleurocarps and rhizogonian mosses, however,
also include non-pleurocarpous mosses [2,5,6]. Hypnales
comprise over 50% of all pleurocarpous mosses. This
study analyzed the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2)
sequence-structure pairs from 35 hypnalean families

encompassing a total of 1,634 species in order to test
the hypothesis that the ITS2 sequence-structure can be
used to determine the phylogeny of Hypnales and to
resolve especially its phylogenetic backbone. A rapid
radiation in the early history of pleurocarpous mosses
has resulted in low molecular diversity generally, but
particularly in the order Hypnales [5,7]. This has complicated the phylogenetic inferences from DNA
sequence data due to the small evolutionary distances
generated by phylogenetic signals [8]. The more variable
the DNA marker, therefore, the better the resolution for
low level phylogenies. The ITS2 is a spacer region
between two conserved core genes, 5.8 S and 28 S ribosomal DNA. Since it does not code for a core gene, the
ITS2 tolerates a higher mutation rate, which results in a
more variable DNA sequence. The ITS2 sequence has
been used to resolve moss phylogenies at the genus or
species level [9,10]. But while the ITS2 DNA sequence
is poorly conserved, the ITS2 secondary structure is
strongly conserved, consisting of four helices with the
third being the longest [11]. This conserved aspect of
the ITS2 region has been exploited by several researchers to reveal deep phylogenies [2,12-14]. Two new computer programs, 4SALE [15,16] and ProfDistS [17-20]
use both the variable and conserved characteristics of
the ITS2 and in the process make the ITS2 the
marker of choice for shallow and deep phylogeny

analyses [21,22]. These programs allow the user to generate multiple sequence-structure alignments and Profile
Neighbor-Joining trees using sequence and structure
data simultaneously. Programs 4SALE and ProfDistS
were therefore used in this study to generate a large
scale phylogenetic analysis of 1,634 complete and correctly annotated hypnalean ITS2 sequence-structure
pairs, which were currently available at the ITS2 Database [11-14,23,24].

Phylogeny of Hypnales
Large scale approach

The alignment and editing tool 4SALE [15,16] generated
a 51% consensus ITS2 secondary structure from all
1,634 sequence-structure pairs. The ITS2 consensus secondary structure consisted of the expected conserved
four helices with the third being the longest (Figure 1).
Every single base pair is 90% conserved over the whole
alignment. This is evidence for the correctness of the
4SALE [15,16] alignment of over 1,500 sequencestructure pairs. Furthermore it underlines the strong
preservation of the ITS2 secondary structure which
allowed us to proceed on this basis. Using an ITS2 specific rate matrix, we calculated a phylogenetic tree of all
1,634 sequence-structure pairs with ProfDistS [17-20]
(Figure 2, Additional file 1, Figure S1). Twentyfour of
the 35 examined hypnalean families could be grouped to

Figure 1 51% consensus ITS2 secondary structure. The four
helices are numerated from I to IV. 100% conserved positions are
indicated by an A, G, T or U within the green node. Each single
bond is 90% conserved over the whole alignment.

32 clades, 11 of the examined families could be grouped
to monophyla. Zooming in, a part of the subtree of the
clade “Meteoriaceae I” was exemplarily compared to the
50% majority rule consensus tree as shown in Quandt
et al. [25] and below. Both trees yielded similar results,
validating the large scale approach (Figure 3). Another
proof of the validity of the large scale approach is the
clade “Neckeraceae II”, consisting of 13 taxa. This clade
shows remarkable similarities to analyses of Olsson
et al. [26]. Both analyses show a distinct separation
into two clades each, in particular Pinnatella and
Taiwanobryum.
After setting the highlighted clades in Figure 2 as predefined profiles for ProfDistS [17-20] with Cartoon2Profile
a Profile Neighbor-Joining tree using 100 bootstrap
replicates was computed. The remaining sequences lying
in the non-monophyletic rests of the distance tree, were
not considered to confine this computation to only the
backbone of the Hypnales (see below), and how it is
supported regarding the ITS2 sequence-structure alignment (Figure 4).
Meteoriaceae

Quandt et al. [25] provided a detailed survey about the
Meteoriaceae focusing on the genera Meteorium and
Papillaria. A maximum likelihood tree of their research
(hereinafter referred to as Meteoriaceae Q) is now to be
compared to the subtree “Meteoriaceae I” (Figure 3).
Both trees illustrate the same characteristic division into
clade P and clade M. Internally clade M differs in solely
a few details: The Meteoriaceae Q handle Meteorium
buchanii and Meteorium polytrichum together as a sister
to Meteorium subpolytrichum and Meteorium papillarioides. In “Meteoriaceae I”, however, Meteorium polytrichum itself is a sister to Meteorium subpolytrichum and
Meteorium papillarioides. The three together stand as a
sister group to Meteorium buchanii. Furthermore Papillaria nigrescens and Papillaria deppei build a monophylum with Meteorium illecebrum as a sister. Within clade
P of “Meteoriaceae I” Papillaria crocea, Papillaria zeloflexicaulis, Cryptopapillaria penicillata and Papillaria
africana show an exactly reverse descent as in Meteoriaceae Q. Moreover, in Meteoriaceae Q Papillaria nitens
is a sister to the complete remaining clade P and not
only to the Papillaria africana clade. Nevertheless the
facts that (1) the “Meteoriaceae I” strongly resemble
published results [25] and (2) the ITS2 consensus secondary structure of all 1,634 sequence-structures shows
the specific ITS2 characteristics, underlines that the
ITS2 sequence-structure analyses were applicable to the
analyzed taxonomic levels. A Neighbor-Joining analysis
of the “Meteoriaceae I"-only alignment (also based on
sequences and secondary structures simultaneously, data
not shown) showed a few disagreements with the

Paraphyletic clades are indicated by quotes. A colored label denotes a clade as a complete monophylum containing each used sequence of this
family. It is possible that some clades are labeled with “I”, although there is no corresponding clade “II”. In this case the missing sequences are
spread in the non-monophyletic (uncolored) areas of the tree. Numbers in squared parentheses show the quantities of sequences in the specific
clade. An apparently small clade can yet contain many sequences. In this case different sequence-structures of the same species built a
monophylum and were collapsed for reasons of clarity and comprehensibility. Collapsed clades are marked by triangles instead of lines within
the tree.

Backbone

Morphological convergence is widespread among the
pleurocarps. This is one reason for the difficulties in
moss systematics. Among the order of Hypnales several
families (Hypnaceae, Neckeraceae, Leptodontaceae,
Anomodontaceae, Hylocomiaceae, Amblystegiaceae, Brachytheciaceae, Lembophyllaceae, Meteoriaceae and Leskeaceae) were recently revealed as polyphyletic [9,27].
This discovery shows several matches with the distance
tree as shown in Figure 2. The Anomodontaceae were
indeed non-monophyletic. The Brachytheciaceae are
divided into two major and two minor clades (without
considering the few sequences spread in the unhighlighted areas). The two major clades consist of 198 and
142 sequence-structure pairs, respectively. Furthermore,
the Lembophyllaceae split up into three clades. One of
these three clades ("Lembophyllaceae III”) contains the
only Rigodiaceae (Rigodium toxarion) of our taxon sampling. These findings strongly reflect the results of
Quandt et al. in 2009 [28]. Along the history of moss
classification Rigodium was placed in several diffrent
families. In 1909 Brotherus originally ranked Rigodium
among the Brachytheciaceae [29], later in 1925 among
the Lembopyllaceae [3]. Due to short leaf cells and the
similarity to Thuidiaceae in its habit Robinson [30]
returned Rigodium to the Brachytheciaceae, dispite the
lack of paraphyllia and distinct leaf papillae [28].
Whereas Buck [31] counted Rigodium among the

Page 4 of 8

Thuidiaceae, Crum [32] constituted the Rigodiaceae,
which were accepted by Zomlefer [28,33].
Considering the distance tree (Figure 2) and Olsson
et al. [9] there is now no doubt about the polyphyly of
Hypnaceae and Leskeaceae, which are widespread over
the whole tree. Therefore it is possible for a clade to
contain a single hypnacean or leskeacean sequence,
either because this species actually belongs into this
group or because of failures in sequencing and/or annotation. Most families with 12 sequences or less could
successfully be clustered as a monophylum (Climaciaceae [2], Theliaceae [7], Trachylomataceae [2], Sematophyllaceae [3], Stereophyllaceae [2] and Catagoniaceae
[12]). There is evidence for the Thuidiaceae being a
non-monophyletic group [34]. Despite one large thuidiacean clade with 8 taxa, this assumption could be confirmed, for there were several thuidacean sequences
which showed no immediate relation to the Thuidaceae
as shown in Figure 2.
While the distance tree could reveal phylogenetic relationships within families, Profile Neighbor-Joining successfully allowed us to gain information about the
backbone of the hypnalean phylogeny (Figure 4). The
Priodantaceae and Theliaceae build a monophylum in
84% of the calculated bootstrap replicates. The monophylum Climaciaceae + Pleuroziopsidaceae (99%) could
already be observed in the distance tree (ignoring seven
sequence-structure pairs of the close-by non-monophyletic
rest). Now the monophyly can be confirmed by high bootstrap values.
Moreover, there is no doubt that the “Brachytheciaceae IV” are a sister to Lembophyllaceae II + Symphyodontaceae with “Brachytheciaceae I” (including
Lembophyllaceae II) being a sister to this clade.
Although “Brachytheciaceae III” and “II” meet during
the PNJ process, they are still only distantly related to
“Brachytheciaceae I” and “IV” and thus are polyphyletic.
Also the three Neckeraceae clades do not meet during
the PNJ, which could be a hint for the actual polyphyly,
as outlined by Olsson et al. [9]. Despite the Lepyrodontaceae could successfully be grouped as a monophylum
with a bootstrap support of 76%, provided that the
Stereophyllaceae were included, the clade shows the
same characteristics as in the distance tree (Figure 2).
The Stereophyllaceae split the Lepyrodontaceae into two
subgroups, making them paraphyletic. The “Hylocomiaceae I” and “Leucodontaceae I” build a monophylum
with a bootstrap support of 81%.
By rooting the phylogenetic trees at Fabroniaceae we
use the same root as Ignatov et al. [35]. Unlike our large
scale ITS2 sequence-structure approach, Igantov et al.
[35] used a compilation of sequence data of several
markers for 144 sequences. Nevertheless, several families
show similar relations. The most basal clade O1

consisting of Fabroniaceae, Stereophyllaceae, Plagiotheciaceae and several Hypnaceae is similar to our trees
(Figure 2). The Clade O1 is gradually followed by Thuidiaceae, Amblystegiaceae and Sematophyllaceae, appearing in the main clade M1 of Ignatov et al. [35].

The main clade M2 and the trees of our analyses (Figure
2) have several taxa in common (Calliergonaceae, Hylocomiaceae, Neckeraceae and Brachytheciaceae) and thus
confirm the suitability of the ITS2 marker for large scale
phylogeny.

Taxonomic implications

Sequence-structure alignment and phylogenetic analyses

To describe the clades of the hypnalean backbone (Figure
4) as monophyletic several clades need to experience
taxonomic changes in further studies. The Lepyrodontaceae, which are paraphyletic in the distance tree and in
the backbone tree as well, can become a monophylum, if
the Stereophyllaceae are integrated. Also the Rigodiaceae,
which are located within the “Lembophyllaceae III”,
could actually belong to this group making it monophyletic. Furthermore the “Lembophyllaceae IV” are integrated into the Brachytheciaceae I. Eventually, the
remaining clades become monophyletic, when (1) all
sequences within the unhighlighted rest of the distance
tree (Figure 2) are not considered and (2) scattered
sequences within a family are now belong to the particular one. With PNJ 963 of 1,634 sequence-structure pairs
could be grouped to 30 monophyla.

An automatic multiple sequence-structure alignment
(MSA) was calculated with ClustalW [38] as implemented in 4SALE (A tool for Synchronous RNA Sequence
and Secondary Structure Alignment and Editing)
[15,16]. 4SALE provides the unique function of aligning
sequences while simultaneously considering the secondary structure of each sequence. Using an ITS2 specific
similarity matrix [15] 4SALE translates the sequencestructures into a mock protein with an alphabet of 12
letters (4 nucleotides multiplied by 3 possible states of
being involved in the secondary structure [pair opening,
pair closing, unpaired]). Based on the MSA a single distance based tree was calculated by ProfDistS [17-20]
using an ITS2 specific General Time Reversible Substitution Model (GTR) [20]. Like 4SALE ProfDistS also
considers the secondary structures of the used
sequences. Now a second filter used a perl script which
calculates the mean of all branch lengths and dismisses
every sequence and every two-sequences-clade that is
above a variable threshold (perl script available on
request). The threshold was set to 50, which means that
each sequence and two-sequences-clade with a branch
length higher than 50 multiplied by the mean of all
branch lengths was removed. Four sequences were classified as artifacts and deleted. The MSA, distance- and
tree calculation were repeated with the filtered set of
sequences, now containing 1,634 sequence-structure
pairs (Additional file 3). Due to the large number of
sequence-structure pairs, we took advantage of the Profile Neighbor-Joining (PNJ) function of ProfDistS. Clades
obtained from the distance tree corresponding to the
classic hypnalean taxonomy and containing at least 10
sequences were chosen as profiles. Moreover clades
were converted into profiles if they contained less than
10 sequences, but still the majority of all sequences of a
particular family, e.g. Sematophyllaceae, with only three
sequences. By using 33 predefined profiles, it was possible to perform a full PNJ analysis using 100 bootstrap
replicates. During each iteration of ProfDistS (1) nodes
with a bootstrap value of 75 or more and (2) nodes containing sequences that are 90% identical are clustered as
an additional profile. Thus it is possible that a node
which was below the threshold during the last iteration
now slides above the threshold, resulting in a super-profile. This process stops when no new profiles can be
built. ProfDistS used an ITS2 specific rate matrix for the
distance calculation [20]. A clade which is supposed to
be a predefined profile can be marked as a cartoon in
FigTree [39]. The perl script Cartoon2Profile http://
profdist.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/cgi-bin/
index.php?section=cart2prof searches for every cartoon
in a FigTree NEXUS file and converts the information
into a ProfDistS compatible profile file.

Conclusion
The large scale analysis of Hypnales (Bryophyta) inferred
from internal transcribed spacer 2 sequence-structure
data successfully accomplished one step towards the
deciphering of the taxonomy of pleurocarpous mosses.
The use of not only ITS2 sequences, but also structural
data is a plausible method, for it provides the feature of
calculating evolutionary distances both at the level of
highly variable sequences and at the level of conserved
structures. Although further studies are needed and
asked for to confirm the phylogenetic backbone of the
Hypnales, the results of this survey show evidence for
the actual polyphyly of many classic pleurocarpous
families, still awaiting taxonomic changes. Now it is
desirable, that Bryologists revisit specific groups within
Hypnales in the context of our large scale analysis. Back
to back research considering morphological characters
of mosses on a small scale contrasting our approach in
mega-systematics is absolutely necessary in establishing
a taxonomy of Hypnales. Furthermore, novel methods,
like the transfer of the sequence-structure and profile
approaches to a Maximum Likelihood algorithm, could
provide a great leap towards the true hypnalean phylogeny in the future.
Material and methods
Taxon sampling

1,730 hypnalean ITS2-sequences including their secondary structures were retrieved from the ITS2 Database [11-13,23,24] (retrieved on 12-20-2009, Additional
file 2). A first filter searched for sequences with ≥ 98%
sequence identity, which are yet classified within different families regarding the NCBI taxonomy database
[36,37]. Ninetytwo sequences were deleted. 1,638
ITS2 sequence-structure pairs remained for further
processing.

A further sequence-structure alignment was generated
containing only clade M and P of the “Meteoriaceae I”.
The alignment was processed by ProfDistS [17-20] using
the ITS2 specific GTR [20].
All tree files (including the large distance tree, Additional file 4) were visualized with FigTree [39]. All
figures were further processed with Inkscape [40].
