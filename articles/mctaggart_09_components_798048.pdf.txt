Abstract
Background: Branchiopod crustaceans in the genus Daphnia are key model organisms for
investigating interactions between genes and the environment. One major theme of research on
Daphnia species has been the evolution of resistance to pathogens and parasites, but lack of
knowledge of the Daphnia immune system has limited the study of immune responses. Here we
provide a survey of the immune-related genome of D. pulex, derived from the newly completed
genome sequence. Genes likely to be involved in innate immune responses were identified by
comparison to homologues from other arthropods. For each candidate, the gene model was
refined, and we conducted an analysis of sequence divergence from homologues from other taxa.
Results and conclusion: We found that some immune pathways, in particular the TOLL pathway,
are fairly well conserved between insects and Daphnia, while other elements, in particular
antimicrobial peptides, could not be recovered from the genome sequence. We also found
considerable variation in gene family copy number when comparing Daphnia to insects and present
phylogenetic analyses to shed light on the evolution of a range of conserved immune gene families.

Background
All metazoans appear to have an innate immune system
based on a distinct set of gene products that play recognition, regulatory and response roles [1]. However, within
this set of genes, there is striking diversity, as the enormous spectra of host habitats and specialist biological
enemies drive the evolution of immune systems [2-6]. To
date, knowledge of immune system function in arthropods has been based on a very few model organisms, and
the majority of studies have used two members of a single
insect order, specifically the Dipterans Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae. While the genes associated

with immunity are now being characterised in other insect
genomes [7,8], these additional exemplars do not yet span
the diversity of Arthropoda. To gain fuller understanding
of both the evolutionary origins of the insect immune system, and of any underlying patterns in arthropod immune
system function and diversification, it is necessary to
examine species in other arthropod subphyla, such as the
Crustacea.
Daphnia (waterfleas, Family Daphniidae, Order Branchiopoda) species are employed as model organisms for a
wide range of evolutionary and ecological topics, includPage 1 of 19

ing the evolution of immunity, coevolution and virulence
[4,9-14]. Daphnia and many of their parasites can be
manipulated experimentally, and laboratory experiments
have revealed a wealth of genetic diversity for responses to
infection [9]. Especially useful is the fact that Daphnia are
cyclical parthenogens, and thus can be maintained in the
lab as clonal lineages, enabling a precise comparison of
phenotypes between different genetic backgrounds, or the
study of different environments on the same genetic background. As they can also reproduce sexually, traditional
crossing experiments are feasible. Daphnia also provide
an unprecedented opportunity to elucidate the natural
variation in immune responses over long timescales (decades to centuries) [15-17]. In natural habitats, Daphnia
produce diapausing resting eggs, most of which are buried
in the sediments, where they remain viable for up to 200
years [17]. Through the use of dated sediment cores, the
past record of evolutionary change can be resurrected by
hatching these eggs. The molecular record of evolution
can be extended even further, as DNA can be acquired
from resting eggs up to 3000 years old [16].
While it has been easy to identify and measure the phenotypic consequences of variation in infection outcomes, the
molecular and physiological mechanisms underpinning
this variation have not been accessible in Daphnia. In contrast, the genetics of immune function have been characterised in detail in more traditional models such as D.
melanogaster. Genes of arthropod defence can be grouped
into five main functional classes [18-21]: (1) pathogen
recognition, (2) signal modulation, (3) signal transduction, (4) attack, and (5) anti-viral RNA interference.
Recognition receptors (called pattern recognition receptors; PRR) detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(typically conserved cell-surface motifs), and signal this to
modulating signalling receptors. These receptors in turn
initiate cascades that result in transcriptional and translational activation of attack molecules. Some effectors are
activated by post-translational proteolytic cleavage. Three
cascades are particularly well studied. First, the Toll pathway is activated when fungal and bacterial products stimulate transmembrane Toll receptors, which ultimately
lead to the production of antimicrobial peptides, melanization through prophenoloxidase or proteasome-dependent degradation. Secondly, the Imd pathway, induced
when bacterial or fungal products are detected by peptidoglycan-LC type receptors, can also lead to the production of antimicrobial peptides, melanization or apoptosis.
Finally, the Jak/Stat pathway results in the production of
thioester containing proteins (TEPs), which can bind
pathogens until they are cleared through phagocytosis.
The RNAi pathway acts intracellularly to recognise, process and finally destructively cleave specific doublestranded RNAs that likely derive from viral infection.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/175

A comparison of immune genes from the first four of
these functional classes from two species of mosquito, A.
gambiae, and Aedes aegypti, and the fruit fly D. melanogaster
revealed that the number of orthologous trios and their
sequence divergence differs among functional classes,
confirming that genes from different classes are under different selective pressures [22]. Specifically, it was observed
that genes in the signal transduction pathways have strict
1:1:1 orthologues, and their sequences are more divergent
than orthologous trios from the other three classes. In
contrast, the effector molecules have very few orthologous
trios with lower sequence divergence than gene trios from
the other classes. The evolutionary signature of the other
functional classes falls between these extremes.
Using prior data on invertebrate immune system genes,
we have searched the recently produced draft genome
sequence of the waterflea Daphnia pulex to identify homologues of genes with demonstrated immune function in
other arthropods. By carefully refining the gene models
for these putative immune genes we have produced
revised protein predictions, and here present an analysis
of both the diversity of the D. pulex immune genome and
its relation to those of other arthropods.

Results and discussion
Overview
We identified and annotated 82 genes representing 21
unique gene families from the Daphnia pulex v1.1 draft
genome sequence assembly (September, 2006) (Table 1)
[23-26]. In parallel, we collated information from the
genome sequences of five insect species to identify
changes in gene family membership among taxa. For the
phylogenetic analyses, we included additional arthropod
sequences when they were available. The differences in
gene family membership among taxa are of particular
interest as they may reflect the evolutionary genomic
response to the unique repertoire of immune challenges
that a species has faced, and thus provide clues as to which
genes are evolving in response to host/parasite interactions. For example, recognition and effector molecules
that interact directly with pathogens display considerable
species-specific gene expansion, in contrast to signal transduction molecules, which show no copy number variation and high sequence divergence [22].

Overall, our search for immune system homologues
uncovered fewer genes in D. pulex than in D. melanogaster,
A. gambiae or A. aegypti, a similar repertoire to T. castaneum, and more genes than A. mellifera (Table 1). The fact
that we found fewer genes than are present in the dipteran
genomes may be an artefact due to the high degree of
sequence divergence between query and target sequences.
However, D. pulex gene families are not consistently lower
in number in comparison to the three dipteran species.

* two copies of dicer seemed likely for A. mellifera, but could not be confirmed.
Genes are classified according to function and displays the current number of annotated gene copies of each gene in the waterflea D. pulex (Dpul),
the mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae (Agam) and Aedes aegypti (Aaeg), the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Dmel), the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum
(Tcas), and the honey bee Apis mellifera (Amel). Gene counts were gathered from [7,8,22] and public genome databases [24-26]. Please note that
gene copy number may differ slightly among sources. NK indicates that the gene is not annotated from that taxon. Sequences of all of the Daphnia
pulex gene models are available in Additional File 5.

For example, D. pulex has 11 members of the gram-negative bacterium binding protein (GNBP) family, while D.
melanogaster has 3 members, and A. gambiae and A. aegypti
each have 6 members. Thus, lower copy numbers in D.
pulex are unlikely to be entirely due to the use of dipteran
sequences to search a crustacean genome, and may
instead reflect real differences in these organisms' evolutionary histories and subsequent strategies in combating
their respective pathogens.
Gram-negative binding proteins (GNBPs)
GNBPs are PRR that bind pathogens involved in initiating
the prophenoloxidase and Toll immune system cascades.
There are two distinct groups of GNBPs, characterised by
the presence or absence of the cysteine rich (CR) domain,
which binds compounds of pathogenic origin (e.g. -1-3glucan, lipopolysaccharide, or lipotechoic acid). All of the
GNBP genes of D. melanogaster, A. mellifera and Bombyx
mori have the CR domain. In contrast only two of seven
GNBP genes of A. gambiae contain this domain. Addition-

ally, all GNBPs, except two from D. melanogaster
(CG13422 and CG12780), contain a glucanase-like
(GLU) domain that is susceptible to protease digestion
and has lower affinity for polysaccharides than the CR
domain. In all crustaceans examined previously the GLU
domain contains a putative catalytic site that is absent in
D. melanogaster. A. gambiae and D. pulex have genes both
with and without the putative catalytic site.
Eleven D. pulex GNBP genes were found. Three scaffolds
contain two GNBP genes each whilst one scaffold has four
GNBP genes, three of which are in close proximity to each
other. Dappu-GNBP2 is alone on a separate scaffold. The
number of exons in the D. pulex GNBP genes is typically
six or seven but Dappu-GNBP2 has nine exons. Overall,
the conservation of intron/exon boundaries is apparent
and may indicate recent duplication events, a model supported by phylogenetic analysis suggesting that D. pulex
GNBP family expansion is recent on an evolutionary
timescale.

Phylogenetic analysis shows that the GNBP fall into four
well-supported clades (Figure 1). GNBP clade I is insectspecific, and contains proteins with CR domains and inactive GLU domains. Within clade I, two D. melanogaster
proteins, CG13422 and CG12780, consist of only a signal
peptide and CR domain. Both of these D. melanogaster
paralogues are likely to be functional despite the loss of
the GLU domain, as they are upregulated during bacterial
infection and CG13422 is also upregulated during fungal
infection [27,28]. Clade II contains a species-specific
expansion of ten D. pulex GNBP paralogues. The only
other member of this clade is a GNBP from the oligochaete annelid Eisenia foetida, suggesting that insects have lost
this GNBP subtype. Many of the D. pulex clade II genes are
clustered on the same scaffold, and thus probably arose
from local duplication events. It is not unusual for diversified duplicated immune genes to be selectively advantageous to new pathogenic challenges [22]. The short
branch lengths separating some gene pairs in clade II are
indicative of either recent duplication or concerted evolution. None of the GNBP clade II proteins have a CR
domain, but all of them, except for Dappu-GNBP1, have
an active GLU domain.
GNBP clade III consists of proteins exclusively from crustaceans. However, surprisingly, none of the D. pulex GNBP
homologues are members, indicating that it is missing
from the draft assembly, that it has been lost, or that it
diverged substantially since the separation of these species. GNBP clade III proteins have no CR but retain GLU
domains. GNBP clade IV consists of five A. gambiae proteins and one D. pulex protein suggesting an Anophelesspecific gene expansion and, in D. melanogaster and in
other insect species, either loss or substantial divergence.
None of the proteins in this clade contains a CR domain
and all have an active GLU domain.
Peptidoglycan recognising proteins (PGRPs)
Another major class of PRR are the peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs). Aside from recognising peptidoglycan, a required constituent of the cell membranes of
gram-negative bacteria, it has been shown in D. melanogaster that GNBP1 and PGRP-SA form a complex that
leads to the activation of the Toll receptor, resulting in the
production of antimicrobial peptides. PGRPs have been
implicated in a variety of other immune functions, notably the induction of phagocytosis, activation of the Imd
and prophenoloxidase pathways, and may even have
direct cytotoxic activity towards bacteria [29]. Surprisingly, our search of the D. pulex genome found no PGRP
genes. Notably, however, D. melanogaster PGRP-LD is part
of a complex transcriptional unit that undergoes differential splicing and translation in a different reading frame to
yield two very different peptides: PGRP-LD or PMI.
Although we recovered a homologue of PMI in D. pulex,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/175

its alternative reading frames do not encode a PGRP. This
is a surprising finding because D. pulex has homologues of
Toll-1, the receptor that is activated in response to PGRPs'
recognition of gram-negative bacteria. Our finding that D.
pulex has an expansion of GNBP genes relative to D. melanogaster could indicate that some GNBPs compensate for
the absence of a PGRP.
The TOLL pathway
The Toll family cell surface receptors play an important
role in the innate immune system of both invertebrates
and vertebrates. These ancient proteins function as signal
transducers, inducing pathways that result in the production of antibacterial and antifungal proteins following the
recognition of pathogens via peptidoglycan recognition
proteins (PGRPs) and gram-negative binding proteins
(GNBPs). Different Toll proteins have specific interactions with particular pathogens [30]. Unlike mammalian
Toll-like proteins, which function solely as recognition
and signalling proteins resulting in the activation of
immune system pathways, some D. melanogaster Toll
genes are also involved in developmental regulation.

The Toll gene family is among the best characterised in the
immune system. All members encode transmembrane
proteins that contain signal peptides, leucine-rich repeat
(LRR) regions interspersed with cysteine rich areas, and an
intracellular C-terminal Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR)
domain. LRRs are 22–28 amino acids long and are typically involved in protein-protein interactions. The intracellular TIR domain is involved in signalling and
interactions with the other players in the Toll pathway.
Signal transduction in the Toll pathway involves three
well conserved single copy genes (Tube, Pelle and
MyD88), orthologues of two of which, Pelle and MyD88,
we have identified in the D. pulex genome (Table 1), indicating that this pathway is likely to function in a manner
similar to that of D. melanogaster.
We found seven Toll receptor genes in the D. pulex
genome, located on seven different scaffolds (Figure 2).
These proteins possess 13 to 28 LRRs, similar to the Toll
receptors of D. melanogaster (which have from 10–31
LRRs). The variation in the number of LRR repeats makes
credible sequence alignment of the full protein sequences
problematic, and thus only the relatively conserved TIR
domains were used in the phylogenetic analysis (Figure
2). The deep branches of the TIR tree are not well supported, and so it is not possible to comment on the ancestral relationships among the different paralogous groups.
However, some of the more recent nodes of the tree are
strongly supported, allowing the identification of several
candidate immune-related D. pulex Toll genes. DappuTOLL 1 and Dappu-TOLL 3 are members of a clade that
includes Dm-Toll1, shown to act as signal transducer for

the induction of the Toll pathway following infection
with fungi and bacteria [31,32]), and Dm-Tehao, implicated in induction of drosomycin in response to fungal
infection [33,34]. Dappu-TOLL2 and Dappu-TOLL4 are
clustered with Dm-Toll-9, which is most similar to the
mammalian Toll-like receptors that are involved in signalling to initiate acute inflammatory responses, phagocytosis and antimicrobial peptides. However, definitive
evidence of the involvement of Dm-Toll-9 in immune
responses is lacking. Dappu-TOLL3 differs from DappuTOLL4 and the other members of this clade in being
encoded by a single, large exon (rather than 6 or 7 exons).
This gene may be the result of an ancient duplication
mediated by retrotransposition of a mature mRNA.

TEPs including Dappu-TEP1; this clade does not have representatives from A. gambiae or D. melanogaster. TEP clades
II and IV contain 1 and 5 representatives respectively from
D. pulex and correspond to the previously defined invertebrate TEP class. All members of TEP clade II except DmTEP5, and all members of clade IV have a TE motif. TEP
clade IV includes the D. melanogaster macroglobulin complement-related (Mcr) gene, essential for the specific
phagocytosis of the fungus Candida albicans [39]. Four of
the five D. pulex proteins in this clade (Dappu-TEP4, -5, 6 and -7) are similar in sequence and are neighbours on
one scaffold, and thus probably arose through recent local
duplication events. Clade I is an A. gambiae-specific
expansion.

Thioester proteins
Invertebrate thioester proteins (TEPs) are an ancient family related to vertebrate complement factors. Most of these
proteins contain a thioester (TE) motif (GCGEQ) accompanied by a catalytic histidine residue. These two elements
covalently bind pathogens through a thioester bond until
the pathogens are cleared by phagocytosis [35]. However,
not all TEPs contain a TE motif or catalytic histidine. How
TEPs function in the absence of these motifs is currently
unknown, but it has been suggested they may act as adaptors for the initiation of the membrane attack complex as
is found in vertebrates [36].

Regarding the possible immune function of these TEPs,
Dm-TEP3 from clade II has been shown to act as an
opsonin for Staphylococcus aureus. Another D. melanogaster
gene in this clade, Dm-TEP2, has five splice variants, the
functional significance of which remains to be determined.Dappu-TEP2, also in clade II, may also exhibit alternative splice forms as there are additional putative coding
exons in the region of the gene homologous to those
found to be alternatively spliced in D. melanogaster. Interestingly, a clade III TEP from the tick Ornithodoros moubata
also shows splice variants [40]. Multiple splice forms may
serve to increase the repertoire of proteases that are recognised by these TEP proteins. Of the seven D. pulex TEP
genes, only Dappu-TEP2 has both the TE motif and a catalytic histidine residue suggesting that it likely functions
as an opsonin. TEP clade III includes representatives from
human and arthropods: from insects (a hymenopteran
and a colepteran), two chelicerates, three malacostracan
crustaceans and three species of Daphnia. As is the case for
all the proteins in this clade, Dappu-TEP1 has a TE motif
but no histidine residue, and likely functions similarly to
the functionally characterized 2m molecules.

Among the best-studied TEP family members are the 2macroglobulins (2m), protease inhibitors that are activated by pathogen-released proteases. This class of TEPs
contain a TE motif, but lack a catalytic histidine residue.
Upon activation, 2m proteins undergo a conformational
change that traps the pathogen protease within the protein, leading to the exposure of the TEP C-terminal recognition domain, which binds phagocytic cells and
promotes endocytotic clearance.
While not all invertebrate TEPs have a documented
immune function, several functional studies have begun
to elucidate their role in this capacity. For example, the
expression of the Ag-TEP1 gene is upregulated after
immune challenge and, upon activation, it has been
shown to promote phagocytosis [37]. Additionally, some
D. melanogaster TEPs, Tep1, Tep2 and Tep4 are upregulated following immune challenge [38]. Finally, it has
been suggested that different TEP family members bind
different pathogens [39].
We found seven TEP genes in the D. pulex genome. Three
are on different scaffolds and four lie clustered on a single
scaffold. All seven D. pulex TEP proteins have a signal peptide, indicating they are secreted. Our phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3) identified four well-supported clades. TEP
clade III unites the mammalian 2m with non-vertebrate

Scavenger receptors
Scavenger receptors (SR) are a diverse, multigene family of
cell surface membrane proteins that share broad structural
similarities. SR recognize and bind modified low-density
lipoprotein (LDL), multiple polyanionic ligands and cell
wall components [41]. SR have a dual cellular role: they
are PRR of the immune system, whose triggering results in
the cellular encapsulation of bacteria, and also have a
housekeeping role of 'scavenging' cellular debris. Structurally, SR can display different numbers and types of protein
domains, including chitin-binding domains, scavenger
cysteine-rich receptors (SRCR), low-density lipoproteins
(LDL), and C-type lectins (see Additional file 1). SRCR
domains are candidates for ligand binding and protein
interaction, although their precise biological functions
remain largely unknown. We examined only one of three
classes of SR, namely the macrophage scavenger receptor

class A (SR-A), as they appear to function primarily in the
immune system [42,43]. The SR-A class can be divided
into two groups: those that have at least one SRCR
domain and those that do not (SR-A1 and SR-A2 respectively; see Additional file 1).
D. melanogaster, A. gambiae and A. aegypti each have five
SR-A genes that form four orthologue pairs [22]. In contrast, six class A scavenger genes were recovered from 6 different scaffolds within the D. pulex genome. Structurally,
only A. gambiae Scrasp3 and Dappu-SCV1 do not contain
SRCR domains and are therefore classified as SR-A2 type.
Due to the highly variable domain structure of the SR, an
alignment of the full protein sequences was not possible.
Therefore, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the
conserved SRCR domains of the remaining fourteen SRA1 proteins (containing 31 domains) from D. melanogaster, A. gambiae and D. pulex. Thus, a single protein
that contains three SRCR domains (labelled A, B, C from
the N-terminus) has three representations on the tree (Figure 4).
Eight well-supported groups were resolved, each containing at least one SRCR domain from each of D. melanogaster, A. gambiae and D. pulex. The fact that
orthologous trios are recovered when a crustacean is
added to the sequences examined strongly supports the
hypothesis that these recognition molecules are under
strong functional constraint. SCRC domains found within
the same protein are placed in different groups, excluding
intragenic domain duplication as a mechanism of their
evolution. Further supporting this conclusion is the fact
the spatial orientation of the multiple domains is maintained across these diverse taxa, including the single protein examined from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.
The single SRCR domain from group 2 proteins is most
similar in sequence to the third SRCR domain from group
4 proteins, but other inter-group relationships were not
resolved. This may be due to a rapid burst of domain
duplication in an ancestral genome and subsequent maintenance of functionally divergent paralogues.
With regard to the different functional roles of the SR paralogues, the D. melanogaster gene encoding the protein
Tequila/Graal, a secreted protein that is primarily transcribed in the fat body, was found to be significantly
upregulated after immune challenge [44]. Likewise, its
orthologue in A. gambiae, Scrasp1, is also upregulated
after microbial challenge [45,46]. However, disruption of
Tequila did not effect the survival of flies infected with
either of gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria, the production of antimicrobial peptides or prophenoloxidase
activity [44]. Therefore, the role, if any, in immunity of
these genes is currently unclear, although it is evident
from the experiments with D. melanogaster that they do

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/175

not play a role in the activation of the Toll pathway. D.
pulex has two co-orthologues of Tequila/Graal/Scrasp1
(Dappu-SCV3 and Dappu-SCV4), both of which are
therefore also putatively involved in the immune system.
This is the only example of two gene copies from one species within a group, indicating that either a gene duplication has occurred in D. pulex, or a gene copy has been lost
in the other species. Contrary to what one would expect as
the result of recent gene duplication, the two D. pulex
genes are not identical in domain structure: one (DappuSCV3) contains three SRCR domains and two chitin-binding domains, while the other (Dappu-SCV4) contains two
SRCR domains and no chitin-binding domains. Similar to
Dappu-SCV3, D. melanogaster Tequila and A. gambiae
Scrasp1 both contain at least 2 chitin binding domains,
but resemble Dappu-SCV4 in that they each have only two
SCRC domains. Nevertheless, a D. pulex specific gene
duplication seems likely.
The phylogenetic analysis shows that SRCR_B and
SCRC_C from Dappu-SCV3 share a common ancestry
with the first and second domain copies respectively of
Tequila, Scrasp1 and Dappu-SCV4. Thus, Dappu-SCV3
SCRC_A lacks a direct orthologue in the other members of
the group, indicating that the other two species may have
lost it. Moreover, the branch lengths separating the two D.
pulex genes are very short. Thus, it appears that in the lineage leading to group 1 proteins in the dipterans have lost
a SCRC domain, and that D. pulex has undergone a recent
species-specific gene duplication resulting in a truncated
gene copy with only two SRCR receptors and no chitinbinding domains. Finally, the D. melanogaster protein
Corin, containing a single SCRC domain, also has a documented putative functional role in the immune system.
Indeed, it is up-regulated three-fold when challenged by
any of gram-positive, gram-negative or fungal pathogen
challenges [28]. Thus, based on our phylogenetic analysis,
the Corin orthologue Dappu-SCV2 is likely to have an
immune function.
Chitinases
Chitin is a polysaccharide found in the supportive structures of many organisms including the exoskeletons of
invertebrates, cell walls of some fungal spores, and cysts of
amoeboid parasites. Chitinases hydrolyse chitin, and are
critical in arthropod development (e.g. during ecdysis). A
wide range of organisms that do not synthesise chitin also
express chitinases where they play roles in chitin digestion
and in immune defence against chitin-containing pathogens. For example, plant class I chitinase has been shown
to undergo rapid adaptive evolution in its active site cleft,
presumably due to an arms race with a fungal pathogen
[47]. Additionally, two chitinase-like proteins in A. gambiae (Ag-AgBr1 and Ag-AgBr2) were shown to be upregulated in the presence of gram-positive bacteria [48], and

chitinase-like proteins are part of the mammalian
immune system [49]. We identified 17 chitinase genes in
D. pulex, a similar repertoire to that of D. melanogaster,
which has 16. Intrachromosomal tandem duplication has
likely contributed to the large number of chitinase genes
within the D. pulex genome.
Chitinase and chitinase-like proteins contain two primary
structural domains: the glycosyl hydrolase family 18
domain (GH18), which is responsible for hydrolysing
chitin oligosacchirides, and the chitin-binding domain
(CH14). The number and spatial arrangement of these
structural domains varies among the available arthropod
sequences. However, all contain between 1 and 5 GH18
domains while only a subset contain CH14 domains.
All of the chitinase and chitinase-like proteins that have a
characterised immune related function contain a single
GH18 domain and do not contain a CH14 domain. Phylogenetic analysis of the individual GH18 domains for all
available chitinase and chitinase-like genes from various
arthropod taxa yielded a well-supported tree (Figure 5),
with all the immune-related genes in one distinct clade
(clade Ib). The GH18 domains from Dappu-CHT1 and
Dappu-CHT2 are closely related to this cluster, and define
these two as likely immune-related chitinase genes. Furthermore, all members of clade Ib, including DappuCHT1 and Dappu-CHT2, lack an active site glutamate residue critical for the hydrolysis of chitin, a trait that does
not appear to be necessary in immune system function.
Additionally, based on the longer branch lengths in clade
Ib, its members appear to be evolving more rapidly than
most of the other clades, a trait consistent with genes
experiencing changing selective pressure, such as can be
caused by host-pathogen interactions. Interestingly, a further four GH18 domains found elsewhere in the tree also
lack the glutamate residue (Dm-CHT12, Dm-CHT10,
Dappu-CHT3, and Tenebrio molitor CHT1), indicating that
these domains also have a function that does not require
hydrolysis of chitin, and should be considered for functional studies.
An additional nine GH18 domains from seven D. pulex
chitinases are contained within clade I, representing a
large species-specific gene expansion. Although all of
these gene copies are predicted to have the ability to
hydrolyse chitin, such a large gene expansion of genes in
the class that may have given rise to the immune-related
chitinases warrants functional characterization.
Nitric oxide synthase (NOS)
The nitric oxide synthase (NOS) genes encode an enzyme
responsible for the production of nitric oxide (NO), a
highly reactive free radical gas. NO is toxic to nearly all
types of pathogens. All vertebrates studied to date have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/175

three NOS paralogues, permitting partitioning of gene
function. Two paralogues produce constitutively
expressed proteins (neuronal and endothelial NOS),
while the third, inducible NOS, is an immune response
molecule triggered by pro-inflammatory cytokines. In
contrast to the vertebrate NOS genes, all previously investigated invertebrates, which include six insect species and
one crustacean (the blackback land crab Gecarcinus lateralis), have a single NOS that performs multiple metabolic
functions, including roles in both humoral and cellular
innate immune responses [50-52]. In contrast, we identified two NOS paralogues in the D. pulex genome. DappuNOS1 and Dappu-NOS2 differ in gene structure, suggesting that they are not the result of a recent duplication
event. Indeed, the two D. pulex NOS proteins are only
44% identical, and thus are less similar to each other than
are mouse inducible NOS and either mouse neuronal
NOS (51%) or mouse endothelial NOS (52%).
Our reconstruction of the NOS phylogeny identifies an
insect-specific clade with the NOS of the blackback land
crab as the sister to this clade (see Additional file 2). However, the relationship of the two D. pulex paralogues to this
clade is not resolved. Regardless of their evolutionary relationship with the other NOS homologues, the duplication
of NOS in D. pulex could have resulted in gene subfunctionalization [53], potentially in a manner similar to the
NOS genes in vertebrates, neofunctionalization [54], or
even a combination of the two (subneofunctionalization
[55]). Without further functional information with
respect to the product of these two genes, it is not possible
to test between these different models. However, the fact
the branch lengths of both of the D. pulex NOS genes
(especially that of Dappu-NOS2) are long relative to other
branches within the tree suggests that both of these genes
are either experiencing release from selective constraint or
are subject to positive selection that has accelerated their
evolution.
Caspases
Caspases are members of the cysteinyl aspartate proteinase family that cleave particular substrates after aspartic
acid residues. Caspase proteins contain three domains:
prodomain, p20 and p10. The prodomain varies in
sequence length and composition, and contains motifs
that direct the protein to particular complexes or
organelles. The p20 and p10 units are necessary for substrate recognition and catalytic activity.

Members of the caspase family play roles in programmed
cell death and inflammation in vertebrates, but their roles
in invertebrates are less clear. A phylogenetic analysis of
caspase p-domains from D. melanogaster, Danio rerio,
Xenopus laevis, Gallus gallus, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens identified three main clades corresponding to inflam-

matory, apoptotic or apoptotic initiator responses [56].
No arthropod caspase homologues were placed in the
clades containing vertebrate inflammation responsive
homologues. However, the D. melanogaster caspase Dredd
mediates immune responses to infection by gram-negative bacteria, possibly by cleaving the antimicrobial peptide transcription factor Relish [57]. Furthermore, a study
of the D. melanogaster caspases Decay, Daydream and
Drice found that all three were upregulated by pathogens
[28]. Thus it appears that vertebrate and arthropod caspases may have independently evolved an immune function.
We identified eight putative caspases in D. pulex, the same
number found in D. melanogaster and T. castaneum. A.
gambiae has fifteen (including two caspase-like genes),
while A. mellifera has only one (Table 1). D. pulex caspases
are distributed among five scaffolds, with three paralogues arranged on a single scaffold. The prodomain of
the various caspases was too variable to align with confidence and thus was excluded from further analysis. In
contrast, the p20 and p10 domains were sufficiently similar to allow an alignment to be constructed. The phylogenetic tree of the caspases contains 8 clades, the
relationship among which is unresolved (Figure 6). There
are only two 1:1 orthologues between D. melanogaster and
A. gambiae, and neither orthologous pair includes a D.
pulex member. However, all but one D. pulex and one A.
gambiae caspase cluster with paralogues from the same
species, indicating that lineage-specific gene duplication is
a relatively frequent event.
Two of the eight clades (clades II and III), containing a
total five genes, are unique to D. pulex, while another
(clade IV) is unique to A. gambiae. Only clade VIII, containing the immune related Dm-Dredd, includes orthologues from all three arthropods, suggesting that the
putative immune function of this clade is ancestral to the
split between the crustaceans and insects. The transcription factor Relish that is activated by Dredd is also conserved among these species. However, only D. pulex
contains two paralogues within clade VIII, a lineage-specific expansion that may provide additional flexibility in
immune-related function. The other caspases with characterized immune function in insects are found in clades I
and V, neither of which contains D. pulex orthologues.
Anitviral RNAi genes
RNA interference (RNAi) is an ancient defence mechanism that targets invading viral double-stranded RNA and
transposons [58]. The RNAi cascade involves many genes
working in synchrony, including Argonaute, an endonuclease, and Dicer, which is responsible for cutting dsRNA
into small fragments for further processing. It has been
shown that genes involved in the RNAi pathway are evolv-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/175

ing rapidly due to positive selection, and that they show
patterns of nucleotide polymorphisms that are consistent
with a recent selective sweep [5]. Based on these findings,
it is suggested that the rapid adaptive evolution in these
genes may be caused by a coevolutionary arms race
between viral pathogens and host defence [5].
As expected from the D. melanogaster genome, we identified two Argonaute genes in D. pulex, corresponding a
housekeeping endonuclease with no immune function,
and an RNAi endonuclease (Figure 7a). Contrary to expectations from D. melanogaster, three Dicer paralogues were
identified in the D. pulex genome. Dicer paralogues
resolve into two primary clusters corresponding to housekeeping genes and those that take part in the antiviral
activity (Figure 7b). The additional D. pulex Dicer gene
appears to be the result of a lineage-specific duplication of
the antiviral pathway paralogue. These duplicates show
lower sequence similarity to each other than do the orthologues from the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and A. gambiae,
so the duplication event is unlikely to be new. From their
respective branch lengths, both the D. pulex antiviral Dicer
proteins are evolving at a higher rate than the housekeeping paralogues, a finding consistent with the hypothesis
that they are undergoing a co-evolutionary arms race with
D. pulex pathogens. Similarly, the D. pulex Argonaute gene
copy in the putative antiviral pathway shows a higher rate
of evolution than the housekeeping paralogue. A population genetic survey could test whether these genes are
indeed experiencing strong selective pressures.
Immunoglobulin-related
In vertebrates, the innate immune system is complemented by a complex adaptive immune system that generates novelty in immune receptors by somatic
recombination and rearrangement of immunoglobulindomain containing genes. While there has been no evidence that non-vertebrates have homologous machinery
for an adaptive immune response, one gene with an
immunoglobulin domain, a homologue of the human
Down Syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM), has
recently been implicated in immune-related somatic
diversification in insects [59,60]. DSCAM is a key player
controlling neural wiring in both vertebrates and invertebrates. However, while vertebrates can make three different transcripts through alternative splicing, D.
melanogaster has the capacity to make 30,000 unique transcripts due to four clusters of variable exons spliced in a
mutually exclusive manner. This remarkable gene structure has been observed in all insects studied to date,
including the dipterans D. melanogaster, A. gambiae, and A.
aegypti, the lepidopteran Bombyx mori, the hymenopteran
A. mellifera, and the colepteran T. castaneum, although
alternative exon number is variable.

Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of two RNAi genes. (A) Argonaut genes, and (B) Dicer genes. Based on functional studies in Drosophila, AGO1 and DCR1 gene copies are thought to play a housekeeping function, whilst AGO2 and DCR2 gene
copies are thought to be involved in antiviral pathways. Numbers at nodes are Bayesian posterior probabilities.
It has been speculated that the alternative transcripts may
yield protein isoforms that act in a manner similar to that
of vertebrate antibodies. Dscam transcripts have been
found in fly hemolymph, fat body cells and hemocytes
[60]. In these tissues, novel alternative splice products
were found that have not been observed in neural tissue.
Furthermore, A. gambiae challenged with different types of
pathogens resulted in the transcription of different Dscam
variants [59]. RNAi experiments in both the fly and mosquito have shown that the organisms were less able to
clear pathogens when Dscam was inhibited [59,60].
Dappu-Dscam, fully described in a companion paper
[61], has similar complexity to that observed in insects
(Dappu-Dscam contains three variable exon clusters) and
the frequency of alternative transcript expression differs
between the brain and hemocytes, suggesting that Daphnia DSCAM may also play a role in immunity.

Conclusion
Natural populations vary tremendously in their levels of
parasitism and pathogen virulence, and experimental
investigations of infection phenotypes have revealed that
host genetic polymorphism often mediates these patterns.
However, it is rarely known which genes underlie this variation. Daphnia is a prime example of this, as much is
known about its phenotypic responses to pathogens, both
in the field and in the laboratory, but its immune system
is relatively unknown. Thus, in addition to the phylogenetic insights gained in the present study, annotating the
Daphnia immune-related genome raises the possibility of
studies that link genetic variation to ecosystem dynamics.
This is a key advance relative to Drosophila, which
although genetically well characterised and the source of
exciting insight into innate immunity, is less well studied
in its natural environment.

The bioinformatics approach used in this study provides
the necessary first step in understanding the Daphnia
immune system. However, as it relies on searching for
genes that are characterized in other organisms, it does
not provide a complete picture. We will not be able to
gain a full understanding of the Daphnia immune system
until we identify those immunity genes that are unique to
Daphnia, for example by looking at the transcriptome of
infected versus healthy individuals. Furthermore, most
work on natural variation in responses to Daphnia pathogens has been carried out on D. magna, while the current
genome sequence is for the rather distantly related D.
pulex. Nevertheless, we have so far had substantial success
transferring genomic information from D. pulex to D.
magna (for example, designing oligonucleotide primers
useful for accessing the D. magna transcriptome). Moreover, the D. pulex genome will prove a useful resource for
characterising the D. magna genome, which is an ongoing
sequencing project undertaken by the Daphnia Genomics
Consortium. Thus with the immune related genome of
Daphnia pulex annotated, development of a system for indepth ecological genetics of infection is now within our
grasp.

was carried out until no new gene copies were identified.

Additional file 5.
Gene nomenclature
Newly identified genes were named according to the recommendation of the Daphnia Genomics Consortium
https://dgc.cgb.indiana.edu/display/daphnia/
The+gene+name+nomenclature. Briefly, an uppercase
three-letter symbol is assigned to each gene, followed by a
number when the gene is orthologous to a D. melanogaster
gene, and subsequently followed by an uppercase letter if
the numbered gene has paralogues in D. pulex. For cases
where the genes annotated had a previously accepted
nomenclature, we followed the extant naming convention, even if it deviated from the three-letter code (e.g.
gram-negative binding proteins are annotated as GNBP),
although the convention for assignment of homology to
insects and different loci in D. pulex was still adopted. In
the text, D. pulex genes are identified by the prefix Dappu,
those of D. melanogaster by prefix Dm, and those of A.
gambiae by Ag.

Methods
In silico identification of D. pulex immune genes
We conducted all gene searches on the D. pulex 8.7× coverage scaffold assembly (Dappu v1.1, September 2006;
http://wFleaBase.org and http://www.jgi.doe.gov/Daph
nia). Each search was initiated by identifying all arthropod protein sequence homologues of the target gene from
GenBank (see Additional File 3 for accession numbers of
all publicly available genes shown in the phylogentic
trees, and Additional File 4 for sequences of gene models
constructed from publicly available genome trace files).
These were then compared to the 5,191 scaffolds using
tBLASTn, and all high scoring segment pairs with an Evalue of less than 10-5 selected. The regions of the scaffolds
corresponding to significant matches, plus an additional
2000 bases up- and down-stream, were extracted as a single unit using a Perl script. The genome annotation workbench Artemis http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Artemis
was used to identify and annotate probable gene structures in D. pulex using additional information deriving
from BLASTn searches of the cognate D. pulex expressed
sequence tag dataset, BLASTp searches of the open reading
frames of the target scaffold sequence against UniProt, %
GC content, and GT-AG intron boundaries.

The protein domain structure of each amino acid
sequence was inferred using the Pfam website http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam. Signal peptides and
transmembrane regions were identified using the SignalP
server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP. To search
for additional matches that might indicate the presence of

Phylogenetic inference
The D. pulex protein sequences were aligned to homologous sequences from other taxa using the ClustalW algorithm within MacVector (v7.2.3). Multiple sequence
alignments were corrected by eye. In some cases, these
alignments were used to refine the D. pulex gene annotation, for example when a highly divergent exon was difficult to identify by BLAST score and % GC content alone.
The completed multiple sequence alignment was used to
infer a phylogeny using MrBayes 3.1.2. We used the mixed
model option to choose the amino acid substitution
model, a gamma rate distribution parameter estimated
from our dataset, and saving every 100th tree. Two parallel
Markov chains were run simultaneously in each of two
runs. Tree length, amino acid model, log-likelihood score
and alpha value of the gamma distribution were examined in the program Tracer v1.3 prior to the termination
of MrBayes to ensure that all parameters had reached stationarity. Saved trees from after the burn-in were summarised and posterior probabilities estimated.
Gene amplification from cDNA
When the validity of a predicted gene was in doubt, we
amplified a portion of the gene in question from cDNA
(carried out for NOS1, NOS2, Pelle, PPO, GNBP3,
GNBP11, TEP1). To this end, we extracted RNA from five
wild-caught D. pulex that were visibly infected with microsporidia and stored in RNA-later (Quiagen Inc) using the
following methods. Samples were pooled by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 1 minute, and the RNA-later was

removed. Trizol (Gibco BRL) was added to the remaining
Daphnia, which were subsequently crushed with a homogenizer. Total RNA was extracted following the manufacturer's protocol for phase separation, precipitation and
wash steps. An additional DNase I (Ambion) step was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Total RNA was quantified by UV spectophotometry and
approximately half of the total RNA was further processed
using the Poly(A)purist kit (Ambion) according to the recommended protocol in order to isolate mRNA. Reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was
carried out from both total RNA and mRNA to make
cDNA in 10 l reactions using 250 ng of total RNA or 10
ng of mRNA using the Accuscript high fidelity PCR system
(Strategene).
All primers were designed within exons using Primer3
http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/
primer3_www.cgi. PCR was carried out in 50 l reactions
using a mix containing 1 l of cDNA made from either the
total RNA or mRNA (used to amplify rare transcripts), and
1 unit of Pfu (Strategene) as outlined in the enzyme
instructions. In addition, a single pair of primers was
designed such that they overlaid intron/exon boundaries
of a portion of the D. pulex prophenoloxidase gene. These
primers were included as a control in a PCR from the total
RNA and mRNA in order to verify that no genomic template contaminant was present in the sample. The PCR
cycling profile was as follows: 95°C for 1 minute, followed by 39 cycles of 95°C for 30 seconds, 56°C for 30
seconds, 68°C for 3 minutes/kb of product; a final extension of 68°C for 10 minutes completed the PCR program.
Each PCR product was cleaned by treatment of shrimp
alkaline phosphotase and exonuclease I. Treated PCR
products were sequenced directly in both directions in a
10 l mix containing 1.0 l Big Dye (Amersham), 3.0 l
5× buffer (Amersham), 0.5 l primer and 1–3 l of PCR
product. Sequences were aligned to the genomic scaffold
sequence to verify that the correct gene had been amplified and that the annotation was correct.
