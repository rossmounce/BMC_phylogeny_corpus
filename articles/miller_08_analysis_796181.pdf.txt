Abstract
Background: Many commercial banana varieties lack sources of resistance to pests and diseases, as a consequence of
sterility and narrow genetic background. Fertile wild relatives, by contrast, possess greater variability and represent
potential sources of disease resistance genes (R-genes). The largest known family of plant R-genes encode proteins with
nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. Conserved motifs in such genes in
diverse plant species offer a means for isolation of candidate genes in banana which may be involved in plant defence.
Results: A computational strategy was developed for unbiased conserved motif discovery in NBS and LRR domains in
R-genes and homologues in monocotyledonous plant species. Degenerate PCR primers targeting conserved motifs were
tested on the wild cultivar Musa acuminata subsp. burmannicoides, var. Calcutta 4, which is resistant to a number of fungal
pathogens and nematodes. One hundred and seventy four resistance gene analogs (RGAs) were amplified and assembled
into 52 contiguous sequences. Motifs present were typical of the non-TIR NBS-LRR RGA subfamily. A phylogenetic
analysis of deduced amino-acid sequences for 33 RGAs with contiguous open reading frames (ORFs), together with
RGAs from Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, grouped most Musa RGAs within monocotyledon-specific clades. RFLPRGA markers were developed, with 12 displaying distinct polymorphisms in parentals and F1 progeny of a diploid M.
acuminata mapping population. Eighty eight BAC clones were identified in M. acuminata Calcutta 4, M. acuminata Grande
Naine, and M. balbisiana Pisang Klutuk Wulung BAC libraries when hybridized to two RGA probes. Multiple copy RGAs
were common within BAC clones, potentially representing variation reservoirs for evolution of new R-gene specificities.
Conclusion: This is the first large scale analysis of NBS-LRR RGAs in M. acuminata Calcutta 4. Contig sequences were
deposited in GenBank and assigned numbers ER935972 – ER936023. RGA sequences and isolated BACs are a valuable
resource for R-gene discovery, and in future applications will provide insight into the organization and evolution of NBSLRR R-genes in the Musa A and B genome. The developed RFLP-RGA markers are applicable for genetic map
development and marker assisted selection for defined traits such as pest and disease resistance.

Background
Commercial banana varieties, which are mainly derived
from Musa acuminata Colla, and M. balbisiana Colla, are
cultivated in 130 countries across the tropics and subtropics, generating an annual production in excess of 100
million tons, and contributing significantly to food security [1]. Susceptible to over 50 fungal pathogens, as well as
a number of bacterial pathogens, nematodes, viruses and
insect pests, greatest threats to global banana production
are currently caused by the fungal pathogens
Mycosphaerella fijiensis, causal organism of black leaf streak
disease (BLSD), and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense race
4, which causes Fusarium wilt. Agrochemical control of
BLSD can be socio-economically and environmentally
inappropriate, and requires integrated strategies to avoid
the development of fungicide resistance in the pathogen.
In the case of Fusarium wilt, however, chemical control is
ineffective. For these reasons, the development of new disease resistant varieties is of paramount importance for the
Musa industry. Although ranked as the fourth most
important food commodity in terms of production value
after rice, wheat and maize, genetic improvement of Musa
has been limited. Cultivars have evolved from diploid, triploid and tetraploid wild species of M. acuminata (A
genome) and M. balbisiana (B genome). Whilst wild species are generally fertile, many of today's commercial cultivars are sterile triploids or diploids, with fruit
development via parthenocarpy. This translates to seedless fruits, or fruits which contain mostly non-viable
seeds. As such cultivars have largely evolved via asexual
vegetative propagation, their genetic base is narrow, with
diversity dependent upon somatic mutation. Such limited
genetic variation has resulted in a commercial crop that
lacks resistance to pests and disease, as observed in cultivars such as Gros Michel and Grande Naine [2].
As sources of resistance to pathogens exist in germplasm,
across the Musa genus, introgression of R-genes into susceptible cultivars offers potential for overcoming current
constraints with conventional breeding. Resistant plant
genotypes can prevent pathogen entry via a "gene for
gene" defence mechanism, which, in the simplest model,
is initiated through a direct or indirect interaction
between a constitutive resistance (R) gene product and a
specific biotrophic pathogen avirulence (Avr) gene product, or elicitor [3]. This recognition is postulated to trigger
a chain of signal transduction events, leading to activation
of defence mechanisms such as the hypersensitive
response (HR), synthesis of antimicrobial proteins and
metabolites, cell wall thickening and vessel blockage.
Over the last 15 years, over 40 R-genes have been characterized from both model plants and important crop species [4], conferring resistance to several pathogens.
Despite the wide range of recognized pathogen taxa, Rgenes encode proteins that share significant sequence sim-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/15

ilarity and structural motifs, suggesting common proteinprotein interactions as components of receptor systems
and common roles in signalling events in plant defence
responses.
To date, five principal classes of R-genes have been identified, based upon conserved protein domains (for review
see [4]). The most abundant class are the cytoplasmic
nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR)
proteins [5]. The other classes comprise proteins with
extracytoplasmic LRRs (eLRRs) anchored to a transmembrane (TM) domain (receptor-like proteins [RLPs]), cytoplasmic serine-threonine (Ser/Thr) receptor-like kinases
(RLKs) with extracellular LRRs, cytoplasmic Ser/Thr
kinases without LRRs, and proteins with a membrane
anchor fused to a coiled coil (CC) domain. The common
NBS-LRR-encoding proteins currently include over 20
functionally proven R-genes from diverse plant species
[6,7]. Studies have focused on this family because its only
known function to date is in disease resistance [8,9]. Gene
products are composed of a conserved N-terminal NBS
and variable length C-terminal LRR domain of 10 to 40
short LRR motifs [10]. The NBS domain is important for
ATP binding and hydrolysis and is believed to be involved
in signal transduction, triggered by the presence of the
pathogen [11-13]. The LRR domain is likely to be
involved in protein-protein interactions, recognizing
pathogen elicitor molecules [14,15]. A high mutation rate
in the LRR contributes to genetic variability, necessary for
specific recognition of diverse pathogens [16]. Two subfamilies exist in NBS-LRR R proteins based upon N-terminal motifs. The TIR NBS subfamily R proteins display
homology between the N-terminal amino acid motif and
the receptor domain in Drosophila Toll and basal mammalian Interleukin (IL) 1 immunity factors in animals [17].
Non-TIR NBS subfamily R proteins can contain an N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) motif, a subset of which code for a
leucine zipper sequence (LZ). TIR subfamily NBS-LRR
proteins appear to be restricted to dicotyledons. As they
have been reported in gymnosperms, grasses may have
lost this type of R-gene family [18,19]. By contrast, nonTIR subfamily NBS-LRR proteins are present in both
monocotyledons and dicotyledons [6]. Conserved amino
acid motifs have been described in the NBS domains in
these subfamilies [20], which include the phosphatebinding loop or 'P-loop' (also called kinase 1), kinase 2
[21,22], GLPL (also called kinase 3) and RNBS-A, B, C and
D motifs [6]. The final amino acid within the kinase 2
motif can commonly reveal differences between TIR and
non-TIR types, with an aspartic acid residue in TIRs and a
tryptophan in non-TIRs [6].
Degenerate primers targeting conserved motifs have been
used to amplify resistance gene analogs (RGAs) from
diverse plant taxa such as soybean [23], A. thaliana [24],

rice [25], and peanut [26], amongst others (for review see
[27]). Many RGAs are phylogenetically related to known
R-genes, and a number of studies have shown homologues mapping to R-gene loci (e.g. [23,24]), providing
evidence that such genomic regions likely code for resistance. In Musa, progress in RGA characterization began
recently, with only nine NBS-LRR disease resistance-like
protein sequences currently deposited in GenBank
(accessed December 2007). A number of non-TIR NBS
RGAs have been amplified in wild M. acuminata and M.
balbisiana accessions Gongjiao, Xinyiyejiao, as well as in
cultivated species Zhongshandajiao, Fenjiao and Williams
[28]. Other groups have described Cf orthologs in landrace Zebrina GF [29], and Pto family RGAs in M. acuminata cv Tuu Gia [30]. Characterization of NBS RGAs has
also recently been extended to Musa species M. ornata, M.
schizocarpa, M. textilis, and M. velutina [31].
Given that sequences so far studied are likely to represent
only a small fraction of these resistance gene families in
Musa, the objectives of this study were to identify NBSLRR RGAs and explore their diversity in M. acuminata
subsp. burmannicoides, var. Calcutta 4. This wild diploid
cultivar has been used extensively in breeding programs,
offering resistance to important fungal pathogens and
nematodes. We describe a computational strategy for
motif discovery, enabling PCR amplification of target
motifs within NBS and LRR domains, and potentially
applicable across different monocotyledonous species.
Applied together with universal TIR and non-TIR NBS-targeting degenerate primers, we report the first large scale
analysis of RGAs in M. acuminata Calcutta 4. Evolutionary
relationships both among Musa sequences and RGAs
from A. thaliana and O. sativa were determined, and polymorphic RFLP-RGA markers identified against M. acuminata mapping population parentals. Selected sequences
were used to identify putative resistance gene loci across
M. acuminata Calcutta 4, M. acuminata Grande Naine and
M. balbisiana Pisang Klutuk Wulung BAC libraries.

Results
Degenerate primer design
Public databases at present contain only very limited
numbers of Musa R-gene or RGA sequences. In order to
enrich the fraction of RGA candidates in Musa recoverable
by PCR, an in silico protocol was devised to facilitate
design of degenerate primers derived from monocotyledon sequences and targeting NBS and additional
domains. Figure 1 depicts the process, beginning with
HMMER-based selection of monocotyledon sequences
from GenBank containing a characteristic domain shared
by R-genes (Pfam id: NB-ARC). Following removal of
redundant sequences (using a 95% identity threshold),
181 RGA candidates were obtained. Based on this subset,
a search for conserved sequence motifs was conducted

using the program MEME [32]. NBS-family motifs (Ploop, Kinase-2, GLPL, RNBS-D) were observed across the
sequences, as well as novel conserved motifs outside the
NBS domain, mostly within the LRR domain. All the conserved motifs identified served as candidates for degenerate primer design, with an additional constraint imposed,
whereby motifs or close variants had to be present in at
least 25% of the sequences (motif coverage). Primer
design was conducted using the program CODEHOP
[33].
Isolation of NBS-LRR RGAs
A total of 860 high quality sequences were generated from
insert-containing recombinant plasmids, of which 174
showed significant similarity to known A. thaliana Rgenes and homologues (E-value ≤ 10-5), based upon
searches using the BLASTX program. These sequences
were obtained by PCR amplification with two distinct
groups of primer combinations: universal primers taken
from literature [23,26,34] and primers designed in this
study. Universal TIR and non-TIR NBS-LRR-targeting
primer combinations 1–7 (Table 1) resulted in PCR products of expected size, with P-loop to GLPL primer pairs
yielding a single DNA band of approximately 650 bp, and
P-loop to RNBS-D primer combinations a product close
to 700 bp. High quality sequences were generated from
168 distinct clones, of which, following trimming and

vector masking, 36 (21.43%) showed similarity with NBScontaining proteins in A. thaliana. The percentage of
clones displaying similarity to RGAs varied between different primer combinations, ranging from 0–68% (Table
2).
Primer combinations 8–14, which were derived from the
computational pipeline described in Figure 1, targeted
conserved amino acid motifs in non-TIR NBS-LRR
sequences in monocotyledon and dicotyledon plants
(Table 1). Combinations eight (39F1-1R1), 10 (P1c-P3b),
12 (3F2-11R1), 13 (2F-13R1), and 14 (2F-11R1) did not

amplify reproducible PCR products. By contrast, primer
combinations 11 (3F2-13R1) and nine (1F-P3b) consistently amplified products of approximately 650 bp in size,
with 138 sequences showing similarity to RGAs in A. thaliana. Combination 11 was the more efficient of the two,
with 54% of clones homologous to R-genes or RGAs
(Table 2).
Most sequences that were not RGAs showed similarity to
retroelements. These can constitute a large fraction of the
plant genome [35] and many R-gene loci have been
reported to contain interspersed transposable elements

[36,37]. Considerable amplification of retroelements may
also be expected because of their high copy number at the
start of the reaction [38], which results in competition
during PCR, even when primer match is poor.
Analysis of assembled RGA sequences
Assembly of all 174 RGA sequences generated 62 contigs,
with 52 complete sequences between primers following
re-sequencing of selected clones. Thirty three contigs
showed uninterrupted open reading frames (ORFs)
encoding RGAs, with the remainder containing premature
stop codons, and/or frameshifts. These latter sequences
are likely derived from pseudogenes, PCR mutants or artefacts. Translation of complete Musa NBS-encoding
sequences produced an equal number of non-redundant
protein sequences. The average size of trimmed complete
sequences (without RGA primers) was 610 bp, with an
average 4.6 sequence coverage per consensus. Maximum
and minimum sizes for these sequences were 1365 bp and
273 bp, respectively. The largest contig (MaRGA41) was
isolated using P-loop and GLPL-targeting primers (primer
combination 3). The GLPL motif sequence was the rare
variant GSPL; and perhaps because of this, the GLPLbased primer did not bind to this site, but to a 3'-distal
site, which may explain the larger and unexpected size of
this product. Interestingly, the isolation of an anomalously large RGA for exactly the same reason was also
observed in Arachis [26]. The TIR NBS class RGAs have
been reported to be absent in monocotyledon genomes
[19], and within this study all Musa RGAs conformed to
the non-TIR NBS class, with a final tryptophan residue
present in the kinase 2 motif.
Phylogenetic analysis
A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of aligned amino acid
sequences between the NBS kinase 2 and GLPL motifs was
conducted in the 33 full length Musa sequences with contiguous ORFs, together with 21 representative non-TIR
NBS-LRR class sequences from A. thaliana and 43 from O.
sativa (Figure 2). Significant divergence was observed in
the tree, with a total of 22 clades. Such variability has been
described previously in non-TIR NBS sequences [10].
Musa sequences were divergent, indicating the presence of
a diverse family of genes coding for proteins with NBSLRR domains. Although dependent upon sample size, two
clades contained sequences that appear to be specific to
M. acuminata Calcutta 4 (clades 6 and 11). In contrast, a
number of sequence types which may have expanded in
monocotyledons were also observed, with M. acuminata
Calcutta 4 sequences grouped together with a number
from O. sativa (clades 3, 4, 5, 9 and 22). Musa RGAs also
grouped with others from A. thaliana (clade 14), indicating amplification of conserved sequences which may be
present throughout the angiosperms.

RFLP-RGA markers
From a total of 33 Musa RGAs evaluated as RFLP markers
with restricted genomic DNA from mapping population
parentals M. acuminata Borneo and Pisang Lilin, 30 displayed single locus or multiple loci polymorphisms on
parentals, with at least one restriction enzyme (Table 3).
Across the polymorphisms observed, 12 distinct fingerprint types were observed, when using enzymes DraI and
HindIII. RGA probes MaRGA04, MaRGA07, MaRGA08,
MaRGA12, MaRGA13, MaRGA14, MaRGA16, MaRGA22,
MaRGA37, MaRGA41, MaRGA43, and MaRGA46 represented each polymorphism pattern. Figure 3 shows examples of multiple loci polymorphisms observed on
Southern blots of restricted parental DNA hybridized with
probes MaRGA08 and MaRGA37. Segregation of selected
polymorphic bands according to Mendelian ratios in a
subset of F1 progeny for this mapping population is
depicted in Figure 4.
Physical distribution of Musa RGAs
Musa RGAs were used to screen BAC libraries derived from
the wild type species M. acuminata Calcutta 4 (AA), M. balbisiana Pisang Klutuk Wulung (PKW) (BB) and the commercial triploid M. acuminata Grande Naine (AAA). In
order to maximise identification of BAC clones containing
target RGA loci, MaRGA08 and MaRGA37 were selected as
probes, based upon differences in protein domains,
motifs and phylogenetic clade. In all, 62 hits to BAC
clones on high density filters were identified across the
three genomes when screened with probe MaRGA08, and
43 hits when screened with probe MaRGA37. These
clones were then fingerprinted and re-hybridized to their
corresponding probe, to verify positive coordinates identified in the first screen and to provide data on copy
number of NBS and NBS-LRR sequences across the three
Musa genomes. A total of 88 out of 105 clones were verified, with only 17 clones failing to produce visible bands
on Southern blots when hybridised to their respective
probe (Table 4). False positives may have arisen as a result
of identification of incorrect coordinates on BAC filters,
failures in BAC plasmid preparation, problems in DNA
blotting, or as a result of probe labelling or hybridization
failure. MaRGA08 occurred as both a single copy and as
multiple copies in validated BACs across the three
genomes, with M. acuminata Calcutta 4 BAC clones harbouring mostly single-copy RGAs, in contrast to Grande
Naine and PKW, where BACs contained up to nine and
eleven copies, respectively. Figure 5 shows re-validated M.
balbisiana BAC clones with high densities of this RGA.
MaRGA37 was also present as multiple copies in validated
BACs across the three genomes, with M. acuminata Calcutta 4 BAC clones harbouring up to six copies, PKW BAC
clones two copies, and Grande Naine BACs containing up
to nine copies. Both were therefore clearly members of
multigene families, with a total of 232 copies of

positive clones identified across the 3 BAC libraries.

Discussion
In contrast to most commercial Musa varieties, where
genetic diversity is typically fixed by vegetative propagation, the sexually active cultivar M. acuminata Calcutta 4
represents an important source of novel genes for transfer
across varieties. We report the first large scale analysis of
NBS-LRR RGAs in this cultivar, using a degenerate primer
design strategy devised for targeted RGA amplification
across monocotyledon genomes. Given that R-genes are
frequently located in clusters across genomes, with
numerous copies of homologous sequences, Musa BACs
containing RGAs were identified, as a resource for pinpointing candidate genes and for contributing to our
understanding of R gene evolution. Polymorphic RGA
genetic markers developed also offer potential for genetic
improvement via marker assisted selection strategies.
Characterization of RGAs
The PCR approach designed for RGA discovery in monocotyledon species was effective in M. acuminata Calcutta 4.
All 174 cloned RGAs belonged to the non-TIR NBS-LRR
subfamily, as expected, with considerable divergence
observed at the amino acid level (Figure 2). From 52 complete NBS-encoding protein sequence contigs, 33 nonredundant sequences contained contiguous ORFs, which
is a considerable number given that of the 157 putative
genes in the Arabidopsis genome that code for NBS-type

resistance proteins, 30% are of the non-TIR class [39].
However, our total may still reflect only a small portion of
NBS-LRR sequences in M. acuminata, given that around
600 such sequences exist in rice [40]. All Musa RGAs
encoded proteins with expected amino acid motifs, and
showed homology to both putative R-genes and functional R-genes, such as At1g12290 in A. thaliana, which is
a paralog of the R-gene RPS5, which confers resistance to
Pseudomonas syringae. Of the Musa RGAs with contiguous
ORFs, it is therefore possible that some may serve as functional R-gene candidates against diverse pathogens.
Numerous pseudogenes were also co-amplified. These
likely arise through point mutations, insertions or nucleotide deletions, acting as reservoirs for variation and offering the potential for recombination or gene conversion
between R-gene alleles or paralogs [16]. In total, seven
primer sets amplified RGAs, three targeting both universal
TIR and non-TIR NBS motifs (primer pairs 1, 3 and 4),
and four targeting non-TIR NBS motifs (primer pairs 5, 6,
9 and 11). A number of factors may have contributed to
the success rate of primers. Our design strategy for monocotyledons took into account the number of degeneracies,
primer length, nucleotide composition, degeneracy position within each primer, and prevalence of putative targets
in the sequences analysed. Universal primer combinations designed for both TIR and non-TIR NBS motifs in
dicot sequences were relatively inefficient, with a maximum of 29% of sequences homologous to RGAs when
amplified with primer combination 1. Amplification was
most efficient using non-TIR targeting primers, with

sequences from A. thaliana and 43 from O. sativa. Clade numbers are included to facilitate discussion of data. All additional
information for Musa tree sequences are summarised in Table 3. The branch lengths are proportional to the average number
of amino acid substitutions per site, as indicated by the scale.

both NBS and LRR domains have only been described in
plant resistance genes so far. Given that primer combination 11 produced amplicons from the NBS kinase 2 to a
conserved motif within the LRR domain, efficiency in
amplification of targets involved in disease resistance is
therefore potentially greater.

67.74% and 54.18% of sequences that were amplified,
respectively, with primer combinations 6 and 11, showing
significant similarity to R-genes and RGAs.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed considerable polymorphism, with Musa RGAs separating into eight distinct
clades, with a number defining Musa specific clades. Such
variability might be expected, given that non-TIR NBSLRR sequences are often more heterogeneous than the TIR
subfamily in plant taxa [10]. Sequences generated with
primers targeting non-TIR motifs were more diverse than
those produced with universal primers targeting motifs
common to both TIR and non-TIR subfamilies. A higher
degree of polymorphism exists in LRR domains in NBSLRR family R-genes and homologues, as a result of diversifying selective pressure [16]. Primers targeting this
domain are thus likely to promote amplification of
diverse RGAs. Primer pair 11, the only to target both NBS
and LRR motifs, was not only the second most efficient
primer combination for RGA amplification, but also a
primer pair amplifying diverse RGAs, which were spread
across a number of clades. The literature shows that the
NBS domain is present in both plant resistance genes,
together with genes coding for kinases or ATP/GTPdependent enzymes. By contrast, proteins containing

Diversity observed among the Musa RGAs suggests a contribution towards evolutionary fitness in the plant. Both
R-genes and pathogen Avr genes are under constant evolutionary pressure, with mutation in the pathogen resulting in loss of resistance in the plant. Understanding Rgene evolution mechanisms is essential for determining
how plants maintain their resistance to pathogens
[21,41]. Potential genetic mechanisms responsible for Rgene genetic variation and evolution in plant taxa include
recombination, gene conversion, unequal crossing over,
transposable elements and point mutations, with the latter considered the principal evolutionary mechanism
[16]. In general, sequence similarity was high between
Musa sequences within each individual clade, suggesting
recent evolutionary divergence. However, given that
Musa-containing clades contained relatively few RGA contig sequences, tree topologies may only be approximate,
as a result of insufficient sampling. As we targeted motifs
present in at least 25% of monocotyledon-derived
sequences containing the NBS-LRR domains, we are perhaps also biased to such sequences. A fully comprehensive
analysis of non-TIR NBS-LRR sequences in M. acuminata
will require multiple primer sets, together with more
exhaustive sequencing of amplicons. Although our study
did not report amplification of any TIR NBS-LRR RGAs, in
agreement with the hypothesis that the TIR subfamily is
restricted to dicotyledonous taxa [41], existence of the TIR
motif has now been reported in the rice genome, albeit in
reduced numbers [18,19]. Lack of detection in the Musa
monocotyledon genome may therefore reflect limitations
in PCR amplification.
RGA applications in mapping
In support of the hypothesis that genes conferring quantitative resistance may show homology to R-genes, as originally proposed by [42], numerous RGAs have been
mapped to genomic regions for quantitative trait loci
associated with resistance (e.g. [23,43]). Within our study,
RGAs displayed single locus or multiple loci polymorphisms on M. acuminata parentals. Similar degrees of polymorphism using RGAs as RFLP probes have been
observed in rice [43]. Together with SSR and DArT markers, our RGAs have been included on a reference genetic
map which is under development. As most mapping programs in Musa have faced problems with production and
maintenance of large populations, mainly as a result of
translocation events which complicate gamete formation
and segregation [44,45], this latest attempt involves a

and Musa acuminata spp. malaccensis "Pisang Lilin",
which is reported to carry only a single translocation
event. This mapping project will serve as a base for development of a core set of markers for uptake in future mapping projects in banana. Analysis of our RGA markers on
mapping populations segregating for resistance to biotic
stresses is required to determine linkage between RGAs
and R-gene loci. Such R-gene markers would be valuable
in marker-assisted selection programs for trait selection.
Utilized in high resolution genetic mapping, RGA markers
may also serve as an effective approach for map-based
cloning of Musa R-genes.
Physical distribution of Musa RGAs
Clustering of multi-copy R gene families and RGAs is
common in plant genomes [39,43] with up to 60% of Rgenes clustered [46], as a result of tandem duplications of
paralogous sequences [47]. As RGAs frequently cluster
around such loci, they can therefore serve as useful candidates for R-gene discovery across BAC libraries. Eighty
eight RGA-positive clones were revalidated, a number
which is expected for R-genes, given that they are often
members of large gene families. No co-hybridization was
observed with probes MaRGA08 and MaRGA37. This is

also perhaps expected, as probe sequences were phylogenetically distinct, and were amplified using primer sets
targeting different motifs. Given that greater polymorphism is expected in LRR domains in NBS-LRR R-genes,
comparison of number of BAC hits between the two RGA
probes supported this idea. MaRGA08 was amplified with
a primer pair targeting degenerate kinase 2 and LRR
motifs, and the probe hybridized to a greater number of
clones than MaRGA37, which targeted more conserved
NBS P-loop and GLPL motifs. Analysis of copy number of
RGAs in re-validated BAC clones (Table 4 and Figure 5)
showed that in addition to occupying potential multiple
loci across the three genomes, multiple copies are also
common in positive BACs for both RGA probes. Probe
MaRGA08, which targeted NBS-LRR sequences, revealed
in general more copies per BAC than probe MaRGA37,
which targeted NBS domains only. Given the greater
diversity in LRR motifs, perhaps diversifying selection has
resulted in an increase in NBS-LRR RGA copy number, via
gene duplication. Within such RGA clusters, numerous Rgenes may be present conferring resistance to different
strains of a particular pathogen or to different pathogen
taxa [48]. Such genomic organization may also represent
a variation reservoir, from which new R-gene specificities
may evolve.

BAC clones identified were reconfirmed via re-hybridization of probes MaRGA08 and MaRGA37 to Southern blots of restricted BAC clones

Given that 33 contiguous Musa RGAs were identified in
our study, further testing of additional probes representative of distinct clades against the Musa BAC libraries
would likely identify more putative resistance loci across
the three genomes. Ongoing shotgun sequencing of a
number of clones from each of the Musa BAC libraries will
contribute to our understanding of the organization and
mechanisms governing evolution of NBS-LRR resistance
gene regions, with comparisons of alleles within each
genome and orthologs across the three genomes, and will
provide an additional basis for genetic marker development.

Conclusion
Given the low genetic diversity existent in commercial
Musa cultivars, the rapid spread of fungal pathogens,
together with the slow progress in gene discovery in Musa,
this conserved orthologous sequences (COS) marker
approach towards R-gene discovery was conducted, to
provide potential opportunities for genetic improvement
via marker assisted selection, genetic breeding and genetic
engineering. This work, as well as reporting the first large
scale analysis of RGA diversity in M. acuminata Calcutta 4,
described a primer design strategy for NBS-LRR RGAs
across monocotyledonous genomes, and developed
RFLP-RGA markers for genetic mapping. RGA-containing
BAC clones will serve as a resource for map-based cloning,
and will contribute to our understanding of the organisa-

tion and evolution of NBS-LRR R-genes in the Musa A and
B genomes.

Methods
Plant material and DNA extraction
M. acuminata Calcutta 4 plants [Musa Germplasm Information System (MGIS) accession number NEU0017,
genus section EUMUSA] [49] were propagated in vitro and
plants maintained in a greenhouse. Genomic DNA was
extracted using a standard CTAB approach, with young
leaf tissues macerated using a Bio 101 Thermo Savant
FastPrep® FP 120 cell disrupter (Qbiogene, Irvine, CA,
USA). For RFLP-RGA marker development, genomic DNA
was extracted from young leaves in M. acuminata mapping
population parentals Borneo (NEU 0028 – ITC 0253) and
Pisang Lilin (NEU 0063 – ITC001), together with F1 progeny, using a modified mixed alkyl trimethyl ammonium
bromide (MATAB) procedure [50].
Degenerate primer sets
Nine degenerate primers were designed in this study (Figure 6, Table 1). Seven were designed based upon conserved motifs in non-TIR NBS-LRR domain-containing
monocotyledon sequences obtained from Genbank
(primers 39F1, 1F, 3F2, and 2F [all forward], and 1R1,
13R1, and 11R1 [all reverse]). Primers P1C and P3B targeted non-TIR NBS-LRR protein motifs in dicotyledons,
designed following alignment of resistance proteins

Cloning and sequencing
Following electrophoresis, PCR products of expected size
were purified using a Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification
kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Ca, USA). Products were cloned
using either pGEM-T-Easy (Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
or pCR2.1TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Ligations were desalted using Millipore dialysis membranes
(0.02 μM) and DH5α Escherichia coli cells were transformed either by electroporation using a GenePulser II
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) set at 2.5 kV and 200Ω, or
via a standard heat shock protocol. Recombinant plasmid
clones were selected and manipulated following standard
protocols [51]. Forward and reverse sequencing of clones
was conducted on ABI 377 and 3700 DNA sequencers
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), using, for
each respective sequencer, a DYEnamic ET Terminator
Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway,
NJ, USA) and an ABI BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

thaliana RPS2 (gi:548086) and RPS1 (gi:963017), and the
C. elegans Cell death protein 4. Additional universal primers targeting both TIR and non-TIR NBS-LRR R proteins
were also tested, which were previously designed from
conserved motifs (Table 1) present in several dicotyledonous plant RGAs (A. thaliana, Linum usitatissimum, Solanum lycopersicon, Nicotiana glutinosa and Solanum
tuberosum). Universal forward primers comprised P1A,
P1B [26], and LM638 [23], and reverse primers P3A, P3D
[26], and RNBSD-rev [34]. In total, 14 out of the 16 possible primer combinations were tested (Table 2).
PCR amplification
Each PCR reaction was performed in a 25 μl volume, containing 50 ng of template genomic DNA, 2.5 mM MgCl2,
0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.5 μM of each primer, 1.25 U of Taq
polymerase (Phoneutria, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil),
and 1× IB Taq polymerase buffer (Phoneutria, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil). Temperature cycling was conducted
with the following program: 96°C for 5 min; 35 cycles of
96°C for 1 min, 45°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min; plus
an extra elongation period of 10 min at 72°C.

Sequence analysis
Sequences were processed to remove vector and poor
quality sequences using the Staden sequence analysis software package [52]. Contig assembly was performed using
CAP3 [53] and by manual editing. RGAs were identified
on the basis of sequence similarity using the program
BLASTX [54], against a local database of A. thaliana Rgenes and homologues, as described in [26]. Further confirmation was obtained by checking for the Pfam NB-ARC
domain [12], which is a protein domain characteristic of
plant resistance genes, using the program HMMER [55].
Only unbroken reading frames between the NBS domain
kinase 2 and GLPL motifs (a common sequence to all generated contigs) were retained. Derived protein sequence
alignments were obtained using the program MUSCLE
[56], and included 21 representative non-TIR NBS-LRR
sequences from A. thaliana and 43 from O. sativa. Bayesian phylogenetic inference was performed using the program MrBayes v.3.1.2 [57], according to the
Jones+Gamma model, using 6 parallel Monte Carlo
chains over 106 generations. The reliability of tree topologies was tested by bootstrapping 1000 times, with construction of a final majority rule consensus tree.
Identification of polymorphic RGA genetic markers
Musa RGAs were hybridized on restricted genomic DNA
of parentals M. acuminata spp. microcarpa Borneo and
Pisang Lilin. Restriction enzyme survey test blots were
conducted to identify probe/enzyme combinations
revealing polymorphisms, using Musa RGA clones representative of 33 contigs as candidate RFLP probes. Parental
genomic DNA (91 μg) was digested separately with 1040
U each of enzymes DraI, EcoRV, and HindIII, followed by
removal of proteins and salts. RFLP digests (20 μl) were
separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels run over-

night at 30 V in 1× TAE buffer, together with 1 kb Ladder
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Raoul markers (Appligene, Illkirch, France). Southern blotting onto Hybond
N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ,
USA) was conducted via capillary transfer with 0.25N HCl
depurination solution, 0.4N NaOH neutralization solution, and 0.4N NaOH transfer solution, according to
standard protocols. Test blot membranes were placed in
pre-hybridization buffer (20 × SSPE, 20% SDS, Denhart's
50 ×, E. coli tRNA (10 mg/ml)) and incubated overnight at
65°C in a rotisserie oven. RGA probes were denatured at
95°C for 5 min, and 5 μl labelled with 4 μl (α-32P dCTP)
via random hexanucleotide primed DNA synthesis using
a Megaprime™ DNA Labelling System RPN 1607 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Probes were
added to 20 ml of hybridization solution (20 × SSPE, 20%
SDS, Denhart's 50 ×, E. coli tRNA [10 mg/ml], 50% Dextran/H2O) and again incubated overnight at 65°C. In
order to remove non-specific background following
hybridization, membranes were washed at 65°C for 20
min, twice in wash solution 1 (5 × SSPE), once in wash
solution 2 (1 × SSPE and 0.1 × SDS), and once in wash
solution 3 (0.1 × SSPE and 0.1 × SDS). Membranes were
air dried and hybridization fingerprints observed after
both overnight exposure on a filmless autoradiography
Storm 820 imaging system (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and a 7 day room temperature exposure using autoradiography film and intensifying screens.
Scorable fragment length polymorphisms were examined
for each RGA probe/restriction enzyme combination.
Physical distribution of Musa RGAs
Two RGA probes were hybridized to high density colony
filters representing previously constructed BAC libraries
M. acuminata Calcutta 4 (AA) [58], M. acuminata Grande

Naine (AAA) [59], and M. balbisiana Pisang Klutuk
Wulung (PKW) (BB) [60]. Probe labelling, hybridization,
washing and exposure procedures were as described earlier. For all positive BAC clones identified, 3 μl of glycerol
stock for each clone were inoculated into 3 ml of 2 × YT
medium containing chloramphenicol (12.5 μg/ml), and
grown at 37°C for 14 h. BAC DNA isolation was conducted using a standard alkaline lysis procedure on a QIAGEN BIO ROBOT 9600 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).
DNA samples (500 ng) were digested overnight with 40 U
of HindIII or EcoRI (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA,
USA), loaded onto 1% gels and fragments separated by
overnight electrophoresis at 40 V. BAC clones initially
identified on high density filters were validated by rehybridization with the corresponding RGA probe used in
initial BAC filter screening, using blotting and probe
hybridization procedures as described for RGA genetic
marker studies.
