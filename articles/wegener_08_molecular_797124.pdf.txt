Drosophila neuropeptide evolution characterization of fruit fly neuropeptides outside <it>Drosophila melanogaster</it> provides insights

Abstract
Background: Neuropeptides comprise the most diverse group of neuronal signaling molecules.
They often occur as multiple sequence-related copies within single precursors (the
prepropeptides). These multiple sequence-related copies have not arisen by gene duplication, and
it is debated whether they are mutually redundant or serve specific functions. The fully sequenced
genomes of 12 Drosophila species provide a unique opportunity to study the molecular evolution
of neuropeptides.
Results: We data-mined the 12 Drosophila genomes for homologs of neuropeptide genes identified
in Drosophila melanogaster. We then predicted peptide precursors and the neuropeptidome, and
biochemically identified about half of the predicted peptides by direct mass spectrometric profiling
of neuroendocrine tissue in four species covering main phylogenetic lines of Drosophila. We found
that all species have an identical neuropeptidome and peptide hormone complement. Calculation
of amino acid distances showed that ortholog peptide copies are highly sequence-conserved
between species, whereas the observed sequence variability between peptide copies within single
precursors must have occurred prior to the divergence of the Drosophila species.
Conclusion: We provide a first genomic and chemical characterization of fruit fly neuropeptides
outside D. melanogaster. Our results suggest that neuropeptides including multiple peptide copies
are under stabilizing selection, which suggests that multiple peptide copies are functionally
important and not dispensable. The last common ancestor of Drosophila obviously had a set of
neuropeptides and peptide hormones identical to that of modern fruit flies. This is remarkable,
since drosophilid flies have adapted to very different environments.

Background

Neuropeptides comprise the most diverse group of intercellular signaling molecules in eumetazoan animals and regulate
vital physiological processes as hormones, neuromodulators
or neurotransmitters. Since neuropeptides are too small to be
directly channeled into the regulated secretory pathway, they

are post-translationally processed from larger prepropeptides by enzymatic cleavage.
In vertebrates, gene or genome duplications are main events
that have led to the diversity of neuropeptides [1-4]. Over
time, each prepropeptide gene acquires nucleotide substitutions that - if inside a peptide-coding sequence and not

synonymous - will result in altered peptide sequence. If the
peptide's function is vital and interference with peptide signaling decreases Darwinian fitness, there will be stabilizing
selection on at least that part of the peptide sequence responsible for receptor binding and activation. In consequence, the
peptide sequence will be conserved over time [4]. In fact, the
sequences of many ortholog neuropeptides, such as oxytocin
or somatostatin, have been highly conserved throughout vertebrate phylogeny [4]. However, considerable sequence variation can be found between duplicated peptides of a family,
for example, in the growth hormone-releasing factor superfamily [5]. According to a classic model of molecular evolution [6], this is because a duplicated peptide sequence may be
able to escape from natural selection and drift neutrally [7] if
its original function is maintained by its paralog. In principle,
the mutations accumulating in the 'escaped' peptide sequence
may then lead to nonfunctionalization, subfunctionalization
or neofunctionalization by acquisition of new features such as
altered half-life, altered receptor binding kinetics, altered tissue expression patterns (for example, neuropeptides of the
NPY family or the POMC prepropeptide [1,8]) or receptor
specificities by peptide-receptor co-evolution [9,10]. If subor neofunctionalized, the new peptide will undergo positive
selection for the new function and so become constrained by
purifying selection. If the increased amount of peptides
resulting from the duplication is beneficial, the duplicated
peptide may also immediately increase Darwinian fitness
prior to an accumulation of sequence mutations ('more-ofthe-same') [10,11].
A special feature of many neuropeptides that cannot be
explained by gene duplication is the occurrence of multiple
members of one peptide family within a single prepropeptide.
For example, vertebrate prepropeptides encoding, melanocortins, hypocretins, RFamides or tachykinins, contain two to
a few members of a single peptide family [12]. In invertebrates, copy numbers can reach even higher numbers. Examples include 37 related peptides from the metamorphosin A
precursor of the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima
[13], 24 different FMRFa-like peptides encoded by the fmrf
gene of the cockroach Periplaneta americana [14], 35 FGLamides from the allatostatin precursor of the prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii [15], up to nine RFamides encoded per
flp genes of Caenorhabditis elegans [16], and 35 enterins
contained in the enterin precursor of Aplysia [17]. These multiple copies are encoded on the same gene, and often even on
the same exon. They most likely have arisen by unequal
recombination between nearly identical nucleotide stretches.
This has the important consequence that, unlike peptides
generated by gene or genome duplication, these copies cannot
move to a new genomic location and acquire promoter-driven
differential spatial or temporal expression patterns since they
are encoded on the same gene, and they cannot be specifically
silenced when located on the same exon. Multiple copies are
thus equal at birth, at least on the genetic level [18]. Unlike for
peptides originating from whole genome duplications, there

is also no co-duplicated receptor as a directly available partner for sub- or neofunctionalization. It is therefore difficult to
fit them directly into the established models of molecular evolution for duplicated peptide genes [1,2,4].
At least two questions arise from this: is the molecular evolution of multiple copy neuropeptides similar to that of duplicated peptides? And more importantly, what is the functional
significance of the individual multiple copies contained in
given prepropeptides - a long-standing problem in invertebrate neuroendocrinology (see, for example, [19-22]). At one
extreme, each peptide copy may have its unique and specific
function, receptor or expression pattern. On the other
extreme, peptide copies may be functionally redundant if they
are co-expressed, co-released and also share an identical
effect space [21]. Among others, studies on the effect of multiple co-expressed peptide copies on the neuromuscular junction of Aplysia and Drosophila provide evidence for such a
redundancy [22,23], but differential activities might be found
when looking at, for example, different developmental times
or target sites. In fact, other studies speak against a functional
redundancy, and report differential target-specific effects of
multiple copy peptides in insects and molluscs (for example,
[19,24-26]).
To comprehensively investigate whether multiple peptide
copies are functionally redundant is extremely difficult by
experimental means, especially since peptide copies can show
different half-lives in the circulation after release (for example, [27]), or differentially activate the same receptor (for
example, [28]). It is also difficult to assess the functional
importance of individual copies by genetic means since common techniques target the whole gene. We here have chosen
an evolutionary and comparative genomic approach to
address the functional significance of multiple peptide copies.
This opportunity has recently become possible with the publication of the genomes of 12 different Drosophila species
[29]. A standard nomenclature that refers to multiple peptides belonging to the same peptide family located on the
same precursor does not exist. Based on [30], we will use the
following terminology (see Figure 1): peptide copies aligning
at the same position within the precursors of different species
will be referred to as orthocopies. Orthocopies do not have to
be sequence identical. The different peptide copies within a
prepropeptide of a single species are paracopies (that is, not
at the same location). The term 'isoform', which has often
been used in conjunction with insect neuropeptides, will be
avoided because of its differing usage in protein
nomenclature.
We mined the Drosophila genome database [31] for genes
encoding homologs of all known D. melanogaster neuropeptide precursor (prepropeptides) encoding neuropeptides up
to a size of 50 amino acids. The investigated species belong to
the Drosophila and Sophophora subgenera that diverged 4060 million years ago [32,33] and contain 97% of the more

Terminology and amino acid distances
Terminology and amino acid distances. (ai) Peptide copy terminology exemplified by three aligned ASTa prepropeptides from species a1-3. (aii)
Processing at dibasic processing sites (indicated in red in (ai)) yields the four neuropeptides ASTa1-4. The C-terminal glycine is further processed to yield
the C-terminal amidation. Peptide copies aligning at the same position in the precursor (for example, ASTa1 of species a1-3) will be referred to as
orthocopies, which do not have to be sequence-identical. The different copies in a precursor of a single species are paracopies (for example, ASTa1-4 of
species a1) = not at the same location. Paracopies may or may not be sequence-identical. (b) Different types of amino acid distances obtained by pairwise
comparisons. (bi) The average distance Do between orthocopies is the arithmetic mean of all individual pairwise distances. It does not contain distances
between different paracopies. (bii) The average distance between all peptides within a family Df is the arithmetic mean of all individual pairwise distances.

than 1,000 Drosophila species [34]. We then predicted orthoand paracopies and analyzed their amino acid sequence variation. This is appropriate since most selection pressure is on
the peptide sequence and not on the underlying DNA
sequence with its often redundant third codon position. Our
reasoning was as follows: if peptides are functionally important and their loss decreases Darwinian fitness, their
sequence will be under stabilizing selection and hence their
sequence will be conserved in the different species. If peptides
have no functional importance and their (functional) loss
does not affect fitness, they will be able to escape selection
pressure and will accumulate sequence variations during
Drosophila radiation. Thus, if peptide copies are functionally
unimportant, we expect a high sequence variation between at
least some orthocopies that were able to escape from selection
pressure since one or several of their fellow paracopies 'do the
job' and hence are under stabilizing selection. This in consequence would lead to an increased sequence variation
between paracopies. If peptide copies have a functional
importance, we expect low sequence variation between all
orthocopies due to stabilizing selection. If the different
paracopies activate different receptors or induce different
receptor conformations that lead to activation of different

intracellular signaling pathways, we expect at the same time
an increased sequence variation between paracopies due to
subfunctionalization. If peptide copies are individually
redundant but functionally important along the 'more-of-thesame' concept, we expect low sequence variation between
both ortho- and paracopies.
Our study assumes that neuropeptides are expressed and
processed as predicted in silico from the genome. This is not
given per se, since neuropeptides can undergo differential
splicing and post-translational processing. To biochemically
underpin our assumption in a manageable amount of time,
direct MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight) mass spectrometric peptide profiling
lends itself as a fast and reliable method. We therefore
directly profiled the major neuropeptide release sites of four
species covering the main Drosophila lineages. In D. melanogaster, these sites contain about 50% of all biochemically
identified neuropeptides and the majority of peptide hormones [35-37].
Our data provide a first genomic prediction of neuropeptides
and prepropeptides, and the first chemical neuropeptide

characterizations for the newly sequenced Drosophila species.
The results suggest that both the peptidome and the peptide
hormone complement are conserved throughout Drosophila,
and that the degree of sequence variation corresponds well
with the pharmacological efficacy of the peptides. This provides molecular evidence for a general functional importance
of multiple paracopies.

Results
Genomics and peptide prediction
We mined the genomes of the 11 newly sequenced Drosophila
species for homologs of the D. melanogaster peptide precursor genes Akh (CG1171), Ast (CG13633), Ast-C (CG149199),
capa (CG15520), Ccap (CG4910), Crz (CG3302), Dh
(CG8348), Dh31 (CG13094),ETH (CG18105), Fmrf
(CG2346), hug (CG6371), IFa (CG33527), Leucokinin
(CG13480), Mip (CG6456), Dms (CG6440), npf (CG10342),
Nplp1 (CG3441), Pdf (CG6496), Proct (CG7105), Dsk
(CG18090), sNPF (CG13968), and Dtk (CG14734). We then
predicted the encoded neuropeptides; an overview of their
numbers is given in Table 1. With the exception of the
FMRFa-like peptides (see below), the analyzed genes code for
the same number of neuropeptides in each species (43 in
total, plus 10-17 FMRFa-like peptides). The translated coding
sequences for the prepropeptides and predicted peptides are
given as Additional data files 1 and 2.

Mass spectrometric characterization
In Drosophila larvae, the main neurohemal organs that store
and release peptide hormones are the ring gland, and the thoracic and abdominal perisympathetic organs. The epitracheal
cells (Inka cells) are endocrine glands along the trachea.
These tissues represent a rich source of neuropeptides: their
peptidome contains about half of all known D. melanogaster
neuropeptides [35,36]. To biochemically assess whether the
neuropeptides are expressed and processed as predicted, we
directly profiled these neurohemal organs in D. sechellia, D.
pseudoobscura, D. mojavensis and D. virilis. These species
cover main phylogenetic lines within Drosophila. Obtained
masses in the range of 850-2,500 Da were matched to the theoretical masses of predicted peptides (Table 2). This - and the
observed tissue distribution - revealed that the peptidome of
the investigated peptide release sites is identical in all species,
at least in the mass range up to 2.5 kDa. In other words, all
fruit flies appear to store the same set of (ortholog) peptides
as D. melanogaster in the respective neurohemal release sites
[35,36].

Direct mass spectrometric profiling of the ring gland
The ring gland contained the adipokinetic hormone (AKH;
pQLTFSPDWa), the AKH processing intermediate pQLTFSPDWGK, myosuppressin (MS), corazonin, corazonin3-11, the
pyrokinins CAPA-PK2-15 and hugin (HUG)-PK, and the CAPA

precursor peptide B (CPPB) (Figure 2 and Additional data file
3). As in D. melanogaster, the mass peak at 974.6 Da indicates the presence of SPSLRLRFa in D. sechellia, D. pseudoobscura, and D. virilis. The origin of SPSLRLRFa in these
species is ambiguous, since it could represent short neuropeptide F (sNPF)-14-11 or its sequence-identical paralog
sNPF-212-19. The finding of mass peaks at 974.6 and 992.6 in
ring gland profiles of D. mojavensis - corresponding to
sNPF4-11 and the aberrant D. mojavensis sNPF-212-19 SPSMRLRFa - indicates that, in fact, both sNPF-14-11 and
sNPF-212-19 occur in the ring gland of Drosophila species. In
D. sechellia, a mass peak corresponding to the full sNPF-1
was found in one preparation.

Direct mass spectrometric profiling of neurohemal release sites in the
ventral ganglion
The neurohemal organs of the ventral ganglion are the thoracic and abdominal perisympathetic organs. In Drosophila
and other flies, these organs persist during the larval stages
but are subsequently reduced during pupal metamorphosis.
In the adult fly, the innervating peptidergic neurites supply a
neurohemal zone directly below the dorsal neural sheath
[38,39]. Since we did not succeed to specifically dissect the
tiny larval perisympathetic organs, we directly profiled adult
dorsal neural sheath preparations that were carefully cleaned
of attached nervous tissue (n = 5-9 for each species). As in D.
melanogaster [35], preparations from thoracic portions of
the dorsal neural sheath contained the FMRFa-like peptides
of the FMRF-prepropeptide (Figure 3ai-di). Preparations
from abdominal portions contained the CAPA peptides
CAPA-PVK-1 and -2, CAPA-PK and CPPB (Figure 3aii-dii).
Occasionally, mass peaks corresponding to CAPA peptides
were found in thoracic preparations, and FMRFa-like peptides in abdominal preparations. This corresponds to the variable extent of overlap of the more posterior CAPA neuron
projections with more anterior FMRFa-like peptide neuron
projections. Concomitantly, mass spectra from intermediate
portions of the dorsal neural sheath consistently showed both
CAPA and FMRFa-like peptide peaks.
In each species, the masses of all predicted FMRFa-like peptides of the FMRF-prepropeptide could be detected (Table 2)
with the exception of FMRFa-1. This peptide invariantly has
the carboxy-terminal sequence FMHFa in the investigated
species, and thereby lacks the easily protonated Arg that
makes FMRFa-1 difficult to detect in peptide mixtures by the
MALDI process [35,40]. In many FMRFa-like peptide-containing spectra, a mass peak around 2 kDa was prominent. In
each species, this mass peak matched the theoretical mass of
the respective extended form of FMRFa-5 (FMRFa-5ext),
which would result from prohormone cleavage of FMRF-4
and FMRF-6 without internal cleavage of the single Arg cleavage site of FMRF-5 (Additional data file 4). An extended form
of FMRFa-5 had not been described from D. melanogaster.
We therefore reviewed our old data from D. melanogaster
larvae [36]. In many spectra, we found a distinct mass peak at

precursor. It is unclear whether FMRF-5ext is released as a
peptide hormone, or only represents a processing
intermediate.
Besides CAPA- and FMRFa-like peptides, mass peaks corresponding to leucokinin and IPNa were occasionally detected
in dorsal neural sheath preparations (Figure 3). Leucokinin
and IPNa are dominant peptides in ventral ganglion preparations [35] and likely represent a contamination of the dorsal
neural sheath by adhering peptidergic neurites.

Direct mass spectrometric profiling of the peritracheal cells
The larval peritracheal cells are located at stereotypic locations near the primary branchings of trachea from the main
trunk [41]. As in D. melanogaster, spectra obtained with the
laser beam directed at these branching sites consistently
showed mass peaks corresponding to ecdysis-triggering hormone (ETH)-1 and -2 in all species (Figure 4). The mass of
ETH-1 was detected in 8 out of 15 preparations in D. virilis, in
9 out of 11 preparations in D. mojavensis, in 12 out of 13 preparations in D. pseudoobscura, and 4 out of 6 preparations in
D. sechellia. Equivalent numbers for ETH-2 were 11/15, 6/11,
7/13 and 6/6.

FMRFa-like peptides in D. mojavensis and D. virilis, 11
FMRFa-like peptides in D. ananassae, 12 FMRFa-like peptides in D. willistoni, 14 FMRFa-like peptides in D. erecta, 17
FMRFa-like peptides in D. grimshawi, and 13 FMRFa-like
peptides in all other species. The fmrf gene contains 2 exons,
of which exon II codes for the whole FMRFa prepropeptide.
The differences in peptide-coding sequences can thus not be
explained by exon duplication. Higher numbers of tandem
repeats exist for FMRFa-2 (DPKQDMRFa; for example, 5
copies in D. melanogaster, 7 copies in D. grimshawi) in all
species but D. mojavensis and D. virilis. This may suggest
that mispairing of template versus replicating nucleotide
sequences coding for this peptide has resulted in insertions/
deletions during Drosophila evolution and has caused the
high number of FMRFa-like peptide copies.
Two prepropeptides contain neuropeptides that are usually
not grouped into the same peptide family: the CAPA prepropeptide contains two periviscerokinins and one pyrokinin,
and the neuropeptide-like precursor (NPLP)1 prepropeptide
contains one MTYamide, one IPNamide and one non-amidated peptide. The CAPA pyrokinin and the NPLP1 peptides
have therefore been treated as single copy peptides (but see
Discussion).

Peptide copy numbers
Alignment of the prepropeptide sequences showed that the
peptide families of each Drosophila species consist of an
identical set and number of ortholog neuropeptide copies,
with the exception of FMRFa-like peptides (Table 1; Additional data files 1 and 2). For example, in all species the crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) precursor contains one
CCAP, and the allatostatin A (ASTa) precursor contains 4
ASTa peptides. The FMRFa precursor, however, encodes 10

Peptide-coding sequences are more conserved than
spacer sequences
If the neuropeptide sequences are subjected to stabilizing
selection due to their signaling function, it is reasonable to
assume that the peptide-coding parts of the prepropeptides
are more conserved than the spacers (the parts separating the
bioactive peptides), which by existing evidence do not act as
signaling molecules in insects. In other words, the sequence

similarity between ortholog neuropeptide parts of the prepropeptides is likely to be higher than the sequence similarity

correlated with their physico-chemical characteristics [42].

Direct peptide profiling of tracheal preparations containing the
peritracheal cells of different Drosophila species. Peaks corresponding to
the [M+H]+ or [M+Na]+ adducts of the two ETHs are visible besides the
typical and possibly non-peptidergic tracheal peaks [22].

For example, neuropeptide F (NPF) and MTYa show the highest Dso for single copy families (0.134 and 0.093, respectively). The respective maximum values for multiple copy
families are 0.748 for FMRFa-7, 0.601 for sulfakinin (SK)-0,
0.267 for ETH-2, 0.208 for FMRFa-7, and 0.205 for CAPAPVK-2. Yet, orthocopy sets without sequence variation or
with low Dso values occur not only in single copy, but also in
each multiple copy peptide family: CAPA-PVK-1 (0.042),
ETH-1 (0.025), SK1- (0), ASTa-3 and -4 (0), sNPF-1 (0),
myoinhibiting peptide (MIP)-3 and -4 (0), Drosophila tachykinin (DTK)-3 (0.02) and FMRFa-2 and -6 (0).

To test for differences in the sequence variability between single and multiple copy peptide families, we computed the average amino acid distance Daf for each amino acid position
between all paracopies within a peptide family (Figure 6a, d)
and then calculated the mean (Figure 6b). For single copy
peptides, we calculated the corresponding average amino acid
distance Dao for the respective orthologs (Figure 6c). The
results in Figure 6 show that the mean Daf between paracopies
of multiple copy peptide families is typically higher than the
Dao observed between the single copy peptides. Due to a large
standard variation, these differences are only significant for
amino acid positions 5 and 7 from the carboxyl terminus
(paired t-test, p < 0.05). This reflects the spread of sequence
variation in multiple copy peptide families. For most amino
acid positions there are families that show no variation, and,
at the same time, families with considerable sequence variation. The high mean Dap at position 1 from the carboxyl terminus mostly originates from the sNPFs, which end either RFa
(sNPF-1 and -2) or RWa (sNPF-3 and -4). There is no clear
tendency that the sequence variation increases from the carboxyl to the amino terminus; a correlation between Daf and
copy number is not discernible (Figure 6d).

Orthologs of single and multiple copy peptide families
are equally sequence-conserved
The distance Daf contains both the sequence variation
between individual orthologs (inter-ortholog variation) as
well as between individual paracopies (inter-paracopy variation; Figure 1). To test the contribution of the inter-ortholog
variation to Daf, we calculated the average amino acid distance Dao for each amino acid position for each set of orthocopies individually (Figure 7). A comparison of Figures 7c and
6b shows that the mean Dao for the ten carboxy-terminal

amino acids is considerably smaller than the mean Daf and not
significantly different between single and multiple copy peptides. This region likely contains the active core of the peptides, which typically consists of the last five to seven carboxyterminal amino acids and the amidation signal (for example,
[44-47]). Somewhat higher Dao values occurred for more
amino-terminal amino acids. This shows that the orthologs
are strongly sequence-conserved throughout Drosophila,
irrespective of whether they belong to a single or multiple
copy peptide family - with the exception of FMRFa-7 and SK0 (see below).

in sequence variation between multiple copy peptide families:
given positions were variable in some peptide families, but
imvariantly occupied by the same amino acid in others. The
high Danp of 1.69 at position 1 from the carboxyl terminus is
again caused by the carboxy-terminal difference RFa and
RWa between the sNPFs. When omitting the RWamides
sNPF-3 and -4 - which could not be biochemically detected
yet - this value drops to 0.42. With this value, it seems that the
amino acids at positions 1-3 and 8 from the carboxyl terminus
are the most conserved amino acids between the paracopies
of each multiple copy peptide family.

Sequence variation mostly originates from sequence
variation between paracopies

Sequence variation is not related to receptor number

We next calculated the average net amino acid distances (Figure 1) between paracopies Danp for multiple copy peptide families; results are shown in Figure 8. The mean Danp was higher
than the mean Dao of single (Figure 8b) or multiple copy
(compare Figure 7c) peptides throughout amino acid position
1-11. This was again only significant for positions 5 and 7 due
to the high standard variations (paired t-test, p < 0.05). As for
Daf, the high variation of Danp reflects the spread of the degree

uncharacterized to date [48]. From the obtainable literature
[48-51], we compiled the number of characterized D. melanogaster G protein-coupled receptors per peptide family.
Although these numbers may be subjected to future changes,
to date there are either only one or two receptors known for
the paracopies of each peptide family. The occurrence of two
receptors for some peptide family opens the possibility for

receptor-ligand coevolution and subsequent sub- and neofunctionalization of paracopies. To test for this, we plotted the

Danp between multiple copy peptide families with one known
receptor against those with two known receptors. Although
there are differences (Figure 9), they are neither statistically
significant nor do they follow an obvious pattern. This result
speaks against a sub- or neofunctionalization of paracopies
during the evolution of Drosophila.

Discussion

We datamined the 11 new Drosophila genomes for homologs
of the 22 described prepropeptide genes of D. melanogaster
encoding neuropeptides up to a length of 50 amino acids
[52,53]. From these data, we were able to predict 53-60
neuropeptides for each species. These peptides are known or
are likely to signal via G protein-coupled receptors [48].

Larger protein hormones (>50 amino acids) have not been
included, because they are expected to have a smaller
proportion of residues that are important for their pharmacological efficacy (see, for example, [54]), which makes it difficult to directly compare their sequence variability to that of
the smaller neuropeptides.

Accuracy of peptide predictions
The obtained mass fingerprints of the neurohemal organs and
endocrine cells were identical: in each species, the obtained
masses corresponded to the respective orthologs in D. melanogaster neurohemal organs or peritracheal cells [35,36].
Vice versa, for each peptide characterized in the neurohemal
organs or peritracheal cells of D. melanogaster, there was a
mass present that corresponded to the respective ortholog in
the other species. Similar to the use of peptide fingerprints in
proteomics, the exactly matching tissue fingerprints chemically identify the underlying peptides and precursor products
with high probability. All fingerprint masses matched the
respective theoretical masses calculated for the in silico predicted peptides. In conclusion, the mass spectrometric profiling supports our in silico prediction of the neuropeptidome.

The peptidome is evolutionarily conserved throughout
the genus Drosophila
The finding of identical peptide hormone complements in the
mass range of 800-2,500 Da in main Drosophila phylogenetic lineages suggests that the peptidome of the major neurohemal organs and the peritracheal cells has been
evolutionary stable for at least 40-60 million years since the
divergence of the Drosophila species from their last common
ancestor. Obviously, all Drosophila species share the same
peptidergic hormonal communication possibilities. Even
more, our genomic comparisons suggest that the whole pep-

Wegener and Gorbashov R131.13

tidome is highly conserved throughout the genus Drosophila.
We observed no loss of peptide precursors, or individual peptides as suggested to have occurred, for example, between
flies and mosquitoes [55]. Thus, the number of peptide copies
in each precursor was identical throughout the species with
exception for the FMRFamides, which most likely duplicated
by unequal recombination. These recombination events must
have occurred independently from each other, since multiple
repeats of FMRFa-2 coding sequences are present both in the
Sophophora subgroup and the Hawaiian species of the Drosophila subgroup (D. grimshawi), but are lacking in the other
Drosophila subgroup species D. virilis and D. mojavensis.
Unequal recombination is also the likely mechanism behind
the duplication of most other multiple copy peptides, but for
them recombination must have occurred prior to Drosophila
speciation.
The high conservancy of the peptidome is remarkable and
unexpected, since drosophilid flies have undergone several
radiations and have adapted to a variety of environments
with, for example, a very different supply of water, such as sea
shores, forests and deserts [34,56]. In contrast, the genome of
the tenebrionid beetle Tribolium castaneum shows a gene
expansion for putative diuretic peptides [57]. This has been
interpreted as an adaptation to dry conditions in tenebrionids, a beetle family that thrives in deserts and other very dry
places. It is, however, unclear whether this is a special tenebrionid or a common beetle feature. At least for fruit flies, our
data show that the adaptation to different environments is
not paralleled by changes in the number or increased
sequence variability of diuretic hormones or other
neuropeptides.

Neuropeptide sequences are subjected to stabilizing
selection
In our analysis, spacer sequences showed significantly higher
amino acid distances than peptide sequences. This suggests
that Drosophila neuropeptides are subjected to stabilizing
selection or evolutionary constraint to a much larger extent
than spacer sequences. This is further supported by the nonrandom distribution of peptide distances not observed for
spacers. This finding may not be unexpected, but is shown
here for the first time on a neuropeptidome level.
In Drosophila, there is a higher proportion of highly constrained codons in essential genes than in any other dispensability class [58]. As hypothesized at the outset, stabilizing
selection and the resulting sequence conservation may thus
indicate functional importance of neuropeptides, signaling
molecules for which single amino acid exchanges can result in
drastically altered receptor efficacy, binding or effect (for
example, [28,59]). If this hypothesis is correct, then the
observed low inter-orthocopy distances (Dao, Dso) indicate
that the multiple peptide copies are functionally important
and not individually dispensable.

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R131

Genome Biology 2008,

The observed higher amino acid distances that reflect a considerable sequence variation for the spacers do not allow us to
conclude that structural features of the spacers are unimportant for proper peptide processing and packaging into secretory vesicles. They speak, however, against a general signaling
function of the spacer regions ('associated peptides') at the
receptor binding site, where single amino acid changes can
already result in altered efficacy, effect or specificity (for
example, [28,59]). Nevertheless, this conclusion needs
proper physiological testing. Several spacer regions are quite
conserved throughout the Drosophila species (for example,
in the CAPA and CCAP precursor), and a FMRFa-spacerderived peptide has been shown to modulate the activity of
FMRFa at the receptor in Lymnea [60].

Peptide copies are unlikely to have undergone a phase
of neutral mutation
The comparably high Danp distances show that there is
sequence-variation between paracopies (inter-paracopy variation). Assuming that paracopies at some point have arisen
from a common ancestor, we have hypothesized at the outset
that newly duplicated paracopies can escape selection pressure and may be allowed to drift neutrally. However, the
small Dao distances between orthocopies (inter-orthocopy
variation) do not support this scenario. A significant difference in sequence variation between the individual sets of
orthocopies was not observed between single and multiple
copy peptide families, and inter-orthocopy distances were
small compared to the distances found between spacer
regions. This suggests that: the inter-paracopy variation originates from a time before divergence of the Drosophila taxa;
and paracopies have never fully escaped selection pressure
and have never experienced a phase of neutral mutation.
Hence, the classic theory for duplicated genes may only apply
in a limited sense for paracopies.
At the outset, we reasoned that peptide copies following the
'more-of-the-same' concept will show low sequence variation
between paracopies. For paracopies with differential activities, we expected at the same time an increased sequence variation between paracopies. Since the inter-paracopy distances
Danp were similar for all multiple copy peptide families and
did not correlate with receptor number, it is not possible to
draw conclusions from our data in this respect. For Drosophila, there are also no data regarding different half-lives
during peptide degradation, or induction of ligand-selective
receptor conformation and activity [61] as has been demonstrated for locust and cockroach AKHs [27,28].
The CAPA and NPLP1 prepropeptides contain neuropeptides
that are usually not grouped into the same peptide family. We
have therefore treated the CAPA pyrokinin and the NPLP1
peptides as single copy peptides. However, some sequence
similarities can be found between CAPA pyrokinins and
periviscerokinins, and between the amino-terminal stretches
of the NPLP1 peptides [62]. It has also been shown that the

Volume 9, Issue 8, Article R131

Wegener and Gorbashov R131.14

CAPA pyrokinin specifically activates a G protein-coupled
receptor (CG9918) that is evolutionarily related to the other
Drosophila pyrokinin receptors, but is not activated by CAPA
periviscerokinins and the HUG-pyrokinin at physiological
concentrations [63]; data on NPLP1 peptide receptors are not
yet available. Thus, it is possible that at least the CAPA peptides are, in fact, an example of multiple copies that have subor neofunctionalized by acquiring sequence variation: the
CAPA prepropeptide appears to date back at least to the origin of insects, since it contains a few periviscerokinins plus
one highly sequence-conserved pyrokinin in all insect taxa
investigated so far [64]. If this is the case, this sub- or neofunctionalization must have occurred a long time before the
radiation of Drosophila. While this justifies the classification
of at least the CAPA pyrokinin as a single copy peptide in this
study, it emphasizes the need for further comparisons similar
to that reported here for Drosophila on larger phylogenetic
units spanning longer evolutionary time frames. Such studies
will soon become possible with the increasing number of fully
sequenced insect genomes.

The calculated distances correlate with
pharmacological efficacy
Although the inter-orthocopy distance Dso was, in general,
very low throughout the peptides, we observed differences in
Dso within the CAPA-PVK, ETH, FMRFamide and tachykinin
peptide families. Can these differences be correlated to differential activities? A comparison of the calculated Dso values
with the available pharmacological data shows that there is at
least a correlation to the reported efficacies: the paracopies
with lower amino acid distance typically are the ones with
higher receptor or pharmacological activity.
For the ETHs, the EC50 of the paracopy with the lowest
sequence variation (ETH-1) is nine times more potent in heterologous receptor assays than the more sequence-variable
ETH-2 [65,66]. Two groups have characterized the FMRFa
receptor of D. melanogaster in heterologous expression systems. Both found that FMRFa-6 (PDNFMRFa) has the highest potency to activate the FMRFa receptor, whereas FMRFa7 has no activity at all [67,68]. Meeusen and colleagues [68]
report similar EC50 values for FMRFa-2 to -5. All were only
slightly less potent than FMRFa-6. Cazzamali and Grimmelikhuijzen [67] found the following order: FMRFa-6 >
FMRFa-2 > FMRFa-3,-5,-8 > FMRFa-1 > FMRFa-4. This
pharmacological ranking correlates well with the calculated
Dso distances (in brackets): FMRFa-6 = FMRFa-2 (0) <
FMRFa-5 (0.04) < FMRFa-8 (0.064) < FMRFa-4 (0.11) <
FMRFa-1 (0.127) < FMRFa-3 (0.172) << FMRFa-7 (0.748).
For the DTKs, our data predict the following ranking of pharmacological activity: DTK-3 > DTK-1 > DTK-6 > DTK4 =
DTK-5 > DTK-2. This again corresponds quite well with the
efficacy of DTKs on DTKR - one of the two DTK receptors
known - in HEK-293 cells [69]: DTK-1 > DTK-3 = DTK-6 >
DTK-4 > DTK-5 > DTK-2. For CAPA-PVKs, the copy with the

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R131

Genome Biology 2008,

lower sequence variation (CAPA-PVK-1) is more effective in
inducing calcium responses and fluid transport in the Malpighian tubules [70] and about 1.5-times more potent in
receptor assays than the more sequence variable CAPA-PVK2 [65,71]. In other words, the more potent peptides were typically the more sequence-conserved. This might extend well
beyond Drosophila. For example, CAPA-PVK-2 orthologs are
much more sequence-variable in their carboxyl terminus
than CAPA-PVK-1 orthologs not only in Drosophila, but also
in other flies [72,73]. At the same time, the housefly Musca
domestica CAPA-PVK-2 shows a ten-times diminished efficacy in fluid secretion assays on housefly Malpighian tubules
compared to M. domestica CAPA-PVK-1 [45]. The degree of
sequence variation appears not to be linked with peptide position along the precursor.
In contrast to the CAPA-PVKs, ETHs, FMRFamides and
DTKs, the SK-1 and -2, MIP and ASTa copies all showed a
consistently low inter-orthocopy distance. The pharmacological profiles of SK and MIP copies on their respective receptors have not been characterized so far, but such data exist for
the two Drosophila ASTa receptors (DARs) expressed in
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells [74,75]. The data suggest
that DAR-1 has a lower sensitivity for ASTa-4 than for ASTa1 to -3, whereas DAR-2 is more sensitive to ASTa-3 to -4. It
has, however, to be kept in mind that not all peptide receptors
have been deorphanized to date, and that signaling properties
and specificities of receptors may be changed by modifying
proteins such as RAMP or RGS in native cells. It is also possible that ligand-selective receptor conformations may exist
[61], and the ligand properties and activated intracellular
pathways in vivo may be different to those in heterologous
expression systems. This may explain why - in contrast to the
data from heterologous expression systems - all FMRFamides
had a similar dose-response effect at the neuromuscular junction [22]. Only FMRFa-7 (SAPQDFVRSa) was inactive in all
systems. Clearly, further data, especially from bioassays, will
be needed to confirm the observed correlations between
sequence variation and efficacy.
The evolution of neuropeptides and their receptors is linked,
and neuropeptide receptors are under evolutionary pressure
to maintain a high affinity to the authentic ligands [9,59]. The
finding that the more sequence-variable neuropeptides
typically had a lower pharmacological efficacy does not speak
for the occurrence of fast adaptive structural changes of G
protein-coupled receptors to maintain a high ligand affinity
to sequence-variable peptides during the evolution of Drosophila. Does that mean that peptide copies with high amino
acid distances are functionally unimportant? The by far highest distances were found for FMRFa-7 (0.748) and SK-0
(0.601). The carboxyl terminus of FMRFa-7 (FVRSa) is highly
deviated and is the likely cause for its lack of receptor activation and bioactivity [22,67] (and see above). The high Dso
value of FMRFa-7 is around the mean value found for spacer
regions, which suggests that FMRFa-7 has escaped selection

Volume 9, Issue 8, Article R131

Wegener and Gorbashov R131.15

pressure to a considerable amount. The high Dso value for SK0 correlates with its inactivity at the DSK-R1 receptor [76]
and its lack of bioactivity at physiological concentrations
below 1 Î¼M [77]. Unlike SK-1 and -2, SK-0 has, furthermore,
not been found biochemically so far [35,37]. Hugin-gamma, a
predicted but obviously not processed peptide [78] that
seems to be missing from the genome of D. persimilis [55],
shows a Dso of 0.259. Nevertheless, the synthetic D. melanogaster HUG-gamma is still able to activate the receptor
[65,79]. We propose from this as a rough estimate that the
peptides with an amino acid distance above 0.6 are nonfunctionalized. Distances below 0.3 and the non-Gaussian distribution of all other peptide copies suggest that they are under
stabilizing selection that prevents nonfunctionalization by
random or deleterious mutations.

Conclusion

Taken together, our data provide evidence that the peptidome
and the neuropeptide hormone complement has been conserved during the evolution of Drosophila, and shows that
multiple peptide copies with biological activity are under stabilizing selection. Sequence conservation largely correlates
with pharmacological activity. While all this suggest that multiple peptide copies are functionally important, it remains
unclear why paracopies are under stabilizing selection.
It has to be stressed that our data are based on only a relatively small number of data points. This was unavoidable by
the simple fact that further multiple copy neuropeptide families in Drosophila have not been identified. Consequently,
our conclusions will need further validation and we hope that
our work will provoke further studies on new data from the
rapidly increasing number of genome projects. Our study
emphasizes the value of these genome projects, and stresses
the need for more comprehensive structure-activity studies
and pharmacological characterization of peptides both in
receptor and bioassays.

Materials and methods
Flies
D. virilis was obtained from a colony in Ulm. Genome library
strains of D. mojavensis,D. pseudoobscura, and D. sechellia
were obtained from the Tucson Drosophila Stock Center.
Flies were kept at standard conditions - a light:day cycle of 12
h:12 h and either 18Â°C or 25Â°C. D. virilis and D. sechellia were
raised on standard cornmeal medium, D. mojavensis and D.
pseudoobscura on standard banana-Opuntia medium.

Database searches
Peptide precursor genes were identified by tblastn homology
searches against the respective D. melanogaster coding
sequences using the PAM30 matrix of the Drosophila species
BLAST site [80]. The coding sequences were identified and
translated with GENSCAN [81] and compared with the

GLEAN-predicted sequences in the databank. Amino acid
sequences were aligned with the ClustalW algorithm implemented in MEGA3.1 [82] and plotted using GeneDoc [83].
Signal peptides were predicted by SignalP 3.0 [84]. Monoisotopic masses of the predicted bioactive neuropeptides were
calculated with Data Explorer 4.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany).

Peptide prediction
We predicted the processed bioactive peptides based on
cleavage site consensus sequences [85] and comparison with
the chemically characterized processing products from D.
melanogaster [35-37]. Mono-isotopic masses were calculated
for all peptides and listed for each species. Peptide designations were inferred from prepropeptide alignment with the
ortholog D. melanogaster sequence, for example, the myoinhibiting peptide encoded on the Mip orthologs that aligned
with D. melanogaster MIP-3 was also named MIP-3. This
allows easy identification and reference to ortholog peptides.
In the fmrf-precursor of D. melanogaster, several paracopies
are sequence-identical and named either FMRFa-2 or -3.
These paracopies and their orthologs were designated according to their position on the gene as FMRFa-2', FMRFa-2", and
so on.

Calculations of sequence variation/amino acid
distances
The parts of the prepropeptides between the signal peptide
and the bioactive peptide sequences flanked by the mono- or
dibasic cleavage sites were assigned as spacers. For distance
calculations of peptides, sequences were aligned from their
carboxyl terminus. Gaps that occurred due to variable peptide
copy length were deleted pairwise. Spacers were aligned by
the ClustalW algorithm prior to distance calculation. Average
distances were calculated as absolute values in MEGA3.1 for
pairwise comparisons as outlined in Figure 1 by iterative procedures under a maximum likelihood formulation using the
JTT matrix [43,82]. The JTT matrix was calculated from data
of the Swiss-Prot protein sequence database and gives a
measure of the probability that a given amino acid i is being
replaced by residue j per occurrence of j [43]. Variable mutation rates among sites were assumed. Since the peptide
sequences are too short to reliably estimate gamma parameters, we adopted a gamma distance with Î± = 2.4, which is very
close to the true distance for sequence divergence under the
JTT model [86]. Data were processed and plotted using
Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).

Sample preparation
The central nervous system was dissected free from all surrounding tissue in standard Drosophila saline. Ring glands of
L3 larvae (selected after size: D. virilis >3 mm; D. mojavensis, D. sechellia >2 mm; D. pseudoobscura >2.5 mm) were
punched out using pulled glass capillaries and spotted
directly onto the MALDI target and left to dry. For isolation of

the thoracic and abdominal neurohemal sites, the thoracic or
abdominal part of the ventral ganglion of adults was cut out
and the lateral parts were removed using fine scissors. The
dorsal neural sheath was then isolated and freed from cells
using tungsten micro-needles. The isolated sheaths were
transferred to the MALDI target using pulled glass capillaries
and left to dry. This method results in clean spectra from the
neurohemal endings [35,36]. For direct profiling of the peritracheal cells, the main branches of the trachea from L3 larvae were dissected free from other tissue and transferred
directly onto the MALDI target using fine insect needles. The
peritracheal cells were targeted by directing the laser beam to
the obtuse angle between the main trachea and the diverging
first order trachea.
To remove salts, a small droplet of ice-cold water was added
onto the dried tissues, and aspirated off after about 1 s. Small
nanoliter volumes of matrix (saturated solution of re-crystallized Î±-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 30% MeOH/30%
EtOH/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for neurohemal organs, or
60% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for peritracheal
cells were added to the samples using a manual oocyte injector (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA, USA). In prior tests
MeOH/EtOH/H2O (30:30:40) resulted in improved mass
spectra compared to 60% MeOH as previously described for
D. melanogaster [35,36].

MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry
MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired in positive ion mode
on a Voyager DE RP mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems,
Darmstadt, Germany) equipped with a pulsed nitrogen laser
emitting at 337 nm. Samples were analyzed in reflectron
mode using a delayed extraction time of 400 nsec and an
accelerating voltage of 20 kV. To suppress matrix signals, the
low mass gate was set to 850 Da. Laser power was adjusted to
provide optimal signal-to-noise ratios. Data were analyzed
using Data Explorer 4.0 software (Applied Biosystems), with
a mass tolerance of 0.5 Da.
