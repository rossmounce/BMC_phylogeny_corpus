Abstract
Background: Intra-specific and intra-individual polymorphism is frequently observed in nuclear
markers of Ilex (Aquifoliaceae) and discrepancy between plastid and nuclear phylogenies is the rule
in this genus. These observations suggest that inter-specific plastid or/and nuclear introgression
played an important role in the process of evolution of Ilex. With the aim of a precise understanding
of the evolution of this genus, two distantly related sympatric species collected in Tenerife (Canary
Islands), I. perado and I. canariensis, were studied in detail. Introgression between these two species
was previously never reported. One plastid marker (the atpB-rbcL spacer) and two nuclear markers,
the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and the nuclear encoded plastid glutamine
synthetase (nepGS) were analyzed for 13 and 27 individuals of I. perado and I. canariensis,
respectively.
Results: The plastid marker is intra-specifically constant and correlated with species identity. On
the other hand, whereas the nuclear markers are conserved in I. perado, they are highly
polymorphic in I. canariensis. The presence of pseudogenes and recombination in ITS sequences of
I. canariensis explain this polymorphism. Ancestral sequence polymorphism with incomplete lineage
sorting, or past or recent hybridization with an unknown species could explain this polymorphism,
not resolved by concerted evolution. However, as already reported for many other plants, past or
recent introgression of an alien genotype seem the most probable explanation for such a
tremendous polymorphism.
Conclusions: Data do not allow the determination with certitude of the putative species
introgressing I. canariensis, but I. perado is suspected. The introgression would be unilateral, with I.
perado as the male donor, and the paternal sequences would be rapidly converted in highly
divergent and consequently unidentifiable pseudogenes. At least, this study allows the
establishment of precautionary measures when nuclear markers are used in phylogenetic studies
of genera having experienced introgression such as the genus Ilex.

Background
Aquifoliaceae comprise one genus, Ilex [1] and approximately 400 species. The fossil record indicates that the
genus was cosmopolitan during the Eocene. It is now

largely extinct in Australia, Europe and Africa where only
few species persist. Most diversity is currently found in
South-America and in Southeast-Asia. They are evergreen

or deciduous trees or bushes living in warm-moist-temperate, sub-tropical, tropical or montane-tropical areas.
The molecular phylogeny of the genus Ilex [2,3] shows
that systematic relationships are still not well understood.
The plastid phylogeny (inferred from the atpB-rbcL spacer,
rbcL and trnL-F) is highly correlated with the geographic
distribution of extant species. Four chloroplast clades are
found: one exclusively Eurasian clade, one exclusively
American clade and two different North-American/Asian
clades (one of them comprising most of the deciduous
species among other evergreen species). On the other
hand, the nuclear phylogeny (inferred from ribosomal ITS
and the 5S RNA spacer) is incongruent with the plastid
phylogeny, suggesting frequent interlineage hybridizations. The nuclear phylogeny is not correlated with the
geographic distribution of extant species.
Any of the plastid or the nuclear phylogeny corroborates
previous morphological or biosystematic studies [3].
Using chloroplast RFLPs, trnL-trnF sequencing and
nuclear ITS sequencing, a study of Asian Ilex of the Bonin
Island and of the Ryukyu Island [4] confirmed that
hybridization played a role in this region, leading to interspecific introgressions independently observed on both
Islands. RAPD data indicate that the Japanese species Ilex
leucoclada M. is highly polymorphic [5]. During its history, the genus Ilex probably experienced frequent incomplete lineage sorting and nuclear and/or cytoplasmic
introgression, making the study of its history very
complex.
Few data are reported on the chromosome number of Ilex
[6]. The basic haploid number is 20, with deviation to 17,
18 and 19. From the 27 chromosome numbers available
for the genus Ilex, three species are tetraploid (I. anomala,
I. verticillata and I. argentina) and one species is hexaploid
(I. pedunculosa), indicating probable hybridizations
between species having divergent genomic background
(alloploidy).
A previous study [3] showed that individuals of many species of Ilex contain polymorphic nuclear sequences (ITS
and 5S rDNA spacer). Except for I. purpurea and I. guianensis, only one individual was studied per species. The sampling being too low for a correct evaluation of this
intraspecific polymorphism, an exhaustive study of one
plastid marker (the atpB-rbcL spacer) and two nuclear
markers (the ribosomal internal transcribed spacers, ITS,
and the nuclear encoded plastid glutamine synthetase,
nepGS) was undertaken on several individuals of I. perado
and I. canariensis collected in Tenerife (Canary Islands).
These species were chosen because, based on DNA data,
they are not closely related [2,3] and are growing sympatrically in Canary Islands. Both species are morphologi-

cally variable but few characters allow species
identification. I. canariensis is endemic of Canary Islands,
whereas I. perado has a wider distribution in Spain, Portugal, North-Africa and Canary Islands. Natural or artificial
hybridization between both species was never reported.
The data show that, contrarily to I. perado, I. canariensis has
highly polymorphic ITS and nepGS sequences. The aim of
this study was to (1) explain the polymorphism observed
in ITS of I. canariensis by an investigation of its pattern of
substitution and its functionality, (2) determine the evolutionary mechanisms responsible of this polymorphism
and (3) focus on ITS evolution and consequences for phylogenetic reconstruction of the genus Ilex.

Results
ITS polymorphism
Figure 1 (inset) shows the unique plastid atpB-rbcL spacer
phylogram obtained from the alignment of the sequences
of I. perado and I. canariensis collected in Tenerife. All individuals of I. perado have the same atpB-rbcL spacer
sequence. For I. canariensis, 26 individuals have the same
atpB-rbcL spacer sequence and three substitutions are
observed (in a T-rich variable region) for specimen 39.
This plastid marker perfectly agrees with species
determination.

As the ITS sequences found in I. canariensis are extremely
polymorphic, it was interesting to observe their relationships with available ITS sequences previously investigated
species by Manen et al. [3]. Figure 1 shows one of the most
parsimonious ITS tree of I. perado and I. canariensis
sequences found in Tenerife altogether with 43 ITS
sequences of other Ilex species. Thick bars indicate internal branches conserved in the consensus tree. The closest
possible outgroups for the genus Ilex, are Helwingia and
Phyllonoma. However these genera are so isolated systematically that their use to root Ilex should be taken with
care. On 13 individuals of I. perado, only one substitution
(a transition) is observed in ITS. On the other hand, ITS
sequences of most individuals of I. canariensis are polymorphic and few sequences are identical. The divergence
between all ITS sequences observed in I. canariensis is
much higher than between available ITS sequences of all
other species investigated. The GC content is 57% for I.
perado and from 45 to 62% for I. canariensis. Regarding
their GC content, three groups of ITS are found in I. canariensis: a clade with 45% GC, a clade with 61% GC in average and several clades with 53–54% GC in average. The
GC content of other investigated species range from 55 to
61% (Figure 1).
The ITS sequences of I. canariensis are distributed in two
groups in the phylogram represented in Figure 1. One
group forms a large clade conserved in the consensus tree
but not sustained by bootstrap statistics. Another group

Example2of agarose gel electrophoresis of ITS PCR products of individuals of I canariensis
Example of agarose gel electrophoresis of ITS PCR products of individuals of I. canariensis. The line numbers represent individuals of I. canariensis. The star indicates the position of the expected functional ITS band and the dot indicates the position of the
GC 45% ITS pseudogene band.

The sequences of the GC 45% clade have a 110 bp deletion in ITS 1 and are suggested to represent pseudogenes.
In many ITS PCR products of individuals of I. canariensis,
a shorter PCR band is visible on ethidium bromide agarose gel electrophoresis altogether with the main ITS band
(Figure 2). In specimen 28, this electrophoretic band has
been cut out and directly sequenced (sample "can 28B").
It has a sequence very close to both the cloned sequences
of the GC 45% clade found in specimens 35 and 41. Thus
these putative pseudogenes seem rather common in I.
canariensis. During selection of the clones to be
sequenced, the longest PCR fragments were favored with
the aim to select functional sequences. Thus, as the shorter
pseudogene band seems frequent in I. canariensis, Figure 1
underscores this class of ITS sequences represented by the
clade GC 45%.
Secondary structure of ITS 2
The secondary structure of both ITS regions is involved in
the processing of the rRNA precursor and is thus constrained for this function. In angiosperms, an ITS 2 secondary structure has been proposed and comprises 6
conserved regions (C1 to C6) which are involved in com-

mon pairing relationships on the structure [7]. In order to
determine which ITS sequences found in I. canariensis are
functional, the secondary structure of ITS 2 was investigated from selected sequences representing a good sampling of ITS (sequences marked with a dot in Figure 1: per
1_0_57, can 28_B_45, can 36_1_53, can 44_4_54, can
90_2_62 and can 39 3 53). Figure 3 shows functional secondary structures found using Mfold [8]. Only the
sequence of per 1_0_57, can 90_2_62 and can 39_3_53
provide an apparently functional ITS 2 secondary structure showing the common pairing relationships of conserved C1 to C6 regions according to Hershkovitz and
Zimmer [7]. No such ITS 2 secondary structure was found
for sequences can 28B_45, can 36_1_53 and can 44_4_54,
suggesting pseudogenes.
Pattern of substitution
The GC content, indicated for all ITS sequences of Figure
1, suggests that the pattern of substitutions is biased
towards A or T for sequences of the GC 45% clade and for
sequences of the GC 53–54% clades, as expected for pseudogenes. A reconstructed ancestral sequence of Ilex was
calculated by maximum likelihood from the ITS data of

Manen et al. [3] and used to investigate the pattern of substitution on selected ITS sequences. Table 1 shows that a
higher rate of substitution is observed for ITS sequences
found in the GC 45% and GC 53–54% clades than for the
I. perado sequences and for the I. canariensis sequences
found in the GC 62% clade. This increased rate is statistically significant according to the Kruskal-Wallis rank test
[9].
As expected for pseudogenes [10,11], the observed rate of
deamination-like substitutions at methylated cytosine
sites (CpG and CpNpG sites) is higher than the expected
rate of C -> T and G -> A substitutions at non-methylated
sites for can 28B_45, can 39_3_53, can 44_4_54 and can
36_1_62 (Table 1). A chi-square homogeneity test [9]
indicates that this is highly significant for can 28B_45 and
can 36_1_53, which certainly represent pseudogenes.
Substitutions at conserved sites of the 5.8S rDNA
The alignment of fifty 5.8S sequences (modified from
Muir et al. [11]) shows that 59 sites are conserved in vertebrates, invertebrates, fungi and plants and are expected
to be functionally constrained. Substitutions observed at
these sites would suggest non-functional pseudogenes.
Contrarily to I. perado, many ITS sequences found in I.
canariensis have substitutions at some of these conserved
sites. Only the GC 61% clade of I. canariensis comprises
non-substituted conserved 5.8S sites (sequences indicated
in bold in Figure 1). Sequences of the GC 45% clade have
10–11 substitutions. Sequences of the GC 53–54% clades
have 2 to 7 substitutions. Three sequences of the GC 61%
clade have only one mutation, which may be PCR artifacts
[11] and two sequences (can_20_1_58 and can_27_2_59)
with a lower GC content (58 and 59%, respectively) have
2 mutations. Thus ITS sequences of I. canariensis having a
GC content higher than 60% are expected to be functional

genes, all other sequences with lower GC content are suspected to be pseudogenes.
Recombinations
Most ITS sequences of I. canariensis experienced frequent
recombinations: in the entire ITS matrix of I perado and I.
canariensis, the DnaSP program [12] detects 19 minimum
possible recombination events (RM). From 0 to 8 minimum possible recombination events are calculated in the
different ITS clusters (Figure 4A). No recombination was
detected in I. perado and in clade 2 of I. canariensis. Clades
5 and 6 are highly recombined. An example of recombined ITS sequences of I. canariensis from clade 5 is shown
in Figure 4B, where only informative sites are shown.

In order to exclude the possibility that the observed pattern of substitution is the result of homoplasy and to confirm that these sequences are actually recombined,
maximum likelihood tests were carried out. Using PIST
[13], the maximum-likelihood score of the sequences represented in Figure 4 is compared with the scores of 1000
simulated clonal sequences along the calculated maximum-likelihood tree and under the specified model of
evolution (see methods). The observed score q (0.554)
was greater than for all 1000 clonal replicates (mean value
0.381, higher value 0.505), indicating a history of recombination (significance 0.001).
The LARD maximum-likelihood method [14] was applied
to find the breakpoints in the alignment, which gave the
highest likelihood under an evolutionary model incorporating recombination. Only 3 sequences can be analyzed
with this program. Three ITS sequences shown in Figure 4
were submitted to LARD: can 90_6_54, can 25_2_54 and
can 90_4_53. Two recombination points were located by
the program (at the left of positions 242 and at the left of

between positions 392 and 455 for these particular 3
sequences.
Nuclear encoded plastid glutamine synthetase (nepGS)
data
There is no polymorphism in nepGS of I. perado. On the
other hand, I. canariensis shows polymorphism for this
gene. Thirty sites differentiate I. perado from I. canariensis,
of which eight are polymorphic in I. canariensis, either heterozygous or homozygous (Figure 5). For all of these eight
polymorphic sites, always one of the alleles is shared with
I. perado.

pseudogenes unambiguously [17] and different criteria
were chosen: GC content, secondary structure of ITS 2,
rate of substitution, pattern of substitution at methylated
cytosine sites and substitutions at highly conserved sites
of the 5.8S rDNA. ITS sequences with a GC content of
45% are unambiguously pseudogenes and satisfy to all
other criteria. Moreover they have a large deletion in the
ITS 1 region, which make these sequences certainly nonfunctional. The deletion allows an easy detection of this
pseudogene on agarose gels and it is observed in many
individuals of I. canariensis (Figure 2).

The high polymorphism of ITS sequences observed in I.
canariensis is frequently reported for other plant groups
[15,16]. It might have several origins: an incomplete lineage sorting from ancestral polymorphism or an horizontal
transfer (introgression) through inter-specific hybridization (alloploidy), both of them not resolved by concerted
evolution. Before the discussion on the origin of this polymorphism, the characterization and the fate of these different ITS sequences will be first examined.

Other classes of ITS sequences with a GC content of 53–
54% are also suspected to be pseudogenes by one or the
other criteria but not by all of them, as expected regarding
their relatively high GC content. For instance, some ITS 2
sequences of the GC 53–54% class still have a typical
angiosperm
secondary
structure
(for
instance
can_39_3_53, Figure 3), but have (1) an increased rate of
nucleotide substitution, (2) deamination-like substitutions or (3) mutations at normally highly conserved 5.8S
rDNA sites. Only the GC 61 % clade contains functional
ITS sequences. Thus, it can be considered that the functional ITS GC content is 57 % for I. perado and above 60
%. for I. canariensis.

The genome of Ilex canariensis contains ITS pseudogenes
High polymorphism of ITS has been explained by the
presence of divergent pseudogenes in Gossypium, Nicotiana, Tripsacum, Exospermum, Zygogonum, Zea [10], Quercus [11], Leucaena [17], Adinauclea, Haldina, Mitragyna
[18] and others. Thus, this could also be the case for I.
canariensis. Individual criteria are not sufficient to identify

It is interesting to note that most I. canariensis individuals
of the GC 61 % clade never have ITS pseudogenes in the
GC 45 % or GC 53–54 % clades. This is probably because
these individuals do not contain pseudogenes. For other
individuals, a PCR selection for pseudogenes occurred, as
reported for Nicotiana [10], in which ITS sequences with a
weak secondary structure (pseudogenes) are preferentially

(DMSO) in PCR reactions [10,19], but see [18], would

allow amplification of functional ITS sequences in these
individuals of I. canariensis.

In conclusion, the high divergence found in ITS sequences
of I. canariensis with a GC content lower than 60% (clades
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) could be explained by a release of evolutionary constraint and a subsequent high rate of substitution. Indeed, ITS sequences have functional constraints
in relation with the processing of the rRNA precursor producing the functional 18S, 26S and 5.8S subunits.
ITS sequences of Ilex canariensis are recombined
Evidence for recombination in divergent sequences is not
obvious. It is difficult to recognize homoplasy generated
by recombination from actual homoplasy (parallel history). Statistical methods (based on linkage desequilibrium, neutrality tests and substitution distribution along
the locus) are still too rudimentary to precisely describe
the recombination events in the set of ITS sequences
found in I. canariensis. Moreover, recombinants could
result from "jumping" PCR reaction [20-23], where prematurely terminated extension products can act as primer
on paralogous templates. This has been shown on nepGS
for Oxalis [24] and on four low-copy genes for Gossypium
[25].

The minimum number of recombination events (RM) calculated with DnaSP [12] underestimates the total number
of recombination events [26]. Thus, there is no doubt that
I. canariensis ITS sequences experienced intra-molecular
recombinations (Figure 4). The factor RM has been also
calculated for PCR products of each individual in order to
detect possible jumping PCR artifacts. In few of them
(specimens 20, 22, 24, 27, 28 and 38) recombinants have
been detected in ITS sequences resulting from a unique
PCR reaction (data not shown). This could be the result of
jumping PCR. However most of them are multiple recombinants and not simple recombinants as it is expected in
jumping PCR [10]. As an example, the alignment represented in Figure 4 shows that specimen 90 comprises two
different recombined ITS sequences resulting from the
same PCR reaction, that could be the result of jumping
PCR. DnaSP did not detect recombination between the
four cloned ITS sequences of individual 90 because
recombined fragments are paralogous sequences
fragments found in other individuals. Moreover, the
recombinants result from at least three crossover events
and are suggested not PCR artifact. Thus, they represent
true organismal intra-molecular recombinations.
The distribution of informative characters shown in Figure 4, as well as the use of programs PIST and LARD based
on maximum-likelihood analyses, demonstrate unambiguously that sequences of clade 5 (Figure 4) experienced
recombination events. This can not be generalized for
other clades. Although DnaSP suggests recombination, an
alignment demonstrating recombination, as for clade 5,
was not possible for other clades, even with the help of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/46

PIST and LARD. This could be explained by the recent origin of the recombination events observed in clade 5 and
by the fact that mutations did not yet obscured the recombined orthologous fragments. In this respect it is to be
noticed that clade 5 shows much longer branches than
other clades. This may indicate that, in clades with relatively shorter branches, mutations (or concerted evolution) did homogenize the recombined fragments,
mimicking clonal divergence. Thus it can be considered
that most clades also comprise recombined ITS sequences,
as DnaSP suggests, but of more ancient origin than those
of clade 5, and homogenized by mutation or concerted
evolution.
Recombination in highly polymorphic ITS sequences
seems a rule in plants. This is not surprising because the
mechanisms of concerted evolution in rDNA arrays are
based on crossing-over and gene conversion. It has been
reported in Begonia [27], Microseris [28], Quercus [11],
Amelanchier [29], Paeonia [30], Buddia, Gossypium, Nicotiana, Tripsacum [10], Armeria [31] and others.
In addition to the high rate of substitution of pseudogenes, at least some ITS sequences experienced recombination. This explains why the divergence between ITS
sequences of I. canariensis is much higher than between
ITS sequences of all other species investigated, knowing
that, according to their GC content (see Figure 1), they all
are potentially functional. This also explains the absence
of a bootstrap support for a monophyletic clade of I.
canariensis ITS sequences because of long branch problems due to accelerated rate of substitution and more certainly to recombination.
The origin of the ITS polymorphism in I. canariensis
Two evolutionary mechanisms could produce the
observed ITS polymorphism: an ancestral polymorphism
escaping lineage sorting or a past or recent introgression
of an alien genotype escaping concerted evolution.
Because of the influence of concerted evolution, ancestral
polymorphism is not the most likely explanation of ITS
polymorphism [31]. On the other hand, a growing
number of reports shows that ITS polymorphism is attributable to interspecific hybridization, although the parents
are not always identifiable [15,16].

Assuming that multiple ITS sequences found in I. canariensis are the result of experienced hybridization with
another species, or an ancient polymorphism with incomplete sorting, the determination of the identity of the
putative hybridizing species or the finding of genetic relationships of the putative polymorphism is not obvious.
This is because ITS sequences enclosed in non-functional
clusters have dramatically diverged from the putative
functional sequences and are recombined. All available

ITS sequences of 43 other species of Ilex, representing a
good sampling of the genus [2,3] were incorporated in the
phylogenetic analysis, altogether with all ITS sequences
found in I. perado and I. canariensis of Tenerife (Figure 1).
Most functional (above 60% GC) and non-functional
(53–54% GC) ITS clades of I. canariensis group together
but with no bootsrap support. They group with an American lineage (I. brevicuspis, I. anomala, I. microdunta, I. integerrima, I. theezans, I. guianensis, I. brasiliensis and I.
cassine). Only the GC 45% clade does not group with the
bulk of I. canariensis ITS sequences. Its position is not
defined and varies in the vicinity of a Eurasian lineage (I.
latifolia, I. leucoclada, I. maximocziana, I. rugosa and I. perado). Thus data do not support a particular relationship of
most I. canariensis ITS pseudogenes with another Ilex species, except for the pseudogenes with a GC content of
45%, that are frequently observed in I. canariensis.
In the case of hybridization involving the island species I.
canariensis, the most probable candidate would be the
sympatric species I. perado. It can not be ruled out however
that the distribution of I. canariensis was much wider in
the past [32,33] and that this hybridization may have
occurred with another unknown or extinct species of the
Eurasian lineage represented here by I. latifolia, I. leucoclada, I. maximocziana, I. rugosa and I. perado. Pseudogene
sequences (particularly the ITS sequences of clade GC
45%) being too divergent and of different nucleotide
composition, the observed relationship of clade GC 45%
with the group of species comprising I. perado is questionable because of possible spurious long branch attraction.
However, the data of the nuclear encoded plastid
glutamine synthetase (a nuclear single copy locus) are not
conflicting with an introgression of I. perado in I. canariensis. All the eight polymorphic sites observed in I. canariensis always comprise one allele shared with I. perado.
Another possibility is that these ITS pseudogenes represent a relictual ancestral polymorphism in the course of
elimination by lineage sorting or concerted evolution. In
fact ancestral polymorphism could also be the result of
ancient introgressions. The data accumulated here do not
allow a definitive conclusion.
If a putative cryptic hybridization between I. perado and I.
canariensis is confirmed, the introgression would be unidirectional because ITS sequences of I. perado do not show
any polymorphism. This situation is reminiscent of the
unilateral hybridization observed between Begonia formosana and B. aptera, where on 60 ITS sequences analysed
in natural or artificial hybrids, 58 sequences are clustering
with the ovule donor B. formosana, and only 2 are found
clustering with the pollen donor B. aptera [27]. Unidirectional interspecific hybridization linked to unilateral
incompatibility is frequently described in plants. However, this is not the only mechanism that can explain uni-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/46

directional hybridization. The flowering time of I. perado
precedes the one of I. canariensis, thus the loading of still
living I. perado pollen grains on young effective I. canariensis stigmates is more favored than the contrary. Moreover,
there are much more male than female I. perado plants in
Tenerife [34,35]. These evidences could explain the proposed unidirectional introgression.

Conclusions
This study was undertaken with the aim to study and overcome the problem of ITS polymorphism found in many
species of Ilex [3]. Introgression [3,4] and high polymorphism [5] have already been shown in several species of
Ilex. Thus, precautionary measures should be taken when
studying nuclear ITS sequences in the genus, particularly
the search for recombinant and pseudogenes. Particular
PCR conditions should be used [10,19,23]. Razafimandimbison and al. [18] were however unable to find PCR
conditions to amplify a functional ITS sequence in 2 species of Rubiaceae. Amplified ITS sequences should be
checked for function. A measure of the GC content (above
55% for a functional ITS sequence in Ilex is recommended. This study will probably make phylogenetic
interpretations easier and will certainly help to the understanding of the complex evolutionary history of Ilex [3].

Methods
Material
Thirteen individuals of I. perado ssp. platyphylla Webb. &
Berth. and 27 individuals of I. canariensis Poir. were collected in Tenerife (Las Mercedez, Aqua Garcia and Aqua
Mansa) and genomic DNA was extracted from dry leaves
as previously reported [2].
Sequencing
The plastid atpB-rbcL spacer was sequenced for the 40
specimens of Tenerife according to Cuénoud et al. [2]. In
a first experiment all ITS sequences (ITS 1, 5.8S and ITS 2)
were directly sequenced from the PCR fragment according
to Manen et al. [3]. All individuals of I. perado and five
individuals of I. canariensis produced a perfectly readable
ITS sequence with no polymorphism. On the other hand,
22 individuals of I. canariensis produced an unreadable
highly polymorphic ITS sequence. Cloning in E. coli was
necessary and four clones per individual were sequenced.
For all specimens, the nuclear encoded plastid glutamine
synthetase (nepGS) was amplified and sequenced according to Emshwiller and Doyle [36]. Polymorphisms were
also observed in most individuals of I. canariensis, but as
indels are not involved in the polymorphism, sequences
were readable and polymorphic sites were coded according to the international code for nucleotide polymorphism (see Figure 5). Sequences are deposited at GenBank
(atpB-rbcL spacer: AJ786512-AJ786551; ITS: AJ786413AJ786504; nepGS: AJ809595-AJ809628).

Phylogenetic analysis
The ITS sequences of I. canariensis and I. perado were
aligned with ITS sequences of 43 species of Ilex previously
studied in Manen et al. [3] and Phyllonoma and Helwingia,
the closest relatives of the genus Ilex (for the ITS matrix see
additional file 1).

Plastid atpB-rbcL spacer and nuclear nepGS matrices only
comprise the sequences found in Tenerife for I. perado and
I. canariensis.
Maximum parsimony trees were calculated from the atpBrbcL spacer matrix, the ITS matrix and the nepGS matrix,
using PAUP 4.0b10 [37] (heuristic search, TBR branch
swapping with 10 random additions of sequences, only
keeping the first 100 most parsimonious trees). Bootstrap
statistics of the ITS tree were calculated from 1000 replications with the same method, except that the first 10 most
parsimonious trees were kept.
Secondary structure of ITS 2
The secondary structure of ITS 2 was investigated using the
minimum free-energy program Mfold [8], which has the
advantage to provide sub-optimal folding. Sequences
were constrained to force the pairing of the 5'-end of the
26S and the 3'-end of the 5.8S regions according to the
results of Hershkovitz and Zimmer [7].
Pattern of substitution of ITS
In order to examine the pattern of substitution of ITS
sequences found in I. perado and I. canariensis, these
sequences were compared with a reconstructed Ilex ancestral sequence. This ancestral sequence was determined by
maximum likelihood [PAUP 4.0b10 with base frequencies, ti/tv ratio, proportion of invariable sites and gamma
shape parameter estimated under the HKY model (Hasegawa et al. 1985) allowing for different rate of transitions
and transversions as well as unequal base frequencies]
using the unique maximum parsimony tree obtained
from the ITS matrix of Manen et al. [3] based on 45 species
of Ilex and Helwingia and Phyllonoma as outgroup. For
comparisons, the number of substitutions (Kimura 2parameter) was calculated from this ancestral sequence
for I. perado and I. canariensis ITS sequences using PAUP.

The high frequency of deamination-like substitutions (C > T and G -> A at CpG and CpNpG sites) is typical for
pseudogenes and was also calculated from the reconstructed Ilex ancestral sequence for I. perado and I. canariensis ITS sequences, according to Buckler et al. [10] and
Muir et al. [11]. This frequency was compared with the frequency of C -> T and G -> A substitutions at non-methylated sites.

Substitutions at conserved sites of the ribosomal 5.8 S
subunit
Based on the alignment of fifty 5.8S sequences including
vertebrates, invertebrates, fungi and plants (modified
from Muir et al. [11]), 59 totally conserved sites were
determined. The number of substitutions observed at
these invariant sites in all I. perado and I. canariensis 5.8S
sequences was calculated.
Detection of recombinations
The minimum number of recombination events RM [26]
was calculated using the DnaSP program [12] in the entire
ITS matrix of I. perado and I. canariensis and in different
ITS clusters observed in I. canariensis. This program is
based on linkage desequilibrium, neutrality tests and substitution distribution along the locus. ITS sequences
showing strong evidence of recombination, as detected by
DnaSP, were submitted to PIST [13] to calculate the probability of recombination by maximum likelihood: the tree
score of these sequences is compared with the tree scores
of 1000 simulated clonal sequences along the specified
tree under the specified model of evolution. The score of
recombined sequences will tend to have larger score than
the simulated clonal sequences because richer in conflicting phylogenetic information. A maximum likelihood
tree of selected I. canariensis ITS sequences (see results)
was constructed with base frequencies, ti/tv ratio, proportion of invariable sites and gamma shape parameter estimated under the HKY model [39] and these parameters
were used to calculate the tree scores of simulated clonal
sequences.

The recombination points of three selected sequences (see
results) showing evidence of recombination were calculated by maximum likelihood using LARD [14] with the
HKY model [38]. The program calculates a maximum likelihood unrooted tree of 3 sequences and searches for a
tree with a better score assuming a recombination point in
the input sequences. After the calculation of one recombination point, the sequence alignment was truncated at
this point to search for other potential recombination
points.
