Abstract
Background: Kinesins, a superfamily of molecular motors, use microtubules as tracks and
transport diverse cellular cargoes. All kinesins contain a highly conserved ~350 amino acid motor
domain. Previous analysis of the completed genome sequence of one flowering plant (Arabidopsis)
has resulted in identification of 61 kinesins. The recent completion of genome sequencing of several
photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic eukaryotes that belong to divergent lineages offers a
unique opportunity to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of kinesins in plant and nonplant systems and infer their evolutionary relationships.
Results: We used the kinesin motor domain to identify kinesins in the completed genome
sequences of 19 species, including 13 newly sequenced genomes. Among the newly analyzed
genomes, six represent photosynthetic eukaryotes. A total of 529 kinesins was used to perform
comprehensive analysis of kinesins and to construct gene trees using the Bayesian and parsimony
approaches. The previously recognized 14 families of kinesins are resolved as distinct lineages in
our inferred gene tree. At least three of the 14 kinesin families are not represented in flowering
plants. Chlamydomonas, a green alga that is part of the lineage that includes land plants, has at least
nine of the 14 known kinesin families. Seven of ten families present in flowering plants are
represented in Chlamydomonas, indicating that these families were retained in both the floweringplant and green algae lineages.
Conclusion: The increase in the number of kinesins in flowering plants is due to vast expansion
of the Kinesin-14 and Kinesin-7 families. The Kinesin-14 family, which typically contains a Cterminal motor, has many plant kinesins that have the motor domain at the N terminus, in the
middle, or the C terminus. Several domains in kinesins are present exclusively either in plant or
animal lineages. Addition of novel domains to kinesins in lineage-specific groups contributed to the
functional diversification of kinesins. Results from our gene-tree analyses indicate that there was
tremendous lineage-specific duplication and diversification of kinesins in eukaryotes. Since the
functions of only a few plant kinesins are reported in the literature, this comprehensive
comparative analysis will be useful in designing functional studies with photosynthetic eukaryotes.

Background
Cytoskeletal networks (microtubules [MTs], actin and
intermediate filaments) play important roles in many fundamental processes in eukaryotes including cell growth,
cell division and development of organisms [1,2]. Understanding cytoskeleton organization, dynamics and functions is an active area of research in biology. Molecular
motors that organize and remodel cytoskeleton and transport various cellular components (e.g, vesicles, organelles,
chromosomes, RNA and protein complexes) play fundamental roles in all aspects of cell and developmental biology of eukaryotes [1,2]. High throughput genomic
sequencing projects have greatly facilitated the identification of the full complement of molecular motors in several phylogenetically diverse species ranging from simple
unicellular to complex multicellular organisms [1,2].
Molecular motors that function on cytoskeletal networks
belong to three groups: kinesins, dyneins and myosins.
These motors utilize energy derived from ATP hydrolysis
and transport cargo unidirectionally on one of the filamentous cytoskeletal tracks (MTs or F-actin) in the cell.
Both kinesins and dyneins use MTs as tracks for motility
whereas myosins use actin filaments (F-actin) [3,4].
Kinesins constitute a superfamily of MT motor proteins
ubiquitous in all eukaryotic organisms [1,2,5,6]. In the
mid 1980s, the first kinesin was discovered in squid giant
axons as a "novel force generating protein" involved in
vesicular transport [7]. Since then, an explosion of

research has centered upon the continual discovery, classification and functional characterization of the kinesin
superfamily. Members of the kinesin superfamily have a
highly conserved motor domain of ~350 amino acid residues, which contains ATPase and MT binding activities,
located at the N terminus, C terminus or internally [1,8].
A short neck region that often contains family-specific features and is adjacent to the motor domain works in concert with the catalytic core to produce movement [8,9]. In
addition, many kinesins have a less conserved coiled-coil
region that is important for dimerization and a non-conserved tail domain that is thought to interact with specific
cargo. All kinesins bind MTs and perform a variety of
force-generating tasks such as movement of chromosomes, vesicles, organelles and RNA protein complexes,
spindle formation and elongation, activation of protein
kinases, movement of loosely bound rafts of soluble
cargo, and MT polymerization and dynamics [5,9-13].
Since the motor-domain sequence is conserved in all
kinesins, it has been used to search completed eukaryotic
genome sequences for encoded kinesins. Based on phylogenetic analyses of known kinesins using the conserved
motor domain sequences, fourteen families designated as
Kinesin-1 to Kinesin-14 are recognized [14]. Members of
most families have an N-terminal motor domain whereas
one family (Kin-13) has an internal motor and one family
(Kin-14) has a C-terminal motor. Kinesins move unidirectionally on MTs. Kinesins with the N-terminal motor

show plus end motility whereas the C-terminal motors
move toward the minus ends of MTs [1,15-17].
While a "complete" inventory of Arabidopsis kinesins has
been reported, functional studies of plant kinesins are
limited to a few loci [18,19]. Several plant kinesins have
been shown to function in mitosis, meiosis and/or cytokinesis [20-28]. KCBP, a C-terminal minus-end-directed calmodulin-binding kinesin of the Kinesin-14 family, is
involved in trichome morphogenesis and cell division
[29-31]. This kinesin is negatively regulated by calmodulin as well as another novel calcium-binding protein
(KIC) with a single EF hand [32,33]. An internal kinesin
of the Kinesin-13 family in Arabidopsis is also involved in
trichome morphogenesis [34]. AtFRAl, an N-terminal
kinesin family member is involved in oriented deposition
of cellulose myofibrils; mutants show aberrant deposition
of cellulose microfibrils in secondary walls of fibers that
are less organized when compared to the wild type [35].
Two Arabidopsis kinesins are targeted to mitochondria
whereas another kinesin interacts with geminivirus replicating protein [36,37]. An interesting prospect of MT and
microfilament crosstalk has recently been exemplified by
studies with a plant-specific kinesin (GhKCHl) from cotton. This member of the Kinesin-14 family has a calponin
homology domain, which appears to be important in
mediating dynamic interaction between actin filaments
and MTs [38]. The motility properties of only a few plant
kinesins have been analyzed [39-41].
Thus far, genome-wide analysis of kinesin encoding genes
in plants was performed only with one plant species (Arabidopsis thaliand), which uncovered 61 kinesins. The
number of kinesins in Arabidopsis is the largest as compared to human, mouse and other completed genomes
[42,43]. Recently, genome sequences of six phylogenetically divergent photosynthetic eukaryotes (two cultivars
of rice, poplar, a green alga, a red alga and a diatom) have
been completed. In addition, genomes of seven other
non-plant systems including Giardia, which may represent
the deepest known branch in the eukaryotic lineage ([4447]; but see [48,49]) have also been sequenced. The availability of these genome sequences offers opportunities to
address a number of important questions related to

kinesin evolution and function. These include: i) do other
plants, like Arabidopsis, have a large repertoire of kinesins? ii) are there any kinesin families that are specific to
plants or a particular lineage? iii) how many kinesin families are represented in all eukaryotes? iv) what is the evolutionary relationship among plant kinesins and between
plant and non-plant kinesins? v) what is the full complement of kinesins in early-derived simple unicellular photosynthetic eukaryotes as well as in organisms that
represent early diverging eukaryotic lineages? vi) how
have these kinesins contributed to evolution of kinesins
in the most recent complex multicellular flowering
plants? vii) do plant kinesins have any domains that are
unique to plants? and viii) what is the contribution of
gene duplications and losses to kinesin evolution? To
address these questions, we have mined 529 kinesin
sequences from 19 phylogenetically diverse species. We
have performed comprehensive analyses with this data set
and inferred gene trees using Bayesian and parsimony
methods. Our gene-tree analyses included 249 sequences
from photosynthetic eukaryotes and 280 from non-photosynthetic systems. Many of these sequences were not
included in any previous analyses. Although flowering
plants have the largest number of kinesins, three or four
of the 14 kinesin families are not represented in flowering
plants whereas three of them may not be present in any
photosynthetic eukaryote. Results presented here also
indicate that flowering plants have the most kinesins primarily due to expansion of the Kinesin-7 and Kinesin-14
families. Our gene-tree analysis revealed seven of the ten
families found in flowering plants are represented in a
simple unicellular chlorophyte alga. Ten of the 14 families
are represented in Giardia lamblia ([44-47]; but see
[48,49]), an early derived eukaryote, suggesting that most
families were already present early in the evolution of
extant eukaryotes. Plant kinesins have several domains
that are not shared with non-plant systems suggesting
functional specificity and diversification in plants.

ages (opisthokonts, amoebozoa, plants, alveolates, heterokonts, discicristates and excavates) of eukaryotes [50],
for kinesins. Species were selected so as to include most of
the eight major lineages in the consensus phylogenetic
tree presented by Baldauf [50]. Inclusion of representative
members of non-plant groups is expected to help us identify plant-specific kinesins. Of the eight major eukaryotic
lineages [50], only one lineage (cercozoa) was not sampled in our analysis because none of the species in this lineage has been fully sequenced. Among the 19 species
analyzed, seven represent phylogenetically divergent photosynthetic eukaryotes that belong to monocots (two rice
cultivars, Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. nipponbare and
Oryza sativa ssp. indica cv 93-11), dicots (Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus trichocarpa), a chlorophyte alga
(Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), a red alga (Cyanidioschyzon
merolae) and a diatom (Thalassiosira pseudonana). So far,
kinesins have been analyzed only in one plant (Arabidopsis) system [43] whereas the genome sequences of six
other photosynthetic eukaryotes have been completed
recently. The red (C. merolae) and green (C. reinhardtii)
algae were included in our analysis because they are
inferred to be early derived members of the lineage that
gave rise to modern heterokonts and embryophyta [51],
respectively. Inclusion of these species allows for the analysis of evolutionary relationships between kinesins of
algae and flowering plants. The 12 non-plant species sampled include opisthokonts, amoebozoa, alveolates, heter-

okonts, discicristates and excavates. We have included
members (Giardia, Leishmania, Plasmodiuni) of three
extant lineages that diverged before the plant-animal split
[46]. In addition, Giardia is thought to be a member of the
earliest extant branch on the eukaryotic tree based on the
phylogeny inferred from several different genes, as well as
a proteome-based eukaryotic phylogeny [44-47]. It would
be interesting to see how many kinesin families were
present before the divergence of plants, animals and fungi
as it is likely that these families would represent a "basic
set" of kinesin motors [52]. We have also included Dictyostelium discoideum, which is believed to have diverged
after the plant-animal split but before the divergence of
fungi from animals [46].
As detailed in the methods section, we have used a variety
of approaches to systematically analyze the completed
genome sequences of 19 species to identify the kinesins. A
total of 529 kinesins were identified and used in our phylogenetic analysis. Table 1 shows the number of kinesins
in each of these species and lists the databases used in our
searches. The details of the kinesins including gene IDs,
gene organization, domain and family information for
each species, except Arabidopsis, are presented in Tables 2
to 7 and Additional files 1 to 12. The details of Arabidopsis kinesins were reported previously [43]. The number of
kinesins varies considerably among species. In general
flowering plants have the highest number of kinesins (Fig.

Unrooted Bayesian tree of the 529 kinesins based on their motor domain ami no-acid-plus-gap-characters. Support values from each parsimony and Bayesian analysis are presented adjacent to the nodes. Support values above each branch
correspond to Bayesian posterior probabilities whereas values below each branch correspond to parsimony jackknife support.
In both cases the leftmost values are for the amino-acid-plus-gap-characters analyses and the rightmost values are for aminoacid-characters analyses. Bayesian posterior probabilities for the amino-acid-plus-gap-characters are also shown in bold. If a
branch was unresolved in one of the other three analyses, it is indicated by "-" at the respective node. If a branch was contradicted in one of these other three analyses, it is indicated by underlined red font at the respective node with the single highest
posterior probability or jackknife support value for the contradicting clade(s) shown. Ungrouped kinesins are presented on the
left side of the main polytomy, with the exception of the plant-specific ungrouped family that is shown on the upper right of the
tree. The Ps and Lm unresolved blocks each contain 4 and 9 sequences, respectively (See Additional files 7 and 11 these
sequence IDs). Brackets denote the major eukaryotic groupings in accordance with Baldauf's nomenclature [50]. Blue brackets
indicate taxa that are from multiple groups, black brackets indicate protozoan species and red brackets are reserved for
opisthokonts. Although Pt00151235 is grouped within this family by Bayesian analysis, we favor the parsimony resolution of it
as a member of the Kinesin-10 family. For full names of species see Fig. 1 legend.

Expanded view of Kinesin-12 and Kinesin-13 families. Expansion of the Kinesin-12 and Kinesin-13 families from Fig. 2.
Experimentally studied Arabidopsis kinesins are indicated in parenthesis with their published names in bold. Green brackets indicate plant specific groups, mixed clades are shown in blue brackets, black brackets indicate protozoan species and red brackets
indicate groupings composed of opisthokonts. Purple diamond indicates a gene duplication after the divergence of red and
green algae from one another yet prior to the divergence of green algae from flowering plants. Green circles and blue squares
indicate gene duplications in flowering plants and dicots, respectively. See Fig. 2 legend for an explanation of support values.
Support values in italicized blue font indicate those clades supported in the parsimony analyses except for the exclusion of Pt
00151235 (see text). For full names of species see Fig. 1 legend. Fl. Plants, flowering plants.

1). Arabidopsis still has the largest repertoire of kinesins
[61] amongst the completed plant genomes, with P. trichocarpa next [52]. Oryza sativa ssp. japonica and O.s. indica
have 41 and 45 kinesins, respectively. Some changes in
this number may occur as refinement of newly sequenced
genomes proceeds. Not only does Arabidopsis have the
most kinesins of all plants; it has the most of all 19 species
analyzed (Fig. 1). It is surprising to see the large difference
in kinesin number between the two species of earlyderived unicellular photosynthetic eukaryotes (C. reinhardtii and C. merolae). The green alga, C. reinhardtii, has
about five times [23] the number of kinesins as the red
algae, C. merolae, which has the least number of kinesins
(only five) of all species sampled. Dictyostelium discoideum,
the social soil amoeba, has 13 kinesins. This is consistent
with what one would expect from a free living amoeba
that must search for its food and be active in cytoskeletal
motility, in addition to being able to shift from a unicellular state to a multicellular fruiting body by coordinated
aggregation of individual cells [46]. Another interesting
species with many kinesins is the intracellular immune
system pathogen L. major. This parasite has the most
kinesins among non-photosynthetic eukaryotes (Fig. 1).
Leishmania has a considerably larger repertoire of kinesins
than the amoeboid parasite, many of which appear to
have evolved by multiple gene duplications (see below).

Even though cis-splicing machinery exists in this parasite,
its 54 kinesins are all translated from single exon genes
(Chris Peacock, pers, comm.). The reason why this parasite has so many kinesins is an interesting prospect to consider. How many of these kinesins are actually functional
remains to be seen. Whether or not these kinesins function in facilitating Leishmania-host-cell interaction is currently unknown.
Construction and analyses of kinesin gene trees
We used 529 kinesin motor domain sequences in our
gene-tree analysis. The alignment of amino acid
sequences was performed using DIALIGN-T [53]. DIALIGN-T represents an improvement over DIALIGN 2.2.1
[54] in that it is less liable to favor short sequence fragments of high similarity over longer fragments of lower
similarity [53]. In contrast to programs such as Clustal X
[55], which perform global alignments, DIALIGN finds
regions of local similarity without necessarily aligning the
entire sequences with one another [56]. Because DIALIGN
does not perform alignments following a guide tree, the
alignments produced were expected to be relatively robust
to artifacts that may be introduced when aligning divergent sequences in a pairwise manner [57]. DIALIGN has
been shown to perform well relative to other alignment
programs in aligning conserved domains within rapidly

regions [53,58,59]. Four kinesin trees were constructed
with motor domain amino acid sequences using both the

parsimony and Bayesian approaches. For each approach,
amino-acid-characters and amino-acid-plus-gap-characters were used. The DIALIGN-T alignment (see Additional

Page 17 of 37

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:18

file 13), data matrices (see Additional files 14 to 17) used
to construct the tree and two parsimony and one Bayesian
trees (see Additional files 18 to 20) are available online.
The abbreviated unrooted Bayesian tree for the aminoacid-plus-gap-characters analysis is presented in Fig. 2 as
our best estimate of the relationships within the kinesin
gene family. The expanded view of kinesin subfamilies is
presented in Figures 3 to 10. This analysis was favored
over those that did not incorporate gap characters because
it incorporated all available characters from the motor
domain and is, therefore, favored by the total-evidence
criterion [60,61]. Furthermore, inclusion of the gap characters increased both the number of clades resolved (439
â 453 Bayesian; 288 â 296 parsimony) and average
branch support (90.3% â 92.0% Bayesian; 87.3% â
87.5% parsimony) in both the Bayesian and parsimony
analyses, which is consistent with the general patterns
found by Simmons et al., [62]. The Bayesian analysis was
favored over the parsimony analysis because the inferred
Bayesian tree is more resolved than the parsimony tree
and the additional resolution is largely congruent with
previous analyses with respect to resolution of the 14
kinesin families. The other three gene trees from both
Bayesian and parsimony analyses are available as supplemental data (see Additional files 18 to 20).
Each branch of the Bayesian tree in Fig. 2 indicates the
posterior probability from the amino-acid-plus-gap-characters analysis at the upper left of the branch. To allow for
inspection of the support for each branch provided by the
other analyses, the posterior probability from the aminoacid-characters-only analysis is at the upper right of each
branch, the parsimony jackknife support from the aminoacid-plus-gap-characters analysis is at the lower left, and
the parsimony jackknife support from the amino-acidcharacters-only analysis is at the lower right. If a branch
was unresolved in one of these other three analyses, it is
indicated by "-" at the respective location. If a branch was
contradicted in one of these other three analyses, it is indicated by underlined red font at the respective location
with the single highest posterior probability or jackknife
support value for the contradicting clade(s) shown.
Conflict between parsimony and Bayesian trees
There were three cases of well supported, conflicting resolution in which both Bayesian trees were contradicted by
both parsimony trees. First, in the parsimony trees Pt
00151235 was well supported as nested within the second
Kinesin-10 clade, whereas it was well supported as nested
within the Kinesin-14 clade in the Bayesian trees. Aside
from this single sequence, the Kinesin-10 and Kinesin-14
clades were largely congruent in all four trees (Figs. 8, 10).
The parsimony resolution is supported by the Kinesin-10specific domains that Pt 00151235 has, whereas the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/18

sequence lacks the Kinesin-14-specific domains. Therefore, we favor the parsimony resolution of Pt 00151235 as
a member of the Kinesin-10 family (Table 4). Second, in
the parsimony trees Tp 121289 was well supported as the
sister group of Tp 163717, whereas the clades of (Tp
121289, Ps 127973) and (Tp 163717, Lm F22.0560) were
well supported in the Bayesian trees with the former clade
resolved with the Kinesin-7 family (Figs. 2, 7). There are
no additional domains of Tp 121289 or Tp 163717 to distinguish between these alternative resolutions. Third, in
the parsimony trees Ps 128382 was unresolved in the
main polytomy, whereas it was well supported as nested
within the Kinesin-3 clade in the Bayesian trees (Fig. 4).
The Bayesian resolution is supported by the Kinesin-3specific domain that Ps 128382 has.
To test for long-branch attraction [63] in the parsimony
analyses between Pt 00151235 and the second Kinesin-10
clade, the amino-acid-plus-gap-characters parsimony
jackknife analysis was repeated after eliminating all nine
other sequences in the second Kinesin-10 clade [64].
However, this explanation was not supported because Pt
00151235 was unresolved in the main polytomy rather
than moving to within the Kinesin-14 clade. Likewise, to
test for long-branch attraction in the parsimony analyses
in the second case of conflicting resolution, the parsimony jackknife analysis was repeated after eliminating Tp
163717. However, this explanation was not supported
because both Tp 121289 and Ps 127973 were unresolved
in the main polytomy rather than being resolved as sister
groups. Therefore, we were unable to discard either of the
two alternative hypotheses regarding the relationships of
Tp 121289 and Tp 163717. Because Ps 128382 was unresolved in the main polytomy on the parsimony trees, it
was not possible to apply this test to it.
Many new kinesins are not grouped into recognized kinesin
families
All 14 currently recognized kinesin families [14] are represented in our inferred gene tree (Fig. 2). All members in
each family are presented in Figs. 3 to 10. However, 11%
of the sequences (58 of 529 sequences) were not resolved
among the lineages corresponding to previously recognized families (Fig. 2). Most of these kinesins are from
Leishmania, Giardia, Phytopthora, Chlamydomonas and Thallassiosira. These sequences may represent novel kinesin
families and/or early-derived members of the 14 recognized kinesin families that are not resolved as such in our
inferred gene tree. Several clades that are not part of the
known families contained members from two eukaryotic
groups, indicating that they are not unique to one of the
eight main eukaryotic lineages [48]. A strongly supported
clade of ten kinesins (Figs. 2, 3 plant-specific ungrouped)
from flowering plants were not resolved into any of the 14
kinesin families. However, these formed a distinct clade

the main eukaryotic lineages. Although flowering plants
have the largest number of kinesins, at least three of the 14
families are conspicuously absent in flowering plants. It is
unclear whether either three or four (Kinesin-2, Kinesin-3,
Kinesin-9 and/or Kinesin-11) of these 14 families are
absent in flowering plants because of the entirely unre-

solved flowering-plant clade (Figs. 2 and 3). Members of
Kinesin-2 form either homo- or heterodimers and are
present in ciliated and flagellated cells and function in
organelle-intraflagellar transport [2,9]. Interestingly, the

eukaryote

in intraflagellar transport [65]. Since flowering plants lack
cilia or flagella in their life cycle, this family of kinesins is
lost in this lineage. It would be interesting to see if the
land plants that have ciliated/flagellated cells in their life
cycle (e.g., bryophytes, pteridophytes and gymnosperms)

retained this family of kinesins. Unfortunately, genomes
of plants that belong to these groups have not been
sequenced to address this. Members of the Kinesin-3 family are involved in organelle transport. The Kinesin-3 family is expanded in animals with seven members in

humans, the largest of any family. Interestingly, 17 of the
54 Leishmania kinesins are grouped within the Kinesin-3
family and this grouping is strongly supported by both
Bayesian analyses. It appears that lineage-specific duplication of genes contributed to expansion of this family. The
fork-head-associated (FHA) domain present in vertebrate
members of this family is absent in all Kinesin-3 members
of Leishmania, suggesting that the acquisition of this
domain occurred after the divergence of the Leishmania
and animal lineages. The Kinesin-1 family, which is also
involved in transport of vesicles, is underrepresented in
plants. It was previously speculated [43] that there might
be a higher plant Kinesin-1/KHC family member but it
was not conclusive. It appears that Arabidopsis and O.
sativa have one Kinesin-1/KHC gene and the diatom has
two, whereas there may not be a Kinesin-1 in
Chlamydomonas. Overall, cargo-transporting kinesins are
either absent (Kinesin-2 and Kinesin-3) or underrepresented (Kinesin-1) in flowering plants. The cargo-transport functions of some of these kinesins are either not
needed in flowering plants or performed by members of
other families of kinesins or cargo transporting myosins,
which are expanded in plants [2,66]. Although Kinesin-9
family members are absent in flowering plants, they are
present in two photosynthetic eukaryotes (four in
Chlamydomonas and two in diatoms). It appears that this
family is lost in flowering plants. The functions of the
Kinesin-9 family are unknown [9]. Members of the
Kinesin-11 family function in signal transduction and
contain a few highly divergent kinesins and are absent not
only in plants but in many other lineages [67,68].
Forty indica kinesins have orthologs in japonica and three
of these (IBCD021045, IBCD025572 and IBCD012736 in
kinesin 14 family, see Figure 10A&B) are duplicated in
indica only. The duplications found in indica may have

occurred recently or japonica sequence may not be complete. In addition, two kinesins in indica (IBCD031186 in
kinesin 7 family, see Figure 7; IBCD014642 in kinesin 14
family, see Figure 10A) have no counterparts in japonica
whereas one kinesin in japonica (SBCC002748, see Figure
9) has no counterpart in indica, suggesting that either a
specific kinesin is lost in one cultivar or it is due to differences in unsequenced gaps in the genome of these two
rice cultivars.
Two families (Kinesin-7 and Kinesin-14) are vastly
expanded in plants
Kinesin-14, the C-terminal motor family, and the Kinesin7 family have greatly expanded in plants through gene
duplication. Kinesin-14 is a diverse family containing
eukaryotic representatives from almost all major eukaryotic groups; therefore, the members of this family are likely
to play important evolutionarily conserved cellular roles.
Kinesin-14 family members show minus-end motility and
perform multiple functions in cell division and organelle
transport [9,18]. Kinesin-14 is the largest family of kinesins in flowering plants (about 35% of Arabidopsis kinesins fall in this group). Flowering plant kinesins in this
family contain several domains that are not present in
non-plant kinesins. In the Kinesin-14 family, there are
several subfamilies in which the motor domain is located
in the middle or at the N or C terminus. It is interesting to
observe the many plant-specific kinesin duplications (Fig.
10). Based on the inferred phylogenetic relationships
among the plant species sampled [50,69-71], we infer a
minimum of nine duplications in the top clade of flowering-plant lineage (see 10A, internal motor-1 and -2) prior
to the divergence of monocots from dicots, seven duplications within the dicot lineage, and one duplication within
the monocot lineage (see Fig. 10A). Because the green and
red algae Kinesin-14 sequences are resolved as sister to the

Page 24 of 37
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:18

upper Kinesin-14 flowering-plant clade, we also infer that
there was a plant-specific duplication prior to the divergence of the red and green algae. One of the two copies
was then lost in both the red and green algae lineages, yet
retained in the flowering-plant lineage.
The first subfamily of the Kinesin-14 family has plant-specific kinesins that are shared by the both the green and the
red algae (Fig. 10A). Members of flowering plants in this
group have a calponin-homology (CH) domain that is
not present in green or red algae, suggesting that this
domain was gained in the flowering-plant lineage (see
domain analysis section). The second group that is well
supported by all four analyses only includes kinesins from
flowering plants (Fig. 10A). Interestingly, members of
these two top most groups have an internal motor
domain instead of the C-terminal motor domain for
which this family is named. Another group that is
restricted to the plant kingdom deals with the N-terminal
flowering plant-specific group in the Kinesin-14 family
(See Fig. 10B). Perhaps the N-terminal and internal motor
groups in the family could have arisen in flowering plants
by domain shuffling of a C-terminal motor. The members
of the seventh group with a C-terminal motor contain a
myosin tail homology 4 (MyTH4) region and talin-like
region (also known as Band 4.1 or FERM) that are not
present in any non-plant kinesins. The last large subfamily
of the Kinesin-14 family is reflective of true C-terminal
motors in plants, diatoms, animals and protozoans (Fig.
10B). From this analysis it appears that the Kinesin-14
family is composed of multiple subfamilies instead of the
two previously reported Kinesin-14A and Kinesin-14B
families [14]. Based on the location of the motor and the
presence of other domains, there could be up to eight subfamilies within the Kinesin-14 family (five of which are
likely to be plant-specific). There appears to be several
dicot- and monocot-specific duplications in plant kinesins of this family. Several of the subfamilies resulted primarily due to the emergence of novel kinesins in the plant
lineage. The members of this family with the C-terminal
motor domain have been shown to be minus-end motors
[8,72]. Although plant motors with a C-terminal domain
translocate toward the minus-end of MTs [39-41], it is not
known if the internal and N-terminal plant motors are
also minus-end motors. The functions of several Arabidopsis Kinesin-14 family members that contain the motor
domain at the C terminus (e.g., KatA/ATKl [At4g21270],
ATK5 [At4g05190], KCBP [At5g65930]), N terminus
(GRIMP/KCA1 [At5gl0470]) and KCA2 [At5g65460]) or
in the middle (KatD [At5g27000]) have been analyzed.
Several of these (ATK1, ATK5, KCBP) are involved in some
aspect of cell division [20,23,24,28,29,31], suggesting
that the plant kinesins of this family play important roles
in cell division. The cotton homolog of Arabidopsis KatD
localizes to cortical MTs and microfilaments and interacts

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/18

directly with F-actin [38]. GRIMP/KCA1 interacts with a
geminivirus replication protein and localizes to segregating chromosomes and spindle poles [37]. Both GRIMP/
KCA1 and KCA2 interact with a cyclin-dependent kinase
(CDKA;1), which controls cell cycle progression, and
localizes to MTs and phragmoplast [73], suggesting a role
for these also in cell division. The fact that plants have
unique MT arrays such as the preprophase band and
phragmoplast that play critical roles in plant cell division,
lack centrosomes to organize MTs to establish a bipolar
spindle [1] and have no (or few) dyneins, [74,75], which
are also minus-end motors, suggests that plants would
require novel kinesins to perform these plant-specific
roles and to cover the functions performed by dyneins in
animals. In addition, several reports indicate that plants
transport macromolecules (e.g. RNA and proteins) and
viruses form cell to cell through plasmodesmata [1,76].
Such transport activities may also require kinesins. Hence,
it is possible that the expansion of kinesins in plants
accounts for the need for plant-specific motors in flowering plants.
Kinesin-7/CENP-E is the second largest kinesin family in
plants and one clade (plant-specific clade in Fig. 7) contains kinesins from only photosynthetic eukaryotes with a
green algal kinesin as a sister group to those from the flowering plants. The flowering-plant-specific clade is strongly
supported by both Bayesian and parsimony analyses.
Hence, multiple members in a species in this clade (e.g.,
seven in Arabidopsis) are inferred to have arisen by at least
six gene duplications in the flowering-plant lineage prior
to the divergence of monocots from dicots, five in the
dicot lineage, and one in the monocot lineage. The functions of two members of this clade have been reported.
Kinesins encoded by At1g18370 (also called NACK1/
HINKEL) [25,26] and At3g43210 (also called STUD/TETRASPORE/NACK2) [25,27] encode functionally related
motors. Loss-of-function mutants of these kinesins
revealed their role in cytokinesis [25-27,77]. Interestingly
the NACK1 activates a MAP kinase (MAPK) [25]. The second clade in this family also contains flowering plants,
amoebozoa and heterokonts, but not opisthokonts (vertebrates, invertebrates and fungi). Two Arabidopsis members of this group are targeted to mitochondria [36],
implying an unknown function for these kinesins in this
organelle. The third group contains kinesins from flowering plants and amoebozoa. Members of these groups are
inferred to be more closely related to one another than to
the small, animal subfamily. Because of extensive duplication in the CENP-E family in plants, the members of this
family may have been recruited to perform plant-specific
functions. In animals, members of this family function in
capturing kinetechore MTs. Studies with some members
of plant kinesins that belong to Kinesin-7 indicate their
role in cytokinesis and some unknown function in mito-

chondria [36,77]. Overall, our analyses indicate that there
was tremendous diversification in Kinsin-14 and Kinesin7 families in flowering plants.
Seven of the ten kinesin families in flowering plants are
present in Chlamydomonas
Chlamydomonas, a member of chlorophyte algae, represents the sister group of the flowering plants given our
taxon sampling [46,50]. Hence, the analysis of kinesin
families in this species should provide some insights into
evolution of kinesins in flowering plants. Chlamydomonas,
despite the fact that it is unicellular, has 23 kinesins (Table
3). Twenty of these were grouped into nine recognized
families whereas the remaining three are ungrouped
(Table 3). Kinesin-1, -3, -6, -10 and -11 families are absent
in Chlamydomonas. Of the ten kinesin families present in
flowering plants, seven are present in Chlamydomonas (Fig.
2). Three families (Kinesin-1, -6 and -10) of flowering
plants are inferred to have been lost in the Chlamydomonas
lineage. Two families (Kinesin-2 and Kinesin-9) that are
present in Chlamydomonas were lost in the flowering-plant
lineage. One of these families (Kinesin-2) is involved in
intraflagellar transport. As mentioned above, the absence
of flagella/cilia in flowering plants may have resulted in
the loss of this family.

The red alga (C. merloae) has only five kinesins that belong
to four families (Table 2) whereas the diatom (T. pseudonana) has 25 kinesins (about the same number as in the
green alga) that fall into nine known kinesin families with
four kinesins unresolved (Table 7). Although the green
alga and the diatom have nine families, unlike
Chlamydomonas, the diatom has Kinesin-1 and Kinesin-6
but may not have members of the Kinesin-2 or Kinesin-8
families. Remarkably, Kinesin-14 is the largest family in
all photosynthetic eukaryotes. Among the 14 recognized
families, only four (Kinesin-5, -7, -12 and 14) were shown
to be present in all photosynthetic eukaryotes (Fig. 11).
The absence of myosins and dyneins in the red alga (C.
merolae) suggests that kinesins play important roles in this
species [48,78].
Giardia, an early-derived eukaryote, has ten of the
fourteen kinesin families
In Giardia there are 24 kinesins (see Additional file 12).
This is more than half the number of kinesins found in
humans [6]. However, Giardia has no recognizable
myosin [48], suggesting that kinesins perform most of the
transport functions. Sixteen of the 24 kinesins in Giardia
were resolved into ten known families whereas the
remaining eight were unresolved (see Additional file 12).
If Giardia is indeed part of the earliest derived extant lineage of the eukaryotes and therefore existed prior to the
plant-animal split [44,46,47] the ten families with representatives in Giardia are inferred to represent the basic set

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/18

of kinesin families in early eukaryotes. The families that
are not represented in Giardia are Kinesin-6, -10, -11 and
-12. Hence, these families may have emerged later in
eukaryotic evolution through gene duplication. Four of
the ungrouped kinesins in Giardia did not group with
kinesins from other species whereas the remaining four
grouped either with Leishmania or Chlamydomonas kinesins (see Fig. 2). Many of the domains found in flowering
plants and animals are not present in Giardia (Fig. 11).
Other kinesin families in plants
All flowering-plant kinesins from the Kinesin-4 family
form a well-supported clade as the sister group of a Chylamydomonas sequence (Fig. 5). Two Chlamydomonas
kinesins in this family did not group with flowering
plants, though this resolution was not supported in the
parsimony analyses (Fig. 5). A member of this family is
involved in cell wall deposition [35]. Kinesin-5 family
motors function in cell division and spindle formation
[79]. All flowering-plant kinesins of the Kinesin-5/BIMC
family form a well-supported clade sister to the single
Chlamydomonas sequence (Fig. 5). Plant members of this
family, like their animal counterparts, are likely to function in cell division [80]. Members of the Kinesin-6 family
that function in cytokinesis in animals are not inferred to
have undergone any gene duplications in plants (in which
both copies have been retained as functional genes).
There is only one kinesin of this family in each of the flowering plant species analyzed here and none in the green or
red algae. Since cytokinesis in plants is quite different
from animals [1], it appears that members of other kinesins families perform this function. Kinesin-8 members are
found in plants, fungi and animals. Oryza and Arabidopsis
have two Kinesin-8 genes whereas Populus has one (Fig.
6). The non-plant members function in nuclear migration
and mitochondrial transport. The function of plant members of this family remains unknown. Plant kinesins associated with the Kinesin-10 family were resolved as two
separate clades from the main polytomy (Fig. 8) indicating that two copies of Kinesin-10 were present in flowering plants prior to the divergence of monocots from
dicots.

The Kinesin-12 family members function in organelle
transport [9]. This family includes kinesins from both
plants and animals. There are multiple members of this
family in each flowering plant species. The flowering
plant members formed two distinct clades, one as a sister
group to Chlamydomonas, with the red algae sequence as
sister to both (Fig. 9). Based on this resolution, we infer at
least one gene duplication after the divergence of red and
green algae from one another yet prior to the divergence
of green algae from flowering plants, three duplications in
the flowering-plant lineage prior to the divergence of
monocots from dicots, and two duplications within the

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:18

dicot lineage. Two plant members of this group localize to
a plant-specific structure called the phragmoplast [22].
Members of the Kinesin-13 family, most of which have
internal motors, transport vesicles and have MT depolymerizing activity [81,82]. Plant members of this family also
form a distinct clade with the Chlamydomonas kinesin as a
sister group (Fig. 9). These internal-motor plant kinesins
are distinct from the other internal-motor plant kinesins
(found only in plants) in the Kinesin-14 family.
Domain analysis
Domain analysis was performed on all eukaryotes used in
this study as described in the Methods section. The most
prevalent domain is the coiled-coil region; almost every
kinesin sequence analyzed has a coiled-coil prediction
(based on the SMART algorithm [83] (see Tables 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7 and Additional files 1 to 12). Among the kinesins analyzed here, about 30 known functional domains (not
including the motor domain and coiled-coil region) are
found. Fig. 11 shows the list of functional domains and
their presence in various species. A schematic diagram of
kinesins depicting all the domains in the green alga, red
alga and diatom are shown in Fig. 12 whereas domain figures of Populus and one species of Oryza are shown in Figs.
13 and 14, respectively. Domains in Arabidopsis kinesins
were reported previously [43]. Various known domains in
non-plant systems are indicated in Additional files 1 to
12. Interestingly, not a single domain is present in all
kinesins. Instead, most domains are restricted to a particular lineage (Fig. 11) suggesting that most of these are
gained later in evolution and have novel functions. This is
also supported by the fact that in Giardia most of these
domains (except fork head associated and helix-turn-helix
domains) are absent. Some domains such as myosin tail
homology domain 4 (MyTH4) and band 4.1 (also called
talin-like region or FERM) are restricted to green algae and
flowering plants (Fig. 11). Although MyTH4 and band 4.1
domains are present in several animal proteins including
some myosins, they are not found in non-plant kinesins.
Interestingly, in Arabidopsis the MyTH4 and band 4.1 are
present in one kinesin and are not present in any other
protein encoded in the genome [83]. We have previously
shown that MyTH4 and talin-like regions are involved in
binding to MTs [84], suggesting that it may be involved in
cross-linking and/or bundling MTs. It was recently shown
that MyTH4 and band4.1 in myosins also bind MTs [85],
hence these domains are likely to function in cross-linking
actin and MT cytoskeleton and/or transfer of cargo
between two different cytoskeletal elements.

Calponin homology (CH) and kinesin-related (KR)
domains are found in flowering plants but not in green
and red algae or heterotrophs (Fig. 11). There are several
kinesins with one CH domain and a KR domain in each
flowering plant analyzed here (see Figs. 13 and 14). All

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/18

CH domain kinesins belong to the Kinesin-14 family and
were resolved as the first clade in this family (see 10A).
The only other protein family that has the CH domain is
fimbrin. Plant fimbrins have four copies of the CH
domain and bind F-actin. The CH domain is a protein
module of about 110 residues found in cytoskeletal and
signal transduction proteins either as a single copy or multiple copies in tandem. Proteins with a tandem pair of CH
domains cross-link F-actin, bundle actin or connect intermediate filaments to cytoskeleton [86]. Proteins with a
single copy are involved in signal transduction [87].
Although plant kinesins have only one CH domain,
recently it was shown that a kinesin with this domain
interacts with F-actin, suggesting that the kinesins with
this domain may be involved in interaction between actin
and MT cytoskeleton [38]. The function of the KR domain
is not known. However, the kinesins with this domain
associate with the phragmoplast [21,22] and belong to
the Kinesin-12 family (Fig. 9). Several flowering-plant
kinesins and one non-plant (Leishmania) kinesin have
armadillo/betacatenin-like (ARM) repeats that are known
to mediate protein-protein interactions. Diverse proteins
contain ARM repeats that form a superhelix of helices and
function in intracellular signaling and cytoskeletal regulation. Although none of the vertebrate and invertebrate
kinesins have an ARM, a Kinesin-2 family-associated protein called KAP3 in animals contains the ARM repeat
[2,88]
Animal kinesins have some domains that are not found in
photosynthetic eukaryotes. These include fork-head associated (FHA), pleckstrin homology (PH), CAP-Gly
domains and WD-40 repeats. The FHA domain is known
to interact with phosphothreonine in proteins. Cap-gly is
a glycine-rich domain of about 40 amino acids that is
found in cytoskeleton-associated proteins (CAPs). The
WD-40 repeats are also short (about 40 residues) motifs
that often terminate in Trp-Asp (W-D) dipeptide and facilitate the formation of multi-protein complexes. Two of
these domains (FHA and PH) are present in several protozoans (Fig. 11), suggesting that these domains may have
been present in kinesins in the most recent common
ancestor of all extant eukaryotes.
The only domain common to both plants and animals
(both invertebrates and vertebrates) is the helix-hairpinhelix (HHH) DNA binding motif in the Kinesin-10 family
that functions in chromosome segregation (Fig. 11). A
member of this family has been shown to bind DNA ([89]
and it is likely that others with this domain also bind DNA
and function in chromosome segregation. However, the
HHH domain is not present in fungi or the green or red
algae, suggesting that plant and animals may have
acquired this domain independently. Overall, the domain
distribution in kinesins suggests several domains were

Page 27 of 37

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:18

added to plant and animal kinesins after the plant-animal
split. Interestingly, there are several domains present only
in either Leishmania or Phytopthora sojae, which suggests
tremendous diversification of kinesins in lower eukaryotes that may have to do with their unique life cycle and cell
biology. In diatom, most kinesins are short (Table 7 and
Figure 12), which could be due to poor quality of the gene
models.
Genome duplication in flowering plants may have
contributed to the expansions of kinesins in this group
Whole genome duplications are believed to be a driving
force for genome evolution in angiosperms since many
modern diploids appear to be ancient polyploids [90,91].
In Arabidopsis, the duplicated segments represent about
58% of the genome and several kinesins are present in the
duplicated regions [43,92]. In Oryza, 18 pairs of duplicated segments cover 65.7% of the mapped super-scaffolds [93]. To visually represent the number of O. sativa
ssp. japonica kinesins that fall within these segmental
duplicated regions, an approximated chromosome map
was generated according to the genomic map presented by
Guyot and Keller, [94]. Figure 15 depicts the distribution
of kinesins across the 12 Oryza chromosomes. Roughly 26
of the 41 japonica kinesins are within duplicated segments. Chromosome 3 has the most kinesin genes (6),
whereas chromosome 10 has none. The remaining chromosomes contain one or more kinesin encoding genes.
The duplicated region in the long arm of chromosome 1
contains three kinesins (OSBCC02630, OSBCC02748,
OSBCC03463); the corresponding duplicated block on
chromosome 5 has only two (OSBCC18779,
OSBCC19161), which could be suggestive of a gene loss
event. The duplicated block on the short arm of chromosome 2 also may have experienced a gene loss event as it
is bereft of any kinesins, whereas its counterpart on the
long arm of chromosome 6 contains a single
(OSBCC22107) kinesin.
Intron/exon organization of kinesin genes
Information on the presence of introns in kinesins of all
species analyzed here is presented in Tables 2 to 7 and
Additional files 1 to 12. All kinesins in Chlamydomonas
and flowering plants have many introns whereas introns
are absent in kinesin genes of red alga, Giardia and Leishmania. Because of the large number of introns in kinesin
genes of most species, the diversity of kinesin motors may
increase by alternative splicing of kinesin pre-mRNAs.
Although the extent of alternative splicing of kinesin premRNAs in plants is not known, there are examples in animals where alternative splicing of some kinesins results in
generation of isoforms with different domains and with
distinct functions [95,96].

Conclusion
Flowering plants have the largest number of kinesins
among all species yet sequenced. Gene duplication and
functional diversification of specific families (e.g.,
Kinesin-14 and Kinesin-7) appears to have contributed to
the high number of kinesins in flowering plants. Addition
of novel domains to kinesins in lineage-specific groups
contributed partly to the functional diversification of
kinesins. The Kinesin-14 family, which typically contains
a C-terminal motor, has many plant kinesins that have the
motor domain in the middle or at the N terminus as well
as at the C terminus. The presence of most kinesin families
of flowering plants in Chlamydomonas indicates that these
families were retained in both lineages. Since plants have
no or few dyneins, it appears that the kinesin family of MT
motors has expanded in plants. Despite the large number
of kinesins in flowering plants, three or four of the 14 recognized families are absent. The vast expansion of some
kinesin families in flowering plants suggests that they are
likely to perform plant-specific functions. Many kinesins
in Leishamania, Giardia and Chlamydomonas were not
resolved with known kinesin families and may represent
novel kinesin families and/or early-derived members of
the 14 recognized kinesin families that are not resolved as
such in our inferred gene tree. Lineage-specific domain
architecture in the plant and opisthokont lineages and
absence of these domains in kinesins of other eukaryotes
suggests acquisition of these domains more recently. The
gene-tree analysis presented here is important for understanding kinesin evolution and should provide a framework to study cellular roles of kinesins. The challenge
ahead is to elucidate the functions of individual kinesins
and their regulation.

Methods
Identification and analyses of kinesins in recently
completed genome sequences
All BLAST searches were conducted by using three distinct
motor domain sequences from the Kinesin-1 (human
KHC, N-terminal motor), Kinesin-13 (mouse KIF2, internal motor domain) and Kinesin-14 (AtKCBP, C-terminal
motor domain) families. Unless otherwise noted, BLAST
searches were done using all three motor domains as queries. In all BLASTP searches we used an E value cut off of
1. With this cut off value, all database searches yielded
kinesins and many unrelated proteins. We then performed domain analysis on all hits as described below in
section II. All proteins with kinesin motor domain are
retained whereas the rest are eliminated.
i) Oryza sativa ssp. japonica
All of the available genome sequences of this subspecies
were extensively analyzed for kinesins as described below.

a) Searches at NCBI and Bioverse
BLASTP searches at [97] using the "Oryza sativa" (ssp.
japonica) protein database were performed. Sequences
with each motor-domain search were concatenated into a
single file and duplicates were removed. The same query
sequences were used in BLASTP searches against the nr
database at NCBI [98]. After the output files were parsed
and compared with the original PlantBlast searches, a preliminary total of 41 kinesins were identified. To identify
the kinesins that may not have been annotated in the
genome using the gene-prediction programs, TBLASTN
searches were performed against the PlantBlast "Oryza
sativa" DNA sequence database. This search resulted in
identification of one new kinesin that was not part of the
preliminary total obtained via BLASTP searches.

XP_450032.1 (971aa) is the truncated version of
XP_450031.1 (1035aa), which better corresponds to
OSSBCC029113 (1045aa). Hence, XP_450032.1 was
eliminated. XP_483647.1 and XP_483646.1 (986aa and
1003aa, respectively) are also duplicates, but we eliminated XP_483646.1 from the NCBI list because the 986
amino acids of XP_483647.1 were a better match with
OSSBC028926 (965aa). Consequently, theoriginal list of
44 NCBI kinesins has been decreased to 41. This analysis
showed that all 41 kinesin sequences derived from NCBI
searches were referenced to the BGF Syngenta predicted
japonica sequences. Therefore, BGF Syngenta kinesins
were used in order to foster continuity for gene-tree analyses. Analysis of all 55 BGF kinesins using Interproscan
[102] resulted in (see Section II) a total of 41 kinesins.

Analysis of Bioverse Oryza database at [99] using the keyword, "kinesin" yielded 72 hits. The amino acid sequences
from these 72 hits were extracted for BLASTP searches
against the nr and PlantBlast databases at NCBI and
against each other. This analysis resulted in identification
of two new additional kinesins (bringing the total to 44),
whereas the rest corresponded either to previous kinesin
predictions or were not kinesins.

ii) Oryza sativa ssp. indica
For the subspecies indica cv. 93-11, BGF and FGENESH
protein databases were downloaded from the ftp site at
[100]. BLASTP searches were performed as above using
similar criteria. After parsing the output files, the 54
FGENESH predictions were reciprocally blasted against
the 55 BGF indica sequences and it was found that all
FGENESH predictions were included in the BGF predictions. Analysis of these sequences using Interproscan as
described in Section II yielded a total of forty-five indica
kinesins.

b) Searches at Oryza genome databases
The protein predictions for ssp. japonica were downloaded
from rice genome database [100]. Recently, the analysis of
two subspecies of Oryza (indica and japonica) was refined
[93]. The Syngenta predictions were refined by using a
new program, BGF (Beijing Gene Finding), developed by
the Gene Finding Team at BGI for gene identification in
eukaryotic genomic DNA sequences. It is based on
Dynamic Programming and HSMM (Hidden SemiMarkov Model) algorithm with a special emphasis on
Oryza genomes [101]. BLASTP searches were performed.
The output files were parsed, concatenated and duplicates
were removed. Fifty-five possible kinesins were found and
their full-length amino acid sequences were retrieved.
FGENESH (another gene finding program) predictions
were also downloaded from [100] and used for BLAST
searches. The predicted kinesins here were blasted against
the BGF Syngenta predictions and no new kinesins were
found. The kinesins obtained from NCBI were used in a
BLASTP search against the BGF Syngenta predictions. All
sequences from NCBI were accounted for by the BGF Syngenta sequences. Closer inspection of the output file
revealed that two submissions made by independent
investigators to GenBank, AAF78897 (817aa) and
CAE05519 (1094aa) are duplicates, with AAF78897 being
a truncated version of CAE05519. AAF78897 was eliminated from the original NCBI list because the CAE05519
sequence is similar to the BGF predicted OSSBC014640
(1109aa) in sequence length. Also predictions
XP_450031.1 and XP_450032.1 are duplicates.

iii) Arabidopsis thaliana
A. thaliana accession numbers for kinesins were obtained
[43] and used to retrieve the full-length sequences of all
61 kinesins from TAIR [103].
iv) Populus trichocarpa
A predicted protein database is not yet available for P. trichocarpa. This database presented a unique problem as the
gene/protein predictions were done using four
(FGENESH, EUGENE, GRAIL, GENEWISE) eukaryotic
gene-prediction programs. Protein predictions at [104]
from each program were searched using the keyword,
"kinesin". This analysis yielded 115 putative kinesins (36
FGENESH, 50 EUGENE, 5 GRAIL/GENWISE, 24 EST_EXT
FGENESH). Duplicate removal and domain analyses produced a set of 52 unique sequences (see Section II).
v) Cyanidioschyzon merolae
The C. merolae annotated coding sequences and translated
ORF databases at [105,106] were used for BLASTP
searches. This search yielded five kinesins, which were
extracted using the search function at [106] and inputting
the locus accessions.
vi) Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
BLASTP searches were performed against the Version 2
protein models database at [104]. The hits were parsed of

Page 29 of 37
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:18

duplicates and 35 sequences were extracted from the database. This analysis yielded 23 kinesins (see Section II).
vii) Thalassiosira pseudonana
T. pseudonana release 1.0 predicted proteins database was
downloaded from JGI and used for BLASTP searches.
Twenty-seven kinesins were extracted, but only 22 were
used in our gene tree analyses (see Section II).
viii) Ciona intestinalis
C. intestinalis release 1.0 predicted-proteins database was
downloaded from JGI and analyzed in the manner
described above. Thirty-five potential kinesins were
found, but the last hit was only 93 amino acids long and
was discarded.
ix) Phanerochaete chryosporium
Due to the lack of a predicted protein database for P. chryosporium, potential kinesin sequences were acquired by
means of advanced-keyword searches at JGI with the
query, "kinesin". Eleven hits were found and downloaded
in FASTA format but only eight were used in gene-tree
analyses (see Section II).
x) Phytophthora sojae
The P. sojae predicted protein database was downloaded
from [104] and used for BLASTP searches. Interproscan
analysis of 56 hits led to 43 possible kinesins.
xi) Giardia lamblia
A translated ORF database for G. lamblia was downloaded
from [107]. BLASTP searches of this database returned 24
hits. These sequences were extracted from the database
and analyzed using Interproscan.
xii) Homo sapiens
The IDs of 36 kinesins obtained from the Kinesin
HomePage [108] were used to acquire the protein
sequences using batch entrez at NCBI [109]. Sequences
were run through Interproscan for domain analysis and
only 32 sequences were kept (see Section II).

Since this number is smaller than what was found in previously published studies, the CELERA protein database
was downloaded from [110] and used for BLASTP
searches. Forty-four putative kinesins were obtained and
analyzed by Interproscan.
Sequences harboring motor domains that were less than
290 amino acids were discarded. The remaining 26
sequences were blasted against the 32 NCBI kinesins to
remove duplicates. Eight unique CELERA sequences were
appended to the 32 NCBI sequences for a working total of
40 human kinesins.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/18

xiii) Drosophila melanogaster
BLASTP searches using HsKHC at [111] were performed.
Sequences were downloaded and reciprocally blasted
against each other. Five sequences (CG1453-PA, -PB, -PC,
-PD and -PE) are replicates, thus only CG1453-PA was
retained for analysis. Likewise, 8183-A and 8183-B are
duplicates and 8183-A was kept. Also CG9913-A and B are
duplicates and only 9913-A was kept. After Interproscan
analysis 25 possible kinesins were found.
xiv) Caenorhabditis elegans
BLASTP searches were performed at [112]. Nineteen
sequences were retrieved and run through Interproscan.
Sequence F22F4.3, which has a short motor domain (248
amino acids) was removed and corresponding
GI|7499692 from NCBI, which has a longer predicted
protein was used instead.
xv) Dictyostelium discoideum
Protein sequences were downloaded from [113] and used
for BLASTP searches. Thirteen possible kinesin hits were
retrieved and analyzed by Interproscan.
xvi) Plasmodium falciparum
P.
falciparum-predicted
protein
databases
(Pfa3D7_WholeGenome_Annotated_PEP_2004.11.23
and
Pfa3D7_WholeGenome_Automatic_PEP_2004.11.23)
were downloaded from [114] and used in BLASTP
searches. Nine sequences were found from the annotated
PEP database, whereas 25 sequences were recovered from
the automated PEP database.

The 25 automated PEP sequences were extracted and
reciprocally blasted to eliminate duplicates. A cross blast
was performed between the two databases that resulted in
9 kinesins.
xvii) Leishmania major
The L. major amino acid database was downloaded from
[115] and used for BLASTP searches. Fifty-five sequences
were retrieved and reciprocally blasted to search for duplicates. The final number of kinesins in this species is 54
after one duplicate was removed.
xviii) Saccharomyces cerevisiae
BLASTP searches at [116] recovered six kinesins.
xix) Schizosaccharomyces pombe
BLASTP searches at [117] resulted in nine kinesins.

Additional searches of six frame translations of the
genome sequences have not yielded any new kinesins.

Analysis of domains and retrieval of motor domain
sequences
a) Interproscan analyses
Interproscan [118] was downloaded to perform batch
analyses of the full-length sequences of the putative kinesins from all species. Start and end positions of motor
domains were obtained by SMART predictions. The 55
full-length BGF-japonica sequences were scanned; inspection
of
OsSBCC020712
(indica
ortholog,
OsIBCD019766), a 192 amino acid protein provided the
impetus for establishing the criteria necessary to generate
a working list of kinesins for gene-tree analyses. Global
alignments of all japonica kinesins to AtKCBP were examined and any sequences missing conserved domains such
as ATP binding sites or with motor domains that were
generally shorter than 290 amino acids were discarded.
Adherence to these criteria reduced the 54 potential
japonica kinesins to 41. Following these criteria, ssp. indica
sequences were reduced to 45. The 115 P. trichocarpa hits
(FGENESH, EUGENE, EST_EXT FGENESH) were scanned
and filtered of any sequences that did not contain motor
domains. Of these, 52 hits (21 FGENESH, 21 EUGENE,
10 EST_EXT FGENESH) contained the motor domain.
The remaining sequences that did not contain the motor
domain were eliminated as well as those that contained
truncated
motor
domains
(FGENESHl_pg.C_scaffold_70000181
and
FGENESHl_pg.C_LG_I000890). Thirty-five C. reinhardtii
sequences were scanned and all sequences with motor
domains shorter than 290 amino acids were discarded to
yield 23. Some T. pseudonana proteins were extremely
short and consisted only of truncated motor domains.
Consequently, the working number of kinesins was lowered to 22. Thirty-four C. intestinalis sequences were
scanned and the number of kinesins was reduced to 29
due to truncated motor domains or very short sequences.

Scans of the 11 P. chryosporium sequences reduced the
number of kinesins in this species to eight. Homo sapiens
sequences GI6225915 and GI3978240 are duplicates.
Sequence GI19923949 with a motor domain (232aa) was
excluded. Twenty-six D. melanogaster kinesins were
scanned and only 25 were truly predicted kinesins. The 55
L. major sequences were scanned and one sequence
(LmjF25.2410) was removed because it had no motor
domain.
b) Extraction of motor domain
Motor-domain sequences were extracted from their entire
protein sequences by using the EMBOSS seqret utility
[119] with base ranges obtained from SMART predictions.
Concatenation of all motor domain files together yielded
a final number of 529 kinesin sequences for gene-tree
analysis. All coiled-coil predictions were found by utilization of SMART predictions at [83]. A total of 529

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/18

sequences were included in the analysis. Ten sequences
had one or two ambiguous amino acids, for a total of 12.
Prior to alignment, all 12 internal stop codons (from eight
sequences with one to three internal stops each) were
changed to amino acid ambiguities ("X").
Gene-tree construction
Alignment of amino acid kinesin-motor-domain
sequences was performed using DIALIGN-T 0.1.2 [53]
with the default settings (length of a low-scoring region =
4; maximum fragment length that is allowed to contain
regions of low quality = 40). Amino acids from individual
sequences that DIALIGN did not align (5,126) were
replaced with ambiguities. The DIALIGN output file was
6,046 positions long. Of these, 2,584 positions included
aligned amino acid(s) and 834 (32%) of those positions
were parsimony-informative.

SeqState 1.2 [120] was use to implement simple indel
coding [121] for gaps that were flanked by aligned residues at both the amino and carboxy termini. Of the 1,190
non-terminal gap characters, 668 were parsimonyinformative. Fifty-one percent of the cells were either
missing data or inapplicables for the parsimony-informative gap characters, as were 60% of the cells for the parsimony-informative amino acid characters. To examine the
effect of incorporating gap characters into the study, genetree analyses were performed both with and without the
gap characters. Gene-tree analyses were performed using
amino acid characters. Although amino acid characters
have problems with convergence [122,123] and composite coding [124], that nucleotide characters are not subject
to, they are expected to perform relatively better when
high genetic distances occur among closely related terminals included in the analysis [125], as is the case here. This
expectation is based on silent substitutions undergoing
saturation (i.e., multiple hits along individual branches).
Gene-tree inference was performed using both parsimony
and Bayesian MCMC [126] approaches. Parsimony tree
searches were performed using PAUP* 4.0b10 [127] with
all characters assigned equal weights. Jackknife analyses
were performed using 1,000 replicates with each replicate
consisting of one tree-bisection-reconnection heuristic
search and only one tree held. Following Farris et al.,
[128], the deletion probability for each character was set
at 36.7879% and "Jac" resampling was emulated, resulting in support values roughly equivalent to those provided by the bootstrap [129].
Bayesian tree searches were performed using MrBayes 3.1
[130] with a mixed amino acid model. All analyses were
performed with four chains per analysis and trees sampled
every 100 generations. A preliminary analysis of over 3.6
million generations for the amino-acid-characters-only
data matrix was performed using MrBayes 3.0b4. To speed

Page 31 of 37

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:18

convergence in the final analyses, the MAP tree topology
found in this preliminary analysis was specified as the initial user tree with 20 permutations [131].
For the amino-acid-characters-only data matrix, three
independent runs were performed for between 1,001,000
and 1,628,500 generations each. All three runs asymptotically approached the same stationarity within the first
200,000 generations, and the remaining 30,919 trees were
used to infer the posterior probabilities for individual
clades. The analysis that reached 1,628,500 generations
was performed in parallel on two dual-processor 1.8 GHz
Power Mac G5 computers and ran for approximately 6
weeks. The other two independent runs were executed for
seven weeks on a cluster of dual-processor 1 GHz IBM
PCs. The data matrix that included gap characters was analyzed using a mixed model with the binary Felsenstein
(1981)-type model applied to the gap-characters partition
with the ascertainment bias set to variable, as suggested by
Ronquist et al., [131]. The no-common-mechanism
model [132] was not applied to the gap characters because
MrBayes 3.1 crashed when applying this model together
with a parametric model in a mixed-model analysis. Seven
independent runs were performed for between 272,500
and 1,118,100 generations each. All seven runs asymptotically approached the same stationarity, six of which did
so within the first 150,000 generations, and the seventh
within the first 450,000 generations because of a late stepwise increase in likelihoods. The remaining 28,000 trees
were used to infer the posterior probabilities for individual clades. The analysis that reached 1,118,100 generations was executed in parallel for approximately five
weeks on two dual processor 1.8 GHz Power Mac G5 computers, whereas the other six independent runs were executed for seven weeks on the previously mentioned
cluster.
Majority-rule consensus trees for the Bayesian analyses
were calculated using PAUP*. Note that although Bayesian analyses appear to be more efficient than parsimony
analyses [133], they also can produce inflated support values [134-136]. Also of concern for Bayesian analyses of
these data matrices, which include high proportions of
cells with missing data and inapplicables, is that smaller
clades may receive high support despite ambiguous resolution of "wildcard" terminals [137]. This may account, in
part, for the greater resolution in the Bayesian trees (439
and 453 clades resolved in the amino-acid-only and
amino-acid-plus-gap-character analyses, respectively)
than in the parsimony trees (288 and 296 clades resolved)
given the many completely unresolved terminals in both
the Bayesian (36 and 20 terminals) and parsimony (107
and 112 terminals) trees.

The rooting of the kinesin family used by Goodson et al.,
[138], Kim and Endow [139], and Reddy and Day [43] is
arbitrary. Outgroup sequences are to be selected such that
all members of the ingroup are more closely related to one
another than any one of them is to the outgroups (i.e., the
ingroup should be monophyletic relative to the outgroup;
[140]. Although ScSMY1 is "a highly divergent kinesin
protein" [139], this does not satisfy the criterion of selecting an outgroup. See Lawrence et al., [42] for an alternative rooting, wherein ScSMY1 is nested within the
Kinesin-I family. Following Hirokawa [3], Miki et al., [6],
Iwabe and Miyata [52], Schoch et al., [141] and AbdelGhany et al., [142], our gene trees are presented as
unrooted. All gene trees (except Fig. 2) were drawn using
a combination of automatic and manual methods. The
use of TreeGraph 1.0b8 [143] greatly facilitated the making of complex tree figures. Though TreeGraph allows one
to specify node labels, ours were inputted manually using
an external drawing program. TreeGraph can be downloaded from [144].
Analysis of gene structure and expression data
Gene-structure information was obtained by performing
searches with gene identifiers at the appropriate web
pages. For G. lamblia, the complete contig assembly was
downloaded and used as a database for BLASTN searches
using the 24 G. lamblia sequences in nucleotide format
(obtained from [107]). All 24 sequences returned contig
hits that were 100% identical with no gaps, indicating that
there are no introns in G. lamblia kinesins. For the eight
human Celera sequences, a Celera transcript database was
downloaded and searched with the Celera protein IDs for
corresponding transcripts that have been annotated with
exon number.

Expression data were collected by performing BLAST
searches against appropriate databases (O. sativa ssp.
japonica, H. sapiens EST database, L. major EST database).
A full sequence file containing japonica cDNAs was downloaded from [145] and used for BLASTP searches using the
41 BGF Syngenta kinesins as queries. No cDNA data were
available for indica sequences. For the NCBI human kinesins, EST data were determined by performing a TBLASTN
search against the human EST database using the 32 NCBI
sequences. Leishmania major expression data were
obtained by performing a TBLASTN search using the 54
full-length sequences against a database of 2,184 EST
sequences. There were no hits found.
Mapping of kinesins in O. sativa ssp. japonica
chromosomes
Chromosomal duplications in ssp. japonica on the
genomic map were based on Guyot and Keller [94]. Chromosomes were rescaled appropriately and kinesins were

mapped according to base pair positions obtained from
[100].
