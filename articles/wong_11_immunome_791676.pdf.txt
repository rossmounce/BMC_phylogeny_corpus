Immunome database for marsupials and
monotremes
Emily SW Wong1, Anthony T Papenfuss2 and Katherine Belov1*

Abstract
Background: To understand the evolutionary origins of our own immune system, we need to characterise the
immune system of our distant relatives, the marsupials and monotremes. The recent sequencing of the genomes
of two marsupials (opossum and tammar wallaby) and a monotreme (platypus) provides an opportunity to
characterise the immune gene repertoires of these model organisms. This was required as many genes involved in
immunity evolve rapidly and fail to be detected by automated gene annotation pipelines.
Description: We have developed a database of immune genes from the tammar wallaby, red-necked wallaby,
northern brown bandicoot, brush-tail possum, opossum, echidna and platypus. The resource contains 2,235 newly
identified sequences and 3,197 sequences which had been described previously. This comprehensive dataset was
built from a variety of sources, including EST projects and expert-curated gene predictions generated through a
variety of methods including chained-BLAST and sensitive HMMER searches. To facilitate systems-based research
we have grouped sequences based on broad Gene Ontology categories as well as by specific functional immune
groups. Sequences can be extracted by keyword, gene name, protein domain and organism name. Users can also
search the database using BLAST.
Conclusion: The Immunome Database for Marsupials and Monotremes (IDMM) is a comprehensive database of all
known marsupial and monotreme immune genes. It provides a single point of reference for genomic and
transcriptomic datasets. Data from other marsupial and monotreme species will be added to the database as it
become available. This resource will be utilized by marsupial and monotreme immunologists as well as researchers
interested in the evolution of mammalian immunity.

Background
Recently, two marsupial genomes and one monotreme
genome have been sequenced: the grey short-tailed
opossum (Monodelphis domestica; 7× coverage) [1], the
tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii; 2×) (in prep.), and
the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus; 6×) [2]. Marsupial and monotreme lineages branched off approximately 148 My and 166 My ago from the lineage
leading to eutherian mammals [3]. They hold a unique
evolutionarily position providing a link to the reptilian
phase of our ancestry. Combined with their unusual biological traits, they are capable of providing important
insights to our understanding of mammalian biology
and evolution.

Genome sequencing has generated huge amounts of
genomic data. This has expedited the identification of
genes in these species. Despite the availability of genome
assemblies, only the most phylogenetically conserved
immune genes have been identified using automated
gene annotation pipelines. Genes involved in the
immune response are subject to intense selective pressure due to the need to overcome pathogenic challenges.
As a result, it is common for immune genes, particularly
those with immunomodulatory roles, to show very low
levels of sequence conservation between species [4,5].
This has lead to many key immune molecules being
missed by the Ensembl [6] and NCBI’s Gnomon http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov genome annotation platforms.
Less than a third of all opossum immune genes that
were annotated using specialized search strategies by
Wong et al. 2006 [7], Belov et al. 2006 [8] and Belov et
al. 2007 [9], were predicted by the Ensembl pipeline [6].

Aside from high levels of sequence divergence, many
immune gene families have also evolved through rapid
successions of gene loss and gain, resulting in a lack of
direct orthologs. Hence, these genes are difficult to
characterize through local pairwise similarity search
algorithms, such as BLAST [10], which use a single gene
sequence to query a database.
To overcome the lack of annotated sequence information for immune genes, targeted, manually-curated strategies were applied [7,9,11,12]. Identification of the most
highly divergent sequences required an intensive combination of strategies incorporating hidden Markov model
searches, exploitation of conserved syntenic regions,
sensitive local search algorithms and gene prediction
integrating extrinsic information [7,9,11,12]. Less divergent genes missed by Ensembl could be identified and
annotated using chained-BLAST searches [9].
Here, we present a database of curated marsupial
and monotreme immune sequences. We have included
novel predicted and expressed sequences as well as
previously annotated genes [7,9,11-45]. Examples of
gene groups represented in the database include chemokines, interleukins, Natural Killer (NK) receptors,
Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) antigens,
surface receptors, antimicrobial peptides. Annotations
derived from a transcriptomic analysis on a primary
lymphoid organ have also been included [46]. Many of
these genes (e.g. 209 expressed tammar genes) have
not been annotated by Ensembl and their sequences
are not curated by other public databases. The database consists of a simple interface, and features several
methods for users to query the sequences. On entry to
the database, sequences were further annotated to provide searchable functional information. Availability of a
comprehensive gene set assists large-scale projects
such as transcriptomic analysis and microarray studies.
Also, it facilitates the development of marsupial- and
monotreme-specific reagents allowing for detailed analyses of metatherian and prototherian immune
responses.

Construction and content
IDMM was implemented using the Python web framework Django (version 1.1) [47] with a SQLite3 (version
3.6.3) database [48]. Data can be easily updated by
approved managers through a simple web interface.
Once sequences are added, they are automatically
matched to HGNC names and GO terms through a
BLAST search. Amino acid sequences are additionally
searched against the Conserved Domain Database
(CDD) [49] to create protein domain annotations.
Sequences are stored in FASTA format and are identified by their sequence header description which includes
the gene name and species name.

Database content and data source

A total of 2,935 genes, 602 expressed (538 tammar wallaby, 24 opossum, 16 platypus, 11 echidna, 6 red-necked
wallaby, 4 brushtail possum and 3 bandicoot) and 2,333
predicted (1,639 opossum, 694 platypus), are currently
stored in the database. The database includes 1,985 published sequences. We have integrated data from various
published resources, which include expressed and predicted genes from opossum (1,663) [7-9,18,34,
35,38,39,43-45,50], tammar (37) [21-26,33,35-37,45],
brushtail possum (4) [18,20,27-29,40] echidna (11)
[14,17,19,30,32], bandicoot (3) [15], red-necked wallaby
(6) [42] and platypus (261) [11-14,16,18,19,31,41].
Manually annotated gene families include: major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leucocyte receptor complex (LRC), cytokine, defensin, cathelicidin, natural killer
complex (NKC) and Fc receptor genes. Both opossum
and platypus sequences were annotated using a curated
list of human immune genes from the IRIS database
[51]. For predicted genes, candidate gene regions were
first identified using either BLAST [10] or HMMER hidden Markov model [52] searches. Following this, best
hits were either concatenated into genes or used to predict a full gene model using a gene prediction program.
516 wallaby genes were annotated based on opossum
genes identified in Wong et al. 2006 [7] and Belov et al.
2007 [9]. Of these, at least 217 were not annotated by
Ensembl (version 58). Wallaby reads were derived from
the pyrosequencing of wallaby thymus transcriptomes
and annotated using the wallaby (v1.0) genome assembly
[46]. For each annotated wallaby gene there were often
multiple, overlapping reads; these were assembled and
included in the database (1,786 wallaby reads in total).
449 platypus gene sequences were obtained by concatenation of the highest-scoring IRIS BLAST hits against
the platypus genome assembly (v5.0) (Unpublished). Of
these, 366 genes were not annotated by Ensembl (version 58).
Sequence annotation

All reads were defined by their species name, a gene
symbol, the method of identification and sequence type
(nucleotide or amino acid). To facilitate the retrieval of
genes associated with specific immune roles, we categorized genes based on nine functional terms. These
include the broad categories of humoral and cellular
immunity and components of the innate (inflammation
and complement system) and adaptive (antigen processing and presenting and phagocytosis) immune
responses, as well as genes with regulatory functions
such as chemokines and transcription factors. To provide additional sequence-based and functional information, all sequences were automatically annotated upon
submission to the database. Automatic annotation was

performed by searching the human SWISS-PROT [53]
database at NCBI [54] with the submitted sequences
using the network BLAST client (netblast) [10]. This
resulted in the association of sequences with the official
human gene names [55], GO ontology terms [56], and,
for protein sequences, domain names. The accession of
the best hit from each BLAST search was retrieved and
matched to a list of pre-generated accession-specific
tags if the E-value was less than 1e-3. These tags were
linked to human gene names and gene ontology annotations using Entrez Gene data [57].

Utility and Discussion
User interface

Users can interrogate the database and retrieve gene
sequences through a variety of simple query tools. The
search interface spans three webpages. From the main
page, users can query the database through keyword,
organism name, human gene name, protein domain
name and by the method through which sequences
were obtained (Figure 1). A link exists to a GO term
browser where terms can be examined in a tree structure that supports the natural relationships between
GO terms (Figure 2). Finally, the BLAST program is
implemented for users to search against sequences in
the database.
Search by curated gene symbols

All gene names determined through annotation can be
browsed. All sequences have been annotated with a

gene name based on the human gene symbol, with the
exception of lineage-specific expansions, such as NKC
genes and MHC genes. Characterized species-specific
expansions (i.e. without human one-to-one orthologs)

Wong et al. BMC Immunology 2011, 12:48
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/12/48

are labelled using the gene family name followed by a
unique set of numeric identifiers.
Keyword search

A simple keyword search permits users to query the
database using any string of characters from any
description line in FASTA sequences, human gene
descriptions and GO names. All FASTA descriptions
contain the common name of the species from which
the sequences were derived. In addition to terms present
in the FASTA header description, users may also search
terms generated by automatic annotation which include
full gene name (in addition to HGNC symbol) and GO
terms. Only sequences of high similarity (E-value < 1e3) to human genes were automatically annotated. Two
keyword searches are available: one for exact but caseinsensitive match in sequence headers only and one
which matches all terms containing the keyword from
all associations, including, for example, GO descriptions.
Search by sequence identification method

Sequence retrieval via the initial sequence identification
method (e.g. BLAST) allows simple discrimination
between expressed and predicted genes. It is important
to note that while chained high scoring BLAST alignments may provide more sequence information, the predicted sequence may not be identical to the actual
transcribed sequence. We have also provided information on the identification method used on each
sequence label.
Search by HGNC gene symbols

To facilitate the retrieval of marsupial and monotreme
homologs to human genes, a list of human gene symbols
is available for browsing. We queried marsupial and
monotreme database sequences against all human proteins and linked the best hits based on the E-value. The
resultant annotations are, in effect, reciprocal best hits
of predicted genes. By comparison of gene symbols,
users can rapidly determine the accuracy of an ortholog
assignment. This strategy provides a measure of the
level of confidence in the assigned gene name.
Search by conserved protein domains

To facilitate rapid identification of gene family members,
users can search for sequences based on annotated protein functional units from the Conserved Domain Database (CDD). CDD names can be browsed by list and by
hyperlinks via ‘tag cloud’. Conserved domain annotations are only available for amino acid sequences.
Search based on GO terms

Users may interrogate biological and molecular functional processes and structural components through a

Page 4 of 6

GO browser (Figure 2). The browser follows the tree-like
hierarchy of GO data by linking general terms to specific
terms. The GO terms associated with monotreme and
marsupial sequences are inferred through sequence similarity to human Entrez gene annotations. For each term
the number of associated database sequences is located
after the GO name. By clicking on this number users can
extract all associated sequences. Note that Entrez GO
terms often miss higher level terms which will underestimate the number of genes in a category. Therefore, it is
advisable to browse through GO child terms.
Search through the BLAST interface

Users can direct BLAST queries against the sequence
database. Users can perform nucleotide, translated
nucleotide and protein searches. Results are presented
in standard BLAST text output format.
Sequence retrieval

With the exception of BLAST searches, sequences are
viewed through a standard retrieval interface. FASTA
headers uniquely identify each sequence. In addition to
the option of retrieving reads individually, users may
choose to retrieve all identified sequences at once. Users
can also fetch all associated annotations for each
sequence. An option to display amino acid or nucleotide
sequences is available.

Conclusion
Targeted search strategies for immune genes and gene
families have led to the annotation of previously unidentified marsupials and monotreme genes in the recent genome
assemblies of the opossum, tammar wallaby and platypus.
Genes involved in immunity are generally poorly annotated
in genome assemblies due to their high rate of sequence
divergence and gene duplications. This high sequence divergence of marsupial and monotreme immune genes also
renders them difficult to isolate with classical lab techniques. IDMM provides easy access to marsupial and monotreme immune sequences. It hosts a catalogue of novel and
integrated sets of published genes, searchable through a
simple-to-use and fast interface. The availably of these
sequences will facilitate the development of species-specific
immunological reagents, enabling accurate studies of
immune responses in these species. This database will be
useful for comparative studies of immunity.
