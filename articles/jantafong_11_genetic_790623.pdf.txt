Abstract
Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the major swine pathogen associated with Porcine circovirus associated disease
(PCVAD) including post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). Currently, there are 4 subtypes of PCV2
(PCV2a, b, c and d) and some epidemiological evidences demonstrated that virulence of PCV2 may relate to its
subtypes. Recently, PMWS was observed more frequently in swine farms in Thailand; however, the information
regarding to PCV2 subtype involved was limited. Therefore, this study was aimed to determine the association
between occurrence of PMWS and PCV2 subtypes as well as genetically characterize PCV2 in Thailand. PCV2 DNA
was isolated from faecal swabs and whole blood of piglets from PMWS-affected and -negative farms. The full
length ORF2 sequences were compared using multiple alignment. The results showed that PCV2 DNA was
detected more frequently in PMWS-affected farms. The nucleotide identities of the ORF2 from 9 PCV2 isolates
representing each PMWS-affected farm and one from the negative farm ranged from 92.4 to 99.5% suggesting that
there is some genetic variation of PCV2 in Thai swine. The 10 PCV2 isolates were classified into 2 clusters, in which
the 7 isolates from PMWS-positive farms were in PCV2b cluster 1 A/B. The remaining isolates were separated in the
new subtype called PCV2e. The results suggest the presence of new PCV2 subtypes in addition to PCV2a and
PCV2b in Asian swine population. However, correlation between subtypes and virulence of PCV2 infection is not
conclusive due to limited number of the PCV2 sequences from PMWS negative farms.
Findings
Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) is
a major disease of swine, caused by porcine circovirus type
2 (PCV2). The major clinical signs of PMWS are wasting,
paleness of the skin, enlargement of the lymph nodes,
respiratory distress, and occasional diarrhea as well as
icterus [1,2]. PCV2 has a significant impact on the pig
industry worldwide [3]. PCV2 is a small non-enveloped
DNA virus which contains a single-stranded circular genome of 1.7 kb [4,5]. The PCV2 genome has three major
open reading frames (ORFs), which encode replicationassociated proteins (ORF1) [6], viral capsid protein (ORF2)
[7], and apoptotic protein (ORF3) [8]. The ORF2 is an
essential determinant for the genetic typing of PCV2

isolates, since the capsid gene has more variability than
the other ORFs [9]. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated
two major subtypes of PCV2, which are PCV2a (Group2)
and PCV2b (Group 1). Each subtype was classified into
different clusters, 1A to 1C for the subtype PCV2b, and
2A to 2E for the subtype PCV2a [9]. Furthermore, a third
subtype (PCV2c), found only in the Danish pigs, was
described [10]. A novel subtype, PCV2d, which is dominant in Chinese pigs, was recently reported [11]. A number of studies suggested that PCV2b is more virulent than
PCV2a and predominant in PMWS-affected herds [12,13].
However, an experimental inoculation of pigs with PCV2a
and PCV2b demonstrated no divergence in the virulence
of both subtypes [14]. Thus, no association of the PCV2
subtype designations, the disease status, or the geographical distribution appears to be evident.
Since PMWS was first observed in Canada in 1991
[1], the prevalence of PCV2 and the occurrence of

PMWS have been worldwide reported [15-25]. The
first case of PMWS in 7 to 9 week-old pigs was
described in Thailand in 1998 [26]; however, a retrospective study suggested that the PCV2 infection had
been previously detected in 1993 [21]. Although the
infection has been widespread in Thailand since 1998,
genetic information of PCV2 is limited with only one
sequence (AY864814) deposited in the GenBank databases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to genetically characterize the PCV2 isolates from Thai swine
and to determine the prevalence of the PCV2 infection
in piglet from both positively and negatively PMWS
affected farms.

Based on a preliminary PCV2 survey with PCR, the prevalence of the PCV2 infection in Thailand was ~10%.
Thus, 14 PMWS-negative farms and 11 PMWS-affected
farms were included in this study. The farms were located
in the eastern (Chonburi province), north eastern (Buriram and Chiyaphum provinces), western (Ratchaburi province), and central (Lopburi, Nakhon Pathom, Saraburi,
and Supanburi provinces) parts of Thailand. Fourteen
PMWS-negative farms located in Chonburi, Lopburi, Saraburi, Suphanburi, Ratchaburi, Chaiyaphum, and Buriram
provinces, along with eleven PMWS-affected farms located
in Chonburi, Suphanburi, Ratchaburi, and Nakorn Pathom
provinces were selected (Figure 1). The pigs from the

PMWS affected farms were selected in accordance with the
following clinical presentations; (1) clinical signs characterized by wasting, paleness of the skin, and respiratory distress; (2) lymph node enlargement and (3) a > 5 to 10%
production loss in the nursery and fattening groups. In
addition, the sick pigs from these farms were submitted to
the Kasetsart University Diagnosis Laboratory at Faculty of
Veterinary Medicine, Kampaengsean Campus, for necropsy
before the commencement of the study. The PMWS negative farms were selected as to agree with the following characteristics: (1) farms absent of a PMWS history, (2) farms
absent of a clinical presentation of PMWS, and (3) farms
with production losses of less than 4%. The samples
were collected prior to the implementation of the PCV2vaccintion in Thailand. A total of 140 pigs were collected in
a period from July 2007 to March 2008. Whole blood and
faecal swabs were randomly collected from five to ten piglets at ages of 5-10 weeks from the PMWS-negative farms
(n = 70) and the PMWS-affected farms (n = 70). Whole
blood samples in Ca-EDTA tubes were centrifuged, and
the plasma was collected and subsequently frozen at -80°C

until used. The faecal swabs were stored in a virus transport
medium, vortexed and clarified by means of centrifugation
with subsequent storage of the supernatants at -80°C.
Total DNA was extracted from the plasma and the
suspension of faecal swabs with the application of a
Nucleospin® Blood kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) in
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The
isolated DNA was amplified by means of PCR with the
PCV2 specific primers [27]. Descriptive statistics, with
the employment of the NCSS 2007 program, were utilized to assess the overall data quality. Associations
between the percentages of the PCV2 positive in
PMWS-affected and PMWS-negative farms and the
manifestation of PCV2 DNA in faecal swabs as well as
in the whole blood samples were analyzed with the chisquare test. A P value of less than 0.05 was regarded as
statistically significant. A positive PCR sample was
selected from each farm for sequence analysis.
The results of the PCV2 DNA from faecal swabs and
whole blood samples detected with PCR are shown in
table 1. PCV2 was found in 52 of 140 pigs (37.14%)
from both farm categories. A percentage of 7.14 of all
faecal swabs collected form piglets form PMWS-negative
farms was determined, while those from PMWS-affected
farms attained 50%. The PCV2 DNA was not detected
in the whole blood samples from the PMWS-negative
farms, while 57.14% of pigs from the PMWS-affected
farms showed PCV2 viremia. PCV2 DNA detection in
the blood or faecal samples from the PMWS-affected
farms were found not to be significantly different (c2 =
3.83, P > 0.05). However, higher percentages of PCV2
were detected in either blood or faecal samples of pigs
from the PMWS-affected farms (67.14%), in comparison

Figure 2 Phylogenetic analysis of the complete ORF2 sequence of the PCV2 isolates in this study. The tree was constructed from the 82
ORF2 sequences deposited in GenBank and 10 Thai isolates in the present study with the application of the MEGA 4 program. The ORF2 of
PCV1 was used as an out-group. Note that clusters 1 A/B and C indicate the previous classification [9].

to those from the non-PMWS farms (7.14%). The PCV2
DNA in both specimens was found in 27 samples; all of
which were obtained from the PMWS-positive farms.
Furthermore, the appearance of the PCV2 DNA in the
PMWS-affected farms in Thailand is age-dependent.
The PCV2-positive ratios found in 5, 6, and 8-10 weekold piglets were 43.3 (n = 30), 80 (n = 25), and 100%
(n = 15; 5 pigs from each age group), respectively. Overall, the detection of the PCV2 DNA was significantly
related to the PMWS (c2 = 53.96, P < 0.01). These findings are in agreement with the recent studies as well as
previous field observations [28,29].
In addition, the full length of the ORF2 of PCV2 was
amplified with the PCV2-ORF2 specific primers [7,30].
The PCR products were submitted for sequencing. The
10 ORF2 sequences (nine from PMWS-affected pigs and
one from a negative pig) from the present study and 82
ORF2 sequences from GenBank were analyzed with the
application of the ClustalW method provided in the
DNASTAR software. The ORF2 gene sequence of PCV1
(AY699796) was used as the out-group. The phylogenetic tree was built by means of the neighbour-joining
(NJ) method in MEGA 4 program with 1000 bootstrap
replicates.
The results demonstrated the nucleotide identities of
those 10 isolates to range between 92.4-99.5% (Table 2).
A PCV2 isolate from a PMWS-negative farm and two
PCV2 isolates from PMWS-affected farms shared 99.199.5% nucleotide identities, which suggests an absence
of any significant divergences in the PCV2 subtype from
PMWS-affected and -negative farms [31-33]. Nucleotides 262-267 and amino acids 88-89 of ORF2 were
compared and classified as previously described [34], in
which the consensus “CCCCGC”, “CCCCTC”, and
“AAAATC” are the signatures for the PCV2b cluster
1A/1B, 1C, and PCV2a, respectively. The multiple alignment of the ORF2 gene revealed that all 10 PCV2 isolates contain the PCV2b signature (Table 2). The three
PCV2 isolates, THKUF49, THKUL16, and THKUB98
have a cluster 1C signature, while the other seven PCV2
isolates from the PMWS-affected farms possess a cluster
1A/B signature.
The phylogenetic tree revealed that the sequences
were segregated into five major subtypes, PCV2a,
PCV2b, PCV2c, PCV2d, and a new Thai subtype
referred to as PCV2e (Figure 2). In comparison to a previous study [9], the PCV2b group in figure 2 is formerly
classified as PCV2b (group1) cluster 1A/B, while those
in PCV2d and PCV2e groups were previously classified
as PCV2b cluster 1C. In the present study, the seven
PCV2 isolates from the PMWS-affected farms were classified in PCV2b (cluster 1A/B). The other three isolates
(THKUB98, THKUL16, and THKUF49) with the cluster

Page 5 of 6

1C signature are more distant and form a new cluster
together with the former Thai isolate (AY864814) and a
Chinese isolate (AY035820) (Figure 2). The sequence
distances between ORF2 of the later cluster and those
in the other clusters were found to exceed 3.5%, which
qualifies for the characterization of a new subtype [12]
referred to as PCV2e, in keeping with the recently determined new Chinese subtype PCV2d [11]. The Chinese
PCV2 (AY035820) isolated in 2001 from PMWS pig in
eastern China and the Thai isolates (AY864814)
reported in 2004 coincidentally appear to possess the
PCV2b cluster 1C signature. The Chinese PCV2 is
therefore potentially the ancestor of the Thai PCV2
found in 2004, which in turn was the origin of the three
2007 PCV2 isolated in the present study.
In conclusion, the present study constitutes the first
genetic analysis of the Thai PCV2 isolates, which
determines the correlation of the occurrence of PMWS
and the PCV2 subtypes in the Thailand. This study
also demonstrated that PCV2 infection associates with
the occurrence of PMWS. In addition, the circulation
of the PCV2 strains appears to be currently increasing
in the Thai swine population. Two subtypes, PCV2e
and PCV2b (1A/B), are at present existent in the Thai
swine population, where PCV2b appears to be dominant. Phylogenetic analysis of the recent PCV2 strains
from the present study has confirmed the existence of
more PCV2 subtypes in addition to PCV2a and
PCV2b. As new genetic clusters of PCV2 have continually emerged, the classification of the PCV2 subtypes
and clusters needs to be reconsidered by the PCV2
taxonomists as to set standard criteria for the PCV2
genetic characterization.
