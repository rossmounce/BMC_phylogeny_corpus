Abstract
Background: Influenza has been associated with a heavy burden of mortality. In tropical or
subtropical regions where influenza viruses circulate in the community most of the year, it is
possible that there are seasonal variations in the effects of influenza on mortality, because of
periodic changes in environment and host factors as well as the frequent emergence of new
antigenically drifted virus strains. In this paper we explored this seasonal effect of influenza.
Methods: A time-varying coefficient Poisson regression model was fitted to the weekly numbers
of mortality of Hong Kong from 1996 to 2002. Excess risks associated with influenza were
calculated to assess the seasonal effects of influenza.
Results: We demonstrated that the effects of influenza were higher in winter and late spring/early
summer than other seasons. The two-peak pattern of seasonal effects of influenza was found for
cardio-respiratory disease and sub-categories pneumonia and influenza, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular diseases and ischemic heart disease as well as for all-cause
deaths.
Conclusion: The results provide insight into the possibility that seasonal factors may have impact
on virulence of influenza besides their effects on virus transmission. The results warrant further
studies into the mechanisms behind the seasonal effect of influenza.

Background
The impact of influenza on mortality has been well established in the temperate regions, but only recently has such
impact been documented in tropical and subtropical
regions [1,2]. Unlike in the cool temperate regions where
influenza activity shows a distinctive seasonality with a
well-defined influenza epidemic occurring almost every
winter [3], in the warm tropics and subtropics seasonal

patterns of virus activity are more diffuse, sometimes
showing two influenza epidemics annually but with influenza viruses being isolated throughout the year [4].
Although influenza can be active in most time of the year,
the upsurge of influenza viruses is not always followed by
increased mortality [1]. We hypothesize that there are
temporal variations in the effects of influenza on mortalPage 1 of 9

ity. Such temporal variations are likely to exhibit a seasonal pattern because of seasonal variations in virus
virulence and host susceptibility. Virulence of virus strains
could be regulated through interaction between herd
immunity, introduction of naïve individuals, and ability
of virus to shed and to generate new strains [5]. The frequent genetic drift introduces novel virus strains to the
population, which could pose a great threat at the beginning of circulation due to a lack of herd immunity [6].
Although impossible to predict when genetic drift occurs,
such drift could result in temporal changes in virulence of
circulating strains. Moreover, the environmental factors
that favor transmission of influenza, such as low temperature and low humidity, appear in some seasons. It has
also been proposed that seasonal fluctuations in host
immunity may periodically change host susceptibility to
influenza infections [7]. However, to our knowledge, all
models assessing disease burdens of influenza assumed
constant effects of influenza over the study period [1,2,8]
and no studies have investigated the seasonal effects of
influenza on mortality.

ics around the Hong Kong Island, to test for six respiratory
viruses including influenza virus (types A and B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus and parainfluenza
(PIV, types PIV-1, PIV-2 and PIV-3) [10]. We used the
weekly proportions of specimens tested positive for each
virus, to represent their activities in Hong Kong population. The QMH data are part of the sentinel surveillance
implemented by the Government Virus Unit in the
Department of Health (DH) which covers the entire territory of Hong Kong, but the DH data are only available
after 1998 and specimens are tested only for influenza
viruses. In fact the specimens from QMH account for
around 40% of total specimens in DH surveillance and
the weekly proportions of specimens positive for influenza from QMH and DH are highly correlated (Spearman
coefficient 0.8, for data during 1998–2002). Given the
homogeneity of Hong Kong population, we therefore
believe that the data from the QMH could represent the
virus activity in the entire Hong Kong. Meteorological
data were obtained from the Hong Kong Observatory
[11].

Hong Kong has a typical subtropical climate with well
separated four seasons, and the average temperature is
about 24°C. In this study we applied a time-varying coefficient Poisson regression model to the weekly counts of
deaths, using the laboratory virology surveillance data in
Hong Kong to explore the seasonal effects of influenza on
mortality. Our findings suggest that influenza has significant seasonal effects in terms of influenza-associated mortality from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.

Statistical modeling
For each disease category, we applied a semi-parametric
Poisson regression method under the framework of generalized additive model (GAM) [12], to the weekly numbers
of mortality. We first built the core model:

Methods
Data
We obtained weekly numbers of mortality during the
period of 1996 to 2002 from the Hong Kong Census and
Statistics Department, for five underlying causes of death:
all-cause (excluding accidental deaths), cardiovascular
and respiratory diseases (CRD) (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] codes 390–519
and Tenth Revision [ICD-10] codes I00-I99, J00-J98), and
sub-categories pneumonia and influenza (P&I) (ICD-9
codes 480–487; ICD-10 codes J10-J18), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (ICD-9 codes 490–496;
ICD-10 codes J40-J47), cerebrovascular diseases (ICD-9
430–438; ICD-10 codes I60-I69) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) (ICD-9 codes 410–414; ICD-10 codes I20I25). We did not adjust for a potential shift in disease
counts due to the switch of coding system from the ICD-9
to ICD-10 since this shift was estimated to be small [9].

We obtained the virology surveillance data from the
microbiology laboratory of Queen Mary Hospital
(QMH). This laboratory routinely collects specimens
from outpatients and inpatients in the hospitals and clin-

log(μ t ) = NS(t , df ) + NS(temp, df ) + NS(humd , df )
(1)
Here μt is denoted as the expected number of mortality at
week t. The seasonality of mortality, temperature and
humidity were adjusted for as confounders in the core
model, defined by natural spline smoothing functions
(NS) of consecutive week numbers t, weekly arithmetic
means of temperature (temp) and relative humidity
(humd) at week t, respectively. The choice of degrees of
freedom (df) for each smoothing function was based on
the adequacy of the core model judged by the criteria that
the partial autocorrelation function plots of the residuals
are with +/- 0.1 and do not exhibit any discernible patterns as described in a previous study [10]. Over-dispersion was adjusted for by a quasi-likelihood estimation
method [13].
The weekly proportions of specimens positive for influenza viruses were then entered into the core model, along
with the proportions of RSV, adenovirus, PIV-1, PIV-2 and
PIV-3 at the current week, to calculate the effects of influenza with adjustment for co-circulation of other respiratory viruses. A typical form of this main effect model is
log(μ t ) = β flu t −l + RSV + adenovirus + PIV + NS(t , df ) + NS(temp, df ) + NS(humd , df )

where flut-l is the proportion of specimen positive for
influenza A and B at the lag l week (l = 0, 1, 2, 3) of week
t. For the subsequent analyses we used the best lag week,
which had the smallest p-value for coefficients β among
the four models of different lag weeks for each outcome.

multiplying them with 12.3%, and subsequently deducting by one.

To evaluate the seasonal effects of influenza, we applied
two different methods. The first method is time-varying
coefficient Poisson model [14]. As influenza activity tends
to reach two peaks a year in Hong Kong [10], we decided
to add two pairs of sinusoidal terms to capture these two
peaks, as shown below:

log( μ t ) = [β 0 +

Similarly, the excess risk for each season was derived from
γ coefficients of interaction model (equation 4). Weekly
influenza-associated excess risks represent the increase of
risk for influenza associated deaths when the influenza
proportions increase from zero to 12.3%. To compare
with previous studies, we also calculated the influenza
associated excess mortality, which was defined as the difference between observed numbers of deaths and baseline
deaths in the absence of virus activity [1].

(3)
Here k = 1 is to model the annual pattern of seasonal
effects and k = 2 to capture the semiannual pattern. In
order to assess whether there is a seasonal effect of influenza, we performed a likelihood ratio test by calculating
the difference of statistical deviance between the time-varying coefficient Poisson model (equation 3) and the main
effect model (equation 2) [12]. To further justify our selection of Poisson model with two pairs of sinusoidal terms,
we also used likelihood ratio tests to compare two-cycle
model (two pairs of sinusoidal terms, k = 1, 2 in equation
3) with one-cycle model (one pair, k = 1 in equation 3).
The second method is to estimate effects of influenza in
four seasons respectively, using the conventional interaction model. We added into the core model (equation 1)
the interaction terms between influenza and seasons,
which were defined by products of flut-l with each of three
season dummy variables. The season dummy variables
were defined as follows: week 9–21 as spring, week 22–34
as summer, week 35–47 as autumn and week 48-week 8
as winter. This definition follows the Hong Kong Observatory's definitions of four seasons as March–May, June–
August, September–November and December–February
[15]. The general form of interaction model is
log( μ t ) = ( γ 1 + γ 2I winter + γ 3I spring + γ 4I summer )flu t −l
+ RSV + adenovirus + PIV + NS(t,df) + NS(temp,df) + NS(humd,df)

(4)
Iwinter was set to 1 for winter and 0 for otherwise, and similar definitions were applied for Ispring and Isummer.
We then calculated weekly influenza-associated excess
risks (ER) per inter-quartile range (IQR) increase of influenza isolation proportions (12.3% in our data) as a measurement for the seasonal effects of influenza on mortality,
by taking anti-logarithm transformation of sum of coeffi-

We performed three sensitivity analyses. We adjusted for
potential confounding of temperature by adding the lag 1
difference of weekly geometric mean, where lag 1 difference was defined as current week minus previous week,
into the core model (equation 1). We also tested the lag
effects on the seasonal effects of influenza, by replacing
the proportions of influenza isolates at the best lag week
by those at four different lag weeks (up to three weeks). To
exclude the possibility that seasonal effects of influenza
were caused by the inadequate adjustment for co-circulation of RSV, we performed the third sensitivity analysis
with additional variables for interaction between two
pairs of harmonic terms and proportions of RSV positive
isolates. We used the statistical package R for all the analyses [16].

Results
Weekly average temperature, relative humidity and proportions of specimens positive for respiratory viruses are
summarized in Table 1. On average, proportions of positive isolates for influenza viruses were lowest in autumn,
but at a similar level in other seasons. More RSV viruses
were isolated in spring and summer, and more PIV-1 in
autumn and winter. Adenovirus, PIV-2 and PIV-3 did not
exhibit any discernible seasonal difference. More deaths
were recorded in winter for all the disease categories.
The likelihood ratio tests, which compared the two-cycle
with the one-cycle Poisson models, showed that the twocycle models better captured the seasonal effects of influenza, with the only exception of mortality with underlying cause of pneumonia and influenza. However the onecycle model also did not fit this disease category, suggesting that the effects of influenza on pneumonia and influenza mortality are unlikely to have any seasonal patterns
(data not shown).

The seasonal effects of influenza were measured by variations in weekly influenza-associated excess risks per IQR
increase of influenza virus activity. For all-cause mortality
in the all-ages group, the seasonal effects showed an evident two-peak pattern, with the first in winter (around
week 1) and the second in late spring or early summer
(around week 22) (Figure 1). The excess mortality, in a
standardized z-scores which were averaged over the seven
years of study period, was higher in winter and had a pattern similar to virus activity but different from seasonal
effects of influenza (Figure 1).
The two-peak pattern of seasonal effects of influenza was
found for all the disease categories in the all-ages group
(Figure 2). Particularly, for COPD, the seasonal effects of
influenza were characterized with a sharp winter peak;
whereas for cerebrovascular diseases the spring/summer
peak was more evident. Similar patterns for the seasonal
effects of influenza were observed in the elderly group,
with slight changes in magnitudes (see Additional file 1).
The seasonal effects of influenza on mortality were statis-

tically significant (p < 0.05) for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, COPD, cerebrovascular diseases, ischemic
heart diseases as well as all-cause, in both 65+ and all-ages
groups. But there was little evidence that the seasonal
effects of influenza on mortality for pneumonia and influenza also had a two-peak pattern, although the total
effects of influenza were highly significant (Table 2).
Consistent with the results from the seasonal effect models, the influenza effects in four seasons estimated from
the interaction models (measured by influenza-associated
excess risks in each season) were found lowest and not significant in autumn for all the age-disease categories (Table
2). The influenza effects on mortality in four seasons were
estimated to be higher in both winter and spring for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, ischemic heart diseases and all-cause, whereas the influenza effects was the
highest in winter for COPD, in spring for cerebrovascular
diseases and in summer for pneumonia and influenza,
respectively.

Seasonal1patterns of excess risks, excess mortality associated
Seasonal patterns of excess risks, excess mortality
associated with influenza and proportions of influenza isolates. Excess risks (thick line) associated with per
IQR increase of influenza virus activity for all-cause mortality
in the all-ages group were calculated after controlling for
influenza virus seasonality. Weekly excess all-cause mortality
is plotted in broken line and proportions of influenza are
shown in bar. Weekly excess mortality and proportions of
influenza isolates were Z-score standardized by each year
and then averaged over seven years.

In overall, the ER for all-cause mortality associated with
per IQR increase in proportions of influenza positive specimens was 3.5% (95% CI, 2.4–4.6%) in the all-ages group
and 4.3% (95% CI, 3.0–5.6%) in the 65+ age group.
When proportions of positive specimens increased
12.3%, the risks of death were 6.5%, 4.2%, 14.9%, 6.3%
and 6.0% higher for cardiorespiratory diseases, pneumonia and influenza, COPD, cerebrovascular diseases and
ischemic heart diseases, respectively.
The sensitivity analysis replacing the arithmetic mean of
temperature by the lag 1 difference of its weekly geometric
mean (i.e. mean of current week minus that of last week)
did not significantly change the patterns of seasonal
effects of influenza for all disease categories (See Additional file 2). The two-peak patterns of seasonal effects of
influenza were robust to different lag weeks, but slightly
varying in magnitude and timing of peaks (See Additional
file 3). Adjustment for seasonal effects of RSV in mortality
models slightly changed the magnitudes of influenza
effects, but in overall did not alter the two-peak patterns
(See Additional file 4).

This study for the first time demonstrated that the effects
of influenza on mortality have a seasonal pattern. We
adopted influenza associated excess risk as a measurement
for the seasonal effects of influenza, which allows us to
evaluate the changes in mortality risks attributable to
influenza around the year independent of the seasonal
variations of virus activity. Seasonal effects of influenza in
this study are not equivalent to influenza associated excess
mortality, which has been widely used to measure the disease burden of influenza [17]. Influenza associated excess
mortality is determined not only by the effects of influenza, but also by the levels of virus activity. The excess risk
is also different from the virus activity: the former measure
the severity of diseases given influenza infections, but the
latter probability of infections. The virus activity is controlled by transmission efficiency of viruses as well as by
the herd immunity, but the probability to develop into a
severe disease is more likely affected by the pathogenicity
of viruses and individual immunity levels against respiratory pathogens including influenza virus and pneumococcus bacteria, the latter of which often cause secondary
pneumonia. This study also provides a valid and simple
modeling strategy with proper adjustment for confounding of environmental factors and co-circulation of other
respiratory viruses, which can be applied to other regions.
We found that the effects of influenza on mortality exhibit
a similar two-peak pattern as the virus activity. The spread
of influenza increases the mortality risks of cardio-respiratory diseases to a greater extent in winter and late spring/
summer than the rest of year. This pattern is probably the
result of interaction between host susceptibility and environmental factors such as temperature. Both cold and hot
weather have been linked to increased cardio-respiratory
mortality in numerous studies [18-20]. It has been proposed that cold air could cool the upper respiratory tract
epithelium and thereby slow down mucociliary clearance
[21]. Exposure to low and high temperature can both
increase blood viscosity and trigger cardiovascular events
[22]. Influenza infections have similar prothromobotic
and proinflammatory effects [23]. Numerous studies in
the temperate regions showed that exacerbations of
COPD frequently occur in cold temperature when influenza viruses tend to be active, as a result of stimulated airway inflammation [24,25]. Similar to the seasonal effects
of influenza, the mortality counts of all-cause deaths also
exhibited a two-peak pattern. Usually one big winter spike
usually appearing weeks after when the lowest temperature was recorded and a small spike also appeared soon
after the week when the highest temperature recorded in
summer (data not shown). The least death numbers
recorded in autumn. This mortality seasonality was also
reported in other subtropical cities [22]. Furthermore, a
multicity study in the United States demonstrated that the

‡ p value of likelihood ratio tests, indicating significance of seasonal variation

temperate effects on mortality exhibited a U-shape pattern
with a turning point around 26°C for the southern cities
[26]. Similarly, influenza viruses tend to be active in winter and early summer. Overlapping in timing of peaks
between influenza activity and the temperature effects on
mortality, plus the similar biological effects of viruses and
extreme temperate, suggest that the synergistic interaction
between influenza and temperature is highly plausible.
Host immunity could also follow a seasonal variation,
although studies for seasonal changes of human resistance to influenza remain controversial [7]. Some reports
suggest that the immune defenses are elevated during
summer and weakened during winter, whereas others
drew the opposite conclusion. This discrepancy likely
originated from different sampled subjects (patients or
healthy subjects) and unmeasured confounding factors
such as perception of stress [27]. It has been suggested that
photo-period and levels of melatonin and vitamin D play
an important role in regulating the seasonal rhythm of
human immunity, but again evidence is rather limited [9].
More research is needed in order to fully understand the
seasonal fluctuation of influenza effects on health.

According to our results, the peaks of seasonal effects of
influenza on mortality appear to precede those of virus
activity by weeks (Figure 1). Interestingly, we found the
consultation rates of influenza-like illness in private doctors also preceded virus activity by an average of four
weeks [28]. This coincidence may suggest that the virulence of influenza viruses probably reaches its peak at the
beginning of an outbreak and may diminish later, as the
population gradually gains the herd immunity against
novel strains. The virulence of influenza is determined by
both the host and virus [29]. In the beginning of their
emergence, the new virus strains introduced by frequent
antigenic drifts could replicate more efficiently in the
immunologically naïve host and as a result impose a more
serious threat on the community health [30]. We proposed that the seasonal changes of influenza virulence
might reflect the frequent antigenic shifts of viruses within
an influenza epidemic season. Several large-scale phylogenetic studies could not find evidence of local evolution of
virus strains in the temperate regions and proposed that
the subtropics and tropics, especially East and Southeast
Asia, are more likely the virus reservoirs where the reassortment of co-circulating lineages could occur to result in

emerging novel virus strains that later spread to the temperate regions [31-33]. The better understanding to the
mechanisms of influenza virus evolution must base on
the more comprehensive surveillance networks in the
tropics and subtropics.
As H3N2 is believed to cause more mortality and to
spread more efficiently than H1N1 and B [34,35], we
hypothesize that seasonal effects of influenza could be a
result of different subtypes dominating over different seasons. Because the virus subtype data during the study
period are not available from QMH, we obtained from the
Government Virus Unit of the Department of Health in
Hong Kong the weekly proportions of specimens positive
for influenza H3N2, H1N1 and B from 1998 to 2002.
Overall, the proportions of H3N2 isolates in all influenza
virus positive isolates show a similar two-peak pattern to
the seasonal variation of influenza effects from winter to
summer, with a higher peak in summer than in winter
(See Additional file 5). We then applied the time-varying
coefficient Poisson model to the weekly death numbers
from 1998 to 2002 when the subtype data were available

in Hong Kong, with the variables for weekly proportions
of subtype H3N2 and for the product of two sinusoidal
pairs and H3N2 proportions added into the model to
measure the seasonal effects of H3N2. The proportions of
H1N1 and type B were also entered into the model. The
results suggested that H3N2 contributed to the majority of
seasonal effects of influenza, as the excess risks associated
with H3N2 showed similar patterns as those associated
with the combined proportions of three types/subtypes of
influenza viruses (data not shown). We repeated the
above analyses separately for H1N1 and type B viruses
and found that none of them has significant seasonal variations. However, the lack of seasonal effects in H1N1 and
B could be the result of mild activities of these two types/
subtypes during our study period. Nevertheless, we could
not rule out that changing dominance of different virus
subtypes could also contribute to seasonal effects of influenza.
The seasonal effects are significant for chronic conditions
but not for the mortality of pneumonia and influenza
which is considered as the most specific endpoint of influ-

enza infection [1,10]. We think this could be due to the
fact that we used the underlying cause of death, which
probably results in underreporting of pneumonia and
influenza cases and subsequently underestimating of
influenza associated pneumonia and influenza mortality.
The effects of influenza on chronic conditions, especially
COPD, decrease promptly after reaching the peaks,
thereby exhibiting more pronounced seasonal variations
than the seasonal effects on pneumonia and influenza.
We speculate that there is probably a "harvesting" effect
for influenza associated mortality [36]. The vulnerable
people, who had been suffering from chronic diseases,
would die soon after infection and their causes of deaths
would likely be recorded as their preexisting conditions.
At the beginning of an epidemic, influenza infections
probably claim the most vulnerable people to empty the
susceptibility pool, leading to a subsequent decline in the
influenza effects. Such a temporal change in the susceptibility pool may not be evident for those who had been
previously healthy and were grouped as pneumonia and
influenza deaths.
There are several caveats in our study. Similar to our previous studies for health burden of influenza, we adopted
the best lag week, which offered the most significant association between influenza activity and mortality outcome.
Sensitivity analyses of different lag weeks showed that
although magnitudes of peaks are somehow sensitive to
the lag weeks, the two-peak pattern of seasonal effects of
influenza is relatively robust to the changes of lag weeks.
We did not take account of the potential shift in mortality
counts between year 2000 and 2001 caused by switch of
ICD-9 to ICD-10, however this shift may be small and
only affect the temporal variations of mortality data during a short period. In addition, we must be cautious to
apply our findings to other tropical and subtropical
regions, because unlike most of other tropical and subtropical regions, Hong Kong is a highly developed and
compact urban area. Nevertheless, future studies in the
temperate and developing tropical and subtropical
regions may help us better understand the mechanisms
behind the seasonal effects of influenza.

Conclusion
In summary, this study demonstrated that the effects of
influenza on mortality show a seasonal pattern. The seasonal variation in influenza effects on mortality could
provide strong evidence for the need of refining influenza
control policy and promoting public awareness to outbreaks of influenza both in the warm and cold seasons.
