Abstract
Background: Cattle and other ruminants have evolved the ability to derive most of their
metabolic energy requirement from otherwise indigestible plant matter through a symbiotic
relationship with plant fibre degrading microbes within a specialised fermentation chamber, the
rumen. The genetic changes underlying the evolution of the ruminant lifestyle are poorly
understood. The BPI-like locus encodes several putative innate immune proteins, expressed
predominantly in the oral cavity and airways, which are structurally related to Bactericidal/
Permeability Increasing protein (BPI). We have previously reported the expression of variant BPIlike proteins in cattle (Biochim Biophys Acta 2002, 1579, 92–100). Characterisation of the BPI-like
locus in cattle would lead to a better understanding of the role of the BPI-like proteins in cattle
physiology
Results: We have sequenced and characterised a 722 kbp segment of BTA13 containing the bovine
BPI-like protein locus. Nine of the 13 contiguous BPI-like genes in the locus in cattle are
orthologous to genes in the human and mouse locus, and are thought to play a role in host defence.
Phylogenetic analysis indicates the remaining four genes, which we have named BSP30A, BSP30B,
BSP30C and BSP30D, appear to have arisen in cattle through a series of duplications. The
transcripts of the four BSP30 genes are most abundant in tissues associated with the oral cavity and
airways. BSP30C transcripts are also found in the abomasum. This, as well as the ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous differences between pairs of the BSP30 genes, is consistent with at
least BSP30C having acquired a distinct function from the other BSP30 proteins and from its paralog
in human and mouse, parotid secretory protein (PSP).
Conclusion: The BPI-like locus in mammals appears to have evolved rapidly through multiple gene
duplication events, and is thus a hot spot for genome evolution. It is possible that BSP30 gene
duplication is a characteristic feature of ruminants and that the BSP30 proteins contribute to an
aspect of ruminant-specific physiology.

Background
Ruminants have acquired a number of physiological and
anatomical specialisations in order to adapt to a lifestyle
in which pasture is the predominant source of metabolic
energy. Most notably ruminants have a fore-stomach, the
rumen, in which pasture polysaccharides are broken
down by microbial β-glycosidases in a neutral pH anaerobic environment. In addition, ruminants have other adaptations, including a markedly different saliva composition
compared with monogastric mammals [1,2]. It is assumed
that these physiological adaptations must be accompanied by genetic changes, however, there have been few
reports of changes in the genomes of ruminants, which
facilitate a specialised ruminant physiological function.
Virtually the only such report is of the expansion of the
lysozyme locus in cattle [3]. The recent availability of a
draft cattle genome sequence, the first for a ruminant, provides an opportunity to discover additional genetic characteristics that facilitate the ruminant lifestyle.
The Bactericidal/Permeability Increasing protein (BPI)
plays an important role in host-defence in mammals. BPI
is found in the secretory granules of neutrophils and is
secreted in response to activation of Toll-like receptor
(TLR)-mediated signalling, whereupon it acts as an innate
immune effector protein by permeabilising the plasma
membrane of Gram negative bacteria as well as attenuating the TLR response [4,5]. Three well-characterised proteins have some sequence conservation with BPI.
Lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) is secreted
from the liver into the circulation where it appears to act
as a sensor for the presence of bacteria [6]. LBP acts as an
opsin, binding lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from the
outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria, and thence
stimulating a TLR-mediated innate immune response [7].
Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) and cholesteryl
ester transfer protein (CETP) function as lipid transport
proteins in the blood (reviewed in [8,9]). Recent reports
have shown the existence of at least 10 additional genes in
humans and mice, which are related to BPI through
sequence similarity, exon segmentation and predicted secondary structure [10,11]. All but two of these are found as
a gene cluster at a single locus on human chromosome 20
or the syntenic region of mouse chromosome 2. The similarity of the products of these genes to BPI and LBP, their
expression in oral cavity and airways tissues [12-16] and
evidence for the antimicrobial activity of at least one of
them [17] suggests that they play a role in host defence.
We have previously characterised two closely related
members of the expanded BPI-like protein family in cattle. These proteins, BSP30A and BSP30B, are expressed in
saliva and are both most closely related to human and
mouse PSP [18-20]. We have now characterised the entire
BPI-like protein locus in cattle in order to understand the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/75

relationship of the BSP30A and BSP30B genes to one
another and to PSP, and to understand the evolutionary
events that have occurred in the locus in cattle, particularly gene duplication. Here we report that the bovine
locus contains 13 BPI-like genes, comprising nine homologues of BPI-like genes from mouse and human as well
as four paralogues of PSP, two of which have not been previously described. These appear to have arisen from a
series of gene duplication events. Their distinct patterns of
transcript abundance, and their presence in at least some
other ruminant species is consistent with the multiple
BSP30 genes having a specific role in ruminant physiology.

Results
Characterisation of the bovine BPI-like locus
Six bovine BACs spanning the BPI-like locus were identified by alignment of bovine BAC end sequences with the
region of the human genome sequence containing the
BPI-like locus. These BACs were subjected to random
shotgun high throughput sequencing. These sequences, as
well as sequence contigs from the bovine assembly (BosTau 2.0, current at the time study was undertaken) were
used to create a single 721,869 bp contig as described in
the Methods [GenBank: DQ667137].

To identify the genes within the bovine genomic contig,
sequences from human and bovine RefSeq, and TIGR
bovine Gene Indices, along with the known bovine BPIlike gene sequences from GenBank and Ensembl bovine
gene predictions, were mapped onto the contig using the
GMAP and Exonerate programs. In total, 21 putative
genes or pseudogenes were identified. Of these, 14 contiguous genes spanning 470 kbp appeared to be related to
members of the BPI-like family (listed in Table 1). The
gene order obtained resembled that of the previously
characterised human and mouse BPI-like loci [14,21]
much more closely than that of the BosTau v2.0 assembly
(Figure 1), due to assembly errors in the ver 2.0 of the
bovine assembly. Among the 14 genes, only BSP30A,
BSP30B, PLUNC and VEMSGP have been previously
described and characterised in cattle [19,20]. For two of
the genes (BSP30C and SPLUNC3), cDNA sequence was
obtained by sequencing of individual cDNA clones and
extension using 5' and 3' RACE. After re-sequencing, a correction was made to the previously determined BSP30A
sequence (GenBank accession number U79413). For one
of the genes (BPIL1) the Ensembl bovine gene prediction
was found to be the putative cDNA sequence that better
matched homologues in other species. For three of the
genes (BPIL3, RYA3 and RY2G5) a better match to other
species was obtained by combining the Ensembl and RefSeq predicted sequences. For two other genes (BASE and
LPLUNC5) the final cDNA sequences were produced by
the Genscan gene prediction program. These sequences

(see Additional file 1 for details) were aligned with the
genomic contig using the Spidey program [22] to determine the position, number and size of the exons (Table
1).
Alignment of the bovine BPI-like predicted amino acid
sequences revealed significant similarity with the known
BPI-like genes from human and mouse. Nine of the 14
bovine BPI-like genes were orthologous to genes in these
species as they formed reciprocal pairs of top BLAST hits
between species (see Table 1 for % amino acid identities).
The remaining five are most similar to PSP from mouse
and human, for which there is no unambiguous ortholog
in bovine (see Table 2 for % amino acid identities). Two
of these have been previously described as BSP30A and
BSP30B [19]. We therefore named the two additional

apparently complete genes BSP30C and BSP30D. The
fifth, (bovine RefSeq entry XM_595323) is substantially
truncated compared with other BPI-like genes. It contains
an open reading frame containing 121 amino acids
encoding a 13 kDa protein and comprising three exons of
113, 145 and 104 nucleotides in length, and has no TATA
box or CpG islands associated with it. Therefore, it is most
likely a pseudogene. All 13 intact bovine BPI-like genes
conform to the expected structure of BPI-like proteins,
having a predicted mass of either approximately 27 kDa
or 53 kDa, having either 6–9 or 15–17 exons, and having
either one or two BPI domains. These predicted amino
acid sequences include a secretion signal sequence of 20
amino acids at the N-terminus. The subset of BPI-like proteins of approximately 27 kDa having one BPI domain
have been referred to as SPLUNC1-4 and the approxi477F3

mately 53 kDa proteins with two BPI domains as
LPLUNC1-5 [21]. Two conserved cysteines that have been
shown to form a disulphide bond between amino acid
135 and 175 of human BPI [23] are present in all the
bovine BPI-like proteins, and are separated by 35–46
amino acid. The bovine BASE and LPLUNC5 genes, which
appear to be pseudogenes in human, appear to be fully
intact genes in cattle. No bovine homologues were found
for the mouse BPI-like genes SMGB, SPLUNC5 or
SPLUNC6.

products were obtained [GenBank:DQ777771 ,
DQ777772 and DQ777773] and were found to align with
the predicted cDNA sequences. BASE and BPIL3 cDNAs
were amplified from salivary tissues, and in addition BASE
cDNA was amplified from the nasal mucosa. Three distinct bands, each containing BSP30D cDNA, were amplified from parotid and submandibular salivary tissue (Fig.
3). The multiple bands are most likely due to variable
splicing of BSP30D mRNA. In total, evidence was
obtained for the expression of 11 of the 13 BPI-like genes
in cattle (Table 3).

Expression of the BPI-like genes in cattle
Each of the predicted bovine BPI-like cDNA sequences
were used as query to search for matches to experimentally produced cDNA sequences contained in an AgResearch database of ESTs [GenBank: DY037420DY223196] as well as the TIGR bovine Gene Indices. Positive matches were obtained for 7 of the 13 bovine BPIlike genes indicating they are expressed (Table 3). Alignment of the assembled EST contigs with the predicted
cDNA sequences were used to refine the cDNA sequences
for BPIL1, BSP30C and SPLUNC3 as described in the
Methods.

Evolution of the BPI-like locus
Cattle is the third species, the others being human and
mouse [14,21], for which the complete BPI-like locus has
been described. As a first step in understanding the evolutionary relationships among the members of the BPI-like
family, the sequences from the intact genes within the
BPI-like locus in cattle, human and mouse were aligned
and a phylogenetic tree was constructed (Fig. 4). This tree
confirms the status of nine of the bovine genes as
orthologs of genes in other species, and indicates that the
four BSP30 genes are clearly most closely related to PSP.
In addition, the four BSP30 genes are part of a sub-group
comprising all the single-domain proteins (the short
PLUNCs). Of all the two-domain proteins, the VEMSGP
gene is most closely related to the single-domain proteins.

We have previously demonstrated that four members of
the BPI-like protein family in cattle (BSP30A, BSP30B,
PLUNC and VEMSGP) are found in a restricted range of
tissues associated with the bovine oral cavity and airways
[19,20]. The pattern of transcript abundance of three additional BPI-like protein genes in cattle was determined by
Northern blotting using RNA extracted from a range of
bovine tissues. The results showed that BSP30C,
SPLUNC3, and BPIL1 are each expressed to a relatively
high level in a restricted range of bovine tissues (Fig. 2).
BSP30C mRNA was found in salivary glands, nasal
mucosa, tongue and abomasum, while a high abundance
of SPLUNC3 transcripts was found only in tongue. BPIL1
transcripts were found to be expressed only in the sublingual and buccal salivary glands, tonsil, cheek epithelium,
and the soft palate.

In order to determine the extent of evolutionary pressure
on the BPI-like proteins, the ratio (ω = dN/dS) of non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitutions was calculated between orthologous pairs of intact BPI-like genes
as well as between the BSP30 and PSP genes. The ratios
were less than 1 for all but two of the 22 pairs of BPI-like
orthologues (Table 4). This indicates that there has been
evolutionary pressure for amino acid sequence conservation in these genes since the divergence of human, mouse
and cattle. A similar analysis of the four BSP30 genes
together with human and mouse PSP genes resulted in
ratios not significantly different from 1 between pairings
of the four BSP30 genes and either human or mouse PSP.
This indicates relaxation of pressure for amino acid
sequence conservation (Table 5). To determine if this was
due to positive selection for divergence or solely relaxed
selection for conservation i.e. if the ω values were different

Evidence for expression of additional BPI-like proteins
was obtained using RT-PCR. Specific amplification was
obtained using primers derived from bovine BASE, BPIL3
and BSP30D. The nucleotide sequences of these PCR

between the bovine BSP30 and human and mouse PSP
genes, two codeml branch models were fitted, one where
the bovine BSP30 genes were allowed to have one ω ratio
and the PSP genes to have another ratio (two-ratio model)
and second where all BSP and PSP genes had the same
ratios (one ratio). The likelihood of the model with different ratios (LnL = -4057.73) was found to be significantly
better (p-val < 0.05) than the one-ratio model (LnL = 4060.12), showing the evidence of positive selection. In
addition, ratios between BSP30C and the other BSP30
proteins were significantly greater than 1, indicating that
there is positive selection pressure on BSP30C for divergence of its amino acid sequence from the other BSP30
proteins. To identify the amino acid sites under positive
selection, four different models M1a (NearlyNeutral),
M2a (PositiveSelection), M7 (β) and M8 (β and ω > 1)
were tested. The results are shown in Table 6. Both the
M2a and M8 models for selection were significantly better
than M1a and M7 respectively, with evidence for a proportion of sites (ca. 20% for both models) under positive
selection. The two models also identified six identical
amino acid sites with Bayesian probabilities of > 0.95 to
have the ω > 1 (listed in Table 6). Protein threading analysis using the PHYRE program [24] resulted in a very good
fit (expect value <E-9) for BSP30A onto the structural
model of the N-terminal domain of BPI, despite its less
than 40% amino acid sequence identity. This suggests that
among the bovine BPI-like proteins, at least BSP30A has

the same protein fold as BPI, including a similar hydrophobic pocket. The six sites under positive selection were
mapped onto the structure of BSP30A (Fig. 5). Five of the
six sites are in positions that are likely to contribute to the
shape of the hydrophobic pocket. It is possible that the
hydrophobic pocket functions to bind a substrate. Therefore, changes in these sites may influence the binding specificity of the protein.
The contiguous genomic sequence of the bovine BPI-like
locus was aligned with the orthologous region from
human using a dot-plot algorithm. For most of its length,
the sequences from both species align approximately1:1.
However, a 165 kbp region of the bovine contig (between
300 kbp and 465 kbp) contained a series of eight repeats,
ranging in size from 4 to 22 kbp (Fig. 6). Four of the eight
repeats contained the BSP30A, BSP30B, BSP30C and
BSP30D genes within them. One of the remaining four
repeats contained the pseudogene identified during initial
characterisation of the locus (XM_595323) (Fig. 7). A
gene prediction analysis of the other three repeats resulted
only in gene fragments. A similar analysis comparing the
bovine sequence with that of mouse revealed no such
repeats, but instead showed a large segment of the locus
that did not align (Fig. 6). A dot-plot alignment of the
bovine BPI-like locus genomic sequence against the
equivalent region of the dog genome revealed a similar
series of eight repeats (results not shown). The interspe-

manner analogous to what has previously been suggested
for Alu sequences in the human genome [26].

Discussion
A segment of the genomic contig from the RY2G5 to the
BASE gene was used as query in a BLAST search of a bovine
repetitive sequence database [25] to search for the presence of repeat elements within it. The search returned two
Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs), L1Bt and
RTEBt1. In total, significant alignments of greater than
800 bp were obtained at ten locations along the genomic
segment. All but one of these were positioned within or
very close to the gaps between the genomic duplications
(Fig. 7). It is possible that these LINE elements could have
contributed to the genome instability in this region of the
locus, resulting in the multiple gene duplications, in a

This report provides the first characterisation of the locus
encoding the BPI-like proteins in a ruminant species. The
analyses have shed light on how the locus has evolved as
well as raised possibilities regarding the function of the
BPI-like proteins in ruminants. The structural similarity
and clustering of the individual genes in the BPI-like locus
in the bovine, mouse, and human genomes suggests evolution from a single ancestral gene, with gene duplication
followed by divergent evolution giving rise to the differences between the family members. This appears to be
particularly prevalent in the bovine BPI-like protein locus
compared with the other species. Gene duplication has

been previously noted in ruminants. Duplication of a single ancestral secretory RNAse gene appears to have given
rise to the separate pancreatic, seminal and brain RNAse
genes found in ruminants [27]. Ruminants and other artiodactyls contain a large number of genes encoding the
pregnancy-associated glycoproteins, which appear to have
arisen by gene duplication [28]. Duplication of the lysozyme gene is a feature in its recruitment as a digestive
enzyme in ruminant artiodactyls [3]. The orientation of
the genes in the BPI-like cluster is consistent with gene
amplification by a series of unequal crossovers [29]. The
presence of multiple LINE elements within the expanded
BSP30 region of the locus provides one possible mechanism for the initiation step of the expansion.

The family of proteins in the cluster is divided into those
with one or two BPI domains (the long and short PLUNCs
[21]). The single-domain genes are contiguous within the
cluster. It is possible that the ancestral BPI-like gene was a
two-domain lipid binding protein. The six two-domain
proteins then arose through a series of gene duplications.
The first single-domain protein may have been created
through duplication of the N-terminal portion of one of
the two-domain proteins. The phylogenetic analysis
together with their position in the locus suggests that this
is most likely to have been the VEMSGP gene giving rise to
the PLUNC gene. Under this scenario, subsequent duplication of PLUNC would have given rise to additional single-domain proteins, some of which could have been

duplicated in turn, as appears to be the case with PSP giving rise to the four BSP30 genes. The most recent duplication appears to have been that giving rise to BSP30A and
B. The data indicates that duplication events have
occurred more frequently than the minimal number of
times required for the observed gene duplications. Interestingly, it appears that there have been distinct duplications in the mouse lineage giving rise to SPLUNC5 and
SPLUNC6.
The duplications giving rise to the four BSP30 genes in cattle may have occurred after divergence of cattle from other
mammals. Examination of genome assemblies from other
species indicates that human, dog and chimpanzee have
only a single PSP ortholog. Furthermore, a search of EST
databases revealed only single PSP orthologs in human,
dog and pig [GenBank:CB986486, DN405753 and
CJ027526, respectively]. Analysis of an in-house sheep
EST database revealed four ESTs [GenBank: EE792560,
EE792910, EE794201, and EE794362] that align closely
with both BSP30A and BSP30B. This indicates that
homologs of BSP30A and/or B exist in a second ruminant
species, the sheep, consistent with the possibility that the
BSP30 gene expansion may have coincided with the radiation of ruminant species. Further analyses are required to
confirm this.
The analyses reported here raise some intriguing questions regarding the function of the BPI-like proteins. All of
the greater family of BPI-like proteins characterised to

date share a common biochemical property in binding
complex lipids. These proteins have distinct sites of
expression and diverse functions such as lipid transport
and innate immunity. This and other reports
[14,16,20,30] show that most of the BPI-like proteins are
most abundant in tissues associated with the oral cavity
and airways. Here we show that at least one family member is also expressed at a lower level in the digestive tract.
It is likely the BPI-like proteins function in epithelial
mucosa after being secreted.
The question of whether the BSP30 proteins have a similar
lipid binding or bactericidal activity to that of BPI awaits
experimental verification. In support of this, recombinant
human PSP has been reported to inhibit the growth of P.
aeruginosa [17], and human PLUNC, has been shown to
bind LPS [31]. If these activities for the BSP30 proteins are
confirmed, a possible biological role for them could be in
modulating the microbial ecology in the bovine oral cavity so as to maintain optimal digestive function or prevent
pathological infection. The results presented here suggest
that the shape of the hydrophobic pocket may be important for determining functional differences among the
BSP30 proteins.

Conclusion
The bovine BPI-like locus of cattle features expansion of
the single PSP gene present in human and mouse into
four distinct BSP30 genes. The dN/dS ratio data are consistent with evolutionary pressure for conservation of protein

structure between all the orthologous pairs of BPI-like
genes in cattle, human and mouse. However, this pressure
is absent between the BSP30 genes, and the data suggests
there is pressure for sequence divergence between BSP30C
and the other BSP30 proteins. This, as well as its distinct
expression profile, is consistent with BSP30C having
acquired a distinct function from the other BSP30 proteins. The most likely biological role of the BPI-like proteins, including the BSP30 proteins, is as either detector or

effector proteins in innate immune host defence [11].
While their precise biological roles are unknown, one can
speculate that the BSP30 proteins may influence the host
response to the commensal microbial ecosystem in cattle,
including that of the rumen. BSP30A and B comprise
approximately 30% of total salivary protein in cattle [18],
thus resulting in up to 150 g per day of BSP30 proteins
being delivered into the rumen. A focus for future investigations is to determine whether the BSP30 gene duplica-

tions and subsequent divergence observed in cattle could
have been a key step in the evolution of ruminants by
facilitating adaptation to a ruminant lifestyle.

Methods
BAC screening, sequencing and assembly
A 1 Mbp region of the human assembly containing the
PSP region was downloaded from UCSC(hg16:Chr20:32–
33 Mbp lower case masked) and compared against
292,638 reads from the ends of individual random BAC
clones derived from two bovine genomic DNA BAC libraries (downloaded NCBI Nov 2003) using BLASTN and the
following options -m 8 -e 1e-2 -U T. The output was then
processed and ranked for high quality paired end hits in
the appropriate orientation and estimated size. Over 30
BAC clones mapped to the human BPI-like locus on chromosome 20. These were screened for the presence of
known BPI-like genes by PCR using primer sequences
derived from the previously determined bovine cDNA
sequences of BPIL1, VEMSGP, PLUNC, BPIL3 and RYA3.
The primer pair for BSP30B was derived from sequencing
of a segment of the BSP30B promoter contained within a
bovine genomic DNA clone in a cosmid vector. The following primer pairs were used. BSP30B: CACATCCTCACCACACACCTGGA
and
CAGACTGTCTGTGTCCAGTTCTGC; BPIL1: AGTTTCCCGAGCCCATGCCT and GGACTGGAAAGCCGAGTTGGAG; VEMSGP; GCCAGGTTGTTCAACTCAGAA and
GTGAGTTTTCCCGAATGG; PLUNC: CTCTCAGCAATGGCCTGCTCT
and
GGAGAGGGGTGAGTGAAGTCACTT; BPIL3: TGCTGGCTTCTCCAGGCTGT and
AAGCAGCCCCCACCACTCAA; RYA3: ACACTGCCTCTCATCTCCAACCA
and
AGGTTTAGCCAAGTAGAGGCCATT. The PCR products were gel purified, cloned into
pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega) and sequenced to confirm
the specificity of the PCR screen.

Six BAC clones that were confirmed by PCR to contain
parts of the BPI-like locus (CH240_399M6,
CH240_104J7,
CH240_90E15,
CH240_3F14,
CH240_477F3, and CH240_253F4) were selected for
high throughput shotgun sequencing. This was performed
by the TIGR library construction, random sequencing, and
closure teams as follows. BAC DNA was isolated, nebulized, the ends polished, and adaptors added. The DNA
were size-selected (2–3 kbp and 8–10 kbp), ligated to a
modified pBR322 vector, and transformed into E. coli
[32]. The libraries were checked for insert size, bovine origin, randomness, and overlap between clones prior to
high throughput sequencing. Templates were then prepared from the shotgun clones using an automated production pipeline. Sequencing reactions were carried out
on plasmid templates with MJ Research thermocyclers
using Applied Biosystems PRISM Big Dye™ Terminator
Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kits. Reactions were setup by Beckman Multimek automated pipetting robotic
workstations combining templates and reaction mixes.
Thirty to forty consecutive cycles of linear amplification
steps were performed. The reactions were then cleaned up
by ethanol precipitation and analysed on Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzers. Base calling was performed
with phred and Paracel TraceTuner that had been trained
with TIGR trace data. Sequence trimming was conducted
using LUCY – a program developed at TIGR [33] with a
trimming standard of an overall base call error rate of
<1%, free of vector- and E. coli sequences, and a trimmed
sequence read length of > 100 bp.
A total of 11,445 vector screened and clipped shotgun
sequences, with Phred quality scores, were assembled
using Phrap resulting in eight contigs ranging in size from
2 kbp to 158 kbp. The contigs were then mapped on to the
version 2.0 of the bovine assembly (BosTau2.0, The

Page 12 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:75

Bovine Genome Sequencing Project Consortium) and the
length of the between-contig gaps were estimated (which
ranged between 79 to 519 bp, while one gap could not be
estimated with the current depth of the genomic assembly). The final sequence was submitted to HTG part of the
GenBank (accession number DQ667137). The ver 2.0 of
the bovine genomic assembly was found to have order
and orientation anomalies, which is quite common in the
draft assemblies. However, the underlying contigs were
found to be assembled correctly. Thus the between contig
gaps were filled in from the bovine genomic assembly.
Gene mapping
Known cDNAs and protein sequences of the BPI-like
genes from human, mouse and cattle from the GenBank,
Ensembl bovine gene and protein predictions of the BPIlike genes [34] the human and bovine RefSeq nucleotide
and protein sequences (release 13) and the TIGR bovine
Gene Indices (release 11.0) [35], were mapped on to the
722 kbp bovine genomic contig. The nucleotide
sequences were mapped using the GMAP program [36],
while the protein sequences were mapped using
protein2genome model of Exonerate [37]. The bovine
genomic contig was also used as query to predict additional genes within the BPI-like locus using the Genescan
gene prediction program [38].

The 722 kbp genomic contig was used as a backbone on
an in-house installation of the Generic genome Browser,
[39]. The contigs resulting from the BAC sequencing, gene
mappings as well as the gene predictions were then put as
tracks on the GBrowse to facilitate identification of members of this family.
Sequencing of SPLUNC3, BSP30A and BSP30C cDNA
The predicted cDNA sequences for SPLUNC3, BSP30A
and BSP30C were used to query an in-house database of
over 200,000 bovine ESTs. These searches resulted contigs
that matched very well to each of the genes, but whose
sequence differed slightly from the predicted sequence.
For SPLUNC3 and BSP30C, the contig sequence was
extended using 5' and 3' RACE [GenBank: DQ677839 and
DQ835286]. For BSP30A, additional clones were
obtained by RT-PCR and the region of sequence divergence with the previous GenBank entry [U79413] was
sequenced. These additional clones had identical
sequence to the EST contig, thus confirming a reading
error in U79413. The updated sequence was submitted to
GenBank [U79413]
Sequence analysis
The protein sequences of the bovine, human and mouse
BPI-like genes were aligned using the SATCHMO (Simultaneous Alignment and Tree Construction using Hidden
Markov mOdels) [34] with a window size of 13. The C-ter-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/75

minal domains of the two-domain proteins (i.e. long
PLUNCs) were removed before aligning them to ensure
appropriate alignment between the one- and two-domain
proteins. The SATCHMO alignment of the protein
sequences was converted into a nucleotide alignment
using TRANALIGN program of EMBOSS [35]. An
unrooted tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method in PHYML v2.4.4 [40] with bootstrap support, at the nodes, computed for 1000 replications of the
data. A general time-reversible model of DNA substitution
(GTR) was used in the maximum likelihood and the initial tree used was BIONJ [41].
The rate of nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS)
substitutions was calculated following the method of
Yang and Nielsen [42] as implemented in the program
yn00 which is a part of PAML package (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood ver 3.15) [43]. Codeml, also
part of the PAML package, was used to detect the positive
selection for amino acid sequence divergence in the
bovine BSP30 versus human and mouse PSP genes. The
reduced alignment of the bovine BSP30 and human and
mouse PSP genes were fitted with two maximum likelihood models, namely one ratio and two-ratio models.
The one-ratio model assumed ω to be equal for all the
branches in the reduced tree, while the two-ratio model
allowed one ω value for the bovine branches and a possibly different value of ω for the Human and Mouse PSP
branches. The test of differences between different models
was carried out using a chi squared test. The evidence of
positive selection was obtained where the two-ratio
model was found to be significantly better than the oneratio model, with ω estimated to be higher in the bovine
lineage.
A sites model was also fitted to the reduced alignment of
bovine BSP30 and human and mouse PSP genes to identify the amino acid residues under selection for divergence. The models implemented in codeml, namely, M1a,
M2a, M7 and M8 were fitted for this purpose. The likelihood ratios from M1a and M2a and M7 and M8 were
compared for the evidence of selection for divergence
among sites. Bayesian probabilities [44] were calculated
for each amino acid in the alignment, after removing
ambiguity characters and those with Prob(ω >1) > 0.95
are reported.
For the genomic alignments, sequences were retrieved
from hg17:chr20: 30,700,000–31,700,000, mm7:chr2:
153,400,000–154,400,000
and
canFam2:chr24:24,900,000–25,900,000 and aligned
with the assembled bovine region using OWEN [45]. All
sequences were assembled with the same parameters
which consisted of an initial round using default parameters and then a second round with a lower threshold (1E-

4) followed by manual removal of the off diagonal elements.
mRNA analysis
A range of bovine tissues were obtained from a FriesianHolstein dairy cow at slaughter, snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen and ground to a frozen powder in liquid nitrogen. RNA was isolated from the tissues using Trizol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA
was resolved on a formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred
to membrane and probed with 32P-labelled cDNA as previously described [19]. The probes used were full length
bovine BSP30C, SPLUNC3 and BPIL1 cDNA. The blots
were washed at moderately high stringency (65°C in
phosphate buffer [46]) and the signal was visualised by
exposure to X-ray film.

Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
was performed on RNA isolated from a similar range of
bovine tissues to that described above. RT reactions were
performed using 1 µg of RNA and MMLV reverse transcriptase in a 20 µl reaction following an established protocol [47]. A 1 µl aliquot was subjected to PCR using the
following primer sets: actin; CGCACCACTGGCATTGTCAT and TTCTCCTTGATGTCACGCAC, BPIL3; CCAGGGATGAAGCCTATCAA
and
TGTGAGGAGCCTTCAGCATA, BASE; GAAGGTCTCCAGCCTCTTCA and CTCAGGAATGAGCCTGCAAT,
BSP30D; TGAGGCGGACCCAGAGAAGA and AATGCGTTACCAGGGACAATAC. The actin, BASE and BPIL3 reactions employed an annealing temperature of 55°C and
proceeded for 30 cycles. The annealing temperature of the
BSP30D reaction was 60°C. The amplified DNAs were
resolved on agarose gels and visualised by staining with
ethidium bromide.
Structure prediction
The BSP30A amino acid sequence was submitted to the
on-line protein threading program, PHYRE [24]. The
search returned a top structure prediction with an expect
value of 2.2e-09, with a precision value of 100%. The
thread was based on the crystal structure of BPI. The structure was viewed using the 3D molecule viewer module of
the Vector NTI software package.
