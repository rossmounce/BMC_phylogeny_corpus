Abstract
Background: The genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis harbors four copies of a cluster of genes
termed mce operons. Despite extensive research that has demonstrated the importance of these
operons on infection outcome, their physiological function remains obscure. Expanding databases
of complete microbial genome sequences facilitate a comparative genomic approach that can
provide valuable insight into the role of uncharacterized proteins.
Results: The M. tuberculosis mce loci each include two yrbE and six mce genes, which have
homology to ABC transporter permeases and substrate-binding proteins, respectively. Operons
with an identical structure were identified in all Mycobacterium species examined, as well as in five
other Actinomycetales genera. Some of the Actinomycetales mce operons include an mkl gene, which
encodes an ATPase resembling those of ABC uptake transporters. The phylogenetic profile of Mkl
orthologs exactly matched that of the Mce and YrbE proteins. Through topology and motif analyses
of YrbE homologs, we identified a region within the penultimate cytoplasmic loop that may serve
as the site of interaction with the putative cognate Mkl ATPase. Homologs of the exported proteins
encoded adjacent to the M. tuberculosis mce operons were detected in a conserved chromosomal
location downstream of the majority of Actinomycetales operons. Operons containing linked mkl,
yrbE and mce genes, resembling the classic organization of an ABC importer, were found to be
common in Gram-negative bacteria and appear to be associated with changes in properties of the
cell surface.
Conclusion: Evidence presented suggests that the mce operons of Actinomycetales species and
related operons in Gram-negative bacteria encode a subfamily of ABC uptake transporters with a
possible role in remodeling the cell envelope.

Background
A putative Mycobacterium tuberculosis virulence gene,
named mce1A, was originally identified because its expression in Escherichia coli enabled this noninvasive bacterium
to enter mammalian epithelial cells [1]. Sequencing of the
M. tuberculosis genome revealed that mce1A (Rv0169) was
part of an operon that encoded eight putative membraneassociated proteins: YrbEA-B, MceA-F [2,3]. This operon is

present four times in the M. tuberculosis genome (mce1-4).
Homologs of the genes adjacent to the mce1 locus,
Rv0175-Rv0178, are located downstream of the mce3 and
mce4 gene clusters (Figure 1) [3].
Continued interest in the function of the M. tuberculosis
mce operons stems from reports of the profound effect of
disruption of mce operons on growth and virulence of the

mutant strains in mice. Shimono et al. [4] showed that an
mce1 mutant was hypervirulent when inoculated intravenously into BALB/c mice. In the first few weeks of infection, the mutant strain multiplied more rapidly than wildtype in the mice's lungs, spleen and liver. Surprisingly,
Gioffre et al. [5] found that a yrbE1B mutant grew faster
than wild-type in the lungs and spleens of BALB/c mice
inoculated via the peritoneum, but more slowly in mice
infected through the tracheal route. Sassetti and Rubin [6]
reported that in competitive mixed infections mce1
mutants exhibited a growth defect in the spleens of intravenously-infected C57BL/6J mice after one week of infection. Although the exact cause of these apparently
disparate phenotypes remains to be established, the
observations suggest that the fate of mce1 mutants in vivo
is determined by the prevailing immunological environment experienced during the first few weeks of infection.
Both mce2 and mce3 mutants replicated slower than wildtype in BALB/c mice infected via either the trachea or peritoneum [5]; however, neither mutant demonstrated a significant growth defect in competitive mixed infections [6].
In co-infected C57BL/6J mice, an mce4 mutant was attenuated relative to wild-type after two to four weeks infection, whilst an mce1-mce4 double mutant exhibited
further attenuation, indicating that the mce operons perform non-redundant roles during infection [7].
The similarity of the YrbE and Mce proteins with ATPbinding cassette (ABC) transporter permeases and substrate-binding proteins, respectively, has been noted pre-

viously [8,9]. ABC transporters couple the energy released
by ATP hydrolysis to the translocation of a substrate across
a membrane. Members of the ABC transporter family are
ubiquitous in living organisms and comprise one of largest superfamilies known [10].
A functional ABC transporter system minimally contains
two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding ATPase domains and
two transmembrane channel-forming permease domains.
These components can be homo- or heterodimers and
may be encoded on separate or fused polypeptides. Both
eukaryotes and prokaryotes contain ABC exporters,
whereas importers have been identified only in prokaryotes. Importers additionally require substrate-binding proteins (SBPs) that provide specificity and high-affinity.
Typically, SBPs are periplasmic in Gram-negative bacilli
and lipoproteins in Gram-positive bacilli [11]. SBPs share
a two-lobed quaternary structure with a central cleft that
undergoes a large conformational change upon ligandbinding, promoting close interaction with the cognate
permease. This results in hydrolysis of ATP, which energizes translocation of the substrate [12]. In Gram-negative
bacteria, SBP-dependent importers also usually require
porins or specific receptors to facilitate transport across
the outer membrane [11].
The genes encoding the ATPase, permease and SBP components of an ABC transporter are often contiguous in the
genome and comprise an operon. Phylogenetic clustering
of the individual transporter components is almost always
concordant, indicating that the operons have arisen from

a common ancestral transporter with minimal shuffling
of constituents. In addition, sequence similarity shows
good correlation with substrate specificity [13-15].
The ATPase is the most conserved component of the system and transporter function is frequently predicted
solely on the basis of ATPase orthology [10,15]. These
proteins contain a homologous region, of 200 amino
acids, with several characteristic motifs: Walker A and B
motifs in the nucleotide-binding fold [16], as well as a signature motif found only in ABC transporter-associated, or
'traffic', ATPases [17].
The permease components and SBPs have limited primary
sequence similarity, and thus their identification is not
facile. They are typically identified in genome sequences
by their proximity to ATPases and, for permeases, possession of predicted transmembrane regions [18-20]. The
inference of function through sequence comparison has
traditionally relied upon similarity to close homologs of
known function. The advent of the genomic age has provided invaluable new methods for the elucidation of roles
of proteins with unknown function. Non-homologybased methods of genome comparison use patterns of
domain fusion [21], conserved chromosomal location
[22], and phylogenetic profiles [23], to predict functional
interactions between proteins. In addition, the availability
of hundreds of complete genome sequences permits the
reliable identification of orthologs, operationally-defined
as reciprocal best hits [24], enabling more precise functional prediction than sequence similarity alone. These
methods are non-redundant and their application can
facilitate deduction of specific function [25]. Here we
endeavor to further understand the function of the M.
tuberculosis mce operons, and assess the likelihood that
they encode ABC transporters, through sequence and
genome comparisons, database mining and the application bioinformatic methods.

Results
Distribution of mce operons in Actinomycetales
Perusal of databases of conserved domains, such as InterPro [26], Pfam [27] and TIGRFAM [28], constitutes a simple method for the identification of homologous
proteins. The M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome encodes 24
Mce proteins, each of which contains a conserved domain
of 304 amino acids defined by the TIGRFAM family:
TIGR00996 (IPR005693). Members of this family are
confined to the Order Actinomycetales. The corresponding
Pfam family, PF02470 (IPR003399), describes a 98
amino acid sub-region of the Mce domain that is more
widely distributed (see below). The mce genes in M. tuberculosis are clustered in groups of six; each cluster is preceded by two copies of a gene termed yrbE (Figure 1).
Databases of conserved domains group the YrbE proteins

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/60

into a family called DUF140 (domain of unknown function). Pfam defines the family by a region approximately
150 amino acids long (PF02405; IPR003453). The corresponding TIGRFAM family (TIGR00056) describes a subfamily of DUF140, but excludes the mycobacterial
homologs based on a stated extreme divergence at the
amino end. For the sake of clarity, we refer to a cluster of
genes encoding two YrbE and six Mce proteins as an 'mce
operon'.
To assess the distribution of mce operons in completed
and draft assemblies of genomes of members of the Order
Actinomycetales, we surveyed the annotation of predicted
proteins for members of Pfam families PF02470 and
PF02405 (Table 1). The proteomes of all 10 Mycobacterium
species examined contained Mce proteins. The number
varied from 6 in Mycobacterium leprae up to 66 in Mycobacterium vanbaalenii. Other genomes containing mce genes
belonged to species of Nocardia, Janibacter, Nocardiodes,
Amycolatopsis and Streptomyces. Mce homologs were absent
from 18 Actinomycetales genomes, notably including those
of the four sequenced Corynebacterium species. DUF140
proteins were found encoded within all Actinomycetales
genomes that contain mce genes and were absent from all
genomes that do not contain mce genes. Other completely
sequenced genomes of species belonging to the Class
Actinobacteria, namely Rubrobacter xylanophilus, Symbiobacterium thermophilum and Bifidobacterium longum, did not
contain either Mce or DUF140 homologs.
Examination of the genomic location of the Mce and
DUF140 homologs revealed that the mce genes were
almost always found clustered in groups of six, located
downstream from a pair of DUF140 genes (Figure 2).
Identification of mce-like operons in Gram-negative
bacteria
A 98 amino acid sub-region of Mce family proteins,
termed the 'Mce-like' domain (PF02470), is widely distributed in Gram-negative bacteria and has also been
found encoded in plant genomes. No Mce-like domains
have been identified in any Archeael or low GC-content
Gram-positive bacterial genomes.

Genes with related functions are frequently encoded
within operons and thus found clustered in the genomes
of prokaryotes [22]. We investigated the gene neighborhoods of selected mce-like genes with the aim of obtaining
clues regarding the biological role of proteins of this family (Figure 3). The Mce-like proteins in Gram-negative
bacteria were frequently found clustered in the genome
with a DUF140 family protein and an ATPase homolog
(IPR003439) in an arrangement typical of an ABC transporter system [11]. The three components were found
encoded in any order and in some instances either the

DUF140 or ATPase homolog was duplicated. In a number
of γ-Proteobacteria the ATPase-DUF140-Mce cluster was
encoded in a conserved genomic region that included a
Tol protein (IPR008869), a STAS domain protein
(IPR002645) and MurA(IPR005750), the product of
which catalyses the first step of murein biosynthesis. Like
Mce domains, Tol proteins have homology to SBPs [29];
the presence of SBPs indicates that these operons encode
substrate uptake transporters. Aravind and Koonin suggested that the nucleotide-binding activity of STAS
domains, found in sulfate transporters, could regulate
uptake in response to intracellular ATP or GTP concentrations [30]. Several DUF140 proteins that are N-terminally
fused to STAS domains have been identified [31], implying a functional linkage between these two proteins in the
mce operons [21]. The Mce transporter clusters were also
frequently found associated with homologs of a surfaceexposed lipoprotein VacJ (IPR007428), and the morphoprotein BolA (IPR002634).
The Mce homologs in these putative transporter operons
each contain a single 98 amino acid Mce-like domain.
Many proteobacterial genomes additionally contain Mce
homologs, sometimes annotated as PqiB, that contain 2–
7 copies of the Mce-like domain and are usually associated with a PqiA family protein (IPR007498) of unknown
function. The E. coli pqiAB operon is induced by treatment
with the model superoxide generator, paraquat [32].
Mce-associated ATPases
Since ABC transporters absolutely require an ATPase to
provide the energy required for substrate translocation,
the genes neighboring the Actinomycetales mce operons
were inspected for ATPase homologs (IPR003439).
Although none of the mycobacterial mce operons neighbors an ATPase, a candidate gene was identified immediately upstream of a single mce operon in the genome of
every non-mycobacterial Actinomycetales species that possesses mce genes (Table 2). BLASTP analyses demonstrated
that the corresponding protein sequences were reciprocal
best hits with the mce-linked ATPases in Gram-negative
bacteria, indicating orthology [24]. A phylogenetic analysis of ABC transporter ATPases reported by Dassa and
Bouige groups these Actinomycetales and Gram-negative
bacterial ATPases into a family termed Mkl [8].

The sequences of the N. farcinica and Streptomyces mcelinked ATPases (nfa51100, SAV5902 and SCO2422) were
used as BLASTP queries in order to identify additional
Mkl-like ATPases. The best hits from each of the completed Actinomycetales genomes (Table 1) were retrieved
for further evaluation. Phylogenetic analysis of the protein sequences revealed that each Mycobacterium species
contained a single ATPase that clustered with the Mkl family, providing strong evidence of orthology (Figure 4,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/60

Table 2). In addition, a paralog was identified in the N.
farcinica genome (nfa20200); this ORF is annotated in
The Institute of Genome Research (TIGR) database as
MetN, a D-methionine ABC transporter ATPase, but it
does not cluster with other putative MetN orthologs (Figure 4).
Comparison of the most closely related ORFs in other
Actinomycetales revealed that only those genomes that contained mce operons possessed an orthologous ATPase
(Figure 4). Congruency of the phylogenetic profiles of the
Mkl ATPases with YrbE and Mce proteins provides further
evidence of functional association [23].
Each of the mce-linked ATPases and mycobacterial
orthologs contain the conserved Walker A and B motifs
required for ATP binding, as well as the ABC transporter
family signature (LSGGQ) with no more than one mismatch [16,33]. In a published analysis of M. tuberculosis
ABC transporters, the putative Mce ATPase, Rv0655, segregated with importers but did not fall into any of the previously described families with known substrates [20].
Similarly, in a more expansive study, the Mkl family
ATPases fell into the SBP-dependent importer clade, but
clustered separately from those with established specificity [8].
The mycobacterial Mkl ATPases and nfa20200 and are not
genomically located near any other ABC transporter components and appear to be transcriptionally-isolated. The
M. leprae ortholog is located adjacent to RNA polymerase
rpo genes leading to speculation that this ATPase was
involved in ribonucleotide uptake [34]. Consequently,
Mkl ATPases are sometimes annotated as ribonucleotide
uptake systems.
The Mce proteins
Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the Mce proteins encoded in the genomes of Mycobacterium bovis and
the M. tuberculosis strains H37Rv, CDC1551 and 210,
revealed that each of the M. tuberculosis genomes contained 24 Mce ORFs, whilst, as noted previously, the mce3
operon is deleted in M. bovis [35]. A number of genes were
found to contain frameshift mutations: mce1F in strain
210; mce2B in strains H37Rv and CDC1551; mce2C in
strain CDC1551; and mce2D and mce2E in M. bovis. The
truncated ORFs thus conspicuously clustered within the
mce2 operon.

A non-redundant set of Mce proteins from the genomes of
M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. leprae, Mycobacterium avium
subsp. paratuberculosis (M. paratuberculosis), Mycobacterium
smegmatis, N. farcinica, S. coelicolor and S. avermilitis were
selected for further analysis. Examination of the genomic
regions of partial operons revealed the presence of several

homologs revealed six distinct branches, which corresponded exactly to the encoding genes in the respective
operons (that is mceA-F; Figure 5). Within each of the six
major branches, the clustering of sequences was essentially the same. This pattern indicates that each mce gene
cluster duplicated from an ancestral operon that contained six mce genes and that no shuffling between or
within operons has occurred.
We have classified the operons as mce1-8 according to the
clustering observed (Table 3). The mce1 and mce2 operons
are the most closely related and duplication may have
occurred after divergence of the fast- and slow-growing
mycobacteria, since M. smegmatis contains a single copy.
Although the orthology of the M. smegmatis operon cannot be deduced from the phylogenetic tree, we infer from
synteny that it is orthologous to the M. tuberculosis mce1
operon. Thus, mce1 is the sole operon that is found in all,
and in only, the Mycobacterium species examined. The
Streptomyces operons fall into a cluster, termed mce6, that
does not contain any mycobacterial orthologs, but is
found in N. farcinica. The Mkl-like ATPase is located
upstream of yrbEA6 in all three of these operons. In several
cases operon orthology could not be deduced from the
branching pattern observed, presumably due to recent
duplication events. Thus, it appears that M. paratuberculosis and M. smegmatis possess two copies of the mce5
operon; M. paratuberculosis and N. farcinica have two copies of the mce7 operon; and N. farcinica has two copies of
the mce8 operon. The M. paratuberculosis Mce5E protein

(MAP2193) seems to have diverged significantly from its
paralog (MAP0764); examination of the encoding
sequences revealed that this is a consequence of a 40bp
deletion, which results in a frameshift of the N-terminal
120 amino acids.
One and two extra copies of Mce1A were found in M.
paratuberculosis
(MAP3289)
and
M.
smegmatis
(MSMEG5783, MSMEG6500), respectively; whilst N. farcinica contained a second copy of Mce4A (nfa25900).
Each of the encoding genes appeared to be transciptionally isolated, with the exception of MSMEG5783, which is
located within a four-gene operon that includes pyridoxamine 5-phosphate oxidase and a putative lipoprotein.
Secondary structure predictions, through the JPred server,
revealed the consensus structure of the conserved Pfam
region folded into five β-strands; the central region of
Actinomycetales Mce proteins, included in the conserved
TIGRFAM region, contains eight α-helices. The C-terminal
region varies in length from 10–250 amino acids, has predicted low complexity and is rich in proline residues (Figure 6). Length is not conserved within the six homologous
families, with the exception of the MceB proteins in which
the C-terminal region is 30–50 amino acids in all cases.
On average the MceA and MceF proteins are the longest.
An RGD motif was identified in the C-terminal tail of 16
(of 27) MceE sequences. This motif is known to bind
integrins, as well as C2 domains [36,37].
Each of the Mce proteins contained a hydrophobic stretch
at the N-terminus, likely to be a transmembrane helix.
Using a neural network trained on Gram-positive bacteria
the program SignalP predicted a signal peptide cleavage
site for 98 of 161 of these proteins [38]. There was no correlation between prediction of secretion and Mce-type (AF) or bacterial species. Although the Mce anchor regions
frequently contained a pair of arginine residues, characteristic of Twin-arginine transporter (Tat) motifs, few (12 of
161) are recognized as Tat substrates [39]. A lipoprotein
attachment site (PS00013) was present in 22 of 27 MceE
proteins. The highly conserved operon structure containing six mce genes suggests that they associate to form a
heteromeric complex [22,40], which is therefore likely to
remain tethered to the cell membrane even if some proteins are cleaved. Indeed, Mce1A-1F have been shown to
localize to the cell envelope of M. tuberculosis [4].
The YrbE proteins
Unlike the Mce proteins, the amino acid sequences of
YrbE orthologs in the M. tuberculosis strains H37Rv,
CDC1551 and 210, as well as M. bovis, were found to be
>99.5% identical in all cases. The sequences of the YrbE
proteins associated with the mce gene clusters of M. tuberculosis, M. leprae, M. paratuberculosis, M. smegmatis, N. far-

Phylogenetic tree showing relationship between mce-linked ATPases and mycobacterial orthologs. ATPases
encoded within mce operons in Actinomycetales species are colored blue; those in Gram-negative bacterial mce operons are
colored green. The sequences most similar to nfa51100, SAV5902 and SCO2422 (indicated in bold), in the Actinomycetales
genomes listed in Table 1, were identified by BLASTP searches and included in the tree. All of the best hits from mycobacterial
species cluster within the Mkl family and are colored red. For comparison, sequences of all M. tuberculosis H37Rv ATPases of
ABC uptake transporters were included [20]. All of the top hits from Actinomycetales that do not possess mce operons are
rooted among these non-mce-linked ATPases, as are all of the second hits from mycobacterial species. ORFs are designated by
(UniProt gene name | protein name).

Illustration
Illustration of conserved regions and predicted secondary structure of Actinomycetales Mce proteins. Six separate alignments of the Mce proteins (A-F) listed in Table 3 were submitted to JPred and the consensus secondary structure
prediction estimated manually. White boxes represent α-helices and grey arrows β-strands. The C-terminal proline-rich
region had low complexity and varied in length from 10–250 amino acids. Signal sequences were identified by SignalP and lipid
attachment sites matched the ProSite motif PS00013.

cinica, S. coelicolor and S. avermilitis were selected for
further analysis. In several cases the ORF downstream of
yrbEA was either not annotated or annotated in the reverse
direction; however, translation of the genomic sequence
revealed a YrbEB homolog encoded in the expected direction (Table 3).
Phylogenetic analysis showed deep branching between
the YrbEA and YrbEB sequences (Figure 7). Within each
clade the clustering of sequences was almost identical
demonstrating that the yrbEA-yrbEB genes have evolved as
a pair. The clustering was comparable to that seen in the
Mce protein tree, with members of the mce1/2 and mce3 to
mce8 operons easily distinguishable. Thus, it appears that
all of the operons examined evolved from a common
ancestral eight-gene cluster without shuffling of genes
within or between operons.
ABC permeases typically contain six transmembrane segments with the C-terminus located on the cytoplasmic
side of the membrane [11]. The consensus TMHMM-predicted structure of Actinomycetales YrbE homologs found
in mce operons suggests the presence of five or six transmembrane helices with the C-terminus outside (Figure
8a). The presence of the N-terminal transmembrane helix
was equivocal, and therefore the N-terminus may be cytoplasmic or outside. Further topological predictions using
the programs HMMTOP and TopPred confirmed this
model, but were unable to verify or refute the existence of
the N-terminal transmembrane segment.
Dassa and colleagues [41,42] have described a highly-conserved sequence, the EAA motif, in the final cytoplasmic

loop of some SBP-dependent ABC permeases that is proposed to interact with the cognate ATPase [43]. Examination of the multiple alignment of YrbE proteins revealed a
conserved sequence motif located in the penultimate
cytoplasmic loop. The consensus deduced from 50 Actinomycetales YrbEA and YrbEB sequences is shown in Figure
8b. Alignment of Gram-negative bacterial DUF140 proteins revealed that this region was highly conserved in all
family members. The consensus sequence we have
deduced does not appear to be homologous to the published motifs, but does contain the common invariant glycine residue and is predicted to adopt the typical α-helical
structure [42]. The consensus 47 amino acid YrbE
sequence, that we have termed the EExDA motif, was able
to specifically retrieve Actinomycetales and Gram-negative
DUF140 proteins from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) microbial proteomes database.
In one case (Rhodopirellula baltica, RB3287) a DUF140
domain is fused to an ABC ATPase domain providing evidence that the function of DUF140 proteins requires ATP
hydrolysis [21].
The Mas proteins
The four genes downstream of the M. tuberculosis mce1
operon, as well as two each downstream of the mce3 and
mce4 operons, are annotated in TubercuList [44] as 'conserved mce-associated proteins' (herein termed Mas). The
mce1 operon transcript has been empirically demonstrated to include the associated mas genes (Rv0175-78)
[45]. Examination of a multiple alignment of the protein
sequences revealed that they were not conserved along

their entire length but shared a similar C-terminal region
of approximately 160 amino acids. Pairwise sequence
identity scores, generated by ClustalX, for the conserved
region ranged from 12 to 25%.
To determine whether homologous domains were present
in other genomes, we used each of the eight Mas C-terminal sequences as a PSI-BLAST query against the NCBI nonredundant database. A total of 137 sequences were
retrieved; of these, 124 sequences were hit by all eight
query sequences, and all 137 were hit by more than two
queries. The proteins identified belonged to six genera:
Amycolatopsis, Janibacter, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Nocardiodes and Streptomyces. Thus, the phylogenetic profile for
the putative Mas homologs in Actinomycetales genera
exactly matches that of the Mce, DUF140 and Mkl proteins. Mas homologs in the M. smegmatis genome, which
was not covered by the NCBI database, were identified by
exhaustive BLAST querying of the TIGR proteome. Nine-

teen putative Mas homologs were thus identified (P <
0.00001).
Sequences of the putative Mas domain containing proteins from M. tuberculosis, M. leprae, M. paratuberculosis, M.
smegmatis, N. farcinica, S. avermitilis and S. coelicolor were
selected for further analysis. This resulted in a set of 66
sequences (including one hybrid sequence, MAP2107/9c,
that has been disrupted by a transposase).
The Mas domain genes were typically found in pairs (58
of 66) and the majority (43 of 66) were encoded downstream of, and in the same direction, as mce genes (Table
4). Putative orthologs of each of the eight M. tuberculosis
mce operon-associated mas genes were identified in the
corresponding positions of those genomes carrying
orthologous operons. Each of the mce7 operons had a single Mas protein encoded downstream. The mce6 operons
of N. farcinica and S. avermilitis contained two mas genes,

while the corresponding S. coelicolor operon carried four.
In M. paratuberculosis, a pair of mas homologs was located
in the regions both upstream and downstream of the mce5
operon, but transcribed from the opposite strand
(MAP0750-51c, MAP0767-68c). The 23 non-mce operonassociated Mas homologs were generally located in pairs
in isolated operons. An exception was Rv2390c, which
TIGR predicts is part of a three-gene operon including a
resuscitation promoting factor (rpfD, Rv2389c) and an FeS enzyme involved in porphyrin biosynthesis (hemN,
Rv2388c).
The Mas region is not currently recognized as a conserved
domain in the databases. However, within this region,
InterPro recognized a lipocalin family motif (IPR002345)
in Rv3492c, and a partial C2 domain signature

(IPR000008) in Rv0199 and ML2614. Notably, the corresponding Pfam families (PF00061 and PF00168) did not
include these sequences as members. Nonetheless, it may
be worthy of mention that the lipocalin and C2 domains
share a lipid-binding function, as well as an eightstranded anti-parallel beta sandwich structure [46,47].
The majority of pairwise identity scores for the 66 Mas
domains were 10–20%. This low level of sequence similarity resulted in multiple sequence alignments that were
extremely sensitive to input parameters. Exclusion of the
13 non-mycobacterial sequences produced a much more
robust alignment. A phylogenetic tree generated from this
alignment is shown in Figure 9. Examination of the tree
revealed that the Mas proteins encoded by the first and
second genes in each pair formed phylogenetically dis-

tinct clusters. The Mas proteins encoded adjacent to mce
operons were not separated from the non-mce associated
Mas proteins. The M. leprae, M. paratuberculosis and M.
smegmatis Mas proteins associated with the mce1, mce3
and mce4 operons are clearly orthologs of those in the corresponding genomic positions in M. tuberculosis. The
mce7-associated Mas proteins also cluster together. Several
pairs of non-mce associated Mas homologs were conserved between mycobacterial species (Figure 9; Cluster I
and Cluster II).
The mycobacterial mce-associated Mas orthologs have
greater than 50% pairwise identity. In contrast, the Nocardia and Streptomyces mce6-associated Mas proteins are
highly divergent (15–20% identity). This suggests that,
unlike the mce and yrbE genes, the mas genes have either
diverged more rapidly or were independently recruited to
the operons.
Comparison of JPred secondary structure predictions for
orthologous clusters revealed the consensus structure of
the conserved domain was α1α2α3α4β1β2β3β4. Prediction
of transmembrane helices indicated that all 66 protein
sequences harbored a transmembrane segment located
about 140–180 amino acids from the C-terminus and corresponding to α1. Topology prediction programs,
TMHMM, HMMTOP and TopPred, suggested the C-terminus was extracellular for 41, 56 and 42, of the 66 submitted sequences, respectively. In no case did all three
programs predict an extracellular N-terminus for a single
protein. Thus, it seems likely that all N-termini are intracellular, while the C-terminal Mas domains are located on
the external side of the cytoplasmic membrane.
The length of the N-terminal region preceding the Mas
domain ranged from 7 to 325 amino acids. In the majority of proteins in which the N-terminal segment was less
than 30 amino acids (11 of 16), α1 was predicted to be a
signal peptide by SignalP (Figure 10). Consensus topology predictions indicated that the four Mas1B orthologs
and three Cluster IIB proteins contained two N-terminal
transmembrane helices (oriented in-out, out-in). In the
Mas1B orthologs, the two N-terminal transmembrane segments correspond to an RDD domain (IPR010432).
Examination of a multiple alignment revealed that
although M. smegmatis Mas1B does not actually have the
N-terminal signature RD residues, the Cluster IIB proteins
do. It has been proposed that the RDD domain is involved
in transport [31]; however, to date, no empirical evidence
has been published to support this claim. In MSMEG0879
the 325 amino acid N-terminal region encodes a protein
kinase domain (IPR000719) containing the Ser/Thr
kinase active site motif (PS00108). Coiled-coils, which are
known to mediate protein-protein interactions [48], were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/60

identified in the N-terminal region of each Cluster IA
sequence by the Lupas COILS algorithm.

Discussion
In this study we sought to gain insight into the function of
the M. tuberculosis mce operons using genome comparisons and bioinformatic methods.
The YrbE and Mce proteins, encoded by the M. tuberculosis
mce operons, have homology to the permease and SBP
components of ABC transporters, respectively [29]. However, sequence similarity within these protein families is
notoriously low, and confirmation that the mce operons
encode ABC importers has required identification of the
necessary cognate ATPase. Dassa and Bouige [8] have proposed that Rv0655, an ATPase named Mkl, might supply
this function and here we provide substantial evidence
that this is indeed the case.
Firstly, Mkl orthologs are encoded immediately upstream
of the mycobacterial-like mce operons in species of Nocardia, Janibacter, Nocardioides, Amycolatopsis and Streptomyces. Secondly, orthologs of Mkl are found in all, and in
only, those Actinomycetales species that also contain Mce
and DUF140 homologs. The presence of an intact mkl
gene in the M. leprae genome, which has undergone extensive reductive evolution [49], is significant in this respect.
Thirdly, in Gram-negative bacteria, operons containing
DUF140 and mce homologs invariably include the orthologous mkl gene. Recently, Joshi et al. [7] observed that in
competitive mouse infections an Rv0655 mutant was
attenuated relative to wild-type M. tuberculosis, whereas an
Rv0655-mce1 double mutant showed no attenuation relative to the mce1 mutant, providing evidence that Rv0655
and the Mce1 proteins are functionally linked. It is notable that in the Mycobacterium species examined, the mkl
gene is located within the genomic region that encodes
the majority of ribosomal proteins; this is generally the
most conserved region in prokaryotic genomes and could
facilitate high level expression of mkl [40].
It is widely accepted that the direction of substrate transport of ABC transporters can be predicted on the basis of
ATPase homology [10]. In phylogenetic analyses, Mkl
ATPases fall into the importer clade [8,20]; this prediction
is consistent with the proposed role of Mce proteins as
SBPs, which are found exclusively in substrate import systems.
The results of topology prediction indicated that the YrbE
proteins contained five to six transmembrane segments,
with the C-terminal five the most conserved and the C-terminus outside. In support of this model, the periplasmic
location of the C-terminus of E. coli YrbE has been demonstrated empirically [50]. In general, ABC permeases

Representative architectures of Mas domain-containing proteins
Representative architectures of Mas domain-containing proteins. Membrane topology predictions for the 66 Mas
proteins listed in Table 4 indicated that the conserved domain was located on the extracellular side of the cytoplasmic membrane. The Mas domain was predicted to remain anchored in the majority of proteins (A), but cleaved in eight (B). Three transmembrane segments were identified in seven proteins and four of these were classified as RDD domains (C, D). Five proteins
contained an N-terminal coiled-coil region (E), and one, a serine-threonine protein kinase domain (STPK; F).
show the highest level of sequence similarity over the Cterminal five transmembrane regions, and this is considered to be the minimal functional unit [11]. In compiled
alignments of ABC permease sequences, the most conserved region localizes to the final cytoplasmic loop [42].
This motif, termed the EAA loop, likely interacts with the
cognate ATPase [43]. A highly conserved motif, predicted
to localize to the penultimate cytoplasmic loop, was identified in YrbE proteins from both Actinomycetales and
Gram-negative bacteria. We propose that this motif,
named the EExDA loop, serves as the site of interaction
with the putative cognate Mkl ATPase, in a manner analogous to the EAA loop.
Conservation of the 'two yrbE plus six mce' operon structure suggests that these components comprise the functional unit of the canonical Actinomycetales Mce
transporter [22,40]. We have found that mutation of
either the yrbE1A, mce1A or mce1E genes of M. tuberculosis
results in undetectable levels of all the Mce1 proteins,
implying that these proteins are part of a hetero-octomeric
complex and its formation is necessary for stability of the
Mce proteins [4] (L. Morici, personal communication). It

is interesting that many Proteobacteria contain membrane
proteins with multiple Mce domains (PqiB proteins) that
could potentially interact forming a quaternary structure
analogous to the putative Acinomycetales Mce complex.
The permease components of ABC transporters, that form
a channel across the cytoplasmic membrane, are frequently heterodimers; however, although present in stoichiometric excess, SBPs are generally encoded by one or
two genes [11]. The presence of six SBPs is, thus far, a
unique characteristic of the Actinomycetales Mce transporters. Using computational methods, Pajon et al. [51] found
that the β-sheet region of eight of the M. tuberculosis Mce
proteins contained patterns typical of transmembrane βstrands and suggested that this region could promote penetration of the outer lipid layer. Thus, it is tempting to
speculate that the Mce proteins are designed to form a
channel that crosses this lipid bilayer. Chitale et al. [52]
have previously shown that Mce1A is indeed exposed on
the surface of M. tuberculosis.
Proteins encoded downstream of three of the four M.
tuberculosis mce operons exhibit significant sequence
homology. Similarity is confined to the 160 amino acid C-

terminal region, we have termed the Mas domain, that is
predicted to localize to the extracellular side of the cytoplasmic membrane. In each of the Actinomycetales
genomes examined, Mas domain proteins were found
linked to the majority of mce operons. Mas proteins show
absolute phylogenetic congruency with Mkl, DUF140 and
Mce proteins in the genomes of Actinomycetales, providing
evidence that they are involved in Mce transporter function. Given that Mas domains are not found associated
with all mce operons, their function may not always be
strictly required or they may be shared between operons.
The propensity of Mas homologs to be located in pairs
suggests that they form heterodimers. Such an interaction
would likely keep the predicted secreted Mas proteins
tethered to the cell surface. The domain architectures of
the Mas proteins suggest that the conserved domain plays
an accessory ligand-binding role.
Several studies have shown that the γ-proteobacterial mce
loci play a role in determination of structural properties of
the cell envelope, which in pathogenic species affects
invasive activity. In Pseudomonas putida, a transposon
insertion within the DUF140-Mce-associated ttg2A
ATPase (PP0958) renders the cells sensitive to toluene
[53]. In addition to toluene degradation and efflux, toluene tolerance is known to be mediated by increased cell
membrane rigidity resulting from changes in fatty acid
and phospholipid composition [54]. In Shigella flexneri,
mutations in the vpsABC locus (S_3453-51), encoding an
ABC transporter with the ATPase-DUF140-Mce configuration, result in a defect in intercellular spread through epithelial cell monolayers, altered colony morphology,
increased sensitivity to detergent lysis and hypersecretion
of both Sec-dependent and TypeIII-dependent virulence
proteins [55]. Carvalho et al. have reported that in Campylobacter isolates, presence of iamA, the ATPase gene of the
mce operon (Cj1646-48), correlated with an invasive phenotype [56], although, this association remains controversial [57-59]. In Neisseria meningitidis the mce-like operon,
gltT (NMB1966-64), belongs to the GdhR regulon, which
is expressed at higher levels in invasive versus commensal
isolates, and is particularly elevated in hypervirulent lineages [60].
Comparable function has been attributed to the M. tuberculosis mce1 operon. The prototypical Mce protein, M.
tuberculosis Mce1A, conferred invasive ability upon E. coli
and an M. bovis BCG mce1A mutant exhibited impaired
invasion of epithelial cells [1,61]. Moreover, an M. tuberculosis mce1 operon mutant has been shown to have an
overabundance of free mycolic acids in the outer lipid
layer (S. Cantrell, personal communication), supporting
the proposition that mce1 and related operons play a role
in remodeling the cell envelope. The presence of mce operons in Gram-negative bacteria and Actinomycetales genera

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/60

that possess a somewhat analogous outer lipid bilayer
raises the possiblity that the mce operons are involved in
maintenance of outer membrane integrity. However, their
presence in other Actinomycetales with typical Gram-positive type cell envelopes appears to preclude this hypothesis. In addition, the absence of mce operons in
Corynebacterium species indicates that their function is not
essential for maintenance of an outer lipid bilayer.
Based on a stated similarity of the ATPase component to
GluA of Corynebacterium glutamicum, Meidanis et al. [62]
proposed that the Xylella fastidiosa mce-like operon
(XF0421-19) encoded a glutamate importer. It was subsequently shown that a mutation within the homologous N.
meningitidis gltT operon resulted in impaired glutamatespecific uptake at low sodium concentrations [63]. Glutamate is a prominent constituent of peptidoglycan; thus,
disruption of its uptake in the proteobacterial mce operon
mutants could perhaps account for the observed effect on
cell envelope properties. Also relevant in this respect, is
the conserved location of the peptidoglycan biosynthetic
gene, murA, downstream of the Mce transporter genes in
γ-Proteobacteria.
Homologs of the Mkl, Mce and DUF140 proteins have
also been identified in plants [64]. The Arabidopsis
homologs of DUF140 (TGD1, At1g19800) and Mce
(TGD2, At3g20320) both localize to the inner plastid
membrane, with the Mce domain located in the intramembrane space. Lipid binding studies demonstrated
that TGD1 specifically bound 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 3phosphate (phosphatidic acid). TGD1 and TGD2 mutants
exhibited identical phenotypes consistent with disruption
of transport of ER-derived phosphatidic acid into chloroplasts, suggesting the TGD proteins form part of a lipid
translocator [65-67].
Orthologous ABC transporters are expected to be functionally equivalent [13-15], thus the proposal of both
phosphatidic acid and glutamate as possible substrates of
the Mce transporters is puzzling. It is noteworthy that in
sequence analyses, by us and others, the Mkl-like ATPases
are not closely related to GluA [8]. If the bacterial Mce
homologs have phospholipid binding function, equivalent to TGD1, this might enable interaction with host cell
membranes and explain the invasive phenotype associated with the mce loci. It is generally accepted that hostderived lipids are the primary source of carbon utilized by
M. tuberculosis in vivo [68]; however no mechanism of
lipid import has been identified. Thus it is enticing to
hypothesize that the Mce transporters might perform this
role. Inclusion of the fatty-acyl CoA synthetase, fadD5, in
the mce1 operon and repression of the operon by a FadRlike regulator, lends some support to this conjecture [45].

The canonical eight-gene mce operon has undergone
extensive proliferation and deletion events within certain
Actinomycetales lineages, most notably in Mycobacterium
and Nocardia species. The simplest explanation for the
presence of multiple mce operons is that it facilitates elevated expression. However, evidence from transcriptional
analyses of M. tuberculosis suggest that, at least in this
organism, the operons are not co-regulated [69-72]; in
addition, three of the four operons are associated with
transcriptional regulators [45,73]. In competitive mouse
infections, Sassetti and Rubin [6] found that an mce1
mutant exhibited a growth defect during the first 1–2
weeks of infection, whilst an mce4 mutant showed attenuation 3–4 weeks after inoculation. These observations
support the proposition that the operons function at different stages of infection. Differential expression of the
individual Mce transporters may reflect optimization for
substrate uptake under differing conditions, such as in the
low sodium intracellular environment; alternatively, they
might have varying substrate specificities.
The number of mce operons in individual species appears
to reflect the variety of environmental niches inhabited.
Thus, the fast-growing, typically soil-dwelling, Mycobacterium species possess the greatest number, with polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading species, isolated from
bioremediation sites, containing the most [74]. In contrast, the host-specialized, slow-growing pathogenic species possess fewer operons, and the obligate intracellular
pathogen, M. leprae, encodes a single complete mce
operon. A high degree of sequence similarity indicates
that the mce1 operon duplicated to create mce2 relatively
recently. In M. tuberculosis complex strains, mce frameshift
mutations are found conspicuously in these two operons:
of the five described in this paper, four are in mce2 and the
fifth is in mce1. This pattern may reflect the functional
divergence of the mce1 and mce2 operons.
With the exception of mycolic acids, the distribution of
morphological and chemotaxonomic traits within the
Actinomycetales is polyphyletic [75]. Given the incongruent taxonomic distribution of the mce operons and their
proposed role in integrity of the cell envelope, it is pertinent to note that presence of mce operons does not correlate with type of peptidoglycan, menaquinones,
phospholipids or fatty acids in the cell envelope [75,76].
In addition, there is no correlation with oxygen requirement, habitat or pathogenicity.

Conclusion
The available evidence suggests that the mce operons
encode a novel subfamily of ABC transporter uptake systems comprised of DUF140 permease components, Mcelike substrate-binding proteins, and Mkl-type ATPase
domains. Disruption of mce operons, in both Actinomyc-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/60

etales and Gram-negative bacteria, affects properties of the
cell envelope and associated virulence phenotypes of
pathogenic species. Empirical studies have implicated
both glutamate and phosphatidic acid as substrates of
mce-like transporters; thus, although the precise substrate
specificity of the M. tuberculosis Mce transporters remains
uncertain, we conclude that it is likely to be an organic
acid precursor of cell envelope biogenesis.

Methods
Databases
Gene annotations and protein sequences were obtained
from the publicly available databases: UniProt [77,78];
TIGR Comprehensive Microbial Resource (CMR) [79,80];
NCBI Microbial Genome Project [81]; Joint Genome
Institute Microbial Genomics Database [82]; and TubercuList [44]. Sequences are referred to by the ordered locus
name provided in these databases. Protein classification
was informed by interrogation of conserved domain and
motif databases: InterPro (IPR) [26,83], Pfam (PF)
[27,31], TIGRFAM (TIGR) [28,79], and PROSITE (PS)
[84,85]. The ABC transporter classification database,
ABCISSE, was also consulted [29].
BLAST analyses
Sequence similarity searches were performed by BLASTP
against complete microbial genome sequences deposited
in the TIGR-CMR and NCBI Microbial Genome Project
databases [79,81,86]. To determine whether the EExDA
motif identified in YrbE proteins was uniquely characteristic of the DUF140 family, we performed a BLASTP
search of NCBI Microbial Genome Project with the Actinomycetales
YrbE
consensus
motif
(PLVTGLALAGAGGAAITADLGARRIREEIDALEVMGIDPISRLVVPR) using the default parameters, except with no
filter and expect threshold of 100. To identify homologs
of the M. tuberculosis Mas domain, each of the eight
sequences was used in a PSI-BLAST query against the
NCBI non-redundant database [87]. We used an inclusion
threshold of P < 10-5 and the scores were adjusted with
composition-based statistics; these parameters resulted in
convergence after 6–8 iterations.
Multiple alignment and phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the MEGA
version 3.1 suite of programs [88]. Multiple alignments
were constructed by CLUSTAL-W using the Gonnet weight
matrix and default gap penalties [89]. Unrooted trees were
computed by the neighbor-joining method. The consensus tree, after 500 bootstrap replicates, was displayed
graphically with Tree Explorer. In addition, CLUSTAL-W
alignments were converted to PHYLIP format and trees
computed by the maximum likelihood method implemented by PROML using default parameters [90]. In all
cases this resulted in a tree with topology that was essen-

tially the same as the neighbor-joining tree generated by
MEGA. Percentage pairwise similarity scores were calculated by CLUSTAL-X [91].

Identification of conserved motifs
The MEME server was used to discover highly conserved
sequence motifs within groups of homologous proteins
[92,93]. Motifs were displayed graphically using WebLogo
[94,95].
Secondary structure and topology prediction
Groups of aligned orthologs were submitted to JPred [96],
a consensus secondary structure prediction server, that
provides improved accuracy over single sequence prediction methods [97]. Comparison of predictions between
orthologous clusters by visual inspection allowed estimation of the consensus structure for a homologous family.
Coiled-coils were predicted using the Lupas COILS algorithm through the JPred server [98].

Protein sequences were analyzed by SignalP and TatP to
identify Sec- and Tat-dependent signal sequences
[38,39,99]. The reliability of prediction of transmembrane helices and topology of proteins increases when different methods are combined [100]. Hence, we submitted
sequences to TMHMM [101,102], HMMTOP [103,104]
and TopPred [105,106], and determined the consensus
prediction by manual comparison.
