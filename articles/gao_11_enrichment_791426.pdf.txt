in a dual infection system using HIV-1
strain-specific siRNAs

Abstract
Background: Intersubtype HIV-1 recombinants in the form of unique or stable circulating recombinants forms
(CRFs) are responsible for over 20% of infections in the worldwide epidemic. Mechanisms controlling the
generation, selection, and transmission of these intersubtype HIV-1 recombinants still require further investigation.
All intersubtype HIV-1 recombinants are generated and evolve from initial dual infections, but are difficult to
identify in the human population. In vitro studies provide the most practical system to study mechanisms, but the
recombination rates are usually very low in dual infections with primary HIV-1 isolates. This study describes the use
of HIV-1 isolate-specific siRNAs to enrich intersubtype HIV-1 recombinants and inhibit the parental HIV-1 isolates
from a dual infection.
Results: Following a dual infection with subtype A and D primary HIV-1 isolates and two rounds of siRNA
treatment, nearly 100% of replicative virus was resistant to a siRNA specific for an upstream target sequence in the
subtype A envelope (env) gene as well as a siRNA specific for a downstream target sequence in the subtype D env
gene. Only 20% (10/50) of the replicating virus had nucleotide substitutions in the siRNA-target sequence whereas
the remaining 78% (39/50) harbored a recombination breakpoint that removed both siRNA target sequences, and
rendered the intersubtype D/A recombinant virus resistant to the dual siRNA treatment. Since siRNAs target the
newly transcribed HIV-1 mRNA, the siRNAs only enrich intersubtype env recombinants and do not influence the
recombination process during reverse transcription. Using this system, a strong bias is selected for recombination
breakpoints in the C2 region, whereas other HIV-1 env regions, most notably the hypervariable regions, were nearly
devoid of intersubtype recombination breakpoints. Sequence conservation plays an important role in selecting for
recombination breakpoints, but the lack of breakpoints in many conserved env regions suggest that other
mechanisms are at play.
Conclusion: These findings show that siRNAs can be used as an efficient in vitro tool for enriching recombinants,
to facilitate further study on mechanisms of intersubytpe HIV-1 recombination, and to generate replicationcompetent intersubtype recombinant proteins with a breadth in HIV-1 diversity for future vaccine studies.

Background
Recombination between two genetically distinct isolates
of the same retrovirus species was first described in the
1970s [1,2]. Retroviral recombination originates from
two different virus isolates co-infecting a single cell and
the production of heterodiploid retrovirus particles [3].
Upon de novo cell infection, reverse transcriptase jumps

between the two heterologous genomes during (-) or (+)
strand DNA synthesis and creates a chimeric proviral
genome. HIV-1 recombination is very common during
infection and may be a major evolutionary mechanism
responsible for shuffling of nucleotide substitutions
introduced by the error-prone reverse transcriptase
[4,5]. As a consequence, recombination accelerates
intrapatient HIV-1 diversity as well as evolution from
the founder virus. Within the epidemic, circulation of
HIV-1 mosaics encoded by chimeric genomes indicates
that an HIV-1 recombination must have arisen following

a primary infection with two founder viruses of different
subtypes or due to a superinfection with a different subtype virus [6-8]. The consequences of intersubtype
recombination within dual/superinfected individual can
be profound and can lead to the immediate selection of
unique recombinant forms (URFs) or subsequent transmission of stable circulating recombinant forms (CRFs)
[9]. Based on partial or full genome sequencing of HIV1 isolates from around the world, at least 20% of the 33
million infected humans harbor an intersubtype URF or
CRF [6,10,11]. For example, in East Africa, intersubtype
A/D, A/C, and D/C recombinant forms are almost as
common as the parental subtype A, C, and D [8]. These
URFs and CRFs have the potential to foil vaccine strategies based on single subtypes and even lead to rapid
drug resistance.
The mechanisms and selection of intersubtype HIV-1
recombinations in humans have been difficult to study
due to the rare occurrence of dual infection or superinfection with two of more HIV-1 isolates. Intersubtype
HIV-1 recombinants can be generated in tissue culture
using dual infections, but the parental strains generally
dominate or out-compete the very few functional
recombinant forms [12,13]. Our previous studies
described a marked decrease in the overall recombination rates in the multiple cycle tissue culture assays
(range from 0.25 to 3.4%) than in single cycle (4-17%)
or in vitro (6-30%) systems, where recombinants are
subject to selection for replicative capacity [13]. Recombination rates further decrease when utilizing divergent
primary HIV-1 isolates of different subtypes [13]. For
example, recombination frequency between two subtype
A viruses was significantly greater than between a subtype A and D virus [13]. To date the majority of studies
on HIV-1 recombination have utilized defective retroviral constructs that can recombine in select genomic
regions (introduced by cloning), but in this system,
there are no functional or replication requirements for
the generation of these recombinants [14-16]. We have
employed primary HIV-1 isolates in dual infection studies to determine the frequency of intra- and intersubtype recombination and to map crossover sites
[12,13,17]. However, in these studies, the HIV-1 recombinants may or may not be functional and only represent 0.5 to 3% of the virus population [12,13,17]. In this
study, the use of HIV-1 strain-specific siRNA can effectively enrich for recombinants by eliminating the parental virus populations, which would otherwise dominate a
dually infected culture. Previous studies have enriched
for HIV-1 recombinants between drug resistant mutations by using two different drug resistant variants and
culturing a dual infection in the presence of the two
antiretroviral drugs [18,19]. As described below, our
recombination system differs from previous studies in

Page 2 of 12

that nearly any two divergent HIV-1 strains can be
recombined (not just drug resistant variants) and in any
genomic region flanked by divergent sequences for different siRNA targets.
RNA interference (RNAi) was first described in nematodes as a specific mechanism to regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level [20]. In the case of
long dsRNA molecules, Dicer cleaves the RNA into
21bp dsRNAs, termed small interfering RNA (siRNA)
duplexes; one strand of which is then incorporated into
a ribonuclease-containing RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) [21]. The siRNA within RISC then guides
the complex to specifically target mRNAs [22]. Once
RISC has bound a mRNA bearing a matched sequence,
the mRNA can be cleaved. Sequence-specific anti-HIV-1
effects have been observed following the introduction of
synthetic siRNAs (ssiRNAs) via transfection into HIV-1permissive cells, or via endogenous expression of 21-23
nt transcripts (psiRNAs) or hairpin RNAs (pshRNAs)
from DNA plasmids [23-25]. Aside from its use as a
molecular tool, there is considerable interest in the
development of RNAi as a possible treatment or prevention strategy for HIV-1 infections as well as other viral
diseases [26].
This study examined the possible influence of siRNA
inhibition on HIV-1 replication in a dual infection and
how siRNA may be used as a tool to enrich for HIV-1
recombination in specific regions (e.g. env) of the HIV-1
genome. Several specific siRNAs were designed and
tested. They include a siRNA120a specifically targeting
upstream (C1) of env in virus v120-A, a primary
CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolate from a subtype A infected
Ugandan, and a siRNA126a specifically targeting downstream (gp41) of virus v126-D, a primary CXCR4-tropic
HIV-1 isolate from a subtype D infected Ugandan [23].
Theoretically, any RNA containing either target region
will be degraded by siRNA120a or siRNA126a; and only
recombinants not containing env region upstream of
v120-A and env region downstream of v126-D can survive, be propagated, and be enriched (Figure 1).

Results
Efficiency and specificity of siRNA inhibition on HIV-1
replication

To test the efficiency and specificity of siRNA inhibition
on HIV-1 replication, we designed four siRNAs specifically targeting the C1 region of HIV-1 v120-A (subtype
A) and two siRNAs specifically targeting the gp41 region
of v126-D (subtype D). Both HIV-1 v120-A and v126-D
strains were derived from treatment-naive HIV-1infected pediatric patients in Kampala, Uganda in 1996.
The inhibitory activity of all siRNAs was previously
tested in U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells with replication competent, primary isolate virus v120-A or v126-D by detecting

Figure 1 Schematic illustration on how siRNAs may enrich for
intersubtype HIV-1 recombinants. HIV-1 v120-A and v126-D were
used for mono- or dual-infection of U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells with equal
or different MOI in this study. This figure illustrates how two siRNAs
specific for the 5’ end of v120-A env and 3’ end of v126-D env
might enrich for v126-D/v120-A recombinants after an initial dual
infection and then propagation with siRNAs. During the initial dual
infection (panel A), v120-A and v126-D are produced from
monoinfected cells while a co-infected cell can produce a
heterodiploid virus particle containing an RNA genome from each
virus. If the heterodiploid virus infects and replicates in the initial
dually infected cultures, a v120-A/v126-D or v126-D/v120-A
recombinant virus can then be produced in the next round of
infection but it is likely in lower abundance than the parental
viruses. The five general types of virus, produced from initial dual
infection, are then used to infect fresh cells treated with siRNAs
(Panel B). In this round, siRNA120a primarily inhibits HIV-1 v120-A
whereas siRNA126a would inhibit v126-D. In addition, both siRNAs
in a single cell would block infection by a heterodiploid virus as
well as v120-A/v126-D recombinant because these two types of
viruses would be sensitive to one or both siRNAs. Because
siRNA120a targets the 5’end of v120-A env gene and siRNA126a
targets the 3’end of v126-D gene, a virus resistant to both siRNA
would harbor chimeric env genome with 5’ end/upstream region
from v126-D and a 3’ end/downstream region from v120-A. In
addition the breakpoint would have to be between the two siRNA
target sequences in the env gene.

HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity at different time
points post-infection. As previously reported, we found
that siRNA120a inhibited v120-A replication with the
greatest efficiency; siRNA120b and siRNA120c were
moderately efficient; and siRNA120d lacked significant
inhibitory activity. Similarly, siRNA126a showed greater
potency against v126-D than did siRNA126b [23]. siRNA
inhibition is sequence-specific (Figure 2C and 2D) with

Page 3 of 12

modest inhibition of HIV-1 v126-D replication even with
siRNA120a at high concentrations (20 nM) (Figure 2C).
The lack of substantial inhibition was also observed
despite only a 4 nucleotide mismatch between the siRNA126a and the envelope gene of the v120-A target
sequence (Figure 2D).
When selecting for siRNA-resistance, often a single
nucleotide substitution is sufficient to elicit resistance
[27]. When designing different siRNAs to inhibit one
versus another HIV-1 strain, a single nucleotide difference may also be sufficient, but this approach requires
considerable screening effort. Instead, we analyzed the
v120-A and v126-D sequences for sites of high genetic
diversity between the two strains and within the env
region of interest. It was best to maximize mismatches
between the strains in order to minimize cross-inhibition and possible miRNA-like repression [28].
In our previous study [23], we characterized the
mechanism and kinetics of siRNA inhibition of HIV-1.
HIV-1 inhibition by siRNA was greatest at days 4 to 5
with breakthrough starting at day 6. By day 8, virus
rebound was apparent, as is the case with monoinfections with v120-A or v126-D treated with siRNAs
(Figure 3B). However, this virus rebound was due to a
single bolus of siRNA delivered via lipofectamine followed by a slow decay. The virus that rebounded in
monoinfections with siRNA treatment is wild type with
a very low frequency of mutant virus (mutations in the
siRNA target sequence). Although siRNAs select for
HIV-1 with mutations in the siRNA target sequence, the
selected mutant virus must compete with wild type
virus that rebounds as a result of insufficient inhibition
after prolonged siRNA treatment.
siRNA inhibition was overcome by dual infection

We next examined the prolonged inhibitory effect of
siRNAs on both mono- and dual-infections (Figure 3A).
Monoinfections with v120-A and v126-D in the absence
of siRNA treatment obtained the highest levels of RT
activity within five to six days; but when treated with
specific siRNAs, the inhibition was nearly complete during this same time period (Figure 3B) [23]. The addition
of both siRNAs to the monoinfections also resulted in
nearly complete inhibition of HIV-1 v120-A or v126-D
replication (Figure 3B). Furthermore, complete inhibition of a dual v120+v126 infection (96%) was observed
at day 4 with the dual siRNA treatment (Figure 3B and
first two bars, Figure 3C). However, dual infection in
the presence of both siRNAs resulted in a more rapid
rebound in virus replication than observed in monoinfections with the specific inhibitory siRNA (Figure 3B).
By day 8, dual siRNA treatment showed minimal inhibition of dual virus production (compare v120+v126 infection +/- siRNAs; Figure 3B). In contrast, there was

Figure 2 Efficiency and specificity of siRNA-mediated inhibition of v120-A and v126-D replication. Panels A and B illustrate the specificity
of siRNA120a for the 5’ end of v120-A and of siRNA126a for the 3’ end of v126-D. As described in Gao et al. 2008 [23], these siRNAs show
specificity based on complete complementarity with the HIV-1 target sequence (nt 6415-6435 for siRNA120a and nt 8120-8140 for siRNA126a) of
the specific HIV-1 isolate. The ability of the siRNAs to inhibit v120-A and v126-D is shown in panels C and D. Panel C is a reproduction of a
previous experiment presented in Gao et al. [23] and shows the inhibition of HIV-1 v120-A and v126-D by siRNA120a. Panel D is showing the
specificity of siRNA126a for inhibition of HIV-1 v126-D as opposed to v120-A. Virus production was monitored by RT activity in supernatant at
day 5 post-infection and presented relative to the no drug control (NC) (RT values are 1937 and 1852 cpm/ml for v120-A and v126-D,
respectively). The IC50 value of siRNA120a for inhibition of v120-A was approximately 0.16 nM and 0.021 nM for the IC50 of siRNA126a for
inhibition of v126-D.

significantly less rebound at day 8 in virus production
with the monoinfections in presence of a single specific
siRNA or both siRNAs (Figure 3B). This data suggest
that rebound or “escape” from siRNA inhibition was
more evident in dual infections than in monoinfections.
Based on the experiments in Figure 3B, one hypothesis
suggests that the breakthrough observed in a dual infection and in the presence of both siRNAs may be related
to generation of heterodiploid virus (v126-D + v120-A
RNA genomes) followed by recombination (Figure 1).
A recombination event (v126-D/v120-A) with a breakpoint within env and between the siRNA target
sequences could render the virus resistant to both siRNAs (Figure 1). To explore this possibility further,
viruses produced from dual infections in the presence or
absence of siRNA were equalized for RT activity and
added to fresh U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells, again in the presence or absence of both siRNAs (Figure 3A). As
described earlier, after day 4 post dual infection in the

first round, dual siRNA treatment resulted in 96% inhibition, despite a rebound at day 8. In presence of siRNA
in the second round at day 4, there was only a 61% inhibition as compared to 96% siRNA inhibition observed in
the first round dual infection at day 4 (compare bars 4
vs 3 and 2 vs 1, Figure 3C). In the second round, this
reduced virus inhibition (with virus innoculum from
first round dual infection) is likely related to the production of heterodiploid and recombinant virus in the first
round (see below). Again, the heterodiploid virus has
the potential of recombining in env such that the resulting virus is resistant to both siRNAs targeting different
ends of the env gene. When siRNA-treated virus from
the first round was used to infect fresh cells in the second round, there was only a 21% inhibition by the dual
siRNA treatment as compared to 96% observed in the
first round (compare bars 6 vs. 5 and 2 vs. 1, Figure 3C).
Since siRNA treatment from the first round had the
potential to already select for recombinants resistant to

HIV-1 v120-A and v126-D. (A) Schematic illustration of the
monoinfections or dual infections with or without siRNA treatment
for a first round on U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells. The supernatant of this
round was monitored at days 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 for virus production
using a radiolabelled RT assay. The RT activity (cpm/ml) over this time
course with or without siRNA treatment was plotted in panel B (error
bars were removed for better viewing). For the second round
infection of panel A, virus-containing supernatants from the day 5
dual infections with or without dual siRNA treatment were equalized
for RT activity and then added to fresh U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells. RT
activity from the supernatant at day 4 from this second round
infection and the first round dual infection was plotted in panel C. In
the first round, a 96% inhibition was observed between dual virus
production without (bar 1) versus with dual siRNA treatment (bar 2).
When virus from the first round in the absence of siRNA treatment
was added to the second round infection, dual siRNA treatment
mediated a 61% inhibition (bar 4 versus 3). Finally, infection with
siRNA-treated virus from the first round resulted in only a 21%
inhibition by siRNAs in the second round (bar 6 versus 5).

siRNAs, it is not surprising that this population could be
further enriched in the second round.
HIV-1 recombinants were greatly enriched by siRNAs
treatment

In relation to the observations in Figure 3, the “breakthrough” of HIV-1 replication in the presence of potent

Page 5 of 12

dual siRNA treatment is likely due to generation of
HIV-1 intersubtype recombinants between the subtype
A v120-A and subtype D v126-D. Alternatively, siRNA
may have selected for v120-A and/or v126-D with
nucleotide substitutions in the siRNA120a and siRNA126a target sequences, respectively. If the first
hypothesis is correct, siRNA120a and siRNA126a treatment will only enrich those recombinants containing
upstream env (C1) of v126-D and downstream env
(gp41) of v120-A, which can escape siRNA targeting
and degradation. The infected U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells
were harvested at day 5 post-infection, and HIV-1 DNA
were extracted for PCR amplification employing subtype-specific oligonucleotide primers to detect, amplify,
and quantify env recombinants in HIV-1 dual infections
[12,13,17]. Here, we used subtype-specific primers
(ESD1 and ESA2) to amplify envelope fragment from
5’ v126-D/3’ v120-A env recombinants and conserved
primers (EAD1 and EAD2) to amplify both v126-D and
v120-A env genes. The specificity of the primer sets to
detect and amplify env genes of the parental and recombinant viruses was fully tested (data not shown).
The percentage of siRNA-resistant recombinants
(between the siRNA target sequences in env) was then
determined by the fraction of recombination-specific
ESD1-ESA2 PCR product divided by the parental/
recombinant (total) EAD1-EAD2 PCR products. In the
absence of siRNA treatment, the percentage of 126-D/
120-A env recombinants (11%; bar 1 in Figure 4B) generated from a dual infection was low as expected [13]. It
is important to note that the frequency of recombination was monitored a day subsequent to the measurement of maximal virus inhibition. Breakthrough
replication was already evident at day 5 in the first
round of dual infection in the presence of siRNAs (only
72% inhibition at day 5 versus 96% at day 4). As a
consequence, it is not surprising to observe a possible
selection of 126-D/v120-A env recombinants in the
siRNA-treated first round dual infection (26%; bar 2,
Figure 4B). When untreated virus from the first round
is used to infect fresh cells, the level of recombinants is
only 6.7% in absence of siRNA. Interestingly, there was
an increase in 126-D/v120-A env recombinants in the
siRNA-treated second round infection (with virus from
untreated first round) as compared to the recombinants
detected in the siRNA-treated first round (compare 41%
of bar 4 to 26% of bar 2, Figure 4B). Finally, over 96% of
the virus harbored a 126-D/120-A env , if the dual virus
infections were treated with the siRNA120a and siRNA126a for two rounds (bar 6, Figure 4B). It is important to note that HIV-specific siRNAs do not target the
reverse transcription process, but only inhibit subsequent or during mRNA synthesis [23]. Thus, preferential
replication of virus harboring the 126-D/120-A env

Schematic describing the siRNAs enrichment of v126-D/v120-A
recombinants and the PCR strategy designed for their detection
and quantification is shown in panel A. Virus 126-D and virus 120-A
env specific primers were used to PCR amplify the env recombinant
genes alongside conserved env primers amplifying all env genes
(see Materials and Methods). The viruses produced in the first and
second round infections (bars 1 through 6 in Figure 3C) were used
as templates for this PCR of the v126-D/v120-A env or all of the env
genes in the virus (i.e. v120-A + v-126-A + v126-D/v120-A + v120-A/
v126-D). A PCR control involved PCR amplification of 10-fold
dilutions of v120-A and v126-D env DNA in a DNA vector construct.

the total virus measured by semi-quantitative PCR.

represents an enrichment of recombinants resistant to
siRNAs rather than “escape” from siRNA inhibition during transcription. This siRNA-mediated enrichment to
96% recombinants could have originated from the 11%
126-D/120-A env recombinants of the replicating virus
population generated in the absence of siRNAs.
Identifying of 126-D/120-A env recombinants and
mapping recombination breakpoints

To map the site of intersubtype recombination, 30 env
clones from the untreated infections and 50 from the
two rounds siRNA-treatment were sequenced and
aligned. These analyzes revealed that only 1 out of 30
clones was a v126-D/v120-A recombinant in the

Page 6 of 12

untreated infections. In this untreated sample, the
identification of twenty-two v120-A clones and only 7
v126-D clones is consistent with the increased fitness of
v120-A (or A15-UG) virus over v126-D (or D14-UG)
virus in dual virus competition studies [29]. In the
siRNA-treated samples, the majority or 39 env clones
were v126-D/v120-A recombinants; 2 were unexpectedly
v120-A/v126-D recombinants; and 9 were v120-A
(Figure 5).
Sequence analyses revealed that recombination breakpoints were scattered throughout the env gene, but with
more recombination sites appearing in conserved
regions and with a “hotspot” in C2 (Figure 5A). Only 3
of the 39 126-D/120-A clones (or 8%) had a recombination breakpoint in the hypervariable regions (V1, V2,
V3, V4, and V5), even though these 440 nucleotides
account for 26% of the sequence in this env segment
(targeted by siRNAs). The discussion will highlight how
increased sequence conservation enhances but is not a
requirement for intersubtype HIV-1 recombination.
The hotspot in C2 has been previously described for
recombination between HIV-1 v120-A and v126-D
[12,13,17]. However, in those studies, this C2 hotspot
was observed in dual infections lacking siRNA enrichment and also in a single-cycle recombination system
without selection for replication-competent intersubtype
recombinant virus [12,13,17]. As described below, maintenance of a C2 hotspot for v126-D/v120-A recombination suggests that siRNA treatment does not alter the
distribution of recombination breakpoints. In previous
studies as in these analyzes, the frequency of intersubtype v126-D/v120-A recombination after multiple
rounds of replication was less than 5% in the absence of
siRNA selection/enrichment [13]. As a consequence,
fine mapping of recombination in the C2 hotspot was
not feasible. However, with siRNA selection, about 80%
of the replicating virus population harbors a breakpoint
within the env gene, and over 33% of these have a
breakpoint in C2. To further map the C2 breakpoints,
the C2 region was PCR amplified with an upstream
v126-specific primer paired with downstream v120-specific primer. The PCR products were cloned and
sequenced from thirty-three v126-D/v120-A C2 env
clones. These analyses revealed 12 unique breakpoints
in a 300 nt sequence in C2 (Figure 5B). Based on the
sequence identity between the C2 regions of v126-D
and v120-A, we could map breakpoints to 22 windows
varying from 1 to 25 nt in length. A window for possible
recombination is defined by identical v120-A and v126D sequence flanked by nucleotide substitutions, between
the two strains, (e.g. 5’ and 3’ of the window of
sequence identity) (see legend of Figure 5A). A specific,
more defined recombination hotspot in C2 (nt 68116873) has been characterized, but this involved mapping

siRNA120a and siRNA126a treatment, 39 of 50 sequenced clones were v126-D/v120-A recombinants with recombination breakpoints mapping
to region between the two siRNA target sequences (nt6435 to 8120). The “Legend of Graphics” provides a description of (1) site of the first nt in

specific sequences immediately following the window of recombination. (B) The fine mapping of the recombination breakpoints in the env C2
region was determined by first PCR amplifying the env PCR product with nested primers (specific for v126-D and v120-A in the C2 region),
cloning these products into pCR XL TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and then sequencing 33 clones. (C) Eleven of 50 clones did not contain a v126-D/
v120-A but nine of these were v120-A with a specific mutation in siRNA120a target sequence (nt6415 to 5435, except clone #4). Two of the 11
were v120-A/v126-D recombinants which also harbored a mutation in the siRNA120a target sequence.

breakpoint from a single cycle recombination system
using defective virus particles. It is important to note
that the use of siRNAs in a dual infection/recombination system would only enrich for breakpoints that generated functional env glycoproteins and replicating virus.
As described earlier, another form of escape from dual
siRNA inhibition in this system may involve mutations
at the siRNA target sequence rather than escape
through recombination. As described earlier, after 2
rounds of dual siRNA selection, 39 of 50 sequence
clones harbored breakpoints between the siRNA120a
and siRNA126a that target 5’ end of v120-A and 3’ end
of v126-D, respectively. The remaining 11 clones had a
complete v120-A env gene (9) or v120-A/v126-D recombinant env gene. However, 10 of these clones contained
single nucleotide substitutions in the siRNA120a target
sequence in v120-A env. These single nt substitutions,
the most predominant being T to C at position 6422
(HXB2 numbering), were likely associated with siRNA120a resistance (Figure 5C). As described below the
predominance of siRNA120a-resistant v120-A as
opposed to siRNA126a-resistant v126-D is likely due to
the increased replication of v120-A over v126-D in the
dual infections (observed in the absence of siRNA) [29].
Continual passaging of virus progeny in the presence
of siRNAs

Dual infection and A/D recombination occur at much
higher frequency (>5%/1000 nt or up to 15-20% between
the siRNA target sequences) [13] than the highest point
mutation frequency (<0.1% within the siRNA target
sequences based on 3.4 × 10 -5 mutations per nt per
cycle) [30] in the absence of selection. These findings
would suggest a greater abundance of replicating A/D
recombinants with siRNA-resistance than HIV-1 harboring siRNA point mutations immediately after dual infection. However, we have shown in our previous studies
that v120-A (or A15-UG) was significantly more fit than
v126-D (or D14-UG) which might imply that even the
v120-A/v126-D HIV-1 recombinants may be less fit
than parental v120-A. To explore this possibility, we
serially passaged the original dual infections (performed
in triplicate) in the presence of both siRNAs. By passage
8, we could not detect A/D recombinants by PCR, and
all 20 sequenced clones were indeed v120A with a single
T to C mutation at position 8 in the siRNA target
sequence (the same as the mutant clone dominant in
Figure 5C, i.e. clone16, 21, 30, 50, 51, 57, and 70). Based
on these findings it appears that v120-A, even with
these siRNA-resistant mutations, was more fit that
siRNA-resistant A/D recombinants and obviously more
fit than v126-D with any siRNA target site mutations
(which never appeared in the virus population).

Discussion
Even though intersubtype recombinants are evident in
humans co- or super-infected with two or more different HIV-1 isolates [31-35], the frequency and survival of
intersubtype HIV-1 recombinants are highly variable
during disease. The few studies on de novo emergence
of intersubtype recombination in vivo reflect the difficulties of identifying dual or super-infections at time of
actual occurrence as well as the careful follow-up
required to identify possible recombinants. As a consequence, analyses of HIV-1 recombination are quite common in vitro but are limited as a model for various
reasons. Based on in vitro studies, the frequency of retroviral recombination within the 9.7 kilonucleotides of
HIV-1 genome fluctuates between three and thirty
recombination events per round of replication and is
highly dependent on (i) cell type [36], (ii) the use of primary HIV-1 isolates [12,13,17] versus defective strains
[14-16], (iii) sequence identity between different HIV-1
strains/genomes [12,13], and (iv) selection of all recombinants [14-16] or only those that are replication competent [12,13,17,37]. Many studies including those of
our group have helped to elucidate various factors driving intersubtype recombination following infections with
a defective retrovirus harboring a heterodiploid genome
[12-16,36,37]. The most striking observations may relate
to an obvious increase in intersubtype recombination in
genomic regions with the highest sequence identity [12].
Although this might be expected, we also observed “hotspots” for intersubtype recombination breakpoints that
are less dependent on sequence identity and may be
more related to the mechanism(s) of strand transfer
during reverse transcription [13,38].
In vitro models likely identify the correct progenitors
of intersubtype recombinants, but the final composition
of intersubtype recombinants in a dually infected patient
may reflect other factors, which include the obvious
requirement of virus replication in the face of different
host and immune selective pressures. To understand
which intersubtype recombination breakpoints can lead
to replication competent virus, we had to develop a system to enrich for intersubtype HIV-1 recombinants in
tissue culture. In past studies, we have examined intersubtype recombination through a dual infection of cell
lines or primary human cells with two or more primary
HIV-1 isolates [12,13,17]. In the first round of dual
infection, the frequency of co-infected cells (with two
different viruses) reflects the initial multiplicities of
infection (MOI). For example, in a flask with 100,000
cells, an MOI of 0.01 virus A and 0.01 virus B (i.e.
1 virus per 100 cells) would result in approximately
10 cells being co-infected with both virus A and
B. However, previous reports suggest that with two

Gao et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:5
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/5

identical virus strains (aside from a marker) the frequency of dual infection is often higher than expected
from random virus-cell interactions [39]. In these coinfect cells, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and an
assumption of equal packaging of both RNA genomes
would predict that half the virus would be heterodiploid.
As virus titer of both A and B increased during multiple
rounds of replication, so would heterodiploid virus
production, but eventually all susceptible cells are
exhausted for infection in the culture. Thus, parental
viruses (e.g. A and B) always dominate a dual infection
and basically obscuring the characterization of replication-competent intersubtype HIV-1 recombinants, i.e.
present at very low levels. Adding the complexity to this
system, recombinants are only generated following a de
novo infection with a heterodiploid A+B virus. Even
though the frequency A/B cross-over event during
reverse transcription can be as high as 50% over a 9.7 nt
genome, less than 10% of these resulting intersubtype
HIV-1 recombinants survive due to generation of defective virus or simply being unable to compete with the
parental strains [13].
To focus our analyses on intersubtype recombination,
we developed a system to selectively inhibit parental
virus replication in a dual infection and as consequence,
to enrich for only intersubtype HIV-1 recombinants.
This system first involved the design and testing of
virus-specific siRNA that would not only inhibit replication of a single parental virus, but would also enrich for
intersubtype recombination in a specific HIV-1 genomic
region. For the purposes of this study, siRNA120a selectively inhibited a subtype A primary HIV-1 isolate
(v120-A) by targeting a 5’ sequence in the HIV-1 env
genes whereas a 3’ env sequence was targeted by siRNA126a to specifically inhibit a subtype D primary HIV1 isolate (v126-D). This inhibition of HIV-1 replication
by siRNAs is due to the targeting and degradation of
newly transcribed HIV-1 mRNA. We and others have
recently shown that incoming HIV-1 genome RNA is
protected by the HIV-1 core proteins and cannot be
degraded by the RISC-siRNA complex [23,40]. Destablization of the core with the exogenous addition of
TRIM5a will increase core dissociation, increase RISCsiRNA access, and result in HIV-1 RNA degradation.
However, this process is not activated in normal conditions of human cell lines [23]. Based on siRNA degradation of only HIV-1 mRNA and following reverse
transcription, our dual siRNA treatment would not
influence the retroviral recombination mechanism but
only select for those intersubtype D/A recombinants
with breakpoints that occurred at a frequency of >5%/
1000 nt in the env gene [13] and up to 15-20% between
the siRNA target sequences. These D/A env recombinants could be propagated and enriched in culture

Page 9 of 12

considering they are resistant to the siRNA inhibition of
HIV-1 mRNA transcription, again at a step subsequent
to reverse transcription and integration. As illustrated in
Figure 4B, D/A env recombinant virus became the
majority of replicating virus when treated with the two
siRNAs during two rounds of propagation. In absence of
this siRNA enrichment/selection, D/A env recombinant
virus represented only 6.7% of the replicating virus
population, which was dominated by the parental
v120-A and/or v126-D virus.
The frequencies of recombination in these propagated
dual infections were initially estimated by PCR amplification using isolate-specific oligonucleotide primers.
However, due to non-specific amplification, these
recombination frequencies were likely over-estimates.
To determine a more accurate level of recombination
and more importantly, to map the site of recombination,
the dual infections propagated in the presence or
absence of siRNAs were PCR amplified with conserved
env primers. Cloning and sequencing of these env products revealed that D/A recombinants could hardly be
detected in the absence of siRNAs, but that dual siRNA
treatment resulted in 39 v126-D/v120-A recombinants
in 50 env clones. Interestingly, the remaining clones
were v120-A or v120-A/v126-D env genes, and 10/11
harbored mutations in the siRNA120a target sequence.
We suspect that the mutations in this target sequence
conferred resistance to the siRNA120a and as consequence would be resistant to both siRNAs. Predominance of v120-A with siRNA120a resistant mutations as
opposed to v126-D with siRNA126a mutations likely
relates to the increased fitness of v120-A over v126-D in
these dual infections [29]. In fact, we did not observe
v126-D/v120-A recombinants after eight rounds of dual
siRNA selection, but instead v120-A dominated with a
single mutation in the siRNA120a target sequence. We
are now determining how dual infections with viruses of
equal or different fitness might influence (1) the frequency of recombination, (2) the rate of intersubtype
recombinant viruses in the presence of dual siRNA
treatment, and possibly, (3) the sites of recombination
breakpoints.
Our previous studies indicated that intersubtype
recombination breakpoints were scattered across conserved regions, i.e. C1, C2, and C3, using a single cycle
assay [12,13]. As mentioned earlier, the multiple cycle
assay in the absence of siRNA enrichment results in a
very low level of recombinants co-circulating with the
parental strains in culture. As a result, we suspect that
the pattern of v126-D/v120-A recombination in our previous multiple-cycle/dual infection assays may be the
result of some re-sampling of recombinant clones [12].
In addition, obtaining replication-competent recombinants from the dual infection was less likely in the

Gao et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:5
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/5

absence of siRNA enrichment due to the continuous
generation of both defective and replication-competent
recombinants and the ongoing parental strain replication. In the study presented herein, use of dual siRNA
treatment inhibited the replication of parental strains,
and only 126D/120A recombinants were likely to survive two rounds of propagation. In addition, we examined recombination sites across most of the env gene
(~1700 nt) (this study) as opposed to just the C1-C4
regions (~1100 nt) [12]. Nearly identical numbers of
recombination breakpoints were identified in the C2
region as compared to other C1-C4 regions regardless
of system, i.e. 45% 126D/120A recombination breakpoints in C2 with single cycle system versus 46% with
multiple cycle [12] and 48% with multiple cycle in the
presence of siRNA enrichment (this study). The differences relates to the positioning of the breakpoints in
C2. Replication-competent 126D/120A recombinant
viruses appeared to harbor more breakpoints near the
V2/C2 junction than those from single cycle assays. Due
to the siRNA enrichment, we could now perform more
careful mapping of the 126D/120A breakpoints in the
C2 region of env. It is now quite clear that recombination in C2 maps to two specific regions, nt positions
6813-6873 and nt positions 6938-7005. The C2 region is
299 nt in length and yet, aside from these 60 and 67 nt
segments, the remaining 172 nt have nearly no recombination breakpoints. These findings clearly indicate that
pattern of breakpoints in intersubtype HIV-1 recombinants is shaped by both the reverse transcription process
and during subsequent selection for replication competent virus.
Although numerous selective forces could influence
selection of these intersubtype HIV-1 recombinants
within a host, several studies have now shown a clear
overlap in the recombination breakpoints derived from
intersubtype HIV-1 recombinants generated in tissue
culture with those identified in unique and circulating
intersubtype recombinant forms (URFs and CRFs) found
in the HIV-1 epidemic [12,17,38]. Considering that
HIV-1 intersubtype recombinants represent approximately 20% of all infections, vaccines and new drug
therapies could be designed based on a better understanding of strand transfer mechanisms during reverse
transcription and the actual breakpoints that give rise to
functional, replication competent virus. It is also apparent that intersubtype HIV-1 recombination, following a
dual infection or superinfection of already infected individual, could lead to rapid immune escape. A simple
comparison of our A/D env sequences with HIV-1 epitope maps, restricted by common HLA alleles (http://
www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/immunology/maps/ctl/gp160.
html), revealed that 30/39 of the clones had recombination breakpoints within immunodominant epitopes.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a method to rapidly
enrich for HIV-1 recombinants by blocking each of two
parental HIV-1 isolates in a dual infection with strainspecific siRNAs. Using this approach, we could easily
detect, map, and characterize intersubtype breakpoints
in the HIV-1 env gene. Nearly 33% of all v126-D/v120A recombination sites in env mapped to two ~60 nt
sequence in the C2 regions (0.27 recombination sites/nt)
whereas the remaining 67% were scattered 1700 nt
C1-to-gp41 region of env (0.05 recombination sites/nt).
It was paramount to prove that our methods used
to enrich recombinants generated a similar pattern
of intersubtype A/D breakpoints as those previous
observed in our A+D dual infections, but in absence of
siRNA selection. If siRNA enrichment skewed the distribution of recombination breakpoints, this methodology
would not have been useful as a model of in vivo intersubtype recombination. This system now provides a
high population of replication-competent intersubtype
recombinants (~80%) whereas dual infection without
siRNA selection generates less than 2% recombinants
[13], the majority of which are not replication competent [37]. Dual infection coupled with a siRNA enrichment/selection is now being used to rapidly diversify
HIV-1 gene segments and even whole genomes. The
replication competent, recombinant viruses can be used
for heterogeneous vaccine constructs or a swarm of
divergent viruses for drug inhibition/resistance studies.
Methods
Cell culture

PBMCs from HIV-1 seronegative donors were separated
from heparinized blood by Ficoll-Paque density centrifugation and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Mediatech,
Inc.) supplemented with L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS, Mediatech, Inc.), 10 mM HEPES buffer,
penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 1 U of
phytohemagglutinin/ml, and 1 ng of interleukin-2
(Gibco)/ml. The cells were suspended (2 × 106 cells/ml)
and grown for 3 days in culture before use in virus propagations. U87.CD4.CXCR4 and U87.CD4.CCR5 cell
lines were obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program and grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Cellgro) supplemented
with 15% FBS, penicillin and streptomycin, puromycin
(1 μg/ml) and G418 sulfate (1 mg/ml) at 37°C and 5%
CO2.
Viruses

v120-A (subtype A, CXCR4 tropic) and v126-D (subtype
D, CXCR4 tropic) were obtained from two treatmentnaive HIV-1-infected pediatric patients in Kampala,
Uganda in 1996. The viruses were isolated and propagated

Gao et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:5
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/5

by co-culturing PBMCs from the patients and from
healthy donors. Prior to co-culture, PBMC were pre-stimulated with PHA and cultured with IL-2 as described
above. TCID50 assays (tissue culture dose for 50% infectivity) were performed to determine virus titer [41]. Titers
were expressed as infectious units per milliliter.
SiRNAs preparation

Twenty-one-nucleotide dsRNAs were chemically synthesized as 2’ bis(acetoxyethoxy)-methyl ether-protected,
desalted and duplexed oligonucleotides by Dharmacon
(Lafayette, Colo.). Six siRNAs (siRNA120a, siRNA120b,
siRNA120c, siRNA120d, siRNA126a, and siRNA126b)
were designed according to both the manufacturer’s
recommendations and to the env sequences of v120-A
and v126-D. These siRNAs were previously utilized in
another study to characterize the mechanism(s) of
siRNA inhibition of HIV-1 [23]. According to HXB2
numbering, siRNA120 is located at nt 6415-6435 or nt
6400-6420 in the C1 region of the env gene in v120-A,
and siRNA126 is located at nt 8120-8140 or nt 86048624 in gp41 coding region of the env gene in v126-D.
Control siRNAs vary from 1 to 5 nucleotide differences.
The efficiency of siRNAs were tested as described
previously [23].
SiRNA inhibition efficiency on HIV-1 dual infection

One × 105 U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells were plated in 24-well
plates, and 48 hours later, infected with 0.1 multiplicity
of infection (MOI) of HIV-1 v120-A or v126-D, or with
both viruses. The supernatants were harvested from different time points postinfection for monitoring the virus
production. After the initial dual infection, the viruscontaining supernatant from day 5 of the dual infection
was used to infect fresh, untreated U87.CD4.CXCR4
cells or cells transfected with 20 nM of siRNA120a and/
or siRNA126a by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as
previously described [23]. Supernatant from this second
round infection was replaced with fresh media after 6
hours incubation. Supernatant was then collected at day
4 to 10 post infection. The supernatants from the first
round infection (in the presence or absence of siRNAs)
were then used for a second round infection with the
same protocol described for the first round. Virus levels
in the supernatants for all these experiments were monitored by RT assay as previously described [41].
Semi-quantitative PCR detecting of the frequency of
HIV-1 recombinants

Isolate-specific primers were designed for amplification
of 126-D/120-A env recombinants: ESD1 (sense, nt64076426 in HXB2) and ESA2 (antisense, nt8133-8114). Two
conserved primers, i.e. EAD1 (sense, nt6427-6444) and

Page 11 of 12

EAD2 (antisense, nt8082-8064), were used to amplify
both HIV-1 recombinants and their parental viruses.
Proviral DNA was extracted from the infected U87.CD4.
CXCR4 cells using the QIAamp DNA blood kit (Qiagen)
and serially diluted (1:10, 1:100, 1:1000, 1:10000) for semiquantitative PCR as previously described [23]. PCR products of HIV-1 recombinant and overall HIV-1 DNA were
analyzed on agarose gel for measuring the frequency of
HIV-1 recombinants in the virus population.
Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses

The above PCR-amplified env products were separated
on agarose gels and then purified using the Gel Purification Kit (Qiagen), followed by ligation into pCR XL
TOPO vector. Env-containing pCR XL TOPO clones
were sequenced with EAD1, E80, and EAD2 (Davis
sequencing). The env recombinant sequences and parental virus sequences were aligned using the CLUSTAL X
v.1.63b program [42]. After sequencing of the recombinant clones, breakpoints were identified by visual
inspection. Accuracy of breakpoint location is related to
the length of the region between mismatches.
