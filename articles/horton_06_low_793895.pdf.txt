Abstract
Background: Chromium is a transition metal most commonly found in the environment in its
trivalent [Cr(III)] and hexavalent [Cr(VI)] forms. The EPA maximum total chromium contaminant
level for drinking water is 0.1 mg/l (0.1 ppm). Many water sources, especially underground sources,
are at low temperatures (less than or equal to 15 Centigrade) year round. It is important to
evaluate the possibility of microbial remediation of Cr(VI) contamination using microorganisms
adapted to these low temperatures (psychrophiles).
Results: Core samples obtained from a Cr(VI) contaminated aquifer at the Hanford facility in
Washington were enriched in Vogel Bonner medium at 10 Centigrade with 0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400
and 1000 mg/l Cr(VI). The extent of Cr(VI) reduction was evaluated using the diphenyl carbazide
assay. Resistance to Cr(VI) up to and including 1000 mg/l Cr(VI) was observed in the consortium
experiments. Reduction was slow or not observed at and above 100 mg/l Cr(VI) using the
enrichment consortium. Average time to complete reduction of Cr(VI) in the 30 and 60 mg/l Cr(VI)
cultures of the consortium was 8 and 17 days, respectively at 10 Centigrade. Lyophilized
consortium cells did not demonstrate adsorption of Cr(VI) over a 24 hour period. Successful
isolation of a Cr(VI) reducing organism (designated P4) from the consortium was confirmed by 16S
rDNA amplification and sequencing. Average time to complete reduction of Cr(VI) at 10
Centigrade in the 25 and 50 mg/l Cr(VI) cultures of the isolate P4 was 3 and 5 days, respectively.
The 16S rDNA sequence from isolate P4 identified this organism as a strain of Arthrobacter
aurescens, a species that has not previously been shown to be capable of low temperature Cr(VI)
reduction.
Conclusion: A. aurescens, indigenous to the subsurface, has the potential to be a predominant
metal reducer in enhanced, in situ subsurface bioremediation efforts involving Cr(VI) and possibly
other heavy metals and radionuclides.

Background
Chromium is a transition metal most commonly found in
the environment in its trivalent (Cr3+) and hexavalent
(Cr6+) forms [1]. Naturally occurring Cr is almost exclusively in the trivalent state, as the energy required for its
oxidation is high. Hence, the hexavalent form is usually
considered to be a man-made product [2]. The toxicities
of the two forms of chromium are vastly different. Trivalent chromium is generally a nontoxic, nonmobile micronutrient [3]. Hexavalent chromium is water soluble, toxic,
and carcinogenic, and is considered a pollutant by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
[4]. Chromium is the second most common inorganic
contaminant of groundwater at hazardous waste sites [5].
The solubility and negative charge of its more common
forms, chromate and dichromate (CrO42-, and HCrO4-),
lead to limited adsorption in aquifer minerals, and results
in high mobility of Cr6+ in aquifers [6]. The historical and
present day contamination of groundwater and soils by
Cr6+ is a result of its industrial uses, including metal plating (for corrosion resistance), pigment production, and
lumber and wood products (for preservation) [7].
Many water sources are at low temperatures year round
(≤15°C) and it is important to evaluate the possibility of
remediating Cr6+ contamination using microorganisms
adapted to these low temperatures (psychrophiles). Limitations of bioremediation processes at low temperatures
have been described in the past as having slow biomass
build-up rates, slow degradation and low loads [8]. Furthermore, many bioremediation processes depend on
anaerobic Cr6+ reduction and it is commonly believed that
anaerobic bioreactors are particularly hard to operate at
ambient groundwater temperatures [8]. Recent efforts
have tested the possibilities for aerobic and anaerobic low
temperature bioremediation of contaminants other than
Cr6+ including biostimulation and bioaugmentation [911].
To date, there have been few reports of psychrophilic Cr6+reducing organisms [12]. Mesophilic genera capable of
Cr6+ reduction include: Acinetobacter [13], Aerococcus [14],
Aeromonas [14], Aspergillus [15], Bacillus [16], Corynebacterium [17], Deinococcus [18], Desulfomicrobium [19], Desulfovibrio [20], Enterobacter [21-23], Escherichia [24,25],
Microbacterium [26], Micrococcus [14], Ochrobactrum [13],
Pseudomonas [27-29], Rhodobacter [30], Shewanella [31],
Staphylococcus [32], Streptomyces [33], Vibrio [34], and
Zoogloea [35]. Since mesophilic Cr6+ reduction can proceed both aerobically and anaerobically [36], it is reasonable to assume that psychrophilic reductions will also
proceed both aerobically and anaerobically. Most studies
referenced were performed at temperatures at or above
20°C. The single low temperature (10°C) study involving
a soil community and varying electron acceptors yielded

significant reduction of Cr6+ [12]. To the best of our
knowledge, no low temperature groundwater studies (saturated zone of aquifer) on the reduction of Cr6+ have been
performed. The use of indigenous psychrophilic microorganisms may provide insight into many of the problems
associated with low temperature remediation.
This study used samples obtained from a Cr6+ (~1.3 mg/l)
contaminated site within the Hanford aquifer http://
www.hanford.gov/ as inocula from which indigenous
psychrophilic microorganisms were cultured and tested
for their ability to reduce Cr6+ to levels below the required
EPA minimum. Identification of psychrophilic Cr-reducing community members will allow future studies of
remediation possibilities using indigenous populations at
other sites as well as help guide the search for other closely
related psychrophilic microorganisms for use in remediating Cr6+ present in low temperature environments.

Results
Enrichments
Enrichments with Cr6+ concentrations from 0 to 400 mg/l
showed growth in the form of turbidity (cell density
approximately 108/mL) at 10°C. Subsequent transfers of
cultures to like concentrations of Cr6+-containing media
also produced turbidity. Clearing of the VB broth (addi-

tion of chromate turned the broth yellow) to colorless or
pale white and formation of a white precipitate occurred
in the 30 and 60 mg/l Cr6+ concentration enrichments and
in a preliminary reduction study, but not in the uninoculated controls. Enrichments attempted in media containing Cr6+ concentrations of >1000 mg/L grew poorly.
Consortium reduction experiments
All enrichment cultures showed evidence of Cr6+ removal
as the decolorization of media (from yellow to clear) and
measurement of the decreasing Cr6+ concentration by the
diphenyl carbazide assay. Standards and controls in each
of the experiments were used to compare the amount of
Cr6+ left in the media at approximately 48 hour intervals.
No reduction was observed in cell-free controls. The overall averages and standard deviations of the three samples
taken from each of the triplicate tubes in the three serial
reduction experiments are represented by data provided
in Figure 1. The enrichments containing 30 mg/l Cr6+ were
completely reduced in approximately 8 days at 10°C and
the 60 mg/l Cr6+ proceeded to zero in less than 17 days at
10°C.
Isolations
In order to select for organisms that were both resistant to
Cr6+ and able to reduce Cr6+, the original enrichments
were performed at high levels of Cr6+. Streaking for isolation on VB plates (without Cr6+) from a 1000 mg/l Cr6+
liquid enrichment yielded an isolate (designated P4).
Isolate reduction experiments
Isolate P4 cultures showed evidence of Cr6+ removal in VB
media as the decolorization of media (from yellow to
clear) and measurement of the decreasing Cr6+ concentration by the diphenyl carbazide assay similar to the consortium reduction experiments. Standards and controls in
each of the experiments were used to compare the amount
of Cr6+ left in the media at approximately 12 hour intervals. P4 grew poorly in VB media without the addition of
Cr6+. No reduction was observed in the cell-free controls.
The overall averages and standard deviations of the three
samples, taken from each of the triplicate tubes in the
three serial reduction experiments, are represented by data
provided in Figure 2. The enrichments containing 25 mg/
l Cr6+ were completely reduced in less than 72 hours at
10°C and the 50 mg/l Cr6+ proceeded to zero in less than
120 hours at 10°C.
Consortium adsorption experiments
Cr6+ removal was not evidenced in adsorption experiments. Consortium cells suspended in deionized water
and Cr6+ retained the yellow color of Cr6+-contaminated
media. Concentrations of Cr6+ were statistically
unchanged by the end of the 24 hour period as measured

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/5

using the diphenyl carbazide assay. Temperature did not
affect the adsorption experiments.
16S rDNA Identification and phylogenetic analysis of
isolate P4
PCR amplification and subsequent sequencing yielded an
approximately 1.5 kbp DNA fragment consistent with the
expected length of the amplification product. A fragment
of 1373 unambiguous bases was used in the search and
analysis of related microorganisms. Ribosomal Database
Project and Genbank database searches both resulted in
the high sequence homology (1369/1373 bases) to
Arthrobacter aurescens. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis
also revealed the isolate to be a strain of A. aurescens (Figure 3).

Discussion
This study demonstrates that indigenous microbial populations present in Cr6+-contaminated aquifers are able to
aerobically catalyze the removal of toxic and soluble Cr6+
from the media, most likely reducing it to the relatively
nontoxic and insoluble Cr3+. The absence of Cr6+ in the
media, in addition to the lack of adsorption demonstrated
by the three separate adsorption experiments, suggests the
Cr6+ was reduced to the less toxic Cr3+ form. Further experimentation with cell lysates of P4 at 18°C showed Cr6+reduction activity in the soluble protein fraction, not the
membrane bound protein fraction, also suggesting enzymatic reduction (data not shown). The low temperature
(10°C) used in the experiments and the timeline for the
reductions also suggests that Cr6+ can be remediated in a
reasonable amount of time at the low environmental temperatures present in many aquifers. In comparison, a mesophilic isolate from another study, Arthrobacter
crystallopoites strain ES 32 [37,38] reported a lower rate of
chromate reduction at 30°C when compared to isolate P4
at 10°C. Interestingly, ES 32 had a higher temperature
optimum for Cr6+ reduction than for optimal cell growth
[38]. The lack of previous low temperature studies is
clearly demonstrated by a search of the literature in which
only a single paper by Tseng and Bielefeldt [12] on the low
temperature biotransformation of hexavalent chromium
in soil is found.
Both the consortium and P4 isolate cultures were shown
to grow and reduce Cr6+ at 10°C. Significant biomass of
the P4 isolate could be generated within 2 days of growth
in R2 broth at 10°C (cell densities of 108/ml). Studies
using mesophilic microorganisms from genera such as
Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Escherichia [16,28,39] all
required incubation at temperatures well above those
used in this study and those found in the aquifer environment we are targeting for bioremediation.

could be useful in bioremediation using nutrient addition.

A number of studies suggest both growth-dependent and
growth-independent chromium reduction [20,29,40]. In
either case, chromium reduction does seem to be biomass
dependent in our study as well as in others [21,41]. The
lag at the beginning of the consortium reduction experiments as well as observations of increased turbidity
throughout the experiments suggests that adequate cell
biomass must be produced before reduction begins in earnest. Bopp and Ehrlich [28] showed that higher concentrations (1000 mg/l) of Cr6+ produced a much longer lag
phase and a significantly lower final yield of biomass than
lower concentrations. The reduced biomass would also
contribute to the lack of complete reduction found at
higher concentrations in many studies [22,25] as well as
in the higher concentrations tested in our lab (data not
shown). Previous studies using cellular biomass grown on
uncontaminated substrates to test Cr6+ reduction greatly
decreased the amount of time required to completely
reduce Cr6+ [21,39], similar to our findings with the isolate P4 reduction experiments (Figure 2). Increased turbidity after only 24 hours in R2 broth at 10°C (grown
aerobically) and the achievement of stationary phase (as
determined by absorbance readings, 1:10 dilution in R2
broth, OD = 0.16) after 3 days suggests that P4 is relatively
fast growing. P4 grew at 10, 18, and 25°C but not at 37°C
suggesting the isolate is a true psychrophile. Growth
appeared fastest at 18°C. The ability to increase biomass
in a short time given the proper nutrients suggests that P4

The enrichment culture and isolate P4 consistently
reduced Cr6+ in VB medium up to concentrations of 60
mg/l Cr6+. Higher concentrations seemed to inhibit reduction, although growth was slower but still observed as turbidity in the enrichments (data not shown). Dilution of
the Cr6+ at 1000 mg/L may have affected the limited range
of the diphenyl carbazide assay, causing the appearance of
the lack of reduction at higher concentrations. Both the
consortium and isolate P4 showed significant tolerance of
Cr6+ up to concentrations of 1000 mg/l (data not shown)
as well as measurable reduction over short periods of time
at concentrations up to 60 mg/l Cr6+. This tolerance is
greater than or comparable to most mesophilic microorganisms tested, such as Pseudomonas fluorescens at 53.5
mg/l [27] and Bacillus sp. at 500 mg/l [42]. Furthermore,
the isolate P4 and consortium reductions presented here
occurred at temperatures close to 30°C lower than in the
studies using mesophilic organisms, suggesting that the
enzyme(s) responsible for the reduction are truly coldactive.
Complete reduction was observed in all experiments
(both consortium and isolate P4) with concentrations of
Cr6+ up to 60 mg/l (Figures 1&2) suggesting that complete
reduction in the environment is also possible. The lack of
reduction in the sterile controls along with the lack of Cr6+
adsorption to cell biomass in the three adsorption experiments suggests that the members of the enrichment community (which included isolate P4) were responsible for
the reduction of Cr6+. Since most aquifers contaminated
with Cr6+ have levels below 60 mg/l, these experiments
would also suggest remediation of the lower levels of Cr6+
contamination present in aquifers is possible. Bioremediation literature suggests low levels of contamination are
very difficult to completely remediate. Lack of induction
of enzyme systems at low contaminant concentrations
and problems with availability of contaminants bound to
organics and sequestered in other matrices all contribute
to persistence of contaminants in the environment. It has
also been suggested that indigenous microorganisms may
be more successful in reducing low contaminant concentrations [8]. The complete reduction of Cr6+ at 10°C in
this study using an indigenous member of the Hanford
microbial community and past studies with indigenous
mesophilic microorganisms suggest that there are environmental candidates for reduction of the low levels of
contamination usually found in aquifers [23,43].
Studies have shown Arthrobacter species adsorbing Fe, Cd,
and Cu, but not Cr [44,45]. Chromium has, however,
been shown to adsorb to both Shewanella and Bacillus species [46]. Adsorption studies performed on the Hanford

ceeded at a rate 5.5 times faster than ES 32 at 30°C (0.72
mg/L/h and 0.13 mg/L/h respectively, calculated using the
linear portion of the reduction curve for both organisms).
As for Cr6+ resistance, isolate P4 tolerated up to 1000 mg/
L Cr6+ while isolate ES 32 was from a group that had low
tolerance above 500 mg/L Cr6+ [37]. Within these comparisons, isolate P4 is more resistant and reduces higher concentrations of Cr6+at a significantly faster rate.
In the current study, the identification of isolate P4 as a
strain of A. aurescens was performed via 16S rDNA
sequencing with comparison to sequences found in the
Ribosomal Database Project and the GenBank database at
NCBI. To the best of our knowledge, the species A. aurescens has not been previously associated with Cr6+ reduction.

Considering the ubiquity of organisms in the genus
Arthrobacter, we suggest further exploration of the in situ
metal reduction potential of this under-studied genus.
Resistance and tolerance of Arthrobacter spp. have been
demonstrated to a wide variety of heavy metals including
mercury, chromium, lead, nickel and copper [48,49].
That, together with Arthrobacter's ability to reduce Cr6+ and
other toxic metals, indicates that Arthrobacter spp. indigenous to the subsurface have potential to be useful metal
reducers in enhanced, in situ, subsurface bioremediation
efforts involving Cr6+ and other heavy metals and radionuclides.

Methods
consortium in our laboratory (which included the isolate
P4) did not show significant removal of Cr6+ due to
adsorption. Three separate adsorption studies used killed
(autoclaved) cells, metabolically inhibited live cells, or
lyophilized cells. None of these studies showed significant
adsorption of Cr6+ within 24 hours of Cr6+ addition.
These, along with studies showing activity in the soluble
fraction of lysate, suggest enzymatic reduction.
A few Arthrobacter species, like A. oxydans and A. crystallopoites strain ES32 have been noted previously to reduce
Cr6+ [37,47]. Identification of A. oxydans to the species
level in the previous study was performed via Fatty Acid
Methyl Ester (FAME) analysis, while ES 32 was characterized by 16S rDNA sequencing. Carmargo et al. [37]
showed ES 32 to have its optimum Cr6+ reduction in a
temperature range of 30–35°C, but did not test its Cr6+
reduction rates below 25°C. P4, by comparison, grew well
and reduced Cr6+ at 10°C at a faster rate than ES 32 at 30–
35°C. Further comparison of the two organisms (P4 and
ES 32) reveals a much lower starting concentration of Cr6+
for the reduction studies using ES 32 (1.04 mg/L [38] and
2.0 mg/L [37]). Reduction of Cr6+ using P4 at 10°C pro-

Sampling, enrichment and isolation
A core from the saturated zone of the Ringold Formation
at 25.9 meters below ground surface was obtained from a
Cr6+ contaminated area on the U.S. Department of
Energy's Hanford facility. The concentration of Cr6+ in the
aquifer was 1.49 mg/l. The core (10.2 cm diameter) was
collected in a polycarbonate liner and shipped refrigerated in an argon-filled, air-tight paint can. Upon receipt,
the core was refrigerated until it was aseptically pared to
expose uncontaminated, internal regions that served as
inocula for the experiments described below.

A 4.9 g Hanford aquifer core sample was mixed with 10
ml of Vogel Bonner (VB) broth [27]. Enrichments and isolations proceeded in the manner described by Fries et al.
[50] using VB broth and plates. All enrichments and
reductions were performed aerobically at 10°C, with
shaking (250 rpm). The isolates were labeled P2 (orange),
P3 (off-white), and P4 (pale yellow), and the possible pair
was labeled P1a&b (white colonies in the beginning and
pink colonies developing over time). Preliminary Cr6+
reduction observations of the three isolates in VB broth
with 30 mg/l Cr6+ revealed that only isolates P3 and P4

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/5

completely reduced 30 mg/l Cr6+ in less than 60 days. Isolate P4 was observed to remove Cr6+ faster than P3 and
was consequently chosen for the isolate Cr6+ reduction
experiments. Isolation was confirmed via 16S identification as described below.

Adsorption studies were conducted aerobically at 4, 10,
18 and 37°C, with shaking (250 rpm). Concentrations of
Cr6+were analyzed by the diphenyl carbazide assay
described below. Adsorption experiments were assayed in
triplicate.

Consortium and isolate reduction experiments
Both consortium and isolate P4 reduction experiments
were conducted aerobically at 10°C, with shaking (250
rpm) and in triplicate. Consortium reductions consisted
of 3 concentrations of Cr6+ (0, 30, 60 mg/l final concentration) in 4.75 ml of VB broth. Final Cr6+ concentrations (0,
30, 60 mg/l) were achieved using a 100× stock solution of
Cr6+ (3.735 g Cr6+ in 10 ml distilled H2O). The inocula
consisted of 250 µl of stationary phase enrichment culture
(108/ml) bringing the total volume for each tube to 5 ml.

Diphenyl carbazide assay
A diphenyl carbazide assay for measurement of Cr6+ was
developed from Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater [51] as well as the methods listed
in Turick et al. [52] with the following modifications.
ChromaVer (diphenyl carbazide reagent) was obtained
from Hach (Loveland, CO). Absorbance readings for
reduction cultures and Cr6+ standards of 0, 25, 50, 100
mg/l were recorded approximately every 48 hours for consortium cultures and every 12 hours for isolate cultures.

Isolate reductions each consisted of 3 concentrations of
Cr6+: 0, 25, 50 mg/l in 5 ml of VB broth. Cellular biomass
was first established by growing isolate P4 in R2 broth
(Bacto Yeast Extract, 0.5 g L-1; Bacto Proteose Peptone #3,
0.5 g L-1; Bacto Casamino Acids, 0.5 g L-1; Bacto Dextrose,
0.5 g L-1; Soluble Starch, 0.5 g L-1; Sodium Pyruvate, 0.3 g
L-1; Dibasic Potassium Phosphate, 0.3 g L-1; Magnesium
Sulfate, 0.05 g L-1) to stationary phase (OD = 0.15 at 600
nm 1:10 dilution in R2 broth). Cells were then centrifuged at 5,000 × g in a Sorvall microcentrifuge (Kendro
Laboratory Products, Asheville, NC) and resuspended in
VB broth.

DNA extractions
DNA was extracted from the isolate grown in VB broth.
DNA extractions were performed using the Puregene DNA
Isolation Kit (Gentra systems, Minneapolis, MN). Manufacturer's instructions for Gram Positive bacteria DNA
extraction were used with the following changes: cells
were pelleted by centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 5 minutes;
lysis was performed at 90°C for 10 minutes; lysate was
treated with RNase for 60 minutes; lysate was vortexed on
low speed after protein precipitation solution was added
and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 minutes; DNA was precipitated with 100% isopropanol at -20°C overnight and
then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 minutes; DNA was
then washed with ice cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged
again at 16,000 × g for 5 minutes; ethanol was removed
with a pipetter and the DNA was allowed to air dry at
37°C; DNA was re-hydrated by adding 100 µl molecular
biology grade water and incubating overnight.

Cell-free controls and Cr6+ standards (0, 25, 50, 100 mg/
l) were used as the baseline for detecting Cr6+ reduction.
Reduction was detected via the diphenyl carbazide assay
(described below), measuring remaining Cr6+. All samples
from the reduction cultures were assayed in triplicate,
resulting in nine readings for each concentration. Averages and standard deviations were calculated using the
spreadsheet program Excel (Microsoft) and graphed using
CoPlot (CoHort Software V.6.2).
Consortium Cr6+ adsorption experiments
To confirm that observed decreases in Cr6+ concentrations
were due to reduction and not biosorption, three separate
adsorption studies were conducted using killed cells
(autoclaved), metabolically inhibited cells, and lyophilized cells. All cells were suspended in deionized water to
limit metabolic activity. Live and killed (autoclaved) cells
were obtained at stationary phase, centrifuged at 5,000 ×
g for 20 minutes, washed, centrifuged (Jouan, Thermo
Electron Corp.) and resuspended in an equal amount of
deionized water. Lyophilized cells (0.3 g) were suspended
in 150 ml deionized water and allowed to rehydrate for
one hour before use. Chromate concentrations were
achieved using 100× stock solution of Cr6+.

PCR for 16S identification
PCR amplification for 16S identification was performed
as described by Sheridan et.al. [53]. Fragments were then
sent for sequencing on an ABI cycle sequencer at the
Molecular Research Core Facility (Idaho State University,
Pocatello, ID). Fragments were sequenced in both directions.
Alignment and phylogenetics
The final contiguous sequence of 1373 base pairs was
used to search both the Ribosomal Database Project http:/
/rdp.cme.msu.edu/
and
Genbank
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ databases. Sequence fragments
were aligned and analyzed as described in Sheridan et.al.
[53]. The GenBank accession number for the 16S rRNA
gene of isolate P4 is GenBank:DQ016989.
