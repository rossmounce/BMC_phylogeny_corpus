duplication suggests functional diversification

Abstract
Background: Because of their known role as transcriptional regulators of key plant developmental processes, the
diversification of MADS-box gene function is thought to be a major driving force in the developmental evolution of
plants. Yet the function of some MADS-box gene subfamilies has remained elusive thus far. One such lineage, AGL6, has
now been functionally characterized in three angiosperm species, but a phylogenetic framework for comparison of
AGL6 gene function is currently missing.
Results: Based on phylogenetic analyses of newly isolated and EST-based sequences, we describe the duplication
history of the AGL6 subfamily in angiosperms. Our analyses provide support for four ancient duplications in the
evolution of the AGL6 lineage: one at the base of core eudicots resulting in euAGL6 and AGL6-like gene clades, one
during basal angiosperm diversification and two in monocot evolution. To investigate whether the spatial domains in
which AGL6 genes function have diverged after duplication, we use quantitative Real Time PCR. We show that the core
eudicot AGL6-like clade acquired expression in vegetative tissues, while its paralog euAGL6 remains predominantly
confined to reproductive tissues.
Conclusions: These and previous data lead us to propose that the AGL6 lineage in core eudicots, in addition to
functions related to the expression in reproductive structures, may have acquired a function in developmental
transitions of vegetative shoots.
Background
The AGAMOUS LIKE 6 lineage of MIKC-type MADSbox transcription factors is rooted in a superclade with
both SEPALLATA-like genes and APETALA1/FRUITFUL-like genes, though the exact relationships between
these three lineages are somewhat unclear [1-6]. The
function of SEP- and AP1-like genes is known to contribute to floral meristem specification and floral organ identity in angiosperm reproductive development [5,7-11].
Yet the function of AGL6 genes, the third lineage in this
superclade, had not been functionally characterized until
recently.
The genome of the genetic plant model Arabidopsis
thaliana harbors two AGL6 genes: AGL6 after which the
subfamily was named and its paralog AGL13. No knock* Correspondence: tom.viaene@bio.kuleuven.be, koen.geuten@bio.kuleuven.be

out phenotype has been described for either one of these
two paralogs, possibly due to genetic redundancy with
each other and other factors [12-15]. Just recently, knockout phenotypes have been described in three other angiosperm species: the grasses rice (Oryza) and maize (Zea)
and in Petunia, an asterid species [16-18]. In Oryza,
Ohmori et al. [16] characterized the function of MADS6
where it regulates floral organ identity and floral meristem determinacy and was renamed MOSAIC FLORAL
ORGANS1 (MFO1). Mfo1 florets develop abnormal
paleas and lodicules, mixed organs and extra floral organs
[16]. In Zea, bearded ear, a loss-of-function mutant for
AGL6 demonstrates a similar role in floral organ development and floral meristem identity [18]. Finally in Petunia,
the flower specific function of PhAGL6 in petal and
anther development was revealed in double and triple
mutants with SEPALLATA-like genes, indicating that
PhAGL6 functions redundantly with closely related genes
[17]. In agreement with this role confined to reproductive

development, PhAGL6 expression was not observed during vegetative developmental stages [17]. So far, the
knockout phenotypes studied suggest that AGL6 plays a
redundant role in establishing the flower and its organs.
Members of the AGL6 lineage have been isolated from
gymnosperms [19-21] and all major angiosperm clades
[1]. Comparing expression patterns of these genes
throughout these plant lineages suggests that expression
of AGL6 in floral meristems has been conserved since
angiosperm origin [14,21,22]. Yet in Arabidopsis and
gymnosperms, additional expression in vegetative tissues
has been observed [12,13,19,20,22,23]. A detailed
reporter analysis of the regulatory elements of Arabidopsis AGL13 and AGL6 observed expression of AGL13 in
the vasculature underlying the shoot apical meristem
[14]. In addition, expression of AGL6 was recently
detected by in situ hybridization in cauline leaf primordia
and in cryptic bract regions in response to floral induction [15]. Similarly, gymnosperm homologs have shown
to be expressed in vegetative tissues [19,20]. For example,
Mouradov et al. [20] detected expression of an AGL6homolog (PrMADS3) in the group of cells initiating needle primordia in vegetative buds, suggestive of nonreproductive functions of the pre-angiosperm AGL6 lineage.
Though often frought with pleotropic effects unrelated
to the original function, heterologous overexpression of
AGL6 genes from Hyacinthus orientalis [24], Oncidium
Gower Ramsey [25], Dendrocalamus latiflorus [26] and
Picea abies [2] in Arabidopsis or Nicotiana suggested several other possible functions for AGL6 genes: a role in the
juvenile to adult transition in Norway spruce [2] or a role
as regulator of floral transition in the studied monocot
species [24-26]. The latter function was corroborated by
the constitutive expression in Arabidopsis of AGL6 or of
AGL6- EAR, a repressor domain [15]. However, this early
flowering phenotype was not obtained when an activated
form (AGL6-VP16) was expressed under the AGL6 promoter, leaving a putative function for the AGL6 gene in
the regulation of Arabidopsis flowering time to be confirmed.
The long-awaited functional characterization of AGL6
now highlights the need for a phylogenetic framework to
understand the origin and diversification of AGL6 gene
functions. The evolutionary history of the AGL6 gene lineage has been addressed in detail for grasses indicating
that paralogs of AGL6 in Oryza sativa originate from an
ancient duplication before the origin of the grass clade
[23]. Here we present an analysis of the phylogenetic history of AGL6 genes in angiosperms by extending the
available AGL6 sequence sampling with newly isolated
asterid and EST-based eudicot sequences. Our inferences
indicate four previously unidentified ancient duplications: one at the base of core eudicots resulting in what

we have named AGL6-like and euAGL6 gene clades, two
in monocots and a fourth one in basal angiosperms. Tracing expression patterns along the phylogeny of the AGL6
lineage indicates that expression of paralogs after the
major core eudicot duplication has diverged to include
expression in vegetative tissues.

Berberis julianae (Berberidaceae), Anemone nemorosa
(Ranunculaceae) and Citrus sinensis (Rutaceae) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Total RNA was
isolated using the Invisorb Spin Plant RNA kit (Invitek,
Berlin, DE) or Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, US). The
mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using AMV
reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, US) and an
oligo-dT primer. Our initial strategy was applying 3'RACE [27] using primers (AP1MDS3: 5'-GTICARYTIARRMGIATIGARAAYAAGAT-3', RQVT: 5'-CGRCAR
GTGACSTTCTSCAARCG-3',
oligodT:
5'-CCGGATCCT CTAGAGCGGCCGC(T)17-3') and according
PCR-programs taken from the literature [21,28]. All PCR
amplifications were carried out using Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, US). PCR products were
gel-purified with a Nucleospin extract 2 kit (MachereyNagel, Düren, DE) and cloned into the pGEM-T vector
(Promega, Madison, US). After transformation, between
50 and 100 white clones were checked for inserts in a
PCR reaction using the same primers and program. Plasmid DNA for selected clones was extracted with the
Nucleospin Plasmid kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, DE).
The plasmid inserts were sequenced using T7 and SP6
universal primers using the BigDye Terminator 1.1 kit
(Applied Biosystems, Forster City, US) on an Applied Biosystems 310 sequencer or the plasmids were sent for
sequencing (MacroGen Inc., Seoul, KP). AGL6-homologs
from Asarum europaeum (AeAGL6 - 293 bp), Anemone
nemorosa (AnAGL6 - 199 bp), Berberis julianae (BjAGL6
- 199 bp), Papaver somniferum (PasAGL6 - 199 bp) and
Citrus sinensis (CsAGL62 - 98 bp) were cloned using a
specific primer combination based on sequences of
closely related species. In total, sixteen new AGL6
sequences were deposited in Genbank [Accession numbers HM121967 - HM121982]. In addition, SEPA
LLATA3-homologs were amplified from Asarum europaeum (AeSEP3 - 209 bp), Papaver somniferum (PsSEP3 420 bp), Berberis juliana (BSEP3 - 420 bp) and Anemone

nemorosa (AnSEP3 - 420 bp) using specific primers from
closely related species. New SEP3-sequences were deposited in Genbank [Accession numbers HM121963 - HM
121966]. For all used primers see additional File 1: List of
primer sequences used.
Sampling, blast search and phylogenetic analysis

In order to reconstruct the timing of duplication that
resulted in paralogous copies in Actinidia chinensis, Roridula gorgonias and Saurauia zahlbruckneri, we performed a BLAST search to look for all available AGL6
genes in the EST-database. The obtained sequences were
combined with previously characterized AGL6-like
sequences in a matrix (See additional File 2 - List of species used in the phylogenetic analysis with abbrevations
and accession numbers). The short AGL6-sequences
from Asarum, Berberis, Anemone, Papaver, Citrus and
Eschscholzia were not included in this first matrix
because they can be expected to artificially lower support
values in resampling methods such as bootstrapping.
Obtained nucleotide sequences were manually aligned
using MacClade 4 [29], according to the reading frame of
the conceptually translated amino acid sequences. The
alignment starts at the RQVT-site in the MADS-domain
and ends just before the stop codon. A multifasta alignment file can be found in the supplementary data (see
additional File 3). After alignment, nucleotide sequences
were analyzed with PAUP* 4b10 [30], Mr Bayes 3.1.2 [31],
GARLI [32] and PHYML [33]. Paup* 4b10 [30] was used
for parsimony bootstrap analysis. A Maximum Parsimony (MP) heuristic search was conducted using 1000
random addition sequences with TBR branch swapping
and saving of multiple parsimonous trees (MulTrees on).
Branch support values were obtained by nonparametric
bootstrap analysis on 1000 pseudo-replicate data sets
[34]. Parameters for the Bayesian analysis and maximum
likelihood analysis were estimated using Modeltest 3.06
[35]. Modeltest selected the GTR+I+G substitution
model using the Akaike Information criterion. MrBayes
was run for 5 million generations where every 100 generations one tree was saved. The search reached stationarity around 50 000 generations. This number was
considered the 'burnin period' and was excluded when
the consensus phylogeny was constructed. PHYML [33]
and GARLI [32] were used for maximum likelihood inference of the matrix. Confidence in the clades was estimated by the approximate likelihood ratio test method
from Anisimova & Gascuel [36] and bootstrap analysis
with 100 replicates. For the aLRT-tests, we used both the
Chi2 probability and the more conservative SH-like test
as branch support measures. The most likely tree was
used and ML bootstrap values (>70) and BPP values (>90)
were plotted on the three. In a second analysis, to identify
the AGL6-sequences from Asarum europaeum, Anemone

nemorosa, Berberis julianae, Papaver somniferum,
Eschscholzia californica and Citrus sinensis as bona fide
AGL6 sequences, we included these short sequences in
the previous matrix and performed a second analysis
using a similar strategy (See additional File 4 for the phylogenetic tree with bootstrap values from the likelihood
analysis). To identify the newly identified SEPALLATA3
sequences as SEP3 homologs, we constructed a matrix
with selected representatives from all SEPALLATA-subfamilies. We used AGL6-sequences as outgroup and constructed a neighbour Joining tree and performed
parsimony bootstrap analyses with PAUP* 4b10 [30]. The
resulting tree can be found in additional File 5. All
included genes in this tree are listed in additional File 2.
qRT-PCR quantification of gene expression

To examine the expression patterns of selected AGL6 and
SEPALLATA3 genes using qRT-PCR, vegetative parts and
floral organs of Houttuynia cordata and Asarum europaeum (Piperales, magnoliids), Eschscholzia californica,
Papaver somniferum and Berberis julianae (Ranunculales, eudicots), Vitis vinifera (Vitales, core eudicots), Citrus sinensis (Sapindales, rosids) and Actinidia chinensis
(Ericales, asterids) were collected and frozen in liquid
nitrogen. Floral material for Asarum, Papaver, Eschscholzia, Berberis, Vitis, Citrus and Actinidia were in the floral
bud stage, except for Houttuynia where only mature
flower material was available. The floral parts of
Eschscholzia, Papaver and Actinidia were dissected from
young mature flowers. RNA was extracted from each
organ type separately using the Invisorb Spin Plant RNA
kit (Invitek, Berlin, DE) or Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
US) and each RNA sample was DNase treated using
TURBO DNA-free (Ambion, Austin, US). To verify the
absence of gDNA in the total RNA, we used a PCR-reaction (40 cycles) with actin primers (data not shown).
Based on this, we repeated the DNAse treatment for few
samples. Total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA
using AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison,
US) and the included oligo-dT primer and random primers. Real-time PCR was performed on a StepOne Plus
apparatus (Applied Biosystems, Forster City, US) using
Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Forster City, US). Primers were constructed using the Primer
Express software (Applied Biosystems, Forster City, US).
The data presented here are the average of three technical
replicates with standard error of the mean and two biological replicates are shown. All samples are normalized
against ACTIN expression. Data analysis used the delta
CT-method. For Houttuynia cordata, Asarum europaeum and Berberis julianae, ACTIN was cloned using a
specific primer pair. New ACTIN sequences were deposited in Genbank [HM121983-HM121985]. The SEPA
LLATA3 sequences used are VvMADS4 for Vitis vinifera

Ancient duplications in the AGL6 lineage occurred at the
base of the core eudicots and during monocot and
magnoliid evolution

For the reconstruction of the evolution of the AGL6 lineage, we combined previously identified AGL6-homologs
with newly isolated and EST-derived AGL6 genes. The
obtained data matrix contains two gymnosperm
sequences and 79 angiosperm accessions and we analyzed this under maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) optimality criteria and in addition
we used Bayesian posterior probability distribution estimation (BPP). We rooted the phylogeny by selecting gymnosperm AGL6 genes as outgroup. Because the
maximum likelihood estimated topology and the Bayesian phylogram were identical, we present this tree as single most optimal phylogenetic estimate (Figure 1).
Bayesian posterior probabilities and bootstrap values
from the likelihood analysis are plotted on the tree as
support measures for clades (Figure 1). MP bootstrap values, which were almost identical to ML bootstrap values,
and branch support values from the aLRT-test, which
again confirm the proposed hypothesis, are not shown.
While in previous phylogenetic analyses of the AGL6
lineage, eudicot sequences were sparsely sampled or the
focus was on monocot representatives [16,17,23,37], the
focus of this study is on the eudicot clade. Three major
groups of AGL6 genes can be recognized in our estimate
of phylogenetic relationships (Figure 1): a clade grouping
monocot sequences (a); a clade grouping magnoliid
sequences (b) and finally a large eudicot clade (c).
Within monocots (Figure 1a), gene relationships are
not congruent with species relationships. Two Poales representatives (PeAGL6 from Phyllostachys and BoAGL6
from Bambusa) are nested strongly (ML 89 and BPP 100)
in a clade grouping Liliales and Asparagales sequences.
This is in turn sister to a clade containing all other Poales
sequences (ML 100 and BP 100). The phylogeny thus
indicates that during the divergence of monocots a first
duplication event has occurred at least before the origin
of Liliales [38]. However, no duplicated AGL6 genes were
retrieved for any of the species in these groups, suggesting that paralogous copies may have been asymmetrically
retained after duplication or remain to be identified. The
fact that the Asparagales Narcissus sequence NtAGL6a
groups more closely with Poales sequences PeAGL6 and

Figure 1 Phylogeny of AGL6 genes in angiosperms, as inferred
from maximum likelihood and Bayesian analysis. Bayesian posterior probabilities (below) and bootstrap values from the likelihood analysis (above) are plotted on the tree. Black star indicates inferred
duplication events. Included species, abbreviations and accession
numbers are listed in additional file 2: List of species used in the phylogenetic analysis

BoAGL6 than with NtAGL6b, indicates a second ancient
duplication tracing back to a time before the Asparagales
branched off in monocot phylogeny. We would like to
note here however, that sampling is particularly sparse to
support the latter duplication and that although our analyses provide support, increased taxon sampling would
improve accuracy for this inferred node [e.g. [39]]. In
addition, our analyses show two duplicate AGL6
sequences for Crocus in Liliales (CsatAGL6a,
CsatAGL6b) that we are unable to date more precisely.
Finally we retrieve the ancient duplications in Poales
shown by Reinheimer & Kellogg [23], leading to two copies in Oryza sativa (OsMADS6 and OsMADS17) and a
second one leading to multiple copies in Zea mays (ZAG3
and ZAG5).
Within the magnoliid clade (Figure 1b), which is supported by a BPP-value of 96, both the representatives of
Laurales (Persea and Chimonanthus) and Magnoliales
(Magnolia and Michelia) possess multiple copies of
AGL6. Although our analyses do not provide enough support for the timing of the duplication event, it probably

Viaene et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:148
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/148

occurred before the evolutionary origin leading to Magnoliales and Laurales [38]. However, another scenario
involving two subsequent duplications can not be
excluded.
Within the strongly supported eudicot group (Figure
1c, ML 90 and BPP 100), we recognize three supported
clades: a basal eudicot clade with the Ranunculales representatives from Aquilegia (AvAGL6) and Ranunculus
(RbAGL6) (Figure 1, I, ML 95 and BPP 100), a small core
eudicot (Figure 1, II, ML 94 and BPP 100) and a large core
eudicot clade (Figure 1, III, ML 95 and BPP 100). We propose to rename the large core eudicot clade the euAGL6
clade, similar to the eudicot duplications in the AGAMOUS, APETALA3 and APETALA1 lineage [5,28,40].
The small core eudicot clade will be referred to as the
AGL6-like clade, as no functional characterization of any
representative has been performed. In both euAGL6 and
AGL6-like clades, rosid AGL6 sequences from Vitis
(VvAGL6a and VvMADS3), Populus (PtAGL6a and
PtAGL6b), Citrus (CrAGL6 and CsAGL6) and asterid
AGL6 sequences from Roridula (RgAGL6a and
RgAGL6b), Saurauia (SzAGL6a and SzAGL6b) and
Actinidia (AcAGL6a and AcAGL6b) can be identified.
Our data indicate that the duplication leading to these
two paralogous clades occurred after the divergence of
the basal eudicot Ranunculales clade and before the
divergence of core eudicots [38]. This scenario is supported by a BPP-value of 97 and a bootstrap value of 77.
Although duplications frequently occur in almost all
MADS-box gene lineages, this ancient duplication event
was not identified in previous analyses of the AGL6 lineage. The AGL6-like clade (Figure 1, I) groups only few
species, despite our targeted efforts to identify more
sequences belonging to this clade in sequence databases.
Within the euAGL6 clade (Figure 1, II), no disruptions of
gene to species relationships indicate later additional
duplications. As expected from our knowledge of evolutionary relationships within angiosperms, a rosid (ML 76
and BPP 100) and an asterid clade are recognized.
Expression patterns of duplicated eudicot AGL6 genes have
diverged and differ from SEP3 genes

Information on expression patterns of AGL6 genes for
eudicot representatives is even more limited as compared
to monocots [23] and magnoliids [4]. Until now, one rosid
species (Arabidopsis thaliana) [13,14], one basal eudicot
species (Vitis vinifera) [41] and one asterid species (Petunia hybrida) [17,42] have been investigated for their
AGL6 expression patterns. Because our analyses indicate
an ancient duplication at the base of the core eudicots
with resulting paralogous copies, we studied the expression patterns of these duplicated AGL6 genes in Vitis, Citrus and Actinidia using qRT-PCR (Figure 2) in
comparison to expression of SEP3 mRNA's [17].

Figure 2 Expression of duplicated AGL6- and SEPALLATA3-genes
in core eudicot species using qRT-PCR. AGL6 and SEP3 qRT-PCR
products from Vitis vinifera (a-c), Citrus sinensis (d-f) and Actinidia chinensis (g-i) are shown. Relative expression to ACTIN is shown using the
delta Ct method. Floral material for Vitis, Citrus and Actinidia were in the
floral bud stage. The floral parts of Actinidia were dissected from young
mature flowers.

In Vitis vinifera, expression of the two AGL6 genes differs markedly: while the AGL6-homolog from the AGL6like clade (VvAGL6a, Figure 2a) is predominantly
expressed in tendrils, expression of its paralog
(VvMADS3, Figure 2b) is both in tendrils and flowers.
Previously, it was shown that the expression of VvMADS3
was restricted to the floral parts of the plant and the
expression in tendrils we show here was not detected
[41]. This could be explained by the difference of specific
sampling of tissues between both studies. The SEP3 gene
(VvMADS4, Figure 2c) is most strongly expressed in the
flower and confirms the observations of a previous study
in Vitis [43]. Thus, both VvMADS3 and VvMADS4 are
expressed in the flower, while VvAGL6a is most strongly
expressed in tendrils. In contrast to VvMADS4, both
AGL6 genes are also expressed in tendrils. Although tendrils would seem vegetative structures in nature, a putative homology of tendrils and reproductive shoots has
been proposed, partly on the basis of AP1 and FUL
expression [44].
For the rosid genus Citrus, we also found one paralog
belonging to the AGL6-like lineage (CrAGL6 and
CsAGL62) and one paralog grouping with the euAGL6
clade (CsAGL6). The expression patterns of both genes
were examined in vegetative and floral parts of Citrus sinensis. Again, the expression patterns between the duplicated AGL6 genes differ significantly. While the AGL6like gene (CsAGL62, Figure 2d) is expressed both in the
vegetative shoot and the flower of C. sinensis, the euAGL6
gene (CsAGL6, Figure 2e) is predominantly expressed in
the flower. We compared this to the expression pattern of
a SEP3-homolog in Citrus, CitMADS3 (Figure 2f) [45].
Similar to the results of Endo et al. [45], the SEP3homolog is strongly expressed in floral tissues. So both
CitMADS3 and CsAGL6 are expressed in the flower,
while CsAGL62 is expressed predominantly in the vegetative shoot.

Also, in Actinidia chinensis, the two AGL6-paralogs
have acquired different expression patterns. AcAGL6a,
which belongs to the AGL6-like clade is expressed both in
floral parts and in all vegetative tissue samples (Figure
2g), but predominantly in the vegetative shoot. The
euAGL6 gene in Actinidia, AcAGL6b is also expressed in
both vegetative and floral tissues (sepals and petals), but
predominantly in floral tissue (Figure 2h). The expression
pattern in floral tissues is rather similar to the expression
of the ortholog of AcAGL6a in Petunia, pMADS4, of
which the expression is confined to floral organs [17,42].
According to expectations, the SEP3 gene in Actinidia is
only expresssed in floral parts (AcSEP3, Figure 2i). The
expression of pMADS4 in the floral organs of Petunia,
which is mostly in the petal and the ovary, is different
from the expression of the AGL6 genes in Actinidia.
While the AGL6-like homolog is expressed in sepals and
ovaries (AcAGL6a, Figure 2g), the euAGL6 copy is mainly
expressed in sepals and petals (AcAGL6b, Figure 2h).
It is obvious from these results that the duplicated
AGL6 genes in Vitis, Citrus and Actinidia have acquired
different expression patterns after duplication. While in
Vitis and Actinidia, the paralog from the AGL6-like clade
is strongly expressed in tendrils (Vitis) or in the vegetative
shoot (Actinidia), the euAGL6 paralog is expressed in
tendrils and floral tissues for Vitis and shoot and floral
tissues for Actinidia. Therefore, AGL6 expression in Vitis
and Actinidia is different from SEP3 genes, which are
predominantly expressed in floral tissues. In the rosid
species Citrus, the situation is different; the gene belonging to the AGL6-like clade is expressed in both vegetative
and floral parts while the euAGL6 gene has an expression
restricted to floral tissues, similar to expression of the
SEP3 gene. Thus, while SEP3-expression is always limited
to floral tissues, euAGL6 genes are also predominantly
expressed in floral tissues with some vegetative expression. Contrary, expression levels of AGL6-like genes are
highest in the vegetative shoots and/or tendrils.
Vegetative expression was lost in angiosperms and
regained in core eudicots

Our phylogenetic studies reveal that several plant lineages can be expected to harbor more than one AGL6
representative in their genome and that these paralogous
sequences can be of ancient origin. Because gene duplicates in MIKC type MADS-box genes have been shown
repeatedly to sub- or neofunctionalize, with gene expression divergence as an observable outcome [46-48], we
attempted to infer ancestral AGL6 expression patterns in
flowering plants. This should help to phylogenetically
root and trace the evolution of gene function in this subfamily of MADS-box transcription factors. Previous
expression patterns of AGL6 representatives in magnoliids [4,49], Nymphaeles and Proteales [22], non-grass

Page 6 of 11

monocots [24,25,37,50] and Poaceae [23] did not find
expression in vegetative tissues. However, we showed that
some duplicated eudicot AGL6 genes are expressed in
vegetative tissues (cfr supra) and in gymnosperms an
AGL6-homolog, PrMADS3, was detected in the group of
cells initiating needle primordia in vegetative buds from
Pinus radiata [20]. To investigate when expression in
vegetative tissues may have originated, we quantitatively
compared the expression level of AGL6 in vegetative and
reproductive tissue samples of several species belonging
to the magnoliids and Ranunculales, two clades that originated before the divergence of the core eudicot clade.
Again here, we compared the expression of AGL6 to that
of SEP3 mRNA's in both vegetative and reproductive tissue samples (Figure 3).
We selected two representatives from the Piperales
(magnoliid clade), Asarum europaeum and Houttuynia
cordata (Figure 3a-d). In both species, expression of the
AGL6-representatives, AeAGL6 and HcAGL6, is
restricted to floral tissue (Figure 3a,c). In contrast to
AeAGL6, the SEP3-homolog from Asarum europaeum
(AeSEP3) is not only expressed in floral tissue, but also in
the bracts enveloping the flower (Figure 3b). In Houttuynia cordata, expression of a SEP3 gene (HcSEP3) is
similar to that of a AGL6 gene (Fig 3d). This is in agreement with the observations for Persea americana and
Magnolia grandiflora, for which no vegetative expression
of AGL6 representatives was detected [4,49].
We next selected three representatives from the Ranunculales, which is close to the ancient duplication event at
the base of the core eudicots, to check for expression in
vegetative tissue. Expression of AGL6 representatives was
investigated in reproductive and vegetative tissue samples
from Eschscholzia californica and Papaver somniferum
(Papaveraceae) and Berberis julianae (Berberidaceae)
using qRT-PCR (Figure 3e-j). In Berberis julianae, we
found that AGL6 is solely expressed in the floral tissue
(BjAGL6, Figure 3e), similar to SEP3 expression (BjSEP3,
Figure 3f). Also for both representatives of the Papaveraceae, Eschscholzia californica (EscaAGL6, Figure 3g) and
Papaver somniferum (PasAGL6, Figure 3i), AGL6 is
restricted to floral parts. The SEP3 genes from these two
species are also predominantly expressed in floral tissues
(EscaAGL9 and PasSEP3, Figure 3h,j), yet low expression
of PasSEP3 can be found in leaves and even stem (Figure
3j). Within the flower, expression of both EscaAGL6 and
PasAGL6 is mainly maintained in the sepals with low
expression in the ovary for EscaAGL6 and in the petals
for PasAGL6 (Figure 3g,j). In contrast, the expression of
EscaAGL9 and PasSEP3 (Figure 3h,j) is in all floral
organs, except in sepals.
The detected vegetative expression pattern in gymnosperms and several core eudicots and the absence in
monocots, magnoliids and Ranunculales suggests that

Discussion
The AGL6 gene phylogeny is not congruent with the
corresponding species phylogeny

Our phylogenetic estimates indicate five ancient angiosperm duplications in the molecular evolution of the
AGL6 lineage of which four were not detected in previous
analyses [14,16,17,24,37] (summarized in Figure 4a). Two
of these duplications occurred during monocot evolution: a first one before the Liliales branched off and a second one before Asparagales branched off. A third ancient
duplication could be demonstrated during magnoliid
diversification. Probably least expected, a fourth duplication event occurred before the origin of the core eudicot
clade resulting in euAGL6 and AGL6-like genes. In contrast to previous phylogenetic analyses, it required the
inclusion of sequences from basal asterids and ESTderived eudicot AGL6 sequences to generate support for
the core eudicot duplication, illustrating that the pattern
of gene loss or divergence in expression patterns of
MADS-box genes requires elaborate sequence and taxon
sampling to reveal the molecular evolutionary history of
this gene family.

Figure 4 Evolution of the AGL6 lineage and AGL6 expression patterns in gymno- and angiosperms. (a) Summary of the results of the
phylogenetic analysis. Black stars indicate inferred duplication events.
(b) Expression of selected representatives in both vegetative and reproductive structures is shown: strong expression (black), moderate
expression (gray), weak expression (light gray), absence of expression
(white) or not investigated expression (white with dashed line). Expression data were taken from Mouradov et al. [20], Kim et al. [4], Ohmori et
al. [16], Reinheimer & Kellogg [23], Rijpkema et al. [17], Schauer et al.
[14], Yoo et al. [22] and this study.

As is the case for the APETALA1, APETALA3, AGAMOUS and SEPALLATA gene lineages [5,28,40,51-53],
the AGL6 lineage underwent a duplication that can be
traced back to the origin of the core eudicot clade. It has
been suggested that the resulting paralogous sequences
could be the result of a whole genome duplication in an
ancestor of core eudicots after which transcription factors have been preferentially retained [5,54]. Yet, an alternative scenario involving multiple independent
duplication events has also been suggested as an explanation for the resulting duplicate lineages and both scenarios are not mutually exclusive [53]. Our results indicate
that the euAGL6 and AGL6-like sequences were likely
retained early after a genome duplication around the origin of the core eudicots. The phylogeny further shows
that the euAGL6 lineage is represented by many more
sequences than the AGL6-like lineage. One possible
explanation for this observation is that the AGL6-like lineage was lost more frequently in later speciation events,
resulting in a small core eudicot clade with few paralogous sequences. This is illustrated by the absence of the
AGL6-like lineage in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana
as both AGL6 and AGL13 from Arabidopsis belong to the
euAGL6 clade. Alternatively, the fact that one clade is
much smaller than the other could equally well indicate
that members of the smaller clade are expressed in a
more restricted or different temporal or spatial domain
not sampled by EST sequencing or missed in targeted
cloning efforts. Although we are currently unable to attribute functions or diversification in function of the dupli-

Viaene et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:148
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/148

cated core eudicot AGL6-like sequences in this study,
expression divergence between the paralogous copies is
strong, suggesting significant evolution in the transcriptional regulation of these genes.
Maintenance in male organs appears ancestral in flowering
plants, but was frequently lost and vegetative expression
was gained in core eudicots

Ancestral expression patterns of AGL6 in reproductive
structures were previously reconstructed in Schauer et al.
[14] and Reinheimer & Kellogg [23]. It was suggested that
expression of the AGL6 lineage in floral meristems has
been conserved since angiosperm diversification [23]. In
angiosperms, the inferred ancestral expression included
both male and female reproductive tissues and male-specific expression was lost later in evolution [14]. Our
updated summary of AGL6 expression patterns confirms
this inference and adds to the complexity of the evolution
of gene expression in the AGL6 lineage (Figure 4b). A
recent study that included Nymphaeales AGL6 genes
shows that expression of AGL6 in Nymphaea or Nuphar
is absent from stamens, while out of three AGL6 paralogs
from Cabomba, only CacaAGL6-2 is detected in male
organs [22]. Also in grasses, expression in male organs
was lost [23]. In basal eudicots, AGL6 expression in
Nelumbo (Proteales) is weak in stamens [22] and in our
study we find that in both Eschscholzia and Papaver,
expression is not maintained in stamens relative to other
organs. In core eudicots, for neither the euAGL6 or the
AGL6-like lineages, we detected expression in stamens.
Together these results indicate that although originally in
gymnosperms and angiosperms expression was likely
maintained in both male and female organs, from the
early diversification of flowering plants, expression maintenance in male organs disappeared in most lineages. We
have to mention that the expression levels summarized in
Figure 4b may depend on the developmental stage of the
(floral) tissues sampled, which in turn may influence a
comprehensive summary of the data currently available.
We also investigated the expression in developing vegetative tissues. Consistent with previous observations, we
find that the expression of AGL6 genes in angiosperms is
confined to reproductive tissues before the origin of core
eudicots (Figure 4b). After the origin of the core eudicot
euAGL6 and AGL6-like lineages, these lineages gained
expression in vegetative tissues. Yet in Actinidia (Ericales)
and Citrus (Rutales), expression of AGL6-like is stronger
in vegetative shoot tissue than in floral bud tissue. Also in
Vitis (Vitales), we measure similar expression levels of the
AGL6-like gene in vegetative shoots and flower tissue and
intriguingly, expression is most pronounced in tendrils.
In contrast, the euAGL6 lineage has overall retained its
expression domain confined to floral tissues and moderate expression is also observed for vegetative tissues of

Page 8 of 11

Actinidia. For several other members of this lineage,
expression in vegetative tissues is either confined to a
restricted domain (e.g. Arabidopsis) or not detected at all
(e.g. Petunia), suggesting that the euAGL6 lineage overall
performs roles confined to reproductive development,
though additional roles in vegetative development cannot
be excluded for some species. Furthermore, functional
diversification of the euAGL6 and AGL6-like lineages is
not evident from characteristic motifs found at the C-terminal end of the proteins, as has been observed for several other MADS-box gene lineages that originated
before the origin of core eudicots [5,28,40,51-53]. Rather,
the phylogenetic signal that separates the two lineages is
distributed throughout their sequences. Overall, our and
previous data suggest that the expression in vegetative
tissues of the AGL6 lineage is novel in core eudicots.
More extensive studies are needed to determine when
relative vegetative expression in core eudicots was
acquired and how euAGL6 and AGL6-like lineages parsed
an ancestral AGL6 function.
A putative role of AGL6 genes in vegetative development

In Arabidopsis, both AGL6 and AGL13 paralogs belong to
the euAGL6 lineage, and no AGL6-like sequence has been
annotated, suggesting that the AGL6-like lineage was lost
in the evolution to Arabidopsis. Yet data from Arabidopsis may be indicative of multiple roles for the AGL6 subfamily. Several lines of evidence have now established a
(redundant) function for the AGL6 lineage in reproductive development [16-18]. Recent two-hybrid and threehybrid assays have indicated that the Arabidopsis AGL6
protein interacts with other MADS-domain proteins
known to perform roles restricted to reproductive development such as AGAMOUS, APETALA1, SHATTE
RPROOF2 and SEPALLATA3 [11,55]. The function of
PhAGL6 in Petunia was indeed only revealed in double
mutant combinations with PhSEP3 [17] and similarly the
moderate mfo1 phenotype in rice became severe in combination with a mutation in the SEP-like gene LHS1 [16].
In a third example, mutation of the maize AGL6 homolog
bearded ear has a number of phenotypes shared with
mutation in the maize AGAMOUS homolog ZEA AGAMOUS 3 and the combination of bde and zag3 results in
the complete conversion of floral meristems into branchlike meristems [18].
In addition to the role in reproductive development, we
have observed that members of the AGL6-like lineage
acquired expression in vegetative shoot tissue. We speculate that this expression could be related to a function in
flowering time. Several other observations can be interpreted to point in this direction. The protein interaction
profile is again indicative: Arabidopsis AGL6 interacts
with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE, SUPRESSOR OF
OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 and FRUITFUL

Viaene et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:148
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/148

[11]. These proteins have a well-described regulatory role
in the transition to flowering, a process regulated in the
leaf and shoot apical meristem. FUL and SOC1 are indeed
expressed during vegetative development and their
expression is apparent in the shoot apical meristem upon
floral induction [56-58]. An additional combined function in the cambium has recently been described for
these proteins [59]. Similar to FUL and SOC1, AGL13
appears to be expressed in the vasculature of Arabidopsis,
leaving the possibility that AGL6 genes are regulating
processes in the cambium together with FUL and SOC1.
The idea that members of the AGL6 lineage, possibly in
combination with FUL, may perform an additional role
related to the phase transition of the adult shoot into the
reproductive developmental program is further suggested
by the fact that both Arabidopsis AGL6 and FUL are
strongly upregulated in a microRNA172a mutant background [60]. MicroRNA172 targets members of the
APETALA2 family of transcription factors such as
SCHLAFMÜTZE, which in turn act as repressors of
flowering [61]. Such a regulatory role for AGL6 or AGL13
might have gone unnoticed thus far as a result of redundancy with other factors. A recent study similarly suggests a function related to flowering time for Arabidopsis
AGL6 [15]. Constitutive expression or fusion to the EAR
repressor domain resulted in early flowering and in such
lines, expression levels of known regulators of flowering
time were modified. Earlier ectopic expression experiments of AGL6 genes from several monocot species [2426] similarly resulted in early flowering Arabidopsis
transformants. However, in another experiment, the
effect on flowering time was absent when AGL6 was
expressed under its native promoter, which is unexpected
if AGL6 would play a role in controlling Arabidopsis flowering time [15]. A similar series of experiments should be
performed for its paralog, AGL13, to be able to extend
conclusions to the entire euAGL6 lineage in Arabidopsis.
The shoot expression observed in this study contributes
to the idea that the AGL6 lineage may have regained a
function in regulating aspects of the floral transition in
core eudicots. This should be functionally investigated in
a species that retained both euAGL6 and AGL6-like gene
lineages.

ses indicate additional expression in vegetative shoots
after the core eudicot duplication. Though speculative,
this may indicate that AGL6 genes perform a function in
the developmental transitions of shoots, in addition to
their function in the reproductive structures.

Conclusions
Phylogenetic inference of the AGL6 subfamily of MADSbox transcription factors indicates that four ancient
duplications occurred during the evolution of this lineage. As is the case for other MADS-box gene lineages,
one of these duplications occurred at the base of the core
eudicots and resulted in euAGL6 and AGL6-like gene
clades of which the representatives show strong expression divergence. Thus far, AGL6 gene expression was
observed only in reproductive structures, but our analy-
