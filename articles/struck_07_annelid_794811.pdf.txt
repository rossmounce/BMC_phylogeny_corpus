Abstract
Background: Annelida comprises an ancient and ecologically important animal phylum with over 16,500 described
species and members are the dominant macrofauna of the deep sea. Traditionally, two major groups are distinguished:
Clitellata (including earthworms, leeches) and "Polychaeta" (mostly marine worms). Recent analyses of molecular data
suggest that Annelida may include other taxa once considered separate phyla (i.e., Echiura, and Sipuncula) and that
Clitellata are derived annelids, thus rendering "Polychaeta" paraphyletic; however, this contradicts classification schemes
of annelids developed from recent analyses of morphological characters. Given that deep-level evolutionary relationships
of Annelida are poorly understood, we have analyzed comprehensive datasets based on nuclear and mitochondrial genes,
and have applied rigorous testing of alternative hypotheses so that we can move towards the robust reconstruction of
annelid history needed to interpret animal body plan evolution.
Results: Sipuncula, Echiura, Siboglinidae, and Clitellata are all nested within polychaete annelids according to
phylogenetic analyses of three nuclear genes (18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, EF1α; 4552 nucleotide positions analyzed) for 81 taxa,
and 11 nuclear and mitochondrial genes for 10 taxa (additional: 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, ATP8, COX1-3, CYTB, NAD6; 11,454
nucleotide positions analyzed). For the first time, these findings are substantiated using approximately unbiased tests and
non-scaled bootstrap probability tests that compare alternative hypotheses. For echiurans, the polychaete group
Capitellidae is corroborated as the sister taxon; while the exact placement of Sipuncula within Annelida is still uncertain,
our analyses suggest an affiliation with terebellimorphs. Siboglinids are in a clade with other sabellimorphs, and clitellates
fall within a polychaete clade with aeolosomatids as their possible sister group. None of our analyses support the major
polychaete clades reflected in the current classification scheme of annelids, and hypothesis testing significantly rejects
monophyly of Scolecida, Palpata, Canalipalpata, and Aciculata.
Conclusion: Using multiple genes and explicit hypothesis testing, we show that Echiura, Siboglinidae, and Clitellata are
derived annelids with polychaete sister taxa, and that Sipuncula should be included within annelids. The traditional
composition of Annelida greatly underestimates the morphological diversity of this group, and inclusion of Sipuncula and
Echiura implies that patterns of segmentation within annelids have been evolutionarily labile. Relationships within
Annelida based on our analyses of multiple genes challenge the current classification scheme, and some alternative
hypotheses are provided.

Background
Annelids are found throughout the world's terrestrial,
aquatic, and marine habitats, and are the most abundant
component of the macrofauna in the deep sea. As one of
three major animal groups with segmentation, annelids
are critical in any investigation of body plan evolution; we
need to understand the composition and branching history of groups within the annelid radiation if we are to
progress towards elucidation of the last common ancestor
of bilaterians and evolution of segmentation. Surprisingly, annelid evolution is poorly understood. To rectify
this situation, data sets of multiple genes are being used to
evaluate diversity and relationships of major annelid
clades.
Annelida is part of the lophotrochozoan radiation that
includes Mollusca, Brachiopoda, Bryozoa, Nemertea and
Sipuncula [1]. Traditionally classified as "Polychaeta" and
Clitellata, three taxa historically assigned phylum status
have been hypothesized to also fall within Annelida:
Sipuncula, Echiura, and Siboglinidae (previously known
as Pogonophora and Vestimentifera). Sipunculan origins
are the most controversial of these three; some morphological data suggest molluscan affiliations [2], but a growing body of data indicates annelid affinities for this group
of unsegmented marine worms [3-7].
Both molecular and morphological data support Echiura
and Siboglinidae as annelids [7-14]. Echiura possess
annelid-like features such as the ultrastructure of cuticle
and chaetae, the development of the mesoderm, and
structure and position of the blood vessels [15]; additionally, their larval nervous system indicates a possible segmented ancestry even though overt segmentation is
lacking in adults [13]. Recent 18S rRNA analyses support
a sister relationship of Echiura and capitellid polychaetes
[12,16,17], while an analysis of five gene regions (18S, D1
& D9-10 of 28S, histone H3, snU2 RNA, COX1) by Colgan
et al. [7] supports a sister group relationship with Terebelliformia, indicating that the former may reflect a single
gene artifact. Recent analyses of four gene regions (18S
rRNA, D1 of 28S RNA, histone H3, 16S rRNA) are inconclusive; one analysis favors a sistergroup relationship to
Capitellidae and to Protodrilus purpureus and Pectinaridae
in the other one [18].
The ultrastructure of the uncini (short, apically toothed
chaetae) implies a closer relationship of Siboglinidae with
the annelid taxa Terebelliformia and Sabellida [10], and
Rouse and Fauchald [11] (R&F) presented a cladistic analysis of morphological characters that corroborates this.
The placement of siboglinids with annelids is also supported, albeit weakly, by several molecular studies
(mostly based on 18S rRNA) [e.g., [5-8,12,19-22]]. None

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/57

of these hypotheses has been explicitly tested using a rigorous statistical framework.
Analyses of morphological and molecular data support
clitellate monophyly and have provided robust hypotheses of relationships within this taxon [23-25]. However,
monophyly of "Polychaeta" lacks support and resolving
polychaete annelid relationships has been difficult
[26,27]. Although some authors regard "Polychaeta" as
sister to Clitellata [e.g., [11]], increasing evidence based
on molecular and morphological data suggests they are a
paraphyletic
grade
including
clitellates
[e.g.,
[3,8,12,20,23,28-30]].
Polychaete annelids have been classified into approximately 80 families, generally supported as monophyletic,
but arrangement of these into well-supported more-inclusive nodes is wanting [31]. R&F's [11] analyses provide the
most taxonomically inclusive hypotheses of polychaete
relationships to date. Based on morphological cladistic
analyses of polychaete families, they proposed a monophyletic "Polychaeta" consisting of two major clades,
Scolecida and Palpata, the latter divided into Canalipalpata and Aciculata. While these analyses provide objective
and testable hypotheses of polychaete relationships, and
thus significantly moved the field forward, many aspects
of our current understanding of annelid phylogeny are
still poorly understood. Monophyly of Scolecida, Palpata
and Canalipalpata has been questioned by some morphologists [30,32,33], and uncertainties of character scoring, homology assessment, and difficulty in rooting of the
annelid tree make resolution of annelid relationships
using morphology unlikely [27,30,34,35]. Molecular
analyses to date show no evidence to support the classification scheme developed from the R&F analyses, but most
molecular studies have been based on single genes [see
[16,20,26,27]]. In a recent study that included the most
comprehensive annelid taxon sampling to date, incomplete character data for the four genes analyzed may
explain the lack of resolution [18]; of the 217 taxa, only
52 had data for all genes, and over 50 were represented by
data for a single gene only. Neither molecular nor morphological studies have yet convincingly eliminated the
possibility that these clades are monophyletic despite the
doubts raised.
To address these major outstanding issues of annelid
inclusiveness and phylogeny, we reconstruct relationships
of major annelid and lophotrochozoan taxa using two
data sets. One data set is built on ~6.5 kb of sequence
from three nuclear genes [nuclear small and large ribosomal subunits (18S rRNA and 28S rRNA), and elongation
factor-1α (EF1α); referred to as the Nuc data set] for 81
taxa that span 45 traditional polychaete families as well as
Siboglinidae, Echiura, Clitellata, and Sipuncula and nine

outgroup OTUs to address both annelid inclusiveness and
phylogeny. The other data set comprises the three nuclear
genes and eight mitochondrial genes (~13.4 kb) for a
restricted taxon sampling of 10 operational taxonomic
units (OTUs) to address annelid inclusiveness with
respect to Sipuncula, Echiura and Siboglinidae [referred to
as the NucMt data set]. These are the two largest data sets
for annelids explored to date in terms of amount of numbers of characters for a full range of taxa, and it is our hope
that the taxonomic representation of these datasets will
continue to grow in order to provide a more holistic comparison to morphological hypotheses. Besides analyses
using Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference
(BI) a priori hypotheses about annelid relationships were
explicitly tested against best trees using approximately
unbiased (AU) and non-scaled bootstrap probability
(NP) tests.

Results and Discussion
Annelida includes Echiura, Siboglinidae, and Sipuncula
Phylogenetic analyses of 153 new and 100 previously
published sequences for individual genes and combined
data sets (Figs. 1, 2, and Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4) all indicate Annelida is much more diverse than traditionally recognized, and includes Sipuncula, Echiura, and
Siboglinidae, thus confirming previous suggestions. The
Nuc and NucMt data sets place sipunculans, echiurans,
and siboglinids within an otherwise monophyletic Annelida (Figs. 1, 2, Additional file 4), suggesting that body
plan segmentation is evolutionarily labile. Although
nodal support was weak deep in the Nuc tree (Fig. 1), this
more inclusive annelid clade is significantly supported in
all NucMt analyses (bootstrap value (BS) = 99; PP = 1.00
for both protein-coding genes coded as either nucleic or
amino acids; 1-p value of the AU test = 0.999; Figs. 2 &
Additional file 4). Furthermore, our conclusions are significantly supported when we explicitly tested a priori
hypotheses against the best trees using AU and NP tests of
both the Nuc and NucMt data sets (Table 1). Whereas the
results of the 28S rRNA analyses are consistent with those
of the Nuc and NucMt data sets (PP = 0.85) [see Additional file 1], separate analyses of 18S rRNA and, to a
lesser degree, EF1α show unexpected placement of outgroups throughout Annelida (e.g., Mollusca) [see Additional files 2 &3]. None of these outgroup relationships
are significantly supported; presumably phylogenetic signal in this region of the tree is limited when these genes
are analyzed individually, a phenomenon well documented for 18S rRNA [1]. Therefore, we focus on the Nuc
and NucMt analyses.

The hypothesis of a Sipuncula/Mollusca relationship is
rejected by AU and NP tests for NucMt and thus corroborates some previous reports [3,5,6,36]. These results agree
with previous studies suggesting that the molluscan cross

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/57

organization of micromeres during spiral cleavage should
not be regarded as synapomorphic for mollusks and
sipunculans [2,37]. Wanninger et al. [38] discussed the
possession of a ventral median nerve as additional morphological support for a sipunculid-annelid relationship,
but these nerves are also observed in other taxa like Gnathostomulida [39-41]. The position of Sipuncula within
the annelid radiation varies among analyzed data sets
(Figs. 1, 2, Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4) and we were not able
to significantly discriminate via the AU or NP test whether
sipunculans were sister to or derived within Annelida
(Table 1). However, in all of the resulting 81-OTU trees
(Figs. 1, Additional files 1, 2, 3) sipunculans were nested
within annelids, and never placed as a sister taxon, consistent with the NucMt results and some previous studies
[6,7]. Interestingly, the lining of nephridial podocytes is a
morphological feature shared by Sipuncula and Terebelliformia that bolsters the close, albeit weak association
between these two groups in the 81-taxon tree (Fig. 1)
[42].
Echiuran inclusion within the annelids, first suggested by
EF1α data [8], was significantly supported in our analyses
(Figs. 1 &2, Table 1). Moreover, all of our analyses of individual genes or combined data with 81 OTUs, placed
echiurans as sister to Capitellidae [18S rRNA (BS: 95; PP:
1.00), 28S rRNA (BS: 100; PP: 1.00 both excluding
Capitella), EF1α (BS < 50; PP: 0.56), and Nuc (BS = 99
excluding Capitella; PP = 1.00), note that Capitella 28S
rRNA may have long branch issues] confirming earlier
suggestions [12,16-18,20], and in sharp contrast to recent
analyses of several gene regions placing echiurans with
Terebelliformia taxa [7]. Indeed, our explicit hypothesis
testing significantly rejects such a close relationship (Table
1). In the Nuc analyses, Echiura/Capitellidae is sister to a
scolecidan clade of Maldanidae and Arenicolidae clade
(Fig. 1); this result is echoed in the NucMt data, which
lacks a capitellid but places the echiuran and maldanid as
sister taxa (Fig. 2). Due to this placement of Echiura as a
derived annelid group, interpretations of nerve development in echiurans as vestigial segmentation are fully warranted [13].
The long-held hypothesis that Siboglinidae (including
vent worms, pogonophorans and the recently discovered
bone eating worms Osedax [43]) are within Annelida [e.g.,
[8,10-12,14,21]] is supported with significant statistical
rigor (Table 1). Our results corroborate previous molecular studies supporting a nested position of Siboglinidae
within Annelida (Figs. 1, 2, Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4)
[8,12,14]. Furthermore, the Nuc data set and 28S rRNA
partition (Figs. 1, Additional file 1) show a close, albeit
weak relationship between Siboglinidae and Sabellida,
specifically Oweniidae, as suggested by analyses of morphological data [10,11], some molecular data [44] and

uncini and the possession of only one pair of nephridia
with dorsal pores in the first segment are possible synapomorphic features [10]. Morphological characters supporting the sister group relationship of Oweniidae and
Siboglinidae are neuropodial chaetae in posterior segments emerging straight from the body wall and an
intraepidermal nerve cord [21]. The close relationship to
Clitellata as shown by the NucMt data set (Fig. 2) is not
substantiated by morphological data.
Position of Clitellata
In all analyses, Clitellata is derived from polychaetous
ancestors; it does not form a major basal branch of annelids (Figs. 1, 2, Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4). This placement
is significantly supported by hypothesis testing (Table 1),
and corroborates a series of previous studies [see for
review [20,23,27]]. In all analyses with 81 OTUs except
those of the EF1α partition, the small mainly freshwater
meiofaunal aeolosomatid Aeolosoma sp. is sister to Clitellata; however, the support for this relationship is weak
(Figs. 1, Additional files 1 &2). Previous authors have discussed Aeolosoma as either a highly derived clitellate
[45,46], as sister to or the most basal clitellate (depending
on which morphological characters are used to define
Clitellata) [47-52], or as not closely related to Clitellata
[20,28,53-55]. Our findings strengthen the conclusions of
previous but more limited studies [47-52], and offer further evidence of a freshwater origin of Clitellata [24].
However, additional sampling of terrestrial and freshwater polychaetes would be needed before the relationship
between Aeolosoma and Clitellata can be considered
resolved.

Polychaete Relationships
While the relationships of polychaetous annelids are still
poorly understood, our testing of the four major polychaete clades proposed by Rouse and Fauchald [11] are all
significantly rejected by our analyses (Table 1). These
results provide rigorous support for previous ad hoc arguments based on morphological and molecular data
[7,16,18,20,26,27,30,32,33]. Due to the strong affiliation
of echiurans with capitellids, we opted to provisionally
include echiurans within Scolecida during hypothesis
testing to understand whether that group was natural
regardless of echiuran position. Rejection of Scolecida,
Palpata and Canalipalpata is not surprising due to dispersion of their taxa throughout the tree (Fig. 1) and given
that support of these groups by morphological data is
weak [30,32,33]. For example, the presence of palps is
doubted in some Palpata group members (Ampharetidae,
Pectinariidae and Terebellidae), and palp nerves but no
protruding palps have been shown in some scolecids
(Scalibregmatidae and Paraonidae) [56].

Aciculata was the least problematic of the R&F taxa, in that
it was the exclusion of only two taxa that precluded its
monophyly on the tree. For the Nuc data, rejection of
Aciculata by AU and NP tests is due to the placement of
Orbinia within Aciculata (orbiniids are considered scolecids) and the placement of amphinomids at the base of the
tree (Fig. 1). These results are in contrast to two recent
multi-gene analyses where the Aciculata taxa Eunicida and
Phyllodocida are dispersed throughout the trees [7]. Interestingly, supportive chaetae of Orbiniidae may be homologous with the acicula of Aciculata [33], and
Amphinomida has been regarded as basal based on the
tetraneurous organization of the nervous system [57,58].

As in previous studies encompassing polychaete taxa [e.g.,
[7,12,20]], nodal support above the family level is weak
(BS < 50; PP < 0.95). Nonetheless, some taxa recovered by
R&F's [11] analyses are also supported in our analyses
(Fig. 1). For example, the traditional Capitellida consisting of Capitellidae, Arenicolidae and Maldanidae is recovered, but includes Echiura; Terebelliformia and
Aphroditiformia are also recovered; and a clade encompassing all Sabellida and Spionida except Chaetopteridae
appears in the tree. In contrast to Rousset et al. [18] and
Colgan et al. [7], monophyly of Annelida including
Echiura and Sipuncula is also revealed by all combined
analyses (Fig. 1, 2, Additional file 4). Thus, with an
increasing number of characters our understanding of
annelid phylogeny and inclusiveness is progressing, even
using ribosomal rRNA genes. A similar effect has been
observed for protostomes, lophotrochozoans and eunicidans as well [4,59,60].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/57

chaetae comprised of β-chitin and arranged in four
groups, have also been reduced or secondarily lost in
some of these derived taxa [23].
Hypothesis testing clearly rejects the exclusion of Clitellata and Siboglinidae from "Polychaeta", and monophyly
of Scolecida, Palpata, Canalipalpata or Aciculata. Furthermore, some higher level annelid taxa are suggested by our
analyses, i.e., Aphroditiformia, Terebelliformia, Sabellida/Spionida excluding Chaetopteridae, Capitellida
including Echiura, Eunicida/Phyllodocida including
Orbiniidae. However, we need to progress further in the
resolution of annelid phylogeny, and we recognize that
data from additional genes and for more complete taxonomic representation of annelids may robustly resolve the
basal nodes in the annelid tree and elucidate the precise
positions of Sipuncula, Clitellata, and Siboglinidae.

Methods
Evolution of body plans
Segmentation has traditionally been thought to be a conserved morphological character complex supporting an
Arthropoda plus Annelida clade, "Articulata"; an implicit
assumption has been that homoplasy of segmentation is
unlikely. Molecular phylogenetic analyses favor Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa and reject Articulata with steadily increasing support, which implies convergence of their
body plans and specifically of the complex "segmentation" [see [1]]. Interestingly, recent studies of Annelida
and Arthropoda central nervous systems reveal a higher
variability than previously expected and a typical rope ladder-like central nervous system, a key feature of the complex "segmentation" cannot be found [see [56,61]]. Our
results provide statistical support for trees that indicate a
high plasticity in the evolution of this fundamental body
plan character in annelids: the placement of unsegmented
Echiura and Sipuncula within Annelida implies that these
two groups have independently lost segmentation; and
members of Siboglinidae possess highly modified segmentation that is only obvious in their posterior ophistosoma.

Conclusion
The molecular phylogenetic analyses presented here corroborate previous studies in suggesting a very different
view of annelid evolution than is traditionally accepted;
the tests of alternative hypotheses provide statistical support for our conclusions. Sipuncula is most likely a
derived annelid or the annelid sister group. Echiura is the
sister group to Capitellidae as revealed by three nuclear
markers and their exclusion from Annelida is significantly
rejected. Accepting Annelida as including Echiura and
Sipuncula not only suggests that segmentation is more
evolutionary labile than previously assumed, but that
other characters distinctive of annelids, such as complex

Data assembly
Additional file 5 lists taxa and genes employed, and GenBank accession numbers. Upon collection, samples were
preserved in > 70% non-denatured Ethanol, RNAlater
(Invitrogen) or frozen at 80°C. Procurement of 18S rRNA
and 28S rRNA sequence data followed Struck et al. [60].
For EF1α, total RNA was isolated using RNAwiz™
(Ambion) and reverse transcribed using SuperScript™ II
(Invitrogen). Amplification of EF1α followed McHugh [8]
with an additional primer (JH16R: 5'-KNRAANKNYTCNACRCACA-3') using touchdown PCR and a second
round of amplification. Further amplification details can
be found in Supplementary Data. The TOPO TA Cloning
Kit for Sequencing (Invitrogen) was used to clone most
EF1α products. An ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer and
Big Dye Terminator v.3.1 (Applied Biosystems) were used
in sequencing.
Phylogenetic Analyses
A data set (NucMt) consisting of eight mitochondrial
genes (COX1-3, CYTB, NAD6, ATP8, 12S and partial 16S),
as well as three nuclear genes 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA and
EF1α were analyzed using the 7 available ingroup mitochondrial genomes plus 3 outgroups (2 mollusks and 1
brachiopod). Five mollusks, two brachiopods, a
nemertean and a platyhelminth were outgroups for individual genes and the concatenated (Nuc) data sets.
Sequences were aligned with CLUSTAL W [62] using
default settings and corrected by hand. Ambiguous positions were excluded from the subsequent analysis. The
alignments (Accession #S1766; Nuc matrix #M3221 and
NucMt data set #M3220 & #M3219) are available at TREEBASE. To assess phylogenetic signal, regions within genes
were analyzed using a procedure modified from Jördens et
al. [17]. Saturated positions were removed. χ2 tests did not
reject homogeneity of base frequencies across taxa [see

Additional file 6]. Appropriate ML models for each of the
5 data sets [see Additional file 7] were determined with
Modeltest V 3.06 [63,64]. PAUP*4.0b [65] using heuristic
searches, tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping, 10 random taxon additions and model parameters
reconstructed topologies. Nodal support was estimated by
100 BS replicates with 10 random taxon addition and TBR
branch swapping for the NucMt data set. However, for the
81-OTU data sets ML bootstrapping using heuristic
searches is not applicable due to computational time burden. Therefore, each 81-OTU data set was analyzed using
10,000 BS replicates, neighbor-joining searches and ML
settings for the parameter specification.
For BI, MrModeltest 1.1b [66] determined prior probability distributions of individual parameters of nucleotide
substitution models for each gene partition in MrBayes
3.1 [67]. The mixed amino acid substitution model
option was chosen for each protein-coding gene partition
when analyzing amino acid sequences in the NucMt data.
Partitions were unlinked. Analyses employed two runs
with three heated and one cold chain started simultaneously for either 1*107 generations (18S rRNA and 28S
rRNA), 5*106 generations (EF1α and Nuc), or 1*106 generations (NucMt, protein-coding genes coded as either
nucleotides or amino acids), with trees being sampled
every 250 generations. Based on convergence of likelihood scores, burnin trees were discarded (18S rRNA: 6,760
trees; 28S rRNA: 28,000; EF1α : 10,000; Nuc: 8,000;
NucMt, both: 201) and posterior probabilities determined from remaining trees.
Hypothesis Testing
Significance tests using both the AU and the NP test of
CONSEL [68,69] were performed under the ML criterion
for the Nuc and NucMt data sets for several a priori
hypotheses against the best trees. The following hypotheses were tested for Nuc and NucMt data sets: 1) Sipuncula
is not an annelid, 2) Sipuncula and Mollusca are closely
related, 3) Echiura is not an annelid, 4) Siboglinidae is not
an annelid, 5) Clitellata is not a subtaxon of polychaetes,
6) monophyly of Scolecida including Echiura; and additionally for the Nuc data set a sister group relationship of
Echiura and Terebelliformia as well as monophyly of the
other three major polychaete clades (Palpata, Aciculata,
Canalipalpata). To obtain the best result for each a priori
hypothesis the analyses were constrained by allowing
only trees congruent with the particular a priori hypothesis. Due to strong support for a Capitellidae/Echiura sistergroup relationship with 18S rRNA data sets, the taxon
assemblage for Scolecida was changed from R&F [11] to
include Echiura biasing the test in favor of supporting
Scolecida. Furthermore, each clade obtained in NucMt
nucleotide only analyses were compared against the best
alternative hypothesis not congruent with the clade by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/57

means of AU tests resulting in the 1-p values of Fig. 2. This
is an approach similar to decay indices in Parsimony analyses [70,71], but with actual significance values; p < 0.05
shows significant difference between the two alternative
clades. Thus, in congruence with BS and PP values 1-p has
to be greater than 0.95.
