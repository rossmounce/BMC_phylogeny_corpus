Myostatin-2 gene structure and polymorphism of
the promoter and first intron in the marine fish
Sparus aurata: evidence for DNA duplications
and/or translocations
Elisabeth Nadjar-Boger, Bruria Funkenstein*

Abstract
Background: Myostatin (MSTN) is a member of the transforming growth factor-ß superfamily that functions as a
negative regulator of skeletal muscle development and growth in mammals. Fish express at least two genes for
MSTN: MSTN-1 and MSTN-2. To date, MSTN-2 promoters have been cloned only from salmonids and zebrafish.
Results: Here we described the cloning and sequence analysis of MSTN-2 gene and its 5’ flanking region in the marine
fish Sparus aurata (saMSTN-2). We demonstrate the existence of three alleles of the promoter and three alleles of the
first intron. Sequence comparison of the promoter region in the three alleles revealed that although the sequences of
the first 1050 bp upstream of the translation start site are almost identical in the three alleles, a substantial sequence
divergence is seen further upstream. Careful sequence analysis of the region upstream of the first 1050 bp in the three
alleles identified several elements that appear to be repeated in some or all sequences, at different positions. This
suggests that the promoter region of saMSTN-2 has been subjected to various chromosomal rearrangements during
the course of evolution, reflecting either insertion or deletion events. Screening of several genomic DNA collections
indicated differences in allele frequency, with allele ‘b’ being the most abundant, followed by allele ‘c’, whereas allele ‘a’
is relatively rare. Sequence analysis of saMSTN-2 gene also revealed polymorphism in the first intron, identifying three
alleles. The length difference in alleles ‘1R’ and ‘2R’ of the first intron is due to the presence of one or two copies of a
repeated block of approximately 150 bp, located at the 5’ end of the first intron. The third allele, ‘4R’, has an additional
insertion of 323 bp located 116 bp upstream of the 3’ end of the first intron. Analysis of several DNA collections
showed that the ‘2R’ allele is the most common, followed by the ‘4R’ allele, whereas the ‘1R’ allele is relatively rare.
Progeny analysis of a full-sib family showed a Mendelian mode of inheritance of the two genetic loci. No clear
association was found between the two genetic markers and growth rate.
Conclusion: These results show for the first time a substantial degree of polymorphism in both the promoter and
first intron of MSTN-2 gene in a perciform fish species which points to chromosomal rearrangements that took
place during evolution.

Background
Myostatin (MSTN) is a member of the transforming
growth factor (TGF)-b superfamily and a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth in mammals [reviewed
in [1]]. The inhibition of muscle growth is believed to
occur by negative regulation of both myoblast

proliferation and differentiation [2-7]. MSTN knockout
mice have two- to threefold greater muscle mass than
their wild type littermates, mainly due to an increase in
the number of muscle fibers (hyperplasia) and the diameter of the fibers (hypertrophy) [8]. Transgenic mice
carrying a dominant negative MSTN showed up to a
35% increase in skeletal muscle mass and this increase
was the result of muscle hypertrophy [9]. The phenomenon known as “double muscling” of increased muscle
mass found in several cattle breeds is associated with

natural mutations in the MSTN coding sequence
[10-13]. Muscle mass gain as a result of a mutation in
the MSTN gene was reported recently also in dogs [14],
sheep [15,16] and a child [17].
The key role of MSTN in muscle growth and its potential application in animal husbandry encouraged the
cloning of MSTN cDNAs and genes from numerous fish
species of value to aquaculture [[18] and references
therein; [19] and references therein]. These studies have
shown that in contrast to mammals and chicken, fish
possess at least two distinct MSTN genes with differential
expression [reviewed in [20]], probably as a result of gene
duplication. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis [21]
suggested that several of the salmonid genes, formerly
identified as MSTN-2, are actually MSTN-1 orthologs,
and were re-classified as MSTN-1a and MSTN-1b. However, sequence similarity and clustering supported the
existence of MSTN-2 in the gilthead sea bream (Sparus
aurata), shi drum (Umbrina cirrosa), Fugu (Takifugu
rubripes) and zebrafish (Danio rerio). Subsequent studies
identified ‘true’ MSTN-2 genes also in the rainbow trout
[22]. These studies have also shown that, in contrast to
mammals, fish express MSTN not only in red and white
muscle, but also in other tissues, suggesting that MSTN
might function in fish not only in growth but also in
other physiological processes. The pattern of expression
of the two genes differs between various fish species. In
S. aurata MSTN-1 is ubiquitously expressed in various
tissues including muscle, whereas MSTN-2 mRNA is
expressed mainly in the brain including olfactory and
optic lobes [23,24]. By contrast, in other fish species
(coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) [25], Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) [26], zebrafish [27] and rainbow trout
(Oncorhynchus mykiss) [22]) MSTN-2 is expressed not
only in brain but also in other tissues, including muscle.
The goal of our research is to develop new technology
based on MSTN in order to enhance fish muscle
growth. To gain insight into the regulation of MSTN
genes in fish, we recently reported the cloning and characterization of MSTN-1 promoter from a commercially
very important marine fish species in the Mediterranean
region, S. aurata. In that study, we showed that the
proximal promoter is highly conserved in fish. We also
provided experimental evidence for the function of the
5’ flanking region of MSTN-1 gene as promoter using
luciferase reporter gene assay and A204 cells [28]. The
current study was undertaken in order to expand our
knowledge of MSTN-2 in fish by characterizing the
structure of the MSTN-2 gene and its 5’ flanking region
in S. aurata. We describe the genomic organization of
the MSTN-2 gene and promoter in S. aurata and the
discovery of polymorphism of both the promoter
and the first intron, probably as a result of chromosomal

re-arrangements. These studies also show that the various alleles are inherited in a Mendelian manner.

Methods
Fish and tissues

S. aurata fish for this study were obtained from several
sources as detailed below. In addition, three full-sib
families of S. aurata were produced at The National
Center of Mariculture, Eilat, Israel by Drs. S. Gorshkov
and G. Gorshkova using gametes from stripped fish and
artificial fertilization. Cross 1 (sire PIT tag #0661; dam
#5E4D) was chosen since the parents were found to be
heterozygotes for the two loci examined (Table 1).
A progeny, consisting of 27 fingerlings (one group of
small fingerlings with mean body weight 0.16 gr and a
second group of large fingerlings with mean body weight
of 1 gr) was used for analysis of Mendelian inheritance.
Five collections of DNA samples from S. aurata were
used for the analysis of MSTN-2 gene and promoter
polymorphism: fingerlings from two hatcheries in Israel:
Ardag Red Sea Mariculture, Eilat (60 individuals,
3-month-old fingerlings spawned at the same time), and
The Israel Salt Company, Atlit (52 individuals). The
third collection, from Instituto Nacional de Investigaçao
das Pescas (INIP; Olhão, Portugal), consisted of 19 individuals; the fourth collection consisted of 23 individuals
from a wild population caught near Ancona, Italy. The
fifth collection (’GC’ collection) consisted of 15 individuals of unknown geographic origin, from Mevo’ot Yam
School, Michmoret, Israel. The fingerlings from the two
Israeli hatcheries belonged to two size groups, in order
to test for a possible association between growth
and allele/genotype distribution. The Atlit hatchery had
a recently established population (3 generations) of
S. aurata from different geographical origins; the collection consisted of 25 fingerlings with a “Normal” phenotype (0.1 g body weight), and 27 individuals with the
largest size “Jumper” phenotype [29] (1 g body weight).
The second collection, from the Ardag hatchery, was
from a partially domesticated population (5-10 generations in captivity) that underwent three generations of
growth selection and consisted of 30 fingerlings with the
largest size “Large” phenotype (4.3 g) and 30 individuals
with the smallest size “Small” phenotype (0.25 g). The
fish making up the size groups were identified during
body weight selection by the fish farmers. This practice is
routinely done at the fish farms to overcome behavioral
problems (cannibalism, competition for food, etc.) which
result from differences in body size. Therefore, similar
size groups were kept in separate tanks until sampling.
Fin clips were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept
at -70°C until DNA was extracted. In few experiments,
fin clips were put in absolute ethanol and kept at 4°C.

The results show no statistically significant deviation from Mendelian inheritance for alleles (0.9 >> P >> 0.10), but statistically significant deviation from
Mendelian inheritance for genotypes (P << 0.05).

Fish were humanely euthanized and brains taken for
RNA extraction. The brains were snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen and kept at -70°C until RNA extraction.
Cloning of S. aurata myostatin-2 (saMSTN-2) promoter

Genomic DNA was isolated from fin clips using the protocol described earlier [30]. Two S. aurata fish were used
for cloning the promoter: fish #17G which was found,
following sequencing, to display two alleles of the promoter, named by us ‘a’ and ‘b’ (see Results section) and fish
#0661 (sire of cross 1) which was found to be a heterozygote following the progeny analysis (see Results section),
having the ‘b’ allele and a third allele, named by us ‘c’.
The saMSTN-2 promoter was isolated from genomic
DNA, digested with several restriction enzymes, using
the linker-mediated PCR method [31]. The protocol used
was similar to that reported earlier by us for cloning S.
aurata fast skeletal myosin light chain-2 promoter
(saMLC2f) [32], with minor changes. The nested PCR
was performed by using the two linker-specific primers
(L1 and L2) and two gene-specific primers (MSTNb-1
and MSTNb-2). The gene-specific primers were designed
based on the nucleotide sequence of S. aurata MSTN-2

cDNA [GenBank accession number AY046314; [24]],
complementary to the 5’ end of the cDNA. The primers
used in the study reported here are listed in Additional
file 1. The amplified fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels, purified by QIAquick Gel
Extraction Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and
cloned in pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, VI,
USA). Plasmid DNA was purified by the QIAprep Spin
Miniprep Kit (Qiagen GmbH) and sequenced. Comparison between the new sequences with that of MSTN-2
cDNA from S. aurata [24] confirmed their identity as
being derived from the MSTN-2 gene.
Cloning of S. aurata myostatin-2 (saMSTN-2) full length
gene

The full-length of saMSTN-2 gene sequence was amplified
by PCR, using genomic DNA from fins of three S. aurata
individuals: fish #17G (found following sequencing to display two alleles of the first intron, named by us 1R and 2R),
fish #33 (found following sequencing also to possess allele
2R), and fish #13RD (found following sequencing to display
a third allele of the first intron, named by us 4R). The primers MSTNb-2fw and MSTNb-7 (Additional file 1), were

Nadjar-Boger and Funkenstein BMC Genetics 2011, 12:22
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/22

designed based on the published nucleotide sequence of
saMSTN-2 mRNA. The target sequence corresponds to the
region extending 10 bp upstream from the translation start
codon to 21 bp downstream of the stop codon. PCR reactions were performed using 3.75 Units of a proofreading
Taq DNA polymerase (Expand Long Template PCR System; Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) in 1X
Buffer 2, 0.3 μM of each primer, and 0.35 mM of each
nucleotide. After an initial denaturation step (3 min, 94°C),
amplification was performed for 35 cycles (one cycle: 25
sec at 94°C, 45 sec at 61°C, 3 min at 68°C) followed by a
final elongation period of 10 min at 68°C. The amplified
fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose
gel and purified by QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit. To facilitate “T/A cloning” into pGEM-T Easy vector, the PCR products were polyA-tailed according to the procedure
outlined in the pGEM-T Easy Technical Manual and
cloned in pGEM-T Easy vector. Plasmid DNA was purified
as above and was first sequenced with primers SP6 and T7.
Additional primers were subsequently designed, according
to the resulting sequences, in order to obtain the fulllength sequence of the cloned gene: exon1-248fw, intron1501fw, exon2-56fw, exon2-187rev (Additional file 1). The
donor and acceptor splice sites were identified by comparison of the genomic sequences with the published cDNA
sequence as well as our own mRNA sequence obtained
from S. aurata brain (data not shown).
Identification of transcription start site by rapid
amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)

The transcription start site was identified with the FirstChoice® RLM-RACE kit (Ambion, Inc. Austin, TX, USA),
following the manufacturer’s protocol, using total RNA (5
μg) from S. aurata brain, 5’RACE adaptor (Ambion) and
random hexamers for reverse transcription. Primers for
this 5’RACE nested PCR (MSTN2-exon2-261rev and
MSTN2-exon2-187rev, Additional file 1) were designed
based on the MSTN-2 cDNA sequence. The 600 bp amplified fragment was gel-purified, and sequenced.
Analysis of saMSTN-2 promoter polymorphism

Analysis of promoter polymorphism was carried out by
PCR amplifications of genomic DNAs from the collections described above using a reverse primer complementary to the 5’end of MSTN-2 coding region (MSTNb-1),
which is in a region identical in all alleles. The forward
primers were specific to each allele of MSTN-2 promoter,
designed according to the sequences obtained from the
cloned promoter fragments. The sequences of the primers are shown in Additional file 1. PCR reactions were
performed using 1.25 Units of Taq DNA polymerase
(New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) in 1× ThermoPol reaction Buffer, 0.5 μM of each primer, and
0.2 mM of each nucleotide. After an initial denaturation

Page 4 of 19

step (3 min, 95°C), amplification was performed for 30
cycles (one cycle: 45 sec at 95°C, 45 sec at 55°C, 2.5 min at
72°C) followed by a final elongation period of 10 min at
72°C. Amplification and length polymorphism of the various alleles at the promoter locus were detected according
to the relative electrophoretic mobility of the PCR products
on 1% agarose gel. Allele ‘b’, amplified using the ‘b’-specific
primers pair MSTNb-1/MSTNb-10 migrated as 1.4 kb.
Allele ‘c’, amplified using the ‘c’-specific primers pair
MSTNb-1/MSTNb-13 migrated as 1.7 kb. Alleles ‘a’ and
‘as’, amplified using the ‘a’-specific primers pair MSTNb-1/
MSTNb-11 migrated as 1.9 and 1.7 kb, respectively.
Analysis of saMSTN-2 intron1 polymorphism

Genomic DNAs from the five different collections (see
above) were also used for analysis of intron 1 polymorphism
by exon-primed intron-crossing (EPIC)-polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) [33]. A pair of intron-spanning primers was
designed in flanking exons based on the nucleotide
sequence of saMSTN-2 gene: MSTN-2-exon1-248fw and
MSTN-2-exon2-187rev (Additional file 1). The amplified
fragment included in addition to MSTN-2 intron 1 also
79 bp of exon 1 and 187 bp of exon 2. PCR reactions were
performed using 1.25 Units of Taq DNA polymerase in 1×
ThermoPol reaction Buffer, 0.5 μM of each primer, and 0.2
mM of each nucleotide. After an initial denaturation step
(3 min, 95°C), amplification was performed for 35 cycles
(one cycle: 45 sec at 94°C, 45 sec at 60°C, 2 min at 72°C)
followed by a final elongation period of 10 min at 72°C.
Length polymorphism of the various alleles at the intron 1
locus was detected according to the relative electrophoretic
mobility of the PCR products on 1% agarose gel. Alleles 1R,
2R and 4R migrated as 1050, 1200 and 1500 bp, respectively. 1R and 2R refer to the presence of one or two copies
of a 150 bp repeat at the 5’-end of the intron.
Sequence analysis

The gene sequence, including repeat sequences, was
analyzed both manually and by using BLASTN and nr/
nt database of NCBI [34]. A multiple-sequence prealignment was performed using ClustalW [http://www.
ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/,[35]], and refined by hand. The DNA
sequence of the promoter and gene were analyzed with
Gene Runner, Version 3.05 (Copyright © 1994 Hastings
software Inc) for restriction sites, with the TESS (Transcription Element Search Software on the WWW) program [http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/tess/tess, [36]]
for presence of transcription factors and with the
RepeatMasker program for the presence of transposable
elements http://www.repeatmasker.org.

coefficient as well as c2 tests for deviation from HardyWeinberg equilibrium were calculated by AMOVA
(Analysis of Molecular Variance) using GenAlEx 6.1
[37]. Mendelian inheritance of the two DNA markers in
progeny of a full-sib family was determined using c 2
test. UPGMA Cluster was done by using Nei [38]
genetic distance and the TFPGA version 1.3 program
[39] (1000 dememorization steps; 10 batches; 2000 permutations per batch).

Results
Isolation of saMSTN-2 gene upstream sequences
(saMSTN-2 promoter)

Ten genomic fragments, containing the 5’ flanking
region of saMSTN-2 gene, were isolated using genomic
DNA from a single fish (#17G) digested with various
restriction enzymes using the linker-mediated method
(detailed in Materials and Methods). The genomic fragments ranged from 131 bp to 1857 bp in length. All
fragments started 7 bp downstream of the translation
start codon ATG of saMSTN-2 gene (corresponding to
primer MSTNb-2), and extended to the 5’ flanking
region. In few cases, more than one fragment was
amplified from the same digestion; probably due to the
presence of additional genomic DNA fragments cleaved
at sites other than the specific restriction site. Comparison of the new sequences with that of saMSTN-2 cDNA
[[24], AY046314] confirmed their identity as being
derived from the MSTN-2 gene (31 bp identity: from
7 bp downstream to 24 bp upstream of the ATG translation start codon). The presence of an identical 3’ end
(1050 bp long) in all fragments indicated that they were
amplified from the same gene. A poly(A) repeat of 17 to
27 nt was found at the proximal promoter, approximately at position -117. Two potential binding sites for
transcription factors, important for basal gene transcription, flank this repeat: immediately upstream, a binding
site for the TATA binding protein (TBP) and downstream a CAAT box (details of the sequence analysis
related to location of transcription factors as well as
promoter activity of the various cloned fragments are
included in a separate paper). Surprisingly, comparison
between the sequences from the ten genomic fragments
revealed close identity within the first 1050 bp located 5’
to the first ATG codon but divergence of sequences
located further upstream into two groups (Figure 1,
Figure 2). This result suggested that there are at least two
alleles of the MSTN-2 promoter, named by us MSTN-2a
and MSTN-2b, which are present in the genomic DNA
used for cloning the promoter. In addition to this major
difference between the two alleles, many small differences
(Single Nucleotide Polymorphism, SNPs) were found
(Additional file 2 and sequences comparison in Figure 1
and Figure 2). As explained below, later on we identified

Page 5 of 19

an additional allele, MSTN-2c, which is included as well
in Figure 1, Figure 2 and in Additional file 2.
In order to confirm the existence of two different
alleles of the saMSTN-2 promoter, genomic DNA from
several S. aurata DNA collections (see Materials and
Methods for details) were screened for the presence of
these alleles: PCR amplifications were carried out using
a reverse primer complementary to the 5’end of the
MSTN-2 coding region (MSTNb-1) which is in a region
identical in both alleles and forward allele-specific primers (MSTNb-10 and MSTNb-11, see Materials and
Methods for details and Figure 1 and Figure 2 for primers’ location). The results confirmed that the
saMSTN-2 promoter is polymorphic: amplification was
observed in most individuals when the MSTN-2b specific primer was used (158 individuals out of 169),
whereas only few individuals showed amplification when
MSTN-2a specific primer was used (24 individuals out
of 169). In some individuals amplification was seen with
both sets of primers, while in others amplification was
obtained with only one set but not with the other, indicating that these are two different alleles of saMSTN-2
promoter, and not two different genes. The reasoning
being that if these two forms represented two genes,
one would expect to obtain amplification with both sets
of primers for all the individuals. Moreover, the results
indicate that the MSTN-2a allele is a rare allele, as it is
poorly represented in the populations studied. Furthermore, in 6 out of the 24 individuals showing amplified
fragments using the MSTN-2a specific primer, a shorter
fragment than the expected one was obtained. Partial
sequence analysis of this fragment confirmed its homology to MSTN-2a allele, but this “short” MSTN-2a allele
(MSTN-2as) had in addition to SNPs and small deletions (Additional file 2), also a major deletion of 192
nucleotides between -1308 and -1499 of saMSTN-2a
(Figure 1 and Figure 3). Unexpectedly, in 6 individuals
no amplification was obtained with either of the two
allele-specific primers pairs, suggesting the existence of
yet another variant of saMSTN-2 promoter, with an
unknown sequence.
Allele segregation analysis of the saMSTN-2 promoter
region: evidence for the presence of an additional allele

In order to confirm that the alleles of saMSTN-2 5’
flanking region were of the same gene and did not originate in two different genes (paralogs), and also to test
for the mode of inheritance, the segregation of
saMSTN-2 alleles ‘a’ and ‘b’ was determined in S. aurata
progeny of a full-sib family. The three available crosses
were tested for the presence of MSTN-2a and/or
MSTN-2b allele by PCR analysis using the allele-specific
primer pairs as described above. Only the parents of
Cross 1 proved to have different alleles of the MSTN-2

Figure 1 Nucleotide sequence alignment of saMSTN-2 promoter alleles (distal promoter). Sequences for saMSTN-2b and -2a alleles are
consensus sequences of 10 different clones of various length at the 5’ end, obtained from fish #17G genomic DNA. Partial sequence for saMSTN2as is a consensus sequence of amplified fragment of two genomic DNAs, #8C and #13C, from the fifth DNA collection, which was obtained by
PCR using the ‘a’-specific forward primer MSTNb-11 and reverse primer MSTNb-1 and sequenced with primer MSTNb-11. Sequence for saMSTN2c is the consensus sequence from two clones obtained from amplified genomic DNA of fish #13 from the Ardag collection using the ‘c’-specific
forward primer MSTNb-14 and reverse primer MSTNb-7, cloned in pGEM-Teasy vector and sequenced with primers T7/SP6, MSTNb-3 and
MSTNb-1. The first 19 nucleotides of allele ‘c’ derived from the cloned fragment of genomic DNA of fish #0661 (sire of cross1) (see Materials and
Methods). Sequences corresponding to primers are underlined with single black line and the names are indicated underneath. Repeated

promoter whereas the parents of the two other crosses
were homozygotes for allele ‘b’. In Cross 1 the dam was
a heterozygote (a/b) while the sire was b/b (although
later on we found that it possesses a third allele ‘c’, see
below). According to the Mendelian mode of inheritance, the expected allele segregation of one gene with
two alleles in the progeny of parental genotypes as

described above, is 50% a/b and 50% b/b. However, the
results were different: only 11% (3 out of 26 individuals)
showed amplification with both ‘a’-specific and ‘b’-specific primers sets, while 58% (15 out of 26 individuals)
showed amplification only with ‘b’- specific primers.
Surprisingly, 31% (8 out of 26 individuals) showed
amplification only with the ‘a’-specific primers, although

Figure 2 Nucleotide sequence alignment of saMSTN-2 promoter alleles (proximal promoter). Details are as in Figure 1. Position +1 has
been assigned to the first nucleotide of the translation start codon ATG. The sequence in italics is the consensus sequence for the polymorphic
mononucleotide repeat: the first mononucleotide A repeat (from -93 to -101) varies from 8 to 11 bp, and the second A mononucleotide repeat
(from -103 to -116) varies from 14 to 23 bp. Sequences highlighted in color are non-identical sequences between a, b, c, and as alleles (yellow,
pink, turquoise and green, respectively). In bold letters is the sequence obtained by 5’RACE using brain RNA. TATA and CCAAT boxes are boxed.
GenBank Accession numbers of MSTN-2a, -2b, -2as and -2c are GQ379809, GQ379810, GQ379811, and HQ380026, respectively.

no a/a progeny was expected. However, if we hypothesize that the sire is heterozygote for MSTN-2 promoter
and carries, in addition to one copy of MSTN-2b allele,
another variant of MSTN-2 promoter (that we called
MSTN-2c), not recognized by ‘a’- and ‘b’-specific sets of

primers, then the expected genotypes for one gene with
three alleles are a/b, b/b, a/c and b/c. In this case, with
primers only for ‘a’ and ‘b’ alleles, genotypes b/b and b/c
cannot be differentiated and a/c would be seen as ‘a’
only.

Cloning of a third variant of the saMSTN-2 promoter

The third variant (allele ‘c’) of the saMSTN-2 promoter
was cloned using genomic DNA from the sire of Cross
1 (see above), which was suspected to be a b/c heterozygote. Genomic fragments of various sizes, containing the
5’ flanking region of saMSTN-2 gene, were obtained
using the linker-mediated method (detailed in Materials
and Methods). Fragments that were longer than ~1.3 kb
were tested by PCR amplification using the ‘b’-specific
pair of primers to determine if they were derived from
the ‘b’ allele, in order to be eliminated. One fragment of
~1.6 kb did not yield an amplification product, suggesting that it was derived from allele ‘c’. This fragment was
isolated, cloned and sequenced. Comparison of this
sequence with those of MSTN-2a and MSTN-2b promoter alleles confirmed the existence of a new MSTN-2
promoter allele: MSTN-2c (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The
sequence of the first 1050 bp upstream of the translation start codon ATG of allele ‘c’ is almost identical to
alleles ‘a’ and ‘b’; between nucleotides -1050 and -1088
the sequence is almost the same as allele ‘a’ but different
from that of allele ‘b’. Upstream of nucleotide -1088 the
sequences differ completely (Figure 1). In addition,
many SNPs were found between MSTN-2c and the two
other alleles, probably in part due to the fact that the
DNA used for cloning allele ‘c’ originated from an individual of a different collection than the one used
for cloning MSTN-2a and MSTN-2b (Additional file 2,
Figure 1 and Figure 2).
Careful sequence analysis of the region upstream of
the first 1050 bp in the three alleles showed that several
elements appear to be repeated in some or all
sequences, at different positions (see Figure 3A for a
schematic illustration and Figure 3B for sequences comparisons). The first identified element, box 1, is 105 bp
long; it is present in all the alleles and appears twice in
MSTN-2c allele. The two boxes are separated by 276 bp,
which represent allele ‘c’-specific sequences, showing no
homology to any other region or to any other allele.
Upstream of box 1, we identified two boxes, box 2 and
box 3, that in allele ‘c’ are juxtaposed whereas in allele
‘a’ are separated by a 19 bp long element, representing
an ‘a’-specific sequence. Box 1 in allele ‘b’ and box 3 in
allele ‘a’ are preceded by ‘b’- or ‘a’-specific sequences.
Analysis of allele segregation in the saMSTN-2 promoter

In light of the discovery of a third promoter variant,
MSTN-2c, cloned from the sire of cross 1, the presence
of the MSTN-2c allele in the sire and progeny was
determined by PCR amplification of genomic DNA
using ‘c’-specific primers set (see Materials and Methods). The forward primer was located in the ‘c’-specific
region (outside the boxes). As expected, the use of allele
‘c’-specific primers pair resulted in an amplified

Page 9 of 19

fragment both in the sire and in the progeny (Table 1).
The expected allele segregation of one gene with three
alleles in the progeny of parents that are heterozygotes
a/b and b/c, considering a Mendelian inheritance, is a:b:
c in a 1:2:1 ratio. The allele frequency in the full-sib
progeny was 21%:60%:19% (Table 1). The calculated c2
value (1.962) falls between the critical values of 10% and
90% and therefore, the hypothesis of a Mendelian
inheritance of one gene with three alleles is accepted.
However, when the genotypes segregation was analyzed, a significant difference (c2 = 11.846, p < 0.01) was
found between the observed and expected genotype frequencies (Table 1).
Cloning and molecular organization of saMSTN-2 full
length gene

The saMSTN-2 gene, amplified from genomic DNA
using primers MSTNb-2fw and MSTNb-7, spans about
2.4 kb. The sequence and primer locations are illustrated in Figure 4. The gene has three exons encoding
an open reading frame of 1077 bp, which is translated
into a 358 amino acid long preproMSTN-2. The three
exons are interrupted by two introns, both with consensus 5’ and 3’ intron splice sites (Figure 4).
Surprisingly, analysis of the resulting PCR products
revealed a doublet of approximately 2.3-2.5 kb for DNA
#17G (see Materials and Methods) and only one band of
a similar size as the upper band of DNA #17G, for DNA
#33, suggesting the existence of at least two alleles of
the MSTN-2 gene. Since in DNA #33 only one fragment
was amplified, we predicted that these two fragments do
not represent two paralogs but are rather two alleles of
the same gene, which are present as a homozygote in
fish #33 and as a heterozygote in fish #17G. Sequence
analysis of the three fragments: 1R-17G (the lower fragment from #17G), 2R-17G (the upper fragment from
#17G) and the fragment from #33 (2R-33), confirmed
that 2R-33 was almost identical to 2R-17G (except for
SNPs, see Additional file 3). Moreover, comparison of
the three genomic fragments to previously determined
MSTN-2 cDNA sequences confirmed their identity as
being derived from the MSTN-2 gene.
The size difference observed between the amplified
genomic fragments is due to differences in the length of
intron 1 which is 783 bp in 1R-17G, while 2R-17G is
938 bp long (937 bp in 2R-33) (Figure 5). Sequence analysis of the two alleles revealed that the length difference
is due to the presence of one or two copies of a
repeated block of approximately 150 bp located at the
5’end of intron 1 (Figure 5). The two repeats in 2R-17G
and 2R-33 show 73% identity whereas the repeat present
in 1R-17G shows a higher identity (93%) to the second
repeat in both 2R-17G and 2R-33 than to the first
repeat in 2R-17G and 2R-33 (only 80% identity).

Figure 4 Sequence analysis of saMSTN-2 gene. Comparison between saMSTN-2 gene and the published saMSTN-2 cDNA sequences. MSTN-2
(2R-17G) refers to the nucleotide sequence of saMSTN-2 gene based on 2R-17G allele. Deduced amino acid sequence is shown in single-letter
code. Sequences corresponding to primers are underlined and the names are indicated underneath. Exons are in uppercase and introns in
lowercase letters. Exon1: 328 bp; Intron1: 938 bp; Exon2: 371 bp; Intron2: 338 bp; Exon3: 381 bp (until stop codon TGA); +1 refers to the first
nucleotide of the translation start codon. The two nucleotides that are different from the published sequence are highlighted. GenBank
accession number for saMSTN-2 gene sequence (MSTN-2 variant 2R-17G) is GQ379805. AY046314, MSTN-2 cDNA sequence [24].

The transcriptional start site of the saMSTN-2 gene
was determined using the 5’ RACE technique. A transcription initiation region was identified (Figure 2) at
position -14 from the translation start codon. This site
is located 10-nucleotides downstream of the 5’ end of
the previously reported sea bream MSTN-2 cDNA [24].
The saMSTN-2 gene is polymorphic in length:
identification of a third allele of intron 1

In order to determine if the intronic alleles are rare or
common, several S. aurata DNA collections (the same
as those used for analysis of the promoter polymorphism, see above) were tested for the presence of these
alleles, using EPIC-PCR (see Materials and Methods).
Surprisingly, in addition to the two expected alleles, an
additional fragment was amplified, migrating at a higher

molecular weight. This fragment appeared either alone
(homozygote state) or together with one of the expected
bands for 1R or 2R alleles (heterozygote state). The new
allele was termed 4R since we predicted that it might
contain four repeats of the 150 bp unit. However, cloning and sequence analysis of the 4R-PCR fragment from
three independent DNA samples revealed the existence
of a 323 bp insertion, located 116 bp upstream of the 3’
end of saMSTN-2 intron 1, and not at the 5’ end of the
intron, where the repeats are located (see scheme in
Figure 6). No identity was found between this 4R-specific insertion and the repeated sequences found at the
5’ end of MSTN-2 intron 1. In addition to this major difference, several minor differences (SNPs) were observed
between 1R, 2R and 4R alleles (Additional file 3). In
order to compare the entire gene sequence containing

the 4R allele to the two other alleles, the region from
10 bp upstream of the translation start codon to 21 bp
downstream of the stop codon was amplified (using the
same primers as those used for cloning the gene containing 1R and 2R alleles, as described above), cloned and
sequenced. We confirmed that no major differences exist
between the 4R and the 1R and 2R alleles, except for the
previously identified insertion at the 3’ end of saMSTN-2
intron 1, but many SNPs (small deletions and small additions) were found (see Additional file 3). Furthermore,
PCR amplification of genomic DNA from two fish carrying two alleles combinations - alleles ‘a’ and 1R or allele
‘c’ and 4R - using a forward primer located at the promoter and a reverse primer located at the 3’ UTR of the
gene, verified that indeed these alleles originated from
one single gene.

In order to confirm that the alleles of intron 1 belong to
the same gene and are also inherited in a Mendelian
way, the segregation of saMSTN-2 intronic alleles was
determined by EPIC-PCR (see Materials and Methods).
As observed above for the promoter alleles, only parents
of Cross 1 were heterozygotes for intron 1 of MSTN-2:
the dam was 1R/2R and the sire 2R/4R (Table 1). The
two other crosses were homozygotes for allele 2R and
therefore were not included in the analysis. Genotypes
of MSTN-2 intron1 were determined in 27 individuals
of Cross 1 full-sib progeny. The expected allele segregation of the progeny for one gene with three alleles is
1R:2R:4R with a 1:2:1 ratio (Table 1). The calculated c2
value (1.999) for the observed allele frequency falls
between the critical values of 10% and 90% (Table 1).
Therefore, the hypothesis that the observed allele frequencies are as predicted by Mendelian inheritance for
three alleles of one gene was accepted.
However, when the genotype segregation was analyzed, a significant difference was found between the
observed and expected genotype frequencies. The results
obtained were as follow: 1R/2R, n = 4; 2R/2R, n = 13;
1R/4R, n = 8; 2R/4R, n = 2 (Table 1). The numbers

differ significantly from the expected 6.75 in each genotype class (c2 = 10.481, p < 0.025).
Analysis of saMSTN-2 promoter and intron 1
polymorphism and relation to fish size or fish origin

The frequency of saMSTN-2c allele in S. aurata populations was determined using the same DNA collections
that were screened earlier for the presence of saMSTN2a and saMSTN-2b alleles (see above), and a similar
strategy (allele ‘c’-specific primers pair). Genotype and
allele frequency data for the promoter and intron
1 alleles are summarized in Table 2. A c2 test analysis
for both loci showed that the populations analyzed conform to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, suggesting that
they represent panmictic groups.
The results of the analysis of promoter allele frequencies in the various collections (detailed in Additional file
4) can be summarized as follow: (i) The MSTN-2a promoter allele appeared to be a rare allele (24 out of 338)
compared to MSTN-2b and MSTN-2c alleles (235/338
and 79/338, respectively); (ii) The rare allele MSTN-2a
was observed only in a heterozygous state; (iii) The
MSTN-2c allele was also mainly found at a heterozygous
state (6 homozygotes compared to 67 heterozygotes);
(iv) The frequency of the ‘a’ allele was very low (0-0.8%)
in Ardag and Portuguese collections. By contrast, Atlit,
the wild population from Italy and the ‘G/C’ collections
had much higher frequencies of the ‘a’ allele (13.5%,
10.9% and 13.4%, respectively); (v) The ‘b’ allele had a
similar frequency in four of the DNA collections, except
for Atlit; (vi) In two of the collections with a higher
allele ‘a’ frequency, this increase was at the expense of
the MSTN-2c allele frequency, which decreased;
(vii) The frequencies of homozygotes and heterozygotes
carrying MSTN-2b allele differed between the various
DNA collections. In the Atlit and Portuguese collections
we found fewer homozygotes than heterozygotes (19
and 7 homozygotes vs 26 and 12 heterozygotes, respectively) whereas in the Italian and the ‘G/C’ collections,
homozygotes and heterozygotes were observed in the
same proportions (10 and 7 homozygotes compared to
13 and 8 heterozygotes, respectively). On the other
hand, in the partially domesticated Ardag stock, the
ratio between homozygotes and heterozygotes was
reversed (34 homozygotes and 22 heterozygotes).
Allele frequency analysis of saMSTN-2 intron 1 in the
five collections (detailed in additional file 5), showed the
following: (i) The 1R allele appeared to be a much rarer
allele (11/338) than the 4R allele (97/338) and the most
commonly observed 2R allele (230/338); (ii) The rare allele
1R was observed only in a heterozygous state (one 1R/4R
compared to 10 1R/2R); (iii) Overall, the 2R allele was
observed at almost the same frequency in the heterozygous and homozygous state (70 and 80 fish, respectively).

In hatcheries from Atlit and Ardag two size groups were included in the analysis: large and average (Atlit); large and small (Ardag).

However, the proportion of heterozygotes and homozygotes differed amongst the five collections. In the Portuguese and Atlit collections, we found more homozygotes
than heterozygotes (13 and 30 2R-homozygotes vs 6 and
20 2R-heterozygotes, respectively). In the ‘G/C’ and Italian
collections, homozygotes and heterozygotes were observed
at the same proportions (7 and 12 compared to 8 and 11)
while in the partially domesticated Ardag stock the ratio
between homozygotes and heterozygotes was reversed (18
2R-homozygotes and 25 2R-heterozygotes); (iv) The 4R
allele was observed almost exclusively as a heterozygous
state in four of our collections (only one 4R-homozygote
vs 37 4R-heterozygotes). By contrast, in the Ardag hatchery a substantial proportion of 4R-homozygotes were
found (17 4R-homozygotes vs 24 4R-heterozygotes). (v)
The frequency of the 1R allele was very low (0-0.8%) in
the Ardag and Portuguese collections whereas in the Atlit,
Italian and ‘G/C’ collections a higher frequency was found
(4.8%, 6.5% and 6.7%, respectively). By contrast, the 2R
and 4R alleles showed a slightly different pattern. Whereas

all collections except for Ardag had similar frequencies of
the 2R allele (73%-84%), the Ardag population had 51%.
With respect to the 4R allele, the frequency in Ardag was
48% while in all other collections it ranged between 16%
and 20% (additional file 5).
The analysis of heterozygosity of both polymorphic
loci in all five populations is summarized in Table 3.
Observed heterozygosity was slightly higher than
expected heterozygosity in all populations except RD
(Ardag). The latter was the only population with a positive value of Fis, indicating deficiency in heterozygotes
and inbreeding, whereas in all other collections negative
values were found for Fis, indicating outbreeding and
random mating. The observation that the various alleles
were unevenly represented in the populations, with few
being rare, agrees with the calculated effective allele
number being lower than the actual number of alleles
(Table 3).
To determine whether there is an association between
allele distribution and growth in a hatchery population,

we analyzed the genotype and allele frequencies distribution between two size groups for the two Israeli
hatcheries. The data is included in additional file 4 and
additional file 5. Such an evaluation revealed no significant difference in the frequency of MSTN-2 promoter
alleles between large and small fish in the Ardag hatchery. By contrast, in the Atlit hatchery “large” fish showed
a lower frequency of allele ‘a’ and a higher frequency of
allele ‘c’ compared to the “average” body weight group
(9.3% vs 18% for allele ‘a’ and 29.6% vs 20% for allele
‘c’). No difference in allele frequency between the two
size groups in the two hatcheries was seen with respect
to MSTN-2 intron 1 (Additional file 5).
Heterozygosity calculated separately for the two sizeselected groups in the two commercial hatcheries is
summarized in Table 4. Values of observed heterozygosity were slightly higher than expected in Atlit samples
(ATL and ATM) while in Ardag (RDS and RDL) values
of observed heterozygosity were slightly lower than
expected and the inbreeding coefficient was positive,
suggesting deficiency of heterozygosity in Ardag
hatchery.
UPGMA Cluster analysis using Nei’s genetic distances
[38] for both polymorphic loci showed that the ‘GC’ fish
and the wild population from Italy are similar, as are
‘Atlit’ and the fish from Portugal while all four are different from ‘Ardag’ (Figure 7).

Discussion
In the present study we report on the identification of
polymorphism of both the promoter and first intron of
MSTN-2 gene in the marine fish, S. aurata. We found
three alleles of the first intron and three alleles of the

promoter. Sequences comparison of the alleles showed
that polymorphism of the introns is due to the presence
of one or two repeated blocks of 150 bp, resulting in
the alleles 1R and 2R. The third allele, 4R, had an additional insertion of a DNA block of 323 bp. In the case
of the promoter variation, the different alleles contain
blocks of repeated sequences in addition to allele-specific sequences. We also found some SNPs and INDELs
(gaps in sequences alignment), which could potentially
reflect other alleles, but a more comprehensive study of
a larger number of samples using PCR-SSCP would be
required to confirm this possibility, and we hope to do
this in a future study.
The allele polymorphism in the five populations that
were analyzed in the current study is based on differential mobility of amplified DNA by gel electrophoresis.
Several lines of evidence led to our conclusion that
these alleles originated from the same gene and are not
paralogs. First, analysis of allele segregation of the two
DNA markers in a full-sib progeny showed that both

are inherited in a Mendelian way. Second, analysis of
individuals from several DNA collections (several cultured and one wild population) showed the existence of
only one (homozygote state) or two variants (heterozygote state) for each of the DNA markers. If these were
paralogs, one would expect to see all variants in each
individual.
The presence of repeated blocks of DNA in the promoter and in the first intron of saMSTN-2 gene suggests
that both have been subjected to various chromosomal
rearrangements during the course of evolution, reflecting
events such as insertions, deletions or duplication,
although we can only speculate on the mechanism. For
example, an event of recombination between the two
boxes 1 in allele ‘c’ of the promoter could have generated
allele ‘a’. The model suggested for co-initiation of intraallelic duplication, conversion and crossover in human
minisatellites [40], and the revised model for meiotic
mutation events demonstrating the formation of intraallelic events with duplications flanking the converted
motifs [41], might explain the events leading to the generation of the 2R intronic allele from the 1R intronic
allele. Generation of 4R intronic allele could be the result
of breakpoints and translocation of a genomic DNA fragment from the osteocalcin gene to MSTN-2 gene or vice
versa (see also below). Interestingly, a polymorphism of
MSTN 5’ regulatory region as a result of an insertion of
386 bp was described recently in pigs [42].
The RepeatMasker program failed to find any transposable elements in saMSTN-2 promoter variants or in
saMSTN-2 gene. A BLAST search using the various
alleles of saMSTN-2 promoter did not find any significant
sequence similarity apart from the first 31 nucleotides of
saMSTN-2 mRNA. Similarly, a BLAST search using the
full-length saMSTN-2 gene sequence found similarity
only with GDF-8 (MSTN) sequences, while a search
using alleles 1R and 2R of intron 1 of saMSTN-2 did not
find any similar sequence, suggesting that the repeat
region is unique to intron1 of saMSTN-2 gene. Interestingly, BLAST search using the 4R allele of intron 1
showed a 92% identity between the region spanning
nucleotide 822 to 1142 (4R-specific region) and S. aurata
osteocalcin gene [Accession Number AF289506; [43]],
from nucleotide 2655 to 2971, which corresponds to part
of osteocalcin intron 2. This 320 bp identity between the
two genes may reflect an event of duplication and translocation that occurred in S. aurata genome during the
course of evolution. In the absence of chromosomal
assignment to both genes, it is difficult to propose if this
event was DNA shuffling between two chromosomes or
within the same chromosome. Linkage analysis assigned
osteocalcin to Radiation hybrid 24 together with growth
hormone (GH) and prolactin [44] but no information is
available on the MSTN-2 location. However, data from

Page 15 of 19

Ensembl shows that in both Tetraodon and zebrafish,
MSTN-2 and osteocalcin genes are located on different
chromosomes. Thus, in Tetraodon MSTN-2 is located on
chr 3 and osteocalcin on chr 11 and in zebrafish MSTN-2
is on chr 22 and osteocalcin on chr 14. We have not yet
identified upstream sequences that should be identical
for all the promoter alleles. This will become possible
only by cloning much longer genomic fragments than
those obtained in the current study.
It should be emphasized that all the sequenced alleles
of saMSTN-2 first intron contain the consensus donor
site gtaagt and acceptor site tttcttccag. The second
intron also has consensus sites with donor gtaagc and
acceptor tttctttccag. Nevertheless, although intron 1 of
saMSTN-2 has typical exon/intron splice site sequences,
the BDGP (Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project) program http://www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/splice.html predicted several additional splice sites within the intron 1
sequence. In particular, there is a predicted acceptor site
with a higher score than the actual acceptor splicing site
(0.99 compared to 0.98), located 65 bp downstream of
intron 1’s 5’ end, and is present in the 2R allele but not
in the 1R allele.
Earlier studies have shown that in S. aurata the
MSTN-2 gene is expressed almost exclusively in the
brain [24], although in juveniles Atlantic salmon MSTN2 transcripts were detected in other tissues as well (red
muscle, heart, intestine and ovary) when measured by
RT-PCR [26]. Expression of the MSTN-2 gene in tissues
other than brain was shown also in coho salmon [25],
zebrafish [27] and rainbow trout [22]. The question of
MSTN-2 functionality in brain or in other tissues is still
unclear. Several reports suggested the possible involvement of MSTN-2 in fish growth. Over-expression of
MSTN-2 in zebrafish [45] resulted in decreased dystrophin expression and muscle dystrophy. In another
report [46] GH administration to zebrafish had an effect
on MSTN-1 and MSTN-2 expression in white muscle.
Finally, transgenic coho salmon over-expressing GH
exhibited decreased levels of MSTN-2 expression in
white muscle [25]. A recent study [22] reported that in
rainbow trout, MSTN-2a mRNA is spliced into mature
RNA only in the brain; in the gills both spliced and
unspliced are found while in all other tissues tested
MSTN-2a exists only as unspliced transcript. Data from
our laboratory confirmed that also in S. aurata, MSTN2 exists in brain as both spliced and unspliced transcripts while in muscle only unspliced transcripts were
found (unpublished data). In one human case, a mutant
MSTN has been described with an IVS1+5 g®a transition at the splice donor site in intron 1, causing a splice
to occur 108 bp downstream at a cryptic splice site.
This mutation produces a larger transcript in the
mutant and results in a premature termination codon

Nadjar-Boger and Funkenstein BMC Genetics 2011, 12:22
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/22

and gross muscle hypertrophy in a child [17]. Interestingly, our sequencing data of genomic DNA from several individuals indicates that in contrast to the findings
in Atlantic salmon [26] and in rainbow trout [22], no
stop codons were found in saMSTN-2 gene, suggesting
that this phenomenon of pseudogenes of MSTN-2 might
be unique to salmonids and maybe related to whether
the different fish species are tetraploid or not.
Previous studies in our laboratory have shown an
extensive polymorphism of the GH gene in S. aurata
due to various numbers of tandem repeats (minisatellites) in the first and third introns and a polymorphic
microsatellite present in the promoter region [30,47].
Polymorphism of the first and third introns of the GH
gene was found also in other species of the family Sparidae [48], pointing to the conclusion that GH genes in
this family are highly polymorphic. Here we show that
another gene, MSTN-2, is also polymorphic in S. aurata
in both its first intron and promoter. The results of the
present study have potential applications in aquaculture.
The Mendelian inheritance implies that these two DNA
markers can be useful for parentage determination. In
particular, they can be useful for identifying the fish in
the broodstock that participate in reproduction in a species with group spawning like S. aurata [49]. However,
while the allele segregation showed a Mendelian inheritance, when genotypes were considered, a deviation
from Mendelian inheritance was found and significant
differences were found between the observed and
expected genotype frequencies both for the promoter
and for intron 1. These differences could be due to the
relative small number of individuals tested. Alternatively,
the discrepancy found between the expected and
observed genotype frequencies can be due to the fact
that these individuals were not sampled randomly but
sampling was rather biased towards body weight and the
largest and smallest of the progeny were chosen for analysis. This might indicate a link between fish size
(growth rate) and certain alleles of MSTN-2 promoter
or intron 1, making MSTN-2 a candidate gene for
genetic selection for desirable traits. Another possibility
for the differences seen between observed and expected
genotype frequencies in the progeny might be the fact
that the sire in Cross 1 is a carrier of the rare recessive
mutation “ebony” which is lethal in homozygotes, but
which is strongly heterotic for growth when fish are heterozygotes for this mutation [29].
Analysis of the five populations using the two polymorphic DNA loci showed no deviation from HardyWeinberg Equilibrium. The statistical analysis also
showed positive values of Fis for the population of
Ardag hatchery, indicating deficiency of heterozygotes
and inbreeding. This probably is the result of growth
selection for several generations. Therefore, the two

Page 16 of 19

DNA markers employed in the current study can also
be valuable in aquaculture industry to determine the
degree of inbreeding in the cultured population. In addition, the analysis demonstrated that all the other (nonArdag) populations studied are not different from each
other.
Although the current study focused on major events
of duplication, rearrangements and insertions of DNA
sequences that resulted in polymorphism of both
saMSTN-2 promoter and intron 1, the degree of polymorphism is probably much higher as a result of many
SNPs that were found in both the promoter and in the
gene. Presence of SNPs has the potential of being
applied to aquaculture in the future.
The development of genetic markers for marker-assisted
selection in domestic animals has had a great impact on
animal genetics and breeding. One of the candidate genes
for such an approach is MSTN due to its critical role in
muscle growth. SNPs in the MSTN gene were found to be
positively correlated in chicken with production traits
such as abdominal fat percentage, birth weight, breast
muscle percentage and breast muscle weight [50]. Despite
the large effects of MSTN mutations in different cattle
breeds (as discussed above), no mutations with major
effects have been described in pigs. Three point mutations
at the promoter, intron 1 and exon 3 were reported in the
porcine MSTN gene [51]. These authors also showed allele
frequency differences between Chinese and Western
breeds for at least two of these SNPs, but the differences
may reflect the different origins of these breeds rather
than any association with phenotypic traits. A different
study [52] scanned for SNPs in the promoter, exon 2 and
exon 3 of the MSTN gene in different Western pig breeds,
and the only polymorphic site found was the same change
at the exon 3 described earlier [53]. Statistical analysis did
not reveal any differences in loin or ham meatiness
between the pigs of the three genotypes. However, others
have shown two SNPs in the MSTN promoter of pigs that
were associated with growth and meat quality traits in two
commercial populations [54] and SNPs in the promoter of
the MSTN gene in Yorkshire pigs which showed an association with early growth traits [42]. In sheep, an association was founds between MSTN SNPs and growth and
carcass traits [55].
In contrast to the vast research on application of polymorphism of MSTN to phenotypic traits in domestic
animals, research into polymorphism of MSTN in fish is
relatively scarce. A polymorphic microsatellite has been
described in the 3’ UTR of MSTN cDNA of shi drum,
although no association with quantitative traits was
determined [56]. Multiple microsatellites have been
described in the promoter of the catfish MSTN gene:
three microsatellites in intron 1 and one in intron 2 and
in addition one microsatellite in the 3’ UTR [57]. In

Nadjar-Boger and Funkenstein BMC Genetics 2011, 12:22
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/22

addition, these authors described SNPs in various coding
and non-coding regions but no attempts were made to
study polymorphism of these microsatellites in the
population or correlate the SNPs with quantitative traits.
SNPs were also reported in a preliminary study in rainbow trout strains exhibiting distinct hyperplastic growth
traits [58].
Phylogenetic analysis of gnathostome GDF-11 and
MSTN sequences showed that tetrapods clustered separately from teleosts [59]. The teleost MSTN was separated into MSTN-1 and MSTN-2, consistent with the
idea that after two rounds of genome duplications in the
lineage leading to jawed vertebrates, the genome was
duplicated a third time in the lineage leading to teleost
fish [60,61]. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis and
sequence comparisons suggested that legitimate MSTN2 is present in the sea bream, shi drum, zebrafish, Fugu
and rainbow trout. In the latter, two forms of MSTN-2
were identified: MSTN-2a and MSTN-2b [22]. In this
context it should be noted that the previously identified
Tmyostatin1 and Tmyostatin2 in trout [62], were reclassified as MSTN-1a and MSTN-1b [20]. Clustal analysis of the trout gene showed that the 5’ and 3’ ends of
the two introns are almost identical in the two forms;
however, one of the two forms was longer by ~ 500 bp
as a result of several insertions [62]. A search in GenBank data base revealed two additional entries for
MSTN-2: a genomic sequence of barramundi Lates calacrifer MSTN-2 (Accession number GU590863) and a
genomic sequence for large yellow croaker Larimichthys
crocea MSTN-2 (Accession number EU571244). Clustal
comparison of the amino acid sequences of these two
new MSTN-2 forms with that of saMSTN-2 revealed
93-95% identity (342 out of 359 identical residues
between sea bream and croaker), confirming their identity as MSTN-2. Despite this high conservation in amino
acid sequence between these two species, the sequence
of the first intron of the croaker MSTN-2 gene is very
different from that of saMSTN-2.
Nevertheless, comparative analysis of MSTN-2 gene
organization revealed a conserved organization among
all nine fish species for which MSTN-2 was identified,
including conserved pre-mRNA splice sites. The amino
acids in the exon/intron junction of the second splice
site are identical among the fishes studied and similar in
their first splice site (Figure 8). The codon for proline or
histidine at the first splice site is divided between exon
1 and exon 2 in all fishes.

Conclusion
The gene and 5’ flanking region of saMSTN-2 gene
were cloned and characterized. Evidence was provided
of the polymorphism of both the promoter and the
first intron among individuals of various populations.

The two polymorphic loci are inherited in a Mendelian
way and can be used to confirm the life history of fish
in commercial farms. The results also suggest that this
region underwent chromosomal rearrangements like
duplication, insertions or deletions during the course
of evolution.
