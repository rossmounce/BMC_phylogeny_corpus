Gyrodactylus salinae n. sp. (Platyhelminthes:
Monogenea) infecting the south European
toothcarp Aphanius fasciatus (Valenciennes)
(Teleostei, Cyprinodontidae) from
a hypersaline environment in Italy
Giuseppe Paladini1*, Tine Huyse2 and Andrew P Shinn1

Abstract
Background: Historically, non-native species of Gambusia (Poeciliidae) have been used to control larval stages of
the Asian tiger mosquito, Stegomyia albopicta Reinert, Harbach et Kitching, 2004 throughout Italy. The potential
utility of indigenous populations of Aphanius fasciatus (Valenciennes) (Teleostei: Cyprinodontidae) as an appropriate
alternative biological control is currently being explored. A sub-sample of ten fish collected from Cervia Saline, Italy
(salinity 65 ppt; 30°C) to assess their reproductive capability in captivity, harboured a moderate infection of
Gyrodactylus von Nordmann, 1832 (Platyhelminthes, Monogenea). A subsequent morphological and molecular
study identified this as being a new species.
Results: Gyrodactylus salinae n. sp. is described from the skin, fins and gills of A. fasciatus. Light and scanning
electron microscopical (SEM) examination of the opisthaptoral armature and their comparison with all other
recorded species suggested morphological similarities to Gyrodactylus rugiensoides Huyse et Volckaert, 2002 from
Pomatoschistus minutus (Pallas). Features of the ventral bar, however, permit its discrimination from G. rugiensoides.
Sequencing of the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 and the 5.8S rRNA gene and a
comparison with all species listed in GenBank confirmed they are unique and represent a new species (most
similar to Gyrodactylus anguillae Ergens, 1960, 8.3% pair-wise distance based on 5.8S+ITS2). This represents the first
species of Gyrodactylus to be described from Aphanius and, to date, has the longest ITS1 (774 bp) sequenced from
any Gyrodactylus. Additional sampling of Cervia Saline throughout the year, found G. salinae n. sp. to persist in
conditions ranging from 35 ppt and 5°C in December to 65 ppt and 30°C in July, while in captivity a low level of
infection was present, even in freshwater conditions (0 ppt).
Conclusions: The ability of G. salinae n. sp. to tolerate a wide range of salinities and temperatures shows its
potential to readily adapt to several environmental conditions. These findings, together with the fact that A.
fasciatus is a protected species and is considered as a biological control organism, necessitate further studies on
the ecology and virulence of G. salinae n. sp.

Background
Toothcarp is a colloquial term used to describe
members of the order Cyprinodontiformes, which comprises ten fish families, namely Anablepidae, Aplocheilidae,
Cyprinodontidae, Fundulidae, Goodeidae, Nothobranchiidae, Poeciliidae, Profundulidae, Rivulidae and Valenciidae
[1]. Within the family Cyprinodontidae, the south European toothcarp Aphanius fasciatus (Valenciennes) is one
of the more commonly occurring neritic species within
the Mediterranean and is characteristically known to be
an eurythermic and euryhaline fish species, for its ability
to tolerate a wide range of temperatures (5-39°C) and
salinities (0-180 ppt), respectively [2]. Aphanius fasciatus
has a widespread distribution along the Italian coastline,
principally in brackish waters [3], although increasing
anthropogenic activity has caused a general decline in
numbers. For this reason, A. fasciatus is considered to be a
species that is “dying out” and as such, is listed under
Appendix III “Protected Fauna Species” after the Bern
Convention on the conservation of European wildlife and
natural habitats, and under Annex II of the Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats
and of wild fauna and flora in the European Community
[4]. It has recently been used as a biological control against
the larvae of the Asian tiger mosquito Stegomyia albopicta
(= Aedes albopictus) Reinert, Harbach et Kitching, 2004
which are vectors for a range of human infectious diseases,
including Chikungunya fever, dengue fever, West Nile
fever and yellow fever [5-7].
During a recent research study investigating the artificial reproduction of A. fasciatus in captivity as part of a
large scale restocking and mosquito control initiative in
Italy [8,9], several specimens collected, under licence, on
a number of occasions were found to harbour an infection of Gyrodactylus von Nordmann, 1832, principally
on the skin and fins and, to a lesser degree, on the gills.
Infected tissues were removed from the moribund fish
and subsequently sent to the Institute of Aquaculture,
University of Stirling (Scotland, UK) for identification.
Given the importance of A. fasciatus as a protected
species and its utility as an alternative indigeneous biological control agent to the introduced Gambusia spp.
(Poeciliidae), more information on its Gyrodactylus
fauna was needed.

consequence of reduced water availability and increased
algal growth. The skin, fins and gills of each fish were
subsequently screened for metazoan parasites using an
Olympus SZ40 stereomicroscope at ×4 magnification.
Specimens of Gyrodactylus were removed using
mounted triangular surgical needles. All ten fish were
infected but given the condition of the fish on collection, the intensity of infection can only be estimated at
between 10-30 parasites per fish.
The alcohol-fixed parasites were subsequently rinsed
in distilled water and representatives prepared as whole
mounts using ammonium picrate glycerine following the
procedure detailed by Malmberg [10]. Additional specimens had their opisthaptors removed using a scalpel,
which were then individually subjected to proteolytic
digestion on glass slides, as described in Paladini et al.
[11]. The largely tissue-free opisthaptoral hook preparations were then mounted in ammonium picrate glycerine using an 18 × 18 mm coverslip, the edges of which
were sealed with a commercial brand of nail varnish.
The corresponding body of each specimen of Gyrodactylus was fixed in 90% ethanol for subsequent molecular
characterisation.
For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), single specimens of Gyrodactylus were subjected to full proteolytic
digestion on 11 mm round glass coverslips to obtain
tissue-free attachment hooks. Each digestion took
approximately 60 min, with 3 μl of digestion solution
being added every 10 min, punctuated by the addition
of 5 μl distilled water for five times to remove digested
tissue residues and debris. For each step, the digested
hook preparations were placed in a Petri dish to protect
them from extraneous dust and placed in an incubator
at 55°C to help digestion, followed by a final incubation
at 40°C overnight to dry. The position of hooks on each
coverslip was subsequently marked using tiny, adhesive,
triangular labels positioned using forceps under an
Olympus BX51 compound microscope at ×10 magnification. The coverslips were then attached onto aluminium stubs with bi-adhesive round labels, sputter-coated
with gold using an Edwards S150B sputter coater and
then examined using a JEOL JSM5200 SEM operating at
an accelerating voltage of 10 kv.
Morphological analysis

Methods
Specimens collection and preparation

A total of ten adult A. fasciatus (total length 4-7 cm;
weight ~3 g) was collected during July 2008 from isolated pools in Cervia Saline, located in the Emilia
Romagna region in northern Italy, and fixed in 70%
ethanol. All ten specimens collected from the drying,
landlocked pools were moribund individuals, a

For the morphological study, images of the opisthaptoral
hard parts and the male copulatory organ (MCO) were
captured at magnifications of ×40 and ×100 oil immersion using MRGrab 1.0.0.4 (Carl Zeiss Vision GmbH,
2001) software and a Zeiss AxioCam MRc digital
camera mounted on an Olympus BX51 compound
microscope, using a ×0.75 interfacing lens. Drawings of
the taxonomic features were made from the captured

images. Each Gyrodactylus specimen was subjected to
morphometric analysis taking a total of 27 point-topoint measurements on the opisthaptoral hooks using a
JVC KY-F30B 3CCD video camera mounted on an
Olympus BH2 microscope using a ×2.5 interfacing lens
at ×100 oil immersion and the KS300 (ver.3.0) (Carl
Zeiss Vision GmbH, 1997) image analysis software,
combined with the specific macro for gyrodactylids,
Point-R (Bron & Shinn, University of Stirling). The
point-to-point hook measurements for the specimens
are given in micrometres as the mean ± 1 standard
deviation followed by the range in parentheses, and
follow those described in Shinn et al. [12], plus three
additional measurements of the dorsal bar (total length,
width and attachment point length).
The gyrodactylid material prepared from A. fasciatus
was compared to type material of Gyrodactylus rugiensoides Huyse et Volckaert, 2002 (paratypes acc. nos.
BMNH 2002.2.14.2-3), a species with morphologically
similar marginal hooks, held in the Parasitic Worms collection at The Natural History Museum, London, UK. In
addition, type material of the six Gyrodactylus species
known to parasitise cyprinodontid hosts, held in the
U.S. National Parasite Collection, Beltsville, Maryland,
USA, was examined, the marginal hooks re-drawn and
compared to the new specimens collected from
A. fasciatus. These are Gyrodactylus cyprinodontis
Mizelle et Kritsky, 1967 (holotype and paratype acc. no.
USNPC 62951), Gyrodactylus hargisi Williams et Rogers,
1971 (paratypes acc. no. USNPC 71760), Gyrodactylus
mobilensis Williams et Rogers, 1971 (paratypes acc. no.
USNPC 71762), Gyrodactylus nevadensis Mizelle et
Kritsky, 1967 (holotype and paratype acc. no. USNPC
62954), Gyrodactylus saratogensis Mizelle et Kritsky,
1967 (paratype acc. no. USNPC 62956) and Gyrodactylus tularosae Kritsky et Stockwell, 2005 (paratype acc.
no. USNPC 94780).

MgCl2 (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium), 200 μM of each
dNTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala,
Sweden), 1 μM of each primer (Eurogentec, Seraing,
Belgium), 2 μl lysate, 1 unit Taq polymerase (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) and milli-Q water. The mixtures
were heated for 4 min at 96°C and subjected to 35
cycles of 1 min at 95°C, 1 min at 50°C and 2 min at 72°
C, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. The
PCR products were visualised using ethidium bromide
on a 1.2% agarose gel. The products were then purified
by means of GFX columns according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,
Uppsala, Sweden). Both DNA strands were sequenced
using a Big Dye Chemistry Cycle Sequencing Kit (version 1.1) in a 3130 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
Belgium). The PCR primers and 2 internal primers,
ITS1R (5’-ATTT GCGTTCGAGAGACCG-3’) and
ITS2F (5’-TGGTGGATCA CTCGGCTCA-3’) [14], were
used for sequencing.
The obtained sequences were subjected to a BLAST
search (available at http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/BLAST/)
to identify similar sequences among other species of
Gyrodactylus in GenBank [15]. The sequences with the
highest similarity to our sequences were downloaded and
the 5.8S and ITS2 fragments were aligned in Clustal W
implemented in MEGA 4 [16]. Pair-wise genetic distances
were computed in MEGA 4 according to the evolutionary
model that was selected by jModelTest 0.1.1 [17]. The
sequences were also scanned for repeat elements using the
program Tandem Repeats Finder [18].

closely related to Gyrodactylus species belonging to the
G. (Paranephrotus) and G. (Neonephrotus) sub-genera
(sub-genera according to Malmberg [10]) based on the

Comments

Morphologically, the opisthaptoral hooks, notably the
marginal hook sickles, of G. salinae n. sp. are similar to
those of G. rugiensoides described from the sand goby
Pomatoschistus minutus (Pallas) collected from Texel,
The Netherlands [22] (Figure 2d-g). Given the potential
overlapping distribution of these two fish hosts within
the Mediterranean Sea [1], it is important to detail the
subtle features in hook morphology that permit their
discrimination from one another. Two paratypes of
G. rugiensoides were examined for morphological
comparison with G. salinae n. sp. The paratypes were
re-measured and the marginal hook sickle re-drawn and
overlaid with G. salinae n. sp. for a direct comparison
(Table 1; Figure 2e-g). There was a good agreement
between the measurements obtained in the current
study and those presented in Huyse & Volckaert [22].
The present study, however, provides an additional set
of measurements taken from the type material of
G. rugiensoides for direct comparison with the opisthaptoral features of G. salinae n. sp. Although the hamuli
roots in both species narrow after their union with the
shaft, giving the anterior edge of the dorsal bar attachment point a small but distinct edge, this appears to be
more prominent in G. rugiensoides than on the hamuli
of G. salinae n. sp. The ventral bar attachment points
also differ; those of G. rugiensoides appear flat and rectangular, while those of G. salinae n. sp. are indented.
The prominent ventral bar processes and the longer,
slender ventral bar membrane of G. salinae n. sp. contributes to the discrimination of the two species. The
similar morphology of the marginal hook sickles of both
species though, requires careful examination. The union
of the marginal hook shaft with the sickle divides the
width of the sickle base into 3:2 (heel:toe) in both
species, however, the sickle base is deeper in G. rugiensoides than in G. salinae n. sp. with a more angular, rectangular heel and a steeper faced, more robust toe

(Figure 2f-g). The sickle shaft and sickle tip of G. rugiensoides is broader, proportionately so, than that of
G. salinae n. sp. giving the latter the appearance of having a more open deeper sickle aperture. A comparison
of soft body features suggests that the posterior pharynx
bulb of G. rugiensoides (78.4 μm in diameter) is considerably larger than that of G. salinae n. sp. which
measures in 24.6 μm in diameter. Although Huyse &
Volckaert [22] described the MCO of G. rugiensoides as
armed with one principal spine and five small spines, a
closer examination of the paratypes shows that
G. rugiensoides possesses nine small spines, as that of
G. salinae n. sp. The MCOs of the two species are similar in length (G. salinae n. sp. 14.4 μm vs G. rugiensoides 14.8 μm) but that of G. rugiensoides is slightly
wider (12.7 vs 15.1).
A molecular comparison of G. rugiensoides and
G. salinae n. sp. showed that they were quite distinct.
The pair-wise distance amounted to 14% (based on the
5.8S + ITS2 fragment). The ITS1 sequences were more
difficult to align, due to length differences (up to 132
bp). Both species belong to the so-called marine rugiensis-group that also includes G. anguillae.
Additional sampling A. fasciatus from the Cervia
Saline at several time points throughout the year, found
that G. salinae n. sp. was present on their hosts in
waters ranging from 35 ppt and 5°C during December
to 65 ppt and 30°C during July in the wild, while under
captive conditions, fish even maintained a low level of
infection in freshwater (0 ppt) (pers. obs.).

Discussion
Gyrodactylus salinae n. sp. is the first species to be
formally described from Aphanius fasciatus and, also
the first from the genus Aphanius Nardo, 1827. Over
420 species of Gyrodactylus have been described [19,20]
and only six are known to parasitise cyprinodontids, all
of them are recorded from Cyprinodon spp. (see Table 3).
These are G. cyprinodontis, G. nevadensis and
G. saratogensis, all from Cyprinodon nevadensis nevadensis Eigenmann et Eigenmann; G. hargisi and G. mobilensis from Cyprinodon variegatus variegatus Lacepède, and
G. tularosae from Cyprinodon tularosa Miller et Echelle.
No supporting molecular data, however, is available for
any of these species. Morphologically, the marginal hook
sickles of the Gyrodactylus species described from cyprinodontid hosts are markedly different (Figure 3). The
marginal hook sickles of these species were re-drawn
from the paratypes and holotypes, where available, and a
comparison of their morphology with G. salinae n. sp. is
given in Figure 3. The marginal hook sickles of
G. cyprinodontis, G. nevadensis and G. saratogensis are
morphologically very similar to one another (see
Figure 3a, g, i). These three species were found on the

same host, Cyprinodon n. nevadensis, and they differ in
the size of their opisthaptor and its skeletal elements,
notably the hamulus total length (G. cyprinodontis = 49
μm; G. nevadensis = 33 μm; G. saratogensis = 26 μm)
which allows their ready discrimination from each other
[23]. The opisthaptoral hooks of the type material of
G. cyprinodontis and G. nevadensis were not completely
flat and therefore reconstructed drawings of the marginal
hook sickles of these two species were necessary and are
presented here and compared with G. salinae n. sp. The
marginal hook sickles of G. hargisi, G. mobilensis,
G. tularosae and G. salinae n. sp. differ markedly in
morphology from the other three species parasitising
cyprinodontid hosts. When the gyrodactylid fauna on
fish species belonging to the family Cyprinodontidae are
considered and compared, then there are a number of
species which possess similar marginal hook sickle
morphologies. This has also been noted among species

parasitising fish belonging to the pipefish family Syngnathidae, where the species Gyrodactylus eyipayipi
Vaughan, Christison, Hansen et Shinn, 2010, Gyrodactylus neretum Paladini, Cable, Fioravanti, Faria et Shinn,
2010, Gyrodactylus pisculentus Williams, Kritsky,
Dunnigan, Lash et Klein, 2008 and Gyrodactylus shorti
Holliman, 1963, all possess a similar marginal hook sickle
morphology [24]. The same is seen within species parasitising Poecilidae, whose gyrodactylids can be roughly
allocated, based on their marginal hook sickle morphology, to one of three groups. The first group encompasses
species with a large, approximately triangular sickle base
and reduced sickle tips i.e. Gyrodactylus bullatarudis
Turnbull, 1956, Gyrodactylus costaricensis Kritsky
et Fritts, 1970, Gyrodactylus jarocho Rubio-Godoy, Paladini, García-Vásquez et Shinn, 2010 and Gyrodactylus
poeciliae Harris et Cable, 2000. The second group of species which has large open faced sickles with a double

angled sickle shaft and narrow sickle base i.e. Gyrodactylus gambusiae Rogers et Wellborn, 1965, Gyrodactylus
milleri Harris et Cable, 2000 and Gyrodactylus turnbulli
Harris, 1986. While the third group includes Gyrodactylus rasini Lucký, 1973 and Gyrodactylus xalapensis
Rubio-Godoy, Paladini, García-Vásquez et Shinn, 2010
whose marginal hook sickles have rounded heels and
approximately equal sized sickle shaft and point regions
[25].
A list of all the species of Gyrodactylus recorded from
cyprinodontids and other fish hosts belonging to the
order Cyprinodontiformes is presented in Table 3. In
addition to these, there are a number of other “Gyrodactylus“ species parasitising cyprinodontiform hosts that
appear in the literature. These include Gyrodactylus foxi
Rawson, 1973, Gyrodactylus megacanthus Wellborn et
Rogers, 1967, Gyrodactylus prolongis Hargis, 1955, Gyrodactylus stableri Hathaway et Herlevich, 1973 and Gyrodactylus trematoclithrus Rogers, 1967, all of which were
subsequently transferred to the genus Fundulotrema
Kritsky et Thatcher, 1977 based on the presence of an
additional peduncular bar [26].
The fact that the current species is (both morphologically and molecularly) more closely related to Gyrodactylus species parasitising marine gobies and eels than to
those infecting cyprinodontids, might suggest that the
ecology of the host, rather than host phylogeny plays an
important role in this host-parasite system. Malmberg
[10] found G. anguillae only on migrating elvers, which
are relatively small and abundantly found in estuaries, as
is the common goby Pomatoschistus microps (Krøyer),
host to G. micropsi. There are other examples of ecological radiations onto distant-related hosts in Gyrodactylus, e.g. the G. wageneri-group primarily infects
cyprinids but they are also found on sticklebacks, percids and cottids [27].
There is nothing known yet on the effect of G. salinae
n. sp. on its host, but its closest relative so far, G. anguillae, has been reported as a pest in the culture of anguillid eels [28,29].
Based on the nuclear ITS fragment, the genus Gyrodactylus can be divided in two groups, one with a ‘short’
(347-473 bp) and one with a ‘long’ (535-688 bp) ITS1
fragment [30,31]. These ranges have recently been
extended both to the lower end, with Gyrodactylus
cichlidarum Paperna, 1968 having the shortest ITS1
sequence determined thus far (343 bp; acc. no.
DQ124228), and G. salinae n. sp. having the longest
ITS1 fragment (774 bp). The sequence of G. salinae n.
sp. is also unique as the 5.8S gene is 158 bp long,
whereas all other Gyrodactylus species so far had an
invariant length of 157 bp. The new species clusters in
the marine rugiensis-group which is part of the monophyletic ‘long ITS’ group, and appears most closely

Page 10 of 12

related to G. anguillae. Despite the morphological
resemblance between G. salinae n. sp. and G. rugiensoides, they are genetically quite different (especially in
the ITS1 fragment). This underlines again the fact that
morphological and molecular evolution is not always
correlated. The close affinity with G. anguillae and
Gyrodactylus cf. micropsi Huyse, Audenaert et Volckaert, 2003 as based on the genetic distances does not
necessarily equal sister species relationships. The true
sister species of G. salinae n. sp. has probably not been
sequenced yet since the difference between Gyrodactylus
species from closely related goby species was for example much smaller (2-5%) [32] than the distance between
G. anguillae and G. salinae n. sp.

Conclusions
Although the specimens of A. fasciatus from Cervia Saline were moribund at the time of collection, this was
not a consequence of the moderate G. salinae n. sp.
infection but of the pool conditions (30°C, 65 ppt) from
which they were collected which had a water depth of
less than 15 cm and a heavy growth of algae. Given the
ability of G. salinae n. sp. to tolerate a wide range of
salinities and temperatures, it would appear that this
species has the potential to readily adapt to the full
spectrum of environmental conditions. What is
unknown, however, is the potential of this species to
survive on other neritic fish hosts when cohabiting isolated pools or interacting with other fish species in
open, full strength seawater (i.e. 35 ppt). The potential
utility of Aphanius fasciatus as a biological control
against the larvae of the Asian tiger mosquito Stegomyia
albopicta, in addition to the finding of a new parasite
species, raises concerns regarding the health status of
this host due to the parasitic infection. Further studies
are required in order to define the potential role of G.
salinae n. sp. as a pathogen, and the consequences that
this finding might have on the use of indigenous populations of A. fasciatus as an alternative biological control
to the use of various Gambusia species. The ecological
risks of introducing Gambusia spp. to non-native environments has been stressed by many authors [33-35].
Cross breeding with indigenous species may lead to the
extinction of the latter given that certain species have
been shown to hybridise [36-38]. There are also the
attendant risks of disease introduction linked with the
movement of fish into new habitats [39]. The use of
native fish, rather than introduced species, as biological
controls, therefore, is highly recommended to avoid
these potential ecological impacts.
