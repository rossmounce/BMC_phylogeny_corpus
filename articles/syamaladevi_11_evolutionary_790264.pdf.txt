Evolutionary traces decode molecular mechanism
behind fast pace of myosin XI
Divya P Syamaladevi1,2 and R Sowdhamini1*

Abstract
Background: Cytoplasmic class XI myosins are the fastest processive motors known. This class functions in highvelocity cytoplasmic streaming in various plant cells from algae to angiosperms. The velocities at which they
process are ten times faster than its closest class V homologues.
Results: To provide sequence determinants and structural rationale for the molecular mechanism of this fast pace
myosin, we have compared the sequences from myosin class V and XI through Evolutionary Trace (ET) analysis. The
current study identifies class-specific residues of myosin XI spread over the actin binding site, ATP binding site and
light chain binding neck region. Sequences for ET analysis were accumulated from six plant genomes, using
literature based text search and sequence searches, followed by triple validation viz. CDD search, string-based
searches and phylogenetic clustering. We have identified nine myosin XI genes in sorghum and seven in grape by
sequence searches. Both the plants possess one gene product each belonging to myosin type VIII as well. During
this process, we have re-defined the gene boundaries for three sorghum myosin XI genes using fgenesh program.
Conclusion: Molecular modelling and subsequent analysis of putative interactions involving these class-specific
residues suggest a structural basis for the molecular mechanism behind high velocity of plant myosin XI. We
propose a model of a more flexible switch I region that contributes to faster ADP release leading to high velocity
movement of the algal myosin XI.

Background
Myosin is an actin based motor protein that generates
motion using chemical energy released through ATP
hydrolysis. Myosins play many important roles within
plant cells such as organelle trafficking [1,2], remodelling
[3,4], and inheritance [5]. They are also known to be
involved in development of various plant parts like root
hairs, pollen etc [6,7]. Though there are around 24 classes
of myosins reported in eukaryota [8], only three classes class VIII, XI and XIII are seen in plants. The similarity
of plant myosin sequences with animal and fungal class
V myosins [9], derived from phylogenetic analysis, suggests a common ancestor from which plants and
Opisthokonts [10] might have evolved.
Myosins, in general, function through an ATP hydrolysis cycle by converting the hydrolysis energy to allosteric
conformational changes within the motor head as well as

the neck region leading to motion. Swinging cross-bridge
hypothesis, proposed by H. E. Huxley, has been the most
popular model to explain the molecular mechanism of
energy transduction in myosins. Numerous biochemical
and biophysical experiments thereafter helped to improve
it to the present day swinging lever arm model [11],
according to which, immediately after the release of ADP
from the previous cycle, ATP binds to myosin head that
is in an actin-bound post-stroke conformation. Upon
hydrolysis of ATP, myosin head gets transformed to prestroke conformation which is actually actin unbound
form. Upon rebinding to the next actin molecule, Pi is
released first and the ADP bound myosin head changes
conformation from weak to strong actin binding state.
This will be followed by ADP release and conformational
changes at the head domain back to post-stroke state
where myosin strongly interacts with actin.
In plants, from algae to angiosperms, the high velocity
cytoplasmic streaming (of the range 40-60 μm/s) is driven by myosins [12]. Myosin XI, found in plants, is the
fastest known motor and it moves processively along

actin filaments towards the plus-end, performing cellular
functions like cytoplasmic streaming and vesicle transport [1,2]. Myosin XI is architecturally similar to class V
myosin in animals, with a motor head followed by six IQ
motifs, a coiled-coil and a globular cargo-binding domain
called DIL [10]. Myosin XI, just like myosin V, functions
as a dimer formed through coiled-coil interaction
between the a-helical tail regions of the monomers. Both
the classes have comparable step size (an average of
35nm) and same directionality towards the plus end of
actin filament.
Due to the difficulties in crystallization of actin-myosin
complex, the actual actin binding residues are not known
even in well-characterized myosins like myosin II and V.
However, docking studies have revealed the actomyosin
interface residues (see ref. [13] for a review). Actomyosin
interface is extensive in the rigour state because of the
interaction of a single head with regions on two adjacent
actin molecules. Rigour state contact between actin and
myosin head can be divided into four regions: a large primary binding site on the face of actin, which on three
sides, is flanked by three additional sites from surface
loops [14]. In this study, using the Evolutionary Trace
method, we have identified crucial residues at the actin
binding site, at the ATP binding domain and at the beginning of neck region that could contribute to the fast
release of ADP and the high velocity. During the process
of accumulation of myosin XI sequences from plants, we
have recognised nine Myosin XI sequences from sorghum
and seven from grape through genome-wide survey and
gene prediction.
Algal myosin XI, isolated from Chara corallina [15],
slides F-actin in vitro at a speed equivalent to cytoplasmic
streaming speed of 40- 60 μm/s, which is 10 times the
speed generated by myosin V [16,17]. Studies with tobacco
myosin XI heavy isoform, by Tominaga and coworkers,
revealed that single myosin XI molecules move at velocity
7 μm/s along the actin and generate relatively smaller
force, in the order of 0.5 pN [8] much smaller than the
force generated by muscle myosin II [18] and by myosin V
[19-21]. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of this
fast movement of Chara myosin, Ito and co-workers measured its kinetic properties [22]. The rate constant of ADP
dissociation from actin-motor domain complex of Chara
myosin XI was estimated to be more than 2800 s-1 and the
rate constant of ATP-induced dissociation of motor
domain from the actin was 2200 s-1 at a physiological concentration of ATP. The estimated time spent on actin, in
strongly bound state, was estimated to be <0.82ms. This
value is the shortest among known values for various myosins and it has a duty ratio of <0.3 and a Vmax of actin-activated ATPase activity of 390 s-1 [22]. ADP release, which
is the rate limiting step in all other myosin types, is dramatically accelerated in this plant myosin. Most of the

Page 2 of 11

myosins possess positively charged residues on loop 2
where as Chara myosin has no net positive charge on
loop2. Instead, positively charged residues are harboured
on loop 3. Ito and coworkers investigated the effect of
positively charged residues on the loops at the actin binding region and provided evidence for its partial role on the
high velocity movement through mutation studies [23].
Still, the sequence signatures that lead to the specialization
of these myosins as the fastest motors and the actual
molecular mechanism of such a rapid process are not
known completely. In this study, based on sequence analysis and molecular modelling, we propose that the sequence
signatures at the switch I region, the ATP-binding site and
the neck region as partly responsible for the observed high
rate of ADP release, which in turn lead to the specialization of these myosins as the fastest ones.

Methods
Sequence search and validation

A database of 143 myosin sequences belonging to 19 different classes was developed through text search in NCBI
and by consulting a database of myosins - The myosin
home page (http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/myosin/myosin.html). The members of this database were used as
queries in PSI-BLAST against sorghum and grape
genomes. A relatively relaxed E-value cut-off of 10-5 and a
query length coverage filter of 25% were used in PSIBLAST in order to retrieve even distantly related myosins.
Hits were filtered for myosins through a three-fold validation procedure. In the first level, string-based scripts were
used to gather completely or partly annotated myosin hits
(Category 1) from respective GENEPEPT flat files. Misannotated or unannotated hits (Category 2) were gathered
by using perl scripts based on the percentage identity of
the hit with the query sequence. An identity cut-off of
35% was used here. The two categories of myosin hits
obtained from sorghum and grape were checked for their
domain architecture using PFAM [24], CDD [25], SMART
[26] and COILS2 [27] servers. The consensus domain
architecture, after consulting the domain repositories,
was obtained for each of the validated hits. This forms the
second level of filtering where false positive hits that deviate from the general domain architecture of myosins
are eliminated. Such myosins were next subjected to gene
prediction using fgenesh program [28]. Wherever the
NCBI annotations were partial, full-length genes were
obtained through fgenesh program and the gene boundaries are re-defined. The final sequence set obtained after
these filters were annotated based on the co-clustering of
motor domain (on the basis of sequence similarities) with
representative sequences from 19 known myosin classes
using neighbour-joining method of clustering in Phylip
package [29]. This representative sequence dataset,
obtained from 19 classes of myosins, were also seeded

Syamaladevi and Sowdhamini BMC Structural Biology 2011, 11:35

with representative sequences from three non-myosins kinesin, ATPase and helicases - as outgroups to ensure the
phylogenetic relationship of putative myosins with known
myosins. This method of genome scan and validation is
pictorially represented in a flowchart [Figure 1].
Evolutionary Trace (ET) analysis

Class-specific residues were identified using ET method
for myosin V and XI members. Multiple sequence alignment for 30 sequences from 10 genomes was done using
CLUSTALW [30]. ET analysis was initially guided by
Trace Suite II [31]. Sequences were divided into three
parts based on domain architecture: 1) N-terminal SH3like domain 2) motor domain and 3) light chain binding
neck region. Class-specific residues for the motor domain
and light chain binding neck domains were mapped on to
myosin V crystal structure (PDB ID: 2DFS) and clustering
of conserved residues were analysed.
Molecular modelling of algal myosin XI

Homology model of the algal myosin XI (Chara corallina) was obtained using MODELLER [32]. Myosin V
from chicken (PDB code: 1W7J) was used as a template
[33]. Sequence identity between algal and chicken myosin

Page 3 of 11

head domains was 41%. Further, the predicted secondary
structures of algal myosin head were comparable with
the secondary structures identified in the template
(chicken myosin head), except for fine-tuned boundaries.
The best energy model from a set of 20 models, generated by MODELLER, was passed through various validation processes viz. WHATIF [34] and VERIFY-3D [35].
The model was energy minimized to relieve any inherent
strain in the model and to obtain the most favourable
conformation including side chains. The energy minimized structures were used to visualize the class-specific
residues using PYMOL [36].

Results and discussion
Sequence search and validation identify putative myosins
in soghum and grape

Proteomes of a monocot and a dicot (Sorghum bicolor and
Vitis vinifera ) were scanned for myosin types using PSIBLAST preceding a three-fold validation as mentioned in
Methods. Additional myosin class V and XI sequences
were obtained from three different plant genomes: Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Zea mays. Motor
domains of validated hits, including those with new predicted boundaries (Table 1) were subjected to clustering

(Figure 2) so as to annotate their subfamily types and classified them as belonging to myosin VIII or XI subfamily.
Sorghum genome harbours 10 myosin genes distributed in
seven chromosomes, whereas grape genome contains only
eight myosins out of which seven are myosin XI isoforms
(Figure 2) spread over eight chromosomes (Table 1).
Sorghum has one type VIII and nine type XI myosin
genes. For three of the predicted myosin XI in sorghum,
we have re-defined the gene boundaries using fgenesh
gene prediction program. We assigned new boundaries to
XP_002458397 in Chromosome 3 and merged two partial
genes (XP_002440148 & XP_002440149) into a single
gene with complete domain architecture of type XI
myosin.

Both sorghum and grape genomes contain only one
copy of myosin VIII type in chromosome 1 and 19,
respectively (Table 1).
The domain architecture predicted for these new myosins from sorghum and grape are shown in Figures 3 and
Figure 4, respectively. All the myosin XI gene products
from sorghum and grape followed the common domain
architecture of motor head-coiled coil-DIL except one,
namely VvMXI7 (Table 1). Myosin VIII from both the
genomes had the two-domain architecture of motor head
followed by coiled coil. Myosin VIII sequences do not
possess features of a compact domain at the N-terminal
region before the head domain, where as many of the
myosin XI types have an N-terminal SH3-like domain

a high sequence identity (above 40%). There is a high
level of sequence conservation between the two classes
at the active site residues. Nevertheless, the two classes
differ considerably at functionally important sites and
mechanistic details, according to the literature (as mentioned in Introduction). Myosin XI head contains 21
class-specific residues, out of which six appear on the
actin binding sites. Known actin binding sites on myosin
II fall into three regions: A primary binding site comprising of a helix-loop-helix and an adjacent helix, a secondary site which is a charged loop and a tertiary site
lying at the front or nose of the myosin molecule [13].
The corresponding regions on myosin V are marked on
the 2DFS structure in red color (Figure 5). All the three
sites contain class-specific residues. This implicates the
possible involvement of these residues in imparting the

differential actin-binding strength of the two types of
myosins.
It was recently shown that the ATP-induced motor head
dissociation in myosin XI occurs at a very fast rate of
2200s-1, resulting in stunningly fast movement of myosin
XI [22]. In our analysis, we identified two myosin XI-specific residues in the primary binding site (helix-loop-helix)
that corresponds to K502 and K514 of chicken myosin V.
In myosin XI, K502 and K514 are mutated in a class-specific manner to proline and methionine, respectively. This
may introduce a structural kink and local rigidity to the
loop and disrupt the charged interaction of the primary
binding site to actin. This can help the myosin XI motor
head to get unbound sooner from the actin upon ATP
binding after the release of Pi and ADP in the previous
ATP-hydrolysis cycle.

Apart from the three key actin binding sites, surrounding residues may also get involved in actin binding. Few
of the class-specific residues observed near the actin
binding site may also contribute to binding strength (yellow spheres at the actin binding -region in Figure 5). The
second actin binding site on myosin XI also harbours a
class-specific residue: Lysine, but the mutation R542K
seems to be too subtle to introduce a difference in the
interaction with actin.
Putative involvement of two myosin XI specific residues
in switch I flexibility

The switch I region, which drives an open-close conformational change in the myosin head during ATP hydrolysis
[38], has two class-specific residues (shown in green in
Figure 5). One of these is Asn 214 (algal myosin XI numbering), corresponding to Asp215 of myosin V. In myosin
V, Asp215 has a favourable charged interaction with
Lys668, whereas in myosin XI, due to changes of Asp215
to Asn214 and Lys688 to Leu640, this stabilizing interaction is likely abolished which could lead to a more flexible
switch I region. These class-specific residues are mapped
on the three-dimensional model of algal myosin head
(Figure 6A). Since the movement at the switch I region
is intimately associated with g-phosphate binding,

coordination of Mg 2+ and there by ADP binding and
release, we propose a more flexible switch I region in myosin XI that might facilitate an early or easy release of ADP.
In Myosin V, Thr 212 is located close to a Glutamate
triad (Glu254, Glu255 and Glu256) and it stabilizes the
switch I through a favourable interaction with Glu256. In
plant myosin XI, there is an interesting co-evolution at
this location, where a spatially proximate Thr212 is
replaced by Val and Glu255 by Pro (Figure 6A & 6B). As a
result of this, stabilizing polar interaction of Thr212 with
Glu255 observed in myosin type V appears obsolete in
myosin XI. A new possible interaction between Valine and
Proline seems to be stabilizing the switch I region of myosin XI (Figure 6A, 6B).
Shutter residues might make the ATP binding cavity
closure inefficient in Chara coralina

A closer investigation of the ATP binding site (Figure 6C
& 6D) of the myosin V crystal structure, reveal two mutations in plant myosins that would probably decide the
opening and closing of the small cleft at the ATP binding
site. Asp297 is located in an upper loop at the face of the
cleft and has a potential polar interaction partner Gln115
located in a lower loop of myosin V. In Figure 6A, this
interaction is highlighted through a dotted line in the

near-rigour-open conformation, as seen in the crystal
structure of myosin V. This interaction can form a vertical shutter for the ATP binding cavity. These ‘shutter’
residues are Ala296 and Arg111 in myosin XI from
Chara coralina, which are stabilised by weak dispersion
forces, and hence the closure of the cleft may become
inefficient in Chara myosin.

Weakened interaction between the neck and the
converter domain affects lever arm tilting

We have also examined the neck region (also termed as
‘lever arm’) for class-specific residues and the conservation of amino acid types. We identified a cluster of
three class-specific residues, two of which (Ile762 and
Lys766, chicken myosin V numbering) have potential

interactions with the converter domain in the case of
myosin V (coloured yellow in Figure 5, Additional
files 1 and 2).
(a) Ile762 (in chicken myosin V, please see Additional
file 2) at the beginning of the neck region, is embedded
between two hydrophobic residues - a highly conserved
Leu714 and a conserved hydrophobic residue at position
735 - of the converter domain forming a “hydrophobic
triad”. The corresponding residue of Ile762 in plant myosin XI neck region is a charged arginine that possibly
weaken the hydrophobic interaction of the N-terminal
neck with the converter domain.
(b) Spatially close to this “hydrophobic triad” in myosin
V (please see Additional files), the side chain of Lys766,
the second class specific residue, interacts with the backbone oxygen of Val713 located at the converter domain
by forming a hydrogen bond. In plant myosin XI, Lys766
is replaced by a Valine in a class specific manner. As a
result of this change, a weak hydrophobic interaction

alone could prevail between the neck and the converter
domains of myosin XI (Additional file 1). Such amino
acid differences could provide higher conformational
flexibility to plant myosins in tilting the lever arm (neck
region) with ease, which in turn is associated with a faster
ADP release and actin dissociation. The third class-specific residue (not shown in Additional file 1) is likely to
interact with SH3 domain.

Conclusion
For a processive myosin to move at high speed on the
actin filament, the best way is to strike an optimal duty
ratio so that the dwell time is just sufficient to locate the
next binding site on actin. ADP release is the rate limiting step of ATP hydrolysis cycle and the associated
movement of myosin along the actin filament. One of the
possible ways to attain speed is to hasten the ADP release
process. We propose that altered sequence conservation
patterns could redefine structural interactions and impart

Syamaladevi and Sowdhamini BMC Structural Biology 2011, 11:35
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/11/35

differences in speed. A poorly closed ATP binding cavity,
together with a more flexible switch I region, is compelling to think of a model for faster release of ADP in plant
myosins. From our sequence analysis, the switch I region
bears unique sequence signatures in the fast-acting myosin. As shown in Figure 7, this region may be pulled away
from the ADP binding site resulting in the loss of coordination of Mg2+, which in turn would make the ADP
release easier. As the gating loops of the ATP binding
cavity in Myosin XI are not directly interacting, due to
class-specific amino acid differences, the closing of the
cavity may be for a very short period and this may facilitate the release of ADP smoothly without any further
delay.
From this comparative sequence analysis, we could
recognise most crucial residue changes that may be
responsible for decreased/altered affinity of myosin XI
to the actin and rapid ADP release in comparison with
myosin V. A molecular mechanism of fast movement of
myosin XI could be proposed: As long as ADP is bound
to the myosin head, actin binding is stabilized through
numerous weak interactions. Due to the enhanced flexibility of the switch I region, ADP gets released very fast
after hydrolysis. Release of ADP permits the next ATP

to bind and subsequently dissociate the acto-myosin
complex through suitable conformational changes at the
actin-myosin interface, which would further be
enhanced due to the absence of few stabilizing charged
interactions. Meanwhile, since the neck region in myosin XI interacts only poorly with the converter domain,
the neck flexibility is also high which might assist in faster catalysis and binding events at the head domain.

Additional material
Additional file 1: The class-specific residues of myosin XI are
mapped over the neck region of myosin V crystal structure.
Additional file 2: Class-specific residues (I762K and K766V) at the
neck region are shown on the multiple sequence alignment.
