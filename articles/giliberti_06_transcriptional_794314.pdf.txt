Abstract
Background: RecA is a highly conserved prokaryotic protein that not only plays several important
roles connected to DNA metabolism but also affects the cell response to various stress conditions.
While RecA is highly conserved, the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of its structural gene
is less conserved. In Escherichia coli the LexA protein acts as a recA repressor and is able, in response
to DNA damage, of RecA-promoted self-cleavage, thus allowing recA transcription. The LexA
paradigm, although confirmed in a wide number of cases, is not universally valid. In some cases LexA
does not control recA transcription while in other RecA-containing bacteria a LexA homologue is
not present.
Results: We have studied the recA transcriptional regulation in S. thermophilus, a bacterium that
does not contain a LexA homologue. We have characterized the promoter region of the gene and
observed that its expression is strongly induced by DNA damage. The analysis of deletion mutants
and of translational gene fusions showed that a DNA region of 83 base pairs, containg the recA
promoter and the transcriptional start site, is sufficient to ensure normal expression of the gene.
Unlike LexA of E. coli, the factor controlling recA expression in S. thermophilus acts in a RecAindependent way since recA induction was observed in a strain carrying a recA null mutation.
Conclusion: In S. thermophilus, as in many other bacteria,recA expression is strongly induced by
DNA damage, however, in this organism expression of the gene is controlled by a factor different
from those well characterized in other bacteria. A small DNA region extending from 62 base pairs
upstream of the recA transcriptional start site to 21 base pairs downstream of it carries all the
information needed for normal regulation of the S. thermophilus recA gene.

Background
The bacterial RecA protein has an important role in a variety of cellular processes, such as the control of DNA status,
repair of stalled replication forks, double-strand break

repair, general recombination, induction of the SOS
response and induction of temperate phages [1]. RecA has
also been recently shown to possess other roles related to
DNA metabolism, such as the apparent motor function in

which DNA strand exchange is coupled to ATP hydrolysis
[2]. In addition, roles of RecA in degradation of pectin in
Erwinia carotovora [3], expression of adherence factors in
Vibrio cholerae [4], pilus phase transition in Neisseria gonorrhoeae [5] and switching from pathogenic smooth to
non-pathogenic rough cell form in Pseudomonas tolaasii
[6], have been proposed and explained as secondary
effects of RecA action on DNA structure and function.
However, RecA has been also associated to phenomena
apparently not related to DNA metabolism, such as the
adaptation of Lactococcus lactis to oxygen and heat shock
[7,8] and of Bacillus subtilis to nutrient starvation [9]. Also
in the moderately thermophilic lactic acid bacterium
Streptococcus thermophilus recA expression is involved in
the stress response mechanism [10]. S. thermophilus is a
commercially important bacteria since it is used, along
with Lactobacillus spp., as a starter culture for the manufacture of several fermented dairy foods. Its industrial use has
substantially increased during the past two decades, as a
result of the strong increase in consumption of dairy products. Such increase has led, as a consequence, to new
demands on S. thermophilus performances, as stabile fermentation properties, consistent flavor and texture characteristics, resistance to bacteriophage infections.
Research during the past two decades on the physiology of
S. thermophilus has revealed important information on
some of these properties, and more recently genome data
have become publicly available [11]. Analysis of the S.
thermophilus genome revealed a small size (1.8 Mb, probably the smallest genome of all lactic acid bacteria), a low
G+C ratio (40%) and a phylogenetical relationship to
mesophilic lactococci [12]. A recA insertional mutant of S.
thermophilus, in addition to typical recA phenotypes
(reduced growth rate and sensitivity to mitomycin Cinduced DNA damages) also showed a strong reduction of
viability and the appearance of a sub-population of morphologically altered cells in response to both heat shock
and nutrient starvation [10]. These effects were independent from ClpL and GroEL homologues that were normally
induced in the recA null mutant [10].
The transcriptional regulation of the recA gene has been
studied in a variety of different bacteria. In E. coli, as well
as in several other organisms, under physiological conditions recA transcription is repressed by the LexA protein
that binds to its consensus binding site located in the promoter region of recA [13,14]. Upon DNA damage, RecA
binds to single-stranded DNA regions generated by replication blocks, originating a nucleoprotein filament
(RecA*) [15]. Activated RecA* possesses co-protease activity [15], required for self-cleavage of LexA [16]. The
RecA*-promoted self-cleavage of LexA results in the inactivation of the repressor and thus in the induction of the
SOS regulon including the recA gene [16]. In vitro experi-

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/5/1/29

ments have shown that in the absence of RecA*, LexA is
cleaved at high pH demonstrating that the protein is able
to perform self-cleavage [17].
In the gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis, a
LexA homologue is present and the recA gene is regulated
with a mechanism similar to that studied in E. coli. The E.
coli LexA and its B. subtilis homologue share a 52% similarity that becomes lower in the helix-turn-helix domain.
As a consequence, the two proteins recognize different
DNA target sites (5'-CTGTN8ACAG-3' for E. coli and 5'CGAACN4GTTCG-3' for B. subtilis) [18].
In other bacteria different mechanisms of transcriptional
regulation for the recA gene have been proposed. Myxococcus xanthus and Deinococcus radiodurans, although not similar to each other, both contain RecA and LexA
homologues and control recA transcription with mechanisms that differ from the E. coli paradigm [19,20].
In L. lactis while a highly conserved RecA homologue is
present [7] a LexA homologue has not been found. In this
organism a different protein, HdiR, not homologous to
LexA, has been shown to regulate several genes of the SOS
system but not recA [8]. These evidence therefore suggest
that while the RecA is highly conserved in prokaryotes, the
mechanism of transcriptional regulation of its structural
gene is less conserved.
We analyze here the expression of the recA gene of S. thermophilus and report evidence that recA expression and
DNA damage-induction are exerted in a RecA-independent fashion through a factor not homologous to those
well characterized in other bacteria.

Results and discussion
Mapping of the 5' terminus of the recA gene
Primer extension experiments were carried out to map the
5' terminus of recA mRNA. Two radioactively labelled synthetic primers, designated A3 and A4 (Methods) and
annealing the proximal part of recA mRNA (Fig. 1A), were
used to hybridize S. thermophilus total RNA. Since it had
been previously reported [3,21,22] that in several bacteria
recA is expressed at a very low basal level and is transcriptionally induced by mitomycin C, we used total RNA from
exponentially growing cells of S. thermophilus before and
after exposure to sublethal concentration (20 ng/ml) of
mitomycin C [10]. Reverse transcriptase was then used to
generate cDNA primer extension products, which were
separated by 6% polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis
together with dideoxy sequencing ladders generated by
using A3 and A4 primers and cloned recA DNA as a template. The results obtained with the A3 primer (Fig. 1B)
were in agreement with the results obtained with the A4
primer (data not shown). The extension product obtained

results were obtained with oligonucleotide A4 (data not shown).

allowed us to localize the 5' terminus of recA mRNA 132
bp upstream of the beginning of the ORF. The extension
product was found only when recA expression was
induced with mitomycin C, suggesting that in S. thermophilus recA expression is strictly regulated. Sequences
upstream of the 5' terminus (+1) resembled the conserved
features of a typical promoter of an E. coli housekeeping
gene, matching in three of six positions the consensus -10
and in four of six positions the consensus -35 (Fig. 1A).

tion, thus indicating that both conditions do not affect
recA expression (Fig. 2).

recA expression is induced by mitomycin C but not by heat
shock or nutrient starvation
To analyze the expression of the recA gene we constructed
a recA::gusA translational fusion. A 609 bp DNA fragment
containing the recA promoter region and codons for 18 Nterminal amino acid residues of the recA ORF was amplified from S. thermophilus chromosomal DNA by using oligonucleotides P1 and P5 as primers (Methods). The PCR
product was then fused in frame to the gusA gene of E. coli
carried by plasmid pGU0, previously obtained by inserting the gusA coding region in the EcoRI site of the commercial plasmid pGemT-easy (Promega). The recombinant
plasmid obtained, pGU1, was then used as a template for
DNA sequencing reactions performed to verify that the
recA and gusA genes were fused in frame (not shown).

Activation of recA expression is not RecA-dependent
A computer-assisted analysis of the recently released S.
thermophilus genome [11] failed to reveal homologues of
the E. coli or Bacillus subtilis LexA proteins (not shown).
This analysis, however, identified in the S. thermophilus
genome a homologue (YP_139374) of the HdiR protein
that in L. lactis acts as transcriptional regulator of various
SOS genes [8]. Although HdiR does not control the
expression of recA in L. lactis [8], we searched for the HdiR
putative consensus sequence (5'-tttATCAGtTtttCTGATaaa-3') [8] in the recA promoter region of S. thermophilus.
Since no sequences matching the putative consensus for
HdiR binding were found and since HdiR is not involved
in recA regulation in the phylogenetically related L. lactis,
it is likely that the protein controlling recA expression in
S. thermophilus is not the HdiR homologue, YP_139374.
Additional support for this conclusion comes also from
the observation that HdiR acts in L. lactis in a RecAdependent way [8] while the S. thermophilus factor is RecAindependent (see below).

The gene fusion was then transferred into the E. coli – S.
thermophilus shuttle vector pNZ124, yielding plasmid
pNG1 that was used to transform competent cells of the S.
thermophilus strain Sfi39. The recombinant strain, S1, was
grown at 42°C anaerobically in the presence and in the
absence of a sublethal concentration (200 ng/ml) of mitomycin C [10] and exponentially growing cells collected by
centrifugation and assayed for β-glucuronidase activity
(Methods). Although the conditions of mitomycin induction differed substantially between the primer extension
of Fig. 1B (20 ng/ml) and the β-glucuronidase assay of Fig.
2 (200 ng/ml) the two experiments together indicated
that recA is poorly expressed in uninduced conditions and
is strongly induced by mitomycin addition to the growth
medium.
Since recA expression is involved in the cell response to
heat shock and nutrient starvation [10], we decided to verify whether these stress conditions affected recA expression. Strain S1 was then grown at 42°C anaerobically to
mid exponential phase and shifted at 50°C for three
hours as previously reported [10]. A parallel culture was
grown at 42°C for 48 hours to induce nutrient starvation,
as previously reported [10]. Cell samples were collected
and assayed for β-glucuronidase activity (Methods). In
both stress conditions, the recA-driven β-glucuronidase
activity was similar to that measured in exponentially
growing cells not exposed to heat shock or nutrient starva-

Results obtained with the primer extension experiment of
Fig. 1 together with the analysis of the recA-driven β-glucuronidase activity of Fig. 2, suggest that expression of the
recA gene is transcriptionally controlled and is inducible
by DNA damages, caused in laboratory conditions by the
presence of mitomycin C in the growth medium [10].

to heat-shock or nutrient starvation. Data are the average of
three independent experiments.

Since in LexA-containing bacteria DNA damage-induction
is RecA-promoted [15,16], we decided to verify whether in
S. thermophilus such induction, although mediated by a
different protein, was still under RecA control. To evaluate
recA expression in a wild type and a recA null mutant we
performed RT-PCR experiments with the synthetic primers, A4 and A5 (Methods). Total RNA was extracted from
exponentially growing cells of the wild type and the recA
null mutant strain before and after exposure to sublethal
concentration (20 ng/ml) of mitomycin C [10] and measured spectrophotometrically. One-step reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) were carried out by using a Access RTPCR Kit (Promega). PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and the linearity of the
reactions tested amplifying the 16S RNA gene by using
various amounts of RNA for each sample as templates.
Equal amounts of RNA were then used as templates in RTPCR reactions to amplify the recA gene. As reported in Fig.
3, recA transcription was induced by sublethal concentration (20 ng/ml) of mitomycin C in both the wild type and
the recA mutant strain. The induction conditions used for
the experiment of Fig. 3 were identical to those used for
the primer extension of Fig. 1B and the observation that a
basal level of expression can be seen in Fig. 3 but not in
Fig. 1B is most likely due to the higher sensitivity of the
PCR-based approach.

Minimal DNA region needed for recA repression and
induction
To study the mechanism controlling recA expression in S.
thermophilus in more details we performed a deletion analysis of the recA promoter region. We started our analysis
from plasmid pNG1, containing 417 bp upstream and
191 bp downstream of the recA transcriptional start site,
and sufficient to ensure regulation and strong induction
of the gene (Fig. 2). Similarly to what described for the
construction of plasmid pNG1, a PCR-based strategy was
followed to obtain plasmids in which the 609 bp insert of
pNG1 was shortened at its 5' end of 89 (pNG2), 301
(pNG3) and 355 (pNG4) bp (Fig. 4). All plasmids were
independently used to transform competent cells of the S.
thermophilus strain Sfi39. Recombinant strains S1 (pNG1),
S2 (pNG2), S3 (pNG3) and S4 (pNG4), were all grown
anaerobically at 42°C and exponential cells collected and
assayed for β-glucuronidase activity. As shown in Fig. 4,
similar levels of β-glucuronidase activity were observed in
all strains grown in the presence or in the absence of mitomycin C (200 ng/ml). These results therefore indicated
that DNA carried by plasmid pNG4 contains all signals
needed for the transcriptional regulation of the gene.

These results indicate that the mitomycin-mediated
induction of recA expression is controlled in S. ther-

As determined with the primer extention of Fig. 1, the S.
thermophilus recA gene has a 132 bp DNA region that is

mophilus by a mechanism not requiring RecA, and thus
different from those so far described in other bacteria.

to sublethal concentration (20 ng/ml) of mitomycin C [10]. The 16S RNA gene was used as a standard to calibrate the amount
of RNA to be used with synthetic oligonucleotides amplifying the recA gene.

Deletion analysis of the recA regulatoryregion
Deletion analysis of the recA regulatoryregion. The various plasmids carrying the recA promoter region translationally

sublethal concentration (200 ng/ml) of mitomycin C [10] are reported. For each plasmid transcriptional and translational start
points are indicated. The extension of S. thermophilus DNA carried by each plasmid is indicated referring to the transcriptional

transcribed but not translated. To verify whether this
region, present in plasmid pNG4, contains transcriptional
signals we constructed plasmid pNG5 (Methods), carrying a 75 bp deletion within the 132 bp untranslated
region (Fig. 4). Strain S5, carrying plasmid pNG5, was
then assayed in parallel with strains S1, S2, S3 and S4 and
showed similar levels of β-glucuronidase activity both in
the absence and in the presence of the inducer mitomycin
C (Fig. 4).
Our deletion analysis indicate that a DNA fragment of 83
bp, extending from 62 bp upstream and 21 bp downstream of the transcriptional start site, has all the information for regulation and full induction of the recA gene.

Conclusion
1) We have characterized the recA promoter region of S.
thermophilus and observed that expression of the gene is
strictly regulated and induced by DNA damages.
2) Although RecA is required for S. thermophilus response
to heat shock and nutrient starvation, expression of its
structural gene is not affected by either stress condition.
3) Although functionally homologous to the LexA protein
of other bacteria, the S. thermophilus protein controlling
recA expression is not a structural homolog of LexA.
4) Unlike LexA of E. coli, the S. thermophilus protein controlling recA expression acts in a RecA-independent fashion.

5) An 83 bp DNA fragment containing the recA promoter
and extending from 62 bp upstream to 21 bp downstream
of the transcriptional start site, has all signals for regulation of the gene.

Methods
Bacterial strains, growth conditions and bacterial
transformation
Strains used were S. thermophilus Sfi39 [23] and E. coli
DH5α [24]. S. thermophilus was grown in anaerobic conditions in either HJL liquid medium or LM17 (lactose supplemented M17) solid medium [25]. The E. coli strain was
grown aerobically in LB medium [24].

S. thermophilus and E. coli cells were transformed with
plasmid DNA as previously described by electroporation
[10] and by CaCl2-treatment [23], respectively.
Primer extension analysis
Total RNA was extracted from exponentially growing cells
before and after exposure to 20 ng/ml mitomycin C, by
use of the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN). 50 μg of total RNA were
used with γ32PdATP (NEN) labeled oligonucleotides (A3:
5'-CCTCTTCTTTCTGTG-3' and A4: 5'-CAACGCTCATCACCAA-3'), dNTP and AMV Reverse transcriptase (BRL)
to prime cDNA synthesis, as previously described [26].
Reaction products were fractionated on 8M urea – 6%
polyacrilamide gels alongside with DNA sequencing reactions primed with the same oligonucleotide.

Reverse transcription-PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted from a wild type and a isogenic
strain carrying a recA null mutation before and after 30
min of exposure to 20 ng/ml of mitomicin C by use of
RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Each RNA sample was treated with
DNAse turbo (Ambion) following manufacturer instructions and the amount of RNA determined by spectophotometer. Identical amounts of RNA (200 ng) were then
used in one-step RT-PCR experiments using ACCESS RTPCR SYSTEM (Promega) and primer sets specific for the
recA gene (A4: GGTGGAAGAAGTCGATCTGATG; A5
CCTTGCTCACCAGAATCAGGC) and for the 16S ribosomal gene (16S-for: CCGCAGCTAACGCATTAAGC; 16Srev: GACTCGCAACTCGTTGTACC) used as RNA concentration control. PCRs were carried out with RNA alone to
exclude that the amplification products could derive from
contaminating genomic DNA.
Plasmid construction
pGU0 plasmid was obtained by inserting a DNA fragment
with EcoRI flanking ends and coding for the gusA gene of
E. coli into the pGEMT-easy plasmid (PROMEGA) previously digested with the same restriction enzyme. A 609 bp
DNA fragment, containing the recA promoter region (417
nucleotides upstream and 191 downstream transcriptional start site) was PCR amplified using S. thermophilus
chromosomal DNA as a template and oligonucleotides P1
(5'-GCTTGCTGATCTCATCT-3') and P5 (5'-AAACCATGGCTCATCAT CACCAAACTTC-3') as primers. The PCR
fragment was digested with the NotI restriction enzyme
and cloned into pGU0, previously digested with the same
enzyme, yielding plasmid pGU1.

The recA::gusA translational fusion was then moved by
using SacI and SphI/NspI restriction sites, in the pNZ124
vector, able to produce a RepA protein and, as a consequence, to replicate in S. thermophilus. The resulting plasmid, pNG1, was then used to transform competent cells
of S. thermophilus strain Sfi39.

primer pairs. Amplified fragments were independently
cloned into pGEM-Teasy vectors and the recombinant
plasmids double digested with SmaI (inserted with oligonucleotides SMF1 and SMF2) and ScaI (present in pGEMTeasy). Released DNA fragments of 1.564 and 2.090 bp
were then ligated to produce an intermediate vector carrying the recA fragment of plasmid pNG4 with an internal
deletion. This fragment was then used to replace the wild
type recA sequence of pNG4 by double digestion with
Aor51HI and AvaII restriction enzymes.

β-glucuronidase assays
β-glucuronidase assays were performed as previously
described [27]. For each sample a graph of A405 (Y-axis)
versus time in minutes (X-axis) was designed; the slope S
of the graph in A405units per minute was estimated and
units of activity (nanomoles of p-nitrophenyl glucuronide
hydrolysed per minute) were calculated from S/Ve × 0.02;
where Ve is the volume of permeabilized cells in ml and
0.02 represents A405 given relative to 1 nmol of product
produced. Specific activity equals units per A590. Values
reported here were the average of at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined
by Student's t test and the significance level was set at P <
0.05.
