Evolutionary maintenance of filovirus-like genes
in bat genomes
Derek J Taylor*, Katharina Dittmar, Matthew J Ballinger and Jeremy A Bruenn

Abstract
Background: Little is known of the biological significance and evolutionary maintenance of integrated nonretroviral RNA virus genes in eukaryotic host genomes. Here, we isolated novel filovirus-like genes from bat
genomes and tested for evolutionary maintenance. We also estimated the age of filovirus VP35-like gene
integrations and tested the phylogenetic hypotheses that there is a eutherian mammal clade and a marsupial/
ebolavirus/Marburgvirus dichotomy for filoviruses.
Results: We detected homologous copies of VP35-like and NP-like gene integrations in both Old World and New
World species of Myotis (bats). We also detected previously unknown VP35-like genes in rodents that are
positionally homologous. Comprehensive phylogenetic estimates for filovirus NP-like and VP35-like loci support two
main clades with a marsupial and a rodent grouping within the ebolavirus/Lloviu virus/Marburgvirus clade. The
concordance of VP35-like, NP-like and mitochondrial gene trees with the expected species tree supports the notion
that the copies we examined are orthologs that predate the global spread and radiation of the genus Myotis.
Parametric simulations were consistent with selective maintenance for the open reading frame (ORF) of VP35-like
genes in Myotis. The ORF of the filovirus-like VP35 gene has been maintained in bat genomes for an estimated 13.
4 MY. ORFs were disrupted for the NP-like genes in Myotis. Likelihood ratio tests revealed that a model that
accommodates positive selection is a significantly better fit to the data than a model that does not allow for
positive selection for VP35-like sequences. Moreover, site-by-site analysis of selection using two methods indicated
at least 25 sites in the VP35-like alignment are under positive selection in Myotis.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that filovirus-like elements have significance beyond genomic imprints of prior
infection. That is, there appears to be, or have been, functionally maintained copies of such genes in mammals.
“Living fossils” of filoviruses appear to be selectively maintained in a diverse mammalian genus (Myotis).

Background
While genomic transfers from retroviruses to eukaryotic
hosts are well known and expected, transfers from nonretroviral RNA viruses to eukaryotes are unexpected [1].
Non-retroviral RNA viruses lack the coding for reverse
transcriptase and the integration machinery needed for
successful transfer to DNA genomes. However, several
recent studies have provided evidence for widespread viral
transfer to fungi[2-4], animals [3,5-10], and plants [3].
These transfers have been termed NIRVs (non-retroviral
integrated RNA viruses) because the integrated elements
differ from endogenous viruses in their requirement for
co-option of integration machinery and in their normally

subgenic architecture [3,4,10,11]. A NIRV is a subclass of
paleovirus or endogenous viral element (EVE,[8]). Unlike
other paleoviruses, there is no evidence that a NIRV has
ever coded for an active endogenous viral genome or is
capable of copying itself as with endogenous retroviruses.
Several studies have implicated and identified the signatures of retrotransposon activity in association with NIRV
formation [3,4,6,7,10].
Because NIRVs are a form of “fossil” viral element, their
recognition permits, for the first time, study of the deeper
evolution of non-retroviral RNA viruses and an understanding of the timescale of genomic interactions. The
ages of NIRVs have turned out to be much older than
those age estimates from molecular clocks based on
nucleotide substitution rates. Horie et al. [7], for example,
assigned a date of >40 My for the integration of

bornaviruses into primate genomes based on phylogenetic
clades of NIRVs from genome assemblies. The determination of orthology can be complicated by gene duplications
and horizontal transfers of NIRVs among hosts [4].
Homology is unambiguous when the dated NIRVs are
monophyletic and share integration locations (i.e., synteny
or positional homology). Taylor et al. [10] provided a
minimum date of about 10 million years for filovirus-like
NP gene NIRVs based on the shared integration location
and monophyly in rodents that have dated fossil records.
Still, the timescale of host interactions for nonretroviral
RNA viruses (including those viruses with NIRVs) remains
poorly studied.
The biological significance of NIRVs beyond that of a
viral fossil record remains controversial. Have NIRVs been
co-opted by eukaryotic hosts for a novel or an antiviral
function? Thus far, evolutionary evidence for maintenance
of NIRVs among host species has been ambiguous.
Although the vast majority of known NIRVs have disrupted open reading frames (ORFs), extended ORFs and
RNA transcripts of NIRVs have been identified in mosquitoes [6], yeast [4], primates [5,7] and plants [3]. But these
cases of NIRV RNA expression involved only one or two
species per group and, with the exception of the Arabidopsis IAA-leucine-resistant protein 2 (ILR2;[3,12]), could be
the result of transcriptional noise. Evidence of significant
selective maintenance among species in the yeast-totivirus
NIRV is complicated by the dearth of known orthologs
[4]. There is some evidence for evolutionary maintenance
in the mammal-filovirus-like NP NIRV system [4,10] and
in the primate-Borna virus systems [8]. But in each case, a
substantial proportion of the species in the analyses of
NIRV maintenance had disrupted ORFs. As such, the
existing evolutionary analyses of NIRVs in mammals indicate more a slowed rate of erosion in codon structure than
selection for maintenance of an ORF [13]. Presently, it is
difficult to determine when or if selective maintenance has
occurred in known NIRVs because the comparisons normally involve sparse taxonomic sampling and distantly
related host genome assemblies. An improved test of the
selective maintenance of NIRVs would involve a comparison of regions that lack ORF disruptions and have demonstrated positional homology within a closely related group
of animals such as a genus.
Filovirus-like NIRVs in mammals are candidates for a
more detailed study of selective maintenance. Taylor et al.
[10] isolated copies of the NP-like gene from specimens of
the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), the little brown bat
(Myotis lucifugus) and the tammar wallaby (Macropus
eugenii), but each of these NIRVs appeared to be pseudogenized. Belyi et al. [5] detected an extended open reading
frame of a VP35-like gene from a BLAST query of the
NCBI genome assembly of the little brown bat (Myotis
lucifugus). As filoviral VP35 has been shown to interfere

Page 2 of 11

with host defences, the acquisition of a mammalian NIRV
has been proposed as a putative co-option to interfere
with viral infection [5]. The presence of an open reading
frame of a NIRV in a single genome assembly could be
associated with function or merely indicate a recent integration where there has been insufficient time to accrue
ORF disruptions. Pseudogenization for bats could also be
a slow process compared to similar-sized mammals,
requiring an estimated 2.02 My of neutral evolution just to
reach a 50% probability of ORF disruption [14]. Several
mammals including mouse and rat have been identified as
possessing the filovirus NP-like NIRVs [10], but only the
tarsier, tammar wallaby, and little brown bat have been
identified as possessing the VP35-like NIRVs [5]. None of
the BLAST-matched VP35 NIRVs have been verified by
independent DNA sequencing. One limitation of the
BLAST approach for identifying NIRVs is the tendency for
underestimation of NIRVs when only known viral genes
are used as queries. When clades of NIRVs are detected
that are divergent from known viruses, their membership
might be underrepresented. One way around this problem
is to carry out secondary BLAST searches with the divergent NIRVs as queries [10]. More NIRV sequences from
VP35 would be particularly important in testing the
hypothesis [10] that known filoviruses form two divergent
clades (Marburgviruses, ebolaviruses with marsupial
NIRVs) and (placental mammal NIRVs with an unidentified filovirus clade). It is presently unclear if the VP35-like
NIRVs form the same phylogenetic associations with
known filoviruses [5,15] as found with the other filoviruslike NIRVs.
Here we test for the evolutionary maintenance of
filovirus VP35-like and NP-like NIRVs in the bat genus
Myotis. Myotis is a diverse genus of mammals (> 100 species) and is thought to have radiated from Asia to every
continent save Antarctica over the past 13.4 My [16,17].
There are several congruent studies of both nuclear and
mitochondrial genes [16-18] that find three main geographic clades of Myotis (North America, South America
and Old World). We test positional homology by PCR
amplifying between the VP35 NIRV and a neighboring
gene. We also compare the evolution of NP and VP35-like
NIRVs in Myotis. The results provide evidence that filovirus-like integrations are more widespread in mammals
than previously thought and that these transferred genes
have been exposed to positive selection and selection for
open reading frames in bats.

Results and Discussion
tBLASTn searches of the WGS database using the filovirus-like VP35 NIRV of Myotis lucifugus (i.e., the ORF
of the genome project: AAPE02000262.1, 88641-89459)
as a query sequence, yielded three previously unknown
mammal species matches with expect values <10 -5

(Additional file 1, Table S1). The Chinese hamster
(Cricetulus griseus), mouse and rat had significant
matches using this bat query, with hamster having the
best match for these rodents. The strongest match in
rats (mapped to chromosome 9) had a highly significant
BLAST match to the mouse genome (CAAA01163972.1;
1e-34; Chromosome 1). We note that the known marsupial VP35-like NIRV did not appear as a match when
the Myotis lucifugus sequence was used as a query, presumably a result of a BLAST analysis where subjects are
from divergent clades. When the VP35 of Marburgvirus
was used as a query, different contigs of the Chinese
hamster (Cricetulus griseus) had the best matching
sequences in the WGS. Likewise, when NP of Marburgvirus was used as a query, the Chinese hamster again
had the best match. We also detected a new NP-like
NIRV from the naked mole rat (that is, in addition to
those detected by Taylor et al. [10]).
We tested for positional homology and integration by
DNA sequencing PCR products in Myotis. A translated
BLAST of the Myotis lucifugus contig (AAPE02000262.1)
with the VP35-like NIRV revealed a neighboring LINE-1
reverse transcriptase element (Figure 1) with the best
match being from Bos Taurus (AAY53484.1; E value =
1e-110; Maximum identity = 71%). A nucleotide BLAST
using the primers from the LINE-1 element and the
VP35-like region as queries, and the Myotis lucifugus
genome assembly (WGS) as a database, yielded only a
single match to the targeted region of cont2.261
(AAPE02000262). DNA sequence from a PCR product
using a primer in this LINE-1 element and a primer in
the VP35-like region suggested the positional homology
the Myotis sp. sequences used in the present study. Two
of the PCR products (M. albescens and M. horsfieldii) for
the intergenic region failed to yield clean sequence so an
additional intergenic primer was used. Another PCR was
carried out to obtain overlapping sequence from the
remaining VP35-like region in the examined bat specimens. Although all of the bats examined in the genus
Myotis had a VP35-like element, none of the other genera
of bats assayed for VP35 yielded a positive amplicon

(including other vesper bats). NP-like amplicons were
obtained in several species of bat, but reliable sequence
was obtained from only Myotis and Eptesicus. More
genome assemblies of bats are needed to determine if
this lack of a match is due to sequence divergence of the
primer sites or to the lack of filovirus-like NIRVs. Still,
the finding of VP35-like DNA sequence with the same
upstream neighboring LINE-1 element in the genus Myotis establishes positional homology for the VP35-like elements. We also note that an Old World species (Myotis
blythii) has the same putative 5’ direct repeat and canonical transcription start site (of LINE-1 elements) in the
same location (+3 bp from indels) as that identified by
Belyi et al. [5] for the New World species, Myotis lucifugus. Strongly repetitive sequence appears to have shortened our sequence reads for other species of bats in the
intergenic area. Our result supports homology among bat
inserts for VP35 and the hypothesis that bat NIRVs result
from target-primed reverse transcription of filoviral
mRNA by LINE elements [5,10]. The positional homology of the previously unknown rodent VP35-like
sequences was established by comparisons of synteny
between mouse and rat genomes. The VP35-like element
on CHR 9 of the rat and on CHR 1 of the mouse appear
to be in markedly syntenous genome locations, supporting positional homology (Additional file 2, Figure S1).
More evidence of homology for the filovirus-like
sequences in the genus Myotis is provided by phylogenies
that match the expected species trees. Prottest determined
that the JTT+G model was the best fit with the AIC criterion for both amino acid alignments. The K80+G model
was determined to be the best model for the nucleotide
alignments of the two nuclear genes. The TN93+G+I substitution model was determined to be the best-fit model
for the mitochondrial gene sequences of the genus Myotis.
For each of the three genes (mitochondrial cytochrome
oxidase subunit I, VP35-like NIRVs, NP-like NIRVs)
sequenced, the estimated phylogenetic tree was similar in
topology. That is, there is a North American, South American, and Old World clade for most genes (Figures 2,3;
Additional file 3, Figure S2). This finding suggests that for
each NIRV, the integration predated the radiation of Myotis from Asia. The relationships within each continent are
also nearly identical across genes. For example, the Neotropical species Myotis riparius and M. nigricans are
strongly supported as sister taxa in every gene tree. Most
of the specimens were closely related to conspecifics on
the mitochondrial gene tree (Additional file 3, Figure
S2A). Sequences of Myotis blythii and Myotis muricola
browni were distantly related to known mitochondrial
sequences from the genus Myotis or others from the present study. Consistent with our results, Stadelmann et al.
[17] concluded that specimens identified as M. muricola
browni from the Phillipines belonged to an undescribed or

different species from M. muricola. We also note that the
specimen identified as M. nigricans groups with one of the
two known clades of M. riparius on the COI tree and not
with the M. nigricans clade. This discordance with species
names could be a reflection of the difficulty in morphological diagnosis of species in the genus. We detected three
copies of NP-like genes and one copy of the VP35-like
gene in the most recent genome assembly for Myotis lucifugus (Myoluc 2.0; released September 2010). The two
additional NP-like copies in M. lucifugus form a distinct
basal clade to the NP-like gene sequences isolated in the
present study from bats (see the amino acid-based phylogeny in Additional file 3, Figure S2B). However, the two
basal paralogs lack significant similarity at the nucleotide
level (as indicated by a BLAST search) to the NP-like
sequences from the present study. Where there are additional disagreements among genes, the support values are

weak, suggesting a lack of signal rather than non-orthology. Similar topological patterns are observed for the
VP35 and NP phylogenies in bats based on amino acid
alignments (Additional file 3, Figures S2B, C). The largely
congruent topologies for each gene to the expected species
tree supports the notion that the NIRV formations
occurred before the Myotis species radiation and geographic expansion to the New World. That is, the NIRV
copies that we isolated appear to be ancient orthologs.
The determination of orthology and positional homology permits estimation of minimum ages of viral-host
associations. For Myotis, the VP35-like gene is estimated
to have had an ORF for at least 13.4 My (11-18 My
with error bars). The timescale estimates are based on
the dating of the divergence of Myotis with multigenic
molecular analyses and at least two internal fossil calibrations [16,17]. The insertion of the NP NIRV predates

the common ancestor of Eptesicus and Myotis, which
has been estimated at 25 My (19-30 My range) using
multiple fossil calibrations and loci [19]. The proposed
minimum age of the Rattus/Mus common ancestor
based on dating of the oldest fossil record of the genus
Progonomys (the presumed genus of the Rattus/Mus
common ancestor) is 12.3 My [20]. Although knowledge
of the timescale of mammalian radiations is in a state of
flux, it is clear that NP-like and VP35-like genes are
ancient and independently integrated in rodents and in
bats.
The two NIRV loci in Myotis appear to be evolving
under different selective regimes. The ORF for VP35-like
elements has been maintained during the radiation (Additional file 4, Figure S3). The few heterozygous sites found
also failed to disrupt the reading frames. Further analyses

indicate that the lack of observed ORF disruptions in the
genus is unlikely to be due to chance or to a lack of sufficient evolutionary time for disruption. First, independent
deletions (9 bp and 39 bp) are observed that fail to disrupt
the reading frame (Additional file 4, Figure S3). As about
83% of indel mutations are expected to disrupt the ORF
[21], it is unlikely (P = 0.0289) that two independent large
indels would be shared by several taxa and still maintain
the open reading frame over millions of years of neutral
evolution. As most indel mutations are less than eight
nucleotides [22], the presence of only large indels in the
VP35-like region of Myotis suggests that many smaller
indels have been culled by selection. But, even if indels are
ignored as a source of ORF disruptions, our simulations
indicate that at least twelve premature stop codons are
expected per alignment under neutral evolution for the

VP35-like element in Myotis (Figure 4). The K80+G model
was input for the parametric simulation (where kappa =
2.48 and gamma shape = 0.234). The observed value of
zero stop codons per alignment had a frequency of 0.007
in the parametric simulations under no selection for ORF
maintenance. Thus, with over 13 My of neutral evolution

in Myotis, ORFs in the VP35-like region are not expected
to be observed from chance alone. The same timescale of
evolution revealed ongoing ORF disruption of the NP-like
NIRV (with a similar alignment length and genetic divergence as the VP35 region) elements of bats (Additional file
5, Figure S4). At least one ORF disruption of the NP-like

NIRVs is shared among species of Myotis. Taken together,
the indel and simulation analyses suggest that there has
been selective maintenance of the ORF for the VP35-like
genes but not for the NP-like genes in Myotis during their
radiation across continents. Finally, Bayesian evolutionary
models that accommodate codon usage differences
revealed a pattern of positive selection for the VP35-like
genes. A model that allows for positive selection (Model
M8; Likelihood = -2121.07) was a better fit (according to a
Likelihood ratio test that had a significance level of P =
0.001) than a model that does not allow for positive selection (Model M8a; Likelihood = -2126.93). Eliminating the
lucifugus sequence from NY to yield the same taxon set as
the NP gene alignment still resulted in a significance level
of P = 0.01. Site specific analysis in Selecton indicated that
32 codon positions in the VP35 NIRV alignment had
lower confidence interval bounds for Ka /Ks of > 1, indicating positive selection at these sites (Additional file 6,Table
S2). Similarly REL analysis in HyPhy found 25 sites (each
also found by Selecton) to be under significant positive
selection (Additional file 6,Table S2). The NP-like gene
alignment for Myotis lacked a significant improvement in
fit with a model that accommodated positive selection
(Model M8; Likelihood = -2031.48; Model M8a; Likelihood = -2033.26; P = NS). Our results suggest that filovirus-like elements have been co-opted by bats and that a
VP35-like gene has been well maintained and modified by
selection for over > 13 My.
We attempted to carry out RT-PCR of the VP35-like
region in Myotis lucifugus to test for gene expression.
However, no RNA product was detected, despite observing an RNA band for the actin gene (Additional file 7,
Figure S5). It remains unknown if there is an expression
product for VP35 in bats or if expression is induced
under specific conditions such as filoviral infection.
Although filovirus NP-like genes have previously been
detected in marsupial EST databases [10], we detected
no VP35-like NIRVs in EST databases. It is clear that

filoviruses have undergone significant coevolution with
mammalian hosts as they have developed several
mechanisms to counter mammalian host immune
responses. Notably, some of these countermeasures
involve VP35-mediated suppression of RNA silencing
[23], dsRNA binding activity and antagonism of the
interferon response[24]. As Belyi et al. [5] note, VP35like gene expression could be a coevolutionary answer
of mammals to the multifarious immunosuppressive role
of viral VP35. While at least two sites in the interferonbinding motif of VP35 of Myotis appear to have undergone selection to change their residues, most other residues in this area appear to be exposed to varying
degrees of purifying selection (Figure 5). Although there
has been significant progress in understanding the function and structure of VP35 in ebolaviruses, it is important to realize that functions such as interferon
inhibition likely differ among filoviruses [25] – the clade
that contains the bat VP35-like genes is quite divergent
from ebolaviruses. In essence, the functional interactions
of the filovirus-VP35-like NIRVs with viral products
remain unknown. Ideally, closely related exogenous and
endogenous filoviruses will be discovered that will
enable the development of an experimental system to
study function.
Our results show that VP35-like and NP-like NIRVs are
even more taxonomically widespread in mammals than
thought (Figure 6). With our discovery of new NIRVs in
rodents and 10 species of vespertilionid bats, the results
support two major clades of filovirus-like NIRVs in mammals. However, these clades lack a strict association with
placental and marsupial mammals (indeed the hamster
has NIRVs in both clades). One clade contains ebolaviruses, Lloviu virus, Marburgviruses, marsupials and the
Chinese hamster, and the other contains only placental
mammals (Additional file 3, Figures S2B, C). The hamster and the wallaby genomes contain NIRVs within the
ebolavirus/Marburgvirus clade. Note that Taylor et al. [9]

Figure 6 Cartoon of idealized genome map of a filovirus showing known mammalian NIRVs and their two major clades. Shown are
three gene regions of filovirus genomes that are known to have mammalian NIRVs. Red and blue colored boxes indicate phylogenetic clades.
The bat cartoon indicates the gene region in Myotis that appears to have an open reading frame maintained.

found the same root location that we found here when
they used related (non-filoviral Mononegavirales)
sequences for outgroup rooting (NP and L genes). The
filovirus-NIRV phylogenies are consistent with host
jumps between placental and marsupial mammals. However, more NIRVs from mammalian genomes are needed
to address the timing of host switches. The recently discovered Lloviu virus [26,27] from a bat (Miniopterus
schreibersii), is only distantly related to the NIRVs from
bats (Myotis) in the present study. However, closely
related NIRVs and exogenous viruses seem to be rare – a
pattern predicted by the antiviral hypothesis for NIRVs.
Viromes of New World vespertilionid bats, including filovirus NIRV-containing Myotis lucifugus and Eptesicus
fuscus, have been shown to be very diverse, but lacking in
filoviruses [28,29]. Experimentation is needed to directly
test the antiviral function hypothesis for NIRVs in bats.

Conclusions
The results indicate that the largest species radiation in
mammals could be associated with the maintenance of a
“living” fossil copy of the VP35-like gene co-opted from
filoviruses. The results reveal a rare example of non-retroviral viral genes that have been successfully co-opted
by mammals.
Methods
Nucleic Acid Extractions

Total nucleic acids were extracted from wing punches
(Rabies Laboratory, New York State Health Dept.), or
from preserved tissue using the Qiagen blood and

tissues nucleic acids extraction kit (Qiagen) or the DNA
Quickextract solution (Epicentre®). Thus, no live bats
were harmed by the extraction of nucleic acids during
this study. Sample information with voucher numbers
from the Field Museum of Natural History and the
American Museum of Natural History are provided in
Additional file 8, Table S3.
PCR, RTPCR, and DNA Sequencing

50 μl PCR reactions were assembled according to the
protocol for Takara Primestar HS DNA polymerase with
5 μL of extracted DNA template. Primers for sequencing
and PCR were: LINE1 to VP35-like intergenic region (5’GCCTCCTAAAATGAGTTTGTGAGTGTTCCCTGG
TC-3’; 5’-GAGTGGATGTTGCAGGTCCTGACATTACAGGC-3’ with an amplicon size of 2365 bp in Myotis
lucifugus); VP35-like region (5- CTTCTGTCTACG
TCTTCTAAGGTTAATC -3; 5- CCCGAGGCTTCCTTCAGGAGTTAG -3; with an amplicon size of 660 bp in
Myotis lucifugus). A third primer combination was used
to fill in gaps in sequences (5’- CTCGTCAGATCAGC
ATGTCCCTGGAGC -3’ and 5’-GAGTGGATGTTGCAGGTCCTGACATTACAGGC-3’). We used the primers of Taylor et al. [10] for the NP-like region and the
universal primers of Folmer et al. [30] for the mitochondrial gene. For the NP region, the new genome assembly
appears to have introduced a deletion (AAPE02007767)
for Myotis lucifugus. We used the latest assembly in the
present paper. The PCR temperature profiles were: 10
cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 59°C for 30 s and 72°C for 2 min,
with a touchdown to an annealing temperature of 48°C

Taylor et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:336
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/336

over 30 additional cycles and a final extension at 72°C for
5 min. A constant annealing temperature of 45°C was
used for the mitochondrial primers. PCR products were
purified and sequenced by the University of Washington
High Throughput Genomics Facility. Geneious 4.8 was
used to assemble and edit electrophoregrams. For RTPCR, total nucleic acids were extracted from a frozen
specimen of Myotis lucifugus. The internal organs were
ground in liquid nitrogen and a subsample was exposed
to extraction. RNA templates were exposed to DNAse.
The Qiagen One step RT-PCR kit was used with VP35like primers and primers for the actin gene (5’-ACAGG
TCCTTACGGATGTCG-3’; 5’-TATACGCTTCTGGC
CGTACC-3’) specific to Myotis lucifugus. New sequences
from this study have the following Genbank accession
numbers: JN847695-JN847723.
Bioinformatics

We searched for sequence similarity to filoviruses using
protein sequences based on the VP35 and the NP regions
of Marburgvirus (NC_001608.3) as a query with
tBLASTn in the WGS database of NCBI. Additional
searches (tBLASTn) in each of the available NCBI databases used the sequence of Myotis lucifugus as a query.
Nonviral subject sequences with expect values of E<10-5
and matches greater than 100 amino acid residues were
retained for phylogenetic analyses. VP35 sequences from
available filoviruses that differed at the AA level were
also added to the alignment. Taxonomy of filoviruses followed Kuhn et al. [26]. Filovirus-like Bat sequences from
Taylor et al.[10] were added to the NP-like analysis from
the present study. Mitochondrial sequences available at
NCBI for the genus Myotis were retained for the COI
gene alignment.
For genome assembly sequences, the sequence boundaries and translations identified by tBLASTn were used to
retrieve nucleotide sequences and assemble amino acid
sequences. MAFFT [31] was used to align the protein
sequences for the VP35 and NP analyses using the JTT100
model. Other alignments were unambiguous, requiring no
or few indels.
Phylogenetic estimates were obtained with a maximum
likelihood optimality criterion in PhyML 3.0 [32]. Models
were chosen according to the best available optimal model
from Modeltest [33] or Prottest [34] (ML). Reliability was
assessed by approximate likelihood ratio tests (aLRT: SH
like tests) and/or posterior probabilities. For PhyML, SPR
search algorithms were used with five random starting
trees.
Tests of selection were carried out using both genewide Bayesian methods [35] and site-specific tests. Genewide significance was assessed by comparing the fit of a
codon-based substitution model that permits sites with
positive selection (M8;[36]) to the fit of a null model that

Page 9 of 11

does not allow for positive selection (M8a; [37]). This
comparison was carried out with likelihood ratio tests
(LRTs) where DF = 1 [36]. The test statistic for the LRT
is calculated as twice the difference between the likelihood scores of the null model and the alternative model.
A Chi- square table is used to obtain the significance.
Unlike standard methods based on overall estimates of
Ka /Ks, codon-based models can account for among-site
variation in Ka /Ks by assigning sites to discrete rate categories. Significant selection at individual sites in the
alignment was assessed by two methods: by confidence
intervals around the Ka /Ks estimates in Selecton and by
the REL method [38] implemented in HyPhy [39,40].
Sites with a CI lower bound of Ka /Ks that exceeds 1 in
Selecton were considered to be under positive selection.
Sites with a Bayes factor of > 50 were considered as reliably under selection in HyPhy. As Selecton requires continuous ORFs, disrupted codons were replaced with gaps.
For the Bayesian estimate of K a /K s , an ML tree was
input after estimation with PhyML. Selection for ORF
maintenance was estimated using a parametric simulation approach modified from Katzourakis and Gifford
[8]. A centre of tree (COT) sequence was estimated using
DIVA [41,42]. The COT sequence, which had an open
reading frame, was used as a starting sequence for simulated neutral evolution with substitution and branch
length parameters input from the observed data. Seq-gen
was used to carry out 1000 evolutionary simulations from
the COT sequence [43]. The simulated alignments were
translated and visualized in Geneious and the number of
ORF disruptions per alignment was tallied. A histogram
of the ORF disruptions per simulated alignment was created in PASW statistics 18. The probability that an alignment would have complete ORFs by chance was
determined from the frequency of alignments with complete ORFs in the parametric simulation.
The orthology of filovirus-like VP35 genes in rat and
mouse was assessed by genomic BLAST searches and
visualized on the NCBI chromosome maps. We used the
Cinteny server [44] and Roundup database [45] for whole
chromosome comparisons of larger orthologous blocks.
