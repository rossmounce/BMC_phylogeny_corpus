Abstract
Background: Microsporidia are well known models of extreme nuclear genome reduction and
compaction. The smallest microsporidian genomes have received the most attention, but genomes
of different species range in size from 2.3 Mb to 19.5 Mb and the nature of the larger genomes
remains unknown.
Results: Here we have undertaken genome sequence surveys of two diverse microsporidia,
Brachiola algerae and Edhazardia aedis. In both species we find very large intergenic regions, many
transposable elements, and a low gene-density, all in contrast to the small, model microsporidian
genomes. We also find no recognizable genes that are not also found in other surveyed or
sequenced microsporidian genomes.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that microsporidian genome architecture varies greatly
between microsporidia. Much of the genome size difference could be accounted for by non-coding
material, such as intergenic spaces and retrotransposons, and this suggests that the forces dictating
genome size may vary across the phylum.

Background
Microsporidia are obligate intracellular eukaryotic parasites that have been found to infect members of all major
animal lineages [1]. The many apparently "primitive" features of microsporidian cells led evolutionary biologists
to suggest that they were an early-branching lineage of the
eukaryotes [2,3], but molecular phylogeny has since
shown that they are instead a derived relative of fungi
[4,5]. In light of this, their seemingly primitive features

have been re-evaluated as products of reduction and adaptation to life inside another cell [4-8].
One such feature that has attracted considerable attention
is their highly reduced genomes. The genome size has
been determined for numerous microsporidian species,
and they range from 19.5 Mbp in Glugea atherinae to just
2.3 Mbp in Encephalitozoon intestinalis, the smallest
eukaryotic genome known [9]. The two best-studied
examples are the vertebrate parasite Encephalitozoon

cuniculi (2.9 Mbp), the genome of which has been completely sequenced and encodes 1,997 protein-coding
genes [10], and the insect parasite Antonospora locustae
(5.4 Mbp) for which two sequence surveys are available
[11,12]. These two species revealed just how microsporidian genomes had become so small compared with those
of other eukaryotes. There has been a severe reduction in
the number of genes in the genome, most likely a reflection of the fact that microsporidia are dependent on their
hosts for many metabolic processes and import many
compounds from their host. Furthermore the genes that
remain are packed together very densely: intergenic spaces
are minimal. In E. cuniculi there are no selfish elements
and just 15 small introns. Genes in E. cuniculi are also
shorter than their homologues in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
which is hypothesized to result from the small number of
proteins within the cell, and a correspondingly smaller
interaction network [10,13]. This extreme compaction
appears to have resulted in a high level of gene order conservation between different species of microsporidia
[12,14-16] and an unusually high level of overlapping
transcription between adjacent genes [17,18].
Because the smallest microsporidian genomes are so unusual, they have garnered the greatest attention, and to date
no large-scale survey of any larger genomes is available.
This is unfortunate, because the form and content of these
larger microsporidian genomes could differ from the
smaller ones in many potentially interesting ways. On one
hand they may contain a great many more genes, and
could therefore reflect a greater cellular or metabolic complexity than the microsporidian parasites we presently
know best. On the other hand these genomes may encode
a great deal more non-coding DNA, which would have
interesting implications for genome evolution within the
group, and for why the smaller genomes are so compact.
In other eukaryotes, it appears that variation in genome
size on a relatively short evolutionary time scale is due to
increased or decreased proportions of transposable elements in a genome [19]. There are hints that this may also
be at least partially true in some microsporidian genomes
where selfish elements have been found [20,21]. Most

interestingly, a number of TY3/Gypsy retrotransposons
have recently been described from the 15.3 Mbp genome
of Nosema bombycis [22]. These elements are apparently
flanked by areas of compacted genes that share a high
level of synteny with E. cuniculi, perhaps suggesting an
invasion of transposable elements into a compacted
genome. More recently, the previously unsequenced subtelomeric areas of E. cuniculi have been investigated and
found to contain a large family of proteins with at least 30
distinct members. This family of duplicated proteins is
also found within other human infecting microsporidia
[23], demonstrating that the expansion of gene families
might be more common than previously thought.
Here, we describe low-redundancy genome sequence surveys of two distantly related microsporidia, Brachiola algerae (recently proposed to be renamed Anncaliia algerae
[24]) and Edhazardia aedis. Both of these species have
mosquitoes as their type hosts with the former having a
very broad host range, including man, and the latter
restricted to mosquitoes [25]. The genome size of E. aedis
is not known, whereas the genome size of B. algerae has
been estimated to be 15–20 Mbp [23]. In both species, we
show that gene density is very low compared to that of the
better-studied species of microsporidia. Specifically, we
have found a considerable proportion of repetitive elements in both genomes, large stretches of non-coding
DNA, and some evidence that the gene density may vary
over the genome. These surveys open the possibility that
microsporidian genomes are not universally compacted,
large genomes do not necessarily encode significantly
more genes than do the smaller genomes, and that dense
genomes may sometimes revert to a gene-sparse state.

Results and discussion
General features of the sequence data
Two short-insert genomic libraries were constructed from
B. algerae and a total of 219 clones fully or partially
sequenced to yield 203,748 bp of non-overlapping
sequence. A single E. aedis library was constructed and 290
sequence reads from 182 clones yielded 233,509 bp of
non-overlapping sequence. Comparing these with the

dense, gene-rich genome of E. cuniculi (Table 1) reveals a
sharp contrast in the overall nature of the genomes. From
the B. algerae survey, 34 genes with identifiable homologues in other organisms were identified, and a further
33 potential ORFs greater than 100 codons but with no
recognizable similarity to any other gene were found,
resulting in a protein-coding content of 11% identifiable
coding sequence and 20% including putative ORFs. In E.
aedis, only 25 identifiable protein-coding genes and 21
ORFs were found, pushing the range of coding sequence
still lower, to 8% identifiable coding sequence or 14% if
putative ORFs are included (Table 1). In contrast, 52% of
the E. cuniculi genome consists of protein-coding
sequences with recognizable similarity to other genes, and
the proportion of coding sequence is 87% when ORFs are
included [10]. The gene density of A. locustae is similar to
that of E. cuniculi [12], as are small regions of other microsporidian genomes that have been sampled [20]. Overall,
the gene-densities of B. algerae and E. aedis are about an
order of magnitude lower than other microsporidia that
have been examined to date.
The overall GC content for both B. algerae (24%) and E.
aedis (25%) is also significantly lower than that of E.
cuniculi (47%). Not surprisingly, the GC content in the
coding regions is slightly higher: 28% for B. algerae and
31% for E. aedis. A smaller sequence survey from Spraguea
lophii with a genome size of 6.2 Mb has revealed a bias of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/200

28% [20,26]. There is therefore no obvious correlation
between genome size and drift towards low GC content in
microsporidia, and similarly no pronounced lineage-specific bias.
Presence of transposable elements
In contrast to the E. cuniculi genome, which does not
encode any selfish genetic elements, fragments of reverse
transcriptase or complete retrotransposons have been
reported in the genomes of N. bombycis, V. corneae and S.
lophii [20-22], and repeated sequences suggested to be
mobile were reported in N. bombycis and N. costelytrae
[27]. The V. corneae reverse transcriptase is closely related
to a human LINE sequence, and both the N. bombycis and
S. lophii retrotransposons have sequence similarity to each
other and to Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons.

In both B. algerae and E. aedis surveys we found extensive
evidence of numerous transposable elements (Table 2).
The E. aedis fragments all share high similarity to Ty3/
gypsy retrotransposons from the N. bombycis and S. lophii.
Nine of the seventeen fragments of putatively selfish elements identified in B. algerae are also members of the
same family, and once more also share a high degree of
similarity to the N. bombycis and S. lophii elements. The
remaining fragments from B. algerae were similar to hypothetical proteins resembling transposases.

The level of similarity between the Ty3/gypsy elements
from N. bombycis, S. lophii, E. aedis and B. algerae and the
fact that the host groups for these four species are not
closely related, is strongly suggestive that an ancestral
family of retrotransposons existed in the common ancestor of these microsporidia. In molecular phylogenies of
microsporidia, the true Nosema-group is consistently
found to be a sister-lineage of the Encephalitozoon-group to
the exclusion of lineages that include E. aedis, B. algerae
and S. lophii [28-30]. If the Ty3/gypsy retroelements identified here are ancestral to the genomes where they have
been found, it means that it was also ancestral to E.
cuniculi and must have been completely purged from its
genome. This raises some curious questions about the N.
bombycis genome. Here, the Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons
were found to be nested within blocks of compacted genes
that were often conserved in order with homologues from
other microsporidian genomes [22]. Based on this it was
suggested that the elements could have invaded a compact
genome, and perhaps later facilitated some genomic rearrangements [22]. Reconciling the ancient presence of
these elements with the nature of the N. bombycis genome
is complicated. It is possible that the ancestral genome
contained many such elements and had a low gene density. This genome could have subsequently compacted in
several lineages, some of which lost the retroelements as
part of the compaction process (e.g., E. cuniculi), while
others kept them and compacted the genome around
them (e.g., N. bombycis). It is also possible that compaction happened in an earlier common ancestor of some of
these lineages and that certain genomes have 'reexpanded'. In either event, the retention of large numbers
of selfish elements in an otherwise compact genome is of
interest, as one might expect that compaction would be
strongly inclined to lead to the loss of non-coding material such as selfish elements. It serves to illustrate the way
compaction affects different aspects of the genome in different lineages, another possible example being the differential loss or retention of introns in relict nucleomorph
genomes [31,32].

meric region next to an SSU gene) and 2,068 bp in B. algerae and E. aedis, respectively. The average distance
between genes in E. cuniculi and A. locustae samples is 129
and 211 bp [10,12]. From the existing data it seems likely
that the average distance between genes in B. algerae and
E. aedis is much larger than that of either of the well studied microsporidian genomes, and that the density across
at least the B. algerae genome may be more heterogeneous.
Of the pairs of adjacent genes we identified, one B. algerae
pair is also adjacent in both A. locustae and E. cuniculi (Figure 1) (the pair separated by 206 bp in B. algerae). It has
previously been shown that the order of gene pairs in A.
locustae and E. cuniculi is highly conserved, and this has
been hypothesized to be related to the compaction of the
genome [12]. The conservation of one of four B. algerae
gene pairs suggests that areas of this genome may be
under similar constraints. If the conservation of genome
order is related to compaction, this also suggests that the
compacted state may have existed in the ancestor of B.
algerae, E. cuniculi and A. locustae, which is consistent with

Gene density, order, and size
The small number of genes identified and the large continuous stretches of non-coding sequence in both surveys
lead to the obvious conclusion that the gene-density of
these genomes is much lower than those of E. cuniculi or
A. locustae. The average intergenic distances in these
genomes cannot readily be determined since few have
been completely sequenced. In B. algerae four clones
encoded two genes and the distances between them are
108, 206, 276, and 552 bp. In E. aedis a single clone
encoded two adjacent genes, and the intergenic spaces
between them is 1,324 bp. At the same time, the largest
continuous stretches of sequence from which we could
identify no genes were 2,412 (or 2,943 in a likely subtelo-

Our sampling of E. aedis and B. algerae genomes shows
that this scenario is quite possible. Of the protein-coding

The E. cuniculi genome clearly under went a massive gene
loss relative to other eukaryotes, but this gene loss may
have been ancestral to microsporidia. If this were the case
we would expect to find few genes in E. aedis and B. algerae
that are present and conserved in other eukaryotes that are
not also present in E. cuniculi. That is to say that the B.
algerae and E. aedis genomes would not have more conserved genes than the pool remaining in the ancestral
microsporidian after this gene loss event.

Gene content and coding capacity
There is no experimental estimate of the E. aedis genome
size, but the B. algerae genome has been estimated to be
between 15–20 Mbp by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
[23]. This is much larger than the genomes of either E.
cuniculi (2.9 Mbp) or A. locustae (5.4 Mbp). As we show,
much of the genome size difference can be attributed to
the significantly lower gene-densities of B. algerae and E.
aedis. However, it is still possible that one or both of these
genomes is also larger because it contains more genes than
E. cuniculi.

In addition to being densely packed, E. cuniculi genes have
also been shown to be shorter on average than homologues in the S. cerevisiae genome [10]. This has been discussed in the context of genome compaction, but also
suggested to be the result of a reduction in the number of
proteins in the cell, which leads to smaller interaction networks, which in turn allows proteins to reduce their
number or complexity of interacting domains [13]. In
yeast, it has been shown that there is a correlation
between protein size and connectivity, with larger proteins displaying a greater number of interactions [33]. We
examined the only five full-length genes identified in the
B. algerae survey with homologues in yeast and found that
all five were shorter than S. cerevisiae homologues, and
more surprisingly most were also shorter than the E.
cuniculi homologues (Figure 2). Similarly, from the E.
aedis survey, only five full-length genes were found (Figure
2), and four of these were shorter than S. cerevisiae homologues, and comparable in size with the E. cuniculi homologues. The sole E. aedis protein predicted to be larger than
the yeast counterpart encodes a ribosomal protein (Figure
2). Given that these genomes are not compacted, it suggests that proteins are either shorter due to a reduced proteome complexity, or that they had an ancestor with a
compacted genome, or both.

Schizosaccahromyces pombe (Sp) in cases where S. cerevisiae
does not encode a homologue).
(25 cases), every one is also present in E. cuniculi (Table
3). Given the sample size, it is likely that either genome
could contain some genes found in other organisms but
not E. cuniculi, but it is unlikely that they are abundant.
This lack of excess conserved gene homologues is of interest because it implies that the large-scale gene loss characteristic of E. cuniculi took place relatively early in
microsporidian evolution, in the ancestor of E. cuniculi, A.
locustae, E. aedis and B. algerae.
However, the B. algerae survey consisted of 20% coding
sequence, so taking into account the range or estimated
genome sizes for B. algerae (15–20 Mbp), this suggests
between 2,786 and 3,714 genes in the Brachiola genome
(assuming an average gene length of 1,077 as in E.
cuniculi). The discrepancy between this predicted coding
capacity of B. algerae and the observation that all the recognizable genes we sampled are shared with E. cuniculi
could be explained in many ways. First, our sample may
be biased to gene-encoding regions, and this would lead
to an overestimate of the gene-density. Second, a large
number of lineage-specific ORFs could skew the estimate,

but the proportion of ORFs we found (47% and 43% for
B. algerae and E. aedis, respectively) is similar to that found
in E. cuniculi (39%). This issue is also complicated by the
fact that we identified several E. cuniculi "ORFs" in our
sample, and therefore the proportions of putative ORFs is
changing. Third, the genome size estimates may be wrong.
Lastly, it is possible that there are many more than 2,000
genes in these organisms, but that the excess is mostly due
to recent duplications. We did not sample any duplicates
in either genome, though we did find areas of repeats
amongst the non-coding areas in both B. algerae and E.
aedis. If gene duplications are common, the genome could
contain more genes without an increased complexity in
the proteome.

Evolution of genome compaction in microsporidia
Though the phylogenetic relationships of major microsporidian lineages are not well resolved, phylogenies of
rRNA [28] and concatenated tubulin genes (unpublished
data) suggest a relationship between B. algerae and A.
locustae to the exclusion of E. aedis or E. cuniculi (Figure 3).
This raises interesting questions about whether microsporidian genomes have compacted more than once during the diversification of the phylum, or if some have reexpanded from a compacted state.

An obvious factor in the dynamics of genome size is transposable elements. One could imagine a genome expanding due to the invasion of such elements, and indeed

locustae is reported to be 5.4 Mb [37], whereas the spores
of both B. algerae and A. locustae are of comparable sizes
[38,39] suggesting, in this case, that cell size is not necessarily a factor. A further consideration is whether the complexity of the life cycles of different microsporidia is
reflected in genome size and gene number. Both A. locustae and E. cuniculi have a simple life cycle with monomorphic spores and are restricted to a narrow host range.
Edhazardia aedis has a more complex life cycle with multiple spore types and must be adapted to both the larval and
adult stage of the mosquito. Brachiola algerae, known to
have a larger genome, has a simple life cycle with monomorphic spores, but has a broad host range and can infect
both mammals and insects.

many such elements have been found in N. bombycis [22]
and now B. algerae and E. aedis. However, the majority of
these elements are closely related members of the Ty3/
gypsy family. Therefore genome expansion cannot be
entirely due to an invasion since the elements must have
existed in the common ancestor and been purged from E.
cuniculi and possibly other compacted microsporidian
genomes. It also remains to be seen if these genomes are
substantially heterogeneous. It is possible that many
genes do exist in relatively compact regions while other
regions are dominated by non-coding sequence. An
extreme version of such a situation is seen in the small and
compacted genome of the picoplankton Ostreococcus tauri.
Here most chromosomes in the genome show a high gene
density but 2 chromosomes out of 20 contain 77% of the
transposons
identified
in
the
genome
[34].
A second factor that has been hypothesized to affect
genome size is cell size. A correlation between genome
size and cell size has been observed in eukaryotes generally [35] and microsporidia specifically [36]. However in
the microsporidia, variation in cell size in the different life
stages can confound correlations between genome size
and cell size. As a rough correlation though, the genome
size of B. algerae is estimated at 15–20 Mb and that of A.

Conclusion
The E. cuniculi genome is a model for compacted nuclear
genomes, but potentially not a good model for microsporidian genomes generally. We have shown that the
genomes of B. algerae and E. aedis are structured very differently: they have large proportions of non-coding
sequence and many transposable elements, resulting in a
very low and perhaps variable gene-density compared
with E. cuniculi. The sample of identifiable genes found in
the surveys, and the proportions of these genes shared
with E. cuniculi both suggest that the complexity of the
proteome is not the major factor contributing to genome
size variation. The phylogeny of microsporidia suggests
multiple events of compaction and/or expansion, which
raises interesting questions about what forces the
genomes to compact so severely, and why such a force
would then cease to operate on the genome.

Methods
Microsporidia, genomic DNA extraction, and genomic
library construction
6.1 × 107 uninucleate Edhazardia aedis spores harvested
from Aedes aegypti larvae were ruptured by glass beadbeating, and spores were examined for breakage via light
microscopy. E. aedis genomic DNA was purified by the
standard phenol-chloroform method and served as template for whole genome rolling-circle amplification using
Genomiphi (Amersham). 4.5 μg of amplified E. aedis
genomic DNA was sheared, blunt end-repaired, and
cloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer's specifications. 182 different E. aedis
clones with an average length of 1,283 bp were endsequenced using ABI Big Dye 3.1 chemistry. Six different
E. aedis library clones containing coding, non-coding, or
transposable segments were checked for chimeric
sequence by PCR of non-Genomiphi-treated E. aedis
genomic DNA. From this, successful amplification of fragments between 250 and 450 bp did not support the idea
of chimeras being present in the Genomiphi-created E.
aedis genomic library.

DNA was extracted from 2 × 107germinated Brachiola algerae spores (a strain originally isolated the mosquito
Anopheles stephensi). Spores were cultivated in vitro in
RK13 rabbit kidney cells at 30C in 5% CO2, purified and
germinated by incubation in 0.3% H2O2 for 16 hours at
25°C. The germinated spores were concentrated by centrifugation suspended in 100 μg/ml Proteinase K-PBS and
incubated for 15 min at 65°C. DNA was extracted using
phenol-chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation.
DNA was then dissolved in TE buffer and stored at -70°C
until use. A sample of purified Brachiola algerae DNA was
amplified using Genomphi (Amersham) to produce 10 μg
of DNA and another sample of 1.7 μg of purified DNA
was processed directly to make two separate libraries.
DNA was sheared, blunt-ended and cloned as described
for E. aedis above. A respective 64,433 and 140,051 bases
from the Genomiphi and non-Genomiphi treated libraries were sequenced with ABI Big Dye 3.1. This gave a total
of 203,748 non-overlapping bases of sequence in 181
contigs with an average length of 1,125 bp.
Areas of six representative B. algerae clones from the
Genomiphi-amplified DNA library were reamplified by
PCR from genomic DNA to confirm that the Genomiphi
process had not amplified chimeric sequences. Primers
were designed to areas of 6 clones. These fragments were
between 525 and 1000 base pairs and included non-coding areas, putative transposases, transposons, proteincoding genes, and an SSU gene area.
Contigs were analysed by BlastX and BlastN to sequences
in GenBank. Open reading frames were considered significantly similar if E values were less than 0.00001. Contigs
were further searched for stretches of nucleotides coding
for sequences of at least 100 amino acids, and these were
considered ORFs.
New sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers ET437577–ET437812 and ET437979–
ET437981 (E. aedis) and ET223031–ET223211 (B. algerae).
