Abstract
Background: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contacts many brain regions and may mediate humoral signaling distinct from
synaptic neurotransmission. However, synthesis and transport mechanisms for such signaling are not defined. The
purpose of this study was to investigate whether human CSF contains discrete structures that may enable the regulation
of humoral transmission.
Methods: Lumbar CSF was collected prospectively from 17 participants: with no neurological or psychiatric disease,
with Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, or migraine; and ventricular CSF from two cognitively healthy participants
with long-standing shunts for congenital hydrocephalus. Cell-free CSF was subjected to ultracentrifugation to yield
supernatants and pellets that were examined by transmission electron microscopy, shotgun protein sequencing,
electrophoresis, western blotting, lipid analysis, enzymatic activity assay, and immuno-electron microscopy.
Results: Over 3,600 CSF proteins were identified from repeated shotgun sequencing of cell-free CSF from two
individuals with Alzheimer's disease: 25% of these proteins are normally present in membranes. Abundant nanometerscaled structures were observed in ultracentrifuged pellets of CSF from all 16 participants examined. The most common
structures included synaptic vesicle and exosome components in 30-200 nm spheres and irregular blobs. Much less
abundant nanostructures were present that derived from cellular debris. Nanostructure fractions had a unique
composition compared to CSF supernatant, richer in omega-3 and phosphoinositide lipids, active prostanoid enzymes,
and fibronectin.
Conclusion: Unique morphology and biochemistry features of abundant and discrete membrane-bound CSF
nanostructures are described. Prostaglandin H synthase activity, essential for prostanoid production and previously
unknown in CSF, is localized to nanospheres. Considering CSF bulk flow and its circulatory dynamics, we propose that
these nanostructures provide signaling mechanisms via volume transmission within the nervous system that are for
slower, more diffuse, and of longer duration than synaptic transmission.

Background
Physiological signaling via the CSF is not defined, but the
phylogeny of CSF suggests a fundamental role in non-synaptic transmission between brain regions [1,2] and many
aspects of neuroendocrine signaling in the choroid plexus
and CSF have been reviewed [2]. Three lines of evidence support such communication. First, diverse structures at the
CSF-contacting brain surfaces contain neurotransmitters,
neuropeptides, and biosynthetic enzymes [1], suggesting
components may be added to the CSF from its lining. Second, many signaling molecules (neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and enzymes) are in contact with CSF at sites that
are remote from their specific receptors [3], unlike the bettercharacterized spatial restriction of signaling molecules
within synapses. In the absence of an enclosed synapse and
facing the CSF spaces, these signaling molecules may diffuse
via CSF to specific receptors on the cell membranes that border the fluid. Third, functional effects can be invoked via CSF:
intracerebroventricular (icv) and intracisternal infusion of
sodium or neuropeptides effect appetite [4], drinking [5],
sleep [6], and pain perception [7]; and icv injection of βamyloid dimers inhibits long-term potentiation in the hippocampus [8].
In spite of accumulating evidence for non-synaptic transmission, it is not known how the biosynthesis and transport of signals are regulated within the circulating CSF.
For instance, neurotransmitters in solution would be rapidly inactivated, such as hydrolysis of acetylcholine by
acetylcholinesterase in the CSF. Moreover, integral membrane proteins may not function optimally in aqueous
CSF, such as the prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS)
required to synthesize the sleep-inducing prostaglandin
D2 [9]. The scope for signaling in CSF would, therefore, be
enhanced if defined structures could a) protect contents
from degradation; b) provide environments for hydrophobic constituents; c) localize enzyme activities; d)
mediate receptor recognition for activation at specific
locations; and e) be amenable for transport.
Here, we demonstrate that CSF consistently has a matrix
of membrane- and protein-rich nano-scaled structures
with many signal transduction components bounded by
lipid membranes. These structures include features of vesicles containing acetylcholine, large dense-core vesicles
(LDCVs), exosomes, and spherical structures with functional prostaglandin H synthases (PGHS) -1 & -2. People
in health and disease states have these structures that contribute to CSF heterogeneity, and provide unique transport and signaling capabilities throughout CSF-contacting
brain surfaces.

measured in cm CSF in the recumbent position. Two ventricular CSF samples (each of approximately 250 mL)
were collected by conventional external drainage (Becker
EDMS, Medtronic, Goleta, USA) at room temperature
over 24 h, with pressure measured continually in cm CSF,
referenced to the external auditory meatus.
Study participant selection and diagnostic criteria
Selection for lumbar samples was based on participants
that represent health, migraine, inflammatory, or degenerative brain disorders. Selection for ventricular samples
was based on participants that had received long-term
shunts for congenital hydrocephalus and had normal cognitive function. Normal (n = 3): no classifiable neurological or psychiatric disorder after detailed structured
interview and clinical assessment; Multiple sclerosis (n =
2): diagnosis of clinically definite multiple sclerosis based
on national criteria [11]; Alzheimer's disease (n = 3): clinically probable Alzheimer's disease, based on the national
criteria for the diagnosis of AD [12]; Migraine (n = 9):
migraine with/without aura, as per the International
Headache Classification [13]; Congenital hydrocephalus
(n = 2): Children with normal neurological and psychiatric development for either 5 or 11 years who had ventriculo-peritoneal shunts for congenital communicating
hydrocephalus; their CSF was collected after ventriculostomy with external drainage that was necessary to treat
acute appendicitis.

CSF preparation and storage
All CSF was prepared, aliquoted, and analyzed immediately or stored frozen within 1 h of collection. Table 1
indicates the clinical features of each sample and the analyses that were performed. Figure 1 illustrates the fractionation procedures: cells were first pelleted, P1, by
centrifugation for 3 min at 3,000 g. Cells in P1 were
counted on a chamber (Hausser Scientific Partnership,
Horsham, USA). Remaining S1s were aliquoted and store
in 1.1 mL aliquots at -80°C until use, or analyzed immediately (#s 12' & 13', Table 1). The CSF supernatant, S1,
was further centrifuged (modified from [14], Figure 1) for
15 min at 17,000 g. This yielded a second pellet, P2, and
the supernatant, S2, was centrifuged for 1 h at 200,000 g.
This supernatant, S3, was collected and the final pellet,
P3, was re-suspended in 50 μL isolation solution (250
mM sucrose, 10 mM triethanolamine, 0.5 mM PMSF, and
1 μM leupeptin) that had been passed through a 0.45 μm
filter.
Protein assay and trypsin digestion
Concentrations of total protein (in triplicate) were determined using a microplate-based Quant-iT protein assay
kit with BSA, 0-500 μg/mL as standard, as recommended
by the manufacturer. For all protein shotgun sequencing
(below), CSF fractions were denatured (6 M urea),
reduced, amidocarboxymethylated, washed with 100 mM
ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8), filtered on Viva Spin 500

nized with a linear gradient from 0 - 60% B over 180 min
at a flow rate of 220 nL/min (A = 0.1% formic acid in
water, B = 100% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid)
for separation of the peptide mixture on the 10 cm PicoFrit separation column. Peptides that eluted from the
reverse phase column were analyzed by a Finnigan LTQ™
linear ion trap mass spectrometer that was equipped with
a nano-electrospray ion source (both Thermo Fisher Scientific). Data-dependent mass spectral acquisition (MS/
MS) was enabled and allowed for the MS/MS analysis of
the most intense ion in the range of 450-1600 m/z (full
scan) with the following dynamic exclusion settings:
repeat count, 1; repeat duration, 0.5 min; exclusion duration, 3.0 min.

Protein shotgun sequencing of S1 fractions
Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LCMS)
was applied to the S1 of two different samples (#s 1 & 2,
Table 1) using the following LC and MS formats, repeated
15 times, to determine as many different CSF proteins as
possible.
A. Orthogonal 2-dimensional LC electrospray linear ion trap MS
System
This was performed using the Proteome X Linear Ion-Trap
System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The system was fitted
with a strong cation exchange column, SCX 320 μm ID ×
100 mm (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and two C18 reversedphase nanotrap columns: IntegraFrit Trap, 75 μm ID × 25
mm, Biobasic™ C18 followed by a PicoFritTM nanobore
HPLC column with a 15 μm i.d. pulled tip, 75 μm ID × 10
cm Biobasic™ (both from New Objective, Inc., Woburn,
USA). 100 μg of S1 protein digest was injected onto the
SCX column and peptides were eluted onto a nanotrap
column by successively injecting 20 μl of NH4Cl solution
with concentrations: 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 120, 150, 200,
400 and 800 mM. Each of the 11 salt steps was synchro-

B. 1-dimensional nano-LC electrospray ion trap MS
A modified version of the Pepfinder Kit with a Surveyor
HPLC, autosampler, and nanoflow solvent delivery
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to present the CSF
sample to an LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer equipped
with a nano-electrospray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 30 μm PicoTip emitter (New Objective,
Woburn, USA). The Pepfinder kit was modified from its
original form to contain a 5 × 0.3 mm Zorbax™ C-18 peptide trap (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) or a
0.075 × 25 mm Biobasic C18 IntegraFrit Trap combined
with a 100 μm ID × 25 cm BioBasic 18 nanobore C-18
separation column (both from New Objective). 1 - 4 μg of
CSF S1 protein digest was injected onto the trap, washed,
and then eluted onto and through the C-18 column with
a pseudo-exponential gradient profile, from 0-80% B in
~4 hr in following gradient increments; 0.1%/min in 50
min, 0.2%/min for 50 min, 0.25%/min for 40 min,
0.33%/min for 60 min, 0.44%/min for 45 min and 4%/
min for 5 min (A = 0.1% formic acid, B = 0.1% formic acid
in acetonitrile). The mass spectrometer was operated in a
data-dependent MS/MS mode and dynamic exclusion was
enabled. Gas-phase fractionation with three distinct scan
ranges (450-600 m/z, 650-900 m/z, 900-1600 m/z) was
used to maximize the number of peptides identified as
described [15]. The number of MS/MS scans varied with
the scan range: 1 MS + 10 MS/MS for 450-600 m/z; 1 MS
+ 8 MS/MS for 650-900 m/z; 1 MS + 4 MS/MS for 9001600 m/z. These experiments were repeated 15 times over
18 months with CSF samples # 1 & 2 (Table 1), using
increasing amounts of protein digest. Amounts injected
varied from 1.3 to 400 μg for each analysis.

MS/MS spectra obtained from these LCMS analysis of the
S1 protein digests of sample #s 1 & 2 (Table 1) were
searched against a Swiss Prot database (release 7459)
using the SEQUEST® algorithm [16] implemented in BioWorks™ 3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Trypsin enzyme
with potentially 2 missed cleavages was specified as a
search parameter. Protein identification was dependent

upon Xcorr score fit. Protein matches were identified
using strict Washburn criteria, based on the charge of the
precursor peptide ion and the Xcorr assigned by Bioworks
software. These criteria (z = +3, Xcorr > 3.75; z = +2, Xcorr
> 2.1; and z = +1, Xcorr > 1.8) [17,18] allow for the greatest confidence in correct peptide sequence assignment
within a single sample run. The list of matched peptides
was then further evaluated using the Request/Unified
scoring in Bioworks with a value of 2400 as the cut-off filter [19]. Additionally, the data were validated with a probability-based algorithm that calculates a statistical
expectation value (SE-1) of database peptide matches
based on the DeNovoX™ peptide sequencing pre-integration algorithm in a pre-release version of Bioworks 3.3.
Peptides with a SE-1 of > 10-5 were accepted for protein
analysis. Post-translational modifications were assessed
using a fully automated, de novo sequencing software program, DeNovoX (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A comprehensive list of non-redundant proteins was generated
from all analysis runs (n = 15), using Excel sorting and
Pivot Table functions. Results were compared to existing
identifications [20] and subdivided by the gene ontology
(GO) class of components.
High mass accuracy shotgun protein sequencing of S3s and
P3s
Analysis of trypsin digests of CSF by high mass accuracy
was essentially as described above, to get the best sensitivity from samples that were available in limited quantity.
For these studies, instead of S1 samples, S3 and P3 from
sample #s 3 & 3' (Table 1) were analyzed using an LTQ-FT
mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the
supernatant (S3) 60 μg of protein digest was directly
injected into a 0.5 μL guard C18 cartridge (LC-Packings,
Sunnyvale, USA) and separated on Biobasic C18, 10 cm ×
75 μm ID with a 3 h exponential gradient (n = 2). Identical analysis conditions were used for the protein digests
from pellets (P3) using 4 μg of sample (n = 3).

MS/MS spectra of the S3 & P3 protein digests of samples 3
& 3' were searched against an NCBI 25H-sapiens database
(71932 entries) with Bioworks 3.2 in full tryptic and semitryptic search mode using the Sequest algorithm implementation of SORCERER (SAGE- N Research, San Jose,
USA). For unit resolution data, a precursor tolerance of
2Da was used, while 100 ppm tolerance was applied for
high mass accuracy data. Positive identifications were
established using the probability calculations in Bioworks
3.2, with a statistical expectation of > 10E-5. Results from
tryptic and semi-tryptic searches were combined and filtered after export into Excel. A comprehensive list of nonredundant proteins was generated from all analysis runs
(n = 6) using Excel sort and Pivot Table functions. Results
were compared to existing identifications [20].

Electron microscopy of filtered CSF particles
S1 samples (1.5 mL) from #s 1, 2, 5, & 6 (Table 1) were
centrifuged through 0.45 μm ultrafilters at 10,000 rpm.
Gluteraldehyde (3%, 100 μL) was added for 1 hr,
removed, and the filters washed with PBS, air-dried, and
stained with 2% uranyl acetate followed by Reynolds' lead
citrate. PBS replaced CSF for negative controls. Filters were
then embedded in EPON 812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, USA) and cut on an Ultramicrotome UCT
(LKB Instruments, Inc., Gaithersburg, USA). Sections were
viewed on a Morgagni 268D transmission electron microscope (TEM; FEI, Hillsboro, USA) and images were
recorded on a digital camera, Mega View II, visualized
with Soft Imaging Systems and AnalySIS 3.0 software
(Soft Imaging Systems, Münster, Germany).
TEM of S1, S3, and P3 CSF fractions from all participant
sample #s 4-19
All procedures were performed in covered Petri dishes to
prevent contamination. Negative controls were composed
of isolation solution processed without added CSF fractions. Samples were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and
grids were floated on the sample, washed in PBS then
H2O, negatively stained in 0.5% uranyl acetate, dried, and
examined in the Morgagni 268D TEM. To estimate the
number of nanospheres in CSF P3s, nanospheres per grid
were counted on 10 occasions from 1 μL of 1:1 diluted P3
suspensions.
Electrophoresis, western blotting, and Immunostaining
Samples from at least four different participants from #s 4,
6-12, 14-16 (Table 1) were randomly evaluated for each
procedure or antibody. S1, S3, P2, or P3 fractions were
applied in the same amount of total protein per well on 420% Tris-HCl gels, transferred to PVDF, and total proteins
were visualized with colloidal gold. Specific antigens were
visualized after immunolabeling with primary antibodies,
followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary
antibodies, and NBT/BCIP detection. Species-specific preimmune serum was substituted in place of primary antibodies as negative controls. Dry blots were digitized and
band intensities quantified on UN-SCAN-IT 6.1 software
(Silk Scientific Corporation, Orem, USA).
Immuno-TEM (iTEM)
P3 samples of at least four participants per antibody were
tested, randomly selected from #s 4-19 (Table 1). P3 suspensions were mixed 1:1 with 4% paraformaldehyde on
which the grid was floated, washed in PBS, 0.05 M glycine,
and PBS, and exposed to primary antibody (usually
diluted 100-fold). Negative controls had species-specific
pre-immune sera substituted for primary antibody. Grids
were washed in PBS, exposed to 1:40 dilution of 6 or 12
nm gold-conjugated secondary antibody, washed in PBS

and H2O, stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate, air-dried, and
visualized as per TEM.
Lipid extraction and liquid chromatography of sample #s
14-17
Lipids were extracted from S3 fluids and P3 pellets using
the method of Bligh Dyer [21]. After removal of the
organic chloroform layer using a stream of N2, lipids were
suspended in 100 μl sample solvent (chloroform/methanol/water, 7:3:0.5 v/v/v) then eluted through a silica column with a chloroform/methanol/water/ammonium
hydroxide gradient [22]. The elution profile for lipids was
in the order: ceramides (CM), cerebroside sulfates (CS),
phosphatidylglycerol (PG), PE, PI, PS, phosphatidic acid
(PA), PC, sphingomyelin (SPM), platelet-activating factor
(PAF) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC).
Mass spectrometry of lipids of sample #s 14-17
Precursor ion scans (PIS) and neutral ion loss (NIL) for
different lipids were obtained using a full scan MS infusion experiment on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, TSQ Quantum (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at
a spray voltage of 4500 V, sheath gas pressure of 40 units,
auxiliary gas pressure of 0, capillary temperature of 225°C
and collision pressure of 1.5 units. Negative ions were
acquired in the profile mode with 13 different scan events
after collision induced dissociation (20-24 V) of deprotonated precursor ions or the neutral loss of specific groups
from lipids. Negative PIS of 196.3 (mass range 650-950),
171.14 (mass range 600-900), 240.96 (mass range 7501200), 168.17 (mass range 600-900) were used to monitor PE, PG/PA, PI and SPM, respectively. Negative NIL of
86.99 (mass range 650-900) and 50.13 (mass range 4001000) were used to monitor PS and PC/LPC/PAF, respectively. Lipids containing eicosanpentanoeate (EPA, m/z =
301.24), arachidonate (AA, m/z = 303.15) and docosahexaenoate (DHA, m/z = 327.22) were detected using PIS
of these ions in a mass range from 600-1200. Peak intensities were integrated, processed, and mole quantities
determined using ICIS and Xcalibur software (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Mole quantities were determined from
standard curves obtained using known amounts of lipid
standards (0-400 ng).
PLA2 digestions of sample #s 14-17
P3 samples were incubated with PLA2 at 37°C overnight
in reaction buffer. The same incubation was carried out
with heat-denatured enzyme, controls without enzyme.
Reaction products were stored at 4°C until assayed either
by LCMS or TEM with negative staining as described
above.
PGHS activity assay of sample #s 18 & 19
All assay components were pre-equilibrated to the room
temperature except for the PGHS-2 Standard that was kept

on ice. Detection was based on measuring the peroxidase
activity of cyclooxygenase by colorimetrically monitoring
the appearance of oxidized N, N, N', N'-tetramethyl-pphenylenediamine at 595 nm in 96 well plates. Either
Dup-697 (PGHS-2 inhibitor) or SC-560 (PGHS-1 inhibitor) was added to inhibitor wells and both inhibitors were
added into background wells. Standard, samples, and
backgrounds were analyzed in duplicates. The plate was
carefully shaken and after 5 min of incubation at room
temperature, absorbance was read on the Vmax kinetic
microplate reader at 595 nm (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). PGHS activity (nmol/min/mg protein) was calculated as described by the kit manufacturer (Cayman
Chemical, Ann Arbor, USA).

Results
CSF quality
Pressure was normal at all lumbar (<150 cm) and ventricular (< 15 cm) CSF collections. All fluids were clear,
with < 5 white blood cells per mL, and no red blood cells
were seen. All samples had total protein content within
the normal range of 0.1 - 0.5 g/L.
CSF protein composition
Using sample #s 1 & 2 (Table 1), we identified with high
confidence 2,390 and 3,649 proteins in the S1s from two
Alzheimer's disease participants, respectively, by repeated
LCMS shotgun protein sequencing (Figure 2, and additional file 1). These lists have similar overall protein categories to those already identified [23]. In this paper, we
highlight the GO category of components (Figure 2)
revealing that one quarter of CSF proteins we identified
are normally resident in membranes.
Morphology of CSF nanostructures
Using sample #s 4-19 (Table 1), to isolate any membranous structures in CSF, we examined the ultra-filters of the
S1s from four study participants by TEM. In all cases, we
found sub-cellular particles embedded in the surface of
the filter (Figure 3) similar to those reported by Agnew
and colleagues [24]. Since this preparation renders it difficult to assess morphology and biochemistry, we fractionated the S1s (Figure 1) by ultracentrifugation [14],
collected the final supernatant (S3), and re-suspended the
final P3 pellets from 16 people diagnosed as either
healthy controls or people with migraine, multiple sclerosis, or Alzheimer's disease. The P3s contained 10 (+/- 10)
ng of total protein per mL of CSF.

P3s from all 16 subjects had abundant, negatively stained
structures (Figure 4) that were almost absent from S3.
There was no difference in the observed structures when
we prepared S3/P3 fractions freshly from two participants
(sample #s 12 & 13, Table 1) as compared to preparations
from their S1 samples that had been stored at -80°C for

12 months. The most common structure was roughly
spherical with a mean diameter of 50 nm, ranging
between 30-200 nm (Figure 4A-F). We estimated the
number of nanospheres between 106 and 109 per mL of

CSF, and their morphology was similar to that of synaptic
vesicles and exosomes. Some spherical forms were more
electron-dense (Figure 4D-F), similar in appearance to
LDCVs [25].
Other frequent structure types included irregular-shaped,
non-circular, electron-dense blobs (upward-pointing
arrows, Figure 4G) and strands (downward-pointing
arrow, Figure 4G). The irregularity of the blobs suggests
they represent degraded electron-dense spheres, soluble
N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion attachment protein
receptor (SNARE) complexes [26], or some other non-specific debris. The strands resembled long-distance membranous nanotubes [27]. Both blob- and strand-like particles
were between 30 and 200 nm, and were enriched in P3
compared to S3. The frequency of the blob- and strandlike particles varied considerably between samples, but
sample numbers were too small to distinguish reliable
trends for specific brain conditions.

To investigate which proteins differ between P3 and S3,
we performed LCMS experiments using lumbar CSF sampled on two separate occasions from the same person,
diagnosed with migraine (sample #s 3 and 3', Table 1).
We found that while the protein GO categorized components are consistent for each replicate of P3 and S3, we see
distinct differences (Figure 6, additional file 2). More
organelle-based and filament/tubule/"other" GO category
proteins and fewer extracellular proteins were present in
P3 than in S3. Moreover, the GO categories of S3 were

Protein composition of nanostructures
To screen the protein composition of the nanostructures,
we compared electrophoretic profiles of fractions from 11
people from sample #s 4, 6-12, 14-16 (Table 1). Figure 5
illustrates consistent changes in P3 proteins: Several protein bands were enriched (↑) while others were depleted
(↓) in P3 compared with S3 fractions; in contrast, protein
bands from S1 and S3 fractions had similar looking profiles. These data show that the protein composition of P3
differs from that of the supernatants S1 and S3.

similar to the extensive S1 studies: compare S3 in Figure 6
with the GO components in the larger S1 studies in
Figure 2.
To explore the sources of these structures, we considered
that the abundant spherical structures would come from
the choroid plexuses and the ependymal lining of the CSF,
and might be derived from similar-sized synaptic vesicles
[29], LDCVs [30], or exosomes [31], while the blob- and
strand-like structures may be derived from extracellular
matrix proteins [32]. Nerve terminals known to border
the CSF [1] could discharge synaptic vesicles and LDCVs
into the CSF. Neighboring cells could also discharge exosomes. While such processes have not been defined for
CSF, exosomes have been reported in urine [14], blood
[33], and brain extracellular fluid [34]. Accordingly, we
performed Western blot analysis on CSF fractions from
sample #s 4, 6-12, 14-16, using antibodies against proteins we have identified by LCMS. We used fractions from

randomly from the same 11 different participants, as for
electrophoresis. We found 13 proteins are enriched in P3s
(Figure 7). Seven proteins are significantly enriched in P3
(n = 3 or 4, p < 0.05, paired analysis), based on specific
staining at their predicted molecular weight: FINC, SNAP
23, PGHS-2, RALA, S5A2, ARL2, and SCG3. We also found
that semaphorin 4D, chromogranin A & B, and the known
SNARE complex proteins synaptotagmin, syntaxin, and
synaptobrevin were enriched in P3, but with insufficient
samples for statistical analysis.
Nanostructure protein and neurotransmitter localization
Since nanostructures are purified in P3 fractions, we performed iTEM to find whether the proteins identified on
western blots (Figure 7) localize to specific structures (Figure 8). Using P3s from sample #s 4-19 (Table 1), we tested
at least four different participant samples with each antibody: against PGHS-2 (Figure 8A), RALA (8B, D, H), ARL2
(8C), SNAP 23 (8E), and SCG3 (8F) specifically bound
the spherical structures. These structures did not stain
when the primary antibodies were replaced with preimmune sera. To explore whether neurotransmitters are
present, we found that anti-acetylcholine specifically
stained spheres 80-100 nm in diameter (Figure 8G). These

neity within the spheres, since only a proportion of them
on each grid region stained with each antibody. In the
case of PGHS-2, we only saw staining when two spheres
were beside each other (Figure 8A). In the case of acetylcholine we only saw staining of 80-100 nm diameter
spheres (Figure 8G), not of smaller ones (30-50 nm), in
keeping with a size-regulated subpopulation of neurotransmitter packages. Blob- and strand-like particles had
specific iTEM staining for SCG3 (Figure 8J), S5A2 (8K),

and FINC (8L &8M). FINC is one of the most abundant
molecules in P3 by western blot (Figure 7), and by the
number of peptide ions detected by mass spectrometry
(data not shown).

(Figure 4A-F) suggests a membrane perimeter. Since
membranes are composed mainly of lipids, we extracted

lipids from S3 and P3 fractions from sample #s 14-17 in
Table 1 with organic solvents and analyzed them by normal phase chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. We identified several lipid classes by LCMS and these
clearly differed between S3s and P3s, as illustrated by the
total ion current chromatograph (TIC, Figure 9A &9B),
including phospholipids (PE, PI, PS, PC, PG, PA) and
sphingolipids (CE, CB, and SPM). To evaluate whether we
could disrupt the apparent phospholipid membranes of
the nanostructures in P3, we incubated P3 with PLA2
(Naja mossambica). This depleted the major phospholipid

The omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid is decreased, AA: arachidonic acid. The ratio of omega-3/omega-6 is significantly higher
in P3 fractions (p = 0.0005).

Cerebrospinal Fluid Research 2009, 6:10

The presence of eicosanoid metabolic enzymes (see additional files 1 &2) and their substrates in P3 (Figure 9A
&9B) suggested that these abundant small spheres play
active metabolic roles. Accordingly, we identified omega6 PUFA (AA) and omega-3 PUFA (DHA and EPA) in the
phospholipid classes (Figure 9E - K). The ratio of omega3/omega-6 in S3 (1.17 ± 0.199, n = 4) was lower than in
P3 (6.2 ± 0.815, n = 4) (p = 0.0005).
Enzyme activity in nanostructures
To test whether CSF nanostructures have functional
enzymes, we selected the prostanoid pathway because our
protein and lipid studies showed both their enzymes and
substrates present in CSF. Furthermore, Hayaishi's group
demonstrated a physiological effect for prostaglandin D2
(PGD2) in the initiation of normal sleep, when it is
applied via the CSF selectively to the ventral rostral brainstem [9], and many studies have reported roles for prostaglandins within the brain [35-37]. However,
prostaglandin H2 (PGH2,) is an unstable intermediate in
PGD2synthesis, and its local synthesis by the integral
membrane protein PGHS is required for production of
downstream prostaglandins. We therefore assayed PGHS
activity in the CSF fractions.

We wanted to test PGHS activity from a large quantity of
CSF because PGHS-2 staining structures were infrequent
on iTEM (Figure 8A) and P3 western blots for PGHS-2
were faint (Figure 7). Accordingly, we used 90 mL of ventricular CSF from two patients with congenital hydrocephalus from sample #s 18 & 19 (both clinically stable, with
normal pressure and total protein, and free from infection). We tested fractions from each person separately and
in duplicate and found activity in S1 and P3 that was
reduced or absent in S3; inhibitor studies reveal that the
activity was from both PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 (Figure 10A).

Discussion
A variety of experiments, as outlined in the background,
support volume transmission between brain regions via
the CSF. However, there is little information about the
mechanisms by which such communications are regulated. A lack of structures to transport, protect, localize,
and eventually transduce signals at an appropriate receptor poses major restrictions on transmission within the
150 mL of fluid. We now report details of the morphology
and biochemistry of unique structures in CSF that have
the potential to overcome many, if not all, of these limitations.
CSF proteomic studies have recently revealed many proteins that are substantially different from those found in
plasma [23,38-41]. Our protein lists (see additional files
1 &2) are complementary to these in overall components,
and further illuminate CSF protein composition. We view

http://www.cerebrospinalfluidresearch.com/content/6/1/10

these data sets as valuable references to design experiments for the study of CSF proteins.
CSF membrane proteins
When classes of CSF protein components from published
data were compared based on GO component categories,
around 40% are membrane proteins [23]. Zougman and
colleagues suggest that this abundance of membrane protein identifications is the consequence of extensive protease actions that cleave fragments from proteins that are
embedded in membranes, and these fragments enter the
CSF [23]. An alternative explanation is that there are
abundant membranous structures in CSF. In this paper,
we concentrate on membrane proteins, since their large
percentage suggests the possibility that there are membranes within the CSF.
CSF lipid membrane bound nanostructures
Our TEM data demonstrates small particles on filtered
CSF. The presence of these nano-sized particles from filtration provides evidence that these structures are not
formed during the ultracentrifugation procedure. The
presence of identical nanostructures in CSF from two participants that were collected and prepared freshly as compared to stored CSF, demonstrates that the nanostructures
are not a product of sample storage.

Past reports of CSF sub-cellular structures have been interpreted as resulting from blebbing, apocrine secretion,
apoptosis events, or cellular debris [1,42-45] and have
limited biochemical characterization, though one extensive protein composition has been reported from CSF
ultracentrifuge preparations of mouse and human embryonic CSF [40]. Our ultracentrifugation preparations confirm that CSF has abundant structures between 30-200
nm in size that are enriched in P3 in all 16 samples tested.
Morphologically, the majority are nanospheres, the next
most abundant are irregular nanoblobs, and there is only
occasional nanodebris that most likely represent structures that have fractured from the CSF linings. Our data
are consistent with these earlier reports, but the enriched
nanostructure suspensions have enabled further morphological, protein, lipid, and enzyme characterizations. Our
observations that PLA2 caused dissolution of the TEM
nanostructures, and depleted major P3 phospholipids as
determined by LCMS, demonstrate that lipid membranes
enclose these spherical structures. These membranes provide an appropriate environment for some of the abundant transmembrane proteins found in our shotgun
sequencing experiments of CSF (Figure 2 and additional
files 1 &2).
Even though the numbers examined by TEM are limited to
16 persons, the presence of these nanostructures in CSF
from people without any brain disorder (healthy perPage 12 of 17

PGHS-1 & PGHS-2 specific activities are demonstrated in P3 and S1 versus S3 fractions, compared to baseline activities without

sons), persons with intermittent disability (migraine),
and persons with serious brain pathology of either an
inflammatory (multiple sclerosis) or degenerative disease
(Alzheimer's disease) suggests strongly that these structures are ubiquitous in CSF. Though the unknown functions of these nanostructures require much further study,
our data hints at multiple roles.
Nanostructure composition suggests functions
The different electrophoretic and western blots of P3s in
this nanostructure-rich fraction are evidence that the P3
fraction from CSF contains biochemically distinct components. The FINC immunostain is greatly enriched in P3
fractions that mainly contain the varied blobs and strands.
The known functions of FINC as an adhesive extracellular
molecule involved in neurite development [46] support
an important connective role for these nano-sized blobs
and strands within CSF. Acetylcholine and SNAP 23 are
present in spheres and, along with the SNARE complex
proteins synaptobrevin, synaptotagmin, and syntaxin
(Figure 7), these data provide evidence that synaptic vesicles and/or LDCVs exist in CSF. TEM images of SNARE
fusion proteins [47] reveal structures similar to the

smaller CSF blobs but, while we found SNARE complex
proteins are enriched in P3 fractions, further study is
needed to evaluate their role in CSF. Some spheres contain the exosome-associated protein RALA (Figures 8B, D,
H)[48], evidence that they may be exosomes. Some
spheres may represent synaptic vesicles and some LDCVs.
The LDCVs, with their cargoes of lipids, peptides, and proteins, may participate in receptor-mediated uptake, as is
known to occur in brain with β-amyloid [49]. Overall, the
functions of these different molecules suggest that structurally discrete spheres may have neurotransmission and
signal transduction/regulatory activities.
Our data (Figure 9) also show that P3 has unique lipids,
composed of more unsaturated PI, and more total omega3 than omega-6 PUFAs. The known functions (receptors,
neuroprotection, signaling molecules) of PUFAs in brain
[50] suggest that the P3-enriched PUFAs in the membranes of the spherical CSF structures have potential transport, neuroprotection, or signaling roles [51]. Increased
signaling PI lipids in spheres, along with GTPase-activating proteins such as Arl2, reflect the capacity for immediate activation of signal transduction and vesicle regulation

Cerebrospinal Fluid Research 2009, 6:10

[52]. Moreover, the greater prevalence of omega-3 PUFAs
in CSF nanostructures will help to buffer inflammatory
processes around the brain, since omega-3s are precursors
of anti-inflammatory, pro-resolving, signaling molecules
[51].
We have demonstrated that the critical enzymes (PGHS-1
& -2) for synthesis of the obligatory prostanoid intermediate, PGH2, are present (Figures 7 &8A) and active (Figure
10A) in CSF. PGHS 1 & 2 are the only integral membrane
proteins whose presence have been confirmed in these
nanostructures, thus it is premature to predict what proportion of the many other CSF membrane proteins are
intact and functional versus cleaved products [23]. We
have also identified structures of the prostanoid pathway
(Figure 10B). These range from phospholipids (characterized by LCMS, Figure 9A-K) and lipases, synthases, and
receptors (identified by LCMS, see additional files 1 &2).
This is the first data to demonstrate the ability to biosynthesize prostanoids within CSF, a capability that supports
a humoral role for these known lipid mediators, such as
that proposed for sleep [9]. Further research is needed to
establish the roles for these pathways in the CSF/brain system.
Membrane-bound nanospheres with acetylcholine provide potential protection from acetylcholinesterase in
CSF, thus enabling a humoral mode for vesicle neurotransmission via CSF. For example, topical acetylcholine
has been consistently shown to dilate cerebral vessels
[53], raising the possibility that the acetylcholine we identified in spheres, if protected from premature anticholinesterase inactivation, may influence cerebral
vasomotor tone.
Nanostructure abundance
For both healthy as well as those with brain disorders we
estimate, assuming production and turn over at the same
rate as the fluid, between 109 and 1012 nanospheres are
produced per day, comprised of 5 μg total protein. These
relatively small amounts of CSF nanostructures may have
physiological roles since the readily releasable synaptic
vesicle pool size ranges from as low as 5 to as many as
5,000 per single synapse, as reviewed by Südhof [54].
While the presence of biochemically active species in the
nanostructures is clear from our data, the lack of knowledge of their absolute amounts, or their production, turnover, metabolism, and clearance necessitates further
studies to determine their functions.
Nanostructure circulation (Figure 11)
Brain extracellular fluid is known to diffuse ions,
dopamine, proteins, and 35 nm particles [55,56] in spaces
up to 64 nm. These extracellular spaces are large enough
for the smaller nanostructures, but structures greater than
100 nm are more likely to be produced at the CSF walls,

rather than from within brain tissues. Considerable variations in CSF formation and flow velocities occur, depending on locations within the neuraxis. We estimate flow for
CSF nanostructures, based on the known CSF formation
rate approximating 0.4 mL per minute, and maximum
flow velocity in the 3rd ventricle of about 5 mm/sec
[57,58]. Figure 11 outlines a transport model for nanostructures formed in the 3rd ventricle to move to receptors
in the medial hypothalamic wall of the same ventricle. For
a simple circulation of pre-synthesized signal within this
small space, we estimate transmission speed will be in the
order of a second. At the other extreme, such as nanostructures originating in a ventricle, migrating to a more distant
subarachnoid location, and requiring signal synthesis, we
estimate speeds ranging from minutes to several hours,
since total CSF exchanges 3-5 times a day and is stagnant
in some regions [57,58]. Bulk flow of CSF nanostructures
thus generates a more dispersed signal delivery, of longer
duration. These varied transmission speeds are all slower
by orders of magnitude than synaptic transmission (milliseconds). Slower spatial and temporal signaling involving
CSF nanostructures may regulate brain behaviors known
to require slower, more gradual, and more sustained modulations, such as reported for sleep, appetite, mood, and
vasomotor regulation [4-7,53,59].

Conclusion
Human lumbar and ventricular CSF samples demonstrate
abundant membranous CSF structures, 30-200 nm in size
from both healthy and sick participants. Compared to the
supernatant, these structures have unique protein and
lipid compositions, contain acetylcholine, and have complete prostanoid pathways from membrane phospholipids to specific receptors. Variation in CSF nanostructures
may be informative in both health and disease studies,
but they require enrichment since they are diluted by
more abundant fluid components. We anticipate that further study of these biochemically and morphologically
unique CSF nanostructures will identify their roles in
modulating brain functions and dysfunctions.

Proposed transport model for CSF nanostructures around the 3rd ventricle, with CSF neuroanatomical relations
Figure 11
Proposed transport model for CSF nanostructures around the 3rd ventricle, with CSF neuroanatomical relations. A: Subarachnoid flow is directed from the pituitary fossa region, as indicated by arrows. The subarachnoid areas indicated for prostaglandin PGD and PGE receptors are quite discretely localized. CSF within the 3rd ventricle is separated by a
small amount of tissue from the subarachnoid CSF areas, but these fluid compartments are only contiguous through the foraminal exits of Luschka and Magendie over considerable distance via the cisterna magna and back over the subarachnoid spaces.
The boxed region in B is enlarged in C, which illustrates our proposal that nanospheres and nanoblobs (and the much less
common nanodebris) arise directly from the brain/choroid/CSF surface, circulate, and contact a remote brain region or
another nanostructure for signal transmission, probably regulated with specific receptor mechanisms.
