Abstract
Background: Gene expression regulation is still poorly documented in bacteria with highly reduced genomes.
Understanding the evolution and mechanisms underlying the regulation of gene transcription in Buchnera
aphidicola, the primary endosymbiont of aphids, is expected both to enhance our understanding of this
nutritionally based association and to provide an intriguing case-study of the evolution of gene expression
regulation in a reduced bacterial genome.
Results: A Bayesian predictor was defined to infer the B. aphidicola transcription units, which were further
validated using transcriptomic data and RT-PCR experiments. The characteristics of B. aphidicola predicted
transcription units (TUs) were analyzed in order to evaluate the impact of operon map organization on the
regulation of gene transcription.
On average, B. aphidicola TUs contain more genes than those of E. coli. The global layout of B. aphidicola operon
map was mainly shaped by the big reduction and the rearrangements events, which occurred at the early stage of
the symbiosis. Our analysis suggests that this operon map may evolve further only by small reorganizations around
the frontiers of B. aphidicola TUs, through promoter and/or terminator sequence modifications and/or by pseudogenization events. We also found that the need for specific transcription regulation exerts some pressure on gene
conservation, but not on gene assembling in the operon map in Buchnera. Our analysis of the TUs spacing pointed
out that a selection pressure is maintained on the length of the intergenic regions between divergent adjacent
gene pairs.
Conclusions: B. aphidicola can seemingly only evolve towards a more polycistronic operon map. This implies that
gene transcription regulation is probably subject to weak selection pressure in Buchnera conserving operons
composed of genes with unrelated functions.

Background
Understanding the regulation of gene expression necessitates deciphering how organisms sense their environment and respond to it. The topic is even more crucial
when looking at tight symbiotic interactions within
which partners maintain biochemical relationships shaping in a drastic way their genomes. Our study is focused
on Buchnera aphidicola, the primary endosymbiont of
aphids, and one of the most studied obligate intracellular bacteria of insects, and analyzes the evolution of the

regulation of gene expression in the context of intracellular symbiosis.
In prokaryotes, gene expression and gene regulation
are governed by diversified and highly evolving mechanisms [1]. In the free-living bacteria so far studied, genes
are under the combined control of several mechanisms
which can be enumerated following the flow of information from the gene structure to protein function: the
gene copy number, the susceptibility of a gene to be
transcribed (governed by the initiation transcription
rate, the elongation and termination efficiencies), the
composition of the transcription units (TUs), the stability and the degradation of the mRNA, the efficiency
with which the mRNA is translated (mainly the codon
usage), and the effect of post-translational modifications.
Prokaryotic TUs may contain either one (monocistronic)

or several (polycistronic) distinct juxtaposed genes, all
controlled by a common regulatory region and transcribed into one long mRNA molecule. Finally, more
general regulation mechanisms, such as chromosome
topology (e.g., chromosome supercoiling), have also been
reported to control global gene transcription physically
[2].
Until 10 years ago, it was thought that the control of
expression at the transcription initiation level was the
dominant form of regulation in prokaryotes, for obvious
reasons of efficiency and economy [1]. This assumption
seemed natural given the apparent simplicity of prokaryotic transcriptomes (the small proportion of non-coding sequences, and lack of introns and alternative
splicing). However, very recently, new technologies have
highlighted the complexity and dynamic nature of gene
regulation in prokaryotes (e.g., detection of sRNA, modulation of operon structures, antisense transcription) [3].
Our bacterial model, B. aphidicola, has a close phylogenetic relationship with the large-genome free-living
bacterium Escherichia coli; the B. aphidicola genome is
essentially an E. coli subset [4]. Since its association
with aphids began, about 150-200 MY ago [5,6], B. aphidicola has undergone major genomic modifications as a
result of its intracellular lifestyle: a major AT bias (70%
of the genome consists of AT bases); genome shrinkage
(B. aphidicola sequenced genomes range from 420 kb to
650 kb, while the last common ancestor shared with E.
coli had approximately 2 Mb); a rapid evolutionary rate
and lack of recombination [7-9].
Genomic analysis of B. aphidicola from the pea aphid,
Acyrthosiphon pisum (BAp), has revealed the absence of
genes encoding for the regulatory systems usually found
in E. coli and Proteobacteria [10]. Indeed, two-component regulatory systems are absent. In addition, only
two sigma factors are present in BAp: rpoD and rpoH.
None of the orthologous regulators of the operons that
encode the enzymes of the essential amino acids pathways in E. coli are present in B. aphidicola [10]. The
genes of B. aphidicola have no leader sequences, and
the bacterium does not use attenuation systems [10].
The genes encoding adenylate cyclase (cyaA) and the
AMPc receptor (crp) are also absent in BAp, indicating
that it can survive only on a glucose carbon source [10].
However, there is experimental evidence of gene expression regulation in Buchnera, since nutritional osmotic
stress or organ and embryonic stage specificities are
associated with differing gene expression profiles [11,12].
It is difficult to address the question of gene regulation in B. aphidicola, because of the impossibility of
direct experimentation on this un-culturable bacterium.
Promoter identification also seems to be compromised
by the strong AT-bias of the intergenic regions. In this
context, we decided to study the TUs of B. aphidicola,

Page 2 of 16

and the first part of our work was devoted to predicting
the TUs of B. aphidicola and its operon map (i.e., the
overall polycistronic TU layout as defined by Edwards
[13]).
The operon map is a highly dynamic structure, its
evolution is governed locally by sequence evolution
(base mutations), and more generally by genome rearrangements (e.g. inversions, transpositions, deletions,
insertions and duplications). Both processes affect not
only the genomic elements involved in gene expression
regulation, such as promoters and terminators, but also
the overall organization of these elements on the chromosome (gene order, proximity, strand, etc.).
The methods predicting the composition of TUs (i.e.
the genes each TU contains) are basically classifiers
(supervised or unsupervised) assigning the pairs of adjacent genes to either the intra-TU class, or the inter-TU
class. Most frequently, statistical approaches are used to
develop these classifiers. Several features of the adjacent
gene pairs, such as the intergenic distance, the conservation of gene pairs across multiple genomes, the functional similarity between adjacent genes, the
involvement of a given gene pair in the same biological
pathway or physical complex (e.g., protein-protein interaction), gene expression correlations and some other
features are used in the classification. Some of these
methods have been applied to all sequenced and annotated bacterial genomes, and their predicted collections
of TUs are stored in dedicated or general microbial
databases. We found the set of BAp TUs in three databases: BioCyc [14], DOOR [15] and MicrobesOnline
[16].
The TU prediction method used in the BioCyc database [17] uses intergenic distance, functional similarity,
metabolic network information and protein-protein network information to construct a log-likelihood table,
which was used to make TU predictions. The method
was trained on the E. coli data set. The DOOR method
[18] uses a data-mining classifier trained on E. coli and
Bacillus subtilis, including the intergenic distance,
neighborhood conservation across multiple genomes,
phylogenetic distance between adjacent genes, information from short DNA motifs, similarity score between
GO terms of gene pairs and the length ratio between a
pair of genes. Finally, MicrobesOnline [19] predictions
were made by an unsupervised approach using intergenic distance, neighborhood conservation, functional
similarity and the similarity of the gene codon adaptation index (CAI). As these three predictions were not
especially designed for B. aphidicola and only partially
overlap (see the Results section), we proposed a new set
of TUs for B. aphidicola, based on a Bayesian prediction, that we compared with the three already available
in the literature, and further validated experimentally.

In the second part of this study, we investigated the
characteristics of B. aphidicola TUs, and evaluated the
impact of operon map organization on the regulation of
gene transcription. We also tested the influence of TU
organization on coding sequence length dynamics during the evolution of the B. aphidicola lineage. Understanding the mechanisms of gene expression regulation
in B. aphidicola is of interest for two reasons: first, it
would provide a better understanding of the nutritionally based aphid - B. aphidicola association, and second,
it provides an intriguing case study of the evolution of
gene regulation in a reduced bacterial genome.

Methods
Data organization and training data set

For training our TU finder, a data set was constructed
using genomic and transcription unit information for E.
coli from the Regulon database [20,21]. Using the
nomenclature of Salgado et al. [22], we defined several
classes of pairs of adjacent genes as follows (summarized
in Additional File 1):
- if both genes of the pair belong to an experimentally identified transcription unit, the pair class was
designated “Same TU” (STU),
- if only one of the genes of the pair belong to an
experimentally determined TU, or if the genes have
opposite transcription directions, then the pair class
was designated “Different TU” (DTU);
- if both genes belong to a TU exclusively predicted
by computational methods, the pair class was designated “Not Known” (NK).
In RegulonDB, some overlapping polycistronic TUs
can be found, due to the presence of alternative promoters or alternative terminators. A pair of same-strand
adjacent genes was classified “STU”, if there was at least
one polycistronic TU containing this pair.
NK pairs were excluded from the training data set, as
well as the operon leader peptides. The polycistronic
TUs carrying leader peptides are not structurally representative of the polycistronic TU population in B. aphidicola, because they are normally involved in
transcription attenuation, a regulatory mechanism
absent in B. aphidicola [10]. In this way, we constructed
a training data set as similar as possible to the B. aphidicola model.
Features, feature selection and predictor construction
Intergenic distance

The intergenic distance is the number of base pairs separating two adjacent coding sequences, for overlapping
genes the intergenic distance is negative. This feature has
been shown to be critical in operon prediction [22], and to

Page 3 of 16

be the best single-feature predictor of E. coli operons [23].
Like Salgado et al. [22] and Romero et al. [17], we categorized the intergenic distance in 10-bp intervals.
Transcription Rho-independent terminators

Rho-independent terminators are genomic elements
which transient structure induces the stop of transcription by creating a loop within the mRNA extremity during the elongation step. Their sequence consists of a
GC-rich hairpin followed by a thymine residue enriched
sequence [24]. For both E. coli and B. aphidicola, we
used the terminators predicted by TransTermHP [25].
Configurations tested for the Bayesian predictor DisTer

We tested three models for our Bayesian TUs predictor
(DisTer). The features included in each model, and the
formula used to calculate the probability that a pair of
adjacent genes would be classified as STU are as follows:
(1) the intergenic distance and the presence of the terminator, assuming that these properties are
independent;
(2) the joint distribution of the intergenic distance and
the presence of the terminator;
(3) the joint distribution of the intergenic distance and
the TransTermHP score of the terminator.
The corresponding formulae are presented in the
Additional File 2. To estimate the prior probability that
a pair of adjacent genes would belong to the same TU,
we assumed that the number of genes in a TU follows a
geometric distribution, P(LTU = n) = P(STU pair)n-1 (1 P(STU pair)). This is the simplest statistical model. The
expected value of the distribution is 1/(1 - P(STU pair)),
so we calculated the P(STU pair) using the mean of
L TU − 1
= 0.53 (the density
L TU
curve is presented on Figure 1).
The class attributed is normally that with the greatest
estimated probability, and in our case, a gene pair could
thus have been classified as an STU when the p(STU|
pair properties) was >0.5, and as a DTU if it was ≤0.5.
However, instead of doing this, we looked for the most
discriminating value for the probability threshold,
regarding the model accuracy and its predictive value.
Probability threshold values between 0.05 and 1 were
tested using the entire training set in order to evaluate
the training data error rate, also known as the resubstitution error rate (here the same data set is used both to
train the predictor and to assess its performance). This
error rate is a good indicator of the uncertainty of the
classification rules (Figure 2, left and Additional File 3).
We used the sensitivity (the proportion of true STU
pairs correctly classified as STUs by our method) and
the specificity (the proportion of true DTUs correctly
classified as DTU by our method) in order to evaluate
the quality of the predictions.

N-1 gene pairs, and is then used to classify the gene
pair left out. We used the integral prediction made in
this way (N iterations) to evaluate the performance of
our model.
On the Figure 2 the nearest point to the left corner of
one curve (indicated by the arrow) is the point that
minimizes the sum of the squares of the proportions of
false predictions. For each model we considered that the
probability threshold corresponding to this point on the
curve gave the best performances. The best probability
threshold value for the resubstitution error rate and the
best probability threshold value for the model performances were not the same except for the second model
(the probability threshold values can be visualized on
Additional File 3). It is interesting to note that the second model predictor produced the best performances
except when the entire E. coli data set was used, which
was to be expected, since the third model divides the
data into more classes than the second one. Hence the
second model has the best predictive capability. Finally
the second model (using joint distribution of the intergenic distance and terminator presence) with a 0.5
threshold, represents a good compromise between the
resubstitution error rate (Se = 79% and Sp = 83%) and
performance (Se = 78% and Sp = 84%), and was therefore the one chosen to predict the B. aphidicola TUs.
All the calculations were performed using R 2.6.1 software [26].

both lineages using Vibrio cholerae (accession number
AE003852 and AE003853) as an outgroup. Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (CP000438) or Haemophilus influenzae
(L42023) were used when no orthologue could be found
in V. cholerae. As no gene duplication has occurred in
the B. aphidicola lineage since its divergence from E.
coli [4], we used the bidirectional best hit method to
identify the orthologues of B. aphidicola genes. Comparing the length of B. aphidicola genes to those of their E.
coli orthologues (Δ L_E.coli-L_Bu ) and of the outgroup
orthologue lengths (ΔL_Ext-L_Bu), we defined six classes:
(1) genes with the same length in B. aphidicola and E.
coli (ΔL_E. coli-L_Bu = 0); (2) genes which length increased
in the E. coli lineage (if |ΔL_Ext-L_Bu| < |ΔL_E. coli-L_Ext|
and ΔL_E. coli-L_Bu > 0); (3) genes which length decreased
in the E. coli lineage (if |ΔL_Ext-L_Bu| < |ΔL_E. coli-L_Ext|
and ΔL_E. coli-L_Bu < 0); (4) genes which length increased
in the B. aphidicola lineage (if |ΔL_Ext-L_Bu| > |ΔL_E. coliL_Ext | and Δ L_E. coli-L_Bu > 0); (5) genes which length
decreased in the B. aphidicola lineage (if |ΔL_Ext-L_Bu| >
|Δ L_E. coli-L_Ext | and Δ L_E. coli-L_Bu < 0); (6) genes for
which the lineage undergoing a length change could not
be identified (if |ΔL_Ext-L_Bu| = |ΔL_E. coli-L_Ext| and ΔL_E.
coli-L_Bu ≠ 0).
Experimental validation of Buchnera TUs

B. aphidicola TUs were experimentally validated using
the protocol devised by Charaniya et al. [27].
B. aphidicola cells were purified from about 900 mg of
aphids, using the procedure described in Charles et al.
[28]. Total gDNA was extracted using the QIAamp
DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Helden, Germany). The gDNA
was used for tuning the PCR conditions, and as positive
control for the RT-PCR reactions. Total RNA was isolated and purified with RNeasy kit (Qiagen) as described
by Calevro et al. [29]. Purity and RNA integrity were
evaluated by NanoDrop® determination of the absorbance at 230 nm, 260 nm and 280 nm, and by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis respectively (data not
shown). The total RNA was then treated with Turbo
DNA-free™ DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). The
reverse transcription was performed from 1 μg RNA,
using random hexamers and SuperScript™ III, according
to the SuperScript™ First-Strand Synthesis system kit for
the RT-PCR kit protocol (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). The
addition of 1 μl RNase H at the end of the reverse transcription, combined with incubation for 20 minutes at
37°C, eliminated all the RNA initially present in the
solution. Two microliters from the reverse transcription
reaction were used for each of the subsequent RT-PCR
reactions. Specific oligo primers were designed for each
product (gene pair) with the Oligo 6 software (Molecular Biology Insight, Inc). cDNA from the total RNA was
used as template for the PCR reaction. A negative

Page 5 of 16

control was run without adding the reverse transcriptase
enzyme, and a positive control was run on genomic
DNA (gDNA). PCR reactions were performed using the
AccuPrime™ Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity kit
(Invitrogen), adapted to amplify DNA fragments up to
20 kbp. The PCR conditions were as follows: 30 sec of
initial denaturing at 94°C, 36 amplification-denaturing
cycles lasting 30 sec at 94°C, annealing for 30 sec at 47°
C or 43.5°C, depending on the melting temperature of
the primers, and extension at 68°C, for 2 to 5 min,
depending on the amplicon length. The total reaction
volume was 50 μl, and 10 μl of this mix were analyzed
on 1% agarose gel stained with Ethidium Bromide. 17
pairs of genes were also tested with 26 amplificationdenaturing cycles.

Results
Buchnera operon map

The entire B. aphidicola genome is arranged into 443
adjacent genes pairs having the same strand orientation,
and 167 pairs of adjacent genes with the opposite strand
orientation. Our prediction (DisTer) was run on the 443
adjacent gene-pairs, and the results were compared to
the predictions available in the literature for B. aphidicola (Figure 3). The DisTer prediction differed significantly from each of the other predictions.
MicrobesOnline was closest to the DisTer prediction,
but even these two methods disagreed on the classification of 99 out of the 443 same-strand pairs (Figure 3).
We therefore propose a new operon map of the B.
aphidicola genome, containing the 133 predicted polycistronic TUs out of the 288 found in the B. aphidicola
genome (155 are monocistronic). The list of the 288
TUs of B. aphidicola is presented in the Additional File
4. The average length (number of genes) of the predicted B. aphidicola TUs is 2.12 (1.63 in E. coli),
whereas the average length of its polycistronic TUs is of
3.43 genes (3.17 in E. coli). On average, B. aphidicola
TUs contain more genes than those of E. coli, and the
TU length distribution of B. aphidicola is significantly
shifted to the right when compared to that in E. coli
(Wilcoxon test, p-value ≈ 10-9, Figure 1).
Experimental validation of the Buchnera operon map
using microarray data

In order to compare the four predicted collections of
TUs of B. aphidicola (DisTer, MicrobesOnline, DOOR
and BioCyc), we used gene expression data obtained by
Reymond et al. [12], and we made the assumption that
the variability of gene expression for the STU (Same
Transcription Unit, see the Methods section) pairs
would be lower than that of the DTU (Different Transcription Unit) pairs. The comparison was carried out
after excluding monocistronic TUs, and using one-way

F-value was calculated. The non-parametric p-value is
the proportion of the simulated F-values that are higher
than the observed F. Although all four methods gave
significant p-values, the lowest value was obtained with
DisTer (Table 1).

To confirm the co-transcription of the genes predicted
within STU pairs (i.e., the presence of the polycistronic
mRNA), RT-PCR reactions were performed for some
gene pairs using primers that amplify across their intergenic region. Each amplicon contained the intergenic
region of the tested pair, and at least 300 bp of the
flanking regions located upstream and downstream of
this intergenic region. In order to verify if our technique
allows distinguishing between STU and DTU gene pairs,
we used two positive controls (Figure 4, PC-pairs) and 4
negative controls (Figure 4, NC-pairs). The positive controls were chosen among the gene pairs of the operon
trpABCD, which had previously validated by Bauman et
al. [30]. The negative controls were chosen among the
convergent and divergent pairs of B. aphidicola (3 divergent and one convergent pair). The products corresponding to the positive control pairs were amplified by
RT-PCR, but not the products corresponding to the
negative control pairs. Thus this technique is appropriate for experimentally verifying the DisTer predictions.
We tested the predictions made for 31 gene pairs: 8
pairs predicted as STU solely by DisTer (Figure 4, apairs), 4 pairs predicted as STU by DisTer and only one
or two of the other methods (Figure 4, b-pairs), 9 pairs
that were predicted as STU by all the 4 methods (Figure
4, c-pairs) and finally, 10 pairs of adjacent genes predicted as DTUs pairs by DisTer (Figure 4, d-pairs).
Twenty-nine out of the 31 experimentally tested pairs
revealed a corresponding mRNA (Figure 4 and Additional File 5). Eight pairs out of the 10 pairs predicted
as DTUs pairs by DisTer, but also by the other methods,
(except the dnaX-ybaB pair) were amplified by RT-PCR.
This experimental result suggests that even if DisTer
predicts longer operon structures in Buchnera as compared to the 3 other predictors, the real Buchnera
operon map may by even more polycistronic.
We also detected the mRNA for the four following
long polycistronic TUs: atpBEFHAGDC, argCBGH,
trpABCD and leuSholAnadDsirA (Additional Files 6),
although we were not able to amplify the complete
mRNA from the atp operon (the longest), but only all
the contiguous overlapping fragments.

Figure 4 Experimental testing of B. aphidicola gene pair status (STU or DTUs), by RT-PCR amplification using specific primers (third
lane). For each gene pair amplification we used a positive control, in which gDNA was used instead of cDNA for the PCR reaction (first lane)
and a negative control, for which the reverse transcriptase was omitted from the RT reaction (second lane). The size (bp) of the amplicon is
shown below each gene pair. (a) gene pairs predicted as STU solely by DisTer; (b) gene pairs predicted as STU by DisTer with no consensual

[10,31,32]. However, so far we do not know enough to
reconstruct the ancestral TUs. In this situation, we used
the E. coli TUs as a benchmark in our study. E. coli
orthologues were identified for more than 95% of the
genes of B. aphidicola (with the exception of 3 orphan
genes, and 15 tRNAs with ambiguous orthologues),
which facilitated comparison of the two bacteria. Using
B. aphidicola TUs as the comparison start point for the
B. aphidicola/E. coli comparison, we defined five TU
types (identical, similar, split, merged and reorganized).
The compositions of these TUs are given in Table 2,
and schematized in the Additional File 7.
Identical TUs are B. aphidicola TUs with exact
orthologous replicates in E. coli. These identical TUs
have not been internally modified by genomic rearrangements or sequence evolution during the evolution of

these two lineages. There are 121 identical TUs, 99 of
which are monocistronic. The identical monocistronic
TUs are evenly distributed on the B. aphidicola chromosome, and 78% of them do not belong to a syntenic
fragment (a syntenic fragment designates a set of adjacent genes that have the same organization, order and
strand orientation in the two genomes); the remaining
22% are located within syntenic fragments, and 10 of
them form 5 pairs of adjacent syntenic TUs. The polycistronic identical TUs contain mainly genes coding for
enzymes (or enzyme subunits), ribosomal proteins or
ATP/GTP binding proteins.
Similar TUs are B. aphidicola TUs for which the
orthologous TUs replicates in E. coli are longer because
they include genes which have no orthologues in B.
aphidicola. Most of the similar TUs, like the identical

ones, are monocistronic (Table 2). Their orthologous
TUs in E. coli contain another 80 genes not found in
the B. aphidicola genome. In order to find out whether
an E. coli gene was present in the ancestor genome and
had been lost in B. aphidicola or acquired in the E. coli
lineage, we checked for the presence of this gene in the
common ancestor genome proposed by Silva et al. [32],
or alternatively, in V. cholerae, H. influenzae or P. aeruginosa. If it was found in any of these, we assumed that
the gene had been present in the ancestor genome, and
had been lost in the Buchnera lineage. Hence, 63 of
these 80 genes (79%) were found to have been lost in
the B. aphidicola lineage.
Thirty-eight similar TUs are monocistronic, 30 (80%)
of them do not belong to any syntenic fragment, which
means that, in addition to deletions in the B. aphidicola
lineage, there had also been genomic rearrangements,
which had changed the genomic context of the conserved genes, possibly in both lineages. Among the 16
polycistronic similar TUs, 6 have lost the first gene of
the TU (and so their ancestral promoter and regulation),
3 have lost their final gene(s), and 5 their internal gene
(s). The 2 remaining TUs have no adjacent losses. The
main mechanism by which similar TUs have appeared
in B. aphidicola is gene deletion, but local sequence
evolution is also important, e.g., there are polycistronic
similar TUs corresponding to ancestral TUs that have
lost their middle gene, which implies that selection pressure exerted on regulatory elements has preserved the
operon structure following elimination of the gene.
Split TUs are B. aphidicola TUs for which the orthologous TU replicates in E. coli are longer, including
genes with orthologues from other TUs in B. aphidicola.
It is striking that the B. aphidicola split TUs corresponding to fragments of the same E. coli TU remain
adjacent on the B. aphidicola chromosome. Seventeen
of the 23 genes belonging to these TUs in E. coli that
are not found in B. aphidicola have been lost in B. aphidicola lineage; among the other 6 genes, 2 (ygdK and
pheM) have been acquired in the E. coli lineage. The 4
remaining genes code for structural RNA, and their
orthology cannot be established unambiguously. Hence,
the split TU are clearly examples of TUs that have
evolved exclusively through local sequence evolution in
one or both lineages.
Merged TUs are B. aphidicola TUs for which orthologous genes in E. coli belong to several TUs, sometimes
accompanied by other genes with no orthologues in B.
aphidicola. By definition, there are no monocistronic
TUs in this class. Among the 64 merged TUs of B. aphidicola, only 18 correspond to adjacent TUs in E. coli (as
a result of border reorganization). Ninety-nine genes
belonging to E. coli merged TUs were not found in the
B. aphidicola genome, and 71 of these genes have also

Page 8 of 16

been lost in the B. aphidicola lineage. These merged
TUs are examples of TUs that have primarily been
shaped by genome rearrangements rather than by local
sequence evolution. The E. coli orthologues of 33 of the
64 merged TUs of B. aphidicola are not specifically
regulated in E. coli (i.e. constitutively transcribed in E.
coli).
Reorganized TUs are B. aphidicola TUs for which
the orthologous genes in E. coli belong to different TUs.
The difference between these reorganized TUs and
merged TUs is that the E. coli genes for which orthologues are not found in the orthologous reorganized TUs
in B. aphidicola, are found in another TU in the B.
aphidicola genome. Among the 30 genes belonging to
orthologous E. coli reorganized TUs and not found in B.
aphidicola, 27 have been lost from the B. aphidicola
lineage. Six of B. aphidicola reorganized TUs are composed of ancestral gene pairs (the ancestral pairs were
identified on the basis of their OperonDB score; ancestral pairs have scores of above 86%), and so have probably been reorganized in the E. coli lineage. The E. coli
orthologues of 7 of the 16 reorganized TUs are not
regulated by specific transcription factors in E. coli.
Buchnera operon map evolution - Local and general
dynamics

Among the 611 pairs of adjacent B. aphidicola genes,
320 pairs (formed by 441 genes) are ancestral pairs:
these are gene pairs that are either present in B. aphidicola and in E. coli (237), or in B. aphidicola and in
more distant bacteria (83). These ancestral pairs are
scattered around the chromosome, and tend to conglomerate on 68 fragments containing an average of 6.5
genes in B. aphidicola. Hence, the B. aphidicola genomic map is an alternation of ancestral fragments and
reorganized fragments (2.5 genes long in average).
Operon and genomic maps of Buchnera are shown in
Figure 5.
Among the 237 pairs present in both E. coli and B.
aphidicola, 188 (79.3%) are STU pairs; 15 (6.3%) are
DTU pairs, and 34 (14.4%) have opposite status in the
two lineages (Additional File 8). Hence, most of the
ancestral gene pairs conserved in both bacterial lineages
are STU pairs. The 188 ancestral gene-pairs are
included in TUs belonging to the various TU classes
defined above: 41 (21.8%) in identical TUs, 27 (14.4%)
in similar TUs, 22 (11.7%) in split TUs, 68 (36.2%) in
merged TUs and 30 (15.9%) in reorganized TUs.
The genes of the remaining 83 ancestral pairs (not
adjacent in E. coli) are part of TUs that result from
genomic rearrangements in the E. coli lineage, including
18 pairs belonging to TUs in E. coli which are clear
examples of gene insertion, since the genes of these 18
pairs belong to a same TU in the bacterium.

the orthologues in E. coli are also adjacent and belong to a single TU. The blocks are colored alternately in grey and green in order to make it
possible to distinguish between two adjacent blocks. The synteny map of Buchnera (versus E. coli) is not shown here; nevertheless the gene
color gives some insight into the multiple genomic rearrangements that have occurred since the lineages diverged.

Characteristics of Buchnera TUs
Intergenic distances

Promoters

Small-genome bacteria seem to contain a smaller proportion of regulatory elements than large-genome ones
[34,35]. However, we searched the consensus sequence
of the constitutive s70 promoter in the 500 bp upstream
of the coding sequence of each Buchnera gene, using
Bprom software, mentioned above. Contrarily to the
previous hypothesis of promoter losses in Buchnera
[31], we found significant joint -10 and -35 s70 motives
upstream of 98% of the Buchnera TUs. We also found
putative alternative promoters s70 promoters (i.e., promoters associated to inner genes of operons), but with a
significantly lower score of prediction (Additional File
10).
The significant difference between the convergent and
divergent intergenic distances we detected, also supports
the hypothesis that some specific constrained areas (that

Intergenic distance distribution in bacterial genomes
possessing polycistronic TUs generally shows a characteristic peak between -20 and +30 bp, suggesting that
operons are universally compact (apart from some cases
of complex operons using alternative promoters) [33]. B.
aphidicola is not an exception to this rule (Figure 6).
Nevertheless, the intergenic distance distribution of B.
aphidicola is different from that of E. coli (Wilcoxon
test, p-value = 0.05). Since the opposite strand distributions are similar (Wilcoxon test, p-value = 0.78), this
difference results from the comparison between the
same strand distributions (Wilcox test, p-value = 8*104
): a slight shift to the right is observed for B. aphidicola
(Figure 6). More precisely, B. aphidicola presents fewer
gene overlaps (negative distances), and more intergenic
distances ranging from 20 to 100 bp than E. coli. Moreover, B. aphidicola has fewer intergenic distances of
220-300 bp and, hence, shorter average intergenic distances (Chi2 test with Holm corrected p-values).
Among the 521 overlapping gene pairs in E. coli, only
28 (5%) are found in B. aphidicola, and 20 of them also
overlap in B. aphidicola. On the other hand, B. aphidicola has a significantly smaller intrinsic proportion of
overlapping adjacent gene pairs (6%) than E. coli (13%),
highlighting the fact that the process of overlapping
coding sequences has rarely occurred during the evolution of the B. aphidicola lineage. More generally, we
compared the “orthologous” intergenic distances
between E. coli, and B. aphidicola from Schizaphis graminum (BSg), B. aphidicola from Baizongia pistaciae
(BBp) and Acyrthosiphon pisum (BAp). I defined an

“orthologous” intergenic region as a region between two
adjacent genes in B. aphidicola that share adjacent
orthologues in the other strains of species (Figure 7).
The higher variability of the between-TU distances as
compared to that of the within-TU distances for the 3
B. aphidicola strains and E. coli indicates that some
additional constraints must be controlling the evolution
of the within-TU distance (Figure 7C and 7D).
As we have already mentioned, the intergenic distance
of opposite strand pairs are similar in B. aphidicola and
E. coli, even when convergent and divergent pairs are
considered separately. The pronounced differences existing between the convergent and divergent pair distances
(the divergent pair intergenic distances being longer
than the convergent ones) were found in both organisms (Figure 8 and Additional File 9).

the upstream region of some genes.
Terminators

The predicted terminators are located downstream of
the coding sequences. The distribution of the distance
between the stop codon and the predicted terminators
shows a peak at 13 bp for E. coli and at 26 bp for B.
aphidicola, with a general shift to the right of the distance distribution in B. aphidicola (Figure 9, Wilcoxon

test, p value ≈ 10-5). B. aphidicola terminators are also
less stable (i.e. the absolute value of the free energy of
their hairpins is lower) than E. coli (Figure 9, Wilcoxon
test, p value ≈ 10-16). We also analyzed the type of intergenic regions in which the terminators have been predicted (Table 3). There is a visible trend for the
terminators to be present in convergent intergenic
regions rather than in the same strand intergenic
regions. Indeed, the convergent intergenic regions

single terminator (bidirectional) is sufficient for the
transcription termination of two adjacent genes [36],
and of course, the terminators are not really necessary

evolutionary changes (see Methods section). Hence,
there are 122 genes out of 597 in B. aphidicola that
have the same length in E. coli. For the 412 remaining
B. aphidicola genes, the direction of change in length
evolution has been identified: 57 (66) were found to
have increased (or decreased) in the E. coli lineage, and
96 (193) were found to have increased (decreased) in
the B. aphidicola lineage. Hence, more of the B. aphidicola coding sequences have shortened during their evolution in the B. aphidicola lineage as compared to those
in the E. coli lineage, as previously reported by Charles
et al. [37].
A marked difference in evolutionary constraints was
observed between genes with longer or shorter sizes in
B. aphidicola than in E. coli (Figure 10, Kruskal-Wallis

size is evolving display a corresponding change in their
composition. The B. aphidicola genes that are shorter

distributions are represented: Ka distribution of Buchnera genes that
have the same length as their E. coli orthologues (blue), that are
shorter than their E. coli orthologues (red) and are longer than their
E. coli orthologues (black curve). The distributions shown in black
and red are significantly different from the one shown in blue.

following classes: either the coding sequence has
shrunk in the B. aphidicola lineage, or the coding
sequence has lengthened in the E. coli lineage. Based
on the calculation of Ka, it was not possible to detect
any difference between these two populations of genes
in the selection constraints. The same was observed
for B. aphidicola genes that are longer than their E.
coli orthologues (Additional File 11). Finally, no TUs
effect was observed on the evolution of the length of
the coding sequences.

Discussion
We have predicted a new operon map for BAp, which
contains 133 polycistronic TUs. The novelty of our prediction is that we used the presence of the transcription
terminators. More generally our prediction relies
entirely on structural criteria (using only the intergenic
distance and terminator presence), whereas the existing
predictions use functional similarity, metabolic activity
correlation and/or orthology information in addition to
the intergenic distance criterion. The functional clustering of genes on chromosome is one of the hypotheses
used to explain the origin of operons. Accordingly,
using the functional similarity of adjacent genes is a natural choice for TU prediction. However, this approach
might miss TUs created by genome reorganization and
which have led to more recent TUs composed of functionally unrelated genes (i.e., TUs from the merged class
and possibly some of the reorganized class). Indeed, our
method did detect some specific B. aphidicola polycistronic TUs, probably generated by the genomic rearrangements occurring during the early stages of symbiosis
establishment that are known to be characterized by
high genome dynamics, and assembling genes with no
functional similarities. It was reported that this kind of
polycistronic TUs are rapidly lost in free-living bacteria
[38]. In B. aphidicola, on the contrary, it seems that
such functionally unrelated TUs were further fixed as a
result of the loss of the recombination machinery during
the process of genome shrinkage [39,40]. We also
experimentally validated several of these polycistronic
TUs that were predicted exclusively by DisTer. This
supports our decision to use only structural features for
predicting operons.
The B. aphidicola operon map predicted by DisTer is
more compact that the other 3 available in the literature; it is also more compact than that of E. coli (Table
1). On average, each B. aphidicola TU contains 2.12
genes, whereas E. coli contains fewer genes per TU
(1.63), E. coli having a higher proportion of monocistronic TUs. Also, even though the DisTer predicted map is
the more compact, the real map may be even more
compact (as suggested by our predicted DTU pairs), due
to the originality of the B. aphidicola genome.

The predicted TUs correlate well with the predicted
s 70 promoters (Additional File 10) as well as with
expression data (i.e., the expression of genes within a
given TU is more similar than that of genes belonging
to two different TUs). Part of the gene expression correlation is probably explained solely by gene proximity;
however, the construction of our null hypothesis (Table
1) by shuffling TU-labels while preserving gene proximity reveals that the TU borders (i.e., gene promoters
and terminators) significantly partitioned gene expression in B. aphidicola. Moreover, for 15 TUs for which
there were contradictory predictions in the literature, we
have experimentally validated the presence of a polycistronic mRNA in B. aphidicola.
The experimental technique we used to verify the DisTer predictions was validated by using positive and
negative controls. The former were amplified by RTPCR while the later were not. All the gene pairs predicted as STU by DisTer (but not necessarily by the
other three methods) were amplified by RT-PCR. Surprisingly, only 2 out of the 10 predicted DTUs pairs
were experimentally confirmed as such, suggesting an
even more compact operon map. The lack of the prediction power concerning the other 8 pairs can be
explained by the fact that DisTer, and the 3 other predictors are trained on E. coli genome and/or used common traits of known bacterial operons that might not
reflect the overall characteristics of the Buchnera genome (AT bias, loss of recombination and intracellular
living).
Since the B. aphidicola genome is an E. coli subset, we
were able to compare the TUs of these two organisms
and shed light on the dynamics of TUs in both lineages,
thus revealing insights about operon map evolution.
Operon map changes must certainly have occurred as a
result of global reorganization (recombination, inversion,
translocation) at the level of the reorganized fragments,
but also inside the ancestral fragments (gene deletions)
or even at the borders between fragments (border reorganizations) as a result of local sequence evolution.
There are two types of operon map changes: modifications of the TU content, and the reordering of the TUs
on the map. The former type will necessarily have an
impact on gene regulation, as it will always result in a
change the co-transcribed gene sets, whereas the second
one may have a more fuzzy influence on gene transcription (e.g., the accessibility of the transcription machinery
to the TU may change), without necessarily altering
gene regulation (e.g., conserving the same promoter).
The B. aphidicola operon map seems to have been
reorganized initially by genome rearrangements: more
than 45% of the TUs were affected by these processes.
We also found that some changes had occurred in the
E. coli lineage, confirming that genome rearrangement is

Page 14 of 16

one of the most important processes in operon map
evolution.
The second way the operon map has evolved is related
to local sequence evolution, and more precisely to intergenic sequence evolution. Intergenic regions are known
to be evolving more rapidly than coding sequences.
These regions contain structural elements, such as promoters and terminators. Thus, the intergenic sequence
evolution acts at a very local level, and causes inter-TU
border fluctuations (e.g., the split TUs we mentioned
above).
These two generic evolutionary processes do not act
either independently, or sequentially, and the operon
maps we are studying result from their joint influence.
As a result, it is generally impossible to quantify the
contribution made by each process in the reorganization
of the operon map, except to say that no further rearrangements events are occurring in the B. aphidicola
genome, since it has lost the necessary elements. This
means that the operon map of B. aphidicola is solely
governed by local sequence evolution since its genome
has entered genomic stasis [40].
Moran et al. [41] showed recently that B. aphidicola
sequence evolution is not symmetrical, and its
sequences can only evolve towards shrinkage, since the
observed insertions are not bigger than a few bp, and
are mainly caused by polymerase slippage. However, it
does seem as if B. aphidicola can evolve only towards a
more polycistronic operon map, since disintegration of
the promoter and/or terminator will induce the formation of new polycistronic TUs or the extension of existing TUs, while the remaining polycistronic TUs remain
unaltered, unless one of their genes is gradually deleted
by a pseudogenization process. The number of merged
TUs and the number of genes they are assembling (231,
more than 30% of B. aphidicola genome) are consistent
with this hypothesis.
The B. aphidicola intergenic distance analysis (within
and between TUs) also sheds lights on some other
aspects of the B. aphidicola operon map. One finding is
that B. aphidicola coding sequences show less superimposition than E. coli coding sequences. The superimposed coding sequences are generally found in ancient
TUs favoring the coupling of the translation for the
genes within a same operon [38]. Hence, the recent
reorganization of the B. aphidicola operon map could
explain the lack of superimposition in the bacterial genome. Moreover, no specific superimpositions appeared
in B. aphidicola. One explanation is that B. aphidicola
might not be able to create new superimposed
sequences whether because of the strong AT bias preventing dual coding of both the 5’ and the 3’ end on different reading frames, whether because of the loss of
selective constraints on its genome compaction.

The B. aphidicola positive intergenic distances are
shorter on average than those of E. coli, although the
intergenic distances between adjacent genes with opposite strand directions are similar in E. coli and B. aphidicola. It is striking however to note that, as in E. coli,
convergent intergenic distances are shorter than divergent ones in B. aphidicola (Figure 8). An hypothetical
explanation for this phenomenon is that the divergent
intergenic regions constitute the physical support of two
promoters, and that they therefore need more space
than a convergent region, which is supposed to contain
only terminators [42]. The hypothesis of the degenerated
or inexistent promoters was proposed for the B. aphidicola model, but there are still some selection constraints
on the intergenic sequences length, which suggest that
there must be some structural genomic element that is
important for B. aphidicola gene transcription.
Finally, we investigated the impact of gene regulation
on operon map dynamics. For this purpose, we first studied the E. coli TUs containing at least one gene for
which an orthologue was found in the B. aphidicola
genome. Our results suggest that the assembly of the B.
aphidicola genes in TUs had not been constrained by
their ancestral specific regulation (as far as this can be
accessed from the specific regulation of their orthologues in E. coli). Indeed, similar TU distributions among
the 5 classes defined above were observed for B. aphidicola TUs including genes with orthologues which are
either regulated or un-regulated in E. coli, (Additional
File 12). Two hypotheses could explain this observation:
either most E. coli regulation mechanisms were established after the lineage divergence, or some E. coli specific regulations are ancestral in origin, but they did not
correspond to the demand for B. aphidicola regulation,
and so the operon map dynamics of this latter species
was not influenced by specific ancestral regulations. On
the other hand, a correlation was observed between
gene regulation in E. coli and gene conservation in B.
aphidicola, which was significantly greater (Additional
File 13, Chi-2 test, p-value = 0.008) if the genes
belonged to a regulated TU in E. coli (23%), than to a
non-regulated one (18%).

regulation should occur. The fact that the need for specific regulation of TUs exerts some pressure on gene
conservation and gene colocalization, but not on gene
assembly in the operon map, also supports this hypothesis of evolution of the operon map by genetic drift.
However, the work of Tamames et al. [43] on the modularity of the protein interaction network of B. aphidicola suggests selection constraints on its operon map
evolution. Indeed, the interactome in B. aphidicola is
highly diminished and proteins present very similar
interaction numbers. As a consequence of the need for
similar abundances, protein-coding genes should be
expressed at similar levels, which is possible by ensuring
their co-expression within operon structures. Functional
analyses, including proteomics and interactome reconstruction, would be needed to explore further the forces
driving the evolution of B. aphidicola operon map and
its gene-regulation network.

Conclusions
B. aphidicola seems to be evolving towards a map
enriched in polycistronic TUs. Some of these polycistronic TUs seem to be accidental, without any strong evolutionary value, and therefore passively maintained. This
observation is very important for understanding the
selection pressure exerted on B. aphidicola gene expression. The fact that co-expression is maintained, even
when it is unnecessary, suggests that in B. aphidicola
what is important is that gene expression should occur
(in a binary fashion) and not that the specifically tuned
