Abstract
Background: In an epitope-based vaccine setting, the use of conserved epitopes would be
expected to provide broader protection across multiple strains, or even species, than epitopes
derived from highly variable genome regions. Conversely, in a diagnostic and disease monitoring
setting, epitopes that are specific to a given pathogen strain, for example, can be used to monitor
responses to that particular infectious strain. In both cases, concrete information pertaining to the
degree of conservancy of the epitope(s) considered is crucial.
Results: To assist in the selection of epitopes with the desired degree of conservation, we have
developed a new tool to determine the variability of epitopes within a given set of protein
sequences. The tool was implemented as a component of the Immune Epitope Database and
Analysis Resources (IEDB), and is directly accessible at http://tools.immuneepitope.org/tools/
conservancy.
Conclusion: An epitope conservancy analysis tool was developed to analyze the variability or
conservation of epitopes. The tool is user friendly, and is expected to aid in the design of epitopebased vaccines and diagnostics.

Background
An epitope can be defined as a group of amino acids
derived from a protein antigen that interacts with antibodies or T-cell receptors, thereby activating an immune
response. Epitopes can be classified as either continuous
or discontinuous. Continuous epitopes, also known as
linear or sequential epitopes, are composed of amino acid
residues that are contiguous in their primary protein
sequence. Conversely, discontinuous epitopes, also
known as assembled or conformational epitopes, are

composed of amino acid residues that are typically
present in different protein regions, but which are brought
together by protein folding. Recognition of T cell epitopes
typically depends upon processing of antigenic proteins,
and as a result T cell epitopes are usually continuous. B
cell epitopes, often recognized in the native protein context, may be either continuous or discontinuous.
Pathogenic proteins, in general, and epitopes in particular, are often variable. The degree of variability or similar-

ity of specific proteins or protein regions can provide
important information regarding evolutionary, structural,
functional, and immunological correlates. Given a set of
homologous proteins, phylogenetic relationships can be
constructed and used to calculate the evolutionary rate at
each amino acid site. Regions that evolve slowly are considered "conserved" while those that evolve rapidly are
considered "variable". This approach is widely used in
sequence conservation identification and mapping programs such as ConSeq [1] and ConSurf [2,3]. However, to
fully describe and characterize protein and/or epitope variability, measures of identity and conservancy are typically
utilized. Identity refers to the extent to which two amino
acid sequences are invariant, and is measured as the percentage of identical amino acids in the alignment of two
sequences. Conservancy is defined as the fraction of protein sequences that contain the epitope considered at or
above a specified level of identity. Conversely, the fraction
of protein sequences that contain the epitope considered
below a specified level of identity reflects the degree of
variability or uniqueness of the epitope.
Amino acid residues that are crucial for retention of protein function are believed to be associated with intrinsically lower variability, even under immune pressure. As
such, these regions often represent good targets for the
development of epitope-based vaccines, as the epitopes
targeted can be expected to be present irrespective of disease stage, or particular strain of the pathogen. Furthermore, these same residues are often highly conserved
across different related species, such as, for example, has
been found in several instances in the context of the poxviridae [4]. As a result, a vaccine containing such conserved epitopes might be effective in providing broadspectrum protection. Conversely, in a diagnostic and disease monitoring setting, epitopes that are specific to a
given pathogen can be used to monitor responses to that
particular infectious strain, removing the confounding
influence of immune responses derived from previous
exposures to partially cross-reactive strains or organisms.
Herein, to assist in the selection of epitopes having a
desired level of conservation or, conversely, variability, we
have developed an epitope conservancy analysis tool. The
tool has been specifically designed to determine the
degree of conservation or variability associated with a specific epitope within a given set of protein sequences.
Despite our emphasis on epitope identification contexts,
it is also apparent that the tool can be utilized for other
purposes, such as tracking mutation of epitopes during
disease progression. This tool was implemented as a component of the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis
Resources (IEDB) [5-7] and was used in predicting the
cross-reactivity of influenza A epitopes [8].

Implementation
Approach
Given an epitope sequence e and a set P of protein
sequences {p}, our approach is to find the best local alignment(s) of e on each p. The degree of conservation of e
within P is calculated as the fraction of {p} that matched
the aligned e above a chosen identity level. Two separate
processes were developed for assessing the degree of conservation/variability of continuous and discontinuous
epitope sequences.
Continuous sequence
If e is continuous, the process of finding the best alignment of e on p involves breaking p in to sub-sequences {s}
of length equal to e and comparing e to each s. For a p
sequence of length n and an e sequence of length m, a
total n-m+1 {s} different sequences are generated. For
each e and s comparison, the degree of identity is calculated as a percent of residues that are identical between the
two sequences. If p contains repeat regions, or the identity
threshold is low, multiple alignments may be found for e.
However, the s sequence(s) associated with the maximum
identity score determines the alignment(s) of e on p. The
degree of conservation of e is then calculated as the percent of p sequences in which e is aligned with an identity
level at or above a chosen threshold. Conversely, the
degree of variability is calculated as the fraction of p that e
was aligned below a chosen threshold. An illustrative conservancy analysis of a continuous epitope sequence is
shown in Table 1.
Discontinuous sequence
If e is discontinuous, a continuous sequence pattern c is
first generated. For example, given a discontinuous
sequence "A1, B3, C6" (meaning A is at position 1, B is at
position 3 and C is at position 6), its matching sequence
pattern c is AXBXXC where X is any amino acid residue,
and the number of X's between two nearest known amino
acid residues is equal to the gap distance between them.
Next, the same procedure described for continuous
sequences is used to identify the best alignment(s) of c on
p. The identity level is calculated based on the defined
epitope residues. An illustration of a discontinuous
sequence conservancy analysis is shown in Table 2. To
obtain meaningful results, the program only performs calculations for discontinuous sequences consisting of at
least three identified residues.
Program description
The epitope conservancy analysis tool was implemented
as a Java web-application. An overview of the tool is
shown in Figure 1. As input, the program requires the user
to provide an epitope set, consisting of one or more
epitope sequences, and a set of protein sequences against
which each epitope is compared to determine conserv-

it is recommended that the protein sequence set utilized
be constructed such that redundancies are eliminated and
the representation of different substrains and serotypes is
balanced. To assist in assembling protein sequence sets, a
"Browse for sequences in NCBI" link is provided. When
this link is selected, a browser is opened, enabling the user
to search for all available protein sequences in NCBI,
grouped by organism taxonomic level. To reduce redundancies in the protein sequence set, the user can check the

box at the bottom of the input form to have the program
automatically remove all duplicated sequences in the protein data set used in the analysis. As output, the program
will calculate the fraction of protein sequences that match
each epitope sequence above or below a given identity
level. The program also calculates the minimum and maximum matching identity level for each epitope. A position

sequence mappings of an epitope to all protein sequences
in a dataset are also generated. In some cases, if a protein
sequence has significant repeat regions, or the level of
matching identity is set at a low value, multiple matching
protein sub-fragments can be found for a given epitope
sequence. All calculation results can be downloaded as

Results and discussion
To determine the degree of conservation of an epitope
within a given set of protein sequences, it is necessary to
align the epitope to each protein sequence. The degree of
conservation is then calculated as the fraction of protein
sequences that match the aligned epitope sequence above
a defined identity level. Conversely, the degree of variablity is calculated as the fraction of protein sequences that
match the aligned epitope sequence below a defined identity level. For continuous epitopes, existing sequence
searching and alignment tools, such as BLAST [9] or Clus-

talW [10], can be used to perform pair-wise local alignment of the epitope to a protein sequence. But, to be
relevant in an immunological context, it is crucial that the
entire epitope sequence is completely aligned with absolutely no gaps. This requirement entails the use of somewhat different parameters making it cumbersome to use
currently existing alignment tools for the characterization
of immune epitopes. At the same time, there is no alignment tool currently available for analyzing discontinuous
sequences. To rectify these shortcomings, we have developed a robust, user-friendly, epitope conservancy analysis
tool. The tool has the capacity to simultaneously align and
assess the degree of conservation/variability of each
epitope, and can perform these functions for both linear
and discontinuous peptide epitope sequences.
For the purpose of developing cross-reactive vaccines that
aim toward highly variable pathogens, the use of conserved epitopes across different species is desired. Nevertheless, care should be taken to avoid selecting epitopes

that are conserved between the pathogen and the host as
this could lead to undesirable induction of auto-immunity. Moreover, extremely conserved epitopes between
species are sometimes less immunogenic because they
may be derived from proteins that resemble similar proteins in the host. As a result, they are less likely to be recognized by T cells due to self-tolerance. It should also be
emphasized that conservation at the sequence level does
not assure that the epitope will be equally recognized and
cross-reactive. This is due to the differences in the antigen
sequences from which the epitope is derived. For T cell
epitopes, whether they will be processed in the first place
is determined by flanking residues that are different for
different antigens. Therefore, the same epitope sequence
from different antigens may or may not be generated to
subsequently presented and recognized by T cell receptors.

strains or isolates, it might be necessary to identify
epitopes that are highly conserved in only a single or just
a few isolates, and poorly conserved in others. Finally, the
analysis of potential homologies with sequences
expressed by a pathogen's host, or an animal species to be
used as an animal model, might be of particular relevance.
We anticipate that its relevance might range from predicting poor responses due to self-tolerance and differential
performance in animal species expressing different
degrees of similarities with a given epitope, to predicting
potential safety problems and autoreactivity linked to
cross-reactive self reactivity and molecular mimicry. For
each of these broad applications, the analysis tool we have
developed provides the means to easily assemble the protein sets required to undertake the appropriate analyses,
and generates the information necessary to make the
appropriate design decisions.

In the case of B cell epitopes, their recognition by an antibody is dependent on the antigen 3D structures. A
sequence-wise conserved epitope may not be structurally
conserved as it can adopt different conformations in the
context of the antigen structures. Exposed amino acids as
opposed to buried amino acids are more important in
determining the immunogenic of a given segment of peptide. It is because only exposed residues, as observed in
antigen:antibody co-crystals, can form contacts with the
complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the corresponding antibody. Those residues that are recognized
by a single antibody are often defined as a discontinuous
epitope. The epitope conservancy analysis tool developed
here can be used to assess the pattern conservation of discontinuous epitopes. Nevertheless, pattern-wise conserved discontinuous epitopes may not be cross-reactive
due to the unknown influence of neighboring and interdispersed amino acids. As a result, if antigen structures are
available, it may be better to predict cross-reactivity based
on the epitope's 3D structural conservation.

Conclusion

Depending on the specific needs of a user, an analysis of
epitope conservancy may need to be performed at various
phylogenetic levels. For example, to determine the potential of a given epitope to be cross-reactive amongst different isolates of a pathogen, or with different
microorganisms associated with different pathogenicity, it
may be necessary to determine conservancy within a given
sub strain, type or clad, within a specific species, or within
a genus, or other higher phylogenetic classification group.
This type of analysis was utilized previously to identify
highly conserved HBV derived epitopes [11,12], and also
applied to identify HCV, P. falciparum and HIV derived
epitopes [[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]]. Alternatively, to develop epitope-based diagnostic applications
aimed at detecting all isolates of a given pathogen but not
isolates from related strains, or aimed at detecting specific

• Operating system(s): Platform independent

To address the issue of conservation (or variability) of
epitopes or, more broadly speaking, peptide sequences,
we have developed a tool to calculate the degree of conservancy (or inversely, the variability) of an epitope
within a given protein sequence set. Conservancy can be
calculated following user defined identity criteria, and
minimal and maximal levels of conservancy are identified. Furthermore, the program provides detail information for each alignment executed. This epitope
conservancy analysis tool is publicly available and can be
used to assist in the selection of epitopes with the desired
pattern of conservation for designing epitope-based diagnostics and vaccines.
