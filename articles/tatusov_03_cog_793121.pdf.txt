Abstract
Background: The availability of multiple, essentially complete genome sequences of prokaryotes and eukaryotes spurred both
the demand and the opportunity for the construction of an evolutionary classification of genes from these genomes. Such a
classification system based on orthologous relationships between genes appears to be a natural framework for comparative
genomics and should facilitate both functional annotation of genomes and large-scale evolutionary studies.
Results: We describe here a major update of the previously developed system for delineation of Clusters of Orthologous
Groups of proteins (COGs) from the sequenced genomes of prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes and the construction of
clusters of predicted orthologs for 7 eukaryotic genomes, which we named KOGs after eukaryotic orthologous groups. The
COG collection currently consists of 138,458 proteins, which form 4873 COGs and comprise 75% of the 185,505 (predicted)
proteins encoded in 66 genomes of unicellular organisms. The eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOGs) include proteins from 7
eukaryotic genomes: three animals (the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens),
one plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, two fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe), and the intracellular
microsporidian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi. The current KOG set consists of 4852 clusters of orthologs, which include
59,838 proteins, or ~54% of the analyzed eukaryotic 110,655 gene products. Compared to the coverage of the prokaryotic
genomes with COGs, a considerably smaller fraction of eukaryotic genes could be included into the KOGs; addition of new
eukaryotic genomes is expected to result in substantial increase in the coverage of eukaryotic genomes with KOGs. Examination
of the phyletic patterns of KOGs reveals a conserved core represented in all analyzed species and consisting of ~20% of the
KOG set. This conserved portion of the KOG set is much greater than the ubiquitous portion of the COG set (~1% of the
COGs). In part, this difference is probably due to the small number of included eukaryotic genomes, but it could also reflect the
relative compactness of eukaryotes as a clade and the greater evolutionary stability of eukaryotic genomes.
Conclusion: The updated collection of orthologous protein sets for prokaryotes and eukaryotes is expected to be a useful
platform for functional annotation of newly sequenced genomes, including those of complex eukaryotes, and genome-wide
evolutionary studies.

Background
The rapid accumulation of genome sequences is a major
challenge to researchers attempting to extract the maximum functional and evolutionary information from the
new genomes. To avoid informational overflow from the
constant influx of new genome sequences, a comprehensive evolutionary classification of the genes from all
sequenced genomes is required. Such classifications are
based on two fundamental notions from evolutionary
biology: orthology and paralogy, which describe the two
fundamentally different types of homologous relationships between genes [1–4]. Orthologs are homologous
genes derived by vertical descent from a single ancestral
gene in the last common ancestor of the compared species. Paralogs, in contrast, are homologous genes, which,
at some stage of evolution of the respective gene family,
have evolved by duplication of an ancestral gene. The
notions of orthology and paralogy are intimately linked
because, if a duplication (s) occurred after the speciation
event that separated the compared species, orthology
becomes a relationship between sets of paralogs (coorthologs), rather than individual genes. A classic case of
the interplay between orthologous and paralogous relationships is seen in the globin family: all animal globins,
including myoglobin, are paralogs, but they are all coorthologs of the plant leghemoglobin(s) [5].
Deciphering orthologous and paralogous relationships
among genes is critical for both the functional and the
evolutionary aspects of comparative genomics [4,5].
Orthologs typically occupy the same functional niche in
different species, whereas paralogs tend to evolve toward
functional diversification. Therefore, robustness of
genome annotation depends on accurate identification of
orthologs. Similarly, knowing which homologous genes
are orthologs and which are paralogs is required for constructing evolutionary scenarios involving, along with vertical inheritance, lineage-specific gene loss and horizontal
gene transfer.
In principle, identification of orthologs requires phylogenetic analysis of entire families of homologous proteins,
which is expected to isolate orthologous protein sets in
distinct clades [6–8]. However, on the scale of complete
genomes, such analysis is both extremely labor-intensive
and error-prone due to the inherent artifacts of phylogenetic tree construction. Therefore shortcuts have been
developed by introducing the notion of a genome-specific
best hit (BeT). A BeT is the protein in a target genome,
which is most similar to a given protein from the query
genome [9,10]. The underlying premise is that orthologs
are more similar to each other than they are to any other
protein from the respective genomes. In multiple-genome
comparisons, pairs of potential orthologs identified via
BeTs can be joined to form clusters of orthologs repre-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/4/41

sented in all or a subset of the analyzed genomes [9,11].
This approach to the identification of orthologous protein
sets meets with two obvious complications. Firstly, many
proteins belong to lineage-specific expansions, i.e., have
evolved via duplication(s) after the divergence of the compared species [12–14]. In these cases, deciphering
(co)orthologous relationships can be a hard task and clusters of orthologs that include such expansions should be
treated with particular caution. The second complication
is caused by the fact that many proteins exist in multidomain forms encoded by a single gene in some species and
as products of two or more stand-alone genes in others. In
protein clustering, multidomain proteins may connect
distinct clusters of orthologs resulting in artifactual
lumping.
The approach to the identification of orthologous protein
sets based on clustering of consistent BeTs has been
implemented in the collection of Clusters of Orthologous
Groups (COGs) of proteins [9,15]. The COG construction
protocol included an automatic procedure for detecting
candidate sets of orthologs, manual splitting of multidomain proteins into the component domains, and subsequent manual curation and annotation. The COGs started
with 6 prokaryotic genomes and one genome of a unicellular eukaryote, yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [9]. Subsequent updates increased the number of prokaryotic
genomes in the COGs to 43 [15]. The procedure for COG
construction required that each COG included proteins
from at least three sufficiently distant species. This conservative approach notwithstanding, ~60 to ~85% of the
proteins encoded in prokaryotic genomes were included
in the COGs.
The COG system, which includes the COGNITOR program for adding new members to COGs (RLT, unpublished results), has become a widely used tool for
computational genomics. The most important applications of the COGs are functional annotation of newly
sequenced genomes [16–20] and genome-wide evolutionary analyses [21–25].
Here, we present a major update to the COGs, with over
63 sequenced prokaryotic genomes and three genomes of
unicellular prokaryotes now included. Furthermore, the
COG system is extended to complex, multicellular eukaryotes by constructing clusters of probable orthologs, which
we named KOGs (eukaryotic orthologous groups) for 7
sequenced genomes of animals, fungi, microsporidia, and
plants.

Results and discussion
Update of the COGs
To add a new species to the COG system, the annotated
protein sequences from the respective genome were com-

pared to the proteins in the COG database by using the
BLAST program and assigned to pre-existing COGs by
using the COGNITOR program (and see Materials and
Methods). The genomes of prokaryotes and unicellular
eukaryotes that have been sequenced since the latest
update of the COGs were added one at a time. At each
step, the proteins that remained unassigned after manual
validation of the COGNITOR results were subject to the
COG construction procedure in order to identify new
COGs that could be formed thanks to the addition of the
analyzed genome. The resulting COG assignments for 63
prokaryotic genomes and three genomes of unicellular
eukaryotes are quantified in Table 1. The addition of new
species leads to incremental increase in the COG coverage
for each of the included prokaryotic genomes. The highest
coverage now achieved is for Buchnera sp. (99%) and the
lowest coverage is for Borrelia burgdorferi (43%). Each of
these organisms is a special case. Buchnera is a highly
degraded ensymbiont, which evolved from a relatively
recent common ancestor with E. coli but apparently lost
the great majority of genes, retaining – almost exclusively
– conserved, essential ones [26], whereas Borrelia has
numerous plasmids that mostly encode poorly conserved
genes [27]. Probably more telling is the observation that,
for most free-living prokaryotes, ~80% of the genes
belong to COGs and there is no appreciable dependence
between the number of genes in a genome and the COG
coverage (Table 1). Given that most genomes encode a
substantial fraction (up to 10%) of fast-evolving, nonglobular proteins [28] and other poorly conserved proteins (e.g., remnants of prophages) as well, these findings
seem to suggest that the COG coverage of most genomes
is approaching saturation.
The COGs are accompanied by a phyletic pattern search
tool, i.e., a Web-based tool that allows the user to select
COGs with a desired pattern of presence-absence of species. Using the phyletic pattern search tool, one can classify the COGs by the representation of the major lineages
of unicellular life forms (Fig. 1). This breakdown of the
updated COGs emphasizes the important trend noticed
previously[9,15]: only a minuscule fraction (~1%) of the
COGs are ubiquitous and even the COGs that are present
in all bacteria or in all archaea represent a small minority.
Furthermore, many COGs show scattered distribution,
which appears to reflect rampant lineage-specific gene loss
and horizontal gene transfer, which are typical of prokaryotic evolution [29–31].
Construction of KOGs for 7 sequenced eukaryotic
genomes
Eukaryotic KOGs were constructed from annotated proteins encoded in the genomes of three animals (Homo
sapiens [32], the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster [33], and
the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans) [34], the green plant

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/4/41

Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress) [35], two fungi (budding
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [36] and fission yeast
Schizosaccharomyces pombe [37], and the microsporidian
Encephalitozoon cuniculi [38]). The basic procedure for
KOG construction was the same as the procedure previously employed for prokaryotic genomes (Refs. [9,15] and
see Materials and Methods). Given the abundance of
multidomain architectures among eukaryotic proteins
and the fact that apparent orthologs often differ in
domain composition [32,39], the protocol based on the
BeT analysis was amended with domain identification
using the RPS-BLAST program [40]. Proteins assigned to a
KOG by the initial KOG construction procedure were kept
in that KOG without splitting them into individual
domains if they shared a common core of domains. In
addition, proteins, which consisted solely of widespread,
"promiscuous" domains (e.g., SH2, SH3, WD40 repeats
or TPR repeats) and did not show clear-cut orthologous
relationships, were assigned to Fuzzy Orthologous
Groups (FOGs). In addition to KOGs and FOGs, we also
identified provisional clusters of orthologs represented in
two genomes (TWOGs) by detecting bi-directional BeTs
between proteins not included in KOGs or FOGs and
assigning additional members by examination of the
BLAST search outputs. Finally, lineage-specific expansions
(LSEs) of paralogs among the proteins from each genome
not included in KOGs, FOGs, and TWOGs were detected
by using the clustering procedure described previously
[14] accompanied by a newly developed procedure for
finding tight protein clusters (BK and RLT, unpublished
results). The construction of TWOGs and LSEs involved
more extensive case by case evaluation than the KOG construction due to the lack of well established procedures to
generate these types of clusters; nevertheless, these clusters
should be considered preliminary until further validation.
Table 2 shows the assignment of the proteins from each of
the analyzed eukaryotic species to KOGs. Unlike the situation with prokaryotic COGs (Table 1), the fraction of
proteins assigned to KOGs tends to decrease with increasing genome size of the analyzed eukaryotic species, from
the maximum of ~74% for fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the second smallest genome (for reasons that
remain unclear, the smallest genome, that of the microsporidian Encephalitozoon cuniculi, had only 61% of the
proteins included in COGs) to ~49% for the largest,
human genome (Table 2).
Compared to prokaryotes, a considerably smaller fraction
of eukaryotic genes could be included into KOGs (Tables
1 and 2). Thus, the apparent difference in coverage with
highly conserved clusters of orthologs (C/KOGs) between
prokaryotes and eukaryotes, particularly complex ones, is
probably due to the relatively small number of eukaryotic
genomes included in this analysis and is expected to level

off with the growth of the eukaryotic genome collection.
This view is compatible with the observed dependence of
the KOG coverage on the number of genes (Table 1),
which suggests that the KOGs are still far from saturation.
Examination of the phyletic patterns of KOGs points to
the existence of a conserved eukaryotic gene core as well
as substantial diversity (Fig. 2); this clearly resembles the
evolutionary pattern seen previously during the analysis
of archaeal COGs [41]. The genes represented in each of
the 7 analyzed genomes comprise ~20% of the KOG set
and approximately the same number of KOGs includes 6
species, with the exception of the microsporidian. The
prevalence of the latter pattern is not surprising given that

microsporidia are intracellular parasites with minimal
metabolic capabilities and a dramatically reduced
genome [38]. The next largest group consists of animalspecific COGs, which, again, could be expected because
animals are the only lineage of complex eukaryotes that is
represented by more than one species in the analyzed set
of genomes. However, a notable observation is that ~30%
of the KOGs had "odd" phyletic patterns, e.g., are represented in one animal, one plant and one fungal species
(Fig. 2).
To illustrate the typical composition of a KOG, some of
the problems that tend to emerge with their construction,
and possible biological implications, we briefly discuss

as the result of examination of BLAST search outputs,
focused on the conservation of the globin-specific
sequence motifs. The final KOG is represented in 6 of the
7 analyzed eukaryotic species, with the sole exception of
E. cuniculi (Fig. 3). The most remarkable aspect of this
KOG is the apparent independent proliferation of genes
for globins and globin-like proteins in vertebrates (represented here by humans): 11 paralogs, and nematodes (C.
elegans): 24 paralogs (CE23430 and CE23431 are parts of
the same gene). Strictly speaking, to demonstrate that
these expansions are, indeed, independent, rather than
ancestral, complete phylogenetic analysis is required,
which is a difficult task given the low sequence conservation in many members of the KOGs. However, the presence of only one globin homolog in D. melanogaster is best
compatible with hypothesis of lineage-specific expansion
because, regardless of the exact topology of the animal
phylogenetic tree [42], the alternative to this hypothesis
would involve massive loss of globin-like genes in insects.
Furthermore, this hypothesis is also compatible with the
topology of the crude similarity dendrogram, which
accompanies the KOG and in which the majority of

human and nematode members form distinct clusters
(Fig. 3). Thus, at this stage, the most likely, conservative
interpretation of the evolutionary relationship between
vertebrates and nematode globins is that they comprise
co-orthologous sets and are legitimately included in the
same KOG. Similarly, the two paralogous leghemoglobins
from A. thaliana should be considered co-orthologous to
the human and C. elegans paralogous sets.
The functions of human globins and globin homologs,
primarily in oxygen delivery to different tissues, at
different developmental stages have been studied in great
detail [43]. In contrast, the dramatic proliferation of
globin-like proteins in the nematode C. elegans, while
noticed, in part, in previous work [44], is not well understood. To our knowledge, KOG3378 is the most complete
current representation of this lineage-specific expansion
of globin-like paralogs; the experimental study of these
genes is expected to reveal novel aspects of invertebrate
physiology.

Figure 3
An example of a complex eukaryotic KOG: globins and related hemoproteins
An example of a complex eukaryotic KOG: globins and related hemoproteins. The systematic protein names of the
KOG members are listed under each species. To the left of the KOG proper is the similarity dendrogram produced from the
BLAST scores between the KOG members. This is a crude clustering, which should not be construed as a phylogenetic tree.

Another notable observation comes from the analysis of
the yeast members of KOG3378. A BLAST search of the
non-redundant protein sequence database (NCBI, NIH,
Bethesda) and examination of the domain composition
of the S. cerevisiae protein YGR234w shows that this protein (named flavohemoglobin) consists of the globin
domain fused to a flavodoxin reductase domain and is
highly similar to a variety of oxidoreductases from several
bacterial species and some lower eukaryotes (e.g., slime
molds and other protists), which have the same domain
composition ([45] and data not shown). The S. pombe flavohemoglobin belongs to the same protein family but is
not the closest relative of the S. cerevisiae flavohemoglobin

(data not shown). These observations strongly suggest
that the yeast flavohemoglobin genes have been acquired
from bacteria via horizontal gene transfer and hence have
an evolutionary history that is distinct and independent
from those of plant and animal globins. Notably, the
second member of this KOG from S. cerevisie YNL234w is
not at all a close paralog of the flavohemoglobins. The
only identifiable domain in this large protein is the globin
domain, which is most similar to vertebrate neuroglobins.
These observations illustrate an important general point
to be kept in mind when perusing the KOGs: although a
given set of proteins may have been legitimately brought
together in the same KOG in the context of eukaryotic

genome comparison, on some occasions, different KOG
members have different evolutionary trajectories.
Prokaryotic and eukaryotic orthologous gene sets:
evolutionary connections and functional differences
The two sets of orthologous genes overlap because the
three species of unicellular eukaryotes were included in
both sets; the proteins from these species obviously form
connections between prokaryotic orthologous sets
(COGs) and eukaryotic orthologous sets (KOGs). Such
connections, suggestive of orthologous relationships,
were established between 1253 COGs, each of which
included at least one protein from a unicellular eukaryote
(not counting COGs that consisted exclusively of eukaryotic proteins), and 2000 eukaryotic KOGs. The greater
number of eukaryotic KOGs involved in this relationship
is due to the fact that, on many occasions, several proteins
from unicellular eukaryotes that are part of the same COG
have their distinct orthologs in other eukaryotes and,
accordingly, belong to several KOGs. Only relatively small
fractions of the prokaryotic COGs (27% of the COGs that
include at least one prokaryotic species) and eukaryotic
KOGs (34% of the KOGs and TWOGs) comprised sets of
putative orthologs represented in both prokaryotes and
eukaryotes. This emphasizes the distinction between the
repertoires of genes that are conserved in prokaryotes and
in eukaryotes and the considerable amount of innovation
in both groups of organisms. However, these numbers
give the low bound of the shared clusters of orthologs
because some of the KOGs are not represented in the relatively small genomes of unicellular eukaryotes, primarily
due to gene loss in the latter, but have prokaryotic
counterparts.

Functional annotation of the detected orthologous clusters is one of the crucial and most labor-consuming
aspects of the C/KOG analysis. Given the well-known
inaccuracy of the currently available schemes for automatic annotation (e.g., Refs. 5,18, and references therein),
no attempt was made to fully automate the C/KOG annotation; instead, assignments were made on a case by case
basis through a combination of published data on C/KOG
members and their homologs, protein domain analysis
and different types of context analysis, particularly
phyletic patterns and, in prokaryotes, conservation of
gene strings which comprise putative operons [46–48].
Figure 4 shows the distribution of known and predicted
protein functions for the prokaryotic COGs (i.e., the subset of the COGs obtained by subtraction from the COG
collection of those COGs that included solely unicellular
eukaryotes were) and the eukaryotic KOGs. The difference
between prokaryotic and eukaryotic clusters of orthologs
is obvious in that the latter are substantially enriched in
proteins involved in signal transduction and intracellular
trafficking; certain functional categories, such as cytoskel-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/4/41

eton formation and chromatin dynamics were unique to
eukaryotes. In contrast, metabolic and transport functions
were relatively more prominent among the prokaryotic
COGs (Fig. 4).
Using phyletic patterns to examine gene function and
evolution
Phyletic pattern search can be employed for preliminary
assessment of specific functional and evolutionary
hypotheses. With the increased number of included
genomes and enhanced capabilities of the phyletic pattern
search tool, this analysis becomes particularly informative. Below we discuss straightforward examples of its use.
Figure 5a shows the results of querying the COG database
for COGs that are represented in the microsporidian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi but not in the two yeast species. Given the dramatic genome reduction seen in the
microsporidium [38], it is not unexpected that the query
retrieves only a small set of 13 COGs. This phyletic pattern
can be explained either by loss of ancestral eukaryotic
genes in yeast or by acquisition of genes by E. cuniculi via
horizontal gene transfer. At least in some cases, further
examination of the phyletic patterns of the retrieved
COGs suggests the most likely scenario. Thus, COGs
1078, 1258, 1690, and 2263 are represented in all
archaea, but are either missing in bacteria or are present in
a minority of species (Fig. 5a). Therefore these COGs most
likely are part of the ancestral archaeo-eukaryotic heritage
[49] and might have been lost in yeasts; the respective
proteins are known or predicted to be involved in translation or RNA modification, which is compatible with this
evolutionary scenario. In contrast, COG3202 seems to be
a likely case of horizontal gene transfer. Remarkably, the
proteins in this COG are ADP/ATP translocases, which
seem to be a hallmark of intracellular parasitism (or symbiosis) allowing the respective organisms to tap into the
ATP supplies of the host cell [50,51]. Indeed, this COG is
shared by the eukaryotic (E. cuniculi) and bacterial
(Chlamydia and Rickettsia) intracellular parasites, the
only exception being a diverged member of the COG
found in the plant pathogenic bacterium Xylella fastidiosum (Fig. 5a).

The second case in point that we consider here is a search
for COGs, which are represented in the causative agent of
plague, Yersinia pestis [52], but not in other Proteobacteria
(the taxon to which Y. pestis belongs) or eukaryotes; this
query retrieves 7 COGs (Fig. 5b). These genes probably
have been acquired by Y. pestis via horizontal gene transfer. On a more practical note, some of these genes could
be potential targets for highly selective anti-bacterial
agents. It is noticeable that three of these genes are
predicted to be involved in cell wall metabolism (COGs
2152, 2401, and 3867), whereas the functions of others
remain uncharacterized.

Figure 4 classification of prokaryotic (COGs) and eukaryotic (KOGs) clusters of orthologs
Functional
Functional classification of prokaryotic (COGs) and eukaryotic (KOGs) clusters of orthologs. Designations of
functional categories: A, RNA processing and modification (not used for prokaryotic COGs), B, chromatin structure and
dynamics, C, energy production and conversion, D, cell cycle control and mitosis, E, amino acid metabolism and transport, F,
nucleotide metabolism and transport, G, carbohydrate metabolism and transport, H, coenzyme metabolism, I, lipid metabolism, J, translation, K, transcription, L, replication and repair, M, cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis, N, Cell motility, O,

nuclear structure (not applicable to prokaryotic COGs), Z, cytoskeleton (not applicable to prokaryotic COGs); R, general
functional prediction only (typically, prediction of biochemical activity), S, function unknown. The numbers were obtained after
subtracting the COGs that consisted entirely of proteins from unicellular eukaryotes from the COG collection.

Conclusions
The collection of COGs from prokaryotes and unicellular
eukaryotes was substantially amended to include 66 species and eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOGs) for 7 species were constructed. The prokaryotic COG system
already covers most of the globular proteins encoded in
bacterial and archaeal genomes. Eukaryotic KOGs include
a lower fraction of the encoded proteins but this difference is expected to level off with the growth of the eukaryotic genome collection. The eukaryotic KOG analysis
revealed a substantial conserved core of eukaryotic genes
as well as major lineage-specific variations. Lineage-specific expansion of paralogous families within the KOGs

and expansion of families that do not have orthologs in
other compared genomes make major contributions to
the eukaryotic gene repertoire. Only a minority of eukaryotic KOGs have readily detectable prokaryotic counterparts and the same holds for prokaryotic COGs,
emphasizing the extent of innovation in both the eukaryotic and prokaryotic divisions of life. The wide scatter of
the phyletic patterns among the KOGs testifies to the
importance of lineage-specific gene loss in the evolution
of eukaryotic genomes.
The current collection of eukaryotic KOGs includes 7
genomes whose sequences had been available as of July 1,

2002. Manual correction and annotation of KOGs is a
labor-intensive process, which precluded immediate
inclusion of the genomes of the mouse [53], fugu fish
[54], mosquito [55], the urochordate Ciona instestinalis
[56], and the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum [57],
which have become available since that date. However,
once the basic system is established, it is expected that
inclusion of these and other newly sequenced genomes in
the KOG system proceeds at a greater pace.
The C/KOG system can be employed for functional annotation of genes from new genomes by using the COGNITOR program and for research into genome evolution.

The utility of the system for both of these purposes should
increase progressively with the inclusion of new genomes,
particularly those of early-branching eukaryotes.

Methods
Protein sets for new genomes
The protein sets for all newly included bacterial and
archaeal genomes, the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the microsporidian Encaephalitozoon cuniculi, the thale cress Arabidopsis thaliana, and
the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster were extracted from
the Genome division of the (NCBI, NIH, Bethesda). The
protein sequences for the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans

BMC Bioinformatics 2003, 4

were from the WormPep67 database, the sequences for
Homo sapiens were from the NCBI build 30.
Addition of new genomes to the COGs
The new genomes were added to the COGs by using the
COGNITOR program, with the results validated manually, essentially as described previously [9,15]. After the
completion of the validation process, the remaining proteins were subject to the COG construction procedure, in
order to detect new COGs that could not be formed without the added genomes; the validation and annotation
steps were repeated with the newly detected COGs.
Sequence analysis, construction and annotation of KOGs
The construction of KOGs followed the previously outlined strategy based on sets of consistent BeTs [9,15], but
included additional steps that reflected specific features of
eukaryotic proteins. Briefly, the procedure was as follows.
1. Detection and masking of widespread, typically repetitive domains, which was performed by using the RPSBLAST program and the PSSMs for the respective domains
from the CDD collection [40]. These domains, namely,
PPR
(pfam01535),
WD40
(pfam00400),
IG
(pfam00047), IGc1, Igv, IG_like, RRM (pfam00076),
ANK (pfam00023), myosin tail (pfam01576), Fn3
(pfam00041), CA, (IG), ANK, kelch (pfam01344),
OAD_kelch, SH3 (pfam00018), intermediate filaments
(pfam00038), C2H2 finger (pfam00096), PDZ
(pfam00595), POZ (pfam00651), PH (pfam00169), ZnFC4 (pfam00105), spectrin (pfam00435), Sushi
(pfam00084), TPR (pfam00017), BTB, LRR_CC, LY, ARM,
SH2, and CH, were detected and masked prior to applying
the COG construction procedure. Masking these domains
was required to ensure the robust classification of the
eukaryotic orthologous clusters with the KOG detection
procedure because hits between these common, "promiscuous" domains resulted in spurious lumping of numerous non-orthologous proteins. 2. All-against-all
comparison of protein sequences from the analyzed
genomes by using the gapped BLAST program [58], with
filtering for low sequence complexity regions performed
using the SEG program [59]. 3. Detection of triangles of
mutually consistent, genome-specific best hits (BeTs). 4.
Merging triangles with a common side to form crude, preliminary KOGs. 5. Case by case analysis of each candidate
KOG. This analysis serves to eliminate the false-positives
that are incorporated in the KOGs during the automatic
steps and included, primarily, examination of the domain
composition of KOG members, which was determined
using the RPS-BLAST program and the CDD collection of
position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) for individual
domains [40]. Generally, proteins were kept in the same
KOG when they shared a conserved core domain architecture. However, in cases when KOGs were artificially
bridged by multidomain proteins, the latter were split

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/4/41

into individual domains (or arrays of domains) and steps
(1)-(4) were repeated with these sequences; this results in
the assignment of individual domains to KOGs in
accordance with their distinct evolutionary affinities. 6.
Assignment of proteins containing promiscuous
domains. In cases when a sequence assigned to a KOG
contained one or more masked promiscuous domains,
these domains were restored and became part of the
respective KOG. Proteins containing promiscuous
domains but not assigned to any KOG were classified in
Fuzzy Orthologous Groups (FOGs) named after the
respective domains. 7. Examination of large KOGs, which
included multiple members from all or several of the
compared genomes by using phylogenetic trees, cluster
analysis with the BLASTCLUST program ftp://
ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/, comparison of domain architectures, and visual inspection of alignments; as a result,
some of these protein sets were split into two or more
smaller ones that were included in the final set of KOGs.
The KOGs were annotated on the basis of the annotations
available through GenBank and other public databases,
which were critically assessed against the primary literature. For proteins that are currently annotated as
"hypothetical" or "unknown", iterative sequence similarity searches with the PSI-BLAST program [58], the results
of the RPS-BLAST searches, additional domain architecture analysis performed by using the SMART system [60],
and comparison to the COG database by using the COGNITOR program (RLT, unpublished results) were
employed to identify distant homologs with experimentally characterized functions and/or structures. The
known and predicted functions of KOGs were classified
into 23 categories (see legend to Fig. 4); these were modified from the functional classification previously
employed for prokaryotic COGs [15] by including several
specific eukaryotic categories.
