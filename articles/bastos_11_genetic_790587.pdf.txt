Abstract
Background: South Africa’s long and extensive trade activity has ensured ample opportunities for exotic species
introduction. Whereas the rich biodiversity of endemic southern African fauna has been the focus of many studies,
invasive vertebrates are generally overlooked despite potential impacts on biodiversity, health and agriculture.
Genetic monitoring of commensal rodents in South Africa which uncovered the presence of Rattus tanezumi, a
South-East Asian endemic not previously known to occur in Africa, provided the impetus for expanded studies on
all invasive Rattus species present.
Results: To this end, intensified sampling at 28 South African localities and at one site in Swaziland, identified 149
Rattus specimens. Cytochrome b gene sequencing revealed the presence of two R. tanezumi, seven Rattus rattus and
five Rattus norvegicus haplotypes in south Africa. Phylogenetic results were consistent with a single, recent R. tanezumi
introduction and indicated that R. norvegicus and R. rattus probably became established following at least two and
three independent introductions, respectively. Intra- and inter-specific diversity was highest in informal human
settlements, with all three species occurring at a single metropolitan township site. Rattus norvegicus and R. rattus each
occurred sympatrically with Rattus tanezumi at one and five sites, respectively. Karyotyping of selected R. rattus and
R. tanezumi individuals identified diploid numbers consistent with those reported previously for these cryptic species.
Ordination of bioclimatic variables and MaxEnt ecological niche modelling confirmed that the bioclimatic niche
occupied by R. tanezumi in south Africa was distinct from that occupied in its naturalised range in south-east Asia
suggesting that factors other than climate may influence the distribution of this species.
Conclusions: This study has highlighted the value of genetic typing for detecting cryptic invasive species,
providing historical insights into introductions and for directing future sampling. The apparent ease with which a
cryptic species can become established signals the need for broader implementation of genetic monitoring
programmes. In addition to providing baseline data and potentially identifying high-risk introduction routes, the
predictive power of ecological niche modelling is enhanced when species records are genetically verified.

Background
The long and close association of members of the genus
Rattus (Fischer de Waltheim) and Mus (Linnaeus) with
humans have, primarily due to their high levels of
adaptability and small size, made them two of the most
successful invasive mammalian genera. Whilst the

negative impacts of commensal rodents, and Rattus
in particular, on humans with respect to health and
competition for food are undisputed [1], the positive
contribution that some species have made as model/
experimental animals in biomedical research [2], and
more recently towards tracing historical human migrations [3,4], are increasingly acknowledged.
When introduced to areas outside their native range,
the effects of invasive rodents on endemic biodiversity
and on health can be detrimental, particularly in island

ecosystems. As reservoirs of a wide range of pathogens
[5] capable of infecting diverse hosts, they have the
potential to cause localised die-offs in native large mammal species [6] and in at least one extreme case, are
believed to have precipitated the extinction of two endemic rats, R. macleari and R. nativitatus on Christmas
island [7]. Their introduction to any ecosystem should,
therefore, be carefully monitored to identify and address
their presence and in so-doing, limit their impact. This
hinges on early detection, which can be difficult particularly in the case of Rattus, a diverse genus containing
numerous cryptic species. As a number of Rattus species
have become successfully established outside their native
range, this situation lends itself to a ‘silent invasion’
whereby a species can potentially go unnoticed for an
extended period of time if its introduction was preceded
by a cryptic species. This is partly because despite the
substantive and undeniable impacts of invasive Rattus
species, and their almost worldwide distribution, there is
a lack of definitive morphological keys due to the paucity of studies on the taxonomy, origin and natural history of members of this globally-distributed invasive
genus. A recent attempt to refine the higher-level taxonomy of the group and to base classifications within the
Rattini tribe on a systematic approach that is firmly
grounded in genetics [8] has highlighted the value of
molecular phylogenetic approaches in addressing the
intrinsic difficulties of this group of animals [1]. The
study revealed the presence of at least seven discrete
monophyletic lineages within the Indochinese Rattus
rattus species complex, two more than predicted from
traditional taxonomy, and also identified numerous
examples of morphological misidentification [8]. In addition to delimiting species and resolving taxonomic relationships [8], molecular data permit estimations of the
sequence and timing of species divergence. The generation of complete mitochondrial genome sequences of
wild-caught species has provided more accurate estimations of the timing of divergences of five Rattus congeners [9], namely; the black rat, R. rattus (Linnaeus), the
brown rat, R. norvegicus (Berkkenhaut), the Asian house
rat, R. tanezumi (Temminck), the Polynesian rat,
R. exulans (Peale) and the spiny rat, R. praetor (Thomas). Detailed intra-specific studies such as those performed on the Pacific rat, R. exulans, indicate that this
species can be used as a proxy for studying pre-historic
human migrations [10] and that R. rattus may similarly
provide insights into more recent human migrations [4].
Despite its widespread occurrence, the available molecular and genetic data for R. norvegicus are primarily
restricted to laboratory-adapted strains [2,11] and
data for wild-caught animals remains limited. Thus
although invasive Rattus species are receiving increased
attention, the complex taxonomy of the genus which is

Page 2 of 18

characterised by difficulties in morphology-based identifications, remains unclear [1,12,13,8] and there is a paucity of data from areas invaded by members of this
genus which comprises ca. 65 species. The availability of
a comprehensive, homologous dataset from throughout
the invaded and native ranges of each species would
provide insights into the origins and dispersal routes of
these economically important commensal species.
South Africa’s rich biodiversity is exemplified by the
approximately 50 murid rodent species which are
known to occur in this country [14]. Only a small proportion of species, notably members of the genera Rattus, Mastomys, and Gerbilliscus (formerly Tatera; [15]),
have been implicated in disease transmission [16,17] and
in causing damage to crops and stored grain [18]. The
presence of cryptic species in South Africa and elsewhere [19,20], complicates control and the value of
molecular approaches for identifying morphologically
indistinguishable murid rodents is increasingly being
recognised [21,13,8]. This approach was applied in a
European Commission and DFID-funded community
participatory research programme undertaken in South
Africa. It was during this routine molecular monitoring
that the presence of R. tanezumi was discovered in
South Africa [21,17], representing the first records of
this species on the African continent. Before this, just
two invasive Rattus species, R. norvegicus and R. rattus,
were known to occur in South Africa [22]. The unexpected presence of a third Rattus species, which
together with its sibling species, R. rattus forms part of
the R. rattus species complex, provided the impetus for
further sampling and genetic characterisation of rats
from four provinces in South Africa, and forms the
basis for this study, which aimed to determine the
genetic diversity and geographic distribution of invasive,
commensal Rattus species in South Africa. To this end,
149 Rattus specimens from South Africa and Swaziland
were identified to species level on the basis of mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b)gene sequencing. Karyotyping of selected R. rattus and R. tanezumi individuals
was performed to confirm the molecular identifications.
Geographic distribution records for the native range of
R. tanezumi (obtained from public domain museum
databases provided by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility; http://www.gbif.org) were used to predict
the distribution of this species in sub-Saharan Africa
and to determine the factors that may influence its
distribution.

Methods
Species and sampling

Two invasive Rattus species with markedly different
geographical distributions occur in South Africa: R. norvegicus is reported to be a coastal-bound species and

Bastos et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:26
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/26

R. rattus as being widely distributed throughout the
country [22]. A third, newly recorded species, R. tanezumi was identified from two sites in Limpopo Province
[21] and from one site in KwaZulu-Natal Province [17].
The subsequent intensified sampling, confirmed Rattus
species presence at two further Limpopo Province (LP)
localities, at one site in Mpumalanga Province (MP),
eight in Gauteng Province (GP), 15 in KwaZulu-Natal
(KZN) Province and one site in Swaziland (summarised
in Tables 1 and 2). In this study, ‘south Africa’ refers to
the region that incorporates South Africa and the two
landlocked countries of Lesotho and Swaziland.
Samples were obtained by snap-trapping and through
routine extermination programmes conducted by pest
control companies in townships and at facilities such as
the O.R. Tambo International Airport. A small number
of animals were live-trapped, using Sherman traps (H.B.
Sherman Traps Inc. Florida, U.S.A.) baited with a mixture of peanut butter, oatmeal and fish oil. After capture, during transportation and in the laboratory, the
live-trapped animals were kept in polyurethane cages
with wood shavings provided as bedding, and mouse
pellets and water provided ad libitum, as per the guidelines of the American Society of Mammalogists (ASM;
http://www.mammalogy.org/committees/index.asp; Animal Care and Use Committee 1998). Animals were
euthanized in accordance with the protocol approved by
the Animal Ethics subcommittee of the University of
KwaZulu-Natal Research Committee. Voucher specimens were prepared using standard natural history
museum procedures for mammal specimens and are
deposited in the South African mammal reference collections of the Transvaal Museum (TM) of the Northern
Flagship Institute (NFI) in Pretoria and the Durban Natural Science Museum (Table 1).
Cytochrome b gene characterisation

Total genomic DNA was extracted from either liver or
kidney samples using the High Pure PCR template preparation kit (Roche) according to the prescribed manufacturer protocol. The entire cytochrome b gene was
amplified using murid rodent primers that bind within the
mitochondrial genome regions flanking cyt b, namely
L14724 TGAYATGAAAAAYCATCGTTG and H15915
CATTTCAGGTTTACAAGAC [20]. The thermal cycling
profile consisted of two cycles of denaturation at 96°C for
12 s, primer annealing at 52°C for 30 s, and extension at
70°C for 60 s. Keeping denaturation and extension steps
the same, the next three cycles were performed at an
annealing temperature (Ta) of 50°C, with the Ta of the
final 35 cycles being adjusted to 48°C. The resulting amplicon, approximately 1.2 kb in length, was purified directly
from the tube using the High Pure PCR product purification kit (Roche) according to manufacturer specifications.

Page 3 of 18

Nucleotide sequences were determined by cycle sequencing with either version 3.0 or 3.1 of the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied
Biosystems), at a Ta of 48°C, with each of the PCR primers
in separate reactions. Sequences were precipitated and run
on the ABI PRISM™ 3100 Analyser (Applied Biosystems).
Forward and reverse nucleotide sequences were viewed
and aligned in Mega4 [23] and full-length cyt b gene contigs, 1140 nucleotides (nt) in length, were generated for
147 southern African Rattus specimens and for three additional samples obtained from Indonesia and Vietnam
(Table 1). Two partial sequences were also generated for
R. rattus haplotypes RR10 and RR11 from KZN (Table 1).
Of the 152 Rattus sequences generated, 143 were from
Rattus sampled in South Africa (71 R. tanezumi, 35 R. rattus and 37 R. norvegicus), six were from Swaziland and
three from outside south Africa (Table 1). At least one
sequence per species, locality and haplotype was submitted
to Genbank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov under the accession numbers listed in Table 1.
Molecular analyses

The 150-taxon full-length Rattus cyt b gene dataset generated in this study, and containing specimens from
South Africa, Swaziland, Indonesia and Vietnam, was
reduced to a dataset of 24 taxa which retained all of the
sequence diversity on a per-species, per-province and
per-haplotype basis. This dataset was complemented
with 23 full-length cyt b gene sequences containing 20
Rattus conspecific sequences available in the Genbank
database (Table 1) and three Mus musculus outgroup
sequences. The latter comprised two Genbank entries
(accession numbers EF108343-4) and one M. m. domesticus haplotype identified in this study following nucleotide sequencing of two specimens from South Africa
(accession number HQ157798). The best-fit model and
parameters identified under the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) in ModelTest 3.7 [24] guided model selection for the Minimum Evolution (ME) and Maximum
Likelihood (ML) analyses performed in Mega4 [23] and
PhyML [25], respectively, and for setting priors for
Bayesian inference (BI) with MrBayes [26]. For the latter
analyses, four Markov Monte Carlo chains were run for
10,000,000 generations using default heating and swap
settings, and were sampled every 2000 generations, with
20% of the run being discarded as ‘burn-in’. Three independent runs were performed to ensure convergence.
Nodal support for clades was assessed by 100,000 and
1,000 non-parametric bootstrap replicates for ME and
ML, respectively, and from Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP). In addition to inferring relationships from
available full-length cyt b sequences, partial cyt b datasets (> 1000 bp in length) were compiled for R. rattus
and R. tanezumi which incorporated the haplotype

diversity reported for these species in previous studies
[27-29,9,30,8,4].
Nucleotide and haplotype diversity indexes were determined in DNAsp version 5 [31]. Median-joining networks were constructed for each Rattus species in
Network 4.5.1.0 [32] which takes pairwise haplotype differences into account to generate a network of parsimonious relationships that combines all possible trees
using a one-step mutation model [33]. For R. rattus and
R. tanezumi, haplotype networks were constructed from
full-length as well as the partial cyt b datasets. All
R. norvegicus analyses were based on full-length gene
sequences.

Karyotyping

Eight specimens typed as R. rattus and five as R. tanezumi following cyt b sequencing were selected for karyotyping (Table 2). Metaphase chromosome spreads
were prepared from either bone marrow samples flushed
from the shafts of the tibiae and/or femorae of each
sacrificed specimen as originally described by Hsu and
Patton [34], or from skin fibroblast cultures established
from < 1 cm2 ear biopsies, as described by Contrafatto
et al. [35]. Giemsa-stained metaphase plates with the
best morphology and least chromosomal overlaps were
digitally recorded using a Vanox AHBS3 Olympus compound microscope connected to a coupled charged

Ecological niche modeling

Notwithstanding acknowledged limitations, bioclimatic
data from the native range ("niche”) of an invasive species can be used to predict the extent of invasion in a
target area [37-40]. This approach assumes climatic
matching of native and target areas. To test this
assumption, using principal components analysis
(PCA), we compared the bioclimatic space occupied by
13 geo-referenced R. tanezumi distribution records
from the invasive range of the species in South Africa
and Swaziland (precision of 0.001 degrees) with that
obtained from 134 unique-locality occurrence records
from the combined naturalised and native range
extracted from public domain databases provided by
the Global Biodiversity Information Facility http://
www.gbif.org. Altitude and eight bioclimatic variables
(WORLDCLIM version 1.4: http://www.worldclim.org/
bioclim; [41]) were originally chosen (see additional
file 1, Table S1), reflecting means, extremes, and seasonal variation of temperature and precipitation, viz.
Bio1 (mean annual temperature), Bio4 (temperature
seasonality), Bio5 (maximum temperature of warmest
month), Bio6 (minimum temperature of coldest
month), Bio12 (annual precipitation), Bio13 (precipitation of wettest month), Bio14 (precipitation of driest
month), and Bio15 (precipitation seasonality). In order
to compare the relative importance of human and climate variables in the respective ecological niches of
the species from its invasive and naturalised ranges,
“human footprint”, a global map of human influence
on the landscape was also used [42].
Next we estimated the ecological niche for R. tanezumi
based on 119 native and naturalised occurrence records,
in order to predict the species’ potential invasive distribution in sub-Saharan Africa, and to compare this with the
actual known invasive range. We used the MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy; [43]) programme which employs a general machine learning algorithm, because it has been
shown to perform well with presence-only data and with
small sample sizes, and generally outperforms alternative
“climatic envelope” models such as GARP and BIOCLIM
[44]. To correct for potential statistical over-fitting due
to high correlation coefficients between certain bioclimatic variables, we summarised the pattern of correlations between the original set of eight bioclimatic
variables by means of an Unweighted Pair-Group
Method with Averages (UPGMA) correlation phenogram. Individual variables were selected from four distinct (independent) clusters (data not shown): Bio1
(mean annual temperature), Bio4 (temperature seasonality), Bio12 (annual precipitation), Bio14 (precipitation of
driest month). Given the known commensalism of rats,
including R. tanezumi, and following Ficetola et al. [38]
“human footprint” was included as a fifth variable.

Page 7 of 18

The environmental data were set to a spatial grid
resolution of 2.5 arc minutes and were clipped to an
area accommodating the native and naturalised ranges
of R. tanezumi. The projection layer (target area) was
clipped to sub-Saharan African south of 13 degrees
north. The MaxEnt model was run with 70% presence
records used for training and 30% for random testing,
with the regularization multiplier set to 1.0, maximum
number of iterations to 1500, convergence threshold to
1 × 10-5 and output format to logistic. Duplicate
records (in the same pixel) were excluded. Model performance was assessed with proportion of presences
correctly classified (sensitivity), proportion of absences
correctly classified (specificity), and discrimination ability (area under the curve [AUC] of a receiver operating
characteristic [ROC] plot of sensitivity versus 1-specificity). Since MaxEnt produces a continuous probability
(ranging from 0 to 1.0), the continuous model output
was transformed to a map representing probabilities of
occurrence. The contribution of each explanatory variable to model performance was evaluated with a jackknife procedure implemented in MaxEnt, where
variables are successively omitted and then used in isolation to measure their relative, as well as their absolute
contribution to the model.

Results
Genetic analyses

The 44-taxon Rattus ingroup dataset contained 183 variable and 165 parsimony-informative sites across the
1140 nucleotide (nt) cyt b gene region. As would be
expected for a coding gene, the proportion of base position mutations was 3 rd > 1st > 2 nd , with 138 (75%) of
the mutations occurring in the 3 rd base position, 39
(21%) in the 1st base position and the remaining 6 (4%)
being attributed to 2nd base position mutations.
For the 47-taxon dataset, inclusive of three Mus outgroup sequences, the GTR+I+G model (I = 0.5084 and
G = 0.8058) with nucleotide frequencies of A = 0.308, C
= 0.288, G = 0.123, T = 0.281, was selected as the bestfit model under the AIC in ModelTest. The cyt b gene
tree (Figure 1) recovered three monophyletic Rattus
lineages in south Africa. Nodes that had ≥ 70% bootstrap support in the phenetic analyses generally had
high levels of support in the maximum likelihood analyses (Figure 1). The two South African R. tanezumi
haplotypes, RT01 and RT02, formed a monophyletic
lineage (100% support; Figure 1) and differed from each
other at just one nucleotide site at position 538 in the
full-length dataset (see additional file 2, Figure S2a) and
position 501 in the partial cyt b dataset (Figure 2). This
first base mutation results in a non-synonymous alanine
to threonine amino acid substitution. For R. rattus,
three discrete lineages were recovered for the South

African specimens (Figure 1). Haplotype RR01, which
occurred in 16 individuals sampled at four South Africa
sites, was also present in an individual from Tanzania
(Tables 1 & 2). The RR01 haplotype, was sister to haplotype RR02 from Indonesia (73-88% nodal support,
Figure 1) differing from it by four mutational steps (see
additional file 2, Figure S2b). Haplotypes RR04 and
RR05 clustered within a lineage containing representatives from New Zealand (RR06) and Japan (RR07), with
high levels of support (87-100% nodal support, Figure
1). The third South African haplotype lineage, RR03, is
separated from the former South Africa-New ZealandJapan cluster by at least six mutational steps (Figure 3),
and unrelated to all other haplotypes included in the
full-length (Figure 1) and partial dataset (see additional
file 3, Figure S3) analyses. For R. norvegicus, two discrete
South African lineages were recovered. Three of the five
South African haplotypes (RN02, RN03 and RN04) were
linked to haplotype RN01, recovered from 20 South
African specimens (Figure 4), which was also represented by laboratory strain, BN/SsNHsdMCW (Genbank
accession number AY172581; Figure 1). Haplotype
RN12 which represents the second R. norvegicus lineage
in South Africa, predominated at two Gauteng Province
sites, and was sister to RN13, a haplotype present in the
T2DN/Mcwi lab strain and in a wild-caught individual
from Japan (Figure 1), differing from the latter two
sequences at a single nucleotide site (Figure 4).
Haplotype diversity (h) and nucleotide diversity (π)
values determined from complete gene sequence datasets for each of the three south African Rattus species
were: (i) R. norvegicus: h = 0.613 (5 haplotypes from 37
sequences), π = 0.00379, (ii) R. tanezumi: h = 0.026 (2
haplotypes from 77 sequences), π = 0.00002, and (iii)
R. rattus: h = 0.667 (4 haplotypes from 33 sequences), π
= 0.00514. Between-species mean p-distance calculated
in Mega4 [23] was 3.9% for the two sibling species of
the R. rattus species complex, R. tanezumi-R. rattus,
11.9% for R. tanezumi-R. norvegicus and 11.2% for
R. rattus-R. norvegicus.
Karyotyping of eight R. rattus individuals recovered
diploid chromosome numbers of 38 in six specimens and
40 in two specimens (Figure 5). All five R. tanezumi specimens had the 2n = 42 karyotype that is characteristic of
this species (Figure 5). Two of the R. rattus individuals
(SA255 and SA258) which were identical across the cyt b
gene (both haplotype RR04) and which were sampled
from the same locality (Umkomaas, KwaZulu-Natal Province), were found to have different chromosome numbers (Figure 5). The R. rattus 2n = 38 arrangement was
characterized by nine pairs of acrocentric chromosomes,
metacentric M1 and M2 (marker) chromosomes, seven
additional pairs of metacentric chromosomes and one
pair of acrocentric X chromosomes, conforming precisely

Page 8 of 18

to the “Oceania” R. rattus arrangement described by
Yosida et al. [45]. Marker chromosomes M 1 and M 2
represent centric fusion events involving chromosomes
4/7 and 11/12 respectively of the putative ancestral karyotype [45]. The 2n = 40 arrangement was identical to
that of the 2n = 38, except that it contained an additional
pair (pair 21) derived from a centric fission event. In this
respect, this arrangement represents an intermediate
stage between the Oceania form and the “Mauritian”
form [45] which was derived from the 2n = 38 form by
two centric fission events, and which has not been documented to date. The 2n = 42 arrangement matched
R. tanezumi [45] and was characterized by 13 acrocentric
chromosome pairs, seven pairs of metacentric chromosomes and acrocentric X and Y chromosomes. No marker chromosomes were identified for this arrangement
(Figure 5).
Geographical distribution

Rattus tanezumi occurred in three provinces at sampling
sites ranging from 446 m above sea level (a.s.l.) to 1605
m a.s.l. (Table 2; Figure 6a). R. rattus was recorded from
all four South African Provinces sampled in this study, at
altitudes ranging from 14 m to 1605 m a.s.l and from
Cape Town (altitude not known) in a previous study [4].
Although R. norvegicus was only recorded in the Gauteng
and KwaZulu-Natal Provinces, it had the broadest altitudinal range occurring at sites ranging from 6 m to 1693
m a.s.l. Rattus tanezumi and R. rattus occurred sympatrically at two Limpopo Province sites (Giyani and Tshilimbani) and at three sites in Gauteng Province (Figure 6a),
viz. Moreleta Park (a suburb of Pretoria) and in Tembisa
and Hammanskraal which are both townships incorporated within the greater metropolitan areas of Johannesburg and Pretoria, respectively. The three invasive Rattus
species occurred sympatrically at a single site, Tembisa,
which like Hammanskraal is a peri-urban township of
Gauteng Province that incorporates areas of informal
human settlement. Intra-specific diversity was also highest in townships within the major metropolitan areas of
Durban, Pretoria and Johannesburg. Two R. norvegicus
haplotypes (RN01 and RN02) were recovered from four
Cato Crest specimens, three R. rattus haplotypes (RR03,
RR04 and RR05) were identified from six Hammanskraal
individuals and for Tembisa two haplotypes (RT01 and
RT02) were identified from the four R. tanezumi individuals, two haplotypes (RR01 and RR03) from three
R. rattus individuals and two haplotypes (RN01 and
RN12) from four R. norvegicus individuals. This corresponds to a total of six Rattus haplotypes from just 11
specimens in Tembisa and to four Rattus haplotypes
from the 18 individuals in Hammanskraal.

Figure 2 Median-joining network of Rattus tanezumi cytochrome b (cyt b) haplotypes based on partial (1077 bp) gene sequences.
Haplotype colour coding is consistent with that used in Figure 1, viz. Yellow = south Africa (This study), Grey = Outside Africa (Genbank). Each
of the mutational steps separating haplotypes is indicated in blue and corresponds to the relevant position in the cyt b gene, whilst black nodes
correspond to median vectors. Haplotype numbers are the same as those provided in Table 1. Additional haplotype numbers correspond to the
laboratory numbers assigned in the Pagès et al. [8] study.

islands, Africa and from Guadeloupe (Lesser Antilles,
Caribbean Sea) revealed that the RR01 haplotype also
occurs on Grande Comore, Tanzania and Mozambique
and that this haplotype is sister to a clade containing
haplotypes from India, Yemen and Indonesia (see additional file 3, Figure S3). South African haplotype RR03
was unrelated to any of the presently-available R. rattus
cyt b sequences, whilst the lineage containing South
African RR04 and RR05 haplotypes also included two
specimens from Cape Town in South Africa [4] and specimens from New Zealand, Japan, Oman, Guadeloupe,
Senegal, Reunion Island and Madagascar (see additional
file 3, Figure S3). The additionally-available partial
R. tanezumi data for specimens from Laos and Indonesia revealed the existence of multiple R. tanezumi
lineages and identified 16 haplotypes (Figure 2); the
South African haplotypes RT-01 and RT-02 were, however, unrelated to any of these, being separated by at
least nine mutational steps from any other haplotype.
Our sample of public records of occurrence was
strongly biased towards the presumed naturalised range
of the species in the Philippines and Indonesia and
included just four localities in China and Tibet occurring

within the probable native range of this species which is
likely to be restricted to Myanmar, northern Indochina
(northern Laos, central to northern Vietnam, northern
Thailand) through to southern China (K. Aplin, pers.
comm.). With the exception of the four northern localities in Tibet and China (including Hong Kong and
Hainan Island), specimens occurring in the naturalised
range of R. tanezumi encompass a climatic space that is
somewhat distinct from that occupied by R. tanezumi in
South Africa and Swaziland (Figure 6 & Figure 7). As
very few public records were available for the assumed
native distribution, we expected the model to show a
measure of under-prediction of both native+naturalised
and target (predicted invasive) niches. Based on examination of eigenvector loadings of variables from the PCA
(not shown), the separation of the South Africa, Chinese
and Tibetan records on the second principal component
(PC2) is influenced strongly by a contrast between temperature variables (high positive loading for mean average
temperature and minimum monthly temperature) and
two variables relating to seasonality of temperature and
precipitation (which showed high negative loadings on
PC2; Figure 7). Thus, the above-mentioned localities

Figure 3 Median-joining network of Rattus rattus cytochrome b (cyt b) haplotypes based on partial (1043 bp) gene sequences. The
circle size of south African Rattus haplotypes is proportional to the frequency of the haplotype. Haplotype colour coding is consistent with that
used in Figure 1, viz. Yellow = south Africa (This study), Blue = Outside Africa (This study), Green = Africa (Genbank), Grey = Outside Africa
(Genbank). Each of the mutational steps separating haplotypes is indicated in blue and corresponds to the relevant position in the cyt b gene,
whilst black nodes correspond to median vectors. Haplotype numbers are the same as those provided in Table 1. Additional haplotype numbers
correspond to the laboratory numbers assigned in the Tollenaere et al. [4] study.

(corresponding to the invasive range of South Africa and
the presumed original native range in Asia) are distinguished by low mean and minimum temperatures and
pronounced seasonality compared to records from the
naturalised range of the species in the Philippines and
Indonesia.
MaxEnt analyses using combined naturalised and
native distribution points and five environmental variables (four bioclimatic variables and human footprint)
predicted the potential invasive occurrence of R. tanezumi in Africa to be mostly limited to the equatorial belt
and the Ethiopian Rift (Figure 8). As indicated above, this
model most likely reflected a degree of under-prediction
of the potential invasive distribution in Africa. The MaxEnt algorithm converged after 840 iterations with a regularized training gain of 2.03. Model performance as
assessed by AUC was 0.969 for the training AUC and

0.927 for the test AUC, indicating efficient classification
of suitable versus unsuitable habitats. Bio4 (temperature
seasonality) explained most of the variation (52.2%), and
it was also the variable with the highest individual gain
(having the most useful information in itself). However,
human footprint was the environmental variable that
decreased the overall gain of the model most when
omitted indicating that it contains information that is not
present in the other variables. High habitat suitability of
R. tanezumi was associated with low values of temperature seasonality and high values of annual precipitation

commensal Rattus species, from two to three. Haplotype
diversity was low for all three invasive Rattus species in
South Africa with just two haplotypes identified for
R. tanezumi (RT01 and RT02), seven for R. rattus
(RR01, RR03, RR04, RR05, RR06, RR10 and RR11) and

five for R. norvegicus (RN01, RN02, RN03, RN04 and
RN12). The cyt b gene phylogeny recovered three discrete monophyletic lineages for R. rattus, two for R. norvegicus and one for R. tanezumi, with each lineage being
indicative of a separate introduction. Thus, unlike

invasive R. rattus in Madagascar which rapidly diversified and expanded its range following what appeared to
be a single introduction [33,4], cyt b sequence analyses
of Rattus species from South Africa indicate that, with
the exception of R. tanezumi, at least three R. rattus
and two R. norvegicus introductions have occurred
(Figure 1 and additional file 3, Figure S3). A star-like
radiation of haplotypes, such as that observed for Madagascar [33,4] was only noted for one R. norvegicus lineage and for one R. rattus lineage, indicating that these
two lineages most likely represent the earliest introductions to South Africa.
Comparison of South African Rattus sequence data
with available homologous data for conspecifics revealed

that two of the six Rattus lineage introduced to South
Africa are unrelated and distinct from all other available
haplotypes. In particular, the origin of the cryptic Rattus
species, R. tanezumi remains obscure despite the availability of data from a number of localities within its
native and naturalised ranges (Figure 2) as does the origin of the R. rattus haplotype RR03. The remaining two
R. rattus haplotypes recovered from South Africa were
quite widespread in Africa and its Indian oceanic islands
[4]. Haplotypes RR04 and RR10 from South Africa,
RR05 from South Africa and Guadeloupe, H39 from
Reunion Island and RR07 from Japan, linked by one
mutational step each to the RR06 haplotype which also
occurs in New Zealand, Senegal, Madagascar and to two

specimens from Cape Town, South Africa (Figure 3).
Similarly, the RR01 haplotype identified in South Africa
and which also occurs in Tanzania, Mozambique and
Isle Grande Comore, linked to RR02 from Indonesia by
four mutational steps (see additional file 2, Figure S2)
with high levels of support (Figure 1). Common ancestry
between wild-caught South African R. norvegicus haplotype RN12 and haplotype RN13 was indicated by the
single mutational step separating these haplotypes (Figure 4) and high levels of bootstrap support (Figure 1).
Of interest is that both R. norvegicus lineages in South
Africa revealed links with laboratory strains, viz. RN01
is represented by BN/SsNHsdMCW, whilst the T2DN/
Mcwi strain which corresponds to haplotype RN13 and
is sister to RN12, was also identified in a wild-caught rat
from Japan.
All three Rattus species were sampled in the Gauteng
and KwaZulu-Natal Provinces of north-central and central-eastern South Africa, respectively, but R. norvegicus
has to date, not been found in Limpopo Province in northern South Africa (Table 2; Figure 6a). Although the

distributional range of R. norvegicus does not appear to
extend as far north as the other Rattus species (Figure 6a),
its presence at inland sites in Gauteng Province is significant as previous records indicated that this species was
restricted to coastal areas of South Africa [22]. As R. norvegicus is morphologically, readily distinguished from R.
rattus, and R. tanezumi, on its distinctly large overall body
size alone, it is likely that its presence in the interior of the
country represents a recent incursion and explains why
co-occurrence of all three species has only been found at
one South African site thus far. As viable hybridisation has
been shown to occur between R. rattus and R. tanezumi
[29] it is likely that some degree of introgression is occurring at the five sites at which these species were found to
co-occur in South Africa, and should be investigated
further using nuclear and mitochondrial gene characterisation in combination with karyotyping.
MaxEnt ecological niche modelling based on the combined naturalised and native range of R. tanezumi failed to
predict the known (and presumably recent) invasive range
of the species in the interior of South Africa. Although this

could be partly explained by under-prediction due to the
incomplete sampling of the presumed original native range
(only four records available) compared to the naturalised
range, it is also conceivable that factors other than climate
have facilitated the spread of the species in South Africa. If
it could be shown that South African populations originated from the more temperate, presumed-native range of
the species in Asia, niche similarity could explain its presence in South Africa (as demonstrated by the proximity of
the records in the bioclimatic space in Figure 7). Nevertheless, even within south-eastern Asia the species has spread
from its original native range in more temperate climates,
to invade tropical and equatorial areas extending into the
Philippines and Indonesia, suggesting the importance of
factors other than climate. Given the highly commensal
nature of R. tanezumi, it is noteworthy that records of this
species in South Africa largely coincided with nodes of high
human influence (human footprint; Figure 6a). Given the
extent of historical shipping trade between South Africa
and the Far East, the accidental introduction of R. tanezumi
is easily explained, where after this species has apparently
exploited the commensal niche, using major transport
routes to disperse as far inland as the commercial-industrial

hub of Gauteng Province. The further dispersal of this species to the northern Limpopo Province could be explained
by the presence of the N1 highway and dense rural populations and markets in the Venda region, (where R. tanezumi
was first recorded in South Africa).
The origins of the Rattus species introduced into South
Africa could not be accurately pin-pointed and will remain
obscure until a comprehensive database that includes all
invasive Rattus species from throughout their native and
introduced geographical ranges, becomes available. In this
regard, this study has made a valuable contribution to documenting feral R. norvegicus diversity and distribution, as
only a limited number of complete cyt b haplotype
sequences were available prior to this study (Table 1). The
additional data generated for the five South African R. norvegicus haplotypes and for three wild-caught animals from
Vietnam and Indonesia, contribute to wild-caught R. norvegicus haplotype diversity data and would benefit from
similar studies in all regions in which this invasive species
occurs. The number of full-length reference cyt b gene
sequences for R. rattus has also increased. Despite a larger
number of reference haplotype sequences being available
from the naturalised and native ranges of R. tanezumi [8]

and R. rattus [4], these were insufficient to provide insight
into the likely origin of the R. tanezumi lineage introduced
into South Africa, which differed by a minimum of nine
mutational steps from all available sequences, or for the
R. rattus RR03 lineage. Sampling and sequencing efforts
need to be intensified globally for these three invasive Rattus species in order to map migration pathways more
accurately and to assess factors influencing and limiting
their co-occurrence. Apart from contributing to general
small mammal studies in Africa, the present study may
have implications in epidemiological, agricultural, biological conservation, and invasion biology research associated
with cryptic invasive rodents. It is unlikely that it is only in
South Africa that the presence of R. tanezumi has been
obscured because of its morphological similarity to R. rattus. Genetic monitoring was crucial for detecting this
cryptic invasive species that silently became established
throughout much of the established range of competing
congeners, and is an approach that should be considered
in all areas to which members of the R. rattus species
complex have been introduced.
