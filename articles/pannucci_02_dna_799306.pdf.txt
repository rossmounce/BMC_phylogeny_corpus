Abstract
Background: Complete sequencing and annotation of the 96.2 kb Bacillus anthracis plasmid, pXO2,
predicted 85 open reading frames (ORFs). Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis isolates that
ranged in genomic similarity to B. anthracis, as determined by amplified fragment length
polymorphism (AFLP) analysis, were examined by PCR for the presence of sequences similar to 47
pXO2 ORFs.
Results: The two most distantly related isolates examined, B. thuringiensis 33679 and B. thuringiensis
AWO6, produced the greatest number of ORF sequences similar to pXO2; 10 detected in 33679
and 16 in AWO6. No more than two of the pXO2 ORFs were detected in any one of the remaining
isolates. Dot-blot DNA hybridizations between pXO2 ORF fragments and total genomic DNA
from AWO6 were consistent with the PCR assay results for this isolate and also revealed nine
additional ORFs shared between these two bacteria. Sequences similar to the B. anthracis cap genes
or their regulator, acpA, were not detected among any of the examined isolates.
Conclusions: The presence of pXO2 sequences in the other Bacillus isolates did not correlate
with genomic relatedness established by AFLP analysis. The presence of pXO2 ORF sequences in
other Bacillus species suggests the possibility that certain pXO2 plasmid gene functions may also be
present in other closely related bacteria.

Background
Bacillus anthracis contains a 96.2 kb plasmid, pXO2, that
is required to cause the disease anthrax [1]. Complete sequencing and annotation (GeneMark.hmm) of pXO2 predicted 85 open reading frames (ORFs) [Genbank
accession NC_002146]. Little is known about the identity
and function of pXO2 ORFs beyond the virulence genes
associated with the B. anthracis capsule (dep, capACB,
acpA) [2–5]. The goal of this study was to determine if
many of the novel pXO2 ORFs were unique to B. anthracis,
or were conserved in other closely related Bacillus cereus

and Bacillus thuringiensis isolates. Conservation of plasmid
sequences can provide clues about the origin of the pXO2
plasmid and about potentially conserved gene functions.
Identification of ORFs that are specific to B. anthracis are
potentially useful as markers for detection of the pathogen in clinical and forensic applications.
B. anthracis is a member of the B. cereus/B. thuringiensis
phylogenetic group [6]. The members of this group are
nearly indistinguishable by 16S rDNA analysis [7,8]. Plasmids in the B. cereus/B. thuringiensis isolates vary greatly in

number and size, and many of the phenotypic differences
among B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, and B. anthracis isolates
are conferred by plasmid encoded genes [9–12]. Horizontal plasmid transfer among bacteria, including isolates of
the B. cereus/thuringiensis group has been documented
[12–16].
Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis of over 350 B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, and B. anthracis
isolates, identified several distinct isolate groups [17,18].
Eight of the B. cereus/B. thuringiensis isolates were found to
be very closely related to all B. anthracis isolates and
formed a distinct cluster. In the present study, B. cereus
and B. thuringiensis isolates that vary in AFLP-based genomic relatedness to B. anthracis were examined for the
presence of DNA sequence similar to pXO2, to determine
whether portions of this plasmid are conserved in closely
related Bacillus isolates, and to determine whether the
conservation of pXO2 sequences correlated with genomic
relatedness established by AFLP comparisons [17,18].

Results and Discussion
PCR was performed using template DNA from 11 Bacillus
isolates that vary in relatedness to B. anthracis with primer
sets designed to amplify DNA fragments from 47 different
pXO2 ORFs. This method was chosen to detect sequences
with potential similarity to pXO2 because it is rapid and
the reaction products can be readily sequenced. Table 1
lists the isolates tested, their genomic relatedness to B. anthracis as determined by Jaccard distances calculated from
AFLP profile comparisons [17,18], and the number of
positive PCR reactions obtained for each isolate. DNA sequencing of the amplified PCR products revealed a high

degree of sequence similarity to pXO2 ORFs [Genbank accession numbers AF547271-AF547318]. BLAST (blastn)
e-values were 6 × 10-13 or less for each ORF fragment detected, which corresponded to sequence similarity of 80%
or greater. In a previous study, a similar approach was
used to demonstrate that many of the ORFs from pXO1,
the toxin-encoding plasmid of B. anthracis, were highly
conserved in other isolates from the B. cereus/B. thuringiensis group [19].
The number of plasmid ORFs detected in a Bacillus isolate
did not correlate directly with phylogenetic relationship
to B. anthracis as determined by AFLP. The isolates most
closely related to B. anthracis as determined by AFLP produced no more than two PCR products each. However,
two of the more distantly related isolates, B. thuringiensis
33679 and B. thuringiensis AWO6, produced 10 and 16
positive PCR reactions, respectively. Neither of these isolates is known to be a human or animal pathogen.
Table 2 lists the 47 pXO2 ORFs that were tested in the PCR
assay, their putative functions or similarities to other
genes (blastp), and the PCR results obtained in this experiment. Nineteen different pXO2 ORF fragments were detected among the 11 Bacillus isolates. Eight of the
conserved ORFs were similar to sequences contained in
public databases; 11 were unidentified. The only pXO2
ORFs found in common with the isolates most closely related to B. anthracis (Jaccard distance of 0.55 or less) were
ORFs 47 and 48. These ORFs have sequence similarity to
a conserved hypothetical protein found in several bacterial genera and the tetR family of transcriptional repressors,
respectively.

A 25.3 kb region that contains the capsule-associated
genes has sequence characteristics that are different from
the rest of the plasmid. This region of pXO2 spans nucleotides 48242–73500 and includes ORFs 53 through 65
(13 ORFs). In comparison to the rest of pXO2, this region
has a larger average gene size (818 bases vs. 725 bases), a
lower gene density (0.5 gene vs. 1.0 gene per kb of sequence), and larger average intergenic spaces (1125 bases
vs. 260 bases). The region also has a slightly lower percent
G+C (~28%) than the rest of the plasmid (~31%). Although the region is not bracketed by IS elements or
tRNAs that are characteristic of pathogenicity islands
(PAIs), it bears features that are similar to the putative PAI
identified in the B. anthracis plasmid pXO1 [20]. Bacterial
sequences with similarity to the B. anthracis cap genes are
present in sequence databases. However, the capsule-associated genes (capABC, dep, acpA) were not detected by PCR
in the tested Bacillus isolates. The pXO2 ORF sequences
detected in B. thuringiensis 33679 and B. thuringiensis
AWO6 were distributed across the entire plasmid sequence, except in the 25.3 kb cap gene-containing region,
which appeared to be unique to B. anthracis.
B. thuringiensis strain AWO6 produced the most products
in the PCR assay. A hybridization assay was performed using total genomic DNA from this isolate as a probe against
pXO2 DNA targets amplified using the 47 primer sets
from the PCR assay (Table 3). The hybridization assay
complimented the PCR analysis by identifying nine additional conserved ORF sequences that might not have had
exact matches to the PCR primer sequences. Total genomic DNA from B. thuringiensis strain AWO6 hybridized with
23 pXO2 ORF fragments, including all ORFs tested in the
region between ORF 5 and ORF 38 (Table 3). ORFs in the
25.3 kb pXO2 cap gene-containing region did not hybridize with B. thuringiensis strain AWO6 DNA.
B. thuringiensis AWO6 is a strain containing a 70 kb plasmid designated pAW63 [12,21]. This strain was derived
from B. thuringiensis HD73 by curing of its crystal toxin
bearing plasmid, pHT73 [12,21]. The pAW63 plasmid
contains a replication complex that is classified as a member of the pAMB-1 family of theta replicating plasmids
that are present in a broad range of Gram positive species
[22]. Plasmid pXO2 also appears to be a pAMB1-like theta
replicating plasmid [23] and elements surrounding the
replication complex are present in both pXO2 and pAW63
(see pXO2 ORFs 35, 37, 38, 39 in Tables 2 and 3). ORFs
35, 37, and 38 were sufficiently conserved between pXO2
and pAW63 to allow detection by PCR or hybridization
(see Tables 2 and 3).
Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was used to separate plasmid and chromosomal DNA in B. thuringiensis AWO6,
and a Southern hybridization blot using a mixed pool of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/3/34

pXO2-derived probes (ORFs 6, 10, 50, 63, 72, 81) was
performed to determine if any of the ORFs were present
on the pAW63 plasmid (Figure). A DNA fragment estimated to be 72 kb in size hybridized to the mixed pXO2
probe, which is slightly larger, but within 3% of the reported size of pAW63 (70 kb). This same PFGE protocol
produced a similarly accurate measurement of the size of
the B. anthracis plasmid pXO1 as determined by complete
DNA sequencing [19]. The detection of sequences similar
to pXO2 ORFs on pAW63 suggests that other pXO2 genes,
in addition to those involved with replication, are also located on the pAW63 plasmid.

Conclusions
The presence of pXO2 ORF sequences in 11 Bacillus isolates did not correlate with their genomic relatedness to B.
anthracis as determined by AFLP comparisons. A similar
observation was made in previous work that examined the
conservation of the B. anthracis plasmid pXO1 among
closely related bacteria [19].
This study explored the extent of sequence conservation
between pXO2 ORFs and total DNA from other Bacillus
isolates, and detected similar sequences that may be located on the chromosome or any of several plasmids in each
isolate. The two isolates with the most sequence conservation with pXO2 ORFs, B. thuringiensis isolates 33679 and
AWO6, are known to contain large plasmids [12,19]. Four
ORFs with high sequence similarity to B. thuringiensis
AWO6 plasmid pAW63 were detected [22], and a mixed
pXO2 ORF probe hybridized with a PFGE fragment similar in size to pAW63. The presence of considerable sequence conservation in more distantly related isolates
rather than among close relatives, combined with the observations stated above, is a pattern consistent with the
potential plasmid location of these sequences. Comparative sequence analysis of these large plasmids with pXO2
could determine if the observed sequence conservation
was located on these plasmids.

Methods
Bacterial isolates and DNA isolation
The genomes of the 11 Bacillus isolates selected for study
were found by AFLP analysis to vary in relatedness to B.
anthracis. Isolates with Jaccard distances of less than 0.55
formed a distinct cluster with all of the B. anthracis isolates
(P.J. Jackson, unpublished data) while the other 4 isolates
were present in less closely related clusters (Table 1).

Bacteria were grown in Nutrient Broth (NB; DIFCO Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ) or on NB agar plates at 28°C.
Total DNA (including chromosomal and plasmid DNA)
was extracted as described by Robertson et al. [24] with
slight modifications. Cultures grown for 16 h in Nutrient
Broth were centrifuged into a pellet, washed in TE (10 mM

pXO2 PCR primer sets
Oligonucleotide primer sets were identified for 47 pXO2
ORFs. PCR primer sets were typically positioned 20 to 50
bases from ORF termini unless A/T richness of the DNA
sequence prohibited the design of primers in that region.
Primer sequences are located at http://bdiv.lanl.gov/databases/databases.html. The remaining 38 pXO2 ORFs were
not included in the present survey due to sub-optimal A/
T richness, amplicon size, and thermodynamic characteristics of the candidate primer sets.

Perkin Elmer PCR buffer with 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.8 mM
each dNTP, 1.25 U AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin
Elmer), and 45 µM of each primer. A PTC-200 Peltier
Thermocycler (MJ Research, Watertown, MA) was used for
35-cycle reactions (94°C, 2 min for first cycle only; 94°C,
30 s.; 48°C, 30 s.; 72°C, 30 s). Reactions were resolved on
2% agarose gels that were stained with ethidium bromide
and viewed using a UV trans-illuminator. A reaction was
considered positive if the amplified fragment was abundant and was the expected size DNA fragment.

PCR assays and amplicon sequencing
PCR assays to detect each of the 47 individual pXO2 ORFs
were conducted using DNA from each bacterial isolate
(Table 1) as template. Fifty µl PCR reactions contained 1X

The majority of PCR products were sequenced using dyeterminator chemistry (ABI Prism FS, PE Applied Biosystems, Boston, MA). Sequencing primers were the same as
those used in PCR amplification reactions. Sequencing re-

actions were resolved on 48 cm polyacrylamide gels (4%,
19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide, Bio-Rad Laboratories) using an ABI model 373 fluorescence sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). DNA sequence was analyzed using
Lasergene software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI). Sequences were deposited in GenBank as accession numbers
AF547271 to AF547318.
Hybridization assay
A dot-blot hybridization assay was performed using DNA
from B. thuringiensis strain AWO6 as probe against PCRamplified pXO2 ORF DNA applied to a nylon membrane.
Ten ng of each pXO2 ORF fragment was denatured by
adding 0.1 volume of 1 M NaOH and incubation for 5
min at 37°C. An equal volume of 20X SSC (3 M NaCl, 0.3
M sodium citrate, adjusted to pH 7.0 with 1 M HCl) was
added and samples were quickly placed on ice for 2 min.
The DNA was then applied to a Hybond-N+ membrane
(Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) pre-soaked in 10X SSC
using a HYBRI-DOT Manifold (Life Technologies, Inc.,
Rockville, MD). The membrane was exposed to 1200
mjoules of ultraviolet light in a UV-STRATALINKER 1800
(STRATAGENE, LaJolla, CA) to crosslink DNA to the
membrane. Total DNA extracted from B. thuringiensis
AWO6 was used to synthesize probe by incorporating [α32P]dCTP (6000 µCi/mMol) (NEN, Boston, MA) into randomly primed DNA synthesis reactions using the Megaprime DNA Labeling System (Amersham-Pharamacia
Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer
instructions. The membrane was incubated at 50°C in hybridization buffer (0.5 M NaHPO4, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0,
7% SDS [28]) for 60 min, followed by hybridization with
probe for 16 h at 50°C. After hybridization, the membrane was washed twice for 10 min at 30°C in 2X SSC
containing 0.1% SDS and twice for 10 min at 45°C in
0.2X SSC containing 0.1% SDS. Results were viewed using
a Fugi Phosphorimager.
Pulsed-field gel-electrophoresis (PFGE)
A 15 ml culture of B. thuringiensis AWO6 was grown in NB
overnight at 37°C with shaking. Chloramphenicol was
added at a concentration of 180 µg/ml and the culture was
incubated for 60 min. Cells were incubated on ice for 10
min, then centrifuged at 2500 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets
were suspended in 1 ml TE buffer that contained 2 mg/ml
lysozyme and incubated for 5 min at 37°C. Lysozymetreated cells were washed in 1 ml of Buffer NT (1 M NaCl,
50 mM Tris pH 7.5) and were suspended in Buffer NT to
a final volume of 200 µl.

Agarose plugs containing bacterial cells were prepared in
a 1 ml syringe by combining cells with an equal volume
of 2% SeaKem Gold agarose (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) melted in water. Plugs were allowed to solidify
at 4°C for 2 h. Thin agarose slices (1–3 mm) containing

embedded bacteria were incubated for 16 h in 500 µl Buffer NTE (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM
EDTA pH 8.0) containing 2% lysozyme at 37°C. The lysozyme/Buffer NTE solution was replaced with Buffer NTE
that contained 2 mg/ml Proteinase K and incubated for 16
h at 50°C. Slices were then incubated in Buffer NTES (100
mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 1%
SDS) for 16 h at 50°C. Before electrophoresis, slices were
incubated twice for 30 min in 1.0 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (Sigma. St. Louis, MO) diluted in
TE and twice in 0.5X TBE (45 mM Tris-borate (1:1), 1 mM
EDTA).
Treatment of agarose slices linearized the plasmid DNA
and allowed for plasmid size determination using a concatomerized bacteriophage lambda standard (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) (5). DNA from agarose slices
was resolved on a gel of 1% SeaKem Gold agarose melted
in 0.5X TBE. Electrophoresis conditions were 175 V in
0.5X TBE at 6°C for 21 h in a CHEF-DR II Pulsed Field
Electrophoresis System (BIORAD, Hercules, CA) with a
field switch ramp of 5 to 40 s. Gels were stained with
ethidium bromide and viewed using a UV trans-illuminator.
Southern hybridization
The pulsed field gel was sequentially soaked in 0.25 N
HCl for 30 min; 3 M NaCl, 0.4 M NaOH for 60 min; and
0.5X TBE for 15 min. Electro-transfer of the DNA to a nylon membrane was performed using a Mini Trans-Blot
Electrophoretic Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer instructions. DNA was
crosslinked to the membrane by exposure to 1200
mjoules of ultraviolet light in a UV-STRATALINKER 1800
(STRATAGENE, LaJolla, CA). The membrane containing
B. thuringiensis AWO6 DNA was hybridized using a [α32P]dCTP-labeled probe prepared from a mixture of six
PCR-amplified pXO2 ORF fragments (pXO2 ORFs 6, 10,
50, 63, 72, 81). Care was taken to avoid the IS elements
present on the plasmid. Probe synthesis, hybridization
conditions, and wash regimen were performed as described above for hybridization reactions. Results were
viewed using a Fugi Phosphorimager.

Authors' Contributions
JP was responsible for experimental design, protocols, and
data management. RTO designed the pXO2 oligonucleotides. EW performed PCR reactions and DNA sequencing. RS conducted the hybridization reactions and DNA
sequencing. LOT provided AFLP data and statistical analysis. CRK was the principal investigator who began the
study and coordinated the work. All authors contributed
to preparation of this manuscript.
