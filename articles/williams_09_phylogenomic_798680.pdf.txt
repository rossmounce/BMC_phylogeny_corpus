Background
The divergence of protein function following gene duplication – or the colonization of new ecological niches – is of
central importance in the evolution of novelty. Changes in
protein structure and function are reflected at the level of
amino acid sequence. This principle suggests that lineagespecific functional divergence in proteins can be identified
by the analysis of primary sequence data. However, many
amino acid substitutions have a negligible effect on
protein function. This means that a simple comparison
of the sequence differences between two clusters of
proteins will not reveal the subset of changes responsible
for functional divergence. While several methods to
identify these biologically important substitutions exist
[1], they are not optimized for analyses of large numbers of
protein sequences. Here, we present a fast new method for
identifying these substitutions across a large phylogenetic
tree.

Materials and methods
Our method requires a bifurcating phylogenetic tree and
a protein sequence alignment. Each node on the tree
is defined by two downstream clades and one or more
outgroup sequences. Using BLOSUM [2] scores to quantify
how radical or conservative substitutions in each clade are
relative to the outgroup, we assign a score to each column
of the alignment at each tree node, which is then tested for

Bacterial lineages enriched for functional divergence
in GroEL. The thermosome-related sequences are found in
certain extremophilic bacteria, perhaps as a result of
horizontal gene transfer from archaea. The other highlighted
lineages are intracellular pathogens, with the exception of
Chloroflexi. The tree was produced by RAxML [6].

significance [3]. Here, we apply our method to a tree of the
GroEL genes from 622 bacterial genomes.

Results
GroEL is an important molecular chaperone which helps
at least 250 client proteins fold in Escherichia coli [4].
Interestingly, we found that four out of the five bacterial
lineages most enriched for functional divergence are
intracellular pathogens (see Figure 1). Radical change in
GroEL has previously been implicated in the adaptation
of endosymbiotic bacteria to intracellular life [5], and
these results suggest this may be a more general response
to the population-genetic conditions of an intracellular
lifestyle.
