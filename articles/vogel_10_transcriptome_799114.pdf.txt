Transcriptome analysis of the sex pheromone
gland of the noctuid moth Heliothis virescens
Heiko Vogel1, Andrew J Heidel2, David G Heckel1, Astrid T Groot1*

Abstract
Background: The chemical components of sex pheromones have been determined for more than a thousand
moth species, but so far only a handful of genes encoding enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of these
compounds have been identified. For understanding the evolution of moth sexual communication, it is essential to
know which genes are involved in the production of specific pheromone components and what controls the
variation in their relative frequencies in the pheromone blend. We used a transcriptomic approach to characterize
the pheromone gland of the Noctuid moth Heliothis virescens, an important agricultural pest, in order to obtain
substantial general sequence information and to identify a range of candidate genes involved in the pheromone
biosynthetic pathway.
Results: To facilitate identifying sets of genes involved in a broad range of processes and to capture rare
transcripts, we developed our majority of ESTs from a normalized cDNA library of Heliothis virescens pheromone
glands (PG). Combining these with a non-normalized library yielded a total of 17,233 ESTs, which assembled into
2,082 contigs and 6,228 singletons. Using BLAST searches of the NR and Swissprot databases we were able to
identify a large number of putative unique gene elements (unigenes), which we compared to those derived from
previous transcriptomic surveys of the larval stage of Heliothis virescens. The distribution of unigenes among GO
Biological Process functional groups shows an overall similarity between PG and larval transcriptomes, but with
distinct enrichment of specific pathways in the PG. In addition, we identified a large number of candidate genes in
the pheromone biosynthetic pathways.
Conclusion: These data constitute one of the first large-scale EST-projects for Noctuidae, a much-needed resource
for exploring these pest species. Our analysis shows a surprisingly complex transcriptome and we identified a large
number of potential pheromone biosynthetic pathway and immune-related genes that can be applied to
population and systematic studies of Heliothis virescens and other Noctuidae.

Background
Moth sexual communication has been a major research
focus for understanding the evolution of prezygotic isolation [1-7]. This is because moth sexual communication
is primarily chemical, and thus variation at the chemical
level provides the basis for evolutionary change. The
females produce and emit pheromone from a specialized
structure, the sex pheromone gland (PG) at the tip of
their abdomen [8-10], while the males perceive and
respond to these pheromones from a distance [11].
Since the first identification of the sex pheromone in
Bombyx mori [12], sex pheromones and attractants of

about 1,600 moth species have been chemically identified [13]. Most moth pheromone components are evennumbered C10-C18 straight-chain, unsaturated derivatives of fatty acids, with the carbonyl carbon modified to
form an oxygen-containing functional group (alcohol,
aldehyde, or acetate ester) [14,15]. Species-specificity of
female pheromone blend production is the result of the
combination of two or more compounds and the ratio
between them. Males also exhibit species-specificity in
the behavioral attraction to this particular blend [2,4].
The biosynthetic pathways of many sex pheromones
have been partly elucidated [14,16-18]. Free saturated
fatty acids are produced de novo and converted to their
acyl-CoA thioesters before being incorporated into glycerolipids or converted to pheromone [19]. Despite

knowledge of the chemical intermediates, only a few
enzymes in the biosynthetic pathways have been identified and characterized. Most emphasis has been on the
identification and characterization of desaturases,
enzymes that introduce a double bond at a specific position in the carbon chain. So far Δ9, Δ10, Δ11, Δ12 and
Δ14 desaturases have been identified [20-24]. In addition, a fatty acid reductase has been identified in Bombyx mori [25]. For understanding the evolution of moth
sexual communication it is essential to know which
genes are involved in the production of specific pheromone components and the variation in blend ratios.
The sex pheromone of Heliothis virescens (Fabricius
1777) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is well-defined and consists of Z11-16:Ald as the major component, Z9-14:Ald
as the secondary critical component, without which conspecific males are not attracted, and a few other minor
components (16:Ald, Z7-16:Ald, Z9-16:Ald, Z11-16:OH),
the roles of which roles are less clear [26-32]. We
recently found geographic as well as temporal variation
in this pheromone blend [33], which may be due to
genetic variation.
The identification of genes that are expressed in the
pheromone gland of H. virescens is not only useful for a
fundamental understanding of moth sex pheromone
evolution, but also from an applied perspective. Heliothis
virescens is a major agricultural pest in a number of
crops in North and South America. Pheromone traps
are widely used in the US cotton belt to monitor H. virescens populations [34-37], and in Mexico [38]. The trap
capture data have been used in many integrated pest
management programs to determine if and when insecticide applications are needed. However, the extensive
use of such traps may select for a shift in pheromone
composition in local populations and thereby reduce
trap efficiency [39]. Identifying the genes causing variation in pheromone signals can aid in delaying or even
circumventing such adaptation.
We have taken two complementary approaches to
identifying moth pheromone genes. One starts with the
phenomenology of pheromone differences between different species, and attempts to find the genes responsible for these. We have investigated the genetic basis of
sex pheromone variation within and between two closely
related moth species, H. virescens (Hv) and H. subflexa
(Hs) using quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis
[40,41]. We found 8 QTL that explained a significant
proportion of the variance of 9 pheromone components.
By considering how each QTL affects the overall blend,
we generated a list of candidate genes that may underlie
these QTL by linking the genomic regions to the biosynthetic pathway of the different sex pheromone components of the two species [40]. We have illlustrated
this approach in the context of a recent review of the

predominant pathways of Lepidoptera sex pheromone
biosynthesis [42].
The other approach to identifying genes controlling
the chemical communication system of moths starts
with a large set identified on the basis of expression in
the pheromone gland, and attempts to narrow this
down to subsets that could be directly involved in biosynthesis and emission of the blend. Here we describe
the construction and analysis of cDNA libraries made
from Hv PG and associated tissues, which we compare
to a) larval Hv libraries to identify genes that do not
have an exclusive pheromone function, and b) PG
libraries from other moth species to identify genes that
might. To illustrate the context of these comparisons,
we provide a brief description of PG structure.
The pheromone gland is intimately associated with the
ovipositor at the end of the adult female abdomen. The
gland itself consists of a band-like single layer of epithelial cells that encircles the lower part of the eighth
abdominal segment and the upper part of the ninth and
last abdominal segment (Figure 1). These cells synthesize, store and release pheromone components in
response to hormonal stimulation [8,9,19,43]. The outer
surface of this band is covered with a thin cuticle densely packed with fine hairlike projections through which
the pheromone is expelled [9]. The apical surfaces of
the epithelial PG cells are elaborated into short microvilli pressing against the inner surface of this cuticle.
When the abdomen is fully extended, the entire outer
surface is exposed to the outside; when retracted, the
layer is folded over itself and covered by the sclerotized
upper half of the eighth abdominal segment [9]. The
basal PG cell surfaces are underlain by a basement
membrane separating the band of cells from the posterior end of the hemocoel cavity. Encircled by and passing
through the band of glandular cells are the oviduct and
the posterior section of the digestive tract, sheathed in
muscle and connective tissue. The sclerotized end of the
ninth abdominal segment is the ovipositor, which surrounds the ovipore and the anus.
To identify genes that could be involved in pheromone biosynthesis, we constructed normalized and nonnormalized cDNA libraries of the pheromone gland plus
ovipositor of H. virescens. In total we identified 8,310
gene objects. Comparing this database with a Hv larval
tissue library, we found 6,435 gene objects that were
unique to the PG libraries. We compared these to an
EST collection from Agrotis segetum PG [44] and to a
set of unpublished PG sequences from Bombyx mori
deposited in GenBank. With the characterization of
>8000 expressed gene objects and the comparisons
between the different libraries, we can now list 86 candidate genes encoding classes of enzymes involved in the
biosynthetic pathway of moth sex pheromone

production. In addition, in the pheromone gland we
found evidence for 27 genes that might be involved in
pheromone perception and degradation, and a surprisingly high number (34) of antimicrobial effector genes
involved in immune defense.

Results
Overall description of the sequences

The average insert size of the cDNAs of the Hv pheromone gland library that were cloned and sequenced was
1,100 bp, yielding a total of 6,554 ESTs, which after
assembly resulted in a total of 2,692 contiguous
sequences (contigs) and 1,799 singletons represented by
a single EST (HvPGNoN; Table 1). After normalization,
an additional 10,679 clones were sequenced, which
resulted in an additional 6,772 putative gene objects
(HvPGN). Combined, the non-normalized and normalized cDNA library (denoted as HvPG hereafter) resulted
in a total of 2,082 contigs and 6,228 singletons. These
sequences were subjected to a protein translated blastx
search and a gene ontology (GO) analysis using Blast2GO [45]. 4,260 Sequences (52%) matched described
sequences in Genbank (NR database; E-value cut-off of
10-3). Nearly half of the sequences (4,110) had no
BLAST result (Table 1), indicating a high number of
Lepidopteran or species-specific transcripts [46] or long
UTRs without open reading frames. However, our
method was based on directional cloning of full-length
enriched cDNAs and 5’end-sequencing of the cDNAs.
This strategy has potentially great advantages, as according to our findings, 5’ UTRs in moths are generally
much shorter on average (often < 100 bp; personal
observation) than the 3’ UTRs. For the majority of ESTs
for which we could not obtain any hits to Genbank

sequences we were still able to obtain open reading
frames and InterPro scan results.
The average insert size of the cDNAs from mixed larval stages of H. virescens (the HvLN library) was 1,100
bp, similar to HvPG. The sequenced clones yielded a
total of 10,511 sequences, which assembled to a total of
7,822 gene objects, 6,174 (79%) of which were singletons. Slightly more than half of these (4,302) showed a
significant sequence similarity to sequences in the GenBank nr protein database, while the remaining 3,520 did
not (Table 1).
The most highly expressed genes in the non-normalized portion of HvPG encoded proteins involved in general cellular homeostasis, like cell cytoskeleton and
cellular organization (actins, tubulin), muscle proteins
(myosin, tropomyosin), ribosomal proteins, and mitochondrial respiratory chain and ATP synthase proteins
(see Additional file 1). Yet many of the top 250 highly
expressed genes had no significant BLAST hit, which
likely reflects the shallow genome coverage and annotation in the NCBI Insecta database.
Comparisons of cDNA libraries

When we compared the EST dataset of HvPG to the
ESTs generated from Hv larval tissue, 6,435 of the 8,310
sequences (i.e. 77%) were not found in HvLN. We will
refer to this dataset as HvPG_minus_HvLN. Of these
6,435 sequences, only 41% (2,691) yielded high-score
hits to public databases, while the majority (3,763, 59%)
did not show any homology. The relatively high percentage of sequences with no significant homology to public databases indicates that many pheromone glandspecific genes have not been identified yet, similarly to
what was found by Strandh et al. [44] in Agrotis
segetum.

Strandh et al. [44] constructed a cDNA library from
the pheromone gland of Agrotis segetum and deposited
707 EST sequences in GenBank (accession numbers
ES582156-ES584441). Assembling these sequences using
the same procedure as described above resulted in a
total of 431 contigs. We will refer to this dataset as
AsPG. A total of 154 sequence homologies (best bidirectional hits) were found between this database and HvPG
and BmPG (Figure 2).
From Bombyx mori we assembled a collection of
sequences that from 12,296 ESTs that were deposited in
Genbank (GenBank Acc: AV403746-AV404455,
BP182009-BP184340, DC545768-DC550742, EL928418EL930129) and identified as originating from the pheromone gland of B. mori (we refer to this dataset as
BmPG). Assembling these sequences using the same
procedure and threshold settings as for HvPG and
HvLN resulted in a total of 3,947 gene objects, 2,153
(55%) of which were singletons. For all gene objects that
we describe here as candidate genes for pheromone biosynthesis, we deposited sequences in the TSA section of
Genbank (GenBank Acc: EZ407129-EZ407280). Of this
dataset, 69% (2,749 sequences) had homology to
sequences in the public database (NCBI nr). When comparing the sequences of BmPG with HvPG, we found
homology between 1,448 sequences (best bidirectional
hits) between the two datasets (see Figure 2).
Assignment of putative gene functions using Gene
Ontology

For functional comparisons, all sequences were subjected
to Gene Ontology (GO) analysis in Blast2GO, where we
classified all gene objects in Biological Function level 3
(Figure 3). To minimize the number of classes with only
few gene objects, we set the minimum number of gene
objects (cut-off level) in a class to 2% of the total number
of sequences that could be classified. In this comparison
AsPG was excluded, because the AsPG EST dataset

contained relatively few total sequences compared to
HvPG, HvLN, HvPG_minus_HvLN, and BmPG.
Of the 4,260 sequences in the HvPG cDNA library
with matches in the Genbank non-redundant (nr) protein database, 2,501 (59%) could be classified into GOlevel 3, with each class containing at least 50 sequences
(2% of 2501). Of the 4,302 HvLN sequences with highscore hits, 1,979 (46%) were classified into GO-level 3,
with at least 41 sequences in each class. Of the 2,691
HvPG_minus_HvLN sequences, 1,929 (72%) were classified into GO-level 3. The classes containing at least 41
sequences are shown in Figure 3. Of the 2,749 BmPG
sequences that showed homology to Genbank entries,
1,663 (60%) were classified into GO-level 3, with each
class containing at least 36 sequences.
Figure 3 shows a total of 34 GO level-3 classes into
which the gene objects were classified. Most occurred in
Cellular metabolic process, Macromolecule metabolic
process and Primary metabolic process (each with 1020% of the total), followed by the classes Biosynthetic
process, Cellular component organization and biogenesis, and Transport (each with about 5%). Three classes
were absent in HvLN, but present in the other three
libraries: Anatomical structure morphogenesis, Generation of precursor metabolites and energy, and Regulation of biological quality. The three classes Defense
response, Immune responses and Response to biotic stimulus were only found in HvPG and HvPG_minus_HvLN, and thus did not occur (above the threshold
level) in BmPG or in HvLN. The two classes, Cell cycle
and Postembryonic development, were found only in
HvPG_minus_HvLN and BmPG, while Cellular homeostasis and Establishment of protein localization were
uniquely found in BmPG. Four classes were uniquely
found in HvPG_minus_HvLN: Cell cycle process,
Response to chemical stimulus, Response to other
organisms, and Sexual reproduction.

databases. Percentages are given of the relative number of overlapping contigs compared to the total number of contigs found in the
pheromone gland (colors match the species colors).

The main contributor to the class of Immune
responses was the class of antimicrobial peptides
(AMPs). Insects produce a variety of AMPs with antibacterial and antifungal activity, including the insect
defensins, cecropins, attacin-like proteins, lysozyme and
proline-rich peptides [47-49]. In the HvPG we have
identified a large number of AMPs, among which the
cecropin gene family (10 genes), the gloverins (6 genes)
and the moricin-like sequences (5 genes) are especially
prominent (see Table 2). In addition to many newly
identified AMP genes, in our pheromone gland library
we were also able to identify all of the published antibacterial and antifungal proteins from Heliothis virescens, such as attacin [50], heliomicin [51], virescin
(P83416), heliocin (P83427), lysozyme [52] and several
cecropins (cecropins-A (P83413), -B (P83414), -C
(P83415)).
Control of pheromone production and release

Pheromone production in the PG is stimulated by Pheromone Biosynthesis Activating Neuropeptide (PBAN)
that is released from the suboesophagal ganglion in the
brain to the hemolymph, after which it binds to the

PBAN receptor in the membrane of the pheromone
gland [43,53,54]. The PBAN receptor in the PG has
been characterized as a G-protein-coupled receptor in
B. mori by Hull et al. [53] (AB181298) and cloned from
H. virescens by Kim et al. [55]. We found none of the
three isoforms reported by that group (EU000525,
EU000526, EU000527) in HvPG. EZ407266, occurring in
HvPG but not HvLN, shows homology to a G-protein
coupled receptor but is more similar to the diapause
hormone receptor of B. mori (BAE93495). EZ407267
corresponds to a G-protein gamma subunit homologue,
also found by Strandh et al. (AS12G05-D2), which they
hypothesized to interact with the PBAN receptor.
Juvenile hormone has been shown to be an important
regulator of pheromone induction in cockroaches [56],
and bark beetles [57], but its role in the reproductive
behavior in Lepidoptera has not yet been clearly defined
[17]. In some species it likely influences the circadian
release of PBAN [58], in others it may up-regulate the
PBAN-receptor protein in the pheromone gland [59]. In
HvPG (but not HvLN) we found two JH binding proteins, EZ407156 and EZ407196: the latter was also

is classified into 2 classes. Asterisks denote absence in one of the libraries in the respective GO category.

found in BmPG and AsPG (see Figure 4). Finding these
sequences specifically in the pheromone gland suggests
that they may play a role in the binding of PBAN to its
receptor [59].
Biosynthetic pathways of sex pheromone production

Considering the putative biosynthetic pathways of sex
pheromone production in moths (Figure 5), we identified 70 candidate genes from the HvPG library that are
likely to play a role (see Table 3 and Figure 4). Each
enzyme in this pathway is categorized (a) through (h) to
facilitate the comparisons between Table 2 Figures 5
and 4. Genes that have not been specifically described
as being part of the pathways so far, but which may also
be involved, are categorized as x1-x8. The list of contigs
were compared against the other databases using reciprocal blast searches to identify which of the contigs are
unique to HvPG (i.e. do not occur in HvLN; the
HvPG_minus_HvLN database), and/or are also found in
BmPG andAsPG (see Figure 4).
(a) Acetyl CoA carboxylase (EC:6.4.1.2)

EZ407143 in HvPG matched sequences in the public
database described as Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase).
This enzyme catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation
of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA in the rate-limiting step
of long chain fatty acid biosynthesis [60]. A search in
NCBI for “Acetyl CoA Carboxylase AND Lepidoptera”
returned a sequence from Heliothis virescens (CS239503,
Sequence 1 from Patent EP1607477-A 1) which is identical to EZ407143. This contig also showed high
sequence similarity to ACCases described in other
insects (Drosophila melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura,
Nasonia vitripennis, Apis mellifera and the moth Cydia
pomonella) and mammals. An alignment of the ACCase
sequences from insects and vertebrates shows an overall
very high sequence similarity (Figure 6). Amino acid
sequence identity between H. virescens and H. sapiens is

Malonyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, and NADPH are utilized in
fatty acid synthesis by the multifunctional enzyme Fatty
Acid Synthase (FAS). Labeling studies with acetate
demonstrated that the principal end products of FAS in
most lepidopteran PGs are palmitic acid (16:0) and stearic acid (18:0) [61-63]. We found three contigs (see
Table 3) that showed high sequence similarity with
described insect FAS in Genbank (in Drosophila, Aedes,
and Nasonia) as well as FAS of chicken and Mus musculus. In addition, EZ407268 was described in Blast2Go
as ‘elongation of very long chain fatty acids’ (based on
the top BLAST hits of the nr database entries). All four
contigs were absent from HvLN. We did not find any
significant hits of these four HvPG sequences to any of
the BmPG or AsPG ESTs using reciprocal blast
searches, which again is most likely due to the lower
number of transcripts identified in these libraries.
(c) Desaturases (EC:1.14.19)

In pheromone biosynthesis, double bonds are introduced into the fatty acid chain by a variety of desaturases, which have been classified into groups based on
signature motifs, and extensively characterized biochemically [21]. Two contigs were identified as putative
Δ11-desaturase, while 7 were identified as putative Δ9desaturases and EZ407189 was identified as a desaturase
with the signature motif of VPAE (Table 3). It is not
surprising to find a number of Δ9-desaturases, because
they also occur commonly in animal and fungal tissues
[22]. However, EZ407154 was the only Δ9-desaturase
that was also found in the transcriptome of HvLN, the
other sequences were only found in HvPG. Two groups
of Δ9-desaturases have been identified and characterized
in pheromone glands of moth species: one with a substrate preference of C16 > C 18 (called NPVE), and the
other with a substrate preference of C18 > C16 (referred
to as KPSE) [21,24]. Three contigs resembled predicted
amino acid sequences of characterized desaturase genes
displaying an NPVE signature motif, while the other 4
contigs resembled Δ9-desaturase sequences in other
insects but did not contain the signature motif of either
NPVE or KPSE. Specifically, EZ407263 and EZ407218
most closely resembled Δ9-desaturase in H. zea
(AAF81790), EZ407204 mostly resembled the Δ9-desaturase of Lampronia capitella (ABX71627), while

of H. zea. One of the Δ11-desaturases (EZ407237) and
one of the Δ9-desaturases (EZ407263) were found in
BmPG and AsPG as well and may thus be involved in
the biosynthetic pathway of pheromone production in
all of these species. For example, EZ407237 resembles a

sequence from AsPG (AS12G02_D9), which was 84-fold
upregulated compared to the As-body library [64].
(d) Fatty acyl reductase (EC:1.2.1.-)

There is evidence for two routes of aldehyde pheromone
biosynthesis in moths. The fatty acyl CoA pheromone
precursor may be reduced to the corresponding alcohol
by an alcohol-generating Fatty Acyl Reductase (FAR)
and then oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde by an
alcohol oxidase, i.e. dehydrogenase [17]. Alternatively,
fatty acyl CoA may be reduced directly to aldehydes by
aldehyde-generating FARs. We found five contigs resembling FAR, only one of which (EZ407211) was also
found in HvLN (Figure 4). Phylogenetic analysis of the
FAR sequences identified in H. virescens and of a subset
of fatty-acyl-reductases in Lepidoptera and other insects
(Figure 7) indicate that the H. virescens EZ407233 can
be grouped with FARs from pheromone glands of B.
mori and Ostrinia scapulalis. The alcohol-generating
FAR from B. mori was shown by functional expression
to produce the pheromone bombykol from its precursor

[25]. The FAR-XIII gene of O. scapulalis was the only
one of 13 specifically expressed in the pheromone gland
[65]. EZ407233 is specifically expressed in the pheromone gland as well (Groot and Barthel, unpubl. res).
(e) Aldehyde reductase and (f) Alcohol oxidase (EC:1.1.1.2)

Whether aldehyde reductases first produce aldehydes
which are then converted to alcohols, or vice versa, is very
difficult to prove, because aldehyde reductases can also
catalyze the reduction of the fatty aldehyde to the alcohol,
so alcohols and not aldehydes are the major products [66].
The reverse reaction is catalyzed through alcohol oxidases,
and both enzymes are more generally described as alcohol
dehydrogenases. The systematic name of this group of
enzymes is alcohol:NADP+ oxidoreductase, oxidizing alcohols using NAPD+ (alcohol + NADP(+) <=> aldehyde +
NADPH). Some enzymes in this group oxidize only primary alcohols, while others act also on secondary alcohols.
This group of enzymes may be identical to glucuronate
reductase (EC 1.1.1.19), mevaldate reductase (EC 1.1.1.33)
and lactaldehyde reductase (EC 1.1.1.55). Two contigs

were named aldehyde reductase in Blast2GO, one of
which (EZ407251) did not occur in the HvLN transcriptome, while five contigs were named alcohol dehydrogenase, three of which were uniquely present in the HvPG
transcriptome (see Figure 4). None of these sequences
were found in BmPG or AsPG.
(g) Acetyltransferase (EC:2.3.1.16)

In general, synthesis of phospholipids can occur de novo
or via remodeling of the existing phospholipids, and the
biosynthesis of triglycerides (a form of energy storage in
cells) is an end product of these pathways [19]. In animals members of the 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate
acyltransferase family (AGPATs; EC:2.3.1.51) have been
shown to transfer unsaturated fatty acyl groups. Several
AGPATs acylate lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) at the carbon-2 position to produce phosphatidic acid (PA).
These enzymes are involved in phospholipid and triglyceride synthesis through an evolutionary conserved

process involving serial acylations of glycerol-3-phosphate (Acyl-CoA + 1-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate <=>
CoA + 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 3phosphate; http://www.
expasy.org/enzyme/2.3.1.51). We found four distinct
sequences similar to AGPATs, of which only one was
also found in the transcriptome of HvLN, whereas the
others were only found in the HvPG library. One of the
sequences that was present in HvPG but absent in
HvLN (EZ407256) was found in BmPG as well. In addition, three distinct putative acetyl-CoA-acyltransferase
sequences were found in HvPG, two of which were not
found in HvLN. This functional class of enzymes potentially converts fatty alcohols to acetate esters in pheromone glands and has been biochemically characterized
in C. fumiferana [15] and Argyrotaenia velutinana [67].
Remarkably, no acetyltransferase genes have been cloned
from moth pheromone glands so far, although acetate
esters are common pheromone components.

(h) Acetate (acetyl) esterase (EC:3.1)

Esterases are hydrolases, and hydrolysis of esters occurs
during pheromone synthesis and degradation [68-70].
Acetate esterases in pheromone glands have been shown
to be active biochemically in C. fumiferana [15],
Hydraecia micacea, H. virescens and H. subflexa [71]. In
H. subflexa three acetates are components of the pheromone blend [72-75], which render it unattractive to H.
virescens males [3,32]. Acetates have never been found
in the pheromone gland of Hv, and Teal and Tumlinson
[71] suggested that acetate esterase converts the acetates
into alcohols as rapidly as they are produced in H. virescens, but not in H. subflexa. We found four esterases in
HvPG, two of which were not found in HvLN. All four
contigs were also found in BmPG.
(i) Lipase (EC 3.1.1.3)

Some of the fatty acids incorporated into pheromones
may be liberated from pre-existing phospholipids and
triglycerides by cleavage by lipases, to supplement fatty
acid synthesis de novo [19]. Most insect lipases fall into
two categories, acidic (so named due to similarity to
mammalian gastric lipases which function at acidic pH)
and neutral (similar to mammalian pancreatic lipases)
[76]. We found five neutral lipases (EZ407271,
EZ407272, EZ407274, EZ407275, and EZ407276), and
five acidic lipases (EZ407273, EZ407277, EZ407278,
EZ407279, and EZ407280) in HvPG. Horne et al. [76]
suggested that the lipase encoded by AV403884, an EST
from B. mori pheromone gland was involved in liberation of fatty acids for pheromone precursors; this is
most similar to our EZ407279 from HvPG.
(x1) Acyl-CoA Thioesterasesl Long-chain fatty-acyl-CoA
hydrolase (EC:3.1.2.2)

Acyl-CoA thioesterases (also known as acyl-CoA hydrolases) are a group of enzymes that hydrolyze CoA esters

to free CoA and carboxylic acids. Substrates can be a
range of diverse molecules such as acyl-CoAs (which
can either be saturated, unsaturated, or branched-chain),
CoA esters of prostaglandins, bile acid CoAs etc. AcylCoA thioesterases have important functions in lipid
metabolism and in regulating the levels of free CoA and
various CoA esters in the cell, and have been found in
the cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes [77,78] The
thioesterase sequences we identified were most similar
to palmitoyl-protein thioesterase (EZ407260) and acylprotein thioesterase (EZ407220). EZ407260 was not
found in HvLN, while EZ407220 was found in the
HvLN as well as in BmPG (see Figure 4).
(x2) Aldehyde oxidase/dehydrogenase (EC:1.2.1.3)

This group of enzymes catalyze the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids. Therefore they may also be
involved in the synthesis or degradation of pheromone
compounds in the pheromone gland, specifically in the
conversion of aldehydes to carboxylic acids (stearic acid
and/or palmitic acid) (Figure 5). A total of 14 distinct
sequences that were categorized as aldehyde dehydrogenase were present in HvPG, 11 of which were not
found in HvLN. Four of these sequences were also
found in BmPG.
(x3) Short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase
(EC:1.1.1.1)

The short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases family
(SDR) is a very large family of enzymes, most of which
are known to be NAD(P)- dependent oxidoreductases.
This superfamily consists of a phylogenetically related
group of enzymes that act on substrates as diverse as
steroids, fatty acids, sugars, aromatic hydrocarbons, antibiotics, and compounds involved in nitrogen metabolism
[79]. The Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase belongs to
this group of enzymes, and as it was the first member of

Vogel et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:29
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/29

this family to be characterized, the SDR family used to
be called ‘insect-type’, or ‘short-chain’ alcohol dehydrogenases. Since a number of dehydrogenases or reductases are likely to be involved in the moth pheromone
biosynthetic pathway (as described above) we have
included this generic group of enzymes in our list of
candidate genes (Figure 4). We found a total of 7 distinct sequences in HvPG, two of which were not unique
to this dataset, i.e. EZ407177 and EZ407232. One of the
SDR sequences, EZ407219, was also found in BmPG.
(x4) Acyl-CoA oxidase (EC:1.3.3.6), Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase
(EC: 1.3.99.3)

Acyl-CoA oxidases (in peroxisomes) and acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (in mitochondria) are involved in the pathway responsible for lipid catabolism and catalyse the
first step in fatty acid b-oxidation by forming a trans-a,
b double bond. Apart from general lipid catabolism,
acyl-CoA oxidases are involved in a larger number of
pathways and cellular processes, including the biosynthesis of plant hormones, the PPAR signaling pathway,
and also the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. We
found in total five sequences resembling acyl-CoA oxidase, four of which were present in HvPG but not in
HvLN (Figure 4). In addition, one mitochondrial acylCoA dehydrogenase was found. Since enzymes of the boxidation cycle act on CoA derivatives with 8 to18 carbon chain length fatty acids, they may be active in pheromone production or degradation as well.
(x5) Enoyl-CoA hydratase (EC: 4.2.1.17, EC: 4.2.1.74)

This enzyme carries out the second step in b-oxidation
of fatty acids, the hydration of the trans-a,b double
bond. Two were found in HvPG, GU205159 and
GU205160. This enzyme activity is also represented by
GU205156, corresponding to the a-subunit of the mitochondrial fatty-acid b-oxidation complex, which is a
bifunctional protein also possessing 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA
dehydrogenase activity.
(x6) 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC: 1.1.1.35, EC:
1.1.1.211)

This enzyme performs the third step in b-oxidation of
fatty acids, the NAD+ -dependent dehydrogenation of
the b-hydroxyacyl CoA to form the b-ketoacyl-CoA. In
HvPG this is represented by GU205162, and also by the
bifunctional GU205156.
(x7) Enoyl-CoA isomerase (EC: 5.3.3.8)

This enzme assists in the b-oxidation of unsaturated
fatty acids, transposing a C = C double bond so that
subsequent steps of b-oxidation can be carried out. One
representative, GU205161, was found in HvPG.
(x8) 3-Ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (EC: 2.3.1.16)

This enzyme performs the fourth and final step in the
b-oxidation cycle, cleavage of a C-C bond to form
acetyl-CoA and a new acyl-CoA with two fewer carbon
atoms than the previous one. Four representatives,

Page 13 of 21

including one corresponding to the b-subunit of the
mitochondrial fatty-acid b-oxidation complex
(GU205158), were found in HvPG.
Strandh et al. [44] also described a number of
sequences in the Agrotis segetum pheromone gland EST
library that were considered as candidate genes putatively involved in pheromone production (their Table 4).
Based on the similarity in gene descriptions of homologous sequences (best BLAST hits) found in Genbank,
ten of these were potentially similar to sequences we
have identified in the Heliothis libraries. To determine
whether these sequences overlapping by their gene
descriptions are indeed the same, we downloaded their
candidate gene sequence files from Genbank and compared them with sequences from our libraries using SeqTools 8.4.042 (http://www.seqtools.dk, 2002-2008 S.W.
Rasmussen). Two desaturase contigs in AsPG were also
present in HvPG (see Table 3). Also, the AsPGcontig
that showed homology to “Acyl-CoA binding protein
homologue” (ES582331) was found in HvPG
(EZ407246), as well as the JH binding protein
(ES583149) which was homologous to EZ407196. The
other contigs with homologies to Enoyl CoA hydratase
(ES583704) and “Similar to acetyl CoA acetyltransferase
precursor” (ES583111) were not found in HvPG.
Pheromone perception and degradation

Candidates involved in pheromone perception and/or
degradation include odorant binding proteins OBPs),
chemosensory proteins (CSPs), pheromone binding proteins (PBPs), antennal binding proteins (ABPs), chemosensory receptors, and odorant degrading enzymes
(Table 4 and Figure 8). Most of these have been identified in antennae of adult males [16,80-87]. In many
insect species, OBPs are a diverse gene family that
encode proteins thought to function as molecular chaperones by binding pheromones and semiochemicals
and transporting them through the aqueous lymph of
insect sensilla to the olfactory receptors (ORs). Compared with OBPs, CSPs are expressed more broadly in
various insect tissues. In the silkworm Bombyx mori, the
OBPs are subdivided into three main subfamilies; pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs), general odorant-binding
proteins (GOBPs) and antennal-binding proteins (ABPs)
[88].
Detailed anatomical studies of moth pheromone
glands have not revealed similar sensory structures [8,9].
However, recently Widmayer et al. [89] detected the
pheromone receptors HR2, HR6 and HR13 by RT-PCR
in tissue consisting of the ovipositor tip and the PG.
They subsequently identified a few sensillae expressing
one of these pheromone receptors on the ovipositor, i.e.
the sclerotized cuticle on the lateral lobes of the tip of
the ninth abdominal segment. These pheromone receptors, as well as the pheromone binding proteins (PBP1

and PBP2) found by Widmayer et al. [89] were not present in HvPG. However, we could find these products
after amplification with the gene-specific primers (see
Figure 9).
The odorant binding proteins that we did find in
HvPG, all were present in HvPG and absent in HvLN,
indicating that these proteins are pheromone gland specific as well. One of these sequences coding for odorant
binding proteins was also found in BmPG (EZ407200).
Another major group of genes that we found in the
pheromone gland library were 16 sequences that were
listed as chemosensory proteins. Of the chemosensory
proteins that we found in HvPG, only two also occurred
in HvLN, one of which was found in BmPG (EZ407157)
and one in AsPG (EZ407137). Of the 14 chemosensory
proteins that were only found in HvPG and not in
HvLN, one was found in BmPG (EZ407249), while
EZ407165 and EZ407270 were also present in AgPG.

Discussion
Our strategy of analyzing both non-normalized and normalized libraries of the same tissues allowed us to combine advantages of both; frequency counts of the most
abundant transcripts in the former provided a “digital
Northern”, and reduction of these in the latter greatly
increased the discovery rate of genes with lower expression levels.
The normalization resulted in the reduction of many
over-abundant transcripts detected as strong bands in the
non-normalized total cDNA, thus drastically increasing
the number of new gene objects identified per sequencing
run. The sequencing and assembly into 8310 contigs from

the sex pheromone gland of H. virescens has revealed that
this tissue is more complex than we envisioned beforehand. This is likely at least partly due to the fact that the
pheromone gland tissue is intimately associated with the
ovipositor, the oviduct and the last part of the digestive
tract, as described in detail in the Introduction.
The main objective of this study was to identify a list
of candidate genes that are likely to be involved in the
biosynthetic pathway of moth sex pheromone production. By comparing our extensive database of the pheromone gland transcriptome of H. virescens to that of all
10,511 sequences identified from larval tissues of the
same moth, as well as to the sequences identified from
the pheromone gland of B. mori and A. segetum, we
identified a total of 70 candidate genes that included all
enzyme categories that have been biochemically found
to be involved in the biosynthetic pathway of sex pheromone production in moths [14,17] (Figure 5). The fact
that we found relatively few overlapping sequences in
the different pheromone gland databases may either be
due to unsaturated coverage or to highly diverged gene
expression patterns between species leading to the species-specific pheromone blends.
The finding of a sequence homologous to the PBAN
receptor in HvPG as well as in HvLN support the finding of Rafaeli et al. [54] who found the PBAN receptor
in H. armigera also to be present in the brain, thoracic
ganglion and ventral nerve cord, i.e. in neural tissues,
suggesting that these receptors may represent a neurotransmitter-like function [54]. The fact that we and
Strandh et al. [44] found an unrelated G-protein
coupled receptor indicates that additional receptors are
present in the pheromone gland and/or ovipositor than
just the PBAN receptor.
Even though the enzymes that are possibly involved in
the biosynthetic pathway of pheromone production do
not necessarily have to be only present or active in the
pheromone gland, if we assume that the contigs that are
specifically found in HvPG and not in HvLN are more
likely to be candidate genes for this pathway than contigs that were found in both datasets, then EZ407233 is
the most likely candidate involved in pheromone production in Hv. This is because a) it is mostly expressed
in the pheromone gland in comparison to the body
(Groot and Barthel, unpubl. res.), and b) it is the FAR
that most closely resembles the FAR of B. mori that has
been found to be involved in the biosynthetic pathway
[25] as well as the FARXIII of Ostrinia scapulalis that
that was exclusively expressed in the pheromone gland
[65] (see Figure 7).
As for the desaturases, in addition to the clearly
defined Δ9- and Δ11-desaturases that we found in the
pheromone gland transcriptome, we also identified a
contig that mostly resembled a desaturase that has been

named VPAE, after its signature motif [21]. Even though
no function has been determined for this desaturase or
others with the signature motif GATD, QPGE, and
KPVE, they are also regularly found in sex pheromone
glands, and codon-based likelihood analyses indicate
strong purifying selection, so that these lineages are
most likely protein coding and functional as well [21].
Having identified candidate genes of all categories that
have been biochemically shown to be involved in the

biosynthetic pathway of moth pheromone production
opens the possibility to characterize more enzymes than
only desaturases and fatty acyl reductases, which will
certainly increase our understanding of how sex pheromones may evolve. Especially the acetate esterases are
most likely to be found in pheromone glands of many
moth species, as a large number of species have acetate
esters as pheromone components. Identification of variation in this enzyme may shed light on the

the Hv pheromone gland. Abbreviations used as in Widmayer et al: PBP: Pheromone Binding Protein; HR: Heliothis Chemosensory Receptor;

diversification of pheromone components in the different species. The molecular characterization of the additional enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of
moth pheromone production can also help to elucidate
specific paths in the biosynthetic pathway. For example,
the question of whether aldehyde reductases first produce aldehydes which are then converted to alcohols, or
vice versa, may be solved by knocking down specific
aldehyde reductases.
The diversity of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) identified in the pheromone gland library of Heliothis virescens is both impressive and surprising (see Table 2).
Since the first discovery of AMPs in insects [90], several
hundred of these peptides with antifungal and/or antibacterial activity have been identified from diverse
insects and many vertebrates. However, the in vivo function in insects of most members of this large and very
diverse group of proteins still remains unclear. Although
they lack an adaptive immune system, insects possess an
innate immune system that recognizes and destroys
intruding microorganisms. Parasites and pathogens can
represent extremely powerful selective forces because of
their ability to evolve rapidly. The resulting diversity of
infectious agents and host immune-suppressive factors
exerts strong selection pressures and favors hosts with a
large repertoire of defense responses, including effector
molecules with direct defense activity, among which
AMPs and peptide families such as the defensins are
prominent [91].
The identification of the vast amounts of AMPs in the
Heliothis virescens pheromone gland and associated tissue is even more surprising given that Shelby et al. [92]
have only identified a single AMP-like transcript in a
survey of the immune-induced hemocyte transcriptome
of H. virescens, despite the bacterial elicitation of the
hemocytes in the construction of the cDNA library.
However, the majority of AMPs circulating in the larval
hemolymph seems to be produced in the fat body and
other tissues, and not in the hemocytes themselves. In
our pheromone gland library we have not only identified
all of the published antibacterial and antifungal proteins
from Heliothis, such as attacin [50], heliomicin [51], and
lysozyme [52] but also a wide range of additional AMPs
from these and other gene families, including a large
variety of gloverins and cecropins (see Table 2). Possibly,
this large variety is due to the fact that the gland is
everted with the ovipositor to the outside when a female
moth is calling, and thus exposed to the external
environment.
The sequences found in Bombyx mori pheromone
gland contained a much smaller number of gene objects
that were classified as immune defense-related. This
may be due to the fact that we extracted RNA from the
gland with the ovipositor, similar to the procedure of

Page 16 of 21

Strandh et al. [44], as the pheromone gland is tightly
connected and completely surrounding the ovipositor in
Hv [9]. Since the pheromone gland of B. mori is much
bigger, it is possible to dissect the gland from the ovipositor and care was taken to extract from the pheromone
gland only (K. Mita, personal communication). However,
the much smaller number of immune defense gene
objects in B. mori may also reflect the fact that this
moth is the oldest domesticated animal (since ~10,000
years), with one of the result being that adults are no
longer able to fly. Probably under these domesticated
conditions the environmental pathogen pressure against
which the gland should be defended is absent as well,
which may have caused the immune defense and
immune response genes to be either not expressed or at
a much lower level and with less complexity. An alternative explanation would be that in B. mori the steadystate level of immune defense is much lower as compared to non-domesticated Lepidopteran species. The
steady-state immune defense levels in response to even
non-pathogenic bacteria-feeding in larvae of herbivorous
Lepidoptera has recently been shown to be higher than
expected [93]. In the flesh fly, Sarcophaga peregrina, it
was observed that mRNA of antibacterial genes accumulated even in naïve insects during different developmental stages [94].
Lastly, finding a total of 26 sequences that are likely to
be involved in pheromone perception (see Table 4)
strongly suggests that females may perceive pheromone
compounds via their ovipositor and/or pheromone
gland. Having chemical and/or pheromone receptors on
and near the pheromone gland suggests that there may
be a feedback loop of the chemosensory environment
and the pheromone production [89]. Preliminary studies
on phenotypic plasticity in the pheromone production
of the closely related moth species H. subflexa indeed
suggest that the pheromone composition differs depending on the environment in where the females developed
(Groot, Staudacher and Claben, unpubl. res.).

Conclusion
We have generated an extensive list of candidate genes
that may be involved in the pheromone biosynthesis,
perception and/or degradation and which occur specifically in female sex pheromone glands. Subsequent evaluation of these candidates will follow two independent
approaches. A correlation with active pheromone biosynthesis will be tested by determining which of these
genes are differentially up- or downregulated in pheromone glands that are actively producing pheromone (i.e.
in the scotophase or upon injection with PBAN; see
[95]. In addition, a correlation with observed intra- and
interspecific genetic variation in pheromone component
ratios will be explored by mapping candidate genes onto

Methods

(Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). RNA quantity
was determined on a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. RNA extractions were generated and four
extracts were pooled to maximize the possible number
of gene objects to be found and minimize unique
contigs.

Insects

Construction of the cDNA library

Heliothis virescens eggs were collected in Clayton, NC,
in 2005 and reared on artificial diet [96] in the laboratory of ATG at NCSU since then, under 27°C, 50-70%
RH and 14:10 L:D light cycle. Larvae and pupae were
sent to Jena in July 2007. Pupae were sexed and females
and males were kept separately. The pupae were
checked daily for emergence, so that adults were aged ±
12 h.

For both the Heliothis virescens mixed larval stages (different larval instars) and treatments (e.g. exposure to
plant secondary metabolites, insecticides, immune
insult) and the pheromone gland tissue material a fulllength enriched, directionally cloned, normalized cDNA
library was generated using a combination of the
SMART cDNA library construction kit (Clontech) and
the Trimmer Direct cDNA normalization kit (Evrogen)
generally following the manufacturer’s protocol but with
several important modifications. In brief, 2 μg of total
RNA was used for each cDNA library generated.
Reverse transcription was performed with a mixture of
several reverse transcription enzymes (ArrayScript,
Ambion; BioScript, Bioline; PrimeScript, TaKaRa; SuperScript II, Invitrogen) for 1 h at 42°C and 90 minutes at
50°C. Each step of the normalization procedure was
carefully monitored to avoid the generation of artifacts
and overcycling. The optimal condition for ds-cDNA
synthesis was empirically determined by subjecting the
cDNA to a range of thermocycle numbers and their
products checked by electrophoresis. The optimal cycle
number (16 for the HvPGN sample) was defined as the
maximum number of PCR cycles without any signs of
overcycling.
To detect and classify both highly abundant transcripts
and to generate a more complete transcriptome map of
the gland, we generated and sequenced both a non-normalized and a normalized cDNA library of the pheromone glands of Heliothis virescens. An additional nonnormalized cDNA library was generated for the Heliothis
virescens pheromone gland tissue by primer extension
with the MINT cDNA synthesis kit (Evrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. In order to compare the
pheromone gland sequences to another tissue from the
same species, we also generated a normalized cDNA
library from larval tissue, essentially as described above
for the H. virescens pheromone gland library.
Each of the resulting ds-cDNA pools for the different
cDNA libraries was purified and concentrated using the
DNA Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymogen) and size
fractionated with SizeSep 400 spun columns (GE
Healthcare) that resulted in a cutoff at ~200 bp. The
full-length-enriched cDNAs were cut with SfiI and
ligated to pDNR-Lib plasmid (Clontech). Ligations were
transformed into E. coli ELECTROMAX DH5a-E electro-competent cells (Invitrogen).

our QTL map, generated by Sheck et al. [41] and Groot
et al. [40]. Those genes exhibiting both correlations will
be excellent candidates for further exploration by functional expression and RNAi technology.

Gland extractions

Pheromone glands were extracted from 3-5 day old
females. Sixteen glands were extracted from females in
the photophase (presumably not producing pheromone),
and 16 glands were dissected from females that had
been injected with Pheromone Biosynthesis Activating
Neuropeptide (PBAN) 1-2 hours prior to extraction (see
Groot et al. 2005). In summary, a stock solution of HezPBAN (Peninsula Laboratories, San Carlos, CA) (200
pmol/μl in 50% methanol and 1 N HCl) was diluted in
saline (PBS) to 3.75 pmol/μl. Females were injected during the photophase with 7.5 pmol PBAN in 2 μl, using a
10 μl syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV) with a 31 gauge
needle that was inserted ventrally between the 8th and
the 9th abdominal segments. One-two hr after injection,
the pheromone glands were dissected (see Figure 1),
placed immediately in Trizol and frozen to -80°C before
homogenization and total RNA extraction. As can be
seen in Figure 1, the complete intact gland was used for
RNA extraction, which included the ovipositor, muscle
tissue, the anus and the last part of the digestive tract
[9]. We chose to leave the gland intact because in Hv
pheromone is only found in extracts with intact glands
(Groot and Schal, unpubl. res.).
RNA extractions

TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) was used to isolate the
RNA according to the manufacturer’s protocol with several modifications. The RNA was precipitated overnight
at -20°C and the dried pellet was dissolved in 90 μl
RNA Storage Solution (Ambion). An additional DNAse
(Turbo DNAse, Ambion) treatment was included prior
to the second purification step to eliminate any contaminating DNA. The DNAse enzyme was removed and the
RNA was further purified by using the RNeasy MinElute
Clean up Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocol and eluted in 20 μl of RNA Storage Solution
(Ambion). RNA integrity and quantity was verified on
an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the RNA Nano chips

Sequencing, Generation of EST Databases and Sequence
Analysis

Plasmid minipreparation from bacterial colonies grown
in 96 deep-well plates was performed using the 96 well
robot plasmid isolation kit (NextTec) on a Tecan Evo
Freedom 150 robotic platform (Tecan). Single-pass
sequencing of the 5’ termini of cDNA libraries was carried out on an ABI 3730 × l automatic DNA sequencer
(PE Applied Biosystems). Vector clipping, quality trimming and sequence assembly using stringent conditions
(e.g. high quality sequence trimming parameters, 95%
sequence identity cutoff, 25 bp overlap) was done with
the Lasergene software package (DNAStar Inc.).
In order to obtain a rough transcriptome coverage
estimate for the pheromone gland library, we went
through a series of search steps in order to i) obtain all
hits against the conserved KEGG pathway database, and
ii) estimate genome coverage by identifying the complete ribosomal protein dataset as compared to the full
Bombyx mori set. Based on these findings we estimate
the theoretical transcriptome coverage to be ~85% (70/
79 B. mori ribosomal proteins were found).
We set up individual searchable databases for each of
the species and used them to identify the genes we
describe in more detail in the text. Blast searches were
conducted on a local server using the National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) blastall program.
Homology and gene ontology (GO; http://www.geneontology.com), enzyme classification codes (EC) and metabolic pathway analysis of the assembled sequences were
determined using the BLAST2GO software (http://www.
blast2go.de). Sequences were searched against the NCBI
non-redundant (nr) protein database using an E-value
cut-off of 10-3, with predicted polypeptides of a minimum length of 18 amino acids.
Nucleotide sequences were analyzed using the commercial Lasergene Software package and the freeware
BioEdit program. All EST sequences were submitted to
Genbank (GenBank Acc: GR958232-GR972305). Genes
were aligned by their amino acid sequences using the
ClustalW function [97]. If necessary, alignments were
then corrected by eye before being used for the contig
and gene family analysis as well as the phylogenetic
analyses.
To prepare annotated sequences for submission to
GenBank, two strategies were used to remove redundant
contigs in each library. First, protein translations of the
contigs in each category were compared using the Multiple alignment program MAFFT http://align.bmr.
kyushu-u.ac.jp/mafft/online/server/; this identified many
contigs with predicted protein sequences that were

Page 18 of 21

>95% identical. Second, nucleotide consensus sequences
of all 8310 contigs were subjected to two additional
rounds of clustering using the program Sequencher
(Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, Michigan). The first round
grouped sequences with >85% identity over at least 30
nt using the “Clean data” option, and the second round
used the same parameters with the “Dirty data” option.
The new clusters were examined by eye and those with
<95% identity over at least 30 nt were split again. 6318
of the original contig consensus sequences were not
further grouped by this procedure; the remaining 1992
consensus sequences were grouped into 787 groups. All
contigs combined by the MAFFT alignment were also
combined by Sequencher. Assembled contigs were submitted to the TSA section of GenBank (Accession Numbers EZ407233-EZ407265). Additional sequences of
individual clones for enzymes participating in the b-oxidation of fatty acids were deposited in GenBank (Accession Numbers GU205155 - GU205162).
Phylogenetic reconstruction

The phylogenetic reconstruction implemented for the
analysis of several proteins was performed using the
Neighbour-Joining (NJ) method (TREECON). FAR and
ACCase amino acid sequences were aligned by MAFFT
http://align.bmr.kyushu-u.ac.jp/mafft/software/ and each
visually inspected for regions of high quality alignment.
The NJ consensus tree was generated with TREECON.
Distance calculations were performed after Tajima &
Nei and bootstrap analysis, running 1000 bootstrap samples [98]. Conserved residues in the alignments were
highlighted with BOXSHADE 3.21 http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html.
Bombyx mori and Agrotis segetum pheromone gland ESTs

All of the available Bombyx mori pheromone gland
library ESTs from Genbank (BP184340 - |BP182009;
AV403746 - AV404455; EL928418 - EL930129;
DC545768 - DC550742) and from the Agrotis segetum
pheromone gland library ESTs (ES582293 - ES582156)
were assembled with the same parameters as the
Heliothis virescens ESTs to avoid any bias in subsequent
data analysis.
Best Bidirectional Hits and non-overlapping contigs

To identify best bidirectional hits between two sets of
ESTs reciprocal tblastx WU-Blast analyses were performed. Custom Perl scripts then searched the blast output to find all cases where query “x” gave best hit “y”
and query “y” gave best hit “x” (defined as Best Bidirectional Hit). For all of the inter-species comparisons
(HvPG, BmPG, AsPG) the ValS value was 10. Perl
scripts also identified HvPG ESTs that had no best
bidirectional hit in HvLN (at ValS value = 500).
