Abstract
Background: Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) form a vast and diverse enzyme class
of particular interest in drug development and a high biotechnological potential. Although very
diverse in sequence, they share a common structural fold. For the comprehensive and systematic
comparison of protein sequences and structures the Cytochrome P450 Engineering Database
(CYPED) was established. It was built up based on an extensible data model that enables its
functions readily enhanced.
Description: The new version of the CYPED contains information on sequences and structures
of 8613 and 47 proteins, respectively, which strictly follow Nelson's classification rules for
homologous families and superfamilies. To gain biochemical information on substrates and
inhibitors, the CYPED was linked to the Cytochrome P450 Knowledgebase (CPK). To overcome
differences in the data model and inconsistencies in the content of CYPED and CPK, a metric was
established based on sequence similarity to link protein sequences as primary keys. In addition, the
annotation of structurally and functionally relevant residues was extended by a reliable prediction
of conserved secondary structure elements and by information on the effect of single nucleotide
polymorphisms.
Conclusion: The online accessible version of the CYPED at http://www.cyped.uni-stuttgart.de
provides a valuable tool for the analysis of sequences, structures and their relationships to
biochemical properties.

Background
Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) constitute
one of the largest superfamilies of enzymes, spread widely
among species of microorganisms, plants, animals, and
humans. Since they catalyze the oxidation of a wide range
of endogenous compounds in biosynthetic and biodegradation pathways, as well as xenobiotics such as drugs and
environmental contaminants [1], an understanding of the

substrate specificities of CYPs is crucial for successful drug
development and biotechnological applications [2]. CYPs
require interaction with a reductase, either as separate protein or as fusion protein [3].
We established the CYPED [4] as a tool for a comprehensive and systematic comparison of CYP sequences and
structures, which share only a very low percentage of

sequence identity between the superfamilies [5]. For this
purpose seed sequences have been extracted from the
Cytochrome P450 Homepage [6], incorporated in our inhouse data warehouse system DWARF [7], updated by a
BLAST [8] search and assigned to homologous families
and superfamilies according to the recommended classification scheme [9]. Since the publication of the CYPED, it
was applied to identify selectivity and specificity determining residues [10], to adjust CYP families in the Fungal
Cytochrome P450 Database [11] and served as a template
to design other protein family databases [12,13]. The
amount of available CYP sequences and structures almost
doubled. Therefore, besides integrating new sequences
and structures, we extended the CYPED by biochemical
properties, and by adding new functionalities:
• Information on P450-catalyzed reactions, substrate
preferences, induction and inhibition is made available by the CPK [14]. Since the protein identifiers of the
two databases CYPED and CPK could not be related
un-ambiguously, an algorithm which uses a metric
based on sequence similarities was developed to link
protein entries.
• Information on single-nucleotide polymorphism in
human CYP sequences was extracted from the CYPallele homepage [15].
• CYPs share highly conserved secondary structure elements [16]. Therefore it was possible to reliably predict these elements from sequence and annotate them
in the CYPED.

Construction and content
Database establishment
Homologous families and superfamilies were named
according to the Cytochrome P450 Homepage [6] and
filled with consistently named CYP sequences from the
first version of the CYPED. Thus, seed sequences for
almost 400 superfamilies could be identified. Positions 1499 were annotated as P450-domain to avoid loading
reductases into the CYPED while updating fusion
enzymes. For each seed sequence a BLAST search [8] was
performed in the non-redundant sequence database at
NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov with an E-value of 10100. For each hit, information on sequence, position specific annotations, functional descriptions, and the source
organism was extracted and loaded by an automated
retrieval system into an in-house developed relational
database system [7]. In 28% of the entries the correct CYP
name according to Nelson's classification [9] was provided in the NCBI database entry. In 1% the name was in
contrast to sequence similarity, and therefore the protein
was re-assigned. 1% of the proteins had a name which
does not exist according to Nelson's classification, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/10/27

therefore were assigned to the most similar existing family. Entries which were lacking information on the CYP
name were assigned to a family by sequence similarity.
Thus 64% of the proteins could be assigned which have
not been classified yet. All sequences which were assigned
only based on sequence similarity were labelled by
"homologous protein of family X (BY SIMILARITY)". 218
proteins without CYP name information and no sequence
similarity to existing families, as well as 279 protein fragments were discarded. Following this procedure the
entries of the CYPED are consistent with the recommendations of the nomenclature committee.
Sequence entries that originate from the same organism
and share a sequence identity of at least 98% are assigned
to a single protein entry. For proteins with multiple
sequence entries, the longest sequence was defined as reference sequence of the respective protein. Protein structures were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank
(PDB) [17] and stored as structural monomers. Secondary
structure information was calculated using DSSP [18].
Information on structurally or functionally relevant residues was extracted from the GenBank and annotated in
the CYPED.
New features and functionalities
The current version of the CYPED also provides a feature
page for each protein entry where the sequence is displayed and annotations are highlighted. A newly developed dynamic web interface directly incorporates changes
in the database.

The integration of protein databases is based on a common, unique key. A database-independent attribute of a
protein which can be applied like a primary key is the protein sequence itself. While a primary key has to be specific,
sequences can slightly vary although they might belong to
the same protein entry. To overcome this problem, an
algorithm was implemented (figure 1) which allows the
direct use of the sequences as primary keys without the
requirement of being completely identical which was
termed a metric primary key. For each CYPED entry, a
BLAST search against the CPK database was performed.
The BLAST hits were ranked by E-value and a global pairwise alignment was performed [19]. The CPK entries with
a sequence identity of more than 90% are displayed on
the protein feature page, linking to the corresponding
CYPED sequence to the respective entries in the CPK.
Thus, the sequences can be applied as common attribute
of protein entries and serve as primary keys.
For all sequence entries the conserved secondary structures were predicted by a structure-based HMM-profile
which was embedded in an automated annotation program, stored as annotations in the DWARF-system and are

displayed on the protein feature pages and within the
multisequence alignments.
Information on human CYP alleles was extracted from the
"Home Page of the Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP)
Allele Nomenclature Committee" [15] and stored in
tables designated for this purpose in the database. The
mutations and their effect, whether the enzymes lack of
activity or gained increased activity, are listed on the protein feature page.
Contents
The CYPED contains 11193 sequence entries for 8613
protein entries. The proteins have been assigned to 249
superfamilies and 619 homologous families. Structure
information for 47 different proteins which originate
from 36 different homologous families was extracted
from 228 PDB entries.

In total, 3575 CYPED proteins matched the respective
CPK entries with a sequence identity of more than 90%.
These matches provided the links to 3257 different compounds (1699 substrates, 723 inducers and 1227 inhibitors). This information has been extracted from more than
10000 research papers cited in PubMed [14].
For each family, a multisequence alignment and a phylogenetic tree were generated by CLUSTALW [20]. The annotated version is colour-coded and highlights functionally
relevant sites and the predicted secondary structure. For
each alignment, the degree of conservation of each column is indicated on the bottom as a coloured chart as calculated by PLOTCON [21]. For each homologous family
and superfamily, family specific HMM profiles http://
hmmer.janelia.org/ are supplied.

The online version of the CYPED can be browsed by families, source organisms, or structures. Pre-calculated multisequence alignments and structural monomers are
displayed and can be downloaded. Phylogenetic trees are
visualized by the program PHYLODENDRON http://
iubio.bio.indiana.edu/treeapp/. Sequences in the alignments and trees can either be displayed with their accession codes or their systematic names and source
organisms as identifiers and they are linked to the respective GenBank entry. For each superfamily and homologous family, family-specific HMM-profiles are provided,
which can be applied for the classification and the identification of new CYP sequences. Besides, the website provides a local BLAST interface where a homology search can
be performed against the CYPED.
For the 3575 protein entries in the CYPED that match CPK
entries, the interface to the CPK provides biochemical
information on substrates, inhibitors, and inducers. In the
CPK, effectors of CYPs are separated into drugs and nondrugs. Special tags show the cases, when the same compound was reported as substrate and inducer, or when
experimental results negated the CYP activity towards a
certain chemical species. Through the hyperlink the user is
also provided with the information on the PubMed references reporting the relationship between a CYP isoform
and low-molecular effector.

Conclusion
The Cytochrome P450 Engineering Database (CYPED)
provides a collection of tools for classification and analysis of the vast and diverse family of cytochrome P450
monooxygenases. To gain a better understanding in biochemical properties and sequence-structure-function relationships, the features of the CYPED were extended by
integrating biochemical information from the CPK. Thus,
the CYPED has become a valuable tool to navigate in
sequence space and to analyze sequence-structure-function relationships.
