Abstract
Background: The synthesis of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) has received considerable attention
with their potential applications in various life sciences related applications. Recently, there has
been tremendous excitement in the study of nanoparticles synthesis by using some natural
biological system, which has led to the development of various biomimetic approaches for the
growth of advanced nanomaterials. In the present study, we have demonstrated the synthesis of
gold nanoparticles by a novel bacterial strain isolated from a site near the famous gold mines in
India. A promising mechanism for the biosynthesis of GNPs by this strain and their stabilization via
charge capping was investigated.
Results: A bacterial isolate capable of gold nanoparticle synthesis was isolated and identified as a
novel strain of Stenotrophomonas malophilia (AuRed02) based on its morphology and an analysis of
its 16S rDNA gene sequence. After 8 hrs of incubation, monodisperse preparation of gold
nanoparticles was obtained. Gold nanoparticles were characterized and found to be of ~40 nm size.
Electrophoresis, Zeta potential and FTIR measurements confirmed that the particles are capped
with negatively charged phosphate groups from NADP rendering them stable in aqueous medium.
Conclusion: The process of synthesis of well-dispersed nanoparticles using a novel microorganism
isolated from the gold enriched soil sample has been reported in this study, leading to the
development of an easy bioprocess for synthesis of GNPs. This is the first study in which an
extensive characterization of the indigenous bacterium isolated from the actual gold enriched soil
was conducted. Promising mechanism for the biosynthesis of GNPs by the strain and their
stabilization via charge capping is suggested, which involves an NADPH-dependent reductase
enzyme that reduces Au3+ to Au0 through electron shuttle enzymatic metal reduction process.

logical processes at nano-scale etc. [1-5]. These nanoparticles, in general, are synthesized using a number of
synthetic procedures in various polar and non-polar
media [6-8]. Recently, there has been tremendous excitement in the study of nanoparticles synthesis by using
some natural biological system. This has led to the development of various biomimetic approaches for the growth
of advanced nanomaterials. Microorganisms, such as bacteria, yeast and fungi, are known to produce inorganic
materials either intra- or extracellularly [9-12]. These
microorganisms play an important role in remediation of
metals through reduction of metal ions. Some of these
microorganisms can survive and grow even at high metal
ion concentrations. They are often exposed to extreme
environmental conditions, forcing them to resort to specific defense mechanisms to quell such stresses, including
the toxicity of foreign metal ions or metals [13]. The toxicity of metal ions is reduced or eliminated by changing
the redox state of the metal ions and/or precipitation of
the metals intracellularly, thus, forming the basis of the
synthesis of nanoparticles [14]. However, the actual
mechanism for the biosynthesis of GNPs by different
microorganisms and their stabilization via charge capping
is still not well understood. It was shown in one of the earlier studies that the possible mechanism of biosynthesis of
silver nanoparticles might involve the reduction of silver
ions due to the electron shuttle enzymatic metal reduction
process. The enzyme involved in the synthesis of silver
nanoparticles may be nitrate reductase present in microorganism, which may be induced by the nitrate ions and
reduced silver ions to metallic silver [15]. Duran et al also
suggested the possible mechanism of biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles by Fusarium oxysporum strains (fungi).
They proposed the involvement of enzymatic electron
shuttle relationship for the formation of Ag+ ions and the
subsequent formation of silver nanoparticle [16].
Although there are reports on the biochemical steps
involved in metallic nanoparticles synthesis by microorganisms [17-20], there are virtually no reports available
which may elucidate enzymatic basis of gold nanoparticle
synthesis by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
In this paper, we report the rapid synthesis of GNPs by
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (Acc No GQ220749), a novel
bacterial strain isolated from soil samples from the Singhbhum gold mines (located in the Jharkhand state of
India). A possible mechanism of biosynthesis of gold nanoparticles from gold chloride (HAuCl4) involves the role
of specific NADPH-dependent reductase enzyme present
in the organism that converts Au3+ to Au0 through electron
shuttle enzymatic metal reduction.

Results and discussion
Isolation and characterization of strain capable of
synthesisizing gold nanoparticles
Pure colonies isolated from the gold enriched soil were
characterized for their morphological and physiological
characteristics by various biochemical tests using the
Bergeys Manual of Determinative Bacteriology [21] as
summarized in Table 1. The screened strain is aerobic,
motile, mucoid and yellow in Nutrient Agar medium
(Himedia Labs, India). SEM micrographs revealed that the
cells of strain AuRed02 are oval shaped, with discrete
lipopolysaccharides layers on its surface causing the bacteria to glue to each other as evident from SEM imaging
(Fig. 1). No production of acid was noted from the
selected carbohydrates such as adonitol, arabinose, fructose, galactose, inositol, inulin, lactose, mannitol, mannose, rhamnose, sorbitol and xylose. The isolated strain
named as AuRed02 produced acid from maltose, dextrose
and trehalose, showing typical characteristics of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The strain gave a positive lipolytic
activity and was able to utilize citrate as a carbon source.

The 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed that strain
AuRed02 clustered homologue being Pseudomonas Sp.
(Acc. No. FJ211222). At species level, strain AuRed02
shows the highest level of sequence similarity with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain: BL-15 (99%) (AB194325)
as shown in phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2).
Characterization of gold nanoparticles synthesized by
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia
A solution of gold chloride in a suspension of cell mass of
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia changed progressively from
light yellow to cherry red at temperature 25°C showing
formation of gold nanoparticles. Control experiments,
without the addition of biomass as well as with heatkilled cells, showed no change in color of suspension (Fig.
3a) confirming the formation of GNPs in the presence of
biomass only. The kinetics of the reaction was studied
using UV-vis spectroscopy by recording spectra from the
colloidal gold solutions obtained after disrupting the
cells, which were resuspended with HAuCl4 solution for
different time intervals. The spectra revealed a strong
absorption at nearly 530 nm after 8 hrs of incubation at
25°C, gradually showing a red shift with time at 25°C
(Fig 4 curves bottom to top). The intense plasmon resonance band indicated the formation of spherical gold
nanoparticles of approximately 40 nm in diameter [18].
Size distribution of GNPs was confirmed by coating a
drop of the supernatant solution of disrupted cell suspension by TEM imaging. The images demonstrate gold nanoparticles possessing an average diameter of 40 nm (±
15%) as depicted in (Fig. 3b). Cryo TEM imaging of the
thin sections of stained AuRed02 strain after reacting the
biomass with gold chloride solution for 8 h showed the

presence of gold nanoparticles on the inner cytoplasmic
membrane (see Additional file 1, S1). It is likely that some
gold ions (Au3+) cross the cell barrier through ion-transport channel and are reduced by the enzymes present on
the cytoplasmic membrane and within the cytoplasm.
Energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis (EDS) confirmed
the presence of gold nanoparticles in the suspension. The
spectra (Fig. 3c) present major Au peaks at approximately
2 keV besides several other peaks of C, O, and Si which
might be due to the chemical composition of the sample
substrate used in the EDS analysis. These results show that
the strain Stenotrophomonas maltophilia could effectively
synthesize GNPs of different sizes by resuspending the
biomass for different time intervals in the presence of
HAuCl4 (Fig. 4). The colored solution of GNPs remained
stable for more than 2-weeks of storage at 4°C indicating
the capping of GNPs with some charged groups. FTIR
analysis of these GNPs further confirmed the capping of
GNPs by phosphate groups (900 cm-1) (see Additional file
1, S2).
Promising mechanism aspects of biosynthesis by
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia
In microorganisms, the possible mechanisms of resistance
against metal ions usually involve biosorption, bioaccumulation, extra-cellular complexation, efflux system,
alteration of solubility and toxicity via reduction or oxidation [22]. Our study suggested that the biosynthesis of
GNPs and their stabilization via charge capping in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia involved NADPH-dependent
reductase enzyme that converts Au3+ to Au0 through electron shuttle enzymatic metal reduction process. For further confirmation, biomass was incubated with varying
concentrations of NADPH (from 0.05 mM to 0.8 mM
NADPH) and change in color of solution was monitored

Conclusion
The process of synthesis of well-dispersed nanoparticles
using a highly efficient microorganism Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia has been reported in this study leading to the
development of an easy bioprocess for synthesis of GNPs
of desired size and shape. The results presented demonstrate that a specific NADPH-dependent enzyme present
in the isolated strain reduces Au3+ to Au0 through an electron shuttling mechanism leading to the synthesis of
nearly monodispersed GNPs. This green route of biosynthesis of GNPs is a simple, economically viable and an
eco-friendly process.

spectrophotometrically (Fig 5a) and visually (Fig. 5b).
Control experiments, without the addition of either cell
free extract (C1) or cell free extract without NADPH (C2),
showed no change in color of suspension. However, addition of NADPH in the cell free extract at varying concentrations (C3 to C7) showed the synthesis of GNPs with
gradual increase in color intensity (Fig. 5b). This confirms
the formation of GNPs only in the presence of both biomass and NADPH. Zeta potential measurements of the
GNPs showed a peak at -16.7 mV (see Additional file 1,
S3), suggesting capping of GNPs by negatively charged
phosphate ions from NADP. Based on these experimental
findings, a schematic representation of the potential
mechanism of gold nanoparticles synthesis by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia through enzymatic reduction is proposed (Fig. 6). The enzyme involved in the synthesis of
metal nanoparticles may be a specific reductase present in
microorganism, which may be induced by the specific
ions and reduced metal ions to metallic nanoparticles.

Isolation and characterization of bacteria from the gold
enriched soil
Soil samples from the gold enriched sites near famous
Singhbhum gold mines, Jharkhand state, India were used
as inoculum, serially diluted and plated onto Nutrient
Agar media (Himedia, India). The plates were incubated
at 30°C for 24 hrs. The colonies obtained were further
subcultured on Nutrient Agar supplemented with 1 mM
HAuCl4 (Sigma, India) and incubated at 30°C for 24 hrs.
In one of the isolates, the light yellow color of HAuCl4
changed to wine red indicating that the organism was utilizing HAuCl4 for the synthesis of GNPs. The morphological and physiological characterization of the selected
isolate was carried out by biochemical tests using the
Bergeys Manual of Determinative Bacteriology [21]. The
cell morphology was investigated using Zeiuss-EVO 40
scanning electron microscope (SEM). Further characterization of isolate was done by means of 16S rRNA gene
analyses [23]. The 16S rDNA sequencing was done by M/
s Bangalore Genei, India.

To obtain stable gold nanoparticles, the conditions of the
characterized isolate were optimized for different concentrations of gold chloride, production media, temperature,
pH and time. The characterized isolate was inoculated
into 50 ml sterile Nutrient Broth (NB) and subsequently
1 gm of wet biomass was harvested after 16 hrs of incubation. The biomass obtained was washed thrice with deionised water (pH 7.0) and added to a 100 ml Erlenmeyer
flask containing 1 mM gold chloride solution prepared in
de-ionized water spiked with 400 mg Yeast Extract. The
Erlenmeyer flasks were incubated at 25°C for 8 hrs to isolate the nearly monodisperse spherical gold nanoparticles. To isolate the pure GNPs, cells were disrupted using
0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100. The disrupted samples were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 15 min at 4°C and washed thrice
with deionized water to remove cell-debris. The supernatant was used for the characterization of GNPs.

Biosynthesis of gold nanoparticles and their
characterization
To determine the peak time-point of maximum gold nanoparticles synthesis, the absorption spectra of the supernatants were taken at different time intervals and recorded
using a Hitachi U2800 spectrophotometer. TEM studies
were carried out using Jeol 2100 microscope operating at
120 kV accelerating voltage. Samples were prepared by
placing a drop of GNPs solutions on carbon-coated TEM
grids. The films on the TEM grids were allowed to dry for
5 min at room temperature before analysis. Energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis (EDS) was carried out to confirm the synthesis of gold nanoparticles using FEI E-SEM
Quanta 200. Particle size and charge distribution (zeta
potential) was analyzed using dynamic light scattering
system (Beckman Coulter, USA) by illuminating the colloidal gold solution with He-Ne Laser (633 nm) in a sample cell.
