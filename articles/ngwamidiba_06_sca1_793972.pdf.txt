Abstract
Background: Among the 17 genes encoding autotransporter proteins of the "surface cell antigen"
(sca) family in the currently sequenced Rickettsia genomes, ompA, sca5 (ompB) and sca4 (gene D),
have been extensively used for identification and phylogenetic purposes for Rickettsia species.
However, none of these genes is present in all 20 currently validated Rickettsia species. Of the
remaining 14 sca genes, sca1 is the only gene to be present in all nine sequenced Rickettsia genomes.
To estimate whether the sca1 gene is present in all Rickettsia species and its usefulness as an
identification and phylogenetic tool, we searched for sca1genes in the four published Rickettsia
genomes and amplified and sequenced this gene in the remaining 16 validated Rickettsia species.
Results: Sca1 is the only one of the 17 rickettsial sca genes present in all 20 Rickettsia species. R.
prowazekii and R. canadensis exhibit a split sca1 gene whereas the remaining species have a complete
gene. Within the sca1 gene, we identified a 488-bp variable sequence fragment that can be amplified
using a pair of conserved primers. Sequences of this fragment are specific for each Rickettsia species.
The phylogenetic organization of Rickettsia species inferred from the comparison of sca1 sequences
strengthens the classification based on the housekeeping gene gltA and is similar to those obtained
from the analyses of ompA, sca5 and sca4, thus suggesting similar evolutionary constraints. We also
observed that Sca1 protein sequences have evolved under a dual selection pressure: with the
exception of typhus group rickettsiae, the amino-terminal part of the protein that encompasses the
predicted passenger domain, has evolved under positive selection in rickettsiae. This suggests that
the Sca1 protein interacts with the host. In contrast, the C-terminal portion containing the
autotransporter domain has evolved under purifying selection. In addition, sca1 is transcribed in R.
conorii, and might therefore be functional in this species.
Conclusion: The sca1 gene, encoding an autotransporter protein that evolves under dual
evolution pressure, is the only sca-family gene to be conserved by all Rickettsia species. As such, it
is a valuable identification target for these bacteria, especially because rickettsial isolates can be
identified by amplification and sequencing of a discriminatory gene fragment using a single primer
pair. It may also be used as a phylogenetic tool. However, its current functional status remains to
be determined although it was found expressed in R. conorii.

Background
Members of the genus Rickettsia are obligate intracellular,
Gram-negative, bacteria. These bacteria are surrounded by
a crystalline proteic layer [1], also referred to as S-layer,
which represents 10 to 15 % of their total protein mass [2]
and is made of immunodominant surface protein antigens (SPA) [3-5]. Prior to Rickettsia genome sequencing,
two SPAs, i.e. rOmpA [6,7] and rOmpB [8,9], were identified in Rickettsia species. These two high molecular weight
proteins are major antigenic determinants eliciting an
early and dominant immune response in patients infected
with rickettsiae [10]. Recent studies suggested that these
two proteins are involved in adhesion to host cells
[11,12]. This assumption is supported by the presence of
conserved repeated peptide motifs which are common in
some adhesive proteins from other species [13].
rOmpA and rOmpB are encoded by the ompA [14] and
sca5 (or ompB) [15] genes, respectively. Sequence analyses
readily identify the presence of a highly conserved
autotransporter β-barrel domain (hereafter designated as
"autotransporter domain") at the C-termini of the protein
products. Proteins carrying this domain are collectively
designated as "autotransporter proteins", and have been
described in many Gram-negative bacteria [16]. The
autotransporter domain forms a β-barrel pore in the bacterial outer membrane, and allows the amino-terminal
part ("passenger domain") of the precursor to be exported
across the outer membrane of the bacterium, and later be
released following cleavage of the autotransporter
domain. Theoretical molecular masses of the predicted
proteins derived from ompA and ompB genes exceed those
experimentally measured for rOmpA and rOmpB, respectively [3,4,9,17], implying the cleavage of the autotransporter domain from their precursors. Indeed, such a posttranslational processing was demonstrated for rOmpB for
which a ≈30-kDa peptide is cleaved from the C-terminus
of the protein [3,4,9,17,18]. Another gene, annotated as
sca4 (surface cell antigen 4), previously named gene D
[19] and known to encode a 120-kDa intracytoplasmic
protein, has a passenger domain similar to those of ompA
and ompB. However, it lacks the autotransporter domain
[18].
Based on the sequences of nine Rickettsia genomes, we
have recently identified another 14 autotransporter genes
exhibiting structures similar to those of ompA and ompB
[18]. Members of the paralogous sca gene family are
diversely degraded and distributed among Rickettsia species, with numbers of complete genes ranging from two in
R. prowazekii to 10 in R. felis [18]. Among the 17 sca genes,
only three are present in all nine Rickettsia genomes, i.e.,
sca1, sca4, and sca5 (ompB). However, we have previously
demonstrated that sca5 was not amplified in R. canadensis
[15] and that sca4 was fragmented in R. prowazekii and not

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/12

amplifiable in R. canadensis [19]. As a consequence, none
of the previously studied sca genes, despite their demonstrated usefulness for identification of these bacteria, may
serve to identify all rickettsial isolates. Likewise, no current phylogenetic study based on sca genes included all
Rickettsia species.
Of the 17 rickettsial autotransporter proteins putatively
encoded by the 17 sca genes, only rOmpA and rOmpB
have been detected by SDS-PAGE or western-blotting in R.
conorii [10] as well as Sca4 in R. japonica [20]. Curiously,
neither ompA nor ompB are conserved in all validated Rickettsia species, despite their seemingly important roles in
adhesion to host cells [11]. No protein product has been
identified yet for the other sca genes, raising the question
as to whether those genes are functional. By RT-PCR, we
recently observed that sca2 was transcribed in R. conorii
[21]. In this study, to further characterize the sca family of
genes, we studied the sca1 gene, the only gene together
with ompB and sca4 present in the nine Rickettsia genomes
[18]. By comparing sca1 gene sequences from all 20 validated Rickettsia species, we performed a phylogenetic
analysis of Rickettsia species and analyzed more precisely
the evolutionary forces that acted on sca1. In addition, as
ompB and sca4 are expressed, we also examined the transcriptional status of the sca1 gene in R. conorii.

Results
Sca1 sequences
Orthologous genes of the R. conorii sca1 gene in the
genomes of R. prowazekii, R. typhi, and R. felis, were readily
identified with the use of BLASTn, tBLASTn, and BLASTp
homology searches. In R. prowazekii, the sca1 gene was
split into three consecutive ORFs (RP016 to RP018).

Sca1 fragments were amplified from all tested Rickettsia
species. All negative controls remained negative. The size
of sca1 genes ranged from 1,782 bp for R. bellii to 5,928
bp for R. japonica. All studied species exhibited distinct
sca1 sequences, which were deposited in GenBank under
the accession numbers reported in Table 1. The global
pairwise nucleotide sequence identities of sca1 varied
from 57% between R. prowazekii and R. canadensis to 99 %
between R. sibirica and R. parkeri. This variation is greater
than that observed for the 16 S rDNA (> 97.2%) and gltA
genes (> 85 %), previously studied for all Rickettsia species
[22,23]. This variation is also greater than that observed
for sca5, which exhibits pairwise identities ranging from
70 to 99.6 % [15]. Thus sca1 appeared to be more divergent at the nucleotide level among Rickettsia species than
sca5. The G+C% of sca1 sequences ranged from 30.15 %
for R. prowazekii to 34.68 % for R. helvetica. Differences
among Rickettsia species consisted of nucleotide substitutions, insertions and deletions, but not of variations in
number of repeats as observed in ompA [24]. Insertions

and/or deletions were found in all studied species and varied in size and position according to the species. When
translated into amino acids, sca1 sequences were free from
internal stop codons except R. prowazekii and R. canadensis. The overall pairwise amino acid sequence identities
ranged from 37 % between R. canadensis and R. bellii to
97% between R. conorii and R. sibirica.
Using the SVARAP software, we identified a 488-bp fragment at the 3'-end of the sca1 gene, in the autotransporter
domain. With regard to the R. japonica sca1 sequence, this
fragment was located between nucleotides 4,894 and
5,930. It was flanked by conserved sequences within
which it was possible to identify the primer pair F1MAX:
5'-AAGAGGTYTRTGGATGCGT-3'
and
RMAX:
5'GAYAATATATTATTYTCTTTC-3'. The specificity of these
primers was confirmed by comparison with sequences
available in the GenBank database. Each of the 20 Rickettsia species we studied had a specific fragment sequence,
with pairwise nucleotide sequence identities varying from
78.5% between R. belli and R. prowazekii to 99.8 %
between R. parkeri and R. africae. Fragment sequences
were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers
reported in Table 1.

Phylogenetic analysis
The phylogenetic relationships among Rickettsia species
were inferred in three steps. Because the passenger
domains of the Sca1 proteins could not be aligned reliably
owing to a high level of divergence between distant Rickettsia species, we first reconstructed the phylogeny of the
20 species from the alignment of the autotransporter
domains, which is much more conserved. The autotransporter domain alignment contained 282 amino acid sites.
In this phylogenetic tree (Figure 1A), the three major recognized Rickettsia clades (spotted fever, typhus and R. bellii groups) were well separated with bootstrap value
>75%. In addition, R. canadensis appeared to form a separate fourth deep branching clade. The spotted fever subtree was poorly resolved, with most branches having bootstrap values <75%. We realigned separately the Sca1 proteins from spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae, including
the passenger domain, and used them for phylogenetic
reconstruction. After removing gaps and ambiguous positions, the SFG alignment contained 628 amino acid sites
and 16 sequences. The SFG tree (Figure 1B) was organized
in three distinct clades. The first clade included R. felis, R
akari, and R. australis; the second clade contained a single
species, i.e., R. helvetica. The last clade contained all other

SFG species, including R. conorii. This latter clade, poorly
resolved, was therefore re-analysed separately. The alignment of the Sca1 proteins from the latter clade contained
12 sequences and 1,211 amino acid sites after gap
removal. The resulting phylogenetic tree was entirely
resolved with all branches supported with bootstrap values > 82%, except for the placement of R. honei with a
boostrap support of 53% (Figure 1C). Two clusters supported by bootstrap values of 100% were observed, one
including R. massiliae, R. rhipicephali, R. aeschlimannii and
R. montanensis, and the other including all remaining species.
Study of evolutionary forces
We carried out a sliding window analysis to highlight the
local variations of sequence similarity along the protein
sequences. Two broad regions with different levels of
sequence divergence could be distinguished (Figure 2).
The first region, which encompasses the majority of the
alignment (from position 1 to 800), is characterized by a
higher level of sequence divergence with 50 aa window
not exceeding 86% of invariable positions and dropping

at values as low as 60% at positions 127–186 and 325–
385 (Figure 2). The second region from position 801 to
the end, overlaps with the autotransporter domain and is
more conserved with 50 aa window ranging from 78% to
98% of invariable positions. This heterogeneity of
sequence divergence suggests different strength of selective constraints in the different domains of the Sca1 protein.
To further characterize the variations of selective constraints along the Sca1 protein sequence, models of codon
substitutions were fitted to the aligned Sca1 codon
sequences to estimate the ω ratios (Table 3). Likelihood
ratio tests were applied between nested models to select
the one that best described the data (Table 4). Models M1,
M2 and M3, which account for variable ω ratio among
codon sites are all significantly better (P < 0.0001) than
model M0, which accounts for a single ω ratio for all
codon sites in the alignment. This confirms that selective
constraints are not homogenous along the Sca1
sequences. In addition, model M2 (selection) significantly improved the likelihood over model M1 (neutral).

pressure that acted on Sca1 in SFG and typhus group rickettsiae.
RT-PCR assay
An RT-PCR product of 407-bp was obtained from R.
conorii. Negative controls remained negative. The
sequenced RT-PCR product was 100% identical to the sca1
sequence from R. conorii.

Discussion

Figure selective pressure along the Sca1 sequences

Variable selective pressure along the Sca1 sequences. The x
axis represents the alignments of the Sca1 sequences. The
predicted passenger and autotransporter domains expand
from positions 1 to 800, and from positions 801 to the end,
respectively. The N-terminal signal peptide is not included in
the alignment because the sequence was not determined for
some of the Rickettsia species under study. The y axis represents the percent of invariable sites per window of 50 sites
attributed to each amino acid position in the Sca1 protein
alignment. Predicted positively selected sites and their mean
of ϖ (calculated as the average of ϖ over the 11 site classes
of model M8, weighted by the posterior probabilities; right
axis) appear as stars. The curve represents the averages of
means of ϖ calculated for sliding windows of 50 codon sites
(right axis).
Interestingly, models M2 and M3 both predicted a class of
codon sites with ω > 1, suggesting that some amino acid
positions are under positive selection. This result was further confirmed by the model M8, which better fit the data
than model M7 and predicted an additional class of
codons with ω = 5.75. Note that model M2, M3 and M8
identified the same amino acid positions under positive
selection. Thus, the signal for positive selection was consistent whatever the evolutionary model considered
(Table 3). The predicted positively selected sites were
mainly distributed within the internal passenger domain
(Figure 2) except site 1049, which fall in the AT domain.
Unfortunately, little is known about the Sca1 passenger
domain and no information is available on the 3-dimensional proximity of the positively selected sites. The C-terminal region encompassing the autotransporter domain
was globally under stronger purifying selection (Figure 2).
Models M3 and M8 predicted that 44% and 45% of codon
sites respectively (mostly located in the N-terminal
region) belong to codon categories with ω close to or
higher than 1. This suggests that a substantial fraction of
amino acid sites in the passenger domain of Sca1 proteins
was under weak or positive selection. When estimating
the Ka/Ks ratios by branch, we observed that the ratios
were > 1 among SFG rickettsiae but < 1 between R. prowazekii and R. typhi, thus suggesting a different evolutionary

We studied the sca1 gene in the 20 currently validated
Rickettsia species and demonstrated that this gene, the
only sca gene present in all 20 species (Figure 3), is a useful tool for the identification and phylogenetic study of
these bacteria.
We obtained unique sca1 sequences for each of the 20
studied species. We also observed that sca1 sequences
exhibit a greater level of interspecies variablity than previously studied sca genes, thus making sca1 a potential identification tool for rickettsiae.Sca1 loci exhibit diverse
levels of conservation among Rickettsia species. It is
present as a complete gene in all studied species except in
R. prowazekii and R. canadensis, in which it is present as a
pseudogene. Amiri et al. have previously demonstrated
that the rate of gene degradation may vary among Rickettsia species, with typhus group rickettsiae exhibiting a
higher rate than spotted fever group rickettsiae [25]. In
our study, we observed a higher degradation gradient in
typhus group (R. prowazekii but not R. typhi) than in spotted fever group rickettsiae (none of 18 species studied).
We have previously observed such variations for ompA,
sca2, sca5, and sca4 (Figure 3). ompA is present as a pseudogene in R. felis and R. akari, as fragments in R. bellii [18],
and could not be amplified in R. helvetica, R. canadensis,
and typhus group rickettsiae [14]; sca2 is present as a pseudogene in R. helvetica and R. canadensis, and as remnants
in typhus group rickettsiae [21]; sca4 was split in R. prowazekii and could not be detected in R. canadensis [19]; and
sca5 was not found in R. canadensis [15]. All other sca
genes are even less conserved among Rickettsia species
[18]. Thus, sca1 is the only sca family gene to be present in
all 20 validated Rickettsia species. This specificity and the
length of the gene prompted us to search for a gene fragment that could serve as an identification tool for all species. We identified a 488-bp fragment within the
autotransporter domain whose sequence could distinguish all Rickettsia species. This sequence fragment has the
advantage of being amplified using a single primer pair
(F1MAX-RMAX), and thus may be a useful tool for both
detection and identification of Rickettsia species.
Due to high levels of divergence between distant Rickettsia
species in their passenger domains, we based our phylogenetic analysis on a polyphasic approach. The sca1-based

phylogenetic analysis of Rickettsia species was well supported for most species (Figure 1). Four clusters were
identified and supported by elevated bootstrap values:
one included the Rickettsia species previously classified
within the R. rickettsii group [26]; a second was made of
members of the R. massiliae group; a third incorporated
members of the R. akari group; and the fourth group was
made of members of the typhus group. By comparison
with previous phylogenetic studies based on autotransporter genes or gltA, involved in a central metabolic pathway [14,15,22], we obtained similar organizations among
SFG rickettsiae. Obtaining similar phylogenetic reconstructions from the analyses of different genes with different functions suggests that the true phylogenetic
organization of members of the Rickettsia genus is close to
that obtained in our study.
By comparing sca genes among nine Rickettsia genomes,
we have previously observed that five of the 17 sca genes
(ompA, sca1, sca2, sca4 and sca5) have evolved under positive selection [18]. However, this analysis was global and
based on a limited number of species. Herein, we conducted a detailed study using a sliding-window approach.
This method showed that sca1 is divided into two
domains undergoing different selection pressure (Figure
2). The 3'-end of the gene, highly conserved among species and encoding the autotransporter domain, was found
to evolve under purifying selection. This is likely due to

the complex structure of the β barrel pore, which involves
numerous specific interactions between amino acids.
Amino acid replacements in the autotransporter domain
may be more likely to be deleterious for the protein function. In contrast, the 5'-part of the gene, highly variable
among species and encoding the secreted part of the protein, has evolved under weaker or neutral selection. In
addition, we have shown here that some amino acid positions within the N-terminal domain have evolved under
positive selection. The immune system of the host is
known to drive positive Darwinian selection for diversity
of immuno-exposed proteins such as the porB gene of
Neisseria gonorrhoeae [27]. To date, only the rOmpA,
rOmpB, and Sca4 proteins have evidence of expression
and are known to induce an immune response in humans
[14,15,20]. The functional status of the other sca genes is
still uncertain. Several features of sca1 evolution suggest
that this gene is functional in most of the Rickettsia species
belonging to the spotted fever group. First, if the process
of degradation started before the separation of these species, we would expect the level of divergence to be homogeneous along the protein sequences. The fact that we
could distinguish two regions with different levels of
sequence divergence argues against the pseudogene
hypothesis. In addition, the genic region corresponding to
the autotransporter domain appeared to evolve mainly
under purifying selection, which is characteristic of functional coding sequences. In addition, we observed that
sca1 has evolved under distinct evolutionary patterns
depending on the phylogenetic branches. In typhus group
rickettsiae, Sca1 has evolved under purifying selection
whereas in other species, it has evolved under positive
selection. Whether this is linked to a difference in vector
or host is unknown.
Although sca1, sca4 and sca5 are the most conserved sca
genes among Rickettsia species (Figure 3), only the latter
two genes are known to be expressed. Thus, we investi-

gated the transcription of this gene, which is currently
unknown. Chao et al. could not find sca1 in the R. prowazekii proteome [28]. However, this may be explained by
the fact that sca1 is a pseudogene in this species. Using RTPCR, we demonstrated that sca1 was transcribed at least in
R. conorii. The molecular mass of the predicted mature
Sca1 protein in R. conorii being 170 kDa, which is close to
that of rOmpA, it is possible that the expression of Sca1
has not been detected previously because of the lack of
resolution of SDS-PAGE analyses. Future efforts will be
put to determine whether the transcription of sca1 is followed by its translation into a protein.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated that the sca1 gene, which encodes
a putative autotransporter protein, is the only sca gene
present in all Rickettsia species. We identified a 488-bp
variable sca1 fragment amplifiable using a pair of conserved primers that may be used as a detection and identification tool for Rickettsia species. Phylogenetic
relationships obtained from the analysis of this gene are
consistent with those obtained from the analyses of other
genes, thus suggesting that this gene is undergoing similar

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/12

evolutionary constraints. The sca1 gene, which is partially
degraded in certain species, is undergoing a dual selection
pressure and is transcribed into mRNA in R. conorii, thus
suggesting that it might be functional. However, as its
putative protein product has not been detected as yet, further studies should aim at determining whether it plays a
role in the immune response observed in patients with
rickettsioses.

Methods
Rickettsial strains
The strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. All rickettsiae were grown on Vero cell monolayers as previously
described [22]. When Gimenez staining [29] showed the
cells to be heavily infected, they were harvested and centrifuged at 1,200 g for 10 min, resuspended in MEM (minimum essential medium, GIBCO) and stored at -70°C
until DNA extraction was performed.
PCR amplification and DNA sequencing
Sca1 gene sequences were retrieved from the four published Rickettsia genomes, i.e., R. conorii (NC_003103), R.
prowazekii (NC_000963), R. typhi (NC_006142), and R.
felis (NC_007109). Primers used for amplification and
sequencing are presented in Table 2. They were designed
by aligning the sca1 sequences from R. conorii and R. felis.

For PCR, genomic DNA was extracted using the Chelex
method as previously described [30]. PCRs were carried
out in a PTC-200 automated thermal cycler (MJ Research,
Waltham, MA) using the eLONGase DNA polymerase
(Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, USA). The 25 µl reaction mixture consisted of (final concentration): primers 12.5 pmol
each, MgCl2 40 mM, dNTP 5 mM each, 2.5 µl of buffer
10×, 0.5 µl eLONGase DNA polymerase, 5 µl of DNA, and
sterile water to a final volume of 25 µl. PCR amplification
was performed under the following conditions: a 3-min
denaturation step at 94°C followed by 40 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 94°C, annealing for 30 s at 50°C and
extension for 90 s at 68°C. Holding for 7 min at 68°C to
allow complete extension of the PCR products completed
the amplification. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels, visualized by staining
with ethidium bromide and then purified using the
QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) as described by the manufacturer. PCR products
were sequenced twice in both directions using the dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction
kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) as proposed
by the manufacturer. Sequencing primers were the same
as PCR primers. Sequencing products were resolved using
an ABI 3100 automated sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's instructions. For each
species the sequence of both DNA strands was determined
twice.

When primers failed to amplify a gene fragment, we used
GenomeWalker DNA walking method. DNA was
extracted using the FastDNA kit and the FastPrep instrument (Bio101, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing was performed using the
Universal Genome Walker Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto,
CA) as proposed by the manufacturer. When GenomeWalker failed to provide sca1 sequences, a mini shotgun
assay was performed using the Eppendorf Perfectprep
Plasmid 96 Vac Direct Bind kit (Brinkmann, Westbury,
NY) as described by the manufacturer.
Sequence assembly was performed using the software
package ABI Prism DNA sequencing analysis software version 3.0 (PE-Applied Biosystems). Sequences were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers detailed in
Table 1.
Identification of a molecular identification target
To identify sca1 sequence fragments variable among Rickettsia species and useable as a PCR target, we used the
Sequence Variability Analysis Program (SVARAP) software [31]. This software determines the genetic diversity
among sequences using a sliding window analysis, by
moving a window of 50 nucleotide positions along the
alignment with a step of one. We focused on fragments of
a maximum size of 500-bp flanked by conserved
sequences in which selection of primers was possible.
Phylogenetic reconstruction
Sca1 nucleic and amino acid sequences were aligned using
the CLUSTALW software [32]. Neighbor-Joining (NJ) and
Maximum Parsimony (MP) phylogenetic reconstructions
were carried out using the MEGA2 software (version 2.1)
[33]. Maximum Likelihood (ML) trees were performed
using the programs PROTML (MOLPHY software package) [34] and PAUP [35] for the protein and nucleotide
alignments, respectively. For the NJ and ML analyses, we
used the JTT model of substitutions for proteins and the
TN93 model for nucleotides. Statistical support for internal branches was assessed by bootstrap sampling for MP
and NJ analyses and Resampling of Estimated Log-Likelihood (RELL) for ML analyses [36].
Analysis of evolutionary forces acting on sca1
The G+C content statistics were obtained using FREQSQ
on the Infobiogen website [37].

Alignments were manually corrected to remove gapped
and ambiguous positions. The sliding-window analysis
was carried out by moving a window of 50 amino acid
positions along the alignment with a step of one. For each
window, we recorded the percentage of positions with
identical residues in all sequences. The passenger domains
of the Sca1 proteins were difficult to align between distant

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/12

Rickettsia owing to a high level of sequence divergence. We
therefore restricted our analysis to the 12 Rickettsia species
presented in Figure 1C to obtain a reliable multiple alignment.
To study the selective forces acting on sca1 proteins, we
determined the ratio ω = Ka/Ks where Ka and Ks are the
rates of non-synonymous and synonymous substitution
accumulations, respectively. In absence of codon utilization bias, as is the case for Rickettsia genes [38], synonymous substitutions are largely free from selection
(neutral) and are accumulated at a rate similar to the
mutation rate. Inversely, because natural selection mainly
acts on protein sequences, non-synonymous substitution
accumulation is correlated with selection. If amino acid
changes are neutral, non-synonymous substitutions will
be fixed at the same rate as synonymous mutations and
therefore ω ≈ 1. If amino acid changes are deleterious,
purifying selection will reduce their fixation rate so that ω
< 1. Finally, when amino acid changes offer a selective
advantage, they will be fixed at a higher rate than synonymous substitutions by positive Darwinian selection, with
ω > 1. We analysed the aligned nucleotide sequences using
six-codon-based models described by Yang et al. [39].
These models explore whether, given a phylogenetic tree
and a codon sequence alignment, variable selective constraints among amino acid sites (ω) are present. Model
M0 assumes a single ω ratio estimated for the whole alignment. Model M1 (neutral) assumes two categories of sites
in the protein: the conserved sites (w = 0) and the neutral
sites (w = 1) and the proportion of sites distributed in the
two classes (p0 and p1 = 1 - p0) are to be estimated from
the data. Model M2 (selection) adds a third class of sites,
with w2 freely estimated. Model M3 assumes 3 categories
of sites with corresponding ω and proportion (p). Finally
model M7 and M8 assume that ω ratios are distributed
among sites according to a beta, which, depending on
parameters p and q, can take different shapes in the interval (0,1). M7 does not allow for positively selected sites,
whereas M8 can, by allowing an additional category of site
with ω as free parameter. The ω ratio and the proportion
of sites were estimated for each codon category by the
maximum likelihood approach implemented in the
codeml program from the paml package [40]. We used the
topology presented in Figure 1C as input tree for codeml.
The goodness of fit of two nested models can be compared using the likelihood ratio test: twice the log-likelihood difference between the two models (2∆lnL = 2 ×
[lnL1 - lnL0]) can be compared to a χ2 distribution, with
the number of degrees of freedom equal to the difference
in the number of free parameters between the two models. Then, to determine whether evolutionary forces acted
differently on the different Rickettsia species, we compared
the Ka/Ks ratios for the different branches in Figure 1A.

RT-PCR assay
In an effort to determine whether sca1 was transcribed
into mRNA, we extracted RNA from R. conorii using the
Rneasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). A one-step
RT-PCR was performed using the Superscript one-step
with Platinum Taq (Gibco-Brl). Within a final volume of
25 µl, we incorporated 2 µl of template RNA, 0.7 µl RT
polymerase, 12.5 2-X reaction buffer, 1 µl of each of the
primers s1.conoF1 and s1.conoR1 (Table 2), and 7.8
RNAse-free distilled water. On a PTC-200 thermal cycler
(MJ Research), cDNA synthesis was performed by a 30min step at 50°C, followed by a step at 95°C. Then, PCR
amplification was conducted using 40 cycles made of a
denaturation step at 95°C for 30 sec, an annealing step at
50°C for 30 sec, and an elongation step at 72°C for 1 min.
The amplification was completed by a final 7-min elongation at 72°C. RT-PCR products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel as described above. RT-PCR products were
sequenced as described above using RT-PCR primers. Distilled sterile water, processed as described above, was used
as negative control. In addition, PCR performed as
described above using RT-PCR primers was performed on
the RNA extract to detect the presence of contaminant
DNA.
