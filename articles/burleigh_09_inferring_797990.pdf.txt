Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic analyses of angiosperm relationships have used only a small percentage
of available sequence data, but phylogenetic data matrices often can be augmented with existing
data, especially if one allows missing characters. We explore the effects on phylogenetic analyses
of adding 378 matK sequences and 240 26S rDNA sequences to the complete 3-gene, 567-taxon
angiosperm phylogenetic matrix of Soltis et al.
Results: We performed maximum likelihood bootstrap analyses of the complete, 3-gene 567taxon data matrix and the incomplete, 5-gene 567-taxon data matrix. Although the 5-gene matrix
has more missing data (27.5%) than the 3-gene data matrix (2.9%), the 5-gene analysis resulted in
higher levels of bootstrap support. Within the 567-taxon tree, the increase in support is most
evident for relationships among the 170 taxa for which both matK and 26S rDNA sequences were
added, and there is little gain in support for relationships among the 119 taxa having neither matK
nor 26S rDNA sequences. The 5-gene analysis also places the enigmatic Hydrostachys in Lamiales
(BS = 97%) rather than in Cornales (BS = 100% in 3-gene analysis). The placement of Hydrostachys
in Lamiales is unprecedented in molecular analyses, but it is consistent with embryological and
morphological data.
Conclusion: Adding available, and often incomplete, sets of sequences to existing data sets can be
a fast and inexpensive way to increase support for phylogenetic relationships and produce novel
and credible new phylogenetic hypotheses.

Background
Molecular data have had an enormous impact on
angiosperm phylogenetic hypotheses (e.g. [1-5]), and the
abundance of new sequence data provides the potential for
further resolving angiosperm relationships. Still, molecular
phylogenetic studies across all angiosperms have utilized
only a small fraction of the available sequence data. While
GenBank currently contains over 1.7 million core nucleotide sequences from angiosperms, with over 160,000 of
these being from often phylogenetically useful plastid loci

[6], few phylogenetic analyses of angiosperms have
included more than a thousand sequences. We examine
whether augmenting existing plant data matrices with
incomplete data assembled from publicly available sources
can enhance the understanding of the backbone phylogenetic relationships across angiosperms.
The sampling strategies of phylogenetic studies across
angiosperms demonstrate a tradeoff between taxonomic
sampling and the number of gene sequences per taxon.

On one extreme, phylogenetic analyses using single genes
such as rbcL [7,8], 18S rDNA [9], and matK [10] have sampled hundreds, or even thousands [8], of taxa. In some
cases, analyses of single genes have provided strong support for many angiosperm relationships (e.g. [10]), but
other parts of the single-gene trees have been unresolved,
in disagreement with other single gene trees (albeit often
without strong support), or simply anomalous (e.g. [7]).
On the other extreme, the advent of chloroplast genome
sequencing has led to phylogenetic analyses of
angiosperms using sequences from up to 81 genes,
although often with limited taxon sampling [11-17]. The
limited taxon sampling can have undesirable effects on
phylogenetic inferences from complete chloroplast
genome sequences, as well as other large molecular data
sets (see [13,14,18,19]). Other studies have used sampling strategies that attempt to compromise between
taxon and gene sampling. For example, Qiu et al. [20,21]
used 5 genes and 105 taxa, and later studies have used 9
genes and 100 taxa [22] or 8 genes and 162 taxa [23].
These studies generally have focused on the basal
angiosperm splits, and more comprehensive taxon sampling is necessary to address backbone relationships
throughout the angiosperms. The most comprehensive
taxon sampling across angiosperms using multiple genes
includes a study using atpB and rbcL [24] and a 567-taxon
study with 18S rDNA, atpB, and rbcL [1-3].
While more data are needed to further resolve backbone
relationships in angiosperms, it is not clear what the most
efficient sampling strategies for adding new data would be.
Previous analyses of molecular data across all angiosperms
mostly used complete or nearly complete data matrices
(but see [25,26]), in which all taxa have sequences from all,
or nearly all, genes. Often it is possible to increase the
number of taxa or genes in a phylogenetic matrix greatly
using existing data by allowing small amounts of missing
data (e.g. [27]). Furthermore, recent simulation studies
have demonstrated that in some cases the total amount of
data in a phylogenetic matrix may determine the performance of a phylogenetic analysis more than the percentage of
missing data [28]. This suggests that adding sequences from
genes with incomplete taxonomic coverage to existing
complete data matrices can, at least in some cases, improve
the phylogenetic inference. Generating large, complete data
matrices can be both logistically daunting (e.g., assembling
DNA samples from all taxa) and prohibitively expensive. In
contrast, there is a wealth of publicly available sequence
data that can be readily assembled into phylogenetic data
matrices, providing a relatively fast and inexpensive way to
augment existing data sets and possibly improve our phylogenetic inferences.
We explore the effect of adding existing plastid matK and
nuclear 26S rDNA sequences to the 3-gene (18S rDNA,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/61

atpB, and rbcL) 567-taxon matrix of P. Soltis et al. ([1], see
also [2,3]). Both matK and the nuclear 26S rDNA have
been informative in large-scale angiosperm phylogenetic
studies (e. g., matK: [10,22,23]; 26S rDNA: [29-32]), and
consequently, sequence data from both genes are available for many angiosperm taxa. We assembled the available 26S rDNA and matK sequences from taxa represented
in the 3-gene matrix and compared results from maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses of the 3-gene 567taxon complete matrix with the 5-gene 567-taxon incomplete matrix. Specifically, we examine if and how augmenting complete data sets with incomplete data affects
our view of angiosperm phylogeny.

Results
Data set
We performed analyses on a 3-gene and a 5-gene data
matrix that have the same set of 567-taxa (Fig. 1). In the
3-gene (18S rDNA, atpB, and rbcL), matrix, all taxa have
sequences from all genes. The matrix is 4592 characters
long and it contains 2.9% missing data, representing
indels or small sections of missing gene sequences. The 5gene matrix comprises the available matK and 26S rDNA
sequences concatenated to the 3-gene matrix. The accession numbers for the matK and 26S rDNA sequences, as
well as the 5-gene character matrix, are included as additional files (see Additional files 1, 2 and 3). In the 5-gene
matrix, 170 (29.9%) taxa have sequences from all 5 genes,
and 119 (20.9%) taxa have data from only the original 3genes (18S rDNA, atpB, and rbcL; Fig. 1). In total 47.0% of
the matK and 26S rDNA alignments are missing data,
largely due to missing whole gene sequences, and overall,
27.5% of the cells in the 5-gene 567-taxon matrix are
missing data.

Summary

orders and informal names follow APG II [4] and Soltis et al. [2,3], with Hydrostachys in Cornales. Numbers above the branches
are bootstrap percentages. This tree was rooted using all gymnosperm taxa as outgroups.
Phylogenetic Analyses
The bootstrap trees from the 5-gene and 3-gene analyses
are included as additional data (see Additional files 4 and
5). The 5-gene ML bootstrap analysis produced higher levels of support than the 3-gene ML bootstrap analysis. First,
the analysis of the 5-gene matrix produced more clades
with high bootstrap support score (Table 1, Figs. 2 and 3;
Additional files 6 and 7). Also, the average quartet similarity among bootstrap trees was higher in the 5-gene analy-

sis than the 3-gene analysis (0.963 vs. 0.934; Table 1).
Still, bootstrap support for some clades, decreased. For
example, bootstrap support for monocot, eudicot, and
core eudicot clades decreased from 99% or 100% in the 3gene analysis to between 76% and 81% the 5-gene analyses (Figs. 2 and 3; Additional files 6 and 7). There are few
major differences in the topologies of the 3-gene and 5gene ML bootstrap 50% majority rule consensus trees, and
these topologies are largely consistent with results from

[3]. Therefore, we include the full bootstrap consensus
trees as additional files (see Additional files 6 and 7).
Perhaps the biggest single change in topology between the
5-gene and 3-gene ML analyses was the position of
Hydrostachys (Figs. 4 and 5), which has a matK but no
26S rDNA sequence in the 5-gene matrix. In the 3-gene
ML analysis, there was 100% bootstrap support for plac-

ing Hydrostachys within Cornales (Fig. 4), which is sister
to all remaining asterids (the Ericales + euasterid I and II
clade) (Figs. 2 and 4). In contrast, the 5-gene ML analysis
placed Hydrostachys in Lamiales (Fig. 5), within the euasterid I clade (Figs. 3 and 5). Although there was 97% bootstrap support for the Lamilaes clade containing
Hydrostachys in the 5-gene analysis, the placement of
Hydrostachys within Lamiales was largely unresolved
(Fig. 5). Within Lamilaes, there was 93% support for a

Jasminum (Fig. 5).
The average taxon quartet similarity, the average quartet
similarity between all pairs of bootstrap trees for only the
quartets that contain the taxon, was higher for every taxon
in the 5-gene analysis than the 3-gene analysis (not
shown). In the 5-gene bootstrap analyses, the taxa with the
lowest average taxon quartet similarity values, or whose
position were least supported (or vary most) among bootstrap trees, are largely from early diverging eudicot clades
(e.g., Santalales, Dilleniaceae, and Berberidopsidales), and
the core eudicots (Gunnerales) (Table 2).
Effects of adding loci with incomplete taxonomic coverage
We further examined the effects of adding incomplete
data sets by comparing the support within the 3-gene and
5-gene, 567-taxon analyses for relationships among the

170 taxa having all five gene sequences (the original three
genes plus both 26S rDNA and matK sequences) and the
119 taxa having neither 26S rDNA nor matK sequences
(Fig. 1). To do this, we examined reduced consensus bootstrap trees (e.g. [33]) that included just the 170 taxa with
data from all 5 genes and also that included only the 119
taxa with data from only 3 genes (missing both matK and
26S rDNA; Figure 1). The reduced consensus trees were
made by pruning all the taxa except the specified sets of
170 or 119 from the 567-taxon bootstrap trees and then
making a majority rule consensus from the pruned bootstrap trees. Adding both matK and 26S rDNA resulted in
greater increases in support among relationships between
the 170 taxa with 5 genes than among the 119 taxa with 3
genes (Table 3). There were increases in the number of
highly supported clades in the reduced consensus tree
containing the 170 taxa with 5 genes, and the average
quartet similarity among the 170-taxon bootstrap trees
increases by 0.044 with the addition of matK and 26S
rDNA (Table 3). In contrast, the number of clades with
100%, ≥95%, and ≥90% bootstrap support in the 119taxon reduced consensus is lower in the 5-gene than in the
3-gene analysis, and the average quartet similarity among
the 119-taxon bootstrap trees increases by only 0.010 with
the addition of matK and 26S rDNA (Table 3).
We next tested the hypothesis that the observed changes
in bootstrap and average quartet similarity scores for relationships among the 170 taxa with 5 genes were greater
than we would expect from a random sample of 170 taxa.
We did this by comparing the observed changes in bootstrap and quartet similarity scores from the 170 taxa with
5 genes to changes in support for relationships among
200 sets of 170 randomly selected taxa. We found significantly greater than expected increases in the number of
clades with 100% bootstrap support and in the average
quartet similarity (p ≤ 0.005; Table 3). Similarly, we tested
to see if the changes in support for relationships among
the 119 taxa with 3 genes were less than we would expect
from a random sample of 119 taxa. We examined changes
in support from 200 sets of 119 randomly selected taxa
and found significantly greater than expected decreases in
the number of clades with 100%, ≥95%, and ≥90% bootstrap support (p ≤ 0.005, 0.05, and 0.01 respectively;
Table 3) and in the average quartet similarity (p ≤ 0.005;
Table 3).

Finally, we compared changes in the average taxon quartet
similarity among bootstrap trees from the 3-gene to the 5gene analysis for all taxa, just the 170 taxa with data from
5 genes, and just the 119 taxa with data from 3 genes. The
mean change in the average taxon quartet similarity for
the 170 5-gene taxa was greater than the mean across all
taxa, and the mean change for the 119 3-gene taxa was less
than that across all taxa (Table 4). The mean change in the
average taxon similarity for the 170 5-gene taxa is greater
than we would expect from a random sample of 170 taxa

(p ≤ 0.001; Table 4), and the mean change for the 119 3gene taxa is less than we would expect from a random sample of 119 taxa (p ≤ 0.001; Table 4).

Discussion
Augmenting existing data sets with other available
sequence data can enhance our understanding of
angiosperm phylogeny, even if the new sequence data are
incomplete. Although adding available matK and 26S
rDNA sequences to the complete 3-gene angiosperm data

set increases the overall percentage of missing data in the
character matrix from 2.9% to 27.5%, analyses with the
new sequences provide higher overall levels of support
than analyses of the original 3 genes alone (Figs. 2 and 3,
Table 1). The gains in support are especially evident in the
relationships among the 170 taxa with both matK and 26S
rDNA sequences (Tables 3 and 4). In contrast, there is little
increase in support for relationships among the 119 taxa
that do not have matK or 26S rDNA sequences (Tables 3
and 4). This relationship between the amount of data and
support suggests that, although incorporating available
sequence data can increase support for much of the tree, a
complete understanding of the relationships among all
taxa likely will require more complete sampling. Specifically, among angiosperms, the average taxon quartet scores
indicate that more data is especially needed to resolve the
early diverging branches within eudicots (Table 2).

The gains in bootstrap and quartet similarity support
resulting from the new matK and 26S rDNA sequences
mostly are incremental, and they do not notably alter our
view of most angiosperm relationships. One major exception is the placement of Hydrostachys, an aquatic genus
from Madagascar and southern Africa, which is in Cornales in the 3-gene ML analyses and the Lamiales in the 5gene ML analyses (Fig. 4). The placement of Hydrostachys
within Lamiales also is strongly supported by maximum
parsimony bootstrap analyses of the 5-gene matrix (Burleigh, unpublished). This new result appears to be driven
by the matK sequences, and an ML analysis of just our
matK data also places Hydrostachys in Lamiales (not
shown). The new Hydrostachys matK sequence was originally included as an outgroup for an analysis of Loasaceae
[34], and it is from not only the same species but the same
vouchered specimen that was used to obtain the data for
the other three genes [Schatz et al. 3413 (MO)].
While the 5-gene analysis provides a new perspective on
the placement of Hydrostachys, its placement has always
been enigmatic. Xiang et al. [35] and Fan and Xiang [36]
placed Hydrostachys among the earlier diverging Cornales
lineages, but these studies did not sample extensively outside Cornales. A 3-gene analysis by Albach et al. [37] also
placed Hydrostachys within in Cornales [38], but the
authors also noted that Hydrostachys had long molecular
branches and few morphological characters to support its
placement in Cornales [38]. In contrast, placement of
Hydrostachys within Lamiales is consistent with embryological [37,39] and floral morphological [40] data. Consequently, it was classified within Lamiales by Dahlgren
[41], Cronquist [42], and Takhtajan [43]. Still, while the
placement of Hydrostachys within Lamiales is intriguing

The support values were obtained from reduced consensus trees, which were made by pruning all but either the selected 170 or 119 taxa from the
bootstrap trees and making a consensus from the pruned trees. The first 5 columns show the number of clades in the reduced consensus trees that
have the specified level of bootstrap support. The last column shows the average percent of quartets (4-taxon unrooted trees) that are identical
between the pruned bootstrap trees. We tested if the observed changes in the bootstrap support or average quartet similarity are greater in the
170 taxa with 5-genes than they would be from a random sample of 170 taxa. Similarly, we tested if the changes in support are less in the 119 taxa
with 3 genes than they would be from a random sample of 119 taxa. Significant results are noted with "*" symbols (* p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤

The average taxon quartet similarity is the average proportion of
quartets (4-taxon unrooted trees) that include a particular taxon that
have the same topology among bootstrap trees. The "170 taxa" are
the taxa with sequences from all 5 genes, while the "119 taxa" are
those with sequences from only the original three genes (18S rDNA,
atpB, rbcL). "Ave. Change" shows the difference in the mean of the
average taxon quartet similarity between the 3-gene and 5-gene ML
bootstrap analyses. We tested if the average change among the 170
taxa is significantly greater than would be expected by randomly
selecting without replacement 1000 sets of 170 taxa. Similarly, we
tested if the average change among the 119 taxa with 3 genes is
significantly less than would be expected by randomly selecting
without replacement 1000 sets of 119 taxa. Both tests were highly
significant (*** = p ≤ 0.001).

and credible, we urge caution in interpreting this result.
Additional molecular data, as well as analyses to examine
the causes for the various molecular results and sources of
phylogenetic error, are necessary to confirm the position
of Hydrostachys.
Adding matK and 26S rDNA sequences with incomplete
taxonomic sampling appears to be beneficial for the inference of the angiosperm phylogeny, but there are still troubling aspects of the 5-gene analysis. Perhaps foremost is
the reduction of bootstrap support for a few well-accepted
clades such as monocots, eudicots, and core eudicots (Fig.
3). In simulation, adding characters with missing data can
decrease the probability of resolving the true phyogeny
[44,45], and this is consistent with a reduction in bootstrap support. Furthermore, adding characters with missing data also can have a similar effect as reducing taxon
sampling; that is, they can effectively increase the length
of branches from sampled taxa and the proportion of
characters that support erroneous topologies [44]. Taxonomic sampling can drastically affect the results of phylogenetic analyses (e.g. [46-48]), and sufficient taxonomic
sampling is an especially relevant concern in analyses of
angiosperm relationships [13,14,17]. Still, there is no
obvious evidence of strong taxon sampling-like error in
the 5-gene analysis. Each of the added genes had
sequences from at least 240 taxa, so no parts of the character matrix had especially poor taxon sampling. Furthermore, bootstrap support for monocots, eudicots, and core
eudicots are still at least 78% (Fig. 3), and, besides the
placement of Hydrostachys, there are few strongly supported, major differences in the 5-gene and 3-gene results.
Our results suggest other directions for future phylogenetic research. In our study, we increased sampling by tak-

ing a fixed set of taxa and adding genes that had many
sequences from these taxa. We might also expand our
sampling by adding new taxa that have sequences from
most or all of the 5-genes (e.g. [25]). This may ameliorate
any potential problems associated with inadequate taxon
sampling. We also note that conventional nonparametric
bootstrapping methods (e.g. [49]) do not explicitly
account for missing data, and it may be profitable to
explore bootstrapping methods explicitly designed for
incomplete data sets (e.g. [50]).

Conclusion
Although there has been much recent progress in elucidating angiosperm phylogeny, there are still many unresolved relationships that are critical to understanding the
angiosperm evolution. New data are needed; yet assembling new, complete data sets across all angiosperms is
both extremely time-consuming and expensive. While
most major analyses of angiosperm relationships have
used complete or nearly complete data sets, this study
demonstrates that exploring new ways to exploit existing
angiosperm data can be a fast, cost-effective, and informative complement to more conventional systematic efforts
to sequence new genes.

thus the total length of the alignment, differs slightly from
previous analyses [[1-3]; see Additional file 3]. Each terminal "taxon" in the 567-taxon matrix represents a single
genus, and in some cases, gene sequences from congeneric
species were combined (see [2]). (The original matrix contains two species from the genus "Saxifraga", but Saxifraga
integrifolia is now Micranthes integrifolia). Thus, we also
added data from some congeneric species for matK and
26S rDNA (see Additional files 1 and 2). We first searched
GenBank for matK sequences from genera that were
included in the original 567-taxon matrix. If multiple
matK sequences were found from a particular genus, we
chose the longest one. Consequently, some of the
sequences include sections of the trnK intron regions that
flank matK. Additionally, we added a new matK sequence
from Gunnera. In total, we had at least partial matK
sequences from 378 of the 567 terminal taxa (Fig. 1; Additional file 2). The matK sequences were aligned using on
the protocol of Hilu et al. [10], and the total matK alignment was 2379 characters in length (Fig. 1; Additional file
3). The 26S rDNA sequence data were taken from previously analyzed data sets [[30-32]; Additional file 1]. They
were aligned using Clustal W [51] and further edited manually, deleting a few small sections in which we could not
confidently determine the homology of characters across
taxa. In total, 240 out of the original 567 taxa have 26S

rDNA sequences, and the 26S rDNA alignment was 3428
characters in length (Fig. 1; see Additional file 3). We concatenated the matK and 26S rDNA sequences to the original 3-locus complete data matrix to generate the 5-locus
data matrix (Fig. 1; Additional file 3). All phylogenetic
analyses were performed on both the 3-gene (18S rDNA,
atpB, and rbcL) 567-taxon data set, which has no missing
gene sequences, and the 5-gene 567-taxon matrix, which
includes taxa with missing gene sequences.
Phylogenetic analyses
For both the 3-gene and 5-gene data matrices, we performed 100 maximum likelihood (ML) bootstrap replicates using GARLI v. 0.951 [52], which implements a
genetic heuristic algorithm for the tree search. We relied
on bootstrap support because 1) we are interested in
directly assessing how adding characters with missing data
affects sampling variance and 2) the 567-taxon data sets
appear to have much trouble reaching stationarity in
Bayesian analyses [3]. All tree searches started from a
neighbor-joining topology [53] and otherwise used the
default settings from GARLI. The likelihood function
incorporated the general time reversible substitution
model (GTR; [54]), which allows different substitution
rates for each type of nucleotide substitution, with rate
variation among sites estimated using a discrete gamma
distribution with four rate categories [55] and a separate
parameter for the percentage of invariable sites. The bootstrapped data sets were generated (sampled with replacement from the original data set) using HyPhy [56]. We
found that the ML estimates of 567-taxon topology using
GARLI occasionally differed, suggesting that that the
GARLI tree search may get trapped in local optima. Therefore, for each bootstrap replicate, we performed 5 runs of
GARLI and selected a tree with the highest likelihood
across the five runs. We also performed maximum parsimony bootstrap analyses on the 3-gene and 5-gene data
sets using a parsimony ratchet search strategy [57] implemented in PAUP* [58]. The overall bootstrap support was
slightly lower than in the ML analyses, but the results were
very similar. Therefore, we just focus on ML results for this
paper.
Comparison of tree topologies
We used two measures to compare levels of support from
the 3-gene and 5-gene phylogenetic analyses. First, we
simply compared the bootstrap support from the two
analyses, specifically the number of partitions (clades in a
rooted tree) that had bootstrap support of 100%, ≥95%,
≥90%, ≥70%, and ≥50%. However, the bootstrap support
for each partition does not describe the support for relationships among all sets of taxa. Therefore, we also used a
measure based on the quartet distance (e.g. [59]) to examine and compare the support in the 3-gene and 5-gene
analyses in more detail.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/61

A quartet is set of four taxa, and it represents the smallest
unit of phylogenetic information in a tree. In a 567-taxon
tree, there are over 4.26 billion possible quartets. The
quartet similarity (or 1- quartet distance) is the percentage
of all quartets with identical unrooted topologies in two
trees. We first calculated the average quartet similarity
between all pairs of bootstrap trees. We also quantified
the phylogenetic support for each taxon in the bootstrap
trees using quartet distances (e.g. [59]). To do this, we
measured the average taxon quartet similarity, which, for a
specified taxon, is the average quartet similarity between
all pairs of bootstrap trees for only the quartets that contain the specified taxon. For example, in the 567-taxon
tree, only just over 30 million of the 4.26 billion possible
quartets involve any single taxon, like Amborella. The average taxon quartet similarity for Amborella measures the
average quartet similarity among all pairs of bootstrap
trees only for the ~30 million quartets that contain
Amborella. Taxa whose positions vary among bootstrap
trees will have lower average taxon quartet similarity
scores than taxa with similar positions among bootstrap
trees. For each set of bootstrap trees, there is a single average quartet similarity score, but there are 567 average
taxon quartet similarity scores, one for each taxon. The
quartet similarity scores were computed with QDist [60]
and a series of perl scripts.
