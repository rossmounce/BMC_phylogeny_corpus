Abstract
Background: The typical antbirds (Thamnophilidae) form a monophyletic and diverse family of suboscine
passerines that inhabit neotropical forests. However, the phylogenetic relationships within this assemblage
are poorly understood. Herein, we present a hypothesis of the generic relationships of this group based
on Bayesian inference analyses of two nuclear introns and the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. The level
of phylogenetic congruence between the individual genes has been investigated utilizing Bayes factors. We
also explore how changes in the substitution models affected the observed incongruence between
partitions of our data set.
Results: The phylogenetic analysis supports both novel relationships, as well as traditional groupings.
Among the more interesting novel relationship suggested is that the Terenura antwrens, the wing-banded
antbird (Myrmornis torquata), the spot-winged antshrike (Pygiptila stellaris) and the russet antshrike
(Thamnistes anabatinus) are sisters to all other typical antbirds. The remaining genera fall into two major
clades. The first includes antshrikes, antvireos and the Herpsilochmus antwrens, while the second clade
consists of most antwren genera, the Myrmeciza antbirds, the "professional" ant-following antbirds, and
allied species. Our results also support previously suggested polyphyly of Myrmotherula antwrens and
Myrmeciza antbirds. The tests of phylogenetic incongruence, using Bayes factors, clearly suggests that
allowing the gene partitions to have separate topology parameters clearly increased the model likelihood.
However, changing a component of the nucleotide substitution model had much higher impact on the
model likelihood.
Conclusions: The phylogenetic results are in broad agreement with traditional classification of the typical
antbirds, but some relationships are unexpected based on external morphology. In these cases their true
affinities may have been obscured by convergent evolution and morphological adaptations to new habitats
or food sources, and genera like Myrmeciza antbirds and the Myrmotherula antwrens obviously need
taxonomic revisions. Although, Bayes factors seem promising for evaluating the relative contribution of
components to an evolutionary model, the results suggests that even if strong evidence for a model
allowing separate topology parameters is found, this might not mean strong evidence for separate gene
phylogenies, as long as vital components of the substitution model are still missing.

Background
The typical antbirds (Thamnophilidae) is a speciose family within the furnariid radiation (sensu [1]) of the New
World suboscine clade. The family includes fully 200 species [2] that all are restricted to neotropical forests. Most
species are arboreal or undergrowth inhabitants, while
only a few members are clearly terrestrially adapted,
which otherwise seems to be the commonest lifestyle for
most members in closely related clades (e.g., gnateaters
Conopophagidae, antpittas Grallariidae, tapaculos Rhinocryptidae, and antthrushes Formicariidae). The highest
diversity of typical antbirds is found in the Amazonian
basin, and differences in ecological specializations make it
possible to find as many as 40 species in the same area [3].
Morphologically typical antbirds shows considerable variation in size and patterns and colors of the plumage
(black and shades of grey, buff and chestnut, with sexual
plumage dimorphism in many species), while the variation in shape is more restricted. Many insectivorous
niches are occupied, but the specialization of some species to follow army ants (to capture escaping insects) is
perhaps the most well known. This habit has also given
raise to the vernacular family name.
In traditional classifications, the antpittas (Grallariidae)
and antthrushes (Formicariidae) were grouped together
with typical antbirds in an even larger family. However,
the support for the expanded antbird family was indeed
weak, and both morphological [4-6] and molecular [1,7]
evidence suggests that antpittas and antthrushes are distantly related to typical antbirds. DNA sequence data [1,8]
suggests that gnateaters (Conopophagidae) forms the sister clade to typical antbirds, while antpittas and antthrushes are more closely related to tapaculos
(Rhinocryptidae),
woodcreepers
and
ovenbirds
(Furnariidae).
Even though the monophyly of typical antbirds seems to
be well supported by both syrinx morphology [6] and
molecular data [1,7] the phylogenetic relationships
within this assemblage are poorly understood, and the
confusion extending to all taxonomic levels. Both the
monophyly of several genera of typical antbirds has been
questioned [3,9,10], as well as the delimitation of certain
species [2,11-14]. Some species have also been moved
from one genus to another (e.g., the black-hooded antwren that has been moved from the genus Myrmotherula to
Formicivora [15]). The current knowledge of the phylogenetic relationships among typical antbirds rests mainly on
interpretations drawn from external features, mostly of
bill and feet, and has remained essentially the same for
150 years [2].
As typical antbirds are morphologically and ecologically
diverse, they form a challenging group for studies of, e.g.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/23

adaptive evolution. However, such studies, as well as biogeographic interpretations, are difficult to make as long as
there is no phylogenetic hypothesis. The aim of this study
is therefore to create a hypothesis of generic relationships
of typical antbirds that could be used as a framework for
more detailed studies of the evolution of the group. Two
nuclear introns, intron 2 in myoglobin and intron 11 in
the
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphodehydrogenase
gene
(G3PDH), and the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene,
have been sequenced for 51 typical antbird taxa representing 38 out of the 45 genera recognized by Ridgely and
Tudor [3]. We have used Bayesian inference and Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to estimate the phylogenetic
relationships.
A common assumption made by molecular systematists is
that gene trees accurately reflect species trees. Nevertheless, different data partitions may have different phylogenies due to processes as lineage sorting, gene duplication
followed by extinction, and lateral transfer by hybridization and introgression (reviewed in [16-18]).
Primarily, there are two contradictory strategies utilized to
handle data sets with significant phylogenetic incongruence between independent data partitions. Advocates for
a "total evidence approach" (e.g., [19,20]) suggest that
available data always should be combined, even though
individual data partitions might be partly incongruent.
The arguments are that a combination of different data
partitions might improve the total resolution as different
data partitions might be useful to resolve different areas of
the tree, and that additive data sets might enhance phylogenetic informative characters that have been hidden by
noise in the individual partitions. Opponents to this view
(e.g., [21,22]) advice that data partitions with a significant
level of incongruence should not be combined, as reliable
characters might be obscured by random or systematic
errors and in the worse case result in an erroneous topology (even though individual data partitions might provide consistent estimates).
However, when independent evidence is lacking and
incongruence occurs between individual data partitions, it
may be difficult to determine whether particular partitions are better estimates of the species tree than others.
Researchers might favor the "total evidence approach" for
this particular reason (even though the argument for not
combining data partitions with significant levels of incongruence have strong merits). However, the degree of
incongruence between individual gene trees could be used
to determine whether the phylogenetic conclusions
should be based on the combined data set, or only those
parts that are similar among the different partitions. A
commonly used approach for analysing combined data
with maximum likelihood is to assume a single (the

same) substitution model for all of the combined genes
(for exceptions, see [23,24]). A significant result of incongruence between the combined result and the individual
genes can then be hard to explain, since the incongruence
could be due to both true difference in gene phylogeny
and a misfit in the assumed model of evolution for the
combined data [21,25]. This misfit could, for example, be
a result of not allowing a heterogeneous model, that is,
not allowing the different genes to have separate substitution models in the combined analysis [26]. We have thus
explored our data partitions (the individual genes) by the
congruence test described by Nylander et al. [27], which
utilizes Bayes factors. The test is not an explicit significance test but compares the strength of evidence between
two models of character evolution.
Although nuclear genes (as when situated on different
chromosomes) may be considered as members of different linkage groups, the maternally inherited mitochondrial genome is effectively independent from the nuclear
genome. Organelle genomes have also been suggested to
more susceptible to "flow" between taxa during hybridization (although much less common in animals than in
plants). In birds Degnan and Moritz [28] and Degnan
[29], for example, have demonstrated that the mitochondrial tree in Australian white-eyes misrepresented the tree
of nuclear loci and the expected species tree, possibly due
to previous hybridization events. We have thus primarily
been interested in the potential incongruence between the
mitochondrial cytochrome b and the two nuclear genes
(myoglobin and G3PDH), but all combinations of the
three genes were examined. However, limitations in the
substitution models might be the most important explanation to observed incongruence between data partitions,
rather than an intrinsic phylogenetic incongruence [27].
We also explored how changes in substitution models
affected the observed incongruence in our data set.

Results
Molecular variation and sequence distances
After alignment, the concatenated sequences become
2173 bp long. A total of between 679 bp (Sclerurus scansor) and 723 bp (Myrmotherula leucophthalma) was
obtained from myoglobin intron 2, between 351 bp (Rhegmatorina melanosticta) and 400 bp (Myrmeciza griseiceps)
from G3PDH intron 11, and 999 bp from cytochrome b.
The observed, pairwise distances between ingroup taxa
range between 0, 7% and 10, 7% in myoglobin, between
0, 3% and 19, 3% in G3PDH and between 6, 5% and 23,
9% in cytochrome b. Indels were found both in the
myoglobin intron 2 and in the G3PDH intron 11. In most
cases these are autapomorphic indels or occur in especially variable and repeatable regions. Given the tree
topologies obtained from the Bayesian analyses, some
synapomorphic indels were observed. For example, all

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/23

Thamnophilus representatives share with Sakesphorus bernardi an insertion in the G3PDH intron, and, together
with Dysithamnus mentalis and Herpsilochmus atricapillus,
an insertion in the myoglobin intron.
Phylogenetic inference and molecular models
A priori selection of substitution models showed that
fairly parameter rich models were the best fit for all data
partitions. Importantly, modeling rate variation seemed
to be an important component. For the cytochrome b partition the GTR+I+Γ was the best fit, and for myoglobin
intron 2, it was the GTR+ Γ. For the G3PDH intron 11 the
somewhat simpler HKY+ Γ model was chosen. These
models were used in the consecutive MCMC of the individual genes as well in the combined analysis. The parameter estimates from the two separate MCMC runs for each
data set were found to be very similar (data not shown),
thus allowing an inference from the concatenated output.
After discarding the burn-in phase the inference for the
cytochrome b was based on a total of 36, 000 samples
from the posterior, for myoglobin the inference was based
on 38, 000 samples, and for G3PDH and the combined
data, inference were based on 38, 000, and 55, 600 samples, respectively. For the phylogenetic inference, the
mode of the posterior distribution of topologies was presented as a majority-rule consensus tree from each analysis (Figures 1,2,3,4).

The trees obtained from the Bayesian analyses of the individual genes (cytochrome b, myoglobin and G3PDH) and
the combined data set all differ in topology and degree of
resolution. The G3PDH gene produced the poorest
resolved tree (Figure 1) and also contains the smallest
number of nodes with posterior probability values above
0.90. The myoglobin (Figure 2) and cytochrome b (Figure
3) genes produced trees with similar degree of resolution
and nodal supports, but there is a weak tendency for cytochrome b giving better resolution and support at terminal
nodes. The combined data set (cytochrome b, myoglobin
and G3PDH) produced the most resolved tree (Figure 4)
with the highest number of strongly supported nodes
(exceeding 0.90 posterior probability). Overall, the
myoglobin, the cytochrome b and the combined trees are
topologically rather similar, while the G3PDH tree is the
most deviant. A common pattern in all trees is that several
nodes are unresolved, or short with low or intermediate
posterior probabilities support values (0.50–0.90). The
observed topological conflicts between the obtained trees
generally occur at these short nodes, and there are only a
few nodes with posterior probabilities values above 0.90
that are in conflict between the trees. Of these, one concerns the outgroup relationships (the G3PDH tree supports with 0.96 posterior probability a position of
Pteroptochos tarnii that differs from all other trees). The
other two conflicts concern internal relationships within

well supported sub-clades: The cytochrome b tree places
with 0.98 posterior probability Myrmotherula menetriesii
basal to a clade consisting of Myrmotherula axillaris, Myrmotherula behni and Formicivora rufa. In the combined tree
Myrmotherula menetriesii instead is nested within this clade
with 1.00 posterior probability. The myoglobin tree suggests with 0.94 posterior probability that Taraba major is
basal to Batara cinerea and Hypoedaleus guttatus, while
Taraba major is basal also to Mackenziaena severa and Frederickena unduligera with 0.99 posterior probability in both
the combined and the cytochrome b trees.
However, most suggested relationships are congruently
supported by more than one of the trees obtained from
the individual genes and by the combined data set. Several
clades are also supported by all three genes trees as well as
by the combined data set, including the recognition of a
monophyletic origins of 1) the "large antshrikes" (Taraba
major, Batara cinerea, Hypoedaleus guttatus, Mackenziaena
severa, and Frederickena unduligera), 2) the "professional"
ant-following antbirds (Pithys albifrons, Phlegopsis erythroptera, Phaenostictus mcleannani, Rhegmatorhina melanosticta
and Gymnopithys leucaspis), 3) a Sakesphorus-Thamnophilus
antshrike lineage (Sakesphorus bernardi and the five representatives of the genus Thamnophilus), and 4) a clade consisting of the wing-banded antbirds (Myrmornis torquata),
the spot-winged antshrike (Pygiptila stellaris) and the russet antshrike (Thamnistes anabatinus). Sistergroup relationships between antvireos (Dysithamnus mentalis) and
Herpsilochmus antwrens (Herpsilochmus atricapillus), as
well as between Myrmotherula obscura and Myrmochanes
hemileucus are also recognized by all trees.
Based on the tree obtained from the Bayesian analysis of
the combined data set, typical antbirds could also be
divided into three major clades (marked as A, B and C in
Figure 4). The first clade (clade A) includes four genera
that are suggested to have a basal position in relation to all
other typical antbirds (1.00 posterior probability in the
combined tree). This basal group (supported by 0.72 posterior probability in the combined tree) includes the representative of Terenura antwrens (Terenura humeralis), the
wing-banded antbird (Myrmornis torquata), the spotwinged antshrike (Pygiptila stellaris) and the russet antshrike (Thamnistes anabatinus).
The second clade (clade B, Figure 4) is supported by 0.95
posterior probability in the combined tree and includes
all antshrike genera (except the spot-winged antshrike and
the russet antshrike, see clade A), antvireos (Dysithamnus),
Herpsilochmus antwrens and the banded antbird (Dichrozona cincta). Within this large clade several lineages occur
that receives more than 0.95 posterior probability. Noticeable within this clade is that neither the analyses of the
individual genes nor the combined data set conclusively

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/23

support that the representative of the antshrike genus
Sakesphorus (Sakesphorus bernardi) is phylogenetically separated from the Thamnophilus antshrikes.
The last clade (clade C, Figure 4), including the Myrmeciza
antbirds, most antwren genera (e.g., Myrmotherula and
Formicivora), the "professional" ant-following antbirds,
and some allied species, is supported by a 1.00 posterior
probability value. Also within this clade several lineages
are supported by posterior probability values above 0.90.
However, the most interesting observation is the strong
support for a polyphyletic origin of the Myrmeciza antbirds and the Myrmotherula antwrens.
Tests of incongruence
The Bayes factor tests showed extensive incongruence
between partitions, at least in the sense that relaxing the
assumption of a common topology parameter always
gave a better model likelihood (Table 1). For example,
allowing the cytochrome b partition to have a separate
topology from the two nuclear partitions myoglobin and
G3PDH, gave a 2logB12 of 60.8. This value strongly suggests that an unlinked model is superior to the model
assuming a common topology parameter for all partitions. This would also suggest that there is strong conflict
between the mitochondrial and the nuclear partitions.
However, this conclusion is far from conclusive when we
consider the linking of the topology parameter for other
combinations of the data. Combining the topology
parameter for either one of the nuclear partitions with the
mitochondrial, actually gives a better model (higher Bayes
factors) than considering the mitochondrial vs. the
nuclear partition (Table 1). For example, compared to the
model that assumes a common topology parameter,
unlinking the myoglobin partition from the other gave a
2logB of 102.26. Unlinking the G3PDH partition gave an
even better model, with a 2logB of 118.12. Furthermore,
if we would have to choose the one partitioning scheme
that had the highest model likelihood, the model allowing a separate topology parameter for all partitions would
be the clear choice (having a 2logB of 241.36 compared to
the common model).

The parsimony based ILD-test did not find a significant
incongruence between the three gene partitions (p =
0.967).

Discussion
Phylogenetic incongruence between gene partitions
Allowing the gene partitions to have separate topology
parameters clearly increased the model likelihood. That is,
the unlinked models clearly had a better fit to the data
than the linked models. Judging from the absolute value
of the 2logB (Table 1), we are inclined to conclude that we
should treat each partition as having its own posterior

distribution of trees. However, the question is if we from
these results really can say that the gene partitions evolved
on different phylogenies? There are several reasons why
different data partitions may have different phylogenies,
although being sampled from the same taxa, or even the
same individuals (se above). We cannot completely rule
out the occurrence of any of these processes in our data.
However, we believe that the interpretation based solely
on Bayes factors might be hazardous. For instance, is it
plausible that all three gene partitions had evolved on
three different phylogenies, or that the linking of cytochrome b and myoglobin is a more reasonable partition of
the data, instead of the mitochondrial versus the nuclear
partitions? Nylander et al. [27], speculate that limitations
in the substitution models might be more reasonable
explanations to the high Bayes factors observed when
comparing unlinked and linked models. Changing a component of the nucleotide substitution model, e.g. adding
parameters to model rate variation, had much higher
impact on the model likelihood than unlinking
parameters among data partition. To illustrate the impact
of changing the substitution model in our data, we run
additional MCMC analyses under a different set of models, and compared them with the previous analyses using
Bayes factors. The results were striking (Table 2). For
example, we compared two models without rate variation,
one with linked and the other with unlinked topologies

(in both models GTR was used for cytochrome b and for
myoglobin, and HKY for the G3PDH). The 2logB was
295.98 in favor for the unlinked model. However, adding
parameters for modeling rate variation to either of the two
models increased the model likelihood tremendously.
The 2logB in favor of a model having parameters for rate
variation (applying the same substitution models as the
ones chosen a priori using AIC, see material and methods), varied between 5125.22 and 5662.56, depending on
the model being compared (Table 2). Similar observations of magnitude changes in Bayes factors were made by
Nylander et al. [27], when allowing rate variation.
Another striking feature was that once parameters for
modeling rate variation had been incorporated into the
model, unlinking topologies did not seem to have as pronounced effect on the model likelihood (Table 2), compared to the models without rate variation. This
observation is in concordance with previous findings that
many functional genes have a strong among-site rate variation and that adding the relevant parameters to the
model is likely to have a large effect on the likelihood
[23,27,30,31].
It is worth noting that the parsimony based ILD-test did
not find a significant incongruence between the three
gene partitions. The value of this observation is uncertain,
however, as the ILD test is based on another optimality

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:23

criterion (parsimony). Furthermore, the strength of the
test and interpretation of the results have also been questioned (e.g., [32])
In conclusion, allowing partitions to have separate topology parameters put fewer restrictions on the data. Hence,
we should expect to find a better fit of the model to the
data. Bayes factors seem promising for evaluating the
relative contribution of components to an evolutionary
model. However, judging from the relative increase in
model likelihood when unlinking topologies compared
to e.g., adding parameters for rate variation, we would
anticipate components in the substitution model (for
example, allowing rate variation among lineages) to have
more effects on accommodating incongruence in the data.
That is, even if we find strong evidence for a model allowing separate topology parameters, this might not mean
strong evidence for separate gene phylogenies, as long as
vital components of the substitution model are still missing. For further discussions on Bayesian approaches to
combined data issues see e.g., [25,26,33].
Phylogeny and morphological variation in typical antbirds
Even though we are unable to conclusively tell whether
the observed phylogenetic incongruence between the
individual gene partitions is due to genuine differences in
phylogeny, or to limitations in the models used, we
believe that the tree obtained from the combined data set
represents the best estimate of the true relationships
within the typical antbird assemblage. Obviously, several
relationships are strongly supported, by congruent recognition by the individual gene trees and/or by high nodal
support values. Nevertheless, other relationships have to
be regarded as tentative, and especially those where any of
the individual gene trees gives a strong nodal support for
an alternative topology.

It is noticeable that, although the individual genes congruently support several terminal groups, basal relationships are generally less well resolved and more often in
conflict. Even though this observation might be biased
due to the use of improper molecular models when calculating the trees, biased mutation rate in studied genes, or
a biased taxon sampling, it could indicate that the diversifications of typical antbirds was characterized by some
rapid speciation bursts. There are only a few recent studies
of typical antbirds with taxon samplings that includes
representatives from several genera, but these studies
show similar difficulties in resolving generic relationships. For example, in a study of phylogenetic relationships of Myrmotherula antwrens that included
representatives from several other typical antbird genera,
Hackett and Rosenberg [10] obtained considerably different topologies from plumage characters, allozyme and
morphometric data, respectively. In addition, the phylo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/23

genetic relationships suggested from mitochondrial DNA
sequence data within a partly comparable taxon sampling
[9], have little resemblance to those in Hackett and Rosenberg [10]. The nodes between typical antbirds in the DNADNA hybridization "tapestry" by Sibley and Ahlquist [[7]:
Figure 372] also contain a high degree of short branches.
It is also apparent that earlier antbird taxonomists, using
external morphology, had difficulties in their taxonomic
decisions and interpretations of higher-level relationships. Ridgway [[34]: p. 9] expressed that "The classification of this group is very difficult, more so probably than
in the case of any American family of birds". Hackett and
Rosenberg [10] concluded that antwren speciation mainly
has been followed by plumage differentiation (and to
some degree size differentiation) rather than changes in
body proportions. Overall, this evolutionary pattern, with
great changes in plumage and more limited changes in
body proportions, seems to characterize the entire typical
antbird assemblage (in contrast to the situation in ovenbirds, where there is a great variation in body proportions
but not in plumage characters). However, Hackett and
Rosenberg [10] suggested that neither plumage nor morphometric data correctly predicted the genetic relationships among the studied taxa. Our results seem to support
their assumption as the traditionally used plumage characters in typical antbirds, as stripes, wingbars, and general
coloration; seem to be irregularly distributed in the phylogenetic tree. It is reasonable to assume that plumage
characters in typical antbirds are variable to such a degree
that they are of limited use in studies of higher-level relationships. High levels of homoplasy (convergences and
reversals) in plumage characters have also been reported
in other passerine birds e.g., in Australian scrubwrens [35]
brush-finches [36], and in New World orioles [37].
However, if excluding members in the "basal" group
(clade A, Figure 4) and a few other aberrant taxa, the division of typical antbirds into the two main lineages in our
phylogeny (clade B and C, Figure 4) is overall in good
agreement with their body proportions (although there is
a considerable size variation within both clades). The antshrikes (excluding Tamnistes and Pygiptila), antvireos and
Herpsilochmus antwrens in clade B (Figure 4) are all more
or less robust birds with heavy and prominently hooked
bills, and many of them have a barred plumage pattern.
The taxa in clade C (Figure 4), which includes most antwren genera, the Myrmeciza antbirds, the "professional"
ant-following antbirds and some allied species, are generally slimmer birds with longer, thinner bills that have a
less prominent hook. Most suggested relationships within
clade B and C are in good agreement with traditional classifications. The recognition of monophyletic origins of
most of the "professional" ant-following taxa (Phaenostictus, Gymnopithys, Rhegmatorhina, Pithys and Phlegopsis) and

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:23

the "large" antshrikes (Taraba, Hypoedaleus, Batara, Frederickena and Mackenziaena) are two examples where our
results are congruent with traditional classifications. The
suggested relationships between the Hypocnemis and Drymophila antbirds, and the Herpsilochmus antwrens and the
antvireos (Dysithamnus), respectively, have also been proposed previously based on molecular data [9,10].
Unfortunately, the genera Biatas, Clytoctantes, Percnostola,
Rhopornis, Stymphalornis and Xenornis were lacking in our
study; while most of these should probably be referred to
Clade C, Biatas is difficult to place.
Some novel relationships and the phylogenetic positions of
some aberrant taxa
For certain taxa the position in our combined phylogeny
is unexpected considering the external morphology and
traditional classification. Most noticeable are the position
of the banded antbird (Dichrozona cincta), which is nested
within the clade with antshrikes, antvireos and Herpsilochmus antwrens (clade B, Figure 4), and the position of the
wing-banded antbird (Myrmornis torquata) as sister to the
russet antshrike (Thamnistes anabatinus) and the spotwinged antshrike (Pygiptila stellaris) (clade A, Figure 4).
However, the increased number of molecular based phylogenies in recent years have led to discoveries of several
examples, at different phylogenetic levels, were birds have
been misclassified due to significant morphological differences from the taxa to which they are most closely
related [38-40].

The phylogenetic position of the wing-banded antbird
(Myrmornis torquata) has long been obscured and it was
long placed with the typical army-ant followers (e.g., [2]).
The wing-banded antbird has also been suspected to be
related to ground antbirds (Formicariidae sensu [7])
based on similarities in morphology and general appearance [7]. Our results confidently place it within typical
antbirds, a conclusion further supported by its vocalization [2] and choice of nest site and its white egg [41]. The
well supported relationship to the arboreal russet antshrike (Thamnistes anabatinus) and spot-winged antshrike
(Pygiptila stellaris), suggested by our data, has apparently
been obscured by structural differences caused by its adaptation to a terrestrial life-style shared with for example the
antthrushes. A similar explanation may apply to the peculiar position of the banded antbird (Dichrozona cincta) in
the combined phylogeny, as this taxon is also a mainly
terrestrial bird, unlike the other members in the "antshrike" clade (clade B, Figure 4). The fact that the banded
antbird has a rather long branch in the combined tree and
that its phylogenetic position alter between the individual
gene trees, leads us to consider the phylogenetic position
of the banded antbird (Dichrozona cincta) as preliminary.
However, it is obvious that it is not closely related to the
Hylophylax antbirds with which it has traditionally been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/23

grouped (based on similarities in plumage patterns and
weak sexual dimorphism). It should be noted that, due to
the peculiar position of Dichrozona cincta, a second individual (ZMUC 128217) have been sequenced for all three
genes. There were no variation at all found between the
two individuals in G3PDH, in myoglobin 1 ambiguous
position were found, and in cytochrome b 24 base pairs
(2.4%) that differed as well as 3 ambiguous positions
were found. Overall, this variation is within the variation
that could be suspected between individuals within a species. Thus, the strange position of Dichrozona cincta in our
analyses is unlikely to be due to sample or sequence mixup.
There are several other, less striking examples where the
position of taxa in our phylogeny conflicts with relationships suggested in classifications based on external morphology. The Herpsilochmus antwrens for example
(traditionally placed among Myrmotherula, Microrhopias
and Formicivora antwrens), are quite different in appearance from their sister group Dysithamnus in being rather
slim, lacking a particularly hook-bill, and in having a distinctly patterned plumage (however, as discussed above a
close relationship between Herpsilochmus and Dysithamnus
is also supported by an independent molecular study).
Other examples are the positions of Myrmorchilus and
Neoctantes, respectively (see discussion below). In these
cases their true affinities may have been obscured by morphological adaptations to habitats or food sources that
differ from those preferred by their closest relatives.
The strong support in the combined tree for basal positions of Myrmornis, Pygiptila, Thamnistes and Terenura relative to all other typical antbirds is maybe the most
unexpected result of our study. In a majority of classifications Terenura is placed close to other antwrens, but with
no strong data support. Although the precise position of
the Terenura antwrens is partly ambiguous in our analysis,
they obviously belong to an ancient radiation that is only
distantly related to the other "antwrens". The Terenura
antwrens differ from other "antwrens" in plumage pattern
and in being more slender and warbler-like with a thinner
bill and longer tail. In a study based on mitochondrial
DNA the position of Terenura was ambiguous depending
on how the data set was analyzed [9] but clearly it was not
closely related to the other taxa included in that study
(e.g., Myrmotherula, Formicivora, Herpsilochmus, Hypocnemis, Drymophila).
The well-supported phylogenetic position of Pygiptila and
Thamnistes as the sistergroup to Myrmornis (instead of
being close to other antshrikes as suggested in many linear
classifications), is novel. However, Pygiptila and Thamnistes resemble each other in their ways of feeding in the
sub-canopy, Thamnistes also resembling the Pygiptila

Page 11 of 16

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:23

female in appearance, and differing from most antshrikes
in feeding behavior. DNA-DNA hybridization data [7]
and protein electrophoresis [10] have previously shown
Pygiptila to be genetically distant from the Thamnophilus
antshrikes. The general external resemblance of Pygiptila
and Thamnistes to other antshrikes is therefore best
explained, as being plesiomorphic, and this may also be
the case with their suspended nest-type.
The polyphyly of Myrmotherula antwrens and
Myrmeciza antbirds
Our results confirm both previous molecular studies that
suggest the Myrmotherula antwrens are polyphyletic
[9,10], and the suspicion based on morphology that also
the rather diverse genus Myrmeciza constitutes an unnatural taxon [3]. Nevetheless, most Myrmeciza antbirds studied herein belong to the same clade, although they are not
monophyletic as several other genera (Myrmoborus, Gymnocichla, Pyriglena, Sclateria, Schistocichla, Hypocnemoides,
and Hylophylax) are nested among them. However, the
chestnut-tailed antbird (Myrmeciza hemimelaena), which
represents a group of small and slim Myrmeciza antbirds
with prominent wing spots in both sexes, groups with the
Drymophila, Hypocnemis and Cercomacra antbirds. The
small and slim Myrmeciza antbirds resembles morphologically the Hypocnemis antbirds in having similar wing
spots as well as a rather short and rufous-brown tail.

The clade that includes the remaining Myrmeciza antbirds
consists of three unresolved lineage. The first includes a
group of large and heavily built Myrmeciza antbirds (represented by Myrmeciza fortis). Next outside this group is
the fire-eye (Pyriglena leuconota), followed by the barecrowned antbird (Gymnocichla nudiceps) and the Myrmoborus antbird representative (Myrmoborus myotherinus).
These taxa have rather stout bodies and in most cases red
eyes. Both the fire-eyes and the bare-crowned antbird were
previously assumed to be related to the large, heavy-billed
Myrmeciza antbirds (e.g., [3]). The second lineage consists
of the silvered antbird (Sclateria naevia) and the Schistocichla antbird representative (Schistocichla leucostigma).
These relationships are in good agreement with the overall plumage characters in these taxa [3], with the males
being rather uniform gray while the females are rufous.
Such a plumage is also found in the genus Percnostola,
with which the Schistocichla antbirds are considered to be
most closely related (Schistocichla and Percnostola have
even been regarded as congeneric, but it has also been suggested that Percnostola could be polyphyletic).
In the third lineage, Myrmeciza griseiceps and Myrmeciza
berlepschi form the sister clade to Myrmeciza loricata, Hypocnemoides maculicauda and Hylophylax naevia (the latter two
are sister taxa). This group consists of rather typical
shaped and sized "Myrmeciza" antbirds. Although it has a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/23

shorter tail, Hylophylax naevia shares plumage pattern with
Myrmeciza loricata (Hypocnemoides maculicauda is more
discretely patterned), while Myrmeciza griseiceps and
Myrmeciza berleschi, on the other hand, are more uniformly colored birds.
A non-monophyletic origin of Myrmotherula antwrens,
suggested by our data, agrees with the results of previous
molecular studies [9,10]. The results also support Hackett
and Rosenberg's [10] protein electrophoresis data suggesting that the "gray" and "streaked" forms of Myrmotherula
antwrens are more closely related to each other than either
is to the "checker-throated" forms. The combined tree
(Figure 4, clade C) suggests that the Myrmotherula antwrens evolved along two separate phylogenetic lineages. In
the first, the "checker-throated" forms (Myrmotherula fulviventris and Myrmotherula leucophthalma) group with the
black bushbird (Neoctantes niger) and constitute the sister
to the dot-winged antwren (Microrhopias quixensis) and
the stripe-backed antbird (Myrmorchilus strigilatus). Based
on the external morphology these taxa indeed constitute a
rather heterogeneous group. For example, the stripebacked antbird has previously been suggested to be
related to Formicivora and Drymophila antwrens [42],
which are distantly related according to our results.
However, Neoctantes, Microrhopias and Myrmorchilus are
monotypic genera that lack obvious close relatives. Myrmorchilus is essentially a terrestrial bird, living in chaco
scrub, thus differing in habits and habitat from the "typical" antwren lifestyle. Neoctantes lives in humid forest like
most Myrmotherula antwrens, but its bill is modified to
hammers on stems, vines etc., and to be used as a wedge
to pry off strips of bark [2]. The morphological differences
between Neoctantes and Myrmorchilus on one hand, and
the "checker-throated" Myrmotherula antwrens on the
other, could thus be the result of adaptive specializations
in the former taxa.
In the second lineage of Myrmotherula antwrens, the
"streaked" forms represented by the short-billed antwren
(Myrmotherula obscura) and the black-and-white antbird
(Myrmochanes hemileucus) form the sister group to the
"gray" forms (represented by Myrmotherula menetriesii,
axillaris and behni) and Formicivora rufa. Although the support for nesting Formicivora rufa among the "gray" forms
of Myrmotherula is rather weak, it suggests that the generic
boundary between Formicivora and "gray" Myrmotherula
antwren is far from unambiguously settled. This is also
indicated by the recent transfer of the black-hooded antwren from the genus Myrmotherula to Formicivora [15].
Bates et al. [9] also found a close relationship between
Myrmotherula longipennis (belonging to the "gray" form of
Myrmotherula antwrens) and the genus Formicivora (Formicivora grisea and Formicivora rufa).

Conclusions
The phylogenetic results support that most antbirds could
be divided into two major clades that are in broad agreement with traditional classifications. The first clade
includes most antshrike genera, antvireos and the Herpsilochmus antwrens, while the second clade consists of the
Myrmeciza antbirds, the "professional" ant-following antbirds, and allied. However, some relationships within
these clades, as well as the support for that Terenura antwrens, the wing-banded antbird (Myrmornis torquata), the
spot-winged antshrike (Pygiptila stellaris) and the russet
antshrike (Thamnistes anabatinus) are basal to all other
typical antbirds, are unexpected based on external morphology. Possibly the true affinities of these taxa have
been obscured by morphological convergence due to
adaptations to new habitats or food sources. Our results
also strongly support that both the Myrmeciza antbirds
and the Myrmotherula antwrens are unnatural groupings
in need for taxonomic revisions. Also certain other taxa
may be unnatural units, but definitive conclusions must
await future analyses involving more taxa.
Bayes factors seem promising for evaluating the relative
contribution of components to an evolutionary model.
However, changing a component of the nucleotide substitution model, e.g. adding parameters to model rate variation, had much higher impact on the model likelihood
than unlinking parameters among data partition. Thus,
even though strong evidence for a model allowing separate topology parameters is found, this might not mean
strong evidence for separate gene phylogenies, as long as
vital components of the substitution model are still
missing.

Methods
Taxon sampling, amplification and sequencing
Totally 51 typical antbird species were selected for the
molecular analyses, including representatives from 38
genera out of 45 genera recognized by Ridgely and Tudor
[3]. From some antbird genera (Myrmeciza, Myrmotherula
and Thamnophilus) several species were included, as the
monophyly for these genera had been questioned
[3,9,10]. The phylogenetic trees were rooted using representatives from major furnariid lineages suggested by
Irestedt et al. [1]. Sample identifications and GenBank
accession numbers are given in Table 3 (see additional file
1).

Nucleotide sequence data were obtained from two nuclear
introns, myoglobin intron 2 and the glyceraldehydes-3phosphodehydrogenase (G3PDH) intron 11, and from
the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. The complete
myoglobin intron 2 (along with 13 bp and 10 bp of the
flanking regions of exons 2 and 3, respectively) corresponding to the region between positions 303 (exon 2)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/23

and 400 (exon 3) in humans (GenBank accession number
XM009949) and the complete G3PDH intron 11 (including 36 bp and 18 bp of exons 11 and 12, respectively) corresponding to the region 3915 to 4327 in Gallus gallus
(GenBank accession number M11213) were sequenced.
From the cytochrome b gene 999 bp were obtained corresponding to positions 15037 to 16035 in the chicken
mitochondrial genome sequence [43]. Some indels were
observed in the alignments of myoglobin intron 2 and the
G3PDH intron 11, respectively (see results), but all gaps
in the sequences were treated as missing data in the analyses. No insertions, deletions, stop or nonsense codons
were observed in any of the cytochrome b sequences.
Extraction, amplification and sequencing procedures for
cytochrome b and myoglobin intron 2 follow the descriptions in Ericson et al. [44] and Irestedt et al. [1]. A protocol
described by Fjeldså et al. [45] was followed for the amplification and sequencing of the G3PDH intron.
For each gene and taxon, multiple sequence fragments
were obtained by sequencing with different primers.
These sequences were assembled to complete sequences
with SeqMan II™ (DNASTAR inc.). Positions where the
nucleotide could not be determined with certainty were
coded with the appropriate IUPAC code. Due to a rather
low number of insertions in myoglobin intron 2 and
G3PDH intron 11 the combined sequences could easily
be aligned by eye.
Phylogenetic inference and model selection
We used Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) for estimating phylogenetic hypothesis
from DNA data (see recent reviews by Holder and Lewis,
[46]; Huelsenbeck et al., [47]). Bayesian inference of phylogeny aims at estimating the posterior probabilities of
trees and other parameters of an evolutionary model.
Importantly, two components need to be specified (apart
from the data): the model of nucleotide substitution and
the prior distributions for the parameters in that model.
The models for nucleotide substitutions were selected for
each gene individually, prior to the MCMC, and using the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC [48]). This was done
using the program MrModeltest [49] in conjunction with
PAUP* [50]. Specifically, MrModeltest compares 24
standard substitution models, including models allowing
rate variation, utilizing the likelihood scores calculated by
PAUP* on an initial, approximate phylogeny (see e.g.,
[51]).

After models had been selected for the individual gene
partitions, prior distributions for the model parameters
were specified. For stationary state frequencies, we used a
flat Dirichlet prior, Dir(1, 1, 1, 1). A Dirichlet prior, Dir(1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1) were also used for the nucleotide substitution

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:23

rate ratios of the general time-reversible model (GTR [5254]). A Beta distribution, Beta(1, 1), were used for the
transition/transversion rate ratio of the HasegawaKishino-Yano model (HKY [55]). A uniform prior,
Uni(0.1, 50), was used on the shape parameter of the
gamma distribution of rate variation (Γ [56]), and a
Uni(0, 1) prior was used for the proportion of invariable
sites (I [57]). An exponential prior, Exp(10), were used for
branch lengths, and all trees were assumed to be equally
likely (flat prior on topology).
The posterior probabilities of trees and parameters in the
substitution models were approximated with MCMC and
Metropolis coupling using the program MrBayes [58]. The
gene partitions were analyzed both separately and combined. In the combined analysis, each gene partition was
allowed to have separate parameters by using a rate multiplier [27,58,59]. One cold and three incrementally
heated chains were run for 3 million generations, with a
random starting tree and a temperature parameter value
of 0.2. Trees were sampled every 100th generations, and
the trees sampled during the burn-in phase (i.e., before
the chain had reached its apparent target distribution)
were discarded. Two runs, starting from different, randomly chosen trees, were made to ensure that the individual runs had converged on the same target distribution
[60]. Convergence of parameters was checked by examining parameter means and variances between runs. After
checking for convergence, final inference was made from
the concatenated output from the two runs.
A Bayesian test of incongruence
Bayesian methods provide us ways not only to estimate
posterior probabilities for trees and parameters in a
model, but also to evaluate the model itself. Bayes factors
[61], allow us to make sophisticated comparisons
between models used in phylogenetic analyses
[27,62,63]. Bayes factors measure the strength of evidence
in favor of one model M1 compared to another M2, given
the data X, and is calculated as the ratio of the model likelihoods, B12 = f(X|M1)/ f(X|M2). The model likelihoods
f(X|Mi) are difficult to calculate analytically but can be
estimated by using the output from an MCMC [27,62].

Here we explore the congruence test described by
Nylander et al. [27], which utilizes Bayes factors. The test
is not a significance test but merely compares the strength
of evidence between two models of character evolution.
In the first model, data partitions are allowed to have their
own unique set of substitution parameters, but we assume
the data as having evolved on the same topology, but with
partition-specific branch lengths. Strictly speaking, we are
restricting the data partitions to have the same posterior
distribution for topologies, but (potentially) different distributions in all other parameters. In the second model we

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/23

relax the assumption of a single distribution of topologies
for all data partitions. That is, if the data partitions (genes)
truly evolved on different phylogenies, they are allowed to
do so in the model. The comparison or 'test' is to see if the
second model provides compelling evidence as to be
accepted as superior. Here we use the log of the Bayes factor and a value of >10 for 2 logB12 have been suggested as
strong evidence against the alternative model, M2 [61].
To accomplish the incongruence test we utilized the unlink
command in MrBayes, which allows the user to let parameters as well as topologies to be unlinked between partitions. We calculated Bayes factors and compared the
effects on the model likelihood when linking or unlinking
topologies between all the gene partitions. We were primarily interested in the potential incongruence between
the mitochondrial cytochrome b partition and the two
nuclear partitions myoglobin and G3PDH, but all combinations of the three genes in our data set were examined.
For comparison, we also tested whether the different gene
partitions were in significant conflict with each other by
using the parsimony based incongruence-length differences test (ILD) [64], implemented in PAUP* [50]. The
results are based on 10,000 replicates, with ten iterations
(random additions of taxa) per replicate.
