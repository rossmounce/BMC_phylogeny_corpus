Abstract
Background: Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are one focus of the national research initiatives on
Oceans and Human Health (OHH) at NIEHS, NOAA and NSF. All of the OHH Centers, from the
east coast to Hawaii, include one or more research projects devoted to studying HAB problems
and their relationship to human health. The research shares common goals for understanding,
monitoring and predicting HAB events to protect and improve human health: understanding the
basic biology of the organisms; identifying how chemistry, hydrography and genetic diversity
influence blooms; developing analytical methods and sensors for cells and toxins; understanding
health effects of toxin exposure; and developing conceptual, empirical and numerical models of
bloom dynamics.
Results: In the past several years, there has been significant progress toward all of the common
goals. Several studies have elucidated the effects of environmental conditions and genetic

heterogeneity on bloom dynamics. New methods have been developed or implemented for the
detection of HAB cells and toxins, including genetic assays for Pseudo-nitzschia and Microcystis, and
a biosensor for domoic acid. There have been advances in predictive models of blooms, most
notably for the toxic dinoflagellates Alexandrium and Karenia. Other work is focused on the future,
studying the ways in which climate change may affect HAB incidence, and assessing the threat from
emerging HABs and toxins, such as the cyanobacterial neurotoxin β-N-methylamino-L-alanine.
Conclusion: Along the way, many challenges have been encountered that are common to the
OHH Centers and also echo those of the wider HAB community. Long-term field data and basic
biological information are needed to develop accurate models. Sensor development is hindered by
the lack of simple and rapid assays for algal cells and especially toxins. It is also critical to adequately
understand the human health effects of HAB toxins. Currently, we understand best the effects of
acute toxicity, but almost nothing is known about the effects of chronic, subacute toxin exposure.
The OHH initiatives have brought scientists together to work collectively on HAB issues, within
and across regions. The successes that have been achieved highlight the value of collaboration and
cooperation across disciplines, if we are to continue to advance our understanding of HABs and
their relationship to human health.

Background
For residents of marine and freshwater coastal regions,
perhaps one of the most visible manifestations of the
interdependence of human and ocean health are the episodic harmful algal blooms (HABs) that affect almost
every part of the U.S. coastline. HABs are natural phenomena caused by the proliferation of algae, resulting in damage to the environment and/or risk to the health of
humans and aquatic life. Many HAB species produce toxins that are accumulated and passed up the food chain,
causing illness or death in humans and other organisms
that consume them. Nontoxic organisms can also cause
blooms. These so-called "noxious" or "nuisance" bloom
species grow to high biomass and cause oxygen depletion,
reduction in biodiversity, physical damage, and shading
of the benthos. The frequency and severity of HAB events
appears to be increasing globally [1-3], which likely
reflects both a real increase in HAB events as well as
improved monitoring and awareness. Although HABs are
often primarily considered natural phenomena, the magnitude and occurrence of some species may be exacerbated
by
anthropogenic
input
of
nutrients
(eutrophication) and perhaps other forms of coastal pollution [3,4]. The influence of climatic and environmental
variation on HAB incidence is also an active area of
research, as changing global conditions may affect future
HAB risk (see below, and [5] in this supplement)
HABs are a key focal area of the national research initiatives on Oceans and Human Health (OHH) at NSF/
NIEHS and NOAA. All of the OHH Centers, spread from
the east coast to Hawaii, include one or more research
projects devoted to understanding HAB problems. Collectively, the Centers are engaged in intense study of a variety
of major recurrent toxic HAB species in the U.S.: Alexandrium tamarense, Gambierdiscus spp., Karenia brevis, Micro-

cystis spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. (Figure 1). Emerging
HAB problems, such as the cyanobacteria responsible for
β-N-methylamino-L-alanine poisoning, are also under
investigation.
Alexandrium tamarense
Blooms of neurotoxic dinoflagellates of the genus Alexandrium can cause outbreaks of paralytic shellfish poisoning
(PSP), the most widespread of the HAB-related shellfish
poisoning syndromes. PSP is caused by saxitoxins, a family of toxins that bind to sodium channels in nerve and
muscle cells, and results from ingestion of shellfish that
accumulate toxins from feeding on Alexandrium cells. The
economic, public health, and ecosystem impacts of PSP
outbreaks take a variety of forms and include human
intoxications and death from contaminated shellfish or
fish, loss of natural and cultured seafood resources,
impairment of tourism and recreational activities, alterations of marine trophic structure, and death of marine
mammals, fish, and seabirds. The economic impact of
Alexandrium blooms is substantial; for example, economists estimated that a large bloom in the northeastern
U.S. in 2005 cost the seafood industry alone $2.7 million
per week in lost revenues, with some estimates suggesting
double that amount [6]. Toxic Alexandrium species are
found worldwide in temperate coastal and estuarine
waters. Thousands of miles of U.S. coastline are affected,
with recurrent blooms affecting both the northeastern and
western coasts of the U.S.
Gambierdiscus toxicus
The toxic dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus spp. is the primary
source of ciguatoxin, the poison that causes ciguatera fish
poisoning (CFP). Humans acquire ciguatoxin (CTX) by
eating reef fish that have accumulated the toxin via the
marine food web. Gambierdiscus dinoflagellates are found

in association with various macroalgae in coral reef ecosystems. These dinoflagellates are consumed by herbivorous fish, beginning a process of bioaccumulation,
biomagnification, and biomodification in the reef food
web, as the herbivores are consumed by carnivores, and,
ultimately, by humans. Gambierdiscus is found in tropical
and subtropical coral reef regions worldwide; in the U.S.
it has been reported from Hawaii [7,8], the Florida Keys
(e.g. [9]), and the Gulf of Mexico [10]. CFP produces gastrointestinal, neurological, and cardiovascular symptoms,
and intoxication does not result in immunity, but rather
confers hypersensitivity. Though seldom fatal, CFP symptomatology may include >80 physiological disorders, and
prevention is the primary clinical and technical objective.
The frequency of CFP worldwide is estimated at 500,000
cases per year [11-13], and records from various Pacific
locales suggest that over 80–96% of human fish poisonings are due to CFP. A serious public health threat in the

U.S., CFP is estimated to account for >95% of medical
costs associated with harmful algal blooms. These toxins
may also affect fish directly, altering behavior and possibly compromising immune responses, thereby impacting
ecosystem health.
Karenia brevis
The toxic dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis, can be found in
low concentrations throughout much of the Gulf of Mexico, but episodically forms large blooms [14-16]. These
have been observed in the coastal waters of Mexico, Texas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and western Florida, but
they are largest and most frequent along the southwest
coast of Florida [15,16]. The blooms can sometimes
extend from north Florida to the Florida Keys, and can last
from weeks to more than a year. An analysis of the 50-year
data record suggests that K. brevis has become more abundant during this time [17], though this contention is not

Environmental Health 2008, 7(Suppl 2):S2

universally held among scientists. The highest concentrations of K. brevis occur within five kilometers of the shoreline [17], where they have the greatest impact on humans.
K. brevis produces a suite of neurotoxins called brevetoxins, which can cause neurotoxic shellfish poisoning
(NSP), in which nerve cell paralysis results in gastroenteritis, muscle cramps, seizures, paralysis, and other neurological symptoms after the consumption of toxic shellfish
[18,19]. Due to vigilant monitoring programs by government agencies, intoxication of humans is now rare. A
more widespread effect of K. brevis blooms is the release of
brevetoxins from the cells, which then form a toxic aerosol that can cause respiratory problems in humans, especially those with asthma [20-22]. This frequently has a
major impact on residents and tourists along the southwest coast of Florida, where blooms occur almost annually, resulting in significant financial losses. Brevetoxins
can also kill large numbers of fish, which has caused
declines in both commercial and recreational fish stocks.
Threatened species such as sea turtles, dolphins, and manatees are also killed by K. brevis blooms [23,24]. The brevetoxin-related deaths of these animals are particularly
significant because of their small population sizes and
low reproductive rates.
Microcystis
Cyanobacterial HABs have been observed in the Great
Lakes for decades. In the 1960s and 1970s massive
blooms of diverse cyanobacteria (Anabaena, Aphanizomenon and Microcystis) occurred during summer when the
water column was thermally stratified [25,26], but have
since declined due to phosphorus reduction strategies.
However, since the mid-1990s there has been a resurgence
of cyanobacterial HABs in the Great Lakes and the community is now dominated by Microcystis. Large persistent
Microcystis blooms in the relatively warm and shallow
regions of the Great Lakes (including western Lake Erie,
Saginaw Bay in Lake Huron, Bay of Quinte in Lake
Ontario) have been present during most summers. Microcystis produces the hepatotoxin microcystin that is responsible for mortality in livestock, wildlife and birds. Human
health effects of exposure to microcystins in drinking
water include gastrointestinal illness for acute exposure
and increased liver disease and damage and possible
tumor promotion for chronic exposure [27]. Recreational
exposure to microcystins may result in skin irritation and
allergic reactions [28]. This is particularly significant
because the Great Lakes provide drinking water to over 40
million U.S. and Canadian citizens and have over 500
beaches that are used for recreational activities. Microcystis
cells tend to accumulate at the water surface, particularly
in calm conditions, resulting in dense surface scums in
embayments, against structures such as docks and piers,
and in nearshore regions where humans are most likely to

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/7/S2/S2

come in contact with the water, further increasing the
potential impacts on human health.
Pseudo-nitzschia
The diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia contains multiple species known to produce a potent neurotoxin called domoic
acid (DA) [29]. The toxin is bioaccumulated in marine
shellfish and finfish and subsequently transferred to
higher trophic levels [30-33]. Consumption of contaminated seafood by humans results in a neurotoxic illness
known as amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) [34,35]. The
first documented case of ASP occurred in 1987 in Prince
Edward Island, Canada, when 3 people died and several
others suffered permanent health effects after consuming
DA-contaminated mussels [35,36]. Sublethal effects of
DA exposure include: vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, disorientation, seizures, and permanent short-term memory
loss [36,37]. Pseudo-nitzschia is a cosmopolitan genus
found in both coastal and open ocean regions from tropical to arctic latitudes. In the U.S., toxic Pseudo-nitzschia
species have been documented along the west coast [38],
in the Chesapeake Bay [39], the Gulf of Mexico [40], and
the northeastern U.S. [41]. Blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia are
prevalent along the west coast of the United States where
they have been responsible for closures of shellfish harvests, sometimes for over a year, resulting in the loss of
millions of dollars in revenue for the coastal economy.
During toxic events, recreational, commercial and tribal
subsistence harvest of clams, valued at over $20 million
annually [42], is prohibited and public health is threatened.

Discussion
A unified approach to the problem of HABs
While the organisms and environments may be diverse,
all of the seven Centers employ a similar strategy for the
study of HABs. This approach shares a set of five common
goals for understanding, monitoring and predicting HAB
events in order to protect and improve human health.
These goals are: 1) understanding the basic biology of the
organisms; 2) understanding how chemistry, hydrography and genetic diversity influence blooms; 3) developing
analytical methods and sensors for cells and toxins; 4)
understanding health effects of toxin exposure; and 5)
developing and validating conceptual, empirical and
numerical models of bloom dynamics for predictive purposes. For all of the Centers, the ultimate goal is to
develop better methods and technologies for monitoring
and predicting HAB events. The ability to detect cells and
toxins at high spatial and temporal resolution and to
project that information into the future using predictive
models will provide the greatest protection to public
health. However, we also need to have a better understanding of the organisms and their ecology if we are to
build effective sensors and predictive models.

HAB research at the Oceans and Human Health Centers is
part of a large and active research community that
includes scientists from around the world. Center activities build upon and complement years of research on all
aspects of HAB problems. A strength of the OHH Centers
is that they bring together scientists from diverse fields,
greatly facilitating collaboration and cooperation across
scientific disciplines. The ability to tap the combined
expertise within and between Centers has made it easy to
approach HAB problems "from all angles," and the successes that have been achieved highlight the value of this
interdisciplinary approach to the study of HABs.
Basic biology of HAB organisms
In comparison to many other organisms, especially model
systems, relatively little is known about the basic biology
of HAB species. One of the biggest gaps is the lack of information about the biochemical pathways for toxin synthesis, especially in eukaryotic HAB species. Several genera of
cyanobacteria produce different toxins, and researchers
have completely described the multi-gene systems for the
synthesis of microcystins [43] and cylindrospermopsin
[44]. A saxitoxin gene cluster has been recently identified
in cyanobacteria [45] although the genes for saxitoxin
synthesis in dinoflagellates remain elusive. Similarly,
none of the genes involved in the synthesis of ciguatoxins,
brevetoxins, or domoic acid have been conclusively identified. A set of polyketide synthase genes that may direct
the synthesis of the cytotoxic amphidinolides has been
identified from the dinoflagellate Amphidinium [46];
knowledge of their sequence and function may assist in
the elucidation of genes involved in the synthesis of other
dinoflagellate polyketide toxins, such as brevetoxins or
ciguatoxins. The lack of information for eukaryotic HABs
may also soon change as a result of efforts by the broader
HAB research community to develop genomic resources
for HAB species. Scientists have generated expressed
sequence tag (EST) collections for the toxic dinoflagellates
Karenia brevis and Alexandrium tamarense [47,48] and used
the data to construct microarrays for gene expression profiling [49]. HABs have also finally entered the genomics
age with the recent funding of genome sequences for the
harmful pelagophyte Aureococcus anophagefferens and the
toxic diatom Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries. These sequencing
efforts should greatly advance overall knowledge of the
biology of HAB species.

While we lack in-depth genetic information for many
HAB species, we do have relatively good information on
their physiology, due to laboratory studies that have
investigated the response of cultured isolates to environmental conditions. However, we are just beginning to
investigate how these organisms function as part of the
complex communities that exist in natural waters. This
can include multiple species or strains of the same organ-

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/7/S2/S2

ism, or multi-species assemblages. For example, researchers are beginning to unravel the complex relationship
between toxic diatoms and their associated bacteria. Previous studies have shown that not all Pseudo-nitzschia species produce domoic acid [50-52], and cells that can
produce DA have a wide variability in toxin production
depending on such factors as environmental conditions
[53], nutrient stress [54,55], growth phase, and bacteria
coexisting with Pseudo-nitzschia [56,57]. Other researchers
have also demonstrated higher toxin production by
Pseudo-nitzschia in the presence of bacteria [56], with
greater toxin enhancement upon introduction of bacteria
isolated from a different geographic location than the
Pseudo-nitzschia cell [57]. Specific relationships have been
described between bacteria and other HAB-forming species [58-60]. Literature related to Pseudo-nitzschia has
focused on several strains of one species, Pseudo-nitzschia
multiseries.
Center researchers have built upon this work by examining bacterial assemblages associated with 18 Pseudonitzschia strains, representing 6 species, using a DNA fingerprinting technique called ARISA (Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis). ARISA amplifies the
intergenic spacer region located between 16S and 23S
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes in bacteria [61]. This
method has been used to relate bacterial fingerprints to
distinct ecosystem features [62], seasonal changes [63],
and phytoplankton species [64]. Using this method,
Center scientists found that Pseudo-nitzschia species host
significantly different bacterial assemblages. Furthermore,
bacterial assemblages associated with species capable of
high toxin production differed significantly from those
associated with species with low toxin production.
Studies of HAB organisms can be complicated by unusual
aspects of their biology and life cycles. For example, while
the toxic diatom Pseudo-nitzschia has recently been
selected for whole genome sequencing, genetic characterization of toxic dinoflagellates such as Karenia and Alexandrium has been limited to the sequencing of EST libraries.
This is primarily because the genome sizes of dinoflagellates are often prohibitively large for full genome sequencing. Estimates of dinoflagellate DNA content range from 3
to 250 pg·cell-1 [65], corresponding to approximately
3000–215,000 Mb (in comparison, the haploid human
genome is 3180 Mb). The dinoflagellate Symbiodinium has
a relatively small genome, ca. 2 pg, and investigatory
genome sequencing of this organism is currently underwayhttp:genome.wustl.edgenome.cgi?GENOME=Symbdi
ni%20sp.&SEC TION=research. Although this genus is
not toxic, the genome sequences from this dinoflagellate,
along with the development of new, ultra-high throughput sequencing technologies, are encouraging advances

Page 5 of 17

Environmental Health 2008, 7(Suppl 2):S2

that make the prospect of a full genome sequence for a
toxic dinoflagellate more likely.
For some HAB species, even controlled laboratory experiments can be a challenge because organisms are often difficult to culture. Many HAB species have complex life
cycles that include a sexual phase. For example, clonal
Pseudo-nitzschia cultures eventually die out if they are not
mated with larger cells of the same species. The toxic dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus has also proved difficult to maintain in culture; it grows slowly and does not attain high
biomass [66-68]. Established cultures tend to become less
toxic over time, a phenomenon that frustrates efforts at
characterizing the effects of environmental conditions on
toxicity. While total toxicity can be monitored using cellbased assays, determination of the different, structurally
related toxins requires more costly instrumentation, such
as chromatography systems and mass spectrometers. This
is the case for many of the other HAB toxins as well.
Detecting and quantifying HAB toxins are capabilities that
individual laboratories often cannot afford to develop
and maintain. This highlights a potential role for Center
core facilities in future HAB studies – the development of
a centralized source of expertise and technology for toxin
detection that would be useful to many.
Effects of nutrients, hydrography, and genetic diversity on
blooms
A necessary step in understanding the formation of HABs
is taking what we have learned from laboratory studies of
clonal culture isolates and translating that into field populations. In the laboratory, conditions can be controlled
so that only one factor varies at a time, whereas natural
blooms involve a complex interplay of changing chemical, physical and biological conditions, which vary both
in time and space. A common goal of the HAB research at
the OHH Centers is to understand the effects of nutrient
availability, hydrography, and genetic diversity on HAB
formation and development.

In the Great Lakes, the toxicity of Microcystis blooms is
determined both by environmental factors and the genetic
composition of the bloom. Nutrients, light, trace metals
and temperature are some of the factors that change
bloom toxicity either through direct stimulation of toxin
production or through coupling to cell growth and division [69-71]. Statistical modeling conducted as part of a
Center collaborative effort has shown that multiple environmental conditions (including annual/episodic events,
meteorological patterns, seasonal/intermittent riverine
inflows, and annual phosphorus loading) interact with
taxon-specific physiological traits to holistically influence
late-summer cyanobacterial abundance throughout shallow sections of the Great Lakes [72]. Though clearly environmental factors impact bloom toxicity, microcystin cell

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/7/S2/S2

quota can vary by as much as 3–4 orders of magnitude
between strains, suggesting a strong role for bloom composition in predicting toxicity [73,74]. In western Lake
Erie, Center researchers identified multiple genetically distinct populations of Microcystis based on sequence analysis of one of the microcystin synthetase genes (mcyB),
further supporting the role of community composition in
bloom toxicity.
In Pseudo-nitzschia, genetic diversity is reflected in interand intraspecific variability in toxin production, which
has complicated the implementation of early warning systems for blooms, largely because Pseudo-nitzschia are notoriously difficult to identify. Center research has led to the
development of a DNA-based Pseudo-nitzschia-specific
ARISA for species identification, which is used in tandem
with environmental clone libraries for strain identification and to assess the diversity of Pseudo-nitzschia communities [75]. Both techniques utilize genus-specific PCR
primers with environmental DNA samples to amplify
ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) sequences,
which vary in sequence length and content among species, and in sequence content only among genotypes. The
goal is to link changes or differences in species or sub-species diversity with specific environmental factors. This will
lead to a better understanding of the environmental conditions that favor the growth, predominance, and toxin
production of particular species and/or strains. Most of
this Center research is occurring in the coastal and estuarine waters of the Pacific Northwest where Pseudo-nitzschia
blooms are common. However, global distributions of
Pseudo-nitzschia types are also being investigated to better
evaluate the extent of genetic diversity in this genus. Thus
far, the Center project has identified more than 14 putative species of Pseudo-nitzschia in Pacific Northwest waters
using ARISA, compared to ~7 described by past studies
[76]. Some of the identified species and strains are globally distributed, while others appear to be specific to a
particular region. For example, the same genotype (i.e. 0%
divergence) of P. delicatissima was detected in Portugal,
Denmark, and throughout the Pacific Northwest [75].
Preliminary results suggest that it shows lower environmental constraints than other species, since it is commonly detected in hydrographically distinct Puget Sound
basins and across multiple seasons. In contrast, 24 genotypes of P. pungens detected in the Pacific Northwest
exhibit distinct distribution patterns and high divergence
levels in comparison to other species, suggestive of distinct populations or cryptic species that might co-exist in
Pacific Northwest waters.
The presence of multiple populations, strains or species
during HAB events is turning out to be the rule, rather
than the exception, for many HAB organisms. In addition
to the cyanobacteria and diatoms described above, high

Environmental Health 2008, 7(Suppl 2):S2

genetic diversity has also been observed in blooms of the
toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium fundyense in the northeastern U.S. Center scientists are using microsatellite
markers to analyze the diversity and population structure
of Alexandrium blooms over consecutive bloom years.
Results show that blooms are not genetically "static" –
that populations present at the end of a bloom can be distinct from those at the start of a bloom. However, results
also show that the starting bloom populations in consecutive years are not significantly different from one
another. This apparent paradox challenges our assumptions about the homogeneity of blooms, and about the
sources of cells for bloom initiation and propagation. It
also highlights the potential of genetic markers; they not
only provide information about population structure, but
can also help us to understand the sources of toxic cells
and to identify mixing of populations.
Center research has also been devoted to understanding
the effects of changing conditions (e.g., nutrients, temperature, irradiance) on cell growth and toxicity. For example, Center scientists have established dozens of isolates
from A. fundyense bloom populations in the northeast and
measured their growth rates and toxicity under varying
conditions of light and temperature. The heterogeneity
observed is remarkable – growth rates vary up to threefold, and toxicity varies as much as four-fold among isolates grown under the same conditions. These differences
may lead to the selection of specific genotypes in natural
waters, with a resulting variability in population abundance and toxicity from year to year. The effects of this
growth and toxin variability on regional blooms are currently being explored using the Gulf of Maine Alexandrium
numerical model, also as a Center activity [77].
One of the biggest challenges to understanding toxic
blooms is that chemical, biological, and physical conditions can all be changing simultaneously, and not necessarily in concert with one another. It is therefore extremely
difficult to determine the proximate cause of changes in a
natural bloom. Did the bloom die off because it ran out
of nutrients? Because of a parasite? Because the winds
changed and forced the bloom offshore? Some combination of these factors? This issue could be addressed
through the development of methods for the in situ analysis of cell physiology, and the collection of long-term
field data sets. If we could determine the status of cells in
the field, we could use that knowledge to predict the
behavior of blooms. For example, fluorescent, precipitable substrates of alkaline phosphatase have been used to
demonstrate phosphorus limitation of cells in the ocean
[78]. To date, no such indicators have been successfully
used to characterize the growth requirements of HAB species, although their potential continues to spur researchers
to seek out molecular markers.

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/7/S2/S2

Long-term data sets of field measurements of bloom (and
non-bloom) events have the potential to greatly increase
our understanding of bloom dynamics. Data from many
years or bloom events enable us to assess the factors that
change from year to year, or bloom-to-bloom, and correlate those with changes in bloom events. Do blooms only
occur in years with above average rainfall? Warm summers? Northeast winds? Unfortunately, long-term synoptic data sets are very difficult to obtain, because a single
grant proposal often only allows for a few years of monitoring, and it is challenging to keep a field program
funded for the period of time necessary to accumulate a
substantial time series. The five-year term of the Centers
has provided a great boost to field efforts in many regions.
Maintaining these programs will be a challenge, but they
provide critical information not just for our conceptual
understanding of bloom dynamics, but also for the development and testing of mechanistic models of blooms.
Development of detection methods and sensors for HAB
cells and toxins
Methods for detection of marine algal cells and toxins are
one of the primary goals of HAB research at the OHH
Centers, but the work presents many challenges. Methods
must be sensitive enough for detection well below regulatory limits, while being fast enough to allow for detection
of toxicity before human exposure. Current methods for
detecting many toxins are based on the exposure of laboratory animals to the suspect toxin, a procedure that is
slow and costly, or liquid chromatographic purification of
the toxin that lacks sensitivity and requires time-consuming sample preparation. Current research is directed
towards developing automated portable algal cell detectors capable of distinguishing toxin-producing strains
from innocuous strains and toxin sensors capable of realtime detection with high sensitivity during field operation.

In general, the methods that have been developed for the
detection and enumeration of HAB cells are more numerous and diverse than those for HAB toxins. HAB researchers have developed a variety of molecular technologies for
cell detection including fluorescent in-situ hybridization
(e.g. [79]), sandwich hybridization (e.g. [80]), and quantitative PCR (e.g. [81]). In the case of toxin detection,
method development is often complicated by the presence of multiple toxins and multiple toxin congeners. In
some cases the toxins differ chemically in only minor
ways (though this often does not translate into "minor"
activity differences). In other cases toxin-producing organisms synthesize suites of toxic compounds with quite varied molecular structure and functionality. For reliable
toxin detection, known toxins require simpler and more
accurate methods, while unknown toxins require full
molecular structural characterization. To be widely

adopted for monitoring and risk management, screening
methods must be accurate, easy to use/interpret, readily
available, reasonably priced, able to test large numbers of
samples quickly, and capable of identifying toxins specifically. Answers to better detection and monitoring will
likely be found in processes emphasizing molecular structure rather than bioactivity.
Collaboration has also led to the development of a HAB
sensor prototype for the detection of domoic acid, based
on a portable surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor.
Center scientists raised antibodies raised against domoic
acid, which were used to develop competition-based
assays for a portable 6-channel SPR system designed by
another Center [82]. The current SPR system is capable of
detecting up to 24 small molecule, protein, and microbial

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/7/S2/S2

sitivity of both assays is improved, ARISA and SPR biosensor detection could be combined to enable field
characterization of HABs (Figure 2).
Molecular methods are also being used to detect and
quantify Microcystis cells and their toxigenicity. Other
researchers have previously identified the genetic pathway
for microcystin synthesis, which includes a cluster of 10
genes encoding polyketide synthases and peptide synthetases [43]. Of the 10 genes, PCR-based detection and
phylogenetic comparisons are most commonly made
based on mcyA, mcyB, mcyD or mcyE genes [83-85]. In
addition, quantitative real-time PCR methods have been
established for the enumeration of toxic Microcystis in
environmental samples [86,87]. Such methods are being
applied by Center scientists in the Great Lakes to determine the distribution of toxic Microcystis in the western
basin of Lake Erie and Saginaw Bay, the degree of genetic
diversity of Microcystis populations and the proportion of
toxic vs. nontoxic Microcystis strains. In other systems
dominated by Microcystis, strains with and without the
genetic potential for microcystin production generally are
present [88,89]. Results of Center research suggest that the
underlying genetic structure of the population may have a
profound effect on the potential toxicity for a given
bloom.
Most of the techniques and sensors developed for HAB
detection still require a human operator, in a laboratory,
which increases the time between sample collection and
measurement. Along with cell and toxin data, we need to
understand how blooms are driven by and/or respond to
chemical and physical properties of the water column,
and how toxins produced by some of these organisms
propagate through the food web. For these reasons, the
study and management of HABs would benefit tremendously from the development of remote, in situ, real-time,
observing systems capable of detecting specific HAB species and associated toxins.

Identification of different Pseudo-nitzschia species in Puget
Sound and Washington coastal waters can be achieved

Direct optical measurements can provide a tractable
means of detecting high biomass blooms. HAB scientists
are studying toxic red tides that occur in the Gulf of Mexico using an optical sensor fitted onto an inexpensive,
unmanned underwater glider that can collect continuous
profiles of the water column and its characteristics [90].
However, many HAB species can exert harmful effects at
concentrations far below those that lead to visually discolored water and may represent only a small fraction of
the total number of cells present in the environment.
Since it is not always possible to discriminate harmful
from benign organisms based on optical properties alone,
other techniques that provide species or even "strain"
level resolution are required. Application of molecular
probes is one means of accomplishing that goal [91].

When the problem organisms are rare, however, relatively
large samples are required (hundreds of mL to liters) and
multi-step chemical processing of that material is needed
to reveal target species or toxins of interest given the techniques available currently. Therefore, successful application of molecular probe sensing technology for remote
detection of a variety of HAB species on autonomous platforms may require instrumentation that both accommodates large sample volumes and provides the means for
processing that material prior to delivery to the detector
itself. While such systems are emerging [91-93], it is not
likely in the short term that they will provide data at rates
comparable to those of physico-chemical sensors, such as
the combination conductivity, temperature and depth
profilers (CTD) that are routinely deployed from research
vessels. Consequently, near term application of HAB biosensors fielded on autonomous platforms will likely be
tightly integrated with other sensors that trigger an analysis in adaptive fashion based on environmental gradients
readily detectable at high frequency and previously identified as favorable for HAB formation.
To date, only a few of the emerging observing systems in
marine and freshwater environments include HAB-specific instrumentation, since much of it is still under development. The automated real-time bloom or toxin
detection systems emerging now are therefore being operated in parallel with more traditional cell and toxin detection methods to better characterize the robustness of these
systems as well as the reliability and accuracy of the data.
Despite the challenges that lie ahead, the development of
sensors based on molecular, biological and optical techniques is progressing rapidly and holds great promise for
application on autonomous platforms for future HAB
management and mitigation.
Understanding the human health effects of toxin exposure
Understanding the health effects of toxin exposure on
humans and other animals is necessary if we are to
improve prevention efforts and reduce the health risks
from HAB events. In the U.S., there are few reported cases
of illness from the consumption of shellfish contaminated with known HAB toxins. This is because states have
effective monitoring programs that test for toxins in shellfish and, in some cases, the presence of harmful species in
coastal waters. However, shellfish consumption is not the
only route through which HABs impact human health.
The toxins of K. brevis can become aerosolized, which
results in respiratory irritation and associated illness.
Microcystins can be ingested through drinking water [94].
We understand the acute toxicity effects associated with
the various poisoning syndromes much better than the
effects of chronic, subacute toxin exposure. Chronic exposure can result from the regular consumption of seafood
with levels of toxin in their tissues below the regulatory

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/7/S2/S2

limit, and therefore considered safe to eat. Chronic exposure is a serious concern, particularly for sub-populations
that rely heavily on seafoods, or susceptible populations
such as children and the elderly. This is a critical area that
deserves increased attention and would benefit from a
truly interdisciplinary approach that considers the ecological, public health and epidemiological aspects of toxin
exposure.
Human and animal studies are being conducted to understand the health effects of brevetoxin exposure. Studies of
brevetoxin exposure are complicated by the fact that brevetoxin can enter human beings by two major pathways:
ingestion of seafood contaminated with the toxins and
breathing the aerosol that contains the toxins. Brevetoxin
is a lipid-soluble cyclic polyether that is not easily metabolized by organisms and can be passed up the food chain
[95]. Because of their lipid-soluble nature, brevetoxins
tend to accumulate less in muscle tissue and more in the
viscera of organisms [24]. The brevetoxins have no taste or
odor, and thus cannot be easily detected by potential
human consumers. They are also heat and acid stable,
thus cannot be easily destroyed in food preparation [18].
The consumption of bivalve shellfish appears to be the
main way in which humans can receive a large dose of brevetoxins in their bodies. However, recent work by HAB
scientists has raised concerns that brevetoxins can accumulate in the tissues of finfish, which may represent
another potential source of brevetoxin exposure for
humans and marine mammals [96]. The risk of brevetoxins to human health is further compounded by an
increase in Karenia blooms. Center research has shown
that average Karenia cell concentrations along the west
coast of Florida have been increasing over the last 50
years, along with increases in the geographic extent and
duration of the blooms [17].
Because K. brevis is a relatively delicate unarmored dinoflagellate, the cells can be disrupted by surface wave
action, leading to the release of brevetoxin-laden aerosols
[97,98]. The degree of human exposure to brevetoxin by
this route depends upon a number of factors such as cell
concentrations, wind speed and direction, and particle
size of the aerosols [99]. Inhalation of aerosolized brevetoxins can lead to eye and respiratory irritation, bronchoconstriction, and a decrease in pulmonary function
[18,99]. People affected begin coughing and sneezing,
and develop runny noses, watery eyes, irritation in the
throat, and have trouble breathing. Humans with asthma
are particularly sensitive. A collaborative research project
supported by NIEHS and other agencies, and involving
Center scientists, has examined the human health consequences of exposure to brevetoxin aerosols. Emergency
room admissions for pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma, and
other respiratory problems were found to increase sub-

Environmental Health 2008, 7(Suppl 2):S2

stantially during Karenia bloom events [100]. While no
deaths as a result of brevetoxin alone have ever been
recorded [24], the possibility that brevetoxins or their
effects could work in synergy with other preexisting health
problems to increase death probabilities cannot be discounted. Brevetoxins could also have a number of other
less easily detectable and/or longer-term effects, but this
potential has not been studied yet.
Center researchers are also examining the effects of subacute domoic acid (DA) exposure on gene expression in
the vertebrate central nervous system using the zebrafish
model system. Zebrafish are currently recognized as one
of the most important vertebrate model organisms for
gene function and toxicogenomics studies [101]. In addition, the zebrafish genome has been sequenced and largescale genetic screens have been performed and extensively
analyzed [102]. Zebrafish mutations phenocopy many
human disorders and results from these studies provide
candidate genes and pathways for evaluation of disease in
higher organisms. In terms of human health, there are
growing concerns regarding toxicity due to chronic DA
exposure particularly in Washington coastal Tribal communities that subsistence fish on razor clams, which are
known to retain DA for up to a year [32]. The Quinault
phrase ta'a Wshi xa'iits'os means "clam hungry," and illustrates the strong cultural reliance on razor clams for food.
Currently, clam dig openings are guided by toxin regulatory limits that are set by the Washington State Department of Health (WDOH). However, the concern is that
people are likely exposed to low levels of DA (≤ 20 ppm
the regulatory limit) on a regular basis (J. Schumacker,
Quinault tribe, pers. comm.), with particular concern
regarding exposures of infants and children [34]. A joint
pilot project between two Centers used a zebrafish microarray to identify a subset of genes that were differentially
expressed in the vertebrate central nervous system in
response to low level (asymptomatic) DA exposure. Connecting these genes identified in the zebrafish vertebrate
model with the physiological processes they regulate will
facilitate a more detailed understanding of the human
health impacts of low-level chronic exposure to DA.
The primary route of human exposure to microcystins in
the Great Lakes is thought to be through drinking water
and recreation. In particular, microcystin concentrations
in the source waters of Saginaw Bay (Lake Huron), western Lake Erie, Bay of Quinte and Hamilton Harbor (Lake
Ontario) have exceeded the recommended threshold of 1
μg/L of microcystin established for finished drinking
water. Microcystin concentrations in surface scums have
been measured as high as 400 μg/L [103], well exceeding
the 20 μg/L recommendation for recreational exposure
[103,104]. Another potential exposure route is through
fish consumption due to the recreational and commercial

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/7/S2/S2

importance of fishing in both regions of the Great Lakes
and in inland lakes that have significant cyanobacterial
HAB concentrations. Center scientists, in collaboration
with university partners, have measured microcystin accumulation in the tissues of edible size fish caught in lakes
with high cellular microcystin levels. Concentrations of
microcystin in the liver would be hazardous to human
health, but quantities were significantly lower in muscle
tissue [105]. While most populations do not consume fish
livers, this route of exposure needs to continue to be evaluated along with increased incidence of cyanobacterial
blooms in the recreational and drinking waters, all of
which could pose a significant concern for public health
in the Great Lakes.
It is sometimes easy to lose sight of the risks that HABs
pose to human health, because effective monitoring
efforts prevent almost all shellfish poisoning events. The
value of HAB research and monitoring is enormous in
terms of risk avoidance and mitigation, but it makes epidemiological study of these phenomena extremely difficult. Almost nothing is known about the effects of toxins
below these regulatory limits, yet regular consumption of
drinking water and seafood may result in chronic lowlevel toxin exposure. This risk can be particularly pronounced in certain sub-populations, for instance the elderly, or those whose diets rely heavily on seafoods for
cultural or subsistence reasons. The risks of low-level
toxin exposure during development, either in utero or during early childhood, are also unknown. Our understanding of the health risks of HAB toxins, and therefore our
ability to mitigate those risks, is incomplete until we know
the human health effects associated with both chronic
and acute toxin exposures.
Development of models and prediction capabilities
As mentioned above, one of the common goals of all of
the OHH Centers is the development of predictive models
that will help us to understand and avoid human health
risks from HABs. Dyble et al. 2008 [106] (this supplement
issue) provide an in-depth description of the experience of
the OHH Centers in model development; here we provide
a short overview of some of the successes in the modeling
and prediction of HAB events specifically.

Center research generated two of three years of environmental monitoring data on in situ temperature, salinity,
DIN, phosphate, and light that were incorporated into a
series of regression equations to simulate seasonal patterns in these variables for the leeward and windward
sides of the island of Hawaii. Cultured isolates were used
to determine the physiological response curves of Hawaiian Gambierdiscus to different temperatures, nutrient concentrations, light, and salinities. These response curves
were coupled with the seasonal patterns of the environ-

Environmental Health 2008, 7(Suppl 2):S2

mental variables in a Gambierdiscus population dynamics
model. The model results were then compared to actual
Gambierdiscus abundance data collected over the three
year period at leeward and windward sites on the island of
Hawaii to assess its accuracy and realism; preliminary
results are shown in Figure 3. In future modeling efforts,
the environmental parameters will be subjected to randomized fluctuations (within measured variability) to
study the various conditions that can cause a "bloom" of
Gambierdiscus and a possible, subsequent outbreak of
CFP.
Center researchers have also previously developed a coupled three-dimensional physical-biological model to
understand, predict, and analyze Alexandrium blooms in
the northeastern U.S.. Alexandrium has a complex life
cycle, which includes a resting "cyst" stage that forms at
the end of a bloom, and enables the cells to remain dormant until the next spring bloom season begins. The
model includes germination of these cysts to begin the
bloom, along with the speeds and directions of ocean currents, water temperature, salinity, winds, solar radiation,
tides, river runoff, and nutrients to generate a simulation
of an Alexandrium bloom. Prior simulations have demonstrated that model predictions are quite similar to the
actual bloom conditions observed in the field [77]. The
model results also indicate that the behavior of the cells,
the prevailing wind direction, and the input of fresh water
from coastal rivers all play an important role in whether a
bloom forms in a given year. Building upon their prior
work, Center scientists used the model to perform "hindcast" simulations of a massive Alexandrium bloom in 2005
[6] to try to determine which factors were responsible for
that unprecedented bloom. Three hypotheses were proposed: high resting cyst abundance, heavy rainfall and
runoff, and major storm events ("northeasters") that
pushed surface waters and cells to the shore and along the
coast. Model conditions were systematically varied to produce the hindcast model simulations of the bloom; results
indicate that high abundance of cysts in western GOM
was the main cause of the 2005 bloom, although wind
forcing was an important regulator. This suggests that
monitoring of the regional abundance of cysts may hold
the key to interannual forecasts of A. fundyense bloom
severity. The combination of predictive modeling and the
ability to perform hindcast simulations has tremendous
power to help us understand the factors that are responsible for Alexandrium blooms, and represents a major
advancement in HAB management
In Florida, Center research has contributed to a notification system that uses a combination of remote sensing
and ground-based monitoring to provide an early warning of K. brevis blooms. The west coast of Florida is commonly affected by K. brevis blooms, but they are not

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/7/S2/S2

currently predictable. Florida government agencies routinely monitor the abundance of K. brevis and the toxin
levels in shellfish in the coastal waters along the west
coast. Because of the cost of widespread monitoring,
remote sensing is used to target the water sampling. High
concentrations of chlorophyll detected by remote sensing
are used as potential indicators of K. brevis blooms [107].
Targeted water sampling is then used to confirm the satellite data. Once elevated concentrations of K. brevis have
been confirmed, toxin levels in shellfish are then monitored. Only the west coast is routinely monitored, since
other areas are affected so infrequently that monitoring
would not be cost effective. Remote sensing however, can
track large blooms and monitor any long distance transport of them. For areas not usually hit by K. brevis blooms,
remote sensing can therefore alert agencies of potential
problems so that monitoring can be initiated. Thus, monitoring coupled with remote sensing allows for a more
effective use of resources.
Scientists use the satellite data, along with cell counts,
meteorological data and oceanographic buoys to monitor
bloom movement, for the purpose of predicting future
developments. This information is distributed to researchers and other interested partners weekly. Information
about K. brevis and its effects on humans is routinely presented in newspapers and radio stations along the west
coast. Many tourist hotels along the beach also voluntarily
provide such information, as tourists are much less aware
of Florida's red tide than the local residents. Daily updates
on the location of blooms are often posted on beaches, as
well as websites, newspapers and radio stations, as K.
brevis can have a major impact on people's lives and how
they may want to change their plans for the day. A toll-free
hotline (888-232-8635) is available for people to report
any effects they have felt or to ask questions about Florida's red tide. In the future, poison information center and
other human health surveillance data as well as real-time
monitoring by lifeguards on beaches will be incorporated
into the system [108].
The situations in Florida and the northeastern U.S. are not
typical – for most HAB organisms, no conceptual or
mechanistic models are currently available. One reason
for this is the lack of long-term observations and detailed
laboratory studies to provide the data to parameterize and
constrain the models. Development of the Alexandrium
model benefited enormously from years of accumulated
experimental data on the physiology of the dinoflagellate.
This provided information on the behavior of the cysts
and cells in response to light, nutrients, and temperature.
Numerous research cruises collected data on cell numbers
and oceanographic conditions, during bloom and nonbloom years, and on the distribution and abundance of
resting cysts in the sediments. All of this information was

then coupled with an existing physical model of the
region. For many organisms, these basic building blocks
for a model are just not available. This underscores the
need for long-term observational field programs, and for
basic physiological data on the organisms themselves.
Our ability to understand and eventually predict HABs
depends critically on this type of science.
Looking forward
The establishment of the OHH Centers has greatly facilitated cooperation between researchers from different scientific disciplines and geographic regions. While Center
research addresses the current challenges that HABs
present, Center scientists are also cognizant of new, potentially unknown, problems in the future. Two areas that are
likely to become more prominent in the near future are
emerging HAB species and events, and the effects of global

environmental change on HABs (see Moore et al., [5] in
this supplement issue).
Emerging HABs
A previously unknown HAB phenomenon has been identified by Center researchers working with Dr. Paul Cox
(Institute for Ethno Medicine) and colleagues. In April
2005, they reported that the neurotoxic glutamate agonist,
β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), is produced by all
known groups of cyanobacteria, including cyanobacterial
symbionts and free-living freshwater, marine and terrestrial cyanobacteria [109]; Figure 4). Previous investigations of this neurotoxin in the cyanobacterial symbionts
of cycad palm trees in Guam led researchers to hypothesize that BMAA is the putative cause of high-incidence
amylotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism-dementia
complex (ALS/PDC) among the Chamorro people. In

Guam, human exposure to high quantities of BMAA
results from unique components of the traditional
Chamorro diet including cycad tortillas, flying foxes, and
possibly other feral animals. The ubiquity of cyanobacteria in diverse terrestrial and aquatic environments suggests
that ingestion of BMAA may occur through even less esoteric routes, including direct consumption of cyanobacteria or cyanobacterial hosts, bioaccumulation in additional
food chains, or exposure to cyanobacteria-contaminated
water supplies. Collaboration between two Centers is continuing this line of research by screening a variety of
marine and freshwater ecosystems for evidence of BMAA
biomagnification and potential human risk.
In addition to previously unknown HAB organisms or
toxins, an additional threat comes from the expansion or
emergence of known HABs in areas where they have not
previously occurred. Historically, Gambierdiscus has been
reported in the United States only from Hawaii, the Florida Keys, and Puerto Rico, but it has recently been
reported in the Gulf of Mexico [10]. In the Gulf, oil platforms serve as colonization sites for G. toxicus in areas that
are otherwise inhospitable due to unsuitable bottom conditions. The Gulf of Mexico has over 4000 of these producing sites, which provide a nexus for fisherman and
potentially toxic fish. Multiple CFP cases have been
reported from fish caught near oil platforms [110]. The
steel archipelago of the northern and western Gulf of Mexico is a great experiment in providing refuges for tropical
benthic species. An ongoing collaboration between investigators in Texas and Center scientists is comparing the
CTX produced in these two locations to determine if the
ecological source of the toxins is related to differences in
molecular weight and/or structure. This information is
relevant to the advancement of diagnostic capabilities for
ciguatera fish poisoning worldwide.
HABs and global change
The consequences of projected global change for HABs are
generally poorly understood. They are likely to vary for
tropical and temperate ecosystems because of differing
regional expressions of global change in environmental

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/7/S2/S2

forcing parameters of HAB dynamics. In the Pacific Northwest, HAB species proliferate primarily during warmer
seasons [111], and therefore threaten human health
mostly during spring, summer and early fall. Projected
increases in water temperature will increase the annual
window of favorable growth conditions and may encourage earlier and longer lasting blooms (see Moore et al., [5]
in this supplement). Other possible effects of global
change will cross regional boundaries, such as range
expansions of tropical and temperate HAB species into
temperate and northern ecosystems, respectively. For
example, CFP caused by the toxic dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus occurs primarily between the 35°N and 35°S
latitudes. It is believed that any latitudinal extension of
warmer water to the north where human populations are
greater will similarly increase the incidence of CFP [112].
Such impacts will be most severe in areas that are currently the warmest. Incorporating these kinds of climate
change impacts into predictive models and risk assessments of HABs will be paramount to understanding this
link between oceans and human health in the future. This
can be achieved through a combined approach capitalizing on the wide range of expertise in the OHH centers.

Conclusion
HAB research at each of the OHH Centers shares a common set of goals that encompasses many of the primary
needs and issues for understanding the links between
HABs and human health. For all of the Centers, the ultimate goal is the development of better methods and technologies for monitoring and predicting HAB events, so
that we can mitigate or eliminate their adverse human
health effects. There has been notable progress towards
this goal for several HAB organisms, for example the
development of toxin sensors for domoic acid and the
forecasting and hindcasting of Alexandrium blooms. However, considerable challenges remain for all of the HAB
problems being studied. Long-term field data and basic
knowledge of the effects of nutrient availability, hydrography, and genetic diversity on HAB formation and development are necessary if we are to develop accurate
conceptual, empirical and numerical models. Sensor
development calls for simple and rapid assays for algal
cells and especially toxins. It is also critical for us to adequately understand the human health effects of HAB toxins; we best understand the acute toxicity effects, but
almost nothing is known about the effects of chronic, subacute toxin exposure. At the same time that we are working towards filling the current gaps in our knowledge of
HABs, we must also be aware of future challenges that we
may face. Changing climate conditions may affect the
range, frequency and severity of HAB events. New HABs
are likely to emerge, as in the case of the cyanobacterial
neurotoxin BMAA. The OHH initiatives have brought scientists together to work collectively on a number of HAB

problems, both within and across regions. The successes
that have been achieved highlight the value of collaboration and cooperation across disciplines to the study of
HABs.
