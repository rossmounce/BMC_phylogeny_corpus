Recent years have seen great technological advances that
have helped usher in a new generation of approaches to
understand and share knowledge about the planet in
which we live. A number of major initiatives that aim to
catalyze necessary technological and biological advances
synergistically have emerged globally. Of these enabling
initiatives, the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL; http://www.
eol.org) and the Barcode of Life (BOL; http://barcoding.
si.edu) are projects that have collectively help lay a
framework within which we will see the next generation
of taxonomic innovation and discovery. The successes of
both EOL and BOL have the potential to impact multiple
facets of society - from the discovery of new species, to
the development of conservation strategies for endangered life, to insights into infectious disease hosts and
vectors, to the discovery of life-saving medicinal plants,
to the piquing of general interest about life on Earth and
our role in the complex web of life. Both the EOL and
BOL initiatives are possible thanks to a number of
significant advancements in knowledge discovery, integration, and management techniques. Collectively
termed ‘biodiversity informatics,’ this new suite of
methodologies and tools extends contemporary computer science and informatics principles within the context
of biodiversity data.
This supplement, made possible through funding from
both EOL and BOL, brings forth some of the pioneering
work from leading biodiversity informatics researchers.
While nascent as a discipline, biodiversity informatics
has proven to not only adopt, but also help significantly
challenge and advance the most recent technological

advances and computational approaches for managing
complex data. In contrast to bioinformatics, which in
primarily focused on managing relevant molecular
biology data, biodiversity informatics requires frameworks and approaches that can accommodate the full
range of biological information - from molecules to
morphological features, to populations, to habitats collectively developing the ultimate computational Web
of knowledge about life on Earth.
This supplement starts with a piece from Chavan and
Ingwersen that goes through some of the fundamental
principles for disseminating biodiversity information,
discussing both the hindrances and opportunities [1].
Hill et al. then describe how one might leverage existing
technological infrastructure for enabling georeferencing of
biodiversity data [2]. Demonstrating how biodiversity
informatics can often benefit from the latest advances in
searching strategies, Hajibabaei and Singer describe an
approach for making use of Google to identify relevant
information with respect to DNA sequences [3]. Next, Page
discusses the nuances of biological global unique identifiers, which may be necessary to link relevant biodiversity
data across various spheres of knowledge [4]. In consideration of the necessary continual curation required for
disparate biodiversity knowledge, Smith et al. describe a
Drupal-based technology called “Scratchpads” for managing and sharing biodiversity knowledge [5].
In parallel to the emerging infrastructure for managing
and disseminating biodiversity information, DNA Barcode analysis methods represent a crucial entry point

into the realm of biodiversity knowledge. The last four
articles thus focus on some recent advances in DNA
Barcoding analytic approaches. The first of these articles,
from Bertolazzi et al., presents a machine learning
approach for classifying species according to DNA
Barcode derived information [6]. Chu et al. then describe
a ‘composition vector’ approach for making use of large
datasets of DNA Barcodes for classification [7]. In light
of molecular sequence alignment as an often ratelimiting step in many classification approaches, Kuksa
and Pavlovic present an alignment-free approach for
DNA Barcode data [8]. In light of the range of
approaches associated with DNA Barcode based classification, Austerlitz et al. present an overview of common
phylogenetic and statistical methods most commonly
considered [9].

A unifying theme in the articles of this supplement is the
diversity of issues that remain to be resolved going
forward. It is my hope that this issue helps continue and
inspire new dialogue across the full range of disciplines
associated with this burgeoning field.

Acknowledgements
I am extremely grateful to the generosity of both the Encyclopedia of Life
(EOL) and Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL) leadership for their
sponsorship to make this issue possible. Dr. James L Edwards (EOL), Dr.
David Schindel (CBOL) and their staff helped ensure that the entire
process from conception to fruition happened without any issues. Key
members of the BioMed Central team (Jo Baker, Nadine McKoy, and
Isobel Peters) were also instrumental throughout the process. Finally, my
sincerest thanks goes to the contributors and the numerous reviewers
who helped make difficult choices in selecting the manuscripts for
publication in this supplement.
