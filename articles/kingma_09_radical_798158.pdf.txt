Abstract
Background: Mating outside the pair-bond is surprisingly common in socially monogamous birds,
but rates of extra-pair paternity (EPP) vary widely between species. Although differences in lifehistory and contemporary ecological factors may explain some interspecific variation, evolutionary
forces driving extra-pair (EP) mating remain largely obscure. Also, since there is a large
phylogenetic component to the frequency of EPP, evolutionary inertia may contribute substantially
to observed EP mating patterns. However, the relative importance of plasticity and phylogenetic
constraints on the incidence of EP mating remains largely unknown.
Results: We here demonstrate very low levels of EPP (4.4% of offspring) in the purple-crowned
fairy-wren Malurus coronatus, a member of the genus with the highest known levels of EPP in birds.
In addition, we show absence of the suite of distinctive behavioral and morphological adaptations
associated with EP mating that characterize other fairy-wrens. Phylogenetic parsimony implies that
these characteristics were lost in one speciation event. Nonetheless, many life-history and breeding
parameters that are hypothesized to drive interspecific variation in EPP are not different in the
purple-crowned fairy-wren compared to its promiscuous congeners.
Conclusion: Such radical loss of an extreme EP mating system with all associated adaptations from
a lineage of biologically very similar species indicates that evolutionary inertia does not necessarily
constrain interspecific variation in EPP. Moreover, if apparently minor interspecific differences
regularly cause large differences in EPP, this may be one reason why the evolution of EP mating is
still poorly understood.

Background
Social monogamy is the most common mating system in
birds [1]. However, application of molecular tools
revealed that most socially monogamous species engage
in extra-pair (EP) mating (> 75% of studied species [2,3]).
Rates of extra-pair paternity (EPP) are highly variable
between species, ranging from none to almost all broods
containing EP offspring [2-5]. The evolution of EP mating

remains puzzling, largely because the generally proposed
potential costs (reduced male care) and benefits
(increased genetic quality of offspring) remain controversial [2,6].
When explaining variation among closely related species
and between populations of the same species, EP mating
rates are hypothesized to be a result of evolutionarily plasPage 1 of 11

tic responses to contemporary ecological factors. For
example, lower breeding synchrony could reduce alternative mating opportunities and depleted genetic variation
could diminish the genetic benefits of pursuing EP mating
[2]. However, phylogenetic constraints on EP mating are
important, with over 50% of the interspecific variation
being explained at the level of families or orders [2,5],
suggesting that contemporary ecological factors may
(sometimes) play a secondary role [5]. Indeed, results of
comparative studies may vary depending on whether phylogeny is taken into account (e.g., [7] vs. [8]). Nonetheless, the relative importance of phylogenetic constraints
on one hand and plasticity on the other in determining
interspecific variation in EPP rates remains largely
unknown.
Here we examine the evolutionary flexibility of EPP rates
by studying a member of a genus of birds that display an
unusual mating system with extensive behavioral and
morphological adaptations specialized for EP mating.
Australian fairy-wrens (genus: Malurus) are considered the
least faithful socially monogamous birds since all three
members of the genus for which paternity has been analyzed show exceptionally high rates of EPP (see Table 1
and [9], with up to 95% of nests containing at least one EP
offspring [10]. EP mating appears to be under female control, involving targeted pre-dawn forays to the territory of
a preferred male, as shown in superb fairy-wrens (M.
cyaneus) [11,12]. Male fairy-wrens invest heavily in mating competition as is evident from behavior as well as
morphology. Before breeding, males molt into colorful

breeding plumage [9] and develop unusually large testes
and cloacal protuberances (the site of sperm storage),
important for sperm competition [13]. Moreover, males
engage in frequent courtship of EP females starting
months prior to breeding and continuing all through the
breeding season. EP courtship involves males intruding
onto nearby territories followed by ritualized display of
their bright breeding plumage during which a flower petal
may be presented to the visited female. Territorial intrusions by extra-group males and petal displays have been
described for eight of the nine Australian Malurus species
[9], and therefore high EPP has generally been expected
for all fairy-wrens (e.g., [9,13,14]).
In this study, we examine rate of EPP in purple-crowned
fairy-wrens (Malurus coronatus). Purple-crowned fairywrens are riparian specialists rarely seen more than 20 m
from the watercourse [9,15]. Year-round, groups vigorously defend a stretch of the stream that serves as their
exclusive, all-purpose territory [16]. The cooperativelybreeding mating system of M. coronatus appears similar to
other Malurus [9], but predictions of high rates of EPP for
the species (e.g., [9,13,14]) may be premature. Although
the species is less studied than most other fairy-wrens,
extra-territorial display by males has never been observed
and M. coronatus pairs coordinate song to form 'duets'
[9,17], a feature generally related to low rates of EPP [18].
Here, we aim to establish the relative importance of phylogenetic constraints and evolutionary plasticity in
response to ecological factors and life history, as determinants of extra-pair mating in M. coronatus. We quantify

EPP rate and investigate male behavioral and morphological adaptations known to be important for EP advertisement and mating competition in other Malurus species.
Additionally, we compare life-history and ecology of purple-crowned fairy-wrens with the other three species with
known levels of EPP (superb, splendid M. splendens, and
red-backed M. melanocephalus fairy-wrens). We consider
attributes that have been hypothesized to affect costs and
benefits of, and constraints on, EP mating (reviewed in [25]); in particular: social mating system [19] including
number of helpers [10,14]; clutch size and nesting success
[5]; divorce and mortality rates [5,20,21]; incidence of
incestuous pairings [22,23]; importance of paternal care
[5,24-27]; and breeding synchrony and density [7,28-30].

Results
Extra-pair paternity
In sharp contrast to the Malurus species studied so far (see
Table 1), paternity analysis of 227 offspring from 104
nests in M. coronatus revealed very low levels of EPP: 4.4%
of offspring (95% confidence interval CI: 1.7 – 7.1%) in
5.8% of broods (CI: 1.2 – 10.3%) resulted from extra-pair
matings. These 10 EP offspring in 6 broods included 4 offspring sired by a subordinate male in 2 groups, thus corresponding to 6 extra-group offspring (2.6%, CI: 0.5 –
4.7%) in 4 broods (3.8%; CI: 0.1 – 7.6%). Paternity analysis was based on 6 microsatellite loci (2 to 17 alleles per
locus) with a maternal exclusion probability of 94.2%
and a paternal exclusion probability of 99.1% (Table 2).
Microsatellite heterozygosity was high (range: 0.467–
0.917; see Table 2).
Adaptations to extra-pair mating: morphology and
behavior
In M. coronatus, we found none of the male morphological adaptations for EP mating that are characteristic of
other members of the genus (Fig. 1). M. coronatus has
much smaller reproductive organs during breeding (Fig.
1a, b): their testes are on average 10% of the size of testes
of other Malurus (range: 6 – 18%; Fig. 1b) and cloacal protuberances (CP; the site of sperm storage) in breeding
males (57.4 ± 3.6 mm3, n = 40) are on average about half
of the CP size of other fairy-wrens (28 – 87%; Fig. 1a). A

subset of males captured when their female was fertile (in
the week before egg-laying) had an average CP of 66.3 ±
4.2 mm3 (n = 25), a peak still much smaller than average
breeding CP size in other Malurus (see Fig. 1a). Interestingly, M. lamberti and M. pulcherrimus appear to have
rather small cloacal protuberances (see Fig. 1a, and [31]),
although all other typical EP mating adaptations have
been recorded (Fig. 1). It would therefore be interesting to
explore EPP rates in these two species.
In addition, to the primary reproductive traits important
for sperm competition, traits involved in behavioral sexual competition were also reduced in M. coronatus. The
amount of body plumage which males molt seasonally
into colored breeding plumage (21%) is only 21–34% of
other Malurus (62–100%; Fig. 1c). Likewise, the striking
male behavioral adaptations specific to EP mating in
other fairy-wrens are absent: in over 325 hours of observations on fertile females, we never observed male M. coronatus engaging in extra-territorial intrusions, courtship
displays or presentation of flower petals (Fig 1d). In contrast, previous research showed that fertile M. cyaneus
females were visited by up to 7 intruding males per 20min observation period, with more than 25% of females
visited by at least one intruder [32].
Comparing Malurus life-history and ecology
We compared M. coronatus with three congeners that have
high EPP, concerning aspects of general breeding biology,
life-history and ecology that have been proposed or
shown to affect relative costs and benefits of and constraints on extra-pair mating (Table 1). This comparison
showed that social mating system, number of helpers,
clutch size, breeding success, rates of divorce, adult mortality, and incestuous pairing, rates of paternal care, and
peak breeding synchrony are all very similar (Table 1).

All fairy-wrens are cooperative breeders, with subordinate
birds assisting the dominant (breeding) pair with offspring provisioning (Table 1). Groups average 3.3 birds
(range 2–11; n = 39) in M. coronatus, including male and
female subordinate birds, with sex of subordinates being
skewed towards males (around two third of subordinates

were males). This results in approximately the same
number of males present per territory compared to M.
cyaneus (both 1.9 male per territory), and slightly more
than in M. splendens (1.3–1.6) and M. melanocephalus (1.4;

contrast to other fairy-wrens which have territories
arranged in a mosaic (Table 1), territories in M. coronatus
are linearly arranged along the stream and have therefore
fewer neighbours.

Discussion
Clutch size was 3.0 ± 0.1 eggs per clutch on average
(range: 1 – 4, n = 157 nests) intermediate to other fairywrens (range 2.8–3.2 eggs; Table 1). Like other fairywrens, M. coronatus can raise more than one successful
brood annually (Table 1; [33,34]).
Pair bonds in all Malurus species are long-lasting for two
reasons. First, divorce rates in Malurus are relatively low
(Table 1). In our population, three of 25 surviving pairs
from 1 April 2006 and none of 24 pairs from 1 April 2007
divorced (average annual divorce rate: 6.0%). This is similar to other species: in M. cyaneus 4.2% of 93 pairs surviving to one year later had divorced [35], and in M.
splendens, 10 pairs divorced in 348 pair-years (2.9%) [36].
Second, mortality rates in Malurus are generally low [9].
In our M. coronatus population on average 19% of dominant males and females did not survive until one year later
(Hall et al., in prep) resulting in comparable to slightly
higher survival rates than in other Malurus species.

EPP is a defining feature of the mating system of Australian fairy-wrens (genus Malurus), associated with striking
behavioral and morphological adaptations. Although
high infidelity has been assumed to occur in all fairywrens (e.g., [9,13,14]), we here show a marked exception:
M. coronatus' mating system rather approaches genetic
monogamy, with EPP rates being even lower than the
average 18.7% of broods observed in socially monogamous birds [2]. Although levels of EPP in Malurus fluctuate between species as well as within species (e.g., in M.
splendens: between populations 55 – 83% [14,22]);
between years 33–63% [14] of nests), all studied species
show high levels of promiscuity, with even the lowest values of EPP being far higher than that of M. coronatus
(Table 1).

We observed nine incestuous pairings of 55 pairings with
known pedigree (16.4%; five mother-son, two fatherdaughter, and two full-sib pairings). This is similar to the
potential for inbreeding in M. cyaneus and M. splendens
(Table 1), where incestuous pairings occurred in 75 out of
500 pairings (15.0%; [37]) and 29 out of 136 pairings
(21.3%; [38]) respectively.

Contrary to all other fairy-wrens, M. coronatus males show
reduced sexual signaling (reduced breeding plumage and
the absence of courtship display), in line with lower levels
of EPP [41]. Moreover, while other Malurus have some of
the largest testes and cloacal protuberances known for
birds [13], M. coronatus has relatively small reproductive
organs, suggestive of reduced sperm-competition [42,43].
In fact, their testes are well below the average 1% of body
mass for songbirds [42] and cloacal protuberances of
breeding males are also smaller than expected for their
body size [43].

Nestling feeding rates are similar in M. coronatus compared to M. cyaneus, the only congener with data available
for comparison (Table 1). In M. coronatus, males in unassisted pairs have a provisioning rate of 6.2 feeds/hour (n
= 25 males at 34 nests), which is intermediate between
two measures from one population of M. cyaneus (5.8 and
6.4 feeds/hour [39,40].

A phylogeny including 9 of 12 species in the Malurus
genus [44] suggests that M. coronatus is derived from an
ancestor with high EPP and the adaptations to EP mating
that characterize its sister species (Fig. 1). Thus, phylogenetic parsimony suggests that EP mating and the entire
suite of adaptations were lost within a single speciation
event (see also Box 1 in [45] for an example).

The average breeding synchrony index of M. coronatus
(based on 252 breeding attempts) was 36% lower than in
M. cyaneus (Table 1), the only congener available for this
comparison. This is because breeding in M. coronatus
could occur in any month. However, there were typically
peaks in spring (Aug – Sep) and in the wet-season (Dec –
Apr), so peak synchrony was almost identical in both species (28.2 and 29.8% respectively).

Comparing Malurus life-history and ecology
Hypotheses attempting to explain interspecific variation
in EPP usually consider differences in social mating system or contemporary ecology as important explanations
that can affect potential benefits, costs and constraints of
EP mating [2]. However, the radical loss of extreme levels
of EPP in M. coronatus is not associated with any marked
differences in relevant life-history parameters.

Breeding density is determined by territory size and
arrangement. Territory size in M. coronatus (average length
= 156.5 ± 14.3 m, range: 50–376, N = 39 territories) is
intermediate to other fairy-wrens (Table 1). However, in

Clutch size could affect EPP rates [5], but average clutch
size is very close to on average around 3 eggs in all species
(Table 1), including M. coronatus. Similarly, differences in
annual fecundity could affect rates of EPP [5], but all

Malurus species can annually raise more than one successful brood (Table 1).
Potential (genetic) benefits of EPP and EPP rates can be
dramatically affected by differences in mating system and
opportunity to express social mate choice ([46,47]; see
also [19]). However, all fairy-wrens are socially monogamous with restricted opportunities for social mate choice
since breeding vacancies arise rarely in these long-lived,
year-round territorial species with low divorce rates (see
[9] and Table 1). Low rates of divorce and mortality in M.
coronatus are associated with a low EPP rate, consistent
with the pattern found in comparative studies [5,20,21].
While divorce rates are consistently low in all Malurus species, mortality rates are slightly lower in M. coronatus than
in its sister species (Table 1). However, mortality rates are
in general very low in the (promiscuous) Malurus species
(see Figure Two in [5]), and, in fact, much lower than
would be predicted from their high EPP rates [5]. Thus, it
seems unlikely that a relatively slight decrease in adult
mortality was important for the near-disappearance of EP
mating in M. coronatus.
EP mating can act as a mechanism to reduce the costs of
incest and inbreeding [23]. Philopatry increases the risk of
incest and inbreeding in general, as it does in other fairywrens [22,23,33,37,48]. The frequency of incestuous pairings in purple-crowned fairy-wrens does not differ compared to the sister species (Table 1), including M. splendens
for which inbreeding avoidance has been proposed as one
of the benefits of EPP [22,23]. Therefore, in combination
with the fact that molecular genetic variability is rather
high (see Table 2), opportunities for genetic benefits of EP
mating seem as likely in M. coronatus as in other fairywrens.
Some life-history attributes can constrain females in EP
mating behavior. For example, the importance and extent
of male care can affect rates of EPP [5,26]. All fairy-wrens
are cooperative breeders with, on average 1–2 subordinates (Table 1) assisting the dominant (breeding) pair. In
M. cyaneus, helpers liberate females from constraints on
EP mating by compensating for the reduction in male care
associated with EP behaviors [10]. Likewise, in M. coronatus, parents can decrease their feeding rate of nestlings
when subordinates are present (unpubl. data). Increased
value of male care in M. coronatus compared to other
Malurus seems unlikely since nestling starvation is
uncommon (unpubl. data), and nestling feeding rates of
males without helpers are similar in M. coronatus compared to M. cyaneus (Table 1). In addition, male paternityguarding behavior might limit EPP [49]. However, mate
guarding is no more intense in M. coronatus than in M.
cyaneus (see [17] for a detailed discussion), and in M.
cyaneus male mate-guarding does not prevent EP mating
by females [11,32].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/15

Availability of suitable EP mating partners and hence EP
mating opportunities might be reduced by asynchronous
breeding [29] and low density [8]. Although M. coronatus
breeds more irregularly and has a longer breeding season
than other Malurus species, peak synchrony in M. coronatus is similar to peak synchrony in M. cyaneus (Table 1), its
sister species that has the highest rates of EPP reported in
birds [2]. Breeding density (territory size) at first appears
similar. However, spatial arrangement of territories is different in purple-crowned fairy-wrens (see below).
It is difficult to demonstrate causation for a single evolutionary event, but a possibility is that the riparian specialization of M. coronatus, resulting in a one-dimensional
arrangement of territories, may constrain access to an adequate sample of EP mates. Extra-pair offspring in M.
cyaneus are generally sired by males within one or two territories (maximally five [11]). Territory length in M. coronatus is intermediate between the other fairy-wrens and
the number of males per territory is similar (see Table 1).
Therefore, if female purple-crowned fairy-wrens traveled
similar distances in search of EP males, this linear arrangement implies that a female could choose from fewer
potential sires. For example, for average group size and
composition of M. coronatus and M. cyaneus (Table 1),
within a two-territory radius there would be 7.6 males in
4 linearly arranged territories in M. coronatus, compared to
34.2 males in 18 territories in a honeycomb arrangement
in M. cyaneus (see Figures in [12,15,34]). Male advertisement would be subject to analogous constraints since
male M. coronatus would have fewer females to display to
within a similar flight distance. However, inter-specific
evidence for breeding density effects remains poor
[2,5,8,50]. Moreover although extremely low breeding
density will necessarily limit EP mating (cf. [51] and [52]
for an example), it is not immediately obvious why a relatively reduced availability of EP mates should lead to virtual female fidelity and absence of male EP mating
adaptations in M. coronatus. However, this hypothesis
could be explored by examining whether differences in EP
mate availability (population density) explain some of
the variation in Malurus' rates of EPP between study years,
populations and species.

Conclusion
Although EP mating can have a strong phylogenetic component [2,5], our results show that remarkable differences
in EP mating system and associated adaptations can occur
among species with very similar life-histories. This pattern
suggests that phylogenetic constraints do not necessarily
limit rapid evolutionary modification of EPP rate, and
that EP mating and its adaptations can be evolutionary
much more labile than is commonly assumed [2,5]. If
inter-specific variation in EP-levels is commonly not
related to descent, social mating system, or obvious contemporary ecological factors, this could well be one reaPage 6 of 11

son why general explanations for the evolution of EPP
have remained elusive [2-4].

We can assume these individuals died, as surveys in adjacent areas revealed that (long-distance) dispersal by dominant birds is rare (Hall et al., unpubl. data).

Methods
Study species
We studied a color-banded population of M. coronatus resident along Annie Creek and the Adcock River in the Australian Wildlife Conservancy's Mornington Wildlife
Sanctuary (S17° 31' E126° 6') in Western Australia. Like
other fairy-wrens, M. coronatus are small (~10–12 g), sedentary, cooperatively breeding passerine birds. The dominant pair, the male and female that sing duets [9,16], form
exclusive long-term pair bonds, and breed together. Subordinate birds are usually progeny from previous broods,
and contribute to nestling feeding [9]. During regular
weekly censuses in August to November 2005 and April
2006 to April 2008, we noted which group members were
present and searched for nest-building females, identifying any intruders, and all interactions, including display
behavior. Nests were checked during incubation to determine clutch size. At time of banding, a small blood sample was collected by brachial veni-puncture from nestlings
(n = 164) and fledglings that were still dependent on their
parents (n = 48), and stored in Queens- or Longmire's
lysis buffer for paternity analyses (see below). In addition,
material from unhatched eggs (n = 8) and dead nestlings
(n = 7) was collected and stored in ethanol. We collected
paternity data throughout the study period and area, covering the entire range of breeding synchrony and population density.

For the interspecific comparison with other Malurus (see
below), we collected the following breeding parameters
for M. coronatus, adhering to methods published for the
other species (see also below). We measured cloacal protuberance (CP) height (h), width (w) and length (l; measured as the distance from the anterior to the posterior
edge) to the nearest 0.1 mm of males captured in full
breeding plumage and calculated volume following
[43,53]. Average clutch size and annual number of broods
raised to fledging was calculated over the period April
2006–April 2008. We calculated average number of helpers using data from 39 territories in October 2007.
Divorce rates were calculated annually (from 1 April) as
the percentage of pairs that had switched mates twelve
months later, while both individuals survived (see also
below). Actual annual divorce rates may be higher than
estimated by this method because it does not correct for
pair bond duration and is based on pairing at certain arbitrarily chosen times (for detailed discussion see [37].
However, this commonly used metric provides a comparable index of divorce rates. Annual adult mortality rates
were calculated as the percentage of dominant birds that
were not present in our study populations one year later.

To calculate % incestuous pairings (parent-offspring and
full-sib pairings) we included all pairs for which we knew
the relatedness of the dominant male and female (n = 55).
Incestuous pairings do not necessarily result in inbreeding, because they frequently end in divorce (see Figure
Four in [33] for M. cyaneus). Nevertheless, the occurrence
of incestuous pairings does indicate potential for inbreeding which could be avoided by EP mating.
We collected nestling food provisioning rate of males
without helpers (n = 34 nests of 25 males) by observing
nests (with 1–4 nestlings between 4 and 10 days old) for
60 minutes and calculated feeding rates as number of provisioning trips per hour (Kingma et al., in prep).
Breeding synchrony was based on all broods over the
study period and calculated using the formula [54,55]:

SI p =

tp
∑i =1 f i,p
t p (F −1)

× 100

where SIp is the synchrony index for each female p (higher
% means more females breeding in the population), fi,p
the number of fertile females (excluding female p) in the
population on day i, and tp the number of fertile days for
female p, (defined as 6 days before the start of laying till
the day of the penultimate egg), and F the total number of
dominant females present during female p's fertile period.
For every day when at least one fertile female was present,
the average for every fertile female was calculated.
Purple-crowned fairy-wrens are riparian specialists with
territories linearly arranged along the stream (see illustration in [15]), so territory size was approximated as the
length of the stream occupied by the group determined by
behavioral observation, based on GPS coordinates, in
October 2007.
Comparing Malurus species
Malurus phylogeny
We used a phylogeny based on allozyme data [44] showing three main clades (see Fig. 1), with M. coronatus as sister species to M. splendens and M. cyaneus all in one clade,
confirmed by recent DNA analysis (J. Gardner & J. Trueman, pers. comm.). We included only the nine Australian
Malurus species in this study, because there is very little
information available about the three Papua New Guinean Malurus species (see [9]).

Extra-pair paternity
Published EPP data are available for M. cyaneus, M. splendens, and M. melanocephalus (see Table 1). For M. splendens,
we present rates of EPP for two different populations
[14,22], for M. melanocephalus we present two estimates
from the same population [56,57], and for M. cyaneus we
report the range of rates of EPP from one population collected over 15 years [10,11,37,58-60]. Since extra-group
(rather than extra-pair) paternity was usually reported in
M. cyaneus, we calculated rates of EPP as the percentage of
offspring sired by a male outside the group, and added
4.9% within-group offspring sired by subordinate males,
as reported in [60]. Since the percentage of broods in
which subordinate males sired offspring has not been
reported, the value presented is % broods with extragroup young, and may hence be a slight underestimation
of the % broods with EP young. The percentage of offspring sired by within-group subordinates was not
reported for M. melanocephalus, but like in other fairywrens, few offspring are sired by within-group subordinates (M.S. Webster and J. Karubian pers. comm.).
Reproductive organs and breeding plumage
For the comparison of relative testis size in all Malurus
(including M. coronatus) we used the relevant specimen
data used by [61]. Their standardized protocol for comparative analysis included at least five breeding males for
each species, and used only individuals with enlarged testes for tropical species with variable breeding seasons (for
details see [42,61]). We compiled data on CP size from
original sources [53,57,62-64]. To make data on M. coronatus comparable with data on other species, we omitted
inclusion of data on males that were not in breeding condition, as could be indicated by non-breeding plumage
(e.g., in subsets in [57,62]). Similarly, we excluded a study
in which CP length was measured to the cloacal vent
instead of to the anterior edge [31], leading to smaller CP
sizes.

Males in all fairy-wren species are seasonally dichromatic,
alternating dull non-breeding plumage with brightcolored breeding plumage for several months of the year.
Breeding plumage cover (% of the body with seasonally
dimorphic plumage) of males of each species was estimated based on illustrations in [9] and [65]. Using The
Gimp 2.2 http://www.gimp.org, we manually selected the
area covered by males' seasonal dimorphic plumage on
the drawings and calculated the number of pixels (using a
'histogram'). A similar procedure was used to calculate
number of pixels of the total bird and the percentage
breeding plumage was calculated by: (number of pixels of
seasonally dimorphic plumage/number of pixels total
bird) * 100. Tail-feathers were not included. The average
of three measures was used to determine mean percentage
breeding plumage. The percentage presented in Fig. 1d,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/15

was obtained by averaging the two mean values based on
both sources [9,65]. Repeatability for three measures of
the remaining seven species was high [66] for the 3
repeated estimates within each source ([9]: repeatability =
99.5, F = 617.9, P < .001; [65]: repeatability = 99.9, F =
2555.2, P < .001) as well as for the 2 averages between
sources (repeatability = 92.3, F = 25.0, P < .001); since
breeding plumage covers 100% of the body in two species
(M. melanocephalus and M. leucopterus), they were not
included in the repeatability calculations.
Breeding biology
Data about general breeding biology, life-history and
ecology of all Malurus species for which EPP data are available (Table 1) was, if possible, acquired from the same
studies reporting EPP [10,11,14,22,37,56-60] and from a
comprehensive review [9]. The following data were not
available from these sources and were obtained from
other studies, where possible from the same population in
which EPP was studied: group- [67] and territory-size in
M. melanocephalus and M. splendens [68,69], % inbreeding
in M. cyaneus [37], number of annually raised broods
[33,70] and annual divorce rates in M. cyaneus and M.
splendens [35,36]. Divorce rates in M. melanocephalus are
low, but not yet quantified (M.S. Webster, J. Karubian,
pers. comm.). Comparable data on nestling feeding rate
was only available for dominant M. cyaneus males without
helpers [39,40]. We calculated breeding synchrony in M.
cyaneus from original data on 87 females from the 1996
and 1997 breeding season (see [71]), following the same
procedure as for M. coronatus (see above). Average territory length (diameter) in other fairy-wrens was calculated
from area (in ha.) assuming a circular shape, to compare
with territory size in M. coronatus.
Paternity analyses in M. coronatus
DNA Extraction and Genotyping
Total genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples of
dominant and subordinate birds, offspring, and tissue
samples of eggs using standard salt-extraction described in
[72]. The samples were genotyped by Ecogenics GmbH
(Zurich, Switzerland) using a set of six microsatellite loci,
which were previously used for paternity analyses in other
fairy-wrens (Mcy μ1, Mcy μ3, Mcy μ4, Mcy μ8, developed
for M. cyaneus [73], and Msp4, Msp6, developed for M.
splendens [14]; see references for genbank numbers). Four
microsatellite loci were included in a PCR multiplex (Mcy
μ1, Mcy μ3, Mcy μ4, Msp6 with fluorescently labeled
reverse primers). The other two loci (Mcy μ8 and Msp4)
were used in single PCR reactions. PCR amplifications
were optimized for a 10 μl reaction volume containing 2
μl of DNA, 5 μl master mix (Qiagen, Cat. No 206143 for
multiplex and Cat. No 203445 for single PCR; containing
Hotstar polymerase, PCR buffer, and dNTPs), 1.5 μl double distilled water, and 0.3 μM of forward and reverse

primers each. The following thermo treatment was used
on a TC-412 Programmable Thermal Controller (Techne):
35 cycles with 94°C for 30 seconds, 50°C for 90 seconds,
and 72°C for 60 seconds. Before the first cycle, a prolonged denaturation step (95°C for 15 min) was included
to activate the Hotstar enzyme, and the last cycle was followed by a 30 min extension at 60°C.
Genotyping was performed on an ABI PRISM 3100
Genetic Analyzer. The amplified PCR products (1.2 μl)
were mixed with 10 μl formamide containing GENESCAN-500 (LIZ) Size Standard (Applied Biosystems), and
the genotype was determined on an ABI PRISM® 3100
Genetic Analyzer using GeneScan Analysis® Software 3.7
and Genotyper® 3.7 Software (Applied Biosystems).
All 346 individuals included in the paternity analysis had
four (n = 3), five (n = 25) or all six (n = 318) loci typed.
Determination of parentage
In total, we genotyped 227 offspring from 104 broods. We
used CERVUS v 3.0 software [74,75] to analyze paternity
data. The expected (He) and observed (Ho) heterozygosity were calculated for each locus. We calculated heterozygosity (and parental exclusion probability, see below)
using 137 dominant birds only, because genotypes of
nestlings and subordinate birds (in most cases offspring
from previous broods) were not independent.

None of the loci deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and we did not find evidence for null alleles.
Number of alleles ranged from 2 – 17 per locus and heterozygosity was high (Table 2). We calculated for each locus
the probability of maternal and paternal exclusion, i.e.,
the probability of exclusion of a randomly chosen male or
female as parent of the offspring, based on allele frequencies of dominant birds. In total across all 6 loci, we had 50
alleles and the probability of wrongly assigning a randomly chosen male as the sire was less than 1% (Table 2).
For paternity analyses, we assumed the social mother to
be the genetic mother of the offspring. This assumption
was justified since social mother and offspring had no
mismatches except for one mismatch at a single locus,
probably due to a scoring error (as suggested by homozygosity at the maternal locus). We assigned paternity using
the following conservatively chosen parameters in CERVUS: number of candidate fathers = 20, proportion of
males sampled = 0.9083 and frequency of typing error =
0.01. First, we tested whether the social (expected) father
was likely the genetic father, by examining whether there
were mismatches between the social father and offspring.
In total 217 of the 227 offspring matched all paternal alleles, and were assigned as true sire with confidence of >
95% in all cases. Of the ten remaining offspring (from 6

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/15

nests, 4 nests with one, and 2 nests with three offspring
not sired by the dominant male) with a paternal mismatch, one had a mismatch at one allele, six at 2 alleles,
two at 3 alleles and one at 4 alleles. In the single case of
one locus mismatch, it was likely that a subordinate male
from the same group was the sire of the offspring, rather
than a mutation or scoring error, because the subordinate
male had no mismatches. Three other EP-offspring could
be assigned to subordinate males from the same social
group as the dominant male (in total one subordinate
male sired one offspring, and one subordinate male sired
three); both subordinates were unrelated to the dominant
female. For the other six offspring not sired by their social
father, we identified five dominant and one subordinate
male from nearby groups as the genetic fathers (these
matched the offspring's paternal alleles at all loci). Thus,
in total, out of 227 offspring and 104 broods, we identified six extra-group offspring in four broods, and four
instances of paternity by a subordinate male within the
group in two broods, and thus ten EP offspring in six
broods.
Paternity assignment may be particularly complex in
cooperative species with high male philopatry, due to the
presence of close relatives, which share some alleles with
the expected father [72,73]. To verify our assignment of
the social male as the sire of the 217 offspring that had no
mismatches with their social father (thus excluding the 10
EP offspring), we used a likelihood-based approach. CERVUS calculates the likelihood for each male that he is the
sire (LOD score) based on the offspring and maternal genotypes; the male with the highest LOD score is the most
likely sire. We included all males (of at least 3 months
old) within five territories as potential fathers and computed LOD scores for each candidate father. Using this
method, we could confirm the social father to be the sire
in 201 cases (he had the highest LOD score of all candidate males). For the remaining 16 cases, one (n = 12) or
two (n = 4) other males showed higher LOD scores than
the social father (despite no mismatches between offspring and social father). We estimated the probability of
falsely accepting a social father as sire as Pep_offspring × Pep_mate
= 0.27% (if one male had higher LOD) and 0.54% (if two
males had higher LOD). Pep_offspring is the unequivocal
probability that a given offspring is not sired by its social
father = 4.7% (10 EP offspring and 201 within-pair offspring unambiguously assigned by allelic exclusion as
well as LOD scores of social sires, see above). Pep_mate is the
probability that the female would have mated EP with the
one or two males in the population that had higher LOD
than the social father by chance. We estimated Pep_mate by
considering as potential sires all males older than 3
months within five territories distance from the focal territory, including the subordinate males within the focal
territory, which were 17 alternative males in this subset.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/15

Thus, Pep_mate was on average 5.9% (for one male with
higher LOD) and 11.8% (for two males with higher LOD)
respectively.
