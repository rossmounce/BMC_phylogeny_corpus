Abstract
Background: Little is known about the genes that drive embryonic stem cell differentiation.
However, such knowledge is necessary if we are to exploit the therapeutic potential of stem cells.
To uncover the genetic determinants of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation, we
have generated and analyzed 11-point time-series of DNA microarray data for three biologically
equivalent but genetically distinct mESC lines (R1, J1, and V6.5) undergoing undirected
differentiation into embryoid bodies (EBs) over a period of two weeks.
Results: We identified the initial 12 hour period as reflecting the early stages of mESC
differentiation and studied probe sets showing consistent changes of gene expression in that
period. Gene function analysis indicated significant up-regulation of genes related to regulation of
transcription and mRNA splicing, and down-regulation of genes related to intracellular signaling.
Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the genes showing the largest expression changes were more
likely to have originated in metazoans. The probe sets with the most consistent gene changes in
the three cell lines represented 24 down-regulated and 12 up-regulated genes, all with closely
related human homologues. Whereas some of these genes are known to be involved in embryonic
developmental processes (e.g. Klf4, Otx2, Smn1, Socs3, Tagln, Tdgf1), our analysis points to others
(such as transcription factor Phf21a, extracellular matrix related Lama1 and Cyr61, or endoplasmic
reticulum related Sc4mol and Scd2) that have not been previously related to mESC function. The
majority of identified functions were related to transcriptional regulation, intracellular signaling, and
cytoskeleton. Genes involved in other cellular functions important in ESC differentiation such as
chromatin remodeling and transmembrane receptors were not observed in this set.
Conclusion: Our analysis profiles for the first time gene expression at a very early stage of mESC
differentiation, and identifies a functional and phylogenetic signature for the genes involved. The
data generated constitute a valuable resource for further studies. All DNA microarray data used in
this study are available in the StemBase database of stem cell gene expression data [1] and in the
NCBI's GEO database.

1. Background
There is a growing interest in the identification of genes
responsible for stem cell phenotypes and behaviour, due
largely to the envisioned potential of the field of stem cell
therapeutics. However, relatively few genes have been
identified as associated with stem cell generation or maintenance [2]. Such genes are likely to be important in deriving methods to control and direct the differentiation of
stem cells for therapy, for example by expanding a stem
cell culture or by directing differentiation towards a targeted cell type. The knowledge of the genes and processes
involved in stem cell control is particularly sparse for
embryonic stem cells (ESCs), though ESCs are the most
interesting for therapy as they have the potential to differentiate into all cell types.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/85

To confirm that the gene expression data of the first 12
hours of the time series pinpoints to genes related to
mESC differentiation, we performed a heuristic method
for the analysis of the DNA microarray data that yielded
the genes with the largest changes in expression in that
period in two or three of the cell lines analyzed.
We classified the changes in gene expression in that period
with respect to gene function and phylogenetic profile of
the corresponding protein products. Our results showed a
significant abundance of proteins related to transcription
regulation, intracellular signaling, and the cytoskeleton;
and enrichment in protein sequences whose phylogenetic
distribution of homologs indicated that their evolutionary origin occurred along the metazoan lineage.

DNA microarrays allow the simultaneous profile of thousands of mRNA transcripts, thereby providing a general
overview of the state of gene expression in a cell sample.
Here, we have used DNA microarrays to identify genes,
and thus cellular processes, that might be important to the
differentiation of mouse ESCs (mESCs). We have profiled
samples from three biologically equivalent but genetically
distinct mESC lines (J1, R1, and V6.5) undergoing in vitro
differentiation into embryoid bodies (EBs). Upon
removal of LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor), and in the
absence of murine embryonic feeder cells, mESCs can be
grown as unattached spheres termed EBs, which contain
mesodermal, ectodermal, and endodermal cells [3]. EB
formation from mESCs has been proposed as a model for
early embryonic development in terms of differentiation
capacity, morphological changes, and inductive signaling
events that drive these changes [4,5].

Finally, we applied a more standard method of DNA
microarray data analysis (Significance Analysis of Microarrays; SAM), to select 36 genes with the most consistent
expression changes during the initial 12 hours of the time
series in two or three of the cell lines analyzed. We discuss
the functions and possible relations of those 36 genes
with mESC differentiation, which includes genes known
to be involved in embryonic differentiation processes but
also several never before linked to those processes.

Measurements of gene expression were taken from biological triplicates during differentiation at 11 time points
spanning a period of two weeks following LIF removal.
Measures were taken every six hours for the first 24 hours,
then at increasing intervals, with time points at: 0 h
(undifferentiated mESCs), 6 h, 12 h, 18 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48
h, 4 d, 7 d, 9 d, and 14 d. The cells' mRNA content was
assayed at each time point using the Affymetrix
MOE430A/B GeneChip set. Our hypothesis is that genes
important for the control of the differentiation process
should show large expression changes during the initial
period of differentiation.

2. Results

We found that during the initial 12 hour period the gene
expression of transcription factors is still relatively
unchanged respect to the undifferentiated mESCs in all
three time courses. We conclude that this period represents cells not yet differentiated, and is, therefore, appropriate for the study of the early changes in gene expression
leading to differentiation.

Our study differs from previous genomic scale gene
expression surveys of human and mouse ESC differentiation [6,7] in that it examines in parallel the differentiation
of three cell lines using a greater number of time points,
starting at a much earlier point after the initiation of differentiation. We therefore expect that our findings expand
upon the information generated in those studies.

2.1. Demarcation of an early period of differentiation
In order to identify early pre-differentiation changes in
mESC gene expression, we defined the period for each of
the three time series in which cell populations were still
predominantly undifferentiated ESCs. We reasoned that
the genes involved in triggering differentiation would be
among those whose expression changed the most during
that period. We performed two analyses to define this
early period.

Firstly, we performed two-dimensional hierarchical clustering of the signal values of 1,605 probe sets corresponding to 1,327 known or predicted transcription factors
against the eleven time points for each cell line (Figure 1).
The reasoning behind this was to identify for each cell line
the period during which changes in the genetic regulatory
network were yet relatively small. We identified the time
points that clustered closely with the first (0 h) time
points, when the culture consists primarily of ESCs, and
classified these as the early period. In the J1 and V6.5

Expression values for 1,605 probe sets, corresponding to 1,327 transcription factor genes (according to protein domain analysis), were extracted from data from the MOE430A microarray for 11 time points from 0 hours to 14 days. The data for each
cell line were mean-centered by probe set and by array, and clustered using Cluster 3.0 (University of Tokyo). Clusters were
visualized using Java TreeView [72].

lines, the expression patterns at 0, 6 and 12 hours clustered together; in R1, the 0 h pattern formed a cluster with
the 6, 12, 18, and 24 hour patterns.
Secondly, in order to define the parts of the three time
series corresponding mainly to an ESC population, we
examined the signal values of probe sets corresponding to
known markers of ESCs. Out of ten marker genes examined, only three (Oct4/Pou5f1 [8], Cripto/Tdgf1 [9], and
Rex1 [10]) had high initial values of expression which
decreased gradually over time in all three cell lines. We
observed that the expression of these three marker genes
stayed between 50%-100% of their 0 h value at 6 h and 12
h (Figure 2), suggesting that the culture consists primarily
of ESC in that time range.
These two results suggest that the first three points of each
time series (representing the first 12 hours) can be used to
identify genes whose expression changes significantly in
the early stages of differentiation, before wide scale alterations of gene expression. This observation is consistent
with, and conservative relative to, a previous study of
mESC showing that a major loss of pluripotency occurs
within the first 24 hours of differentiation into EBs [7].

Based on this result, we focused on probe sets showing
consistent changes of expression in the first 12 hours of
the time course in at least two of the three cell lines. These
genes are likely to include those involved in processes
controlling early differentiation.
2.2. Broad functional analysis
To confirm that the gene expression data of the first 12
hours of the time series can be used to detect genes related
to mESC differentiation, we studied the properties of
genes related to large or small expression changes in that
period using a heuristic approach.

We first pooled together and normalized the data from
the two GeneChips used (MOE430A and MOE430B) (see
Methods). Then, we pre-selected the probe sets that were
expressed in any of the 0 h, 6 h, or 12 h time points in all
three cell types. For this we used the detection call
(present (P), marginal (M), or absent (A)) generated by
the Affymetrix MAS5 software, which indicates whether a
transcript is detected, and by extension, whether a gene is
expressed. Accordingly, we selected probe sets with at least
one P call in any of the first three time points for all three
time series. A total of 16,752 of the 45,139 probe sets on

organism: Homo sapiens (human), Brachydanio rerio (fish), Xenopus laevis (frog), Drosophila melanogaster (fly), Caenorhabditis elegans (worm), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast). For each organism, the leftmost column indicates homologues found for proteins from the 1,675 probe sets with largest gene expression changes, the middle column those from the complete set of
16,752 probe sets, and the rightmost column those from the 1,675 probe sets with smallest gene expression changes. In each
column, the dark bottom part indicates the percentage of proteins aligned along their full length (less than 30 amino acids
unmatched at the N- and C-termini of both sequences), and the lighter upper part is the percentage of proteins with sequence
similarity (no length restriction). Proteins were considered similar with a BLAST E-value < 1e-6. 2

the MOE430A and MOE430B chips passed this filter [see
Additional file 1].
Next, we computed the ratios of the signal of these probe
sets at 6 h and 12 h relative to the initial time point (6 h/
0 h and 12 h/0 h) in the three time series. Defining m6
and m12, as the median of the 6 h/0 h ratios and of the 12
h/0 h ratios for a given probe set in the three time series,
respectively, we plotted m6 against m12 for each probe set
(Figure 3). The distribution of the values indicated a small
number of probe sets with particularly large fold changes.

In order to profile the functions of the genes whose
expression was modified during this time period, we used
the GOstat server [11], which searches for Gene Ontology
(GO) terms [12] significantly under- and over-represented
in a given set of probe sets or genes in relation to a reference set (see Methods for details). We first analyzed GO
terms for the genes which showed the largest expression
changes, regardless of the direction of the change. We
sorted the probe sets by their Euclidean distance from the
origin in the logs ratio graph represented in Figure 3,
(0,0), which corresponds to probe sets with invariant gene
expression at 0 h, 6 h, and 12 h. The top and bottom 10%

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:85

of probe sets (1,675) were selected as representing the
genes with the largest and smallest gene expression
changes in the first 12 hours of differentiation, respectively. In the genes with the largest changes, the following
GO terms were over-represented: "organogenesis" (Pvalue = 0.0004) and related "morphogenesis" (0.0008),
"intracellular signaling cascade" (0.17), and "cell differentiation" (0.2). In contrast, for the genes with the smallest
changes in expression levels, over-represented GO terms
included "mitochondrion" (0.0001), "cytoplasm"
(0.008), and a series of terms related to housekeeping
functions, such as "ATP metabolism" (0.04) or "unfolded
protein binding" (0.04).
To investigate the functions associated with a directional
change in expression, we performed GOstat analysis on
the 10% of probe sets with the largest (increasing expression) and smallest (decreasing expression) sums of m6
and m12 values. Over-represented GO terms in the genes
with increased expression indicated "DNA binding"
(0.013) and "regulation of transcription, DNA dependent" (0.09). In the genes with decreased expression,
selected terms were "extracellular matrix (sensu Metazoa)" (1.63e-05), "cell communication" (0.0004), "organogenesis" (0.007), "signal transduction" (0.014),
"protease inhibitor activity" (0.02), and "amino acid
metabolism" (0.07).
This analysis suggests that protein production and functions related to communication between the cell and the
environment were down-regulated in the time period
under analysis, while the handling of genetic information
was up-regulated. These observations fit with what might
be expected; as differentiation is initiated, transcription
factors (which bind DNA and regulate transcription) are
expressed to initiate downstream changes in gene expression patterns. Meanwhile, genes for extracellular matrix
components are turned off as the cells change from growing attached to the plate, to growing in floating culture;
many of these same genes are related to cell communication.

the SPtrEMBL database [14] for six model eukaryotic
organisms: Homo sapiens, Danio rerio, Xenopus laevis, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (see Figure 4). C. elegans is considered to
have stem cells [15] as are the other metazoan organisms
considered in this analysis.
We defined as homologues those proteins identified using
BLAST with a threshold E-value of 1e-6, based on the work
of Lopez-Bigas and Ouzonis [16]. Looking at data for all
16,752 probe sets (irrespective of their changes in gene
expression) we saw an increase in the number of homologues between the worm and the yeast, which corresponds to the global sequence similarities between these
genomes (Figure 4). Taking gene expression into account,
there are no large differences in the distribution of homologues between the genes with largest and smallest gene
expression changes.
However, sequence similarity between two proteins often
covers only a small fraction of the total length of the
sequences being compared. This is not surprising if one
considers that the proteins analyzed have multiple
domains some of them present in many proteins. Partial
similarity does not imply functional equivalence between
the sequences compared. Accounting for full sequence
similarity is important, as exemplified by the human La
protein (Sjögren's syndrome antigen B) whose homologs
in fungi are not essential but which is critical for the survival of mESC cells [17]. The fact that the yeast sequence
(275 amino acids long) is much shorter than the human
and mouse proteins (408 and 415 amino acids long,
respectively), probably accounts for these striking functional differences. A stricter definition of homology
requires the identical domain organization of the compared proteins [18], which can be approximated to
sequence similarity extending over the full length of the
compared sequences. To do this, we required that fewer
than 30 amino acids were left unmatched at the C- or Ntermini of either of the two compared sequences.

2.3. Phylogenetic distribution
We hypothesized that genes important for stem cell function may have arisen along the metazoan lineage. Therefore, genes with large expression changes in the period
studied should have a particular phylogenetic signature.
To verify this, we examined the phylogenetic distribution
of the homologues of the protein products assigned to
each of the 16,752 probe sets selected above, and contrasted it with the gene expression changes.

With this additional constraint, differences in the distribution of homologues emerged (Figure 4). Relative to the
complete set described above, a smaller proportion of
proteins from genes with large expression changes was
found to have full-length homologues in non-mammalian species (with the largest difference in the fly). This
indicates that the genes with large changes in gene expression are enriched in genes which appeared after the emergence of metazoans (especially of arthropods), and before
the mammals' radiation.

We used NetAffx [13] to identify mouse protein sequences
associated with each of the probe sets, and for each mouse
protein identified the most similar protein sequence in

For genes with the smallest expression changes, an
increased proportion of proteins have full-length homologues in all species. This observation agrees with the

hypothesis that the smallest changes in expression would
be observed in housekeeping genes, which would be
expected to be conserved across a wide range of species.
2.4. Selection of a small set of probe sets and genes
To focus on a small set of genes for illustration, comparison to other analyses, and to suggest targets for experimental work, we selected probe sets showing consistent
expression changes across replicates in the three cell lines
analyzed. We used RMA [19] to normalize the data for the
first three time points in each of the three time series (9

microarrays for each cell line, as triplicate arrays were run
for each time point). Then for each cell line, we used SAM
[20] to identify the top 100 probe sets with the most significant changes in gene expression between 0 h and 6 h,
and between 0 h and 12 h, with separate analysis of the
MOE430A and MOE430B arrays.
SAM analysis of the MOE430B array indicated much
higher false discovery rates than were observed for the
MOE430A array (see Methods for details). As the
MOE430A array measures genes that are generally better

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:85

characterized than those on MOE430B, we proceeded to
report only the analysis of MOE430A.
We compared the top 100 lists for the three cell lines to
select probe sets present in at least two out of three lists
with fold changes in the same direction for each of the 6
h/0 h and 12 h/0 h analyses. This condition was fulfilled
by 15 probe sets corresponding to 11 genes down-regulated at 6 h, for 13 probe sets (13 genes) down-regulated
at 12 h, for 7 probe sets (7 genes) up-regulated at 12 h,
and for 7 probe sets (5 genes) up-regulated at 6 h (see Figure 5 and Table 1). In total, we selected 42 probe sets corresponding to 36 genes for further analysis. When these
probe sets were highlighted on the expression fold change
graph (Figure 3), they were found towards the extremes of
the distribution, indicating a degree of agreement
between the two methods.
To allow statistical analysis of over-represented gene function in genes selected using SAM, we generated a longer
list of genes present in the top 1,000 of at least two of the
three time series for the 0 h/6 h and 0 h/12 h SAM comparisons, with fold changes in the same direction. This
new list was analyzed with GOstat. In the 0 h/6 h comparison, a total of 163 up-regulated probe sets were selected.
Over-represented GO terms were "mRNA metabolism"
(P-value = 0.0012) and related terms (for example,
"nuclear mRNA splicing, via spliceosome", P-value =
0.03), "actin cytoskeleton" (0.02), "nucleic acid binding"
(0.03), and "regulation of transcription" (0.05). In the 0
h/6 h comparison, a total of 123 down-regulated probe
sets were selected. GO terms over-represented were "sterol
metabolism" (0.0004) and related, "immune cell activation" (0.006), and "organ development" (0.00856).
In the 0 h/12 h comparison, a smaller set of statistically
significant GO terms was observed. The 244 selected upregulated probe sets displayed no significant GO term.
The 113 down-regulated probe sets had over-represented
GO terms related to development, for example "organ
morphogenesis" (0.002), "growth factor activity" (0.008),
and "angiogenesis" (0.0004).
Functions related to cytoskeleton and transcriptional regulation were highlighted both here and in the broad functional analysis (section 2.2) confirming the relative
equivalence of both analyses. The presence of mRNA
related functions in the up-regulated probe sets in this
analysis is however interesting as suggests that splicing has
an important role in the control of mESC differentiation.
2.5. Analysis of 36 selected proteins
The domain organization of the 36 selected gene products
are represented in Figure 6. Their functions, subcellular
localization, and up- or down-regulation are schematized

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/85

in Figure 7. The relation of some of these genes and proteins to differentiation is known, but some are poorly
characterized.
The phylogenetic analysis of their sequences (following
the methodology described in section 2.3; details in Methods section) indicated that sequence similarity is found
for most of these proteins across the metazoan species
studied (for example, 30 of the 36 proteins, 83%, are similar to fly proteins). However, full-length sequence similarity was much more restricted (only five sequences,
14%, to fly proteins) [see additional file 2]. These proteins
contain many domains general to all metazoans, accounting for the high levels of partial sequence similarity (see
Figure 6), but their domain organization is more specific.
One such example is the Nr0b1 protein: towards the Cterminus it contains a HOLI domain, which is also found
in fly and worm proteins, but its N-terminal sequence
(amino-acids 1–257), and thus its global domain composition, are unique to mammals. Another example is
Plekha2, which has two Pleckstrin Homology (PH)
domains (Figure 6); while these domains are present in
the eukaryote phylum down to the yeasts, the sequence
between the two PH domains (residues 116–198),
present in amphibians and fish (Xenopus laevis and Danio
rerio), is missing from fly, worm, and yeast sequences.
This analysis shows that the protein products of Myl9,
Tagln, Sc4mol, and Wdr1, have full-length similar
sequences in the yeast, which argues against their involvement in stem cell related functions. Conversely, the protein products of Adm and Trh, do not appear to have any
significantly similar sequence (even partially similar) in
the worm and the fly, indicating they probable appeared
with the emergence of arthropods. Thus, their role in stem
cell (specific) related processes seems more plausible. All
36 proteins have very similar sequences in human, with at
least 28 having full-sequence-similarity.
The following sections describe these 36 proteins, their

2.5.1. Intracellular signaling related proteins
Strikingly, five out of six protein products related to intracellular signaling were associated with probe sets downregulated at 6 hr (Pim1, Pim3, SOCS3) or later at 12 hr
(Anxa3, Mras); only Plekha2 (TAPP2) was up-regulated
(Figure 6). The response of some of these genes to LIF is
known. SOCS-3, suppressor of cytokine signaling-3, a
negative regulator of the insulin receptor signaling pathway [21], is known to be transcriptionally activated by LIF
[22]. This fits with the observed reduction in its expression upon LIF removal. The role of SOCS-3 in differentia-

tion remains unclear, as it has been observed to act both
as a promoter [23] and as a repressor of differentiation in
mESC [24].

likely mediated by JAK/STAT signaling [26] and that pathway is induced by LIF, so the observed decrease in expression of both Pim1 and Pim3 is consistent.

Pim1, proviral integration site 1, and Pim3, proviral integration site 3, belong to a family of serine/threonine
kinases. PIM genes (Pim1, Pim2, Pim3) were initially discovered through proviral insertional activation by murine
leukemia virus and have been shown to cooperate with cMYC in murine leukemia. Pim genes are related to multiple growth processes including cytokine-mediated cell
growth and differentiation of bone marrow cells [25].
However, Pim knock-out mice are viable and fertile, which
makes it unlikely that these genes play an important role
in mESC differentiation. Induction of Pim expression is

Mras/Rras3, muscle and microspikes RAS, is a RAS small
GTPase. The human Mras is associated with the biogenesis
of the actin cytoskeleton in muscle cells and its product
interacts with the RAS-binding domain of a multitude of
proteins including RAF1 and RALGDS [27]. When activated by STAT3 [28], it mediates the activation of MAPK
in a cell dependant manner [29], thus linking the JAK/
STAT and RAS/MAPK pathways. This agrees with the
observed down-regulation of Mras as LIF induces JAK/
STAT, and STAT3 induces this gene.

Function and sub-cellular localization of the 36 selected proteins
Function and sub-cellular localization of the 36 selected proteins. The colours of the labels indicate the behavior of
the corresponding probe sets (dark-green: down-regulated at 6 h; light green: down-regulated at 12 h; tan: up-regulated at 12
h; pink: up-regulated at 6 h). Pathways and other related proteins are indicated with white labels. Circular arrows indicate
transport between cytoplasm and nucleus. Solid and broken arrows indicate direct activation and activation through intermediate proteins, respectively. Information about the JAK-STAT and MAPK pathways was taken from the references listed in this
manuscript or from the KEGG database [73].
Plekha2 (TAPP2) is an adaptor protein that can interact,
through its two PH domains, with the lipids of the plasma
membrane produced by the PI3 kinases, but its role is
unknown [30]; here we propose that it is associated with
early ESC differentiation.
2.5.2. Cytoskeleton related proteins
Seven protein products were related to the cytoskeleton:
three associated with probe sets up-regulated at 6 h
(Wdr1, Arpc5, and Myl9), and four associated with downregulated probe sets (Fblim1, Vim (vimentin), Tagln
(transgelin), and Mapt (microtubule-associated protein
tau)). The three down-regulated proteins are found in all
eukaryotes and therefore their importance to ESC development is dubious: WDR1 protein (also AIP1, Actin interacting protein 1) has been associated with cell

morphologic changes [31], ARPC5 is a component of the
Arp2/3 complex, an actin filament nucleator that activates
regulated actin assembly in response to extracellular signals in eukaryotic cells [32], and Myl9 (myosin, light
polypeptide 9, regulatory) is characterized by its similarity
to the human Myl9 or MLC2 [33], the myosin light chain
2.
The protein encoded by Fblim1 is known as Migfilin and
acts as mediator between the plasma membrane and the
actin cytoskeleton. Migfilin is also involved in cell morphology [34]. The other three down-regulated have developmental roles, but they are markers of differentiated
cells: Vimentin of neuroepithelial cells, Tau of retinal ganglion cells, and Transgelin (SM22alpha) of smooth muscle cells.

2.5.3. Nuclear proteins
The importance of transcriptional regulation for the control of mESC differentiation is exhibited in the high percentage of nuclear proteins in our selected set. Four
proteins corresponded to up-regulated probe sets: Smn1,
Phf21a, Myb, and Otx2. Another six proteins corresponded
to down-regulated probe sets: Brca2, Bhlbh2, Bcl3, Klf4,
Klf5, and Nr0b1.

Eight of these ten proteins regulate transcription through
DNA interaction. For example, the transcription factor
Klf4 (down-regulated at 6 hr), Kruppel-like factor 4,
inhibits murine embryonic stem cell differentiation [23],
which agrees with the observed down-regulation. It has
been described as inducing and repressing a number of
signaling pathways that control macrophage activation
[35]. Otx2 encodes a homeobox domain containing protein, which is a regulator of neurogenesis in the developing brain in mouse embryo [36].
The two that are not transcription factors, SMN1 and
BRCA2, can both shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm.
SMN1 is present in cytoplasm, nucleoplasm, and in the
Cajal bodies where it is needed for the biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins [37]; knockout of these gene leads to massive cell death in early mice
embryos [38]. BRCA2 is involved in DNA repair and can
be transported to the cytoplasm probably as a way to control its function [39].
2.5.4. Extracellular proteins
Six extracellular proteins were in our list of selected proteins, all but one down-regulated. Three of them are
related to a receptor binding function: Trh (tyrothropin
releasing hormone), Lama1 (laminin alpha-1), and Tdgf1
(Cripto). The latter is an indirect activator of the Ras/
MAPK pathway [40] and well known as involved in the
determination of the anterior-posterior axis in the mouse
embryo [41]. Laminin alpha-1, is also involved in embryonic patterning and is one of the few essential extracellular matrix proteins in early embryogenesis [42].

The others are Inhbb (inhibin beta-B) that acts as activinB, a homodimer of two Inhbb, and two angiogenic factors, Adm (adrenomedullin) [43], and Cyr61 (CCN1), the
latter being present in the extracellular matrix [44].
2.5.5. Other intracellular proteins
There were eight other intracellular proteins in our list:
four cytoplasmic, Fbxo15, 4833442J19Rik, Sfn (Smfn/
Rexo2), and Dhrs8, and three located in the ER Ero1l,
Sc4mol, and Scd2. Two of the latter, Sc4mol (ERG25) and
Scd2, were up-regulated at 6 h and are related to lipid biosynthesis, whereas up-regulated Ero1l codes for an oxidoreductase involved in oxidative ER protein folding [45].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/85

ERG25 is a sterol C-4 methyloxidase involved in the biosynthesis of sterol [46]. SCD2 is a stearoyl-CoA desaturase
involved in the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty
acids [47]. Lipids, besides their function in modulating
membrane function, can also act as second messengers in
developmental signaling. Changes in the expression of
genes coding for enzymes involved in their biosynthesis
could reflect alterations in the cellular membrane related
to the ESC differentiation process.
Cytoplasmic Sfn (Smfn/Rexo2) is a 3' to 5' exonuclease of
small (< 5nt) poly-nucleotides, hypothesized to be
involved in nucleotide recycling, and conserved in yeasts
and in Escherichia coli [48]. Fbxo15 (Fbx15), Fbox protein
15, is a protein of unknown function, known to be target
of Oct3/4 but not essential for development [49]; as it
contains an F-box domain this protein could recruit a target protein for ubiquitination. Dhrs8 (PAN1B) is an
enzyme with 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity
also involved in lipid biosynthesis [50]; 17β-dehydrogenases play roles in the activation and inactivation of both
estrogens and androgens.
In summary, our methodology primarily selected proteins
involved in intracellular signaling, cytoskeletal control,
and regulation of transcription. None of the 36 proteins
appear to have functions related to translation and
amino-acid biosynthesis, few are secreted, and the few
enzymes selected are involved in lipid biosynthesis.

3. Discussion
Mouse and human ESCs have been the subject of gene
expression profiling in previous studies using DNA microarrays, Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE), and
Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) library generation (see e.g.
[7] and references therein). However, most of those studies compared undifferentiated ESCs to their fully differentiated derivatives, and none followed gene expression
dynamics during the first 12 hours of the differentiation
process. Bhattacharya et al. [51] compared five lines of
hESCs to 8-day old EBs. Dvash et al. [52] compared H9
hESCs to 2 day, 10 day, and 30 day old EBs. Palmqvist et
al. [7] compared R1 mESC with ESC differentiated for 18
hours and 72 hours. Sekkai et al. [6] compared undifferentiated Gs2 hESC with ESC differentiated for 16, 24, and
48 hours. The objective in most of these works was to
detect genes turned off or on temporarily during the early
differentiation period. Here, we have carried this idea further by obtaining measurements of mESC differentiating
into EBs during a two-week period, including measurements of gene expression as early as 6 hours and 12 hours
after differentiation was started.
Our analysis examined three genetically distinct mESC
lines (R1, J1, and V6.5) with all measurements in biolog-

ical triplicate, both to assess the robustness of the
observed changes and to avoid biases due to particular
mouse strains. We showed the existence and duration of
an early period in the time series of differentiation prior to
the onset of differentiation. This is important for the characterization of gene expression in ESCs undergoing differentiation before they differentiate into another cell type,
or a mixture of cell types. Clustering the data both by
expression levels of transcription factor genes (Figure 1)
and expression patterns of mESC markers (Figure 2) suggested that the first three time points in the time series (i.e.
the start point, 6 hours, and 12 hours) corresponded to
undifferentiated stem cells in which major expression
changes had not yet begun. We took this as an indication
that the set of genes with expression changes during that
early period would include genes that trigger the differentiation process.
Next we studied patterns of gene expression during this
early period compared to the initial values in the undifferentiated state. We used the changes with respect to the signal at initial time point of each series (Figure 3). We
observed a distinct functional profile and phylogenetic
distribution for the genes with large expression changes
during the period under study, which were selected as possibly involved in the differentiation process.
Although this analysis provided a way to test several types
of gene expression profiles in a simple manner, we chose
a more sensitive method of gene expression analysis to
select a list of exemplar genes, SAM [20], which allows the
detection of consistent changes in gene expression using
the variation between replicates.
Using SAM analyses of gene expression to contrast the initial condition with either the 6 h or the 12 h time point,
we focused on 42 probe sets (representing 36 protein
products) with the most consistent changes of gene
expression in at least two of the three cell lines analyzed
(Figure 5). These probe sets had functional and phylogenetic properties consistent to those of the genes selected as
expressed and whose expression changed the most in the
broad analysis.
Among the genes selected, we note a majority of functions
related to the control of transcription (Klf4, Klf5, Bcl3,
Myb, Otx2, Bhlhb2, Phf21a, Nr0b1), intracellular signaling
(Socs3, Anxa3, Mras, Pim1, Pim3), and cytoskeletal related
(Fblim1, Arpc5, Tagln, Wdr1, Myl9, Vim, Mapt) (Figure 6).
Gene expression changes must in large part be modulated
through transcription factors, thus we would expect such
functions to be well represented in the lists of changing
genes. We note that this is one of the most represented
functions and that we found both up-regulated and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/85

down-regulated transcription factors. This suggests that, at
least in the 0 h–12 h frame, the transcriptional control is
not limited to a small number of transcription factors.
Of the 36 protein products studied, six were associated
with the related JAK-STAT and MAPK signaling pathways
(Tdgf1, Socs3, Pim1, Pim3, Mras, Mapt), which are activated by LIF. These six genes were down-regulated. As
these pathways transduce a large variety of external signals, this down-regulation must have a major effect on the
cell state.
The abundance of cytoskeletal proteins is not surprising in
light of the number of intracellular signaling proteins
detected. It is well known that cytoskeletal proteins,
besides their structural function, serve to localize intracellular signal pathways (two such examples in ESC are Paxillin [53] and beta 1 integrin [54]).
The broad reduction in the expression levels of genes
related to the extracellular matrix (two of which, Lama1
and Cyr61, are among the genes most significantly downregulated) reflects the changes in the cell interaction properties that happen upon differentiation of mESC. ES cells
are cultured as an attached monolayer, but their differentiated derivatives grow as unattached spheres. Some studies are starting to shed light on how the interrelation
between mESC and their environment, mediated through
proteins of the extracellular matrix, controls their selfrenewal [55]. Our study suggests Lama1 and Cyr61 as candidate genes for the study of this process.
The absence of certain functions from the genes selected
in our broad and focused analyses also provides information about the timing of cell processes involved in ESC
differentiation. Modifications in the mobility of chromatin interacting proteins are known to occur during loss of
pluripotentiality of ESC [56]. However, we did not
observe expression changes in the genes for chromatin
interacting proteins other than BRCA2, which is implicated in chromatin remodeling [57]. Neither did we
observe large modifications in the expression of genes
coding for surface receptors; such changes are occurring
later in human ESC differentiation into embryoid bodies
[52]. Apparently, the only proteins with enzymatic activity in our sort list of 36 were two endoplasmic reticulum
resident proteins, Sc4mol (ERG25) and Scd2, both up-regulated at 6 hours and related to lipid biosynthesis. This
may indicate a lipid involvement in signaling associated
with the differentiation process.
We hypothesized that the genes that control ES differentiation are likely to have arisen in organisms which have
stem cells, and thus to be found only in metazoans. Other
genes which control specific mammalian aspects of ES dif-

ferentiation may show a distribution specific to mammals. To examine possible correlation between genes with
changing expression and the phylogenetic distribution of
their protein products, we searched for their protein
homologues in model organisms, distinguishing between
homologues with total or partial sequence similarity. The
contrast between the conservation in arthropods and
other eukaryotic organisms of the genes of changing
expression (Figure 4) suggests that our data and approach
are useful for detecting genes that might be associated
with stem cell functions.
A similar analysis for the 36 mouse protein products with
the most significant changes [see additional file 2] indicates that several of the proteins have no full-length similar sequences in the yeast. Others that have more general
functions (e.g. DNA binding, protein phosphorylation)
are not exclusive to mammals as they contain domains
that are found in lower eukaryotes such as yeast (e.g. PH,
RAS, LIM; Figure 5). Their full sequence domain organization is more revealing of their taxonomic specificity: while
31 of these 36 mouse genes had high similarity to fly
sequences, only 5 of those had full-sequence similarity.
Since the set of 36 mouse gene products studied is highly
replicated in the human genome (with highly similar
sequences for all 36 and full-length similarity for 28), we
suggest that these 36 genes will include genes relevant
both for mouse and human ESC differentiation. However,
the generalization of results obtained in mESCs to conclusions about hESCs must be approached with caution as
there are many obvious differences between human and
murine ESCs, starting with the inability of maintaining
hESC pluripotentiality with LIF.
In summary, our study provides for the first time a functional and phylogenetic signature associated with gene
expression patterns in early differentiating mESC. This is
not surprising since this study differs from previous studies in cell types and time frame analyzed. To contrast our
results to those from previous studies, we compared our
list of 24 down-regulated genes at 6 and 12 hours from
MOE430A (Table 1) with the list of 143 down-regulated
genes at 16, 24, and 48 hours from Sekkai et al (Gs2 hESC;
Supplementary Table 1 from [6]) and the list of 48 downregulated genes at 18 and 72 hours from Palmqvist et al
(H9 mESC; Table 3 in [7]) (Figure 8). Only one gene, Bcl3,
was identified by all three analyses, although the importance of this gene for embryo development is doubtful
since knock-out mice for this gene are viable only showing
immunological defects [58]. Our list has five genes in
common with the other two studies, more than they share
in common with each other. However, differences in
experimental design and analyses complicate the compar-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/85

ison to previous studies, especially since we focused on an
earlier time frame.
In this respect, we note that three cytoskeletal genes that
we found to be up-regulated at 6 hr (Wdr1, Myl9, Arpc5)
are down-regulated in our data at 18 hr and 24 hr (Figure
4). Studies not including the early time points would miss
the initial period of up-regulation, and report these genes
as decreasing with differentiation. Similarly, Bhlhb2 and
Sc4mol are down-regulated at 6 hr and later up-regulated
(Figure 5). We take this as an indication that our study
contributes useful information not provided by earlier
analyses.
Differences observed between the results obtained from
each cell line provide justification for our approach of
using multiple cell lines. For example, in our SAM analysis
(section 2.4) two probe sets indicated significant gene
expression changes during the first 6 hours for the Hnrpdl
gene (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D-like,
coding for protein JKTBP, an mRNA interacting protein
that shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm [59]). However, the gene was up-regulated in R1 and down-regulated
in V6.5. An analysis using either one or the other cell type
would report opposite results. By using the consensus of
three cell lines we expect to have increased the relevancy
of our observations.

4. Conclusion
In this work, we have proposed a set of functions and
genes whose protein products might participate in processes relevant to the early differentiation of mammalian
ESCs. These genes probably participate in resetting the cellular mRNA set, while intercellular interactions and protein production are temporarily slowed down before
changes in chromatin remodeling and surface receptors
occur.
We have focused on the early stages of mESC differentiation. Further work is possible to study later stages, apply
other methodologies to study gene expression, and to
compare to other microarray experiments measuring stem
cell gene expression changes with differentiation. To facilitate these future studies we have made our DNA microarray data available both as raw data and in the context of a
database of stem cell gene expression data [1]. We expect
that this resource will constitute an advance in the field of
stem cell research.

5. Methods
5.1. mESC culture
Three mouse ES cell lines derived from different mouse
strains were used. J1 is from 129Sv/J, R1 is from a cross
between 129X1 and 129S1, and V6.5 is from a cross
between 129Sv/J and C57BL/6. By using several cell lines

we will better be able to identify the genes critical for ES
differentiation as these should be common for all three.
R1, J1, and V6.5 mESCs were maintained at 37°C humidified air with 5% CO2 on a layer of irradiated DR4 mouse
embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and fed daily with a complete
change of ESC maintenance medium consisting of highglucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)
(all reagents obtained from Invitrogen Life Technologies,
Burlington, Ontario, Canada, unless otherwise indicated)
supplemented with 15% ESC Characterized fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Hyclone, Logan, Utah, USA), 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 2 mM glutamine, 1,000 U/ml LIF
(Chemicon, Temecula, California, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, Oakville, Ontario, Canada). mESCs for
gene expression profiling were from passage 13 and had

been frozen at 106 cells per vial. Cells were passaged every
second day to maintain undifferentiated state. To passage
cells, a single-cell suspension was generated by treatment
with 0.25% trypsin and 1 mM EDTA (T/E) for 5 minutes
until cells detached from the culture vessel surface.
Trypsin activity was then quenched with an equal volume
of mESC media. The cells were centrifuged at 1,100 rpm
for 4 minutes and resuspended in ESC media. Viable cells
were plated at 1 × 106 per 100-mm dish on irradiated
MEFs and cultured for a further 48 hours at 37°C, 5% CO2
before RNA isolation by RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga,
Ontario, Canada). In subsequent experiments, all cells
used were within five passages of initial thawing. DR4
MEFs were maintained at 37°C humidified air with 5%
CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml
penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mM nonessential
amino acids, and 2 mM glutamine. Cells to be irradiated

were trypsinized, resuspended in 2 ml of medium, and
exposed to 60 Gy from an X-ray source before replating for
use as feeder cells.
5.2. Preparation of mESCs for differentiation
mESCs were thawed and cultured for two passages over 96
hours as described above. To prepare cells for differentiation, they were harvested and washed as described above,
resuspended in ESC maintenance medium, and preplated
on tissue culture plates for 1 hour at 37°C, 5% CO2 to
deplete contaminating DR4 MEFs. Cells were pelleted by
centrifugation as above, and viable cell numbers were
determined. The preplated mESCs were passaged at a density of 1 to 2 × 107 cells per low adherence p100 tissue culture dish in the presence of MEF media. Fifty percent
media exchanges were performed every second day. Cells
were harvested at the indicated timepoints and RNA isolated as above.
5.3. DNA microarray experiments
We extracted mRNA from three mESC cell lines (R1, J1,
V6.5) at 11 time points following removal of LIF from a
feeder-cell-free culture. cDNA generated from the mRNA
was hybridized to the Affymetrix MOE430 GeneChip set
in biological triplicate.

The data for each of the three time series are deposited in
the StemBase database of stem cell gene expression [1,60]
under the experiment identifiers E165, E201, and E113,
for cell lines R1, J1 and V6.5, respectively. The data are
also deposited in the GEO repository of gene expression
data [61] with the series accession identifiers GSE2972,
GSE3749, and GSE3231, respectively.
5.4. Computational analyses
Expression data, obtained in biological triplicate, were
processed as follows. For the broad analysis of gene function changes (Figure 3) [see Additional file 1] the MAS5
signal data replicates were averaged, then data from
MOE430A and MOE430B GeneChips was pooled and
scaled per sample by normalizing to the trimmed mean
for all probe sets in the sample (98%). MAS5 calls were
collated by majority vote, that is, a probe set was considered to have a P call (Present) if MAS5 generated a P call
in at least two of the three replicates.

For other fold change analyses, we normalized the
Affymetrix CEL files using RMA [19] implemented in Bioconductor [62]. For the study of the complete time series
(Figures 1, 2, and 5), the data from all 11 time points were
normalized for each cell line. For the identification of
coherent gene expression changes during the first 12
hours of the series (sections 2.4 and 2.5) the data from the
first three time points were normalized for each cell line.
We used the implementation of the SAM algorithm [20]

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/85

from the Bioconductor siggenes package to identify probe
sets whose signal showed significant change between 0 h
and 6 h, and between 0 h and 12 h, in each of the three
cell lines. We selected probes sets in the top 100 most significantly changed list for at least two of the three cell
lines. The analysis was done separately for the MOE430A
and MOE430B GeneChip data. SAM reported higher false
discovery rates (FDRs) for the lists from the MOE430B
array than for the MOE430A lists. For example, for the
analysis of V6.5 between 0 hours and 6 hours, the false
discovery rate reported for the top ~1000 significantly
changed probe sets is of 22% for MOE430A and of 53%
for MOE430B. Accordingly, the level of agreement
between cell lines was also much lower in the MOE430B
than in the MOE430A, and therefore we concentrated on
the results from the MOE430A GeneChip. FDRs for the
MOE430A top 100 lists was in the 9–16% range.
The gene name, gene symbol, and GO terms corresponding to each probe set were retrieved from the NetAffx
annotation database (April 2005 version; [63,13]). Additional GO terms were obtained by examination of related
databases assisted by automated data mining procedures
[64]. We retrieved amino acid sequences and gene information from NCBI [65]. The protein domain architecture
was predicted using domain databases (SMART [66],
Pfam [67], and InterPro [68]).
GOstat [11,69] was used to examine groups of probe sets
(both in the broad and in the focused analyses) for overand under-represented GO terms, using MGI [70] as the
GO to gene association database, and using the Benjamini
false discovery rate correction. In the broad functional
analysis (section 2.2), probe sets were provided as gene
identifiers, and the full list of 16,752 probe sets selected as
expressed in at least one condition was provided as a reference set. Using this alternative reference set prevents
bias arising from the fact that many classes of genes (for
example, olfactory receptors) are not expressed in mESCs.
Use of the whole array gene set as a reference would have
resulted in such GO terms being highlighted as significantly under-represented. In the focused analysis (section
2.4), gene names were provided as gene identifiers, and
the reference set was the full mouse genome. We reported
GO terms selected among the best 30 of each analysis and
involving a minimum of six genes.
We used BLAST [71] to perform homology searches
against the SPtrEMBL protein database [14] (section 2.3)
and against the NCBI's organism databases [61] (section
2.5) [see additional file 2], to study the phylogenetic distribution of the genes across model eukaryotic organisms.
