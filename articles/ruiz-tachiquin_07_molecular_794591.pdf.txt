Abstract
Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small DNA-containing virus with 4 genes, C, S, X and P.
The S gene codes for the surface antigen (HBsAg), which contains the "a" determinant, the main
region for induction of a protective humoral immune response. To compare the genotype and
sequence of the "a" determinant between strains isolated from asymptomatic and symptomatic
Mexican HBV carriers.
Results: 21 asymptomatic (blood donors) and 12 symptomatic (with clinical signs and with >1 year
lamivudine treatment) HBV carriers were studied; all patients were positive for the HBsAg in
serum. Viral load, genotypes, and subtypes were determined in plasma. A fragment of the S gene
including the "a" determinant was PCR amplified and sequenced to determine genotype, subtype
and to identify mutations. Mean viral load was 0.7965 × 104 copies/ml in asymptomatic carriers and
2.73 × 106 copies/ml in symptomatic patients. Genotypes H, C, and F were identified in
asymptomatic individuals; whereas H was dominant in symptomatic patients. A fragment of 279 bp
containing the "a" determinant was amplified from all 33 carriers and sequences aligned with S gene
sequences in the GenBank. Mutations identified were Y100N, T126I, Q129H and N146K in the
asymptomatic group, and F93I and A128V in the symptomatic group.
Conclusion: Differences in genotype and in mutations in the "a" determinant were found between
strains from asymptomatic and symptomatic HBV Mexican carriers.

Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small, non-cytopathic virus
with a circular partially double-strand DNA genome of

approximately 3.2 Kb [1]. The genome has 4 overlapping
genes: PreS/S, PreC/C, X, and P. The Pre S/S gene encodes
for the three envelope proteins, large, middle, and small

or HBsAg. The PreC/C gene encodes for the nucleocapsid
protein and HBeAg. The X gene encodes for the transactivating protein X and the P gene encodes for polymerase
with reverse transcriptase (RT) and RNase H activity [1].
The HBsAg contains the major epitopes for induction of a
protective humoral immune response [2-6]. These
epitopes are localized in the region known as the "a"
determinant, between amino acid residues 99 and 169 [710], and are involved in the binding of antibodies against
HBsAg. Amino acids changes in this region render mutant
strains able to escape immune responses induced by vaccines [5,6,11,12]. Immune-escape mutants occur naturally [13-15], and in strains from patients with a weak or
negative HBsAg reactivity in detection assays [10,15].
HBV strains are classified into 8 main genomic groups or
genotypes, designated A through H [16-18], arbitrarily
defined by an intergroup divergence of more than 8%
based on the complete genomes [16,19-21]. The relationship between subtypes and genotypes has been reported,
and several studies have described the geographic distribution for the different HBV subtypes/genotypes
[16,17,20,22-25]. The study of HBV genotype has recently
been focused on the clinical outcome of the infection,
since studies suggest a possible association with the natural history and severity of the infection [26].
In Mexico, frequency of HBV chronic carriers is low, and
the prevalence of HBsAg in blood donors ranges from
0.15 to 1.4% [27,28]; the frequency of hepatocellular carcinoma is also low [29]. Scarce studies have addressed
genetic diversity and amino acids changes in HBsAg of
HBV strains from Mexico [30]. The aim of the present
work was to study genetic diversity in the S gene of HBV
strains from asymptomatic and symptomatic carriers in
Mexico. Genotype and mutations in the "a" determinant
of the S gene leading to amino acids changes were compared between these two groups.

Results
We studied 21 asymptomatic HBsAg carriers, 3 women
(mean age 30 years old) and 18 men (mean age 42 years
old), with average viral load of 0.7965 × 104 copies/ml;
and 12 symptomatic patients, 5 women (mean age 50
years old) and 7 men (mean age 39 years old), with average viral load of 2.7 × 106 copies/mL (Table 1). Functional
hepatic tests confirmed hepatic damage in symptomatic
but not in asymptomatic cases (Table 1). Genotypes were
determined by reverse hybridization and sequencing.
Genotypes determined by reverse hybridization were H,
C, F, C/H, C/F/H and indeterminate (ID) in asymptomatic cases, whereas in symptomatic patients only H and
C/H genotypes were found (Table 2). On the other hand,
the genotypes determined with the sequencing technique
were only H, and C; genotype H was the predominant

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/6

type (Table 2). In four asymptomatic cases the genotype
could not be determined (ID) with the reverse hybridization technique, but was identified as genotype H with the
sequencing method. Sequences of the "a" determinant
were aligned with sequences of genotypes A-H (Z72478,
X98077, AB048704, AB048701, AB032431, AB036907,
AF160501, U91827, NC_003977) and analyzed to identify mutations. Mutations identified in HBV strains from
the asymptomatic group were Y100N, T126I, Q129H and
N146K; whereas in strains from the symptomatic group
identified mutations were F93I and A128V. Subtypes
found in the asymptomatic group were adw4q+, adw1q+,
and adrq+; whereas in symptomatic patients subtypes
detected where only adw4q+, and adrq+. Altogether, the
genotype/subtype most frequent in our population was
H/adw4q+ (Table 2).
Diversity in the amino acid sequence of the "a" determinant among strains from asymptomatic and symptomatic
HBV Mexican carriers is presented in Table 3. T113S,
S114T, R122K, I126T and P127L were the most frequent
in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients; whereas
A159G, R160K, F161Y and V168A were more frequent in
symptomatic patients.

Discussion
In this work we analyzed genetic diversity in HBV isolates
from asymptomatic (blood donors) and symptomatic
chronic carriers in Mexico. Genotypes were determined
with a commercially available reverse-hybridization technique and compared with the sequencing technique.
Reverse hybridization allows the detection of infection
with mixed genotypes, suggesting that this technique is
more reliable than sequencing to detect quasispecies
present in lower proportion in the sample; although in
some cases it failed to establish the genotype. On the
other hand, besides genotyping, nucleic acid sequencing
provides information on nucleotide and amino acid
sequences of the region investigated, while other molecular methods detect only the point mutations specified by
the probes or primers used.
Of interest, a higher diversity in the infecting genotypes
was found among asymptomatic carriers (H, C, F, C/H, C/
F/H), than in symptomatic patients, where genotype H
was found in all cases and in only one case a C/H infection was detected. These results would suggest that in our
population, genotype H strains are more prevalent than C
and F genotypes in symptomatic cases. This observation is
relevant since studies indicate certain association of the
genotype with the clinical outcome of the infection; thus,
in hepatocellular carcinoma, genotype C was more prevalent in patients >50 years and genotype B more prevalent
in patients <50 years of age, than in age-matched asymptomatic carriers [37]. Of interest, in our study, genotype C

was identified in four of the 21 asymptomatic cases. Alternatively, LMV treatment in the symptomatic cases might
be selecting for the H genotype. Diversity of HBV genotypes may also affect the accuracy of diagnostic tests and
therapeutic decisions [32].
HBV has been classified in eight genotypes, A through H
[18], which show a geographic distribution. In this study,
genotype H was found as the predominant genotype in
Mexican strains, followed by genotypes C and F. Genotype H has a close phylogenetic relationship with genotype F [17,18]. The genotype C is reported as prevalent in
Asian populations [20,33], and patients observed in our
population might correspond to imported cases, due to
the increased mobility among Asian and Latin-American
countries; in fact, recent reports have documented the
presence of HBV genotype H strains among Japanese
blood donors [34], as an evidence of the global mobility.
The genotype prevalent in a population may determine
the type of mutations prevalent in the infecting strains
[35]; for example, the immune-escape mutant G145R is
closely associated with genotype D [36]. HBsAg has also
been classified in subtypes based on the sequence of the S
gene and in identification of the amino acids encoded at
specific positions [33]; in our population, subtypes, like
genotypes, were more diverse among strains from asymptomatic carriers than in symptomatic cases.

The hepatic function tests and HBV viral load showed that
in our symptomatic patients there was hepatic damage
and high viral replication, which suggests that the antiviral treatment with LMV was not working, even thought
the drug was administered for at least one year in all cases.
It is likely that after a long failed therapy, resistance to
LMV has been developed. The main mutations associated
with LMV resistance are located at the RT gene in the 204
position (rtM204I/V), which is in the catalytic YMDD
motif. The P gene overlaps the S gene and thus mutations
selected during antiviral treatment may cause concomitant changes to the overlapping reading frame; in particular altering the C-terminal region of HBsAg. Thus for
mutations associated with LMV resistance, the rtM204V
change is associated with a I195M change in the S gene
(sI195M), while the rtM204I change is associated with
three possible changes in the S gene, sW196S, sW196L, or
a stop codon. In addition, mutation rtA181T is associated
with the stop mutation sW172stop in the S gene [37].
However, in our study, none of these mutations were
found in the S gene of the strains from symptomatic cases.
There has been several reports on HBV S gene mutants
affecting amino acid position 120, 123, 124 126, 129,
131, 141, 144 and 145 of the "a" determinant and preS
region. The most relevant mutations seem to be the substitutions of amino acid G145R, K141E and T131I and

Virology Journal 2007, 4:6

insertion of 3 amino acids between residues 123 and 124,
since they markedly affect the antigenic structure of
HBsAg [38]. Mexican strains of the present study showed
mutations at the first and second loop of the "a" determinant; although it should be noted that these mutations
differed between asymptomatic and symptomatic strains.
Thus, in the asymptomatic cases mutations were found at
positions 100, 126, 129, and 146, whereas in symptomatic patients mutation were in positions 93 and128;
none of the above mutations are reported to affect significantly the antigenic structure of the protein. It should be
emphasized that all cases included in the study were
selected because they were HBsAg positive and so those
patients with mutations rendering the S protein undetectable with the antibodies tested, were excluded.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we report the genotypes of HVB prevalent
in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in Mexico and
show that there is more genetic diversity and mutations in
the "a" determinant of HBV strains infecting asymptomatic carriers than in symptomatic patients. In HBV
strains from our population genotype H and subtype
adw4q+ were predominant. The role of viral genotype and
subtype, as well as the ethnicity of the host in the determination of the clinical outcome of HBV infection is still
unclear, and studies on genotypes infecting populations
should help to clarify this issue.

Methods
Serum and plasma samples
Blood samples were drawn from 21 asymptomatic blood
donors, at the Central Blood Bank, Centro Médico
Nacional-Siglo XXI (CMN-SXXI), Instituto Mexicano del
Seguro Social (IMSS), and from 12 symptomatic patients
attending the Hepatitis Clinic, Gastroenterology Service,
General Hospital, CMN-SXXI-IMSS. All 33 patients were
selected because they were known to be HBsAg carriers.
Symptomatic cases were receiving lamivudine (LMV)
treatment during at least one year. The study was
approved by the IRB Committee of IMSS. Informed consent was obtained from all studied participants.

DNA extraction
HBV DNA was extracted from plasma specimens with
QIAamp® Ultrasens® Virus kit (QIAGEN) following manufacturer's instructions.
PCR amplification of the S gene
A fragment of the S gene was amplified by nested PCR.
Sequences of the primers and their relative positions were
as follows: outer primers included HBV1-sense, 5'-CGC
TGG ATG TGT CTG CGGCGT-3', position 371–391, and
HBV2-antisense, 5'-CGA ACC ACT GAA CAA ATG GCA
CT-3', position 682–704; inner primers were HBV3-sense,

431 and HBV4-antisense, 5'-GGC ACT AGT AAA CTG
AGC CA-3', position 668–687 (30). Ten μL of DNA
extracted from plasma (template) were mixed with 40 μL
of reaction mixture containing 1× PCR Buffer, 50 pmoles
of each primer, 0.8 mM dNTPs, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 2.5 U
Taq polymerase (Amplificasa® BIOGÉNICA, Mexico City,
Mexico). Annealing and elongation for both primer pairs
was for 90 sec at 47°C and 72°C, respectively. The first
PCR was carried out for 45 cycles and the nested PCR for
40 cycles, using an initial denaturing step of 95°C for 2
min and a final amplification step of 72°C for 15 min
[39].
Sequencing
PCR products (279 bp) were run in 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and the isolated band was extracted with a
commercial kit (QIAquick® Gel Extraction Kit, QIAGEN).
The purified product was used for sequencing with the
chain termination method, using Big Dye Terminator version 3.1 (ABI PRISM™, Foster City, CA, USA). Extension
products were purified (DyeEx™ 2.0 Kit, QIAGEN) and
separated in an automated DNA genetic analyzer (377 ABI
PRISM™).
