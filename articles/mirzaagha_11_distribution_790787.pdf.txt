feedlot cattle fed subtherapeutic antimicrobials

Abstract
Background: Feedlot cattle in North America are routinely fed subtherapeutic levels of antimicrobials to prevent
disease and improve the efficiency of growth. This practice has been shown to promote antimicrobial resistance
(AMR) in subpopulations of intestinal microflora including Escherichia coli. To date, studies of AMR in feedlot
production settings have rarely employed selective isolation, therefore yielding too few AMR isolates to enable
characterization of the emergence and nature of AMR in E. coli as an indicator bacterium. E. coli isolates (n = 531)
were recovered from 140 cattle that were housed (10 animals/pen) in 14 pens and received no dietary
antimicrobials (control - 5 pens, CON), or were intermittently administered subtherapeutic levels of chlortetracycline
(5 pens-T), chlortetracycline + sulfamethazine (4 pens-TS), or virginiamycin (5 pens-V) for two separate periods over
a 9-month feeding period. Phenotype and genotype of the isolates were determined by susceptibility testing and
pulsed field gel electrophoresis and distribution of characterized isolates among housed cattle reported. It was
hypothesized that the feeding of subtherapeutic antibiotics would increase the isolation of distinct genotypes of
AMR E. coli from cattle.
Results: Overall, patterns of antimicrobial resistance expressed by E. coli isolates did not change among diet
groups (CON vs. antibiotic treatments), however; isolates obtained on selective plates (i.e., MA,MT), exhibited multiresistance to sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol more frequently when obtained from TS-fed steers than from
other treatments. Antibiograms and PFGE patterns suggested that AMR E. coli were readily transferred among
steers within pens. Most MT isolates possessed the tet(B) efflux gene (58.2, 53.5, 40.8, and 50.6% of isolates from
CON, T, TS, and V steers, respectively) whereas among the MA (ampicillin-resistant) isolates, the tem1-like
determinant was predominant (occurring in 50, 66.7, 80.3, and 100% of isolates from CON, T, TS, and V steers,
respectively).
Conclusions: Factors other than, or in addition to subtherapeutic administration of antibiotics influence the
establishment and transmission of AMR E. coli among feedlot cattle.

Background
In North America, antimicrobials are often fed to feedlot cattle at subtherapeutic levels for disease prevention
and to improve feed efficiency [1]. Although such a
practice reduces production costs, it may also promote
the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) both
in pathogenic and in non-pathogenic bacteria [2]. It has
been hypothesized that continuous, low-dose

administration of antimicrobials increases the risk of
AMR development, in comparison with short term,
high-dose therapeutic use [3,4]. Concern also exists that
subtherapeutic administration of antimicrobials promotes horizontal gene transfer between commensal and
pathogenic bacteria [5].
In Canada, antimicrobials used for growth enhancement in livestock are approved through the guidelines
established by the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations
of Health Canada. Examples of antimicrobials presently
approved for in-feed administration include tetracyclines, virginiamycin, penicillin, monensin, sulfonamides

and tylosin. The potential risk to human health via promotion of AMR is perhaps greatest for those products
used to treat both livestock and humans (i.e., tetracyclines and sulfonamides). There is also a concern that
veterinary antimicrobials classed in the same antibiotic
family as those used in human therapy may promote the
development of cross-resistance. For example, the subtherapeutic use in livestock of virginiamycin, a streptogramin, may lead to resistance to Synercid ® , an
antibiotic of the same family, used as a last resort treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in
humans [6].
Several studies (reviewed by [2]) have investigated the
effect of administering subtherapeutic antimicrobials to
swine and poultry on antibiotic resistance in commensal
and pathogenic gut microflora, but comparatively few
have examined the impact of this management practice
on AMR in beef cattle [7,8]. Comparisons of organic
and conventional livestock production systems [9], dairies [10] and of ground beef originating from conventional vs. “natural” sources [11] have generally revealed
a higher prevalence of AMR in conventional systems.
The majority of the studies that have been conducted
are of an epidemiological nature and detailed characterization of the limited number of AMR isolates collected
has not been undertaken.
Our research team recently conducted a comprehensive study to document the prevalence of AMR Escherichia coli among feedlot cattle being fed various
antibiotics at subtherapeutic levels, in two intermittent
periods, over the course of their growing and fattening
periods [12]. From those data, we concluded that withdrawal of subtherapeutic antibiotics during the feeding
period had little impact on the prevalence of tetracycline- or ampicillin-resistant E. coli in the cattle. In this
paper, we present a more comprehensive assessment of
531 selected E. coli isolates collected from individual
steers on four representative sampling days throughout
the feeding period. Through phenotypic and genotypic
characterization, the objective of this study was to
explore the distribution of AMR E. coli among individual animals fed the different diets within the feedlot
environment. It was hypothesized that the subtherapeutic administration of antibiotics would alter the occurrence of AMR E. coli phenotypes among animals.

Methods
The E. coli isolates investigated in the present work
were a sub-set of those archived during a larger study
[12] in which prevalence of AMR E. coli was assessed
over the course of a backgrounding/finishing feeding
trial in a research feedlot. Full methodological detail of
their isolation has been described previously [12], and is
described briefly below.

Animals, housing and diets

The study was conducted at the Lethbridge Research
Centre feedlot (Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada) using
crossbred steer calves penned in groups of 10. Cattle
were housed in rows of parallel pens with the same antibiotic treatment administered to 5 adjacent pens. Pens
were separated by porosity fencing and a pen-specific
feed bunk lined the front of each pen. The bunk was of
a sufficient length so that all individuals within a pen
could feed at the same time. Cattle were retained in the
pen throughout the feeding period and there was no
need for equipment to enter any of the pens during the
feeding period. Adjacent pens within each treatment
shared a common water bowl, but the assignment of
treatments to pens ensured that water bowls were
shared only by steers in the same treatment group. Cattle were processed through a common handling area,
but handled in the order of the control group first followed by the virginiamycin group, chlortetracycline
group and finally the chlorotetracycline-sulfamethazine
group (see below). The area was thoroughly cleaned
after each group passed through the handling area. The
calves used in the study received no antibiotics prior to
or during shipment to the Lethbridge Research Centre
feedlot. Furthermore, no subtherapeutic or therapeutic
antibiotics were administered prior to this start of this
study. Throughout the study, care of the steers was in
accordance with guidelines set by the Canadian Council
on Animal Care [13].
Diet composition and feeding duration were typical of
the feedlot industry in western Canada. A silage-based
growing diet containing 70% barley silage, 25% barley
grain and 5% vitamin/mineral supplement was fed for
115 days, followed by a step-wise 21-d transition to a
grain-based finishing diet (85% barley grain, 10% barley
silage and 5% supplement) that was fed to slaughter. For
two discrete periods indicated in Figure 1, the

Silage-based diets were fed for 115 d, followed by 21 d of transition
to the grain-based diet, which was then fed until shipment of cattle
to market. Shaded areas indicate the periods that antimicrobials

The larger trial [12] from which this study was drawn
included six experimental treatments (control plus five
different dietary antibiotics), each fed to five pens of 10
cattle with the exception of the Aureo S-700G treatment
which only had four replicate pens. Limited resources
for detailed characterization of E. coli isolates dictated
that we reduce the number of treatments and sampling
days examined. As a result, isolates from monesnin and
tylosin treatments were not examined. The present analysis includes isolates from only the control group
(CON; no antibiotics added to supplement) and three of
the five antibiotic treatment groups: 1) chlortetracycline
(T), provided as Aureomycin 100-G (Alpharma Inc.,
Vineland, NJ, USA) fed at 11 ppm; 2) chlortetracycline
+ sulfamethazine (TS), provided as Aureo S-700G
(Alpharma Inc.) fed at 44 ppm; 3) virginiamycin (V),
provided as V-Max (Pfizer Animal Health, New York,
NY, USA) fed at 31 ppm. The antimicrobial agents were
selected based on the commonality of their use in the
Canadian feedlot industry and were fed at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturers. Virginiamycin was included in the study because it is not
registered for use in Canada and, as a result, neither
calves nor their dams would have had prior exposure to
this antibiotic.

tests and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles [14],
and isolates from each steer, sampling day and medium
of isolation (when available) were selected for archiving.
For the present study, isolates cultured on three media
were considered: (i) MacConkey agar with no added
antibiotics added (as a control, denoted MC); (ii) MacConkey agar amended with 4 μg/ml tetracycline hydrochloride (MT); and (iii) MacConkey agar amended with
50 μg/ml ampicillin (MA). The concentration of tetracycline was set below [15] standards to ensure isolation of
tetracycline-resistant E. coli. Ampicillin concentration
exceeded the CLSI standard, but was needed to curtail
overgrowth that was interfering with isolation of distinct
colonies. From the MC-, MT- and MA-selected colonies,
a collection of 6354 isolates was established.
The present study aimed to investigate approximately
10% of the available isolates. Archived M T - and M A selected isolates from 140 animals, including all 50 steers
in the dietary control group (CON), and 30 steers from
each of treatment groups T, TS and V, were included for
further characterization. Isolates from the treatment
groups were chosen by randomly selecting six of the 10
animal ID numbers from each of the 15 antibiotic-treated
pens. Then, from the archived collections from each of
the five sampling days, isolates from only those six steers
were selected for further study. In this manner, a total of
531 E. coli isolates were identified for the analyses presented in this paper (Table 1). These comprised 55, 361
and 115 isolates selected initially on M C , M T and M A
media respectively, of which 94, 99, 155, and 183 were
obtained on sampling days B, C, D, and E, respectively.

Fecal sampling

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Fecal samples were obtained by rectal swab of each steer
on 11 occasions [12] throughout the feeding period.
This paper presents analysis of isolates collected on 5 of
the 11 sampling days. The four samplings (Figure 1)
were chosen to represent the five phases in the feeding
trial: (i) during their first exposure (while being fed
silage-based diet); (ii) during the first period of withdrawal of antibiotics (while being fed silage-based diet); (iii)
during the second exposure to antibiotics (while fed
grain-based diet); and (iv) following the second withdrawal (while fed grain-based diet). These sample days
were designated B, C, D and E, respectively.

Using the agar dilution method according to National
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines [16], each isolate was tested for susceptibility
to 11 antimicrobials (concentrations, μg/ml): amikacin
(AMI; 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64), ampicillin (AMP; 1, 2,
4, 8, 16, 32), ceftriaxone (AXO; 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,
64), cefoxitin (FOX; 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32), cephalothin
(CL; 2, 4, 8, 16, 32), chloramphenicol (CHL; 2, 4, 8, 16,
32), gentamicin (GEN; 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16), nalidixic
acid (NAL; 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32), streptomycin (STR;
32, 64), sulfamethoxazole (SMX; 32, 64, 128, 256, 512),
and tetracycline (TE; 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32). Escherichia coli
ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853,
Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Staphylococcus
aureus ATCC 29213 were included in the panels as controls. Determination of antimicrobial resistance breakpoints for E. coli was in accordance with CLSI
guidelines [17] except for streptomycin, for which a
breakpoint of 64 μg/ml was used according to [18].
These data were used to generate a resistance antibiogram (ABG) for each isolate.

antibiotics described below were mixed daily into 5 kg
of supplement and spread manually (top-dressed) over
the feed for each pen immediately after its delivery into
the feed bunk.
Experimental treatments

Screening for AMR E. coli

On each collection day, fecal swabs were transported to
the laboratory in brain heart infusion broth (Becton
Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA) containing 20% glycerol
(v/v). Fecal slurry from each steer was plated onto five
media (one non-selective and four amended with antibiotics) as described by [12]. Colonies selected from
those plates were confirmed as E. coli using biochemical

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis

Restriction (XbaI) digested DNA from each isolate was
subjected to PFGE according to the PulseNet USA protocol developed for E. coli O157:H7 [19] modified as
described previously [18]. PFGE banding patterns were
analyzed using BioNumerics software program version
2.5 (Applied-Maths, Ghent, Belgium). DNA fragments
on each gel were normalized using the Salmonella enterica serovar Braenderup “Universal Marker” as a molecular weight standard. Fingerprints were clustered into
groups using Dice coefficient and evaluated by the
unweighted-pair group method. All isolates in a single
cluster (≥ 90% homology) were considered to be from a
similar source and genetically related, as previously
described [20] and Tenover et al., 1995 F.C. Tenover, R.

(4225)[21] and were assigned an arbitrary classification
letter to enable temporal and phenotypic trends to be
evaluated.
Multiplex PCR for tetracycline- and ampicillin-resistant
isolates

From each cluster in which the PFGE patterns and ABG
were identical among member isolates, a single isolate
was randomly selected for characterization of tetracycline- and b-lactamase resistance determinants. Isolates
not grouped in a cluster, and those that grouped into

clusters containing isolates with differing ABG patterns,
were also subjected to molecular characterization of
resistance determinants. Resistance determinates were
chosen based on upon genes that have been commly
reported in E. coli [22] including genes tet(A), tet(B), tet
(C) and others that are not commonly detected among
E. coli including [23,24]tet(D), tet(E), tet(G), tet(K), tet
(L), tet(M), tet(O), tet(S), tet(Q), tet(X), and tetA(P); and
the ampicillin-resistant E. coli were screened for the blactamase genes oxa1-like, pse-1, and tem1-like. The tetracycline genes were grouped as described by [25] into
Group I: tet(B), tet(C), tet(D); Group II: tet(A), tet(E), tet
(G); Group III: tet(K), tet(L), tet(M), tet(O), tet(S); and
Group IV: tet A(P), tet(Q), tet(X). Primer pairs were
selected from previously published sources [25-29] and
the expected amplicon sizes are listed in Table 2.
For PCR amplifications, bacterial cells from a single
colony were collected using a sterile toothpick and
resuspended in 25 μl of sterile deionized water. Amplifications were carried out in a Dyad PCR system (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) as
described by [18]. PCR mixture (total 25 μl) included 1
μl of DNA template, 1 × PCR buffer (Invitrogen), 2.5 U
Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) 300 μM of dNTP
(Invitrogen) and sterile deionized water. Primers and
MgCl2 concentrations for the tetracycline group were
optimized as described by [25]; for the ampicillin group,
pse-1 (1.0 μM), oxa1-like (1.0 μM), tem1-like (1.0 μM),
and 3.0 mM MgCl 2 were used. For the tetracycline
group, PCR conditions were: 5 min denaturing at 94°C;
28 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 59.5°C for 1 min and 72°C
for 1.5 min; final extension 5 min at 72°C. For the

Statistical analysis

The GENMOD procedure (SAS Institute Inc. 2008) was
used to perform a log-linear analysis separately for each
medium to evaluate differences among recovered isolates for antimicrobial resistance phenotypes, treatments
and their interaction. P values ≤ 0.05 were interpreted
as indicative of a significant difference.
PFGE patterns were either classified as unique or
grouped into clusters based on ≥ 90% homology using
Dice similarity coefficients using unweighted pair group
methods with arithmetic average algorithms built into
Bionumerics. The position tolerance and optimization
were set at 1% and 0.5% respectively.

among isolates from groups V (13.0%), CON (6.3%) and
T (2.7%).
Population selected on MA plates

As expected, given that the concentration of ampicillin
in the selection medium was above the breakpoint level,
resistance to AMP was confirmed in all of MA isolates
(Table 4). Isolates exhibiting resistance to TE, CL and
STR were obtained from cattle fed all diets. Resistance
to TE phenotype was higher (p <0.001) in MA isolates
from TS (94.1%) as compared to T (76.9%) and V
(56.0%) and CON (38.5%) steers (Table 4). In the MA
isolates from CON, resistance to CL was most common,
and its prevalence (61.5%) was notably higher (p =
0.007) than was observed in the T (15.4%), TS (5.9%) or

Antibiogram patterns

Forty-five of 55 isolates (81.8%) from non-selective medium M C were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested.
Phenotypes observed in the M C isolates expressing
AMR included resistance to SMX (7/10 isolates), STR
(5/10), CHL (2/80), TE (2/10) and CL (1/10). Six of the
10 isolates obtained exhibited multi-drug resistance.

Irrespective of the CON or antibiotic treatment administered, the majority of isolates, particularly those from
M A medium, were resistant to multiple antibiotics.

Populations selected on M plates

Resistance to TE at the breakpoint level was nearly ubiquitous (>98.8%) among the isolates from the MT plates
(Table 3). Isolates from MT plates exhibiting AMP, STR,
SMX and TE were recovered from animals across all
three treatments. A treatment × phenotype interaction
(p = 0.003) was observed with an increased number of
isolates (p = 0.014) exhibiting resistance to SMX in TS
group (55.1%) as compared to other groups (Table 3).
Resistance to STR was higher (p = 0.018) among CON
(52.3%) and V (50.7%) groups as compared to T (35.1%)
and TS (32.7%) treatments (Table 3). Resistance of MT
isolates to AMP was highest (p = 0.017) in isolates
recovered from TS (18.7%) and was less common

treatments, M T isolates with the STRSMXTE pattern
were obtained primarily on sampling day D (in 22 CON
isolates, and 12 from group V). In a similar fashion, the
STRTE pattern was detected in MT isolates primarily on
sampling day E (n = 18 and n = 17 in CON and V,
respectively). The STRTE ABG pattern was not found in

the CON isolates from pens 1 or 4, but STRTE isolates
were recovered from all 5 pens in group V. From the V
steers, 10 of 18 MT isolates from pen 2 exhibited the TE
pattern. Four M T isolates with pattern AMPSMXTE
were obtained from V steers in pen 1, whereas among
isolates from CON steers, this pattern was identified

Mirzaagha et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:78
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/78

only once (steer 48, day C). Antibiogram AMPSTRTE
was identified in isolates from 5 CON steers in pen 3
on day C. The SMXTE phenotype was observed more
commonly in CON isolates than in those from group V,
notably in those collected in pen 1, where 8 of 18 isolates obtained exhibited SMXTE.
The TE phenotype accounted for 17 of 22 isolates
collected from steers fed T during the growing phase
(silage-based diet; days B and C), compared with only
15 of 52 isolates collected during grain feeding (days D
and E). During that period, observation of SMXTE (12/
52) and STRSMXTE (17/52) in MT isolates from group
T was more frequent than it had been earlier (3
SMXTE and 2 STRSMXTE isolates from group T on
days B and C). The SMXTE pattern was recovered
mainly from pen 3, whereas MT isolates with pattern
STRSMXTE were more widely distributed across pens,
particularly on day D.
The ABG patterns of MT isolates from TS steers early
in the feeding period (sampling days B and C) differed
from isolates collected later (Figure 2). For example, the
AMPCHLSMXTE pattern was observed on days B (n =
7) and C (n = 5), but not on days D or E. In contrast,
few isolates with the SMXTE pattern were obtained
from TS steers on sampling days B (n = 3) and C (n =
4). By sampling day D, however, this ABG was predominant among TS isolates (n = 17) in all pens except pen
1. Also in the TS group, MT isolates with ABG pattern
STRTE were obtained more frequently on later (grainbased diet) sampling days (D; n = 4 (all in pen 1) and E;
n = 7) as compared to isolates collected earlier, during
feeding of silage-based diet (0 and 2 isolates from days
B and C, respectively, exhibited STRTE). Isolates exhibiting the STRSMXTE antibiogram were widely distributed among M T isolates, as were those with the TE
phenotype.
Population selected on MA

Two ABG types (AMPCL and AMPSTRTE) were
observed in MA isolates collected from CON steers, and
these tended to cluster with sampling day and pen of
origin (Figure 2). On day C, AMPSTRTE was predominant, observed in 6 of 8 isolates expressing AMR, all in
pen 3. On this sampling day, the two AMR isolates
from pen 4 had AMPCL phenotype. On day E,
AMPSTRTE isolates were also recovered from adjacent
pens 2 and 4, but AMPCL pattern was predominant,
both in pen 2 (4 of 5 AMR isolates) and particularly in
pen 5 (10 of 10).
From steers in group T, MA E. coli isolates were relatively uncommon, with the majority (10/13) occurring
only on day E (Figure 2). In this group, ABG patterns
were distinctly associated with specific pens. Phenotypes
AMPSTRTE, AMPCHLSMXTE, and AMPTE (each n =
3) were exclusive to pens 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

Page 9 of 15

More MA isolates were associated with steers in group
TS than with CON, T or V (Table 1; Figure 2), and the
TS isolates were more routinely recovered across all
sampling days, whereas in the other groups, isolation
was more frequent later in the feeding period (days D,
E) compared with the growing phase (days B, C). As
with the CON isolates, sampling time and pen of origin
influenced the likelihood with which MA isolates with a
specific ABG were observed. The AMPCHLSMXTE
phenotype was most common (23 of 51 isolates) in the
TS group. It was observed primarily on the earlier sampling days (19/23 on days B and C), and exclusively in
pens 2, 4 and 5 on day B. Late in the feeding period
(grain-based diet; day E), phenotype AMPTE was prevalent (in 11 of 15 isolates from that day, clustered mainly
in pens 3 and 5).
The ABG patterns characterized from the MA isolates
from V steers was also dependent on the sampling time
as well as the pen (Figure 3). For example, with the
exception of steer 117 in treatment T, sampling B, MA
isolates with ABG pattern AMP were obtained exclusively during sampling E from five V steers in pen 5
(Figure 3). Similarly, M A isolates with ABG pattern
AMPCHL were isolated exclusively at sampling E from
two V steers housed in pen 1, and 8 isolates with ABG
pattern AMPSTRTE were isolated at sampling E from
steers in adjacent pens 1 and 2. Finally from the V
group, MA isolates with ABG pattern AMPSMXTE were
obtained only from pen 1 during sampling B, C and D.
PFGE types

A large number of PFGE genotypes were detected from
throughout the feedlot, in all treatments. Many of these
genotypes were isolated only transiently during the feeding period. The MT-selected isolates in groups CON, T,
TS and V presented 46, 37 35 and 34 PFGE genotypes.
Among the MA isolates from CON, T, TS, V samples, 8,
7, 7, and 11 PFGE genotypes, respectively, were
identified.
Population selected on MT

Unlike the MA isolates, many of the M T isolates with
the same ABG exhibited two or more different PFGE
profiles (Figure 2). For example, from CON, the TE isolates exhibited 19 different PFGE banding patterns, with
two predominant patterns that were associated with
pens 1 and 4. Isolates with ABG patterns STRSMXTE
and STRTE obtained from CON steers also frequently
exhibited different PFGE types. Of note, although the
PFGE genotypes of STRSMXTE isolates in pens 3 and 4
clearly differed between pens, within pen, the majority
of these isolates (9/11 in pen 3 and 6/7 in pen 4) were
clones. All of the AMPSTRTE isolates from CON steers,
with the exception of one isolate from pen 2, were associated with pen 3 and possessed indistinguishable PFGE

Mirzaagha et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:78
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/78

patterns. Clonal isolates with the STRTE phenotype
were also obtained from CON steers in pens 2, 3 and 5
during later samplings, but STRTE E. coli exhibiting different PFGE profiles were also present in pen 2 and pen
3.
In group T, MT isolates with the TE phenotype exhibited 16 different PFGE profiles (Figure 2), though within
a pen, these isolates often exhibited the same PFGE profile (e.g., 7 of 12 TE isolates in pen 2 were indistinguishable, as were 4 of 7 in pen 4). The isolates with SMXTE
phenotype also clustered by pen: 6 of 8 in pen 3 were
indistinguishable, as were all three SMXTE isolates from
pen 4. Throughout the feeding period, the TE isolates
from diet group T tended to exhibit three predominant
PFGE types. As the frequency of isolation of
STRSMXTE isolates increased in the finishing feeding
period, so too did the diversity of their PFGE types. The
two isolates from days B and C (growing period) were
indistinguishable, whereas 10 PFGE patterns were identified among the 17 STRSMXTE isolates from days D
and E (finishing period).
In the TS group, the SMXTE ABG occurred frequently in all pens except pen 1 and was represented by
10 different PFGE profiles across pens (Figure 2) and all
10 were recovered on day D. Overall, the SMXTE isolates exhibited three main PFGE profiles. Similarly, the
TS isolates with STRSMXTE phenotype were associated
with 11 PFGE types, with diversity evident particularly
in pen 1. A PFGE profile (J) that was also identified in
TE isolates from diet group T, was the predominant
PFGE type among the TE isolates from diet group TS,
identified in 14 of the 25 isolates with that phenotype.
These indistinguishable isolates were associated primarily with pens 2 and 5, and were not recovered from pen
3. The STRTE isolates from pens 1 and 3 (and the sole
STRTE isolate in pen 2) were indistinguishable, whereas
this phenotype was not observed in pen 5, and the four
STRTE isolates in pen 4 exhibited different PFGE profiles. All 12 MT isolates with AMPCHLSMXTE phenotype, clustered in pens 2, 4 and 5, exhibited
indistinguishable PFGE profiles.
Population selected on MA

Among the M A isolates, most that exhibited a given
ABG pattern also presented indistinguishable PFGE profiles (Figure 3). In the CON group, 14 of the 16 AMPCL
isolates, collected from pens 2 and 5, had indistinguishable PFGE profiles. Similarly, 6 of the 10 AMPSTRTE
MA isolates from CON cattle were clones and associated
only with pen 3.
As with the AMPCHLSMXTE isolates from MT, the
MA isolates displaying this phenotype were all found to
possess indistinguishable PFGE profiles, and were
obtained primarily from steers on the TS treatment (Figure 3). Steer 99 (pen 5) was the only animal from which

Page 10 of 15

the same AMR clone was recovered on all four sampling
days. The AMPTE isolates from group TS exhibited two
distinct PFGE profiles - a predominant type recovered
in pens 3, 4 and 5, and the second type from pen 1 with
the exception of one isolate in pen 5. The phenotype
AMPSTRTE was associated with only a single PFGE
profile, and only in pens 3 and 4 on day C.
The PFGE profiles of AMPSTRTE and
AMPCHLSMXTE isolates recovered from group T
steers on day E were indistinguishable from those determined in the TS group, but the AMPTE isolates (3
clones in pen 3) exhibited a distinct PFGE to that of the
AMPTE isolates from TS.
Similarly, associations of single PFGE profiles with
specific ABG patterns were found among most of the
MA isolates from diet group V, and mainly on day E. All
of the AMP isolates obtained from steers in pen 5 were
clones, as were 4 of the 5 AMPSTRTE isolates from pen
2, and 3 of 3 in pen 1. All five AMPSMXTE isolates
from pen 1 (across three sampling days) exhibited indistinguishable PFGE profiles.
Multiplex PCR

Tetracycline genes only from Group I [tet (B), tet (C),
tet (D)] and Group II [tet (A), tet (E), tet (G)] were identified, with no genes from Group III [tet (K), tet (L), tet
(M), tet (O), tet (S)] or Group IV [tet A (P), tet (Q), tet
(X)] being detected in any of the isolates examined. The
tet(B) gene was the most commonly observed of the tetracycline resistance determinants, present in 58.2%,
53.5%, 40.8% and 50.6% of MT isolates from CON, T,
TS, and V steers, respectively. The tet(A) determinant
was detected in 22.5%, 51.4% and 26.0% of the isolates
from T, TS and V, respectively, but was present in only
12.2% of the isolates from CON. Determinant tet(C) was
also present at low frequencies, detected in 7.1, 12.7, 2.1
and 13.0% of MT isolates from groups CON, T, TS and
V, respectively. A small proportion of the isolates examined, 20.4, 5.6 and 2.6% from CON, T and V, respectively, did not possess any of the tetracycline
determinants screened for. Few isolates possessed multiple tetracycline resistance determinants. The tet(A) and
tet(B) genes were present together in only 0.7% of the
isolates from the TS group, and 0.8% of the isolates
from CON. Combinations of tet(B) and tet(C) were
detected in 2.0, 5.6, 4.9 and 6.5% of the M T isolates
from CON, T, TS and V. The tet(A) and tet (C) were
detected in combination in only 1.3% of M T isolates
from steers in group V.
Ampicillin-resistant isolates from all treatment groups
were subjected to multiplex PCR to ascertain the presence of blaPSE-1, blaOXA1 and blaTEM-1 determinants.
The bla TEM-1 determinant was present in 50.0, 66.7,
80.3 and 100% of MA isolates from the CON, T, TS and

Mirzaagha et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:78
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/78

V groups, respectively. The other ampicillin resistance
determinants that were screened were not detected in
54.4% of the other MA isolates.

Discussion
Chlortetracycline alone and combined administration of
chlortetracycline and sulfamethazine were selected as
experimental treatments on the basis of their routine
use in the Canadian feedlot industry. These antimicrobials are used to improve feed efficiency and prevent
foot rot, liver abscesses and respiratory disease. Virginiamycin was included in the study as an antibiotic to
which neither the steers nor their dams would have had
prior exposure, given that it is not registered for use in
cattle in Canada.
Resistance to amikacin, ceftriaxone (64 μg/ml), cefoxitin or nalidixic acid was not detected in any of the 531
E. coli isolates examined. Other researchers of E. coli
from Canadian beef cattle have also reported the
absence of resistance to these antibiotics [30] or, when
resistance to nalidixic acid was found, it occurred in
fewer than 2% of isolates studied [31]. In the present
study, the absence of resistance to these antibiotics in
gut flora may be related to sole-source acquisition of
the calves, and to the complete absence of antibiotic use
prior to their arrival at the feedlot. Furthermore, our
research feedlot had been constructed just prior to commencement of this experiment, thus there was no history of prior administration of subtherapeutic antibiotics
at this site. Our results and those of others [30,31] contrast with those of Hoyle et al. [32], who reported that
all calves from a Scottish beef farm were found to shed
nalidixic acid-resistant E. coli at least once during a 21wk study.
Comparisons of AMR E. coli from steers in CON vs.
T, TS and V groups suggests that subtherapeutic administration of these antimicrobials had only a limited
impact on the nature of antimicrobial resistance in E.
coli resident in these cattle. The resistances observed
most commonly among these E. coli isolates were to tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, chloramphenicol
and streptomycin, which is consistent with the findings
of other Canadian beef researchers [30,31,33].
In general, the antibiogram type and temporal point of
isolation were more similar between isolates from CON
and V groups than from those in T or TS. Virginiamycin, a streptogramin, that primarily targets Gram-positive bacteria [34], and appears to have had minimal
influence on the nature of AMR in the non-target E.
coli isolates obtained in this study. Similarly, dietary
inclusion of monensin, another antibiotic that targets
Gram-positive bacteria, also did not alter the nature of
AMR E. coli isolated from beef cattle [35]. These results
suggest that antimicrobial suppression of Gram-positive

Page 11 of 15

bacteria does not give rise to unoccupied microbial
niches that are filled via AMR E. coli.
Despite the fact that the E. coli characterized in this
study were recovered from selective media, the fact that
antibiotic resistance, particularly to tetracycline, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole and ampicllin, was common in
E. coli from cattle that were not administered tetracycline suggests that naturally occurring resistance determinants circulate in bovine gut microbial populations
for reasons other than selection as a result of antimicrobial agents being included in the diet. Hoyle et al. [36]
characterized bovine fecal E. coli from an organic farm
and found that even with the restricted use of antimicrobials, ampicillin-resistant E. coli were readily isolated.
In that study, age of the cattle and likely the diet they
were provided, as opposed to subtherapeutic administration of antibiotics appeared to be an important factor
for the acquisition and development of antibiotic-resistant commensal microflora. A higher prevalence of
AMR E. coli in feces from younger than older animals
within the same farm has been previously reported
[37,38]. A comprehensive longitudinal study of four feedlots in which antibiotics were only used therapeutically
also found no difference in the nature of AMR among
isolates collected from home pens compared with those
from hospital pens in which antibiotics were administered [39]. Our work as well as that of others has also
observed that the presence and dissemination of AMR
in E. coli during the feeding period may be a response
to the diet rather than antimicrobial administration
[12,18,40]. In the present study, short-term withdrawal
of antibiotics appeared to have minimal impact on AMR
in E. coli, given that AMR isolates were collected routinely on days C and E. Perhaps this is not surprising
when one considers that even long term withdrawal of
antimicrobials has in some cases had minimal impact on
the nature of antimicrobial resistance [41]. In the case of
genetic determinants for tetracycline resistance, it has
been proposed that these elements have established a
steady state in E. coli populations, and that their presence is not necessarily related to antimicrobial usage
[22].
Perhaps the most obvious impact of antimicrobial
administration on the phenotype and genotype of E. coli
was observed for isolates obtained from TS fed cattle, a
response that may reflect the fact that two antimicrobials were administered to these animals. The MT isolates from the TS group exhibited a higher frequency of
SMX resistance and as both sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) are sulfonamides, this may reflect
selection for strains resistant to SMX. Sharma et al. [20]
recently reported similarities in the numbers of ampicillin-resistant and tetracycline-resistant isolates, as well as
the types of resistance phenotypes observed, in E. coli

Mirzaagha et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:78
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/78

collected from cattle fed chlortetracycline (44 ppm)
alone or in combination with sulfamethazine at the
same concentration. These results suggest that the
administration of chlortetracycline, even in the absence
of sulfamethazine, can lead to the emergence of resistance to SMX, as well as other antibiotics, including
AMP and CHL.
E. coli exhibiting STRSMXTE and SMXTE resistance
phenotypes have been frequently isolated from cattle
[42]. Enne et al. [43] documented that the prevalence of
sulfonamide resistance among E. coli remained constant
even with a 97% reduction in the clinical use of sulfonamides in the UK. Further work showed that a plasmid
carrying the resistance determinants sul2, strA and strB
enhanced host fitness even in the absence of antibiotic
selective pressure [44]. Linkages between CHL and TE
phenotypes, sulphonamide resistance, and other resistance determinants have been described in plasmid profiling of human clinical isolates in Australia [45], but at
this point it remains to be determined if similar linkages
are responsible for the linked dissemination of these
resistances in feedlot cattle. It is also possible that genes
that confer fitness to environmental challenges (e.g.,
acid tolerance, nutrient limitations, metal concentration)
other than those imposed by antibiotics are harboured
on these plasmids and promote the acquisition of resistance determinants [46].
Detection of specific AMR E. coli frequently appeared
to be transient over the duration of this study. Only in
one steer (ID 99; group TS) was the same
AMPCHLSMXTE E. coli clone obtained on all 4 sampling days. Others have also reported that the majority
of E. coli O157:H7 subtypes occur intermittently within
cattle and that few isolates persist for extended periods
of time [47]. Although isolates occurred transiently,
there were instances where a particular isolate clearly
occurred more frequently during specific phases of the
feeding period. For example, E. coli isolates exhibiting
STRTE phenotype were recovered almost exclusively on
days D and E, particularly from CON, TS and V steers,
and the majority of isolates were clones. This suggests
that this particular isolate disseminated readily among
pen mates within the feedlot or that this particular
clone may have possessed fitness attributes that promoted its prevalence at these points during the feeding
period.
In some instances, the occurrence of clones was
clearly pen-associated. Some MT-isolated E. coli clones
with specific PFGE profiles occurred exclusively or
nearly exclusively within a single pen (e.g., STRSMXTE
with PFGE type X in pen V-1). This same phenomenon
was also observed for E. coli isolates with ampicillin
resistance, i.e., cultured on MA (e.g., AMP with PFGE
type F, pen V-5). The association of isolates with

Page 12 of 15

specific pens was not solely related to the administration
of antibiotics, given that some pen associations were evident in the CON group as well (AMPSTRTE with PFGE
type YY in pen CON-3; STRSMXTE with PFGE type W
in pen CON-4). These findings suggest that the degree
of transference of AMR E. coli in the feedlot depends
on the subtype in question. A previous study in or
laboratory used genotyping to document movement of
E. coli strains from animal to animal within the feedlot
environment [20]. Others have reported that housing
location can influence the nature of antimicrobial resistance in fecal coliforms from swine [48], but in that
study, the pigs were housed in different barns as
opposed to different pens within a common building.
We determined previously that a rifampin-resistant
strain of E. coli was transferred infrequently among feedlot cattle housed in adjacent pens even when it was
inoculated (10 10 CFU) into Trojan steers [49]. In the
present study, there was possible evidence of transmission of ampicllin-resistant E. coli among adjacent pens
as identical AMPTE subtypes were recovered from TS
steers in pens 3, 4, and 5 sampled on day E. Similarly,
identical AMPSTRTE subtypes were obtained from V
steers in adjacent pens 1 and 2 during this same sampling period. Our results suggest that the pen boundaries act as a significant impediment to the widespread
dissemination of some AMR E. coli subtypes within the
feedlot. At this point it is not known if a similar phenomenon would be observed in all feedlots as our feedlot only represented a single ecological unit.
Resource constraints limited our characterizations to
only single isolate from each selective plate from each
steer during later samplings. It further restricted our
ability to study isolates from all steers on all treatments
It is possible that this approach may not have given a
complete picture of the genetic diversity of tetracyclineand ampicillin-resistant E. coli present in feedlot steers.
Ensuring representative sampling is always a challenge
considering the voluminous nature of digesta within the
bovine intestinal tract and the number of cattle that are
typically housed within a feedlot. Others have reported
that examining single vs multiple isolates did not compromise interpretation of the temporal trends or the
nature of diversity of E. coli within cohorts [50,51]. In
early samples, where we did select two isolates, PFGE
frequently identified both isolates as clones. That finding
is perhaps not surprising, given the frequency with
which we isolated clones from individual pen mates.
This pattern may have been amplified by the use of
selective plates for establishing the isolate collections, a
practice that obviously selects for less diverse subpopulations. In the present study, the degree of diversity was
clearly related to the nature of the resistant phenotype.
Some phenotypes such as TE, SMXTE and STRSMXTE

Mirzaagha et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:78
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/78

exhibited a high degree of diversity whereas others, such
as AMPCHLSMXTE were solely of a clonal nature suggesting the resistance genes may be chromosomally
encoded while others may be plasmid mediated both of
which could contribute to the varying degrees of diversity among isolates examined.
Screening for resistance determinants showed that
the majority of tetracycline-resistant isolates harboured the tet(B) efflux gene, followed less frequently
by tet(A) and tet(C). These findings are consistent
with those of Walk et al. [22] who reported that
64.8%, 28.1 and 4.6 of tetracycline-resistant isolates
from conventional and organic dairies possessed tet
(B), tet(A) and tet(C) determinants. The prevalence of
tet efflux genes in E. coli is likely related to their
occurrence on mobile conjugative plasmids and transposons, although tet(B) has recently been reported
also to integrate into chromosomal DNA [52]. Tet(B)
has been reported in a variety of other Gram-negative
bacteria, including Enterobacter, Proteus, Salmonella,
Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, Morazella and Treponema spp. This distribution is thought to reflect frequent gene transfer [52]. In the present study, isolates
from M T were screened for other efflux, ribosomal
protection, and tetracycline catabolism determinants
that included tet(K), tet(L), tet(M), tet(O), tet(S), tetA
(P), tet(Q), and tet(X). This group of tet genes are
normally present on mobile conjugative plasmids or
chromosomally located in Gram-positive bacteria [23],
but there has been reports of their transfer to phylogenetically distant bacteria, as tet(K) and tet(L) have
been reported in Gram-negative bacteria [24]. Our
screening failed to detect these genes, and to our
knowledge, there have been no reports of these determinants occurring in E. coli.
During screening of the ampicillin-resistant isolates
for three b-lactamase genes the blaTEM1 determinant
was detected in 50 to 100% of isolates from the four
treatment groups. Amplicons for bla OXA1 or bla PSE1
were not produced in any of the remaining MA isolates.
Other research teams have also failed to detect blaOXA1,
blaSHV and blaPSE1 in ampicillin-resistant E. coli isolates
recovered from cattle [20,22]. We are presently in the
process of screening for additional b-lactamase determinants in ampicillin-resistant E. coli isolates that were
not equated with bla TEM1. A close association of blaTEM1 with class I integrons has been reported, which
likely accounts for the wide dissemination of this determinant among Gram-negative bacteria [53]. Others in
Denmark and Spain also found blaTEM1 to be the most
common determinant observed in ampicillin-resistant
E. coli of animal origin, with bla OXA1 detected only
occasionally [53,54].

Conclusions
AMR bacteria are clearly able to persist in the bovine
gut in the absence of antimicrobial selection pressure,
evidenced by ready isolation of tetracycline- and ampicllin-resistant E. coli from steers that were not fed antibiotics. This study and previous reports suggest that the
occurrence of AMR in commensal E. coli harboured by
calves is complex, and dependent on multiple factors.
Sampling time seemed to affect the presence of certain
isolates, which is likely reflecting the transient nature of
shedding of specific strains of E. coli by cattle. In addition, commonality was higher among isolates obtained
from cattle within a pen than between pens, suggesting
that animal-to-animal contact plays an important role in
the dissemination of AMR bacteria within the feedlot.
Feeding a mixture of subtherapeutic antibiotics, in this
case tetracycline and sulfamethazine seemed to have a
more pronounced impact on the occurrence and persistence of antimicrobial resistance than feeding a single or
no antibiotics to cattle. Resistance to SMX and CHL
was increased in isolates from the treatment group
receiving chlortetracycline and sulfamethazine, which
may have arisen from the inclusion of this sulfonamide
in the diet. This treatment also appeared to be associated with increased isolation of ampicillin-resistant E.
coli. Our findings suggest that a more comprehensive
understanding of the development and emergence of
AMR in feedlots requires that other factors in addition
to administration of antimicrobials be taken into
consideration.
