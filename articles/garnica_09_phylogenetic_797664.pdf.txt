Abstract
Background: Section Calochroi is one of the most species-rich lineages in the genus Cortinarius (Agaricales,
Basidiomycota) and is widely distributed across boreo-nemoral areas, with some extensions into meridional
zones. Previous phylogenetic studies of Calochroi (incl. section Fulvi) have been geographically restricted; therefore,
phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships within this lineage at a global scale have been largely unknown. In
this study, we obtained DNA sequences from a nearly complete taxon sampling of known species from Europe,
Central America and North America. We inferred intra- and interspecific phylogenetic relationships as well as
major morphological evolutionary trends within section Calochroi based on 576 ITS sequences, 230 ITS + 5.8S +
D1/D2 sequences, and a combined dataset of ITS + 5.8S + D1/D2 and RPB1 sequences of a representative
subsampling of 58 species.
Results: More than 100 species were identified by integrating DNA sequences with morphological,
macrochemical and ecological data. Cortinarius section Calochroi was consistently resolved with high branch
support into at least seven major lineages: Calochroi, Caroviolacei, Dibaphi, Elegantiores, Napi, Pseudoglaucopodes and
Splendentes; whereas Rufoolivacei and Sulfurini appeared polyphyletic. A close relationship between Dibaphi,
Elegantiores, Napi and Splendentes was consistently supported. Combinations of specific morphological,
pigmentation and molecular characters appear useful in circumscribing clades.
Conclusion: Our analyses demonstrate that Calochroi is an exclusively northern hemispheric lineage, where
species follow their host trees throughout their natural ranges within and across continents. Results of this study
contribute substantially to defining European species in this group and will help to either identify or to name new
species occurring across the northern hemisphere. Major groupings are in partial agreement with earlier
morphology-based and molecular phylogenetic hypotheses, but some relationships were unexpected, based on
external morphology. In such cases, their true affinities appear to have been obscured by the repeated appearance
of similar features among distantly related species. Therefore, further taxonomic studies are needed to evaluate
the consistency of species concepts and interpretations of morphological features in a more global context.
Reconstruction of ancestral states yielded two major evolutionary trends within section Calochroi: (1) the
development of bright pigments evolved independently multiple times, and (2) the evolution of abruptly marginate
to flattened stipe bulbs represents an autapomorphy of the Calochroi clade.

Background
Calochroi is one of the most diverse lineages within the
Cortinarius radiation, with estimates of between 90 and
170 species recognised so far from Europe [1], which
probably represents only a portion of the taxa on a global
scale. All members of this section are obligate root symbionts (ectomycorrhizal); therefore, the presence of appropriate plant hosts as well as specific edaphic factors play a
crucial role in their geographical distributions. In general,
the highest interspecific diversity roughly matches the distribution of coniferous (Abies, Picea) and broadleaf (Fagus,
Quercus, Lithocarpus) trees across boreo-nemoral areas.
Often, shared ecological specialisations makes it possible
to find basidiomes of different species associated with an
individual host tree on the same site. Section Calochroi, as
circumscribed here, comprises species producing conspicuous basidiomes with a rounded to adruptly bulbous
stipe base, a pileus with a well-developed gelatinous layer,
and the presence of pigments which often change colour
with the application of KOH. Most species produce basidiomes after the first autumn rains; however, in North
America, certain species with a persistent veil, short stipe
and subemerged basidiomes occur in spring. In oak forests of Costa Rica, a number of species occur during the
rainy season in June, and sometimes later in the season as
well. Traditionally, species concepts have been largely
based on macromorphological traits, colour changes with
KOH on the basidiomes (usually the pileus, and the stipe
surface and flesh), and ecological specialisations [2-5].
However, some of these traits are heavily labile and/or
affected by homoplasy, and as a result, the taxonomy of
this group is extremely difficult, and much controversy
exists in the delimitation and recognition of species.
Because of their abundance in many forest ecosystems,
and the spectacular appearance and colouration of the
basidiomes, calochroid species have been the focus of
numerous taxonomic studies [see, for example [2-6]], as
well as the chemical structures of their pigments [7-11].
Most recently, considerable progress has been made in
reconstructing phylogenetic relationships among European calochroid species through analyses of morphological features and DNA sequences. Peintner et al. [12]
studied the phylogeny of sequestrate taxa related to Cortinarius based on ITS sequences and distinguished a wellsupported lineage named Phlegmacium IV containing a
small number of European and North American calochroid species. Garnica et al. [13] analysed the phylogenetic relationships of 54 European Phlegmacium species
using ITS and D1/D2 sequences of the nuclear gene coding for the ribosomal large subunit (nucLSU rDNA) and
found that members of the section Calochroi are distributed into two closely related lineages that can be assigned
to Calochroi and Fulvi. Peintner et al. [14] and Garnica et
al. [15] used a more extensive sampling of taxa across the
genus Cortinarius and supported the monophyly of Calochroi. At least five subclades were distinguished by Peint-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/1

ner et al. [15]. Frøslev et al. [16] used 54 European
phlegmacioid taxa and compared phylogenies resulting
from RPB1, RPB2 and ITS data as single and combined
data sets, and accepted three subclades named /Calochroid,
/Rufoolivacei and /Fulvi. These authors showed that certain
morphological features, such as a pileipellis structure
(pileipellis simplex), a very broad marginate bulbous stipe
base and coarse, net-like basidiospore ornamentation
have evolved independently several times within the
genus Cortinarius. Frøslev et al. [1] evaluated species
delimitations using a total of 421 ITS sequences (including sequences from 53 type specimens) and recognised /
Arcuatorum, /Calochroid, /Fulvi, /Rufoolivacei and /Sulfurinus as major subclades within section Calochroi in Europe.
In several cases, these authors found that sequences
obtained from collections of the same species from different geographical areas showed very little variation. Nevertheless, little is known about intra- and interspecific
patterns of distribution and phylogenetic relationships
within section Calochroi at a global scale. Morphologybased taxonomic studies have recorded Cortinarius species
displaying calochroid and fulvoid features from several
coniferous and frondose forests in North America [17,18]
and Nothofagus forests in South America [19,20]. Furthermore, in light of similar morphological features of the
basidiomes some calochroid species have been reported
with European and North American disjunct distribution
patterns [see [21-25]]. Therefore, to gain a more complete
understanding of intra- and interspecific patterns of distribution and phylogenetic relationships at a global scale,
we have attempted to use a more extensive sampling of
calochroid and fulvoid Phlegmacium species, including
European, North American, Tasmanian, New Zealand,
and Central and South American collections.
Here, we present phylogenetic hypotheses including
nearly all of the known species of Calochroi sensu M.M.
Moser using nuclear DNA sequence data from the internal
transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2, including the 5.8S),
the D1/D2 regions of the nucLSU rDNA and from the
gene coding for domains A-C of RPB1 from a representative subsample. We use these phylogenies to address the
following main objectives. First, we compared our own
sequences with available ITS sequences from GenBank
and UNITE databases to establish congruence and uniformity of species concepts for European calochroid species. Second, we estimated intra- and interspecific
sequence divergences of closely related taxa by comparing
the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1, ITS2) alone or
including D1/D2 regions. Third, we inferred phylogenetic
relationships and major morphological evolutionary
trends within the section Calochroi by integrating molecular phylogenetic analyses of single and combined DNA
sequence datasets with morphological, chemical and ecological features. This study provides the first insights into
the geographical structure of species and populations

occurring in parts of Central America, North America and
Europe within a diverse and complex lineage of ectomycorrhizal fungi.

Results
Phylogenetic delimitation of the section Calochroi
The section Calochroi appeared as a well-supported monophyletic clade within the genus Cortinarius in our preliminary neighbor-joining analyses (tree not shown). These
analyses also showed that C. inexpectatus from Europe,
and C. rhodophyllus, C. chlorophanus, C. stephanopus and C.
vaginatus from South America, which are currently classified in Calochroi and Fulvi, cluster outside of the section
Calochroi as conceived here. Thus, all species assignable to
section Calochroi (incl. section Fulvi) in this study are from
the northern hemisphere. A total of 576 sequences including ITS and 5.8S, 230 sequences comprising ITS, 5.8S and
nucLSU D1/D2 rDNA, and 56 RPB1 sequences including
the conserved domains A-C were analysed in three separate datasets: dataset 1 including ITS and 5.8S sequences
(Additional file 1); dataset 2 including ITS, 5.8S and D1/
D2 sequences (Figures 1 and 2); dataset 3 including combined ITS, 5.8S and D1/D2, and RPB1 A-C sequences (Figure 3). The final sampling covered c. 110 species with
geographical distributions across Europe, Central America
and North America.
Intraspecific variation and relationships between closely
related taxa as inferred from ITS-5.8S and ITS-5.8S-D1/D2
sequences
ITS-5.8S sequences
Comparative intraspecific ITS-5.8S sequence analyses
between our collections and those of Frøslev et al. [1,16]
revealed identical sequences in C. albertii, C. arcuatorum,
C. barbaricus, C. cupreorufus, C. elegantior, C. langeorum, C.
meinhardii, C. napus, C. odoratus, C. osmophorus, C. pseudoglaucopus, C. selandicus, C. subgracilis, C. sublilacinopes, C.
sulfurinus and C. olivascentium; whereas, for the remaining
species, an intraspecific genetic variation of up to 6 bp was
observed (Additional file 1). However, it should be noted
that within the same species, GenBank sequences have
deviating sites across relatively conservative portions of
ITS1 and ITS2 regions compared to the sequences
obtained in this study. In general, the species concepts
used in the present work agree with those applied by
Frøslev et al. [1,16] and Peintner et al. [12,14,26] (see
Additional file 1). However, for nomenclatural reasons,
we prefer to use the following names: C. cedretorum var.
cedretorum (= C. cedretorum), C. eufulmineus (= C. quercusilicis), C. majusculus (= C. alcalinophilus), C. alnobetulae (=
C. moseri) and C. olivascentium (= C. xanthochlorus).
ITS-5.8S-D1/D2 sequences
Many collections of the same species from different, but
geographically restricted, localities (i.e. from populations

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/1

in Central America, North America or Europe) shared
identical sequences. Generally, sequence variation within
different collections of the same species was caused by
obvious polymorphic sites and/or single nucleotide
indels distributed mainly across the ITS1 and ITS2
regions. There was a 0.1% sequence divergence between
C. albobrunnoides var. violaceovelatus and C. napus; C. albobrunnoides var. violaceovelatus and C. subpurpureophyllus
var. sulphureovelatus; and between different collections of
C. aureocalceolatus, C. aureofulvus and Cortinarius sp. USA
7. Collections of C. aurantiorufus and C. haasii, C. elotoides
and C. pseudoglaucopus, and C. flavaurora and C. pseudoglaucopus showed a 0.2% sequence divergence. There was a
0.2% sequence divergence within collections of C. dibaphus and C. lilacinovelatus, respectively. New World collections of C. arcuatorum clustered within three distinctive
lineages designated as groups A-C in Figures 1 and 2:
group A comprised the collections JFA 12037, JFA 12039
and JFA 12061 from Costa Rica with identical sequences;
group B included the collection JFA 11893 from Mendocino, California, occupying an isolated position; and group
C was composed of the collections JFA 11765, JFA 11766
and JFA 11803 from the Smith River drainage, Del Norte
County, California, with identical DNA sequences. There
was a 1.6% sequence divergence between group A and B,
while group A and C differed by 1.5%, and group B and C
differed by 2.1%. There were between 34–39 bp differences (approximately 2.5–2.8% sequence divergence)
between New World and European collections of C. arcuatorum. New World and European Elegantiores collections
were distributed into three monophyletic subgroups
labeled as D-F in Figures 1 and 2: group D consists of C.
elegantior var. americanus JFA 11452 from Wyoming with
an isolated position; group E comprises the C. elegantior
collections JFA 12438 from Wyoming and JFA 11693
from Oregon with a sequence divergence of 0.3%; and
group F includes only European collections with identical
sequences. Sequence divergences ranged from 0.2% to
0.5% among the groups F and D, and 0.6% to 0.7%
between the groups D-E and D. Sequences from the following specimens were identical: C. albobrunnoides JFA
12426, C. napus and C. subpurpureophyllus var. sulphureovelatus; C. claroflavus and C. xanthophyllus; C. elotoides (IB
19870060 Holotypus), Cortinarius sp. JFA 11618 and JFA
11619 and C. flavaurora; C. elotus IB 1999/0192 and C.
pseudoglaucopus; and C. olivellus and C. humolens. Collections of C. aurora, C. corrosus (TUB 012705, TUB 012706)
and C. rufoolivaceus differed by single nucleotide indels in
the ITS1 region, the collections TUB 012714 and TUB
012715 of C. haasii differed by a single nucleotide indel in
the ITS2 region. Collections of Cortinarius sp. JFA 11833,
JFA 11845 and C. prasinus had identical sequences and
inclusively shared a polymorphism at the same position
(Y = C/T).

C. dalecarlicus) + RPB1 A-C sequences. Numbers above nodes are ML bootstrap values, numbers below nodes are MP
bootstrap values (values < 50% not shown) from 1000 replicates, respectively. Distributions of basidiome pigments were
retrieved from [7,9,10,64] and are abbreviated as follows. Flavomannin pigments: ATR = atrovirin, FDM = flavomannin-66'dimethylether, 4-OH-FDM = 4-OH-flavomannin-6,6'-dimethylether, FLA = flavomannin, FTM = flavomannin-6,6',8-trimethylether; phlegmacin pigments: LRU = leucorufoolivacins, PHL = phlegmacin, PME B2 = phlegmacin-8'-methylether B2; triterpenoid
pigments: S = sodagnitins A-F. Note that FDM is a common pigment found also in other groups in Cortinarius. A non-coding 8
bp insertion is absent in all species of the Calochroi clade and also in C. elegantissimus and C. rapaceotomentosus, but is present in
the remaining species. The alignment shown includes all species of the Calochroi clade contained in the combined dataset 3
(framed box), and corresponds to positions 769–777 of intron 2 of the RPB1 sequence. Ancestral character states were reconstructed using maximum parsimony (DELTRAN strategy). Green branches indicate taxa of bright colours; taxa with abruptly
marginate to flattened stipe bulbs are indicated by bold lines. Dashed branches indicate taxa where bright basidiome colours or
marginate to flattened stipe bulbs are not continuously present in the populations. C. elegantior and C. humolens photos, credit:

Phylogenetic reconstruction inferred from ITS, 5.8S and
D1/D2 rDNA
Our phylogenetic analyses of dataset 2 (Figures 1 and 2)
supported the monophyly of the clades Calochroi, Caroviolacei, Dibaphi, Elegantiores, Splendentes and Pseudoglaucopodes. ML bootstrap support for the monophyly of Napi,
Rufoolivacei and Sulfurini was below 50%; these groups
appear polyphyletic in the best tree found in heuristic ML
analysis (Figures 1 and 2). Cortinarius spp. USA 8, USA 13
and USA 17, C. aureocalceolatus, C. aureofulvus, C. ionodactylus, C. langeorum, C. natalis, C. osmophorus, C. rapaceotomentosus and C suaveolens could not be assigned to
particular clades. More than 35% of the species analysed
were nested within the Calochroi clade; the remaining taxa
were distributed over various smaller lineages. The partially hypogeous taxa clustered in the clades Calochroi and
Rufoolivacei, respectively.
Phylogenetic relationships inferred from ITS-5.8S-D1/D2
sequences combined with RPB1 domains A-C
Maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony analyses
of dataset 3 revealed at least seven major lineages in the
section Calochroi (Figure 3). The monophyly of Calochroi,
Caroviolacei, Dibaphi, Elegantiores, Napi, Pseudoglaucopodes
and Splendentes was supported in our maximum likelihood sequence analysis. ML and MP bootstrap support for
Rufoolivacei and Sulfurini and MP bootstrap support for
the monophyly of Napi was below 50%. The clades
Dibaphi, Elegantiores, Napi, and Splendentes formed a wellsupported monophyletic group in our maximum likelihood analysis together with C. aureocalceolatus and C.
natalis, which appeared as a sister group to the remaining
taxa of section Calochroi. Cortinarius citrinus, C. langeorum,
C. osmophorus, C. rapaceotomentosus and C. suaveolens had
isolated positions within the section Calochroi in our maximum likelihood analysis. In the maximum parsimony
bootstrap analysis, C. rapaceotomentosus was supported as
a sister taxon to the Calochroi clade with 70%, and C. natalis, C. splendens and C. atrovirens formed a well-supported
clade (95% MP bootstrap).
Reconstruction of ancestral states
Maximum parsimony reconstruction of ancestral states on
the tree with the highest likelihood found for dataset 3
suggests that the bright pigmentation of the basidiomes
and an abruptly marginate to flattened stipe bulb base
evolved independently several times (Figure 3). Our
results indicate that an abruptly marginate to flattened
stipe bulb base is an autapomorphy for the Calochroi
clade. The acquisition of bright flesh pigments appears as
a synapomorphy for Rufoolivacei, Pseudoglaucopodes and
Sulfurini and probably evolved independently in C. citrinus and C. fulvocitrinus as well as in Splendentes and Elegantiores.

Characterisation of macro- and microscopical features
Macroscopical features, including habit, basidiome coloration and veil coloration, macrochemical reactions with
40% KOH (see Figure 4), microscopical features of the
pileipellis structure and hyphal coloration in 3% KOH,
and basidiospore morphology (see Figure 5), are documented and compared for the Calochroi (see Additional
file 2).

Discussion
Although there have been previous molecular phylogenetic studies of Calochroi species [1,13,15,16] the present
study is the first to include an extended, nearly complete
sampling of the known species of this Cortinarius section
across its natural range of distribution in Europe, Central
America and North America (sampling does not include
extensive areas of eastern North America). In general, our
morphological and phylogenetic concepts for European
calochroid species fit with those applied by Frøslev et al.
[1,16] and Peintner et al. [12,14,26] (see Additional file
1). In the majority of cases, the evaluation of ranges in
species variation is based on morphological and molecular data obtained from multiple collections and analysed
with ITS sequences of 37 type specimens. These findings
represent considerable taxonomic progress within a taxonomically complex group, and should make it much easier to either identify specimens or to name new species
occurring across Europe, Central America and North
America.
Phylogenetic analyses of the three final molecular datasets
resulted in congruent and complementary trees (Figures 1,
2) and 3, but backbone resolution was higher in the trees
inferred from the combined dataset 3 (Figure 3). Seven
major lineages were supported within the section Calochroi, which occur throughout Europe, Central America
and North America, and can be mostly circumscribed by a
combination of features such as colour and colouration
patterns, pigment content, colour reaction with KOH and
similar shared indels in the RPB1 gene. In the following
discussions, we focus on the most significant features circumscribing the major clades, and their degree of interspecific variation, as well as on specific geographical
patterns of distribution. For each of the lineages discussed
below, we give the branch support (ML/MP bootstrap values) obtained in the phylogenetic analyses of the combined dataset 3 (see Figure 3).
Calochroi clade (99/98)
This clade is a species-rich lineage within the section Calochroi containing over thirty European and ten North
American taxa (Figures 1 and 2). A combination of chemical and morphological features seems to support the
monophyly of this clade, including similar colouration

patterns of the context, stipe and pileus, KOH reaction,
stipe shape and ecological requirements, such as edaphic
and host specialisations as well as a shared 8 bp length
indel in the intron 2 portion of the RPB1 gene (Figure 3).
The indel is also present in two species (in C. elegantissimus and C. rapaceotomentosus) that were placed close to
this lineage, but without significant support. Therefore, it
is plausible that this indel represents an autapomorphy
for an extended Calochroi clade. Within Calochroi as currently defined, there are some spectacular examples of
similar basidiomes among distantly related species, which
may be explained by similar evolutionary scenarios or by
shared plesiomorphies. Thus, morphological features
alone are often found to be confusing in delimiting and/
or separating species, whereas DNA sequence analysis
reveals the existence of a major number of still unde-

scribed species that were overlooked in studies based
solely on morphology. However, additional collections
should be sequenced and thoroughly studied with respect
to the degree of intraspecific variation of macroscopical,
microscopical, chemical and ecological features before a
formal description of any new species is completed. The
fact that poor resolution within the Calochroi clade is a feature of both morphological and molecular analyses suggests that this lineage may have differentiated in a short
period of time. Therefore, additional molecular markers
may be needed to provide sufficient resolution within this
lineage. Most species are rare, with limited distributions
within boreo-nemoral areas, mainly growing on calcareous soils and associated with frondose trees. A number of
species in this clade are strictly associated with frondose
trees belonging to the Betulaceae (Corylus, Carpinus) and

species are known to be associated with coniferous trees
of the Pinaceae (Abies, Picea, Pinus, Pseudotsuga) (see Figures 1 and 2).
Caroviolacei clade (100/100)
This clade includes the European species C. caroviolaceus,
C. saporatus and C. rapaceoides with no close relatives
known to date in North America. Phylogenetic results
from ITS + RPB1 + RPB2 sequences obtained by Frøslev et
al. [1] placed these species in a weakly supported Rufoolivacei clade (see discussion of the Rufoolivacei clade). Moser
[19] placed C. caroviolaceus and C. saporatus in separate
stirpes within the subsection Multiformes. Members of this
lineage are characterised by relatively large basidiomes
with a distinctly rounded stipe bulb, pale context, amygdaliform basidiospores and a lack of colouration change
with the application of KOH. The taxon C. caroviolaceus is
exclusively associated with frondose trees belonging to the
genera Carpinus, Fagus and Quercus, and C. saporatus
occurs with Fagus, Quercus and Tilia in Europe.

Dibaphi clade (99/98)
This clade contains European, Central American and
North American populations of C. arcuatorum and the
European species C. dibaphus. Members of the Dibaphi
clade share similar colour changes with KOH, pigment
content and colour patterns of the basidiomes. Chromogenic triterpenoid pigments (sodagnitins) in C. arcuatorum
[10] and probably in other Dibaphi may be significant
chemical markers for this group. Sequences of New World
populations of C. arcuatorum differ significantly from
their European counterparts, and they cluster into three
closely related monophyletic groups, which roughly correspond to their respective geographical ranges of distribution. Despite relatively high sequence divergences
between New World and European populations of C.
arcuatorum, little phenotypic variation in morphological
features of the basidiomes and colouration between these
collections was observed. A certain range of variability of
the basidiospore size was observed between collections of
C. arcuatorum from different parts of North America and
Europe [23]. However, the area sampled for this study rep-

resents only part of the modern pattern of geographical
distribution of this species complex. Here, it is necessary
to mention that an ITS sequence (AY033120; published
by Peintner et al. [14]) of C. arcuatorum from Wyoming
was identical to sequences of our European collections of
this taxon. Populations of C. arcuatorum are associated
with tree species of the genera Fagus and Quercus in
Europe, Quercus spp., in Central America, and Lithocarpus,
Quercus, Pseudotsuga, and Tsuga in North America. Our
study suggests that some populations of the C. arcuatorum
complex have evolved very specialised habitat requirements with allopatric diversification, probably involving
co-migration along a cline with their associated host trees,
specifically with Douglas fir, hemlock, stone oak and oak.
Future studies may show that such populations already
represent separated species. Cortinarius dibaphus seems to
be less host specific growing with coniferous (Abies alba)
and frondose (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus spp.) trees in
Europe [2].
Elegantiores clade (99/71)
This clade includes European (C. elegantior, C. eufulmineus, C. glaucescens, C. majusculus, C. murellensis, C.
olearioides, C. parafulmineus, C. splendificus) and North
American (C. elegantior JFA 11452 and JFA 11693, C. elegantior var.americanus JFA 12438) taxa. A phylogenetic
analysis from ITS sequences published recently by Garnica
et al. [25] revealed three subclades among European Elegantiores. Members of the Elegantiores clade share similar
colouration of the pileus, lamellae, stipe and context, and
KOH reaction. The yellow-greenish colours of the basidiomes of C. eufulmineus, C. elegantior, C. olearioides and C.
splendificus correspond to flavomannin-di- and trimethylether pigments [7,9,11]. Populations from both sides of
the distribution range of C. elegantior share remarkable
morphological and colouration similarities. However,
high levels of genetic diversity were found in the North
American populations of C. elegantior as evidenced by various unique substitutions and indels (see Figures 1 and 2).
Our phylogenetic analysis indicates that C. elegantior
var.americanus represents a species separated from C. elegantior rather than a variety of it, which macroscopically
differs mainly in the colour of the veil [18]. The genetic
diversity found in the C. elegantior complex might suggest
that populations evolved with their associated host trees.
Cortinarius elegantior and C. parafulmineus are restricted to
coniferous trees (Picea, Pinus, Tsuga) and the remaining
taxa are associated with frondose trees of the genera Carpinus, Fagus and Quercus occurring across the boreonemoral areas in North America and Europe.
Napi clade (85/<50)
This clade as conceived here contains European (C. aureopulverulentus and C. napus) and Northern American (C.
albobrunnoides, C. albobrunnoides var. violaceovelatus, C.
aurora, and C. subpurpureophyllus var. sulphureovelatus)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/1

taxa. Members in this clade have been classified in separate sections in the subgenus Phlegmacium: C. aurora was
placed in the section Aurantiovelati [18]; C. aureopulverulentus in the section Caerulescentes [4]; C. albobrunnoides, C.
albobrunnoides var. violaceovelatus and C. napus in the section Phlegmacium [see, for example [4,18,26]], and C. subpurpureophyllus var. sulphureovelatus in the section Calochroi
[17]. The groupings derived from our molecular analyses
are largely in agreement with similar colouration patterns
of the pileus, lamellae, context and stipe, a lack of KOH
reaction (except for C. aurora and C. aureopulverulentus)
and basidiospore morphology in these taxa. The close
placement of C. aurora and C. aureopulverulentus in our
analysis (Figure 3) fits with similarities of the veil colouration. Moser and Peintner [26] analysed the phylogenetic
relationships in the Cortinarius aureopulverulentus group.
These authors demonstrated the paraphyly of the section
Thalliophili [5], but the precise phylogenetic placement of
C. aureopulverulentus was not resolved with confidence.
On the basis of differences in veil colouration, Moser and
Ammirati [17,27] distinguished the varieties C. albobrunnoides var. violaceovelatus and C. subpurpureophyllus var. sulphureovelatus. However, low sequence divergences (0.1%)
among the European C. napus and the North American C.
albobrunnoides, C. albobrunnoides var. violaceovelatus and C.
subpurpureophyllus var. sulphureovelatus suggest that these
taxa are conspecific or perhaps the ITS region is too conservative to discriminate among these species. The first
alternative could suggest a surprising intraspecific lability
of veil colouration. However, to clarify aspects on species
delimitations, the analysis of additional fungal collections
and DNA markers is necessary. Members of the Napi clade
seem to have diversified together with coniferous trees of
the genera Abies, Picea, Pinus, Pseudotsuga and Tsuga
throughout boreo-nemoral areas in North America and
Europe.
Pseudoglaucopodes clade (100/100)
This lineage comprises European (C. elotus, C. olivellus, C.
pseudoglaucopus) and North American (Cortinarius sp. USA
14 and 15, C. elotoides, C. flavaurora) taxa, congruent with
current classification systems [see [4,18,19]]. Members of
this clade share similar colouration patterns of the basidiomes, basidiospore morphology and lack of KOH reaction. This study indicates the need to re-evaluate the
specific status of C. elotoides and C. flavaurora (Figures 1
and 2). Members of the Pseudoglaucopodes clade seem to
have co-evolved strictly with coniferous trees of the genera
Picea and Pseudotsuga, and these associations are maintained through subalpine regions in the northern hemisphere (North America and Europe).
Rufoolivacei (<50/<50)
According to the present study, the monophyly of Rufoolivacei is questionable. This taxon includes the European
species C. cedretorum var. suberetorum, C. cupreorufus, C.
Page 10 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:1

elegantissimus, C. prasinus, C. odorifer, C. olivascentium, C.
rufoolivaceus, C. xanthophyllus, the North American collections Cortinarius sp. USA 7, USA 9, USA 10 and USA 12,
and C. saxamontanus. Species in this group display several
similarities including pigment content, KOH reaction,
and colour patterns of the basidiomes. Oertel [9] and
Steglich and Oertel [11] detected pigments of the phlegmacin group in the basidiomes of C. elegantissimus, C.
cedretorum, and C. prasinus and of the rufoolivacin group
in C. cupreorufus, C. odorifer, C. rufoolivaceus, and C. xanthophyllus, respectively. Interestingly, in the analysis of the
combined dataset a cluster composed of European (C.
cedretorum var. suberetorum, C. cupreorufus, C. prasinus, C.
rufoolivaceus, C. xanthophyllus) and North American (C.
saxamontanus) species received an ML bootstrap support
of 86% (Figure 3). Rufoolivacei, as conceived here, differs
substantially from the results of Frøslev et al. [1,16]. Our
present study suggests that Caroviolacei plus Pseudoglaucopodes may represent a group distinct from Rufoolivacei (Figures 1 and 2). A combination of traits (colour of the
basidiomes and KOH reaction) supports this hypothesis.
Most Rufoolivacei are associated with frondose trees
(Fagus, Lithocarpus, Quercus) and only few species occur
with coniferous trees (Picea, Pinus, Pseudotsuga) across the
boreo-nemoral regions in North America and Europe.
Splendentes clade (77/88)
Splendentes includes relatively common European species
(C. atrovirens f.atrovirens, C. atrovirens f.ionochlorus, C.
meinhardii, C. odoratus, C. splendens) and also C. viridirubescens from North America. The phylogenetic placement
of C. viridirubescens is consistent with the traditionally
noted morphology, KOH reaction and colouration of the
basidiomes [23]. This monophyletic group is in good
agreement with similarities in pigment content, KOH
reaction and colouration patterns of the basidiomes [15].
Ecologically, C. atrovirens f.ionochlorus, C. odoratus and C.
splendens grow strictly associated with Fagus sylvatica; C.
meinhardii with Picea abies; whereas C. atrovirens f.atrovirens and C. viridirubescens are less specific, growing with
both frondose (Arbutus, Fagus, Quercus, Lithocarpus) and/
or coniferous (Abies, Picea, Pinus, Pseudotsuga) trees.
Sulfurini group (<50/<50)
Concerning Sulfurini, which includes European (C. flavovirens and C. sulfurinus) and North American (C. guttatus)
species, our phylogenetic hypotheses are incongruent. On
the one hand, C. flavovirens and C. sulfurinus appear as sister taxa in the best tree found in the ML analysis of the
combined dataset 3 (though with bootstrap support
below 50%; Figure 3); on the other hand C. flavovirens was
separated from the joined C. sulfurinus and C. guttatus
with a bootstrap support of 92% in the analysis of dataset
2 (Figures 1 and 2). Frøslev et al. [1] recognised Sulfurini

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/1

(excluding C. flavovirens); as a monophyletic group. Members of the Sulfurini group share several similarities such as
KOH reaction, pigment contents and colouration patterns
of the basidiomes. The yellow-greenish colours of the
basidiomes correspond to phlegmacin-8'-methylether B2
(C. flavovirens and C. sulfurinus) pigments [9,11]. Cortinarius flavovirens grows associated with frondose trees
(Fagus, Quercus), and North American C. guttatus and C.
sulfurinus are associated with coniferous trees (Abies, Picea,
Pinus) in Europe.
Species with unresolved phylogenetic positions
The isolated positions of C. aureocalceolatus, C. aureofulvus,
C. citrinus, C. langeorum, C. natalis, C. osmophorus, C. rapaceotomentosus and C. suaveolens obtained in our maximum
likelihood analysis are in part consistent with previous
findings by Frøslev et al. [1,16]. Cortinarius langeorum and
C. suaveolens, which were nested within the Rufoolivacei
clade in the molecular analyses by these authors, were not
included in Rufoolivacei, but appeared on isolated
branches close to this group in our trees (Figures 1, 2 and
3). A close relationship between C. rapaceotomentosus and
the Calochroi clade was supported in our MP bootstrap
analysis. This hypothesis is consistent with a similar
shared indel in the RPB1 sequences (Figure 3). The high
MP bootstrap support for a position of C. natalis close to
Splendentes is consistent with similar pigments of the
basidiomes. Cortinarius aureofulvus has a wide distribution
in subalpine forests across the northern hemisphere,
where North American populations grow associated with
Abies lasiocarpa, Picea engelmannii, P. pungens and Pseudotsuga menziesii [18], while their European counterparts
occur associated with Abies alba, Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris.
Multiple origins of sequestrate species in the section
Calochroi
Thiers [28] and Thiers & Smith [29] suggested that the
sequestrate forms in the genus Cortinarius represent morphological adaptations to dry environmental conditions.
Molecular analyses indicated that sequestrate basidiomes
forms have evolved independently several times within
several clades in Cortinarius [12]. The same was concluded
from the geographical distribution of modern populations and glacial pluvial events in the Great Basin of North
America [30]. Sequestrate species appear during spring in
subalpine to alpine sites across the western USA [29,30].
Our phylogenetic analyses suggest that sequestrate forms
have evolved independently at least twice in the Calochroi
clade (C. verrucisporus and Cortinarius sp. USA 16) and one
time within Rufoolivacei (C. saxamontanus). Furthermore,
this study emphasises the need to study the morphological and molecular data of additional specimens to clarify
species concepts in these heavy veiled taxa.

Circumscribing the major lineages within section Calochroi
Our concept of section Calochroi comprises species that
have been classified in the sections Calochroi and Fulvi
[2,31]; in the sections Coerulescentes, Fulgentes, Glaucopodes, Laeticolores, Multiformes and Thalliophili [5,32]; and in
the sections Calochroi, Coerulescentes, Fulvi and Laeticolores
[4], or Calochroi, Coerulescentes, Fulvi and Scauri [19]. Our
phylogenetic results differ from those of Frøslev et al.
[1,16] mainly regarding the number and the inner topology of the major clades recognised within the section
Calochroi: (i) Frøslev et al. [1,16] recognised three (/Calochroid, /Fulvi and /Rufoolivacei) and five (/Arcuatorum, /
Calochroid, /Fulvi, /Rufoolivacei and /Sulphurinus) major
subclades within Calochroi, respectively; (ii) the members
of the clades Dibaphi, Elegantiores and Splendentes in the
present study were nested within the subclades /Fulvi and
/Rufoolivacei of Frøslev et al. [16] and /Arcuatorum, /Fulvi
and /Rufoolivacei of Frøslev et al. [1]; (iii) Caroviolacei and
Pseudoglaucopodes were placed within a relatively weakly
supported subclade assigned as /Rufoolivacei by Frøslev et
al. [1,16]; (iv) the members of Splendentes were placed in
isolated positions in the analyses of Frøslev et al. [16].
Some relationships among the Dibaphi, Elegantiores, Napi
and Splendentes clades are clearly resolved for the first time
in our combined analysis (Figure 3). Including additional
molecular markers in future phylogenetic analyses may be
the key to resolving more basal nodes in the Calochroi
phylogeny.

Many species in the section Calochroi are characterised by
bright colours on the one hand and by abruptly marginate
to flattened bulbous stipe bases (see Figure 3). Most of the
species in this clade are associated with broadleaf trees
and generally grow under a layer of fallen leaves. Thus
they are shielded from sunlight, whereas the presence of a
broader stipe base allows more stability of larger basidiomes, especially in sites with a relatively thin layer of
organic material. In our phylogenetic hypothesis obtained
from the combined dataset (Figure 3) the species with
brightly coloured pigments distributed throughout the
whole basidiome and usually with rounded to marginate
bulbous stipe base were placed in the basal parts of the
tree, while members of the Calochroi clade and closely
related species are characterised by their relatively pale
coloured basidiomes (predominantly whitish to cream
flesh and sometimes with greyish to violet tinges restricted
above the lamellae, stipe apex and/or cortex) and abruptly
marginate to flattened bulbous stipe base. Interestingly,
there is striking homoplasy and phenotypic plasticity of
basidiome colouration with age in species of the clades
Calochroi, Napi and Pseudoglaucopodes. In contrast, the
basidiomes of species of Rufoolivacei and the Sulfurini and
Splendentes clades exhibit relatively little colour change
with age. A possible explanation for this may be that the
more highly methylated pigments of the latter group are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/1

more stable in relation to environmental factors (e.g. sunlight).
Our analyses show that colour reaction with KOH and
colour of the basidiome context are the most phylogenetically informative characters to circumscribe major clades
within the section Calochroi with only a few exceptions,
whereas characters related to size and shape of the basidiomes, stipe shape, basidiospore size and shape, and
pileipellis structure show high levels of homoplasy and/or
phenotypic plasticity. Furthermore, characteristic colour
reactions with KOH related to the presence/absence of
sodagnitins either on the pileus and/or mycelium covering the stipe bulb offer a framework for discriminating
among species with similar macroscopical appearance
and ecological specialisation. This study demonstrates
that dried and adequately preserved herbarium specimens
are also useful for performing macrochemical tests with
KOH. Similar observations were made in Dermocybe species on herbarium specimens stored for several years [33].
Patterns of species diversification and biogeographic
distributions
ITS DNA sequence divergence among several collections
of species restricted to Europe, North America or Central
America was low (0–0.1%). In general, our morphological and phylogenetic concepts for European calochroid
species fit with those applied by Frøslev et al. [1,16] and
Peintner et al. [12,14,27] (Additional file 1). Similar
sequence variation was observed between collections
from disjunct populations in the clade Napi (C. napus/C.
albobrunnoides/C. albobrunnoides var. violaceovelatus/C. subpurpureophyllus var. sulphureovelatus) and C. aureofulvus,
where sequence divergence was poorly related to geographical distances. For these examples, the ITS sequence
divergence between North American and European populations is relatively low compared with the range of variation that has been detected in some biological species of
Agaricales [34-37]. A possible explanation for the very low
genetic variation between the populations mentioned
above is that they were established through recent
founder events and have not had time to evolve a higher
ITS sequence divergence. Although long-distance dispersal explains well a conspicuous percentage of today's
trans-Atlantic disjunct distributions in angiosperms (see
[38] for a recent review), it seems unlikely that long-distance dispersal through basidiospores between continents
is the reason for the low sequence divergence between
North American and European populations of the taxa
mentioned above, since a combination of several factors
such as the presence of a compatible haploid mycelium,
appropriated edaphic and climatic conditions, as well as
the availability of adequate host tree(s) is necessary for
successful colonisation and the development of basidiomes in the new habitat. Higher levels of sequence divergence, on the other hand, may indicate that populations
Page 12 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:1

have evolved faster or/and had a more ancient separation.
Substantial sequence divergences have occurred for example within the lineages Calochroi, Dibaphi and Elegantiores,
resulting in well-resolved phylogenetic relationships
within these clades. Within the lineages Dibaphi and Elegantiores, we found that intracontinental relationships of
European and North American populations were closer
than the relationships between populations from distinct
continents. Similar levels of genetic divergence were
found in widely distributed species within the genus
Amanita [39]. However, species/populations within the C.
arcuatorum and C. elegantior complexes have undergone
very little morphological changes since their divergence,
making it impossible to separate them on the basis of
morphological characters alone. Selection in these taxa
may have predominantly occurred at the physiological
level rather than at the morphological level. It is evident
from these results that future studies including more representative population samplings are needed to clarify
questions concerning distributional patterns and ranges
of genetic divergence.
Host tree distributions seem to constitute one of the driving forces in the evolution of the genus Cortinarius. Main
geographical distributions of species/populations in the
section Calochroi include regional radiations (Elegantiores
clade), as well as clinal (Dibaphi), boreo-nemoral (Calochroi, Pseudoglaucopodes) or intercontinental (Napi, C.
aureofulvus) patterns throughout Europe, Central and
North America. However, to understand modern geographical distributions in the section Calochroi better, it is
necessary to consider the biogeographical history of their
host trees [40-42] as well as geological events [see, for
example, [43,44]]. Although the history of the flora is still
somewhat controversial, generally it is accepted that
migration either via the Bering or North Atlantic bridges
during the late Cretaceous and the Tertiary periods has
played a crucial role in modern distributions of plants
[45]. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that closely
related Cortinarius species occurring on separate continents originated in the migration of a common ancestor
together with its associated tree host.
The high diversification found in the Calochroi clade
roughly matches the distribution of several broadleaf trees
throughout boreo-nemoral areas [40] in Europe, Central
and North America. An explanation for this high diversification may be that the edaphic factors (e.g., pH, soil aeration, organic and inorganic composition) of broadleaf
forests are more favourable for many calochroid species
than the coniferous forests, or simply the fact that there is
a higher species diversity in the angiosperm trees compared to the conifers. The diversification of angiosperms
and gymnosperms is thought to have driven the diversification of other ectomycorrhizal fungal groups [see e.g.,
[46-48]] and the Calochroi diversification might follow

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/1

similar patterns. Despite their crucial role for the ecology
of a wide spectrum of trees in the northern hemisphere
(ectomycorrhiza), we are only beginning to understand
the factors modelling the evolutionary history of the Calochroi. Future studies with a focus on molecular dating and
phylogeographic analyses including a broad sampling of
taxa occurring disjunctly in the northern hemisphere are
required to estimate the age and geographical origins of
the calochroid lineages as well as to further elucidate the
historical dispersal and diversification.

Conclusion
This study demonstrates the great potential of comparative DNA sequence analyses of multiple populations from
different geographical origins for understanding patterns
of genetic and morphological variation at the species/
population level within a biogeographical and taxonomic
context. Our phylogenetic analyses support the division of
the section Calochroi into seven major clades (Calochroi,
Caroviolacei, Dibaphi, Elegantiores, Napi, Pseudoglaucopodes,
and Splendentes), whereas Rufoolivacei and Sulfurini were
not supported as monophyletic entities. Major phylogenetic groups agree partially with morphology-based and
earlier molecular phylogenetic studies. Some phylogenetic relationships within these clades are unexpected
based on phenotypic features, which may be explained by
convergent evolution of similar morphologies within
phylogenetically divergent lineages in Calochroi. This
study shows that combinations of features such as colour
and colouration patterns, colour reactions with KOH, pigment contents, veil, and pileipellis colouration of basidiomes are useful for circumscribing clades, whereas
characters related to size and shape of the basidiomes,
stipe shape, basidiospore size and shape, and pileipellis
structure display high levels of homoplasy and/or phenotypic plasticity. Bright pigments evolved independently
multiple times in the section Calochroi, and abruptly marginate to flattened stipe bulbs represents an autapomorphy for the clade Calochroi.
Furthermore, our study suggests the need for future phylogenetic analyses using multiple molecular markers of
those lineages with poorly understood phylogenies as
well as the critical re-evaluation of species concepts especially within the clades Calochroi, Dibaphi, Elegantiores,
Napi and Pseudoglaucopodes. Main geographical distributional patterns for Calochroi species include clinal,
regional and disjunct intercontinental distributions across
Europe, Central and North America, where species/populations seem to follow the natural distribution of their
host trees. Species in the section Calochroi show different
degrees of host fidelity: some are associated exclusively
either with coniferous or frondose trees; while others
show relatively high host fidelity at least at the host genus
level, suggesting potential co-evolutionary/co-migratory
patterns.

Methods
Taxon sampling
For preliminary molecular analyses we used a taxonomically representative global sampling of collections of Cortinarius, subgenus Phlegmacium, as a phylogenetic
framework to filter out calochroid species which do not
belong to our focal group, the monophyletic section Calochroi sensu Frøslev et al. [1,16] and Garnica et al. [15]. In a
second step, thorough analyses were performed to estimate phylogenetic relationships within our focal group.
Our final taxon sampling included collections of all
known species of Calochroi and Fulvi sensu M.M. Moser
[4,19] and Brandrud [2] with the exception of C. chlorophanus, C. inexpectatus, C. rhodophyllus, C. stephanopus
and C. vaginatus. In addition, to establish congruence and
uniformity of species concepts, our own sequences were
compared with ITS sequences of European calochroid species
retrieved
from
GenBank
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and UNITE http://unite.ut.ee/
databases. In many cases, multiple collections per species
from different geographical origins were used to analyse
intraspecific morphological and genetic variation. In
addition to the specimens collected and identified in fresh
condition by the authors and collaborators, selected herbarium collections from Austria (IB), France (PC), Norway (O), Spain (Arangu-Cort) and USA (MICH) were
examined. Host tree genera were assigned to the collections based on field observations. A specimen list including geographical origin, host tree(s), voucher number and
GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov accession numbers of the Calochroi species included in this study is available in the Supplementary Table (see Additional file 3).
Extraction of genomic DNA, PCR amplification, and
sequencing
The total genomic DNA was extracted from dried lamella
fragments using the DNAeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The ITS region (including the gene coding for
the 5.8 S ribosomal subunit) and the D1/D2 regions of
the nucLSU were amplified with the primer combination
ITS1F (5'-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3', [49])/NL4
(5'-GGTCCGTGTTTCAAGACGG-3', [50]). Alternatively,
DNA from older or poorly preserved specimens was
amplified with the primer combinations ITS1F/ITS4 (5'TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3', [51]) and 5.8SR (5'TCGATGAAGAACGCAGCG-3')/LR3 (5'-CCGTGTTTCAAGACGGG-3') [52]. PCR amplifications of RPB1 domains
A-C were made with the primer combination RPB1-A (5'GARTGYCCDGGDCAYTTYGG-3') and RPB1-C (5'CCNGCDATNTCRTTRTCCATRTA-3') [53]. In a few cases,
weak amplifications of the RPB1 gene were used as a template for a second PCR with the same primer combination. Amplified PCR products were purified using the
QIAquick protocol (Qiagen). Cycle sequencing was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/1

accomplished using the ABI PRISM Dye-Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Kit version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA). For sequencing of the RPB1 A-C gene, the
forward primer RPB1-A sg (5'-YTSAARGCYGGTGAGT-3')
and the reverse primer RPB1-B sg (5'-TCCGCRCCYTCYTTGG-3') were used [54]. Sequencing was performed
with an ABI 3100 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Forward and reverse sequences were assembled
and edited using Sequencher version 4.1 (Gene Codes
Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
Alignments
Initially, contiguous sequences including ITS1 and ITS2,
5.8S and approximately 600 bases of the 5' terminal
domain (D1/D2 regions) of the nucLSU of a broad sampling of Phlegmacium species by Garnica et al. [[13,15],
unpublished data] were automatically aligned in MAFFT
v5.7 [55] and analysed by neighbor joining [56] in PAUP*
4.0b10 [57] using Kimura 2-parameter distances [58]. A
final sequence sampling was obtained by successive pruning towards the focal fungal group of this study. Those
sequences lacking either ITS1 or ITS2 regions were
excluded from the final matrix. We also aligned the nucleotide sequences of ITS region from our final alignment
with those downloaded from GenBank http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and UNITE http://unite.ut.ee/
databases following the methodology indicated above
(dataset 1). In addition, to estimate genetic variation
between collections of the same species and also between
closely related species more accurately, we aligned and
compared our own sequences with their respective chromatograms and also those sequences retrieved from the
GenBank and UNITE databases using Sequencher.
Intraspecific genetic differences were counted from pairwise alignments. Furthermore, percentages of internal
transcribed spacer region (ITS1, ITS1, and 5.8S subunit)
and D1/D2 region of the rDNA sequence divergence
within and among closely related species were estimated.
We then realigned a final set of 230 ITS, 5.8S and D1/D2
sequences using the FFT-NS-i strategy of MAFFT (dataset
2). Sixty-one RPB1 A-C sequences were aligned using the
E-INS-i strategy of MAFFT v5.7 [54], with minor manual
adjustments made in SeAl v2.11 [59]. This alignment was
concatenated with aligned ITS-5.8S-D1/D2 sequences
from the same specimens to obtain dataset 3. Leading or
trailing gaps were coded as missing data. Gblocks Version
0.91b [60] was used for eliminating gapped and too divergent portions of the datasets 2 and 3 with a minimum
block length of 4 positions and gaps allowed in any alignment position for no more than half of the sequences. The
full alignments may be obtained from TreeBase http://
www.treebase.org/treebase/index.html. After exclusion of
the sites indicated above, the alignments had a length of
1144 bp (dataset 2 with 234 sequences) and 2381 bp
(dataset 3 with 61 sequences).

Molecular phylogenetic analyses
To establish congruence and uniformity of species concepts for European calochroid species (dataset 1) and to
estimate phylogenetic relationships (datasets 2 and 3),
maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis was performed with
RAxML version 7.0.0 [61]. Doing so, we followed a new
approach implemented in the software, which integrates
bootstrap analysis [62] and heuristic searches for an optimal tree. First, 1000 bootstrap replicates were run, starting
from maximum parsimony trees and using the GTRCAT
approximation. Then, every 5th bootstrap tree was used as
a starting point for thorough ML analysis, using the
GTRCAT model for heuristic searches, and optimising
branch lengths and likelihood values of the final trees
using the GTR + Γ model of DNA substitution. Tree graphics were generated in PAUP* [57] (Macintosh Classic version). For dataset 3 we additionally performed a
maximum parsimony (MP) bootstrap analysis in PAUP*,
involving 1000 replicates and treating gaps as missing
data. In each replicate, ten rounds of heuristic search were
run, with starting trees obtained by successive addition of
sequences in random order and using the TBR branch
swapping algorithm (storing multiple trees, steepest
descent option in effect). The outgroup taxa (Cortinarius
caerulescens UL 98/88, C. glaucopus TUB 011414, C. variicolor TUB 011416 and C. violaceus TUB 011561) were chosen on the basis of previous phylogenetic studies within
genus Cortinarius [14,15].

were performed by placing a drop directly on the tissue
(surface and flesh of the pileus and stipe, and the mycelium covering the base of stipe bulb) of fresh and dried
specimens, observing immediate and longer (5–10 minutes) colour changes. Changes in colour were documented from dried specimens with a NIKON COOLPIX
5400 digital camera. Microscopical characters were
observed from both fresh and dried specimens mounted
in H2O or 3% KOH solution. Pileipellis portions of dried
specimens were soaked in 3% KOH for a few minutes
before sectioning. The pileipellis structure from expanded
pilei at a position halfway to the centre was studied from
radial (longitudinal) free-hand sections using a razor
blade and observed with ×40 and ×100 (oil immersion)
lenses. Hyphal colour was recorded in 3% KOH. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) of the basidiospores of
selected species were made from approx. 5 mm2 lamellae
fragments fixed on double adhesive tape and sputtercoated with gold-palladium. Samples were examined with
a Cambridge Stereoscan 250 Mk2 scanning electron
microscope.

Ancestral state reconstruction
Ancestral states were reconstructed for two characters
related to pigmentation and morphology; flesh colour:
pale (whitish to cream, sometimes with greyish to violet
tinges are present above the lamellae, stipe cortex and/or
in stipe apex)/bright (yellow, olive, yellow green); shape
of the stipe base: rounded to marginate/abruptly marginate to flattened. For this we used unweighted Wagner parsimony as implemented in PAUP* according to the
ACCTRAN and the DELTRAN strategies [63] on the tree
with the highest likelihood found. Since the used outgroup species differ from members of section Calochroi in
their pigments and have a different stipe morphology,
these taxa were excluded for the reconstruction of ancestral states (grey branches). For Cortinarius sp. USA 16 no
data about these characters are available. Since the outgroup species differ from members of section Calochroi in
their pigments and have a different stipe morphology,
these taxa were excluded for the reconstruction of ancestral states.
