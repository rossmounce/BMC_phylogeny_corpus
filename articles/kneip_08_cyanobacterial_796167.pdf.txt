Abstract
Background: Bacteria occur in facultative association and intracellular symbiosis with a diversity
of eukaryotic hosts. Recently, we have helped to characterise an intracellular nitrogen fixing
bacterium, the so-called spheroid body, located within the diatom Rhopalodia gibba. Spheroid
bodies are of cyanobacterial origin and exhibit features that suggest physiological adaptation to
their intracellular life style. To investigate the genome modifications that have accompanied the
process of endosymbiosis, here we compare gene structure, content and organisation in spheroid
body and cyanobacterial genomes.
Results: Comparison of the spheroid body's genome sequence with corresponding regions of near
free-living relatives indicates that multiple modifications have occurred in the endosymbiont's
genome. These include localised changes that have led to elimination of some genes. This gene loss
has been accompanied either by deletion of the respective DNA region or replacement with noncoding DNA that is AT rich in composition. In addition, genome modifications have led to the
fusion and truncation of genes. We also report that in the spheroid body's genome there is an
accumulation of deleterious mutations in genes for cell wall biosynthesis and processes controlled
by transposases. Interestingly, the formation of pseudogenes in the spheroid body has occurred in
the presence of intact, and presumably functional, recA and recF genes. This is in contrast to the
situation in most investigated obligate intracellular bacterium-eukaryote symbioses, where at least
either recA or recF has been eliminated.
Conclusion: Our analyses suggest highly specific targeting/loss of individual genes during the
process of genome reduction and establishment of a cyanobacterial endosymbiont inside a
eukaryotic cell. Our findings confirm, at the genome level, earlier speculation on the obligate
intracellular status of the spheroid body in Rhopalodia gibba. This association is the first example of
an obligate cyanobacterial symbiosis involving nitrogen fixation for which genomic data are
available. It represents a new model system to study molecular adaptations of genome evolution
that accompany a switch from free-living to intracellular existence.

Background
A diversity of extracellular and intracellular symbiotic
interactions occurs between bacteria and eukaryote hosts.
The degree of interconnection between partners ranges
from the weak dependence of some extracellular associations to permanent or obligate intracellular symbiosis. In
the latter case, the endosymbiont is transmitted vertically
to the next generation without any need for re-infection.
The dependence on the host can be stabilised by loss or
inactivation of genes, whose products are no longer
required in the partnership [1,2]. Consequently, intracellular obligate symbionts loose their autonomy and therefore the capacity for a host-independent life style. Isolated
from free-living populations, vertically transmitted endosymbionts have limited possibilities for genetic exchange
through processes such as conjugation or transformation.
Typically, endosymbiont genes diverge rapidly in comparison to their homologues in free-living relatives, a phenomenon that perhaps reflects genetic drift operating on
small population size [3,4] and/or relaxation of structural/functional constraints on endosymbiont protein
evolution [5]. The genomes of obligate intracellular bacteria often show an accumulation of deleterious mutations
and a higher AT-ratio, accompanied with reduction in
genome size when compared to their free-living relatives
[6]. The dimension of these processes can be as extreme as
seen in the reduced genome of Buchnera sp., an endosymbiont of aphids with a genome size of 641 kbp [7,8] and
Carsonella, a γ-proteobacterial symbiont of phloem sapfeeding insects with a genome size of only 160 kbp [9].
Others, like the endosymbionts of the rice weevils
Sitophilus zeamais (SZPE) and Sitophilus oryzae (SOPE) as
well as Sodalis glossinidius, a symbiont of tsetse flies [1012] represent the other extreme, and exhibit only slight
reduction in genome size in comparison to free-living
close relatives. Unlike the genomes of Buchnera and Carsonella, the genomes of these endosymbionts do not
exhibit unusually high AT content.
Intracellular symbionts including SZPE and SOPE, have
lost at least one of the recombinational repair enzyme
genes encoded by recA and recF, a characteristic found in
all other bacterial intracellular symbionts. The only
known exception to this finding is the observation of
intact genes for recA and recF in S. glossinidius. The occurrence of genes for flagella apparatus still encoded in the
genome of S. glossinidus might indicate that this symbiosis
has only recently been established [12]. Cyanobacterial
interactions with plants and protists are also well known
[13-17]. These associations are in most cases facultative,
and do not involve vertical transmission. In these cases,
the cyanobacterial symbiont re-infects the host every generation. As with other facultative symbioses, genetic modification of the endosymbiont genome is yet undetected
[17].

The pennate diatom Rhopalodia gibba harbours endosymbionts closely related to extant cyanobacteria. Some of the
closest free-living relatives of these so-called spheroid
bodies are diazotrophic cyanobacteria of the Cyanothece
sp. group [18]. The spheroid bodies encode genes for
nitrogen fixation and have the capacity to fix molecular
nitrogen [18,19]. Although the spheroid bodies are of
cyanobacterial origin, they lack the typical photosynthetic
pigmentation; and thus have been assumed to be photosynthetically inactive. Unlike all other unicellular nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria, they fix nitrogen under light
conditions only [18-20]. We observe one to four spheroid
bodies per host cell depending on culture conditions
which are transmitted vertically to the daughter cells during host cell division [15]. Altogether, these findings have
led to the supposition that the spheroid bodies of R. gibba
are obligate endosymbionts. Physiological adaptation to
an intracellular endosymbiotic association is expected to
result in genome modification and this expectation has
motivated our investigation of gene structure, content and
organisation in the spheroid body's genome of R. gibba. In
order to investigate this, we have constructed fosmid
libraries of the spheroid body and Cyanothece sp. ATCC
51142 and analysed genomic regions of special interest.
Here we describe observations and analyses of the nifgene region and also loci relevant to the question of the
obligate nature of the spheroid body endosymbiosis. Our
investigations show massive genomic changes introduced
into the spheroid body's genome. These include inactivation and losses of genes and the creation of large non-coding AT-rich areas. Our observations confirm the obligate
nature of the spheroid body endosymbiont and provide
insight into the nature of genome changes that accompany endosymbiosis and organelle formation.

Results
The nif-gene region of spheroid bodies and Cyanothece
sp. ATCC 51142
For this study we cloned and sequenced the nif-operon
and flanking regions from the genomes of the intracellular symbiont of the diatom R. gibba, the spheroid bodies,
and a close free-living relative, the diazotrophic cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 (Figure 1). Altogether
we sequenced and analysed a contiguous 63,362 bp Cyanothece fragment comprising the nif gene region and a contiguous 51,475 bp fragment including the corresponding
region of the spheroid body's genome. Additionally, we
sequenced and analysed 140,000 bp of non-contiguous
genomic DNA of the endosymbiont. Using these additional datasets we characterised sequences in the spheroid
body's genome for recA, recF, psbC and psbD. For further
analyses we also used information from the genome of
the recently sequenced Cyanothece strain CCY0110 and
other closely related cyanobacteria whose genomes have
been sequenced and are available in the NCBI nr data-

base. To obtain a phylogenetic framework for making
inference of genome modification in the spheroid body's
genome we reconstructed maximum likelihood gene trees
for all homologues greater than 200 amino acids in the
63,362 bp region. Where possible, trees were outgroup
rooted using homologues from Synechocystis sp. PCC
6803. Figure 2 shows supernetworks [21] built for these
taxa. These networks summarise the relationships in individual gene trees which do not necessarily need to have
the same taxon sampling. In this analysis, with some proteins (NifB, NifN, NifS), the spheroid body's genome was
found to be most closely related to Cyanothece sp. ATCC
8801 (Figure 2a) but with other proteins (NifD, NifH,
NifK, NifE), spheroid body sequences have a closer phylogenetic relationship with Cyanothece sp ATCC 51142,
Cyanothece strain CCY0110, Crocosphaera watsonii WH
8501, and Gloeothece sp. KO68DGA (Figure 2b).
Figure 1 summarises the nif-operon-related regions of
Cyanothece sp ATCC 51142 and the spheroid body's
genome. In both, components of the nitrogenase dependent cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation machinery are
encoded, including structural genes of the nitrogenase
nifH, nifD and nifK, cofactors (nifB, nifN, nifE, nifV, nifW)
and processing proteins for metal centre biosynthesis
(nifU, nifS). As shown in figure 1, synteny of the nif-genes
including the size of intergenic regions is very high. There
is an overall G/C-content of 40.8% for this region of Cyanothece genome and a G/C-content of 37.2% for the spheroid body sequence. Codon usage is nearly equivalent in
both genome regions with a slight AT-bias at the third
codon position in the spheroid body genes (see Table 1).

GATAPlotter score settings: Max: 141 bits, expect 1E-33;
Min: 46.8 bits, expect 5E-5. GATAPlotter scores have been
represented using a greyscale bar. Regions of the spheroid
body genome showing modifications of special interest have
been indicated. A) Gene inactivation by pseudogenisation
(e.g. fdxN*); B) Gene deletion with DNA loss (e.g. cyl0012);
C) Gene deletion without DNA loss resulting in large noncoding regions (e.g. cyl0016); D) Gene deletion with DNA
loss resulting in gene fusion (e.g. cyl0019). See text for further description of individual modifications.

Although the spheroid body's genome contains the same
set of genes at the nif locus as in Cyanothece ATCC 51142,
remarkable differences are apparent. Notably, between
nifB and nifS, the functional fdxN gene is replaced by a
pseudogene (fdxN*) in the spheroid body's genome. The
coding sequence is interrupted by several stop-codons. In
contrast, an intact reading frame for fdxN is conserved in
all other close free-living cyanobacterial relatives, indicating formation of the pseudogene is a derived feature of the
spheroid body lineage (Figure 3). The presence of a truncated nifU gene is also derived on the endosymbiont lineage, corresponding to approximately 170 amino acids of
the N-terminus (Figure 4). This nifU homologue still
encodes an intact open reading frame for the [2Fe-2S]
binding and C-terminal NifU-domain. Interesting, in
more distantly related cyanobacteria (Synechocystis sp.
PCC 6803 and Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421) a truncated
homologue is also present. Based on the phylogenetic
analyses reported in Figure 2 and also comparative analyses of the NifU protein (not shown) it appears that truncation of nifU in spheroid bodies is a derived feature of the
endosymbiont lineage.

Gene deletions and modifications downstream the nifregion
Conserved downstream of the nif-operon genes in Cyanothece ATCC 51142 and the spheroid body are genes
encoding subunits of the NADH-dehydrogenase and
ferredoxin as well as transporters for Fe and Mo (Figure 1).
However, genes encoding photosynthetic proteins, which
are precursors for cytochrome c6 (petJ) and plastocyanin
(petE), are absent in the spheroid body in this genome
region. Interestingly, elsewhere in the genome, the photosystem II protein genes psbC (CP43) and psbD (D2) exist
in an operon-like structure, similar to that of Cyanothece
sp. CCY0110 and other cyanobacteria. However, in the
spheroid body these genes are highly truncated or disrupted by several stop codons and thus exist as pseudogenes. This finding is consistent with the lack of
photosynthetic activity previously reported for the spheroid body [18,19].

Downstream of the highly conserved nif-gene region,
other genetic modifications can be inferred. In Cyanothece
ATCC 51142, and other closely related cyanobacteria the
open reading frame (orf)cyl0012 is flanked by the genes
for an iron-transporter (feoA) and a Mo-ABC-transporter
(modC). This orf has been deleted in the spheroid body's
genome (Figure 1). In this case the whole gene has been
removed without trace of pseudogenisation or local
sequence conservation. The orf identified as cyl0019 in
Cyanothece ATCC 51142 has also been lost from the nifregion. In this species and other close relatives, this orf is
flanked by two conserved orfs cyl0018 and cyl0020. In the

spheroid body's genome, cyl0019 is deleted and the flanking orfs cyl0018 and cyl0020 are fused to give to the hypothetical protein sbl0010 (Figure 5). Not all deletions of
genes in the spheroid body's genome have resulted in
genome compaction as some genome regions appear
replaced by non-coding regions as described in the following section.
Extensive modifications lead to large non-coding regions in
the spheroid body's genome
A significant difference between the genome of Cyanothece
sp. ATCC 51142 and that of the spheroid body is the
extent of non-coding DNA stretches greater than 500 bp
(Figure 6). In the former there are three non-coding
stretches at the nif locus (including downstream region).
There are seven such regions in the spheroid body's
genome fragment. One of these additional non-coding
regions is located adjacent to the nif gene region, in a
region of high synteny between both genomes. The noncoding regions of the spheroid body's genome are characterised by elevated levels of A and T nucleotides. Several
pseudogenes are also located within these genome regions
(Figure 1 and 6).

In Cyanothece ATCC 51142, the gene fdxIII and an orf coding for a conserved hypothetical protein (cyl0018) flank
four open reading frames (cyl0014/vagC, cyl0015/pilT,
cyl0016, cyl0017/vapC). Three of these have highest similarity to virulence associated proteins (vap-proteins) and the
fourth has greatest similarity with proteins containing a
PIN-domain (Figure 1). In spheroid bodies, fdxIII and the

frame a non-coding region of about 2000 bp which contains two pseudogenes: for a flavodoxin, long-chain hypothetical protein and an orf conserved in Crocosphaera
sp.(CwatDRAFT_1967). This non coding region shows an
increased AT-ratio of 73.5% (Figure 6). Its presence is the
result of extensive genome modification which has led to
the deletion of multiple genes. Unlike other regions where
there has been gene deletion (e.g. as with cyl0012), this
modification is not accompanied by the deletion of the
genomic regions. It is possible that these regions might be
the outcome of multiple mutations leading to the loss of
genes, no longer recognizable as pseudogenes, with preservation of the genomic locus, which might be subsequently eliminated [22]. Because the whole genome size
of spheroid bodies is not experimentally determined so
far, it is not known if these modifications have lead to an
overall decrease of the spheroid body genome size. As
described in more detail in the discussion part, we used a
bioinformatic model to predict the size of the whole sphe-

roid body genome. Using this prediction, the genome size
is estimated to be approximately 2,6 Mb.
To investigate whether intact copies of missing or pseudogenised genes (e.g. after genome rearrangement or gene
duplication events) are present elsewhere in the spheroid
body's genome, we performed PCR analysis with specific
or degenerate primers for the cyanobacterial genes fdxN,
petJ, psbC, cyl0012 and cyl0017. As shown in Figure 7, no
products were amplified using either spheroid body or R.

(pseudo)genes do not have functional counter parts

known that gene loss and pseudogene creation is often
associated with defects in recA, and/or recF [10]. In order
to investigate whether the observed inactivation and deletion of genes in the spheroid body's genome might be
explained by defects in the bacterial repair systems, we
searched the genomes of the spheroid body and of Cyanothece ATCC 51142 for recA and recF. As shown in Figure
8, intact and highly conserved orfs can be identified in
both genomes, indicating that repair pathways are active
in the R. gibba endosymbiont.

Accumulation of pseudogenes in the spheroid body's
genome
As already mentioned, by analysing the contiguous spheroid body's genome fragment (Figure 1) several pseudogenes could be readily identified, among them a mutated
ferredoxin gene (fdxN*) within the nif-operon as well as
other genes downstream of the nif-gene region. Additional
pseudogenes for conserved cyanobacterial proteins were
also identified when screening 140,000 bp of non-contiguous genome sequences from the spheroid bodies. These

were found either via BLAST homology search (minimum
e-value: 5e-10) or by analysis of spheroid body's genome
regions corresponding to operons conserved in other
cyanobacteria. Genetic regions with homologues in other
species, divided into two fragments by one stopcodon or
frameshift or just truncated were considered pseudogenes
if the similar gene region was less than half the length of
its homologue [12]. Deleterious mutations leading to
pseudogenes were found in genes encoding proteins that
affect cellular processes such as cell wall biosynthesis and
transposon controlled genome rearrangement (summarized in Table 2). In Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142, only one
pseudogene was identified within the genome fragment
that contained the nif-operon (Table 2). In contrast, six
pseudogenes were found in the spheroid body's genome
fragment. No pseudogenes were identified in the genome
of Cyanothece sp. strain CCY0110 which is a very close relative of Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142.

Discussion
An intriguing example of an obligate intracellular symbiotic interaction is the cyanobacterium-diatom symbiosis
found in Rhopalodia gibba [18]. Here the symbiont (spheroid body) can fix nitrogen for its eukaryotic host, and we
have hypothesised that this capacity has been a driving
force for establishing the intracellular endosymbiotic relationship [17]. The spheroid body of Rhopalodia gibba provides an opportunity to investigate changes in
endosymbiont physiology and genome evolution during
adaptation of a symbiont to an intracellular environment.

Previous studies have reported changes in the genomes of
bacteria following development of symbiotic relationships. In bacteria that are thought to have recently or transiently become symbiotic, changes include occurrence of
multiple transposable elements and deletions of important components of recombinational DNA repair mechanisms [1]. In longer established symbiotic and parasitic
eukaryote-bacterium interactions, significant gene losses
have been observed, and these have been accompanied by
reduction of genome size and generation of AT rich
genomes [3,6,24]. Changes that have occurred in the
spheroid body's genome can not be categorised as an
obvious example of the former or latter relationship. For
example, the spheroid body's genome encodes several
transposase genes, all with disrupted reading frames, indicating that these are pseudogenes. This finding is consistent with stability of the diatom-spheroid body
endosymbiosis and a long term host-endosymbiont interaction, which can be traced back to the Miocene [25].
Contrasting with the occurrence of transposase pseudogenes is evidence suggesting a functional DNA repair system in the spheroid body's genome. This is a finding more
consistent with a relatively young endosymbiotic relationship. In nearly all intracellular bacteria studied to date, at

least one of the genes encoding the DNA repair proteins
RecA and RecF has been eliminated. It is thought this
might be necessary to facilitate restructuring of the symbiont genome (for the exception see [12]). In the spheroid
body's genome both recA and recF are present and have
intact open reading frames. Thus the genome modifications that we report for the spheroid body's genome have
all occurred against a background of a presumably intact
DNA repair system. These modifications suggest that
selective pressure for certain genes has changed upon
establishment of the interaction, and the challenge is to
attempt to understand the potential relevance of these for
necessary and redundant functions in an obligate endosymbiotic relationship. For example, gene truncations as
detected e.g. in nifU, would remove genes redundant for
diazotrophic growth [26], and such deletion might be an
early event in genome reduction of the symbiont. A subsequent or perhaps parallel step would include the inactivation of genes whose gene products are no longer needed
for the initial symbiotic association. For this to occur, various different possible scenarios could be hypothesized:
inactivation of genes by deleterious mutations resulting in
the accumulation of pseudogenes or loss of genome fragments by deletion of larger DNA portions via rearrangements [27]. Another hypothesis posits a "domino-effect"
of initial pseudogenisation triggering subsequent largescale gene loss [28]. In this scenario, random pseudogenisation might lead to the inactivation of a pathway due to
mutation of a single essential factor, followed by largescale deletion of other genes involved in this pathway. In
each case, the selective pressure would be different for

genes coding for different functions, and loss would
depend on whether function could be compensated by
other genes in the endosymbiont or host cell genome. In
the latter case, as in highly adapted interactions, signaldependent transport of the protein from the host cytoplasm to the endosymbiont would be necessary.
We detected several examples for the disruption of coding
regions by mutations (Table 1), in which the original gene
is still detectable by analysis of all three possible frames.
This includes psuedogenisation of fdxN (fdxN*), a gene
which has been found to be non essential for nitrogen fixation in Anabaena variablis [20] and several other genes on
spheroid body's genome fragments that we have
sequenced (Table 2, Figure 1). Such observations provide
further evidence that pseudogenisation of genes, which
are non-essential for endosymbiotic life-style, is an important feature in the early reductive genome evolution of
obligate intracellular cyanobacteria. Gene loss through
independent DNA deletion events could also be inferred
in comparative analysis of the spheroid body's genome
fragment; among these the deletion of factors conserved
in diverse cyanobacterial lineages (cyl0012, cyl0019). Due
to elimination of the immediate DNA region, these modifications have led to a localised increase in gene density.
In one extreme, deletion has produced a fusion of nonadjacent genes on the endosymbionts genome (sbl0010).
In other cases of gene deletion, genes have been removed
and replaced with non-coding sequence that is much
higher in AT-content than occurs in the coding regions
(Figure 6). It is unclear whether this difference in compo-

sition reflects a shift in substitutional bias favouring A and
T residues, and/or whether an existing bias becomes more
apparent in de-novo regions that are under reduced structural/function constraint. In either event, the existence of
these AT rich non-coding regions suggests that pseudogenisation and DNA deletion are not inevitably linked
events in a sequential process of degenerative genome
evolution in spheroid bodies. However, non-coding
regions are rare in genomes of free-living bacteria. Since
DNA can be introduced in several ways into prokaryotic
genomes, their compactness is maintained by the deletion
of harmful DNA. Given the intracellular existence of spheroid bodies, it is possible that their genome is less exposed
and less susceptible to introductions of foreign DNA

through mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer and lysogenic bacteriphages in comparison to those of free-living
bacteria. If so, processes excluding non-coding DNA and
pseudogenes from the spheroid body's genome may well
be less efficient than those operating in free living bacteria. Such a hypothesis might help explain the greater
extent of non-coding DNA and pseudogenised genes in
the spheroid body's genome. Increased mutation rates,
thought to be associated with reductive genome evolution
would contribute to accumulation of these genome features [29]. The genome modifications observed in the
spheroid body are in some respects comparable to those
of Sodalis glossinidius. A large fraction (49%) of the Sodalis
genome is composed of non-coding DNA that has accom-

panied reductive genome evolution. Moreover, the Sodalis
chromosome contains many unusual pseudogenes [12].
The spheroid body's genome differs from Sodalis with
respect to their generally higher AT-content.
The diverse features of reductive genome evolution in
obligate intracellular symbionts (and pathogens) include
a significant reduction of overall genome size in these
organisms. However, the experimental determination of
the spheroid body's genome size using standard molecular techniques is difficult due to the extreme stability of
the host-spheroid body interaction and the limited
amount of intact and purified endosymbionts that can be
obtained from R.gibba. Recently in a study on the dynamics of reductive evolution, exponential relationships were
inferred between genome size and SSU rDNA GC-content
in mitochondria, free-living and obligate intracellular
bacteria [30]. Based on the model these authors propose,
and using 16S sequence data previously published [18],
we have estimated that the genome size of spheroid bodies is approximately 2.6 Mb. The genome size of free-living Cyanothece sp. CCY0110 is 5.8 Mb. Hence if our
estimate of the spheroid body's genome size is accurate,
this estimate suggests that reduction has produced a
genome currently similar in size to that of Synechococcus
(2.2–2.6 Mb), and may indicate that the endosymbiosis is
still at an early state of development.

identify intact psbC and psbD genes present anywhere else
in the spheroid body's genome (Figure 7).
The diverse modifications in the analysed spheroid body's
genome fragment are not equally distributed over the
whole sequence but accumulate downstream of the conserved nif gene region (Figure 1 and 5). This skewed distribution of degenerative modifications possibly reflects
purifying selection acting across this genome region during the molecular adaptation process [32]. Aside from the
mutation of fdxN* – a protein unimportant for nitrogen
fixation -and the truncation of nifU, all proteins for nitrogen fixation are conserved in the region without signs of
degenerative genome evolution. This conservation of nif
genes is consistent with the hypothesis that molecular
nitrogen fixation has been an important driving force for
the endosymbiotic interaction.
It can be expected that endosymbiont and host biochemistry will change with the development of the symbiotic
interaction. Genes whose products become superfluous
for symbiont-host coexistence are expected targets for
mutation. At earlier stages of accumulation of deleterious
mutation, holomologues will still be identifiable by
BLAST homology searches. Table 2 lists many pseudogenes that may fit this category.

Conclusion
Our comparative analyses of spheroid body's genome fosmid sequences indicate that the photosynthetic genes
psbC and psbD have been inactivated by mutation in the
endosymbiont genome. These gene products are essential
factors in the photosynthetic light reaction of photosystem II [31]. According to the "domino-effect" hypothesis
[28] initial deletion of components such as PsbC and
PsbD is expected to lead to mass deletion of other genes
involved in photosynthetic light reactions. Consistent
with this prediction, additional photosynthetic factors
that occur in closely related cyanobacteria are either
absent (e.g. the cytochrome PetJ and the plastocyanine
precursor PetE) or appear as a non functional pseudogene
(e.g. the flavodoxin fldA*) in the spheroid body's genome.
Aside from gene loss resulting from reductive genome
evolution, the absence of certain genes within the analysed genome region could also be explained by gene
duplications or rearrangements. Without the complete
sequence of the spheroid body's genome we can not
exclude the possibility that following duplication, pseudogenisation has affected copies of some genes within the
analysed genome region, while functional copies are
retained elsewhere. However, the phenotypic loss of photosynthetic pigmentation indicates a complete loss of at
least one essential factor of photosynthesis in the endosymbiont's genome. In addition, PCR analysis did not

A diverse range of genetic modifications have occurred in
the genome of R. gibba spheroid bodies and these would
compromise the ability of the endosymbiont to exist as a
free-living cyanobacterium, thereby confirming their suspected obligate status. Our findings provide insight into
the genome evolution of a nitrogen-fixing endosymbiontic cyanobacterium living within a unicellular eukaryotic
host. These are of special importance, as past inferences
about processes of reductive genome evolution have
mainly been based on the study of insect-bacteria interactions. In these, the symbionts reside within special cells or
organs and thus their genomes may haven been subject to
selection pressures different from those acting on the
genomes of intracellular endosymbionts found in unicellular host organisms. Further analysis of the whole spheroid body's genome and comparison with free-living
cyanobacteria will provide additional important information on the age of the interaction and the importance of
different molecular processes and genetic modifications.
Since the spheroid body is derived from cyanobacteriallike ancestors, the interaction could also serve as useful
model system for understanding early events in the evolution of chloroplast genomes.

Methods
Symbiont Isolation and Purification
Spheroid bodies of R. gibba were isolated and DNA was
purified as described by Prechtl [18]. Cyanothece sp. ATCC
51142 genomic DNA was isolated using standard procedures [33].
Construction of gDNA libraries
Fosmid libraries of spheroid bodies and Cyanothece sp.
ATCC 51142 were prepared using the fosmid library construction kit (Epicentre). After physical shearing, the DNA
was blunt-end repaired and gel-fractionated to a fragment
size of approximately 40 kbp as described by the manufacturer. Insert-DNA was ligated in the pCC1-Fos™ vector,
constructs were in vitro packaged into phage particles and
transfected into Escherichia coli EPI 300™-T1R.
Screening for nif-gene region, recA and recF
Screening for clones containing the nitrogen fixing
operon and flanking sequences and clones containing the

Cloning of positive fosmids
Preparation of fosmids and other DNA was performed
according to standard protocols [33]. For subcloning, fosmid DNA was physically sheared by sonification. After
blunt-end repair using the DNA Terminator Kit (Lucigen)
and size fractionation by gel electrophoresis, fragments

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/30

between 1000 and 1500 bp were isolated. The fragments
were ligated in the pEZSeq™-vector (Lucigen) as described
by the manufacturer and used to transform E. coli XL1blue
MRF' cells. Sequencing of shotgun plasmids was carried
out using cycle sequencing with 700 and 800 nm fluorescent labeled oligonucleotides and the LICOR™ sequencing
system. 5'- and 3'-end sequencing of positive fosmid
clones was performed using the primers M13 (700): 5'GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA GT-3' and a modified pCC1™/

PCR analysis of missing or pseudogenised genes in the
spheroid body's genome
PCR analysis of missing or pseudogenised genes in the
spheroid body's genome was performed with primers specific for cyanobacterial fdxN, petJ, psbC, cyl0012 and

CYrecF and SBrecF were used as positive controls, with the
same primers used for the fosmid screening experiments.
PCR reactions were performed using standard procedures.
Sequence homology determinations and annotation
We assembled, finished and annotated sequences using
the Sequencher [34] and Sequin software to allocate data
and facilitate annotation. Identification of orfs was accomplished using BLAST analyses. Comparison of genome
fragments was performed using BLAST analysis and the
GATA tool for comparative sequence analysis [35]. Pseudogenes with one or more mutations were identified by
BLAST searches or direct analysis of all open reading
frames. Genome fragments of both Cyanothece sp. ATCC
51142 and R. gibba spheroid bodies are annotated in GenBANK under the accession numbers AY728386 and
AY728387, respectively. Genes and orfs identified in both
organisms were named according to BLASTp protein
homologue names. Those orfs with homology to uncharacterised conserved hypothetical proteins and hypothetical orfs without any BLAST hit are numbered and referred
as conserved hypothetical proteins and hypothetical proteins, respectively. Orfs oriented in the forward or reverse
direction of the analysed fragment are named cyl or cyr for

Phylogenetic tree building
Orthologues for spheroid body proteins greater than 200
amino acids from the genome region shown in Figure 1
were identified in closely related cyanobacteria using
BLAST. These were aligned using CLUSTALX [34] and
edited so that only conserved blocks of residues were used
for evolutionary tree building. PHYML [36] was used to
build maximum likelihood trees, assuming a JTT model of
substitution and non-parametric bootstrapping (100 replicates). Strict consensus trees were built for each gene
using the 100 gene trees produced from bootstrap replicates. SplitsTree 4.0 [37] was then used to build the supernetworks shown in Figure 2. Some proteins greater than
200 amino acids in length did not produce resolved strict
consensus trees or were problematic for other reasons and
these were omitted from the analysis (these included
DapF, PyrF, Sbr0016, Sbl0019, FeoB1, NifP and Sbl0010).
Protein sequences, additional to those reported in the
present study and used for phylogenetic anlayses were
those inferred from nucleotide sequences in both complete and unfinished genome projects. Genbank accession
