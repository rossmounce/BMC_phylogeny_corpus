Abstract
Background: Dystrophins and dystrobrevins are distantly related proteins with important but poorly understood roles in the
function of metazoan muscular and neuronal tissues. Defects in them and their associated proteins cause a range of
neuromuscular disorders. Members of this superfamily have been discovered in a relatively serendipitous way; we set out to
compile a comprehensive description of dystrophin- and dystrobrevin-related sequences from available metazoan genome
sequences, validated in representative organisms by RT-PCR, or acquired de novo from key species.
Results: Features of the superfamily revealed by our survey include: a) Dystrotelin, an entirely novel branch of the superfamily,
present in most vertebrates examined. Dystrotelin is expressed in the central nervous system, and is a possible orthologue of
Drosophila DAH. We describe the preliminary characterisation of its function, evolution and expression. b) A novel vertebrate
member of the dystrobrevin family, γ-dystrobrevin, an ancient branch now extant only in fish, but probably present in our own
ancestors. Like dystrophin, zebrafish γ-dystrobrevin mRNA is localised to myosepta. c) The extent of conservation of alternative
splicing and alternative promoter use in the dystrophin and dystrobrevin genes; alternative splicing of dystrophin exons 73 and
78 and α-dystrobrevin exon 13 are conserved across vertebrates, as are the use of the Dp116, Dp71 and G-utrophin promoters;
the Dp260 and Dp140 promoters are tetrapod innovations. d) The evolution of the unique N-terminus of DRP2 and its
relationship to Dp116 and G-utrophin. e) A C-terminally truncated common ancestor of dystrophin and utrophin in
cyclostomes. f) A severely restricted repertoire of dystrophin complex components in ascidians.
Conclusion: We have refined our understanding of the evolutionary history and isoform diversity of the five previously
reported vertebrate superfamily members and describe two novel members, dystrotelin and γ-dystrobrevin. Dystrotelins,
dystrophins and dystrobrevins are roughly equally related to each other. Vertebrates therefore have a repertoire of seven
superfamily members (three dystrophins, three dystrobevins, and one dystrotelin), with one lost in tetrapods. Most
invertebrates studied have one member from each branch. Although the basic shared function which is implied by the common
architecture of these distantly related proteins remains unclear, it clearly permeates metazoan biology.

Background
Dystrophin, identified nearly 20 years ago as the protein
deficient in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)[1], is
now recognised as the founder member of a protein
superfamily with representatives throughout the animal
kingdom[2]. The ~70-kDa signature structure of this family is a compact cluster of domains comprising four EFhand motifs and a ZZ-domain, followed by a looser
region with a propensity to form coiled-coils. In the case
of dystrophin and its close paralogue utrophin[3], this
structure has a large N-terminal extension of actin-binding CH domains and up to 24 spectrin repeats. The use of
internal promoters and alternative splicing of genes
encoding both of these proteins enables the generation of
multiple N-terminally truncated isoforms of varying
length. DRP2 is a further paralogue which retains only
two of the spectrin repeats[4]. Dystrophin, utrophin and
DRP2 together constitute the vertebrate members of the
dystrophin branch of the superfamily; although their
function is not well understood, they each (via their signature C-terminal domains) form the core of a membranebound complex comprising dystroglycan, sarcoglycans
and syntrophins, known as the dystrophin-glycoprotein
complex (DGC) [5]. Loss of dystrophin and other components of the DGC causes disorders of the nervous and
muscular tissues[6,7]. Loss of utrophin in mouse gives a
very subtle phenotype but exacerbates the consequences
of dystrophin loss[8]. The consequences of DRP2 deficiency are unknown.
Dystrobrevins, also part of the DGC, show ~30% identity
to dystrophins, and form the other branch of the superfamily. These lack the long N-terminal extension of the
dystrophins, and are little longer than the superfamily signature structure itself. Vertebrates have two paralogous
dystrobrevins, α- and β-dystrobrevin [9-12]. α-dystrobrevin has a characteristic C-terminal extension and a range
of isoforms which rivals dystrophin's; loss of function
results in a phenotype similar to that found in dystrophin
mutants[13]. Combined loss of α- and β-dystrobrevin
results in a combination of skeletal myopathy and behavioural disorders[14].
Invertebrates, as is the case with many gene families, have
a simpler repertoire of proteins; all metazoans so far
examined (including, for example, the fruit fly and the
nematode) have a single dystrophin and a single dystrobrevin[15,16]. Mutant phenotypes so far described tend
to be of a synaptic form; loss of dystrophin or dystrobrevin in nematodes results in a hypersensitivity to acetylcholine[17], while dystrophin deficiency in flies alters the
dynamics of neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction[18].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/19

Dystrophins and dystrobrevins interact directly with each
other via homologous C-terminal coiled coil
motifs[19,20] and depend strictly on each other for their
localisation and incorporation into the DGC[14]. It seems
apparent that this heterodimeric partnership has arisen
through an ancient duplication (prior to the divergence of
metazoan phyla) of a single gene encoding a simple
homodimeric protein[2], followed by structural and functional differentiation of the two proteins. The increased
complexity of the vertebrate body has brought with it the
need for further diversity of the repertoire of DGCs, such
that there are three paralogous dystrophins with a combined total of at least 15 isoforms, two dystrobrevins with
at least eight isoforms, five syntrophins instead of two,
and six sarcoglycans instead of three.
We set out to assess the diversity of dystrophin- and dystrobrevin-related sequences throughout metazoa using a
combination of bioinformatic analysis and experimental
methods. Our data enable us to clarify the serial duplication of the single invertebrate dystrophin gene to give rise
to the vertebrate dystrophin, utrophin and DRP2 genes;
we also reveal the existence in fish (and almost certainly
in our own ancestors) of a third dystrobrevin gene. We
catalogue the extent of alternative splicing and alternative
promoter use across vertebrate dystrophins and dystrobrevins, and we find that ascidians have an unexpectedly simplified DGC. Perhaps most significantly, we report the
discovery of an entirely new branch of the protein superfamily, dystrotelin, which is as distantly related to the dystrophins and dystrobrevins as they are to each other.

Results and discussion
Starting from known dystrophin- and dystrobrevinrelated sequences, our principal approach was to use publicly available genome databases as a starting point from
which to establish the likely extent of isoform- and paralogue-based diversity. Predictions based on this were then
tested experimentally and supplemented by acquiring further data that were not predictable from the databases.
Confirmed sequences were subjected to further bioinformatic analysis and, in the case of dystrotelin, to preliminary functional and expression analysis.
DRP2
DRP2 is a small vertebrate paralogue of dystrophin and
utrophin, whose expression is largely confined to punctate structures in the CNS[21] and patches between the
Cajal bands of schwann cells in the PNS[22]. Its role in the
CNS is unknown, but in the PNS DRP2 interacts with Lperiaxin via its spectrin repeats, and is reduced in a periaxin-deficient myelination disorder[22].

We compiled a set of sequences which is likely to encompass much of the DRP2 diversity present in extant organ-

isms. Much of this was done by BLAST searches for
obvious paralogous exons in available genomic and
expressed sequence databases. In addition to this, certain
critical sequences had to be obtained experimentally by
5'cRACE[23], namely the 5' end of a bony fish DRP2 transcript (Danio rerio [GenBank:DQ443728]), and the missing 40% of a cartilaginous fish DRP2 (Scyliorhinus canicula
[GenBank:U43517], updated). In order to establish
whether the cartilaginous fish was the most divergent
organism to possess DRP2, we also made extensive unsuccessful attempts to isolate DRP2-related sequences from
cyclostomes (see section on cyclostomes).
Comparison of most of the DRP2 sequence yields the
unremarkable findings expected of a highly conserved vertebrate protein (72% identity, 83% similarity between
human and fish). The only point of interest is the DRP2specific elaboration of the N-terminus and its relationship
to its paralogues Dp116 and G-utrophin (Figure 1A). An
identifiable orthologue of the first human coding exon
(exon 3, encoding residues 1 to 39) was evident in eutherian mammals (dog, cow, mouse, rat), a marsupial (opossum), a monotreme (platypus), a bird (chicken) and an
amphibian (xenopus). Although the similarity at the
genomic level was marginal for the last two species, these
were both supported by ESTs ([GenBank:DR425253] and
[GenBank:CX826467], respectively). Outside the tetrapod
clade, it is striking that DRP2 sequences only share high
homology from human methionine 79 (see Figure 1A).
The exonic region immediately 5' of this in three species
of fish (D. rerio, Fugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis)
also shows a highly conserved (but fish-specific)
sequence. In order to clarify whether Met79 is the first inframe ATG in non-tetrapods, we performed 5'cRACE on
DRP2 RNA from both the bony fish D. rerio (zebrafish;
whole animal [GenBank:DQ443728]) and from the cartilaginous fish S. canicula (lesser spotted catshark; brain
[GenBank:U43517], updated). In each case, Met79 was
the 5'-most in-frame methionine, preceded by at least one
in-frame stop codon (within exon 4 for S. canicula and in
exon 3 for D. rerio). This suggests that Met79 is the ancestral DRP2 start site, and that the tetrapod-specific 49–78amino acid N-terminal region is a later acquisition, presumably with a specific function. However, initiator
codon usage in any DRP2 sequence is still to be confirmed
experimentally, and usage may be tissue-specific.
Clear similarity between the DRP2s and other members of
the dystrophin family begins at Met79, a residue which is
conserved in all vertebrate dystrophins, utrophins and
DRP2s and all known insect dystrophins (the N-terminally truncated sea squirt dystrophin starts 22 residues
further on; see "Ascidians" below). DRP2s possess two full
spectrin repeats (as defined by Winder et al[24] and by the
SMART database) paralogous to repeats 23 and 24 of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/19

human dystrophin, preceded by sequence equivalent to
most of the last helix of repeat 22. The gross structural
resemblance between DRP2, dystrophin isoform Dp116,
and utrophin isoform G-utrophin has been noted
before[4,25], and it is clear from the similar sizes and
reading frame phase of DRP2 exon 4 and dystrophin and
utrophin exon 56 (see Figure 1A) that this entire exon was
duplicated during the ancestral formation of the DRP2
gene, and that the sequence upstream of the ancestral
DRP2 start site (Met79) has subsequently diverged. It is
also possible that the first exon of Dp116/G-utrophin
(which lies in intron 55 of the dystrophin and utrophin
genes) was also duplicated in this event, and gave rise to
the first coding exon (exon 3) of the DRP2 gene, though
no similarity is expected to remain. It is notable that there
is still some residual similarity at the amino acid level
between the first exons of Dp116 and G-utrophin (Figure
1A and [see Additional File 1]).
The cyclostome dystrophin/utrophin ancestor
In order to resolve the point of divergence of the three paralogous vertebrate dystrophins (dystrophin itself,
utrophin and DRP2), we acquired samples from three
cyclostomes (the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa, the sea
lamprey, Petromyzon marinus, and the brook lamprey,
Lampetra planeri). We used the pan-dystrophin degenerate
primers described previously[4] to perform RT-PCR on
total brain RNA. This gave a single dystrophin/utrophinlike sequence in each species, despite various attempts to
isolate paralogous sequences (the same RT-PCR performed on mouse brain RNA yields a mixture of paralogues). These failed attempts included a) use of
degenerate RT-PCR primers capable of amplifying most
vertebrate and many invertebrate dystrophin-related
sequences, b) trying to bias the results of this RT-PCR
towards DRP2 by digesting the cDNA with rare-cutting
restriction enzymes targeted at the respective dystrophin/
utrophin sequences, c) use of degenerate RT-PCR primers
designed to recognise sequences specifically present in all
vertebrate DRP2s, and d) the use of samples from three
different cyclostome species (P. marinus, L. planeri and M.
glutinosa). While such negative results are necessarily
weak, our widespread success at amplifying much more
divergent sequences[15] encourages us to conclude that
the cyclostomes do not express DRP2.

The M. glutinosa and P. marinus sequences were further
extended by 3'RACE, yielding the natural stop codon
([GenBank:DQ440977] and [GenBank:DQ440978],
respectively;
the
L.
planeri
sequence,
[GenBank:DQ440979], was very similar to that of P. marinus,
as expected, and was not extended). The cyclostome
sequences were aligned with the most divergent gnathostome sequences (dystrophin, utrophin and DRP2 from
human and shark), with amphioxus dystrophin[15] as an

outgroup, and phylogenetic trees were generated (data
not shown). The cyclostome sequences consistently
diverge after the duplication leading to DRP2, and tend to
branch before the divergence of dystrophins and
utrophins. This is consistent with the failure to detect a

separate utrophin in cyclostomes, and suggests that the
gnathostome dystrophin-like molecule is a descendent of
the last common ancestor of dystrophin and utrophin. All
trees strongly support cyclostome monophyly, as has been
repeatedly found with molecular data[26]. We conclude

that the possession of distinct dystrophin and utrophin
molecules is a specifically gnathostome trait, arising from
a duplication that occurred after our divergence from
cyclostomes. The duplication which gave rise to the DRP2
gene occurred before this point in time, but after the divergence from amphioxus; thus the last common ancestor of
cyclostomes and gnathostomes had two dystrophin-like
molecules, namely DRP2 and a common ancestor of dystrophin and utrophin. We assume that the cyclostomes
have subsequently lost their DRP2 gene (see above).
The cyclostome sequences share an unsurprising set of
mosaic ancestral and derived traits. The only features that
warrant mention are the presence of exon 71 sequence,
and the absence of a substantial chunk of the conserved Cterminus. The short exon 71 of mammalian dystrophin is
alternatively spliced[27,28] and has homologues in all
gnathostome dystrophins and utrophins (where it is also
alternatively spliced[29]) but not in DRP2s or invertebrate
dystrophins. Its presence in the cyclostome sequences
shows that it arose after the duplication that gave rise to
DRP2 but before the last common ancestor of cyclostomes and gnathostomes. The cyclostome dystrophin/
utrophin sequences cease to be alignable with other members of the dystrophin family (or even with each other)
soon after the beginning of exon 76 (from human dystrophin residue 3610). This means that they lack not only
the 39-residue "ΔE78" C-terminus[30] that is present in
all gnathostome dystrophins and most invertebrate dystrophins, but also a further ~70 residues which are conserved in all dystrophins, utrophins and DRP2s. The
function of this missing region (human dystrophin residues 3610–3685) is unknown, but clearly dispensable in
cyclostomes.
Dystrobrevins
Most invertebrate metazoan genomes encode a single dystrobrevin-related molecule; the only exception that we
found to this was the two ascidians (sea squirts) Ciona
intestinalis and Ciona savignyi, neither of whose genome
sequences contains a dystrobrevin-like gene (see "Ascidians" below). Most vertebrates, on the other hand, appear
to have two dystrobrevins, as has been previously
described[9,10], named α- and β-dystrobrevin. This distinction is clear down to cartilaginous fish, where there are
single examples of each type in sequence databases; Torpedo californica sequence [GenBank:L06945] [12] is an αdystrobrevin, while Squamus acanthias EST [GenBank:CV670957] is a β-dystrobrevin. In addition to these
two vertebrate dystrobrevins, we note, to our knowledge
for the first time, the existence in bony fish of a third dystrobrevin, which we name γ-dystrobrevin.

While examining the public databases for fish dystrobrevin-related sequences, we found that all three completed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/19

teleost genomes (D. rerio, F. rubripes and T. nigroviridis)
showed evidence for three distinct dystrobrevin genes,
rather than two. One of these was clearly α-dystrobrevin,
while the remaining two seemed superficially to resemble
β-dystrobrevin. In phylogenetic analyses, one of these
tended to cluster with other β-dystrobrevins (despite
appearing to lack exons 10–13 in the syntrophin-binding
region), while the other failed to cluster with any known
vertebrate dystrobrevins, suggesting that it was a novel
paralogue. We verified the transcripts of all three dystrobrevins by RT-PCR and sequence analysis from D. rerio
whole animal RNA ([GenBank:DQ516343], [GenBank:DQ516345] and [GenBank:DQ516346]); this also
clarified and confirmed the exon structure. We named the
novel paralogue γ-dystrobrevin by extrapolation from
established nomenclature; it is well supported in several
fish species by ESTs and is often mis-annotated as β-dystrobrevin (e.g. [GenBank:AY423026]).
A more refined phylogenetic analysis (which deliberately
excluded the variable exons 9–13) clearly shows γ-dystrobrevin to represent an independent branch of the dystrobrevin family, separating from β-dystrobrevin earlier than
the divergence of fish and tetrapods. The formation of
three separate clusters (α-, β- and γ-dystrobrevin) is supported in 100% of bootstrap trials, and branching of γdystrobrevin prior to the divergence of β-dystrobrevin and
α-dystrobrevin is also robustly supported (99% of trials).
This suggests that the last common ancestor of fish and
tetrapods also had all three dystrobrevins, and that γ-dystrobrevin has been lost secondarily by tetrapods (rather
than it arising in a teleost-specific duplication event, as is
the case with many other genes[31]). Like the β-dystrobrevins, the γ-dystrobrevins share the presumed ancestral
state in lacking the α-dystrobrevin-specific C-terminal
tyrosine-rich tail and exons 9 and 12. Apart from general
sequence divergence, they have no particular features
which differentiate them from the β-dystrobrevins. It is
intriguing that while the fish β-dystrobrevins have lost
exons 10–13, the γ-dystrobrevins have retained the structure characteristic of tetrapod β-dystrobrevins (see Figure
1B).
In order to assess the gross expression of γ-dystrobrevin,
we performed in situ hybridisation of D. rerio probes complementary to the 3'UTRs of both dystrophin and γ-dystrobrevin. In 26 hours post fertilisation (hpf) embryos
these two probes showed virtually indistinguishable patterns of hybridisation to the vertical myosepta (somite
boundaries; see Figure 1C), a pattern that has previously
been reported for dystrophin[32]. Probes to neither α- nor
β-dystrobrevin yield this pattern (data not shown), suggesting that γ-dystrobrevin, like dystrophin, has a specific
role in the myoseptum. It also tallies with the fact that a
survey of the representation of the seven D. rerio super-

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:19

family members in the GenBank EST database shows that
dystrophin and γ-dystrobrevin are by far the most abundant, with 34 and 33 hits, respectively (compared with 14
for utrophin, 0 for DRP2, 3 for α-dystrobrevin, 2 for βdystrobrevin and 8 for dystrotelin), reflecting the preponderance of muscle tissue in this animal.
Alternative promoter use and splicing
The mammalian dystrophin and α-dystrobrevin genes
generate an impressive array of protein isoforms through
the elaborate use of alternative splicing[11,27-29,33],
alternative promoter use [25,34-38] and alternative transcription termination[33]. We set out to determine, by
bioinformatics and RT-PCR, whether these isoform-generation mechanisms are conserved across the vertebrate
clade (see schematic diagrams in Figure 2A and 2C, and
sequence alignments in [Additional File 1] and [Additional File 2]).
Alternative splicing of dystrophin exons 71–74
Exons 71–74 undergo complex alternative splicing (omission of exon 71, of exon 74 and of exons 71–74) in
humans and mice [27-29]. This has been proposed[39] to
regulate the stoichiometry of syntrophins in the dystrophin complex by removing their binding site(s). When
we assessed by RT-PCR whether the same occurs in
zebrafish, the only alternative splice event seen in this
region was the omission of exon 73 (Figure 2A; as previously observed[40]). Amplification of a product spanning
exons 70–74 from whole animal RNA from different
developmental stages of zebrafish showed this to be temporally regulated, such that that the inclusion of exon 73
drops from > 90% in early embryos to < 60% in juvenile
fish (Figure 2B). Thus the ability to regulate syntrophin
stoichiometry is regulated across vertebrates, but by
slightly different mechanisms. Surprisingly, given that
exon 71 is also alternatively spliced in utrophin[29,41], it
appeared not to be in zebrafish.
Alternative splicing of dystrophin exon 78
Alternatively spliced exon 78 (the penultimate exon of the
dystrophin gene) is a vertebrate-specific innovation. In its
absence (in mammalian Δ78 transcripts[27,28]), a highly
conserved open reading frame, normally in the 3'UTR of
exon 79, is brought into frame, conferring an amphipathic
alpha-helical C-terminus homologous to the constitutive
C-terminus of most invertebrate dystrophins[30]. Exon 78
itself is poorly conserved, and in bony fish even contains
an in-frame stop codon (Figure 2A). We tested whether
the temporally regulated alternative splicing of exon 78 is
conserved across vertebrates by performing semi-quantitative RT-PCR (in a reaction spanning exons 77–79) of
whole animal RNA from different developmental stages
of zebrafish. This showed a peak of exon 78 omission
(25% of dystrophin transcripts) in 24-hour embryos with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/19

> 90% inclusion in earlier and later samples (Figure 2B).
This temporal pattern shows a striking resemblance to
that described by Bies et al[27], whereby exon 78 is predominantly excluded in 14-day mouse embryos and predominantly included in adult mice (their Figure 2). In
order to establish potential determinants of such alternative splicing, we obtained publicly available sequences of
the introns surrounding exon 78, and also used whole
genome vectorette PCR to acquire the equivalent
sequence from the (more divergent) cartilaginous fish, S.
canicula [GenBank:DQ641922]. Comparison of these
sequences shows little significant conservation save in the
environs of the exon 78 donor splice site, where a conserved motif (AGAGgttrgt) surrounds an atypical consensus sequence (position +3 is T in only 2% of vertebrate
splice sites [42]; [see Additional File 2, panel A]).
Alternative splicing of α-dystrobrevin exons 9–13
Studies in human and mouse have found consistent tissue-specific alternative splicing of exons 12 and 13 of αdystrobrevin [11,33], a phenomenon which has been
shown to afford a facility for regulating the stoichiometry
of syntrophins[39], as there are syntrophin-binding sites
in exon 13 and exon 14 (these are roughly analogous to
exons 72–74 of dystrophin). We found by RT-PCR
between exons 8 and 15 of α-dystrobrevin from whole
animal zebrafish RNA that exon 12 was present in all
products obtained, the tiny 9-bp exon 9 was present in
most, but that exon 13 was missing from the vast majority
of transcripts (~90%; data not shown, see Figure 2A). This
pattern seemed not to vary significantly with developmental stage. This shows that, as with dystrophin, the ability
to modulate syntrophin stoichiometry is conserved. As
with dystrophin exon 78, we observe that all available αdystrobrevin (and β-dystrobrevin) exon 13 genomic
sequences have an unusual pyrimidine at the +3 position
in the donor splice site [see Additional File 2, Panel B]. No
alternative splicing of this region was seen in zebrafish βor γ-dystrobrevin at any developmental stage.
The dystrophin Dp260 promoter
Dp260 is an isoform encoded by exons 30–79 of the
mammalian dystrophin gene. It is expressed largely, but
not exclusively, in the retina[35,43], and its disruption is
associated with electroretinopathy in DMD patients[44].
The Dp260 promoter lies just upstream of exon 30 of the
human dystrophin gene, and we find that the N-terminal
sequence which the corresponding first exon contributes
to the Dp260 isoform is highly conserved down to
amphibia (see Figure 2C and [Additional File 1, Panel A]),
as is the adjacent genomic sequence and the size of the
isoform-specific intron (101–130 bp between Dp260
exon 1 and exon 30). The sequence is not conserved in
fish, and indeed zebrafish intron 29 is only 113 bp long.
Thus the canonical Dp260 isoform[35] seems to be spe-

Alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage
Alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage. A) Conservation of alternative splicing of dystrophin and α-dystrobrevin across vertebrates. Mammalian alternative splicing [11, 27–29, 33] and exon numbering [33, 81] are as published.
Our data show alternative splicing of dystrophin exons 73 and 78 and α-dystrobrevin exons 9 and 13 in fish. Green boxes –
coding regions in each isoform, yellow boxes – skipped coding exons, white boxes, 3'-UTR. B) Developmental profile of dystrophin alternative splicing in zebrafish, showing a steady increase in transcripts lacking exon 73 and a defined peak of transcripts lacking exon 78 early in development. Results are means of three experiments, ± SD. C) Conservation of alternative
internal promoter use in the vertebrate dystrophin and utrophin genes. The schematic diagram shows the positions of alternative first exons for the Dp260, Dp140, Dp116 and Dp71 dystrophin isoforms and for G-utrophin, all previously characterised
in mammals. Our findings show that Dp260 and Dp140 are conserved across tetrapods and that Dp116, Dp71 and G-utrophin
are conserved across all gnathostomes. For each isoform, green boxes show sequence which is protein-coding in both that
short isoform and the full-length protein, yellow ones show sequence which is coding in only one of these two, and white
shows non-coding sequence. Numbers at top give exon numbers according to the human dystrophin gene [81]. Novel frog and
fish sequences are presented separately [see Additional File 2].

cific to tetrapods and absent from fish. This is at odds with
the extremely strong 260-kDa band observed by BolañosJiménez et al[40] (their Figure 5), which may therefore
arise through a distinct but convergent mechanism. We
confirmed the existence of an amphibian Dp260 transcript, predicted from the Xenopus tropicalis genome
sequence, by RT-PCR from X. laevis RNA ([GenBank:DQ831004]; [see Additional File 1, Panel A]).
The dystrophin Dp140 promoter
Dp140 is a dystrophin isoform expressed throughout the
CNS[36]. The Dp140 promoter lies between exons 44 and
45 of the human dystrophin gene, and although the corresponding first exon splices onto exon 45, the first inframe initiation codon is not until exon 51 (though there
are multiple AUGs in other reading frames). We found
that the human, dog, mouse, chick and frog dystrophin
genes fulfil the following criteria: a) the first methionine
of Dp140 (human dystrophin Met2461), together with its
adjacent amino acid sequence in exon 51, is conserved, b)
there are no in-frame AUG codons between the start of
exon 45 and this methionine, and c) a ~2-kb region of
intron 44, including the first exon of the Dp140 transcript,
is conserved. By contrast, the zebrafish dystrophin gene a)
has no such methionine codon in exon 51 (indeed, in
zebrafish, fugu and tetraodon, exon 51 is much shorter
than in tetrapods, lacking much of the "hinge 3" region
between spectrin repeats 19 and 20), b) there are multiple
in-frame methionines in exons 45–50 (three in zebrafish,
seven in fugu) and c) not only does intron 44 lack the conserved region, but it is only 234 bp long. Thus, based on
sequence homology alone, it seems that the Dp140 isoform is likely to be conserved down to amphibia, but not
fish (Figure 2C). We confirmed the existence of an
amphibian Dp140 transcript, predicted from the X. tropicalis genome sequence, by RT-PCR from X. laevis RNA
([GenBank:DQ831006]; [see Additional File 1, Panel B]).
The dystrophin Dp116 promoter
Dp116 is a dystrophin isoform expressed largely in the
PNS and CNS [34,38]. The Dp116 promoter lies between
exons 55 and 56 of the human dystrophin gene, and we
find that the N-terminal sequence encoded by the first
exon is conserved from mammals down to zebrafish,
although different initiation codons may be used in the
different species (Figures 1A and 2C, and [see Additional
File 1, Panel C). Dp116 transcripts are poorly represented
in dbEST, perhaps because PNS as a tissue is underrepresented. We confirmed the existence of a fish Dp116 transcript by RT-PCR from D. rerio whole animal RNA
[GenBank:DQ788695]. We note the unconfirmed stop
codon in the chicken genomic sequence of Dp116 exon 1.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/19

The dystrophin Dp71 promoter
Dp71 is expressed at high levels in many tissues [37,38].
The Dp71 promoter lies between exons 62 and 63 of the
human dystrophin gene (these being the exons that
encode the WW domain), and the N-terminal sequence
which the corresponding first exon contributes to the
Dp71 isoform is conserved from mammals down to cartilaginous fish (Figure 2C and [see Additional File 1, Panel
D]). The Dp71 transcript from many species is well represented in dbEST, and has been described in mammals[37,38] and zebrafish[40]. Other than noting a single
EST extending the conservation to cartilaginous fish [GenBank:CV798132], we include it here merely for completeness.
The G-utrophin promoter
G-utrophin is a short isoform analogous in structure to
Dp116 and DRP2, expressed in the brain and sensory ganglia[25]. Although there are very few transcribed Gutrophin sequences in the databases, the first exon (and
the strongly α-helical peptide sequence that it encodes) is
exceptionally well conserved across vertebrate genomes.
We confirmed the existence of a fish G-utrophin transcript
by RT-PCR from D. rerio whole animal RNA [GenBank:DQ788696]. There is sufficient residual sequence
similarity (at the amino acid level) between this first exon
and that of the Dp116 transcript to suggest that they
derive from duplication of a single ancestral first-exon
sequence (Figures 1A and 2C and [see Additional File 1,
Panel C]). We further note the existence in the zebrafish
genome (but not in the other completed fish genomes) of
a G-utrophin pseudogene which comprises counterparts
of almost all exons from G-utrophin exon 1 to exon 71.
Although many of these exons have aberrant splice sites
and have incurred many missense mutations, it is still
actively transcribed; there is an EST [GenBank:BI982568]
which contains exons 1, 56 and 57, and we were able to
amplify a frameshifted cDNA containing exons 64, 68, 69,
70 and 71 ([GenBank:DQ831005]; [see Additional File 1,
Panel C]).
Streamlining in ascidians
Genome sequence is available for the ascidians (sea
squirts) Ciona intestinalis and C. savignyi; in addition we
have previously obtained a partial dystrophin-like
sequence from C. intestinalis by degenerate RT-PCR[15].
Examination of the urochordate genomes enables a fuller
assessment of their complement of dystrophin complex
components. The dystrophin sequence is encoded by a
single exon in each species, and is highly idiosyncratic
([GenBank:AK173373] for C. intestinalis). The length is a
mere 802 residues in C. intestinalis and 842 in C. savignyi,
these being ~75% identical to each other. These proteins
have only two spectrin repeats (orthologous to dystrophin
repeats 23 and 24), followed by the dystrophin-like series

Page 8 of 20

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:19

of WW, EF and ZZ domains; in this respect they grossly
resemble vertebrate Dp116 or DRP2 (see Figure 1A).
However, C-terminal to the ZZ domain the sequence
becomes extremely degenerate, with few recognisable
similarities to the vertebrate dystrophins. This is surprising for members of phylum chordata, given the obvious
strong homology in this region between vertebrate dystrophins and dystrophins from other phyla (molluscs,
arthropods, echinoderms and nematodes, for example[15]).
Both Ciona species have a second dystrophin-related molecule of a similar size and domain to dystrobrevins and
dystrotelins (C. intestinalis [GenBank:BR000175]. This is
similarly conserved (71% identity) between species, and
on phylogenetic analysis shows a strong tendency to cluster with vertebrate dystrotelins (see below). Another
ascidian, Molgula tectiformis, has a related, albeit shorter,
and
[Gensequence
([GenBank:CJ352374]
Bank:CJ403437]) which also clusters with the dystrotelins.
In line with the degenerate C-terminus of their dystrophin
molecules, there is no evidence for dystrobrevin- or syntrophin-related sequences in either ascidian genome,
despite their clear detectability in much more distantly
related genomes. There also seemed not to be any sarcoglycan-related sequences, though these are much harder
to detect at such evolutionary distances. Of the core dystrophin complex, therefore, only a severely N-terminally
truncated and C-terminally degenerate dystrophin, a dystroglycan, and a dystrotelin-like molecule were detectable.
It seems likely that as part of its derived biological streamlining[45,46], the ascidian has dispensed with much of its
dystrophin complex. Incidentally, the C. intestinalis dystrophin and dystrotelin sequences were identified as
"zinc-finger genes" by Miwata et al. (their Ci-ZF345 and
Ci-ZF346), and subjected to expression analysis by in situ
hybridization on developing embryos[47]. Unfortunately
neither gene yielded distinct patterns at any developmental stage.
The dystrotelin family
During this study, we noted the existence in most vertebrate genomes of exons potentially encoding a novel,
extremely divergent member of the dystrophin/dystrobrevin family. We name this dystrotelin, after its apparent
evolutionary distance from the other members of the family (ancient Greek, τηλε, distant). There were very few
ESTs corresponding to any dystrotelin from any species,
and none that are appropriately spliced. In order to confirm the expression and correct splicing of this gene, we
concentrated our efforts on human, mouse and zebrafish,
and were readily able to amplify full-length dystrotelin
cDNA from brain mRNA of these three species. We

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/19

present an alignment of known and predicted dystrotelin
sequences (Figure 3).
The mouse gene is the best characterised, and will be
described in the most detail here. It comprises 15 exons,
the first of which is non-coding. The remaining 14 exons
encode a protein of 654 amino acids and calculated
molecular weight of 74 kDa [GenBank:DQ443727]. The
mouse dystrotelin gene maps to chromosome 1, band C2.
Although transcripts could be amplified from a broad
range of tissues, exon 4 appears to be excluded from the
majority of transcripts in tissues other than the brain, giving rise to a frameshifted transcript. Semi-quantitative RTPCR of in-frame transcripts containing exon 4 (i.e. those
with a continuous open reading frame) from adult mouse
RNA samples confirmed this stronger expression in nervous and muscular tissues (Figure 4A). In situ hybridization
of part of the dystrotelin transcript to E10.5 mouse
embryos showed that embryonic dystrotelin is largely
expressed in the brain and neural tube (Figure 4B)
The human gene has a very similar structure, except that
two of the exons, despite being recognisably conserved,
have poor or absent splice sites (exon 11 has no upstream
polypyrimidine tract, and exon 12 has a GT-to-AT mutation in its donor splice site); accordingly we find these to
be absent from amplified human cDNA [GenBank:DQ516347], resulting in an in-frame loss of 75
codons. These apparent splice site defects are also present
in chimp and rhesus monkey, where we anticipate the
splicing behaviour to be similar. The resulting interstitial
deletion may have little functional impact on the protein,
however, as exon 11 is very poorly conserved and exon 12
is very small. The primate dystrotelin genes have also suffered insertion of a DSCR3 pseudogene in intron 9. The
~70-kb human dystrotelin gene maps to 2q33.3, just distal to the ADAM23 gene (207,224,590-207,291,365 in
Ensembl v39).
The zebrafish gene has an identical structure to its mammalian counterparts. The entire coding region [GenBank:DQ443726] is readily amplifiable from wholeanimal cDNA of all developmental stages.
The dystrotelin protein shows significant similarity to dystrophin (30% identity, 49% similarity) and dystrobrevin
(30% identity, 46% similarity) over the first 270 amino
acids, corresponding roughly to the EF hands and ZZ
domain. As there is 32% identity, 53% similarity between
dystrophin and dystrobrevin over the same region, the
three families of proteins appear to be equally related to
each other (see Figure 3). This level of similarity is such
that the N-terminal region of dystrotelin is expected to
form a compact globular tertiary structure grossly indistinguishable from that of the corresponding region of dys-

The dystrotelins and DAHs. Alignment of full-length sequences of dystrotelins ("Dyt") from a range of vertebrate species.
Those from H. sapiens, M. musculus and D. rerio have been confirmed by RT-PCR and sequence analysis; the remainder are predicted from genomic sequence alone. Also included for context are the N-terminal sections of C. intestinalis dystrotelin-like
protein, two insect DAH sequences, human dystrophin (Dp71 isoform; "Dys") and human α-dystrobrevin ("αDyb"; much of
the C-terminal regions of these proteins are not alignable with dystrotelins and were omitted). Vertical lines indicate exon
boundaries (the invertebrate genes are intronless). Lower case sequences in the primates indicate known (human) or expected
(chimp, rhesus monkey) exclusion of the exons from the mRNA. Colour-coded boxes indicate known structural motifs – EF
hands [48], ZZ domain [82] and coiled-coil regions predicted by COILS. Note three nonsense mutations (asterisks) in chimp
sequence. Accession numbers: H. sapiens dystrotelin, [GenBank:DQ516347]; M. musculus dystrotelin, [GenBank:DQ443727];

trophin[48]. Residues involved directly in dystrophin's
interaction with β-dystroglycan[48] [PDB:1EG4], however, are not conserved, making it unlikely that dystrotelin
interacts with this ligand.
The C-terminal domain of the dystrotelins (the ~370
amino acids that follow the ZZ domain, i.e. ~60% of the
protein) is extremely divergent, to the extent that virtually

no residual similarity is detectable between the mammalian and fish dystrotelin C-terminal domains, even using
a dotplot with lax parameters. Despite this, the exon structure (length and phase of exons) is absolutely conserved,
strongly supporting identity-by-descent, and COILS predicts that coiled-coil structures are favoured in analogous
regions of mammalian and fish dystrotelins (see Figure
3). Because of the rapid rate of divergence of the dystro-

telins, it is not possible to say whether the C-terminal
domain was derived from the C-terminus of the dystrophin-like ancestor; there is no residual statistically significant similarity. However, a region predicted to form
coiled-coils (residues 569–604 of mouse dystrotelin) contains a motif with striking resemblance to the second
coiled-coil region of dystrophins and particularly dystrobrevins (compare, for example, human dystrotelin IKERKDELEEE with human α-dystrobrevin LRQRKDELEQR),
which suggests identity-by-descent or convergent evolution. Secondary structure prediction by PSIPRED[49]
yields surprisingly coherent structures for mammalian

and fish dystrotelin C-termini despite the low sequence
similarity (like dystrophins and dystrobrevins, these are
largely α-helical and unstructured coil).
The C-terminal coiled-coil-forming regions of dystrophins and dystrobrevins have been shown to associate
with each other[19,20], an association which we have replicated using the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) technique (data
not shown). To test whether the C-terminal region (residues 258–654) of mouse dystrotelin could associate with
either of these proteins, we cloned it into the Y2H DNAbinding domain vector pBHA and co-transformed it into

Phylogenetic tree of the dystrophin/dystrobrevin/dystrotelin superfamily
Figure 5
Phylogenetic tree of the dystrophin/dystrobrevin/dystrotelin superfamily. This summary tree reflects our best estimate of the evolutionary relationships between members of this protein family. Large coloured boxes – major families within
the superfamily (the broken line reflects the tentativeness of the orthology of DAHs and dystrotelins). Lighter boxes – vertebrate family members. Asterisks – sequences described for the first time in this study. Black circle – unresolved point of divergence between dystrophins, dystrobrevins and dystrotelins. Phylogenetic distance is represented by the horizontal axis only.
This summary tree has been compiled using a selection of smaller trees based on longer sequences (which are each only applicable to the local branches) and a large tree based on the short sequences which are alignable between all family members. A
selection of methods has been used, and the tree shown reflects the consensus topology, using distances from neighbour-joining trees. The only points of equivocation were the position of the cyclostome dystrophin/utrophin branch, the position of the
γ-dystrobrevin branch, and the relationship between the DAHs and dystrotelins; the former two are described at length in the
text; the latter is left as a trichotomy. Letters A-L are a key to events described in our Conclusions. Schematic diagrams at left
and right show domain structures of respective proteins, not drawn to scale.

L40 yeast with an activation domain construct (based on
vector pGAD10) encoding the C-terminal domains of
mouse dystrophin, mouse α-dystrobrevin or mouse dystrotelin. None of these three combinations resulted in
activation of reporter genes, unlike the co-transformation
of dystrophin and α-dystrobrevin, which gave strong activation of reporter genes, reflecting the well-known interaction[19,20]. We conclude that, at least under the
conditions of our Y2H assay, dystrotelin is unable to heterodimerise with members of the dystrophin or dystrobrevin families, or to homodimerise.

In order to assess the likely subcellular localisation of dystrotelin, we cloned the entire mouse dystrotelin coding
sequence N-terminal to the EGFP coding region of
pEGFP-N2 (Clontech) and transfected it transiently into
COS-7 cells. EGFP fluorescence was then examined using
confocal fluorescent microscopy; this showed most of the
dystrotelin-EGFP fusion protein to be localised to the
cytoplasmic membrane and to perinuclear structures (Figure 4C). The latter showed substantial overlap with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) staining, but not with
mitochondrial staining (data not shown). Collection of a

z-stack of confocal images (data not shown) showed this
pattern to apply throughout the vertical depth of the cells.
Localisation to the ER is a common observation during
heterologous overexpression in eukaryotic cells, and may
be artefactual. EGFP expressed from the vector alone
showed almost entirely nuclear localisation (data not
shown). We conclude that heterologously expressed dystrotelin localises spontaneously to the cytoplasmic membrane, and possibly to the ER.
It is clear that dystrotelin is evolving rapidly compared
with other members of the dystrophin family. Ka/Ks, the
ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations, can
act as a measure of the direction and strength of selective
pressure acting on a DNA sequence via its ability to
encode a protein. We compared the Ka/Ks for vertebrate
members of the dystrophin/dystrobrevin/dystrotelin family (except for the γ-dystrobrevins). This gave Ka/Ks < 0.2
within the vertebrate clade and Ka/Ks < 0.1 between mammals for dystrophin, utrophin, DRP2, α-dystrobrevin and
β-dystrobrevin, indicative of strong purifying (negative)
selection [see Additional File 3]. In contrast, the overall
Ka/Ks for the full-length dystrotelin coding region was
0.6–0.7, an unusually high figure for a protein-coding
gene. Knowing that the second half of the protein (C-terminal to the ZZ domain) is more variable than the first
half, we divided the open reading frame accordingly and
reassessed the Ka/Ks. While the first half gives a lower Ka/
Ks of 0.4, the second half gave a Ka/Ks of approximately
unity; this is usually taken to indicate a lack of selective
pressure or a mosaic of positive and negative selection.
Because there are manifestly a number of residues within
the C-terminal domain which show strong conservation,
we favour the explanation that other residues are conversely under positive selective pressure to change. Such
pressure is often associated with gene products involved
in the immune, reproductive and cognitive systems[50,51].
It is puzzling that whereas human and rhesus monkey
(Macaca mulatta) have complete dystrotelin open reading
frames, the Ensembl sequence for chimp (Pan troglodytes)
shows the presence of nonsense mutations in three consecutive exons. The surrounding exonic and intronic
sequences are otherwise virtually identical to human. We
set out to check whether this was perhaps due to poor
local sequence quality in the Ensembl sequence by performing genomic PCR on our own chimp and gibbon
(Hylobates lar) DNA samples; this confirmed all three nonsense mutations in the chimp [GenBank:DQ640072], but
showed that the gibbon [GenBank:DQ640073], like
human and rhesus monkey, has an intact open reading
frame. It therefore appears that, bizarrely, three separate
nonsense mutations have become fixed in the chimp dystrotelin gene during the last 7 million years. This shows

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/19

that dystrotelin function is dispensible for at least one vertebrate.
The origin of the dystrotelin sequence is unclear. We
attempted to establish this by using the N-terminal region
(which is clearly shared between all dystrophins, dystrobrevins and dystrotelins) to perform a phylogenetic analysis against our most diverse sequences. All tree methods
used gave the same, well-supported result, namely that all
dystrophins (including those from the nematode and the
schistosome) cluster together, as do all dystrobrevins, to
the exclusion of the dystrotelin clade. As exon boundaries
are slow to change during evolution, we compared the
positions of exon boundaries between the alignable
region of dystrophins, dystrobrevins and dystrotelins (see
Figure 3A). By this reckoning, dystrophin shares one character uniquely with dystrotelin (the position of the E7/E8
boundary) and one with dystrobrevin (the fusion of E5
and E6), while dystrotelin and dystrobrevin share the
absence of a WW domain. This approach therefore fails to
resolve the trichotomy.
The implication of this is that the divergence of dystrotelin
pre-dates the divergence of schistosomes from other metazoa, and possibly even pre-dates the ancestral duplication
that gave rise to the separate dystrophin and dystrobrevin
families. If this is so, then dystrotelins should be detectable in invertebrates. We could find no other dystrophin/
dystrobrevin paralogues in the nematode or schistosome
genomes, but three ascidians have a paralogue which
shows some affinity to the vertebrate dystrotelins (see
above). In addition, three insects (Drosophila melanogaster,
D. pseudoobscura and Anopheles gambiae) have genes
encoding DAH (discontinuous actin hexagon[52]), which
shows a similar range of attributes to the vertebrate dystrotelins and the urochordate paralogues. Dystrotelins
and DAH share the following properties: a) a reasonably
well-conserved N-terminal series of domains shared with
the dystrophins and dystrobrevins (four EF hands and a
ZZ domain), b) a high rate of sequence divergence (fly
and mosquito DAH share ~30% sequence identity, compared with ~70% between dystrophins of these two species; these relative rates of divergence are comparable to
those for dystrotelin and dystrophin between mouse and
zebrafish), c) a very poorly constrained C-terminus with
the propensity to form two coiled-coil structures, d) a
fairly tight size-range of 640–670 amino acids, e) deep
phylogenetic branching outside all known metazoan dystrophins and dystrobrevins (see Figure 5). In summary,
given the rapid sequence divergence in these proteins, it is
conceivable that dystrotelins and DAH are orthologues,
but rather hard to prove.

Discussion
We present here a comprehensive description of dystrophin- and dystrobrevin-related sequences from available metazoan genome sequences, validated in
representative organisms by RT-PCR, or acquired de novo
by us. The work establishes the breadth of sequence diversity and identifies two novel vertebrate family members
(see Figure 5). The implications are many.
The alternative splicing that has previously been reported
in mammalian dystrophin and α-dystrobrevin serves to
determine the presence or absence of the syntrophin binding regions and of the ancestral C-terminus. However it
has been unclear whether this is an arcane mammalian
feature or a more widespread phenomenon; indeed many
alternative splicing events barely seem to be conserved
between mammals [53-55]. Here we show that the temporally regulated alternative splicing of dystrophin exons
73 and 78 is conserved in zebrafish, as is alternative splicing of α-dystrobrevin exons 13 and (to a lesser extent) 9.
These suggest that the need to modulate both syntrophin
stoichiometry and the presence of the ancestral dystrophin C-terminus are vertebrate-wide, necessitating
mechanisms that have been conserved for over 500 million years. A potential basis for the conserved splicing
behaviour is noted in a sub-optimal splice donor site at all
vertebrate dystrophin exon 78 and α-dystrobrevin exon
13 sequences [see Additional File 2]; in each case these
splice sites have a pyrimidine at base +3, normally seen in
< 4% of vertebrate donor sites[42]. Furthermore, pyrimidine +3 was also seen adjacent to all β-dystrobrevin exon
13 sequences, which are also alternatively spliced[9], but
not γ-dystrobrevin exon 13, which is not alternatively
spliced (this work; [see Additional File 2]). This suggests
that either specific mechanisms recognise this unusual
splice site in conditions when that exon is to be included
or, as has been hypothesised, that alternatively spliced
exons tend to have sub-optimal splice sites so that they
become more dependent on the binding of exonic splice
enhancers by conditionally expressed SR proteins.
Similarly, the ability of the vertebrate dystrophin and
utrophin genes to generate N-terminally truncated isoforms by the use of internal promoters has only been studied in mammals (except for the description of fish
Dp71[40]). In the case of Dp260, Dp140, and Gutrophin, relatively few studies have been performed, and
it was until now entirely conceivable that mammal-specific cryptic promoters are responsible for generating transcripts of incidental significance. We find that on the
contrary, Dp116 and G-utrophin promoters are as
broadly conserved as the Dp71 promoter, with striking
levels of conservation throughout vertebrates at the
amino acid and nucleotide level. The similarity between
Dp116, G-utrophin and DRP2 suggests that there has

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/19

been a promoter in this intron since before the serial gene
duplications which gave rise to the paralogues; indeed the
somewhat smaller sea urchin dystrophin isoform SuDp98
arises within the orthologous intron (though using an
internal translation initiation site)[56], as does the rather
larger Drosophila melanogaster dystrophin isoform
Dp205[57], suggesting that the promoter is ancient. The
situation regarding the dystrophin Dp260 and Dp140
promoters is slightly different; although we here show by
their existence in frog that they are probably conserved
throughout tetrapods, they are clearly absent in the three
available fish genomes, where the corresponding introns,
large in tetrapods, are tiny. This tallies with the observation of Neuman et al. that intragenic promoters in the dystrophin gene correlate with large introns[57]. It is possible
that the Dp260 and Dp140 promoters are more ancient
but have been lost in teleosts, which are in many respects
highly derived organisms; examining cartilaginous fish
might resolve this. It is interesting that wherever the alternative first exon encodes protein, the sequence of the latter is highly conserved [see Additional File 1], implying
specific functional importance rather than merely a means
of making a truncated protein.
Our studies of DRP2 show that the unique N-terminus is
specific to tetrapod DRP2 molecules. This N-terminus is
encoded by the first coding exon (exon 3) and the first
three-quarters of exon 4. In both bony and cartilaginous
fish, translation seems to initiate at a methionine (equivalent to human Met79) near the end of exon 4. In the case
of bony fish, there is a conserved ORF upstream of this
point, but the preceding exon has an in-frame stop codon;
it is therefore formally possible that a different isoform,
using a different upstream exon, might give rise to a
longer protein than the one we present here. In cartilaginous fish, on the other hand, there is a stop codon a mere
five codons upstream of this methionine, so no longer
protein can be produced.
Despite the absence of the N-terminal sequence in nontetrapod DRP2s, we note a weak similarity between the Ntermini of DRP2s, Dp116 and G-utrophin, including the
presence of several conserved cysteine residues and other
short motifs. Whereas the N-termini of Dp116 and Gutrophin are almost certainly descended from a single
ancestral sequence (see above), it is conceivable that the
similarities with the tetrapod DRP2 N-terminus have
arisen by convergent, rather than divergent, evolution.
The apparent conserved cysteines (often in the context Q/
NXC) suggest to us the possibility of post-translational
modification at the N-terminus of all of these proteins,
though there are no recognised consensus motifs for such
modification.

Cyclostomes, which occupy a taxonomic position intermediate between protochordates and gnathostomes, also
show an intermediate elaboration of the dystrophin family, with a single dystrophin/utrophin-like molecule. The
point of divergence of this sequence (see Figure 5)
strongly suggests that the last common ancestor of cyclostomes and gnathostomes would also have had a DRP2
protein, but we were unable to identify this in the cyclostome descendents, indicating that it may have been lost
secondarily. It may be that a Dp116/G-utrophin isoform
generated from the single dystrophin/utrophin gene has
assumed the role of DRP2.
The pared-down DGC component repertoire of the ascidians is rather surprising, given their widespread conservation across the invertebrate phyla. We detected only
dystrophin, dystroglycan and dystrotelin in the two
almost complete ascidian genome sequences. Although
we cannot rule out the existence of rather divergent sarcoglycan sequences, we are confident that the ascidians,
members of phylum chordata, lack both dystrobrevin and
the syntrophins (sequences readily detectable in D. melanogaster, C. elegans and S. mansoni). In line with this observation, the binding sites for these proteins on the ascidian
dystrophin molecule are highly degenerate, even compared with those from distant phyla. Furthermore, the
dystrophin is N-terminally truncated, being slightly
smaller than vertebrate Dp116. This is consistent with
hypotheses and observations regarding the "streamlining"
of ascidian biology [45,46], and also demonstrates that
loss of some core components of the DGC can be compatible with metazoan life.
The discovery of the novel molecule γ-dystrobrevin is
remarkable in several ways. First, its sequence reproducibly diverges before the divergence of fish and tetrapods in
both the α- and β-dystrobrevin lineages (see Figure 5). The
clear inference from this is that the last common ancestor
of fish and tetrapods must have had three dystrobrevin
paralogues, with our ancestors losing the γ-dystrobrevin
gene at a later date. Second, in fish, the β-dystrobrevin
gene has lost several exons in the central syntrophin-binding region, which the γ-dystrobrevin gene has retained
(this may account for its common mis-annotation as βdystrobrevin in the databases). Third, there are, apart
from these missing exons, no obvious differences between
the β- and γ-dystrobrevins; perhaps the salient differences
are in their patterns of expression. An intriguing possibility is that rather than regulate syntrophin stoichiometry
by alternative splicing of β-dystrobrevin exon 13 (as happens in mammals[9], but not fish), fish could achieve
essentially the same end by alternative expression of βand γ-dystrobrevin. Our preliminary analysis of the
expression of this fish-specific dystrobrevin in D. rerio
shows that its mRNA localises predominantly to the verti-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/19

cal myosepta, structures which have been the prime focus
for the study of the dystrophin complex in fish [58-60].
Full-length dystrophin, dystroglycan, and several sarcoglycans have been shown to localise to the myosepta
[58-60], as has dystrophin mRNA[32], although the
mechanism and significance of the latter is not understood. It has been assumed that the vertical myosepta are
homologues of tetrapod myomuscular and/or myotendinous junctions. Our finding of a specific gene encoding a
myoseptal dystrobrevin may aid targeted manipulation of
the dystrophin complex in muscle cells.
Dystrotelin was an unanticipated discovery, given the
high level of scrutiny of the vertebrate genome sequences.
It is likely to have evaded description because the similarity of individual exon sequences to dystrophin is barely
significant and it is poorly represented in EST databases.
There are several features of dystrotelin which prompt
immediate interest. First, the existence of a novel distant
relative of dystrophin and dystrobrevin, sharing common
core structures of these proteins yet differing from them as
much as they differ from each other (see Figure 5), obviously presents a novel opportunity for understanding the
core function of the superfamily. Second, while dystrophin and dystrobrevin have been highly conserved
throughout metazoan evolution, the more rapidly diverging sequence of dystrotelin bears testament to a very different level of functional constraint. A possible
explanation for this lower conservation is that while dystrophin and dystrobrevin form the core of an intricate
multiprotein complex, dystrotelin may act alone or in
partnership with a smaller number of proteins. Ongoing
interaction studies may help resolve this issue. It is particularly striking that despite broad conservation throughout
phylum chordata (and possibly beyond), the chimpanzee
appears not to have an intact dystrotelin gene. Third, it
seems probable (though hard to prove) that dystrotelin is
the vertebrate orthologue of DAH, a protein with an
intriguing null phenotype in Drosophila. DAH is involved
in the synchronised cellularisation of thousands of nuclei
in the syncytial early fly embryo (a specialised form of
cytokinesis); in its absence, the invaginating cleavage furrows which ultimately enfold the nuclei are severely disrupted, and development stalls[52]. DAH has been shown
to be tightly membrane-associated and highly phosphorylated in a temporally regulated manner[61], and seems
to be associated with vesicles which convene at the
extending cleavage furrow[62]. Its localisation depends
on NUF (nuclear fallout)[62], the fly orthologue of vertebrate pericentrosomal and cleavage furrow proteins
Rab11-fip3 and Rab11-fip4. A vertebrate counterpart of
the Drosophila cellularisation process is not obvious,
although dystrotelin may be involved in other forms of
cytokinesis. There is also the possibility that DAH has
another function which is masked by the severity and

early onset of the cellularisation defect. We surveyed the
literature for candidate human diseases which might be
associated defects in the dystrotelin gene; its position in
chromosomal band 2q33.3 means that it is heterozygously deleted in several patients with complex but subtle phenotypes [63], and disorders such as early-onset
osteoarthritis[64] and spastic ataxia[65] have recently
been linked to markers nearby.

Conclusion
By way of a summary, we can now sketch a broader picture of the evolution of the dystrophin/dystrobrevin/dystrotelin superfamily (see upper case letters in Figure 5).
A. The three branches of the superfamily (dystrophin, dystrobrevin and dystrotelin) originate from a single ancestral gene which had all the signature structural elements
still borne by most representatives. We believe that it
probably resembled β-dystrobrevins in gross structure. We
are not able to resolve this trichotomy by phylogenetic
means.
B. The dystrophin branch acquired a large N-terminal
extension comprising CH domains, spectrin repeats and a
WW domain. Although we cannot prove that this is an
acquired trait through gene fusion, this explanation is
more parsimonious than domain loss in the dystrobrevin
and dystrotelin branches. SMART architecture analysis[66] reveals no extant proteins with this domain architecture from which we might speculate on the nature of
the source of this material.
C. The affinity of the DAH family is uncertain, hence its
emergence from a trichotomy on the tree. However we
have advanced a number of circumstantial arguments that
it is the orthologue of the dystrotelins, and that this affinity has been masked by the rapid rate of sequence change
in this clade.
D. The invertebrate repertoire of single dystrophin, dystrobrevin and dystrotelin genes seems almost universal,
except for ascidians.
E. The streamlined genome of the ascidians (sea squirts)
lost several core components of the DGC, including dystrobrevin and both syntrophins; it retains dystroglycan,
dystrophin and dystrotelin.
F. The Dp116 region of the single invertebrate dystrophin
gene underwent a duplication in an ancestor of all craniates to give rise to DRP2 and a common ancestor of dystrophin and utrophin.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/19

vertebrate-specific exon 13, and the entire gene was duplicated to give rise to γ-dystrobrevin and a common ancestor of α- and β-dystrobrevin.
H. The dystrophin/utrophin gene in an ancestor of all
gnathostomes acquired exon 71 then underwent a wholegene duplication to give rise to separate dystrophin and
utrophin genes, including paralogous short isoforms
Dp116 and G-utrophin. The dystrophin gene acquired
exon 78 which allows it to conditionally remove the C-terminus of the protein.
I. DRP2 and the C-terminus of dystrophin/utrophin were
lost in an ancestor of extant cyclostomes.
J. The α/β-dystrobrevin gene underwent a whole-gene
duplication in an ancestor of all gnathostomes to give rise
to separate α- and β-dystrobrevin genes. The α-dystrobrevin gene gained exons 9 and 12 and those encoding the
novel C-terminus, while the β-dystrobrevin gene of fish
lost exons 10 and 13.
K. An ancestor of all tetrapods gained novel intragenic
promoters for the Dp260 and Dp140 isoforms in the dystrophin gene, and lost the γ-dystrobrevin gene.
L. Point mutations resulted in the functional loss of exons
11 and 12 in primate dystrotelin genes and disrupted the
ORF in chimpanzee.
Basal vertebrates therefore have a repertoire of seven
superfamily members (three dystrophins, three dystrobevins, and one dystrotelin), with one of these being
lost in tetrapods. Most invertebrates studied have three
members, one from each branch. The basic shared function which is implied by the common architecture of
these distantly related proteins remains unclear, but it is
our hope that this broadening of the scope of dystrophin
biology will afford ever more avenues of investigation to
bear on its elucidation.

Methods
RNA and DNA preparation
Dissected tissues or whole animal samples from mouse
(Mus musculus), rat (Rattus norvegicus), frog (Xenopus laevis), zebrafish (Danio rerio), shark (Scyliorhinus canicula),
hagfish (Myxine glutinosa), lamprey (Petromyzon marinus,
Lampetra planeri), and schistosomes (Schistosoma mansoni)
were homogenised in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and
RNA was extracted according to manufacturers' instructions. Genomic DNA was prepared from CRL-1609 chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) fibroblasts, MLA-144 gibbon
(Hylobates lar) T cell line, and shark (S. canicula) liver.

G. At a similar time, the invertebrate dystrobrevin gene
underwent a tandem duplication of exon 14 to give the

RT-PCR, RACE and sequence analysis
Nested RT-PCR[15], semi-quantitative RT-PCR[4],
5'cRACE[23], and 3'RACE combined with vectorette ligation[30] were performed as previously described. Products were either gel-purified using QiaQuick columns
(Qiagen) and sequenced directly or TA-cloned into pCR4TOPO vector (Invitrogen), after which plasmid DNA was
prepared using a Qiaprep plasmid miniprep kit (Qiagen).
Sequencing was performed using BigDye Terminator v3.1
Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and BetterBuffer (Microzone Ltd) according to manufacturers'
instructions, followed by electrophoretic analysis on an
Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA Analyser. All oligonucleotides were synthesised by MWG-Biotech ([see Additional
File 4]; degenerate oligonucleotides previously described
[15]). Quantitation of agarose gels stained with ethidium
bromide was done using a Typhoon 9200 Imager (GE
Healthcare) with ImageQuant software.
Heterologous expression and fluorescent microscopy
For analysis of subcellular localisation of dystrotelin, the
coding region (1951 bp, including 35 bp of 5'UTR and
codons 1–639) of mouse dystrotelin was ligated into the
HindIII and BamHI sites of pEGFP-N2 (Clontech), such
that it was in-frame with the EGFP coding sequence. The
construct was transfected into cultured Cercopithicus aethiops COS-7 cells using Fugene 6 transfection reagent
(Roche) according to the manufacturers' instructions.
Cells were counterstained for nuclei using Vectashield
mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc.),
for mitochondria using Mito Tracker Red CMXRos
(Molecular Probes), and for endoplasmic reticulum using
ER-Tracker Red (Invitrogen). Fluorescent images were captured using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal fluorescent microscope.
Whole mount mouse in situ hybridization
Mouse day E10.5 embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and subjected to in situ hybridisation according to
Mootoosamy & Dietrich[67]. The probe was generated
from a 673-bp cDNA encoding amino acids 24–248 of
mouse dystrotelin.
Whole mount zebrafish in situ hybridization
26 hpf Zebrafish Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, stored in methanol at 20°C and processed for in situ
mRNA hybridisation as described[68,69]. Antisense
probes or sense controls were synthesised from linearised
pCR4 plasmids with T7 or T3 polymerase (Roche) using
digoxigenin-labelling mix (Roche). The probes were generated from a 419-bp cDNA of the 3'UTR of dystrophin
and a 764-bp cDNA of the 3'UTR of γ-dystrobrevin.

Yeast two-hybrid analysis
Yeast two-hybrid analysis was carried out as previously
described[70], co-transforming pBHA-based bait constructs and pGAD10-based prey constructs into L40 strain
S. cerevisiae, and assessing interaction by the activation of
LacZ and HIS3 reporter genes (detected by ability to
hydrolyse X-gal and ability to grow on histidine-depleted
minimal medium, respectively). Constructs contained
sequences encoding amino acids 258–654 of mouse dystrotelin, 3484–3600 of mouse dystrophin, or 461–554 of
mouse α-dystrobrevin, cloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites
of pBHA and the XhoI and EcoRI sites of pGAD10.
Bioinformatics
Genomic sequences were acquired from the Ensembl
Genome Server[71] and other sequences from the databases at NCBI[72]. Sequences were curated and manipulated in BioEdit[73] and Vector NTI Suite (InforMax, Inc.).
Most phylogenetic analysis was performed using programs from the Phylip package(.)[74] within the BioEdit
platform. Ka/Ks calculations were performed using the
FUGE bioinformatics platform[75,76]. Coiled-coil
regions were predicted using COILS[77,78], and protein
secondary structure was predicted using PSIPRED[49,79].
Dotplots were performed using DOTTER[80]. Some analysis of domain architecture was done using SMART[66].
