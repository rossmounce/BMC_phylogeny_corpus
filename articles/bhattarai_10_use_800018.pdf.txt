The use of medicinal plants in the transhimalayan arid zone of Mustang district, Nepal
Shandesh Bhattarai1,2*, Ram P Chaudhary2, Cassandra L Quave3, Robin SL Taylor4

Abstract
Background: This study documents the use of medicinal plants from the Mustang district of the north-central part
of Nepal. Traditional botanical medicine is the primary mode of healthcare for most of the population of this
district and traditional Tibetan doctors (Amchi) serve as the local medical experts.
Methods: Field research was conducted in 27 communities of the Mustang district in Nepal from 2005-2007. We
sampled 202 interviewees, using random and snowball sampling techniques. After obtaining prior informed
consent, we collected data through semi-structured interviews and participant-observation techniques. Voucher
specimens of all cited botanic species were deposited at TUCH in Nepal.
Results: We recorded the traditional uses of 121 medicinal plant species, belonging to 49 vascular plant and 2
fungal families encompassing 92 genera. These 121 species are employed to treat a total of 116 ailments. We
present data on 58 plant species previously unknown for their medicinal uses in the Mustang district. Of the
medicinal plants reported, the most common growth form was herbs (73%) followed by shrubs, trees, and
climbers. We document that several parts of individual plant species are used as medicine. Plant parts were
generally prepared using hot or cold water as the ‘solvent’, but occasionally remedies were prepared with milk,
honey, jaggery, ghee and oil. Amchis recommended different types of medicine including paste, powder,
decoction, tablet, pills, infusion, and others through oral, topical, nasal and others routes of administration.
Conclusions: The traditional pharmacopoeia of the Mustang district incorporates a myriad of diverse botanical
flora. Traditional knowledge of the remedies is passed down through oral traditions and dedicated apprenticeships
under the tutelage of senior Amchi. Although medicinal plants still play a pivotal role in the primary healthcare of
the local people of Mustang, efforts to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of medicinal species are
necessary.

Background
Plants and plant products are the primary source of
medicine and a highly valued resource in Nepal. Plant
constituents continue to be a vital part of Western medicine, and are still considered an important source of
novel compounds in the field of drug discovery [1].
There are between 35,000 and 70,000 plant species that
have been used for medicinal purposes in the world [2],
and about 6,500 species of which occur in Asia [3]. In
Nepal, at least 1,600 to 1,900 species of plants are commonly used in traditional medicinal practices [4,5].
Traditional medicine in Nepal is used extensively by
majority of the population, and includes Ayurveda,

traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Unani and various
forms of indigenous medicine including Tibetan Amchi
medicine [6-9]. Traditional medicine in Nepal comprises
those practices based on beliefs that were in existence
often for hundreds to thousands of years before the
development and spread of modern medicine, and
which are still in use today [10]. In the past in many
rural areas of Nepal, traditional medicinal knowledge
and practice was passed down entirely via oral tradition
based on a lineage mode of transmission and personal
experience [11]. More recently, however, knowledge
transfer has also occurred through formally recognized
school level education [12-14].
Approximately 90% of the Nepalese people reside in
rural areas where access to government health care facilities is lacking [11,15]. It is estimated that there is a

ratio of one physician for 6,500 (1:6500) people and one
healer for fewer than 100. The physician to population
ratio of Nepal is lower then that of India (1:2000), Bangladesh (1:3500 respectively), and Sri Lanka (1:4500)
[16,17]. In Nepal, a total of 4,088 government health
posts have been established and the ratio of health posts
to the population it serves (1:5663) is very low. The
Mustang district, where field research was conducted,
has 17 health posts for a total of 14,981 people. While
the health post to population ratio (1:881) in the Mustang district is better much than the national average
(1:5663) [18], the remote location and rugged terrain do
not permit easy access to these facilities. Due to these
issues of accessibility and other socioeconomic and cultural factors, local people rely more heavily on traditional forms of medicine.
The Mustang district covers 3,639 sq. km [19] and is
located in the trans-Himalayan Arid Zone, in the MidWestern Development region of north-central Nepal
and is bounded to the south by Myagdi, to the west by
Dolpa, to the east by Manang, and to the north by the
Tibetan Autonomous region of the Peoples Republic of
China. The district lies within the Annapurna Conservation Area Project (ACAP), which covers five districts
and is the largest protected area in Nepal covering 7629
sq. km [19]. It is ranked in 17th position on the socioeconomic and infrastructural development index, 22nd in
the Health and Development Index and 42 nd in the
Health institutions density among 75 districts in Nepal
[20]. The Mustang district is mountainous with fragile
ecosystems where local biodiversity plays an important
role in meeting the basic daily needs of the indigenous
peoples inhabiting this region.
The vegetation of Mustang has been categorized into
8 types namely: mixed forest (Pinus wallichiana forest,
Betula utilis forest, Hippophae salicifolia forest, Caragana gerardiana forest, Caragana gerardiana and Lonicera spinosa forest, Juniperus forest) and grasslands with
pure stocks of Poaceae [21]. The area is characterized
by the high altitude, cold climate, semi-desert environment [22], with altitudinal variations of 1,500 to 8,000
m.a.s.l. The district has characteristic vegetation with a
freezing season of about 73-119 days (Marpha-Lo-Manthang) [23], and is dominated by shrubby and dwarf
plant communities [24]. The influence of such characteristic environmental conditions in the Himalayan
region including Mustang established favourable growth
conditions for some of the medicinal plant species at
altitudes as high as 6000-6300 m.a.s.l. [14].
Documentation of ethnobotanical knowledge of
unique plant species has gained importance in the
remote arid trans-Himalayan region of Nepal (Mustang,
Manang, Dolpa, and Tibet), which have similar geography and bioclimate [25-41]. It has been estimated that

Page 2 of 11

between 246-310 species of flowering plants are endemics to Nepal and the great majority of these species
are located in Mustang (78 species) [10,42]. Many of
these plants have been used by local indigenous people
for centuries, with medicinal uses playing an important
role in both health and culture.
Research has shown that the Mustang district is an
important area for many useful plant resources
[13,43-46] and the district has not been adequately
explored. We chose the Mustang district for this ethnomedicinal study for the following reasons: (i) The study
area is rich in diversity of medicinally used plant species
[13,47]; (ii) The society (communities) possess rich traditional knowledge (i.e. cultural diversity) [13,48]; and
(iii) There is a culture of tradition in which healers or
knowledgeable persons transmit their traditional knowledge from generation to generation, usually through
apprentices [13]. In this study, we aimed to address the
following questions: (a) How are plant resources being
used by the local communities in primary health care?
(b) Are the indigenous people involved in conservation
activities? (c) How is the traditional knowledge of indigenous people transmitted, conserved and utilized?
In remote villages of Mustang, traditional medicines
are of great importance in the primary healthcare of
indigenous people due to the lack of sufficient and reliable government health facilities and modern Western
medicines. Therefore, local plant resources are the principal source of medicine, and are prescribed by traditional healers as medicines. However, loss of biodiversity
in Nepal due to several factors may also contribute to
the loss of valuable indigenous knowledge of plants of
several indigenous communities in Nepal [49,50],
including Mustang. To overcome this problem, we have
undertaken this ethnobotanical research project with the
aim of documenting medicinal plant uses and the associated indigenous knowledge of local people of Mustang.

used to treat the same illness by several healers and villagers were selected. Voucher specimens were made for
each species collected in this study and deposited in the
Tribhuvan University Central Herbarium (TUCH), Kathmandu, Nepal. Plants were identified by two of us (SB
and RPC) with the help of standard botanical literature
[51-55]. Nomenclature of the identified species follows
standard literatures [56-61] and plant family assignments follow the current Angiosperm Phylogeny Group
[62]. Voucher specimens were also cross-checked with
previously collected herbarium specimens from the
Manang district that had been previously identified
by the National Herbarium and Plant Laboratories,

Godawari, Lalitpur (KATH) and the Royal Botanic Garden (RBGE), Edinburgh, United Kingdom.
Study Participants and Interviews

Consent for this research project was obtained in writing from the Annapurna Conservation Area Project
(ACAP), Pokhara, and prior informed consent (PIC) was
obtained verbally from each participant before they were
interviewed. The project was approved by the Central
Department of Botany Research Committee of Tribhuvan University. We followed the ethical guidelines
adopted by the ICE/International Society of Ethnobiology. We met with local community elders to explain

Bhattarai et al. Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2010, 6:14

the research project methods and intent and initiated
participant recruitment only after approval by these
community leaders. We employed random and snowball
sampling techniques to identify potential participants
and interviewed a total of 202 people (109 men and 93
women) representing a sample of the population across
age groups (Figure 2).
Study participants included individuals from various
ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds, including
Amchi healers, medicinal plant traders, farmers, hotel or
shop owners or managers, footpath traders, homemakers, and village elders. However, the traditional
senior and junior Tibetan doctors (Amchis) were the key
source of information regarding medicinal plant use.
The traditional healers of Mustang comprise senior
Amchis (Tibetan medicinal practitioners who see
patients in their clinics and teach students in medical
school), junior Amchis (student studying Amchi medicine), plant traders (traders of Mustang medicinal plants
in major cities of Nepal), and knowledgeable villagers
(including herders, farmers, hotel owners etc). The local
knowledgeable villagers, healers and Amchis interviewed
who consented to have their names and knowledge
published are listed in the acknowledgements. The

completed manuscript created as a result of this project
will be returned to the participating communities, and
copies given to key people who collaborated in the
research.
Interviews were conducted in the local Nepali or in
Gurung language dialect (translated by an interpreter),
and data was collected by direct and participant-observation of study participants in fields and forests and
through semi-structured interviews. Interview protocols
and field observations all followed standard ethnobotanical methods [63-65]. Amchis who were influenced by
deep practical knowledge of medicinal plants of Mustang district were interviewed during July 2005, September 2006 and June 2007. A total of 75 days were spent
in the study sites. At first interviews were conducted
using the ‘specimen display’ method. After collecting
plant specimens for research, we showed these fresh
specimens to the locals in order to elicit information.
The same plant specimens were shown to different people to confirm the accuracy of the results. When convenient to the participants, they were asked to accompany
the researchers for a walk, allowing for both plant collection and detailed information gathering. A consensus
index was created based on agreement in the medicinal

are popular throughout Nepal and are used to treat a
broad spectrum of ailments [12,15].
The study of the growth form of the medicinal plants
revealed that herbs made up the highest proportion of
medicinal plants represented 89 species followed by
shrubs (17), trees (11), and climbers (4) (Figure 3). Similar results were also obtained from previous studies on
the distribution pattern of life forms of medicinal plant
species in the Nepalese Himalaya. Ghimire et al. 2008
[14] revealed that 45-70% of the total naturally growing
species are long-lived herbaceous perennials followed by
shrubs (16.6%), annual/biennial herbs (15.6%), tree
(13.6%), woody climbers (6.5%), and herbaceous climbers (2.3%).
This study recorded that several parts of individual
plant species are used as medicine. The most commonly
used medicinal plant part was the root (30 species), followed by flowers (23), fruits and leaves (19 each), stem
(17), seed (11), bark and cone (2 each), and bulb (1). In
addition to the above common parts used, whole plant
(49 species, 29%), were commonly uprooted (Figure 4).
The most commonly selected plant parts may be preferential because such parts contain more active

use of the different species cited and is included in
Additional File 1.

Results and Discussion
A total of 121 species belonging to 49 vascular plant
and 2 fungal families and 92 genera were reported and
are indicative of the rich diversity of medicinal plant
species found in this area. Study results are presented in
alphabetical order by family and then followed by scientific name, voucher number, local vernacular names
(Gurung/Thakali/amchi/Nepali), phenology, and detailed
uses - including methods of preparation, dosage and
administration of medicine (Additional File 1). The largest number of medicinal species came from Asteraceae
(18), which was followed by Ranunculaceae (8), Rosaceae (7), Lamiaceae (6), and Fabaceae (5) (Table 1).
These 121 species were found to treat 116 ailments
(Table 2), 92 of which were used to treat more than one
disease and the remaining 29 species were used to treat
only one disease (Additional File 1). We have added 58
new medicinal plants, noted with asterisks (Additional
File 1), in addition to the previous works of [13,44,47].
Many of these newly added plant species for Mustang

principles in comparison to the least used parts. Leaves,
roots, stems and flowers are physically more vulnerable
to attack by herbivores or pathogens than the hardier
bark or cones and may contain more chemical defense
compounds in the form of biologically active secondary
metabolites. However, several studies have indicated
that large scale harvesting of roots, leaves, stems and
flowers can have a negative influence on the survival
and continuity of useful medicinal plants and hence
impacts sustainable utilization of plants [66].
Plant parts were generally prepared using hot or cold
water (100 species) as the solvent, but occasionally
remedies were prepared with milk (14), honey (2), jaggery (gur - unrefined, whole sugar- 2 species), ghee (2)
and oil (1) (Figure 5). The Amchi explained that water is
a common, readily available, and cheap solvent and the
good solubility of active components in water made it
commonly used in the traditional medicine preparation.
Other infusion materials such as milk, honey, oils, jaggery, and ghee are expensive and not always available
when needed. In addition, milk, oil, honey and ghee
may be used for their properties to dissolve active phytochemicals that are not water soluble.
Amchis recommended different forms of medication
including paste (60 species), powder (48), decoction
(35), tablet (7), pills (5), cold infusion (5), and others
(Figure 6). This study often recorded the use of paste,
powders and decoctions in comparison to tablet, pills
and infusions. Most often standard medicines are

prescribed in mixed ingredient form by mixing several
valuable medicinal plants and additives. Amchi believe
that using plant mixtures in the preparation of a medicine is important as a single plant alone may not be sufficient to cure any disease completely, whereas the
combination of several medicinal plants increases the
quality and efficacy of medicine. Similar observations
have also been recorded amongst the Kani communities
in India [67].
Certain zootherapeutic remedies, or medicines based on
animal products, were also recorded. Some common animal products used in the creation of medicines included
tortoise bones and the horn and urine of the Himalayan
musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster). The Amchi traditional
method of maintaining the good quality of herbal

medicine is unique. For centuries, Amchi have been storing herbal medicine in a bag created from the skin of
M. chrysogaster skin, which is tied twice with thread.
Tying the herbal medicine in M.chrysogaster skin allows
it to remain effective for one to two years. Amchi use a
stone slab in place of the electric grinder in the preparation of medicine because they feel that heat created by
the grinder may degrade the active chemical constituents
of plant powder and thus reduce the quality of the medicine. The powder is then mixed with water and a sufficient amount of additives - honey, jaggery, etc. Additives
are added according to the need of the specific plant
powder to aid with the shape of the prepared pills
(rounded, rectangular, etc). The process of boiling continues and complete evaporation of the water makes it
easy to form the medicinal mixture into the preferred
shape.
The medicinal plant preparations were administered
to the local people of Mustang through different routes
including oral, topical, nasal and others. Oral (115 species) was the most commonly used route of administration, and was followed by topical (36), nasal and others
(12) (Figure 7). Similar observations have also been
obtained in other ethnobotanical studies [66,68].
Amchis always collect local medicinal plants themselves.
They stress that this is very important because they have
extensive experience in the identification of Himalayan
medicinal plants. They worry that a misnamed or falsely
collected sample may be dangerous and cause the death
of a patient. This is particularly true in the case of Aconitum orochryseum and A. spicatum (Ranunculaceae).

The 121 medicinal plant species recorded from Mustang were also used in miscellaneous categories of uses
and hence such additional uses have added the value to
medicinal plant species. The majority of medicinal plant
species were used for food (33 species), fuelwood (27),
fence (24), fodder and ritual & religious (19 each), decoration (8), organic manure (7), dyes & soap and psychoactive (3 each), and construction (2). However, many
(50 species) have only medicinal use (Figure 8).
Most of the documented medicinal plant species were
collected from wild habitats where very few species like
Allium carolinianum, Allium wallichii, Prunus armeniaca, etc. were also cultivated for regular use. Medicinal plant species were used both in dried and fresh
forms and are also collected and stored for future purpose. Autumn has been considered the best season for
the collection of roots and spring for collection of
stems. Important days or months for the collection of
individual plants vary greatly and are known best by
Amchi. The time of collection of plant parts for medicine is also very important in capturing the active principles. Therefore, Amchi strictly collect specific plant
parts during a specific time and use them to prepare
traditional medicine. Overall, the majority of locals consider Amchi medicines and medical system to be effective and local people have a deep faith in them.
Several medicinal plants including Allium wallichii,
Aconitum orochryseum, Cordyceps sinensis, Dactylorhiza
hatagirea and Neopicrorhiza scrophulariiflora are collected from the local habitat as a source of cash income.
Such illegal mass collection of the important species is a
type of unsustainable harvesting which leads to the

A. spicatum is highly poisonous and is difficult to differentiate from Aconitum orochryseum. Using the wrong species by mistake can result in death. The medicine from
this plant can only be prepared by highly experienced
Amchi. Medicine must be made by Amchi with other
medicinal plants of the Himalaya, so that the poison of
that plant is inactivated without inactivating the other
medicinal properties. In Mustang, A.spicatum whole plant
(mainly root) is used to make medicinal tablets by the
Amchi to treat infected wounds; as a tonic to provide relief
from general weakness; to counteract the effects of poison,
including inappropriate self medication, poison ingested
on purpose or accidentally, poisonous animal stings or
bites; boils; fever; allergy and edema. It is never used alone
and is always mixed with several other medicinal plants of
the Himalaya. A paste of the roots is applied for allergy,
boils, cuts, wounds and edema after mixing with other
medicinal plants.

exploitation from the natural habitat in the future.
Therefore over-harvesting of important medicinal plants
should be prohibited and monitored and immediate
conservation and management approaches should be
followed for the sustainable use of natural ecosystem of
Mustang.

Conclusion
Traditional Amchi medical practitioners maintain a
great depth of knowledge on the subject of medicinal
plants. Medicinal plants still play a pivotal role in the
primary healthcare of the local people in the study area.
Due to the lack of Western medicine, modern government health posts, difficult geography of the district as
well as a strong cultural belief in the power of folk medicines, the Amchi system serves as a popular provider of
primary healthcare in Mustang. Although such healthcare practices have been in place for centuries in Mustang, they are at risk of being lost to future generations.
This is due primarily to changes in socioeconomics of
the region as younger generations are eager to migrate
outside the country for employment. The continued
practice of training as an Amchi apprentice is necessary
for the survival of this traditional medical knowledge.
Although local efforts to conserve medicinal plant
resources are still inadequate, the long held traditional
beliefs of the population regarding folk medicine has its
own unintentional role in conservation, management
and sustainable utilization. While over-harvesting of
some important medicinal plants has increased, many
Amchi are working towards both biological conservation
of the medicinal plants through sustainable harvesting
and protection of wild species and conservation of their
cultural heritage. In some villages (Lete, Lomanthang,
etc), people have started to conserve medicinal plants by
domesticating them in home gardens, but these efforts
make up only a small portion of measures necessary to
conserve these species. The involvement of local communities and local stakeholders with effective monitoring of the local community resources will be the
fundamental ingredient of in situ conservation of medicinal plants in Mustang. Over-harvested populations of
medicinal plants from natural habitats can be improved
with the aid of collaborative research projects between
the local indigenous people and national and international partners having associated experts.
