Abstract
Background: Proteins containing FERM domains comprise a diverse group of eukaryotic proteins
that bind membrane proteins and lipids. In doing so, they organise membrane microstructure, and
coordinate the disposition of signalling and cell adhesion complexes. In protein 4.1R,
phosphorylation adjacent to the FERM domain regulates its activity, and membrane mechanical
properties.
Results: A novel sequence domain has been detected in a subset of proteins that contain FERM
domains. This subset includes the true 4.1 proteins, some tyrosine phosphatases, rho-GEF proteins
and type II transmembrane proteins, as well as some uncharacterised FERM proteins. This FERMadjacent region is always closely proximate to the C-terminal of the FERM domain. This sequence
is likely to be folded with elements of α and β structure. The FERM-adjacent region of 4.1R contains
serine residues phosphorylated by PKC and PKA; these appear conserved in about half of all other
FERM-adjacent regions. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that all proteins containing a FERM-adjacent
region arose from a single ancestor after FERM domains had started to proliferate in genomes of
animals, plants and mycetozoa.
Conclusion: The FERM-adjacent region defines a subset of the FERM proteins in animals. The
conservation of motifs in this region that are potential substrates for kinases together with the
known regulatory phosphorylation of 4.1R in this region raises the possibility that the FERMadjacent region is a regulatory adaptation in this subset of the FERM proteins.

Introduction
FERM domains define the band 4.1 superfamily [1]. The
domain takes its name from the 4.1 (four point one) and
ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) proteins where it was first
discovered [1], but many metazoan cytoplasmic proteins
that associate with membranes contain FERM domains:
such proteins include merlin, talin, KRIT1, the uncoventional myosins VIIA, X and XV, certain non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases (e.g. the FAK and JAK kinases) and
phosphatases (e.g. PTP-E1 and PTP-H1). A few examples

of FERM domains are also found in mycetozoa and
plants. This family is of great interest from several points
of view. Several members of the family are tumor suppressors (4.1R, 4.1B, merlin) [2]. More generally, this family
carries functions that reflect many of the distinctive features of eukaryotic – and most especially animal – life,
including tissue-specific signalling through organisation
of membrane domains, mechano-protection of membranes from the stresses of animal movement and partici-

The FERM-adjacent (FA) region
The FERM-adjacent (FA) region. An HMM for the FA region was used to search the Uniprot non-redundant database. The
alignment shown here represents sequences detected with the HMM in human, D. melanogaster and C. elegans. The alignment
was generated by aligning the sequences to the HMM using HMMALIGN. The sequences shown are all adjacent to the C-terminal end of FERM domains, but not all FERM domains are adjacent to this sequence. Note the presence of a protein kinase A
consensus sequence [KR][KR][X][ST] (boxed) in human protein 4.1R (41_HUMAN): the serine (asterisked) in this motif is a
physiological PKA substrate. A PKC substrate site is also marked. In 4.1G (E41L2_HUMAN) another serine is phosphorylated
in vivo (white asterisk). Secondary structure predictions generated are shown below the alignment. Jpred: E beta-strand; H

domains suggests they do not function independently,
but rather form a co-ordinated structure.

FERM domains have three-lobed 'cloverleaf' structures;
each lobe represents a compactly folded structure. Lobe A
(the most N-terminal) has a fold resembling ubiquitin;
lobe B (the central lobe) resembles acyl-CoA binding proteins; and lobe C (the most C-terminal) has a fold related
to pleckstrin homology domain/phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) [4-10]. The close packing of these

FERM domains bind a variety of protein and lipid ligands.
For example, in 4.1R, lobe A binds the anion exchanger
AE1 (band 3), lobe B binds the PDZ and guanylate kinase
protein p55 and lobe C binds glycophorin C [6]. The
motif YKRS in Lobe C is required for phosphatidylserine
(PS) binding to 4.1R; this motif is required for correct
intracellular targeting of 4.1R [11]. In the ERM proteins,

Figure 2
Examples of classes of proteins containing the FA region
Examples of classes of proteins containing the FA
region. The figure shows the modular organisation of FA
region proteins in schematic outline. The proteins all contain
FERM domains in their N-terminal region (although splice
variation at certain N-termini can add extra sequence
upstream of the FERM domain). On the C-terminal side of
the FERM and FA regions are diverse sequences. Examples
shown are as follows. (a) The true 4.1 proteins have a C-terminal domain (CTD) that binds receptors; and in mammals a
spectrin-actin binding domain (SAB) promotes the binding of
spectrin to actin. There are four such in vertebrate genomes,
and one such in invertebrate genomes. (b) A group of poorly
characterised proteins (two in vertebrate genomes, one in
invertebrates) have FERM and FA regions, plus transmembrane segments in their C-terminal regions. They have no Nterminal signal sequences, and appear to be Type II membrane proteins. (c) The non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase
protein PTP-MEG1 in mammals, PTP-MEG (split central complex) in fly and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1 in worm are
non-receptor tyrosine phosphatases localised at membranes;
they have roles in control of cellular proliferation and control of interaction with extracellular matrix. Notably, the FA
region was not found in the other FERM domain phosphatases PTPH1, PTP-E1 and PTP36. (d) CDEP is a GEF for
Rho family GTPases. The FA region is also found in the
related FARP2 gene product. (e) A variety of other proteins
lack further domains recognised by SMART or Pfam. These
include Band 4.1-like protein 5 and NBL-4.

the head group of PIP2 binds a basic cleft between lobes A
and C; this binding displaces the ERM tail from the FERM
domain [4] thus unmasking the binding site for cell adhesion molecules (such as ICAM1-3 and L1) on lobe C [12].
The first observation of what is now known as the FERM
domain came when Leto et al. [13] subjected 4.1R to limited chymotryptic proteolysis. The FERM domain was
released as a 30 kDa fragment. Another protease-resistant
fragment released in this experiment was 16 kDa. This
region lies between the FERM domain and another impor-

Mammals have four "true" 4.1 proteins: 4.1R, 4.1N, 4.1G
and 4.1B. Sequence alignment revels considerable identity between the N-terminal half of their 16 kDa regions,
although the C-terminal halves are much less conserved
[17]. Here, I investigate the nature of the conserved part of
the 16 kDa region. I report that sequences strongly similar
to the conserved part of the 16 kDa region are present in
a subset of the 4.1 superfamily. This region seems to form
a discrete FERM-adjacent region, with the potential to regulate the activities of its neighbouring FERM domain.

Results and discussion
Identification of the FERM-adjacent region
The FERM domain in human protein 4.1R [SwissProt:41_HUMAN] is now defined as residues 285–488 by
X-ray crystallography [PDB:1GG3] [6]. The 16 kDa fragment lies directly adjacent to the FERM domain: residues
494–614.

Sequence alignment of the four mammalian "true" 4.1
proteins, 4.1R, 4.1B, 4.1G and 4.1N, reveals that a high
level of sequence identity extends beyond the end of the
FERM domain, and into the 16 kDa region [17]. To
explore this further, I compared the 16 kDa region of
human 4.1R with the sequences of other mammalian
4.1R, 4.1G, 4.1N and 4.1B proteins available in the Uniprot Knowledgebase (Swis-Prot/Trembl) [18]. This
revealed a region of strong conservation over approximately 60 amino acid residues at the N-terminus of the 16
kDa region. 60 amino acids is a large enough region to
fold, and is similar in size to known folding structures
such as the SH3 domain.
To explore the prevalence of this region, the aligned
sequences were used to make a hidden Markov model
(HMM) that can be used as a profile of the alignment for
database searching. An HMM search of Uniprot SPTR
revealed further proteins with analogous sequences. These
sequences were retrieved, and incorporated into the alignment with the true 4.1 proteins. This expanded alignment
was used to generate a new HMM which was used to research the database. A third iteration of align sequences/
build HMM/search database was performed. The HMM
from this reveals no more significant database hits. The
full list of sequences detected in given in Table 1 (Additional file 1). Some representative sequences detected by
the expanded HMM are shown in Fig. 1.

Strikingly, all the sequences recognised by the HMM are
immediately adjacent to a FERM domain. However, they
are clearly distinct from FERM domains in that the HMM
does not recognise the sequence of any known FERM
domain. The HMM detects no proteins whose structures
are represented in the Protein Databank. For simplicity, I
shall refer to sequences recognised by the HMM as FERMadjacent (FA) regions.
The HMM hits include only a minority of members of the
4.1 superfamily. The hits include: (a) the "true" 4.1 proteins; (b) a poorly characterised group of proteins with
signal-anchor transmembrane sequences close to their Ctermini; (c) a subset of the non-receptor tyrosine phosphatases (e.g. PTP1 of C. elegans, and human PTN4); (d)
CDEP, a GEF for Rho family GTPases; (e) a number of
proteins with only FERM and FA regions, including NBL4
[Swiss-Prot:E41LA_HUMAN]
and
E41L5
[SwissProt:E41L5_HUMAN]. The domain structures of these
proteins are summarised in Fig. 2.
All the sequences detected are in animal proteins with one
exception. [Trembl:Q8GUI3] is an Arabidopsis thaliana
hypothetical protein which contains a FERM domain, and
a weak hit (E = 0.00042) is detected adjacent to this. No
other plant or mycetozoan protein is detected.
Importantly, many well-characterised members of the
band 4.1 superfamily are not detected by the HMM: in
particular the ERM proteins, merlin, talin, unconventional myosins and non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases
were not found.
A more extended alignment of several FERM proteins that
contain the FA region in comparison with representative
proteins that do not contain the FA region illustrates the
limits of the FA region. Additional file 2 shows the
sequences of several human proteins aligned to the
sequence of 4.1R Lobe B of the FERM domain through the
whole 16 kDa sequence. Note that the FA region is
detected as a discrete sequence region corresponding to
the N-terminal half of the 16 kDa fragment in class A-E
proteins, and that no sequence similarity is detected in
other proteins.
Is the FA region folded?
FA regions seem likely to be compactly folded since the
4.1R 16 kDa fragment is resistant to chymotrypsin [13],
despite containing several possible substrate residues (see
sequence 41_HUMAN in Fig. 1).

To predict secondary structures, the alignment of all FAs
was submitted to JPRED; 4.1R sequence was also submitted to PSI-Pred and Disopred. An α-helix and β-strand and
a certain amount of disordered structure are predicted,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/85

and the most conserved part of the sequence in the FA
alignment is predicted to be buried (annotated on Fig. 1).
But the structure cannot be predicted with certainty,
because the HMM recognises no sequences of proteins of
known structure in the Protein Data Bank. Furthermore,
the fold-recognition programmes PSI-Pred and 3D-PSSM
do not detect a known fold.
A single evolutionary event links FERM and FA proteins
The presence of a single FA region in a subset of all FERM
domain proteins raises the question of their evolutionary
origin. Do these proteins derive from a single ancestral
FERM protein that acquired an FA region at some point
after FERM domains started to multiply in animal, plant
and mycetozoan genomes? If the answer to this question
is "yes", then the FA-containing subset of the superfamily
should have FERM domains more closely related to each
other than to non-FA-containing proteins.

To address this, a structurally well-conserved part of the
FERM domain, lobe B, was subjected to phylogenetic
analysis. To define sequences homologous to lobe B, the
sequences of lobe B that are defined structurally in the
PDB (from protein 4.1R, merlin, ezrin, radxin, moesin,
talin) were used to make another HMM specific for lobe
B. Searching Uniprot with this HMM defined lobe B in the
majority of known members of the superfamily. The
sequences of lobe B were then aligned to the HMM and
their phylogeny analysed. Parsimony, maximum likelihood and neighbour joining trees were constructed. Fig. 3
shows a consensus maximum likelihood tree generated by
Phylip from lobe B sequences that had been bootstrapped
100 times. In each case, the FERM/FA proteins were found
to derive from a single node. This supports the hypothesis
that FERM/FA region proteins arose from a single ancestor
that acquired a FA region adjacent to its FERM domain.
Identical conclusions can be drawn from the maximum
likelihood and neighbour joining trees (not shown). Note
that groups (a) -(e) from Fig. 2 largely cluster together in
this tree. As might be predicted, the overall domain structures of the proteins are mirrored in the phylogeny of the
FERM domains.
Interestingly,
the
phosphatase
PTN3
[SwissProt:PTN3_HUMAN] does not contain an FA region, yet
appears in the FA group. Direct alignment of this sequence
with that of the related phosphatase PTN4 [SwissProt:PTN4_HUMAN] leaves a gap where the FA region
would be (see Additional file 2); furthermore, probing all
possible translations of the genomic sequence of PTN3
with the FA region HMM reveals no FA sequence that
might be expressed in splice variants. Maximum parsimony and neighbour joining analyses (not shown) support the positioning of PTN3 in the FA cluster. It seems

a non-redundant selection of FERM domain lobe B sequences. The grey shading lies over proteins that contain both FERM and

most likely that PTN3 has lost the FA region present in the
common ancestor of PTN3 and PTN4.
PKC and PKA phosphorylation sites
It has long been established that protein kinases A and C
phosphorylate the 16 kDa portion of erythrocyte 4.1R
[14,15]. Protein kinase C regulates the membrane binding
activity of the 4.1R FERM domain [15,19-21]. Recently
Manno et al. [16] have shown that PKC phosphorylates
ser-312 in erythrocyte 4.1R (isoform 3 [IPI:IPI00218698];
the
equivalent
sequence
number
in
[SwissProt:41_human] is ser-521). The site in the 16 kDa portion phosphorylated by PKA is ser-331[14]. Both these
residues are part of the FA region.

Ser-312 is not in a known PKC consensus, so it is difficult
to predict if equivalent residues in other proteins will be
PKC substrates. However, Fig 1 indicates that about half of
the FA region proteins have ser at equivalent positions in
the alignment.

Ser-331 is in the protein kinase A substrate motif, [KR]
[KR]X [ST], and this is conserved in all mammalian "true"
4.1 proteins. It is also conserved in some of the group that
lacks known functional domains in their C-termini (e.g.
E41L5) and in some of the group of transmembrane proteins (see Fig. 1).
Protein 4.1G [Swiss-Prot:E41L2_human] is also phosphorylated in vivo in the FA region at ser-550 [22]. The kinase
that catalyses this phosphorylation has not been identified. Representatives of each of groups (a)-(e) contain ser
or thr at this point in the alignment, indicating that this
too is a candidate site for phosphorylation in other FA
proteins.

Conclusion
The FA sequence region described here is in all cases
immediately adjacent to FERM domains. Based on the
chymotrypsin resistance of the 16 kDa 4.1R fragment, and
secondary structure predictions, it seems likely that FA

regions are folded. The FA region of 4.1R is phosphorylated in vivo by PKA and PKC. The latter phosphorylation is especially important in the red cell, since
phosphorylation of ser-312 controls the activity of the
adjacent FERM and spectrin-actin binding domains which
in turn controls the mechanical properties of the red cell
membrane [16]. Since representatives of all the five
groups of FA proteins contain ser/thr at sites equivalent to
those phosphorylated in the 4.1R and 4.1G FA regions,
the possibility arises of a general role of the FA region in
regulating the activities of their neighbouring FERM
domain.

Methods
Sequences were retrieved from the UniProt Knowledgebase via the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) [23].
BLAST analyses were done with either the BLAST2 server
at EBI [24] or the BLAST server at the National Center for
Biotechnology Information [25]. The HMMER package
[26,27] was used for hidden Markov model analysis; it
was run either locally or via a server made available by the
Medical Research Council's Rosalind Franklin Centre for
Genomics Research [28]. Alignments of sequences to
HMMs were done using HMALIGN; alignments were displayed using Chroma [29]. Secondary structure predictions were made using JPRED [30,31]. PSI-Pred [30,32]
and Disopred [33,34]. Fold recognition was done using
the PSI-PRED and 3D-PSSM [35,36] servers. For phylogenetic analyses, the Phylip package [37] was used.
