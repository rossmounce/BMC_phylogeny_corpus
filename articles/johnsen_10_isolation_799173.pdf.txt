Isolation, characterization and heterologous
expression of a novel chitosanase from
Janthinobacterium sp. strain 4239
Mads G Johnsen1, Ole C Hansen1, Peter Stougaard2*

Abstract
Background: Chitosanases (EC 3.2.1.132) hydrolyze the polysaccharide chitosan, which is composed of partially
acetylated b-(1,4)-linked glucosamine residues. In nature, chitosanases are produced by a number of Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as by fungi, probably with the primary role of degrading chitosan from fungal
and yeast cell walls for carbon metabolism. Chitosanases may also be utilized in eukaryotic cell manipulation for
intracellular delivery of molecules formulated with chitosan as well as for transformation of filamentous fungi by
temporal modification of the cell wall structures.
However, the chitosanases used so far in transformation and transfection experiments show optimal activity at high
temperature, which is incompatible with most transfection and transformation protocols. Thus, there is a need for
chitosanases, which display activity at lower temperatures.
Results: This paper describes the isolation of a chitosanase-producing, cold-active bacterium affiliated to the genus
Janthinobacterium. The 876 bp chitosanase gene from the Janthinobacterium strain was isolated and characterized.
The chitosanase was related to the Glycosyl Hydrolase family 46 chitosanases with Streptomyces chitosanase as the
closest related (64% amino acid sequence identity). The chitosanase was expressed recombinantly as a periplasmic
enzyme in Escherichia coli in amounts about 500 fold greater than in the native Janthinobacterium strain.
Determination of temperature and pH optimum showed that the native and the recombinant chitosanase have
maximal activity at pH 5-7 and at 45°C, but with 30-70% of the maximum activity at 10°C and 30°C, respectively.
Conclusions: A novel chitosanase enzyme and its corresponding gene was isolated from Janthinobacterium and
produced recombinantly in E. coli as a periplasmic enzyme. The Janthinobacterium chitosanase displayed
reasonable activity at 10°C to 30°C, temperatures that are preferred in transfection and transformation experiments.

Background
Chitin, a polymer of acetylated b-(1,4)-linked glucosamine (GlcNAc) residues, is the second-most abundant
polysaccharide in nature, where it constitutes the major
structural component in a number of organisms, e.g.
crustaceans, insects, nematodes and fungi. Chitosan,
which is a partly deacetylated form of chitin, is less
abundant but may be found in the cell wall of certain
fungi, e.g. Zygomycetes [1,2] and green algae like Chlorella [3]. Chitin and chitosan have similar molecular
structures, since both polysaccharides are made up of b* Correspondence: psg@life.ku.dk

(1,4)-linked glucosamine (GlcN) residues, which are 50100% acetylated (chitin) or 0-50% acetylated (chitosan)
[4]. In recent years, interest in oligosaccharides derived
from chitin and especially from chitosan has increased
considerably because these oligosaccharides are watersoluble and possess useful biological activities like antitumor and antimicrobial activities [5-10]. The oligosaccharides may be produced by chemical treatment of
polymeric chitosan or may be derived from enzymatic
hydrolysis of chitosan.
Enzymes capable of hydrolyzing chitosan, chitosanases
(EC 3.2.1.132), may be found in a number of organisms,
particularly in microorganisms. Chitosanases are classified into five glycoside hydrolase families: GH-5, GH-8,
GH-46, GH-75 and GH-80 [11]. Enzymes from families

GH-5 and GH-8 may hydrolyze a number of other glycosides besides chitosan, whereas glycoside hydrolase
families GH-46, GH-75 and GH-80 only comprise chitosanases. Among these true chitinases, the chitosanases
from Streptomyces and Bacillus have been studied in
detail with respect to e.g. catalytic features and molecular structure [12-15]. In addition to members of the genera Streptomyces and Bacillus, chitosanases have been
isolated from a number of other Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria e.g. Acinetobacter sp. [16], Amycolatopsis sp. [17], Serratia marcescens [18], Pseudomonas sp. [19], Nocardioides sp. [20], Microbacterium sp.
[21], as well as from fungi, e.g. Gongronella sp. [22],
Aspergillus oryzae [23] and Fusarium solani [24].
Normally, gene delivery using chitosan microparticles
will result in low transfection frequency compared to
liposome mediated gene delivery [25]. However, recently
it has been shown that gene delivery of DNA complexed
with chitosan into mammalian cells may be enhanced if
a fungal chitosanase gene is co-expressed inside the cells
[26]. Similarly, hydrolytic enzymes, e.g. chitosanases, are
used for transformation of filamentous fungi by modification of the cell wall structure, making the cell more
accessible. So far, the chitosanases, which have been
used in such transformation and transfection experiments, have shown optimal temperatures around 60°C,
and the enzymes are hardly active at the low temperatures, which are preferable in transfection and transformation experiments. Therefore, we have screened a
bacterial strain collection from Greenland and isolated a
chitosanase-producing, cold-active Janthinobacterium
sp. isolate. In this paper, we describe the isolation and
characterization of a new chitosanase and we show that
the enzyme may be produced heterologously in Escherichia coli resulting in high yields.

Results
Isolation of chitosanase enzyme and gene from
Janthinobacterium sp

Three thousand bacterial isolates were screened for chitosanase activity on agar plates with chitosan. Thirty isolates were found to produce clear haloes around the
colonies after four days of incubation at 20°C. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolates, which produced
the largest haloes were related to Janthinobacterium,
Pedobacter and Eubacterium. One isolate, no. 4239,
from a fresh water lake close to Kangerlussuaq in West
Greenland produced the largest clearing haloes and was
selected for further investigations. Phylogenetic analysis
by 16S rRNA sequencing showed that the isolate was
affiliated to the genus Janthinobacterium. A gene library
of Janthinobacterium sp. 4239 was constructed in
pUC18 in E. coli and plated onto agar medium including
chitosan. After four days of incubation at 20°C, two

Page 2 of 9

transformants, which produced small haloes, were identified. Restriction enzyme analysis indicated that the
plasmids in the two clones were identical, and one of
the plasmids, pMGJ1061, was selected for subsequent
sequence analysis and subcloning. Sequencing of the
insert revealed two open reading frames, one encoding
the chitosanase (Fig. 1) and one encoding a putative
aspartate decarboxylase with reverse orientation (not
shown). The open reading frame coding for a chitosanase contained two ATG codons that may both work as
translation start codons. Initiation at the first ATG
codon (bp 749-751) will result in a polypeptide of 291
amino acid residues (876 bp) including a signal peptide
of 24 amino acid residues as determined by SignalP and
LipoP algorithms. The amino acid residues around the
proposed cleavage site showed similarity to lipoprotein
like sites for signal peptidase II cleavage (Fig. 1). Initiation at the second ATG codon (bp 848-850) results in a
polypeptide of 258 amino acid residues comprising a
putative signal peptide of 18 amino acid residues with a
lipoprotein like site for signal peptidase I cleavage (Fig.
1). BLASTP analysis of the mature 267 amino acid polypeptide starting at the first initiation codon showed
similarity to glycosyl hydrolase family 46 chitosanase
sequences (Streptomyces sp. 63% [GenBank:P33665] and
64% [GenBank:ZP_05001348]; Streptosporangium
roseum 64% [GenBank:ZP_04476321]; Amycolatopsis sp.
64% [GenBank:BAA94840]). Detailed studies of the
Streptomyces chitosanase protein structure have emphasized the importance of certain amino acid residues in
relation to catalysis and structure. The equivalent amino
acid residues of the Janthinobacterium sp. 4236 chitosanase are shown in bold in the protein sequence presented in Fig. 1.
Heterologous expression of Janthinobacterium
chitosanase in E. coli

The part of the gene encoding the mature protein (267
amino acids), initiated at the first start codon but without the signal sequence, was further subcloned into an
expression vector. In this plasmid, named pBMS172, the
chitosanase gene was fused with E. coli ompA sequence,
substituting the native Janthiobacterium signal sequence.
Transformants with plasmid pBMS172 showed haloes
around the colonies, confirming that the fragment
encoded a polypeptide with chitosanase activity. Denaturing zymographic gel electrophoresis and activity
staining revealed that the mature secreted product
found in the periplasm of BMS172 migrated to a position corresponding to that of the native chitosanase product of 33 kDa (Fig. 2A), isolated from growth medium.
In a similar gel system not including the chitosan substrate the same recombinant chitosanse migrated to a
position corresponding to 31 kDa, which is in closer

numbers and amino acid numbers are indicated, omitting the first 24 amino acid residues suggested to function as a signal peptide. The
translation initiation codon (ATG) and the stop codon (TAA) of the open reading frame are shown in bold. A predicted signal peptidase II

and the corresponding signal peptidase I recognition sequence and cleavage site is underlined with gray. Amino acid residues believed to have

Asp84), D (Ile76;Glu226) and E (Tyr62) are conserved among chitosanases with residues in subsites C and E as characteristics of glycosyl hydrolase
family 46. Also the catalytic glutamic acid (Glu50) is conserved but the corresponding aspartic acid which is conserved among other chitosanases
could not be identified here. The alternative active site residues (Glu64 and Thr72; [29]) are indicated in bold. Protein stabilizing residues identified
in other chitosanases were also found to be conserved here (Trp56;Trp128;Arg235;Trp257) [12,13].

agreement with the size of 29 kDa deduced from the
sequence analyses (Fig. 2B). The sub-cellular distribution
of the chitosanase activity was investigated by determining the enzyme activity in fractionated cellular compartments. Recombinant E. coli harbouring plasmid
pBMS172 expressed chitosanase activity in about 500
fold greater amounts per cell when compared to the
native Janthinobacterium sp. 4239 isolate (Table 1).
From 50 ml of flask culture a raw periplasmic extract of
1.25 ml was obtained. This extract contained 6.0-6.5 mg

recombinant chitosanase protein and provided 3.0-3.5
mg highly purified chitosanase product. Over-expression
of chitosanase and periplasmic accumulation of the
enzyme posed considerable stress on the E. coli transformant. This effect was evident from the high ratio
observed between periplasmic and cytoplasmic activity
of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD, a cytoplasmic marker), when compared to a control strain
(Table 1). Preliminary characterization experiments with
the recombinant chitosanase produced in E. coli

BMS172 gave results similar to those obtained with the
native 33 kDa enzyme (data not shown). Therefore,
since purification of periplasmic chitosanase was easier,
detailed characterization of enzyme performance was
carried out on chitosanase from E. coli pBMS172.
Characterization of chitosanase from Janthinobacterium

Purified chitosanase produced by E. coli pBMS172 was
analyzed with respect to substrate specificity. The
recombinant chitosanase displayed high relative activity
on chitosan with 80% deacetylation and a peak molecular weight of 1000 kDa (Table 2). The specific activity
on this substrate was found to be 1500 U/mg (45°C).
Slightly lower activity was observed on chitosan with
lower peak molecular weight (500 kDa and 700 kDa)
and on 55% deacetylated chitosan. No activity was

observed on chitin, cellulose, glucan, xylan or arabinoxylan substrates (Table 2). TLC analysis of the products
from hydrolysis of chitosan hexamer showed that digestion with recombinant chitosanase resulted in only
dimers and trimers of glucosamine. In contrast, concentrated medium from Janthinobacterium sp. 4239 culture
was able to hydrolyze the hexameric substrate into
monomers and dimers (Fig. 3).
Determination of temperature optimum was conducted with 80% deacetylated chitosan substrate (Fig.4).
Purified chitosanase from E. coli pBMS172 displayed
maximal activity at 45°C and 30-70% of the maximal
activity was observed at 10-30°C. The recombinant chitosanase was stable at temperatures up to 50°C above
which the enzyme activity decreased rapidly and hardly
remained after treatment at 70°C for 30 min. Determination of the pH optimum was conducted with 80%
deacetylated chitosan. The chitosanase displayed a broad
pH optimum between pH 5 and 7 (Fig. 5). Hardly any
activity was left at pH 8 and above.

Discussion
Previously, Janthinobacterium strains degrading chitin
have been reported [27,28] but this report is the first to
describe a chitosanase from the genus Janthinobacterium. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and zymographic staining revealed that two polypeptides with the
apparent molecular weights of 27.5 and 33 kDa were

harbours two different chitosanase genes, and that in
the subsequent screening of the genomic library in E.
coli only one of the genes were isolated in this study.
However, another explanation for the two bands in
extracellular extracts from native Janthinobacterium sp.
4239 cells may be that the strain produces two enzyme
variants from the isolated cho4239-1 gene by using two
different translation initiation positions and/or by cleavage at two different positions in the polypeptide chain.

recombinant chitosanase product. The 27.5 kDa chitosan hydrolytic product from the native Janthinobacterium sp. 4239 may also not be size estimated entirely
correctly in the zymogram. If this second chitosan
hydrolyzing protein is a result of translational initiation
at the second putative start position the expected molecular size is expected to be 28.1 kDa. However, we can
not from our data conclude if Janthinobacterium sp.
4239 harbours one or two chitosanase gene(s).
Expression of the Janthinobacterium chitosanase in E.
coli resulted in large amounts of recombinant chitosanase in the periplasm (BMS172). Also, a large amount
of recombinant protein accumulated in the cytoplasm,
suggesting that the efficiency of the expression system
could be further improved by introducing elements that
promote secretion. SDS-PAGE showed that the monomeric molecular weight of the chitosanase secreted by
the BMS172 construct was 33 kDa, which is similarly to
the larger of the two products secreted by the native
Janthinobacterium sp. strain 4239 (Fig. 2, lane 2).
In agreement with the affiliation to glycosyl hydrolase
family 46, based on protein homology, the ability of the
chitosanase to convert chitosan hexamers into dimers
and trimers further emphasizes the relation with endochitosanases. However, hexamer substrate conversion by
crude extracellular protein from Janthinobacterium sp.
4239 resulted in monomeric glucosamine accumulation,
suggesting that the native bacterium also produces exobeta-D-glucosaminidase activity in addition to endohydrolytic chitosanase activity.
The chitosanase displayed 64% amino acid sequence
identity with the well-characterized chitosanase from
Streptomyces sp. N174. Alignment of the Janthinobacterium sp. 4239 chitosanase with that of Streptomyces
sp. N174 revealed the presence of a putative catalytic

Johnsen et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2010, 9:5

residue at Glu22 (Streptomyces numbering). However,
an equivalent of Asp 40 , which is also believed to be
involved in catalysis in most - if not all - chitosanases
from family GH-46, was not found. However, it has
been shown [29] that an Asp to Gly mutation in position 40 in Streptomyces sp. N174 chitosanase did not
affect the stereochemical mechanism of catalysis or the
mode of interaction with the substrate. In stead, other
accessory active site residues, Glu 36 and Thr 45 , were
shown to be involved in catalysis. Examination of the
Janthinobacterium sp. 4239 chitosanase sequence (Fig.
1) shows the presence of a glutamine residue similar
to the Glu 36 and a threonine one residue from the
Thr 45 residue in the Streptomyces sp. N174 chitosanase. Thus, it may be possible that the Janthinobacterium sp. 4239 chitosanase uses the Glu 36 residue as a
catalytic residue.

Conclusions
This study provides a chitosanase affiliated to glycosyl
hydrolase family 46 with specificity towards chitosan
substrate and with activity at conditions favourable for
transformation and transfection experiments. The ease,
at which the chitosanase can be produced in E. coli and
accumulated in the periplasm, provides a product with
few impurities suitable for many experimental procedures. The application value of this enzyme can now be
tested in protocols relying on efficient hydrolysis at low
to moderate temperatures.
Methods
Materials

Chitosan samples with peak molecular weights of
500,000, 700,000 and 1,000,000 g/mol, respectively, and
all with a degree of deacetylation of more than 80%
were obtained from Cognis Deutschland GmbH&Co.,
KG (Düsseldorf, Germany). The chitosan (more than
80% deacetylated) used for preparing screening plates
was obtained from Carbomer (Westborough, MA, USA).
A specified preparation of water-soluble chitosan (WSC)
with peak molecular weight of 2,500,000 g/mol and a
degree of deacetylation of 55% was obtained from Primex ehf. (Reykjavik, Iceland). Carboxymethylcellulose
and Avicel were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Crab
flakes for colloidal chitin preparation were obtained
from Carbomer (Westborough, MA, USA). The chitosan-oligosaccharides were obtained from Seikagaku Corporation (Japan). Restriction enzymes were from New
England Biolabs and Fermentas.
Isolation and characterization of chitosanase-producing
strain

Samples of microorganisms were collected at various
locations along the West-coast of Greenland in 2000.

Page 6 of 9

Soil, sediment and water samples were plated on M9
medium supplemented with different carbohydrates.
Strain 4239 was isolated from a fresh water lake close to
Kangerlussuaq. The screening medium was prepared
from stocks. A chitosan stock for one liter of medium
was obtained by autoclaving 1.8 g of insoluble chitosan
in 200 ml of demineralized water. Once room temperature was reached, the chitosan was brought in solution
by adding 18 ml of sterile 1 M HCl. The chitosan was
dissolved during stirring for two hours and then the
entire stock was poured into 700 ml of autoclaved
warm, sterile medium at a slow rate during vigorous
stirring in order to maintain small colloidal particles. To
prepare 700 ml of medium, 9 g of KH 2 PO 4 , 6 g of
K 2 HPO 4 , 8 g of tryptone (Difco), 4 g of yeast extract
(Difco) and 15 g of agar was mixed. The medium was
further supplemented with 2 ml of Vogels Trace Elements (5 g of citric acid·H2O, 5 g of ZnSO4·7H2O, 1 g
of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O, 0.25 g of CuSO4·5H2O, 0.05 g
of MnSO 4 ·H 2 O, 0.05 g of H 3 BO 4 and 0.05 g of
Na 2 MoO 4 ·2H 2 O per 100 ml, sterilized by filtration).
Finally, 2 ml of a sterile solution of MgSO4·6H2O (203
g/l) was added. Before use, the final volume was
adjusted to 1 liter with sterile water. The isolated Janthinobacterium sp. strain 4239 was propagated for four
days at 20°C in baffled, conical culture flasks containing
the complete chitosan growth medium without agar and
aerated by shaking. Supernatants were concentrated on
spin filters (Amicon, 10 kDa cut-off) and analyzed for
protein content and activity. Material for DNA isolation
was obtained by incubation of cells for two days in a
medium, in which the chitosan was substituted by 2.5
ml of 20% glucose per liter. Screening of E. coli transformants expressing chitosanase was carried out on LB
agar plates supplemented with 1.8 g/l of chitosan prepared as described above.
Phylogenetic analysis

The 16S PCR product was generated with the primers
presented in Table 3. The product was sequenced by
primer walking and the information was deposited in
GenBank [GenBank:GQ487532].
Molecular cloning of chitosanase gene

Isolation of chromosomal DNA from Janthinobacterium
sp. 4239 was carried out from a 100 ml cell culture
which was harvested at OD600 = 3. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 ml of TE
buffer (10 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA) and frozen at -20°C. The cells were thawed and incubated with
1% (w/v) SDS, 2 mg of proteinase K (Roche) and 0.1 mg
of RNaseA. After incubation at room temperature for 30
min, 1.8 ml of 5 M NaCl was added. Phase separation
was enhanced by the addition of 1.5 ml of 10% (w/v)

culture was estimated to 200 μg. The DNA was dissolved in TE-buffer and stored at 5°C.
A DNA library was constructed by partial digestion of
24 μg of chromosomal DNA using 0.8 units of the restriction enzyme Bsp1431 (an isoscizomer of Sau3A). After 15
min the partially digested DNA was heat treated at 65°C
for 10 min. DNA fragments above 3 kb in size were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The fragments were
ligated into plasmid pUC18 digested with the restriction
enzyme BamHI, and the ligation mixture was transformed
into electrocompetent E. coli strain DH10B cells (Gibco
BRL). A total of 40,000 transformants were plated onto LB
plates supplemented with 1.8 g of chitosan per liter. E. coli
colonies expressing chitosanase were identified by the
appearance of clearing zones around the colonies.
Nucleotide sequence analysis

One of the E. coli isolates contained a pUC18 plasmid
with a 4 kb insert, plasmid pMGJ1061. DNA sequencing
of the insert in pMGJ1061 was carried out using custom

ordered primers from DNA Technology (Aarhus, Denmark). Reactions were analyzed with an ALF Express
sequencer (Pharmacia). Inserts were sequenced on both
strands using plasmid specific primers and primer walking. Basic DNA analysis was carried out in DNA Star
(Lasergene) and database searches for homologous
sequences were carried out using the BLAST program
[31]. Multiple alignment of amino acid sequences was
performed with the ClustalX program [32]. A putative Nterminal signal peptide was identified by SignalP version
3.0 and LipoP server facilities [33]. The DNA sequence of
Janthinobacterium sp. 4239 chitosanase, Cho4239-1, was
deposited in GenBank [GenBank:GQ487533].
Subcloning and expression in E. coli

Heterologous expression of Janthinobacterium sp. 4239
chitosanase in E. coli was carried out using vector
pMGJ1042, a derivative of plasmid pMF1 [34,35]. Secretion from this plasmid has been improved by introduction of the native OmpA signal peptide cleavage site as
described previously [36]. The chitosanase gene from
Janthinobacterium sp. 4239 was isolated by PCR with
primers specific for the cho4239-1 gene (Table 3). The
DNA fragment was restricted with SphI and BamHI
and inserted into pMGJ1042 also digested with these
enzymes. In this plasmid, pBMS172, the putative catalytic part of the chitosanase gene was fused to the
OmpA. The insert of plasmid pBMS172 was sequenced,
and growth experiments on chitosan-containing agar
plates with chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) and tetracycline

Johnsen et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2010, 9:5
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/9/1/5

(10 ng/ml) confirmed the identity of the plasmid
(Table 3).
Recombinant chitosanase was produced from 50 ml
cultures of E. coli cells harbouring plasmid pBMS172.
The cells were grown in enforced medium (16 g bactotryptone (Difco), 16 g yeast extract (Difco), 5 g NaCl,
2.5 g K2HPO4 per liter) and when the OD600 reached 2,
the cultures were induced with 250 μg/ml of anhydrotetracycline for 5-5.5 h.
Assay procedures

Chitosanase activity was determined as the rate at which
reducing molecules were generated. Reducing ends were
quantitated by reaction with potassium ferricyanide stain
[37] and converted to molecules by reference to a standard
curve of reduced stain intensity versus different amounts
of GlcN. The buffer systems outlined by Keith and Morrison [38] were used for testing activity at different pH
values. The highly deacetylated chitosan substrates were
dissolved in 25 mM HCl before adjusting the assay pH. In
standard assay conditions substrate chitosan with a peak
molecular weight of 1,000 kDa and 80% deacetylation was
dissolved in HCl and equilibrated to pH 5.5 with 150 mM
NH4Ac-buffer. One unit of chitosanase was defined as the
amount of enzyme that liberates 1 μmol of d-glucosamine
per min under the conditions described above. The glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity was
assayed in extracts from an equal number of cells. In this
assay the formation of NADH during glucose-6-phophate
conversion was determined at 340 nm.
Extraction and purification of Janthinobacterium
chitosanase

Bacterial cell pellets were obtained by centrifugation and
then mixed with an equal volume of extraction buffer
(2.5 mM EDTA and 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 6.5). Three
successive cycles of freezing and thawing were conducted for the specific extraction of periplasmatic proteins [39]. After precipitation of the remaining cell
content, the cytoplasm was extracted in the same buffer
by FastPrep (Bio101) treatment including a 1:1 volume
ratio of 102 nm glass beads (Sigma) at speed 5.5 for
three times 20 sec. For long-term storage, the extracts
were preserved with 50% (v/v) glycerol and kept at -20°
C. For storage less than a week, the extract were preserved by addition of 1.5 mM NaN 3 and kept in the
refrigerator. Chitosanase was purified from periplasmic
extract by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated and
eluted with 50 mM potassium phosphate, 150 mM
NaCl, pH 6.5. Chitosanase containing fractions were
pooled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen). The
quantity of the purified chitosanase protein was

estimated relative to the intensity of molecular weight
markers (Mark12, Invitrogen).
Characterization of chitosanase

Zymographic polyacrylamide gels were cast with 30%
ProtoGel 37.5:1 and ProtoGel buffers from National
Diagnostics. In the separation gel 0.025% (w/v) WSC
chitosan was included. Prior to loading the gels, the
enzyme samples were denatured by heat treatment for 3
min at 100°C. The sample buffer was prepared as a twofold stock solution by mixing 15 ml of 50% (w/v)
sucrose, 10 ml of 10% (w/v) SDS and 5 ml of 1 M
Tris·HCl, pH 6.8. After electrophoresis, gels were renatured by overnight incubation in phosphate buffer, pH
6.5, stained with 0.1% Fluorescent Brightner 28 (Sigma)
in 0.5 M Tris·HCl, pH 9 for 5 min, and destained in several changes of demineralized water for a period of 3-4
h. Zymographic gel section with marker proteins and
acrylamide gels without chitosan substrate were stained
with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Results were documented
by UV (312 nm) exposure and photography. TLC
experiments were conducted on Silica Gel 60 plates
(Merck) with oligosaccharides and glucosamine as references. The mobile phase was prepared by mixing 100
ml of 1-propanol and 50 ml of 25% (v/v) ammonia
(Merck). The separation was conducted over two runs
each taking about 6 h. After drying, the plates were
sprayed with 5% (v/v) HCl in ethanol and heated for 10
min in an oven at 170°C.
