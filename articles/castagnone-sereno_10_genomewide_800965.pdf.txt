Abstract
Background: Microsatellites are the most popular source of molecular markers for studying population genetic
variation in eukaryotes. However, few data are currently available about their genomic distribution and abundance
across the phylum Nematoda. The recent completion of the genomes of several nematode species, including
Meloidogyne incognita, a major agricultural pest worldwide, now opens the way for a comparative survey and
analysis of microsatellites in these organisms.
Results: Using MsatFinder, the total numbers of 1-6 bp perfect microsatellites detected in the complete genomes
of five nematode species (Brugia malayi, Caenorhabditis elegans, M. hapla, M. incognita, Pristionchus pacificus) ranged
from 2,842 to 61,547, and covered from 0.09 to 1.20% of the nematode genomes. Under our search criteria, the
most common repeat motifs for each length class varied according to the different nematode species considered,
with no obvious relation to the AT-richness of their genomes. Overall, (AT)n, (AG)n and (CT)n were the three most
frequent dinucleotide microsatellite motifs found in the five genomes considered. Except for two motifs in
P. pacificus, all the most frequent trinucleotide motifs were AT-rich, with (AAT)n and (ATT)n being the only common
to the five nematode species. A particular attention was paid to the microsatellite content of the plant-parasitic
species M. incognita. In this species, a repertoire of 4,880 microsatellite loci was identified, from which 2,183
appeared suitable to design markers for population genetic studies. Interestingly, 1,094 microsatellites were
identified in 801 predicted protein-coding regions, 99% of them being trinucleotides. When compared against the
InterPro domain database, 497 of these CDS were successfully annotated, and further assigned to Gene Ontology
terms.
Conclusions: Contrasted patterns of microsatellite abundance and diversity were characterized in five nematode
genomes, even in the case of two closely related Meloidogyne species. 2,245 di- to hexanucleotide loci were
identified in the genome of M. incognita, providing adequate material for the future development of a wide range
of microsatellite markers in this major plant parasite.

Background
Microsatellites, also known as simple sequence repeats,
are 1-6 base pair (bp) nucleotide motifs tandemly
repeated in the genome of every eukaryotic organism
analyzed so far. In contrast to non-repetitive DNA,
microsatellite polymorphism is primarily due to variation
in the number of repeated motifs rather than to

substitutions. A very high mutation rate - from 10-4 to
10-3 mutation per microsatellite and per generation [1]is usually associated with microsatellite loci, resulting in
high heterozygosity and the presence of multiple alleles
at a given locus [2]. These markers are co-dominant,
abundant in non coding regions of the genome, are relatively easy to isolate, can be specifically amplified by
PCR, and evolve according to mutation models that are
well described [1,2]. Therefore, microsatellites have
emerged as the most popular and versatile neutral markers for geneticists working on a wide range of topics

including, among others, forensics, genome mapping,
population structure, phylogeny, linkage and kinship relationships [3]. The most conventional procedure for the
isolation of microsatellite markers, i.e., enrichment of
genomic DNA for microsatellite motifs cloning, screening of the resulting library and sequencing of the positive
clones [4], is challenging, time-consuming and costly.
Such enrichment methods also generally use one or a few
specific repeated motifs that are most often selected
without prior knowledge of their abundance in the genome and may not produce suboptimal results. The recent
availability of huge amount of sequence data for a wide
range of organisms, together with new methodological
developments of in silico mining of microsatellites, have
tremendously increased the characterization of these
markers [5], and will certainly catalyze the study of genomic distribution of microsatellites in eukaryotes.
The isolation of microsatellites as useable markers
appears to be more difficult in some taxa than in others,
and has proved to be difficult in many invertebrates,
including nematodes [6,7]. Except for the model species
Caenorhabditis elegans, whose genome has been
sequenced in the past decade [8], no genome-wide survey
of microsatellites is available for nematodes. In addition,
there have been relatively few studies of microsatellites
isolated by conventional molecular biology approaches in
this phylum compared to other eukaryotes, e.g. insects or
vertebrates. Such unpopularity of microsatellites as
genetic markers in nematodes was attributed in part to
the unusually high proportion of loci that fail to produce
interpretable PCR patterns, possibly as the result of interlocus flanking sequence similarity [9]. The root-knot
nematode (RKN) Meloidogyne incognita is a serious plant
parasite characterized by both its world-wide distribution
and its very large host range [10], which raise questions
about the origin, the processes of dispersal and the
resulting genetic structure of the populations. In recent
years, studies of genetic diversity have been carried out in
this mitotic parthenogenetic organism using neutral
molecular markers such as RAPD or AFLP, and revealed
rather unexpected levels of clonal diversity among populations [11]. But surprisingly, like in other nematodes,
microsatellites, which are usually regarded as among the
most appropriate tools to study variation at the individual
level, have been very poorly investigated in this taxon.
The recent completion of genome sequencing projects
has provided new opportunities to evaluate and compare
the distribution of microsatellites in nematodes. Besides
the genome of C. elegans, additional whole-genome data
are now available for nematodes with very different life
styles, i.e. the necromenic species Pristionchus pacificus
[12], the plant-parasitic species M. incognita and
M. hapla [13,14], and the animal-parasitic species Brugia
malayi [15]. Based on these genomic resources, we report

here the first survey and comparative analysis of microsatellites in nematodes, which reveal variable patterns of
microsatellite abundance and diversity in the genomes of
these organisms. A more detailed focus on the genome
of the RKN M. incognita allowed the characterization
of 2,245 di- to hexanucleotide loci, providing the material
basis for the future development of a wide range of
microsatellite markers in this plant parasite of major
agronomic importance.

Results
Relative abundance and diversity of microsatellites in
nematode genomes

We examined the distribution of perfect 1-6 bp microsatellites using an optimized detection threshold of 12, 8,
5, 5, 5 and 5 repeats for mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, pentaand hexa-nucleotide motifs, respectively. For each motif
type, these are the minimum number of repeats required
for a microsatellite to be reported, that have been optimized as default parameters of the software to eliminate
repeats which might be observed by chance [16]. So the
results described here apply to microsatellites meeting
this criterion. Accordingly, the total numbers of microsatellites found in the five nematode genomes appeared
highly variable, ranging from 2,842 to 61,547, and covered from 0.09 to 1.20% of the nematode genomes
(Table 1). When considering density and coverage of
the microsatellites (i.e., number and length per Mbp of
analysed sequence, respectively) in the five genomes,
three homogenous groups could be defined (Table 1).
The first one comprised the two RKN species, M. incognita and M. hapla, which shared the lowest abundance
of microsatellite loci. The second group combined C.
elegans and P. pacificus, with microsatellite density and
coverage values about two times higher than those of
RKN. The largest values were exhibited by B. malayi
(about five times those of C. elegans). The variability of
microsatellite number found in nematode genomes was
well explained by genome size for M. incognita, M.
hapla, C. elegans and P. pacificus (r2 = 0.95, F1,2 = 37.5,
p = 0.03), but not when B. malayi was included (r2 =
0.10, F1,3 = 0.34, p = 0.6) (Table 1).
Table 2 shows the relative abundance of the different
microsatellite length classes (i.e., mono-, di-, tri- up to
hexanucleotides). Overall, distributions significantly varied among species (Fisher exact test, p < 10 -4 ). The
B. malayi genome exhibited the highest density and coverage of microsatellites, except for 6-bp motifs that
proved to be more frequent in C. elegans. Mononucleotide repeat motifs notably outnumbered all other length
classes in the five nematode genomes, ranging from
48.7% of microsatellites in M. hapla, to 75.5% in
B. malayi. Between species, there was a large variation
in the number of mononucleotide repeats per Mb of

After mononucleotides, trinucleotides were the next
most abundant length class in nematode genomes,
except for B. malayi. In this particular species, di- and
trinucleotide motifs each represented about 10% of the
total number of microsatellites. Quite surprisingly, dinucleotide motifs appeared underrepresented in the two

RKN species, at 3.5 and 4% of the total number of
microsatellites in M. hapla and M. incognita, respectively. Further, there was a drop in the frequency of
longer motifs in the five nematode genomes. Exceptions
were tetranucleotide motifs in M. hapla, and hexanucleotide motifs in C. elegans, which comprised 9.3 and
2.6% of the total number of microsatellites, respectively.

microsatellites with a motif of the same length).
b
Global density of microsatellites for each nucleotide class, including unlisted motifs (if any).

The most common repeat motifs for each length class
varied with the different nematode species considered
(Table 3). A n and T n repeats were the most frequent
motifs in three genomes (M. hapla, C. elegans and
B. malayi), while Cn and Gn repeats dominated in the
two others (M. incognita and P. pacificus), with no
obvious relation to the AT-richness of the genomes
(r 2 = 0.32, F = 1.39, p = 0.37). Overall, (AT)n , (AG) n
and (CT) n were the three most frequent dinucleotide
microsatellite motifs found in any of the five genomes
considered, but with a variable relative rank in each species. The (AT) n motif was particularly dominant in
M. hapla and in B. malayi. All together, these three
motifs comprised from 69.4% (in C. elegans) to 94.7%
(in P. pacificus) of the whole set of dinucleotide microsatellites in each genome. The frequency of tri- to hexanucleotide motifs was more variable, with the list of
most frequent motifs becoming quite specific for each
nematode species. Except for two motifs in P. pacificus
(i.e., (CCT)n and (AGG)n), all the most frequent trinucleotide motifs were AT-rich, with (AAT)n and (ATT)n

being the only common to the five nematode species.
Tetra- to hexanucleotide repeats were much less common in all five genomes, except tetranucleotide motifs
in B. malayi, and to a lesser extent hexanucleotide
motifs in C. elegans, and none of these single motifs
appeared to be shared by the five nematode species.
Among these three length classes, only three of the
most common motifs exhibited a GC content >50%, i.e.
(AAGGG) n and (ACGGGG) n in M. incognita, and
(ACCGGT)n in C. elegans. It is to be noted that no such
GC-rich motifs occurred among the most frequent in
P. pacificus, although this genome has the highest GC
content. The (AACCCT)n telomeric-like hexanucleotide
repeat [17] was found abundant only in the B. malayi
genome.
Diversity of microsatellites in the genome of Meloidogyne
incognita

We further focused our study specifically on the RKN
M. incognita, because it is a plant-parasitic species of
major economic importance for which molecular

markers suitable for population genetics are not available.
Using our search criteria, we could identify a repertoire
of 4,880 microsatellite loci in the genome of this nematode, represented by 58 different motifs that covered
0.09% of the total genomic DNA analysed. Genomic location of microsatellites (i.e., their position on the genome
contigs), motif types and motif iterations are given in
the Additional file 1. The twenty most abundant microsatellite classes were C n , G n , (GTT) n , (AAC) n , T n , A n ,
(AAT)n, (ATT)n, (AAG)n, (CTT)n, (AGG)n, (CCT)n, (CT)
n, (AAAT)n, (ATTT)n, (AT)n, (AATT)n, (ACC)n, (GGT)n
and (ACT)n (Figure 1). Together, they comprised 95.6%
of all microsatellites identified. Although they were the
most frequent (Figure 1; Table 2), mononucleotide motifs
were no longer considered in the following analyses,
because they are not of interest as putative microsatellite

markers. For the same reason, dinucleotide microsatellites were taken into account only when they had more
than eight repeated units (and more than five units for
the tri- to hexanucleotides).
Overall, 54 di- to hexanucleotide motifs were identified
and contributed to the diversity of the microsatellite repertoire in the M. incognita genome (Table 4). Small number
(â¤10) of tandem repeats of the microsatellite motifs predominated with more than 97% of all motifs belonging to
this length group. A declining trend in abundance according to the number of repetitions occurred for all motifs,
except for the tetranucleotide (AGGT)n. Interestingly, this
motif also comprised the most iterated microsatellite
locus, spanning 124 repetitions. Microsatellites consisting
of trinucleotide repeats were by far the most abundant,
representing 80% of the di- to hexanucleotides found in

Figure 1 Frequency of microsatellite classes in the genome of Meloidogyne incognita. Among the 58 classes identified, the 20 most
frequent are shown in individual divisions. The remaining 38 microsatellites are considered in one single division defined as others. For the
partial standardization method used to define microsatellite classes, see Methods.

the nematode genome. They were followed by tetra- and
dinucleotides, at a relative frequency of 9.5 and 8.7%,
respectively, while penta- and hexanucleotides appeared
quite rare (1.7 and 0.3%, respectively). Five different dinucleotide motifs were identified, that were comparable in
terms of frequency (from 1 to 2.7%). Conversely, the distribution was extremely variable among the 15 trinucleotide
motifs characterised, with frequencies ranging from 0.3 to
20.5%. The most frequent motifs were the AT-rich (GTT)
n and (AAC)n, which collectively represented more than
41% of the total number of di- to hexanucleotides

identified in the M. incognita genome. In contrast, the
only motif composed solely of C and/or G, (CGG)n, was
very poorly represented (0.09%). Overall, a total of 99
microsatellites (i.e., 66 di-, 13 tri- and 20 tetranucleotides)
exhibited a large number of repeated motifs (â¥10).

in 801 CDS, including 181 CDS containing at least two
microsatellites (Additional file 2). They represent 22.4%
of the total number of microsatellite loci found in the
whole genome of this nematode. Overall, the distribution density of microsatellites is 53.7 per Mb of coding
sequence. The occurrence of the repeat motifs found is
shown in Figure 2A. Only mono-, di- and trinucleotide
motifs were observed, this last category representing
more than 99% of the total set of microsatellites. With
64.2% of repeat motifs, (AAC) n turned out to be the
most frequent microsatellite, followed by (AAG)n (9.9%),
(AAT)n (8.6%) and (AGG)n (6.0%). Among trinucleotide
motifs, GC-rich microsatellites represented 13.6% only
of the total number of loci. We further investigated the
frequency of the amino-acid repeats (AAR) encoded by
the tri-nucleotide repeats in the CDS (Figure 2B). The
ten different amino acids that composed the AAR identified were, from the most to the least frequent, Asparagine (Asn), Lysine (Lys), Threonine (Thr), Arginine
(Arg), Serine (Ser), Isoleucine (Ile), Proline (Pro), Leucine (Leu), Glycine (Gly) and Valine (Val). The longest
AAR encoded by trinucleotide motifs was observed for
Asn with 14 repeats.
When scanned for InterPro domains, 497 out of the 801
CDS (~62%) containing at least one microsatellite motif
were found to harbour at least one known domain (Additional file 3), and were further assigned a corresponding
Gene Ontology (GO) term. Overall, Cellular Component,
Molecular Function and Biological Process GO terms
could be assigned to 218, 349 and 246 CDS, respectively.
For each GO category, the relative distribution of GO
terms is represented in Figure 3. With regard to the cellular component category, 40.8% of the CDS were assigned a
nucleus GO term, followed by the cell (33.5%) and the
membrane (28%) categories. Conversely, the extracellular
(0.5%) and extracellular matrix (1.4%) GO terms were
poorly represented. Macromolecule metabolism (38.2%)

was the most frequent GO term for CDS in the biological
process category, just followed by regulation of biological
process (37.4%) and cellular process (33.3%). Notably, only
0.8% and 1.6% of the annotated CDS were assigned a
secretion and response to stimulus GO term, respectively.
When the molecular function category was considered,
binding GO term was over-represented (89.1%), followed
by transferase (28.1%) and hydrolase (21.8%) activities.

Discussion
Diversity of microsatellite distribution in nematode
genomes

In this study, we used Msatfinder [16] to scan the
recently assembled M. incognita, M. hapla, B. malayi and
P. pacificus genomes for perfect microsatellites of 1-6 bp
long. To validate our results, we performed a similar analysis of the C. elegans genome using the same bioinformatics tool and search parameters. The coverage of
microsatellite loci in C. elegans has previously been estimated at 2139 bp/per Mbp [18], and we were encouraged
in that our results are consistent with those previously
reported for this nematode (~2059 bp/Mbp; Table 1).
Indeed, such a consistency between two independent studies may be considered as a strong indication of the
robustness of the global analysis.
It has long been considered that the structure and organization of the C. elegans genome would serve as accurate
model for most nematodes [19]. Previous comparative studies of model eukaryotes have shown that C. elegans has
the lowest frequency and coverage of microsatellites in its
genome, even less than Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
other fungi [18,20,21]. Our own analysis reveals a huge
variation among the five nematode genomes investigated
in terms of both coverage and density of microsatellites,
that is independent from the size of the genomes considered. While P. pacificus has similar microsatellite density
and coverage than C. elegans, the two RKN species,

have more than one GO category assigned to them.

M. hapla and M. incognita, both exhibit a twofold lower
abundance of microsatellite loci. Conversely, the animal
parasite B. malayi contains five times more microsatellites/Mbp than C. elegans. Phylogenetic relationships
within the Nematoda phylum have been considered to
tentatively explain such variability. Based on small subunit
ribosomal DNA sequences, the phylogeny of nematodes
identifies five major clades in the phylum [22]. In this framework, C. elegans and P. pristionchus belong to Clade V,
M. incognita and M. hapla belong to Clade IV, and
B. malayi belong to Clade III, respectively. Although a
loose correlation may be seen here, additional data from
many other nematode species from all five clades are
required before considering any hypothetical relationship
between the clade of origin and the density of microsatellites for a given species. Clearly, these data provide evidence of variable patterns of microsatellite distribution in
nematode genomes, indicating that the particular contribution of these shorts tandem repeats to the genome of
C. elegans may not be the rule for other nematodes.
Without taking into account mononucleotide repeats,
it is generally reported that dinucleotides are the most
common microsatellites in many organisms [23,24].
Here, dinucleotides appeared significantly underrepresented in both RKN species, with as few as 3.5 and 4.0%
of the total number of microsatellites in M. hapla and
M. incognita, respectively. Conversely, trinucleotides
were overrepresented in both the two latter species compared to C. elegans, P. pacificus and above all B. malayi.
Such a distribution bias in favour of trinucleotides has
been reported for some other eukaryotes, e.g., the fungus
Neurospora crassa [25] or the insect Tribolium castaneum [26]. Also, a recent data-mining analysis of ESTs
from phytoparasitic nematodes, including some RKN
species, showed that trinucleotide repeats were the most
abundant microsatellites in coding ESTs [27].
Data-mining of 26 completed genomes showed that
microsatellites with low GC content are predominant in
most eukaryotic genomes [5]. This trend also emerged
from our survey, with the majority of the most frequent
1-6 bp microsatellite motifs from nematodes being ATrich. However, one notable exception was constituted by
polyG/polyC mononucleotide repeats in M. incognita
and P. pacificus. Conversely, none of the most frequent
di- to hexanucleotide repeats contains exclusively Cs or
Gs. Among nematode dinucleotides, (AT)n motifs seem
to be predominant compared with other motifs, while
(CG)n were extremely rare, and even absent in the two
RKN species. (CT)n motifs, which are the most abundant dinucleotides in insects [28] and other invertebrates [20], were also frequently detected in nematode
genomes. In the same way, trinucleotides were dominated by AT-rich motifs, with (ATT) n and (AAT) n
being always present in the four most common motifs

Page 9 of 13

in the five species investigated. The only exceptions
were (CCT) n and (AGG) n , which were frequently
detected in the P. pacificus genome. AT-richness was
further exhibited by tetra- to hexanucleotides, with
some remarkable exceptions, i.e., (AAGGG) n and
(ACGGGG)n in M. incognita, or (ACCGGT) n in C. elegans. Overall, the diversity of microsatellite motifs gave
each of the five nematode species a unique pattern of
repeat distribution, even in the case of the two related
RKN species tested here, suggesting that they can be
efficient at differentiating those species.
Microsatellites in the protein-coding sequences of
Meloidogyne incognita

A total of 1,094 perfect microsatellites have been identified from the whole M. incognita CDS dataset, i.e., 3.9%
of protein-coding sequences possess such repeats. The
vast majority (>99%) of them are trinucleotide repeats.
This result confirms a recent report indicating that trinucleotide repeats were the most abundant microsatellites
in coding ESTs from 16 species of plant-parasitic nematodes belonging to seven genera, including Meloidogyne
[27]. Moreover, in agreement with these authors, we
found that (AAC)n repeats were the most abundant in
M. incognita CDS, while (ATG)n or (TTA)n, that could
act as start or stop codon, respectively, were not detected.
The proportion of trinucleotide repeats in M. incognita
CDS exponentially decreased as the number of repeats
increased, with 14 repeats being a critical threshold. It is
hypothesized that longer repeats are eliminated by selection acting on the nematode genome, since long amino
acid repeats may have detrimental effects on protein
functions [29,30]. In addition, our data showed that the
hydrophilic amino acid Asn, and to a lesser extent Lys
and Arg, are over-represented among the runs of amino
acids in M. incognita proteins, which is consistent with
the observation that stretches of hydrophilic amino acid
are more tolerated in proteins [29,30].
A broad range of functions have been ascribed to
amino acid repeats in proteins, including roles in intracellular protein-protein interactions, binding to host-cell
receptors and polymerisation of their associated, nonrepeated domains [31]. In parasitic eukaryotes such as
Trypanosoma brucei or Plasmodium falciparum, protein
repeats are often implicated in antigenic recognition and
evasion of the host immune response to infection [32].
Mining the M. incognita predicted proteome revealed a
set of 801 proteins containing stretches of amino acid
repeats, of which 497 had at least one InterPro domain
assigned, thus illustrating the importance of these peculiar structures in parasitic nematodes too. In addition,
GO annotation revealed that binding was the molecular
function preferentially assigned to these proteins. Based
on the hypothesis that amino acid repeats can mediate

Castagnone-Sereno et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:598
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/598

interactions between the parasite and its host, and thus
could potentially have a role in pathogenicity [33,34], a
similar role for (some of) these proteins identified in
M. incognita may be proposed. From this point of view,
our analysis generated a large set of candidate proteins
for further functional analysis in relation to pathogenicity in plant nematodes.
Microsatellites as genetic markers in Meloidogyne
incognita

Due to the relatively small size of nematode genomes,
and the high impact of many parasitic species on animal/
human health or agricultural production, one of the
expected outputs of nematode genome projects is the
development of reliable and informative molecular markers usable as genotyping tools in population studies.
Among the nematode species included in this work, and
except for the model organism C. elegans, microsatellite
markers have been very poorly developed, and their practical application has been limited. Thus, a significant output of the present survey has been the identification of a
wealth of microsatellite motifs in each of the nematode
genomes analyzed. In the case of plant-parasitic nematodes, population genetics studies based on the use on
polymorphic microsatellite markers are very scarce. They
mainly concern the cyst nematodes Globodera pallida
[35-37] and Heterodera schachtii [38], as well as the pinewood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus [39], the
reniform nematode Rotylenchulus reniformis [40] and the
dagger nematode Xiphinema index [41]. Conversely,
because of the lack of microsatellite markers available, no
such study has been developed on M. incognita, although
this species has been considered as âthe worldâs most
damaging plant pathogenâ [10]. Indeed, only one microsatellite locus had been characterized so far in RKN, i.e. in
M. artiellia, a species assumed to reproduce both by
amphimixy and facultative meiotic parthenogenesis [42].
The present study, with a total of 2,245 di- to hexanucleotide loci identified in the genome of M. incognita,
now opens new perspectives for the development of a
wide range of microsatellite markers in this nematode.
Moreover, it provides useful information about possible
physical linkage between microsatellite loci and identifies
markers located in coding regions that may not be considered as neutral.
From a more general point of view, the microsatellites
identified in this study may be useful for linkage analysis
in the context of genetic mapping. Although not available
for the parthenogenetic RKN M. incognita, genetic maps
have been extensively developed in many nematode species, including M. hapla [14], C. elegans [43] and P. pacificus [44] and should benefit from the input of large
batches of new markers. Additionaly, in the two latter
species, location of microsatellites on sex chromosomes

Page 10 of 13

may be of further help for kinship analysis. To our
knowledge, only one study reported the genome-wide
chromosomal location of microsatellites in C. elegans,
with no significant distorsion in frequency and distribution on the X chromosome compared to autosomes [20].
Conversely, no such information can be provided for
RKNs, due to the lack of sex chromosomes in these species, where sex determinism is under environmental epigenetic control [45,46]. However, microsatellite loci
could be located on the 2,995 contigs resulting from the
genome assembly of the nematode [13], and this information has been obtained for the 4,880 microsatellite loci
presently identified.
Because of its negligible cost, in silico mining of microsatellites makes this approach more comfortable than
bench screening of genomic libraries. Although further
experimental work is needed to setup PCR protocols and
select the polymorphic loci that will become usable as
genetic markers, recent genetic mapping or DNA fingerprinting studies demonstrated the success of this strategy
[5]. For example, in the insect T. castaneum, 509 new
polymorphic markers were experimentally validated from
12,160 loci identified by a bioinformatics analysis [47]. Of
the 2,245 di- to hexanucleotide microsatellite sequences
discovered in M. incognita, 2,183 had sufficient flanking
sequences to allow the design of primer pairs. These
data, including primer sequences, may become useful for
developing variable markers in M. incognita.

Conclusions
This analysis of microsatellites in completely sequenced
nematode genomes provides a snapshot of the differential
coverage and density of 1-6 bp repeats among the five species investigated. In particular, the two RKN species, M.
hapla and M. incognita, both exhibit a two times lower
abundance of microsatellite loci than C. elegans, which
was previously considered as containing the lowest frequency of microsatellites among (model) eukaryotes.
Quite surprisingly, dinucleotide motifs appeared underepresented in the two RKN species compared to the other
nematode genomes, while trinucleotides were equally
overrepresented in the two latter species compared to
C. elegans, P. pacificus and B. malayi. The focus on
M. incognita led to the identification of 4,880 microsatellites, 2,183 of them being a priori suitable to design markers for population genetics. Interestingly, 22.4% of the
detected microsatellites were located in coding regions,
almost all being short (<14 repetitions) trinucleotide
motifs. This result suggests that microsatellites may affect
evolution of proteins structure and function in this
species.
The nucleotide sequences of the microsatellite loci
obtained in this work, together with their flanking
regions and amplification primers, are available for the

Undoubtedly, this information may become useful for
the development of large sets of markers that should in
turn allow linkage mapping studies and facilitate population genetic research on nematodes.

input into the GOSlim program and the output was
parsed to count the occurrence of each GO category.

Methods

Additional material

Sequence data

The M. incognita and M. hapla genome assemblies
[13,14] were downloaded directly from the sequencing
project websites at http://www.inra.fr/meloidogyne_incognita and http://www.hapla.org. respectively. The genome sequence of C. elegans, B. malayi and P. pacificus
were downloaded from WormBase (release WS210) at
http://www.wormbase.org/. The total number of bp
searched and (G + C) content for each of the three genomes are indicated in Table 1. For M. incognita, the
whole set of 20,365 protein-coding sequences (including
splice variants) predicted from the whole-genome
sequence [13] was included in the analysis.
Sequence analyses

Genomic sequences were scanned for microsatellite content using the program Msatfinder v2.0.9 [16] downloaded at http://www.genomics.ceh.ac.uk/msatfinder/.
Msatfinder is a Perl script designed to allow the identification and characterisation of microsatellites in a comparative genomic context. The Regex search engine,
which implements fast regular expressions to search
once through the sequence, was used in our analyses.
Detection criteria were constrained to perfect repeat
motifs of 1-6 bp and a minimum repeat number of 12,
8, 5, 5, 5 and 5, for mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and
hexa-nucleotide microsatellites, respectively. Primer
pairs for the identified microsatellite loci were designed
using the Primer3 software [48] implemented in Msatfinder using default parameters.
Partial standardization of the microsatellite motifs was
used for categorizing and comparing microsatellites, by
considering overlapping components occurring in one
DNA strand only, i.e. without including the sequence
complement [49]. For example, the AAC class contains
the (AAC)n, (ACA)n and (CAA)n microsatellites. In the
present study, a total of 4, 6, 20, 60, 204 and 670 theoretical classes were considered for mono, di, tri, tetra, penta
and hexanucleotides, respectively. To allow direct comparisons regardless of the size of the genomes analysed,
density (number of loci) and coverage (number of bp) of
the microsatellites were calculated for 1 Mbp of the corresponding genomic sequence.
The complete set of predicted protein-coding
sequences resulting from the M. incognita genome project [13] was scanned for InterPro domain content [50].
