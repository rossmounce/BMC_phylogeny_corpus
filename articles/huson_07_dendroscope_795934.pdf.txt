Abstract
Background: Research in evolution requires software for visualizing and editing phylogenetic
trees, for increasingly very large datasets, such as arise in expression analysis or metagenomics, for
example. It would be desirable to have a program that provides these services in an effcient and
user-friendly way, and that can be easily installed and run on all major operating systems. Although
a large number of tree visualization tools are freely available, some as a part of more comprehensive
analysis packages, all have drawbacks in one or more domains. They either lack some of the
standard tree visualization techniques or basic graphics and editing features, or they are restricted
to small trees containing only tens of thousands of taxa. Moreover, many programs are diffcult to
install or are not available for all common operating systems.
Results: We have developed a new program, Dendroscope, for the interactive visualization and
navigation of phylogenetic trees. The program provides all standard tree visualizations and is
optimized to run interactively on trees containing hundreds of thousands of taxa. The program
provides tree editing and graphics export capabilities. To support the inspection of large trees,
Dendroscope offers a magnification tool. The software is written in Java 1.4 and installers are
provided for Linux/Unix, MacOS X and Windows XP.
Conclusion: Dendroscope is a user-friendly program for visualizing and navigating phylogenetic
trees, for both small and large datasets.

Background
Phylogenetic trees are used to represent evolutionary relationships between biological taxa, while taxonomical
hierarchies such as the NCBI taxonomy are used to structure the wealth of molecular sequence data. The size of
trees under consideration is growing larger and larger.

now considers more than 11,000 species. The Ribosomal
Database Project II provides a hierarchical browser for a
collection of approximately 340,000 ribosomal RNA
sequences. Recent metagenomic analysis software [2]
makes use of the full NCBI taxonomy, which now contains more than 390,000 taxa, to estimate the taxonomical
content of a dataset.

the evolutionary relationship of all living species on earth,

Most currently available tree viewers are designed to handle trees containing up to a few thousand nodes. A notable exception is TreeJuxtaposer [3], which was explicitly
designed to visualize large trees. While TreeJuxtaposer is
the tool of choice for very large datasets (containing hundreds of thousands of taxa), it has limited value as an allround tree visualization tool, as it only implements one
particular tree view (namely the rectangular phylogram,
perhaps because this is the only view that is useful for
large trees), it lacks basic graphics export capabilities and
it does not allow one to save and reopen a modified tree.

Results and Discussion
Dendroscope is designed as an all-round tree visualization tool that can handle trees with hundred thousands of
taxa (see Figure 1). Trees can be read and written in Newick or Nexus format [4], as produced by standard tree
reconstruction programs. Additionally, Dendroscope uses
its own file format to save and reopen (lists of) trees that
have been edited graphically using different colors, line
widths and fonts.
A tree can be displayed in a number of views, namely as a
circular, radial or rectangular phylogram, as (an internal

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/460

or external) circular, rectangular or slanted cladogram, or
as an unrooted diagram (see Figure 2). The nodes, edges
and labels of a tree can be interactively formatted and
edited (see Figure 3). Trees can be rerooted and subtrees
can be rotated, collapsed, extracted and removed. In the
rectangular and slanted views, a horizontal magnifier
band can be used to enlarge a part of the tree. In the circular and radial views, a circular magnifier is available,
which can also be switched to "magnify all mode", if
desired (in which the complete tree is visible under the
magnifier). A search tool can be used to find and locate
taxa in the tree. All views are exportable as EPS, SVG, PNG,
JPEG, GIF and BMP graphic files. Installers are available
for Linux/Unix, MacOS X and Windows XP.
Comparison with other tree viewers
In a survery of existing tree vizualisation and manipulation programs we screened over 40 programs (for extensive lists of such programs, e.g. see [5,6]). In Table 1, we
compare Dendroscope to a selection of tree viewing programs which are either widely used or have exceptional
features: ATV [7], HyperTree [8], MEGA [9], PHYLIP's [10]
drawtree/drawgram, SplitsTree4 [11], TreeView [12],
TreeJuxtaposer [3] and TreeDyn [13]. Of the existing pro-

grams, only TreeJuxtaposer and PHYLIP's drawtree and
drawgram can handle very large trees. PHYLIP's drawtree
and drawgram are non-interactive and so are of limited
use. TreeJuxtaposer is currently the viewer of choice for
large trees. SplitsTree4 and TreeJuxtaposer provide different mechanisms for comparing two or more trees.
TreeDyn provides useful features such as scriptability,
interoperability with tree databases and especially the
possibility to display and manipulate many trees in paral-

lel. Its drawbacks are the limit to trees of only moderate
size and the complex user interface.
The system requirements of existing viewers vary: some
work only with particular versions of Unix/Linux or
MacOS, or they need additional software to be installed.
However, all viewers listed in Table 1 run on Linux/Unix,
MacOS and Windows, except MEGA, which runs only on
Windows.

the example shows a tree drawn as an internal circular cladogram.

Dendroscope at work
Our objective was to build a tree viewer that is able to handle a tree as large as the current version of the NCBI taxonomy. On a standard laptop, Dendroscope performs well
on this tree in all rectangular and slanted views. Circular
and radial view are less suitable for very large data sets.
Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the NCBI taxonomic tree
loaded in Dendroscope showing Homo sapiens and the

Hominidae. Figure 2 demonstrates some of the views provided by the program.

Conclusion
With Dendroscope, we have developed a new all-round
tree viewer that combines all major features found in popular viewers into a single program that can handle large
datasets.

Availability and Requirements
Dendroscope is freely available and can be downloaded
from
http://www-ab.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/soft
ware/dendroscope. The software is written in Java 1.4 and
installers are provided for Linux/Unix, MacOS X and Windows.

Methods
Processing of trees
Since we want to represent very large trees, we need to be
able to focus on the crucial parts of the representation to
speed up calculations. To this end, we use bounding
boxes: to each subtree, we assign a box containing the subtree. The tree is drawn from the root down, and each subtree is drawn only if its bounding box is in the visible
region or at least intersects with it. In addition, we compare the height of the bounding box to the number of
edges it contains; if we find too many edges in a too small
a box, we draw the box as an opaque single element
instead of drawing each edge separately. When we want to
identify the element (edge or node) at a selected position,
we also make use of the bounding boxes: The tree is
searched from the root down, leaving out all subtrees
whose bounding boxes do not contain the selected position. This reduces the search time from  (n) to
 (log(n)).

We supply two different magnifiers to let the user easily
access inner nodes and taxa: a horizontal magnifier band
for rectangular and slanted views, and a circular one for
radial tree views. In both cases, a point with distance d to
the center of the magnifier is mapped to a point with dis-

d
tance f (d) = D / 2 ⋅ d + D / 12 from the center, where D

denotes the diameter or height of the magnifier, as appropriate.
Test data and system
To estimate the number of displayable taxa for each
viewer (see Table 1), we applied the viewer to a list of trees
containing increasingly large numbers of taxa: 1 k, 2 k, 5
k, 10 k, 20 k, 50 k, 100 k, 200 k, 334 k, 668 k, 1002 k,
1336 k and 2004 k. In Table 1, we report the maximal size
of dataset that could be opened by the viewer, and then
loaded and browsed in a reasonable amount of time (less
than 90 seconds to open and an interaction response time
of less than 15 seconds) on a standard workstation.

Authors' contributions
All authors participated in the specification and testing of
the program. The overall software design is credited to
DHH. The program was mainly written by DHH with contributions from TD, MF, CR, DCR and RR. RR worked on
the mathematical aspects of the magnification algorithm
and contributed to the manuscript. CR and DCR evaluated existing tree viewers, generated test datasets and
wrote the main draft of the paper. All authors read and
agreed with the final manuscript.
