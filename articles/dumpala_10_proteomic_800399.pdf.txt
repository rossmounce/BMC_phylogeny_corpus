Abstract
Background: Flavobacterium columnare causes columnaris disease in cultured and wild fish populations worldwide.
Columnaris is the second most prevalent bacterial disease of commercial channel catfish industry in the United States.
Despite its economic importance, little is known about the expressed proteins and virulence mechanisms of F.
columnare. Here, we report the first high throughput proteomic analysis of F. columnare using 2-D LC ESI MS/MS and 2DE MALDI TOF/TOF MS.
Results: Proteins identified in this study and predicted from the draft F. columnare genome were clustered into
functional groups using clusters of orthologous groups (COGs), and their subcellular locations were predicted. Possible
functional relations among the identified proteins were determined using pathway analysis. The total number of
unique F. columnare proteins identified using both 2-D LC and 2-DE approaches was 621, of which 10.95% (68) were
identified by both methods, while 77.29% (480) and 11.76% (73) were unique in 2-D LC and 2-DE, respectively. COG
groupings and subcellular localizations were similar between our data set and proteins predicted from the whole
genome. Twenty eight pathways were significantly represented in our dataset (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Results from this study provide experimental evidence for many proteins that were predicted from the F.
columnare genome annotation, and they should accelerate functional and comparative studies aimed at
understanding virulence mechanisms of this important pathogen.
Background
Flavobacterium columnare is a long Gram-negative rod
in the family Flavobacteriaceae, one of the main phyletic
lines within the Bacteroidetes group from the domain
Bacteria [1]. Several species in Flavobacteriaceae cause
disease in fish. F. columnare is the causative agent of
columnaris disease [2], which exists both in fresh and
brackish water throughout the world [3]. Outbreaks may
result in high mortality, especially during spring and
autumn, and are most likely associated with poor environmental conditions causing stress [4,5]. Stressful conditions are common in commercial aquaculture where
production is kept at maximum levels.
Columnaris disease generally begins as an external
infection on the skin, fins, gills, or oral cavity [6]. On the
skin and fins, lesions are characterized by dull, grayishwhite or yellow erosive lesions that can progress to deep

ulcers in the underlying muscle. External infection often
is concurrent with systemic infection and subacute mortalities [3]. In some cases, systemic infection with little or
no visible external or internal pathological signs may
occur [7]. F. columnare infections can be chronic, but
more often, the disease appears suddenly and causes
mortalities within a few days [6].
A substantial amount of work has been done on F.
columnare phylogeny [1,8], isolation, identification, and
detection of F. columnare [9-18], and characterization of
F. columnare strains [19-25]. In addition, genetic tools for
the manipulation of F. columnare have recently been
reported [26]. Efforts have been made to understand the
mechanisms of virulence employed by the organism [2730], but much remains poorly understood. F. columnare
produces several extracellular proteases that are believed
to be important virulence factors contributing to the
branchial and cutaneous necrosis [28,31-33], but the role
of the proteases has not been definitively elucidated. A
surface capsular material that may be involved in adhesion has been described [34]. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)

may also play an important role in columnaris pathogenesis [35]. Chondroitin lyase activity was found to be significantly related to strain virulence in a temperature
dependent manner [30].
Although, 14 F. columnare outer membrane related
proteins were reported recently [36], little is known about
the expressed F. columnare proteins. In the present study,
we report the first protein expression analysis from F.
columnare using the complementary technologies of 2-D
LC ESI MS/MS and 2-DE MALDI TOF/TOF MS. Results
of this study provide experimental evidence for the predicted F. columnare proteins and should accelerate functional and comparative studies to delineate pathogenic
mechanisms of F. columnare.

egories (C, E, F, G, H, I, P, and Q). Poorly characterized
COG groups (R and S) contained 70 (11.27%) and 318
(11.03%) proteins in our protein dataset and the predicted whole proteome, respectively. "No COGs" (proteins not belong to any of the currently-defined COGs)
was the top represented category in our protein dataset
(23.51%) and in the whole proteome (36.33%). Eight
(1.29%) proteins from our protein dataset and 117
(4.06%) proteins from whole proteome were assigned to
"No hit" (non-significant short or low-complexity
sequences) category. A summary of Pfam domain analysis
on proteins detected by 2-D LC and 2-DE, and predicted
from the F. columnare draft genome are given in Additional Files 3, 4, and 5: Tables S3, S4 and S5, respectively.

Results

Subcellular localization of identified proteins

Protein identification using 2-D LC and 2-DE

2-D LC analysis yielded total 548 F. columnare proteins
(Additional File 1: Table S1) representing 19.01% of the
predicted F. columnare proteome (2,882 ORFs). 2-DE
analysis of four CBB stained gels showed approximately
600 spots. Among the common spots, 192 were excised
and analyzed from one of these gels. We were able to
identify 182 (94.79%) of the excised spots (Additional File
2: Table S2), which represented 141 unique F. columnare
proteins. In 2-DE analysis, 41 (22.53%) proteins were
identified in multiple spots, probably due to post-translational modifications and processing. Together, 2-D LC
and 2-DE analyses resulted in the identification of 621 F.
columnare proteins, 480 (77.29%) of which were identified only by 2-D LC, while 73 (11.76%) were identified
only by 2-DE (Figure 1), and 68 (10.95%) were detected by
both approaches. Analysis of the functional role categories assigned by the J. Craig Venter Institute's Annotation
Engine indicated some important categories under cell
envelope and cellular processes. Sub categories under
these main groups had potential to include proteins that
may be involved in F. columnare pathogenesis (Table 1).
Functional classification of identified proteins

Functional classifications of the 621 identified unique
proteins and the 2,882 predicted F. columnare proteins
are summarized in Figure 2. A total of 88 (14.17%, 88/
621) proteins from our dataset and 372 (12.91%, 372/
2,882) proteins from the predicted whole proteome were
classified as information storage and processing related
categories (J, K, and L). Cellular processes and signaling
related categories (D, M, N, O, and T) included 112
(18.04%) and 370 (12.84%) proteins from our protein
dataset and the whole proteome database, respectively. A
total of 197 (31.72%) and 658 (22.83%) proteins from our
protein dataset and the predicted whole proteome,
respectively, were represented in metabolism related cat-

Subcellular locations of F. columnare proteins identified
in this study and predicted from the draft genome were
determined (Figure 3). 2-DE and 2-D LC generally
resulted in similar coverage of subcellular compartments
compared to the predicted proteome, except 2-DE gave
better coverage of cytoplasmic proteins and poorer coverage of cytoplasmic membrane proteins. 2-D LC had
better representation of proteins from both membrane
compartments and extracellular proteins. Both 2-D LC
and 2-DE had lower representation of the "unknown"
subcellular location proteins than the percentage from
the predicted proteome. In this study, 42 proteins were
predicted to locate in the F. columnare outer membrane
by PSORTb (Table 2).
Pathway analysis

We used Pathway Studio analysis to gain insight into various pathways represented in F. columnare proteins identified by 2-D LC and 2-DE analysis. Twenty seven pathways
belonging to metabolism and one pathway in genetic
information processing were significantly represented (P
< 0.05, Additional File 6: Table S6). Out of 28 pathways,
eight related to amino acid metabolism (Figure 4), five
carbohydrate metabolism, four cofactor and vitamin
metabolism, four xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism, two glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, two
nucleotide metabolism, one energy metabolism, one biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and one related to
translational process. 277 proteins from our dataset were
integral to these pathways. Of the significantly represented pathways, purine metabolism contained the highest number of proteins (24 proteins), while biotin
metabolism pathway had the fewest (4 proteins). Of all
the pathways, folate biosynthesis pathway was the most
significant pathway in our dataset (P = 2.25E-09), which
was followed by purine metabolism pathway (P = 1.44E07).

Discussion
This research analyzed the soluble cell proteome of Flavobacterium columnare using complementary technologies of 2-D LC and 2-DE. Proteomic data from this study
has provided experimental evidence for the expression of
F. columnare proteins that were previously only predicted
from the draft genome sequence. Data from this study
provides a picture of the expressed F. columnare proteome during log-phase growth in FCGM along with a 2D reference map, which will provide an important basis
for comparison under other environmental conditions.
Currently, the most popular methods employed to
explore protein expression utilize protein separation by

2-D LC (gel-free) or 2-DE (gel-based) followed by MS
analysis [37]. Use of more than one methodology in proteomic investigations improves proteome coverage
because each method identifies a set of unique proteins
[38,39]. Therefore, in the present study, we employed the
complementary techniques of 2-DE and 2-D LC to identify 621 unique proteins from F. columnare (480 unique to
2-D LC, 73 unique to 2-DE, and 68 common to both),
which provided experimental evidence for more than one
fifth (21.55%) of the predicted 2,882 F. columnare ORFs.
Ribosomal proteins, one of the most abundantly
expressed protein types in cells, were detected in high
numbers. In the draft F. columnare genome sequence, 60

proteins were predicted as ribosomal proteins. In the
present study, we identified 14 and 3 unique ribosomal
proteins using 2-D LC and 2-DE, respectively. Along with
ribosomal proteins, we also identified several proteins
involved in translational machinery, including several
aminoacyl-tRNA synthases, translation initiation factors
such as translation initiation factor IF-2 (InfB)
(ORF00214), and elongation factors (EF) such as transcription elongation factor GreA (ORF00178), translation
elongation factor Tu (ORF00244), translation elongation
factor Ts (ORF00695), translation elongation factor P
(ORF01368), and translation elongation factor G
(ORF02228).
Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) often act as important virulence factors in Gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, identification of such molecules provides targets for
future studies to increase our understanding of F. columnare pathogenesis. Moreover, OMPs may also play a crucial role in interacting with other molecules. In the
present study, we identified 42 unique OMPs using 2-D
LC and 2-DE analysis, which includes seven of the 14
OMPs previously identified by Liu et al. (p7, p8, p9, p10,
p11, p12, p16) [36]. TonB-dependent outer membrane
receptors function in the import of iron-siderophore
complexes and vitamin B12 across the outer membrane
in Gram-negative bacteria [40,41]. We identified six
OmpA related proteins, which are the most abundant
protein components of outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria [42]. OmpA is predicted to be a nonspecific

diffusion channel, allowing small solutes to cross the
outer membrane [43].
In F. columnare, proteases, adherence factors, and
chondroitin AC lyase have been reported as virulence
factors [28,44]. The F. columnare genome encodes eight
putative secreted metalloproteases/peptidases probably
involved in virulence and/or in the destruction of host
tissues. In this study, we identified only one extracellular
elastinolytic metalloproteinase (ORF00198) using 2-D
LC, which is probably due to the absence of host/host factors during F. columnare growth and/or isolation of the
bacterial cell proteins, but not the secreted proteins.
Chondroitin AC lyase was not detected, but we did detect
fibronectin type III domain protein (ORF01481), a potential adherence factor that may be involved in cell surface
binding of F. columnare. LemA (ORF00319) is also shown
to be a putative virulence factor in several animal and
plant bacteria especially in Pseudomonas [45,46].
F. columnare moves over surfaces by gliding motility.
Thirteen gliding motility related proteins are encoded in
the F. columnare draft genome, out of which we detected
four (GldN, GldM, GldL and gliding motility-related protein). Detection of only four gliding motility proteins may
be due to planktonic growth of F. columnare in broth culture.
Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by macrophages is one of the most effective defense mechanisms
of host against bacterial pathogens [47]. Superoxide dismutases, bifunctional catalase-peroxidases, thiol peroxidases, and proteins of the peroxy-redoxin family are
important bacterial defense mechanisms allowing survival of F. psychrophilum against phagocytes [48-52]. In
the present study, we identified copper/zinc superoxide
dismutase (SodC) (ORF02131), superoxide dismutase
[Mn] (ORF02002), catalase/peroxidase HPI (KatG)
(ORF02145), cytochrome c551 peroxidase (ORF01733),
thiol peroxidase (ORF00815), and glutathione peroxidase
(ORF00555). SodC is a periplasmic enzyme that converts
superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide and water. Sod
[Mn] is expressed only under aerobic conditions [53] and
is believed to be involved in effective prevention of DNA
damage in Escherichia coli [54]. Expression of these proteins in F. columnare suggests its ability to resist ROS.
The predicted F. columnare proteins were classified
into COGs to assign functions. The majority of proteins
identified in the current study (31.72%) were housekeeping proteins in "metabolism" related categories ('metabolism', 'cellular processes and signaling', and 'information
storage and processing'). This was not surprising because
we harvested proteins from bacteria when they were metabolically active at mid log phase. As compared to the
predicted whole proteome, our experimental dataset had
relatively lower coverage of the F. columnare proteins that
were not assigned to COG groups. Proteins with

Figure 2 Comparison of COG categories. Proteins identified in this study (621 proteins in both 2-D LC and 2-DE analysis) and predicted from the
Flavobacterium columnare draft genome (2,882 ORFs) were organized into COG functional groups. Percentages were calculated by dividing the number of proteins in the particular COG category by the number of unique proteins in each analysis. COG categories are as follows: J, translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis; K, transcription; L, replication, recombination, and repair; D, cell cycle control, cell division, chromosome partitioning;
M, cell wall/membrane/envelop biogenesis; N, cell motility; O, post-translational modification and protein turnover, chaperones; T, signal transduction
mechanisms; U, intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport; V, defense mechanisms; C, energy production and conversion; E, amino acid
transport and metabolism; F, nucleotide transport and metabolism; G, carbohydrate transport and metabolism; H, coenzyme transport and metabolism; I, lipid transport and metabolism; P, inorganic ion transport and metabolism; Q, secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism; R,
general function prediction only; S, function unknown. "No hit" group indicates non-significant short or low-complexity sequences. Query proteins

for clarity.

unknown function may be expressed only under specialized conditions like host environment or stressed conditions and may not be expressed under laboratory culture
conditions. Analysis of metabolism-related proteins in
our list implies that amino acids, instead of carbohydrates, could be the major sources of carbon or energy.
The FCGM medium we used for bacterial growth is a
good source of amino acids, nitrogen, and certain salts
like MgSO4 and CaCl2 but it lacks readily available carbohydrate sources. Most of the metabolic proteins indentified in our study were amino acid kinases, including five
histidine kinases and five aminotransferases. Only three
carbohydrate kinases involved in core carbohydrate
metabolisms were identified. We found 18 peptidases,
which may be useful in utilizing available amino acids as a
major source of carbon. Previous studies on F. psychro-

philum also suggest that this bacterium was unable to use
readily available carbohydrates as a major energy source
[55].
We used the PSORTb algorithm to predict the subcellular locations of F. columnare proteins. Many proteins
were mapped to the cytoplasm, which is expected
because these proteins are not hydrophobic, and thus solubility does not hinder protein isolation and separation.
2-DE was particularly effective at detection of cytoplasmic proteins. By contrast, cytoplasmic and outer membrane proteins were identified in higher percentages
using 2-D LC when compared to 2-DE. The same buffer
solution containing 7M urea and 2% CHAPSO was used
to solubilize proteins during isolations for both 2D-LC
and 2-DE, so it appears that the difference is not due to
the isolation procedure, but rather the separation tech-

Figure 3 Subcellular locations of Flavobacterium columnare proteins determined by PSORTb prediction. Percentages were calculated by dividing the number of proteins in the particular subcellular location by the number of unique proteins in each analysis (548 proteins in 2D-LC, 141
proteins in 2-DE, and 2,882 ORFs predicted from the draft genome). 2-D LC and 2-DE indicates proteins identified in this study, while ORFs indicates

niques. Other studies have reported that hydrophobic
membrane proteins are typically difficult to identify using
2-DE. Hydrophobic proteins were found to be under-represented in 2-DE based proteome analyses of membrane
protein fractions from E. coli [56-58] and Bacillus subtilis
[39,59,60]. It is important to keep in mind that we chose
to analyze only 192 common spots (30.81%) out of
approximately 600 spots identified on our gels, so the bias
toward cytoplasmic proteins in our 2-DE results may be
because these proteins were more abundant or consistently present in gels. However, for future functional
studies of membrane proteins, specialized isolation techniques may be needed. The ease and higher sensitivity of
2-D LC for detection of hydrophobic membrane proteins
may make this the preferred method for studying membrane proteins.
From the Pathway Studio analysis, we identified pathways that were significantly represented in our protein
dataset. Folate biosynthesis was the most significantly
represented metabolic pathway, which was followed by
purine metabolism pathway. Higher representation of
metabolic and translational process related pathways is
expected because proteins were isolated from F. columnare during a metabolically active state. Amino acid
metabolism related pathways (glutamate; histidine; selenoamino acid; alanine and aspartate; glycine, serine, and
threonine metabolism; lysine biosynthesis; lysine degradation; and valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation)

are highly represented in our dataset compared to carbohydrate metabolism. Moreover, we have identified 18
peptidases in our protein list suggesting breakdown of
host proteins and usage of resultant amino acids as a
major source of energy, carbon, and nitrogen by F. columnare. Similarly, Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)anchor biosynthesis and LPS biosynthesis pathways were
significantly represented in our dataset, which may play
an important role in cell wall synthesis. Moreover, LPS
biosynthesis may be one of the important virulencerelated systems in F. columnare pathogenesis. LPS is an
important component of the cell envelope in Gram-negative bacteria and is an immunodominant antigen.

Conclusions
Our main objective was to identify the expressed proteins
of F. columnare during normal growth. We showed for
the first time the expression of 621 proteins from F.
columnare, which provides experimental evidence for
many proteins that were predicted from the F. columnare
genome annotation. We expect this information could
accelerate functional and comparative studies aimed at
understanding virulence mechanisms of this important
pathogen. For example, comparative protein expression
analysis between low and high virulence F. columnare
strains could help determine proteins involved in virulence. Furthermore, orthologous protein mapping of
identified F. columnare proteins to well studied bacteria

would reveal protein targets for mutational analysis to
understand gene function as well as to develop live attenuated vaccines.

Methods
Protein extraction

F. columnare growth medium (FCGM) [tryptone (8.00 g),
yeast extract (0.80 g), MgSO4 7 H2O (1.00 g), CaCl2 2 H2O
(0.74 g), NaCl (5.00 g), and sodium citrate (1.50 g) per
liter] was used to grow F. columnare. Isolate ATCC 49512
was streaked on FCGM agar plates (FCGM medium plus
8.00 g agar per liter) and incubated at 30°C for 48 h. Four
colonies were grown in 12 ml FCGM broth separately at

30°C under continuous shaking at 200 rpm. Growth of
bacteria was monitored by measuring optical density at
600 nm (OD600), and bacteria were harvested at midexponential phase (OD600 0.6) by centrifugation at 3,750
rpm for 15 min at 30°C.
The four bacterial pellets were separately resuspended
in cold urea-CHAPS buffer (7 M urea, 50 mM tris-HCl,
2% CHAPS, 8 mM PMSF pH 8.0), and cells were lysed
immediately on ice by applying ten intermittent pulses of
10 s with a sonicator. Bacterial homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C to remove cell debris
and unbroken cells. Proteins from supernatant were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid/Acetone, and the resul-

tant protein pellets were resuspended in rehydration
buffer (7 M urea, 20 mM tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM
MgCl2, 4% CHAPS, and 5 mM PMSF pH 8.0). Protein
concentrations were estimated using a 2-D Quant Kit (GE
Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ).

were mapped to their orthologs in E. coli, F. psychrophilum, and F. johnsoniae by identifying reciprocal-bestBLAST hits. The resulting ortholog map file was used to
predict pathways in F. columnare proteins. We used P ≤
0.05 to select pathways with significant protein coverage.

2-D LC ESI MS/MS analysis

Additional material

100 μg of protein was digested with trypsin (1:50 w/w) at
37°C for 16 h. The resultant peptides were desalted, dried
in a vacuum centrifuge, and resuspended in 20 μL of 5%
acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Mass spectrometric
analysis was accomplished using a ProteomeX Workstation (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) as described previously [61]. The F. columnare draft genome was
annotated using Annotation Engine at the J. Craig Venter
Institute, which uses the Glimmer algorithm for gene prediction [62,63]. The F. columnare protein database with
2,882 open reading frames (ORFs) is available on our
website http://www.miangel.msstate.edu, while the F.
columnare genome project is hosted at The Oklahoma
University Health Sciences Center http://microgen.ouhsc.edu. To identify proteins, mass spectra and
tandem mass spectra were searched against the in silico
trypsin digested F. columnare protein database as previously reported [64]. Protein identifications and associated
MS data were submitted to the PRIDE database [Accession number: 9749].
2-DE and MALDI MS analysis

Proteins were extracted from four mid-exponential phase
bacterial cultures as described in section 2.1. Protein pellets were resuspended in 350 μL of freshly prepared rehydration buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thio urea, 2% CHAPS, 1:50
carrier ampholytes, 0.3% DTT) and quantified using 2-D
Quant Kit (GE Healthcare). For in-gel rehydration, 8001000 μg of solubilized proteins were loaded onto each
IPG strip (17 cm pH 3-10 NL). IEF, in-gel trypsin digestion, and MALDI MS analysis were performed as previously described [64,65].
Identification of COGs, domains, protein locations, and
pathways

All identified proteins from our dataset and the predicted
whole F. columnare proteome were organized into COG
functional groups using COGnitor tool [66-68]. Similarly,
protein domain analysis was conducted by using batch
Pfam analysis [69]. The subcellular location of proteins
from our dataset as well as from the whole F. columnare
proteome were predicted using PSORTb v2.0.4 [70,71].
Pathways with significant protein representation in our
experimentally derived protein dataset were identified
using Pathway Studio (Ariadne Genomics, Rockville,
MD). Due to lack of a molecular interaction database for
F. columnare in Pathway Studio, all F. columnare proteins
