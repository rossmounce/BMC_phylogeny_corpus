Abstract

The archaeon Halobacterium NRC-1 is an extreme halophile
that thrives in saturated brine environments such as the Dead
Sea and solar salterns. It offers a versatile and easily assayed
system for an array of well-coordinated physiologies that are
necessary for survival in its harsh environment [1]. It has

robust DNA repair systems that can efficiently reverse the
damages caused by a variety of mutagens including UV radiation and desiccation/re-hydration cycles [2,3]. Halobacterium NRC-1 adapts its metabolism to anaerobic conditions
with the synthesis of bacterorhodopsin, which facilitates the
conversion of energy from light into ATP. The completely

Conclusions: Simultaneous analysis of the association network, coordinated mRNA level changes
in microarray experiments and genome-wide structure prediction has allowed us to glean
significant biological insights into the roles of several Halobacterium NRC-1 proteins of previously
unknown function, and significantly reduce the number of proteins encoded in the genome of this
haloarchaeon for which no annotation is available.

Results: We have used Rosetta de novo structure prediction to predict three-dimensional
structures for 1,185 proteins and protein domains (<150 residues in length) found in Halobacterium
NRC-1, a widely studied halophilic archaeon. Predicted structures were searched against the
Protein Data Bank to identify fold similarities and extrapolate putative functions. They were
analyzed in the context of a predicted association network composed of several sources of
functional associations such as: predicted protein interactions, predicted operons, phylogenetic
profile similarity and domain fusion. To illustrate this approach, we highlight three cases where our
combined procedure has provided novel insights into our understanding of chemotaxis, possible
prophage remnants in Halobacterium NRC-1 and archaeal transcriptional regulators.

deposited research

Background: Large fractions of all fully sequenced genomes code for proteins of unknown
function. Annotating these proteins of unknown function remains a critical bottleneck for systems
biology and is crucial to understanding the biological relevance of genome-wide changes in mRNA
and protein expression, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. The work reported here
demonstrates that de novo structure prediction is now a viable option for providing general function
information for many proteins of unknown function.

sequenced genome of Halobacterium NRC-1 (containing
~2,600 genes) has provided insights into many of its physiological capabilities, however nearly half of all genes encoded
in the halobacterial genome have no known function [4-7].
This work is intended to be a prototype for the development
of a biological data integration system with a focus on identifying putative functional predictions for proteins of unknown
function derived from de novo protein structure predictions.
The main result is a reannotation of the Halobacterium NRC1 proteome that includes general functional information
gleaned from protein structure prediction that can be
explored in the context of the predicted association network
for the Halobacterium NRC-1. The information is derived
using Rosetta de novo structure prediction as part of a combined annotation pipeline that also includes several primarysequence similarity based methods. The annotation pipeline
organizes several annotation methods in a hierarchy such
that sequence-based methods (such as PSI-BLAST and Pfam)
are applied first; we rely on structure prediction as a source of
function information only for those proteins not annotated
via primary sequence based methods. We illustrate the merits
of our approach by bringing three examples to the forefront
where integrating Rosetta with one or more independent
methods for predicting functional associations, described
herein, produces functional conclusions not accessible by any
single method.
One paradigm for predicting the function of proteins of
unknown function, the so called 'sequence-to-structure-tostructure-to-function' paradigm, is based on the assumption
that three-dimensional structure patterns are conserved
across a much greater evolutionary distance than recognizable primary sequence patterns [8]. This assumption has been
supported by several structure-function surveys of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) which show that fold similarities in the
absence of sequence similarities imply some shared function
in the majority of cases [9-13]. One protocol for predicting
protein function based on this paradigm is to predict the
structure of a query sequence of interest and then use the predicted structure to search for fold or structural similarities
between the predicted protein structure and experimentally
determined protein structures in the PDB or a non-redundant
subset of the PDB [14-17]. There are, however, several problems associated with deriving functional annotation from fold
similarity - fold similarities can occur through convergent
evolution, and thus have no functional implications. Also,
aspects of function, such as precise ligand specificity, can
change throughout evolution leaving only general function
intact across a given fold superfamily [18-20]. Fold matches
between the predicted structures and the PDB are thus
treated as sources of putative general functional information
and are functionally interpreted primarily in combination
with other methods such as global expression analysis and the
predicted protein association network. In this study we use
Rosetta to generate a confidence ranked list of possible

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/8/R52

structures for proteins and protein domains of unknown
function, search each of the ranked structure predictions
against the PDB, and then calculate confidences for the fold
predictions and evaluate possible functional roles in the context of the Halobacterium association network.
Rosetta is a computer program for de novo protein structure
prediction, where de novo implies modeling in the absence of
detectable sequence similarity to a previously determined
three-dimensional protein structure [21,22]. Rosetta uses
information from the PDB to estimate possible conformations for local sequence segments (three and nine residue segments). It then assembles these pre-computed local structure
fragments by minimizing a global scoring function that favors
hydrophobic burial and packing, strand pairing, compactness
and energetically favorable residue pairings. Results from the
fourth and fifth critical assessment of structure prediction
(CASP4, CASP5) have shown that Rosetta is currently one of
the best methods for de novo protein structure prediction and
distant fold recognition [23-27]. Using Rosetta generated
structure predictions we were previously able to recapitulate
or predict many functional insights not detectable from primary sequence [28,29]. Rosetta was also recently used to generate both fold and function predictions for Pfam [30,31]
protein families that had no link to a known structure, resulting in ~120 high confidence fold predictions. In spite of these
successes, Rosetta has a significant error rate, as do all methods for distant fold recognition and de novo structure prediction. The Rosetta confidence function partially mitigates this
error rate by assessing the accuracy of predicted folds [29].
Another unavoidable source of uncertainty, with respect to
function prediction, is the error associated with distilling
function from fold matches described above. The predictions
generated by de novo structure prediction are thus best used
in combination with other sources of putative or general functional information such as proximity in protein association or
gene regulatory networks.
We separate annotations into two classes. The first type are
annotations referring to individual proteins, such as structure
predictions and function annotations derived from sequence
or structural similarity to a protein of known function. The
second type are annotations referring to the context of a protein relative to other proteins within the proteome, grouping
multiple genes into an operon, two proteins having a similar
phylogenetic profile - implying that they carry out related
functions, correlation of mRNA or protein concentrations
across a variety of genetic or environmental perturbations,
and so on. The major difference between association/contextual information, (information of the second type above) and
individual annotations (first type) is brought sharply into
focus when one considers that there are several highly connected clusters of proteins in the Halobacterium association
network that are composed entirely of genes of unknown
function. Thus, contextual information (often presented in
the form of protein interaction or association networks) must

Of the 2,596 proteins in the Halobacterium genome, 1,077
had significant matches by PSI-BLAST to known structures in
the PDB. An additional 610 domains lacking PSI-BLAST hits
to the PDB had matches to Pfam protein families (detected
using HMMER). Following the application of the above methods, Rosetta was used to predict the three-dimensional structures of all proteins and protein domains (<150 residues in
length) for which we were unable to detect significant
matches to known structures or Pfam domains. The application of the Rosetta method to these domains of unknown
function resulted in 670 high confidence fold predictions that
were then analyzed in the context of the Halobacterium NRC1 association network. A total of 1,234 proteins eluded all
attempts to predict fold and/or function using any of the
methods described above: 239 domains were too large for
Rosetta, and 995 domains produced low confidence Rosetta
results. The results of this annotation hierarchy are publicly
available on the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) Halobacterium Research Resource website [38]. Using this approach
we were able to significantly reduce the number of protein
domains in the Halobacterium NRC-1 genome for which no
hits by any method were found.

deposited research

A multi-institutional effort is currently underway to study the
genome-wide response of Halobacterium NRC-1 to its environment. This systems biology effort elevates the need for
applying improved methods for annotating proteins of
unknown function found in the Halobacterium NRC-1
genome. Genome-wide measurements of mRNA transcripts,
protein concentrations, protein-protein interactions and protein-DNA interactions generate rich sources of data on proteins - those with both known and unknown functions [3,32].
Often these systems-level measurements do not suggest a
unique function for a given protein of interest, but instead
suggest their association with, or perhaps their direct participation in, a previously known cellular function. Thus, investigators using genome-wide experimental techniques are now
routinely generating data for proteins of hitherto unknown
function that appear to play pivotal roles in their studies. Proteins of partially known function can also present challenges
to methods for function assignment, as many of these proteins have large regions of sequence of unknown function that is, many proteins have multiple domains only one (or a
few) of which are homologous to proteins of known function.
These mystery-proteins and mystery-domains require the

reports

Halobacterium NRC-1 uses an increase in the surface negative charge of its proteins as a major adaptation to a high salt
environment. The average protein domain (~150 amino
acids) in Halobacterium has a net charge of -17 in contrast to
-3 for Saccharomyces cerevisiae [34]. A higher overall surface charge (and thus fewer surface hydrophobics) will probably reduce a source of error in Rosetta de novo predicted
conformations - incorrect burial of surface hydrophobics.
Additionally, it has been shown that archaeal proteins have
shorter loops and that, when present, cysteines are found
paired in disulphide bridges more often than in their corresponding eukaryotic homologs [35,36]. These considerations
should result in more accurate Rosetta predictions for these
halophilic archaeal proteins.

We have applied our annotation pipeline to 2,596 predicted
proteins in the Halobacterium NRC-1 genome (Figure 1).
This pipeline represents an annotation hierarchy wherein for
each protein we first attempt function assignment on the
basis of primary sequence similarity to characterized proteins
or protein families; this step includes algorithms such as PSIBLAST and HMMER searches, both of which have low false
positive rates and well characterized error models. In
instances where primary sequence similarity methods fail to
assign putative functions to the proteins, we predict their
three-dimensional structures primarily using two methods:
Rosetta de novo structure prediction and Meta-Server/3Djury fold recognition. Rosetta structure prediction is only
applicable to proteins and protein domains fewer than 150
residues in length and thus separating proteins into domains
prior to analysis is key to the success of our approach. We
have used Ginzu, a program that detects proteins domains
boundaries using Pfam and PSI-BLAST alignments, to separate proteins into domains prior to annotation [37]. This
resulted in 1,926 proteins containing a single domain and 670
proteins that could be divided into 1,665 domains (a total of
3,591 proteins and protein-domains were analyzed by the
annotation pipeline). These 3,591 domains included both
proteins of known function, annotated as part of the initial
annotation [7], and proteins that were unannotated at the
time this study began.

be combined with methods for extending our ability to infer
putative functions for proteins of unknown function if our
goal is to understand biological systems globally. In this work
contextual annotations have been reduced to pairwise relationships between proteins and are represented graphically
as edges of different types in what we will refer to as the Halobacterium association network. Our association network is
composed of operon predictions, conserved chromosomal
proximity relationships, phylogenetic profile similarity, the
occurrence of two Halobacterium proteins fused into a single
protein in other genomes (domain fusion), and predicted protein-protein interactions primarily derived from yeast twohybrid studies and Helicobacter pylori protein-protein interaction studies. The results of previously described genomewide mRNA and protein expression studies are mapped onto
this network [32,33]. The generation and visualization of this
association network is described fully in Materials and
methods.

Sequence based methods are employed first (top), domains that elude
primary sequence based methods are predicted by structure-prediction
methods (bottom). For any given genome, data from all levels in this
method hierarchy are integrated using SBEAMS (Systems Biology
Experiment Analysis and Management System). Implicit in this annotation
hierarchy is the idea that protein annotation should be domain-centric
(that is, multi-domain proteins should be divided into domains as early as
possible in the annotation process). SBEAMS produces a table of
annotations where for a given domain only results from the topmost level
in the method hierarchy (PDB-BLAST → Pfam → Rosetta) producing a
significant hit are displayed.

Association network construction
We have constructed a network of predicted protein associations composed of several different edge types as described
below.
We identified pairs of interacting orthologs using the database of Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COGs) [39] in combination with databases of protein interactions in other
organisms (S. cerevisiae, H. pylori) [40-43]. Putative protein
binding pairs in Halobacterium sp. were inferred in three
stages: COG members of the protein-protein interaction pairs
were determined; all corresponding COG orthologs of yeast
and H. pylori interacting proteins were identified in the
Halobacterium sp. genome; and the interacting pairs were
given a confidence level determined by the strength of the
match to the COG pair and the confidence of the original protein interaction measurements. A total of 1,143 non-redundant predicted interactions were inferred by this method.
We use the method of Marcotte and colleagues [44,45], commonly referred to as the phylogenetic profile method, to

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/8/R52

detect groups of genes with significant co-occurrence across
multiple genomes. This added 525 phylogenetic profile edges
to the Halobacterium NRC-1 association network. Enright et
al. [46] have demonstrated that domain fusions are often correlated with functional interactions among the corresponding
domains. Domains within Halobacterium sp. proteins fused
in other genomes have been used as a metric to predict functional associations between the corresponding proteins. We
identified 2,460 putative associations with this approach.
These putative functional couplings include: proteins that
may participate in the same biochemical pathway, proteins
that may interact with each other, and/or proteins that may
be co-regulated in response to a common environmental
stimulus.
Two methods were used to detect significant co-localization
of genes into operons and evolutionarily conserved chromosomal proximities. These groupings were then represented as
pairwise interactions in the association network. The most
reliable method of the two methods employed requires two
proximal genes to have homologs (via the COG database) in
close proximity in at least one other genome [47] - 327 such
conserved operons pairs were detected and added to the association network. This conserved proximity method requires a
pair of genes to have orthologs in other genomes and is thus
not applicable for genes lacking homologs in other genomes.
Another method for operon prediction [48], which does not
require genes to be found in other systems, relies only on the
proximity and co-directionality of genes, that is, that genes be
on the same strand and close compared to the distribution of
chromosomal proximity for the genome as a whole. A total of
1,335 statistically significant proximities were added to the
network as potential operon edges.
Integration of the different edge types and the experimental
data (primarily microarray expression data) with the annotation table was carried out using Cytoscape [49] and the Systems Biology Experiment Analysis and Management System
(SBEAMS). SBEAMS is a modular framework for collecting,
storing, accessing and integrating data produced by various
experiments using a relational database that is being actively
developed and maintained at the ISB. Cytoscape is a network
visualization tool that allows for the simultaneous viewing of
biological networks with several types of biological data, such
as global mRNA expression data. All microarray data used in
this study are the result of previously described studies
[3,32]. The association network is available as a Java-webstart on the ISB Halobacterium Research Resource website
[38].

Highlights
Although the results of this analysis are publicly available via
our website we will briefly outline three cases where the
Rosetta data, along with the association network, were useful
in annotating proteins of previously unknown function and
thus furthered our understanding of Halobacterium NRC-1

biology, by generating a biologically relevant and testable
hypothesis.

Domains in the Htrs Htr9, Htr14 and Htr16, other than MCP
and HAMP domains, had matches to Pfam families. Htr9 contains a PAS domain suggesting a role in mediating responses
to oxygen or redox-potential (see Table 1). Htr14 had weak
matches to the KE2 domain as well as Prefoldin. The cooccurrence of these two domains seems plausible, as Prefoldin and KE2 domains are known to physically interact,
although the functional implication of the similarity to these
long helical domains is limited. The second domain of Htr16
had a match to apolipoprotein A1 (PF01442), a long domain
involved in the uptake of cholesterol and lipids. Again, the
functional implications of matches to this long helical (coiledcoil) domain are limited.

With a combination of structure prediction and sequencebased methods we were able gain insights into, and suggest
testable hypothesis for, all but three of the 17 proteins with
recognizable Htr domains; for Htr4, Htr7 and Htr17 we have
found no significant hits by any of the described methods.

deposited research

The Rosetta-predicted structure for the domain of unknown
function in Htr10 matched hemoglobin (PDB: 1ljwA) suggesting a role in aerotaxis and/or redox sensing. In the time
elapsed since the Rosetta structure prediction was generated,
the crystal structure of the Hemat sensor domain from B. subtilis (1OR4) was deposited in the PDB; we can now find a
match between domain 1 of Htr10 and 1OR4-A via PSIBLAST. As shown in Figure 2, our predicted structure match
to 1LJW-A is validated by this newly detected sequence match
to 1OR4-A. Htr12 has a amino-terminal Pfam match to
PF00989 (PAS domain). 3D-Jury also detects (via FFAS) a hit
to 1D06 (oxygen-sensing domain of Rhizobium meliloti Fixl)
over this amino-terminal region of Htr12. VNG1440h, connected to Htr12 by operon edge, had a separate Rosetta-predicted structure match to cytochrome C (2occC2). These
findings suggest a role for VNG1440h and Htr12 in aerotaxis
sensing. For Htr15, 3D-jury detects a hit to 1DP6-A (also the
heme binding domain of FixL). Given that changes in salinity
can dramatically alter the solubility of oxygen, the natural evironment of Halobacterium NRC-1 is in a perpetually dynamic
state with respect to oxygen.

reports

In the case of Htr6, its operon complement YufN was annotated as an ABC transporter without any ligand specificity.
YufN, however, has a strong match when analyzed by MetaServer/3D-jury to a D-glactose/D-glucose periplasmic binding protein, suggesting that Htr6 and YufN sense sugar in the
environment. This is supported by the observation that Halobacterium NRC-1 has a chemotaxis response towards glucose
[51].

reviews

Halobacterium NRC-1 can physically relocate to favorable
environments by virtue of a bacterial-like chemotaxis system
(chemotaxis, flagellar motor, and several signaling Htr/
methyl-accepting chemotaxis genes). The chemotaxis system
receives signals from sensors for light (Sop1-Htr1 and Sop2Htr2), oxygen (Htr8) [50], amino acids and sugars as well as
a variety of other small molecules [51]. Briefly, signals from
the environment are received by a sensing domain and transmitted to a methyl-accepting signaling domain (for example,
Htr1/Htr2). Htr proteins then transmit this signal to the flagellar machinery via CheA. Here we have defined Htr proteins
as those proteins containing the methyl-accepting chemotaxis domain, MCP, and sometimes containing a HAMP
domain (Pfam doamain PF00672) (HAMP domains are often
associated with MCP domains and they are found to be essential in transmitting signals between sensory input modules
and MCP domains) [52-54]. The Halobacterium NRC-1
genome encodes 17 such Htr proteins; Figure 2 shows these 17
Htr proteins and their neighbors in the association network.
All Htr proteins are connected to CheA via phylogenetic profile edges, probably reflecting the fact that Htr methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins are known to physically interact with
CheA. In general there is a much greater diversity in the sensing domains than in the Htr domains they interact with, and,
thus, we have yet to identify the corresponding sensing
domain for several of the Htr proteins in the Halobacterium
NRC-1 genome. Htr domains and their corresponding sensing domains are found both encoded on the same polypeptide
as well as on separate polypeptides with co-regulated expression levels. For instance, Sop1 and Sop2 are co-transcribed
with their signal transducers, Htr1 and Htr2 respectively, as
separate proteins organized into two-protein operons (see
Figure 2). Alternatively, Htr8 is transcribed as a single twodomain protein containing both a sensing domain and the
Htr domain on a single polypeptide chain. In five cases (Htr1,
Htr2, Htr3, Htr5, Htr8) the function (with respect to sensing
specificity) was known prior to this study. In the case of htr5
the identity of its operon complement (proX) points to roles
in chemotaxis towards osmoprotectants and amino acids
[55]. Htr3 has also been shown to be responsible for chemotactic response towards leucine, isoleucine, valine, methionine and cysteine. Along similar lines, htr18 has an operon
edge to potD, suggesting chemotaxis in response to lipids
(Table 1), although this has yet to be experimentally verified.
For the remaining Htr proteins, for which the corresponding
sensing domain has not been identified, we first examine
unannotated (non-MCP, non-HAMP) domains in the same
polypeptide and subsequently examine unannotated proteins
found in the same operon as the Htr in question, as these are
the domains in the genome most likely to function as the
required cognate sensing domain.

We describe below, three cases below where weak matches by
PSI-BLAST or FFAS to transcriptional regulators support our
de novo structure predictions and result in higher confidence
function predictions than possible by any one method. Furthermore, since transcriptional repressors and activators are
often encoded at termini of the operon the regulate [67], we
use functional associations such as conserved chromosomal
proximity and predicted operons, to suggest potential targets
for these regulators.

deposited research

The detection of potential transcriptional regulators in the
Halobacterium NRC-1 genome is central to an ongoing systems biology effort aimed at understanding its regulatory
mechanisms and ultimately its global gene regulatory circuitry. The majority of archaeal transcriptional regulators,
detected by sequence similarity, are small helical domains
that are well within the size and complexity limit of the
Rosetta structure prediction method. Therefore, we have
examined similarities of Rosetta-predicted structures to the
CATH fold families that correspond to the following archaeal
transcriptional regulators: 1.10.10.10, 1.10.10.60 and
1.10.472.10 [16]. Our results are summarized in Table 3 and
Figure 4. Although the majority of prokaryotic proteins
sharing these folds are involved in transcriptional regulation,
in general, a match via sequence or structure-based methods
to these small DNA binding domains can also have other
functional interpretations. Therefore, an important caveat is
that these function-predictions stand as putative transcription regulators or DNA binders. Ongoing analysis of global
gene expression patterns in Halobacterium NRC-1 will probably provide additional complementary information that will
help clarify the precise functional roles of these proteins.
Many of the predicted DNA binders or regulators described in
Table 3 also have weak sequence similarities to other
transcriptional regulators of known structure, detected via
PSI-BLAST or fold recognition, which support the Rosetta
predictions.

Likewise, the region on the small minichromosome from
VNG5040H to VNG5051G (duplicated on the reverse strand
as VNG5256 to VNG5246G) was also investigated as a region
likely to harbor prophage remnants. Again, we see many
examples of matches to the transposase DDE domain family
(PF01609). This region contains genes encoding a TATAbinding protein (TBP), TbpB, and a second protein
(VNG5048) whose Rosetta-predicted structure also matches
a TBP fold. For VNG5049H/5248H, we find a Rosetta predicted structure match to 2ezh, a fold that has been observed

in both transposases and transcription factors. We also find a
match for a Rosetta-predicted structure to an HIV capsid protein (1am3) for VNG5047H (Figure 3e). Thus in this region
(VNG5040H to VNG5051G), as in the region described above
(VNG6098H to VNG6121H), we have found hits to several
proteins often found within phage/viral genomes (transposase, integrase, capsid proteins, general transcription factors) possibly indicating that these regions are highly
divergent prophage remnants.

reviews

The IS-element region on pNRC200 spanning genes
VNG6098H to VNG6121H is duplicated on pNRC100
(VNG5101H to VNG5124H). We find several matches within
this region to the Pfam transposase DDE (PF01609) family of
proteins, first isolated from bacteriophage lambda [66]. We
also find two matches to phage integrases: VNG6112H
matches Pfam integrase family PF00589, while two Rosettapredicted structures for VNG6117H both match a phage integrase fold (1asu00). Finally, the Rosetta-predicted structure
for VNG6105H matches the capsid protein from Rous sarcoma virus (PDB: 1d1dA2). Thus our analysis suggests that
this region is a prophage remnant that has since diverged and
may no longer function as an active or complete phage.

source of lateral gene transfer and a major influence on
prokaryotic genome structure [56-59]. Most of this work,
however, has been carried out in bacteria-bacteriophage systems (see Table 2). To date, relatively few archaeal viruses
have been isolated and studied, although it is known that high
counts of phage particles are found in environments dominated by archaea, including hypersaline environments
[60,61]. This leads us to believe that phage integration events
might have played important roles in the evolution of Halobacterium NRC-1 through lateral gene transfer and chromosomal rearrangements. The 2.6 Mbp genome of
Halobacterium NRC-1 is organized as a 2,014kb chromosome
of 68% G+C and two smaller replicons pNRC100 (191 kb) and
pNRC200 (365 kb) of an average of 58% G+C [62,63]. One
striking feature of the Halobacterium NRC-1 genome is the
presence of an unusually large number of insertion sequences
(IS-elements); remarkably, 69 of the 91 IS-elements localize
to the two minichromosomes, which together constitute only
22% of the complete genome. Most of these IS-elements code
for transposases, which are often associated with phage
genomes and other mobile genetic elements [64,65]. Thus,
the high IS-element density combined with the lower G+C
content of the two minichromosomes, leads us to believe that
IS-element rich regions of the minichromosomes have been
recently introduced via lateral gene transfer. These IS-element rich regions have a higher percentage of proteins of
unknown function and are thus ideally suited for analysis by
the Rosetta method. We have examined several IS-element
rich regions of the large (pNRC200) and small (pNRC100)
minichromosomes and found evidence that these regions are
highly divergent prophage remnants.

information

In the third case, the Rosetta predicted fold match to diphtheria toxin repressor (1bi2-B) for VNG0039H, as well as a weak
hit by the FFAS method to the transcriptional regulator
1mkmA, suggest a winged helix fold and a transcriptional regulatory function or DNA binding function. VNG0039 has no
edges in the association network and is not a member or a
predicted operon. Again, further interpretation of the specific
role of VNG0039H in the cell is dependent on combining this
structure prediction with other systems-wide experiments
aimed at inferring the global genetic regulatory circuit.

Ultimately we will have to test all proposed regulators,
detected by sequence or structure, by performing gene knockouts followed by microarray analysis or by directly localizing
the binding sites of these proteins within the genome [68].
Thus, the predictions described in Table 3 represent a short
list of possible regulators, and serve to narrow the number of
proteins for which such costly experiments will have to be
performed.

encoded by the genes of this operon remain unresolved
beyond the general function prediction afforded by the
Rosetta and Pfam matches described above.

and comprehension of an important model archaeal system
that is central to an ongoing multi-institute systems biology
effort. We have shown that sources of putative annotation,
such as Rosetta de novo fold predictions and phylogenetic
profile predictions, become vastly more powerful when
integrated with the full repertoire of applicable methods and
presented to biologists in a well-collated and navigable environment. We would also like to note here that this database of
sequence and structure-based annotations was used, in combination with the association network, to interpret the results
of a recent study of the global response of Halobacterium
NRC-1 to ultraviolet radiation (providing insights into proteins of unknown function that were part of the global
response to ultraviolet radiation) [3]. Central to the acceptance of this work by the biological community is the flexible
data integration and visualization capabilities afforded by
Cytoscape and SBEAMS. Although we have shown here, and
elsewhere, examples of how this annotation system can generate testable biological hypotheses, an additional benefit of
this work will be realized by making the results, in the form of
the fully integrated dataset, publicly available. We also plan to
perform this analysis for a broader array of genomes (yeast,
selected human and mouse proteins, Haloarcula

marismortui, etc) and thus further expand the utility of this
approach.
Due to the errors inherent in current structure prediction and
domain parsing methods there are still many misannotations,
missed domain boundaries, and proteins with no annotation
in the Halobacterium NRC-1 genome, illustrating the need
for improvements in structure prediction methods and
domain parsing methods. Additionally, the use of Rosetta
requires large amounts of computer processing time compared to sequence-based and fold-recognition methods
(although Moore's law is rapidly making the computational
cost of de novo prediction a less pressing issue). In spite of
these caveats, integrating protein structure prediction with
several orthogonal sources of general and putative functional
information has allowed us to generate an experimentally
testable hypothesis for significant numbers of proteins of otherwise unknown function.

Material and methods
Protein selection and domain parsing
Rosetta predictions were generated for proteins and protein
domains lacking hits to known structure after parsing proteins into domains using Ginzu [37]. Ginzu implements a
hierarchically organized combination of sequence based
methods (primarily PSI-BLAST and Pfam) to separate proteins into domains and to reannotate regions of sequence
based on sequence homologies not present/detectable when
the genome was initially sequenced [69,70]. Ginzu first uses
PSI-BLAST to search for hits between the PDB and the query
sequence. If hits are found, regions of the query sequence corresponding to the PDB hit(s) are masked and the remaining
regions are searched against Pfam using HMMER. Hits to
Pfam are then masked and remaining regions are searched
against NCBI's 'nr' sequence set using PSI-BLAST. Multiple
sequence alignments resulting from this final PSI-BLAST run
(if homologs to the nr database are found) are then parsed
into domains (if possible) using the chili-eye-ball algorithm
[37]. Ginzu results primarily in a domain parsing of the query
sequence but also results in sequence homology based hits to
the PDB and domain annotations via Pfam. TMHMM [71]
was also run on the Halobacterium genome to detect
transmembrane regions. All of these sequence-based methods were run in-house with the exception of TMHMM.

For each query sequence 9,000 independent simulations
were carried out, each one resulting in a unique low energy
conformation. This ensemble of conformations was then clustered and ranked as previously described [29]; this resulted in
20 models for each query. These 20 models were then
searched against the PDB using mammoth. For each model,
mammoth produces a top-ranked match to the PDB and a Zscore for that match. The mammoth Z-score is related to the
closeness of the match between the predicted structure and
the experimental structure and the length of that structural
alignment [14].

Two confidence functions to predict the success of Rosetta
predictions were used in this study. The training of these confidence functions on an extensive benchmark is described
previously [29]. To predict success, defined as correct
structural superfamily identification, we used a confidence
function which takes as inputs the Z-score of the best structure-structure match [14] to the PDB for a given prediction as
well as the length and the simulation convergence as predictors of success.
The probability that one of our top five automatically generated fold predictions for a sequence is correct is a function of
the best Z-score to the PDB for the top five cluster centers (Z),
the simulation convergence or cluster threshold (C), and the
protein length (L) as follows:

 p
log 
 1− p


 = 0. 527 ( Z ) + 0. 012 ( L ) − 0. 239 ( C ) − 4. 97


Additionally, we can estimate the probability (p) that an individual fold-match between a single model and its closest
match in the PDB is correct. To do this we use the Z-score of
the individual model's best match to the PDB (Z), the degree
of simulation convergence (C), the length of the query protein
(L), and the ratio of the lengths of the hit in the PDB to the
length of the query (LH/LQ) as follows:
 p 
L
log 
 = 0.416 ( Z ) + 0.00982 ( L ) − 0. 326 ( C ) − 1. 01( H L ) − 2. 17
Q
 1− p 

Fold recognition
Key domains of unknown function (domains longer than 150
residues) were also submitted to the Meta-Server/3D-jury
[72-74]. Proteins were submitted to the MetaServer if too
large for analysis by Rosetta, or when Rosetta produced low
confidence or otherwise useless results for a given protein.
Protein regions with homologies to known structure were
modeled using Modeler and ModBase [75]. Several proteins
were also analyzed using FFAS03 [76,77].

comment

Edge types aimed at uncovering co-regulation patterns were
calculated based on chromosomal proximity; we used two
simple methods to predict conserved or significant chromosomal proximity. These methods were aimed at uncovering
statistically significant chromosomal proximity and not the
prediction of operons. One edge type indicates conserved patterns of proximity. Two proteins were given a chromosomalproximity link if they were within 300 bp of each other in
Halobacterium and had orthologs in at least one other organism within 300 bp [47]. This method has the disadvantage
that it cannot give us insight into the function of proteins
without orthologs in other systems. For proteins not grouped
by the above method we used the method of MorenoHagelsieb and Collado-Vides to predict significant proximities on the basis of distance alone, as previously described
[48]. A total of 1,662 links were generated by these two
operon prediction methods.

Yeast two-hybrid and H. pylori interactions were mapped
onto Halobacterium by orthology using the COG database. If
a pair of Halobacterium proteins belong to COGs known to
interact in the yeast two-hybrid data they are given a COGinferred yeast two-hybrid edge. Predictions also measured in
H. pylori (via a comprehensive target-bait experiment) were
also mapped onto Halobacterium protein pairs using this
method [42,43,79]. A total of 1,143 putative protein-protein
interaction edges were mapped onto Halobacterium in this
way. Comparative modeling of Halobacterium structures was
also used to predict protein-protein interactions. SCOP
(Structural Classification Of Proteins) classification for Halobacterium sp. proteins were identified, when possible, based
on homology modeling [75,80]. The SCOP classification is
then used to determine probable interactions based on the
prior observation that some pairs of SCOP families are known
to physically interact in protein complexes in the PDB with a
disproportionately high frequency [81]. The SCOP classifica-

For a given protein, the presence or absence of an ortholog in
fully sequenced genomes is termed its phylogenetic profile/
pattern. Two proteins with identical phylogenetic profiles are
often functionally related [45]. Domain fusion and
phylogenetic profile edges were taken from the Predictome
database [78]. A total of 2,946 domain fusion edges and 2,169
phylogenetic profile edges were added to the Halobacterium
network.

Data visualization
Cytoscape is a network visualization and exploration tool that
allows for the simultaneous visualization of microarray, proteomics and network data. Cytoscape also has links to several
external sources of annotation (KEGG, GO, etc.) and a broad
array of integrated programs (Biomodule calculation, simulation of regulatory dynamics, network aware promoter and
protein motif recognition, etc.) [49]. Cytoscape is currently a
open-source project being developed at several institutions.
See [82] for more information and for access to executables
and source-code. SBEAMS was used as the database wherein
the multitude of data-types described in this work were
stored, maintained and accessed throughout the annotation
process. SBEAMS provides convenient facilities for HTML
display of tables it contains, with seamless access to external
databases through a web interface. SBEAMS will be our primary portal through which data are released to the public.
Additionally, external users accessing the database can add
comments to any annotation/row in the table, thus allowing
us to reconcile/correct our annotation after initial release.
