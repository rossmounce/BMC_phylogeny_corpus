Molecular evolution of Azagny virus, a newfound
hantavirus harbored by the West African pygmy
shrew (Crocidura obscurior) in Côte d’Ivoire
Hae Ji Kang1, Blaise Kadjo2, Sylvain Dubey3, François Jacquet4 and Richard Yanagihara1*

Abstract
Background: Tanganya virus (TGNV), the only shrew-associated hantavirus reported to date from sub-Saharan
Africa, is harbored by the Therese’s shrew (Crocidura theresae), and is phylogenetically distinct from Thottapalayam
virus (TPMV) in the Asian house shrew (Suncus murinus) and Imjin virus (MJNV) in the Ussuri white-toothed shrew
(Crocidura lasiura). The existence of myriad soricid-borne hantaviruses in Eurasia and North America would predict
the presence of additional hantaviruses in sub-Saharan Africa, where multiple shrew lineages have evolved and
diversified.
Methods: Lung tissues, collected in RNAlater®, from 39 Buettikofer’s shrews (Crocidura buettikoferi), 5 Jouvenet’s
shrews (Crocidura jouvenetae), 9 West African pygmy shrews (Crocidura obscurior) and 21 African giant shrews
(Crocidura olivieri) captured in Côte d’Ivoire during 2009, were systematically examined for hantavirus RNA by RTPCR.
Results: A genetically distinct hantavirus, designated Azagny virus (AZGV), was detected in the West African pygmy
shrew. Phylogenetic analysis of the S, M and L segments, using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, under
the GTR+I+Γ model of evolution, showed that AZGV shared a common ancestry with TGNV and was more closely
related to hantaviruses harbored by soricine shrews than to TPMV and MJNV. That is, AZGV in the West African
pygmy shrew, like TGNV in the Therese’s shrew, did not form a monophyletic group with TPMV and MJNV, which
were deeply divergent and basal to other rodent- and soricomorph-borne hantaviruses. Ancestral distributions of
each hantavirus lineage, reconstructed using Mesquite 2.74, suggested that the common ancestor of all
hantaviruses was most likely of Eurasian, not African, origin.
Conclusions: Genome-wide analysis of many more hantaviruses from sub-Saharan Africa are required to better
understand how the biogeographic origin and radiation of African shrews might have contributed to, or have
resulted from, the evolution of hantaviruses.

Background
Sub-Saharan Africa has long been considered the “birthplace” of many medically important vector-borne and
zoonotic viruses. Among myriad examples are human
immunodeficiency virus type 1, which resulted from
multiple cross-species transmissions among nonhuman
primates to become well established in humans [1,2];
Ebola virus, a filovirus harbored by fruit bats [3,4],
which is among the deadliest viruses on earth; and

Lassa virus, a rodent-borne arenavirus [5], which causes
an estimated 100,000-500,000 human infections each
year in West African countries. In addition, the recent
report of Lujo virus as the cause of fatal hemorrhagic
fever in South Africa [6], where severe arenavirus-associated human disease had not been previously recognized, serves as a startling reminder that other
pathogenic zoonotic viruses remain undiscovered.
While rodents (Order Rodentia) have long been
known to serve as reservoirs of hantaviruses (Family
Bunyaviridae, Genus Hantavirus), recent studies indicate
a far richer genetic diversity among hantaviruses harbored by shrews (Order Soricomorpha, Family

Soricidae) and moles (Family Talpidae) of multiple species spanning across four continents, including Thottapalayam virus (TPMV) in the Asian house shrew
(Suncus murinus) [7,8], Imjin virus (MJNV) in the
Ussuri white-toothed shrew (Crocidura lasiura) [9], Cao
Bang virus (CBNV) in the Chinese mole shrew (Anourosorex squamipes) [10], Seewis virus (SWSV) in the Eurasian common shrew (Sorex araneus) [11,12], Ash River
virus (ARRV) in the masked shrew (Sorex cinereus) and
Jemez Spring virus (JMSV) in the dusky shrew (Sorex
monticolus) [13], Kenkeme virus (KKMV) in the flatskulled shrew (Sorex roboratus) [14], Camp Ripley virus
(RPLV) in the northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) [15], Asama virus (ASAV) in the Japanese
shrew mole (Urotrichus talpoides) [16], Oxbow virus
(OXBV) in the American shrew mole (Neurotrichus
gibbsii) [17], Nova virus (NVAV) in the European common mole (Talpa europaea) [18] and Rockport virus
(RKPV) in the eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus) [19].
Until recently, conspicuous in their absence have been
reports of hantaviruses in Africa. Sangassou virus
(SANV) in the African wood mouse (Hylomyscus simus)
[20] and Tanganya virus (TGNV) in the Therese’s shrew
(Crocidura theresae) [21] are the only known examples
to date, but additional hantaviruses likely exist in subSaharan Africa, where unique rodent and soricid
lineages have evolved and diversified.
In this study, lung tissues from crocidurine shrews
captured in Côte d’Ivoire were systematically analyzed
for hantavirus RNA by reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR). Undaunted by the vast genetic
diversity of hantaviruses harbored by shrews, we
resorted to a brute-force strategy of designing oligonucleotide primers based on regions of high sequence conservation. After exhaustive hit-and-miss attempts, a
genetically distinct hantavirus, designated Azagny virus
(AZGV), was detected in the West African pygmy shrew
(Crocidura obscurior). Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the S, M and L segments indicated that AZGV
shared a common ancestry with TGNV and was evolutionarily distant from TPMV and MJNV, two crocidurine shrew-borne hantaviruses in Asia.

intervals. Sherman and Longworth traps were set at
intervals of 5 m during daylight hours of each day.
Trapping was conducted over two to 10 consecutive
days, at Azagny National Park, Lamto Natural Reserve
and Dabou (Figure 1), during March, July, August,
November and December 2009. Traplines and pitfalls
were checked every morning and coordinates of each
trapped animal were recorded by the global positioning
system (GPS). Species, gender, weight, reproductive
maturity and GPS coordinates of each captured shew
were recorded. Lung tissues were collected in RNAlater ® RNA Stabilization Reagent (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA) and processed for RNA extraction, within 4
weeks of collection, for RT-PCR analysis. All experimental procedures on animals followed internationally
recognized guidelines and were approved by the Ivorian
National Park Office and the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle.
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis

Total RNA was extracted, using the PureLink Micro-toMidi total RNA purification kit (Invitrogen, San Diego,
CA), from shrew tissues, and cDNA was prepared using

Methods
Trapping and specimen collection

Shrews were live caught, using pitfall traps, as well as
Sherman traps (8 × 9 × 23 cm) (H.B. Sherman, Tallahassee, FL) and Longworth traps (14 × 6.5 × 8.5 cm)
(Penlon Ltd., Oxford, UK). Pitfall traplines were set with
drift fences using 1-m plastic sheeting or fine mesh
cloth erected between short poles and running across
plastic buckets that were 20-cm deep and buried flush
with the soil surface. Up to 20 buckets were placed
along 100- to 150-m long drift fences at 5- to 10-m

Biogeographic analyses

For secondary structure prediction of the nucleocapsid
protein and envelope glycoprotein, amino acid
sequences were submitted to NPS@ structure server
[22]. Glycosylation sites and transmembrane helices
were predicted using NetNlyc 1.0 and Predictprotein
[23] and TMHMM version 2.0 [24], respectively.

Ancestral distributions of each lineage were reconstructed using a maximum-likelihood approach using
Mesquite 2.74 [31]. The current geographic distribution
of hantavirus species was coded as 0 for Eurasia, 1 for
Africa, and 2 for America. Similarly, we tested for an
ancestral Soricomorpha (0) vs. Rodentia (1) origin of
hantaviruses. The model of character evolution was a
simple stochastic model (Mk1) [32], which assumed an
equal and symmetrical rate of change between any two
states [33,34], and the character state frequencies were
estimated from the transition probabilities. In this likelihood-based approach, the probability that a character
changes along a branch of the tree is consequently a
function of the branch length, with changes being less
likely along shorter branches than longer ones.
To have branch lengths representing absolute time of
divergence, a calibrated Bayesian tree was built with
BEAST 1.4 [35] using a Yule tree prior (adequate to
study interspecific diversification). Preliminary analyses
were performed with an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed
clock to test if a strict molecular clock can be rejected
for our dataset (ucld.stdev parameter with a frequency
histogram abutting 0). Because in our simulations the
‘’ucld.stdev’’ had a frequency histogram not abutting 0,
we chose this molecular clock for the analyses [36]. The
analyses were performed with two independent chains
and 10 million generations and chains were sampled
every 1,000 generations with a burn-in of 1 million generations. Convergences were determined with Tracer
v1.4 [37].

Phylogenetic analysis

mtDNA sequence analysis

Partial S-, M- and L-segment sequences of AZGV were
aligned and compared with publicly available hantavirus
sequences, using ClustalW (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison,
WI) [25] and transAlign [26]. Representative members
of the Nairovirus (Dugbe virus, NC_004157) and Phlebovirus (Rift Valley fever virus, NC_014395) genera were
included as outgroups. Phylogenetic trees were generated by maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods,
implemented in PAUP* (Phylogenetic Analysis Using
Parsimony, 4.0b10) [27], RAxML Blackbox webserver
[28] and MrBayes 3.1 [29], under the best-fit GTR+I+Γ
model of evolution established using jModeltest 0.1.1
[30]. By employing two complementary and not redundant ML methods, additional analytical rigor was
achieved. Topologies were evaluated by bootstrap analysis of 1,000 iterations, and posterior node probabilities
were based on 2 million generations and estimated sample sizes over 100 (implemented in MrBayes). Since tree
topologies for each genomic segment were very similar
using RAxML, PAUP* and MrBayes, trees generated by
MrBayes were displayed.

The entire 1,140-nucleotide region of the cytochrome b
gene of mtDNA was amplified by PCR, as previously
described [17,18], to confirm the taxonomic identity of
the hantavirus-infected shrew and to examine its phylogenetic relationship to other shrew hosts.

RT-PCR and DNA sequencing

PCR was performed as described previously [18], with
each 20-μL reaction containing 250 μM dNTP, 2 mM
MgCl2, 1 U of AmpliTaq polymerase (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and 0.25 μM of oligonucleotide primers, with
trial-and-error testing of primers and modified cycling
conditions. Initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min was followed by two cycles each of denaturation at 94°C for 40
sec, two-degree step-down annealing from 48°C to 38°C
for 40 sec, and elongation at 72°C for 1 min, then 32
cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 40 sec, annealing at 42°
C for 40 sec, and elongation at 72°C for 1 min, in a GeneAmp PCR 9700 thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham,
MA). Amplicons were purified using the QIAQuick Gel
Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and DNA
sequencing was performed using an ABI Prism 377XL
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

Results and Discussion
RT-PCR and sequence analysis

In analyzing lung tissues from 39 Buettikofer’s shrews
(Crocidura buettikoferi), 5 Jouvenet’s shrews (Crocidura
jouvenetae), 9 West African pygmy shrews (Crocidura
obscurior) and 21 African giant shrews (Crocidura olivieri) by RT-PCR using multiple primer pairs, novel
hantavirus RNAs were detected in a West African
pygmy shrew, captured in Azagny National Park (latitude, 5°14.5’ N; longitude, 4°48.1’ W), Côte d’Ivoire, on
December 15, 2009 (Figure 1). The identity of the West
African pygmy shrew (GenBank JF276229), in which
AZGV was detected, was confirmed by phylogenetic
analysis of the 1,140-nucleotide mtDNA cytochrome b
gene (results not shown).

Although hantavirus RNAs were not found in tissues
of the other three African crocidurine shrew species
tested, we believe it is simply because suitable oligonucleotide primers were not designed. This conjecture is
based on our past experience of repeated failed attempts
before the successful detection of soricomorph-borne
hantaviruses [17-19]. Thus, continuing efforts are
ongoing to retest these specimens, and future expeditions are being planned to collect tissues suitable for
virus isolation attempts.
Despite intensive efforts to obtain the full genome of
AZGV, the inability to effectively design primers for this
novel hantavirus and the limited amount of available
RNA were obstacles too great to overcome. Nevertheless, pairwise alignment and comparison of partial S-,
M- and L-genomic segment sequences of AZGV with
representative rodent- and soricid-borne hantaviruses
clearly demonstrated that AZGV was genetically distinct
(Table 1). AZGV was most closely related to TGNV

from neighboring Guinea and was highly divergent from
TPMV and MJNV, two crocidurine shrew-borne hantaviruses from Asia.
In a 540-nucleotide region of the AZGV S segment
(GenBank JF276226), the hypothetical nonstructural
protein (NSs) open-reading frame, found in arvicolid,
neotomine and sigmodontine rodent-borne hantaviruses,
was absent. Analysis of a 687-nucleotide region of the
AZGV M-genomic segment (GenBank JF276227), which
spanned the Gn-Gc juncture, showed the highly conserved WAASA amino acid motif cleavage site at positions 167 to 171. Potential N-linked glycosylation sites
were found at amino acid positions 46, 118 and 142 in
the Gn glycoprotein and 179 and 216 in the Gc gylcoprotein. Analysis of the nearly full-length 4,548-nucleotide AZGV L-genomic segment (GenBank JF276228),
encoding an incomplete RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of 1,516 amino acids, showed conservation of the
five major motifs, designated A, B, C, D and E [38].
Extensive analysis of the available AZGV genome,
using multiple recombination-detection methods,
including GENECONV, Bootscan, Chimaera, 3SEQ,
RDP, SiScan, MaxChi and HyPhy Single Recombinant
Breakpoint [39], failed to disclose any evidence of
genetic recombination.
Phylogenetic analysis and co-phylogeny mapping

High bootstrap support for a shared ancestry between
AZGV and TGNV, as evidenced by bootstrap values of
>70% and posterior node probabilities of >0.70, was
found in phylogenetic trees, based on available S- and
L-segment sequences, using the maximum-likelihood
(ML) and Bayesian methods (Figure 2). That is, AZGV
in the West African pygmy shrew, like TGNV in the
Therese’s shrew [21], did not form a monophyletic
group with TPMV in the Asian house shrew [8] and
MJNV in the Ussuri white-toothed shrew [9], which
were deeply divergent and basal to other rodent- and
soricomorph-borne hantaviruses, with longer branch
lengths suggesting greater evolutionary change and possibly older age.
Phylogenetic trees, reconstructed for co-phylogeny
mapping using TreeMap 2.0b [40], exhibited high bootstrap support for each genomic segment (at both the
nucleotide and amino acid levels), with segregation of
hantaviruses, according to the Subfamily of their soricomorph reservoir hosts. That is, congruent topologies
were found in the host-virus phylogenetic relationships,
except for previously reported hantaviruses hosted by
two species of shrew moles [16,17].
Biogeographic analyses

Because the choice of basal taxa can strongly influence
the biogeographic reconstruction of the target taxa in

such analyses, the outgroups (Dugbe virus and Rift Valley fever virus) were not included in the analyses. As
shown in Figure 3, the common ancestor of all hantaviruses likely emerged in Eurasia rather than Africa (ML
support, 87%). Moreover, the analyses suggested that the
ancestral hosts of hantaviruses may have been members
of the Soricomorpha, rather than Rodentia (ML support,
56%). However, genomic analyses of many more soricomorph-borne hantaviruses, and studies in search of hantaviruses in other potential reservoir hosts, especially
insectivorous bats (Order Chiroptera), are necessary to
validate these tentative conclusions.
Biogeographic reconstruction, based on fossil records
and assuming equally probable exchanges between continents in both directions, suggests that the Family Soricidae originated in Eurasia [33]. And based on
karyologic, paleontologic and molecular genetic data, a
Palaearctic-Oriental origin has been proposed for the
genus Crocidura, dating to the Upper Miocene (6.8 million years before present) [34]. Moreover, in-depth analysis of 3,560-base pairs of mitochondrial and nuclear
DNA of crocidurine shrews from across Eurasia and

Africa, reveals that shrews belonging to the genus Crocidura segregate into an Afrotropical clade, an Asian
clade and an Old World clade, which includes Afrotropical, East Palaearctic-Oriental and West Palaearctic
species [34]. Crocidura obscurior groups into the Old
World clade, while Crocidura theresae, as well as Crocidura buettikoferi, Crocidura jouvenetae and Crocidura
olivieri, group in the Afrotropical clade, and Crocidura
lasiura in the Asian clade.
Apart from Côte d’Ivoire, the West African pygmy
shrew is found in subtropical or tropical moist lowland
forests in Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and possibly Nigeria. A similar West African distribution is
noted for Crocidura buettikoferi and Crocidura jouvenetae, while Crocidura olivieri is far more widespread,
from west to east across sub-Saharan Africa [41].
Although previous ecological studies had indicated that
Crocidura theresae, the presumed reservoir of TGNV, is
widespread and abundant in Côte d’Ivoire [42,43], this
crocidurine shrew species was not captured during any
of our multiple trapping expeditions. As such, we were
unable to confirm the presence of TGNV in the

Figure 3 Phylogenetic distribution and reconstruction.
Phylogenetic distribution and reconstruction of ancestral states for
(A) the biogeographic origin (America, Eurasia or Africa) and (B) the
host (Soricomorpha or Rodentia) of hantaviruses using Mesquite
2.74 (with a representation of ML supports for each state and node,
and ML support [in bold] for the basal nodes). Bayesian posterior
probabilities from BEAST are shown for each node in (A).

Therese’s shrew or to analyze the genetic diversity and
phylogeography of TGNV.
In this regard, future studies are warranted to confirm
that the West African pygmy shrew is the true reservoir
host of AZGV. Also, whole genome sequence analysis of
many more hantaviruses from sub-Saharan Africa are
required to gain a better understanding about how the
biogeographic origin and radiation of African shrews
might have contributed to, or have resulted from, the
evolution and cross-species transmission of hantaviruses.
Intensified efforts are underway in search of hantaviruses in other shrew species, including Myosorex and
Sylvisorex shrews, which are not found elsewhere and
are unique to Africa. Meanwhile, the disproportionately
high number of hantaviruses hitherto discovered in soricomorphs over a relatively brief period of searching, and
the far greater genetic diversity of shrew- and moleborne hantaviruses, compared to those harbored by
rodents, provide additional support for the emerging
concept that soricomorphs may have served as the early
reservoirs of ancestral hantaviruses.
