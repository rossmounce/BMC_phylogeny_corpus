Abstract
Background: We have previously described the identification and characterization of polyserase-1 and polyserase-2,
two human serine proteases containing three different catalytic domains within the same polypeptide chain. Polyserase1 shows a complex organization and it is synthesized as a membrane-bound protein which can generate three
independent serine protease domains as a consequence of post-translational processing events. The two first domains
are enzymatically active. By contrast, polyserase-2 is an extracellular glycosylated protein whose three protease domains
remain embedded in the same chain, and only the first domain possesses catalytic activity.
Results: Following our interest in the study of the human degradome, we have cloned a human liver cDNA encoding
polyserase-3, a new protease with tandem serine protease domains in the same polypeptide chain. Comparative analysis
of polyserase-3 with the two human polyserases described to date, revealed that this novel polyprotein is more closely
related to polyserase-2 than to polyserase-1. Thus, polyserase-3 is a secreted protein such as polyserase-2, but lacks
additional domains like the type II transmembrane motif and the low-density lipoprotein receptor module present in the
membrane-anchored polyserase-1. Moreover, analysis of post-translational mechanisms operating in polyserase-3
maturation showed that its two protease domains remain as integral parts of the same polypeptide chain. This situation
is similar to that observed in polyserase-2, but distinct from polyserase-1 whose protease domains are proteolytically
released from the original chain to generate independent units. Immunolocalization studies indicated that polyserase-3 is
secreted as a non-glycosylated protein, thus being also distinct from polyserase-2, which is a heavily glycosylated protein.
Enzymatic assays indicated that recombinant polyserase-3 degrades the α-chain of fibrinogen as well as pro-urokinasetype plasminogen activator (pro-uPA). Northern blot analysis showed that polyserase-3 exhibits a unique expression
pattern among human polyserases, being predominantly detected in testis, liver, heart and ovary, as well as in several
tumor cell lines.
Conclusion: These findings contribute to define the growing group of human polyserine proteases composed at present
by three different proteins. All of them share a complex structural design with several catalytic units in a single
polypeptide but also show specific features in terms of enzymatic properties, expression patterns and post-translational
maturation mechanisms.

Background
The presence of several catalytic domains embedded in
the same polypeptide chain is an unusual molecular feature, whose evolutionary or functional advantages are still
unclear [1]. However, recent works have provided evidence that a number of proteins from different organisms
exhibit these complex architectures. Among these multidomain enzymes there are luciferases, xylanases, chitinases,
endoglucanases, kinases, and diverse hydrolases including proteases [2-9]. The occurrence of human proteases
with different catalytic domains in the same translation
product was first reported for two metalloproteinases:
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and carboxypeptidase D [10,11]. ACE is a type-I membrane-bound metalloproteinase with two enzymatically active domains
which shows specific catalytic constants and interact differently with several competitive inhibitors [12]. Carboxypeptidase D is also a type-I membrane metalloproteinase
that contains three catalytic domains, two of them being
catalytically active and showing optimal activities at different pHs [13]. More recently, and as part of our studies
on mammalian degradomes – the entire protease complement of these organisms [14-17] –, we have identified and
characterized a cDNA encoding an unusual mosaic protease called polyserase-1 [9] (polyserine protease-1). This
protein shows a complex domain organization including
a type-II transmembrane motif, a low-density lipoprotein
receptor A module, and three tandem serine protease
domains. Interestingly, analysis of post-translational
processing mechanisms of polyserase-1 revealed that it is
synthesized as a membrane-bound protein which undergoes a series of proteolytic processing events to generate
three independent serine protease domains [9]. Further
studies of the human degradome have revealed the occurrence of another gene coding for a protein with three tandem serine protease domains in a single polypeptide
chain [3]. This protein – called polyserase-2 – is an extracellular glycosylated enzyme, whose three serine protease
domains are not proteolytically cleaved and remain as an
integral part of the same polypeptide chain. Enzymatic
analysis of polyserase-2 has demonstrated that only its
first protease domain is catalytically active, whereas the
second and third domains are inactive due to the lack of
critical residues present in the catalytic triad of serine proteases [3].
The finding of two polyserine proteases in the human
genome, together with the presence of similar mosaic
structures in serine proteases from other organisms such
as Xenopus laevis, Bufo japonicus, Drosophila melanogaster
and Caenorhabditis elegans [18-21], prompted us to
explore the possibility that additional yet uncharacterized
polyserases could be produced by human tissues. In this
work, we report the finding of a novel human protein,
tentatively called polyserase-3, which contains two serine

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/7/9

protease domains in its amino acid sequence. We describe
the molecular cloning of a full-length cDNA for this protein, and perform a structural and enzymatic analysis of
this new protease. We also examine the expression pattern
of polyserase-3 in human tissues and tumor cell lines, and
perform a comparative analysis between this enzyme and
the previously described polyserases-1 and -2 in terms of
structural design, phylogenetic relationships, cellular
location and post-translational maturation mechanisms.
On the basis of the obtained results, we conclude that
polyserase-3 is more closely related to polyserase-2 than
to polyserase-1, but also exhibits a series of characteristic
features unique for this novel polyprotein among all other
polyserine proteases described to date.

Results
Identification and molecular cloning of a new human
polyserine protease
We used the polyserase-2 cDNA as a query and the BLAST
algorithm to search regions in the human genome that
could encode new proteases with several serine protease
domains within the same polypeptide chain. This search
allowed us to identify a region in chromosome 16p11.2
containing two serine protease domains closely linked.
Conceptual translation of these domains showed that
they were different to the serine protease domains of
polyserase-2 and prostasin, which are serine protease
genes located at the same chromosomal region [3,22].
Then, a PCR-based approach was designed to clone the
cDNAs for these two uncharacterized serine protease
domains. To this end, we used RNA from human liver and
once the cloning process was completed, we confirmed
that both domains were encoded by a single gene. Computer analysis of the obtained sequence revealed that this
cDNA encodes a protein of 553 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 58.4 kDa (Fig. 1A and EMBL
accession number AJ627035). Following the nomenclature system proposed for these enzymes [9], we have tentatively called this new polyserine protease polyserase-3.

A detailed analysis of polyserase-3 sequence showed that
it contains the structural hallmarks characteristic of serine
proteases (Fig. 1A), with some relevant particularities.
Thus, the sequence contains a signal peptide (positions 1
to 23), which predicts that this protein is targeted to the
endoplasmic reticulum to direct its secretion outside of
the cell. Following this region, the first serine protease
domain (Spd1) can be recognized (positions 28 to 270)
although this domain does not show the Arg-↓-Ile-ValGly-Gly consensus activation motif present in most of
these enzymes. The sequence present instead at this region
is Pro-Lys-Pro-Gln-Glu. The catalytic triad of Spd1 comprises the residues His77, Asp128, and Ser224. Following
a short spacer region (positions 271 to 294), the second
serine protease domain (Spd2) can be clearly identified

(positions 295 to 553). This domain also lacks a consensus activation motif and its catalytic triad comprises the
residues His341, Asp382, and Ser478. This last Ser residue
is located within the sequence Gly-Leu-Ser-Gly-Ala (positions 476 to 480), which does not exactly match the consensus motif Gly-Asp-Ser-Gly-Gly found in this class of
enzymes. There are also a number of cysteine residues in
both protease domains of polyserase-3 which are conserved in serine proteases, including those located at positions 28 and 144 in Spd1, and 296 and 402 in Spd2. These
residues could form two disulfide bonds which would
determine that both protease domains remain linked to
the polypeptide chain if a cleavage would take place at the
activation site (Fig 1B). All these structural features can
also be found in the amino acid sequence of putative
orthologs of polyserase-3 predicted from the genome
analysis of Pan troglodytes (99% identity), Bos taurus
(80%), Canis familiaris (84%), Mus musculus (81%), and
Rattus norvegicus (80%) (Fig. 1C).
Comparative analysis of polyserase-3 with other serine
proteases
The predicted amino acid sequence corresponding to the
catalytic region of each polyserase-3 protease domain
revealed a high degree of identity with other serine proteases (Fig 2). Comparative analysis of the first serine protease domain sequence indicated that the highest degree
of identity was found with the first serine protease
domain of polyserase-2 (40%). Significant percentage of
identities were also found with pancreasin (36%), the second serine protease domain of polyserase-2 (35%),
matriptase-2 (35%), prostasin (34%), and the third serine
protease domain of polyserase-2 (34%). The second
domain of polyserase-3 was also found to be closely
related to the first protease domain of polyserase-2 (38%)
as well as to other serine proteases such as γ-tryptase
(37%), the second serine protease domain of polyserase2 (34%), prostasin (33%), matriptase-2 (34%), and the
first serine protease domain of polyserase-1 (32%). All
these enzymes, with the exception of polyserase-2, belong
to the transmembrane type (TTSP) or to the tryptase/pancreasin families of serine proteases [23-26]. Sequence
alignments of these proteins with each protease domain
of polyserase-3 (Fig. 2A) confirmed the extensive degree
of conservation around the residues that form the catalytic
triad of all these proteases. We also performed an analysis
in the polyserase-3 sequence of molecular markers of serine protease evolution described by Krem and Di Cera
[20]. This analysis revealed that polyserase-3 as well as
polyserases- 1 and -2 use exclusively TCN codons for their
active site serine residues (corresponding to Ser-195 in the
chymotrypsinogen sequence). We also found that the Ser
residues of all polyserases, which are equivalent to the Ser214 residue of chymotrypsinogen, are always encoded by
AGC codons. Finally, analysis of the third molecular

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/7/9

marker associated with catalytic function in serine proteases (Pro or Tyr residues at position 225 in chymotrypsinogen numbering) revealed the presence of a Pro
residue in both domains of polyserase-3. Likewise, Pro
residues are present at the equivalent positions in the
three serine protease domains of polyserase-1 as well as in
the catalytically active domain of polyserase-2. Taken
together, these results reinforce the classification of these
polyproteases in the clan SA of serine proteases and
extend the proposal of a close evolutionary relationship
between them.
The phylogenetic tree for these proteins (Fig. 2B) also
showed the close relationship of each polyserase-3 serine
protease domain with the equivalent regions of
polyserase-2. Together, the five protease domains of these
two polyserases form a phylogenetic branch distantly
related to the TTSP and tryptase/pancreasin families of
serine proteases. Furthermore, the exon-intron organization of the catalytic region of the first domain of
polyserase-3 is similar to that of TTSP and tryptase/pancreasin serine protease genes. In fact, the length of the
intron that separates the exons containing the His and Asp
residues of the catalytic triad of the first protease domain
of polyserase-3, is similar to that found in the equivalent
region of matriptase-2 [27,28]. However, the length of the
remaining introns is similar to that found in the equivalent regions of the α/β-tryptases (Fig 2C). We have previously described that the polyserase-2 gene also shows a
pattern of exon-intron organization that shares similarities with both groups of serine proteases [3]. Likewise, the
polyserase-3 gene also contains three coding exons in the
genomic region that comprises the signal sequence and
the putative activation site. By contrast, only two coding
exons are found in the equivalent region of α/β-tryptase
genes [29-32].
Molecular modeling of polyserase-3 serine protease
domains
The amino acid sequence similarity between each serine
protease domain of polyserase-3 and serine proteases
whose three-dimensional structures are available, opened
the possibility of performing their structural modeling
(Fig. 3). This analysis revealed a significant degree of similarity between both domains of polyserase-3 and some
members of the tryptase family, such as human β-tryptase
II [33]. Thus, in the predicted structure there is a loop that
surrounds a calcium ion in most serine proteases (shown
in yellow in Fig. 3) [34], although in the case of Spd1 and
β-II tryptase is shorter, and it does not exist in Spd2, suggesting that polyserase-3 does not requires calcium for its
activity. Apart from the disulfide bonds deduced from the
alignment of polyserase-3 sequence with other serine proteases, the structural model of polyserase-3 predicts the
existence of seven additional disulfide bonds. Four of

Homology
Homology models of the catalytic domains of polyserase-3 and β-II tryptase. The structural modeling of Spd-1 and Spd-2
reveals the high degree of similarity with the serine protease β-II tryptase. The twelve loops (six in each serine protease module) potentially involved in the dimerization of polyserase-3 as well as the 6 loops involved in β-II tryptase tetramerization are
represented using the color code previously described by Sommerhoff et al. 1999 (33). The molecules are oriented towards
the active site and the three residues that compose the catalytic triad of each serine protease are indicated. The backbone and
side chains of the disulfide bonds are represented in CPK color scheme.

these bonds are predicted to occur within Spd1, and the
eight cysteine residues involved would be Cys62-Cys78,
Cys158-Cys230, Cys187-Cys209, and Cys220-Cys249.
Equivalent disulfide bonds are predicted in the structure
of the human β-tryptase II (Fig. 3). The three remaining
bonds would occur within Spd2, and the involved residues would be Cys326-Cys342, Cys444-Cys464, and
Cys474-Cys502 (Fig. 3).
Polyserase-3 is a secreted and non-glycosylated protein
The pCEP-pol3 vector was used to transfect 293-EBNA
cells. Immuno-localization experiments using an antiFLAG antibody showed a strong eccentric perinuclear signal (Fig. 4A). Moreover, and consistent with the absence

of a membrane localization motif in the polyserase-3
sequence, we did not find any evidence of immunostaining at the cell surface. Similar results were obtained using
HeLa cells transfected with the pCEP-pol3 vector (not
shown). Likewise, the positive signal was only detected if
cells were previously permeabilized using Triton X-100.
This situation resembles that observed for polyserase-2 [3]
and differs from that of polyserase-1, which is a membrane-bound polyprotease [9]. All these findings strongly
suggest that polyserase-3 is a secreted polyserine protease.
This possibility was further confirmed by Western blot
analysis of the conditioned medium prepared from pCEPpol3 transfected cells (Fig. 4B). In fact, the anti-FLAG antibody detected one immunoreactive band of about 55

kDa, which fits with the expected size for unprocessed
polyserase-3. On the other hand, a doublet of similar size,
which likely represents the protein with or without signal
peptide, was detected in cell fractions, but none of them
were present in cells transfected with the empty vector. To
evaluate the possibility that the FLAG epitope could hamper the proper processing of the two serine protease
domains of polyserase-3, we generated a construct lacking
this epitope but keeping a HisTag tail at the C-terminus.
Western blot analysis using an anti-HisTag antibody
showed the same result as above (not shown), thereby
confirming that both protease domains of polyserase-3
remain as integral parts of the same polypeptide chain.
Additionally, and contrary to polyserase-2, the mobility of
the band detected with this anti-HisTag antibody was not
altered in the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of Nglycosylation, suggesting that polyserase-3 is a non-glycosylated protein. Consistent with this, analysis of the

polyserase-3 sequence using the NetNGlyc 1.0 Server [35]
predicted that the only putative N-glycosylation site
present in this protein (Asn543), would not be effectively
glycosylated.
Production, purification and enzymatic assays of fulllength polyserase-3 and its serine-protease domains
To produce the recombinant proteins, we first transformed E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysE with plasmids
pGEX-pol3Spd1, pGEX-pol3Spd2, and pGEX-pol3. Moreover, we used ADAM23 disintegrin domain fused to GST
to verify the purification processes as well as a negative
control in the enzymatic assays [36]. After IPTG induction
of bacterial cells transformed with these plasmids, fusion
proteins of the expected size (55, 57, 83 and 36 kDa
respectively) were detected by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5A). Once
the purification process was carried out as indicated
above, the fusion proteins were visualized by SDS-PAGE

Analysis 7 polyserase-3 expression in human tissues and tumor cell lines
Analysis of polyserase-3 expression in human tissues and tumor cell lines. Approximately 2 µg of polyadenylated RNA from the
indicated tissues or tumor cell lines was hybridized with a probe specific for polyserase-3. The position of the RNA markers is
shown. The filters were subsequently hybridized with an actin probe to ascertain the differences in RNA loading among the different tissues.

(Fig. 5A), and their identities confirmed by Western blotting using an anti-GST antibody (Fig. 5B). We next incubated the recombinant protein with a variety of different
endogenous proteins including type I collagen, type I laminin, gelatin, pro-uPA and fibrinogen were treated with
the recombinant proteases. Among all these potential
extracellular substrates, fibrinogen and pro-UPA were
clearly degraded by the entire polyserase-3, but not by its
serine protease domains produced as independent proteins (Fig. 5C–E, and data not shown). This activity was
abolished by preincubating the enzyme with AEBSF, a serine protease inhibitor, but not when the enzyme was
treated with inhibitors of other classes of proteases (Fig.
5D). These data provide additional support to the proposal of this enzyme as a catalytically active serine protease. Moreover, SDS-PAGE analysis of the recombinant
polyserase-3 incubated for 16 h at 37°C also indicates that
the enzyme is released from the GST-moiety (data not
shown), which could be due to an autoactivation process
of polyserase-3, similarly to fusion proteins containing
the catalytic domain of matriptase-1 [37] or matriptase-2
[28].

mast cell tryptase [38], are able to degrade the α-chain of
fibrinogen when forming tetramers in a similar manner to
that shown herein for polyserase-3. On this basis, we
hypothesized that two polyserase-3 molecules could associate to produce a protein structurally equivalent to the
tetramers formed by this type of tryptases. To evaluate this
question, we produced a recombinant protein containing
a 6xHisTag tail at the N-terminus. This new recombinant
polyserase-3, purified as described in Experimental Procedures, was incubated in the presence or absence of a
reducing agent (2-mercaptoethanol) and detected by
Western blot using an anti-HisTag antibody (Fig. 6A). The
presence of two immunoreactive bands in native conditions and one band of the expected size in the sample containing the denaturing reagent suggested that polyserase-3
forms dimers which seems to be stabilized by disulfide
bridges, as reported for the dog mast cell protease-3 [39].
Interestingly, this recombinant 6xHis tagged polyserase-3
degrades fibrinogen similarly to the GST-polyserase-3
protein (Fig. 6B), suggesting that fibrinogen degradation
by the fusion protein, could occur once polyserase-3 is
released from the GST.

Polyserase-3 may form active dimers
Some tryptases, which share several features with
polyserase-3, can form active tetramers. Moreover, other
members of this group of serine proteases, such as mouse

cell lines (Fig. 7). This analysis showed a band of about
7.5 kb in different adult tissues including liver, heart, testis, ovary, intestine, colon and leukocytes. A band of the
same size was observed in all analyzed fetal tissues such as
kidney, liver, lung and brain. This transcript was also
detected in human cancer cell lines, including HeLa (cervix adenocarcinoma), MOLT-4 (lymphoblastic leukaemia),
and
SW480
(colon
adenocarcinoma).
Bioinformatic analysis using different programs available
at the NIX tool [40], predicts a transcript of around 8 kb
for this gene, suggesting that the higher band observed in
Fig. 7, likely corresponds to a full-length polyserase-3
transcript. However, other transcripts of 5.2 kb and 4.2 kb
were observed at placenta, testis, HeLa and MOLT-4 cells.
The presence of these transcripts of smaller size suggests
that the polyserase-3 gene could also be regulated through
alternative splicing events which may produce a protein
without one of its serine protease domains. This mRNA
processing of a multidomain protease has also been
described for polyserases -1 and -2 [3,9].

Discussion
In this work, we have performed an exhaustive bioinformatic analysis of the human genome to try to identify new
serine proteases that could contain different catalytic
domains within the same polypeptide chain. These bioinformatic searches led us to find a region in chromosome
16p11.2 putatively encoding a new polyprotease. After
completing the cloning process using liver cDNA as template, we confirmed that the identified sequence was a
new polyserine proteinase that we called polyserase-3 to
underline its structural relationship with the previously
described polyserases-1 and -2 [3,9]. However, the
polyserase-3 architecture is less complex than the exhibited by the two other human polyproteases. Thus, this
new polyserase is composed of two serine protease
domains preceded by a signal peptide, whereas both
polyserase-1 and polyserase-2 contain three catalytic
domains in a single polypeptide chain.
A comparative structural analysis also revealed that
polyserase-3 is more closely related to polyserase-2 than
to polyserase-1. Thus, and similar to polyserase-2,
polyserase-3 is a secreted soluble protein that lacks additional domains found in polyserase-1 such as a type II
transmembrane sequence and a low-density lipoprotein
receptor motif. Likewise, the serine protease domains of
polyserase-2 and polyserase-3 remain as integral parts of
the same molecule, whereas polyserase-1 undergoes a
series of post-translational processing events that release
the three protease domains from the initial translation
product [9]. The structural basis for these differences may
derive from the fact that both protease domains of
polyserase-3, as well as the second and third protease
domains of polyserase-2, are preceded by a region lacking

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/7/9

the consensus activation motif Arg-Ile-Val-Gly-Gly, characteristic of serine proteases. Therefore, it is unlikely that
these domains can be separated from the original
polypeptide chain by a trypsin-like protease. Nevertheless,
the possibility that polyserase-3 can be activated under
specific circumstances through alternative mechanisms
such as those operating in α-tryptase [41,42], can not be
ruled out.
The phylogenetic analysis of human serine proteases
whose sequence is available, also revealed the relationship between polyserases-2 and -3, since the different serine protease domains of both polyproteases are grouped
together and form a branch equally distant from members
of the TTSP and the tryptase/prostasin families. Interestingly, analysis of the gene structure and organization of
polyserases-2 and -3 showed common features with these
two groups of serine proteases. Therefore, it is possible
that ancestors of both TTSPs and tryptase/prostasin contributed to the formation of these polyserases through
recombination or exon swapping events. Likewise, the
gene encoding polyserase-3 maps very close to the
polyserase-2 and prostasin genes at chromosome
16p11.2, a region linked to genetic abnormalities whose
loci remain unidentified. These pathologies include paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis [43] and autosomal
dominant myxomatous mitral valve prolapse [44], opening the possibility that the identified human polyserases
could be implicated in the development of these diseases.
Nevertheless, beyond all these similarities between
human polyserases-2 and -3, clear differences were also
detected between them. Thus, we have previously
reported that polyserase-2 is a glycosylated protein that
only shows catalytic activity in its first serine protease
domain. By contrast, polyserase-3 is a secreted and nonglycosylated enzyme.
As an initial step towards the functional characterization
of polyserase-3, we analyzed its expression profile in different human tissues. These studies revealed additional
differences between polyserase-3 and the previously
described human polyserases in their patterns of expression in different tissues and cancer cell lines. Thus,
polyserase-3 is mainly expressed in adult heart, liver,
intestine, ovary and testis, as well as in all analyzed fetal
tissues including kidney, brain, liver and lung. By contrast, polyserase-2 is predominantly detected in adult skeletal muscle, liver, placenta, prostate and heart, as well as
in fetal kidney but not in fetal lung, liver or brain. It is also
noteworthy that several human tumor cell lines also
express this new polyprotease, a feature shared with the
previously described human polyserases, opening the
possibility that these complex serine proteases could
mediate proteolytic processes associated with tumor
development or progression [26,45].

BMC Biochemistry 2006, 7:9

To evaluate the possibility that polyserase-3 is an active
enzyme with ability to perform these proteolytic events,
we undertook the production of the entire protein as well
as its two serine protease domains as independent proteins. The activity assays showed that the complete
polyserase-3 is able to degrade some substrates present in
the extracellular matrix such as fibrinogen and pro-uPA.
These results suggest that this enzyme could contribute to
tumor progression either through the degradation of
extracellular matrix proteins or the activation of other
components including different tumor-associated proteases [46]. Contrary to the situation with the entire protein, the two serine protease domains produced as
independent proteins did not show any apparent proteolytic activity against the substrates indicated above. Interestingly, members of the tryptase family – that show
significant degree of structural similarity with both protease domains of polyserase-3- are secreted as monomers
and must form tetramers to carry out the catalysis [33].
These facts prompted us to evaluate whether this enzyme
could dimerize to generate a protein with four potential
active sites, and whose quaternary structure could be similar to that formed by the tryptases. To analyze this possibility, we compared the electrophoretic mobility of the
recombinant protein under non-reducing and reducing
conditions. This assay would indicate that approximately
half of the purified polyserase-3 may form active dimers
which are likely stabilized through the formation of
disulfide bonds. The information derived from the threedimensional models generated for Spd1 and Spd2 was
also consistent with this possibility. Thus, these models,
together with predictions based on amino acid sequence
alignments, suggest that polyserase-3 possesses a total of
nine intrachain disulfide bonds. However, there are three
free cysteines (Cys189, 293 and 543) that could be
involved in the stabilization of the polyserase-3 dimer
through the formation of disulfide bonds. The stability of
the dimer would be further maintained by a series of conserved tryptophan residues (Trp 48, 50, 159 and 237 in
Spd-1, and Trp 312, 314, 417 and 490 in Spd2) that have
been reported to be necessary for mouse mast cell tryptase
dimerization and activity [38]. Interestingly, this protease
can also cleave the α-chain of fibrinogen as demonstrated
herein for polyserase-3. Due to the homology of
polyserase-3 and β-II tryptase, we cannot rule out the
existence of further interactions involving hydrogen
bonds and salt bridges and participating in the dimer formation through the six loops (code-colored in Fig. 5A)
previously described for β-II tryptase [33]. Regarding the
fact that fibrinogen cannot be cleaved by Spd1 or Spd2
produced as independent proteins, we can speculate that
the presence of three aspartic acid residues (Asp164, 166
and 169) in a loop of Spd1 could form a negatively
charged anchoring site that would compete with the substrate binding pocket when the protein is in a monomer

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/7/9

state. Stabilization of this loop in the dimer state, probably by Spd2, would grant access for the substrate to the
active site. These acidic residues seem also to be important
for β-II tryptase, whose enzymatic activity is totally abolished in the monomer state [33]. Nevertheless, further
functional studies will be necessary to verify these predictions in the case of polyserase-3.

Conclusion
The identification of the third human polyserase allows
establishing the polyserases as a group of enzymes containing different tandem serine protease domains. These
findings raise new questions about the functions of these
intriguing polyenzymes and their possible involvement in
human diseases. In particular, the search for the in vivo
substrates of polyserase-3 and the generation of mice deficient in this gene would contribute to ascertain the relevance of this enzyme in both normal and pathological
conditions. Finally, the resolution of the three- dimensional structure of polyserase-3 and that of the remaining
human polyserases, could help to understand the functional relevance of the presence of several catalytic
domains within the same polypeptide chain.

Methods
Materials
Nylon filters containing polyadenylated RNAs from
human tissues and tumor cell lines were purchased from
Clontech. Restriction endonucleases and different reagents for molecular cloning, including the Expand™ High
Fidelity PCR system and the Thermoscript reverse transcription-PCR system were from Roche Applied Science.
DNA probes were radiolabeled using [α-32P]dCTP (3000
Ci/mmol) and a random-priming kit from Amersham
Biosciences.
Bioinformatic analysis and cDNA cloning
Human polyserase-2 cDNA and the BLAST program were
used to query regions in the human genome that could be
predicted as new polyserase genes. These searches allowed
us to identify a putative region in chromosome 16p11.2
that encoded a new enzyme with two seine protease
domains. Then, a PCR-based strategy was used to clone
the full-length cDNA for this novel polyprotease. To this
end, specific oligonucleotides derived from the genomic
sequences were used to screen a panel of human cDNA
libraries for transcripts corresponding to this new polyserine protease. The sequences of the designed primers were
pol3-f1 (forward) 5'- GGCTGCCCTGCAGTTGCC-3', and
pol3-r1 (reverse) 5'-CAGGTGGTGGTCAGTAGGG-3' for
polyserase-3. All PCRs were performed in a GeneAmp
2400 PCR system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 40 cycles
of denaturation (94°C, 20 s), annealing (63°C, 20 s), and
extension (68°C, 60 s). After cloning of the PCR-amplified products in pBlueScriptII (Invitrogen), their identities

were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing using the kit
DR terminator TaqFS and the automatic DNA sequencer
ABI-PRISM 310 (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences). Sequence
analysis of the RACE-extended cDNA clones led us to
complete the identification of the new polyserase. Finally,
the full-length cDNA was obtained by PCR using the
primers

5'-ATGAAGTGGTG
CTGGGGCCCA-3', ENDpol3 (reverse), 5'-TCAGCAGCTGGTTGGTTGGCT-3'. PCR conditions were as above, but
with 280 s of extension. Nucleotide and protein sequence
analysis were carried out using different programs available [35,40].
Northern-blot analysis
Nylon filters containing poly(A)+ RNAs of diverse human
tissues were prehybridized at 42°C for 3 h in 50% formamide, 5× SSPE, 10× Denhardt's solution, 2% SDS, and
100 µg/ml of denatured herring sperm DNA. Hybridization was performed with a radiolabeled 628 pb EcoRIBamHI fragment of polyserase-3. After hybridization for
20 h under the same conditions, filters were washed with
0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 2 h at 50°C, and exposed to autoradiography.
Construction of expression vectors and purification of
recombinant proteins
To analyze the expression of polyserase-3 in eukaryotic
cells, the full-length cDNA encoding this protein was
PCR-amplified and cloned between the HindIII and NotI
sites of a modified pCEP4 expression vector (Invitrogen),
which facilitated to add a HisTag tail at the C-terminus of
the recombinant protein. The oligonucleotides used to do
this were 5'-TTAAAGCTTATGAAGTGGTGCTGGGGCC-3'
(forward) and 5'-TGTGCGGCCGCGCAGCTGGTTGGTTGGCTA-3' (reverse) where the HindIII and NotI sites are
indicated in bold. A BssHII site was created in the coding
sequence (positions 809 to 814) which allowed us to
introduce a FLAG epitope between the two serine protease
domains, using the oligonucleotides 5'-CGCGCGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG-3' and 5'-CGCGCTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCTG-3'. The resulting vector,
pCEP-pol3, was transfected into HeLa and 293-EBNA cells
using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies,
Inc.). When indicated, tunicamycin was added to the cells
at a final concentration of 1 µg/mL. Expression of each
independent serine protease domain as well as the entire
protease in bacterial cells was carried out using the pGEX2TK vector (Amersham Biosciences). To this end, the first
serine protease domain was PCR-amplified from pCEPpol3
using
the
oligonucleotides
5'-GAGGGCAACACAGTCCCTGGCGAG-3' (forward) and 5'GTAGAGGCCCCAGAGACCCGA-3' (reverse), and cloned
into the SmaI site of the pGEX vector to generate pGEXpol3Spd1. Similarly, the second serine protease domain
was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides 5'-TCG-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/7/9

GGTCTCTGGGGCCTCTAC-3' (forward) and 5'-GTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTGC-3' (reverse) and cloned as above
to prepare the construct pGEX-pol3Spd2. To produce the
entire protease, a PCR-amplification was carried out with
the oligonucleotides 5'-GAGGGCAACACAGTCCCTGGCGAG-3' and 5'-GTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTGC-3'
and the PCR product was cloned as above to get pGEXpol3 vector. A pGEX plasmid expressing ADAM23 disintegrin domain was used as control to assess quality in the
further purification process of the fusion proteins, and as
negative control of the serine protease activity in the enzymatic assays [36]. Plasmids were transformed into
BL21(DE3) pLysE Escherichia coli cells and expression was
induced at 19°C using 0.4 mM of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG). After that, cells were collected, lysed and
centrifuged, and the soluble fractions containing the
recombinant proteins were purified as follows. A glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) was initially
used and the eluted proteins were subsequently loaded in
a gel filtration column (Superdex 200, Amersham Biosciences). The quality of the purification process was followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses, using an
anti-GST antibody (Amersham Biosciences). To evaluate
the possibility that polyserase-3 forms dimers, the fulllength cDNA was amplified using the oligonucleotides 5'GCAAGATCTAACACAGTCCCTGGCGA GTGG-3' (forward) and 5'-TGCAAGCTTTCAGCAGCTGGTTGGTTGGCTTAT-3' (reverse), where the BglII and HindIII sites
are indicated in bold. The PCR-product was digested with
these restriction enzymes and cloned between these positions in pRSETB, which add a 6xHisTag tail at the N-terminus of the protein. The resulting vector (pRSETB-pol3)
was transformed into BL21(DE3) pLysE. The production
of the recombinant protein was as above; whereas the
purification was carried out using a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen), and an anti 6xHisTag antibody (Qiagen) was used to
detect the produced protein.
Activity assays
The catalytic activity of the recombinant proteins was analyzed using a panel of different proteins as potential substrates including type I collagen, type I gelatin, type I
laminin, pro-uPA and fibrinogen. The assays were carried
out with 5 µg of each protein in a buffer containing 50
mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl, during 16 h at
37°C. The enzyme/substrate ratio (w/w) used in these
experiments was 1/100. The resulting material was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. For inhibition assays,
polyserase-3 was preincubated with AEBSF (0.1 mM),
EDTA (2 mM), and E-64 (10 µM) for 30 min at 37°C, and
then incubations were performed at the same conditions
as above.

Homology modeling
A three-dimensional model of each polyserase-3 serine
protease domains was calculated using Swiss-Model, a
semiautomated modeling server [47], and analyzed with
the Swiss-Pdb Viewer. The amino acid sequence of each
serine protease domain was compared with the sequences
of the protein structures deposited in the Protein Data
Bank. After analyzing structures of non-redundant proteins that had the highest structural quality and significant
sequence similarity with each polyserase-3 catalytic
domain, we chose the human β-tryptase (1a01),
matriptase-1 (1eaxa) and human plasmin (1bmla) as
templates. The templates were superimposed and aligned
structurally. The quality of the resulting models was verified manually with Swiss-Pdb Viewer. The figures were
rendered with POV-Ray [48].

Immunocytochemical analysis
After transfection, HeLa and 293-EBNA cells were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Then, cells were permeabilized for 5 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS.
Blocking was carried out with 15% fetal bovine serum in
the same buffer. Blocked slices were incubated for 2 h with
different dilutions of the primary anti-FLAG antibody, followed by 1 h incubation with a secondary fluoresceinconjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. Slides were coverslipped in the presence of Vectashield medium (Vector
Laboratories) containing 4'-6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole
hydrochloride (DAPI) and imaged by fluorescence microscopy.
