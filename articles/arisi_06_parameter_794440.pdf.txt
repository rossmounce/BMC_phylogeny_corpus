Abstract
Background: The "inverse" problem is related to the determination of unknown causes on the
bases of the observation of their effects. This is the opposite of the corresponding "direct" problem,
which relates to the prediction of the effects generated by a complete description of some agencies.
The solution of an inverse problem entails the construction of a mathematical model and takes the
moves from a number of experimental data. In this respect, inverse problems are often illconditioned as the amount of experimental conditions available are often insufficient to
unambiguously solve the mathematical model. Several approaches to solving inverse problems are
possible, both computational and experimental, some of which are mentioned in this article. In this
work, we will describe in details the attempt to solve an inverse problem which arose in the study
of an intracellular signaling pathway.
Results: Using the Genetic Algorithm to find the sub-optimal solution to the optimization
problem, we have estimated a set of unknown parameters describing a kinetic model of a signaling
pathway in the neuronal cell. The model is composed of mass action ordinary differential equations,
where the kinetic parameters describe protein-protein interactions, protein synthesis and
degradation. The algorithm has been implemented on a parallel platform. Several potential solutions
of the problem have been computed, each solution being a set of model parameters. A sub-set of
parameters has been selected on the basis on their small coefficient of variation across the
ensemble of solutions.
Conclusion: Despite the lack of sufficiently reliable and homogeneous experimental data, the
genetic algorithm approach has allowed to estimate the approximate value of a number of model
parameters in a kinetic model of a signaling pathway: these parameters have been assessed to be
relevant for the reproduction of the available experimental data.

Background
The "inverse" problem is related to the determination of
unknown causes on the bases of the observation of their
effects. This is the opposite of the corresponding "direct"
problem, which relates to the prediction of the effects gen-

erated by a complete description of some agencies. Typical
inverse problems in electrocardiology are related to the
modelling of the human heart functional structure from
surface electrocardiogram signals (ECG) [1]; similar situations are encountered in magnetoencephalography

(MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) [2,3]. In biology, a classical example of the "inverse" approach is the
reconstruction of the three-dimensional structure of macromolecules, using either x-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or prediction models [4-6].
Another typical biological application of inverse
approaches is the reconstruction of gene-regulatory networks [7,8].
The solution of an inverse problem entails the construction of a mathematical model and takes the moves from a
number of experimental data. In this respect, inverse
problems are often ill-conditioned as the amount of
experimental conditions available are often insufficient to
unambiguously solve the mathematical model. Moreover,
as model construction usually depends upon the minimization of specific functions, such as the system energy or
the difference between the model prediction and some
given experimental results, its solution does not necessarily lead to a single global optimal solution but to a set of
optimal solutions, defining what is called the "Pareto
optimal frontier" in the space of solutions [9]. Additional
experimental constraints or theoretical methods are thus
necessary to further select within the solutions set. Typical
inverse problems concerns essentially the detailed determination of biochemical mechanisms underlying
observed phenotypes, for example molecular abundances
or morphological modifications.
In this work, we will attempt to solve an inverse problem
which arose in the study of a signalling pathway. Compared to pathways of metabolic reactions, which are of a
limited size comprising up to a few hundreds of proteins,
signalling processes involve about 20% of the genome, i.e.
thousands of expressed proteins [10], most still unidentified and of unknown function. Protein signalling networks spread information throughout the cell and
mediate a number of fundamental processes [11-14]. The
growing availability of reliable genomic and proteomic
data, made it possible to build up protein interaction
maps (PIMs) of increasing complexity. New highthroughput experimental and in silico technologies allow
us to monitor protein-protein and genetic interactions:
DNA and protein microarrays [15-17], two-hybrid systems [18-20], protein tagging techniques coupled with
Mass Spectrometry [21,22], phage display [23,24]. In silico methods also allow us to describe protein-protein (pp hereafter) interactions or the function of yet unclassified
proteins: new p-p interactions might be found on the base
of genomic sequence [25,26], using data mining methodologies [27,28], or predicting the composition of protein
complexes [29]. In this respect it is worth mentioning a
simple though successful method to detect new proteinprotein interactions by a comparative genomic analysis of
phylogenetic profiles: this approach is based on the

assumption that interacting genes tend to co-evolve in different organisms [30,31]. Protein's function can be predicted not only by sequence homology, but also on the
basis of their relationships with other proteins whose role
is already experimentally assessed [32,33] or by orthology
[34]. In order to model the time evolution of a signalling
pathway it is necessary to know:
• The species involved in molecular interactions, including chemical reactions
• How the interactions connect the chemical actors and
form a signalling network
• How these interactions can be modelled
• The model parameters necessary to computationally
simulate the time behaviour of the system.
The mathematical form of the chemical interactions, the
model parameters and even the network topology are
often only partially known. This implies that model
approximations and numerical estimates and, whenever
possible, additional specific experimental measurements,
are necessary to make a numerical simulation feasible and
reliable. This is true whatever modelling techniques is
used, such as differential equations [35,36], cellular
automata [37], Petri Nets [38] or other hybrid methods
[39]. When creating a new model, before starting with
numerical procedures, it is necessary to make a survey on
all published kinetic data. These data may be found
directly in the journal articles, which requires a thorough
mining of the literature, or on in annotated databases, collecting and structuring information on p-p interactions.
Only at the end of this phase, further experimental activity
and the techniques for parameter's estimate come into
play: wherever possible, purposely designed experiments
should be carried out in order to directly measure
unknown kinetic parameters or to use these measures as
constraints for the estimate's algorithm or to decide
between alternative models. If new experiments cannot be
done, the parameter estimate must rely just on literature
data.

Databases of protein interactions
Protein interactions maps, partially stored in public databases, contain mainly qualitative information on the connectivity of intracellular p-p interactions, while
quantitative data on the kinetics of interactions and reactions are still largely unavailable, except for enzyme kinetics. There are to date a number of public databases sites
containing qualitative data on protein interaction maps:

• iHOP: genetic and protein interactions are extracted by
text mining of literature abstract [40,28]

tainty of kinetic data [57,58] and by using approximations where some values are missing [39].

• Amaze: it is built upon a complex object-oriented data
model that allows it to represent and analyze molecular
interactions and cellular processes, kinetic data can potentially be inserted into the data structure [41,42]

This point, however, is already a major concern of the Systems Biology: several programs are being performed
aimed at producing sets of validated data, homogeneously refered at specific organisms in well defined and
standardized thermo-chemical conditions. The standardization of experimental data sets and of experimental
models is the object of an intense debate in the Systems
Biology community. There is a wide consensus on the
need of standards but also on some drawbacks for a general use of standards as the best research framework in any
case. Anyway the way towards a deeper and deeper though
slow integration of existing datasets, modelling languages
and methodologies appears to be set, as witnessed for
example by the wider and wider use of SBML as a language
to describe biochemical models, or by the integration of
previously separated datasets into a single larger database
compliant with new criteria established by international
consortia. One example of the latter case is the HUPO –
PSI initiative [59], aimed at establishing a common format to represent protein-protein interactions and to synchronize all the already existing databases, as it happened
for the genome data: MINT, DIP, BIND and IntAct (see
below) already implemented the PSI standard to publish
molecular interactions.

• IntAct: this offers a database and analysis tools for protein interactions [43,44]
• Kegg: it is a large database that contains also several signalling pathways [45,46]
• DIP: it contains interactions from over 100 organisms
[47,48]
• IMEx: it is a consortium of major public providers of
molecular interaction data, current members are DIP,
IntAct, MINT, MPact, BioGRID, BIND [49]
• Reactome: this is a curated database of biological pathways in human beings [50,51]
It should be remarked that a great care has to be payed
when dealing with qualitative data: they are often dependent on specific experimental conditions and most of them
obtained in unicellular organisms. A straightforward
extrapolation of these data to higher organisms is often
quite unreliable [52]. Moreover, p-p interactions data in
molecular networks are usually obtained from large scale
or high-throughput experiments, where spurious interactions are very likely to be collected; computational validation techniques are thus needed to prune primary datasets
[53,54]. The same holds when one tries to translate
genetic interactions into the corresponding p-p interactions: the two networks have quite different topological
properties [55].
The situation is even worse when one analyzes quantitative p-p interactions data in public repositories: the total
amount of experimentally-derived kinetic data is only a
small percentage of what would be needed to characterize
the topology data (i.e. the p-p interactions map). Furthermore, available kinetic constants are often extracted from
a single publication where they were measured in vitro,
while the kinetics of interactions is highly dependent on
experimental set-up and environmental conditions, such
as PH, temperature, concentration of other proteins in the
cellular environment. It is always advisable to assume that
the measured quantities indicate more realistically ranges
rather than precise values and care must be used to insert
these values into large-scale network models [56]. Nevertheless some investigation of biochemical reactions can
anyway be carried out by taking into account the uncer-

p-p interactions in signalling pathways can be divided
into two main categories: (a) binding interactions that
involve no chemical modifications and (2) biochemical
processing, such as phosphorylation and phosphatization. On one hand, the few public sources of kinetic data
on binding protein interaction often provide only dissociation constants, i.e. values describing an equilibrium state
that offer only partial information about the dynamics of
the reaction. To our knowledge, only the KDBI database
[60,61] was specifically created to store binding and dissociation rate constants. Other repositories, such as MINT
[62,63] and BIND [64,65] offer few examples of dissociation constants. On the other hand, biochemical modifications occur in enzymatic reactions, therefore kinetic data
can be found in databases entirely devoted to enzymes,
first of all Brenda [66,67] where kinetic constants are specified for several organic substrates, and partially the above
cited KDBI.
A further source of signalling pathways and of p-p interactions data, including the kinetic part, are the repositories
of biochemical models, though in these models not all the
kinetic parameters were measured experimentally and
some of them had to be numerically estimated. Among
them:

• Biomodels.Net: it has been published very recently and
it is currently the most curated database of biochemical
models, offering tested and verified models in several
standard formats included, SBML, CellML and XML
[68,69]. A standard for model annotation and curation of
biological models called MIRIAM has been recently proposed [70];
• JWS Online: another curated repository of models in
SBML and PySces formats [71,72]. JWS creators are among
the main contributors to the new Biomodels.Net databases and to the MIRIAM initiative;
• CellML: repository of biochemicals models in CellML
format [73,74]. The CellML team contributes to the
MIRIAM project;
• DOQCS: this is a large repository of signalling pathways, where all the reactions and kinetic parameters are
directly shown, furthermore the models can be downloaded in the Genesis language [75,76]. Also DOQCS
curators contributed to the MIRIAM project;
• ModelDB: this is a repository of detailed biochemical
and electrphysiological processes in the neuronal cell: the
models are written in the Genesis language and Neuron
languages [77,78].

Experimental measures of kinetic parameters
The measure of protein activation level is of paramount
importance to monitor signalling processes. Several methods exist to quantitate the concentration of protein species, such as immunoblotting, ELISA, radioimmunoassay,
protein arrays. If a cellular system is sampled several times
over the duration of a given signalling process, a time
series can be composed describing the time course of a
concentration, for example that of a phosphorilated protein. Radioimmunoassays are very sensitive methods but
are even complex, expensive and dangerous to set up; protein arrays offer the advantage of a high throughput
approach, while ELISA and immunoblotting are easier to
implement and, thus, widely used, though they allow a
lower threshold of detection when a very low concentrations of radioactive compounds is present [79]. The experimental error of quantitative immunoblotting can be
significantly reduced by computational techniques of data
analysis, error estimate and simulation: these allow to
monitor activated signalling pathways in real time and to
discriminate between different models.
Enzymatic reactions can be monitored, nowadays, in a
high throughput scale both in vivo and in vitro: this
allows us to measure kinetic parameters characterizing
fundamental steps in signalling pathways, such as binding
and removal of phosphate groups by kinases and phos-

phatases. Bioreactors are widely used to perform enzymatic reactions and other biochemical processes but their
use for a real time monitoring of products is limited by the
sampling process. More recent modified reactors allow a
real-time sampling of multiple reactions in vivo over a
short reaction time: the reaction broth flows at constant
velocity along a thin pipe where spilling at uniform space
intervals corresponds to uniform time sampling. In this
system the samples can be rapidly quenched and analyzed
by mass-spectrometry techniques [80]. Also arrays of
nanolitre wells can be used to follow the time course of
multiple enzymatic process by the use of optical techniques such as fluorescence and bioluminescence [81].
The analysis of reaction mixtures by mass spectrometry
methods makes the use of chromophores and radiolabelling unnecessary, since even the addition of a phosphate
group to a large protein can be detected as a precise mass
shift in the spectra. In vitro multiplexed assays can be performed on protein chips that are then directly analyzed by
surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-offlight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) to monitor
enzyme activities [82]. Alternatively complex protein mixtures can be immobilized on micro-beads, where the
enzymatic reactions can take place and be monitored by
MALDI mass spectrometry [83]. A more difficult issue is to
measure kinetic parameters describing binding of proteins
without chemical processing, such as ligand-receptor
interactions or the formation of protein complexes. Two
techniques allow us to calculate kinetic rate constants of
binding an unbinding by fitting measured response
curves. The Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) allows us to
measure kinetic constants in vitro in a label-free environment. One of the reactants is immobilized on the sensor
surface usually coated with a thin gold film, while the
other is free in solution: the behaviour of a polarized light
beam hitting the surface in conditions of total internal
reflection depends on the refractive index of the surface,
that in turn depends on the binding state of the reactants.
In essence the SPR measures the angle or the wavelength
of the reflected light at which a resonance takes place
between the light and the metal electrons: whose changes
correspond to the amount of bound molecules. The SPR
is already used for high-throughput measurements
directly on protein arrays [84-86]. Using a completely different approach called fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCS) the kinetics of binding can be quantified
directly in living cells. Fluctuations of fluorescence signals
can be detected in a very reduced volume, less than a femtolitre, and using a very low fluorophore concentration,
up to 5 nM i.e. around 3 molecules/femtolitre, by the use
of a tightly focused laser beam. The investigation of the
autocorrelation function of the fluorescence signal provides information about the reaction kinetics, the diffusion rates and the equilibrium state. With FCS it is feasible

to study at a single molecule level a ligand-receptor interaction with no need of any isotope labeling [87,88].

"In silico" parameter's estimate
When only a few kinetic parameters are available to
implement a model of a signaling network, one might
resort to attempting a "theoretical" estimate of these values. The attempt could be performed, in principle, by
using an "inverse problem" approach, i.e. by optimizing
the unknown parameters of a reaction's model in order to
obtain the best possible agreement between simulated
and experimental data.
This is the aim of the present work. We devise a methodological workflow (and the corresponding numerical and
computational tools) to estimate the unknown reaction
constants of a model signalling pathway by starting from
(a) a given set of known data of reaction constants and (b)
experimental results of the time course of some biochemical species involved in the reaction.
An intracellular signal transduction pathway in the neuronal cell was used as a model system to implement the proposed parameter's estimate procedure.
The chosen pathway is a protein network downstream of
the neurotrophic receptors Trk and P75 [89], the Fas
receptor regulating an apoptotic cascade [35], the EGF
receptor expressed in the CNS [90,91] and in PC12 cells
[92,93]. The network structure is based on current literature. The pathway can be divided into two main interconnected sub-systems: an apoptosis pathway and a
neurotrophic receptors activated pathway. Neuronal
apoptosis can be initiated in three different manners, all
leading to the activation of executioner caspases, the effectors of the apoptotic process that kill the cell by irreversible proteolysis of critical cellular constituents: survival
factor withdrawal, stress factors and receptor mediated
signaling cascade [94,35,95]. In this model the survival
factor withdrawal is taken into account by the connections between the two sub-networks, the apoptotic and
the neurotrophic driven one, which includes the TRK,
EGFR and P75NTR receptors the stress factors are also
considered by the presence of a mitochondrion acting as
a synthesis machinery for pro-apoptotic proteins (Fig. 1).
The signaling pathways forming the network can be activated in several ways; in our model, we chose to trigger the
signalling process by the activation of the receptors
upstream of the pathways as a consequence of the binding
of specific ligands.
The p-p interactions, such as molecular binding, phosphorylation/dephospshorylation or chemical transformations, are described using first order non-linear ordinary
differential equations, which take into account also syn-

thesis and degradation processes. The space variable is
neglected in this model, since proteins are considered to
be close enough to justify the approximation of a geometrical point. The release from the mitochondria was considered to be mathematically equivalent to an additional
protein synthesis [94,35]. In this model gene transcription was neglected, owing to the time scale chosen to simulate the temporal evolution of the system, within 60
minutes time. Reactions are treated as a one-step process.
For binary activation and inactivation reactions, the following second order kinetics scheme was used, where protein A activates protein B:

K

(1)

act
A + B ⎯⎯⎯ A + B *
→

The activation rate of protein B is : vact = Kact [A][B]. In the
case of binding reactions, resulting in the association/dissociation of protein complexes, the following one-step
reaction scheme was used, resulting in a pth-order kinetics,
where p equals the number of components of the protein
complex Ci, with forward and reverse rate constants K and
K-1 respectively:

C1 + C2 + … + Cn

K ,K −1

(2)

P

Thus the association rate is vass = K [C1] [C2]...[Cn] and the
dissociation rate is vdiss = K-1[P].
Each of the N = 98 nodes of the network is described by
the two independent variables Pi and xi (i = l...N): the first
refers to the total concentration of the protein species, the
second to the concentration of the active fraction of that
species. Each protein species i will thus follow a time evolution given by two coupled reactions:

dxi (t )
= ∑ vprod,xi + ∑ vcons,xi
dt

( 3)

dPi (t )
= ∑ vprod,Pi + ∑ vcons,Pi
dt

(4)

where vprod, a(vcons,a), with a = xi, Pi, represent production
(consumption) reactions having the a-species as object.

Scheme 1 a model signaling network
Scheme of a model signaling network. Scheme of the signaling network used to demonstrate the validity of the parameter
estimate method. The network consists of a series of proteins (the nodes) linked by different types of unary, binary or multiple
molecular interactions (shown as the edges of the network). The role of the mitochondrion (in purple) is taken into account.
Binding protein-protein interactions are shown by green edges between the nodes, activation and deactivation interactions are
in blue and red, respectively, chemical transformations are shown by purple dotted lines, while the release of proteins from the
mitochondria in shown in solid purple lines. The signaling process can be activated by the binding of ligands (in grey) to receptors. Every compound is identified by a name and a numerical code.
N in the number of nodes, NPi,j is the number of different
interactions involving the nodes i and j, NCi,j,r is the
number of components when i is a protein in complex
...
with protein j and the K i , j represent the different rate

constants. The r index accounts for different interactions
between nodes i and j, when existing. The zero-th order
terms Ω0 and Φ0 include the protein synthesis and the
i
i
release from the mitochondria processes, the linear terms
include the protein degradation, chemical autoprocessing
and protein complex dissociation; the quadratic terms
take into account the activation and de-activation of protein Pi, the polinomial terms describe the protein associa-

tion into larger complexes. No mass conservation
constraint has been imposed to the system.
In our approximation we considered both the topology of
the protein interaction map and the kinetic parameters as
constant in time, i.e. each protein keeps the same neighbours during the time evolution of the system and interacts with them with constant strength. We decided to
completely assign the connectivity matrix of the network
on the basis of the existing experimental data. On the
other hand, the kinetic parameters were largely unknown
on the basis on the same information sources: as a consequence, in this application, the object of the "inverse
problem" are the unknown model's constants. The

"inverse problem" has been implemented with the following scheme:

better and better approximation of the optimal problem's
solution.

1. eqs.(5–6) are solved and the time course of variables Pi
and xi (i = l...N) are calculated for a given set of model's
parameters

The " inverse problem" we have attempted to solve starts
from the description of a signalling network in terms of
biochemical interacting species and reaction's constants.
After a mining procedure to discover the value of the
known reaction's constants, the system of eqs. (5–6) can
be solved, by setting, for the unknown reaction's constants, an initial gauge of values. The solution of eqs.(5–
6), in terms of functions describing the predicted time
course of each of the system's variables (i.e. the concentration of all the biochemical species of the network), is thus
strictly related to the intial set of reaction's constants. If
one defines, as individual of the GA, the complete set of
reaction's constants (the l known constants and the N - l
unknown constants), its ability to produce an optimal
solution to the problem can be measured by evaluating
the " distance" between the predicted time-course (fpred) of
some variables and that effectively measured by an experimental test of the same variables on that network (fexp).
Formally, a distance between the two functions representing the j-th variable can be defined as follows:

2. the predicted time course of certain quantities is compared with the corresponding experimental data and a
specific "distance" between time-courses evaluated
3. procedure is iterated up to minimizing that distance
Although, at least in principle, the strategy is simple, in
practice the space of parameters to be estimated is very
large, thus the strategy of points (1–3) above must rely on
the availability of an efficient optimization algorithm. We
have resorted to choose Genetic Algorithms (GA) for a
number of reasons which will be highlighted in the following section.

GA: generality, numerical and computational
implementation
The genetic algorithm (GA) is a programming technique
that mimics biological evolution as a problem-solving
strategy. Given a specific problem, the input to the GA is
a set (called a "population") of potential solutions (called
"individuals") to that problem. Each individual contains
a "genome" able to provide a sub-obtimal solution to the
problem. This ability could be quantified if a specific fitness function is defined, able to quantify how much an
individual, by means of its genome, is fit for the solution
of the optimization problem (i.e. to measure the "distance" between the sub-optimal and the optimal solution). The purpose of the GA is to produce successive
population of individuals which are generated with the
aim of increasing, as much as possible, the fitness of their
individuals, i.e. their ability to solve the optimization
problem by decreasing that "distance". This is done by
producing successive populations of individuals by using
the same procedures of the natural selection: mating and
mutation. In the GA workflow, given an initial population
of individuals, these are evaluated and classified according to their fitness. A selection rule is then defined to
allow mating of couples of individuals, that mix their
genomes, to form new ones (a further population) and an
appropriate frequency of mutation of the genomes is
defined, to introduce "new tracts" into individuals
(which, in turn, would have been composed only by tracts
coming from previous populations). If selection rules for
mating and frequency of mutation are appropriatly chosen, the GA produces successive sets of individuals (" generations") which are progressively more and more fit to
the optimization problem. In other words, individuals are

t

dj = ∑ fj
i =1

( pred)

(exp)

(i) − f j

(7)

where t is the (discrete) time length of the trajectories
spanned by the variables. If one has k experimentally
measured variables, the overall distance between that
solution and the "optimal" solution would be
k

d = ∑ di
i =1

(8)

Eq.(8) can be thus retained as the "fitness" function of the
considered individual; one can thus measure its "distance" from the "optimal" solution. Indeed, a more general formulation of the fitness function could be given by
attributing "empirical" weight factors α to each variable,
as to produce a different impact on the overall d value
k

d = ∑ α i di
i =1

( 9)

The aim of the GA is to produce solutions which progressively reduce the value of the distance of its individuals.
The scheme of producing successive "generations" of individuals can be resumed as follows:
1. start with a set of initial N individuals {Ki, i = 1, n}, each
consisting of the same l known constants and by a
number n - l of randomly selected guesses of the unknown
constants (Fig. 2). Each value of Ki is a real number in the
interval [10-5,100]. The interval was chosen on the basis of

Genetic algoritm scheme. Flow chart of the estimate procedure using the genetic algorithm (GA). Every unknown model
parameter is called a " gene", while the whole set of parameters to be estimated is defined as the " genome". Every genome is
contained within an " individual", the computational entity able to " evolve". An ensemble of genomes corresponds to a "population". The GA procedure begins with an initial random guess of the parameters values used to run a simulation of the model
network. This first step is iterated for all the individuals belonging to different populations. For each individual, the simulated
time course of the concentrations for specific proteins are compared with the experimental measures and the distances
between the functions are calculated. Every individual is thus related to a fitness index, measuring the degree of compatibility of
the genome with the experimental constraints. A small number of individuals are selected based on their fitness but also on
probabilistic rules: they will have the genomes randomly mutated by genetic operators, giving birth to a new offspring that
enters the next generation. At each round the plot describing the evolution of the best fitness computed until then is updated:
when it clearly saturates the algorithm stops and the genome corresponding to that fitness is the solution of the algorithm.

The parameter estimate does not include the topology of
the network, that is the connectivity matrix is considered
as a constant of the system and no interaction parameter
is allowed to go to zero during the optimization procedure. The experimental data used as model constraints to
optimize the system are the experimental time course of
the concentrations of the active fraction of ERK-1, c-Raf,
MEK, PKC-iota proteins [96-98]. These data were
obtained measuring the phosphorylation level of these
proteins by optical methods, following delivery of NGF to
the cell. They are used to calculate the Fitness Function,
upon which the GA is based. The optical signal were sampled every 2 minutes for 1 hour, that is a total of 30 sampling points for each protein were used to fit the system.
The whole set of model parameters includes 278
indipendent values, of which 15 were extracted from the
literature and the other were fitted using the GA.
The algorithm starts assigning every individual with random genome. The initial genes gi were randomly generated in the following manner: gi= 10α where α comes from
a flat (white noise) distribution in the range α ∈ [-5, 0].
This guarantees that the distribution of the initial parameters is flat in the logarithmic scale. The range is expanded
in proportion to the number of components NC where
the node (i) is a protein complex and if NC > 2: the range
becomes α ∈ [-5 * (NC - 2), 0].
The Fitness Function F() is here defined, for each individual, as the inverse of the squared Euclidean distance
between the experimental time course of the concentration of the activated fraction of ERK-1, c-Raf, MEK, PKCiota proteins (see above) and the simulated time course
for the same species, obtained using the genome
{K1,...,Kn} of the individual (Fig. 2, step 2) as parameters
set; this distance is evaluated across the whole time interval (60 minutes), with a sampling time of 2 minutes:

where 10-4 <T < 1 is a constant parameter, used to shape
the distribution of the probabilities. It is worth underlining here that the best individuals tend to be selected at
each generation, but the probability distribution gives any
individual at least a small chance of being selected. The
best individuals, then recombine their genes by the crossover (Fig. 2, step 4), exchanging randomly selected but
corresponding segments of the genomes, and eventually
the offspring form the next generation (Fig. 2, step 5). The
genes of the offspring are also allowed to randomly
mutate with a low probability 0.005 <Pmut < 0.04. The
individuals are distributed among NSp sub-populations,
each containing NI of individuals, in our case NI = 16 and
7 < NSp < 33. The evolution process takes place independently within each sub-population at each generation.
Every NM generations, with NM of the order of the subpopulation size, MI of the best individuals in each population, again selected according to a probabilistic rule,
move into a different sub-population, there replacing others that on their turn entered another sub-population: MI
is of the order of 10%-30% of NI. This "migration" operator allows a sub-population to partially renew its genetic
pool and tends to fasten the evolution process. The algorithm keeps in memory the "optimal" genome and the
corresponding fitness, that is the best individual out of all
the sub-populations obtained until that stage in the evolution process: these are compared with the best genome
and corresponding fitness in the current generation: if the
new fitness is better the optimal genome is replaced by the
new one. The plot of the optimal fitness versus the generation number describes a monotone non-increasing function: when the curve derivative saturates, the procedure
comes to an end and the individual corresponding to the
optimal fitness provides the solution genome.

The GA in intrinsically parallel, thus the necessary computation can be very efficiently distributed over several
CPUs. The GA was implemented on a cluster of Alpha
CPUs, using the Fortran 90 language and the MPI protocol, under Linux operating system. In this implementation each computational node stores the genomes of a
single sub-population, which evolves independently,
except when there is a migration of individuals. In that
case genome vectors are exchanged between the nodes
(Fig. 2, step 4). In order to optimize the distribution of the
computational load, data communications were reduced,
which was exactly compatible with rarely occurring
genome migrations.

Results and Discussion
Results
The system under investigation does not guarantee that
the inverse problem has one unique solution, using the
chosen experimental constraints. Therefore we must
assume that the GA will find not one single solution but
one ensemble of solutions, formed by many sets of model
parameters {K1,...,Kn}. The ensemble describes a small
sub-space within the entire space of parameters. We
decided to sample this sub-space to study the properties of
the solutions. The first step in this work was to obtain several numerical estimates of the set of unknown kinetic
parameters. The second step was the analysis of the properties of a single solution, then the analysis of the collective properties of the ensemble. Eventually one solution
was used as the best estimate of the kinetic parameters, to
compare the simulated behaviour of the network with
independent experimental data, to assess the reliability of
the method. The genetic algorithm was started using each
time different random genomes.

The time evolution of the fitness belonging to the optimal
individual is a non-increasing function, with an envelope
following a decreasing exponential like shape (Fig. 3)
When the time derivative approaches zero, the algorithm
ends and the current optimal individual is considered to
be the estimated solution of the problem. The time of
computation necessary to reach a good level of approximation decreases with the number of used CPUs, as it is
shown in Fig. 3. This is reasonable since the larger the
number of computational nodes in the parallel implementation, the larger the whole population and the probability of selecting a fit individual within a smaller
amount of generations. The calculation of the fitness
index includes different terms and does not describe in
details how similar the simulated and experimental
behaviour become as the genetic algorithm proceeds in
increasing the fitness of the best individual. Therefore at
the end of the algorithmic computation, for each solution
the time evolution of the concentration for the proteins
chosen as experimental constraints were visually compared to the corresponding simulated behaviour, as

the saturation decreases as the number of CPUs increases.

shown in the example of Fig. 4, in order to discard meaningless solutions.
Though the experimental and simulated data may appear
different, nevertheless, the essential dynamical features,
some transients and the following relaxation of the system, are approximately described by the simulation. Since
no further significant improvements of the best parameter
sets could be obtained using the genetic algorithm, we can
attribute the differences to the incomplete connectiveness
of the model network, which make some protein concentrations unable to be sufficiently modulated by the activity of the rest of the network. This does not imply that this
algorithm proves to be unfit for estimating important
properties of the unknown parameters of the model. We
obtained a total of 36 solutions of the inverse problem,
each of them requiring few days of computation to be calculated.
The initial random parameter sets were completely altered
by the genetic operators, both by the cross-over and the
random mutation, which affected at least once every element of the genomes, therefore the final outcome of the
algorithm, the optimal genome, has lost every numerical
similarity with the initial parameter sets. These two points
together could have two kind of consequences: either all
the the reactions are necessary for a correct dynamics of
the network, or only few reactions dominate the dynamics
and guarantee that the chosen experimental constraints
are satisfied, while the other rate constants may just fluctuate almost randomly. Further analysis, later in this article, will show that the second hypothesis is probably the
correct one. Some more hints come from the calculation
of the proximity matrix of the logarithm of solution vectors, whose elements are the non-squared Euclidean distances between all the couples of solutions genomes. We
have plotted the frequency distribution of the elements
(Fig. 5) and compared it to a the distribution of a large
ensemble of random vectors, generated using the same
criteria and value ranges as the initial genomes in first step
of the genetic algorithm.
The asymmetrical bell shape is typical of the distributions
of the distances between all the geometrical points contained in a generic hypercube, here described by the
parameter ranges in the n-dimensional space, where n =
number of unknown parameters: for instance the same
distribution pattern holds even in two dimensions. The
two distributions have very similar shapes, though the
solutions are slightly shifted towards shorter distances, a
feature that is not surprising since the solutions belong to
a smaller sub-space of the cited n-dimensional hypercube,
thus the corresponding points in the parameter space are
closer one to the other. The fact that the distribution of
solutions is shifted of a small value, about 20% of the bell

width, suggests that probably only few parameters contribute to this shift while the others are essentially randomly distributed. After analyzing the solutions
parameter sets as static entities, separated from the network dynamics they describe, they must eventually be
characterized on the basis of such dynamics. To make
again a genetic comparison, it is not sufficient to analyze
the "genotypes", the solutions, but rather the corresponding "phenotypes", the time course of protein concentrations. Each of solution parameter sets can be used to
simulate the signal transduction process in the network,
since it is considered to be a "realistic" set of kinetic
parameters. The dynamics described by each of the solutions is slightly different, though, in any case, the time
course of protein concentrations meets the experimental
constraints used for the genetic algorithm. This similarity
can be explained by a closer investigation of the detailed
structure of such ensemble, to understand what explains
the similarities and, at the same time, the differences
among the simulated dynamics obtained with the different estimated solutions. We computed the ratio, in the
logarithmic scale, between the standard deviation and
mean for each parameter Ki belonging to the genome,
with i = l...N, and across the whole ensemble of computed
solutions {Solutions}, that is the vector of coefficients of
variation:

where N is the number of parameters. The 17 parameters
showing a ratio smaller than 0.3 were considered as conserved elements across the ensemble of solutions. This
threshold was chosen on the basis of the distribution of
the coefficient of variation of a variable X, where X is sampled from a uniform distribution in the interval [-5,0].
The distribution of the coefficient of variation can be
approximated by a Gaussian density function N(μ, σ)
with μ = 2/ 12 and σ = 0.07: the μ value is the coefficient
of variation of the uniform distribution, while σ is the
standard deviation of a random set of coefficients of variation obtained by sampling the uniform distribution in
the interval [-5,0] (Fig. 6). A coefficient of variation
smaller than 0.33 has a probability of random occurrence
≤ 0.0002, while the 17 parameters selected using the
genetic algorithm represent 6.5% of the whole (Fig. 7),
that is a coefficient of variation smaller the 0.33 have a
proability of occurrence of 0.065 in the solution set, therefore statistically significant.

The parameters highlighted in fig. 7 correspond to reactions belonging both to he neurotrophic signal transduction pathway and to the apoptosis pathway: the Caspase8 and Caspase-9, final mediators of the apoptotic process,
are involved in this subgroup of reactions, as well as the
PKC protein, one of the " bridges" in this model between
the two main pathways of the network, other reactions
belong to the NGF-TRK signal transduction process. This
group of reactions spans all the typologies included in the
model: protein-protein activation/inactivation, protein
binding, binary chemical transformations, unary synthesis and degradation rates. The conserved parameter values
appear as key elements to guarantee that the experimental
data used for the genetic algorithm estimate procedure are
met. Furthermore this implies that the same parameters

are required for a correct signal transduction, leading to a
simulated outcome in agreement to the experimental one.
We have also investigated the level of complexity of the
network dynamics through the evaluation of the eigenvalue spectrum and the eigenvectors of the Jacobian
matrix of the system of eqs.(5–6). The Jacobian was evalued at a fixed time point (corresponding to t = 60 mins)
of a time simulation perfomed by using one parameter set
obtained by the GA procedure. The eigenvalue spectrum
spans 24 orders of magnitude, from 10-22 to 102, with
about 75% of them being real negative values and 25%
real positive ones: this implies that the majority of kinetic
modes (eigenvectors) in the diagonalized system lead to
an exponential decay, though with a large spectrum of

obtained by sampling the uniform distribution in the interval [-5,0] (Fig. 7). A coefficient of variation smaller than 0.33 has a

eigenvectors along the original set of 2N coordinates xi, Pi
describe how the nodes of the networks are involved in
the corresponding kinetic modes. In this respect 20 eigenvectors have significant components (larger than 0.1) just
along one of the coordinate, therefore the corresponding
dynamics involves essentially only one node of the network, while other 57 eigenvectors have significant compo-

nents only along two coordinates corresponding to two
distinct nodes. On the other hand more than 50% of the
eigenvectors have significant components along 3 or more
coordinates, up to 12: they thus correspond to more complex modes that involve a large number of network proteins. Moreover many eigenvectors project on the same
coordinates, which means that many proteins are inolved
in different kinetic modes. In conclusion we can say that

a group of small subnetworks exists, composed by one or
two nodes, that show a very simple increasing or decreasing dynamics, but this group cannot describe in an
exhaustive way the system dynamics: only a complex relation between several kinetic modes can account for the
simulated bahaviour.
Discussion
Different methods for parameter estimate and fitting
GA has proven to be a powerful and successful problemsolving strategy. It has been used, in fact, to solve NP-complete optimization problems in a wide variety of fields
such as chemistry, biology, engineering, astrophysics, aerospace, electronics, mechanical and electrical design, military plans, mathematics, robotics and many others.
Notable examples of GAs applications in molecular biology are in modelling of genetic and regulatory networks
[99,7,100], predicting protein structure and evolution

[101,102], classification of odorant molecules [103],
investigation of the metabolome [104]. We have chosen
to estimate the unknown parameters of our signalling network model by minimizing the difference between the
simulated output of the model and the corresponding
experimental observations. The function to minimize is a
vector distance between experimental and simulated concentrations sampled along a time interval; the distance
depends on the whole set of model parameters. A number
of other numerical methods exist to minimize such multivariate functions: downhill simplex, direction set, conjugate gradient, variable metric, linear programming,
simulated annealing (SA) [105,106]. These methods have
the common feature of progressively modifying the same
function, until a minimum is reached. In particular, the
SA is a Monte Carlo non evolutionary strategy based on a
thermalization-equivalent process of the system, in fact it
is commonly used in computational physics to find

minima of the energy states. At the heart of the method is
an analogy with the slow cooling of liquids, a process
called "annealing". A slow exploration of the energy landscape ensures that the absolute minimum is reached, if it
is unique. From another point of view, the SA could also
be consider a form of GA where a single individual evolves
alone by means of random mutations, without any crossover as no other individual is available. The SA and
another problem-solving technique called the hill-climbing show some similarities to GAs: in both algorithms one
single solution is evolving, instead of a population of candidate solutions. These algorithms start with one single
random solution: at each round the candidate solution
can mutate and its fitness is evaluated: if it is better than
the previous one it is kept and passed to the next round,
otherwise it is discarded and the previous one is mutated
again. In the SA discarding a solution is based also on a
specific parameter called the temperature, that gives even
unfit solutions a non-zero probability of passing to the
next round. In a preliminary phase of our work we compared the computational performances of the GA with the
SA to solve the same problem of parameter estimate in the
protein network. The SA was implemented in the classical
version and run on a single CPU: for the specific inverse
problem described in this work, the performances on the
GA were better than the SA even on a single computational node, since functional minima were found faster.
The existence of multiple solutions did not require explicitly the use of the SA. The GA is inherently parallelizable
because of the existence of many populations, each attributable to a different CPU in a multi-processor architecture
using the MPI protocol. The heaviest computational task
of the GA is by far the evaluation of the Fitness Function,
since the dynamics of the network must be simulated for
each individual at every generation, while the application
of the genetic operators is rather instantaneous, therefore
a good solution is to distribute the computation over
many CPUs running in parallel. To exploit in the best possible way the computing power, the computational load
should be equally distributed among the nodes: this was
obtained by assigning to the CPUs populations with uniform size. Furthermore it is recommended to minimize
the communications among the nodes, as a consistent
data transfer can considerably slow down the performance of the machine: here the data exchange is restricted
almost exclusively to the exchange of genomes during the
migration, which represents an absolutely negligible
amount of transferred data. Thus the nodes act as almost
independent entities and the performances of the GA
scale approximately inversely with the number of nodes,
that is the algorithm requires O(l/Cn) generations to find
the solution, where Cn is the number of computational
nodes.

Comparison of simulations with experimental data and multiple
solutions of the inverse problem
We believe anyway that the major limitation of this model
is not the degree of approximation used to describe protein-protein interactions but that some other biologically
relevant features are missing, such as the connections with
the gene transcription network and with other signalling
pathways and the role of the space diffusion, which may
be the subject of future improvement of the model. These
reasons should explain why this network is more a test
case for the implementation of the GA in the inverse problems domain than an accurate description of the neurotrophic and apoptotic signal transduction processes. It is
likely that other independent experimental data would
allow us to have an unambiguous selection among the
different solutions of the Pareto set, in two different manners: either these data could be added as additional constraints from the beginning of the GA procedure, to
consistently reduce the Pareto set since the beginning, or
they could play the role of independent criteria to select
one single or at least a subset of proper solutions obtained
by the GA procedure as presented in this work. The modelled signaling network must also be able to respond to a
variety of external stimuli, coming from the rest of the cellular environment, as a consequence of this the diversity
displayed by these behaviours is compatible with the
existence of this ability. The lack of functional connections to other signalling pathways does not allow the network to directly display these potential modalities of
response. A related point is the robustness of the system.
The optimal solutions belonging to the Pareto set correspond to different dynamical evolutions, though all meet
the experimental conditions: this suggests that the network shows some robustness since it is able to guarantee
the same signal transduction in many different conditions, with very different combinations of protein-protein
interactions strength. The robustness is a fundamental
property of biological systems, essential for survival when
it is necessary to face dangerous situations and sudden
changes in the cellular environment.
Conserved kinetic parameters
At the end of this work we found out that a sub-vector of
the kinetic parameters is characterized by a small coefficient of variation

StdDev{log10 K is , s ∈ Solutions}

, i = 1...N
( 15 )
Mean{log10 K is , s ∈ Solutions}
across the Pareto set of optimal solutions, where Kj is a
model parameter value describing the ithinteraction/reaction. This is an important and informative result since
those parameters correspond to protein-protein interactions and synthesis/degradation processes essential to
make the model correctly describe the experimental data

used as constraints for the parameter estimate procedure.
This sub-vector includes protein-protein interactions and
single protein reactions that could explain the robustness
of the network dynamics, across the whole Pareto set. The
sub-vector can be considered as composed by values
almost unambiguously estimated, within a reasonable
error, compared to the rest of the parameters. The existence of this sub-vector supports the idea that a sufficient
amount of experimental determinants could sufficiently
condition the inverse problem to allow a reliable estimate
of the whole parameter set. What we have done is in fact
to sample the space of solutions of the inverse problem
using a genetic algorithm: a larger number of experimental constraints would reduce the dimension of the space of
solutions.

Conclusion
In this work we have discussed the problem of mining,
measuring and estimating the value of parameters needed
in mathematical models describing the signalling processes mediated by protein-protein interactions. The lack
of kinetic interaction rates measured in reliable in vivo and
in vitro experiments is currently the major limitation to the
creation of complex models of signaling pathway. We
have attempted to show that biological information can
be also extracted from a model which, levaraging on
known kinetic parameters, attempts to provide a qualitative estimate of unknown parameters, even in the case of
ill-conditioned optimization problems. We have thus
sampled the space of model parameters using the Genetic
Algorithm to estimate sets of unknown parameters. This
sampling procedure has shown the existence of a basin of
attraction for several kinetic constants. This might be
interpreted as a a necessary condition for the network to
produce a specific outcome of the time – course of its
components. The estimated value of some of the parameters have shown a small coefficient of variation across the
set of solutions, though the high dimensionality of this
space allows to estimate realiable values and draw conlusions only on these few parameters.
