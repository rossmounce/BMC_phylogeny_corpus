Abstract
Background: We report on the probable horizontal transfer of a mitochondrial gene, cytb, between species of
Neotropical bruchid beetles, in a zone where these species are sympatric.
The bruchid beetles Acanthoscelides obtectus, A. obvelatus, A. argillaceus and Zabrotes subfasciatus develop on various bean
species in Mexico. Whereas A. obtectus and A. obvelatus develop on Phaseolus vulgaris in the Mexican Altiplano, A. argillaceus
feeds on P. lunatus in the Pacific coast. The generalist Z. subfasciatus feeds on both bean species, and is sympatric with A.
obtectus and A. obvelatus in the Mexican Altiplano, and with A. argillaceus in the Pacific coast. In order to assess the
phylogenetic position of these four species, we amplified and sequenced one nuclear (28S rRNA) and two mitochondrial
(cytb, COI) genes.
Results: Whereas species were well segregated in topologies obtained for COI and 28S rRNA, an unexpected pattern
was obtained in the cytb phylogenetic tree. In this tree, individuals from A. obtectus and A. obvelatus, as well as Z.
subfasciatus individuals from the Mexican Altiplano, clustered together in a unique little variable monophyletic unit. In
contrast, A. argillaceus and Z. subfasciatus individuals from the Pacific coast clustered in two separated clades, identically
to the pattern obtained for COI and 28S rRNA. An additional analysis showed that Z. subfasciatus individuals from the
Mexican Altiplano also possessed the cytb gene present in individuals of this species from the Pacific coast. Zabrotes
subfasciatus individuals from the Mexican Altiplano thus demonstrated two cytb genes, an "original" one and an
"infectious" one, showing 25% of nucleotide divergence. The "infectious" cytb gene seems to be under purifying selection
and to be expressed in mitochondria.
Conclusion: The high degree of incongruence of the cytb tree with patterns for other genes is discussed in the light of
three hypotheses: experimental contamination, hybridization, and pseudogenisation. However, none of these seem able
to explain the patterns observed. A fourth hypothesis, involving recent horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between A.
obtectus and A. obvelatus, and from one of these species to Z. subfasciatus in the Mexican Altiplano, seems the only
plausible explanation. The HGT between our study species seems to have occurred recently, and only in a zone where
the three beetles are sympatric and share common host plants. This suggests that transfer could have been effected by
some external vector such as a eukaryotic or viral parasite, which might still host the transferred fragment.

Background
The traditional view of evolution supports that DNA is
transferred vertically from parent to offspring. Hybridization and genetic transfer between different species is usually strongly limited. However, exceptions to this rule, i.e.
the horizontal transmission of genetic material between
distantly related organisms (HGT), are increasingly recognized as an important process of evolution in prokaryotes
[1-4]. In eukaryotes, however, reported cases of betweenspecies genetic exchanges not involving hybridization
have been essentially limited to noncoding or parasitic
transposons or virus sequences. Exceptions to this are a
few instances of horizontal transfer of selected genes
between prokaryotes and eukaryotes (e. g., [5-7]) and two
reports suggesting lateral transfer of mitochondrial genes
between genetically distant land plant groups [8,9]. No
instance of HGT in animals has been reported up to now.
In a recent paper, Martin [10] discusses the relevance of
the HGT hypothesis in eukaryotes, focusing on land
plants, and stresses the need for corroborating studies in
other eukaryote groups. However, he addresses the necessity of careful interpretation of HGT data, and points to
the requirement of first discussing such data in the light of
standard theories of vertical inheritance of genes.
Our study investigates the phylogenetic relationships
between four Neotropical bruchid beetles (Coleoptera,
Bruchidae), namely Acanthoscelides obtectus Say, A. obvelatus Bridwell, A. argillaceus Sharp, and Zabrotes subfasciatus
Boheman. These beetles develop on seeds of several bean
species (genus Phaseolus): Acanthoscelides obtectus and A.
obvelatus feed on the common bean (P. vulgaris L. group),
A. argillaceus on the Lima bean (P. lunatus L. group), and
Z. subfasciatus on both. As A. obtectus,A. obvelatus and Z.
subfasciatus can develop on beans of the same species, they
are often sympatric in wild or cultivated common beanpopulations. We sampled individuals from these three
species in the southern part of the Mexican Altiplano, one
such zone of sympatric occurrence of A. obtectus,A. obvelatus and Z. subfasciatus (Figure 1). Although the geographic
range of A. argillaceus overlaps with those of its two congeners, it is rarely found in the same habitat, because of its
distinct host plant. Acanthoscelides argillaceus and the generalist Z. subfasciatus, however, commonly co-occur in
wild Lima bean populations [11]. This is the case in the
Pacific coast of Mexico (Figure 1), where individuals from
these two species were sampled.

The genera Acanthoscelides and Zabrotes are morphologically very different [12], and are thought to have diverged
during the Palaeocene (65 to 54.8 mya) or the Eocene
(54.8 to 33.7 mya) [13], whereas the three Acanthoscelides
species studied here belong to the same morphologically
defined group within the genus and seem to have diverged
during the Miocene (23.8 to 5.3 mya) [14,15]. To confirm
the phylogenetic position of these four species in the context of host plant adaptation (see [16]), we performed
amplification and sequencing of two mitochondrial genes
and one nuclear gene.

Results
For each of the three studied genes, different models of
evolution were selected by likelihood ratio tests: for COI,
the Tamura-Nei model with a proportion of invariable
sites and a gamma distribution was selected; for cytb, the
Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model with a gamma distribution was selected; for 28s rRNA, the Kimura 2-parameters
model was selected. Topologies of phylogenetic trees were
congruent for 28S rRNA and COI, and showed each spe-

cies as a monophyletic group, the three Acanthoscelides
species forming a distinct clade from Z. subfasciatus (see
Figure 2a) (28S rRNA [accession numbers AY881176–
AY881195, DQ152235–DQ152238]; COI [accession
numbers AY881196–AY881214, AY881232, DQ152239–
DQ152242]). COI genetic distances ranged from 0.273 to
0.324 substitutions per site between Acanthoscelides spp.
and Zabrotes subfasciatus, and from 0.172 to 0.212 substitutions per site among Acanthoscelides species. According
to a recent calibration of a beetle mitochondrial molecular clock [17], such genetic distances correspond to divergence times of 35–40 My between Acanthoscelides spp. and
Zabrotes subfasciatus, and 20–25 My among Acanthoscelides
species. These divergence times were confirmed by esti-

mates obtained from mitochondrial 12S rRNA [16], and
are fairly similar to the fossil record [13].
The analysis of cytb sequences, in contrast, revealed an
unexpected pattern (see Figure 2b) (accession numbers
AY422485–AY422488,
AY422474–AY422479,
AY881215–AY881232). First, individuals of A. obtectus
and A. obvelatus were not separated in two distinct clades,
but grouped into a single, little variable monophyletic
unit, as would be expected for individuals belonging to
the same species. A core clade containing 46 of the 50
sequenced individuals from the two species included 14
closely related haplotypes (maximal distance: 0.0084),
some of them shared by the two species, others private to
A. obtectus or A. obvelatus. In contrast, A. argillaceus indi-

viduals clustered in a separate clade, whose mean distance
to the A. obtectus – A. obvelatus core clade was 0.143. Secondly, cytb data revealed a surprising discrepancy among
the individuals of Z. subfasciatus. Whereas an expected
0.25 nucleotide divergence from Acanthoscelides spp. was
found for the Z. subfasciatus individuals from the Pacific
coast of Mexico, three Z. subfasciatus individuals from the
Altiplano (coming from three different populations)
showed a cytb sequence identical to the most common A.
obtectus – A. obvelatus core clade haplotype.
PCR with specific primers and subsequent sequencing
revealed that the three Altiplano Z. subfasciatus individuals
surprisingly carried both cytb genes (Figure 2b), their own
plus the one demonstrating an Acanthoscelides origin. The
specific primers were then applied to other Z. subfasciatus
individuals from the Altiplano and the Pacific coast. In the
Altiplano, 20 individuals out of 70 were revealed to carry
both cytb genes – while the remaining 50 only carried their
own specific cytb – whereas in the Pacific coast, all the 40
sampled individuals were revealed to carry only their own
cytb haplotype. The specific primers were then also
applied to 25 individuals of a laboratory colony of Z. subfasciatus that had been maintained for 10 months in the
Laboratory of Evolutionary Entomology at the University
of Neuchâtel (Switzerland). The colony was founded
using individuals from the Mexican Altiplano, i.e., potentially affected by the HGT. These individuals had not been
in contact with any Acanthoscelides for about 5–10 generations. Three individuals out of the 25 were revealed to
carry both cytb genes, while 22 showed only the Z. subfasciatus haplotype. The number of individuals sampled in
each site and the number of individuals fitting the core
clade haplotype are summarized in Table 2.
An analysis of cytb sequence variation within the A. obtectus – A. obvelatus core clade revealed no frameshift, and a
low (0.106) ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous
changes, significantly lower than 1 (likelihood ratio test:
2(ln [Likelihood(M1)]-ln [Likelihood(M2)]) = 47.5; χ2 [1
df]: P < 10-4), indicating that this gene is under selection.
Furthermore, these sequences included no mitochondrial
stop codon, but typically five nuclear stop codons,
strongly suggesting that this gene is replicated by a mitochondrion, and neither by a nuclear nor a bacterial
machinery.

Discussion
The cytb pattern shown by A. obtectus, A. obvelatus and
three Mexican Altiplano Z. subfasciatus individuals is
highly incongruent with traditional taxonomy, and with
the COI and 28S rRNA pattern. This is even more astonishing, considering that cytb and COI are supposedly
genetically linked in the non-recombining mitochondrial
genome.

Four hypotheses can be addressed to explain this unexpected result: (i) experimental contamination, (ii) hybridization, (iii) pseudogenisation and (iv) horizontal gene
transfer.
Contamination hypothesis
All experiments were simultaneously conducted on many
(>200) bruchid samples, including museum specimens
with low amounts of DNA, by the same researcher in the
same laboratory. Only the cytb PCR for Mexican Altiplano
individuals yielded an additional, unexpected band. In
Acanthoscelides, no individual from the Pacific Coast A.
argillaceus carried the additional gene, although they were
analyzed simultaneously with the A. obtectus and A. obvelatus samples. A putative laboratory contaminant would
not only have affected the samples coming from the Mexican Altiplano but also individuals from other sites and
particularly museum specimens, which contain very small
amounts of DNA, given the fact that samples were randomized on the 96-well plates, both during DNA extraction
and PCR reactions. Another strong argument against the
contamination hypothesis is that several individuals of
the core clade from both A. obtectus and A. obvelatus demonstrated private cytb haplotypes. These haplotypes cannot be the consequence of a contamination, since they
were found only once (we sequenced all the amplified cytb
fragments). In the case of a contamination, a single haplotype would be expected to occur in a large number of
random samples, whereas our data show many related but
distinct – and sometimes private – haplotypes found in a
non-random subset of the samples. Sampling contamination (e.g., the presence of Acanthoscelides tissues in Z. subfasciatus samples) can also be excluded, since three Z.
subfasciatus individuals sampled from the experimental
colony showed the additional cytb PCR band. The experiments on colony individuals (DNA extraction, PCR) were
conducted several weeks after the analysis of the wild samples, making any cross-experiment contamination impossible.
Hybridization hypothesis
Hybridization between Acanthoscelides species and Zabrotes subfasciatus is very unlikely. First, the split between
the two genera dates back to around 40 mya (molecular
clock data) to 60 mya (fossil record) ago. Moreover, they
demonstrate a very high level of nucleotide divergence
(25%). Usually, the degree of genetic divergence in documented cases of interspecific hybridization in insects
never exceeds 5%-10% of nucleotide divergence for protein-encoding mitochondrial genes [18-20], which is
much lower than the 25% divergence found between
Acanthoscelides and Zabrotes. Secondly, hybridization
appears functionally impossible, given the highly differentiated morphology, especially in the male genitalia. The
lateral lobes of the male genitalia – which play the deci-

sive role of pushing aside parts of the female genitalia to
allow penetration by the median lobe, and which are
known to be part of a specific lock/key system – are spectacularly different between the two genera. Borowiec [12]
points out that the structure of the aedeagus is very different in Zabrotes and Acanthoscelides and highly specialized
in both. The lateral lobes are particularly distinct, short
and almost entirely fused in Zabrotes, but elongate and
divided by a deep cleft almost to the base in Acanthoscelides. In the bruchid family, in which many cryptic species remain to be described, male genitalia are often the
only character to distinguish between otherwise morphologically identical (but never hybridizing) sibling species.
This clearly explains why any attempt to produce hybrid
offspring between Acanthoscelides and Zabrotes failed (N.
Alvarez, unpublished observations). Moreover, even in
the two morphologically similar Acanthoscelides obtectus
and A. obvelatus, no evidence of interspecific hybridization
has been detected in natura, despite the genetic analysis
(by means of diagnostic microsatellite loci) of hundreds
of individuals from the two species, among which dozens
originated from sympatric populations [15].

study in plants [8,9]). We assume that species polyphyly
in the cytb core clade results from a relatively ancient HGT
process having started at the time of the core clade ancestor or earlier. Alternatively, one may interpret this clade as
resulting from a series of numerous, very recent HGT
events. Under the latter hypothesis, the functional constraints we outlined in the last paragraph would have predated HGT's, and would not guarantee that the transferred
gene is active and expressed in a mitochondrion.

Pseudogene hypothesis
An additional surprise in our data is that the putatively
transferred fragment appears to evolve under purifying
selection. The rate of non-synonymous substitutions is
significantly lower than expected under a model involving
a non-selected gene, and there is no insertion or deletion
in any cytb sequenced fragment. Moreover, the fragment
seems to be expressed in a mitochondrion. Given that the
gene is under purifying selection, it could hardly have
been translated using the nuclear genetic code, since in
that case, five codons would have been translated in stopcodons. These properties argue for an active gene, rather
than a pseudogene. A pseudogene – which by definition
can hardly ever be under purifying selection – would not
show a bias to synonymous over non-synonymous mutations, and its sequence would most likely show nucleotide
insertion or deletion. Furthermore, in the exceptional
context of a selected pseudogene [21], the gene must not
contain any stop codon when translated with the nuclear
genetic code. The combined evidence suggests that genes
from the core clade are (i) under purifying selection and
are therefore not pseudogenes, and (ii) are translated in a
mitochondrion.

Under either of these two hypotheses (one ancient HGT
or several recent ones), the transfer from one species to
another could possibly have been carried out by an external vector. Candidate vectors include viruses, prokaryotes
such as Wolbachia or other endosymbiotic bacteria (a case
of horizontal transfer of genes from Wolbachia to the
nuclear genome of its host was recently reported in bruchids [22]) or even eukaryotes (e.g., intra- or extra-cellular
parasites, endoparasitoïds). The location of the transferred cytb in the recipient species remains to be investigated. A parsimonious hypothesis is that the transferred
cytb is still hosted by its vector. A eukaryotic parasite might
have "domesticated" a bruchid mitochondrion (or at least
some bruchid mitochondrial gene), carrying it on when
switching to a new species. Such an hypothesis could
explain the presence of two cytb genes in Z. subfasciatus
individuals from the Altiplano, suggesting that one gene
could be carried by a parasite, and the other could belong
to the mitochondria of Z. subfasciatus itself. This could
also be the case in A. obtectus or A. obvelatus, even though
we could not yet demonstrate the existence of a second
cytb gene in individuals belonging to the core clade.

Horizontal gene transfer hypothesis
Our data clearly argue against any standard explanation
for the genetic pattern we observed. A horizontal transfer
of the cytb gene between A. obtectus and A. obvelatus, and
from one of these species to Z. subfasciatus, seems the most
plausible hypothesis, even though the probability of such
a mitochondrial genetic exchange between distinct
eukaryote species is very low (but is invoked in a recent

The data available do not allow formal rejection of this
latter hypothesis, under which the transferred pieces of
DNA could even be nuclear pseudogenes. This hypothesis
requires, however, a sudden, very recent increase of the
HGT rate from zero to a very high value. This could be
conceivable in the context of a rapid, infectious process
(if, for instance, one specific strain of a parasite acquires
the ability to switch species and invade the new niche),
but in this case one would expect to see a single transferred haplotype (or a small number of them), whereas
the intricate phylogeny of the core clade implies several
events of HGT involving several distinct haplotypes.

If we consider that the vector may belong to a eukaryotic
group (i) capable of mitochondrial recombination and
(ii) showing a genetic code that uses the same mitochondrial stop-codons as those used by the mitochondria of
invertebrates – these two conditions are for example filled
by most unicellular eukaryotes – then the mitochondria
carried by the parasite may have "included" the
"bruchid"-cytb in its genome after recombination.
Another interesting point is that the transferred gene rep-

Obviously, additional molecular, cellular and tissular
characterization would be of great relevance to the understanding of this intriguing system, of the exact length and
structure of the apparently transferred fragment, and the
nature of the genome hosting it. The contemporaneous
nature of this putative HGT – it is still polymorphic in Z.

star™), 0.5 µL of forward primer, and 0.5 µL of reverse
primer. PCRs were performed separately for each primer
pair on a PTC-200™ thermocycler using the following
cycling conditions: initial denaturation at 92°C (1 min 30
s); 30 cycles of 92°C (30 s), annealing at 55°C (45 s),
72°C (1 min 30 s); final elongation at 72°C (10 min).
Sequencing reaction was carried out using Applied Biosystems BygDye™ protocol. Products of the sequencing reactions were then analyzed on an ABI Prism 310 sequencer.
Chromatograms were manually corrected using Chromas
2.23 (Technelysium Pty. Ltd., Helensvale, Australia) and
further aligned using ClustalW 1.83 [24]. The best-fit substitution model was determined using Modeltest 3.06
[25] through hierarchical likelihood ratio tests. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed by maximum likelihood
using Treefinder [26]. Distances between groups were
determined by distance methods using Mega 2.1 [27] with
standard parameters (Kimura 2-parameters; gamma shape
parameter = 0.5). Primers specific for cytb consensus haplotypes of A. obtectus and A. obvelatus, and for cytb haplotypes of Pacific coast Z. subfasciatus, respectively, were
designed. Sequences of specific primers to the most common haplotype shared by A. obtectus and A. obvelatus are:
TTGATAACGCAACCTTAACC (forward primer) and
GATTAGCAGGAATGAAGTTG
(reverse
primer).
Sequences of specific primers to Pacific-coast Z. subfasciatus cytb are: GAGATAATGCAACATTAACA (forward
primer) and GGTTTGCGGGCGTAAAATTA (reverse
primer). To test whether the sequenced cytb genes were
under purifying selection (i.e., they were not the result of
a nuclear mitochondrial pseudogene), we compared rates
of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. Two
models of codon evolution [28] were tested using PAML
3.14b [29]. In model M1, the ratio of non-synonymous to
synonymous evolutionary rate (ω) was set to 1, as
expected for a pseudogene. In model M2, the ratio was
free to vary. A likelihood-ratio test was performed to compare the two models.

Methods

Reviewers' comments

Individuals of A. obtectus, A. obvelatus, A. argillaceus, and Z.
subfasciatus were sampled in the southern Mexican Altiplano. Coordinates of sampled sites are given in Table 1.
We amplified and sequenced bi-directionally two mitochondrial genes – cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and cytochrome b (cytb) – and one nuclear gene – 28S ribosomal
rRNA (28S rRNA) – from 6 to 25 individuals in each species, using universal primers (28S rRNA: 28ee and 28 mm;
COI: C1-J-2183 and TL2-N-3014; cytb: CB-J-10933 and
CB-N-11367 [23]). Total genomic DNA was extracted
using DNeasy™ 96-well kit (QIAGEN). PCR amplifications were performed in a final volume of 10 µL, which
contained 1 µL of extracted DNA, 1 µL of 25 mM MgCl2,
0.1 µL of 10 mM dNTPs, 1 µL of PCR buffer (Eurogentec),

This paper presents potentially interesting data and a possibly compelling result – lateral gene transfers of genes

the conclusion proposed here. In my view the present
study is still too weak to support the conclusion.

licates in Z. subfasciatus, since it survived ~5–10 generations in the laboratory.
Ecological context of HGT
As this HGT event has been detected only between individuals from the Altiplano where the three species cooccur and share the same host plant, it gives clues to the
ecological context which may favor such a gene exchange.
Indeed, the ecologically distinct A. argillaceus does not
demonstrate a HGT pattern for cytb, despite its phylogenetic proximity to A. obtectus and A. obvelatus. This suggests that the probability of the occurrence of lateral gene
transfer is partly controlled by the environment. The
occurrence of HGT between bruchid species (i) presenting
a high degree of phylogenetic divergence but (ii) sharing
some dimensions of their ecological niche (e.g., their host
plant) could indicate that ecology, as well as phylogeny,
might play a role in the distribution of genetic variation
across taxa.

Conclusion
Recent horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between A. obtectus
and A. obvelatus, and from one of these species to Z. subfasciatus in the Mexican Altiplano, seems the most plausible hypothesis to explain the pattern we observed in our
data for cytb. The transfer could have been effected by
some external vector such as a eukaryotic parasite, which
might still host the transferred fragment.

Certainly, the authors reject several alternative hypotheses
to explain the bizarre distribution of cytb genes in bruchids. For instance, the presence of two divergent copies of
the cytb gene in Z. subfasciatus, one of them being very conserved in sequence and shared by a set of traditionally dis-

tantly related taxa, deserves some explanation. In that
respect, the authors are right to attract our attention of this
result. They exclude the possibility of contamination,
hybridization events and the possibility that one of the
copies is in fact a pseudogene. Importantly enough
though, I feel that more work is needed to test their final
proposition and to conclude in favour of the lateral transfer of the gene between animals, based on the sole evi-

dence presented here. Some more in depth analyses
should be performed in order to test their claim and to
propose a more precise interpretation of the data. Typically, questions about the mechanism of acquisition of
this second copy of cytb should be at the heart of such
future studies. Nevertheless, some quick adjustments
could be incorporated into a moderately revised version
of this manuscript.

It might be of some help in deciding if it is premature or
legitimate to quote this study as a case of lateral gene
transfer in animals if the authors could answer some of
the questions below.
1. Is it really impossible that an endoparasite is a source of
a contamination, that the relatively conserved cytb gene
shared by the three species is not of bruchid origin and
that the observations may be partly artefactual?
If these species hosted a population of closely related
endoparasite, could not two cytb sequences be amplified
from these organisms? In this case, we would get the
sequences of the population of endoparasites (presenting
thus some distinct but related haplotypes) and the one for
the bruchid? What does a blast of this additional copy
teach us: who are the closest completely sequenced relatives having homologues to this additional sequence?
Including these data in a broader phylogenetic tree via a
broader cytb alignment would certainly be a very important additional result to present to the readers. Are these
bruchid sequences still monophyletic when a larger taxonomic sample is investigated and, if not, where do these
gene copies branch in the tree? How much evidence support that these two sequences are carried in the genome of
the bruchid (i.e. in the mitochondrial DNA of the species
as the result of an actual transfer)?
Response from authors
The hypothesis of an endoparasite carrying the unusual cytb
sequences deserves some attention. These sequences, however,
are undoubtedly of bruchid origin, since a blast search of Genbank using the additional copy shows that the closest sequences
outside Acanthoscelides or Zabrotes are carried by four
bruchids, two Bruchus (B. signaticornis [AY390728.1], B.
tristiculus [AY390729.1]) and two Bruchidius (B. saudicus
[AY625444.1], B. rubicundus [AY625443.1]), all of them
found exclusively in the Old World, and therefore unikely to
have been in contact with Acanthoscelides and/or Zabrotes
since 90 Mya. Moreover, the first 50 blast hits are all distributed amongst the bruchid family, both in New World genera
(i.e. Acanthoscelides and Zabrotes) and in Old World genera (i.e. Bruchus, Bruchidius, Tuberculobruchus, Conicobruchus, Palaeoacanthoscelides and Callosobruchus).
More distant sequences are found in species within the superfamily Chrysomeloidea, which comprises bruchids (e.g. Anophophora), or within more distantly related beetles (e.g.
Blackburnia) or crickets (e.g. Gryllus). We therefore believe
that presenting a broader phylogenetic tree including sequences
from these more distantly-related species would not add useful
information, since the additional cytb copy is typical of bruchids, and since the root of the tree is obviously in the Zabrotes
lineage. Nevertheless, we certainly admit that we cannot be
sure by which genome the additional gene is carried; It might
be hosted by a eukaryote endoparasite, or by a prokaryotic or

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/21

viral genome, although we present some evidence for mitochondrial translation. We hope to be able to address this question
in a middle-term perspective.
2. Could insect species of the outgroup carry as well more
than one cytb copy?
If we admit that the bruchid carries two copies and that
this is not contamination, and if it carries them within its
mitochondria, the scenario of a transfer is appealing,
except if the presence of two copies is a "normal" condition for those insects. Without the study of the genetic
composition of the outgroup, it is not clear to me if the
apparently original situation of the Z. subfasciatus individuals (with two copies of cytb present in the Altiplano) is
ancestral (vertically inherited) or derived (laterally
acquired).
Could it be the case that the outgroup of these species
actually already contained two copies of this gene? Are
there precedents of related organisms with two cytb genes?
Could it be tested by studying the composition of some
completely sequenced mitochondrial genomes? Could
then the present result be explained either (i) by a much
more ancient lateral gene transfer (somewhere at the base
of the bruchids, in which case the scenarios should try to
explain this ancient phenomenon) or if not, eventually
(ii) by some complex scenarios of independent genes
losses to explain the patchy distribution of cytb in current
bruchid populations?
Response from authors
In our opinion, the polymorphic nature of this character (i.e.
both the ecological/phylogeographic pattern of the distribution
of the additional copy and the rare status of Zabrotes individuals carrying the two copies within sites) argues for a relatively
recent event (i.e., more recent than the basal divergence of all
the beetles studied here, as suggested by the reviewer). Even
admitting that the outgroup carried two independent copies –
that would, for instance, have two distinct functions and be
indispensable to these bruchids – a vertical scenario could not
have led to such a low (0–1%) divergence between the original
Acanthoscelides copy and one of those carried by some Zabrotes subfasciatus indivudals, knowing that the two species
have diverged during more than 50 Mya [13,30]. Alternatively, one would have to invoke a very bizarre pattern of gene
conversion. We believe that sequence identity in this relatively
rapidly-evolving mtDNA gene tends to favour the hypothesis of
a relatively recent horizontal transfer over the hypothesis of an
ancient divergence of the two copies, followed by vertical double
inheritance of both copies.

3. Can one deduce anything about the mechanisms of
recombination that inserted the new copy, if they are all
within the mitochondrial bruchid genome?

Page 8 of 11

Biology Direct 2006, 1:21

If there is only one type of mitochondria in the bruchids,
and if this mitochondria carries the two gene copies, it
seems at first sight that the presence of two cytb copies in
Z. subfasciatus rules out the hypothesis of a legitimate
recombination to transfer this gene. Such a mechanism
would likely have led to the replacement of one former
cytb copy by another one, resulting in one copy per species. Could the opposite observation suggest then that the
additional cytb was transferred in kind of a hitch-hiking
process, due to the insertion of one (or more) other markers in the mitochondrial DNA, which could have themselves happened by homologous recombination? In this
case the HGT event would be even larger, and would concern several markers. By contrast, for the species presenting only one copy of cytb, could we study the location of
this single copy with more precision? A (partial) study of
the genetic composition of the mitchondrial genome of
these bruchids, typically of the genes bordering the cytb
gene, could be very informative here. They may or may
not have retained evidence of recombination or synteny.
Would it be possible to characterise the genetic context of
the cytb genes and test their conservation in later studies to
decide if there was one or several instance of LGT and
what was their mechanism? Alternatively, could the cytb
copy be jumping using transposases? Do we have any evidence for/against the implication of transposons in this
story?
Response from authors
We agree that sequencing the full mitochondrial genome(s) of
bruchid individuals carrying two cytochrome b copies would
help understanding further what happened and how. Unfortunately these data are lacking, and are not so easy to collect,
given the relatively high level of sequence similarity between the
two copies, the lack of knowledge of the genomic structure, and
the scarcity of living individuals with two copies – a new round
of field sampling is probably required. Sequencing the full mitochondrial genome(s) would also help us in understanding why
a "double-pattern" is lacking for other cytb -linked genes such
as COI, which seem to be consistent with the scenario supported by nuclear genes and classical taxonomy.

4. About the nature of the most likely vector: virus,
endoparasite or... even an host reservoir?
I was interested by the different hypotheses presented in
this paper regarding the vector of the possible lateral
transfer. Viruses and endoparasites might be good candidates indeed, although I was wondering if a third possibility, inspired by the "you are what you eat theory" (see.
W.F. Doolittle, 1998), could not be raised as well. Since
these bruchid species share a host, could not their host
have provided them the additional cytb copy?

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/21

Response from authors
See our response to question 1.

5. Ecological scenarios and the interest of harbouring two
cytb copies to survive in the Altiplano.
I may have misunderstood, but I believe that the authors
suggest that the persistence of two copies (or at least the
swapping of cytb genes) could serve the purpose of an
endoparasite. My naïve question is: could not it serve the
purpose of the bruchids themselves? Could not they benefit in the Altiplano from such a genomic make up? Do we
have any way to investigate the biochemistry/activity of
these two divergent copies in more depth that would suggest to us that even if they are related their function is only
partially overlapping?
Response from authors
This is an interesting hypothesis. Developing the capacity for
research on functional mito-genomics in these non-model animals can only be a very long-term perspective, however.
Reviewer's report 2
Adam Eyre-Walker, University of Sussex, Centre for the Study of
Evolution & School of Biological Sciences, Brighton, United Kingdom
This is an interesting paper which describes what I believe
is one of those observations which almost defies rational
explanation, although the observation does appear to be
real.
Response from authors
We fully agree with this statement.

In this paper the authors describe a phylogenetic analysis
of bruchid beetles from Mexico. They show that for one
nuclear and one mitochondrial gene, the species are moderately divergent and phylogenetically well resolved – i.e.
each species is monophyletic with high bootstrap support.
However, for another mitochondrial gene the pattern is
very different; two of the species have an almost identical
cytb gene which is also shared by some members of the
most divergent of the beetle species. All individuals which
share this cytb sequence come from the same geographical
area and live on the same host plant. Intriguingly, those
individuals of the species Z. subfasciatus, which have the
shared cytb gene, also have a cytb gene which is similar to
Z. subfasciatus individuals from elsewhere in Mexico; this
other cytb sequence is as divergent as one might expect
given how distantly related this species is to the others.
So how do we explain this bizarre pattern? The authors
consider a number of alternatives including contamination, hybridisation and pseudogenisation, none of which
seems likely. This leaves horizontal gene transfer as possibly the only other explanation. They suggest that maybe

Page 9 of 11

Biology Direct 2006, 1:21

some eukaryotic vector has transferred the cytb gene
between different species. However, two questions
remain. Why has only a part of the mitochondrial DNA
been transferred? Individuals from different species share
similar cytb sequences but have very different mitochondrial COI sequences.
Response from authors
See our response to Reviewer 1 (question 3).

And why don't all species which have this particular cytb
sequence also have their own original cytb sequence, as
individuals of Z. subfasciatus appear to have. One can
explain these patterns but the explanations are not simple.
Response from authors
This question highlights one limitation of the PCR-only experimental strategy we had in this work. PCR can miss existing
gene copies, so that we cannot make sure whether Acanthoscelides individuals from the "core clade" carrying the apparently mobile cytb sequence do or do not carry an additional,
"private" copy (especially knowing that the mobile copy is probably of Acanthoscelides origin). Given the phylogenetic proximity between these two species, we did not succeed in designing
specific primers. Again, full-genome data would clarify these
questions but are lacking.
Reviewer's report 3
Alexey Kondrashov, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,
Maryland, United States
The authors claim that they discovered a case of rather
recent lateral gene transfer between mitochondrial
genomes of moderately related beetles. While the claim is
striking, I see no obvious holes in the data and reasoning
and, thus, tend to believe it.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/21

Response from authors
This is an interesting suggestion. We analysed separately the
sample of "core clade" haplotypes and found significantly (p
<0.05) negative Tajima's D and Fu & Li's F*, which is indicative of a star-like genealogy compatible with the selective sweep
(or founder event) hypothesis. Single-locus arguments for selective sweeps are generally weak, however, given the large
number of factors potentially influencing the shape of genealogies.

A very interesting observation is that Zabrotes subfasciatus
is polymorphic by presence/absence of laterally acquired
cytb gene. When this gene is present, it does not replace the
original one and, instead, the two coexist within the same
mitochondrial genome. This system opens a rare opportunity to study microevolutionary aspects of lateral gene
transfer. It would be worthwhile to sequence complete
mitochondrial genomes possessing two cytb genes (native
and foreign).
Response from authors
See our response to Reviewer 1 (question 3).

Also, standard selective sweep analysis may tell us
whether positive selection favors genomes with the extra,
foreign cytb. A great system for further analysis of eukaryotic LGT.
