Abstract
Background: Mycolactones are immunosuppressive and cytotoxic polyketides, comprising five naturally
occurring structural variants (named A/B, C, D, E and F), produced by different species of very closely
related mycobacteria including the human pathogen, Mycobacterium ulcerans. In M. ulcerans strain Agy99,
mycolactone A/B is produced by three highly homologous type I polyketide megasynthases (PKS), whose
genes (mlsA1: 51 kb, mlsA2: 7.2 kb and mlsB: 42 kb) are found on a 174 kb plasmid, known as pMUM001.
Results: We report here comparative genomic analysis of pMUM001, the complete DNA sequence of a
190 kb megaplasmid (pMUM002) from Mycobacterium liflandii 128FXT and partial sequence of two
additional pMUM replicons, combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/
MS) analysis. These data reveal how PKS module and domain differences affecting MlsB correlate with the
production of mycolactones E and F. For mycolactone E these differences from MlsB in M. ulcerans Agy99
include replacement of the AT domain of the loading module (acetate to propionate) and the absence of
an entire extension module. For mycolactone F there is also a reduction of one extension module but also
a swap of ketoreductase domains that explains the characteristic stereochemistry of the two terminal sidechain hydroxyls, an arrangement unique to mycolactone F
Conclusion: The mycolactone PKS locus on pMUM002 revealed the same large, three-gene structure and
extraordinary pattern of near-identical PKS domain sequence repetition as observed in pMUM001 with
greater than 98.5% nucleotide identity among domains of the same function. Intra- and inter-strain
comparisons suggest that the extreme sequence homogeneity seen among the mls PKS genes is caused by
frequent recombination-mediated domain replacement. This work has shed light on the evolution of
mycolactone biosynthesis among an unusual group of mycobacteria and highlights the potential of the mls
locus to become a toolbox for combinatorial PKS biochemistry.

Background
Mycolactone is a polyketide-derived, secondary metabolite and a major virulence factor of the human pathogen
Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU), the causative agent of Buruli
ulcer. At picogram concentrations mycolactone has
immunosuppressive properties and at higher concentrations it is cytotoxic for mammalian cells [1]. The molecule
is composed of an invariant core comprising a 12-membered macrolactone and side-chain that is esterified to a
highly unsaturated acyl side chain, the latter structure var-

ying amongst different MU strains (Figure 1) [1]. MU
strains from Africa, Australia and China produce variants
named mycolactones A/B, C, and D, respectively whilst
Mycobacterium liflandii (ML), a pathogen of frogs, produces mycolactone E, and the fish pathogens (Mycobacterium pseudoshottsii and Mycobacterium marinum DL240490
(DL) and others) produce mycolactone F [2-9] (Figure 1).
Despite the multiple species names given to mycolactoneproducing mycobacteria (MPM), multi locus sequence
analysis (MLSA) of all these strains indicates they share

greater than 98% nucleotide identity [10]. The MPM
appear to have evolved from a common M. marinum
ancestor by acquisition of a large circular plasmid that
conferred the ability to make mycolactones and then
spread throughout the world, occupying different hosts
[10-12].
In MU strain Agy99, the only strain for which a genome
sequence is currently available, a 174 kb megaplasmid
named pMUM001 has three very large genes (mlsA1: 51
kb, mlsA2: 7 kb and mlsB: 42 kb) (Figure 2A) [11] that
encode the modular type I PKSs required for mycolactone
synthesis. The plasmid also has three putative accessory
genes (MUP038, encoding a type II thioesterase; MUP045
encoding a beta-ketoacyl synthase and cyp140A7
[MUP053] encoding a cytochrome P450 hydroxylase).
MlsA1 and MlsA2 form a nine-extension module complex
that synthesises the mycolactone core, whilst MlsB is a single polypeptide, comprising seven extension modules that
are required for the synthesis of the side chain.
Bacterial type I PKS are modular multi-enzymes and act as
molecular assembly lines for the formation of polyketides
[13]. These enzymes function in a sequential manner
where each PKS module is responsible for one round of
chain elongation via the addition of (usually) either acetate or propionate, supplied to the PKS as an activated
malonyl or methylmalonyl-CoA thioester. Within each
PKS module are a series of covalently linked enzymatic
domains that process the growing polyketide chain before
passing it downstream to the next module in the system
[14]. The minimal set of enzymatic domains required for
PKS activity includes ketosynthase (KS), acyltransferase
(AT) and an acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain [15].
Ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH) and enoylreductase (ER) domains are also commonly found in modules
and form a so-called reductive loop, providing reducing
enzyme activities that modify the two or three-carbon unit
being added to the polyketide [15].
The mycolactone PKS (Mls locus) exhibits a number of
unusual features that distinguish it from other type I PKS
complexes. Firstly, the Mls PKSs are exceptionally large
with a total predicted monomeric size of ~3.0 MDa, placing them amongst the largest known cellular enzymes
[11]. Secondly, there is an unprecedented level of genetic
identity amongst the enzymatic domains of all Mls modules. For other type I PKSs, functionally identical domains
from the same PKS generally share 40 – 70% amino acid
(aa) sequence identity [16], however, identity between
domains of the Mls locus ranges from 98.7 – 100% [11].
The extreme sequence homology within the Mls locus
might be expected to provide a rich substrate for homologous recombination. Indeed, mycolactone negative

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/462

mutants frequently arise among laboratory passaged MU
strains; caused by partial deletion of the mls genes [17].
Mycolactone D produced by an MU strain from China differs from mycolactone A/B by the substitution of a methylene at C2' of the acyl side chain (Figure 1). In this strain,
the final extension module of MlsB possesses an AT
domain with propionate rather than acetate specificity,
suggesting natural recombination within mlsB [18]. However, mycolactone structural variations are quite
restricted. MPM recovered from around the world for 70
years all produce mycolactones with an absolutely conserved core and all variations occur within the fatty-acyl
side-chain (Figure 1). The role mycolactones play in the
survival of MPM and why variation is only tolerated (or
provides a selective advantage) in the side-chain is
unknown.
In this study we investigated the genetic basis for production of these variant structures, in particular for the frog
pathogen M. liflandii. We determined the complete DNA
sequence of the 190 kb megaplasmid (pMUM002) from
Mycobacterium liflandii 128FXT and the partial sequence of
pMUM replicons from Mycobacterium marinum DL240490
and M. ulcerans Japan 753. We also employed LC-MS/MS
structural analysis of their respective mycolactones. Our
results show that mycolactones produced by different
MPM are caused by genetic rearrangements between
homologous PKS domains of the Mls locus, highlighting
the plasticity of this region and its potential for combinatorial polyketide biochemistry.

Results
Overview of pMUM002 from M. liflandii 128FXT
Assembly of the complete DNA sequence of pMUM002
from four overlapping BAC clones (06A07: 77 kb, 06D10:
110 kb, 07A09: 90 kb, 10A03: 15 kb), revealed a 190,588
bp circular element containing 95 predicted CDS. A summary of the main features of pMUM002 compared with
pMUM001 is shown in Table 1 and an overview of its CDS
distribution is shown in Figure 2B.

Plasmid pMUM002 encodes 61 of its CDS (63.5%) on the
reverse strand and has a G+C content of 62.9%, which is
similar to pMUM001 (62.7% GC) [19]. Five genes, spanning 97.2 kb (51%) of the plasmid, are predicted to be
involved in mycolactone biosynthesis, with the same
arrangement as those present on pMUM001 [11]. These
genes include the three type I polyketide synthases (mlsA1:
51,060 bp, mlsA2: 7,233 bp and mlsB: 37,059 bp), a type
II thioesterase (MULP_063) and a FabH-like type III ketosynthase (MULP_070). Sequencing of the plasmid confirmed the previously reported absence of the cytochrome
P450 hydroxylase gene cyp140A7 [7], which is responsible
for the production of mycolactones A/B and D via hydrox-

Overview of pMUM003 from M. marinum DL240490
Three BAC clones from a DL genomic library were predicted to span all of pMUM003 (04D12: 110 kb, 051B: 99
kb, 048F: 98 kb) and these clones were selected for further
analyses. Based on the sizes of these BACs as determined
by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and the results
of end-sequencing, a map of pMUM003 was constructed
indicating it is a circular replicon with an estimated size of
~210 kb (Figure 2C). Due to the complex and time-consuming nature of sequencing mycolactone PKS loci
caused by the extreme sequence repetition, only the nonPKS region of pMUM003 was fully sequenced for this
study. The BAC clone 0412D spanned this region of the
plasmid from the 5' end of mlsB to the 3' end of mlsA1
(Figure 2C) and the complete sequence of 0412D was
104,530 bp with 102 predicted CDS. The two other
selected BAC clones (051B and 048F) were used in PCR,
sequencing and Southern blot analyses to confirm the
domain and module composition of specific regions of
the pMUM003 mls genes (see below).
Comparison of pMUM plasmids confirms their common
origin
Both pMUM002 and pMUM003 share the same overall
organization as pMUM001 with a core set of 42 CDS common to all three plasmids (see Additional file 1). A complete list of CDS from pMUM002 and the non-PKS region
of pMUM003 is presented and discussed in Additional
files 2 and 3. The pMUM001 gene MUP045 encodes a
putative FabH-like type III ketosynthase gene that is essential for mycolactone production [20] and may have acyltransferase activity, linking the mycolactone core and acylside chain. This gene is present in all three plasmids
(MUP045, MULP_070, MUDP_005) and they share very
high sequence identity; their predicted protein products
differing by only one amino acid, suggesting the importance of the gene for mycolactone biosynthesis. There
were also several regions of difference observed between
the plasmids that included deletions, insertions and other
genetic rearrangements. These alterations are presumably

mediated by the many ISE found in all pMUM plasmids.
For example, the absence of cyp140A7 in pMUM002 & 3,
encoding a p450 hydroxylase that modifies mycolactone,
is most likely explained by an IS2606-mediated deletion
(see Additional file 1). Overall, it appears that the main
function of the pMUM plasmids is for the production of
mycolactones with no other obvious virulence or virulence-associated genes present.
The pMUM002 Mls module and domain arrangements
correspond with the structure of mycolactone E
The complete sequencing of the mls locus of pMUM002
from ML revealed an extraordinarily high degree of similarity to the mls locus of pMUM001 with a module and
domain arrangement in near-perfect agreement with predictions based on the proposed structure of mycolactone
E [21]. The core macrocyclic lactone of mycolactone E is
synthesised by MlsA1 and MlsA2, comprising a loading
module and nine extension modules, terminating in a
putative integral C-terminal thioesterase (Figure 3). Similarly the acyl-side chain is synthesised by MlsB and comprises a load module with six extension modules (Figure
3). MlsB from pMUM002 is 12,353 aa, which is 1,778 aa
shorter than MlsB from pMUM001 (14,131 aa). The size
difference is due to the absence in pMUM002 of the
equivalent of module 4 from pMUM001, an absence that
corresponds precisely with the absence of a CH = CH moiety in the acyl-side chain of mycolactone E [21] (Figure 3).
There was also perfect agreement between observed structure and the pattern of acetate and propionate incorporation predicted from sequence analysis of the AT domains.
In particular, the AT domain of the MlsB load module is
methylmalonyl-CoA-specific (AT-III, Figure 3, see Additional file 4), indicating that ML uses a propionate starter
unit which corresponds perfectly with structure-based predictions [21]. These results provide another example of a
"swappable" domain location as the equivalent AT
domain in pMUM001 uses an acetate starter unit (AT-II).
The oxidation state predicted from the Mls sequence after
each stage of chain extension also aligns very closely with
mycolactone E structure. However, like pMUM001, extension module 2 of MlsA1 contains apparently inactive DH
and ER domains [11].

To reinforce the veracity of the above findings and to
resolve an outstanding discrepancy regarding the correct
structure of mycolactone E [8,21], LC-MS/MS analysis was
used to analyse mycolactones detected in lipid extracts
from two additional ML strains (ML XL5 and ML HW1).
These analyses revealed an identical ion trace and fragmentation pattern for m/z 737 ([M+Na]+ ion) as reported
for ML 128FXT (Figure 4). Thus, the combination of these
concordant structural data from multiple ML strains
together with the sequence analysis of the mls genes from

ML 128FXT provide compelling evidence that the mycolactone structure first reported by Hong et al [21] is correct.

genetic basis for the production of mycolactone F from
DL. Using BAC clone 051B as template, PCR and sequencing of the load module of mlsB identified that this module
has an AT-I (malonate) domain, indicating an acetate

starter unit for mycolactone F side-chain synthesis. This
arrangement, which is supported by structural data [5,8]
is the same as pMUM001 but different to ML which has an
AT-III (methylmalonate) domain (Figure 3).

The recent total synthesis of mycolactone F showed that
the hydroxyl groups at C11' and C13' of its acyl side chain
have the opposite stereochemistry to other mycolactones
[5]. KR domains control the geometry of the hydroxyls
and two types of this domain have been noted (A-type
and B-type), with each type responsible for a specific stereochemistry [22,23]. As the C11' and C13' side-chain
hydroxyl arrangement reported for mycolactone F had not
been observed in other mycolactones, it suggested that a
switch from A-type to B-type KR domains had occurred
within the first two extension modules of MlsB from
pMUM003. To test this hypothesis, we performed Southern hybridisation analysis of BACs containing either mlsA
or mlsB from pMUM001, pMUM002 and pMUM003 with
probes for either the KR-A or KR-B domain, and as predicted, Southern analysis confirmed that there are no Atype KR domains in mlsB of pMUM003 (Figure 5), consistent with our hypothesis that the A-type KR domains have
been replaced. This result also suggests the presence of a
previously unidentified Mls module type consisting of a
combination of KS, AT-II (malonate) and B-type KR
domains (Figure 3).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/462

MLSB module 7 is different between MU strains from
China and Japan
The above examples of module and domain rearrangement prompted a closer inspection of the mycolactones
produced by MU strains from Japan and China. MU
strains from these countries are genetically very closely
related with only one discriminating allele by MLSA and
identical InDel patterns [10,24]. Previous investigations
had revealed that strain MU98912 from China makes a
modified mycolactone (mycolactone D) due to the presence of an AT-III (methylmalonate) domain in extension
module 7 of MlsB [18]. However, the only published
report of the structure of mycolactones from Japan suggested that Japanese strains made mycolactone A/B [6]
and not mycolactone D as might have been expected. We
used PCR and sequencing of mlsB module 7 from the Japanese MU strain 753 to check the domain arrangement
and found that it has an AT-II (malonate) domain (Figure
6), which is different to that of MU98912 China but
which is the expected arrangement for mycolactone A/B
synthesis (Figure 3). Analysis of lipid extracts from
MU753 Japan by LC-MS/MS confirmed that this strain
does make mycolactone A/B, not mycolactone D (Figure
6) [18]. Sequence comparisons of this region from
MU753 with the same region among MU98912 and

MUAgy99 Africa shows that module arrangements and
the corresponding mycolactone produced does not necessarily correlate with strain relatedness (Figure 6), indicating that remodelling of the mls genes is occurring at a
frequency independent of single nucleotide mutation and
highlighting the dynamic nature of this locus.
Ongoing replacement, duplication and deletion of the
highly conserved Mls modules and domains
As observed in pMUM001, the pMUM002 mls DNA is
highly repetitive and exhibits extreme sequence conservation between domains with an identical catalytic function. For example, the 15 KS domains share > 99.1%
nucleotide identity over 1257 nts, which translates to only
nine variable amino acid residues among 419 aa. There
are three types of domains (LM-KS, AT-I and AT-II) that
have 100% intra-species nucleotide identity within both
pMUM001 and pMUM002. The extreme sequence identity is also conserved between strains and falls only marginally to 99.2 – 99.8% for these domains (Table 2). The
most variable of the enzymatic domains between species
are the ACP-I domains (95.2% nucleotide identity). When
modules of identical domain arrangement were compared, nucleotide identity ranged from 98.6% (mlsA modules 2, 4 and 7) to 99.9% (mlsA module 5 and mlsB
modules 1 and 2). Phylogenetic analysis of the domains
and modules across pMUM001 and pMUM002 emphasise the high degree of relatedness between these genetic
loci but also show that they cluster by strain, suggesting
that evolution of the locus is occurring vertically rather
than via horizontal exchanges between strains (Figure 7).

The previously reported domain swap in MlsB of
MU98912 China suggested either replacement of
domains, combinations of domains, or entire modules,
possibly by a gene conversion mechanism. A detailed
comparison of modules with an identical domain configuration revealed that identity between one or more
domains does not equate with identity over the whole
module (see Figure 7). For example, when an interspecies
nucleotide comparison is performed across the region
from the AT-II domain to the KR-A domain of module 5
of mlsA and modules 1 and 2 of mlsB, there is 100% nucleotide identity over 2682 nts. However, the KS and ACP
domains of these modules have only 99.2% and 99.5%
identity, respectively. When other modules of identical
organisation are analysed in this manner, similar patterns
are seen (Figure 7). Another example of this is the presence of an active DH domain in the LM of mlsB of
pMUM002, which follows an AT-III domain. In
pMUM001, the two domains seen in these positions are a
DH domain, with a predicted inactive catalytic site, and
an AT-I domain (Figure 3 and Figure 7). In no part of
mlsA1, mlsA2 or mlsB of pMUM001 or pMUM002 is an
inactive DH paired with an AT-III domain. As the DH and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/462

KR domains are functionally redundant within the LM,
this does not indicate a functional constraint imposed on
this pairing, but does suggest that the AT-III and DH
domains 'move' as a group. This may also be the case for
the ER and KR-A domains that always appear in modules
with the same domain organization. This is further highlighted by an intra-species comparison of the domain
structure of the load modules of MlsA and MlsB. Individual domains of both the MlsA and MlsB load modules of
pMUM002 are identical, with the exception of the AT-III
and active DH domains (Figure 7). The simplest explanation for the presence of these domains in otherwise identical sequences is introduction via recombination with the
same domain cluster from a neighbouring donor module.
Due to the high degree of sequence homology between
like domains, any of eight potential modules may have
been the donor for the introduced AT-III/DH domain pair
(see Figure 7).
To gauge the extent of mls sequence homology among different mycolactone-producing mycobacteria (MPM) we
took advantage of a single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) identified within the KS domain during sequencing
of pMUM002. Sequencing of the mls locus of pMUM002
revealed a HindIII restriction site in the KS domain of all
15 modules that comprise mlsA1, mlsA2 and mlsB. These
HindIII sites are at the same position within every KS
domain and are introduced by a synonymous C → T transition. Curiously, this polymorphism is not present in any
of the 16 KS domains of pMUM001. The presence of this
site within the KS domains of the mycolactone E PKS represented a convenient tool for screening other MPM. Oligonucleotides were designed to the 5' and 3' ends of the
KS domain and PCR was used to amplify all KS domains
present in a strain. Subsequent restriction digestion with
HindIII of the PCR product obtained from each MPM
revealed the presence of this polymorphism in all the KS
domains of the South American human MU strains and
animal (fish or frog) MPM, with the same profile as ML.
However this variation was absent from all the KS
domains of African and Australian MU strains, and
present in only a proportion of the KS domains from the
Japanese strain MU753 (Figure 8). One conclusion from
these data is that ongoing intra-strain domain replacement (gene conversion) is purifying the mls sequences
and resulting in the unusual pan-locus nucleotide homogeneity.

Discussion
We present here the first detailed description of two
recently discovered megaplasmids, harboured by mycolactone-producing mycobacteria isolated from frogs and
fish, named pMUM002 (190 kbp) and pMUM003 (~210
kbp) respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that both
replicons are highly related to pMUM001 from MU

Agy99, with the same overall architecture and at least half
their coding potential spanned by the three, large mls
genes that are required for mycolactone synthesis (Figure
2, Table 1).
Uncovering the genetic basis for the synthesis of mycolactone structural variants by MPM was a major objective of
this study. The complete sequence of pMUM002 permitted a thorough analysis of its mls locus and an examination of the concordance between module arrangement
and the structure of mycolactone E. There was perfect cor-

respondence between the domain and module arrangement for MlsB in pMUM002 and our earlier LC-MS/MS
structural predictions that included the presence of a propionate starter unit and only six extender modules (Figure
3). Further support for this structure was also obtained by
LC-MS/MS analysis of lipid extracts from two other ML
strains and observing the same ion trace and MS/MS fragmentation pattern. Similarly, analysis of a BAC clone that
spanned mlsB from pMUM003 confirmed mycolactone F
structure-based predictions on module and domain composition that included an AT-II (acetate) domain within

the load module and the absence of any A-type KR
domains; the latter observation explaining the switched
stereochemistry of the C11' and C13' side-chain hydroxyls
of mycolactone F [5]. Furthermore, the combination of
sequencing and LC-MS/MS analysis has shown conclusively that geographically and genetically close MU strains
from Japan and China produce different mycolactones
(Figure 6). Alternative mycolactone production in all of
these strains is due to the highly mutable nature of the
mycolactone PKS locus, facilitated by the high levels of
nucleotide identity amongst domains, and presumably
supporting homologous recombination.
Despite the very high inter-strain nucleotide identity, the
mls sequences from pMUM001 and pMUM002 form distinct phylogenetic clusters (Figure 7), a separation that
correlates with genetic comparisons based on chromosomal genes sequences that show MPM fall into two distinct lineages; the so-called ancestral lineage that includes
MPM predominantly infecting fish and frogs and the

modern lineage that includes most of the MPM that infect
humans [10]. The discrete strain-dependent clustering of
the pMUM001 and pMUM002 mls domains also suggests
that intra- and not inter-strain exchange of homologous
domain sequences is the mechanism that has generated
metabolite diversity. In fact, the most parsimonious
explanation for the mls domain and module clustering
patterns and the distribution of the HindIII polymorphism amongst MPM is the evolution of domains or modules in concert and mutations occurring in repeated
domains that then become fixed throughout the genes
due to gene conversion events [25]. It was originally suggested that the evolution of the multimodular structure of
the PKSs is due to repeated rounds of gene duplication
from a single ancestor module [26], a notion that has
been supported by phylogenetic analysis of KS domains
amongst streptomycetes and other PKS pathways [15,27].
Intragenic and intergenic recombination appears to have
generated diversity within other PKS clusters, such as the

and 8 of MlsA of pMUM002, which are most closely
related to their counterparts in pMUM001. It is also noteworthy that domain swapping occurs in pairs. The reasons
for this are unclear, but one possible explanation is that a
pair of adjacent domains provides more favourable conditions for homologous recombination than a single
domain.

Conclusion

microcystin PKS gene cluster of Microcystis sp. [28] and the
avermectin and rapamycin clusters of Streptomyces sp.
[29].
A major stumbling block for combinatorial polyketide
biochemistry for production of non-natural products has
been the apparent incompatibility of certain domain
combinations [30]. In this study we have shown that there
is considerable natural tolerance among the Mls domains
for a variety of polyketide precursors. For example, by
studying the genetic basis for naturally occurring mycolactone variants we have revealed that different AT domains
within starter units specify either acetate or propionate,
addition or deletion of modules accounts for altered
chain length, and the stereochemistry of hydroxyl groups
results from a replacement of KR domains, all in accord
with the modular PKS paradigm [13]. Furthermore, the
high identity among KS domains suggests that they must
accept different extender units and many varieties of
growing polyketide chain as substrates. In agreement with
this, a close comparison of mls sequences between
pMUM001 & pMUM002 shows that the subtle alterations
in KS sequence do not correlate with the type of substrate.
Also, domains or modules that perform the same synthesis reactions in different strains are not necessarily the
most closely related, again suggesting the KS domains are
permissive. For example, the KS domains of MlsA that
accept the same mycolactone core substrates in MU Agy99
and ML are not most closely related to each other, as
might be predicted if even small changes in the KS alter
function, but are more closely related to other KS domains
from that strain, which accept different substrates (Figure
7). Exceptions to this are the KS domains from modules 4

In this study DNA sequencing and comparative analysis of
pMUM megaplasmids have been used to document the
genetic differences in the toxin-coding DNA, and sophisticated mass spectrometry has been used to assign the differences in their chemical structure. The results confirm
predictions, and show that highly specific changes in the
modular polyketide synthase genes, akin to strategies used
in the laboratory to engineer production of altered
polyketide antibiotics, account for the differences. Given
their uniquely repetitive structure, the genes for these
assembly-line multienzymes appear to represent a natural
chemistry set that might be harnessed in different modular combinations to create novel polyketides as potential
drug leads. Comparative analysis of the repetitive gene
structure has also provided clues to the evolutionary
events, particularly recombination and gene conversion,
that continue to shape these remarkable systems.

Methods
Bacterial strains and culture conditions
M. liflandii strains 128FXT (ML), XL5 and HW1 were isolated from infected tropical clawed frogs (Xenopus tropicalis) at the University of California, Berkeley [31]. M.
marinum DL240490 (DL) was isolated from a European
Sea Bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) from the Red sea [32].
MU753 Japan was isolated in 2004 from a diagnosed case
of Buruli ulcer from a 37-year old Japanese female [33].
All mycobacterial strains were cultivated by using Middlebrook 7H9 broth or 7H10 agar (Difco) supplemented
with oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (Difco) at
30°C. E. coli DH10B (Invitrogen) was cultivated using
Luria Bertani broth or agar at 37°C.
Plasmid cloning, shotgun library construction and
sequencing
Prior to sequencing it was anticipated that plasmids from
ML and DL would be highly similar in structure to the previously sequenced MU plasmid, pMUM001. So as to
avoid confusion with future pMUM-like plasmid
sequences and to reflect their common origin, we therefore propose to continue the pMUM nomenclature for all
future sequenced mycolactone plasmids. Hence, we have
designated the plasmids in this study pMUM002 (from
ML) and pMUM003 (from DL). Two bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) libraries were prepared using the vector pIndigo-BAC5 (Epicentre) for ML and DL as described

previously [11]. The resulting E. coli DH10B chloramphenicol resistant clones were stored at -80°C in 96-well
format in Luria-Bertani broth containing 15% glycerol. To
identify BAC clones spanning pMUM DNA, the ML and
DL libraries were screened by PCR for two genes found
distal to each other on pMUM001, repA and MUP038
[11]. BAC clones PCR positive for either gene were then
further analysed by end-sequencing and restriction
enzyme digestion to construct an overlapping BAC scaffold of each plasmid from ML and DL. Four BAC clones
(06A07: 77 kb, 06D10: 110 kb, 07A09: 90 kb, 10A03: 15
kb) spanned all of pMUM002 and three BAC clones
spanned all of pMUM003 (04D12: 110 kb, 051B: 99 kb,
048F: 98 kb) (Figure 2). DNA from the BAC clones 06A07,
06D10 and 07A09 were sheared by hydrodynamic shearing (Genomic Solutions Hydroshear), size fractionated to
5 – 7 kb and cloned into the vector pSMART HC Kan
(Lucigen Corporation). The selected size of 5 – 7 kb overcome the egregiously repetitive nature of the locus and
allowed for the cloning of single PKS modules, the minimum non-repetitive PKS unit. Each subclone was endsequenced and subclones that represented a single PKS
module were subjected to complete sequencing by primer
walking. Due to its comparatively small size, BAC clone
10A03 was completely sequenced by primer walking.
Unlike BACs which overlapped the PKS region of
pMUM002, BAC clone 0412D contained a very limited
amount of PKS-encoding DNA and subcloning of this
BAC was performed by hydrodynamic shearing followed
by a random shotgun approach to clone 2 – 4 kb DNA
fragments into pSMART HC kan. Subclones of 0412D
were then end-sequenced.

the KR-B probe (cgagcatctggtttctgcccatggtgtccggc) recognised the nucleotide sequence specifying EHLVSAHGVR.
Oligonucleotide probes were labelled using the DIG oligonucleotide tailing kit (Roche). BAC clones A04 and D03
from pMUM001 (Figure 2) have previously been published [17].
Lipid extraction and analysis
Lipid fractions of ML were extracted and analysed for
mycolactones as previously described using a Finnigan
LCQ (Thermo Finnigan, USA) ion-trap mass spectrometer, coupled with a HP1100 liquid chromatography.
Mycolactones were eluted from a ThermoHypersil BDS C8
column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) with a gradient of 55 to
95% acetonitrile in water over 40 min [38,39].
