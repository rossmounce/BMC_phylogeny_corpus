Abstract
Background: Iron-sulfur clusters are ubiquitous and evolutionarily ancient inorganic prosthetic groups, the
biosynthesis of which depends on complex protein machineries. Three distinct assembly systems involved in the
maturation of cellular Fe-S proteins have been determined, designated the NIF, ISC and SUF systems. Although
well described in several organisms, these machineries are poorly understood in Gram-positive bacteria. Within
the Firmicutes phylum, the Enterococcus spp. genus have recently assumed importance in clinical microbiology being
considered as emerging pathogens for humans, wherein Enterococcus faecalis represents the major species
associated with nosocomial infections. The aim of this study was to carry out a phylogenetic analysis in
Enterococcus faecalis V583 and a structural and conformational characterisation of it SufU protein.
Results: BLAST searches of the Enterococcus genome revealed a series of genes with sequence similarity to the
Escherichia coli SUF machinery of [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis, namely sufB, sufC, sufD and SufS. In addition, the E.
coli IscU ortholog SufU was found to be the scaffold protein of Enterococcus spp., containing all features considered
essential for its biological activity, including conserved amino acid residues involved in substrate and/or co-factor
binding (Cys50,76,138 and Asp52) and, phylogenetic analyses showed a close relationship with orthologues from
other Gram-positive bacteria. Molecular dynamics for structural determinations and molecular modeling using E.
faecalis SufU primary sequence protein over the PDB:1su0 crystallographic model from Streptococcus pyogenes
were carried out with a subsequent 50 ns molecular dynamic trajectory. This presented a stable model, showing
secondary structure modifications near the active site and conserved cysteine residues. Molecular modeling using
Haemophilus influenzae IscU primary sequence over the PDB:1su0 crystal followed by a MD trajectory was
performed to analyse differences in the C-terminus region of Gram-positive SufU and Gram-negative orthologous
proteins, in which several modifications in secondary structure were observed.
Conclusion: The data describe the identification of the SUF machinery for [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis present in
the Firmicutes genome, showing conserved sufB, sufC, sufD and sufS genes and the presence of the sufU gene coding
for scaffold protein, instead of sufA; neither sufE nor sufR are present. Primary sequences and structural analysis
of the SufU protein demonstrated its structural-like pattern to the scaffold protein IscU nearby on the ISC
machinery. E. faecalis SufU molecular modeling showed high flexibility over the active site regions, and
demonstrated the existence of a specific region in Firmicutes denoting the Gram positive region (GPR), suggested
as a possible candidate for interaction with other factors and/or regulators.

Background
Iron-sulfur [Fe-S] clusters are simple inorganic prosthetic
groups that are widely distributed in nature and play
essential roles in diverse biological processes such as electron transfer, redox and nonredox catalysis, gene regulation and as sensors within all living organisms [1-4]. The
biosynthetic process by which defined proportions of iron
and sulfur atoms are mobilised and combined to generate
the various iron-sulfur prosthetic groups within polypeptide chains has been a matter of intensive research during
the last 10 years. The cluster components iron (ferrous or
ferric forms) and sulphide ions are unavailable in
cytosolic solutions due to their toxicity, making it unlikely
that [Fe-S] clusters are synthesised by apoproteins from
free cytosolic iron and sulphide elements, even though
this is a rather efficient process in vitro [5]. Therefore, the
functions of the [Fe-S] cluster assembly machineries
include the mobilisation of Fe2+/3+ and S2- elements from
their storage sources, their association into an [Fe-S]
bound form and its transport and transfer to the final
molecular destinations. Despite the apparent diversity in
the overall structure, reactivity, electronic properties and
molecular environments of [Fe-S] clusters, previous data
have demonstrated that [4Fe-4S] clusters, as well as clusters of even higher nuclearity, are chemically assembled
by the reductive coupling of [2Fe-2S] units [6-9].
The machinery of [Fe-S] biogenesis is represented by at
least three distinct, yet structurally and functionally
related systems, designated NIF, ISC, and SUF. The NIF
system, in addition to performing specialised functions in
nitrogen fixation and subsequent maturation of the nitrogenase enzyme, is formed by structural and regulatory
genes represented by around 20 genes [10,11]. The ISC
system for iron-sulfur cluster assembly probably represents the housekeeping system for [Fe-S] protein maturation in most living cells and is comprised of iscRSUAhscBA-fdx genes [12]. The SUF system performs its role in
sulfur assimilation, is comprised of sufABCDES genes and
occurs in numerous bacteria, in archaea, and in plant
chloroplasts [13,14].
All three operons contain genes that encode proteins with
similar biochemical activity [15]. Accordingly, NifU/IscU/
SufU scaffold proteins have characteristic primary
sequences, the NifU protein possessing the complete form
with 312 amino acid residues and 9 conserved cysteine
residues. NifU contains three domains denoted the N-terminal domain (3 conserved cysteines), the central
domain (4 conserved cysteines) and the C-terminal
domain (2 conserved cysteines). In addition, the N-terminal domain of NifU corresponds to IscU (120 amino
acids) and SufU (136 amino acids) proteins and appears
to be involved in the formation and delivery of a transient
[Fe-S] cluster [16]. A fourth conserved amino acid repre-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/10/3

sented by an aspartic residue located immediately after
the first conserved cysteine residue exhibits a critical role
in the [Fe-S] cluster delivery: its substitution substantially
stabilises the cluster, obstructing the donation of the cluster to the target protein [17].
In addition to the NifU/IscU/SufU scaffold proteins, the
cysteine desulfurase NifS/IscS/SufS proteins appear to
play essential roles in [Fe-S] cluster formation [18]. Such
proteins possess an active cysteine residue (Cys365),
involved in desulfuration of the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate
(PLP) cofactor and thus in donating the sulfur element to
the scaffold protein. Each NIF, ISC and SUF system has
particular genes, such as the heat shock determinants
(hscAB), the alternative scaffold protein IscA in the ISC
machinery and the cysteine desulfurase enhancer SufE in
the SUF system.
The SUF system has been linked to virulence in several
microorganisms, as in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, whose
pps1 gene codes for an orthologous SufB protein. It has
been established that Pps1 is a central element of the SUF
system, playing an essential role in M. tuberculosis survival
through its involvement in the bacterial resistance to iron
limitation and oxidative stress [19]. In Erwinia chrysanthemi, which causes soft-rot disease in a great variety of
plants, iron acquisition and resistance to oxidative stress
greatly contribute to its virulence, as sufA and sufC
mutants exhibit reduced ability to cause maceration of
leaves, while a functional sufC gene is required for the bacteria to cause systemic invasion [20]. Altogether, these
data point to the use of such a system as a possible molecular target for the development of bioactive compounds
able to modulate several biological processes. This
appears to be particularly important in Gram-positive
bacteria, considering the high virulence associated with
bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes phylum where only
the SUF system is present. A particularly important genus
belong from this phylum may be found in Enterococcus
spp., which comprises more than 20 species. Clinically,
enterococci have been identified as second agents responsible by nosocomial infections wherein Enterococcus faecalis species accounting for 80–90% of clinical isolates. [21].
Several crystal and NMR structures of proteins involved in
[Fe-S] cluster formation machinery have been described
for numerous organisms, such as IscA [22], SufA [23],
SufE [24], IscU [25] and SufU [26]. However, no structural
information has been available related to proteins present
in microorganisms belonging to the Firmicutes phyla. In
this context, we report here the in silico molecular analysis
of [Fe-S] cluster biosynthetic machinery in the Firmicutes
E. faecalis, as well as molecular modeling data of the scaffold proteins SufU from E. faecalis and IscU from S. pyogenes. Overall, the analysis identified putative structural

differences associated with Gram-negative (IscU protein)
and Gram-positive (SufU proteins) bacteria, supporting
structural and conformational differences in the participation of distinct machinery, which may ultimately be
related to original and selective therapeutic strategies.

Results and discussion
The [Fe-S] cluster assembly machinery in E. faecalis and its
conservative pattern in Gram-positive bacteria
Bioinformatics analysis of the E. faecalis V583 genome
[27] demonstrated the presence of a gene locus coding for
putative SUF proteins (Fig. 1A). ORFs possibly related to
[Fe-S] cluster biosynthetic machinery found in E. faecalis
are denoted as: EF2390, harbouring 37% identity with
SufB from E. coli; EF2391, encoding the putative scaffold
NifU-like protein, homologous to IscU, the N-terminal
module of NifU, which will be referred to in this work as
SufU (according to Johnson et al., 2005) [3]; EF2392, coding the cysteine desulfurase SufS protein, involved in
donation of the sulfur molecule to the [Fe-S] cluster formation; EF3293 and EF2394 encoding SufD and SufC
orthologue proteins, which presented 22% and 52% identity with the E. coli proteins, respectively. Once the phylogenetic analysis enabled the verification of high
conservation and similarity for the sufBUSDC operon
within Firmicutes phylum and, given E. faecalis clinical relevance, this work was performed having Gram-positive E.
faecalis V583 strain as our model of study.

NifU/IscU/SufU is considered key proteins of their respective [Fe-S] cluster assembly machineries in bacteria. The
IscU and SufU scaffold proteins show high homology
with the N-terminal part of NifU, preserving the three
conserved cysteines (Cys50,76,138) and aspartic residues

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/10/3

(Asp52) (Fig. 1B and 1C). These three cysteine residues are
proposed to be involved in the coordination of [Fe-S]
cluster assembly with one noncysteinyl ligation, and the
conserved aspartic residue exhibits a critical role in the
[Fe-S] cluster formation, as its substitution substantially
stabilizes the cluster, obstructing the donation of the cluster to the target protein. Moreover, IscU contains the conserved amino acid annotation LPPVK, which is related to
the interaction with the heat-shock like proteins HscA and
HscB, present only in such machinery [28]. E. faecalis
SufU does not contain the LPPVK annotation, but does
have an insertion of 19 amino acid residues between the
second and third conserved cysteine residues. The annotation of these 19 amino acids was found to correspond to
a specific signature for Gram-positive SufU-type proteins
and is thought to replace the annotation present in IscU,
since it is localised in a related region. Furthermore, the
same type of suf gene representations were identified in
several other members of Gram-positive bacteria, such as
microorganisms phylogenetically clustered within the
Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Bacillus and Listeria genera,
important microorganisms related to pathological processes, along with Lactococcus and Lactobacillus industrially
relevant microorganisms (additional file 1). In the bacterial phyla, the Gram-positive forms make up the phylum
Firmicutes, which includes many well-known genera such
as Bacillus, Listeria, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Clostridium. In fact, phylogenetic analyses of IscU
and SufU protein sequences suggested that SufU and IscU
proteins form well-defined clades (additional file 2).
Comparison between suf genes observed in Proteobacteria
and Firmicutes demonstrated several differences. SufE, for
example, is an important protein present in the Proteobac-

teria suf operon, but whose presence has not been demonstrated in Gram-positive genomes. This protein is able to
drastically stimulate the cysteine desulfurase activity of
SufS [29,30]. Another protein present in the E. coli operon
and absent in Gram-positive sequences is SufA, whose
function is to accept the sulfur transferred from the SufSSufE complex for transient [Fe-S] cluster formation. Furthermore, cyanobacteria were found to contain the sufR
gene, which encodes a protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor of the suf regulon [31], but it was not
found in the Firmicutes genomes. On the other hand,
Gram-positive genomes contained SufU as a scaffold protein, which is unusual in the Proteobacteria suf locus.
Finally, it can be assumed that four genes are present in
both Proteobacteria and Firmicutes genomes, i.e., sufB, sufC,
sufD and sufS. Interestingly, published data have always
linked the SUF machinery for [Fe-S] cluster formation
with cellular stress conditions, such as the presence of
reactive oxygen species (ROS), NO stress and iron starvation [20]. But at what point is the SUF machinery that is
involved in maturation of constitutive proteins related to
other mechanisms in such microorganisms, since it seems
to be the only protein factory present in E. faecalis as well
as in other Firmicutes genomes? This is an intriguing and
open question in this field, which needs biochemical and
structural data for better comprehension.
All data described until now have demonstrated an unusual pattern of gene presentation, especially given the odd
SUF-scaffold protein. Thus, we focused subsequent steps
of the study on further analysing SufU structure and folding, with the aim of identifying important regions and
comparing them to the patterns of [Fe-S] cluster-scaffold
proteins determined in Proteobacteria.

The structure and molecular modeling of the E. faecalis
SufU protein
Firmicutes SufU proteins exhibits a tertiary fold that is
composed of four α-helices, I to IV, which comprise
amino acids residues 8–19, 66–77, 84–97, and 105–141,
respectively, and a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet
with strands A to C comprising, respectively, residues 33–
37, 42–49, and 57–63 (Fig. 2). Helices III and VI form a
"coiled-coil" motif, and both helices are attached to one
side of the β-sheet with helix III being oriented parallel to
strand C. Helix IV is oriented approximately anti-parallel
to helix III. The remaining helices I, II, and V surround
helix III, with helix III buried in the protein's core [26].
The CATH protocol assigns SufU to the "a-b" "fold" class
having a "two-layer sandwich" architecture, and as "SufElike" in the class of a and b proteins in the SCOP classification [24].

In order to characterize the structure and conformation of
the SufU key protein observed in E. faecalis comparative
modeling was carried out [32] using the S. pyogenes
(PDB:1SU0) [24]. SufU was employed as a template as
due to its 43% of primary sequence similarity with the target. The quality of the so obtained model was checked
through Procheck, PSIPRED and VERIFY3D. The E. faecalis
SufU model maintained the tertiary fold as observed for S.
pyogenes.
Although containing most of the genes related to the SUF
system of Proteobacteria, Gram-positive bacteria also contained the scaffold protein with the active site conserved
residues and tridimensional structure resembling IscU
from the ISC system. Neither the primary composition
nor the three-dimensional structure seen in the scaffold

protein SufU matches SufA, the scaffold-function protein
found in the E. coli SUF system, but it does match the Proteobacteria IscU structure [25]. The active site (Fig. 2D)
contains all three conserved Cys and Asp residues that
allow the formation of the transient [2Fe-2S] cluster for
posterior delivery to target proteins, as verified in SufU.
The union of two subunits of this protein to form a
homodimer, with the reduction of two [2Fe-2S]2+ to form
a [4Fe-4S] cluster, is feasible [34]. Thus, SufU follows not
only the IscU folding pattern but also has flexibility in the
active site, which tends to be the region with the biggest
structural alterations, and which enables the cluster formation, reduction, and monomer/homodimer alterations
in the protein.
As already described, any sequence matching of the SufE
primary structure was obtained in E. faecalis genome analysis. However, according to Liu et al. (2005) [26],
although sharing < 10% sequence identity, the similarity
of the three-dimensional structure suggests that IscU/SufU
and SufE are homologous desulfurase enhancers. Thus,
SufU could be the molecule responsible for scaffold and
desulfurase enhancer actions in Gram-positive SUF
machinery. In Proteobacteria, this function is exerted by
two different molecules, namely SufA and SufE.
As reported [34,35], crystallographic structures may retain
non-biological conformations as due to forces occurring
in the crystal environment. By employing such structures
in comparative modeling these conformational events
associated with crystal packing may be transported to the
model, potentially compromising the analysis of the
obtained structures. One strategy capable to circumvent
such effects, complementing the crystallographic information upon addition of solvent components and molecules
flexibility, may be found in molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. Indeed, such strategy has already been
employed with success to refine comparative models of
proteins, allowing the observation of modifications on
secondary structure elements of the interest protein
towards the NMR observed structure [32,36,37]. So, the
obtained model was further refined through MD simulations and, to trace possible crystal packing effects, the template S. pyogenes SufU was also simulated in the same
conditions.
Molecular dynamics (MD) experiments with crystal data
obtained from the Firmicutes S. pyogenes were performed
in order to analyse the structural pattern of SufU under
physiological conditions and remove possible crystal
effects on the structure. MD results showed consistent
changes in the secondary structure of S. pyogenes SufU
after 50 ns of trajectory. Changes were verified both over
the four α-helices, comprising residues 4–14, 62–74, 80–
92, 118–133 (I to IV, respectively) and over the three β-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/10/3

sheets, comprising residues 28–32, 37–44 and 48–56 (A
to C, respectively). Both E. faecalis and S. pyogenes are Firmicutes members, and thus are phylogenetically closely
related. Therefore, the SufU proteins from the two microorganisms are expected to be very similar.
SufU molecular dynamics data analysis
In order to monitor the progress of structural conformational changes in both SufU MD, and check flexibility
indices and conformational changes, we evaluated the
root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the simulated proteins. Considering the entire protein, both S. pyogenes and
E. faecalis SufU molecules presented similar behaviors,
achieving a plateau around 0.45 nm (Fig. 3A). Such
increase in protein flexibility appears to be related to the
N-(residues 1 to 38) and C-terminal (residues 95 to 136)
portions, which may achieve a 0.6 nm deviation from initial conformations (Fig. 3B and 3C). While the degree of
conformational modification in S. pyogenes SufU points to
a role of the crystal environment in protein stabilization,
it also indicates a different pattern of folding and/or flexibility around an insertion of 19 amino acids present only
in Gram-positive bacteria, responsible for a ~0.1 nm
increase in C-terminal RMSD for E. faecalis after 20 ns,
approximately (Fig. 3C).

The influence of crystal environment on SufU conformation may be observed in the protein secondary structure
content (Fig. 2). While the crystallographic structure
shows an additional α-helix between helixes III and IV,
including residues 105–120, such structural element is
not retained on MD simulations, unfolding together with
the S. pyogenes GPR region (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the
E. faecalis SufU do not only stabilize this helix, between
residues 105 and 120, but also retain a GPR conformation
close to that observed in S. pyogenes crystal structure. In
fact, a series of crystal contacts is observed in such structure, interactions capable to retain the α-helical conformation in this sequence. Being such region conserved
between the two proteins, it becomes evident the relevance of the whole protein three-dimensional organization in order to further stabilize and determine the
conformational preference of this region.
While the data presented in RMSD plots gives a global perspective of the protein conformational modifications over
the MD trajectory, it lacks resolution at a residue level. So,
in order to gain further insights into the conformational
behavior of the simulated proteins, we employed a strategy that describes the structural fluctuation of a protein
structure as a function of both time and residue number
[36-38]. Such root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) analysis confirmed the role of both N-terminal and GPR in
SufU flexibility (Fig. 4B and 4C). These fluctuations may
be observed in a sausage plot (Fig. 4A and 4D).

red).

E. faecalis SufU showed alterations in the GPR, but in a
lesser degree than in S. pyogenes SufU. Areas related to the
active sites of SufU showed higher flexibility too, especially the ones related to residues Cys35, Asp37 and Cys60,
and areas between residues 20 to 25, and 40 to 45.
Although the amino acid residues in these parts aren't
involved in the active site for [Fe-S] cluster formation,
these areas circumvent those residues, once flexibility
required for cluster formation is related to the active site
of the protein, and modifications established in these
regions are essential for enzyme activity.
Comparison of Gram-negative IscU and Gram-positive
SufU scaffold proteins
The structural differences between IscU/SufU proteins
from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are not
limited to the GPR region. Also, the N-terminal of such

molecules presents differences in both size and sequence
(Fig. 1), which is consequently related to the conformation of this sequence. In fact, the analysis of IscU and SufU
structures from several organisms (presented in PDB),
such as from Mus musculus (PDB:1WFZ), from H. influenzae (PDB:1R9P), and from Bacillus subtilis (PDB:2AZH)
support the observation that the N-terminal portion of
IscU (verified in both M. musculus and H. influenzae), is
mostly unfolded in comparison to an α-helix in the N-terminal part of both Gram-positive B. subtilis SufU (resolved
by NMR) and S. pyogenes SufU (resolved by crystallography). However, the structural basis for such difference in
folding between the two classes of bacteria is not reported.
So, we performed an H. influenzae IscU molecular modeling experiment using the crystallographic structure of S.
pyogenes SufU as the template, further refined through MD
simulations.

The MD of H. influenzae model, retaining a Gram-positive
folding demonstrated an unstable conformation, with a
progressive unfolding of both N- and C-terminal regions.
Such conformational modification was also observed in
the radius of gyration, indicating that the Gram-positive
folding pattern is not stable in a Gram-negative sequence.
Most important, it indicates that these two bacteria proteins indeed present distinct folding in accordance with
the topology verified in NMR for IscU.
According to RMSF plots, proteins high flexibility similarities were observed in areas comprising mainly the active
sites, the area circumventing them and regions which correspond to the GPR and LPPVK in Gram-negative bacteria.
As observed in the phylogenetic analysis, Firmicutes SufU
protein and its orthologues in Proteobacteria (Azotobacter
vinelandii), Gamaproteobacteria (H. influenzae) and Eucaryota (M. musculus) were clustered in well-defined separated
groups. Unlike in the SUF system, the ISC system assembles several other factors which interact directly with the
IscU scaffold protein. For example, Hsc66 (HscA) and
Hsc20 (HscB) correspond to a specialised chaperone system that selectively binds the [Fe-S] cluster template protein IscU, in which HscA interacts with the LPPVK
(residues 99–103) conserved signature [39], stimulating
the rate of cluster transfer through an ATP-dependent
process by more than 20-fold [40]. SufU does not contain
this LPPVK region, which is in accordance with the
absence of HscA and HscB genes from the Gram-positive
operon.
As discussed above, the SufU crystal and molecular
dynamic trajectory structural analysis enabled the identi-

fication of a region between the second and third residue
of the conserved cysteines. This region is located between
helices III and IV, with a loop pattern in the S. pyogenes
SufU, indicating the possible helix-turn-helix motif. The
same region is found in several Gram-positive microorganisms, always related to the scaffold protein for [Fe-S]
clusters formation, and presenting the pattern of 19
amino acid residues, with the conserved signature xxFSxxxQGxExxxxLG. This region is apparently susceptible to
induced folding upon interaction with target proteins,
which MD is capable of refining. Since the conserved residues of this region do not include all of the nineteen residues, and as there are several differences between the
non-conserved residues, which could stabilise the helix,
the differences in the secondary structure are understandable; nevertheless, conserved residues showed similar
flexibility in both SufU RMSF plots.
Considering the structural similarity of both SufU and
IscU proteins, molecular modeling of IscU, with posterior
dynamics trajectories, enabled us to demonstrate high
fluctuation data over the region near the conservative signature LPPVK, which is topologically situated in the same
area as the 7 conservative residues in the region of nineteen residues that is only present in Gram-positive bacteria SufU. The GPR region presents itself inside proteins
related to scaffold proteins for the [Fe-S] cluster. In addition, the fact that it is a helix-turn-helix domain located
between helices III and IV categorises it as a possible protein interaction region. Furthermore, it is possible that
GPR is present in SufU: there may be a new factor, not yet
characterised, that is present in the Firmicutes phylum that
could interact with the SufBCD complex and stimulate
[Fe-S] cluster assembly and/or transfer to target proteins,

given that ATPase activity has already been demonstrated
in SufC and has already been characterised for HscA/HscB
and IscU of Gram negative bacteria. This hypothesis is reasonable since GPR is located in the same position of the
LPPVK conserved signature. To elucidate this further, we
are carrying out more experiments to analyse the interaction between SufU and the SufU-mutant and GPR with
SufS and/or SufBCD, and the capacity of the complex to
assembly and/or release the [Fe-S] cluster cofactor.

Conclusion
The biological formation of iron-sulfur [FeS] clusters
involves the presence of specific biosynthetic machineries
and subsequent insertion into specific target proteins. Several [Fe-S] protein machineries have been described in
bacteria, in which each (namely NIF, ISC or SUF) presenting specific characteristics. Until now, most of these studies have been performed with E. coli and other model
bacteria and few studies have considered the [Fe-S] cluster
machinery from Firmicutes phyla and the Gram-positive
bacteria. As well, a small number of studies had been dedicated to the structural and conformational characterization of [Fe-S] cluster machinery individual elements in
relation to its specific functions.
So, in order to contribute to fulfill this lack of information
the current work demonstrate that SUF appears to be the
only machinery involved in [Fe-S] cluster assembly and/or
repair system both in enterococci and in other related genera inside the Gram-positive bacteria, whereas includes
one ISC element (IscU orthologue) named SufU. The SUF
orthologous proteins include SufC, SufD, SufS and SufB.
Other genes from E. coli SUF machinery, such as SufR,
SufE and SufA, were not observed in enterococci. Considering the importance of scaffold proteins in the [Fe-S]
cluster biosynthetic machinery, the SufU component was
further characterized by means of comparative modeling
and molecular dynamics simulations in order to obtain
further insights concerning the relation between its structure and conformation and biological function, employing as SufU model protein for S. pyogenes and for E. faecalis
elements. Such analysis had pointed a high flexibility in
residues in the active site and mainly adjacent structural
elements (residues 20–40, 53–55, 58–60), as well as in a
turn between residues 95–115, which is conserved in this
type of protein and in Firmicutes.
The [Fe-S] cluster formation strategy raises a number of
intriguing and still unanswered questions, especially
regarding the mechanism of Fe and S mobilisation and
assembly within the protein machineries, and also the
possible specialisation of these machineries in terms of
the type of cluster they can produce, and the control of the
target protein transfer step, which probably involves protein-protein interactions. Further studies involving MD

data would be attractive in order to both visualise possible
structural alterations and to attempt to copy, in silico, the
biochemical data of the desulfuration process and sulfur
delivery from the SufS to the SufU active site, through
docking experiments and molecular dynamic refinement,
taking into consideration the SufU high flexibility regions
here described. In addition, biochemical data aimed at
cloning, expression and purification of key SUF machinery proteins will corroborate descriptions of the [Fe-S]
cluster biosynthetic pathway in E. faecalis, and elucidate
this process in several other Gram-positive bacteria, as
well as provide insights on its use as a possible molecular
target for development of selective therapeutic strategies.

Methods
The E. faecalis V583 genome sequence used in this study is
available at the Genbank website http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/Genbank.
Sequence homology search
Searches for protein orthologues in different genomes
were performed using the genomic BLAST (tblastn) program at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast
and the DOE JOINT Genome Institute http://
www.jgi.doe.gov.
EBI-EMBL
ClustalW
http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw allowed multiple alignment and
analysis of consensus sequences and conserved residues
(all proteins coded in the three main machineries of [FeS] cluster biosynthesis were screened and the conserved
residues were analysed according to their primary
sequence). All simulations were performed using the
GROMACS simulation suite and GROMOS96 force field
[41,42]. The Swiss-PDB Viewer http://spdbv.vital-it.ch/
[43], DSSP [44], and PROCHECK programs were used in
protein
analyses,
while
PyMOL
http://
www.pymol.org[45] was used for molecule visualisation.
Molecular Modeling
Comparative modeling using SwissModel was carried out
on E. faecalis genomic sequence employing S. pyogenes
SufU structure as template (PDB code 1SU0). Further
refinement of E. faecalis model was performed by means
of MD simulations (see further) [33].
MD simulations
Each protein, in its monomeric states, was solvated in a
dodecahedron box using periodic boundary conditions
and the SPC water model [46]. Counter ions were added
to neutralise the systems. The MD protocol was based on
previous MD studies [38]. Briefly, each system was submitted to energy minimization using the Steepest
Descents algorithm. Temperature and pressure were kept
constant by coupling protein, ions, and solvent to external
temperature and pressure baths, with coupling constants

of τ = 0.1 and 0.5 ps, respectively. The dielectric constant
was treated as ε = 1, and the reference temperature was
adjusted to 310 K. The systems were slowly heated from
50 to 310 K, in steps of 5 ps, each one increasing the reference temperature by 50 K. The total time of SufU simulation was 50 ns.
