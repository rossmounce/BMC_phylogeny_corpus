Abstract
Background: The SLC11A1/Nramp1 and SLC11A2/Nramp2 genes belong to the SLC11/Nramp family of
transmembrane divalent metal transporters, with SLC11A1 being associated with resistance to pathogens and
SLC11A2 involved in intestinal iron uptake and transferrin-bound iron transport. Both members of the SLC11 gene
family have been clearly identified in tetrapods; however SLC11A1 has never been documented in teleost fish and
is believed to have been lost in this lineage during early vertebrate evolution. In the present work we characterized
the SLC11 genes in teleosts and evaluated if the roles attributed to mammalian SLC11 genes are assured by other
fish specific SLC11 gene members.
Results: Two different SLC11 genes were isolated in the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus. labrax), and named
slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b, since both were found to be evolutionary closer to tetrapods SLC11A2, through
phylogenetic analysis and comparative genomics. Induction of slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b in sea bass, upon iron
modulation or exposure to Photobacterium damselae spp. piscicida, was evaluated in in vivo or in vitro experimental
models. Overall, slc11a2-a was found to respond only to iron deficiency in the intestine, whereas slc11a2-b was
found to respond to iron overload and bacterial infection in several tissues and also in the leukocytes.
Conclusions: Our data suggests that despite the absence of slc11a1, its functions have been undertaken by one of
the slc11a2 duplicated paralogs in teleost fish in a case of synfunctionalization, being involved in both iron
metabolism and response to bacterial infection. This study provides, to our knowledge, the first example of this
type of sub-functionalization in iron metabolism genes, illustrating how conserving the various functions of the
SLC11 gene family is of crucial evolutionary importance.

Background
The solute carrier family 11 (SLC11) is a gene family of
divalent metal transporters, composed by two functional
paralogs, SLC11A1 and SLC11A2. The first member of the
SLC11 family, SLC11A1, also known as the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (NRAMP1), is a
divalent cation/proton transporter, which has been proposed to function as either a symporter [1,2] or an antiporter [3,4]. Its expression is almost exclusively restricted
to the membrane of late endosomes and lysosomes of
immune cells of myeloid lineages (neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells) [5,6] and to neuronal cells [7].
SLC11A1 was first found to play a crucial role in the

defense against several unrelated pathogens in mice, such
as Mycobacteria, Leishmania and Salmonella [8-10], and
several studies have shown that polymorphisms in
SLC11A1 are involved in many infectious [11-15] and
autoimmune [16-20] diseases in humans. However, the
resistance mechanisms attributed to SLC11A1 are still not
fully understood [21,22].
The second member of the SLC11 family, SLC11A2, is
also referred to as natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 2 (NRAMP2), divalent cation transporter 1
(DCT1) or divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). SLC11A2
is a divalent cation/proton symporter [23], with a ubiquitous expression [24-26]. It is known to take up iron from
the intestinal brush border in mammals and has been
linked to transferrin-dependent iron transport from acidified endosomes to the cytosol in many different tissues
[1,23,25]. Polymorphisms in SLC11A2 are known to

underline microcytic anemia in mice and rats, resulting
from an impairment of iron recycling and intestinal
absorption [27,28].
SLC11 homologs have been found in many distant evolutionarily related groups, such as humans [29,30], mice
[9,24], rats [23], birds [31], fishes [32-36], insects [37],
nematodes [38], plants [39], yeast [40] and even bacteria
[41]. Complete slc11 mRNA coding sequences for teleost
fishes have been published in the last few years. Single
genes were described in carp (Cyprinus carpio) [42],
channel catfish (Ictalarus punctatus) [43], zebrafish
(Danio rerio) [44], striped bass (Morone saxatilis) [32],
Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) [33], turbot
(Scophthalmus maximus) [35] and red sea bream (Pagrus
major) [34], while two copies have been described in
rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) [45] and fugu
(Takifugu rubripes) [36], with evidence from other teleosts available in various genome databases.
Most animal studies, particularly in teleost fishes, are
focused on gene isolation and constitutive expression
analysis, with little information on evolutionary and functional aspects. Furthermore, a complex picture emerges
from the comparison of phylogenetic and expression studies between fishes and mammals [36]. In fact, little is
known about the structure and function of SLC11 in
lower vertebrates, although some studies provide evidence for a role of teleost Slc11a2 orthologs in the nutritive metal uptake in the intestine [46,47], and also an
involvement in the response to bacterial infection. It has
been shown that slc11 mRNA levels are elevated in
response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Edwardsiella
ictaluri [43,48] in channel catfish, to Vibrio angillarum
in turbot [35] and red sea bream [34] and to Mycobacterium in striped bass [32]. However no research has yet
elucidated this complex pattern of phylogenetic relationships and functional roles of teleost and mammalian
SLC11 genes and no explanations are provided as to why
it seems that a homolog of the mammalian SLC11A2 is
performing the functions attributed to SLC11A1.
A complement of two SLC11 genes is shared between
mammals and teleosts. Whilst it is known that mammalian SLC11A1 and SLC11A2 have likely resulted from genome duplications in early vertebrate ancestry (2R)
[36,49,50], the potential role of the teleost fish-specific
genome duplication (3R) [51,52] in the evolutionary history of this gene family has not been considered. A comprehensive synteny study could thus help to improve our
understanding of the evolution and functional specialization of these genes in teleost fish.
European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) was selected
as the teleost model for this study due to the growing
amount of data on its immune system [53], the possibility
of making use of its partially sequenced genome [54,55]
and our previous experience with sea bass models of

infection and iron modulation [56-59]. Sea bass is also an
important marine aquaculture species in Europe, afflicted
by several diseases such as pasteurellosis and vibriosis.
Since the early 1980s, its production has risen considerably [60] evolving from extensive culture units to semiintensive or intensive systems. This massive fish concentration leads to an increase in organismal stress and as a
consequence fish defenses get compromised, making
them more susceptible to pathogen attack. Isolation and
characterization of the slc11 gene(s) in sea bass, as a candidate gene(s) for host defense to infection with pathogens, may be of great benefit to better understand its role
in the immune system and to the selection of disease
resistant stocks [61]. Moreover, sea bass is part of the
Acanthopterygii superorder, which includes stickleback,
tetraodon and fugu, organisms that have their genome
fully sequenced, making possible a number of comparative genetic studies.
The aims of this study were to identify and characterize
the sea bass SLC11 homologs, clarify their evolutionary
history and to determine their functional roles, in particular those related with the host iron metabolism and resistance to infection. We evaluated the modulation of SLC11
gene(s) expression in sea bass upon iron modulation (iron
deficiency and overload) or exposure to Photobacterium
damselae spp. piscicida, in in vivo or in vitro experimental
models. We expect that this approach should provide an
insight on the evolutionary history of the SLC11 genes in
the vertebrata subphylum.

Results
Southern Blot

In order to determine the number of copies of slc11 genes
in the sea bass genome, a southern blot analysis was performed (Figure 1). After independent digestion of 10 μg of
genomic DNA with EcoRI or HindII and hybridization
with a slc11 DIG-labeled probe, different hybridization
bands were visible. No uncut products were observed.
Whether digested with EcoRI or HindII, two different
hybridization bands were visible, suggesting the existence
of two copies of the slc11 genes in the sea bass genome.
Sea bass slc11 transcripts

Five different sea bass slc11 transcripts were obtained by
primer walking and 5’/3’ RACE with liver, spleen and
intestine cDNA and analysis of whole-genome shotgun
contigs (Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics).
One transcript was named slc11a2-a and the other
four transcripts were named slc11a2-b1 to b4, since
they were found to share 1557 bp of their coding region
(out of a total of 1665 bp for b1/b2 or 1689 bp for b3/
b4), with the differences between them limited to the 5’
and 3’ endings (Table 1, Figure 2 and Additional File 1,
Figure S1).

Genomic Organization

Figure 1 Southern blot analysis. 10 μg of genomic DNA were
independently digested with EcoRI or HindII and hybridized with a
DIG-labelled slc11 RNA probe. Molecular weights (bp) are indicated
in the left margin.

Slc11a2-b1 and slc11a2-b2 transcripts are of the same
length regarding the coding region, although they differ
in the first 34 bp, since they result from the alternative
usage of either exon 1A (b1) or exon 1B (b2), both with
34 bp. They also have in common the final exon (exon
15), and the same 3’ UTR (Table 1, Figure 2 Additional
File 1, Figure S1). Slc11a2-b3 and slc11a2-b4 transcripts
are also of the same length and also differ in the first 34
bp, due to alternative usage of either exon 1A (b3) or
exon 1B (b4). Both are slightly larger than slc11a2-b1
and slc11a2-b2, since exon 15 presents an alternative
splice site, losing the final 54 bp (out of 108 bp) and
being partially substituted by the 78 bp of exon 16
(Table 1, Figure 2 and Additional File 1, Figure S1).
Slc11a2-b3 and slc11a2-b4 also share the same 3’ UTR,
albeit different and smaller than the 3’ UTR for slc11a2b1 and slc11a2-b2 (Table 1, Figure 2 and Additional
File 1, Figure S1).

The genomic organization of sea bass slc11a2-a and
slc11a2-b was analyzed and compared with those of
other fishes, amphibians and mammals (see Additional
File 2, Figure S2). Exon/intron boundaries were determined by comparison of cDNA, genomic DNA and
putative amino acid sequences, splice-site consensus
matching and analysis of whole-genome shotgun contigs
(Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics).
Comparison of genomic DNA sequences with the previously obtained cDNA sequences showed that slc11a2a consists of 15 exons and 14 introns, with a single
initiator methionine and stop codon. The genomic interval from the initiator methionine to the stop codon is
7842 bp. Comparison of genomic DNA sequences with
the cDNA sequences of the four slc11a2-b transcripts
showed that those four transcripts result not from four
different slc11a2-b genes, but rather from the alternative
splicing of two 5’ exons and two 3’ exons of a single
slc11a2-b gene (as already suggested by the southern
blot results), similar to what happens with human
SLC11A2 [62,63]. The slc11a2-b gene comprises a total
of 17 exons, with two initiator methionines and two
stop codons. Differences in the 5’-termini are generated
by alternative promoters with subsequent, mutually
exclusive splicing of the respective first exons to exon 2,
whereas differences in the 3’-termini are due to alternative splicing of exon 15, which presents an alternative 5’
donor site (corroborated using Alternative Splice Site
Predictor [64,65]). In two isoforms, this leads to the
reading of exon 15 and in the other two isoforms to the
partial reading of exon 15 and also exon 16 (Figure 2).
The genomic interval from the first initiator methionine
in exon 1A to the second stop codon in exon 16 is
10543 bp.
For both a and b genes, exons 2-14 present a high
homology with the equivalent exons from other fish and
mammals, whereas exons in the N- and C-terminus are
variable in size and sequence. Intron sizes, much like in
fugu and tetraodon, are reduced when compared with
mammalian homologs. Sea bass slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b
present a compaction factor of 1.8× and 1.4× to human
SLC11A1 and 4.6× and 3.4× to human SLC11A2,
respectively.

Figure 2 Schematic representation of slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b transcripts and putative proteins. Slc11a2-a produces a single transcript,
encoding a 560 aa protein. Slc11a2-b produces 4 transcripts, encoding 4 putative proteins, 2 of 554 aa (b1 and b2, from exons 1A or 1B to exon
15, respectively) and 2 of 562 aa (b3 and b4, from exons 1A or 1B to exon 16, respectively). Difference in size results from an alternative splice
site in exon 15 and replacement of its final 17 aa for 25 aa encoded by exon 16. Exons are represented as black boxes, UTRs as white boxes.

No clear sequences matching the iron responsive element (IRE) motifs, commonly found in mammalian
SLC11A2, were identified in any of the 3’ regions of
either slc11a2-a or slc11a2-b. However, one IRE motif
was found in the 5’ region of slc11a2-b (5’-UGUCUGUGUCAGAGAACAUGGUG-3’), with an upstream distance to the start codon of 508 bp, using RegRNA
[66,67] and corroborated manually.
Full-length genomic sequences of sea bass slc11a2-a
and slc11a2-b were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers HQ451945 (slc11a2-a) and HQ451946
(slc11a2-b).
Structure analysis of sea bass Slc11 putative proteins

To predict the functionality of sea bass Slc11 putative
proteins, we compared them with other known SLC11
proteins, and analyzed them using several bioinformatics
tools (listed at ExPASy [68]), searching for characteristic
features of this protein family.
The complete open reading frame of sea bass slc11a2-a
comprises a single transcript of 1683 nucleotides, encoding
a putative protein of 560 residues (Figure 2 and Additional
File 1, Figure S1), with a predicted molecular mass of 61.6
kDa. The complete open reading frame of sea bass
slc11a2-b comprises 4 different transcripts, encoding 4

putative proteins (Figure 2 and Additional File 1, Figure
S1) that result from the alternative usage of two 5’ exons
encoding distinct N-termini and the alternative splicing of
two 3’ exons encoding distinct C-termini of the proteins.
Two transcripts of 1665 nucleotides, named slc11a2-b1
(from exon 1A to exon 15) and slc11a2-b2 (from exon 1B
to exon 15), and two transcripts of 1689 nucleotides,
named slc11a2-b3 (from exon 1A to exon 16) and
slc11a2-b4 (from exon 1B to exon 16), encode putative
proteins of 554 and 562 residues, with predicted molecular
masses of 61.2 and 62.2 kDa, respectively.
The 8 amino acid discrepancy in length results not from
the substitution of exon 15 for exon 16, but rather from
an alternative splice site in exon 15. Only the final 17
amino acids encoded by exon 15 (out of 35) are replaced
by the 25 amino acids encoded by exon 16 (figure 2). Both
exon 1A and exon 1B have the same size and encode the
same number of amino acids.
Comparison with other teleost and mammalian species
SLC11 proteins showed that the signature features of
the SLC11 family [36,42,45,69] can also be found in the
sea bass (Figure 3 and Additional File 1, Figure S1):
twelve putative transmembrane domains (TMD), a conserved transport motif (between TMD8 and TMD9),
cysteine residues in loops 2, 5 and 7. Other motifs

observed in previously described SLC11 proteins, including some exclusive to teleost fish, are also present in sea
bass. Two N-linked glycosylation sites (N-X-S/T-X),
located in loop 7, are present in all Slc11a2-b forms, but
only one is present in Slc11a2-a loop 7, with another

located in the C terminus. A conserved protein kinase C
phosphorylation site (S/T-X-R/K) was also found immediately before TMD1, and one other was only found to
be shared by sea bass Slc11a2-a and fugu Slc11a-a, in
loop 3. A third protein kinase C phosphorylation site

Neves et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:106
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/106

was found to be present in the 5’ cytoplasmatic extremity of sea bass Slc11a2-b2 and Slc11a2-b4, striped bass
Slc11, fugu Slc11a2-a and trout Slc11a2-a and b. Six,
five and four casein kinase II phosphorylation sites (S/
T-XX-D/E) were found in Slc11a2-b(3,4), Slc11a2-b(1,2)
and Slc11a2-a, respectively. One tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site (R/K-XX(or XXX)-D/E-XX(or XXX)-Y)
in loop 6 was found to be conserved in teleosts, with
the exception of fugu Slc11a-a. One tyrosine based sorting signal (NPXY or YXXF; where F is a bulky hydrophobic residue) in the N terminus was also found to be
conserved in teleosts, with the exception of the alpha
forms of trout, sea bass and fugu. Several N-myristoylation sites (G-{EDRKHPFYW}-XX-[STAGCN]-{P}) were
also found to be conserved among all Slc11a2-b forms
(data not shown), but one site was only found to be present in the 3’ cytoplasmatic extremity of sea bass
Slc11a1-b(1,2), as well as striped bass Slc11 and Rainbow trout Slc11a2-b (figure 3). All phylogenetic analysis,
performed with the maximum-likelihood, maximumparsimony, neighbor-joining and Bayesian inference
methods were found to be consensual, placing sea bass
Slc11a2-b clustered with other fishes Slc11a2-b and
Slc11 (Figure 4 and Additional File 3, Figure S3) and sea
bass Slc11a2-a clustered with other fishes Slc11a2-a,
with the exception of trout Slc11a2-a. As with all other
teleost fish Slc11 homologs described so far, sea bass
Slc11 homologs are also closer to mammalian SLC11A2
than to SLC11A1.
Paralogy and synteny

To determine the evolutionary history of the SLC11
gene family in vertebrates, we explored in detail the
genomic “context” of both human SLC11A1 and
SLC11A2 paralogs. Other authors [36] have previously
suggested that SLC11A1 and SLC11A2 genes might
have originated from the duplications of the genome
in vertebrate ancestry, the so-called 2R, given their
location to the Hox chromosomes in Hsa2 and Hsa12
(Figure 5 A). We find strong support for this hypothesis. Within a 1Mb window in the vicinity of the
SLC11A1 and SLC11A2 genes, various gene families
have paralog members mapping to expected Hox chromosome regions. That is the case of TMBIM1, which
maps close to the SLC11A1 paralog in Hsa2, while
FAIM2 maps to Hsa12. TNS1 maps to the left end of
the window of the SLC11A1 gene, and has paralogs
mapping to the three other human Hox genome locations. In the case of the SLC11A2 gene, 6 gene families
show a consistent duplication pattern, with paralogs
mapping to expected regions of Hox-linked paralogy,
namely Hsa2q (Figure 5 A).
In the analysed teleosts a similar SLC11 gene complement is also found (with the exception of D. rerio).

Page 6 of 23

However, the precise orthology/paralogy relationships to
the mammalian counterparts are yet to be firmly established. While the phylogeny clearly indicates that both
fish genes strongly group with tetrapod SLC11A2
(Figure 4 Additional File 3, Figure S3), other features
(e.g. subcellular localization) make the orthology assignment more contentious [36]. Syntenic data can be a
powerful tool to facilitate the finding of orthologs and
in the identification of duplication processes [70]. The
abundance of genome data from teleosts allows us the
use of mapping data to clarify the phylogenetic findings.
We have analysed the genome locations and gene environment of the teleost SLC11 genes in zebrafish (Danio
rerio), fugu (Takifugu rubripes), tetraodon (Tetraodon
nigroviridis), medaka (Oryzias latipes) and stickleback
(Gasterosteus aculeatus) (Figure 5 B). We find a strong
degree of conservation between the gene arrangements
of various fish species. The vicinity of the teleost SLC11
loci have their human ortholog equivalents mapping to
the SLC11A2 chromosome, Hsa12q. Thus, we conclude
that in agreement with the phylogenetic data, the genomic location of the teleost genes indicates that they are
both SLC11A2-like. Furthermore, we observe that the
mechanistic origin of the SLC11 genes is likely linked to
the fish 3R genome duplication [71]. We find in the
vicinity of both fish isoforms, gene families with duplicates mapping to both SLC11 fish chromosomal regions.
For example, we noticed that AGAP2 gene family in
medaka has one member mapping to chromosome 7
(along with one of the SLC11 isoforms), while a second
isoform maps in chromosome 5 with the second isoform
of teleost SLC11. The phylogenies of the genes families
with duplicated members show that the duplication timing dates back to the origin of the teleosts (Additional
File 4, Figure S4). Thus, we can safely conclude that the
teleost genes are of the SLC11A2 type (which we name
slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b), and resulted from the fish
specific genome duplication.
Constitutive expression of slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b in sea
bass tissues

To gain some insight into sea bass slc11 basic functions, mRNAs constitutive expression of both forms
was determined in relevant tissues. Constitutive
expressions of slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b (all 4 isoforms)
were evaluated by real-time PCR in several tissues,
namely liver, spleen, head/trunk kidney, gill, brain, stomach, pyloric ceca, anterior/mid/posterior sections of
the intestine and rectum (Figure 6). The liver was
found to be the organ with the highest overall expression of the slc11a2 genes, followed by the mid and
posterior portions of the intestine, stomach and spleen.
Regarding the contribution of each slc11a2 form in the
different tissues, there is a clear predominance of

Likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based model. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates is taken to represent the
evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically as follows. When the number of
common sites was < 100 or less than one fourth of the total number of sites, the maximum parsimony method was used; otherwise BIONJ
method with MCL distance matrix was used. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site
(above the branches). The analysis involved 29 amino acid sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There
were a total of 408 positions in the final dataset. Arrow indicates the duplication point of a and b isoforms in teleosts.

Constitutive expression of the four isoforms of slc11a2-b
by semi-quantitative RT-PCR

In order to assess the relative contribution of each b isoform to the overall slc11a2-b constitutive expression, a

more thorough analysis was performed. Relative constitutive expressions of the four isoforms of sea bass slc11a2-b
were determined by semi-quantitative PCR, since the distance between alternative 5’ and 3’ exons is too great to
adequately use real-time PCR (Figure 7). The four isoforms were named b1 (from exon 1A to exon 15), b2
(from exon 1B to exon 15), b3 (from exon 1A to exon 16)
and b4 (from exon 1B to exon 16).

In most of the tested tissues, there is a predominance
of the slc11a2-b1 form, followed by slc11a2-b2. Slc11a2b3 has a lower constitutive expression in most tissues,
but presents significant expression in the head kidney,
stomach and rectum, whereas slc11a2-b4 is the form
with the lowest expression, although it represents 26%
of the overall expression of slc11a2-b in the gill.

counterparts, and to reiterate the results observed in the
constitutive expression analysis.
In the liver (Figure 8 A-D), slc11a2-a mRNA is very
scarce, being detected in few hepatocytes whereas
slc11a2-b in abundantly slc11a2-a mRNA is scarce,
being only conspicuous in the melanomacrophage centers. Slc11a2-b on the other hand is abundant not only in
the melanomacrophage centers but also in the spleen’s
white pulp. In the head kidney (Figure 8 I-L), both
slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b have a similar distribution,
being abundant in the melanomacrophage centers and
the surrounding lymphomyeloid tissue, and to a much
lesser degree in the hematopoietic tissue. In the intestine,
slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b mRNA present similar patterns
of distribution in the anterior (Figure 8 M-P) and mid
section (Figure 8 Q-T). Slc11a2-a is found to be mostly
concentrated in the apical (brush border) membrane of
the enterocytes, whereas slc11a2-b presents a more
homogeneous distribution, not only in enterocytes but
also in other intestinal cells. However, in the posterior
intestine (Figure 8 U-X), both forms of slc11a2 seem to
be accumulated in or around the goblet cells, with limited presence in the enterocytes.
In all tissues, hybridization with sense probes (control)
for either slc11a2-a or slc11a2-b produced no significant staining.

In situ hybridization

An in situ hybridization was performed in several tissues
to identify the subcellular distribution of sea bass slc11
mRNAs, to obtain further information useful in establishing parallelisms with their mammalian homologous

iron modulation or infection with Photobacterium
damselae spp. piscicida. During the experimental infection, mortality was monitored and found to be high, but
with fish surviving past the final experimental time
point, indicating a chronic infection (Additional File 5,
Figure S5).
In the iron overloaded animals, no changes were
observed in hematocrit (Figure 9 A), and a small but significant increase was observed in the RBC count during
the course of the experiment (Figure 9 B). Increases in
serum iron and transferrin saturation (Figure 9 C-D)
were also observed, the highest levels at 4 days after overload, with decreases during the course of the experiment
and recovery to control levels at 14 days. Liver iron levels
were increased (Figure 9 E), with the maximum value at
7 days post-modulation and a decrease towards 14 days,
but still over 3 times higher than the control animals. In
the iron deficient animals, significant decreases of all
hematological parameters were observed during the
course of the experiment, with values remaining below
the control levels (Figure 9 A-D). Liver iron levels did
not differ significantly from control animals during the
experimental iron deficiency (Figure 9 E).
Significant and steady decreases of all hematological
parameters were observed during the course of the infection (Figure 9 F-I). Liver iron levels increased slightly but
not significantly from control animals (Figure 9 J).
Slc11a2 expression in the in vivo models of iron
modulation and infection

In order to determine the potential involvement of sea
bass slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b in the iron metabolism
and immune response, we evaluated their expression
under conditions of iron modulation (overload or deficiency) or bacterial infection.
In the experimental iron modulation model, slc11a2-a
and slc11a2-b expressions were initially evaluated in the
liver, spleen, head kidney and intestine, 4 days after iron
modulation (Figure 10 A-B). In iron deficiency, there was
a significant increase of slc11a2-a expression in the intestine, with no major changes in the other tested organs.
No significant changes were observed in slc11a2-b
expression. In iron overload, no significant changes in
slc11a2-a were observed, whereas slc11a2-b expression
was found to be increased in the liver. Slc11a2-a and
slc11a2-b expressions were subsequently evaluated in the
liver at 4, 7 and 14 days after iron modulation (Figure 10
D-E). As before, no significant changes were observed in
slc11a2-a expression to either condition in the liver,
whereas slc11a2-b was found t be significantly up-regulated at 4 days post iron overload (over 14-fold), decreasing during the course of the experiment to near control
values, but still over 2-fold higher. Expression of slc11a2a and slc11a2-b was also evaluated 4 days after iron

modulation in several sections of the digestive tract (Figure 10 C), in order to identify the portion of the intestine
responsible for the response of slc11a2-a. Significant
increases of slc11a2-a expression were observed in the
mid and posterior sections of the intestine, with no significant changes in the anterior section or rectum.
In the experimental model of infection, slc11a2-a
and slc11a2-b expressions were measured in the liver,
spleen and head kidney by real-time PCR, 24, 48, 72
and 96 h after infection. In the liver (Figure 11 A), a
steady increase in slc11a2-b expression was observed
during the course of the infection, with the maximum
value at 72 h post-infection (approximately 6.8-fold
increase), followed by a recovery to control levels at 96
h. In the spleen (Figure 11 B), an increase of slc11a2-b
was also observed during the course of the infection,
accompanied by a recovery to control levels at 96 h. In
the head kidney (Figure 11 C), a significant increase of
slc11a2-b was observed 24 h after infection and was
maintained during its course. No significant changes
were observed in slc11a2-a expression in any of the
tested organs.
Slc11a2 expression in the in vitro models of iron overload
and infection

We investigated the role of slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b in
the iron metabolism and immune response at a cellular
level, by using leukocytes from spleen, one of the most
important erythropoietic and immune organs in fish.
In the iron overload in vitro model, expression of
slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b in leukocytes was measured by
real-time PCR at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after the
addition of ferric ammonium citrate (Figure 12 A). No
significant changes were observed in slc11a2-a during
the course of the experimental iron overload. Slc11a2-b,
on the other hand, increased significantly from 6 h postinfection (about 2.5-fold), reaching the maximum
increase at 24 h (about 8.5-fold) and decreased at 48 h,
returning to control levels at 72 h.
In the in vitro infection model with heat-inactivated
P. damselae, expression of slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b in
leukocytes was also measured by real-time PCR at 0, 6,
12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after infection (Figure 12 B). No
significant changes were observed in slc11a2-a during
the course of infection. Slc11a2-b, on the other hand,
increased significantly at 6 h post-infection (about 8fold), followed by a decrease at 12 h (to about 4-fold)
and returned to control levels at 24 h.

Discussion
In the present study, we set out to analyse the evolutionary and functional patterns of SLC11 genes in vertebrates,
in particular teleosts. We have used the European sea
bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) as a model and have

successfully isolated two slc11 genes, named slc11a2-a
and slc11a2-b.
A single transcript was found to be produced, for the
slc11a2-a gene, whereas slc11a2-b can produce up to
four transcripts. The four b transcripts are the result of

alternative exon splicing in the 5’ and 3’ ends, in a similar fashion to what has been described for human
SLC11A2 [62,63]. But unlike human SLC11A2, where
the differences in the 3’ end result from alternate exon
usage [63], in sea bass the differences result from an

alternative splice site in exon 15. Thus, only the second
half of exon 15 is replaced by exon 16.
Neither sea bass slc11a2-a nor slc11a2-b were found
to present a potential iron responsive regulatory protein
binding site (IRE) in the 3’ UTR, a feature that in contrast is present in mammalian SLC11A2 genes [23,63]
and has also been described in some teleost fish, such as
fugu [36] and common carp [42]. It is, however, absent
in other teleosts, such as turbot [35], channel catfish
[43] and Japanese flounder [33]. In the SLC11 gene
family, IREs have only been described in the 3’-UTR but
unexpectedly, an IRE motif was found in the 5’ region
of slc11a2-b, albeit not in the 5’-UTR itself but rather

205 bp upstream the start of the 5’-UTR. The significance of this finding is still unknown, although as with
other 5’ IREs, it may be involved in translation repression [72,73].
The single sea bass slc11a2-a transcript encodes for a
single functional putative protein, whereas the four
slc11a2-b transcripts encode for four putative proteins.
The four b proteins differ in the N and C termini, as a
result of the encoding by the two alternative exons 1
and the alternative splice site in exon 15. Since both N
and C termini are cytoplasmic, they may be involved in
post-transcriptional regulatory processes and in the subcellular localization of these proteins, as occurs in

mammalian SLC11A2 [74]. All sea bass Slc11a2 proteins
present the characteristic features of the SLC11 gene
family: 12 transmembrane (TM) domains, a consensus
transport motif (CTM), several glycosylation and phosphorylation sites and conserved cysteine residues. Multiple alignments clearly show that these features are
highly conserved and are very similar to those observed
not only in other teleost fish, but also in mammals.
However, there are some disparities in the features
found in the 5’ and 3’ endings, namely some N-myristoylation and phosphorylation sites that are not present
in all sea bass Slc11a2-b forms, and which may also

contribute to a differential post-transcriptional regulation and subcellular localization. In all the tree models,
produced by maximum-likelihood, neighbour-joining,
maximum parsimony or Bayesian inference, phylogenetic analysis places all sea bass Slc11 proteins clustered
with other teleost fish Slc11 proteins, which in turn
cluster with mammalian SLC11A2 proteins, clearly separated from SLC11A1. Among teleost proteins, there are
two clear separate clusters. One cluster encompasses sea
bass Slc11a2-b protein as well as all other Slc11 and
Slc11a2-b proteins. The other cluster includes sea bass
Slc11a2-a and all other a proteins, with the exception
of rainbow trout Slc11a2-a, suggesting that rainbow
trout Slc11a2-a may have a different evolutionary origin
than other Slc11a2-a proteins.
There are some explanations that could account for
the existence of two closely related slc11a2 genes in sea
bass, which are in agreement with what has already
been proposed for other teleost fish, such as fugu. The
current evolutionary scenario proposes that slc11 paralogs appeared through the 2R genome duplication
[36,49,50], and functionally diverged. This is supported
by the close linkage to HoxC and HoxD which are
assumed to be duplicate loci. In addition, the teleost fish
paralogs are more similar to mammalian SLC11A2 and
may result from a third, fish specific, genome duplication [51,52]. The synteny analysis performed in the

Neves et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:106
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/106

current study strongly supports the latter, suggesting
that the ancestor of all vertebrates had a single SLC11
gene that quadrupled as part of the 2R genome duplications. Two of the new genes were lost, while two were
maintained in the ancestor of tetrapods and teleosts. In
teleosts the slc11a2 clade expanded as the result of 3R
to originate two isoforms, slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b,
while the slc11a1 ortholog was lost (Figure 13). Unlike
other teleosts [36], trout’s slc11a2 homologs do not
seem to result from 3R but rather a salmonid specific
tetraploidization [45].
The overall constitutive expression pattern of sea bass
slc11 transcripts resembles that of the mammalian
SLC11A2 gene [24-26], but also of slc11a2 genes
described in other teleost fishes [33,35,42,43,45].
Slc11a2-a was found to be ubiquitously expressed, but
with a higher expression along the digestive tract, with a
particularly high incidence in the mid and posterior sections of the intestine. This already gives some indications for its possible involvement in intestinal iron

Figure 13 Evolutionary model of SLC11 genes in vertebrate history.

Page 15 of 23

absorption in sea bass, since the Slc11a2 mediated
uptake of iron and other food derived metals in teleosts
occurs predominantly in the mid and posterior regions
of the intestine, as previously described [46,47]. Slc11a2b was also found to be ubiquitously expressed, although
unlike slc11a2-a, being abundant in the liver and in
varying levels in all other tested tissues. No clear pattern
was observed regarding the distribution of the four isoforms of slc11a2-b, although a prevalence of the b1 and
b2 forms in most tested tissues was evident. Further
analysis is needed to determine the exact function and
contribution of each isoform. It is possible that they
function in different subcellular compartments, with
some of the forms more relevant in the immune
response, while others may play a more prominent role
in overall iron metabolism.
The in situ hybridization results in the liver, spleen, head
kidney and sections of the intestine mostly reflect the
measured constitutive expression. In the liver and spleen
there is a clear prevalence of slc11a2-b, whereas in the

Neves et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:106
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/106

head kidney although the constitutive expression indicates
a prevalence of slc11a2-b, there seems to be an almost
even distribution of both forms. Note that in the spleen
and kidney slc11a2-b mRNA is clearly visible in the white
pulp and lymphomyeloid tissue, respectively, which are
both areas rich in B- and T-lymphocytes and actively
involved in the immune response [75,76]. In the intestine,
the in situ results show that slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b are
expressed in different compartments of the enterocytes,
with slc11a2-a mRNA mostly concentrated close to the
brush border of the apical pole, whereas slc11a2-b is
spread all over the cells, not only in the enterocytes but
also in other intestinal cells. This observation provides
further evidence for a sub-functionalization of slc11a2
homologs in sea bass, with slc11a2-a localization resembling that of the mammalian SLC11A2 IRE-positive isoforms and slc11a2-b with the more general distribution of
mammalian SLC11A2 IRE-negative isoforms [62,74,77].
An issue that remains puzzling is the distribution of
slc11a2 isoforms in the posterior intestine, with both
forms concentrated in or around the goblet cells, the
intestinal glandular cells that secret mucin [78]. In mammals, there are conflicting reports on the presence of
SLC11A2 in the goblet cells, with some reporting its
absence [79] while others report its presence [80], suggesting that, along with mobilferrin, SLC11A2 facilitates iron
uptake.
To better understand the role of sea bass slc11a2
genes, in vivo and in vitro experimental models of iron
modulation and infection were created. Haematological
and iron parameters, and expression levels of slc11a2-a
and slc11a2-b were evaluated under those experimental
conditions.
In the experimentally iron deficient animals, with
decreased haematological parameters, slc11a2-a expression was significantly up-regulated in the intestine,
whereas slc11a2-b did not respond in any of the tested tissues. Further characterization of the slc11a2-a response to
iron deficiency in the intestine showed that the up-regulation was mostly confined to the mid and posterior portions of the intestine. This is in accordance with previous
findings that intestinal metal uptake in teleost fish occurs
mainly in the posterior portion of the intestine [46,47],
unlike mammals, where uptake occurs primarily in the
duodenum [23]. These results further reinforce the idea
that sea bass slc11a2-a seems to be mainly involved in
iron uptake by the enterocytes.
In the experimentally iron overloaded animals, steady
increases of the hematocrit and red blood cell counts
were observed, as well as high levels of serum iron and
transferrin saturation in the first days of the experiment.
Also, increased levels of iron were observed in the liver,
further confirming the iron overload status. Slc11a2-a
expression did not change significantly in response to

Page 16 of 23

iron overload in any of the tested tissues and slc11a2-b
was up-regulated only in the liver. Together with the
increased liver iron content, this is likely associated with
the need to cope with the excess of iron introduced into
the system, in order to prevent its toxic effects. In normal
conditions, iron in the blood is bound to transferrin, and
transferrin-iron complexes are internalized by a transferrin receptor-mediated endocytic pathway. Through acidification of the endosome, iron is released from
transferrin and SLC11A2 is recruited to the endosome
membrane, where it exports iron to the cytoplasm. Iron
is then used in cellular processes or stored in ferritin
molecules. When more iron is introduced into the system, an increased expression of these genes could be
expected. We have already demonstrated that during
iron overload there is an increased expression of ferritin,
although not accompanied by an up-regulation of transferrin, most likely due the already high levels of constitutive expression in the liver [56].
In the in vivo experimental infection with live P. damselae, a significant and continuous decrease of all haematological parameters was observed, suggesting a
condition that is commonly known as anaemia of
inflammation or chronic disease. This response was first
described in humans [81,82] and later reported for teleost fish, namely sea bass [56,57,59] and Nile tilapia [83].
During bacterial infection, inflammatory cytokines, such
as IL-6, prompt the liver to increase the production of
the iron metabolism regulatory peptide hepcidin, causing the internalization of ferroportin and thus preventing cellular iron export [82,84]. The iron retention leads
to impairment in erythropoiesis, due to the lack of iron
availability. Overall, these changes contribute to limiting
the availability of iron for pathogen growth. We have
previously shown that hepcidin [59] and ferritin [56]
levels are increased during bacterial infection in sea
bass, thus confirming the presence of this mechanism in
teleosts.
The bacterial challenge significantly up-regulated the
expression of slc11a2-b in the liver, spleen and head
kidney, in a time-dependent fashion, but produced no
significant changes in slc11a2-a expression. A similar
up-regulation was observed in slc11a2 homologs of
other teleost fish in response to V. anguillarum [34,35],
Mycobacterium [32], E. ictaluri [48] and LPS [43].
Further analysis will be required in order to determine
whether in this case Slc11a2-b is acting as the mammalian counterpart of SLC11A1, being recruited to the
membrane of pathogen-containing phagosomes, or of
SLC11A2, being recruited to the membrane of holotransferrin-positive recycling endosomes involved in
iron uptake from the extracellular environment. Since
there are no SLC11A1 homologs in sea bass, and there
are 4 different proteins encoded by slc11a2-b, it is

Neves et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:106
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/106

tempting to propose that Slc11a2-b is performing both
SLC11A1 and SLC11A2 mammalian functions.
In the in vitro iron overload of spleen-isolated leukocytes, slc11a2-b was found to be up-regulated in a timedependent fashion, whereas no significant changes in
slc11a2-a expression were observed. The increase in
slc11a2-b expression is most likely due to the increase
in iron accumulation in the macrophages, to cope with
the excess iron introduced in the medium, which could
become toxic for the cells.
The in vitro experimental infection with heat-inactivated
P. damselae, in spleen-isolated leukocytes, produced the
same effect as that observed in vivo, with an up-regulation
of slc11a2-b and no changes in slc11a2-a expression. Not
much information is available on the expression of SLC11
homologs in leukocytes, but it is known that mammalian
SLC11A1 expression is stimulated by M. avium in peritoneal macrophages [85] and by LPS and IFN-g in
RAW264.7 macrophages [86]. Mammalian SLC11A2
expression is also stimulated by M. avium in peritoneal
macrophages, although differentially from SLC11A1 [85].
Also, catfish slc11 was found to be stimulated in monocytes by LPS [43]. As for the in vivo experimental infection, it has yet to be determined whether Slc11a2-b is
functioning as SLC11A1 or SLC11A2, but since both
forms are known to be required for an efficient erythrophagocytosis and iron recycling in macrophages [87], it is
likely that it is performing both functions. Expression studies of the four slc11a2-b forms and subcellular localization in the leukocytes could provide some insight on this
matter.

Conclusions
We have successfully isolated two slc11 paralogs in sea
bass, that we named slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b. We have
demonstrated that they have a role not only in iron
metabolism but also in the response to bacterial infection. The clarification of the evolutionary scenario along
with the functional data suggests a curious and complex
pattern of sub-functionalization [88] and paralog functional equivalence, a process previously named as synfunctionalization [89,90]: the fish specific paralog
slc11a2-a retained in part the original mammalian
SLC11A2 function, whereas the slc11a2-b isoform not
only retained the original SLC11A2 function but also
acquired the SLC11A1 function after the loss of this isoform in teleosts (Figure 13).

Centro Interdisciplinar de Investigação Marinha e
Ambiental (CIIMAR, Porto, Portugal). Fish were maintained in 2000 liter tanks with water recirculation at a
temperature of 12-14°C and constant salinity (32 ppm).
The fish were fed daily to satiation with commercial fish
feed (EWOS, West Lothian, UK) with an iron content of
approximately 200 mg iron/kg feed and kept for more
than three weeks prior to experimental use. At the
beginning of each treatment fish were anaesthetized
with 100 mg/l water of tricaine methanesulfonate
(MS222) (Pharmaq, Fordingbridge, UK). All animal
experiments were carried out in strict compliance with
national and international animal use ethics guidelines,
approved by the animal welfare and ethic committees of
IBMC and CIIMAR (permit ref. Ofício Circular n° 99,
0420/000/000 of 09/11/2009 from the Direcção Geral de
Veterinária (DGV), Portuguese Ministry of Agriculture,
Rural Development and Fisheries) and conducted by
FELASA Category C/DGV certified investigators.
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis

Fish were euthanized by anesthetic overdose of MS222
(250 mg/l), dissected and tissue samples collected, snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until further
use. Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Midi Kit
for Total RNA Isolation from Animal Cells (Qiagen,
Valencia CA, USA) with the optional On-Column DNase
Digestion with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen). Total RNA
quantification was performed using a NanoDrop 1000
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham MA,
USA), quality was assessed by visualization in a denaturating formaldehyde-agarose gel and 1.25 μg of each sample were converted to cDNA by Thermoscript™ and an
oligo (dT) 20 primer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA, USA),
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Southern blot assay

Genomic DNA was isolated from sea bass red blood cells,
as described elsewhere [91]. To determine the number of
slc11 gene copies in sea bass, 10 μg of genomic DNA
were independently digested for 24 h with EcoRI or HindII (Roche Applied Science, Mannhelm, Germany).
Digestion products were run on an appropriate electrophoresis gel and blotted onto a positively charged nylon
membrane (Byodine® Plus Membrane, Pall Life Sciences,
Ann Arbor MI, USA). The membrane was subjected to
Southern analysis using the DIG System (Roche Applied
Science) according to the manufacturer’s specifications.
Briefly, a 152 bp slc11 DIG labeled probe was prepared
with the DIG Probe Synthesis Kit (Roche Applied
Science), using primers designed based on other fish
slc11 mRNA sequences (supplementary table S1), the
membrane was hybridized at 55°C, washed, and detection
was performed with the chemiluminescent substrate

Neves et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:106
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/106

CDP-Star (Roche Applied Science). Visualization was
achieved by exposing the membrane to X-ray film
(Hyperfilm™, GE healthcare, Buckinghamshire, England)
for 5-20 minutes.
Isolation of sea bass slc11 genes

Several pairs of oligonucleotide PCR primers (Additional
File 6, Table S1) were designed according to highly conserved regions of slc11a1 and slc11a2 mRNA sequences
from other fish and mammalian species, available in the
National Center for Biotechnology Information nucleotide database [92] and Ensembl [93] and cDNA preparations from liver, spleen and intestine were used in PCR
amplifications. PCR products were run on 1.2% agarose
gels, relevant fragments were purified with the QIAquick
Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), cloned into pGEM-T Easy
vectors, propagated in JM109 High Efficiency Competent Cells (Promega Corporation, Madison WI, USA)
and sent for sequencing (Stabvida, Oeiras, Portugal).
The derived cDNA sequences were compared by megablast alignment with genomic contigs of an early version
of the D. labrax whole genome shotgun assembly (Max
Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Berlin, Germany). The genomic contigs were the result of an assembly of ~3× genome coverage Sanger sequencing reads
and ~3× coverage 454 FLX Titanium pyro-sequencing
reads by the Celera Assembler v5.3 [94]. Contigs that
matched the cDNA sequences were used to build the
gene models as implied by mRNA sequences.

Genomic organization

Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5’and 3’RACE)

Both 5’ and 3’ RACE were carried out using the 5’/3’
RACE Kit, 2 nd Generation (Roche Applied Science)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Conditions
for PCR were: 94°C for 2 min, 94°C for 15 s, 60°C for
30 s, 72°C for 40 s, for 10 cycles; 94°C for 15 s, 60°C for
30 s, 72°C for 40 s (plus 20 s/cycle), for 25 cycles, with a
final elongation at 72°C for 7 min. When necessary, a
second PCR amplification was performed using these
conditions for an additional 30 cycles. PCR products
were run on 1.2% agarose gels, relevant fragments were
purified with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen),
cloned and sequenced as described earlier.
Sequence analysis and alignment

Both strands of the cDNA were sequenced and
assembled using Multalin [95,96] and by manual comparison of overlapping electropherograms. Alignments
of the amino acid sequences of the Slc11 predicted proteins were performed using ClustalW from MEGA5
[97]. Phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Maximum-Likelihood method, with the Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) model, Nearest-Neighbor-Interchange (NNI)
heuristic model, complete deletion of gaps and 1000

Genomic DNA was amplified by RT-PCR with the primers previously used for cDNA (Additional File 6, Table
S1) and several PCR products were purified, cloned and
sent for sequencing (Stabvida). Whole genome shotgun
reads (Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)
were used to extend genomic regions that could not be
amplified by RT-PCR. Comparisons were made between
cDNA and genomic DNA to assess the similarity of the
coding regions and to identify intron/exon boundaries.
Sea bass slc11 genes genomic organization was compared with the sequences for fugu (Takifugu rubripes)
slc11a2, tetraodon (Tetraodon nigroviridis) slc11a2,
xenopus (Xenopus tropicalis) slc11a1 and slc11a2,
mouse (Mus musculus) Slc11a1 and Slc11a2, human
(Homo sapiens) SLC11A1 and SLC11A2 and Drosophila
(Drosophila melanogaster) Mvl-RA, available at Ensembl,
release 57.
Paralogy and synteny analysis

We identified and located the human orthologs of
SLC11A1 (Hsa2q) and SLC11A2 (Hsa12q) using the
Ensembl database release 57. These regions are part of
the Hox paralogon [36], along with Hsa17q and Hsa3p/7.
To infer if the human SLC11A1 and SLC11A2 gene

Neves et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:106
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/106

environment displayed signs of duplication attributable
to the 2R genome duplications, the gene content in a
1Mb Ensembl window was analysed. Gene families with
more members mapping to distinct regions of the Hox
paralogon were identified. Their phylogenenic relationships were inferred from the phylogenies generated by
the Ensembl orthology/paralogy pipeline. Synteny data
for the teleost species was retrieved from Ensembl databases. Orthology/paralogy relationships and location of
human sequences were derived from the ortholog/paralog prediction function of the Ensembl website. Phylogenetic relationship of the duplicated teleost genes was
determined as previously outlined.
Slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b constitutive expression by realtime RT-PCR

Relative levels of slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b mRNAs were
quantified by real-time PCR analysis using an iQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules CA, USA). One μl of each cDNA sample was
added to a reaction mix containing 10 μl iQ SYBR
Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 8.5 μl of ddH20 and 250 nM
of each primer, making a total volume of 20 μl per reaction. A non-template control was included for each set
of primers (supplementary table S1). The cycling profile
was the following: 94°C for 3.5 min, 40 cycles of 94°C
for 30 s, 59°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s. A melting
curve was generated for every PCR product to confirm
the specificity of the assays and a dilution series was
prepared to check the efficiency of the reactions. b-actin
was used as the housekeeping gene. The comparative
CT method (2-ΔΔCT method) based on cycle threshold
(CT) values for slc11a2-a, slc11a2-b and b-actin was
used to analyze the expression levels of slc11a2-a and
slc11a2-b.
Slc11a2-b isoforms constitutive expression by semiquantitative RT-PCR

Since the different 5’ and 3’ exons are separated by
approximately 1.6 kb, evaluation of the constitutive
expression of the four isoforms of slc11a2-b by realtime PCR was not a viable option. Hence, we optimized
the conditions for semi-quantitative PCR to be able to
reliably and specifically distinguish between these variants. To this end, exon 1A- or 1B-specific forward primers were combined with exon 15- or 16-specific
reverse primers (Additional File 6, Table S1). PCRs were
performed with the following conditions: 10-30 cycles of
94°C for 30 s, 59°C for 30 s and 72°C for 2 min, with an
initial 5 min denaturation at 94°C and a final 10 min
extension at 72°C. PCR products were resolved on ethidium bromide-stained 1.2% agarose gels, scanned on a
GelDocXR+ (Biorad) and quantified using Quantity One
software (Biorad).

In situ hybridization

All reagents used for in situ hybridization were prepared
with 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) in double-distilled H 2 O to rid of RNases from working solutions.
Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled anti-sense and sense riboprobes for slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b of approximately
150 bp were synthesized in vitro from linearized plasmid
DNA, following the DIG-UTP supplier instructions
(Roche Applied Science). Sections of liver, spleen, head
kidney and anterior/mid/posterior regions of intestine
were fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in
100 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) at 4°C
for 8 h. After dehydration, sections were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 3 μm, mounted on poly-L-lysine coated
slides, and dried at 42°C for 36 h. The sections were
dewaxed in xylene 4 times (2 min each), followed by
immersion in 100% ethanol (1 min), 90% ethanol (30 s),
75% ethanol (45 s) and washed with water (1 min). They
were then pre-hybridized in a hybridization buffer containing 50% (v/v) deionized formamide, 50 μg/ml heparin, 5×
standard saline citrate (SSC), 0.1% Tween-20, 9.2 mM
citric acid pH 6.0 and 0.5 mg/ml total yeast RNA at 70°C
for 2 h, and hybridized in the same hybridization buffer
with 1 μg/ml of DIG-labeled anti-sense or sense riboprobes at 70°C for 12-16 h in a humidified chamber. Subsequently, the sections were subjected to several washes at
70°C: 10 min with 75% wash buffer (65% (V/V) deionized
formamide, 5× SSC and 0.1% Tween-20)/25% 2× SSC, 10
min with 50% wash buffer/50% 2× SSC, 10 min with 25%
wash buffer/75% 2× SSC, 10 min with 2× SSC and twice
for at least 30 min with 0.05× SSC. These were followed
by washes at room temperature, with shaking: 5 min in
50% 0.05× SSC/50% tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethaneHCl (Tris-HCl) (pH 7.4) with 150 mM NaCl and twice for
5 min with 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with 150 mM
NaCl. Slides were then pre-incubated in blocking reagent
(2% normal goat serum and 2 mg/ml of bovine serum
albumin) in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with 150 mM
NaCl for 1 h at room temperature with shaking and incubated with anti-DIG alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibody (Roche Applied Science) diluted 1:100 in blocking
reagent for 2 h at room temperature. The sections were
washed three times (5 min each) in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH
7.4) with 100 mM NaCl and 50 mM MgCl2, then incubated with a coloring solution consisting of 4.5 μg/ml
NBT and 3.5 μg/ml BCIP in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)
with 100 mM NaCl and 50 mM MgCl2 for 2-24 h in the
dark. The color reaction was stopped in PBS for 10 min.
After rinsing in distilled water, the sections were mounted
with Faramount Mounting Medium (Dako, Carpinteria
CA, USA) and photographed under an Olympus BH-2
microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), with an Olympus
DP25 digital camera (Olympus). Control sections were

also prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E).
In vivo model of experimental iron modulation

In order to modulate the sea bass iron status, fish reared
as described before were anaesthetized and subjected to
one of three different treatments, forming three experimental groups: iron overload, iron deficient and control
(15 fish per group). To induce iron overload, fish were
intraperitoneally injected with 200 μl of Iron Dextran
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) diluted in sterile PBS to a
final concentration of 10 mg/ml, as previously reported
[57]. To induce the iron deficient state, fish were bled
from the caudal vessels (approximately 500 μl of blood).
Control fish were injected with 200 μl of sterile PBS.
Four, seven and fourteen days after treatment, 5 fish
from each of the experimental groups were anaesthetized and blood was drawn from the caudal vessels for
evaluation of hematological parameters. Subsequently,
fish were euthanized with an overdose of anesthetic, dissected and several tissues excised, snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80°C for further iron content
evaluation and gene expression analysis.

heparinized blood was transferred into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes, and allowed to clot for 12 h at 4°C. The
samples were centrifuged twice at 16000×g until a clear
serum was obtained. Serum iron (SI), unsaturated iron
binding capacity (UIBC), total iron binding capacity
(TIBC) and transferrin saturation (TS) were determined
by the liquid ferrozine ® method (Thermo Electron,
Victoria, Australia) according to the manufacturer’s
specifications.
Non-heme iron was measured in livers by the bathophenanthroline method [102]. Briefly, liver samples were
weighted, placed in iron-free Teflon vessels (ACVAdvanced Composite Vessel, CEM Corporation, Matthews
NC, USA) and dried in a microwave oven (MDS 2000,
CEM Corporation). Subsequently, dry tissue weights were
determined and samples digested in an acid mixture (30%
hydrochloric acid and 10% trichloroacetic acid) for 20 h at
65°C. After digestion, a chromogen reagent (5 volumes of
deionised water, 5 volumes of saturated sodium acetate
and 1 volume of 0.1% bathophenanthroline sulfonate/1%
thioglycollic acid) was added to the samples in order to
react with iron and obtain a colored product that was measured spectrophotometrically at 535 nm. The extinction
coefficient for bathophenanthroline is 22.14 mM-1cm-1.

In vivo model of experimental infection

Photobacterium damselae spp. piscicida, strain DI21,
known to be pathogenic in sea bass, was used for the
experimental infections. P. damselae was cultured to
mid-logarithmic growth in tryptic soy broth (TSB)
growth medium, supplemented with 1% NaCl. After
measuring absorbance at 600 nm, bacteria were resuspended in TSB 1% NaCl to a final concentration of
5.0 × 105 CFUs ml-1.
For the experimental infection, 48 fish were anaesthetized and intraperitoneally injected with 200 μl (1.0 × 105
CFU) of bacterial suspension. For the control group, 25
fish were injected with 200 μl of TSB 1% NaCl. At 24, 48,
72 and 96 h of infection, 6 fish from each group were
anaesthetized and blood drawn from the caudal vessels
for evaluation of hematological parameters. Fish were
then euthanized with an overdose of anesthetic, dissected
and several tissues excised, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at -80°C for further iron content evaluation
and gene expression analysis. Mortality was assessed
every 12 h during the experimental infection.
Hematological parameters and tissue iron in the in vivo
experimental models

In order to determine hematological parameters, peripheral blood was drawn from the caudal vessels. For red
blood cells count and hematocrit determination, 150 μl
of blood were used in a 1:1 dilution with heparin in PBS
(1000 units/ml). For determination of serum iron, non-

In vitro experimental models of iron overload and
infection

Leucocytes were isolated from sea bass spleens. For each
experiment (infection and iron overload), 5 untreated
healthy fish were anesthetized and bled from the caudal
vessels, then euthanized with anesthetic overdose.
Spleens were aseptically dissected, placed in isolation
medium (RPMI with 0.1% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 1%
Essential Amino Acids (A/A), 1% MEM Non-essential
Amino Acid solution (MEMNEAA), 0.35% NaCl 1M and
0.4% heparin) for 10 min and macerated, with the addition of isolation medium, over a 0.4 μm mesh into a 15
ml centrifuge tube. Volumes were adjusted to 10 ml and
centrifuged at 400× g for 10 min, at 4°C. The pellet was
resuspended in 5 ml of isolation medium, overlaid on 5
ml of Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway)
and centrifuged at 800×g for 30 min, at 4°C. Cells were
collected from the interface and washed twice with isolation medium at 1000×g for 10 min. The pellets were
resuspended in complete culture medium (RPMI with 5%
FBS, 1% A/A, 1% MEMNEAA, 5% SBS and 0.35% NaCl)
to a final concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml.
For the iron overload experiment, cells were distributed
between twelve 6-well flat bottom plates (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany), 5 fish per plate, 2 ml per well (5 × 106
cells). The control and iron overload groups (6 plates
each) received 200 μl of 0.1 M ammonium citrate (Sigma)
or 200 μl of 0.1 M ferric ammonium citrate (Sigma, iron

Neves et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:106

content of 16.5-18.5%) per well, respectively. The latter is
equivalent to approximately 8 μg of iron per well. For the
experimental infection, cells were distributed as previously
described and the control and infected groups (6 plates
each) received 200 μl of PBS or 200 μl of heat-inactivated
Photobacterium damselae (1 × 10 8 cells/ml) per well,
respectively. Plates were kept in an incubator at 23°C for
the duration of the experiments.
At 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-treatments, cells
were collected and RNA was isolated. Briefly, cells in
suspension were collected into RNase-free tubes and
0.2% trypsin in PBS was added to the wells until adherent cells detached. Complete culture medium was added
and the cell suspension was transferred into the same
RNase-free tubes. RNA was isolated according to the
RNeasy Plus Mini protocol (Qiagen) and cDNA was
prepared with Thermoscript (Invitrogen) as described
before.
Slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b expression under iron
modulation and infection in the in vivo and in vitro
models

The relative levels of slc11a2-a and slc11a2-b mRNAs
in the organs (in vivo models) and leukocytes (in vitro
models) were quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Total
RNA isolation, cDNA preparation and real-time RTPCR were performed as described before.
Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was carried out using PASW Statistics
v17.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL, USA). Data
normality was checked by performing KolmogorofSmirnoff test and Student’s T-test was used for estimating statistical significance. Multiple comparisons were
performed with ANOVA. A p value less than 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
