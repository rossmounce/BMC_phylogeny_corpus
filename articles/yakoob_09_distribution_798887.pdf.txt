Abstract
Background: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is known to be associated with a spectrum of
gastroduodenal diseases. We studied the association of H. pylori virulence markers cytotoxinassociated gene (cagA) and vacuolating associated cytotoxin gene (vacA) alleles in patients with non
ulcer dyspepsia (NUD), gastric ulcer (GU), gastric carcinoma (GC) and duodenal ulcer (DU).
Methods: H. pylori infection established by both rapid urease test and histology were studied. The
cagA and vacA allelic status was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sequencing of vacA
i1 and i2 PCR product was carried out.
Results: Two hundred and twenty-four patients were included, 141 (63%) were males with a mean
age of 45 ± 16, range 16-83 years. The virulence marker cagA was associated with GU in 20(63%)
(p = 0.04), DU in 23(72%) (p = 0.003) and GC in 29(73%) (p = 0.001) compared to NUD in
51(42%). VacA s1am1 was associated with GU in 23(72%) (p = 0.001), DU in 17(53%) (p < 0.001)
and GC in 23(58%) (p = 0.003) compared to NUD in 38(32%) while vacA s1bm1 was also associated
with GU in 9(28%) (p = 0.001), DU in 12(37%) (p < 0.001) and GC 11(28%) (p < 0.001) compared
to NUD in 13(11%), respectively. The diagnoses of GU in 21(66%), DU in 16(50%), GC in 20(50%)
and NUD in 50(42%) were associated with moderately active chronic inflammation. CagA in
55(45%) (p = 0.037), vacA s1am1 in 51(51%) (P < 0.001), s1bm1 in 25(56%) (p = 0.002), s1am2
32(30%) (p < 0.001) and s1bm2 29(69%) (p = 0.004) were also associated with moderately active
chronic inflammation.
Conclusion: CagA was negative in majority of NUD patients with H. pylori infection. However,
cagA was associated with peptic ulcer and GC. VacA allele's s1am1 and s1bm1 were associated with
H. pylori associated diseases and inflammation.

Background
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection leads to the development of chronic gastritis and may lead to the develop-

ment of duodenal and gastric ulcers, gastric
adenocarcinoma and lymphoma [1-3]. The prevalence of
H. pylori is high in developing countries. Its seropreva-

lence in Pakistan exceeds 58% of our general population
and is common in asymptomatic population [4] A recent
study revealed an early colonization/infection of infants
with H. pylori and a prevalence of 67% at 9 months of age
in a peri-urban community in Karachi, Pakistan [5]. The
prevalence varies among countries with existing evidence
suggesting that the diversity in disease outcome may be
ascribed to variations in infecting strains [6,7]. Two phenotypic characteristics among H. pylori strains, the high
molecular weight protein encoded by the cytotoxin-associated gene A (cag A), and the vacuolating cytotoxin (vac
A) have been found to be associated with distinct gastrointestinal disorders [8,9]. About 60-80% of H. pylori
strains express the 120-to-140 kDa cagA product that is
recognized by serum antibodies [10]. Various studies have
demonstrated a strong association between the presence
of antibodies to cag A and peptic ulcer disease and gastric
carcinoma [11,12]. The gene encoding vacA is present in
nearly all strains; however, the activity of this cytotoxin is
positive in only 40-60% of patients with peptic ulcer disease and in 30% of H. pylori strains from patients with
chronic gastritis [12,13]. The vacA gene present in all H.
pylori strains comprises two variable parts, the 's' region
(encoding the signal peptide) and two alleles, 's1' and 's2'
have been recognized. Within type 's1', several subtypes
(s1a, s1b and s1c) can be distinguished [13]. For the 'm'
region (middle) two alleles, 'm1' or 'm2', have been identified. Recently, a novel determinant of vacA called the
intermediate (i) region has been described [14]. It has
been shown to be a better predictor of the carcinogenic
potential of the H. pylori strains than the current signal
region and midregion typing systems. The aim of this
study was to investigate the distribution of tissue cagA and
vacA allelic status in H. pylori positive gastroduodenal diseases and their associated histopathological changes in
gastric mucosa.

Methods
Patients
Two hundred and twenty-four patients were included in
the study. All patients were reported positive for H. pylori
infection by the rapid urease test and or histology. There
were 141 (63%) males and 83 (37%) females with a mean
age of 45 ± 16, range 16-83 years. These patients presented
with upper gastrointestinal symptoms and majority met
the Rome III Diagnostic Criteria for Functional Dyspepsia
i.e., at least 3 months, with onset at least 6 months previously, of 1 or more of the following: bothersome postprandial fullness, early satiation, epigastric pain or
epigastric burning in the absence of structural disease to
explain the symptoms [15]. The diagnosis in these
patients was non ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) in 120(54%),
gastric carcinoma (GC) in 40(18%), duodenal ulcer (DU)
in 32(14%) and gastric ulcer (GU) in 32(14%). Of GC

22(15%) were in corpus, 13(33%) in antrum and 5(12%)
in fundus. They were all adenocarcinomas 20(50%) were
diffuse and 20(50%) intestinal in nature. They attended
the gastroenterology outpatient and endoscopy suite from
June 2007 to December 2008. The study was approved by
the Ethics Review Committee of Aga Khan University. All
patients gave an informed consent for endoscopy and participation in the study. None of the patients had received
antibiotics, acid reducing drugs such as H2-receptor
antagonists, acid pump inhibitors, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or bismuth compounds in the last 4
weeks. The clinical symptoms at the time of presentation
and endoscopic findings were noted. Gastric biopsy specimens were taken from an area of inflammation in the
antrum and corpus. Two biopsy specimens were removed
for each of the rapid urease test (Pronto Dry), histology
and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Two gastric biopsy
specimens were inserted into rapid urease test (Pronto
Dry). Specimens for histology were dispatched in formalin while for PCR in 0.9% normal saline. The cagA PCR for
5' terminal and vacA alleles for the signal "s", middle "m"
and intermediate region "i" were analyzed.
Rapid Urease test
Pronto Dry results were read in 30 minutes after sampling
as directed by the manufacturer. The color change from
yellow to pink was considered positive [16].
Histology
Gastric biopsy specimens for histopathology were stained
with Hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) stain for the detection of H. pylori and degree of gastritis. In doubtful cases,
Giemsa staining was carried out to ascertain presence of
H. pylori. The degree of gastritis as determined on H & E
stain was scored in accordance with the Sydney system
[17]. The presence of H pylori was determined by the positive rapid urease test and histology. All biopsy specimens
for histological examination were fixed in 10% formalin,
embedded in paraffin wax on the oriented edge, and cut
into 5 μm thick sequential sections. All tissue sections
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological
examination. The degree of acute and chronic inflammation, as well as the H pylori density was scored according
to the updated Sydney system. The bacterial density was
graded from 0 to 3 (0, absent; 1 to 3, from few and isolated bacteria to colonies). The infiltration of gastric
mucosa by mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear
leucocytes, atrophy, and intestinal metaplasia were
graded as follows: 0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3,
marked. Chronic inflammation was defined according to
an increase in lymphocytes and plasma cells in the lamina
propria graded into mild, moderate or marked increase in
density. Chronic active gastritis indicated chronic inflammation with neutrophilic polymorph infiltration of the

lamina propria, pits or surface epithelium graded as 0 =
nil, mild =< 1/3 of pits and surface infiltrated; moderate =
1/3-2/3; and marked => 2/3. Antrum and corpus gastritis
were scored by total sum of grade of gastritis (mild = 1,
moderate = 2, marked = 3 infiltration with lymphocytes
and plasma cells) and activity of gastritis (mild = 1, moderate = 2, marked = 3 infiltration with neutrophilic granulocytes) either in the antrum or in the corpus, a maximum
of a sum of 6 points for each individual patient. Atrophy
was defined as the loss of inherent glandular tissue, with
or without replacement by intestinal-type epithelium. For
optimal histological evaluation, all gastric biopsy specimens included surface epithelium and muscularis
mucosae. Lymphoid aggregates were defined as accumulations of lymphocytes and plasma cells without a germinal
centre.
DNA extraction from tissues
DNA was extracted from gastric tissue as described before
[18]. Briefly, gastric tissue was homogenized to uniformity in 500 μl of sterile water and centrifuged at 12,000 × g
for 3 minutes. 500 ul of lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10
mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 25 mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium
dodecyl sulfate), and 10 μl of Proteinase K (10 mg/ml)
was added. Incubation was carried out at 50°C for 20 h;
this was followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and
ethanol precipitation. The resulting pellet was allowed to
dissolve in 40 μl of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4]
and 0.1 mM EDTA [pH 8.0] for 20 h at 37'C. Samples were
stored at -20°C before PCR amplification was performed.
DNA content and purity was determined by measuring
the absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm using a spectrophotometer (Beckman DU-600, USA).
Polymerase chain reaction
Amplification of cag A and vac A alleles by PCR was performed in a volume of 50 μl containing 10 mmol/L TrisHCl (pH 8.3), 50 mmol KCl, 1.5-2.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 200
μmol/L deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 2 units Taq DNA
polymerase (Promega) and 25 pmol of both forward and
reverse primers (Table 1) used before [14,19,20] (synthesized by MWG Automatic synthesizer). PCR was performed in a Perkin Elmer 9700 thermal cycler. The
amplification cycles for cagA and vacA alleles are given in
Table 1. Positive and negative reagent control reactions
were performed with each batch of amplifications. DNA
from H. pylori strains ATCC 43504 (vacAs1am1, cagA positive), ATCC 51932 (vacA s2m2, cagA negative) and ATCC
43526 (vacA s1bm1, cagA positive) was used to define the
accuracy of the cagA and vacA-i PCR and positive control
DNA for vacA-i region i1 and i2 labeled as 97-67 and 9772, respectively [14]. After PCR, the amplified PCR products were electrophoresed in 2% agarose gels containing
0.5% × Tris/acetate/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/9/87

stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under a
short wavelength ultraviolet light source.
Sequence analysis of vacA i region PCR product and
BLAST Query
The DNA fragments amplified by vacA i-region, type's i1
and i2 PCRs were purified by Qiagen quick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, USA) and sequenced using both the forward and reverse primers (Table 1) to verify that they
represented truly the H. pylori vacuolating cytotoxin gene.
Sequence analysis was performed by Macrogen (Seoul,
South Korea). Sequence comparison was carried out using
the Blast program and the GenBank databases.
Statistical assessment
The statistical package for social science SPSS (Release 16,
standard version, copyright© SPSS; 2007) was used for
data analysis. The descriptive analysis was done for demographic and clinical features. Results were presented as
mean ± standard deviation for quantitative variables and
number (percentage) for qualitative variables. Differences
in proportion were assessed by using Pearson Chi square,
Fisher exact or likelihood ratio test where appropriate.
Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare
inflammatory score among diagnoses and virulence markers. P value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically
significant.

Results
The symptoms of the patients included abdominal pain
161(72%), weight loss 23(11%), vomiting 11(5%), bloating 9(4%), hematemesis 12(6%) and melena 4(2%). The
endoscopic findings were gastritis in 120 patients with
NUD (54%), gastric carcinoma (GC) in 40(18%), gastric
ulcer (GU) in 32 (14%) and duodenal ulcer (DU) in 32
(14%) (Table 2). The bacterial density was grade 1 for 80
(36%), grade 2 for 126 (56%) and grade 3 for 18(8%)
patients. Chronic inflammation was present in 60 (27%)
and chronic active inflammation in 164 (73%).
Correlation of H. pylori genotypes with diagnosis
The virulence marker cagA was significantly associated
with peptic ulcer disease and GC (Table 2). It was positive
in 31(77%) with GC, 20(62%) with GU, 23(72%) with
DU compared to 51(42%) with NUD (p =< 0.001, 0.044
and 0.003 respectively). The vacA allele m1 was significantly positive in patients with GC 29(72%), 29(91%) in
DU and 27(84%) in GU compared to only 50(42%) in
NUD (p = 0.001, <0.001 and <0.001, respectively). The H.
pylori genotype cagAs1am1 was associated with GC in
22(55%) with GC, 11(34%) in DU and 11(34%) in GU
compared to 22(18%) in NUD (p < 0.001, 0.05 and 0.05,
respectively). The H. pylori genotype cagAs1bm1 was associated with GC in 10(25%), 11(34%) in DU and 6(19%)

in GU compared to 5(4%) in NUD (p < 0.001, <0.001 and
0.012, respectively). VacA type i1 was associated with GC
in 33 (82%), GU in 27(85%) and DU in 27(84%) while
vacA type i2 with NUD in 109 (90%) (Table 2). VacAi1
was associated with 17(85%) of the intestinal type of GC
and 16(80%) of the diffuse type. All the GC arising in the
fundus 5(100%), 12(92%) in the antrum and 16(73%) in
the corpus were positive for vacA i1. The prevalence of
mixed infections was indicated by vacA mixed genotype
patterns observed in 39(17%) of the 224 subjects
12(30%) with GC, 11(28%) with GU, 10(26%) with DU
and 6(16%) with NUD.
Correlation of histological changes with diagnosis and H.
pylori genotypes
Marked gastritis with a high inflammatory score was seen
in patients with GC compared to NUD, GU and DU (Fig
1). A high degree of inflammation was seen associated
with the H. pylori vacA genotypes s1am1 and s1bm1 compared to s1am2 and s1bm2 (Fig 2). Similarly, cagAs1am1
and cagAs1bam1 were associated with a higher degree of
inflammation compared to cagAs1am2 and cagAs1bm2
(Fig 3). Intestinal metaplasia was demonstrated in 5(2%)
cases, however, 3(60%) of these cases were associated
with minimal inflammation with 2(2%) diagnosed as
NUD and 1(3%) with GU (Fig 1). Gastric atrophy was
demonstrated in 10(5%) in the body. Lymphoid aggregates were found in 107 (48%).

Sequence analysis of vacA i region PCR product and
BLAST Query
We sequenced PCR product of VacA i1 and i2 with Gene
Bank accession number ACN25129, ACN25130,
ACN25131, ACN25132 and ACN25133. Homology of
the DNA sequences to published sequences was determined by using BLAST window on the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) site at http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/. PCR product sequence
aligned well with the sequences of vacuolating cytotoxin
of different H. pylori strains e.g. ref [NC-000915.1] Helicobacter pylori 26695, ref [NC-000921.1] Helicobacter pylori
J99, ref [NC-008086.1] Helicobacter pylori HPAG1. We randomly selected three vacAi1 and two vacAi2 PCR products
for sequencing. Of the three vacAi1 two were from GC
(GenBank ACN25129, ACN25130) and one from a DU
patient (GenBank ACN25131). The sequences of i region
were almost identical to the vacA gene of strain
60190(GenBank U05676) except for seven mutations
leading to amino acid substitution. Among these
sequences, there were five conserved substitutions of
N84K in cluster B (GTYNLSGL), G121S and S137L in cluster C (GANRTTTRVDFNAKNISID), D171S and K194N in
cluster D (TLQASEGITSDKNAEISLYDGATLNLASNSVKLK). In these strains from GC patients G -to-S, S-to-L
and D-to-S substitutions were found. In strain from NUD
patient with gastritis (GenBank ACN25133) in cluster A,

Discussion
The study of H. pylori virulence factor is important as it is
associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. In

Pakistan, infection with H pylori is frequent among general population and is acquired at an early age. It was
found associated with dyspepsia previously in 66% of our
patients [21]. The majority of our patients presenting with
NUD had gastritis associated with cagA negative H. pylori.
The associated vacA allelic types were vacAs1am1 and
vacAs1bm1 (Table 2). On histology, gastric mucosa demonstrated both chronic and chronic active inflammation
with or without lymphoid aggregate formation (Fig 2).
VacA i region was not detected in 2% of the studied cases.
There was a significant association of the vacA genotype i1
with GC, GU and DU while vacA type i2 with NUD (Table
2). In another study from the northwestern part of the
country, Ahmad et al in a group of 78 dyspeptics with H.
pylori gastritis described a prevalence of positive cagA in
24.2% [22]. The common vacA genotypes were s1bm2 in
(54.2%) and s1am1 in (19.7%) [22]. This is in contrast to

keeping with previous study, only 10(5%) were detected
with genotypes vacAs2m2 and no s2m1 was detected. Also,
in our NUD patients, cagA was not significantly associated
with s1am1 21(41%) (p = 0.201) and majority of vacA
genotypes with s1bm1, s1am2 and s1bm2 were cagA negative. This higher prevalence of cagA may be explained by
not only an increase number of patients in our study but
also that our hospital is a tertiary care referral center with
a large number of patients coming across from the different parts of our country.

Correlation of histological gastritis with H. pylori genotypes
Correlation of histological gastritis with H. pylori
genotypes. *Gastritis score was a total sum of grade of gastritis (mild = 1, moderate = 2, marked = 3 infiltration with
lymphocytes and plasma cells) and activity of gastritis (mild =
1, moderate = 2, marked = 3 infiltration with neutrophilic
granulocytes), a maximum of a sum of 6 points for each individual patient. (Kruskal Wallis test; p = 0.163).

This H. pylori virulence pattern in patients with peptic
ulcer and GC were similar to the one described in Iran,
India and Bangladesh [23-25]. A cagA prevalence of 76%
was found in Iranian isolates [23]. PCR tests indicated that
80 to 90% of Calcutta strains carried the cag pathogenicity
island (PAI) and potentially toxigenic vacAs1 alleles of the
vacA, independent of disease status [24]. In Bangladesh,
cagA was present in 75% of the strains from patients with
peptic ulcer (PU) compared to 55% in patients with NUD,
and 80% from PU carried potentially toxigenic vacAs1
alleles compared to 60% in isolates from patients with
NUD [25]. However, no significant difference in any other
virulence marker was observed in isolates from both
groups. Phylogenetic analysis of the vacA m region and the
5' end of the cagA gene indicated that Bangladeshi isolates
were more closely related to H. pylori isolates from India
and were different from isolates from East Asia [25]. A
relationship was described by Rhead et al between i1 and
GC while Hussein et al finding no such relationship
found i1 associated with GU in Iraq isolates [14,23].
Recently, Basso et al found an association of i1 not only
with GC but also with DU in Italian isolates [26]. Our
results concur with i1 association with GC, GU and DU.

Conclusion

lymphocytes and plasma cells) and activity of gastritis (mild =
1, moderate = 2, marked = 3 infiltration with neutrophilic
granulocytes), a maximum of a sum of 6 points for each individual patient. (Kruskal Wallis test; p = 0.721).

In our patients, the overall prevalence of cagA positive H.
pylori infection is low, 56% compared to over 70% seen in
neighboring countries, Iran, India and Bangladesh. It may
possibly be explained by the lack of genetic predisposition
and/or low frequency of particularly virulent cagA positive
strain in this area. Karachi is a metropolitan city with people from different racial descent migrating to this part of
the country may have resulted in the dilution of particularly virulent strains.
