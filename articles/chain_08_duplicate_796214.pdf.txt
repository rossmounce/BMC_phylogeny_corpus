Abstract
Background: The mechanism by which duplicate genes originate – whether by duplication of a
whole genome or of a genomic segment – influences their genetic fates. To study events that trigger
duplicate gene persistence after whole genome duplication in vertebrates, we have analyzed
molecular evolution and expression of hundreds of persistent duplicate gene pairs in allopolyploid
clawed frogs (Xenopus and Silurana). We collected comparative data that allowed us to tease apart
the molecular events that occurred soon after duplication from those that occurred later on. We
also quantified expression profile divergence of hundreds of paralogs during development and in
different tissues.
Results: Our analyses indicate that persistent duplicates generated by allopolyploidization are
subjected to strong purifying selection soon after duplication. The level of purifying selection is
relaxed compared to a singleton ortholog, but not significantly variable over a period spanning
about 40 million years. Despite persistent functional constraints, however, analysis of paralogous
expression profiles indicates that quantitative aspects of their expression diverged substantially
during this period.
Conclusion: These results offer clues into how vertebrate transcriptomes are sculpted in the
wake of whole genome duplication (WGD), such as those that occurred in our early ancestors.
That functional constraints were relaxed relative to a singleton ortholog but not significantly
different in the early compared to the later stage of duplicate gene evolution suggests that the
timescale for a return to pre-duplication levels is drawn out over tens of millions of years – beyond
the age of these tetraploid species. Quantitative expression divergence can occur soon after WGD
and with a magnitude that is not correlated with the rate of protein sequence divergence. On a
coarse scale, quantitative expression divergence appears to be more prevalent than spatial and
temporal expression divergence, and also faster or more frequent than other processes that
operate at the protein level, such as some types of neofunctionalization.

Background
Gene duplication can catalyze the evolution of novel
function by providing a respite from purifying selection
[1]. The most common fate of a duplicated copy, however,
is nonfunctionalization (pseudogenization), raising the
question of how and why both copies of some duplicates
manage to persist as functional entities. Interestingly,
duplicate gene longevity is positively correlated with the
scale of gene duplication – duplicate genes derived from
whole genome duplication (WGD) typically persist for a
longer period and evade pseudogenization at a higher frequency than those generated by segmental duplication [25]. Therefore it appears that mechanisms that promote
duplicate gene persistence in polyploid genomes are
either different from or more effective than those that
operate on duplicated genes generated by segmental
duplication. This is probably because mechanisms specific to polyploid genomes, such as stoichiometric
requirements/genic balance, increase their longevity [6-9],
whereas characteristics specific to segmental duplicates,
such as incomplete coding regions and regulatory elements decrease theirs [10]. Furthermore, prezygotic isolating mechanisms could increase assortative mating within
ploidy levels [11], facilitating speciation of polyploids
and fixation of their duplicated genome in a new species.
In clawed frogs, for example, second generation backcrossed hybrid females can produce a clutch comprised of
fertile polyploid individuals of both sexes [12,13]. Sympatric speciation could be essentially instantaneous if
these polyploid siblings interbreed and if reproductive
incompatibilities exist between them and the lower
ploidy parental species. In contrast, segmental duplicates
begin as polymorphisms whose probability of fixation
and time to fixation depend on genetic drift and natural
selection [14].
If stoichiometry is important, then an incentive immediately exists to preserve unadulterated versions of both
copies of duplicates generated by WGD. Duplicate genes
could also persist without functional change after duplication if overexpression is advantageous [15,16], if there is
selection against expression of a defective protein [17], or
if neofunctionalized alleles were already segregating prior
to duplication [18]. However, if neofunctionalizing mutations are rare or not very advantageous, or if population
size is small, pre-duplication neofunctionalization is
unlikely to be a common mechanism for duplicate gene
persistence [18,19], although clearly it has occurred [20].
Duplication could also facilitate the resolution of conflicts
that arise from gene sharing – when two distinct protein
phenotypes arise from the same transcriptional unit –
such as if an altered expression level is advantageous in
one tissue but disadvantageous in another [21]. In duplicates generated via WGD by allopolyploidization, heterosis from interactions between diverged subgenomes could

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/43

contribute to duplicate gene longevity without necessitating altered function after duplication [22].
An alternative explanation is that persistence of duplicates
is triggered by genetic modification of one or both paralogs after duplication. For example, duplication could permit each copy of a multifunctional protein to specialize
on a subset of the ancestral activities, thereby reducing
pleiotropy [23,24]. Duplicates might also be preserved if
each paralog degrades in a complementary fashion
[25,26] or if one or both paralogs acquire novel function
[1,27]. The post-duplication neofunctionalization model,
for example, posits that one gene copy carries out the
ancestral function(s), while the other one evolves neutrally and then acquires beneficial mutations by chance
during the early stages of evolution [1]. Once new function is achieved, purifying selection is expected to dominate later stages of evolution. Neofunctionalization could
occur with complete loss, partial degradation, or retention
of ancestral function [28]. The duplication-degenerationcomplementation model, also known as subfunctionalization, posits that after duplication each paralog degenerates in a complementary fashion such that the action of
both is necessary to accomplish the full suite of ancestral
activities [25,29]. Subfunctionalization could occur at the
expression level through degeneration of paralogous
expression profiles in a spatial, temporal, or quantitative
dimension [25,29,30]. It could also occur at the protein
level through complementary degeneration of different
functional domains [25] or as a consequence of activity
compromising substitutions [26]. The cellular location of
expression also has an impact on protein function, and
subcellular relocalization could facilitate or catalyze the
evolution of unique functions in paralogs [31].
If genetic modification triggers the persistence of both
paralogs, it must occur within a few million years after
duplication or else one copy will likely become a pseudogene [6]. Moreover, the tempo of genetic modification
after duplication may be dynamic, wherein changes that
occur when the duplicate is young differ in frequency or
nature from those that occur later on. After subfunctionalization or post-duplication neofunctionalization has
occurred, for example, purifying selection is expected to
increase. Additionally, some of these mechanisms for
duplicate gene retention are not mutually exclusive and
could operate concurrently or sequentially [28,32] and
this could also be associated with temporal changes in
functional constraints. To better understand the genetic
basis of duplicate gene survival, it is therefore useful to
consider their early stages of evolution separately from
their later stages [5,6,33,34]. Comparison of young to old
duplicates suggests that the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions is higher on average in younger duplicates
[6,35,36]. This observation was interpreted as evidence of

relaxed purifying selection immediately after duplication
that was then followed by increased selective constraints
as the duplicates aged. However, because pseudogenization rapidly transforms most young duplicates to singletons, it is not yet clear the degree to which evolution of
young duplicates is indicative of the early stages of evolution of those exceptional duplicates that evade pseudogenization for dozens of millions of years.
To understand why so many duplicates persist after WGD,
such as those that occurred in the ancestor of jawed vertebrates [37], teleost fish [2], and salmonid fish [38], additional information is needed about temporal dynamics in
protein evolution and expression in the earliest stages of
this type of genomic metamorphosis. In particular, we
would like to dissect apart the molecular changes in the
protein-coding region that occurred when persistent
duplicates were young (an early stage of duplicate gene
evolution) from those changes that occurred in the same

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/43

duplicates after they became old (a later stage of duplicate
gene evolution). Also of interest is the question of
whether and how quickly paralogous expression profiles
diverge after WGD. Polyploid clawed frogs (Xenopus and
Silurana) are a useful model for studying early genetic
events in vertebrate WGD because two independent
instances of tetraploidization occurred fairly recently
[32,39] and because subsequent speciation events
occurred after both of these WGDs (Fig. 1A).
Previous studies have used this system to compare molecular evolution before and after WGD [32,40-42]. These
studies indicate that purifying selection on X. laevis paralogs is relaxed compared to single-copy genes in the diploid species S. tropicalis [32,41,42], compared to singlecopy orthologs in mammals [40,42], and compared to
single-copy genes in X. laevis [42]. Using different statistical methods, independent tests on different genes recover
evidence for asymmetric amino acid substitution in 4–6%

Phylogenetic and genealogical relationships of species and paralogs in this study
Phylogenetic and genealogical relationships of species and paralogs in this study. Phylogenetic relationships are depicted among species,
orthologs, and paralogs of a diploid with 20 chromosomes, S. tropicalis (ST), two tetraploids with 40 chromosomes, S. epitropicalis (EP) and S. new tetraploid (NT), and four tetraploids with 36 chromosomes, Xenopus laevis (XL), X. borealis (XB), X. gilli (XG), and X. muelleri (XM). (A) Clawed frogs speciate
by allopolyploidization and by regular speciation without a change in genome size. Allotetraploidization occurred independently in Xenopus and in Silurana
and produced two paralogs in the resulting tetraploid ancestor – α and β – that are indicated as brown and green lineages respectively. After allopolyploidization, some of the diploid lineages probably went extinct, and this is indicated by a dagger. As a result of these extinctions, the portion of some paralogous lineages that evolved in a diploid, indicated as dashed lines, cannot be dissected apart from the portion that evolved in an allopolyploid. Numbered
nodes indicate (0) divergence of the genera Xenopus and Silurana, (1) divergence of the diploid (2n = 18) ancestors of Xenopus, (2) allotetraploidization in
Xenopus, (3) the first speciation event of the tetraploid ancestor of extant Xenopus, (4 and 5) more recent speciation events of Xenopus tetraploids, (6)
divergence of the diploid (2n = 20) ancestors of Silurana, (7) allotetraploidization in Silurana, (8) speciation of a tetraploid Silurana without change in
genome size. Sequences from individual paralogs were used to construct genealogies in order to compare (B) an early to a later stage of evolution after
WGD in XLα, (C) an early to a later stage of evolution after WGD of EPα and (D) an intermediate to a later stage after WGD in XLα. Depending on the
paralog for which data were obtained, sometimes NTα was considered in (C) or XBα was considered in (D).

of expressed paralogs in X. laevis [32,42]. We have used
this system to explore duplicate gene evolution over different time intervals after WGD (tetraploidization), and to
evaluate expression divergence of the resulting paralogs in
X. laevis.

Results
In Xenopus and in Silurana, because a tetraploid ancestor
speciated, the timing of molecular changes that occurred
after allopolyploidization can be dissected apart into two
stages: an "early" stage of duplication – after allopolyploidization but before speciation of the tetraploid ancestor – and a "later" stage of duplicate gene evolution – after
allopolyploidization and speciation of the tetraploid
ancestor (Fig. 1). This permits the testing of alternative
evolutionary scenarios of duplicate gene evolution. Moreover, the likelihood of sequence data can be quantified
under a model with no change in the rate ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution (Ka/Ks ratio)
before versus after tetraploid speciation, and it can be
compared to the likelihood of an alternative model in
which there is a different Ka/Ks ratio during these two
stages of duplicate gene evolution. This analysis is not the
same as a comparison of young to old duplicates, which
involves comparing different genes that were duplicated
at different times – instead it allows comparison of an
early stage of evolution to a later stage of evolution of the
same duplicates.
Synonymous divergence
We collected and analyzed sequence data from fragments
of hundreds of expressed paralogs from multiple species
with an aim of teasing apart early from later mutations in
the protein coding region of persistent paralogs generated
by WGD (Fig. 1). In Xenopus, a concatenated analysis of
80,856 base pairs (bp) of expressed paralogs indicates that
synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks)
between X. laevis paralogs (XLα and XLβ in Fig. 1B) is
0.2111, and Ks between the alpha paralogs of X. laevis and
X. borealis (XLα and XBα in Fig. 1B) is 0.1393. This suggests that Ks between paralogs in the "early" stage of

duplicate gene evolution is up to 0.0718, depending on
the location of node 2 in Fig. 1B. Most synonymous divergence between paralogs therefore accumulated after tetraploidization in Xenopus (see Additional file 1), which
occurred roughly 20 to 40 million years ago [32] or maybe
more [39]. Silurana allotetraploids are about half as old
[39].
Rapid and persistent purifying selection after duplicate
gene evolution
After allopolyploidization, these paralogs were rapidly
(immediately or soon after WGD) subjected to strong
purifying selection. The level of purifying selection, while
relaxed relative to singletons [32,41], did not vary substantially between early and later stages of duplicate gene
evolution.

More specifically, a combined analysis of thousands of
codons from hundreds of expressed paralogs from X. laevis, a X. borealis ortholog, and a S. tropicalis ortholog, indicates that a more parameterized model of sequence
evolution with a higher Ka/Ks ratio during the early stage
of duplicate gene evolution than the later stage is not preferred (P = 1.00, Table 1, Fig. 1B). In fact, a branch-specific
model of evolution indicates that the estimated Ka/Ks
ratio in the early stage of duplicate gene evolution is
slightly lower than in the later stage (Table 1). When these
data were partitioned by gene fragment the results were
the same – there also was not a significant difference in
the Ka/Ks ratio at the early compared to the later stage of
duplicate gene evolution (Table 1). Additionally, a model
in which the Ka/Ks ratio of the early lineage is allowed to
be lower than one is significantly better than a model in
which this rate ratio is fixed at the neutral expectation of
one (P < 0.00001, Table 2) and this analysis also produced the same result when the data were partitioned by
gene fragment (Table 2). Similarly, branch-site models
recover a higher proportion of positively selected sites in
the later lineage (0.00893%) than the early lineage
(0.00061%; data not shown).

Table 1: Comparison of alternatively parameterized models of evolution in Fig. 1 indicates no significant difference in the Ka/Ks ratio
at an early and a later stage of duplicate gene evolution.

Likelihoods of a null model with the Ka/Ks ratio fixed at one at an early stage of duplicate gene evolution and an alternative model with this ratio estimated are indicated.
Species acronyms are the same as in Fig. 1 and abbreviations are the same as in Table 1.

Tests of the individual loci have low power because many
are small fragments (see Additional file 2). Nonetheless,
analyses of 660 fragments from 350 individual loci echo
the results of the analyses of combined multi-locus data.
The distribution of Ka/Ks ratios in the early and later
stages of duplicate gene evolution is similar (Fig. 2A) and
more fragments have a significantly higher Ka/Ks ratio at
a later stage (8 fragments) than at an earlier stage (6 fragments), and this difference is not significant (χ2 test, P =
0.997). Additionally, the number of fragments with a
higher Ka/Ks ratio in the early stage than the later stage
(significant or not) was lower (156 fragments) than the
alternative (262 fragments; P = 1.0; see Additional file 2).
That Ks in the early stage of duplicate gene evolution was
similar to or lower than in the later stage (Fig. 1, see Additional file 3), indicates that sampling bias of synonymous
substitutions [32,43], if present, would bias our analysis
of individual fragments towards detecting a higher Ka/Ks
ratio in the early stage, which is not what we observed.
The neutral expectation (Ka/Ks equal to one) is significantly rejected in the early lineage of 62 out of 136 individual loci with more than 200 bp (see Additional file 2),
and when this ratio is estimated for the early lineage, only
7% of them have an estimated Ka/Ks ratio above one.
Taken together, these results indicate that purifying selection was as strong, if not stronger on these duplicates in
the early stage of their evolution compared to the later
stage.
Early neofunctionalization could potentially result in no
difference between the Ka/Ks ratio in the early and later
stages of duplicate gene evolution if genes in the early
stage experience either positive selection or purifying
selection, whereas genes in the later stage experience
either relaxed purifying selection or purifying selection.
While we can not rule this possibility out because positive
selection and relaxed purifying selection both increase the
Ka/Ks ratio, a regression of Ka/Ks to Ks for each fragment
in the early and later stage of evolution indicates that

(positive + relaxed purifying) selection is less prevalent in
the early stage than the later stage (Fig. 2B).
Radical amino acid substitutions are not more common in
early versus later stages of duplicate gene evolution
New function may be achieved by "radical" substitutions
– replacement of one amino acid with another that has
very different physical properties [24,44]. While this is
certainly not a requirement for new function to evolve, we
nonetheless explored this possibility using a Bayesian
approach to estimate the number and frequencies of elemental substitutions – the 75 amino acid substitutions
that can occur via a single nucleotide change – at an early
and a later stage of duplicate gene evolution, and also in
the diploid lineage (see Additional file 3). Results indicate
that elemental substitutions were not more radical in an
early stage (Mantel Z statistic = 2.4119) than in a later
stage (P = 1.0000). In fact, radical substitutions were
slightly more prevalent in the later lineage (Mantel Z statistic = 2.4680). Elemental substitutions also were not significantly more radical in the entire X. laevis paralog α
lineage (between node 1 and XLα of Fig. 1B, Mantel Z statistic = 2.43823) than in the diploid lineage (between ST
and node 1 in Fig. 1B; Mantel Z statistic = 2.3920, P =
0.1396). Similar results are obtained when the radicalness
of elemental substitutions is categorized according to
alternative criteria [data not shown; [45]].

Simulations were performed to test whether ancestral bias
toward more conservative substitutions in the early stages
of duplicate gene evolution could explain these results,
but this was not the case. Simulated elemental substitutions from a reconstructed ancestral sequence were not
more conservative in the early stage of duplicate gene evolution than the later stage (P = 0.6529). As expected, these
simulations, which were not under purifying selection,
were significantly more radical than the observed data (P
< 0.001).

Binned Ka/Ks of early (blue) and later (red) stages of duplicate gene evolution. (B) Regression of Ka/Ks versus Ks in the early

evolution (blue dots) than the later stage (red dots). The Y-intercept of these regression lines was set to zero and Ka/Ks ratios
greater 2 (including undefined ratios) were given a value of 2. In (A) and (B), a dashed line indicates the neutral expectation.
Fragments with Ka/Ks > 2 are, on average, half of the size of those with Ka/Ks < 2. Ka/Ks ratios above 2 may therefore be
attributable in part to stochastic variance in Ks [43].

Caveats
We performed additional analyses to address various concerns about the sequence dataset from X. laevis, X. borealis,
and S. tropicalis. One consideration is that differences or
changes in population size could affect the Ka/Ks ratio
because slightly deleterious nonsynonymous substitutions are more likely to fix when the effective population
size is small. Based on the geographic distribution and
molecular diversity of mitochondrial DNA [39], the effective population size of X. borealis is smaller than that of X.
laevis. However, we found that the Ka/Ks ratio of X. laevis
paralogs during the later stage was slightly higher
(0.1555) than the corresponding lineage of X. borealis
(0.1338). This discrepancy was not significant in a twosided test (P = 0.1790) or in a one-sided test because we
expected the ratio to be larger in X. borealis (P = 1.0). To
ensure that we were comparing ratios in expressed duplicates in both species, we included in this comparison only
those data for which expression of both paralogs of both
species was confirmed (37,194 bp). We note that more
substitutions of both types occurred in X. borealis suggesting that the overall rate of evolution may be slightly
higher in this species. A lack of significant difference in the
Ka/Ks ratio suggests that the difference in effective population size between X. laevis and X. borealis had a negligible impact on the Ka/Ks ratios of many of their orthologs.

A second consideration stems from the possibility that a
substantial portion of the early lineage of duplicate gene
evolution evolved in a diploid (between nodes 1 and 2 in
Fig. 1B) as a result of the putative allopolyploid origin of
the ancestor of Xenopus tetraploids. Because the Ka/Ks
ratio of clawed frog paralogs is slightly higher after
genome duplication than before it [32,41], the Ka/Ks ratio
of this entire branch (between nodes 1 and 3 in Fig. 1B)
could be lower than the Ka/Ks ratio of the portion of this
branch that evolved after duplication (between nodes 2
and 3 in Fig. 1B). To explore this issue, we analyzed
expressed sequences from another dataset derived from S.
tropicalis and two closely related tetraploids (9717 bp).
Similar to the analysis of X. laevis and X. borealis paralogs,
the branch-specific tests of Silurana paralogs do not provide evidence for an increased Ka/Ks ratio in an early stage
(between nodes 7 and 8 in Fig. 1C) versus a later stage of
duplicate gene evolution (between node 8 and EPα in Fig.
1C; P = 1.0; Table 1), nor an increased frequency of radical
amino acid substitutions at an early stage of duplicate
gene evolution (Mantel Z statistic = 2.7193) compared to
a later stage (Mantel Z statistic = 2.1991, P = 0.0882). Simulations indicate that the early stage of duplicate gene evolution in Silurana was not significantly biased towards
more conservative substitutions (P = 0.5651), the branchsite test recovers no evidence in the concatenated data for
positively selected sites in the early branch (although it
does on the later branch; data not shown), and the parti-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/43

tioned branch model analysis recovers the same results as
the concatenated branch model (Tables 1 and 2). Also
similar to the analysis of X. laevis and X. borealis paralogs,
the branch-specific tests of Silurana paralogs illustrate that
functional constraints during the early stage of duplicate
gene evolution were significantly below neutral expectations (Table 2).
A third consideration is that allotetraploidization of the
common ancestor of Xenopus tetraploids occurred immediately before the first speciation of this ancestor (in other
words that the time between nodes 2 and 3 in Fig. 1B is
very small). If this were the case, then it would be more
informative to compare an "intermediate" stage of duplicate gene evolution – a period after the first tetraploid speciation in Xenopus but before subsequent tetraploid
speciations (i.e. between nodes 3 and 4 in Fig. 1D) – to a
later stage of duplicate gene evolution – after an even
more recent tetraploid speciation event (between node 4
and XLα in Fig. 1D). This issue was addressed with additional sequences (6966 bp) from the tetraploid species X.
gilli and X. muelleri that made possible the further dissection and hypothesis testing of the temporal dynamics of
evolution after duplication (Fig. 1D). Based on their close
phylogenetic relationships [22,39,46], we used X. gilli
when we knew both X. laevis paralogs were expressed, and
we used X. muelleri when we knew both X. borealis paralogs were expressed. Similar to the other analyses, this
comparison revealed that the Ka/Ks ratio is not significantly higher in the intermediate stage compared to the
later stage of duplicate gene evolution (P = 0.16; Table 1)
and that the frequency of radical amino acid substitutions
at the intermediate stage of duplicate gene evolution
(Mantel Z statistic = 2.4073) is not significantly higher
than at a later stage (Mantel Z statistic = 2.0645, P =
0.0887). Simulations again confirm that the intermediate
stage was not significantly biased towards more conservative substitutions (P = 1.0000), the branch-site test recovers no evidence in the concatenated data for positively
selected sites in the early branch or the later branch (data
not shown), and the partitioned branch model analysis
again recovers the same results as the concatenated branch
model (Tables 1 and 2). These additional analyses thus
provide strong support that purifying selection acted rapidly – within millions of years – and persistently – over
tens of millions of years – after WGD in clawed frogs.
Expression divergence
We used microarray data to compare expression profiles
from five developmental stages and adult tissue types
(treatments) of hundreds of paralogous pairs generated by
WGD. Our analyses included developmental treatments
from four distinct developmental stages (egg, tadpole
stage 11, tadpole stage 18, and adult). Unlike the egg and
tadpole stages, however, the adult stage is represented by

data from each type of gonad instead of the entire individual. Because the primordial germ cells appear long after
the tadpole stages that we assayed [stage [44,47]], these
data provide a coarse perspective on spatial expression in
four distinct tissue types: undifferentiated egg, pooled
embryonic tissue (which do not have developed gonads),
adult testis, and adult ovary.
We performed a power analysis to explore the possibility
that cross-hybridization of non-target paralogs could
affect the inference of paralogous expression profiles. We
compared results from (a) a low paralog specificity analysis that included all probes on the microarray, including
ones that cross hybridize to both paralogs, (b) a medium
paralog specificity analysis that excluded probes whose
sequences cross-hybridized to both paralogs, and (c) a
high specificity analysis that excluded probes having up to
three mismatches with a nontarget paralog. Additionally,
we used two intensity thresholds, "standard" and "conservative", as a basis for the detection of expression of
each paralog in each treatment (see Methods).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/43

Qualitative comparisons across this developmental series
and these tissue types indicate that the bulk of paralogous
expression divergence after WGD in clawed frogs is on a
quantitative rather than a temporal dimension (Figs. 3, 4).
This would be expected if these paralogs were expressed in
a highly specific manner in only one of the developmental
stages or tissue types that we analyzed. However, many of
these paralogs were expressed in multiple tissue types and
multiple developmental stages. Consider for instance the
841 paralogous pairs for which the presence/absence
expression profile of each paralog was identical in the
medium and high paralog specificity analyses (Fig. 3). In
the medium specificity analysis at the standard threshold,
94% of these paralogous pairs were both expressed in at
least two treatments and 75% were both expressed in all
five treatments.
When both paralogs are expressed, comparison of their
expression profiles can indicate either that (a) both are

Expression of both paralogs is generally detected in the same treatments, irrespective of the probe specificity (the degree to which
each probe matches one but not the other paralog) or the detection threshold (the minimum raw intensity scored as expressed). These
data are based on (A) "Standard" and (B) "Conservative" threshold levels for detection of expression and three probe specificities were compared that are
labeled low, medium, and high (see Methods). We report paralogous profiles whose presence/absence scores in all five treatments were identical in the
medium and high specificity analysis (shaded in gray on the left of each chart). 1789 and 1462 genes had consistent present/absent expression profiles in the
medium and high specificity analyses using the standard and conservative thresholds. These sets of genes included 841 and 632 paralogous pairs, respectively. The tables on the right compare paralogous profiles by tabulating whether they are both present and absent in the same treatments (identical), the
expression profile of one overlaps entirely with the other (overlap), or paralogs in which each duplicate has a unique component (distinct).

The proportion of Pearson correlation coefficients between non-paralogous expression profiles (white bars) and between paralogous expression profiles (black bars). Ninety percent of the non-paralogous expression profiles have a Pearson correlation coefficient that is greater than -0.861 but less than 0.865. The Pearson

profile of one paralog is a subset of that of the other one
(overlapping spatial and temporal expression), or (c)
both paralogs have distinct components to their expression profiles (distinct spatial and temporal expression). In
the microarray expression data from X. laevis, when
expression of both paralogs was detected, almost all pairs
had identical or overlapping expression profiles in terms
of the developmental stages and tissue types in which
expression was detected (Fig. 3). This was true regardless
of how conservatively we scored presence/absence of
expression or the specificity of the probes on the microarray. Only 2–7% of these pairs included paralogs that both
had a unique expression profile wherein one paralog is
expressed at a developmental stage or a tissue type where
the other one is not expressed, and vice versa (Fig. 3).
In contrast to the overall similarity in the developmental
timing and locations of paralogous expression, quantitative aspects of a high percentage of paralogous pairs have
diverged substantially (Fig. 4). In the medium paralog
specificity analysis for example, 62% of the paralogous
pairs had a Pearson correlation coefficient that was below
0.866, a value below which were 95% of the correlation
coefficients between non-paralogous genes. 27% of the

paralogous pairs had a correlation coefficient below 0.5.
Similar proportions were recovered in the high paralog
specificity analysis (results not shown). At the end of this
extreme, 0.3% of the paralogous pairs (3 pairs) in the
medium paralog specificity analysis had a correlation
coefficient that was more negative than -0.861, a level
below which were only 5% of the correlation coefficients
of the non-paralogous expression profiles. These three
paralogous pairs are expressed in all treatments according
to the standard detection threshold and have the followand

with RNA splicing and the third pair has sequence similarity to collagen alpha(1) precursor. The normalized expression level of each pair indicates that in most of these
treatments, the expression of one paralog is above the
median expression level of that paralog across the five
treatments whereas the expression of the other paralog is
below it.

Discussion
Neutral evolution of gene duplicates eventually leads to
pseudogenization of one copy, and the time for this to
occur depends on the size of the mutational target
(sequence and length of the gene and the level of degeneracy of cis-regulatory elements), the rate and biases of
molecular evolution (such as the rates of nucleotide substitution, insertions/deletions, and transposable element
mobility), and the effective population size of the species
(pseudogenes take longer to fix in larger populations) [4850]. Non-neutral evolution, however, can curtail pseudogenization. In polyploid clawed frogs, duplicates generated by WGD are subject to more severe functional
constraints than the neutral expectation, even though
these constraints are relaxed relative to a singleton gene
[this study; [32,40-42]]. Furthermore, even though the
typical half-life of duplicates from a variety of organisms
[6] is much lower than the time since tetraploidization of
clawed frogs, it is clear that many paralogous pairs are still
expressed in Xenopus [32,40-42], suggesting the action of
natural selection to preserve their expression. If these paralogs are retained for enough time, functional constraints
presumably would increase to a pre-WGD level. However,
here we demonstrate that these constraints did not substantially fluctuate for dozens of millions of years following genome duplication.
One explanation for this observation is that the early
stages of duplicate gene evolution occurred before these
genomes became disomic (diploidized), and that this
resulted in increased purifying selection on both duplicates in the early stages of their evolution. Indeed, some
chromosomes may take longer than others to evolve disomic inheritance after WGD [3,51,52] and polysomic
inheritance has been reported at one locus in the dodecaploid species X. ruwenzoriensis [53]. However, we removed
from our analysis sequences that exhibited signs of gene
conversion or recombination (see Additional file 3) –
events that might indicate polysomic rather than disomic
inheritance. Additionally, disomic inheritance can occur
instantly or soon after WGD by allopolyploidization [54]
and disomic inheritance of alleles occurs immediately in
laboratory generated polyploids of Xenopus [55]. These
observations argue against functional constraints on these
paralogs being buoyed by polysomic inheritance in an
early stage after allotetraploidization.
The stasis of functional constraints over these early stages
of paralog evolution in clawed frogs contrasts sharply
with studies of young and older duplicates generated from
WGD in non-vertebrates and from segmental duplication
in vertebrates. For example, over a level of synonymous
divergence similar to Xenopus paralogs, older paralogs of
the fungus and plant polyploids Saccharomyces cerevisae
and Arabidopsis thaliana are more constrained than

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/43

younger ones [6]. Likewise, human paralogs with synonymous divergence between 0.05 and 0.1 have a Ka/Ks ratio
of about 0.47 but those with synonymous divergence
between 0.1 and 0.5 are more constrained with a Ka/Ks
ratio of about 0.37 [35]. Although those comparisons
involve different sets of genes in each taxon, it is worth
noting that functional constraints immediately after WGD
are more severe in Xenopus paralogs, which have a lower
Ka/Ks ratio of 0.105 – 0.158 (Table 1). These results suggest that (a) the evolutionary trajectories of duplicates
generated by segmental duplication differ from those of
paralogs generated by WGD and/or that (b) the early stage
of evolution of duplicates that are destined to persist differs substantially from that of most young duplicates (the
bulk of which rapidly degenerate to singletons). These
results are consistent with the observation that young paralogs that evolve quickly are less likely to be retained in
the long run [35,56-58]. Stoichiometric constraints/genic
balance is one plausible explanation for more severe and
persistent functional constraints on WGD paralogs in
clawed frogs as compared to singletons in other organisms [6-8].
Temporal dynamics of molecular evolution of expressed
duplicates appear to differ in frogs (this study) and yeast
[59]. While purifying selection is relaxed after WGD in
yeast and in X. laevis, nonsynonymous substitutions were
more prevalent during an early stage of duplicate gene
evolution than a later stage in yeast [59] but not in X. laevis (this study). There are multiple possible explanations
for this difference. Because the yeast species examined in
[59] have a larger effective population size than the frogs
we studied, purifying selection in frogs would have to be
stronger in order to substantially curtail the fixation of
slightly deleterious nonsynonymous substitutions by
genetic drift. Perhaps then, the initial phase of duplicate
gene evolution – a period during which purifying selection is relaxed compared to singletons but before postWGD increases in functional constraints are apparent at a
molecular level – is more drawn out in frogs than in yeast
as a consequence of their different population sizes.
Another possibility is that the selective regime following
WGD varies between yeast and frogs as a result of fundamental differences in the nexus of protein-protein interactions, functional specialization, complexity, and/or
redundancy. It is also possible that the periods of time
after WGD that were compared in each of these studies
could differ substantially.
If post-duplication neofunctionalization of protein structure is to promote the persistence of both paralogs, amino
acid changing nucleotide substitutions must occur in at
least one paralog soon after duplication, and this should
be followed by increased purifying selection once new
function is acquired [1,60]. Molecular signs of neofunc-

tionalization of protein structure may include a higher
Ka/Ks ratio in early than in later stages of duplicate gene
evolution, a higher frequency of radical amino acid
changes in early than in later stages of duplicate gene evolution, and/or significantly different rates of nonsynonymous substitution between paralogs. In clawed frogs,
multiple lines of evidence suggest that this mechanism is
not a prevalent trigger for the persistence of duplicates
generated in the initial millions of years after WGD. First,
in the early stage of duplicate gene evolution in X. laevis
only a handful of these persistent paralogs have a Ka/Ks
ratio greater than one (i.e. consistent with positive selection; see Additional file 2) and a higher proportion of sites
exhibit evidence of positive selection in the later stage of
duplicate gene evolution than in the early stage (data not
shown). Of course, the Ka/Ks ratio is a very rough metric
of positive selection and new protein function could arise
by neutral evolution, even via very few amino acid substitutions [61]. However, similar to yeast [59], radical amino
acid substitutions are not more prevalent in the early stage
of duplicate gene evolution. We also did not observe
increased purifying selection in the later stage of duplicate
gene evolution that would be expected if neofunctionalization occurred in the early stage after WGD. Similarly in
yeast, duplicates with a level of divergence similar to X.
laevis paralogs (Ks < 0.25), subfunctionalization as
opposed to neofunctionalization is suggested by a loss of
shared interactions [28,62].
These analyses recover a much higher incidence of quantitative divergence than the 14% suggested by [41], but
they are similar to another study that suggests 40–50%
quantitative expression divergence [42]. Hellsten et al.
[42] found evidence of spatial expression divergence in
four out of six in situ hybridizations, whereas we recovered
this type of expression divergence – where each paralog
has a unique component to its expression domain – in
only 2–7% of the paralogs (Fig. 3). This disparity is in part
a consequence of lack of resolution in the microarray data
that we analyzed relative to in situ hybridization performed by [42]. Spatial and temporal expression subfunctionalization may be more common on a finer spatial or
temporal scale than we were able to detect with these
microarray data.
Unequal expression and low correlation of paralogous
expression profiles has also been reported in several allopolyploid plants [63,64]. Genome duplication in plants is
associated with non-additive changes in gene expression,
suggesting that expression divergence between paralogs
can immediately accompany allopolyploidization [6567]. In synthetic allopolyploid Arabidopsis, for example,
expression of over 5% of genes in synthetic allopolyploid
lines deviated from the midpoint of each parental species
[65]. In the recently formed allohexaploid plant species

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/43

Senecio cambrensis, expression analysis of re-synthesized
lines suggests that the impact of hybridization and
genome duplication on expression divergence are distinct,
and that the latter phenomenon can reduce expression
divergence, at least in the early stages of polyploid evolution [68]. Later on, for example in Arabidopsis thaliana
which experienced WGD between 20 and 60 million years
ago, 57% of the resulting duplicates have an expression
profile with a correlation coefficient less than 0.52 [64].
Likewise in yeast the correlation between paralogous
expression profiles is lower than 0.5 in 55% of pairs that
have a similar level of synonymous divergence (0.1–0.3)
as the X. laevis paralogs in this study [69]. Substantial
quantitative expression divergence between paralogs soon
after WGD therefore does not appear to be unique to X.
laevis, and is likely the culmination of divergence over
evolutionary time and also divergence that occurred
immediately upon allopolyploidization.
Without additional information on expression profiles of
orthologous genes, at this point we cannot determine
whether the observed spatial and temporal expression
divergence arose through expansion (expression neofunctionalization) or degradation (expression subfunctionalization) of each expression profile or both. In yeast,
expression neofunctionalization occurs via recruitment of
cis-regulatory elements, but this appears to take a long
time [70]. In human paralogs that are more diverged (Ks
> 0.25) than the ones we studied here, the combined
expression domains of segmental duplicates is typically
larger than that of singletons, and the magnitude of this
difference is positively correlated with synonymous divergence, suggesting expression neofunctionalization [28].
Expression divergence is correlated with synonymous and
nonsynonymous divergence in yeast duplicates with Ka ≤
0.3 or Ks < 1.5 [69], and this correlation has also been
recovered in humans over similar levels of divergence
[71]. However, we did not find this correlation in X. laevis
paralogs (see Additional file 4). This difference could
derive from distinct genetic fates of duplicates generated
by WGD versus segmental duplication on either an
expression or functional level [72]. Other factors that
could play a role in the degree to which paralogous
expression profiles diverge over time include tissue-specific developmental constraints [73], expression intensity
and specificity [74], and the essentiality of a paralog's
gene family [58].

Conclusion
It has been suggested that allopolyploidization rather
than autopolyploidization preceded the diversification of
jawed vertebrates [75]. Allopolyploids have the advantage
that diploidization might occur instantly or more rapidly
than in autopolyploids, thereby preventing complications
associated with mis-segregation of chromosomes in a

polysomic genome [54]. By analogy, duplicate gene evolution in allopolyploid clawed frogs offers insights into
how the transcriptome of our ancient ancestors may have
been sculpted in the wake of these genomic metamorphoses [1,37], and also after subsequent WGDs in other
vertebrates [2,76]. To the extent that this analogy applies,
the initial dozens of millions of vertebrate evolution after
WGD were likely characterized by strong and persistent
functional constraints at the amino acid level. Despite
these functional constraints, however, quantitative
expression divergence probably occurred in many duplicates during this period and, as has been suggested [3], the
magnitude of regulatory and structural change was not
correlated (see Additional file 4). We speculate therefore
that stoichiometric requirements and quantitative expression subfunctionalization commonly trigger persistence
of WGD paralogs in the earliest stages of their existence.
Following WGD, it appears that other mechanisms that
trigger the retention of duplicate genes, such as neofunctionalization of the coding region or spatial expression
subfunctionalization [e. g. [25,28,77-79]], tend to operate
less frequently, later, or over a longer period of time. Interestingly, analysis of teleost paralogs demonstrates that
duplicates continue to be lost over hundreds of millions
of years [78], indicating that the steadfast functional constraints and substantial expression dynamics soon after
vertebrate WGD do not immortalize these duplicates.

Methods
Molecular data
We compiled sequences of expressed paralogs of X. laevis
from Genbank and various publications[32,41,42] and
aligned them with orthologs from the S. tropicalis genome
assembly 4.1. 454 pyrosequencing was used to obtain
sequences of fragments of expressed paralogs of X. borealis
from testis cDNA and contigs were assembled from these
data using BLAST [80] and ALIGN0 [81] from the FASTA
2.0 package [82], and manual alignment in MacClade
[83]. Manufacturer protocols were followed to isolate
RNA using an RNA extraction kit (Qiagen), to prepare
cDNA using BD SMART PCR cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech), and to normalize the cDNA using the Trimmer
cDNA normalization kit (Evrogen JCS). Additional targeted sequencing of paralogs from X. laevis, X. borealis, X.
gilli, X. muelleri, S. epitropicalis, and S. new tetraploid was
performed by co-amplifying portions of these paralogs
from cDNA from a variety of tissues (blood, heart, brain,
testis, liver, muscle). Portions of individual paralogs were
then cloned with the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and
sequenced. These data are deposited in Genbank (see
Additional file 2).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/43

fragments of 350 expressed paralogous pairs from the
tetraploid X. laevis, one expressed paralog from the tetraploid X. borealis, and an ortholog from the diploid S. tropicalis. An additional 9,717 bp were sequenced from
portions of thirteen expressed duplicated loci of the tetraploids S. epitropicalis and S. new tetraploid, and 6,966 bp
were sequenced from portions of nine expressed duplicated loci of the tetraploids X. muelleri or X. gilli. To minimize analysis of paralogs whose evolutionary history may
have been homogenized by gene conversion or recombination, we excluded from our analysis sequences with
signs of these phenomena (see Additional file 1).
Because data were usually obtained from only one
expressed X. borealis paralog but two X. laevis paralogs,
most of our molecular analyses focused on molecular evolution of one X. laevis paralog – the "α" paralog (Fig. 1B).
This is because, without evidence of expression of the
other X. borealis paralog, we do not know whether X. borealis paralog α is still an expressed duplicate, and we also
cannot determine at what point after duplication nonsyonymous substitutions occurred in the other X. laevis paralog – paralog "β" (Fig. 1B). Phylogenetic methods
(maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood) were used
to identify to which one of the expressed X. laevis paralogs
that the X. borealis paralog was most closely related.
Models of evolution
To test whether the rate ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions per site (hereafter the Ka/Ks ratio)
differs at early versus later stages of duplicate gene evolution, the likelihood of alternative models of branch-specific evolution (Fig. 1) was calculated using PAML version
3.15 [84]. This analysis was performed on concatenated
datasets and with the data partitioned by gene fragment.
We also used the branch-site test for positive selection
[test [2] in [85]] to test whether there were more sites
under positive selection at an early stage compared to a
later stage of duplicate gene evolution. In addition, we
tested for significant departure from neutrality by comparing a model in which the Ka/Ks ratio of the early lineage
was fixed at one and another Ka/Ks ratio was estimated for
all other branches, to a model in which one Ka/Ks ratio
was estimated for the early branch and another ratio was
again estimated for all other branches. For each comparison, significance of the more parameterized model was
evaluated with a χ2 test. Note that, as a result of a suspected allotetraploid origin of the ancestor of X. laevis and
X. borealis, an unknown portion of the early lineage probably evolved in a diploid species; the potential impact of
this and other caveats was explored with additional comparative data and analyses (Figs. 1C, D).

Using a combination of targeted amplification, cloning,
and sequencing of cDNA, 454 pyrosequencing of cDNA,
and database searches, 80,856 bp were collected from 660

Expression analyses
We collected expression data from previous studies that
used a X. laevis microarray prefabricated by Affymetrix
[86-88]. Expression data was analyzed from five developmental stages or tissue types: egg, embryonic stages 11 and
18, adult testis, and adult ovary. Raw intensity data were
converted to CEL files using GeneChip Operation System
software (GCOS v. 1.4 Affymetrix). The robust multi array
average (RMA) algorithm was implemented to quantify
gene expression in GeneSpring version GX7.3 (Agilent,
Inc) using either the Affymetrix library file or custom CDF
files ("probe masks") that were generated following Hammond et al. [89]. The data were then normalized to the
median of each gene across all arrays and the 50th percentile of each array. A high intra-treatment correlation (R2 =
92–98%) was found between the biological replicates for
each treatment.

The Affymetrix X. laevis microarray consists of "probe sets"
that are composed of 16 "probe pairs", each of which
includes a 25 base pair oligo that is intended to perfectly
match the target sequence. Cross hybridization of paralogs could homogenize their expression profiles if it is
bidirectional or could amplify differences between them if
it is unidirectional. To explore this possibility, we performed a power analysis in which we used probe masks to
evaluate paralog specificity of each probe set – i.e. the
degree to which the probes on the microarray match one
paralog but not the other. We tested three paralog specificities: "low", "medium", and "high". The low paralog specificity analysis included probes that exactly matched
(and cross-hybridize to) both paralogs. The medium paralog specificity analysis excluded probes that exactly
matched both paralogs. The high paralog specificity analysis excluded probes that perfectly matched both paralogs
and also those that had up to and including three mismatches with the non-target paralog. We required each
probe set in our analysis to have a minimum of at least 8
probe pairs (and up to 16) at the highest specificity. These
probe masks were developed based on comparisons of the
probe sequences to a sequences of expressed paralog pairs
from previous publications [32,41,42] that were carried
out using BLAST searches [80]. We evaluated each of these
probe specificities under two thresholds for calling presence/absence of expression ("standard" and "conservative" thresholds; Fig. 3). For the "standard" threshold, a
paralog was scored as expressed if its raw intensity was
above a background level of 50. For the "conservative"
threshold, a paralog was scored as expressed if its raw
intensity was above a background level of 200. We note
that these thresholds are somewhat arbitrary because
some probesets may hybridize with lower affinities than
others, and therefore recover lower than background raw
intensities even though a transcript is in fact expressed.
This approach therefore provides only a rough metric of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/43

whether or not a transcript is expressed. The Pearson correlation coefficients provide an alternative extreme,
because they are based on the expression intensities in all
treatments (even those that have below-background raw
intensities). These correlation coefficients therefore must
be interpreted with the caveat that higher correlations
between tissue profiles could be obtained when neither
transcript is expressed in many treatments. To contextualize the paralogous correlations, we also calculated the
Pearson correlation coefficients between all non-parlaogous expression profiles as in [64].

Binned rates of synonymous substitution per site (Ks) of paralog α of
gene fragments greater than 200 bp suggest that Ks is lower in the
early stage than in the later stage. Ks values were calculated using a free
ratio model on the phylogeny depicted in Fig. 1B in which Ks is estimated
independently for each branch. The early stage of evolution (blue bars)
corresponds with the paralog α lineage between node 1 and 3 and the later
stage of evolution (red bars) corresponds with the XLα lineage between
node 3 and XLα.

No correlation between expression divergence and (A) Ka, (B) Ks, or
(C) Ka/Ks (R2 ≅ 0.0002 and P > 0.50 for all correlations). Expression
divergence is quantified by ln(1+R)/(1-R) where R is the Pearson correlation coefficient between each paralogous expression profile [69]. In (C)
two outliers that have a Ka/Ks ratio over 1 are excluded. There also is not
a significant correlation between the Ka/Ks ratio and ln(1+R)/(1-R)
(data not shown). Ka/Ks ratios were calculated from complete or large
fragments of expressed X. laevis paralogs; the average length of these
sequences was 1119 bp.
