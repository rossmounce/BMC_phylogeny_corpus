Abstract
Background: Acute changes in environmental parameters (e.g., O2, pH, UV, osmolarity, nutrients,
etc.) evoke a common transcriptomic response in yeast referred to as the "environmental stress
response" (ESR) or "common environmental response" (CER). Why such a diverse array of insults
should elicit a common transcriptional response remains enigmatic. Previous functional analyses of
the networks involved have found that, in addition to up-regulating those for mitigating the specific
stressor, the majority appear to be involved in balancing energetic supply and demand and
modulating progression through the cell cycle. Here we compared functional and regulatory
aspects of the stress responses elicited by the acute inhibition of respiration with antimycin A and
oxygen deprivation under catabolite non-repressed (galactose) conditions.
Results: Gene network analyses of the transcriptomic responses revealed both treatments result
in the transient (10 – 60 min) down-regulation of MBF- and SBF-regulated networks involved in the
G1/S transition of the cell cycle as well as Fhl1 and PAC/RRPE-associated networks involved in
energetically costly programs of ribosomal biogenesis and protein synthesis. Simultaneously, Msn2/
4 networks involved in hexose import/dissimilation, reserve energy regulation, and autophagy were
transiently up-regulated. Interestingly, when cells were treated with antimycin A well before
experiencing anaerobiosis these networks subsequently failed to respond to oxygen deprivation.
These results suggest the transient stress response is elicited by the acute inhibition of respiration
and, we postulate, changes in cellular energetics and/or the instantaneous growth rate, not oxygen
deprivation per se. After a considerable delay (≥ 1 generation) under anoxia, predictable changes in
heme-regulated gene networks (e.g., Hap1, Hap2/3/4/5, Mot3, Rox1 and Upc2) were observed
both in the presence and absence of antimycin A.
Conclusion: This study not only differentiates between the gene networks that respond to
respiratory inhibition and those that respond to oxygen deprivation but suggests the function of
the ESR or CER is to balance energetic supply/demand and coordinate growth with the cell cycle,
whether in response to perturbations that disrupt catabolic pathways or those that require rapidly
up-regulating energetically costly programs for combating specific stressors.

Background

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/627

stores that elicits the ESR/CER under these conditions, not
the withdrawal of oxygen. In other words, that it is the
abrupt inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and associated changes in cellular energetics that triggers this ESR/
CER-like response, not changes in growth rate per se.

Previous studies with Saccharomyces cerevisiae have found
that a common transcriptomic program is initiated in
response to a diverse array of environmental challenges.
These include temperature shock, osmotic or oxidative
stress, low pH, DNA damaging agents, nutrient starvation,
a switch to lower quality carbon sources, and oxygen deprivation under catabolite non-repressed conditions [1-6].
This program has been called the "environmental stress
response" (ESR) [2] or "common environmental
response" (CER) [4], but the factors responsible for initiating the response and the function of its various components remain unclear. Our previous gene network
analyses of an ESR/CER-like response elicited by anaerobiosis [5,6] suggest it is involved in rebalancing energy
supply and demand in response to an abrupt change in
cellular energy status while concomitantly coordinating
growth rate and entry into the cell cycle. Although not
measured in most studies, acute yet transient changes in
the cellular energetics would be expected to occur in
response to any perturbations that disrupt catabolic pathways for producing energy (e.g., anaerobiosis, glucose
starvation, or a switch to a lower quality energy source) or
when survival depends on rapidly up-regulating energetically costly programs for combating specific stressors (e.g.,
temperature shock, osmotic or oxidative stress, DNA damaging agents, etc.). Thus, a common metabolic consequence that would be predicted to result from any of these
environmental challenges is an abrupt, although transitory, decrease in energy that would require compensatory
actions for survival.

Further support comes from functional and gene network
analyses of the anaerobic response in galactose [5,6].
Using a novel clustering approach for recovering active
gene networks, as well as knockouts of selected transcription factors [5], we revealed the ESR/CER-like response is
comprised of the transient up-regulation of Msn2/4-regulated networks involved in both hexose import/dissimilation and reserve energy regulation as well as the transient
down-regulation of Fhl1 and PAC/RRPE-associated networks involved in energetically costly programs for ribosomal biogenesis and protein synthesis. In addition, MBFand SBF-regulated networks involved in the G1/S transition of the cell cycle are also transiently down-regulated,
resulting in a delay of its progression as mass (e.g., glycogen and trehalose stores) and energy are assessed before
committing to another round of the cycle. Given their
function, these results suggest that transient changes in
the activity of these gene networks are required for balancing energy supply and demand and coordinating growth
with progression through the cell cycle during the abrupt
switch to strictly fermentative growth. Additional support
comes from a study that found that treatment with the
cytochrome bc1 inhibitor myxothiazol under normoxia in
galactose grown cells also elicits a transient response in
many of the genes that comprise the ESR/CER [10].

Further support comes from the fact that the acute withdrawal of oxygen does not elicit such a response under catabolite-repressed conditions (glucose) but does under
non-repressed conditions (galactose) [5,6]. A fundamental difference in the metabolism of these sugars that may
explain this difference is the fact that oxygen deprivation
does not substantially affect the overall yield or rate of
ATP formation from glucose dissimilation but does
severely limit both during galactose dissimilation. Thus,
when cells are grown in glucose the aerobic-to-anaerobic
transition proceeds without a change in growth rate [5,6],
but in galactose the rapid withdrawal of oxygen results in
the abrupt decrease in energy production and slowing of
growth to a rate that is nearly half of that supported by
mixed respiro-fermentative metabolism [5,6]. Although
several recent studies have suggested that the ESR is
evoked by growth rate differences [7], if this were true it is
difficult to reconcile the fact these networks are not differentially expressed between the much faster respiro-fermentative growth phase in galactose and the slower
fermentative growth phase but rather only transiently
respond during the change [8,9]. An alternative explanation is that it is the abrupt decrease in cellular energy

To further investigate the regulatory factors involved and
distinguish between networks that respond to oxygen
deprivation and those that respond to the abrupt cessation of respiration, we poisoned the respiratory chain with
the cytochrome bc1 inhibitor antimycin A and conducted
a temporal analysis of the transcriptomic response over
three generations of aerobiosis followed by three generations of anaerobiosis. This treatment served several purposes. First, poisoning respiration under normoxic
conditions mimics the loss of respiratory-dependent
energy production that occurs during the shift to anaerobiosis, independent of a change in oxygen availability.
Given that changes in the activity of more chronically
responding gene networks are observed within three generations of anaerobic growth [6], assaying gene expression
over this period should allow us to differentiate between
networks that respond to the cessation of respiration and
any that may respond to the chronic loss of respiratory
capacity, independent of a change in oxygen availability.
Moreover, by then shifting the respiratory incompetent
cells to anaerobiosis and assaying gene expression over
three additional generations of growth, we should be able
to distinguish between any networks that acutely respond

to the loss of oxygen and those that more chronically
respond to oxygen-dependent changes in cellular heme
concentrations, for example those that are regulated by
Hap1, Hap2/3/4/5, Rox1, Upc2 and Mot3 [6]. Overall, we
expected and found that the same ESR/CER gene networks
respond to poisoning of the respiratory chain under normoxia as to the shift to anoxia in the absence of inhibitor,
networks that appear to be involved in balancing energy
supply and demand, growth rate, and progression
through the cell cycle.

Results
Statistical comparisons of the transcriptomic responses
To compare the dynamics of the transcriptomic responses
elicited by antimycin A treatment and anaerobiosis [6],
we harvested samples after the same number of generations following each treatment as previously we had
shown such a growth-rate dependent alignment is superior to time-dependent alignments ([5] see also [7]). Separate ANOVAs were conducted to identify genes whose
transcript levels responded significantly (P ≤ 0.01 after
step-down Bonferroni adjustment) to each treatment. In
total, 1754 genes were found to respond significantly at
one or more time points to anaerobiosis, 901 to antimycin A treatment in air, and 669 to anaerobiosis in the presence of antimycin A.

Figure 1 compares the overall dynamics of each response
expressed as the number of genes that were differentially
expressed in each sample. Note that black bars indicate
genes that responded significantly for the first time and
gray those that had already responded at a previous time
point yet continued to be differentially expressed with
respect to the control. From this figure it is clear that the
transcriptomic response to anaerobiosis in galactose
medium is biphasic (Figure 1A) as was previously
observed [6]. The first phase is comprised of a large set of
genes (> 900) that exhibit an acute (0.04 – 0.08 generations) yet transient (< 0.25 generations) response. After a
considerable delay (≥ 0.25 generations), a second, smaller
set of genes (> 400) is then differentially expressed, most
for the duration of anaerobiosis. In comparison, the transcriptomic response to antimycin A treatment in air (Figure 1B) is monophasic and, as anticipated, similar to the
dynamics of the acute phase of the anaerobic response.
Peak numbers of newly responding genes (black bars)
appear at 0.08 generations, the same as for the acute
anaerobic response (Figure 1A).
Comparison of Figure 1C with 1A shows the presence of
antimycin A drastically alters the anaerobic response; the
large numbers of transiently responding genes observed
in Figure 1A are conspicuously absent, leaving only those
that respond after a substantial delay (2 generations).
Interestingly, the dynamics of this response is remarkably

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/627

similar to that elicited by anoxia in catabolite-repressed
cells [5,6]. Taken together these results suggest that the
acute, transient transcriptomic response observed in Figures 1A and 1B is evoked by the inhibition of respiration,
whether by chemical means (antimycin A) under normoxic conditions (Figure 1B) or the rapid removal of oxygen from respiratory competent cells (Figure 1A), whereas
the delayed, chronic phase (Figures 1A and 1C) is invoked
by oxygen deprivation.
To further explore the composition of these networks, we
divided the anaerobic gene set into those that responded
acutely (≤ 0.25 generations) and those that responded
more chronically (> 0.25 generations) and examined their
overlap with those that responded to the antimycin A
treatments. Figure 2 shows 67% of those that responded
to the antimycin A treatment in air (light gray circle, left)
exhibited an acute anaerobic response (bottom left)
whereas 53% of those that responded to the subsequent
shift to anaerobiosis (dark gray circle on right) exhibited a
delayed anaerobic response (bottom right). Although the
distinction between the acute and chronic phases is not
absolute (Figure 2 open circles, lower portion), what is
clear is that many of the same genes respond acutely to
either anaerobiosis or antimycin A treatment in air. Moreover, the acute response is abolished by adding antimycin
A well before (3 generations) shifting the cells to anaerobiosis. To next determine if the same transcriptional networks respond to these treatments, we separately
clustered the temporal responses.
Gene network discovery
Gene networks were recovered using a novel bioinformatic approach [5,6] that uses SOM to cluster the temporal profiles and then determines an appropriate level of
granularity (number of clusters) by choosing that which
results in the least likely configuration of transcription factor binding sites (TFMs) among gene clusters as compared
to random chance alone [see Additional files 1 and 2 and
reference [6] for further details]. For the anaerobic data
set, the clustered expression profiles are shown in Figure

3A (left heat map; anaerobic clusters C N 2 1 – 13). The figure also includes an abbreviated list of significantly (P ≤
0.01) enriched TFMs (blue text to the left of each heat
map) and overrepresented (P ≤ 0.01) MIPS functional categories (right). Complete results, including statistics and
gene-to-cluster membership, are provided in Additional
files 3, 4, 5, 6. To facilitate direct comparisons of the two
antimycin A treatments to anaerobiosis, Figure 3A not
only shows the clustered expression profiles of genes that
responded to anaerobiosis (N2, left heatmap) but the
response of these same genes to antimycin A treatment in

Comparison
Comparison of genes that comprise the acute, transient phase of the anaerobic response with those that
respond to antimycin A treatment in air and subsequent anaerobiosis. Genes that responded within the first 0.25
generations of anaerobiosis were classified as acutely responding (acute N2) whereas those that responded after this period
were classified as chronically responding (chronic N2) (see Figure 1A for phase dynamics). Genes that comprise each of these
classes are compared to those that responded to the antimycin A treatments (light gray for air and darker gray for N2). The

the black bars to the left of each heat map responded significantly (P ≤ 0.01) in the presence of inhibitor. Finally,

Figure 3B shows the clustered expression profiles and
recovered gene networks for the 901 genes that responded
significantly to antimycin A treatment in air ( C A-O 2 1 – 6)

antimycin A treatment in air (B), and subsequent anaerobiosis in the presence of antimycin A (C). The temporal
profiles of genes whose transcript levels responded significantly (P ≤ 0.01) to each treatment were clustered separately using
Kohonen's SOM algorithm with 1D string topology and standard correlation as the distance metric. Appropriate K values for
gene network discovery were determined by evaluating CS and FCS using a range of K values (2 – 30) (see "Materials and
Methods"). Figure 3A compares the response of all genes that significantly responded to anaerobiosis (N2, far left) to their
response to antimycin A treatment in air (middle panel) and to subsequent anaerobiosis in the presence of antimycin A (right
panel). Note that only those genes denoted by a black bar responded significantly to the indicated treatment (A + Air = antimycin A under aerobiosis, N2 + A = antimycin A under anaerobiosis, and N2 = anaerobiosis). The blue text is an abridged list of
transcription factor motifs (TFMs, left) and MIPS functional categories (MIPS Function, right) that were significantly (P ≤ 0.01)
overrepresented in each gene cluster. Panel B shows the clustering results for all genes that significantly responded to antimycin A treatment in air while panel C shows that for those significantly responded to anaerobiosis in the presence of antimycin
A. The time scale is the number of generations after the indicated treatment.

Comparison of the left (anaerobic) and middle (antimycin A + air) heat maps in Figure 3A shows that most of the
genes that transiently responded to anaerobiosis ( C N 2 1 –
4 and C N 2 7 – 9) responded in a similar manner to
antimycin A treatment in air. In contrast, few of those that
exhibited a delayed, chronic response ( C N 2 5 – 6 and

C N 2 10 – 13) were differentially expressed in response to
inhibitor treatment in air. These trends are almost totally
reversed for the N2 + antimycin A treatment (right heatmap in Figure 3A) as can be easily seen by comparing the
distribution of the significance indicators (black bars)
among gene clusters for each treatment.
In regard to the recovered gene networks, comparison of
Figure 3A with 3B indicates the same or similar TFMs and
MIPS functional categories were enriched in clusters of
genes that transiently responded. From this and previous
studies of the anaerobic response [5,6], a common picture
of gene network activity emerges. For example, both
anaerobiosis and antimycin A treatment in air result in the
transient down-regulation of MCB- and SCB-regulated
networks ( C N 2 1 and C A-O 2 1) involved in processes associated with the G1/S transition of the cell cycle (e.g., DNA
synthesis & replication). In addition, Abf1 and PAC/
RRPE-associated networks ( C N 2 2 – 4 and C A-O 2 2 & 3)
involved in energetically costly programs of rRNA transcription/processing, translation, and ribosomal biogenesis are apparently also down-regulated. Finally, both
treatments apparently result in the transient induction of
Msn2/4-regulated networks ( C N 2 8 – 10 and C A-O 2 4 & 5)
involved in carbohydrate and reserve energy (trehalose
and glycogen) metabolism/transport and autophagy.
In contrast, networks that more chronically responded to
anaerobiosis, in particular those with identifiable hemeresponsive transcription factor binding sites (eg., Hap1 for
C N 2 5, and Rox1 and Upc2 for C N 2 10 – 13), failed to
respond to the antimycin A treatment in air (Figure 3B)
but were recovered from clustering the response to
antimycin A treatment in N2 (Hap1 in C A-N 2 2, Rox1 in

C A-N 2 7, and Upc2 in C A-N 2 9 in Figure 3C). A comparison of these heatmaps shows the response of these networks is kinetically very similar in the two anaerobic
datasets. Similarities included a slightly delayed (ca. 0.08
generations) yet chronic down-regulation of Hap1-regu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/627

lated networks involved in respiration and mitochondrial
energy production ( C N 2 5 and C A-N 2 2) and delayed yet
chronic down-regulation of networks involved in mitochondrial ribosomal biogenesis ( C N 2 6 and C A-N 2 4) that
were significantly enriched for 3'-Puf3 sites. Both treatments also resulted in the delayed yet chronic de-repression of Rox1-regulated networks ( C N 2 11 – 13 and

C A-N 2 7) involved in carbohydrate import/utilization and
redox balance and delayed activation of Upc2-regulated
ones ( C N 2 11 – 13 and C A-N 2 9) involved in sterol and
cell wall homeostasis. Although there are differences in
terms of specific transcription factor binding sites and
functional categories enriched from clustering the two
anaerobic datasets, it is clear that the networks that more
chronically respond to anaerobiosis are not affected by
the presence of the respiratory inhibitor.
Overall, it is apparent from these comparisons that the
normoxic addition of antimycin A to respiratory competent cells and oxygen deprivation elicits a kinetically similar response in the same gene networks (MCB/SCB, Abf1/
PAC/RRPE and Msn2/4). Moreover, pretreatment of aerobic cells with antimycin A abrogates the transient response
of a large number of networks that acutely respond to
anoxia yet has not affect heme-regulated ones (e.g., Hap1,
Rox1 and Upc2) that more chronically respond. These
results show that the acute and chronic phases of the
anaerobic response in catabolite non-repressed (galactose) cells are separable and, thus, are likely triggered by
different sensing and signaling pathways: the acute transient phase from the respiratory inhibition and, we
hypothesize, associated changes in cellular energetics
and/or growth rate, and the chronic phase from oxygen
deprivation. This interpretation is further corroborated by
previous studies that show this transient "stress response"
to anaerobiosis is absent in catabolite-repressed (glucose)
cells [5]. Under both conditions, respiration is inhibited
or repressed during the transition to anaerobiosis: here by
chemical means and in previous studies by the presence of
glucose. Thus, in both cases, the aerobic to anaerobic transition proceeds rather smoothly, that is without a major
disruption in catabolism or measured growth rate as the
cells ferment the available carbon source in both the aerobic and anaerobic phases. In contrast, cells grown on
galactose in the absence of respiratory inhibitor are forced
to switch from respiro-fermentative to strictly fermentative metabolism and, in so doing, undergo a substantial
decrease in growth rate (here from a 2.4 h mass doubling
time to 4 h). Although several recent studies have suggested the changes in the activity of these general stressresponsive gene networks result simply from changes in

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:627

growth rate [7-9], given their function and the fact they
only transiently respond and are not differentially
expressed among treatments where the grow rate differs
nearly 2-fold (aerobiosis vs. anaerobiosis) suggests they
may be part of a systems level response for balancing energetic supply and demand and coordinating entry into the
cell cycle in response to the abrupt cessation of respiration.

Discussion
This study has revealed novel insight into the transcriptomic response referred to as the "common environmental response" (CER) [4] or "environmental stress
response" (ESR) [2] and differentiates between networks
that respond to respiratory inhibition and those that
respond to oxygen deprivation. First, we show that the
acute inhibition of respiration by either oxygen deprivation (anoxia) or chemical means (antimycin A) in catabolite non-repressed conditions evokes a transient ESR/CERlike response. Gene network analyses suggest that changes
in the activity of Fhl1 and PAC/RRPE-associated factors
result in the transient down-regulation of genes involved
in energetically costly programs of ribosomal biogenesis,
protein synthesis, and rRNA transcription/processing.
Simultaneously, transient changes in the activity of the
SBF (Swi4-Swi6) and MBF complexes (Mbp1-Swi6) result
in the down-regulation of genes involved in late G1 and
the G1/S transition of the cell cycle and a predicted delay
in its progression as mass and energy are assessed before
committing to another round. At the same time Msn2/4regulated networks involved in carbohydrate import/utilization and reserve energy metabolism are transiently activated.
When viewed together it seems clear that the transient
changes in the activity of these gene networks may be
required for balancing energy supply and demand and
regulating entrance into the cell cycle. Functional gene
network analyses suggest this program includes simultaneously bolstering catabolic potential, regulating reserve
energy supplies (trehalose and glycogen), and sparing
energetic demand by down-regulating early steps in the
biogenesis of the cytoplasmic ribosomes. Given that
changes in the activity of these gene networks are not
observed when respiration is inhibited well before (3 generations) the aerobic-to-anaerobic transition, we hypothesize these networks may respond to the acute decrease in
energy status that accompanies respiratory inhibition as it
is clear they do not respond directly to the change in oxygen availability. This conclusion is further supported by
previous genomic comparisons of the anaerobic shift in
catabolite-repressed and non-repressed cells [5,6], which
showed that these networks also fail to respond during the
aerobic-to-anaerobic transition when respiration is inhibited by the presence of glucose and, thus, when the transi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/627

tion precedes with no change in growth rate or energetic
status. During the review of this manuscript, an additional
genomic study examining the switch to fermentation also
concluded that the mere depletion of oxygen does not
evoke a stress response [11].
After a substantive delay (≥ 2 generations), more chronic
changes in gene network activity were observed under
anaerobiosis that were not observed under aerobiosis in
the presence of antimycin A. Network analyses show these
included the chronic down-regulation of Hap1- and
Hap2/3/4/5-regulated ones involved in mitochondrial
functions as well as Rox1-regulated ones involved in
redox regulation and carbohydrate usage. The last networks to respond (≥ 1 generation) were Upc2-regulated
ones involved in cell wall functions and sterol homeostasis. These same networks responded with similar kinetics
to anoxia in the presence of antimycin A. An extensive
body of previous research (reviewed in [12-14]) has
shown that changes in the activity of these trans-acting factors result from decreased heme levels as a result of the
loss of oxygen for its synthesis and, thus, it is not surprising that these networks fail to respond to antimycin A
treatment under normoxic conditions. Others include
those involved in mitochondrial ribosomal biogenesis
that have apparently lost their 5' ancestral cis-regulatory
sites and appear to be regulated post-transcriptionally by
Puf3 [15]. Although some genes were found to respond in
a unique manner to each treatment, clustering analyses
reveal the same or similar gene networks respond to oxygen deprivation both the presence and absence of inhibitor.
Given that both oxygen deprivation and antimycin A poisoning require metabolic retooling of mitochondrial
functions, it is reasonable to postulate that many of the
observed changes in gene expression result from retrograde signaling [16]. The retrograde response signals
mitochondrial dysfunction to the nucleus and causes
changes in the expression of genes associated with peroxisomal activities and anaplerotic pathways that mitigate
the loss of the tricarboxylic acid cycle activity [17]. This
response also correlates metabolism with stress responses,
chromatin-dependent gene activation, and genome stability in yeast aging [18]. Not surprisingly, many of the
known RTG-dependent genes responded to antimycin A
treatment in air [19]. However, there was surprisingly little overlap (21%) between the genes identified here to
respond to antimycin A treatment and those from Epstein
et. al's study [17], differences that most likely can be
attributed to the time points that were sampled in each
study, array platforms and differences in experimental
conditions. Rather, it is clear that the gene networks that
respond to anoxia as well as antimycin A treatment are
those involved in the general cellular response to stress.

Is the acute response to respiratory inhibition an "environmental stress response"? While it is common practice
to look for congruence in lists of differentially expressed
genes among various treatments to answer this question,
such comparisons are more meaningful and robust when
comparing functional groups and transcriptional units
defined by common cis-regulatory sequences statistically
enriched in the clustered genes. Even when identical
experimental treatments are compared, differences in
strain backgrounds, media, time courses, expression platforms, statistical criteria, and experimental variation can
result in frighteningly little congruence among gene sets.
For example, when we compare our transiently responding genes to those that comprise the ESR [2], there is only
modest (40%) overlap. However, after performing SOM
clustering of the ESR data and calculating FCS and CS as
we did for our data sets, we recovered eight clusters of
transiently up-regulated genes and four clusters of transiently down-regulated genes in which the predominant
cis-regulatory sequences and functional categories were
nearly the same as in our study. These include rapidly
repressed networks involved in aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis
and protein synthesis that are enriched for SCB, Swi6 and
Abf1 binding sites, and several clusters of transiently
repressed genes involved in ribosomal biogenesis, rRNA
transcription/processing and/or protein synthesis that are
significantly enriched for Fhl1, Rap1, PAC, RRPE, and/or
Abf1 sites. Those that were transiently induced are predominated by Msn2/4 and/or Nrg1 sites and enriched for
categories of rescue and defense, the stress response,
metabolism of energy reserves and peroxisome function.
Thus, from a network comparison it is clear that the same
or similar gene networks respond to respiratory inhibition
as they do to a large number of other environmental challenges.
Functional Attributes of the General Stress Response
The general stress response was first postulated to explain
the phenomenon of cross-protection, wherein exposure
to a non-lethal dose of one stress protects against a potentially lethal dose of another, often seemingly unrelated,
stress [20-25]. It is now clear that this cross protection is
afforded by the transcriptional up-regulation of a common set of general stress-responsive genes involved in
diverse cellular functions, including reserve energy regulation, carbohydrate metabolism, protein folding and degradation, oxidative stress defense, autophagy, cytoskeletal
reorganization, DNA-damage repair, and other processes
[2,4]. However, the degree of cross-protection varies
depending on the stresses and it is not always reciprocal,
indicating that stress-specific responses are required for
full protection from a specific stressor. Stress resistance
has also been shown to occur following nutrient deprivation and stationary phase [2,26-28]. A number of different
signaling pathways acting in response to specific stressors

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/627

have been shown to control these stress-responsive genes.
Signaling pathways implicated in coordinating the
response include the protein kinase C (PKC)-mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinase pathway following secretion defects and cell wall damage [29-32], the MEC1 pathway following DNA damage [33], and the Ssk1/Ste11dependent pathways and high osmolarity glycerol
(HOG)-MAP kinase cascade following osmotic stress
[1,34]. Pathways involved in suppressing the response
include the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway [35], the
Snf1 protein kinase pathway [36], and the PKA-MAP
kinase pathway [37-39]. Although seemingly complex,
such a multiplex of signaling cascades is likely required for
dictating specificity in the cellular response to an environment in which a multitude of different parameters (e.g.,
temperature, osmolarity, pH, O2 and other nutrients) can
change simultaneously.
From functional analyses of the response, it is clear that a
rapid change in steady-state conditions (environmental or
physiological) prepares the cell to meet a myriad of
unforeseen challenges. From a systems level viewpoint,
the cell must coordinate energy metabolism with growth
rate, the cell cycle, and any specific requirements dictated
by the environmental conditions. Given the gene networks that respond, it would appear that at its core is the
sparing of energetic demand by rapidly down-regulating
the expression of a large set of genes (~600) involved in
energy consuming pathways. Simultaneously, supplies
may be bolstered by up-regulating key genes involved in
import/utilization of primary and secondary carbon substrates and presumably recycling cellular components
through autophagy. More complex changes are observed
for genes involved in reserve energy stores (trehalose and
glycogen), which presumably reflect appropriate parsing
of supplies for cell-cycle function and stress mitigation
while preserving a modicum of reserve capacity. In addition to changes in gene expression, many of these latter
genes are regulated post-transcriptionally.
In terms of potential energetic sparing measures, more
than 70% of the characterized genes [40,41] whose
expression is down-regulated in the ESR are involved in
protein synthesis, including genes required for ribosome
synthesis and processing, RNA polymerase I- and IIIdependent transcription, and protein translation. Thus, it
should be of no surprise that these include some of the
most abundant and shortest-lived mRNAs, namely genes
for ribosomal proteins (RP genes) and rRNA transcription. RP genes alone account for about 60% of all transcription-initiation events in rapidly growing yeast cells
[42] and a remarkable 90% of all mRNA splicing events.
Temporal analyses suggest rapid transcriptional deactivation or silencing of these genes followed by mRNA decay
given that the decline in their transcript levels tracks well

with their estimated half-lives. Predictable yet less dramatic differences in the expression of these, as well as
most other genes that comprise the common stress
response, have been shown to result from simply varying
the growth rate [7], providing further evidence that their
expression is in step with the physiological status of the
cell.
In nearly all conditions examined except nutrient starvation [2], the stress response has shown to be transitory,
with maximal transcriptional changes frequently
observed between 15 and 30 min and a diminishing
response after 60 min. Although, multiple interpretations
have been provided (e.g., see discussions in [2,4,43]), a
simple hypothesis that fits with the transcriptomic data is
that all of these environmental challenges, whether perturbations that temporally disrupt catabolic pathways or
ones that require rapidly up-regulating costly programs
for combating a specific stressor, require the immediate
expenditure of sufficient energy as to require the suspension of other cellular operations, such as general protein
synthesis. Obviously, such a hypothesis needs to be corroborated with careful measurements of cellular energetics, measurements that are the focus of ongoing studies in
the laboratory. After the initial energetic drain, it would
appear that a new balance is quickly achieved and cells
resume their normal activities given these genes do not
continue to be differentially expressed except under nutrient starvation conditions. Moreover, such an interpretation suggests the response is graded according to the
degree to which the energetic status of the cell is perturbed, a hypothesis that is directly testable and the subject of additional ongoing experiments in our laboratory.
Finally, several recent studies have suggested that many of
the genes that have been previously characterized as
"stress responsive" are perhaps more appropriately
labeled "growth-rate responsive" [7-9]. In a serious of elegant, nutrient-limited chemostat studies, these authors
have shown the expression of most of the genes comprising the ESR is in-step with steady-state growth rate. Thus,
rather than responding to the stress directly, perhaps they
are responding to a change in growth rate secondary to the
stress [8,9]. To determine if the genes we identified are
correlated with growth rate, we divide the clustered
expression profiles of the anaerobic dataset into groups of
transiently and chronically responding ones and then further into repressed and induced sets. Using the online utility http://growthrate.princeton.edu developed by Brauer
et al. 2008 [9] we plotted the distribution of growth-rate
slopes for these sets. As shown in Additional file 7, those
that are transiently expressed are highly correlated with
growth rate whereas those that were more chronically
expressed are not. Given this, it is also possible to infer the
instantaneous growth rate using these transiently
expressed genes [9], which in our datasets suggests a max-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/627

imal slowing of growth between 0.13 and 0.19 generations (ca. 30 min) in response to N2 and antimycin A
treatment in air and complete recovery by about 0.5 generations (ca. 2 h). If changes in the expression of these
genes are a direct result of differences in growth rate, what
is puzzling here is the fact they are not differentially
expressed between the strictly fermentative phase, in
which the mass doubling time is 4 h, and the respiro-fermentative phase, in which the mass doubling time is 2.4
h. Rather the response is strictly transitory. What's more is
that inhibiting galactose-dependent respiration limits the
rate at which ATP can be generated (QATP) and, thus, it is
hard to see how acute changes in cellular energetics cannot be at the core of this response. In other words, that it
is the acute change in cellular energetics that initiates the
response resulting in the change in growth rate, a hypothesis that is being tested with on-going experiments in our
laboratory.
In summary, all eukaryotic cells have necessarily evolved
mechanisms for effectively dealing with fluctuations in
physical, chemical, and physiological parameters. Even
within the relatively protected confines of multicellular
organisms, cells experience fluctuations in osmolarity,
oxygen and reactive oxygen species as well as various
nutrients and noxious substances. Comparative studies
have shown that many of the factors important for regulating the stress response, including both signaling pathways (e.g., MAPK) and transcription factors (e.g., AP-1),
are conserved from yeast to humans. Understanding the
factors that influence this response has important implications for pathophysiological conditions, such as heart disease, tumorigenesis, various metabolic syndromes, and
aging, all of which contribute to stress at the cellular level.
Here we set forth a hypothesis that at its core is the regulation of cellular energetics via an as yet unidentified metabolic signal. Such internal signals are being actively
studied in bacteria [44] but comparatively little work has
been done in eukaryotes. Two, partially redundant, serine/threonine kinases containing PAS domains, Psk1
andPsk2, which coordinately regulate protein synthesis
and carbohydrate metabolism in response to nutritional
status of the cell, have been implicated in signaling in
yeast. Although a small molecule/metabolite is presumed
to trigger this response by interacting with the PAS
domain, it has not been identified [45,46]. Variants of this
system are found from yeast to mammals [47-49]. Thus,
future studies with such factors will be of great interest to
unravel both the sensing and signaling aspects of this conserved stress response program.

taining Tween 80, ergosterol, and silicon antifoam (SSGTEA) [51] with shaking (300 rpm) for 3 – 4 days prior to
inoculating a NewBrunswick BioFlo III fermentor (3.5 l
working volume) [52]. Batch fermentor cultures were
inoculated with a volume of pre-culture to allow for at
least six generations of aerobic growth before reaching a
cell density of ≈ 1 Klett unit. A control sample was then
harvested and 1 μM antimycin A (final concentration;
Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to the medium. Ten
samples were collected (0.04, 0.08, 0.13, 0.19, 0.25, 0.38,
0.5, 1, 2, and 3 generations) over the next three generations of aerobic growth. The sparge gas (1.2 vol. of gas/
vol. of medium per min) was then switched from air to
2.5% CO2 in O2-free N2 and the same generation-specific
samples were taken over three generations of anaerobic
growth. Dissolved O2 was controlled and monitored as
described previously [52]. Two batch fermentor experiments, in which every other time point was sampled, were
conducted to complete the entire time series, which was
repeated in triplicate. Cells were harvested using a vacuum
filtration apparatus onto filters as described previously
[53]. The filtered cells were washed with either sterile deoxygenated or oxygenated water (as appropriate), flashfrozen in liquid N2 within one minute of initiating the
sampling, and stored at -80°C for later RNA isolation.
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and microarray
hybridization
Total RNA was extracted from the filtered cells using hot
phenol as described previously [53]. Thirty μg of total
RNA was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis, and microarray target preparation was performed as described elsewhere [53]. A reference design was used for hybridizing
the custom 70-mer oligonucleotide microarrays [5]. The
reference consisted of a pool of equal masses of RNA from
a 24-h anaerobic culture and a 4-h aerobic culture harvested after prior exposure to 24 h of anaerobiosis. Microarray hybridizations, washing, and scanning were
conducted as described previously [5].
Statistical analyses and data clustering
GenePix Pro software (v4.1, Axon, Union City, CA) was
used for spot identification and fluorescence intensity
quantification. Data normalization and statistical analyses were performed as described previously [5] using SAS
(v9.1, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). After normalization, separate ANOVAs (SAS MIXED procedure with repeated measures) were used to identify genes whose transcript levels
responded significantly to three different treatments: (A)
anaerobiosis, using data published previously from our
laboratory [6]; (B) antimycin A treatment during aerobiosis; and (C) anaerobiosis in the presence of antimycin A.
The same generation-specific sampling regime was used
for each treatment (0 [control], 0.04, 0.08, 0.13, 0.19,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/627

0.25, 0.38, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 generations). A step-down Bonferroni post hoc P-value adjustment was used to minimize
the false discovery rate.
After identifying genes that responded significantly to
each treatment, the temporal profiles were separately clustered using Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm http://www.cis.hut.fi/research/som_pak/[54]) with
1D-string topology and standard correlation as the distance metric. To determine an appropriate K value (cluster
number) for gene network recovery, two quality assessment metrics were calculated from the results obtained
using a range of K values (from 2 to 30). Consensus Share
(CS) is the percentage of genes that were clustered exactly
the same over 10 replicate runs of the SOM algorithm (an
indicator of clustering robustness), and the Feature Configuration Statistic (FCS) is the probability that the
observed configuration of a transcription-factor motif
(TFM) among gene clusters arose by chance alone from its
multinomial distribution dictated by cluster sizes [5]. For
FCS, we assessed the configuration of 2,892 transcriptionfactor consensus binding sequences or motifs (TFMs)
compiled from both experimental and comparative phylogenomic analyses [see Additional file 1]. To narrow the
range of potentially interesting K values, we first eliminated those with a CS value < 0.9. We then calculated FCS
q values [55] on a K-by-K basis and eliminated any TFMs
whose value was > 0.01 for all remaining K values. We
then calculated an average FCS P value for all remaining
TFMs as a function of K. The clustering result (K value) for
each treatment that resulted in the lowest average FCS P
value was chosen for gene network analysis. In addition to
examining the configuration of consensus binding
sequences among gene clusters (FCS P value), and calculating their hypergeometric enrichment P values within
each cluster, we also used MDscan [56] to identify overrepresented sequences in each of the gene clusters that
may not be included in our TFM list. For training, we used
a set of ≈ 30 expression profiles, but no more than 50% of
any cluster, that were closest to the mean expression profile in each cluster. FunSpec [57] was used to calculate
hypergeometric P values for enriched MIPS functional categories in each gene cluster or for subgroups of genes
identified with MDscan.
All microarray data from this study have been deposited
in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (accession numbers
GSE3705 and GSE3706). The anaerobic dataset to which
the antimycin A treatments are compared is a subset of
accession number GSE2246.
