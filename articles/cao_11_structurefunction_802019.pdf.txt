Structure-Function Analysis of Diacylglycerol
Acyltransferase Sequences from 70 Organisms
Heping Cao

Abstract
Background: Diacylglycerol acyltransferase families (DGATs) catalyze the final and rate-limiting step of
triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis in eukaryotic organisms. Understanding the roles of DGATs will help to create
transgenic plants with value-added properties and provide clues for therapeutic intervention for obesity and
related diseases. The objective of this analysis was to identify conserved sequence motifs and amino acid residues
for better understanding of the structure-function relationship of these important enzymes.
Results: 117 DGAT sequences from 70 organisms including plants, animals, fungi and human are obtained from
database search using tung tree DGATs. Phylogenetic analysis separates these proteins into DGAT1 and DGAT2
subfamilies. These DGATs are integral membrane proteins with more than 40% of the total amino acid residues
being hydrophobic. They have similar properties and amino acid composition except that DGAT1s are
approximately 20 kDa larger than DGAT2s. DGAT1s and DGAT2s have 41 and 16 completely conserved amino acid
residues, respectively, although only two of them are shared by all DGATs. These residues are distributed in 7 and
6 sequence blocks for DGAT1s and DGAT2s, respectively, and located at the carboxyl termini, suggesting the
location of the catalytic domains. These conserved sequence blocks do not contain the putative neutral lipidbinding domain, mitochondrial targeting signal, or ER retrieval motif. The importance of conserved residues has
been demonstrated by site-directed and natural mutants.
Conclusions: This study has identified conserved sequence motifs and amino acid residues in all 117 DGATs and
the two subfamilies. None of the completely conserved residues in DGAT1s and DGAT2s is present in recently
reported isoforms in the multiple sequences alignment, raising an important question how proteins with
completely different amino acid sequences could perform the same biochemical reaction. The sequence analysis
should facilitate studying the structure-function relationship of DGATs with the ultimate goal to identify critical
amino acid residues for engineering superb enzymes in metabolic engineering and selecting enzyme inhibitors in
therapeutic application for obesity and related diseases.

Background
The complete genomes of many organisms including
human, mouse, Arabidopsis and rice have been
sequenced. The immediate challenge of post-genomic
biology is to determine the biological functions of proteins encoded by unknown genes. Many endogenous
proteins occur in extremely low abundance (such as the
anti-inflammatory protein tristetraprolin/zinc-finger protein 36, TTP/ZFP36) [1] and are labile (such as omega-3

fatty-acid desaturase, FAD3) [2], which complicates
characterization of those proteins.
One approach to gain clues about the structure-function relationship of proteins is to perform comprehensive amino acid sequence analysis. It is generally
accepted that critical amino acid residues and sequence
motifs in the same family of proteins are evolutionarily
conserved. We previously used a protein sequence analysis approach to identify conserved sequence motifs
and critical amino acid residues in several families of
proteins from diverse organisms. The protein sequences
we analyzed previously include the TTP/ZFP36 family
involved in mRNA binding and destabilization [3,4],
adenylate translocators [5], starch/glycogen synthases

starch/glycogen debranching enzymes [9].
Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are the major molecules of
energy storage in eukaryotes. They also serve as a reservoir of fatty acids for membrane biogenesis and lead to
obesity due to excessive accumulation in adipose tissues.
Diacylglycerol acyltransferase families (DGATs) are integral microsomal membrane proteins that catalyze the
last and rate-limiting step of TAG biosynthesis in eukaryotic organisms. DGATs esterify sn-1,2-diacylglycerol
with a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. DGAT genes have
been isolated from many organisms. At least two forms
of DGATs are present in mammals [10,11] and plants
[12,13] with additional forms reported in burning bush
(Euonymus alatus) [14], peanut [15] and Arabidopsis
[16]. Plants and animals deficient in DGATs accumulate
less TAG [17-19]. Animals with reduced DGAT activity
are resistant to diet-induced obesity [18,20] and lack
milk production [18]. Over-expression of DGAT
enzymes increases TAG content in plants [14,21-26],
animals [27-30] and yeast [31]. DGATs have nonredundant functions in TAG biosynthesis in species such as
mice [19] and tung tree (Vernicia fordii) [13]. Mice deficient in DGAT1 are viable, have modest decreases in
TAG, and are resistant to diet-induced obesity [18,32].
In contrast, mice deficient in DGAT2 have severe reduction of TAG and die shortly after birth [19]. The fact
that DGAT1 is unable to compensate for the deficiency
in DGAT2 knockout mice indicates the nonredundant
functions of each DGAT isoform in TAG biosynthesis
during mammal development. Therefore, understanding
the roles of DGATs in plants and animals will have tremendous potential in creating new oilseed crops with
value-added properties and providing information for
therapeutic intervention for obesity and related diseases.
Limited numbers of DGAT amino acid sequences
were analyzed previously [13,33]. However, there is a
lack of comprehensive analysis of amino acid sequences
of DGATs among diverse organisms. The objective of
this analysis was to identify conserved sequence motifs
and amino acid residues in 117 DGATs from 70 organisms to provide a better understanding of the structurefunction relationship of these important enzymes.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis and classification of DGATs

A database search using tung tree (Vernicia fordii)
DGAT1 and DGAT2 protein sequences [13] has identified 117 DGAT sequences from 70 organisms including
plants, animals, fungi and human (Table 1). More than
two forms of DGATs are present in a number of species. For example, Bos taurus (cow) and Brassica napus
(rape) have four forms of DGATs, whereas Homo
sapiens (human) and Danio rerio (zebrafish) have three

forms of DGATs (Table 1). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that all 117 DGAT protein sequences are grouped
in the same phylogenetic tree (data not shown) and
clearly separated into DGAT1 and DGAT2 subfamilies
(Figure 1). DGAT1s are more conserved than DGAT2s.
DGATs from plants, animals and fungi are also distinctly separated from each other with a few exceptions
(Figure 1).
Six DGATs previously classified as DGAT2s in the
GenBank databases [GenBank:EGC41804.1, GenBank:
EEQ31683.1,
GenBank:AAY40785.1,
GenBank:
AAD40881.1, GenBank:EFY86774.1 and GenBank:
EFY97444.1] are clustered within the DGAT1 subfamily
in this phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1). More detailed
sequence analysis within the multiple sequence alignment also indicates that their sequences are more similar to DGAT1s (see below). Therefore, these six
DGAT2s are reclassified as DGAT1s (AcDGAT1EGC41804.1, AoDGAT1-EEQ31683.1, BjDGAT1bAAY40785.1, BnDGAT1b-AAD40881.1, MaDGAT1aEFY86774.1, and MaDGAT1b-EFY97444.1, respectively)
(Table 1).
DGAT properties and amino acid composition

It is generally observed that DGAT1s are much bigger
proteins with more transmembrane domains than
DGAT2s. The properties and amino acid composition of
109 full-length DGATs were analyzed and calculated
according to the classifications of DGAT1 and DGAT2
subfamilies by phylogenetic analysis. The eight partial
sequences listed in Table 1 were excluded from this
analysis (AaDGAT1-XP_001658299, BnDGAT1bAAD40881.1, BtDGAT2c-XP_002683800.1, ChDGAT1ABD59375.1, CvDGAT2-EFN51306.1, OaDGAT2XP_001518899.1, PtDGAT1-XP_002177753.1 and
PtDGAT2-XP_002317635.1).
DGAT1s have an average of 515 amino acid residues
with a standard deviation of 44 amino acid residues
among the 55 sequences (Table 2). The average residue
number of DGAT1 is 171 amino acids greater than the
average DGAT2 length, which has an average of 344
residues with a standard deviation of 29 residues among
the 54 sequences (Table 2). This corresponds to
approximately 20 kDa difference in the molecular mass.
The isoelectric points of DGAT1s and DGAT2s are
similar with an average value of 9.17 and 9.28, respectively, however DGAT1s have approximately 4 more
charges at pH 7 than DGAT2s (Table 2).
The frequency of functional amino acid residue groups
between DGAT1 and DGAT2 subfamilies is remarkably
similar (Table 2). DGAT1s and DGAT2s have charged
residues (RKHYCDE) of approximately 26%, which
includes approximately 7% of acidic residues (DE) and
10% of basic residues (KR). The frequency of polar

*8 partial sequences were not used for statistics. **6 DGATs named as DGAT2s in the GenBank Databases should be DGAT1s as indicated in the table because
they are more similar to DGAT1s. ***A: animal, F: fungus, P: plant.

resides (NCQSTY) is also similar with an average of 25%
vs. 22% in polar residues for DGAT1s and DGAT2s,
respectively. DGAT1s and DGAT2s are integral membrane proteins with 42% and 41% of the total residues
being hydrophobic (AILFWV), respectively (Table 2).
Identification of amino acid residues and sequence motifs
conserved among all DGATs

The sequences between DGAT1s and DGAT2s are very
divergent. No common features between these two subfamilies were reported previously using 7 DGAT1s and 8
DGAT2s from 10 organisms [13]. However, the biochemical function of the two DGAT isoforms is essentially
identical in enzymatic assays, suggesting that certain
common sequence conservations are probably present
between them. Multiple sequence alignment was performed to analyze all 117 DGATs including 59 DGAT1s
from 48 organisms and 58 DGAT2s from 44 organisms.
Sequence alignment has identified only two completely
conserved amino acid residues among all DGATs. One
perfectly conserved proline residue corresponds to P248
in AaDGAT1-XP_001658299 and P151 in VfDGAT2DQ356682.1 (Figure 2A); the other residue, a perfectly
conserved phenylalanine residue corresponds to F344 in
AaDGAT1-XP_001658299 and F225 in VfDGAT2DQ356682.1 (Figure 2B). The conserved phenylalanine
residue is followed by a glycine residue conserved in all
except DGAT1s of Aedes aegypti, Drosophila melanogaster and Tribolium castaneum (Figure 2B). The other
proline residue in Figure 2C is almost completely conserved except DGAT2 of Ostreococcus tauri, which corresponds to P411 in AaDGAT1-XP_001658299 and P276
in VfDGAT2-DQ356682.1. Based on the sequence conservation patterns with these conserved residues as
anchors, the conserved sequence motifs among all
DGATs are named as Motif 1 (P Block), Motif 2 (FG
Block) and Motif 3 (P-1 Block). The highly conserved
residues among diverse organisms may be located at the
active sites of the enzymes and play important roles in
structure, substrate binding and/or catalysis.
Identification of amino acid residues and sequence motifs
conserved in DGAT1s

Multiple sequence alignment was performed to identify
conserved amino acid residues and sequence motifs
within the DGAT1 subfamily. Among the 55 full-length

DGAT1s, 41 amino acid residues are completely conserved, which correspond to 8.0% of the total 515 residues of DGAT1s. Table 3 shows the positions of the 41
completely conserved residues in DGAT1s from representatives of animal group (mouse), plant group (tung
tree) and fungus group (Dictyostelium discoideum).
These completely conserved residues are located in
seven sequence motifs of DGAT1s. Based on the
sequence conservation patterns with the completely
conserved residues as anchors, the conserved sequence
motifs of DGAT1s are named as Motif 1 (GL Block),
Motif 2 (KSR Block), Motif 3 (PTR Block) (Figure 3AC), Motif 4 (QP Block), Motif 5 (LWLFFEFDRFYWWNWWNPPFSHP Block) (Figure 4A-B), Motif 6
(FQL Block) and Motif 7 (NGQPY Block) (Figure 5A-B).
The great majority of the conserved residues are located
within the carboxyl terminal halves of DGAT1s. Among
the completely conserved residues, 33 of them are
located within the last 200 residues from the carboxyl
termini in Motifs 4-7 (Figures 4, 5), and 23 of them are
concentrated in the most conserved region with
approximately 100 residues in Motif 6 (Figure 4B). The
first two conserved residues (G, L) in Motif 1 start
approximately 100 residues from the amino termini
(Figure 3A). The next three conserved residues (K, S, R)
in Motif 2 start until approximately 200 residues from
the amino termini (Figure 3B). The last conserved residue (Y) in Motif 7 ends within the last 20 residues from
the carboxyl termini of DGAT1s (Figure 5B).
Identification of amino acid residues and sequence motifs
conserved in DGAT2s

Multiple sequence alignment was also performed using all
DGAT2s to identify conserved amino acid residues and
sequence motifs within this subfamily. Sixteen residues are
completely conserved in the 54 full-length DGAT2s, corresponding to 4.7% of the total 344 residues. Table 3
shows the positions of the 16 completely conserved residues in DGAT2s from representatives of animal group
(mouse), plant group (tung tree) and fungus group (Dictyostelium discoideum). Based on the sequence conservation patterns with the completely conserved residues as
anchors, the conserved sequence motifs of DGAT2s are
named as Motif 1 (PH Block), Motif 2 (PR Block), Motif 3
(GGE Block) (Figure 6A-C), Motif 4 (RGFA Block), Motif
5 (VPFG Block) and Motif 6 (G Block) (Figure 7A-C).

Figure 1 Phylogenetic analysis of DGAT1s and DGAT2s. The presumed evolutionary relationships among the 117 DGATs from 70 organisms
(listed in Table 1) were analyzed by phylogenetic analysis based on the Neighbor-Joining method of Saitou and Nei. The numbers in the
parenthesis following DGAT names are the calculated distance values which reflect the degree of divergence between all pairs of DGAT
sequences analyzed. The sequences above the red line are from animals, whereas the sequences below the green line are from plants. A red
“star” before the sequence indicates the exceptional sequence from the grouping.

Similar to DGAT1s, these conserved residues are located
at the carboxyl termini of DGAT2s. Eight of them are concentrated within 25 residues in the highly conserved
Motifs 4 and 5 of DGAT2s (Figure 7A-B). The first two
conserved residues (PH) in Motif 1 start until approximately 100 residues from the amino termini but the last
residue (G) ends within the last 50 residues from the carboxyl termini of DGAT1s (Figure 6A and 7C).
Sequence analysis of important motifs in less
conservative regions of DGATs

Several studies have reported functional motifs in
DGATs. However, the conserved sequence motifs identified by our extensive sequence analysis as discussed
above do not contain any of the reported putative neutral
lipid-binding domain [34], mitochondrial targeting signal
[35] or ER retrieval motif [13]. It was reported that
mouse DGAT2 contains a consensus sequence
(FLXLXXXn) for a putative neutral lipid-binding domain
[34] which was shown to be present in proteins that
either bind to or metabolize neutral lipids [36]. However,
this putative motif is only modestly conserved in animal
DGAT2s and not present in any plant DGAT2 (Figure
8A). Mouse DGAT2 was also reported to contain a putative mitochondrial targeting signal with positively
charged residues (RXKXXK) targeting proteins to mitochondria [35]. This motif is only found in a few animal
DGATs but not conserved in any of the plant or fungi
DGAT2s (Figure 8B). DGATs are ER-localized enzymes
with an ER retrieval motif (LKLEI) at the extreme carboxyl terminus of tung DGAT2 [13]. This sequence analysis shows that this pentapeptide ER-retrieval motif is
only modestly conserved in plant DGAT2s but not in
animal or fungal DGAT2s, although animal and fugal
DGATs are also located to ER (Figure 8C).
Sequence analysis of important amino acid residues in
less conservative regions of DGATs

The importance of some less conserved residues of
DGATs has been demonstrated by site-directed mutants

(Table 4). Mutagenesis of a putative SnRK1 target site
S197 in Tropaeolum majus DGAT1 results in a 38%80% increase in DGAT1 activity, and over-expression of
the mutated TmDGAT1 in Arabidopsis results in a
20%-50% increase in oil content on a per seed basis
(Table 4) [25]. Figure 9A shows that this serine residue
is conserved in most of the plants and some animals
except that the same position in DGAT1s alignment is
replaced with proline, glycine, threonine and lysine residue in DGAT1s from other organisms. A similar serine
residue is not found in any of DGAT2s. Mutagenesis at
P216 in Tropaeolum majus DGAT1 eliminates almost
all of the activity (Table 4) [25]. The P216 residue is
completely conserved in plant DGAT1s but is missing
in mammalian DGAT1s (Figure 9B).
A highly conserved region with a consensus sequence
of “YFP” in DGAT2s is essential for enzymatic activity
of DGAT2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Table 4)
[33]. These three residues are highly conserved and
located before Motif 1 but none of the three amino acid
residues is completely conserved among all DGAT2s in
our analysis using 54 full-length DGAT2s (Figure 10A).
The consensus “YFP” is replaced with “YYP” in
DGAT2s of human, chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and
Ashbya gossypii, “FFP” in Helianthus annuus and Nematostella vectensis, and “HFP” in caster bean (Ricinus
communis), Vernonia galamensisand, and Selaginella
moellendorffii. It was reported that a unique region is
present in DGAT2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [33], but
in our expanded analysis, a similar region is also found
in Ashbya gossypii (data not shown).
Mutations at F80/L81/L83 in mouse DGAT2 [34] and
F71/L73 in baker’s yeast DGAT2 [33] result in partial
loss of the activity (Table 4). This region is only relatively conserved in some animal DGAT2s (Figure 10B).
Finally, ScDGAT2 has a unique cysteine residue (C314)
which is not involved in catalysis but may be located
near the active site or related to proper folding of the
protein [37]. However, this residue is only found in
DGAT2s from baker’s yeast and the other fungi Ashbya
gossypii and Physcomitrella patens, but is not present in
the same position of the alignment in any of the other
51 DGAT2s or any of the 55 DGAT1s analyzed (Figure
10C).
Sequence analysis of important amino acid residues of
DGATs shown in natural mutants

The importance of some relatively conserved residues in
TAG biosynthesis has been demonstrated by two wellknown natural mutants in corn and cattle. A phenylalanine insertion (F469) in DGAT1-2 increases oil and
oleic-acid contents in maize. Ectopic expression of the
high-oil DGAT1-2 allele increases oil and oleic-acid
contents by up to 41% and 107%, respectively (Table 4)

The completely conserved residues in DGAT1s and DGAT2s are underlined and listed below the sequences. The underlined P and F residues are conserved in all
DGATs.

[38]. This phenylalanine residue is conserved in all
plants except Brassica napus [GenBank:AAD45536.1]
and conserved in all fungi except mold (Dictyostelium
discoideum and Polysphondylium pallidum) (Figure
11A). Rape DGAT1 is the only sequence in the plant
group with a serine residue in the place of phenylalanine
in the sequence alignment (Figure 11A). Since this gene
is isolated from suspension cultures of Brassica napus
[39] and the native form is not available, it is not known
if this replacement was caused by mutations due to cell
culture conditions, considering that cell culture could
cause significant changes in gene expression [40]. It is
interesting to note that a similar phenylalanine residue
is not present in any of the animal DGAT1s or any of
DGAT2s.
In cattle, a nonconservative substitution of lysine by
alanine (K232A) in DGAT1 (Table 4) is directly responsible for the quantitative trait loci (QTL) variation with
the lysine-encoding allele being associated with higher

milk fat content [41]. Figure 11B shows that the lysine
residue is conserved in mammalian DGAT1s but not in
plants, or fungi, or other animals (fly, frog, insect and
worm) except one of the two forms from dog and zebrafish. The wild-type cattle DGAT1 shows the normal
lysine at 232 position [GenBank:AAL49962.1] (Table 4).
A similar lysine residue is not found in any of DGAT2s.

Discussion
DGAT classification

The nomenclature of proteins derived from DNA
sequences in GenBank databases can lead to confusion
in some cases. One of the utilities of this extensive
sequence analysis is to use the completely conserved
amino acid residues in respective sequence blocks of
DGAT1 and DGAT2 subfamilies as signatures of DGAT
proteins for classification. It is generally accepted that
DGATs are divided into DGAT1 and DGAT2 subfamilies. However, more than two forms of DGATs are

Figure 3 Identification of completely conserved amino acid residues in sequence motifs 1-3 of DGAT1s. (A) DGAT1-Motif 1 (GL Block;
The boxed E residue is mutated in TmDGAT1), (B) DGAT1-Motif 2 (KSR Block), (C) DGAT1-Motif 3 (PTR Block; The boxed P residues are also
conserved in DGAT2s). Multiple sequence alignment was performed using 55 full-length DGAT1 protein sequences from 45 organisms (listed in
Table 1). The completely conserved amino acid residues are highlighted in red on yellow. Other color code and related information are
described briefly in Figure 2 legend and with details in “Methods” section.

present in a number of species (Table 1). Phylogenetic
analysis and multiple sequence alignment classify all 117
DGAT protein sequences into DGAT1 and DGAT2
subfamilies (Figures 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). Furthermore, six
DGATs currently designated as DGAT2s in the databases are reclassified here as DGAT1s due to their close
alignment with DGAT1s and these sequences containing
all 41 completely conserved amino acid residues found
in DGAT1s. These six reclassified sequences are [GenBank:EGC41804.1, GenBank:EEQ31683.1, GenBank:
AAY40785.1,
GenBank:AAD40881.1,
GenBank:
EFY86774.1 and GenBank:EFY97444.1] (Table 1).
DGATs which diverge from the DGAT1 and DGAT2
subfamilies have been recently reported from Arabidopsis thaliana [GenBank:AAN31909.1] [16], Burning Bush
(Euonymus alatus) [GenBank:GU594061.1] [14], peanut
(Arachis hypogaea), [GenBank:AY875644.1] [15], caster
bean (Ricinus communis) [GenBank:XP_002519339.1]
and yeast (Rhodotorula glutinis) [GenBank:DG315417.1].
Phylogenetic analysis and multiple sequence alignment

indicate that these sequences are completely different
from DGAT1s and DGAT2s. In fact, none of the completely conserved residues in DGAT1s (41 residues) and
DGAT2s (16 residues) is present in these new DGATs
in the multiple sequences alignment (data not shown).
This sequence divergence is in contrast to the general
belief that the active sites of enzymes should be conserved during the evolution because all catalyze the
same/similar biochemical reaction. Therefore, this
sequence divergence raises an important question how
completely different proteins could perform the same
biochemical reaction.
DGAT properties and amino acid composition

This study has analyzed the properties and amino acid
composition of 109 full-length DGATs from 70 organisms.
The average DGAT1s are 171 amino acid residues longer
than DGAT2s resulting in approximately 20 kDa difference in the molecular mass. Other DGAT properties are
similar: both are basic proteins under neutral pH with

Figure 4 Identification of completely conserved amino acid residues in sequence motifs 4-5 of DGAT1s. (A) DGAT1-Motif 4 (QP Block), (B)
DGAT1-Motif 5 (LWLFFEFDRFYWWNWWNPPFSHP Block; The first boxed F residues are also conserved in DGAT2s; The boxed Y, W and the
second F residues are mutated in TmDGAT1 and the boxed H residue is mutated in MmDGAT1). Refer to Figure 3 legend for additional
information.

high isoelectric points (Table 2). The frequency of functional amino acid residue groups between DGAT1 and
DGAT2 subfamilies is also very similar in terms of
charged residues, acidic residues, basic residues, polar residues and hydrophobic residues (Table 2). The remarkable
feature of DGAT1s and DGAT2s is that both subfamilies
of proteins contain more than 40% of hydrophobic residues (Table 2). These high amounts of hydrophobic residues in DGATs are in agreement with them being integral
membrane proteins [33,34] with multiple transmembrane
domains [13,33,34], localized to endoplasmic reticulum of
plant and animal cells [13,34], and associated with mitochondria in COS-7 cells [35,42] and lipid bodies in 3T3L1 adipocytes [42]. The membrane association of the proteins presents extra huddle to purification of recombinant
DGATs from any source [43,44].
Catalytic and regulatory domains of DGATs

Generally speaking, critical amino acid residues of
proteins are conserved during the evolution because

they are essential for enzymatic activity. The conserved amino acid residues are clustered at the active
centers of the enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment
has shown that DGAT1s and DGAT2s have 41 and 16
completely conserved amino acid residues, respectively. Most of them are located at the carboxyl termini of DGATs (Table 3). This sequence analysis
suggests that the catalytic domains of DGATs are
located at the carboxyl termini of the proteins. This is
supported by mutations of some completely conserved
amino acid residues in the C-termini of these proteins
resulted in complete loss of the enzymatic activity of
DGATs (see below). This suggestion is in line with
our previous assignment of the catalytic domains of
ADPGlc-dependent a-1,4-glucosyltransferases and a1,6-glucan hydrolases from plants and prokaryotes at
the carboxyl termini of the enzymes because of the
presence of the conserved amino acid residues and
sequence motifs in the different isoforms from diverse
organisms [6,9].

Figure 5 Identification of completely conserved amino acid residues in sequence motifs 6-7 of DGAT1s. (A) DGAT1-Motif 6 (FQL Block),
(B) DGAT1-Motif 7 (NGQPY Block). Refer to Figure 3 legend for additional information.

Several lines of evidence suggest that the regulatory
domains of DGATs are located at the amino termini of
the proteins. First, a recent study showed that the
amino terminal domain of DGAT1 of mouse is not
required for the catalytic activity of DGAT1 but may be
involved in regulating enzyme activity and dimer/tetramer formation [45]. Second, the N-terminal region of
mouse DGAT2 or yeast DGAT2 is not essential for

DGAT activity in vitro [33,35]. Finally, mutagenesis of a
putative protein kinase SnRK1 (SNF1-related kinase 1)
target site at S197 to alanine in TmDGAT1 results in a
38%-80% increase in DGAT1 activity, and over-expression of the mutated TmDGAT1 in Arabidopsis results
in a 20%-50% increase in oil content on a per seed basis
[25]. This serine residue is conserved in most of the
plants and located at the N-termini of DGAT1s (Figure

Figure 6 Identification of completely conserved amino acid residues in sequence motifs 1-3 of DGAT2s. (A) DGAT2-Motif 1 (PH Block;
The boxed H, P and H residues are mutated in MmDGAT2 and ScDGAT2), (B) DGAT2-Motif 2 (PR Block; The boxed P residues are also conserved
in DGAT1s), (C) DGAT2-Motif 3 (GGE Block). Multiple sequence alignment was performed using 54 full-length DGAT2 protein sequences from 44
organisms (listed in Table 1). The completely conserved amino acid residues are highlighted in red on yellow. Other color code and related
information are described briefly in Figure 2 legend and with details in “Methods” section.

9A). All of the above mentioned sequence analysis and
experimental evidence support the concept that the catalytic and regulatory domains of DGATs are located at
the C- and N-termini of the enzymes, respectively.
Functional significance of less conserved motifs in
DGAT2s

Recent studies have reported functional motifs in
DGATs including putative neutral lipid-binding domain
(FLXLXXXn in mouse DGAT2) [34], mitochondrial targeting signal (RXKXXK in mouse DGAT2) [35] and ER
retrieval motif (LKLEI in tung DGAT2) [13]. However,
the conserved sequence motifs identified by our extensive sequence analysis do not contain any of these
reported motifs. In our analysis, the putative neutral
lipid-binding domain [34] which was shown to be presented in proteins that either bind to or metabolize neutral lipids [36], is only modestly conserved in animal
DGAT2s and not present in any plant DGAT2 (Figure

8A). Similarly, the putative mitochondrial targeting signal is only found in a few animal DGAT2s but not conserved in any plant or fungi DGAT2 (Figure 8B). This
sequence analysis also shows that the pentapeptide
(LKLEI) ER-retrieval motif identified at the extreme carboxyl terminus of tung DGAT2 [13] is only modestly
conserved in plant DGAT2s but not in animal or fungus
DGAT2s (Figure 8C). All these studies point out that
less conserved regions in a subset of DGATs may play
specific roles in TAG biosynthesis in that particular subset of organisms.
Functional significance of the completely conserved
residues

Multiple sequence alignment has shown that 55
DGAT1s and 54 DGAT2s have 41 and 16 completely
conserved amino acid residues, respectively, although
only two residues are completely conserved among all
DGATs (Table 3). It is likely that these completely

Figure 7 Identification of completely conserved amino acid residues in sequence motifs 4-6 of DGAT2s. (A) DGAT2-Motif 4 (RGFA Block),
(B) DGAT2-Motif 5 (VPFG Block; The boxed F residues are also conserved in DGAT1s), (C) DGAT2-Motif 6 (G Block). Refer to Figure 6 legend for
additional information.

conserved amino acid residues are critical for DGAT
enzymatic activities. These residues may be involved in
substrate binding, direct catalysis, and/or maintenance
of protein structure including oligomer formation. The
importance of some conserved residues in DGAT1s has
been demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis (Table
4). Mutagenesis at H426 in mouse DGAT1 to alanine
impairs the ability of DGAT1 to synthesize triacylglycerols, retinyl and wax esters in an “in vitro“ acyltransferase
assay [45]. This histidine residue is completely conserved in Motif 5 of all DGAT1s (Figure 4B). Similarly,
mutagenesis at Y392, W395 and F439 in Tropaeolum
majus DGAT1 eliminates nearly all activity [25]. These
three residues are also completely conserved in Motif 5
of all DGAT1s (Figure 4B). All four residues are located

in the most conserved region of DGAT1s in which 23
completely conserved residues are located in Motif 5 of
the multiple sequence alignment (Figure 4B).
The importance of the completely conserved residues
in DGAT2s is also supported by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutagenesis at H161, P162 and H163 sites, and the
triple mutant in mouse DGAT2 results in a substantial
loss of activity (Table 4) [34]. Mutation at the corresponding sites at H193 and H195 in DGAT2 of baker’s
yeast results in complete loss of the activity (Table 4)
[33]. These three resides are located in the highly conserved Motif 1 (PH Block) of DGAT2s (Figure 6A).
These results suggest that they may be located at the
active center of DGAT1s, but the precise roles of these
residues either involved in substrate binding or catalysis

Figure 8 Sequence analysis of important motifs in less conservative regions of DGAT2s. Multiple sequence alignment was performed
using 54 full-length DGAT2 protein sequences from 44 organisms (listed in Table 1). Color code and related information are described briefly in
Figure 2 legend and with details in “Methods” section. The motifs are boxed within the sequence alignment. (A) Putative neutral lipid-binding
domain (FLXLXXX in mouse DGAT2) (B) Mitochondrial targeting signal (RXKXXK in mouse DGAT2), (C) ER retrieval motif (LKLEI in tung DGAT2).

are not clear. Further experiments are required to assess
the contribution of the other completely conserved residues to the enzymatic activity of DGATs.
Functional significance of the less-well conserved
residues in site-directed mutants

The importance of some less conserved residues in
DGATs has also been demonstrated by site-directed
mutagenesis (Table 4). As described above, mutation at

S197 (a putative SnRK1 target site) in TmDGAT1
results in a 38%-80% increase in DGAT1 activity. This
serine residue is conserved in most of the plants (Figure
9A). In addition, mutagenesis at E145 in Motif 1 of Tropaeolum majus DGAT1 results in the loss of almost
half of the activity [25]. This glutamate residue is conserved in all plant DGAT1s and most other DGAT1s
except bird, chimpanzee, Dictyostelium discoideum,
Polysphondylium pallidum and Metarhizium acridum

(Figure 3A). Mutagenesis at P216 in Tropaeolum majus
DGAT1 eliminates almost all of the activity [25]. P216
is completely conserved in plant DGAT1s but is missing
in all mammalian DGAT1s (Figure 9B). Mutation at
Y129/F130/P131 in DGAT2 of baker’s yeast results in a
complete loss of the activity [33]. These three residues
are highly conserved but none of them is completely
conserved among all DGAT2s in our analysis using 54
full-length DGATs (Figure 10A). Mutations at F80/L81/
L83 in mouse DGAT2 [34] and F71/L73 in baker’s yeast
DGAT2 [33] result in partial loss of the DGAT activity
(Figure 10B). Finally, ScDGAT2 has a unique cysteine
residue (C314) which is not involved in catalysis but
may be located near the active site or related to proper
folding of the protein [37]. However, this residue is only
found in DGAT2s from baker’s yeast and the other two
fungi Ashbya gossypii and Physcomitrella patens, but is
not present in any of the other 51 DGAT2s or any of
the 55 DGAT1s analyzed (Figure 10C). Nonetheless,
site-directed mutagenesis indicates that these less conserved residues, although not essential, contribute to the
full activity of DGATs.
Functional significance of the relatively conserved
residues in natural mutants

Two well-known natural mutants in corn and cattle
demonstrate the importance of some relatively conserved residues in TAG biosynthesis (Table 4). Genetic
mapping has identified a high-oil QTL (qHO6) that
affects maize seed oil and oleic-acid contents associated
with DGAT1-2 [38]. A phenylalanine insertion (F469) in
DGAT1-2 is responsible for the increased oil and oleicacid contents. Ectopic expression of the high-oil
DGAT1-2 allele increases oil and oleic-acid contents by
up to 41% and 107%, respectively [38]. This phenylalanine residue is conserved in all plants except Brassica
napus (rape, AAD45536.1) and conserved in all fungi
except mold (Dictyostelium discoideum and Polysphondylium pallidum) (Figure 11A). It is not present in any

K232A

Devoid of milk

[41]

of the animal DGAT1s or any of DGAT2s. This case
suggests that oil content can be potentially improved in
transgenic plants by introducing site-specific amino acid
substitutions/changes in DGATs.
DGAT1 knockout mice are completely devoid of milk
secretion, most likely because of deficient triglyceride
synthesis in the mammary gland [18]. DGAT1
sequences from pooled DNA show significant frequency
shifts at several residue positions between groups of animals with high and low breeding values for milk fat
content in different breeds [41]. Substitution of lysine by
alanine (K232A) is directly responsible for the QTL variation with the lysine-encoding allele being associated
with higher milk fat content [41]. Both DGAT1 alleles
are expressed in Sf9 cells, an insect expression system,
and characterized the expressed proteins. The K allele,
causing an increase in milk fat percentage in the live
animal, is characterized by a higher Vmax in producing
triglycerides than the A allele [46]. This lysine residue is
conserved in mammals but not in plants, fungi or other
animals except one of the two forms from dog and zebrafish (Figure 11B). This case also suggests that lipid
content can be improved in transgenic animals by
bioengineering specific amino acid residues of DGATs.

Conclusions
Understanding the precise roles of DGATs may help to
create transgenic plants with value-added properties and
provide information for therapeutic intervention for
obesity and related diseases because DGATs catalyze the
final and rate-limiting step of TAG biosynthesis in
eukaryotic organisms. This report analyzed 117 DGAT
sequences from 70 organisms ranging from plants, animals and fungi to aid our understanding of the structure-function relationship of these important enzymes.
The report identified conserved sequence motifs and
amino acid residues in all 117 DGATs and DGAT1 and
DGAT2 subfamilies, reassigned some DGAT subfamily
members based on the phylogenetic analysis and

Figure 9 Sequence analysis of important amino acid residues in less conservative regions of DGAT1s. (A) The boxed S residue is
mutated in Tropaeolum majus DGAT1 corresponding to S197, (B) The boxed P residue is mutated in Tropaeolum majus DGAT1 corresponding to
P216. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using 55 full-length DGAT1 protein sequences from 45 organisms (listed in Table 1). Color
code and related information are described briefly in Figure 2 legend and with details in “Methods” section. The amino acid residues studied by
mutagenesis and the corresponding conserved residues in other organisms are boxed within the sequence alignment.

sequence similarities, and discussed the importance of
some conserved residues with site-directed and natural
mutants. One interesting observation is that the newly
reported DGAT3 and DGAT4 sequences do not contain
any of the completely conserved residues in DGAT1s

(41 residues) and DGAT2s (16 residues) in the multiple
sequences alignment. This sequence divergence is in
contrast to the general belief that the active sites of
enzymes should be conserved during the evolution
because all catalyze the same/similar biochemical

Figure 10 Sequence analysis of important amino acid residues in less conservative regions of DGAT2s. (A) YFP motif (The boxed Y, F
and P residues are mutated in baker’s yeast DGAT2 corresponding to Y129/F130/P131), (B) The boxed F, L and L residues are mutated in mouse
DGAT2 corresponding to F80, L81 and L83 and in baker’s yeast DGAT2 corresponding to F71 and L73, (C) The boxed C residue is mutated in
baker’s yeast DGAT2 corresponding to C314. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using 54 full-length DGAT2 protein sequences from 44
organisms (listed in Table 1). Color code and related information are described briefly in Figure 2 legend and with details in “Methods” section.
The amino acid residues studied by mutagenesis and the corresponding conserved residues in other organisms are boxed within the sequence
alignment.

reaction. Therefore, this sequence divergence raises an
important question how proteins with completely different amino acid sequences could perform the same biochemical reaction, although some variations of the
conserved sequence motifs and amino acid residues are
expected when more sequences of DGATs are used in
the multiple sequence alignment.
It has been well-documented that many of the
enzymes in the oil biosynthesis pathway are not stable.
Although the precise reasons are unknown, it is possible that plants develop a feedback mechanism to regulate the optimal amount of enzymes so that the
biophysical properties of ER membranes are

functionally intact without dramatic alterations by
over-expressed enzymes in the host. If this is the case,
it may be advantageous to introduce genes with low
copy numbers but with high catalytic efficiency. This
concept is supported by three studies with plants
(S197 in Arabidopsis and F469 in corn) and animals
(K232 in cattle) which demonstrate the potential to
increase oil/fat production by altering a single amino
acid residue of DGAT1. Therefore, the sequence analysis should facilitate studying the structure-function
relationship of DGATs with the ultimate goal of identifying critical amino acid residues. This will guide the
construction of superb enzymes for metabolic

Figure 11 Sequence analysis of important amino acid residues of DGAT1s shown in natural mutants. Multiple sequence alignment was
performed using 55 full-length DGAT1 protein sequences from 45 organisms (listed in Table 1). The completely conserved amino acid residues
are highlighted in red on yellow. Other color code and related information are described briefly in Figure 2 legend and with details in “Methods”
section. The amino acid residues affected by natural mutation and the corresponding conserved residues in other organisms are boxed within
the sequence alignment. (A) maize DGAT1-2 F468, (B) cattle DGAT1 K232A.

engineering and rational design of DGAT inhibitors to
be used for obesity and related diseases.

Methods
Database search of DGATs

DGAT sequences were obtained from Blastp search
[47,48] using tung tree (Vernicia fordii) DGAT sequences
[GenBank:DQ356680.1] (DGAT1) and [GenBank:
DQ356682.1] (DGAT2) [13] against the National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)’s non-redundant

protein sequence databases http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Blast.cgi. Additional DGAT sequences were obtained
using DGAT1 and DGAT2 search term in NCBI’s Protein
database. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein. A total of
109 full-length and 8 near full-length DGATs were
obtained from 70 organisms including plants (such as Arabidopsis, barley, caster bean, cauliflower, corn, rape, rice,
sorghum, soybean, tobacco, tung tree), animals (such as
bird, chimpanzee, cow, dog, fish, fly, frog, monkey, mosquito, mouse, pig, rabbit, rat, sheep, worm), fungi (such as

yeast, mold, moss) and human. The names of DGATs
used in the analysis and their corresponding organisms,
classification of DGAT subfamily, and the GenBank accession numbers are presented in Table 1. The name of each
protein sequence consists of the initials of the organism
followed by the assigned subfamily of DGATs in the databases and the GenBank accession number.
Protein analysis

The properties and amino acid compositions of DGATs
were analyzed using Vector NTI software (Invitrogen)
[49]. Statistics was performed using Microsoft Excel.
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic analysis was used to study the presumed
evolutionary relationships among the 117 DGATs from
70 organisms. This analysis was performed using the
Vector NTI software (Invitrogen) based on the NeighborJoining method of Saitou and Nei [50]. The numbers in
the parenthesis following DGAT names are the calculated distance values which reflect the degree of divergence between all pairs of DGAT sequences analyzed.
Multiple sequence alignment

Multiple sequence alignment was performed using the
ClustalW algorithm [51,52] of the AlignX program of the
Vector NTI software. This method is based on algorithms that assign scores to aligned residues and detect
sequence similarities. Identical amino acid residues in
alignment have higher scores than those not identical
and less similar residues. Each DGAT sequence name is
on the left of the alignment followed by the position of
amino acid residue of DGAT protein sequence in the
alignment. The numbers at the top of the alignment are
the positions of the multiple sequence alignment. The
letters at the bottom of the alignment are the consensus
residues. Color codes for amino acid residues are as follows: 1) red on yellow: consensus residue derived from a
completely conserved residue at a given position; 2) black
on green: consensus residue derived from the occurrence
of greater than 50% of a single residue at a given position;
3) blue on cyan: consensus residue derived from a block
of similar residues at a given position; 4) green on white:
residue weakly similar to consensus residue at a given
position; 5) black on white: non-similar residues.
