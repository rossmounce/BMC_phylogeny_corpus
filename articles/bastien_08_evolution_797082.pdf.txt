Abstract
Background: Confidence in pairwise alignments of biological sequences, obtained by various methods
such as Blast or Smith-Waterman, is critical for automatic analyses of genomic data. Two statistical models
have been proposed. In the asymptotic limit of long sequences, the Karlin-Altschul model is based on the
computation of a P-value, assuming that the number of high scoring matching regions above a threshold is
Poisson distributed. Alternatively, the Lipman-Pearson model is based on the computation of a Z-value
from a random score distribution obtained by a Monte-Carlo simulation. Z-values allow the deduction of
an upper bound of the P-value (1/Z-value2) following the TULIP theorem. Simulations of Z-value distribution
is known to fit with a Gumbel law. This remarkable property was not demonstrated and had no obvious
biological support.
Results: We built a model of evolution of sequences based on aging, as meant in Reliability Theory, using
the fact that the amount of information shared between an initial sequence and the sequences in its lineage
(i.e., mutual information in Information Theory) is a decreasing function of time. This quantity is simply
measured by a sequence alignment score. In systems aging, the failure rate is related to the systems
longevity. The system can be a machine with structured components, or a living entity or population.
"Reliability" refers to the ability to operate properly according to a standard. Here, the "reliability" of a
sequence refers to the ability to conserve a sufficient functional level at the folded and maturated protein
level (positive selection pressure). Homologous sequences were considered as systems 1) having a high
redundancy of information reflected by the magnitude of their alignment scores, 2) which components are
the amino acids that can independently be damaged by random DNA mutations. From these assumptions,
we deduced that information shared at each amino acid position evolved with a constant rate,
corresponding to the information hazard rate, and that pairwise sequence alignment scores should follow
a Gumbel distribution, which parameters could find some theoretical rationale. In particular, one
parameter corresponds to the information hazard rate.
Conclusion: Extreme value distribution of alignment scores, assessed from high scoring segments pairs
following the Karlin-Altschul model, can also be deduced from the Reliability Theory applied to molecular
sequences. It reflects the redundancy of information between homologous sequences, under functional
conservative pressure. This model also provides a link between concepts of biological sequence analysis
and of systems biology.

Automatic analysis of biological sequences is crucial for
the treatment of massive genomic outputs. Our understanding of more than 90 % of protein sequences stored
in public databases, deduced from automatic translation
of gene sequences, will not result from direct experimentation, but from our ability to predict informative features
using in silico workflows [1,2]. An underlying postulate is
that the molecular sequences determined in biological
individuals or species, which have evolved from a common ancestor sequence and are therefore homologous,
have conserved enough of the original features to be similar. Popular sequence alignment methods, such as Blast
[3] or Smith-Waterman [4] algorithms are used as a starting point for homology searches. All these methods computes a score s(a, b) between two sequences a and b. They
use scoring matrices to maximize the summed scores of
compared residues and find optimal local alignments,
computed with a dynamic programming procedure [3,4].
Scoring matrices have been found to be similarity matrices as well [5]. Many similarity matrices are available [68] and evaluation studies led to the conclusion that all can
be considered as log-odds ratio matrices, including the
BLOSUM family [7] and the PAM family [6]. Log-odds

the random variable S(a, B). A Z-value is then defined as:

w(i , j)

ratio matrices are defined by s(i, j) = log(n (i)n ( j) ) where

ω(i, j) is the joint probability of the amino acid pair (i, j),
and ν(i) and ν(j) the probabilities of the amino acids i and
j in the two aligned sequences.
Because re-examination of alignments obtained after massive comparisons is not manageable, confidence in alignment score probabilities is critical for automatic sequence
comparisons, clustering of orthologs and paralogs,
homology-based annotations or phylogeny reconstructions based on pairwise alignments [2]. Assessing whether
a computed alignment is evolutionarily relevant or
whether it could have arisen simply by chance is therefore
a question that has been extensively studied (for review:
[9]). Two major methods have been proposed.
The first and oldest method, proposed by Lipman and
Pearson [10] and described extensively by Comet et al.
[11] and others [12-14], uses Monte Carlo simulations to
investigate the significance of a score, s calculated from
the alignment of two real sequences a and b. This method
consists in computing η alignments of a with sequences
obtained after shuffling b [15]. The random sequence corresponding to the shuffled sequence b is termed B. The η
alignments allow an estimate of an empirical mean score

Z(a, b ∗ ) =

s−m
s

(1)

where * indicates the sequence that was submitted to randomization.
In practice, the computation of Z(a, b*) is known to be
convergent and depends on the accuracy of the estimation
of μ and σ, and therefore on η, ranging usually from 100
to 1000 [11,16]. Bacro and Comet [12] showed that the
asymptotic law of the Z-value (when η → ∞) was independent of the length and composition of sequences.
Bastien et al. [13] further demonstrated that regardless of
the distribution of the random variable S(a, B), the relation

P(S(a, B)) ≤

1
Z(a,b ∗) 2

(2)

is true. This relation, known as the TULIP theorem, shows
that the Z-value computed for pairwise sequence alignments 1) provides an upper bound of alignment score
probability [13], 2) can be used to reconstruct molecular
phylogenies [14] and 3) is an accurate clustering criterion
to reduce the diversity of protein sequence databases [17].
Here we call T-value the upper bound deduced from the
TULIP theorem, i.e. 1/Z(a, b*)2.
Simulations of Z-value distribution [11,18] shows that it
fits a Gumbel distribution, suggesting that the distribution of alignment scores might follow a Gumbel distribution as well [19].
The second and most popular method proposed by Karlin
and Altschul [20] is an estimate of the probability of an
observed local ungapped alignment score according to an
extreme value distribution (or EVD; for review: [19]), i.e.
a Gumbel distribution, in the asymptotic limit of long
sequences. The remarkable Karlin-Altschul formula is the
consequence of interpreting the number of highest scoring matching regions above a threshold by a Poisson distribution. Briefly, considering A and B two random
sequences, m and n their lengths, given the distribution of
individual residues (i.e. amino acids), and given a scoring
matrix, the number of distinct local alignments with score
values of at least s is approximately Poisson distributed
with mean
E(s) ≈ K.m.n.exp(-λ.s)

(3)

where λ and K can be calculated from the scoring matrix
and average sequence compositions based on the Poisson

distribution hypothesis. E(s) is known as the E-value. As a
consequence, if s is the score obtained after aligning two
real sequences a and b (with m and n their respective
lengths), the probability of finding an ungapped segment
pair with a score lower than or equal to s, follows a Gumbel distribution:
P(S(A, B) ≤ s) ≈ exp(-K.m.n.exp(-λ.s))

(4)

where S(A, B) is the random variable corresponding to the
score of two random sequences. The P-value, defined as
the probability of finding an ungapped segment pair with
a score higher than s, is simply given by 1-P(S(A, B) ≤ s).
Using the Taylor Expansion of equation (4), the P-value is
approximated by the E-value when E(s) < 0.01. The validity of the Karlin-Altschul model depends on restrictive
conditions: firstly, the residue distributions in the compared sequences should not be "too dissimilar" and secondly, the sequence lengths (m an n) should "grow at
roughly equal rates" [20]. The length dependency of alignment scores has been discussed [20,21]. In particular, it
has been demonstrated that the growth of the best matching score of gapped alignments was linear when gap penalties were small, becoming logarithmic when increasing
sequence length and for larger gap penalties [21].
Although the Karlin-Altschul formula given by equation
(4) is not valid for gapped alignments and although no
asymptotic score distribution has been analytically established for local alignments allowing gaps, simulations
[11,18,22,23] showed that, for both local and global
alignments, the Gumbel law was well-suited to the distribution of scores after pragmatic estimation of the λ and K
parameters.
Noticeably, this model relies on the fact that λ is the
unique
positive
solution
to
the
equation

∑n a(i)n b( j) exp{l.s(i, j)} = 0 , for the 20 × 20 combinai, j
tions of i and j amino acids, with νa(i) and νb(j) the probabilities of amino acids i and j in sequences a and b
respectively and s(i, j) the score in the substitution matrix.
From a theoretic point of view, and regardless of the practical performance of the Karlin and Altschul [20] model,
the fact that an observed distribution (the distribution of
scores of real compared sequences) depends on a presupposed and pre-calculated parameter is not satisfactory. It
would be more satisfactory if λ arose as a property of a
biological process and/or features. We addressed therefore
the question of the missing biological rationale to parameters, particularly λ and K, that proved to be valid in pragmatic terms.

In this paper, we deduced biological rationale for the
Gumbel-like distribution of sequence alignment scores
and Z-values, based on a limited number of assumptions
on sequences evolution. An ancestral sequence is the origin of a lineage of homologous sequences that are subjected to evolutionary mechanisms. We considered
homologous sequences as entities sharing structural features, in particular some conserved or functionally similar
amino acids detected by alignment methods. Features that
are preserved in two homologous sequences are estimated
by a shared amount of information (SAI). In this model,
the amount of information shared between an initial
sequence and the sequences in its lineage (i.e., mutual
information in Information Theory) is a decreasing function of time: over time, some substitutions of amino acids
by others having redundant properties (SAI at the residue
level) may be permitted without functional break down,
but leads to a decrease of the SAI between the sequences.
Classically, molecular evolution is formalized with Markovian models for residue substitutions, allowing the backward reconstruction of sequences' evolution with the
assumption that the proteins have been selected for a
functional conservation. Here, proteins were considered
as systems, with a high level of structural redundancy,
which components may "age" over evolution, and "die"
in case of loss of the initial amount of information
required to operate accurately for a given biological function. Assumptions are therefore generalist regarding the
process of sequence evolution, should it be strictly Markovian or not, but they give a formalism to the reliability of
the sequences reflecting the functional status of the folded
and maturated protein, and being a criterion on which
positive selection pressure might act. We introduced
therefore principles of the reliability theory of aging and longevity [24], that apply to a wide range of other systems,
from artificial machines to biological population or
organisms, applied here to molecular sequences. Based on
the deduced model, we could provide biological basis for
the Z-value Gumbel distribution, and significance for the
corresponding Gumbel parameters (termed K' and λ').
Moreover, the assumption that the score between two
sequences a and b should be the highest possible score
between a and b is not necessary to observe an extreme
values distribution for sequence alignment scores.
Major points of the following demonstration are:
i. The evolution of biological sequence is formalized by
the evolution of the SAI between an initial sequence and
sequences of its lineage. It is known that for two
sequences a and b, this is measured by the mutual information I(a; b), based on Information Theory and is exactly
the score s(a, b) computed with standard methods in
sequences comparisons [14].

ii. If a sequence evolves, the probability that it stays near
its "last" position in the sequence space is low and the
longest the sequence, the lowest this probability (consequence of the concentration in a high dimensionality
space [25]). The amount of information shared between
an initial sequence and the sequences in its lineage
decreases with time: as a consequence, one can indifferently use I(a; b) as a measure of the divergence time.

Results and discussion
Assumptions for a model of sequences' evolution
A basic process in the evolution of proteins is the change
of amino acids over time. In the simplest view, these
changes lead to amino acid substitutions, insertions or
deletions. Dayhoff et al. [6] introduced the description of
this process as a continuous-time Markov chain with a
matrix of transition probabilities for the substitutions of
any amino acid into another through time. This model
allows forward and backward expressions of sequence
evolution, under time homogeneity assumption, and is
therefore an important tool for phylogeny reconstructions. Given a transition matrix and an equilibrium distribution of amino acids, then a matrix of amino acid
substitution scores, in the sense of sequences' comparison, can be deduced [26,27].

In the generalist model described here, assumptions
regarding the process of sequence evolution were not formalized, should this process be strictly Markovian or not.
Given two sequences, one can, one the one hand, compute a score using dynamic algorithms [3,4] and deduce
the distribution of random scores from transition matrices under the hypothesis that the two sequences have
evolved according to a continuous-time Markov chains
process. On the other hand, Henikoff et al. [7] demonstrated the possibility to calculate efficient log-odd matrices without the need of this assumption. Altschul [28] and
Bastien et al. [14] demonstrated that log-odd matrices
could be reformulated in the Information Theory framework. In particular, a score between two amino acids i and
j can be interpreted as the mutual information between
these two residues. At the 3D folded protein level, a
molecular function emerges from the information
encrypted in the amino acid sequence, and positive selection pressure acts therefore at the sequence level, maintaining a sufficient portion of the initial information, and
consequently the functional status of the folded and maturated protein. We therefore focused on the evolution of
the information shared between an initial sequence and
the sequences of its lineage through time.
Reliability theory and biological sequences evolution
The Reliability Theory is a general theory about systems
aging, in which the failure rate (the rate by which systems
deteriorate) is related to the systems longevity (For review,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/332

[24]). The system can be a machine with structured components, or a living entity or population. "Reliability" of a
system (or of one of its components) refers to its ability to
operate properly according to a standard [29]. The relation between the age of a system and its failure rate shows
that aging is a direct consequence of redundancies within
the system. For instance, when applied to a biological system in which redundant vital structures ensure a function,
damage of a component that is compensated by another
redundant intact one, does not lead to a complete impairment of the system. Defects do accumulate, resulting in
redundancy exhaustion and giving rise to the phenomenon of aging. As the system (or one of its components)
degenerates into a system with no redundancy, new
defects can eventually lead to death. Reliability of the system (or component) is described by the "reliability function" R(x), also named "survival function", which is the
probability that the system (or component) will carry out
its mission through time x [30], expressed as the probability that the failure time X is beyond time x:
R(x) = P(X > x) = 1 - P(X ≤ x) = 1 - F(x)

(5)

where F(x) = P(X ≤ x) is a cumulative distribution function
[24] reflecting the resistance of the system to failures (at
time x, distribution of the probability that the system
could have failed previously). R(x) evaluates therefore the
probability that the systems becomes completely defective
after a time x (x can be a direct measure of time t or an
increasing function of time).
The "hazard rate"h(x), also called "failure rate", is defined
as the relative rate for reliability function decline:

h( x) = −

dR( x)
d(log R( x))
=−
R( x).dx
dx

(6)

Hazard rate is equivalent to mortality force in demography [31,32]. When h(x) is a constant h, the system does
not deteriorate more often with age, and is therefore a
non-aging system. In this case, a simple integration of
equation (6) leads to
R(x) = R(0)exp(-h.x)

(7)

which is the exponential distribution that characterizes
non-aging systems. Interestingly, a system with redundant
non-aging components can be an aging system. That is to say
the hazard rate of a system of components depends can
depends of time whereas the hazard rate of components
do not
As discussed by Gavrilov and Gravrilova [24], the "reliability theory" provided explanations for some fundamental problems regarding aging, longevity, death of

organisms within populations. Organisms or populations
are considered as systems in which categories of components (molecules, biological processes, cells, individuals,
etc.) can be highly redundant, and be key elements for the
system longevity.
Here, we propose to consider the particular case of protein
sequences as a system, in which redundancy is ensured:
i. by the number of residue positions involved in the evolution process.
ii. at the residue level by the existence of functionally
redundant amino acids (e.g. after a DNA damage that
leads to a genetic mutation, an aspartic acid may be substituted by a functionally redundant glutamic acid), i.e.
the existence of a SAI for all amino acids pairs.
In this model, evolutionary time is negatively correlated
to the amount of information shared between an initial
sequence and sequences in its lineage (SAI decreases with
time, see below).
The conservation rate: a mathematical tool to study the
evolution of the information shared by biological
sequences
To measure the rate of conservation of a shared structure/
function relationship at time x within a system of homologous proteins (i.e. the time of observation), we considered that the decay of information shared between an
original sequence and sequences of its lineage was a function of time, and therefore a mean to measure time. Evolutionary time is therefore measured here in information
units. We defined an information conservation rate Ψ as follows:
Definition
Given the cumulative distribution function F(x) = P(X ≤ x)
(Probability that the system shared less than x information units with a reference), supposed continuously differentiable, the conservation rate Ψ is given by:

y ( x) = lim

dx →0

P( x − dx < X ≤ x / X ≤ x)
dx

(8)

The conservation rate is simply related to the hazard function, measuring a quantity that decreases over time
(shared information) instead of a quantity that increases
over time (age). Given f(x) = dF(x)/dx the density function
of x, this conservation rate has the following properties.

y ( x) =

Derivation of the distribution of sequence alignment scores
based on the distribution of mutual information between
amino acids
Dobzhansky [33] and Wu et al. [34] established that information harbored by a protein 1) emerged from the threedimensional self organization of its residues (i.e. the
sequence of amino acids) and had to do with information
harbored by amino acids, and 2) was submitted through
time to evolutionary pressure (achievement of a minimal
functional level fitting environmental and species survival
conditions). Using previous empirical results [6,7,35],
Bastien et al. [14] have shown that the alignment score of
two homologous sequences a and b was proportional to
the estimate of the SAI due to their common origin and
parallel evolution under similar conservative pressure, i.e.
the mutual information I(a; b) between the two events a and
b in the sense of Hartley [36,37]:

s(a, b) = ξ.I (a; b)

(13)

with ξ a constant defining the unity (ξ = 1, in bits) and s(a,
b) the sum of the elementary scores for all aligned positions (including gap opening and gap extension penalties). Mutual information between two events a and b
(differing from the mutual information defined between
random variables, see [14,38]) measures the information
gained by the knowledge of event a on the occurrence of
event b. The mutual information being additive, I(a; b) is
the sum of the mutual information of aligned residues,
reflecting the magnitude of the redundancy between the
sequences at the amino acid level. Mutual information
between residues is therefore simply deduced from the 20
× 20 amino acid substitution matrix [6-8,35] used to compute the alignment.
Inside a given sequence, mutual information was also
shown to reflect the dependency of close or remote amino
acids, a phenomenon known as the residue co-evolution,
due to their co-contribution to the sequence function
[39,40].

Over time, an amino acid i is either conserved or substituted. The similarity of i in an initial sequence compared
with residues at the same position in protein descendants
is therefore either that of identity (the diagonal term in
the scoring matrix) or a lower value(no score is higher
than that of identity). In average, the magnitude of the
similarity of i compared with its descendants, related to
mutual information following equation (13), is therefore
a decreasing function of elapsed time. On a functional
point of view, the probability that i was mutated into a
residue with a score Si lower than a threshold si defined to
allow the component to operate like i, can be deduced
from the distribution of substitution scores. For most
amino acids (F, P, W, Y, V, E, G, H, I, L, K, R, N, D and C),
the distribution of scores deduced from BLOSUM 62 fits
an exponential distribution (see the case of valine in Figure 1A. For five amino acids (M, S, T, A and Q), the distribution of scores does not fit an exponential distribution
(see the case of Threonine in Figure 1B). Taking the average situation, the distribution of scores deduced from the
BLOSUM 62 matrix is exponential-like (Figure 1C) supporting a general model for amino acids mutual information distribution: The probability Pr that a residue i is
mutated into a residue with mutual information below si
is:
Pr(Si ≤ si) = 1-exp(-λi.si)

(14)

where λi is the constant information hazard rate, or failure
rate, for reliability function decline of the amino acid mutual
information.
Given a sequence a, what is the probability that any of its
m residues (termed i) had previously mutated into the n
residues (termed j) of a sequence b and leads to the
observed mutual information between sequence a and
sequence b? We can consider m ≠ n due to insertion or
deletion events. If m and n are large, we can state the following asymptotic approximations: S ≈ m Si , with

Considering a protein as a system, which components are
amino acids, we examined the mutual information
between the original components and their descendants,
and how amino acid mutation affected the evolution of
mutual information between proteins. We simply
hypothesized that an amino acid may mutate over time
following random DNA mutations and look at the behavior of the entire system, namely the protein which can be
measured here by the mutual information between the
initial residues and the new ones, i.e. the corresponding
substitution scores in a 20 × 20 substitution matrix. The
substitution matrix is considered as an estimate of the
mutual information between residues because it was computed from real sequences' data [6-8,35].

Aging properties of amino acids
Aging properties of amino acids. Protein sequences are
considered as systems, which components are amino acids.
Over time, either amino acids are conserved (similarity of a
residue with its descendant is that of identity, diagonal term
of a substitution matrix) or modified due to random DNA
mutations. Similarity decreases therefore with time, since no
similarity is higher than that of identity. When the similarity
falls below a threshold that is necessary for the residue to
operate according to a standard (functional conservation),
the component is damaged. (A) Score distribution corresponding to valine substitution. In this case, the score
distribution is exponential, suggesting that valine (V) is a nonaging component. Based on BLOSUM62, residues of this type
are V, F, P, W, Y, E, G, H, I, L, K, R, N, D and C (B) Score
distribution corresponding to threonine substitution. The score distribution shows a peak, indicating a probable accelerated process of aging (functional damage) when
the residue is substituted by random mutation in some other

scores is characterized by the same parameter (λ' = 0.287).

discussion of these approximations, see [41]). In the
asymptotic limit of long sequences, we can envisage different scenarios for the evolution of a into b:

In a first step (Figure 2, step 1), the probability that one
residue a1 is mutated into a residue b1 with mutual information below si is given:
Pr(Si ≤ si) = Pr(Si ≤ s(a1,b1)) ≈ Pr( Si ≤ si )

Considering the approximation of Si and si respectively
by S/m and s/m, we deduce the final formula:
P(S ≤ s) = (Pr(S ≤ s))K'.m.n

(18)

(15)
The density function f(s) is therefore given by:

Considering one possible evolutionary scenario, i.e. one
alignment (Figure 2, step 2), residues are considered as
independent and the probability is the product of elementary probabilities for each positions aligned in this scenario. For the alignment of the m amino acids of sequence
a, we obtain the following probability:
Pscenario1 (S ≤ s) = (Pr( Si ≤ si ))m

(16)

Alternative scenarios are also possible (Figure 2, step 3).
The final probability is therefore computed taking into
account all possible evolutionary paths (all possible alignments, Figure 2, step 3) and using K'<1 a correcting factor
for edge effects, deletion and insertion points:

Computing of the probabilityis lower than a threshold s
Computing of the probability that the amount of
information shared by two sequences, S, is lower
than a threshold s. Given an initial sequence a, we can
envisage different scenarios for its evolution into another
sequence b. In a first step (Step 1), an elementary probability
is computed by taking into account the evolution of just one
residue (here a1 into b1). Considering one possible evolutionary scenario (Step 2), residues are considered as independent and the probability is the product of elementary
probabilities for each positions aligned in this scenario, with
approximations in the asymptotic limit of long sequences.
The final probability (Step 3) is then estimated by taking into
account all the possible evolutionary scenarios.

Using equation (12), we deduce that the distribution of
alignment scores should respect the general form of the
Karlin-Altschul formula:
P(S ≤ s) ≈ exp(K'.m.n.exp(-λ'.s))

(23)

Applications and Conclusion
We built a model of evolution of the information shared
between an initial molecular sequence and the sequences
of its lineage (i.e. homologous sequences). Sequences
were considered as systems, which components are the
amino acids that can independently be damaged by random DNA mutations. Residues harbor a functional
redundancy reflected by the amino acid substitution
scores.

From these assumptions, we deduced that the pairwise
sequence alignment score should follow a Gumbel distri-

bution (equation (22)). The λ' parameter is the information hazard rate for the reliability of amino acids' mutual
information: it depends 1) on the distribution of the
amino acids and 2) on the distribution of amino acid similarities deduced from a substitution matrix. The K'
parameter has a more complex meaning, because it
depends on likelihood of an alignment of two sequences,
with edge effects, gaps, length difference and repartition
of the information (the local score) in the alignment. It
reflects therefore internal structural constraints on the
evolution of sequences.
The Gumbel parameters for score alignments can be estimated by two kinds of simulations. First is by adjusting
EVD to the simulated distribution of scores [19,22]. In
that case, it is simpler to express the Gumbel law as

P(S ≤ s) ≈ exp(− exp(−

s −q
))
b

(24)

with b = l ′ and q = l ′ log(l ′.K ′.m.n) . The estimate of
Gumbel parameters is achieved by determining β and θ,
allowing an easy estimate of the λ' and K' parameters of
equation (23). Second estimation of the Gumbel parameters is by computing the Z-value corresponding to the simulation of score distribution. Using the fact that for a
2

Gumbel distribution, μ = θ + γβ and s 2 = p6 b 2 , then
the Z-value allows a computation of the β and θ constants.
Simulations of Z-value distribution [11,18] showed that it
fitted with a Gumbel law. Based on the Gumbel distribution of scores (equations (24) and (25)) and by an appropriate change of variable with equation (1), then the
distribution of Z-values should respect the following
equality:

P( Z ≤ z) = exp(−. exp(− z

p
− g ))
6

(25)

with γ the Euler-Mascheroni constant (γ ≈ 0.5772). Equation (25) is the precise expression of the distribution of Zvalues deduced by Pearson [18] from simulations. It is
important to note that this expression of the Z-value distribution is independent of sequence lengths and amino
acid distributions.
This consideration has practical implications, since it
allows a refined estimate of the P-value based on Z-value
computation, and a real gain over available methods, particularly in some documented cases where the Karlin-Altschul formula failed to assess the significance of an
alignment. Table 1 shows for instance the different statistical estimates for the alignment of two homologous

TFIIA gamma sequences from Plasmodium falciparum and
Arabidopsis thaliana. The compositional bias in the proteome of Plasmodium falciparum, the malarial parasite, is
known to limit the use of Karlin-Altschul statistics for
pairwise comparisons with unbiased proteins such as
those of Arabidopsis thaliana [42]. The TFIIA gamma subunit sequence of Plasmodium could not be deduced from
BLASTP-based homology searches [43]. The Blastp apparent search failure was due to the overestimate of the Pvalue following the Karlin-Altschul formula (0.008, using
unfiltered BLASTP, see Table 1). Alignment score Z-value,
computed with either Blastp (P. Ortet, unpublished algorithm) or Smith-Waterman was above 10. The upper
bound for the P-value based on the TULIP theorem, given
by the formula T-value = 1/Z-value2 [13], was therefore
below 10-2. Eventually, the P-value deduced from the Zvalue Gumbel distribution was below 10-6 (see Table 1)
indicating that, for both the Blastp and Smith-Waterman
methods, the homology could be statistically assessed,
even in the limit case of unbiased vs biased sequence comparisons. We noticed that the asymmetric DirAtPf100
matrix specified for Plasmodium vs. Arabidopsis comparisons that we developed earlier [8] allowed an additional
gain in estimating this missed homology.
Besides a theoretical support for pragmatic observations,
this report shows therefore that the alignment score Gumbel distribution is a particular and general evolutionary
law for molecular sequences taken as dynamical systems.
This model can be parameterized using the Karlin-Altschul or the Z-Value form. If Karlin-Altschul model parameters are well-estimated (using simulations for example),
both forms are equivalent in practice as reported by
Table 1: Alignment statistics of the homologous Transcription
initiation factor IIA (TFIIA) gamma chain sequences from
Plasmodium falciparum and Arabidopsis thaliana.

TFIIA gamma sequences from Plasmodium (UniProtKB

aligned with Blastp and Smith-Waterman methods. Statistics were
computed following the Karlin-Altschul model (as implemented in the
Blastp algorithm) or the Lipman-Pearson Z-value model. The upper
bound for the P-value based on the TULIP theorem is given following
the formula: T-value = 1/Z-value2. The P-value deduced from the Z-value
Gumbel distribution was computed following the model presented
here. Substitution matrices were either BLOSUM62, or the
asymmetric DirAtPf100 matrix specified for Plasmodium vs. Arabidopsis
comparisons. NA: not applicable.

Hulsen et al. [44]. This model shows that an extreme value
distribution of alignment scores can arise not only by considering high scoring segments pairs. Indeed, derivation
of a Gumbel distribution from maximum independent
random variables is a well-known technique [19] and the
Karlin-Altschul theorem was first demonstrated, based on
this consideration [20]. We can now state that this distribution allows a different interpretation in the light of the
Reliability Theory, reflecting the redundancy of information between sequences due to both the number of residues and the shared information between these residues.
The model elaboration described here additionally provides a link between concepts of biological sequence analysis and the emerging field of systems biology, with a
generalization of the aging concepts to all scales of the living world.
