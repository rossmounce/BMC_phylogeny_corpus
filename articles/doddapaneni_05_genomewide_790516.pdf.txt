Abstract
Background: Phanerochaete chrysosporium, the model white rot basidiomycetous fungus, has the extraordinary ability to
mineralize (to CO2) lignin and detoxify a variety of chemical pollutants. Its cytochrome P450 monooxygenases have
recently been implied in several of these biotransformations. Our initial P450 cloning efforts in P. chrysosporium and its
subsequent whole genome sequencing have revealed an extraordinary P450 repertoire ("P450ome") containing at least
150 P450 genes with yet unknown function. In order to understand the functional diversity and the evolutionary
mechanisms and significance of these hemeproteins, here we report a genome-wide structural and evolutionary analysis
of the P450ome of this fungus.
Results: Our analysis showed that P. chrysosporium P450ome could be classified into 12 families and 23 sub-families and
is characterized by the presence of multigene families. A genome-level structural analysis revealed 16 organizationally
homogeneous and heterogeneous clusters of tandem P450 genes. Analysis of our cloned cDNAs revealed structurally
conserved characteristics (intron numbers and locations, and functional domains) among members of the two
representative multigene P450 families CYP63 and CYP505 (P450foxy). Considering the unusually complex structural
features of the P450 genes in this genome, including microexons (2–10 aa) and frequent small introns (45–55 bp),
alternative splicing, as experimentally observed for CYP63, may be a more widespread event in the P450ome of this
fungus. Clan-level phylogenetic comparison revealed that P. chrysosporium P450 families fall under 11 fungal clans and the
majority of these multigene families appear to have evolved locally in this genome from their respective progenitor genes,
as a result of extensive gene duplications and rearrangements.
Conclusion: P. chrysosporium P450ome, the largest known todate among fungi, is characterized by tandem gene clusters
and multigene families. This enormous P450 gene diversity has evolved by extensive gene duplications and intragenomic
recombinations of the progenitor genes presumably to meet the exceptionally high metabolic demand of this
biodegradative group of basidiomycetous fungi in ecological niches. In this context, alternative splicing appears to further
contribute to the evolution of functional diversity of the P450ome in this fungus. The evolved P450 diversity is consistent
with the known vast biotransformation potential of P. chrysosporium. The presented analysis will help design future P450
functional studies to understand the underlying mechanisms of secondary metabolism and oxidative biotransformation
pathways in this model white rot fungus.

Background
The cytochrome P450 monooxygenases ("P450s") constitute a large superfamily of heme-thiolate proteins widely
distributed in different life forms including prokaryotes
(archaea, bacteria), lower eukaryotes (fungi, insects), and
higher eukaryotes (plants and animals). P450s play an
important role in the metabolism of a wide variety of
endogenous and xenobiotic compounds. The current
P450 nomenclature [1] is based on divergent evolution of
the P450 superfamily. On the basis of sequence homology, all P450s can be categorized into two main classes, B
('bacterial') and E ('eukaryotic') [2]. Bacterial P450s with
three component systems [an FAD-containing flavoprotein (NADPH or NADH-dependent reductase), an ironsulphur protein, and the P450 hemeprotein] and the fungal P450nor (CYP55) [3] belong to the 'B'-class. All the
other known P450s from distinct systems, including
eukaryotic P450s and bacterial P450s such as P450BM3
(CYP102) from Bacillus megaterium [4], belong to the 'E'class. The eukaryotic microsomal P450 system contains
two components, the NADPH:P450 oxidoreductase
(POR), a flavoprotein containing both FAD and FMN,
and the P450 monooxygenase containing the heme
domain. The prokaryotic (bacterial) soluble P450
monooxygenase P450BM3 (CYP102) exists as a single
protein with both heme and flavin functional domains.
Typically, the bacterial P450s are soluble and shorter
(approximately 400 amino acids) in length, whereas the
eukaryotic P450s average around 500–600 amino acids or
larger and are membrane-bound. The amino acid (aa)
sequence of these P450 monooxygenase proteins is
extremely diverse, with levels of identity as low as 16% in
some cases, but their structural fold has remained the
same throughout evolution. The existing data suggest that
divergence of the P450 superfamily into B and E classes,
and further divergence into stable P450 groups within the
E class, is very ancient and had occurred before the
appearance of eukaryotes [5]. From the phylogenetic classification point of view, families have been identified
based primarily on amino acid sequence similarity, with
less than 40% similarity defining a family and 40–55%
similarity defining a sub-family. Recently, the concept of
"Clan" which represents higher order grouping of P450
families is gaining wider acceptance in the P450 community [6,7].
Among the different phyla, plants have the highest
number of P450 sequences, followed by fungi. So far,
more than 380 fungal P450s have been identified and the
number is increasing with the sequencing of new fungal
genomes
http://drnelson.utmem.edu/
cytochromeP450.html. In comparison to the yeast forms
(Saccharomyces and Candida), the higher order fungi
have a larger number of P450 sequences in their genomes,
with 41 P450 genes predicted in Neurospora crassa , 111 in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/92

Aspergillus spp ., 123 in Magnaporthe grisea , 110 in Fusarium graminearum and about 150 in Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Assuming the possibility that the present day
P450s have evolved from a single ancestor P450 gene, the
large disparity in the P450 gene count among the different
phyla and genera is reflective of the differences in metabolic demand. According to Nelson [8], while plants have
invested heavily on biochemistry for development of survival strategies thereby driving the P450s to expand rapidly, animals have invested on development of higher
order sensory systems and hence carry comparatively
fewer P450s. Fungi, which resemble plants in their sedentary habitat, appear to have driven P450s to diversify
rapidly.
Phanerochaete chrysosporium , the model white rot fungus,
has the extraordinary ability to degrade and mineralize (to
CO2) lignin, the earth's most abundant aromatic polymer,
and a wide range of toxic chemical pollutants. Lignin biodegradation occurs under nutrient-limited conditions
when the fungus enters secondary metabolism. Only
white rot fungi are known to possess the ability to completely degrade lignin [9],[10],[11]. The working hypothesis is that initial depolymerization of the lignin by
extracellular peroxidases releases chemical compounds
that are internalized and further degraded by diverse intracellular enzymes, including P450 monooxygenases. Further, several studies have shown that this fungus can
degrade and mineralize a broad spectrum of aromatic, alicyclic, and aliphatic chemical pollutants under both nutrient-limited (ligninolytic) and nutrient-sufficient (nonligninolytic) conditions. Lately, P450 monooxygenases
have been shown to be involved in several of these
biotransformations and this has led to an increasing interest in the characterization of cytochrome P450 systems in
this model white rot fungus.
Initial cloning efforts from this laboratory identified the
first complete P450 system genes in P. chrysosporium.
These efforts led to the isolation [12] and functional characterization [14,15,17] of three full-length P450 genes pc1, pc-2 and pc-3 that were assigned to CYP63 family, and
the P450 oxidoreductase gene (POR ) that is responsible
for electron transfer to the multiple P450 monooxygenases [16]. Subsequent whole genome sequencing by the
Joint Genome Institute (JGI) of the US Department of
Energy (US-DOE) has led to the identification of a large
P450 contingent (P450ome) in P. chrysosporium [13]. The
P450 genes constitute nearly 1% of the coding sequences
in the genome of this basidiomycetous fungus [13]. Of
the nearly 150 P450 monooxygenase genes identified in
P. chrysosporium genome, 108 have been assembled fulllength and tentatively annotated based on general overall
sequence homology analysis [13]. To date, this is the
highest number of P450s identified in any fungus, which

appears to be one of the major underlying factors for its
extraordinary catalytic potential. Understanding the structural and evolutionary aspects of such large family of
P450s in conjunction with their physiological characteristics will help understand the functional versatility of this
fungus. This study reports a detailed genome-wide structural and phylogenetic analysis of the P450ome of P.
chrysosporium , coupled with cloning and characterization
of new cDNAs for selected multigene P450 families, with
a broader aim to facilitate the classification/nomenclature
and to understand the functional diversity and evolution
of the P450s in this wood-rotting model white rot fungus.

Results and Discussion
I. Structural analysis and characterization of P.
chrysosporium P450ome
P450ome of P. chrysosporium
Our phylogenetic analysis coupled with the standard
sequence homology criterion for P450 nomenclature
revealed that P. chrysosporium P450s fall into 12 families
and 23 sub-families (Figure 1). This family and sub-family
classification is based on the amino acid sequence similarity using the existing criteria of less than 40% similarity
defining a family and less than 55% similarity defining a
sub-family as followed by the International P450 Nomenclature Committee. Earlier we had reported an initial phylogenetic grouping of 163 predicted P450 sequences
(including even partial fragments) into 26 clusters based
on overall general homology criterion [15]. Here we
report the phylogenetic grouping of 126 P450 genes in 12
families and 23 sub-families using the P450 family/subfamily homology-based criterion. To eliminate the possibility of bias in grouping, only full-length or near fulllength P450 sequences with more than 300 aa residues
were used for constructing the tree in this study. Of the 12
families, the International P450 Nomenclature Committee so far has named only three families including the
highly conserved families CYP51 and CYP61, and the
newly designated P. chrysosporium family CYP63. Nevertheless, based on the < 40% homology criterion, nine
other families, each with varying degree of similarity to
the existing one or more P450 families, were identifiable
and were arbitrarily designated as follows: CYP58/53,
CYP62, CYP64, CYP67, CYP503, CYP505, CYP5031/547,
CYP614/534, CYP617/CYP547. As compared to the
recently reported analysis [13], we have added 18 P450
genes grouped as three new clusters in the tree. Individual
genes from these clusters, when compared to the P450
sequences available at the P450 BLAST server http://
132.192.64.52/blast/P450.html, showed highest similarity to the P450 families CYP617/547, CYP614/534 and
CYP5031/547, respectively. These three sets of CYP names
thus represent the families newly added to our phylogenetic tree (Figure 1).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/92

Among the 12 P450 families, the CYP64 family has the
highest number (more than fifty) of member genes, followed by CYP67 (sixteen), CYP503 (fourteen), CYP58/53
(ten), CYP63 (seven), CYP505 (seven), CYP614/534
(seven), CYP617/547 (six), CYP5031/CYP547 (two),
whereas P450 families CYP51, CYP61 and CYP62 consist
of only one member gene each.
The International Nomenclature Committee on cytochrome P450s has been annotating the new P450
sequences on the basis of the existing primary amino acid
sequence similarity criteria. However, there have been
instances where the 40% similarity rule in defining a family has been relaxed, such as in naming the mammalian
CYP4 family [7]. Simultaneously, the usage of CYP
"Clans" which are higher-order clusters of related families
is gaining consensus [6,7]. In view of this, a clan-based
classification of the P450 families in P. chrysosporium is
presented and discussed in subsequent sections, with an
aim to understand their evolution and functional
significance.
Cloning of new P450 cDNAs
Our initial studies on cloning of cDNAs for the first
cloned P450 gene pc-1 [12] and the related gene pc-3 [17],
both belonging to CYP63 family, indicated a complex
structural organization of P450 genes in P. chrysosporium.
In an effort to further understand the structural organization of P450 genes in this system, the following additional
cDNA sequences for the other CYP63 genes were isolated
in the present study: pc-2 (1842 bp), pc-4 (430 bp), pc-5
(324 bp) and pc-6 (330 bp). The isolated cDNA sequences
(full-length and partial) were then compared with the corresponding predicted coding sequences in the genome.
This gene/cDNA analysis helped understand the gene features of the first multigene P450 family (CYP63) identified in this organism [12]. The analysis also helped
identify an additional gene, pc-7, groupable under this
family. Furthermore, we isolated a cDNA sequence representing the C-terminus half (the reductase domain) of
one of the fused P450foxy-like genes, pc-foxy1. The cloned
cDNA (681 bp), that spans 747 bp of the corresponding
genomic region, helped identify the structural features of
the P450foxy gene family (CYP505) of the P450ome.
Gene features (introns, exons and deduced coding regions) of the P.
chrysosporium P450s
i). CYP63 family
The cloned CYP63 cDNA sequences revealed that the
member genes carry 6–14 introns with conserved GT/AG
splice junctions and encode 571 to 603 aa proteins. The
deduced proteins contain transmembrane domains in
their N-terminus region centered around 21–57 aa residues with a matrix score of more than 1000 as determined
by TMpred analysis, indicating that these proteins are

membrane bound. The seven CYP63 members (pc-1
through pc-7) are groupable into three sub-families,
CYP63A (pc-1 through pc-4), CYP63B (pc-5 and pc-6), and
CYP63C (pc-7). The three CYP63A member genes pc-1
(CY63A1), pc-2 (CY63A2) and pc-3 (CY63A3) are tandemly linked in that order with 322 bp and 469 bp intergenic regions. Their intron organization (number and
position) and the number of amino acids encoded are
nearly the same (Figure 2), suggesting that the three genes
are paralogous genes and originated by tandem duplication. The typical P450 motifs including heme-binding
region (HR2), helix-I, and helix-K showed high sequence
conservation among the seven CYP63 member proteins
(Figure 3).
ii). P450foxy gene family (CYP505)
The P. chrysosporium whole genome sequence revealed
seven fused oxidoreductase-P450 proteins ("P450foxy"
proteins), of which 5 are located on a 43 kb stretch of the
genome scaffold 73. The process of deducing the amino
acid sequences for these genes was guided in part by the
pc-foxy1 cDNA cloned in this study, in conjunction with
the gene characteristics of the known P450foxy sequence
of Fusarium oxysporum [18], and the earlier reported P450
splicing pattern in P. chrysosporium [12]. Analysis of the
P450foxy genes revealed 17 to 22 introns, of which 11 are
conserved in all the seven member genes (Figure 4). The
cloned pc-foxy1 cDNA fragment (681 bp) contained splicing site for a single Type-II intron (66 bp) with defined
GT/AG splice junction. The reductase portion of the
cloned pc-foxy1 cDNA contained two FAD and three
NADPH functional domains and showed deduced aa
homology to the distal region of the P450 oxidoreductase

(POR) protein of this organism. The full-length (736 aa)
functional POR earlier reported for P. chrysosporium has
multiple domains, including 3 FMN, 3 FAD and 3
NADPH domains [16]. However, except for the proximal
FAD domain, the degree of motif conservation was poor
between the two reductase sequences (pc-foxy1 reductase
component and the POR), suggesting that the reductase
component of the P450foxy fusion genes has an independent descent and is not duplicated from the native
POR gene.
The five P450foxy member genes on genome scaffold 73
show divergent transcription, with the three member
genes (ug.73.17.1, pc.73.4.1 and pc.73.14.1) transcribing
from the same strand, whereas the other two genes
(ug.73.15.1 and ug.73.16.1) transcribing from the opposite strand of DNA. The deduced P450foxy proteins containing 624–1111 amino acid residues show high aa
similarity (> 55%) among them and hence can be classified under the same sub-family. The general domain
architecture of these proteins is the same as that of the earlier reported P450foxy protein from F. oxysporum [18],
with an N-terminal P450 segment and a C-terminal
reductase segment. All seven proteins have a full-length
P450 segment with conserved P450 signature sequences.
However, the reductase segment is full-length in only 6 of
the seven members and is truncated in the member gene
gx.187.5.1. These six member proteins contain a transmembrane domain, centered around 908–920 aa positions with a matrix score of more than 1000, as detected
by TMpred analysis. The truncated member contains a
transmembrane domain centered on amino acid residue
570. The above analysis points to the membrane-bound

nature of these fused proteins similar to the homologous
F. oxysporum protein and consistent with the membranebound nature of most of the eukaryotic P450 and POR
proteins.
It is unusual that P. chrysosporium has only one P450 oxidoreductase (POR) gene to cater to such a large contingent
of P450 monooxygenases for the electron supply, with the
exception of P450foxy proteins (see below). This suggests
a more significant role of alternate electron transfer proteins such as cytochromes b5 and b5 reductase in this
organism; it will, however, require further functional
characterization to prove this assumption. The P450foxy
proteins appear to be self sufficient in their electron transfer mechanism considering the presence of a complete
reductase partner (with all needed functional domains) as
a part of the fusion protein. Such electron transfer function of the reductase component was experimentally demonstrated in the first known P450foxy fusion protein of
the ascomycete fungus Fusarium oxysporum [18].
iii). Gene features of other P450ome genes
Among the other P450 families in the P450ome, the
CYP64 family has the most genes (54), with member
genes carrying 5–12 introns of size 21–268 bp, and
encoding 350–534 aa size proteins. Detailed gene features
of the other individual P450 families of the P. chrysosporium P450ome are listed in Table 1.

Typically, all the full-length assembled P450 genes were
found to carry multiple exons frequently interrupted by
small introns. In this analysis, we observed a relatively

narrow size range for introns (21 to 620 bp) as compared
to the exons; the shortest exon is 6 bp (2 aa) and the longest is 1048 bp (Table 1). Nearly half of the P450 genes
show small exons (upto 67 bp), with 41 genes carrying 29
bp or shorter exons (Table 1). Interestingly, the P450ome
genes contain microexons (encoding 2–10 aa) that are
spread genome-wide and are not restricted to any particular P450 family. Such ubiquitous occurrence of the microexons in P. chrysosporium P450 genes points to their
potential role in conferring functional diversity and
emphasizes the fact that the functional divergence is not
merely a product of gene duplication/translocation. In
comparison to the P450 genes, the intron size range in the
most intensively characterized peroxidase gene family of
this organism is 49–78 bp, with 49 to 78 bp for the lignin
peroxidase (LiP) sub-family and 50 to 72 bp for the manganese-dependent peroxidase (MnP) sub-family. Furthermore, as revealed by the whole genome sequencing, the
presence of relatively small introns (average 117 bp)
appears typical of this genome as compared to the higher
eukaryotic genomes [13].
P450 gene clustering and tandem genes
The P. chrysosporium genome shows a total of 16 P450
gene clusters, with up to 11 member genes in a cluster. Of
the 16 clusters, three clusters are located on scaffold 30,
two each on scaffolds 20, 24, and 73, and one each on
scaffolds 1, 16, 50, 53 59, 79 and 97. For convenience, the
clusters have been assigned numbers 1 through 16 in the
order they appear on the individual genomic scaffolds.
Among these, cluster-5 has the highest number of tandem
genes (eleven) followed by cluster-3 (five) and cluster-6

Page 7 of 24

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:92

(four) (Table 2). The earlier cloned tandem CYP63 genes
pc-1, pc-2 and pc-3 represent cluster-4.
There is a high sequence similarity (up to 84%) among
the members of a given cluster and the cluster members
fall under the same P450 family on the phylogenetic tree
(Figure 1; Table 2). The number of introns and exons and
their relative positions in the member genes of a cluster
are conserved in 10 of the 16 clusters (Table 2). Two
distinct patterns exist for the intron organization (number
and position) within each cluster. In the case of small
gene clusters (2–3 member genes), the number and relative position of introns as well as the size of the exons are
conserved among the members, whereas the larger gene
clusters (> 3 member genes) show varying degrees of dissimilarity in these characteristics. While the conserved
gene characteristics suggest more recent duplications, the
dissimilarity suggests either more distant duplication
events or translocation events. Therefore, the P. chrysosporium genome shows both homogeneous and heterogeneous clusters of tandem genes. Tandem duplicates
(paralogous genes), which initially are structurally and
functionally identical, diverge with time due to mutations
or translocations. It is plausible that one copy retains the
original function, while the second copy either acquires a
new function that is selected to meet the increased metabolic demand or gets deleted from the genome. In this
context, it is noteworthy that member genes of cluster-4
(pc-1, pc-2 and pc-3), though closely spaced and structurally highly homogeneous, showed non-coordinate regulation of transcription and varying substrate inducibility
[14,17]. While such substrate diversity among the members of tandemly linked P450 genes has been observed in
the yeast Candida maltosa [19], this observation is new in
the context of filamentous fungi.
Analysis of spatial organization of the P450 gene clusters
in the P. chrysosporium genome revealed a variable pattern.
For instance, the two P450 clusters on scaffold-20 are
spread over a 220 kb genomic region separated by more
than 200 kb, whereas the gene clusters on other scaffolds
are more closely spaced. On scaffold-24, the clusters 5 and
6 are spread over a 62 kb of genomic region and are separated by less than 10 kb genomic region. Similarly, clusters 7 to 9 on scaffold-30 are spread over an 80 kb region
with a 27–28 kb gap between them. The two clusters on
scaffold-73 are separated by less than 10 kb DNA and are
spread over a 30 kb genomic region. This analysis constitutes the first report on P450 clustering and spatial organization in filamentous fungi. Nevertheless, in fungi, it has
been frequently observed that the genes coding for
enzymes involved in secondary metabolism, such as those
involved in the synthesis of ergot alkaloids [20], HC-toxin
[21], and mycotoxins such as sterigmatocystin and aflatoxins [22,23], are heterologous clusters (containing P450

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/92

and other metabolic genes). Clustering of secondary metabolic genes has been proposed to favor their survival and
dispersal, at least in part, via horizontal gene transfer
[23,24]. The close association seen in some of the P. chrysosporium gene clusters might point to their co-ordinated
regulation as observed in the case of the above secondary
metabolic gene clusters in different fungi. However, experimental evidence is needed to extrapolate this assumption
to the fungal P450 clusters. Our initial transcription-based
analysis demonstrated lack of such co-ordinated regulation among the tandem CYP63 genes of cluster-4 in P.
chrysosporium [14].
Alternative splicing and functional diversity
Alternative splicing is an important mechanism for regulation of gene expression, which expands the coding
capacity of a single gene to allow production of different
protein isoforms, often with diverse functions [25]. More
than 50% of human genes are alternatively spliced [26].
Reports in fungi on alternative splicing are few [12,27], in
comparison to humans where this mechanism has been
well documented. We have experimentally identified two
splice variants of the first characterized P450 gene pc-1
(CYP63A1) from P. chrysosporium [12] and predicted more
such variants based on the in silico analysis. Although
splice variants have not been identified so far in the other
two tandemly arranged members pc-2 and pc-3 of this
cluster, their similar gene organization (typically marked
by multiple introns and exons as small as 4 to 10 aa
length) suggests the existence of splice variants. Further,
while validating our custom 70-mer microarray analysis
data [15] on P450 gene transcription and induction using
RT-PCR (wherein gene specific primers were chosen from
different locations on the gene), we observed that the
transcript quantification for a given sample in some cases
varied with the location of the primer chosen (Unpublished data). This observed variation points to the existence of alternative splice variants. A recently proposed
system of nomenclature for such splice variants suggests
that the transcript name should include the exon involved
in the splicing event [7]. It is noteworthy that nearly onethird of the P. chrysosporium P450ome shows microexons,
which are likely candidates that promote alternative splicing events during transcription. Such alternative splicing
helps increase the diversity of the transcriptome, and is
likely to significantly contribute to the metabolic diversity
of this organism.
II. Evolutionary analysis of P. chrysosporium P450ome
Fungal P450 clans in P. chrysosporium
Finding meaningful associations and evolutionary relationships among members of the rapidly expanding
superfamily of the P450 proteins at the species level is
becoming a challenge using the existing family level classification. For instance, the CYP6 family that is exclusive

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:92

to insects forms a close cluster with the CYP3 and CYP5
families from mammals, CYP30 from clams, and CYP25
from C. elegans on the phylogenetic tree, indicating that
these five families probably have evolved from a common
ancestor with similar function before the deuterostomeprotostome split [8]. However, this is not reflected in the
family names, as the family classification is based on an
arbitrary 40% amino acid similarity criterion. To explain
such higher order groupings, the term "Clan" was recently
introduced [6]. Typically, a clan represents a cluster of
P450 families across species, grouped based on relationships that are beyond the family designations. There are 9
clans in vertebrates and 10 in plants.
A detailed phylogenetic analysis was carried out to understand the evolutionary relationship of P. chrysosporium
P450 gene families and their relatedness with other fungal
clans. In lower forms of fungi (yeasts), 4 P450 families
(CYP51, 52, 53 and 61) have been characterized, of which
CYP51 and 61 are conserved. In higher forms of fungi (filamentous fungi), 13 P450 families (CYP51, 53, 61, 65,
68, 505, 531, 532, 537, 539, 540, 548, and 552) are common as exemplified by the hitherto sequenced genomes
of four ascomycetous fungal species: Neurospora crassa ,
Magnoporthe grisea , Fusarium graminearum and Aspergillus
nidulans . Interestingly, based on homology analysis, the
P450 families CYP51, 53, 61, and 505 are also present in
P. chrysosporium (a basidiomycetous fungus) albeit with a
widely varying degree of similarity. Further, clan level
comparisons revealed that 12 P. chrysosporium P450 families (Figure 1) have resemblances in 11 fungal P450 clans
and show varying degrees of structural similarities to the
P450 genes from different ascomycetous fungi such as
Aspergillus and Fusarium , suggesting that P. chrysosporium
has acquired these P450 families as a part of vertical
descent from a common ancestor followed by further
diversification. It will be interesting to compare the hitherto uncharacterized zygomycetous P450ome to arrive at
the ancestral P450ome that led to the current P450 diversity among these three major fungal groups (ascomycetes,
zygomycetes and basidiomycetes).
CYP51 clan
One of the highly conserved and functionally well-characterized P450 gene families in fungi is the CYP51 family
that encodes the cell wall ergosterol biosynthesis reaction,
lanosterol 14-alpha demethylation in yeasts or eburicol
14-alpha demethylation in filamentous fungi, a target
step for antifungal azole compounds. The current state of
knowledge on P450 evolution in eukaryotes points to
CYP51 as the ancestral P450, which is believed to have led
to the evolution of all the present day P450 families [8].
In comparison to some of the ascomycetous fungi, which
carry multiple CYP51 genes, there is a single CYP51 gene
(located on scaffold-2) in P. chrysosproium that codes for a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/92

549 aa protein. The CYP51 minimal evolution tree, based
on the available CYP51s from 17 fungal species (Figure 5),
depicts that basidiomycete CYP51s (including P. chrysosporium CYP51) form the closest association with
CYP51s from the ascomycetous fungi as compared to
those from the zygomycetous fungus Cunninghamella elegans and the hemi-ascomycetous fungus (budding yeast).
Considering the fact that all known fungi except ascomycetes have a single CYP51 gene in their genome (Figure 5),
it appears that the ascomycetous fungi required diversification of their CYP51 gene. This intragenome diversification of CYP51 in ascomycetes, such as in the genomes of
A. nidulans , M. grisea , and F. graminearum , is reflected by
high bootstrap values separating their multiple CYP51s.
Likewise, analysis of the recently completed plant
genomes has shown that the rice genome contains ten
functional CYP51 genes and two pseudogenes [28], and
that Arabidopsis has two CYP51 genes, in contrast to the
popular belief that a single CYP51 gene exists in all phyla.
The presence of multiple CYP51s might indicate their
involvement beyond the sterol biosynthesis to take up
new function(s) for the organism's survival. Since the
ascomycete species that carry multiple CYP51s are parasitic in nature, multiple CYP51s/variants might have been
acquired to give these species an edge in host-pathogen
interaction or survival against antifungal treatment [29],
unlike in saprophytic fungi such as P. chrysosporium.
CYP 61 clan
CYP61 codes for sterol 22 desaturase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , which is involved in later stages of the ergosterol
pathway in metabolizing Ergosta-5,7,24(28)-trienol to
Ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraenol by introducing a C22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain [30]. Since
this gene acts late in the ergosterol pathway, it is considered to have evolved as a result of duplication and diversification of the CYP51 gene [8]. The P. chrysosporium
genome contains one CYP61 gene. However, unlike its
CYP51 (Figure 5), CYP61 of P. chrysosporium is phylogenetically as distant from euascomycetous CYP61s as it is
from the hemi-ascomycetous CYP51 (Figure 6). These
analyses also show diversification of CYP61 within the
ascomycetous group at least in 2 subclusters (with high
bootstrap values) that coincide with small genomes
(yeast-like) versus larger genomes (filamentous fungi).
CYP52 Clan
The CYP52 family of P450 proteins was originally identified in Candida species [31,32] with a role in carrying out
terminal hydroxylation of n-alkanes and ω-hydroxylation
of fatty acids. The varying substrate specificities of these
genes have given this yeast its ability to modify a range of
n-alkanes. Later, homologous genes have been identified
in other yeasts [33,34] and filamentous fungal species
(Figure 7). The earlier discussed CYP63 family of P.

chrysosporium, which consists of seven members, pc-1
through pc-7, shows close architectural resemblance to the
CYP52 family of yeasts and thus can be classified under
the same clan. However, as evident from the minimal evolution tree (Figure 7), the white rot CYP63 members form
a separate cluster on the tree from the CYP52 family members of the ascomycetous fungi and other CYP52-related
fungal P450 families. Furthermore, despite high structural
similarity among them, the individual member genes of
the CYP63 cluster are separated by high bootstrap values,
indicating significant divergence among them. This is corroborated by our experimental studies on substrate inducibility of the three tandemly linked CYP63 members pc-1,
pc-2, and pc-3; the expression of these linked P450s was
differentially induced (both in qualitative and quantitative terms) in response to linear alkanes and substituted

alkanes. Moreover, their substrate-specificity seems to
extend beyond alkanes/substituted alkanes as they also
showed induction in the presence of various aromatics,
including the polycyclic aromatic compounds such as
PAHs [14,15]. These and other experimentally generated
data on their differential physiological regulation [14]
coupled with the presented phylogenetic analysis point to
the evolution of the CYP63 family to acquire diverse functional roles while retaining its original alkane-degrading
ability. While the n-alkanes are hydroxylated for assimilation (as carbon source) by Candida species, the P450
hydroxylation of alkanes by P. chrysosporium (which does
not use them as sole carbon source) appears to be a cometabolic activity required for catalyzing aliphatic oxidations during the natural lignin degradation process. This is
further supported by the fact that there are structural

resemblances between the inducer compounds (alkanes
and aromatics) and the substructures present in its natural
substrate lignin.
CYP64 clan
The CYP64 family, first identified in Aspergillus spp., was
shown to include P450 proteins that catalyze various reactions involved in biosynthesis of aflatoxins and other such
secondary metabolites in these species [35]. Genomewide sequence similarity analysis and annotation of the P.
chrysosporium P450ome revealed that 54 P450 genes fall
under the CYP64 clan (Figure 8). The P. chrysosporium
CYP64 family members are interspersed on the tree (as
indicated by low bootstrap values on the critical branch
nodes linking P. chrysosporium with other fungi) constructed based on the CYP64 clan genes from other fungal
groups suggesting their multiple lineage or diversification.
White rot fungi such as P. chrysosporium , which have a typical secondary metabolic switch in their growth/ biodegradation cycle, may have the hitherto uncharacterized role
for its CYP64 clan proteins in secondary metabolism.
Functional evaluation of one or more members from this
group will bring into light the enzymatic or functional
diversity of such a large number of CYP64-like genes in
this fungus.
CYP505 clan
The fatty acid hydroxylase P450BM3 (CYP102) of the bacterium Bacillus megaterium , containing a P450 monooxygenase gene fused with a P450 reductase gene, was the first
identified fusion protein member of the P450 superfamily
[4]. Later, a similar fused P450 gene coding for fatty acid
hydroxylase was identified from the fungus Fusarium
oxysporum [18]. The latter, named P450foxy, shows 40.6%
and 35.3% amino acid similarity in its P450 and reductase
domains to the corresponding domains in the bacterial
P450 fusion protein P450BM3. The current hypothesis
suggests that such fused proteins are of eukaryotic origin
and their occurrence in the prokaryotic (bacterial) cells is
due to horizontal gene transfer [18].

Interestingly, there are 7-fused P450foxy-like genes in the
P. chrysosporium genome located on 3 different scaffolds.
These seven P450s form a separate cluster from the known
P450foxy proteins of other fungi (ascomycetes) on the
minimal evolution tree (Figure 9). There are two distinct
clusters among the ascomycetous fungi (Figure 9), which
appear to be lineages of two ancestral fused proteins based
on their phylogenetic distance; of these, one clusters more
closely with the P. chrysosporium fusion proteins. The
white rot fusion proteins form three sub-groups within
their phylogenetic branch separated by reasonably high
bootstrap values (89% separating subgroup 1 from subgroups 2 and 3, and 63% separating subgroup 2 from subgroup 3), indicating considerable divergence among these

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/92

proteins. Nevertheless, these fused proteins, while forming three sub-groups within their phylogenetic branch,
show high conservation of functional domain sequences
and intron/exon organization, suggesting the involvement of gene duplication and translocation events in their
formation. There are multiple lines of evidence to support
this argument. First, as discussed earlier, five out of the
seven fused proteins are placed within a distance of 43 kb
region on scaffold 73. Second, the conserved intron positioning in all agrees perfectly with their common grouping on the tree (Figure 9). Third, multiple regions of high
sequence similarity in the flanking regions around these
genes have been identified using the BLAST program. For
instance, when the 43 kb region of the scaffold 73 was
blasted against itself, a near perfect inverse duplication
region of 2 kb was identified; the region from base
number 32876 to 34876 is identical to the regions spanning base numbers 27 to 801 and 2134 to 3348 on scaffold 73. This explains the awkward position of the
pc.73.11.1 gene between the closely related genes
ug.73.15.1 and pc.73.14.1 on this scaffold and indicates a
duplicative inversion event (Figure 10). Similarly, there is
high sequence similarity (E-value = 0) between the 1000
bp non-coding flanking region downstream of the
gx.187.5.1 gene, spanning base numbers 24674 to 25673
on scaffold 187, and the 983 bp non-coding region
upstream of gene pc.73.1.1 spanning base numbers
36423 to 37405 on scaffold 73. This points to an ectopic
insertion of the gx.187.5.1 on scaffold 187 after duplication on scaffold 73. This finding of an extraordinary level
of sequence identity for non-coding DNA regions provides further evidence to the proposed involvement of
gene duplication and translocation events.
Many questions regarding the origin and distribution of
these fused P450 proteins in fungi remain unanswered.
One can conclude from the phylogenetic tree (Figure 9)
that more than one original fusion event happened in the
ancestral fungus either before the ascomycetous-basidiomycetous split approximately 400 million years ago [36],
or a second fusion event happened in ascomycetous fungi
immediately after these two groups split. Either way, during the course of evolution, these proteins have diversified
further, possibly due to more gene fusions or due to gene
duplications (Figure 10). Assuming that the ancestral fungus carried two fusion proteins, the question as to what
happened to the other gene lineage in basidiomycetous
fungi arises; has it been lost immediately after these two
groups split without further diversification or was it never
there and the second lineage in the ascomycetous fungi
originated after these groups had separated? However,
there is one complication to this argument; if P450foxy
proteins predate the ascomycetous-basidiomycetous split,
then why are these proteins missing entirely in archiascomycotina and hemiascomycotina (fission and budding

yeasts)? This is an open question and may be answered by
analyzing the genomes of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas (VAM) or chitrids, which predate these two groups'
split [36]. The third possible reason for occurrence of
these fused proteins in P. chrysosporium could be horizontal gene transfer from one or more of the ascomycetous
fungi. When the P. chrysosporium P450foxy proteins were
compared to the recently completed whole genome shotgun sequences of other basidiomycetes Coprinus cinereus ,
Cryptococcus neoformans , and Ustilago maydis , no P450

fused protein homologues were found indicating the
unique presence of these proteins in P. chrysosporium, a
member of the wood-rooting group of basidiomycetes.
However, as more fungal genomes become available,
especially from the basidiomycetous group, it will be clear
if these fusion proteins are actually unique in P. chrysosporium (or wood-rotting basidiomycetes subgroup) among
basidiomycetous fungi. Nevertheless, it appears that fused
proteins are predominantly present across ascomycetous
fungi, and their presumed exceptional occurrence in the

Page 16 of 24
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:92

basidiomycete P. chrysosporium could possibly be a result
of a horizontal gene transfer, an event otherwise rare in
fungal genome evolution [37,23,24]. Looking at the gene
organization and flanking sequence homology of these
P450 genes in P. chrysosporium in Figures 9 and 10, and
their distribution on the genome, it appears that six of the
seven genes have branched out from a single progenitor
gene, while the origin of the seventh gene pc.17.40.1
remains unclear and could possibly be a result of independent transfer. Role of intragenomic duplication event
in the origin of pc.17.40.1 is ruled out based on the fact
that there is no flanking sequence similarity between this
and the other six genes. Furthermore, P. chrysosporium has
the largest contingent (7 member genes) of P450foxy proteins (CYP505) among the fungi (3–5 member genes)
containing this family of proteins. These observations collectively point to a rapid evolution of this P450 fusion
proteins family (CYP505) in P. chrysosporium, possibly to
meet the metabolic demand for fatty acid hydroxylation
in the ecological niches of this fungus.
Clan-level relationships of other P. chrysosporium P450 families
The P. chrysosporium genome contains one member of the
benzoate 4-hydroxylase family (CYP53) and nine
members homologous to CYP58, both clustering under a
common family on the P. chrysosporium tree (Figure 1) and
groupable into the CYP53 clan http://drnel
son.utmem.edu/53clan2.pdf. Presence of a single CYP53
protein in P. chrysosporium contrasts with the multiple
CYP53 proteins detected in ascomycetous fungi. A total of
170 sequences (including CYP53 and CYP58) that are
groupable into 4 sub-classes (A, B, C and D) have been
assigned to the CYP53 clan in different ascomycetous
fungi http://drnelson.utmem.edu/53clan2.pdf. The P.
chrysosporium CYP53 protein is groupable under the B subclass. The CYP58 family proteins have been shown to be
involved in the synthesis of a group of secondary metabolites (trichothecene mycotoxins) in Fusarium spp. [38].
These proteins are grouped under the CYP53 clan subclass C. However, the P. chrysosporium CYP58 homologues
form a cluster separate from other fungal CYP58 proteins
on the minimal evolution tree (Figure 11). Hence, we cannot rule out the possibility that these CYP58 structural
homologues have evolved as functional variants, acquiring both CYP53 and CYP58 activities.

Phylogenetic analysis based on the fungal CYP503 clan
revealed that 12 of the P. chrysosporium P450 genes show
close relatedness to the CYP512A1 gene from another
lignin-degrading basidiomycete, Coriolus versicolor , but
are distant from the CYP54 family and other CYP503 clan
proteins from ascomycetous fungi, as shown by a high
bootstrap value of 96% (Figure 12). The CYP503 family of
P450 proteins originally found in Gibberella fujikuroi
encode for multifunctional ent -kaurene oxidases that cat-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/92

alyze oxidation steps in the gibberellin biosynthesis of the
plant growth hormone gibberellin, a secondary metabolite in this fungus. This is suggestive of a possible role of
P. chrysosporium CYP503 clan genes in secondary
metabolism.
Sixteen P. chrysosporium P450 genes relate to the CYP67
clan (Figure 13). The CYP67 family was originally constituted of plant-induced rust genes identified in the basidiomycetous fungus Uromyces fabae [39]. The diterpene
aphidicolin synthesizing gene PbP450-1 from Phoma
betae and the genes involved in sterigmatocystin biosynthesis in Emericella nidulans are also groupable in the same
clan in addition to some P450s encoding secondary metabolic reactions in other ascomycetous fungi (Figure 13).
This suggests that the sixteen P. chrysosporium homologues
might as well be involved in similar reaction steps in the
synthesis of its secondary metabolites.
Two P. chrysosporium P450 families, CYP617 and
CYP5031, are groupable under the CYP547 clan. While
the CYP547 clan proteins occur in all the higher ascomycetous fungi studied so far, two such proteins (CYP5031A1
and CYP5032A1) have also been identified recently in the
basidiomycetous fungus U. maydis , of which CYP5031A1
shows closest relatedness (35% bootstrap value) to the
two P. chrysosporium P450 proteins (Figure 14). On the
other hand, the six other P. chrysosporium P450 proteins
(pc.14.209.1, pc.16.161.1, PFF 311a, pc.142.11.1,
pc.16.153.1 and pc.5.122.1), while showing highest
BLAST homology to the CYP617 family of proteins, form
a distinct group on the phylogenetic tree with a bootstrap
value of 79% (Figure 14). It is possible that these six genes
represent a unique family of P450 proteins, hitherto unidentified in other fungi. The same is true in the case of
seven genes from the CYP614/534 clan and one gene
(pc.96.21.1) from the CYP62 family of P. chrysosporium ,
which form independent clusters on the phylogenetic tree
(Figures not shown).
Based on the clan-level comparison, it is evident that,
although the P. chrysosporium P450ome has member
counterparts among different fungal groups, in most
cases, their independent clustering suggests significant
sequence diversification and likely unique functionality.
Such diversification emphasizes the need for assigning
new family names to the P. chrysosporium P450s.

Conclusion
The recognized extraordinary catalytic diversity of the
white rot fungus P. chrysosporium correlates with its enormous P450 repertoire (P450ome), which is one of the
largest among lower eukaryotes. Our structural and phylogenetic analyses of the P450ome, meant to understand
the genesis of such a large number of P450 genes and

facilitate their classification/nomenclature, have provided
important clues to the evolution of the enormous catalytic
diversity in this fungus. Considering the fact that certain
P450 families (such as CYP64) have diversified more
extensively than others, it appears that the P. chrysosporium
P450ome has evolved in specific directions to meet the
metabolic demand in its environmental niches. While the

ancestral genes like CYP51 and CYP61 have remained
unchanged, possibly due to their minimal role in P. chrysosporium (and other saprophytic fungi) versus that in their
parasitic cousins such as pathogenic Aspergilli, other P450
gene families with suggestive roles in secondary metabolism (such as CYP64) have evolved as multigene families
and even exist as gene clusters in this fungus. Such family-

P450 families, CYP547, CYP617, and CYP5031, were compared with homologous P450 sequences from other fungal species
and were found to qualify as members of the CYP547 clan. Abbreviations: An-Aspergillus nidulans ; Eg-Eremothecium gossypii ; FgFusarium graminearum ; Mg-Magnaporthe grisea ; Nc-Neurospora crassa ; Pc-Phanerochaete chrysosporium; Um-Ustilago maydis.

specific evolution was warranted presumably due to an
extensive demand for generation of a broad range of
metabolites in the secondary metabolic switch required

for degradation of complex natural substrates such as
lignin. The presented analysis indicates that the
progenitor P450 families, originally acquired as a part of

vertically descending P450ome, have diversified rapidly
via multiple genetic mechanisms such as tandem duplications, translocations, mutations, and possibly gene
fusions, to give rise to majority of the multigene families
in the P. chrysosporium P450ome. Consequently, this structural diversification within individual multigene P450
families, as experimentally demonstrated in the case of
CYP63 family in our studies, seems to have led to the
acquisition of novel functions hitherto unseen in their
ancestral counterparts (CYP52 genes of yeasts in this
case). In addition, our experimental evidence for the presence of alternatively spliced variants in the P. chrysosporium P450 transcriptome further explains the evolution of
expanded substrate diversity in this organism. The P.
chrysosporium P450ome forms a model to investigate
extrapolation of the evolved P450 gene diversity to the
known vast biodegradation potential and will help design
the future functional studies to understand the individual
P450 gene functions in order to dissect the P450 functional diversity in white rot fungi.

Methods
Fungal cultures and cDNA cloning
Phanerochaete chrysosporium strain BKM-F-1767 (ATCC
24725) was grown as shaken cultures for 4 days in defined
low nitrogen (LN) medium (2.4 mM N, 1% glucose) as
described previously [14]. Total RNA (500 ng) was isolated from frozen fungal mycelia using the TRI Reagent kit
(Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA) and a
cDNA pool was generated using the SMART™ PCR cDNA
synthesis kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, first-strand cDNA synthesis step was carried out in a 10 µl reaction volume using
200 units of MMLV reverse transcriptase and 1 µM each of
the SMART III Oligonucleotide and the CDS III/3' PCR
Primer, at 42°C for 1 hour. One-fifth of the first-strand
reaction (2 µl) was then added to a 100 µl long distance
(LD)-PCR reaction with 1 µM each of the 5' PCR Primer
and the CDS III/3' PCR Primer, for the synthesis of a double-stranded (ds) cDNA pool. Amplification parameters
included initial denaturation at 95°C for 1 min., followed
by a two step-PCR protocol involving use of 95°C for 1
min. and 68°C for 6 min., for 24 cycles. Quality of the ds
cDNA amplified was analyzed on a 1.1% Agarose/EtBr gel
and the product was quantified using spectrophotometer.
Gene-specific cDNA isolation involved use of 100 ng of
this cDNA mix as the template, in conjunction with an
appropriate pair of gene-specific primers listed in Table 3.
The gene-specific cDNA synthesis reaction contained 100
ng each of the forward and the reverse primer in a 50 µl
PCR reaction volume and the amplification included 37
cycles, each involving denaturation at 95°C for 30 sec,
annealing at 60°C for 30 sec, and extension at 72°C for 1
min.

The cDNA amplicons generated were cloned using 2.1TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) per the
manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant plasmid
DNA for amplicon sequencing was isolated and purified
using QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)
per the manufacturer's specifications. The DNA sequencing was performed at the university's DNA core facility.
The cloned cDNA sequences generated in this study have
been submitted to the GenBank under the accession
numbers-AY835607 (pc-2), AY321373 (pc-4), AY321374
(pc-5), AY835606 (pc-6) and AY835608 (pc-foxy1).
Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis
The P. chrysosporium P450 sequences used in the phylogenetic analysis were retrieved from the website http://
genome.jgi-psf.org/whiterot1/whiterot1.home.html
of
the Joint Genome Institute of US Department of Energy(US-DOE) and from the P450 website http://drnel
son.utmem.edu/whiterot.html. The deduced amino acid
sequence for a given P450 was compared from the above
two sources and a sequence with the longest aa stretch was
selected. However, the gene number assigned in the
published white rot genome was retained for uniformity
and convenience. For the cloned cDNAs, Gene Runner
program (version 3.05, Hastings Software, Inc. Hastings,
NY, USA) was used to extract and analyze the corresponding gene sequences from the genome, design the primers
for RT-PCR amplification, and deduce the amino acid
sequences. P450 sequences for other fungi were obtained
from the NCBI GenBank database and the P450 website.
Sequences were aligned using the CLUSTALW program at
the EMBL-EBI website http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/.
Alignment of the 126 sequences of the P. chrysosporium
P450ome was generated using the following customized
parameters that varied from the default parametersMatrix-BLOSUM (Henikoff), and Gap Open Penalty -1.
All the other multiple alignments were generated using
the default alignment parameters including the MatrixGONNET 250 and Gap Open Penalty -10. Phylogenetic
trees were constructed using the MEGA 2.1 software http:/
/www.megasoftware.net [40]. The minimal evolution
trees (Figures 5 to 10 and 11 to 14) were generated by heuristic search using the Close-Neighbor-Interchange (CNI)
algorithm, with the Neighbor-Joining tree serving as the
temporary tree. The topological distance (dT) was set at 2
for searching the minimal evolution tree. The P. chrysosporium P450ome (Figure 1) was constructed using the
Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmatic Mean
(UPGMA) method with gamma distance model. The
alignment gaps and missing data sites were deleted and a
bootstrap value based on 1000 replications was set for all
the phylogenetic trees generated in this study. Protein
sequences used for constructing the phylogenetic trees
were obtained either from the GenBank (those shown
with accession numbers) or from the P450 web site http:/
