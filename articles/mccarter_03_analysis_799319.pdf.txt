Background
Root-knot nematode species, including Meloidogyne incognita, are the most important of the plant parasitic nematodes,

infecting almost all cultivated plants, and are responsible for
billions of dollars in crop losses annually [1,2]. They are
obligatory sedentary endoparasites with a 1- to 2-month life

information

Conclusions: With sequencing from plant parasitic nematodes accelerating, the approaches to
transcript characterization described here can be applied to more extensive datasets and also
provide a foundation for more complex genome analyses.

interactions

Results: From these, 1,625 EST clusters were formed and classified by function using the Gene
Ontology (GO) hierarchy and the Kyoto KEGG database. L2 larvae, which represent the infective
stage of the life cycle before plant invasion, express a diverse array of ligand-binding proteins and
abundant cytoskeletal proteins. L2 are structurally similar to Caenorhabditis elegans dauer larva
and the presence of transcripts encoding glyoxylate pathway enzymes in the M. incognita clusters
suggests that root-knot nematode larvae metabolize lipid stores while in search of a host.
Homology to other species was observed in 79% of translated cluster sequences, with the
C. elegans genome providing more information than any other source. In addition to identifying
putative nematode-specific and Tylenchida-specific genes, sequencing revealed previously
uncharacterized horizontal gene transfer candidates in Meloidogyne with high identity to
rhizobacterial genes including homologs of nodL acetyltransferase and novel cellulases.

refereed research

Background: Plant parasitic nematodes are major pathogens of most crops. Molecular
characterization of these species as well as the development of new techniques for control can
benefit from genomic approaches. As an entrée to characterizing plant parasitic nematode
genomes, we analyzed 5,700 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from second-stage larvae (L2) of the
root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita.

cycle. Embryos develop in a proteinaceous matrix extruded
by the adult female, and hatch as second-stage larvae (L2)
that move through the soil and invade the plant root. Within
the root, the worm establishes a feeding site and undergoes
three additional molts to become an adult. M. incognita is a
mitotic parthenogenetic species. Males develop but appear
to play no role in reproduction [3]. Females swell to a pear
shape and are incapable of moving once committing to a root
feeding site.
The Meloidogyne L2 larvae, the infective stage where the
worm is away from the host plant (also referred to as
second-stage juvenile in the literature), is more accessible
than the rest of the life cycle, and is an interesting stage biologically with the worm completing multiple steps required
for survival. On hatching from the eggshell, L2 worms are
able to locate and migrate towards a potential host plant,
penetrate the root behind its tip in the zone of elongation,
and migrate intercellularly through the vascular cylinder by
separating cells at the middle lamella [4]. The migration is
enabled by a combination of stylet protrusion (mechanical
force) and secretion of cell-wall-degrading enzymes from
specialized glands [5-8]. Upon completion of migration,
secretions from the nematode’s glands, and potentially other
cues, induce root cells to alter their development and gene
expression, undergoing abnormal growth and repeated
endomitotic rounds of replication to form a feeding site
made up of giant cells [9,10]. The L2 feeds from the giant
cells for 10-12 days, then ceases feeding and molts three
times over the next two days to form the adult. L2 undergo
significant change following establishment of the feeding
site, including swelling of the body and a switch in gland
activity from subventral to dorsal dominance [11].
Until recent years, molecular characterization of Meloidogyne genes has been limited [12,13], particularly because the
species’ obligate parasitic life cycle makes studies difficult.
Both basic understanding of root-knot nematode biology and
applied research toward new means of nematode control are
now beginning to benefit from the rapid identification of
transcribed genes in the species. The generation of expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) by single-pass random sequencing of
cDNA libraries is a powerful tool for rapid gene transcript
identification in metazoans [14-17] including parasitic nematodes of humans and animals [18-23]. High-throughput projects on two dozen nematode species have now brought the
total number of publicly available roundworm ESTs to nearly
400,000, with half the sequences coming from parasites
[24-27]. As a part of these efforts, EST sequencing from plant
parasitic nematodes is in progress [28] and pilot EST
datasets from the root-knot nematode M. incognita and the
cyst nematodes Globodera rostochiensis and G. pallida
second-stage larvae have recently been analyzed [29,30].
Important to the characterization and understanding of
these sequences is the creation and implementation of

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/4/R26

bioinformatics approaches (such as clustering, functional
classification, similarity analysis) that can be applied uniformly across the ever-increasing multiple nematode
datasets. We present here an analysis of 5,713 ESTs from
M. incognita L2 including creation of NemaGene clusters to
reduce sequence redundancy, identification of abundant
transcripts, and functional classification of gene products
based on assignments to InterPro domains, the Gene Ontology hierarchy, and KEGG biochemical pathways. Building on
the availability of the complete genome sequence, gene
homologs of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans [31] were identified for M. incognita clusters and
correlated with known RNA interference (RNAi) phenotypes. Genes specific to plant parasitic nematodes
(Tylenchida species) as well as prokaryotic-like horizontal
gene transfer candidates were also examined.

Results and discussion
As part of a larger effort to examine expressed gene
sequences from parasitic nematodes, we have generated and
submitted to GenBank’s EST database 5,713 ESTs from a
M. incognita L2 library. Sequences, which include both 5؅
and 3؅ reads, averaged 481 nucleotides, resulting in 2.82
million submitted nucleotides. Here we present a first analysis applying semi-automated bioinformatics tools to genome
data from a plant parasitic nematode, thereby laying the
groundwork for more extensive analyses.

NemaGene cluster analysis
To reduce data redundancy, improve base accuracy and
transcript length, and determine gene representation within
the library, ESTs from the M. incognita L2 library were
grouped by sequence identity into contigs and clusters by a
method using Phrap and BLAST. ‘Contig’ member ESTs
appear to derive from identical transcripts while ‘cluster’
members may derive from the same gene yet represent different transcript splice isoforms (that is, ESTs form contigs,
contigs form clusters). Beginning with 5,713 traces, automated screens and manual inspection of misassembled
contigs resulted in the elimination of 52 ESTs as potential
chimeric sequences. The remaining 5,661 ESTs formed 1,798
contigs and 1,625 clusters. Clusters varied in size from a
single EST (723 cases) to 77 ESTs (1 case) (Figure 1). By
eliminating data redundancy during contig building, the
total number of nucleotides used for further analysis was
reduced from 2.82 million to 1.99 million. To a first approximation, this project generated sequence from as many as
1,625 genes, for a new gene discovery rate of 29%, with only
13% of ESTs being singletons. This number may, however,
overestimate gene discovery as a single gene could be represented by multiple non-overlapping clusters. While library
redundancy reduces the number of new genes discovered,
65% of clusters still have 10 or fewer EST members. Such
redundancy is desirable to increase base accuracy and transcript length within contigs. Additionally, 122 clusters have

To categorize transcripts by putative function, we have utilized the Gene Ontology (GO) classification scheme [35,36].
GO provides a dynamic controlled vocabulary and hierarchy
that unifies descriptions of biological, cellular and molecular
functions across genomes. InterProScan was used to match
Meloidogyne clusters to characterized protein domains
(5,875 entries) in the InterPro database [37]. Existing mappings of InterPro domains allowed placement of Meloidogyne clusters into the GO hierarchy, viewed locally with the

The 25 most abundant EST clusters accounted for 18% of all
ESTs generated. A high level of representation in a cDNA
library generally correlates with high transcript abundance
in the original biological sample [33], although artifacts of
library construction can result in selection for or against representation of some transcripts. Transcripts abundantly represented in the library include genes encoding cytoskeleton
proteins (such as myosin, actin, UNC-87, troponin T) and

homology to the putative fatty-acid-binding protein Sec-2,
confirming the abundant expression of this gene reported in
L2 cDNA libraries from M. incognita [29] and the cyst

multiple contig members, revealing potential splice isoforms. Contig building was successful in significantly
increasing the length of assembled transcript sequences from
481 ± 108 nucleotides for submitted ESTs alone to 611 ± 174
nucleotides for multi-member contigs. The longest sequence
also increased from 780 to 2,353 nucleotides. Sampling of
another 5,661 ESTs from the same source is estimated to
result in the discovery of only 329 new clusters, a new gene
discovery rate of only 6% (ESTFreq, W. Gish, personal communication). Further sampling will therefore await library
normalization. This same clustering methodology is being
applied to ESTs from other nematode species [32].

AmiGO browser. Of 1,625 clusters, 1,280 (79%) have
homologies beyond M. incognita, 693 (43%) align to InterPro
domains, and 475 (29%) map to the GO hierarchy. These 475
clusters represent generally conserved genes containing
domains with characterized biochemical and physiological
function in other species. The actual mappings are more
complicated than one-to-one: the 693 clusters with InterPro
alignments match to 379 InterPro domains, and the 475
clusters with GO assignments have 764 mappings to 127
GO categories.
Gene Ontology representation of M. incognita clusters is
shown for each organizing principle of GO: biological process
(Table 2a, Figure 2a), cellular component (Table 2b,
Figure 2b), and molecular function (Table 2c, Figure 2c).
Table 2 and Figure 2 provide a breakdown of representation
by major GO categories. A complete listing of GO mappings is
available as additional data with the online version of this

article. While hatched L2 before plant invasion are a longlived non-feeding dispersal stage [4], GO categories reveal
numerous transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes, including
those involved in biosynthetic pathways. Distributions of
clusters by GO categories can be compared to findings from
other species using the TIGR gene index [38,39] which
includes information for three nematodes - the free-living
C. elegans and the human filarial parasites Brugia malayi
and Onchocerca volvulus. Table 3 compares observed GO
representation among nematode species. The most striking
initial differences in M. incognita GO representation from
the other three species were for molecular function, where
52% of Meloidogyne clusters had ligand-binding/carrier
mappings versus 24-28% for the other species, and cellular
component, where 15% of M. incognita clusters had extracellular mappings versus 0-2% for the other species.
Meloidogyne extracellular mappings (15 clusters) were all

riboflavin (vitamin B2) metabolism. C. briggsae is incapable
of synthesizing riboflavin [45] but C. elegans does appear to

M. incognita may have at least one enzyme involved in
riboflavin processing (see below).

contributed to the abundance of ligand-binding/carrier
mappings for Meloidogyne included EF-hand calcium
binding (22 clusters), RNA recognition motif (18 clusters),
and a variety of ATP-binding domains (20 clusters). Differences in the distribution of GO mappings may be attributable to the more extensive stage representation available for
the other species. Comparisons of relative expression levels
for genes among different M. incognita stages will begin to
be possible as EST collections from other life-cycle stages are
generated and analyzed.

glyoxylate pathway, generally found in plants and microorganisms, is similar to the citrate cycle, but relies on two
critical enzymes, malate synthase and isocitrate lyase, to
bypass two decarboxylation steps. Nematodes appear to use
this pathway for energy production from stored lipids during
starvation or non-feeding stages [47,48] such as Meloidogyne
pre-infective L2. Eight M. incognita L2 clusters map to five
glyoxylate pathway enzymes. These include homologs of
malate synthase (MI00879.cl, EC 4.1.3.2, BLASTX probability
of 2e-31), several enzymes not shared with the citrate cycle
(for example, formate tetrahydrofolate ligase, EC 6.3.4.3, 5e38), as well as two shared with the citrate cycle (for example,
malate dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.37, 4e-29). Isocitrate lyase (EC
4.1.3.1) was not observed in this EST collection, but the first
putative Tylenchida homologs of this gene have subsequently
appeared from our further EST sequencing (M. hapla
BM883225, and M. javanica BI324412). In C. elegans, two
genes each encode unusual bifunctional enzymes containing
both isocitrate lyase and malate synthase domains [49].
Since the isocitrate lyase domain lies within the amino-terminal half of the C. elegans bifunctional enzyme and none of
the Meloidogyne EST reads stretches across both domains,
further sequencing of the 3؅ end of cDNA clones from the M.
hapla or M. javanica isocitrate lyase ESTs will be necessary
to determine whether the Meloidogyne genus contains a
bifunctional glyoxylate enzyme homolog similar to that of
C. elegans. The presence of glyoxylate pathway enzymes in
Meloidogyne L2 provides experimental support for the
model describing this larval stage as the functional equivalent of the C. elegans dauer larva [41]. These ESTs and their
corresponding cDNA clones will be useful reagents for the
further study of the glyoxylate pathway in different stages of
the Meloidogyne life cycle. For instance, energy metabolism

would be expected to change markedly upon plant invasion
and intracellular migration toward the feeding site, and
might include a decrease in expression of transcripts specific
to the glyoxylate pathway.

Distribution of BLAST database matches and
homologs in C. elegans
Figure 3 is a Venn diagram combining the results of BLAST
searches versus three databases for the 79% (1,280/1,625) of
M. incognita clusters which had matches to sequences from
other species. Strikingly, in the majority of cases where
homologies were found (740/1,280), matches were found in
all three of the databases surveyed - C. elegans proteins,
other nematode sequences, and non-nematode sequences.
Gene products in this category are generally widely conserved across metazoans and many are involved in core biological processes. This category should continue to expand
as additional complete genomes become available [50,51].
The 20% of contigs (353) that had no homology may contain
novel or diverged amino-acid coding sequences that are specific to Meloidogyne species or even to M. incognita only.
Alternatively, clusters which containing mostly 3؅ or 5؅
untranslated regions (UTRs) would lack BLASTX homology
because they are non-coding or contain too short a coding
sequence to result in significant homology. To examine this
latter possibility contig consensus sequences with and
without BLASTX homology were examined to determine
their longest open reading frame (ORF). The distribution of
ORF sizes indicates that clusters without homology contain
two populations; one population of novel protein-coding
sequences with a similar distribution of ORF sizes to that
found in sequences with homology, and a second population

of UTR sequences containing random or generally short
ORFs (Figure 4). The combined distribution is bimodal (relatively high left shoulder) with a mean ORF size of 140 amino
acids versus a mean ORF size of 172 amino acids for
sequences with homology. A further characterization of novel
M. incognita genes could begin by examining those with
longer ORFs as these are most likely to be real coding regions.
In contrast to these findings for M. incognita where most
clusters had homology, BLAST searches with EST clusters
from the filarial nematode B. malayi showed far fewer database matches with the same e-value cut-off of 10-5 [52] - 57%
versus 79%. Part of this difference is due to the use of more
extensive databases in the M. incognita search. For instance,
the Meloidogyne search included all dbEST sequences in the
‘other nematode’ set, resulting in matches for 61% of all clusters, whereas the Brugia search used only protein sequences
in GenBank and saw matches in only around 12% of cases.
However, even matches in C. elegans were fewer for B. malayi
(50% versus 67%), where nearly identical databases were
used. Brugia, Meloidogyne and Caenorhabditis represent
three separate major nematode clades (III, IV and V, respectively) [53]. Possible explanations for the discrepancy in
matches are that the Brugia clusters contain a large fraction
of non-coding sequences (that is, 5؅ and 3؅ UTR, unspliced
introns) or have undergone more rapid molecular evolution
and diversification. Alternatively, since the Brugia ESTs
derive from 12 different libraries they may represent rarer
transcripts than are contained in the M. incognita collection.
A correlation between stage of expression and molecular
conservation has been observed in C. elegans [54].
As expected, the C. elegans genome [31] was the best source
of information for interpreting M. incognita sequences with

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/4/R26

85% of all clusters with matches showing homology to a
C. elegans gene product (Figure 3). Table 5 presents the 15
gene products with the highest level of conservation (e-240
to e-115) between M. incognita and C. elegans; these include
gene products involved in cell structure (for example, actin,
myosin), protein biosynthesis (for example, ribosomal proteins) and glycolysis (for example, lactate dehydrogenase,
enolase). Representation of these clusters in the M. incognita L2 EST collection varied from common (77 ESTs) to
rare (1 EST). None of these most conserved gene products
was nematode specific. Out of all clusters 281 (17%) had
homology only to nematodes, either C. elegans (80), other
nematodes (53), or both (148). The most conserved of these
nematode-specific proteins had a probability value of e-77.
Included among the most conserved nematode-specific proteins were previously characterized nematode-specific
domains including the transthyretin-like domain IPR001534
[55] (MI00092.cl), as well as uncharacterized C. elegans
hypothetical proteins (for example, MI01590.cl = TrEMBL
Q19251; MI00719.cl = TrEMBL P90889).
Thirteen M. incognita clusters lacked homology to any
C. elegans protein in Wormpep (v.54) yet had significant
homology to regions of the C. elegans genome by TBLASTX.
Such matches might reveal unpredicted protein-coding
regions within the genome. Most of the clusters, including
MI00112.cl, MI0000518.cl, MI01572.cl (matching to
C. elegans LG V:10343341..10344858), MI01502.cl (LG
X:16624802..16624921), MI00768.cl (LG III:2421909..2421700)
matched regions of the genome where genes were predicted
in later versions of Wormpep (WP 88, WP 73 and WP 65,
respectively) indicating the usefulness of ESTs from other
nematodes in predicting C. elegans coding regions. In fact,
ESTs from our parasitic nematode sequencing project are
being continually mapped to the C. elegans genome [56]
and used by Wormpep curators for this purpose. We are
further investigating other regions of homology such as
MI00899.cl (LG II:7443833..7443537) to determine
whether modifications to current C. elegans gene-structure
predictions are necessary.
Nematodes process many mRNAs by trans-splicing to SL1
and other splice leader sequences [57,58] and in C. elegans
use of different splice leaders is tied to genome organization
in operons [59]. SL1 is the predominant nematode splice
leader and is highly conserved across many species. Use of
SL1 by transcripts is estimated at 70% in C. elegans [60],
more than 80% in Ascaris lumbricoides [61], and approximately 60% in G. rostochiensis (Ling Qin, personal communication). SL1 has previously been observed in M. incognita
[12], although genes with non trans-spliced 5؅ ends have
also been cloned [5,6]. Only 33 of our M. incognita contigs
have an SL1 sequence at their 5؅ end. This limited detection
of SL1 is not surprising as both the poor processivity of
reverse transcriptase and the positioning of the vector
sequence primer near the beginning of the insert result in

information

The technique of RNAi, whereby the introduction of a
sequence-specific double-stranded RNA leads to degradation of matching mRNAs [62], has allowed the systematic
surveying of thousands of C. elegans genes for phenotypes
following transient gene knockout [63-65]. Such information
is potentially transferable to understanding which genes

Comparison to C. elegans genes with known RNAi
phenotypes

have crucial roles in parasitic nematodes where highthroughput RNAi is not yet possible. A list of 7,212
C. elegans RNAi experiments surveying 4,786 genes was
compared to the list of all M. incognita clusters with significant homology to C. elegans proteins. Using the criterion
that the C. elegans gene was the best match available for one
of the Meloidogyne clusters and RNAi experimental information was available, 539 genes were revealed. A specific
phenotype by RNAi was apparent for 221 (41%) of these
genes, whereas 318 (59%) remained wild type (see Additional data files for the complete list of C. elegans RNAi phenotypes for genes with M. incognita homologs). By
comparison, RNAi surveys of all predicted genes on a
C. elegans chromosome have found a smaller percentage of
genes with phenotypes: 14% for chromosome I [63] and 13%
for chromosome III [64]. Surveys of expressed genes reveal
an intermediate level of 27% with phenotypes [65]. Further,
selecting for C. elegans genes with expressed Meloidogyne
homologs led to enrichment for genes with severe phenotypes by RNAi such as embryonic lethality or sterility as

among EST collections. As an alternative method of determining which M. incognita genes may have an SL1 splice leader,
contigs were compared by BLASTN to our recently sequenced
ESTs from a M. arenaria egg library produced by PCR with an
SL1 primer sequence. Of the M. incognita contigs 188 had
high-level nucleotide identity (better than 1e-30) to this collection of SL1-containing Meloidogyne genes. With ESTs now
available in our collection from four Meloidogyne and numerous other SL1-PCR cDNA libraries [32], it should be possible
to address whether or not SL1-splicing of individual genes is
conserved across nematode species.

tally of all observed phenotypes see Additional data files). A
correlation between sequence conservation and severe phenotype by RNAi had previously been shown by comparison
of C. elegans to genomes from the distant phyla Saccharomyces, Drosophila and human [63,64]. Here we show a
similar trend following detection of homology to expressed
genes in other nematode species. Applying RNAi techniques
directly to parasitic nematodes is challenging owing to the
organisms’ generally longer and more complex life cycles,
including the requirement for passage through a host organism. Progress has been made recently in assaying RNAi
effects in both plant [66] and animal [67] parasitic nematodes. Further success may allow for a more high-throughput examination of phenotypes resulting from transient gene
knockout in parasites.

Tylenchida-specific genes and horizontal gene transfer
candidates
Fifty-three M. incognita clusters showed homology to
sequences from other nematode species yet lacked either
C. elegans or non-nematode homologs. Twenty of these clusters showed conservation only to gene products from other
Tylenchida species. MI00244.cl, for example, had homology
to 47 ESTs in our collection from other Tylenchida species
including root-knot nematodes M. javanica, M. hapla and
M. arenaria, cyst nematodes H. glycines and G. rostochiensis, and the lesion nematode Pratylenchus penetrans with
E-values from 7e-78 to 3e-05. The best homology to any
C. elegans protein was an extremely weak match (E-value =
0.017) to hypothetical protein M01H9.3b. Genes in this collection may be rapidly evolving so that homologs are only

detected in closely related species. Alternatively, genes may
be special adaptations to plant parasitism. No annotation is
available for any of these genes, but alignments with
sequences from related species can define domains for
further characterization.
In 1998, it was discovered that plant parasitic nematodes
possess genes encoding beta-1,4-endoglucanase enzymes
(cellulases) and that by far the strongest non-Tylenchida
homologs for these enzymes were prokaryotic cellulases
from Pseudomonas, Clostridium and other microbes. Following isolation from G. rostochiensis and H. glycines [5],
cellulases have been identified in M. incognita [6],
G. tabacum [68], H. schachtii [69], and P. penetrans [70].
Additional prokaryotic-like sequences identified in plant
parasitic nematodes include other cell-wall-degrading
enzymes such as xylanase [7], pectate lyase [8,71] and polygalacturonase [72], and evidence is accumulating that these
sequences have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer
[11]. The known Meloidogyne cellulase (MI00483.cl), potentially novel cellulases (MI00537.cl, MI01196.cl, MI01381.cl,
MI01842.cl), and pectate lyase (MI00592.cl, MI00520.cl)
were represented in the M. incognita EST clusters.
MI01045.cl, the seventh largest Meloidogyne EST cluster, is
a new horizontal gene transfer candidate with homology to
nodL acetyltransferase from Rhizobium leguminosarum (1e53). Nod factor is responsible for the induction of nodules in
nitrogen-fixing plants and nodL has an essential role in Nod
factor biosynthesis [73]. Experimental demonstration of a
trans-spliced leader on the Meloidogyne nodL mRNA and

In addition to applying the approaches presented here to
larger and more diverse datasets, further topics in Meloidogyne genome analysis have yet to be explored. The availability
of ESTs representing different developmental stages of
Meloidogyne will allow an examination of changes in gene
representation between stages, and in turn an understanding
of the relative importance of various metabolic processes at
different stages of development. EST sequences and their corresponding clones can be further used to study relative expression level between stages and conditions using microarrays
[75] and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)
approaches [76]. Contig sequences within clusters can also be
compared directly for evidence of alternative splicing, another
feature which might correlate with developmental stage. Other
topics where bioinformatics analysis of available ESTs can
improve current knowledge of Meloidogyne molecular biology
include the identification of secreted and transmembrane proteins through secretion signal sequence detection [77], the

To identify further horizontal gene transfer candidates from
the M. incognita EST clusters, the subset of clusters with
homology to sequences in other Tylenchida and in nonnematodes but not in non-Tylenchida nematodes were examined. In addition to those sequences already characterized,
four additional clusters of interest were identified.
MI00109.cl shows homology to a group of hypothetical proteins from alpha-proteobacteria: Sinorhizobium meliloti
NP_386252 (3e-44); Novosphingobium aromaticivorans
ZP_00095448 (3e-38); Mesorhizobium loti NP_107072
(5e-37). The finding of multiple Tylenchida genes with close
homologs in rhizobacteria suggests the possibility of horizontal transfer of cassettes of genes or multiple transfer events
between nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria and plant parasitic
nematodes. MI01406.cl and MI00267.cl show homology to
two hypothetical proteins from the Actinomycetales - Amycolatopsis mediterranei CAC42207 (5e-29) and Streptomyces
lavendulae AAD32751 (2e-24). Providing some clue to function, the clusters as well as the hypothetical proteins are more

the presence of introns in the gene confirm that it is not a
bacterial contaminant and more extensive characterization
is underway (E.H. Scholl, J.L. Thorne, J.P.M. and D.M.B.,
unpublished work). It is possible that root-knot nematodes
have adapted a portion of Nod factor biology to the induction of feeding sites, rather than nodules, in plants.

The only previous analysis of root knot nematodes ESTs [29]
used 914 ESTs from M. incognita L2 without clustering and
with non-automated assignment of genes to categories. The
two datasets share some overlap, with 35% (316/914) of the
previously analyzed ESTs finding matches in 16% (261/1,625)
of the NemaGene clusters analyzed in this paper, many with
strong homology (< 1e-40). This overlap was less than
expected given the redundancy of the cDNA library analyzed
here, at nearly 6,000 ESTs, and suggest that: first, libraries
made by different methods are likely to result in different
representation from an mRNA pool (either different genes or
other portions of the same genes as a result of different 5؅
processivity); and second, that M. incognita L2 are likely to
have a substantial number of unsampled messages awaiting
generation of new libraries or library normalization. The
semi-automated clustering, sequence homology searching
and scripted assignment of sequences to functional categories
presented here is a scalable approach to analysis that can be
applied to larger datasets.

As recently as February 2000 only 22 ESTs from plant parasitic nematodes had been deposited in dbEST. As of October
2002, that number has risen to 46,876, including 42,210
from Washington University and collaborators. Included are
32,735 sequences from Meloidogyne species (M. incognita
12,752, M. hapla 11,049, M. javanica 5,600, M. arenaria
3,334), as well as ESTs from cyst nematode species (G. rostochiensis 5,934, H. glycines 4,327, G. pallida 1,832), and the
lesion nematode (P. penetrans 2,048). The majority of these
sequences have been isolated from L2 and egg libraries, but
sequencing from more diverse stages is now underway.

creation of a more accurate codon usage/bias and aminoacid usage tables [78], the identification of conserved genes
and pathways used in dauer/infective stages across nematode species [79], the definition and study of nematodespecific domains [55], and improved phylogenies based on
sampling from multiple genes [53].
While ESTs do not provide information on genome organization in Meloidogyne (no genome sequence or physical map
is yet available), they can shed light on the organization of
the C. elegans genome. For instance, C. elegans autosomes
are organized into central regions dense with predicted
genes, highly expressed genes and known mutants, whereas
the chromosome arms contain more repetitive sequences
and have a higher meiotic recombination rate [31,80]. By
using the expanding collection of ESTs from nematodes at
various evolutionary distances from C. elegans, the hypothesis
that genes on the autosome arms are more rapidly evolving
can be tested more systematically. Mapping of ESTs from
other nematode species can also detect genes contained in
the C. elegans genome yet not previously recognized, and
therefore missing from Wormpep, as well as recognized
genes where not all exons have been correctly predicted.
In conclusion, the 5,713 ESTs analyzed here in 1,625 clusters
probably represent 6-10% of the genes in the M. incognita
genome. This initial study, which will be expanded as further
sequences are generated, demonstrates that EST generation
is an effective method for the discovery of the new genes in
plant parasitic nematodes. Further, functional categorization and comparison to known sequences allows the identification of important biological processes at specific
developmental stages as well as unusual sequences, such as
horizontal gene transfer candidates.

Materials and methods
Source material and library production
To obtain M. incognita L2 larvae, a population of nematodes
maintained on Rutgers tomato were harvested, eggs were
isolated and hatched by standard protocols [81]. Briefly,
galled roots were removed from sandy soil, rinsed, and
shaken in 15% bleach for 3 min to break roots and free egg
masses. Contents were filtered with a large excess of water
through a No. 200 sieve to remove root and soil fragments,
and a No. 500 sieve to retain nematode eggs. Decanted eggs
in small volume were applied above a 40% sucrose solution
in a 50 ml conical tube and spun at 2,000 rpm for 10 min.
Eggs banded at the sucrose/water interface and were
removed by pipette. Following rinsing, sucrose banding was
repeated. Harvested eggs were hatched over 4 days on top of
a moist filter paper barrier (3 Crown Shopmaster heavy-duty
wipes). Hatched larvae migrated through the paper and were
collected in a water-filled petri dish below. By microscopic
examination, collected worms were predominantly live
moving L2, but rare dead L2 and eggs could be found.

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/4/R26

Total RNA was isolated from collected L2 by the Trizol
method (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) with a yield
of 380 ␮g from around 1 ml of packed L2 worms. Poly(A)+
RNA was isolated from total RNA using the Promega Isolation System II (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer’s instructions with a yield of 4.04 ␮g. The cDNA
library (named Bird_Rao_Meloidogyne_incognita_J2) was
constructed using the Zap Express cDNA Synthesis Kit and
Gigapack III Gold Cloning Kit, 200403 (Stratagene, Cedar
Creek, TX). Inserts were directionally cloned between an
EcoRI site (5؅) and a XhoI site (3؅); however, sequencing
indicates that ~22% of clones are in reverse orientation. The
non-directionality of the library does not interfere with either
clustering or homology detection as both orientations are
examined. The titer of the non-amplified phage library was
70,000 recombinants. In preparation for high-throughput
sequencing the pBK-CMV phagemid was excised in bulk from
the Zap Express phage using the ExAssist Interference-Resistant Helper Phage protocol 211203 (Stratagene). Resulting
plasmids were replicated in the helper phage-resistant host
cell XLOLR with kanamycin selection. It is expected that the
majority of messages in this whole-animal library derive from
the tissues that make up most of the mass of the L2 animal
including hypodermis/cuticle, intestine, muscle, esophageal
and rectal gland, and esophagus/pharnyx [82].

Sequence production and dbEST submission
Clone processing and sequencing was performed as in Hiller
et al. [83] with some modifications. Single bacterial colonies
from the plasmid library were picked from agar trays into
384-well plates containing media, kanamycin, and 7%
glycerol using a Q-bot robotic colony picker (Genetix,
Christchurch, UK). Plates were incubated overnight at 37°C
and stored at -80°C. To prepare template plasmid DNA from
each sample, bacterial inoculates were transferred from 384well storage to 96-well growth blocks containing 1 ml
medium per sample and grown overnight. All subsequent
sample and reagent transfers were done using a stationary
96-channel Hydra (Robbins Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA). DNA
isolation was performed using a fast and inexpensive
microwave-based protocol [84]. Sequencing reactions using
the T3 (5؅) primer employed BigDye terminator chemistry
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the cycle sequencing
reactions were performed with 96 x 4-block thermocyclers
(MJ Research, Waltham, MA). Samples were loaded on
ABI377 (96-lane slab gel) sequencers (Applied Biosystems).
Following gel image analysis and DNA sequence extraction,
sequence data were processed in an automated pipeline to:
assess EST quality; trim flanking vector sequences; mask
repetitive elements; remove contaminated ESTs; identify
similarities by BLAST; identify cloning artifacts; and determine which portion of the EST to submit [83]. The resulting
sequences were annotated with similarity information and
sequence quality information and submitted to dbEST.
Clones are named for their 96-well plate identity and

Clustering was performed by first building ‘contigs’ of ESTs
with identical or nearly identical overlapping sequence and
second, by bringing together related contigs to form ‘clusters’. Contig member ESTs should all derive from identical
transcripts whereas cluster members might derive from the
same gene yet represent different transcript splice isoforms
or transcripts from multigene families with extremely high

Following the creation of contigs by Phrap, the contig consensus sequences were compared using WU-BLASTN (G = 2
E = 1 v = 100 F = F) [92,93] and grouped on the basis of similarity to form clusters of related contigs. Contigs with overlaps of 100 bases or more with nucleotide-nucleotide
identities of 93% or more were clustered together. For
further analysis, new assemblies based on clusters were not
formed; rather, each cluster retained all the consensus
sequences of its contig members. NemaGene Meloidogyne
incognita v 2.0 represents our second complete attempt at
generating clusters for this species and is used as the basis
for all subsequent analysis in this manuscript. Scripts have

Clustering for NemaGene Meloidogyne incognita v 2.0

Once acceptable assembly parameters were obtained, Phrap
was run to generate a first-draft assembly. Contigs with only
one member EST (singletons) were removed from consideration until the trimming and cluster building stage. All
contigs with more than three member ESTs was screened for
misassemblies using Consed tools and newly written scripts.
Misassemblies were recognized by: regions of high quality
unaligned sequence; multiple runs of poly(A) and/or poly(T)
(at least 15 nucleotides with no more than a one non-A/T
base); internal poly(A) and/or poly(T) runs (> 50
nucleotides from either end of a contig and Ն 15 or more
nucleotides long with no more than one non-A/T base; internal stretches of low consensus quality (> 30 nucleotides
from either end of a contig and Ն 50 nucleotides where 90%
of the nucleotides had a consensus quality below Phred 20).
Contigs flagged for possible misassembly were manually
edited in Consed and potentially chimeric ESTs and other
suspect ESTs were identified and removed from the pool of
traces. Chimerism can result from multiple-insert cloning or
mistracking of sequence gel lanes. The project was reassembled with Phrap and screened again as above. All contigs
with more than three members were examined again in
Consed to eliminate additional misassemblies not resolved
by the initial screens. In total, around 450 contigs were
examined manually and around 200 were edited. For each
contig, a consensus sequence of all EST members was generated. Contigs (now including singleton EST contigs) were
then trimmed to high quality and any internal consensus
position with a calculated quality value below 12 was
changed to an N (unknown base).

To estimate the number of 5؅ versus 3؅ reads, we examined
the 4,198 ESTs with detectable homology on either sense or
antisense strands at time of submission (BLASTX search
versus the SWIR non-redundant protein database, Sanger
Centre). Most ESTs (78%) showed translated amino-acid
homology consistent with sequencing from the 5؅ end of the
transcript, while 22% showed homology consistent with 3؅
end sequencing. The mean submitted read length was 481
nucleotides with a standard deviation of 108. Longest and
shorted submitted reads were 49 and 780, respectively.
Since our submission filter includes a quality cut-off at the
distal end of the read (Phred Score < 12 [87,88]), additional
sequence can sometimes be obtained by direct examination
of the sequencing trace available at [89].

sequence identity. The raw traces for submitted ESTs were
base-called using Phred [87] and assembled to form contigs
using Phrap (P. Green, personal communication). Although
Phrap is a program intended for genome assembly, it has
been applied previously to ESTs with modifications [90]. To
determine initial assembly quality, the largest contigs were
inspected using the assembly viewer Consed [91]. Misassemblies bringing unrelated ESTs together into giant contigs
usually resulted from the alignment of long poly(A) tails. To
eliminate these assemblies of otherwise dissimilar ESTs,
Phrap parameters (forcelevel 1, minmatch 20 and minscore
100) were adjusted and Phrap was rerun.

reviews

A failure rate of 25% is typical for high-throughput sequencing and resulted from poor overall trace quality (~21% of all
reads), missing insert (~0.3%), small insert size (~0.06%),
and E. coli contamination (~0.1%). To further exclude bacterial contamination we have closely examined cases where
strong amino-acid homology to prokaryotic genes is
observed (see Horizontal gene transfer candidates). Many of
these genes have already been confirmed as of M. incognita
origin by cloning from genomic DNA, in situ localization and
the finding of homologs in other Tylenchida nematodes. In
all of these cases, the high level of identity observed at the
amino-acid level does not extend to nucleotide level, and GC
content and codon usage is typical of other M. incognita
transcripts (E.H. Scholl, J.L. Thorne, J.P.M. and D.M.B.,
unpublished work).

been written to allow the addition of new data while retaining the original contig and cluster naming scheme. Additional NemaGene versions of M. incognita will be built as
additional ESTs become available for the species. A comparison of the NemaGene clustering approach to other EST clustering methods will be considered in a separate manuscript.
NemaGene Meloidogyne incognita v 2.0 is available for
searching at [94] and FTP at [95].

Sequence analysis
Following clustering, comparative analyses were performed
using WU-BLASTX and WU-TBLASTX [92,93] with 1,798
contig consensus sequences (themselves grouped into 1,625
cluster groups) as queries versus multiple databases including SWIR v.21 (5/19/2000) non-redundant protein database
and Wormpep v.54 C. elegans protein database (Wellcome
Trust Sanger Institute, unpublished work), C. elegans mitochondrial protein sequences, and six internally constructed
databases using intersections of data from the GenBank
nucleotide database and dbEST [96]. These include: nemnoele (all nucleotide data from the phylum Nematoda with
C. elegans removed); nemnoelenomi (nemnoele with
M. incognita removed); nemnoelenomel (nemnoele with all
Meloidogyne species removed); nemnoelenotyl (nemnoele
with all Tylenchida species removed); yestylnomel (all
Tylenchida species except Meloidogyne); mj (only M. javanica sequences). An additional database, nrnonem, is an
amino-acid database of all non-nematode proteins derived
from SWIR v.21. WU-BLASTX (translated nucleotide query
versus protein database) parameters were S = 100 M =
PAM120 V =0 W = 4 T = 17. WU-TBLASTX (translated
nucleotide query versus translated nucleotide database, each
in all six reading frames) parameters were Q = 10 R = 2 gapw
= 10. Homologies were reported for e-value scores of 1e-5 and
better. By creating intersections of various database search
results, contigs/clusters could be organized by their distribution of homologies (for example, clusters which have M.
javanica matches but not C. elegans matches). Data analysis
was performed in a Unix environment using Perl and Bourne
shell scripts. The program ESTFreq (W. Gish, personal communication) was used to estimate novel sequences expected
from a second sampling and the program Translate (S. Eddy,
personal communication) was used to translate nucleotide
consensus sequences for ORF analysis.

Functional assignments
To assign putative functions to clusters, the integrated
protein domain recognition program InterProScan [97,98]
was run locally to search translated contig consensus
sequences versus all InterPro protein domains (as of 2 April
2002) [99]. The Prosite, Prints, Pfam, ProDom, and Smart
search components of InterProScan were used with default
parameters. The GO categorization scheme (go_200205assocdb.sql) of classification by biological process, cellular
component, and molecular function was used to classify
clusters based on the existing mappings of InterPro domains

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/4/R26

to the GO hierarchy [36]. Mappings were stored in a local
MySQL database and displayed using the AmiGO browser
(16 May 2002) [100] (M. incognita mappings at [101]).
As an alternative means of assigning function to clusters,
clusters were also assigned to metabolic pathways using
KEGG [102,103]. Assignments were made by requiring that
the highest-scoring BLAST match in SWIR v.21 have an
assigned enzyme commission (EC) number [104]. EC
number mappings to KEGG pathways were then used to
putatively assign clusters into biochemical pathways. Nonspecific pathway mappings (for example, kinases, EC 2.7.1.-)
were eliminated, as were misleading pathway assignments
(for example, plant carbon fixation, KEGG 2.3, where the
assigned protein had only a peripheral ‘feed-in’ role in the
pathway). Assignments were not made to KEGG regulatory
pathways as proteins in these pathways lack EC numbers.

C. elegans homologs with RNAi phenotype
To identify cases where M. incognita and C. elegans share
homologous genes which have been surveyed in C. elegans
for knockout phenotype using RNAi, a list of all 7,212 available C. elegans RNAi experiments (5 May 2002) from
WormBase [56] was compared to the list of all M. incognita
clusters with significant homology matches to the C. elegans
Wormpep v.54 protein database. Redundant RNAi experiments were removed to consolidate the WormBase list to
6,107 and experiments performed on the same gene with different phenotypic outcomes were consolidated later. For any
given M. incognita cluster, only the best C. elegans matches,
ranked by BLAST score, were considered.

Nematode origin of the cDNA sequences
To insure that sequences generated originate from M. incognita and are not contaminants, multiple steps purifying
material and cross-checking sequence origin have been
incorporated into the project: the starting material is purified and freed of plant material; poly(A) selection during
library production is highly selective for eukaryotic transcripts, though it is possible for AT-rich prokaryotic transcripts to be cloned; analyzed sequences have been filtered
for prokaryotic homology resulting in the removal of eight
E. coli contaminants (0.14%), a typical background for cDNA
cloning; 96% of the clusters with detectable homology have
nematode homologs (1,227/1,280), 17% have only nematode
homology, and in the vast majority of cases, higher conservation is seen to a nematode sequence than any non-nematode sequence; additional confirmation of nematode origin
comes from the presence of an SL1 trans-spliced leader
sequence on some genes; all sequences with strong aminoacid homology to prokaryotic genes were closely examined
and in no cases were the high levels of identity maintained at
the nucleotide level (as would be the case with a contaminating sequence). While it can be stated with confidence that
the vast majority of the sequence analyzed originates from
M. incognita, we cannot rule out the possibility that the
