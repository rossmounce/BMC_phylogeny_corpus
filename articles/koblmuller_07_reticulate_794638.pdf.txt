Abstract
Background: The tribe Lamprologini is the major substrate breeding lineage of Lake Tanganyika's cichlid species
flock. Among several different life history strategies found in lamprologines, the adaptation to live and breed in
empty gastropod shells is probably the most peculiar. Although shell-breeding arose several times in the
evolutionary history of the lamprologines, all obligatory and most facultative shell-breeders belong to the so called
"ossified group", a monophyletic lineage within the lamprologine cichlids. Since their distinctive life style enables
these species to live and breed in closest vicinity, we hypothesized that these cichlids might be particularly prone
to accidental hybridization, and that introgression might have affected the evolutionary history of this cichlid
lineage.
Results: Our analyses revealed discrepancies between phylogenetic hypotheses based on mitochondrial and
nuclear (AFLP) data. While the nuclear phylogeny was congruent with morphological, behavioral and ecological
characteristics, several species – usually highly specialized shell-breeders – were placed at contradicting positions
in the mitochondrial phylogeny. The discordant phylogenies strongly suggest repeated incidents of introgressive
hybridization between several distantly related shell-breeding species, which reticulated the phylogeny of this
group of cichlids. Long interior branches and high bootstrap support for many interior nodes in the mitochondrial
phylogeny argue against a major effect of ancient incomplete lineage sorting on the phylogenetic reconstruction.
Moreover, we provide morphological and genetic (mtDNA and microsatellites) evidence for ongoing
hybridization among distantly related shell-breeders. In these cases, the territorial males of the inferred paternal
species are too large to enter the shells of their mate, such that they have to release their sperm over the
entrance of the shell to fertilize the eggs. With sperm dispersal by water currents and wave action, trans-specific
fertilization of clutches in neighboring shells seem inevitable, when post-zygotic isolation is incomplete.
Conclusion: From the direct observation of hybrids we conclude that hybridization between distantly related
gastropod-shell-breeding cichlids of Lake Tanganyika follows inevitably from their ecological specialization.
Moreover, the observed incongruence between mtDNA and nuclear multilocus phylogeny suggests that repeated
hybridization events among quite distantly related taxa affected the diversification of this group, and introduced
reticulation into their phylogeny.

Background

Results and discussion

With an age of 9–12 million years, Lake Tanganyika is the
oldest of the three East African Great Lakes and harbors
the morphologically, behaviorally and ecologically most
diverse cichlid species flock, whose ancestors colonized
the swampy and shallow ecosystem of the emerging lake
shortly after its formation [1]. The 250 or more cichlid
species of Lake Tanganyika have been grouped into a
number of mostly endemic tribes, among which the tribe
Lamprologini [2] is the most species-rich with >80 species. The Lamprologini are the only substrate-breeding
endemics in Lake Tanganyika; nearly all of the remaining
species are maternal or biparental mouthbrooders. Several of the Lamprologini developed a distinctive life style,
in that they live and breed in empty shells of the gastropod species Neothauma tanganyicense, and sometimes Pila
ovata, Paramelania spp. and Lavigeria spp. [3,4]. Shellbreeding represents a highly successful evolutionary strategy, and although the behavior arose multiple times during the radiation of the lamprologines [5], most shellbreeding species are members of the "ossified group", a
monophyletic group of 28 species characterized by a sesamoid bone within the labial filament [6]. The "ossified
group" includes both the smallest (3.5 cm) and the largest
lamprologine (>30 cm); in shell-breeding species, either
both sexes are sufficiently small to fit in gastropod-shells,
or the sexes display extreme size dimorphism with dwarf
females and males too large to enter the shells [7].

Hybrid speciation reticulates the phylogeny of the
"ossified group" of lamprologines
Reticulate evolution became first apparent in phylogenetic reconstructions based on 1047 bp of the mitochondrial ND2 gene. The phylogeny of the ossified-group
lamprologines (Fig. 2A) is largely congruent with previous
reconstructions based on different taxon sampling [5,8],
subdividing the "ossified group" into 4 – 5 clades depending on the tree-building algorithm used. A linearized tree
analysis suggests that the majority of clades arose at a
divergence level of about 7% (TrN+Γ distances; Fig. 3),
which corresponds to major cladogenesis events in other
Lake Tanganyika cichlid lineages [9-11] and platythelphusid crabs [12]. Their diversification may thus have
been induced by the same environmental factor, most
likely by a substantial drop of the lake level during a
period of aridification in eastern Africa about 2.5 to 3 million years ago [13].

Most shell-breeding species utilize shell-beds aggregated
by wave action or individual shells scattered on the lake
floor, but males of one species – Lamprologus callipterus –
collect and pile shells to nests [3]. Some of these shells
may already be inhabited by another shell breeder, which
thus gets transferred into the L. callipterus nest. Additionally, shell-breeders often colonize these nests actively,
such that shell nests and natural shell aggregations often
house a densely packed multi-species community of individuals living and breeding in closest vicinity (Fig. 1).
Given that large males spawn openly over the mouth of
their mate's shell, this concentration of breeding pairs of
different species sets the stage for accidental hybridization
and hybridization associated with the employment of
alternative reproductive strategies [7].
In order to obtain a better understanding of the evolution
and pathways of diversification of shell-breeding lamprologine cichlids, we aimed to reconstruct the phylogeny of
the "ossified group" of lamprologines by means of
sequences of the entire mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene (ND2) and a set of AFLP markers, and
investigate the role of past and ongoing hybridization in
the diversification of this group of fishes. Morphological
data were incorporated in the analyses to infer hybridization partners.

Despite the strength of the phylogenetic signal and the
high resolution of reconstructed species relationships, the
mtDNA phylogeny contains several groupings in striking
conflict with morphological, ecological and behavioral
similarities. Remarkably, all inconsistencies involve gastropod shell breeders. The first pair of eco-morphologically and behaviorally highly similar species resolved in
different clades on the mitochondrial tree is Neolamprologus similis and N. multifasciatus (Fig. 2A). Males and
females of both species are sufficiently small to enter gastropod shells – N. multifasciatus is the smallest Tanganyikan cichlid known to date (3.5 cm)- and both species
are facultative shell-breeders, which arrange their nests by
excavating sand craters around small accumulations of
empty shells and live in family groups. The second group
of morphologically and behaviorally similar species separated in the mitochondrial phylogeny includes Lamprologus ocellatus, L. meleagris, L. speciosus and N. wauthioni.
These species are sexually monomorphic (see Table 1 for
more information), small-bodied obligatory shell-breeders with a maximum size of about 6 cm that prefer areas
with low densities of empty gastropod shells. In each species, the males defend territories and hold harems of two
to five females for whom they bury shells in a way that
only the opening of the shell remains accessible to a resident female [14]. L. meleagris occurs sympatrically with N.
wauthioni in the north, and with L. speciosus in the south
of its distribution range. Despite their morphological and
behavioral similarity, each of these four species clusters
with different, eco-morphologically very dissimilar, species (Fig. 2A). Although contrasting with phenotypic data,
the mitochondrial tree topology receives high bootstrap
support, and a monophyletic clade of L. speciosus, L. meleagris, L. ocellatus and N. wauthioni requires at least 56 additional steps in a MP phylogeny (P < 0.001; Δ -ln L =

206.84, P < 0.001). Forcing N. similis and N. multifasciatus
into a monophyletic clade did not significantly increase
tree length (P > 0.05; Δ -ln L = 24.43, P > 0.05), but bootstrap support for the non-sister group relationship
between N. multifasciatus and N. similis was high.
In contrast, species relationships inferred from a set of 199
polymorphic AFLP markers were consistent with predictions based on phenotypic trait similarities, as each of the
two groups of eco-morphologically similar species was
resolved as a monophyletic clade (Fig. 2B). Disparate
mitochondrial and nuclear reconstructions were also
obtained for the phylogenetic position of another shellbreeding species: Neolamprologus fasciatus clustered with L.
callipterus and N. wauthioni in the mtDNA-phylogeny, but
was placed ancestral to N. multifasciatus and N. similis by

AFLP analyses. A constrained mitochondrial tree congruent with the nuclear placement of N. fasciatus would
require significantly more evolutionary steps under both
parsimony and likelihood criteria (at least 22 steps in MP,
P < 0.001; Δ -ln L = 97.08, P < 0.001 in ML). Although the
current data allow only limited inference of the phylogenetic history of N. fasciatus, we can definitely rule out a
close affinity to the genus Altolamprologus, which has been
suggested due to superficial morphological similarities
[14].
Ancient hybridization and ancient incomplete lineage
sorting are alternative explanations for the observed discrepancy between the mitochondrial phylogeny and relationships predicted by nuclear markers, phenotypes and
behavior. Mismatches among gene trees can result from

when intervals between successive branching events are
too short for lineage sorting to be completed within each
branch prior to the next split [15,16]. This phenomenon
occurs, for example, when taxa speciate rapidly during
adaptive radiation, and has been repeatedly reported from

the cichlid species flocks in the East African Great Lakes
[15,17-20]. In the mitochondrial phylogeny of the shellbreeding Lamprologini, the taxa affected by inconsistent
mitochondrial and nuclear tree topologies (L. speciosus, L.
meleagris, L. ocellatus and N. wauthioni; and N. multifasciatus and N. similis) have their most recent common ances-

ancient incomplete lineage sorting on the phylogenetic
reconstruction.
Nuclear loci coalesce more slowly [21], and are therefore
subjected to lineage sorting incongruence over longer
periods. The combination of multiple independent loci,
as implemented by the AFLP technique, is expected to
overcome the problem of idiosyncratic lineage sorting at
individual loci [22-24]. Additionally, the species relationships suggested by our AFLP data are supported by phenotypic and behavioral similarities, which makes it unlikely
that the AFLP clades result from stochastic lineage sorting
rather than reflecting actual relationships.
We contend that the incongruence between the mitochondrial phylogeny and multiple nuclear markers, phenotypes and behavior is best explained by ancient
introgressive hybridization events. Furthermore, it is possible that hybridization was directly associated with the
speciation of L. meleagris, N. wauthioni, L. speciosus, and N.
multifasciatus (Fig. 4), and perhaps also N. fasciatus. Species status according to the biological species concept [25]
of the presumed hybrid taxa is supported by sympatric
occurrences of L. meleagris with L. speciosus in the south
and N. wauthioni in the north of its distribution range, and
the lake-wide, continuous distribution of N. fasciatus.

cladogenesis, such that there may be no major effect of

Although published mitochondrial phylogenies of the
mouthbrooding tribes encompass representative species
samples [[9-11,26,27], and unpublished data), striking
incongruencies with behavioral, ecological and morphological data were detected only in the tribes Tropheini
[26,28,29] and Eretmodini [30]. In the tropheine genus
Petrochromis, the incongruence was explained by parallel
evolution of distinct eco-morphotypes [26], whereas disparate mitochondrial placements of color morphs and
species in the tropheine genus Tropheus [28,29] and in the
tribe Eretmodini [20] were attributed to introgressive
hybridization after secondary admixis. In contrast, diversifying hybridization has been proposed in studies of the
substrate breeding Lamprologini, including a role of
introgressive hybridization in the speciation of Neolamprologus marunguensis [31] and of Lepidiolamprologus nkambae, a non-shell-breeding member of the "ossified group"
of lamprologines [8]. Our results with the shell-breeding
lamprologines provide a further example of potential evolutionary consequences of introgressive hybridization in
another guild of lamprologine cichlids.
In two instances, species were resolved non-monophyletically. Altolamprologus calvus was paraphyletic in relation
to A. compressiceps in the AFLP tree, and Lepidiolamprologus

meeli in the AFLP tree, while the two taxa were placed in
different clades by the mitochondrial sequences. The tax-

onomy of these species is not well resolved, in that populations with intermediate phenotypes and phenotypic
divergence across geographic distances have not yet been
adequately addressed (Schelly, pers. comm.). The here
identified incongruence between the phylogenetic and
current taxonomic resolution must not be dismissed as a
possible consequence of persistent ancestral polymorphism in the genetic data, but pinpoints a need for more
detailed taxonomic and molecular genetic work on these
taxa.
Ongoing hybridization among "ossified group"
lamprologines
Evidence for past hybridization affecting the evolutionary
history of the "ossified group" of lamprologines obviously

raises the question whether there is also evidence for
ongoing hybridization among shell-breeding cichlids.
Indeed, within a small area of suitable habitat containing
several L. callipterus nests in southern Lake Tanganyika
(near Wonzye, Zambia), we collected four specimens that
could not be identified to species level but were clearly
lamprologine cichlids. Although lamprologines hybridize
readily in captivity, this is the first proof of viable natural
hybrids in Lake Tanganyika. Mitochondrial sequences
determined that the mothers of the hybrids were members
of the N. brevis/N. calliurus – clade (Fig. 2A). Hybrid phenotypes and data from six microsatellite loci suggested
that two of the hybrids were sired by L. callipterus and the
other two by N. fasciatus (Fig. 5A). Morphological similarity indices (Fig. 5B), and a principal component analysis

of morphometric and meristic measurements (Fig. 5C)
further supported the phenotypically and genetically
inferred identity of the parental species. Furthermore, territorial males of the two putative paternal species L. callipterus and N. fasciatus are too large to enter empty shells
(see Fig. 1), and release their sperm over the entrance of
their mate's shell to fertilize her eggs. Dispersion of sperm
into adjacent shells by water currents and wave action can
bypass prezygotic isolation between species sharing a
shell-bed, and result in trans-specific fertilization and
hybridization, when post-zygotic isolation is incomplete.
Within the lamprologines, the inferred hybridization
partners are only distantly related, as the split between the
mitochondrial lineages including N. brevis/calliurus and
the lineage containing L. callipterus and N. fasciatus is estimated as 3.80 (± 1.33) – 4.58 (± 1.60) million years
before presence (TrN+Γ distance, 9.08 ± 1.33%; gammacorrected amino acid distance, 4.44 ± 1.55%) based on a
molecular clock for the ND2 gene of cichlid fish [11]. The
two N. fasciatus hybrids and one of the L. callipterus
hybrids shared a mitochondrial haplotype, whereas a different haplotype was detected in the second L. callipterus
hybrid (Fig. 1). Hence, the four hybrid individuals represent at least three independent hybridization events
between the genetically and morphologically highly
divergent species, suggesting that hybridization among
shell-breeding species is not uncommon. Introgressive
hybridization is commonly associated with loss of diversity through extinction or homogenization of species [3234], and the maintenance of species integrity in the face of
hybridization suggests that introgression between lamprologine species is constrained by low hybrid fitness.
Accidental hybridization among shell-breeders is independent of prezygotic species barriers and unresponsive
to reinforcement of pre-mating isolation, such that
hybridization rates may not decrease over long divergence
times despite possible costs through reduced hybrid fitness.

diversity and a strong potential for transgressive segregation in hybrid populations, a condition that allows for the
occasional emergence of a successful novel trait combination [38-40]. Stabilization of a recombinant population
requires reproductive isolation from the parental species,
which has been shown to ensue from ecological separation from both parent species in several cases of hybrid
speciation [39]. During the evolutionary history of Lake
Tanganyika cichlids, periodical habitat changes associated
with lake level fluctuations may have occasionally promoted the stabilization of hybrid populations by providing novel ecological niches, and by precipitating
displacements and splits of populations [41], such that
geographic separation may have added to or even substituted for ecologically mediated isolation.

Methods
Sampling
Representatives of 31 lamprologine cichlid species,
including the outgroup taxa Variablichromis moorii, Telmatochromis vittatus and Julidochromis ornatus, were collected
during several sampling trips to Lake Tanganyika from
1992 to 2004 or obtained via the aquarium trade. Fin clips
were taken from fresh specimens and preserved in 96%
ethanol. Voucher specimens are available from the
authors.
mtDNA
We analyzed 1047 bp of the entire mitochondrial ND2
gene for 69 individuals, representing 30 sampled species
and four putative hybrids. When available, previously
published sequences were used [1,8]. Total DNA-extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and chain termination sequencing followed standard protocols [9,42]. For
both, PCR and chain termination reaction sequencing, we
used the primers MET, ND2.2A, TRP [43] and ND2.T-R
[11]. Sequences were visualized on an ABI 3100
Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). All sequences are available from GenBank under the accession numbers listed in
Additional File 1.

Conclusion
Compared to plants [35], the role of hybridization in speciation and diversification in animals has been demonstrated in only a few examples [36] including several
cichlid species [8,31,37,38]. Our study suggests that shellbreeding lamprologine cichlids experience considerable
rates of hybridization without suffering significant erosion of phenotypic diversity. The fixation of introgressed
mitochondrial haplotypes reticulated the evolution of this
group. Although our data do not provide direct proof of
speciation by hybridization, they are consistent with the
hypothesis that hybridization might have contributed to
the diversification of gastropod shell-breeding cichlids.
The high degree of morphological differentiation among
lamprologine species entails elevated levels of functional

2:1 with respect to transitions, according to the estimated
TI/TV ratio of 2.1140. Synonymous transitions at first
positions of leucine codons were treated like transitions at
third codon positions. Bootstrapping (1000 pseudo-replicates for NJ and MP; 100 pseudo-replicates for ML) and
quartet puzzling [47] (25 000 random quartets) were

applied to estimate support of the obtained topologies.
Phylogenetic relationships were also estimated by a Bayesian method of phylogenetic inference using MRBAYES
3.0b4 [48]. Posterior probabilities were obtained from a
1,000,000 generation Metropolis-coupled Markov chain
Monte Carlo simulation (four chains; chain temperature,
0.2) with parameters estimated from the data set. Trees
were sampled every hundred generations and the first
10% of all trees were excluded as burn-in to allow likelihood values to reach stationary.
To derive a relative dating of diversification events in the
"ossified group" of lamprologines, we computed a linearized tree, using the program LINTRE [49]. To test for constancy of the rate of base substitution among all taxa we
performed a branch length test implemented in the program LINTRE based on TrN+ Δ distances (α = 0.2841).
Neolamprologus leloupi showed a significantly deviating
substitution rate at the 1% level and was therefore
excluded from the calculation of a clock-constrained tree.
Mean and standard deviation of average pairwise TrN+ Δ
distances were calculated to achieve a relative dating of
diversification events. Since no fossil record is available as
calibration point for the "ossified group" of lamprologines, a molecular clock for the cichlid ND2 gene based
upon gamma corrected amino acid distances [11], calculated with the program TREE-PUZZLE 5.0 [50], was
applied to obtain absolute datings for cladogenesis
events.
The significance of differences between alternative tree
topologies was evaluated by Kishino-Hasegawa tests [51]
and Shimodeira-Hasegawa tests [52] under maximum
parsimony and likelihood criteria, respectively.
AFLPs
For AFLP fingerprinting, whole genomic DNA was
extracted from 47 specimens representing 25 species of
the "ossified group" of lamprologines and the three outgroup species Julidochromis ornatus, Telmatochromis vittatus
and Variabilichromis moorii applying proteinase K digestion followed by protein precipitation with ammonium
acetate and ethanol precipitation of DNA. Restriction
digestion of 100 ng of genomic DNA was performed in a
total volume of 50 μl using 0.5 μl MseI (10 units/μl, New
England Biolabs), 0.25 μl EcoRI (200 units/μl, New England Biolabs), 5 μl enzyme buffer (10×), 0.5 μl BSA
(100×) and high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) water, and incubation for three hours at 37°C.
For ligation of adaptors, 1 μl EcoRI-adaptor (50 pmol/μl),
1 μl MseI-adaptor (5 pmol/μl), 1 μl T4 ligase buffer, 0.2 μl
T4 DNA ligase and 6.8 μl HPLC water were added to the
product of the restriction digestion and incubated over
night at 37°C. The ligation products were subsequently
diluted to 180 μl using HPLC water. PCR was carried out

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/7

in two steps as recommended by [53]. Preselective amplifications were performed with 3 μl of the diluted ligation
product, 0.4 μl each of EcoRI and MseI preselective primers
(10 μM), 2 μl 10 × MgCl2 buffer, 2 μl 10 × dNTP mix (10
μM) and 0.6 μl Taq DNA polymerase (5 units/μl, BioTherm™) in a final volume of 20 μl. The preselective primers consisted of the adaptor primer sequence with a single
selective nucleotide at the 3' end (EcoRI-pre: A, MseI-pre:
C). The preselective PCR used the following temperature
profile: 2 min at 72°C followed by 20 cycles of 20 sec at
94°C, 30 sec at 56°C, and 2 min at 72°C, then a holding
step at 60°C for 30 min. PCR products were diluted 1:10
for selective amplification. The following recipe was used
for selective amplifications with primers extending 3 bp
beyond the adaptor sequence: 1 μl of the diluted preselective PCR product, 6.3 μl HPLC water, 0.8 μl 10 × dNTP
mix (10 μM), 1 μl 10 × MgCl2 buffer, 0.4 μl Taq DNA
polymerase (5 units/μl; BioTherm™), 1 μl selective MseI
primer (10 μM) and 1 μl selective EcoRI primer (1 μM)
labeled with the fluorescent dye FAM. The primer combinations used for selective amplification were: EcoRI-ACA/
MseI-CAT, EcoRI-ACT/MseI-CAT, EcoRI-ACT/MseI-CAA,
EcoRI-ACT/MseI-CAC. The temperature profile for the
selective PCR was as follows: 2 min at 94°C followed by
10 cycles with 20 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at annealing temperature, which decreased in each cycle by 1°C from 65°C to
56°C, and 2 min at 72°C. The PCR continued for 25
cycles with 20 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at 56°C, and 2 min at
72°C, followed by a holding step at 60°C for 30 min. All
amplifications were performed on a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems). Selective amplification
products were visualized on an ABI 3100 automated
sequencer (Applied Biosystems) along with an internal
size standard (GeneScan-500 ROX, Applied Biosystems).
Raw fragment data were analyzed using GENEMAPPER
(version 3.7, Applied Biosystems). Presence or absence of
peaks (presumed to represent homologous fragments)
was scored by eye (in order to avoid misinterpretations
inherent to automated fragment scoring) within a range
of 100–500 bp and assembled as a binary (1/0) matrix by
GENEMAPPER. In a few cases, fragments were scored as
missing data when character states could not be determined unambiguously. Matrices from the different primer
combinations were assembled into one data set.
A neighbor joining tree based on pairwise genetic distances [54] obtained from the presence/absence matrix
was calculated with the program TREECON 1.3b [55].
Bootstrap values from 1000 pseudo-replicates were used
as a standard measure of confidence in the reconstructed
tree topology.

Morphological analysis
Similarity-indices between hybrid individuals and eight
possible parental species were calculated based upon the
presence or absence of 13 qualitative characters (Additional File 2). Furthermore, a principal component analysis based upon 13 morphometric (Additional File 3) and
8 meristic (Additional File 4) characters [56,57] in the
four hybrids and the presumed parental species was performed (n = 5 individuals per species). Since the first principal component of the morphometric dataset proofed to
be mainly influenced by the standard length, it was not
used for analysis. Thus, we plotted PC1 of the meristic
data against PC2 of the morphometric data. Loading factors are depicted in Additional Files 5 and 6.
Microsatellites
Microsatellite markers were used to support morphological inferences of species identity of the parents of the collected hybrid individuals. The four hybrid individuals,
one to three representatives of 15 species of obligatory
and facultative shell-breeding lamprologines and populations of the three candidate parent species (as identified
by morphological criteria) were genotyped at six microsatellite loci with low intraspecific variation in lamprologine cichlids (Pzeb3 [58], TmoM25, TmoM27 [59],
UNH154 [60], UNH855 and UNH952 [61]; see Additional Files 7 and 8). Populations of the three candidate
parental species, Lamprologus callipterus (n = 19), Neolamprologus brevis/calliurus (n = 24) and N. fasciatus (n = 21)
were sampled at the same locality as the hybrid individuals (Wonzye, S 08°43', E 31°08'). Mitochondrial
sequences placed all four hybrid individuals in the clade
containing N. brevis and N. calliurus, which are very
closely related and often synonymized since sub-adult
individuals of these two species cannot be distinguished
in the field (Figs. 2, 3, 4).

Total DNA-extraction and amplification of microsatellites
followed standard protocols [62]. Fragments were visualized on an ABI 377 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using forward primers labeled with fluorescence
dyes FAM, TET or HEX, and the internal size standard
Genescan-500 TAMRA (Applied Biosystems).
