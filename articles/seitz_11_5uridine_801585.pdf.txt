A 5′-uridine amplifies miRNA/miRNA* asymmetry
in Drosophila by promoting RNA-induced
silencing complex formation
Hervé Seitz1,2*, Jogender S Tushir3 and Phillip D Zamore3*

Abstract
Background: MicroRNA (miRNA) are diverse in sequence and have a single known sequence bias: they tend to
start with uridine (U).
Results: Our analyses of fly, worm and mouse miRNA sequence data reveal that the 5′-U is recognized after
miRNA production. Only one of the two strands can be assembled into Argonaute protein from a single
miRNA/miRNA* molecule: in fly embryo lysate, a 5′-U promotes miRNA loading while decreasing the loading of
the miRNA*.
Conclusion: We suggest that recognition of the 5′-U enhances Argonaute loading by a mechanism distinct from
its contribution to weakening base pairing at the 5′-end of the prospective miRNA and, as recently proposed in
Arabidopsis and in humans, that it improves miRNA precision by excluding incorrectly processed molecules bearing
other 5′-nt.

Background
MicroRNA (miRNA) are approximately 22-nt regulatory
RNA that direct members of the Argonaute protein
family to their mRNA targets [1]. Together, miRNA
guide and the Argonaute protein form the core of the
RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes its mRNA targets primarily through its seed
sequence, nt 2 through nt 7 [2].
The RNase III enzymes Drosha and Dicer excise most
animal miRNA from long primary transcripts (primiRNA). Drosha cleaves pri-miRNA to release an
approximately 65-nt pre-miRNA; Dicer cleaves the premiRNA to liberate a miRNA/miRNA* duplex. The
duplex is then loaded into an Argonaute protein. The
geometry of the miRNA/miRNA* duplex during the
loading reaction determines the fate of each small RNA:
the miRNA binds tightly to Argonaute, with its 5′-nt
anchored in a positively charged pocket in the Mid

domain of the protein [3,4]. The miRNA* assumes the
same position as subsequent mRNA targets and is held
to the complex predominantly by seed sequence base
pairing. A seed sequence mismatch between the miRNA
and its miRNA* is believed to promote miRNA* dissociation [5,6]. A subset of Argonaute proteins can cleave the
miRNA* if it is extensively paired to the miRNA, triggering its destruction [7-10]. The orientation of the duplex
during Argonaute loading is not random: the miRNA is
usually the strand with the less stably paired 5′-end in the
duplex [11,12]. Consequently, the duplex liberated by
Dicer determines the identity of the miRNA.
miRNA sequences are diverse, and only one common
sequence motif has been identified. Most miRNA begin
with a 5′-uridine (5′-U). In plants, a 5′-U directs miRNA
to AGO1, small RNA that begin with adenosine (A) load
AGO2 and those that start with cytidine (C) load AGO5
[13-15]. Likewise, the 5′-nt of fly small RNA participates
in sorting, with a 5′-U directing small RNA toward Ago1
and a 5′-C favoring Ago2 [16-19]. In mammals, the Mid
domain of Ago2, the homolog of Drosophila Ago1, specifically recognizes a 5′-U or 5′-A [20], explaining why
miRNA tend to start with those nucleotides, but fly and
worm miRNA typically begin with 5′-U but not 5′-A.

Moreover, small RNA sorting in flies and worms also
reflects the secondary structure of the miRNA/miRNA*
duplex, with centrally paired duplexes preferentially
loaded into one Argonaute, - Ago2 in flies and RDE-1 in
worms, - and duplexes bearing a central mismatch directed toward the major miRNA-binding Argonautes, Ago1 in flies and the paralogous ALG-1/ALG-2 proteins
in worms [5,6,17-19,21-23].
We investigated the function of 5′-U in animal miRNA.
Our statistical analyses of sequencing data from flies,
worms and mice reveal that 5′-U is recognized after
miRNA/miRNA* production by Dicer cleavage of the
pre-miRNA. Our experimental results show that 5′-U
facilitates loading of miRNA while decreasing loading of
miRNA*, consistent with the view that only one of
the two strands can be assembled from a single miRNA/
miRNA* molecule. Our data support the view that 5′-U
enhances RISC assembly by a mechanism distinct from
its contribution to destabilizing base pairing at the 5′-end
of miRNA. Similarly to what has been proposed in Arabidopsis thaliana and in Homo sapiens [13,20], our
data also suggest that recognition of the first miRNA
nucleotide during loading may select against incorrectly
processed molecules bearing 5′-nt other than 5′-U.

Results and discussion
5′-U acts after miRNA processing

We used high-throughput sequencing data to examine the
5′-sequence bias of miRNA and miRNA*. miRNA are far
more likely to begin with U in flies (P value <10-15), worms
(P value <10-15) or mice (P value = 1.1 × 10-14) than would
be expected from their general nucleotide composition
(Figure 1, Additional file 1, Figure S1, and Additional file
2, Figure S2). Conversely, miRNA* were less likely than
expected to begin with U in flies (P value = 0.0029),
worms (P value = 0.017) or mice (P value = 0.0020).
In theory, a 5′-U might facilitate Drosha cleavage of
the pri-miRNA or pre-miRNA export from the nucleus.
Such a role for a 5′-U would be reflected in a greater
likelihood of both miRNA and miRNA* derived from
the 5′-arm of the pre-miRNA stem to begin with U
compared to those residing in the 3′ arm. We compared
the approximately 40% of fly, 35% of worm and 50% of
mouse miRNA that reside in the 5′-arm of their premiRNA to their 3′ counterparts. Our analysis argues
against a role for a 5′-U in Drosha processing or nuclear
export. miRNA tend to start with a U, regardless of
their position in the pre-miRNA (Figure 1, Additional
file 1, Figure S1, and Additional file 2, Figure S2). Moreover, miRNA* sequences tend not to begin with U, even
when they derive from the pre-miRNA 5′-arm. Our data
similarly exclude a role for a 5′-U in cleavage of the
pre-miRNA by Dicer, which would favor a 5′-U for
miRNA and miRNA* derived from the 3′-arm.

miRNA asymmetry correlates with first nucleotide identity

To test whether 5′-U plays a role in assembling a
miRNA into RISC, we separately evaluated the 5′-nt frequencies in flies of highly asymmetric duplexes
(miRNA/miRNA* ≥10; 79 duplexes), moderately
asymmetric duplexes (2 < miRNA/miRNA* < 10; 33
duplexes) and quasisymmetric duplexes (miRNA/
miRNA* < 2; 10 duplexes). If the identity of the 5′-nt
affects miRNA loading, then the most asymmetric
miRNA should exhibit a higher 5′-U bias than the least
asymmetric miRNA. Indeed, the most highly asymmetric
miRNA have a higher frequency of 5′-U (79%) than
moderately asymmetric miRNA (61%) or quasisymmetric miRNA and miRNA* (32%) (Figure 2), which is
in line with the previously published observation that
the most asymmetric human miRNA tend to be richer
in 5′-U [24]. Moreover, miRNA* strands from highly
asymmetric duplexes have a significantly lower frequency of 5′-U (16.5%) than those from moderately
asymmetric or quasisymmetric duplexes. In fact,
miRNA* strands have a significantly lower frequency of
U at their 5′-ends than across their entire sequence,
while the frequency of an initial U was indistinguishable
from the overall U frequency in miRNA* from moderately asymmetric or quasisymmetric duplexes.
Strikingly, the most asymmetric miRNA also exhibit a
lower than expected frequency of 5′-A (Figure 2, top
left), whereas the thermodynamic stability rule would
have predicted a high frequency of both U and A. This
observation suggests that 5′-nt identity, not just thermodynamic asymmetry, contributes to the differential loading of miRNA and miRNA* in vivo.
Initial nucleotide identity influences miRNA loading in
vitro

Several studies have proposed that a U at the 5′-end of a
small RNA directly promotes its loading into Ago1 in
flies [18,19,25,26]. We measured the effect of initial
nucleotide identity on the efficiency of loading of the
miR-2a/miR-2a-1* duplex in Drosophila embryo lysate.
To avoid altering the thermodynamic stability of the 5′ends of the duplex, we designed them so that changing
the 5′-nt preserved the pattern and strength of base
pairing. To measure the association of miR-2a and
miR-2a-1* with mature RISC, we assembled RISC in
Drosophila embryo lysate using a duplex in which one
strand was 5′- 32 P-radiolabeled, then captured the
radiolabeled strand using a complementary 2′-O-methyl
oligonucleotide tethered to a magnetic bead (Figure 3).
Labeling either the miRNA or the miRNA* strand (always
capturing RISC with an oligonucleotide complementary to
the labeled strand), we were able to quantify precisely both
miRNA and miRNA* loading by scintillation counting.

Figure 1 Fly miRNA tend to start with U. Each miRNA or miRNA* isoform derived from a common pre-miRNA was weighted according to its
abundance in the pooled deep-sequencing libraries, and the sequence composition analyses for all small RNA from different pre-miRNA that
were read at least 100 times in the pooled libraries were weighted equally. Gray, nucleotide frequency at position 1; white, 100 sets of
nucleotides randomly selected from nt 1-18 of the miRNA and miRNA* species to assess the overall nucleotide composition of miRNA and
miRNA*. Each random set had the same size as the corresponding set of miRNA or miRNA* 5′-nt. P values measure the probability of picking a
random set from nt 1-18 with the same nucleotide frequency as the actual set of 5′-nt.

experiments demonstrated that the amount of radioactivity captured minus the amount recovered when the duplex
was incubated with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-inactivated
lysate reflected the amount of single-stranded miRNA or

miRNA* produced by assembly of Ago1 RISC (Additional
file 3, Figure S3, and Additional file 4, Figure S4).
Both authentic miR-2a and miR-2a-1* begin with U;
the 5′-U of miR-2a is paired to A19 of miR-2a-1*.

Figure 2 Fly miRNA asymmetry correlates with the identity of the first nucleotide of the small RNA. miRNA/miRNA* duplexes were
binned according to their asymmetry: highly asymmetric, miRNA/miRNA* ≥10 in the pooled deep-sequencing libraries; moderately asymmetric,
10 > miRNA/miRNA* ≥ 2; quasisymmetric: miRNA/miRNA* <2; and analyzed as in Figure 1.

Inverting this U:A base pair so that miR-2a began with
A nearly halved the amount of miRNA assembled into
RISC and more than doubled the amount of miR-2a-1*
(Figure 3A). Thus, a change in the identity of the first
nucleotide of the miRNA decreased the efficiency of
assembly of the miRNA into RISC and increased assembly of the miRNA* while preserving the relative thermodynamic asymmetry of the duplex.
When the initial U:A base pair of miR-2a/miR-2a-1*
was altered, UU assembled more miRNA into RISC

than did AA (Figure 3B). Notably, an AA mismatch at
the 5′-end of the miRNA more than doubled the
amount of miRNA* incorporated into RISC. Next, we
examined a series of miR-2a/miR-2a* derivatives in
which the 19th base of miR-2a* was always C, ensuring
that duplex stability was the same when the miRNA
began with U or A. Again, a 5′-U favored miRNA loading and disfavored miRNA* loading (Figure 3C). When
the 5′-U was replaced with inosine, which can pair to
the miRNA* C at position 19, only slightly less miRNA

Figure 3 Identity of the first miRNA nucleotide affects duplex asymmetry. RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) loading of miRNA and
miRNA* strands was measured after in vitro assembly. Data are reported as means ± standard deviation for three independent replicate
experiments. (A) Swapping the terminal uridine:adenosine (U:A) pair of the miR-2a/miR-2a-1* duplex decreased miRNA loading and increased
miRNA* loading. (B) The effect of the terminal A:U pair mainly reflects the identity of the first miRNA nucleotide, which affects both miRNA and
miRNA* loading (C), whereas the identity of the facing miRNA* nucleotide has no detectable effect (D).

was assembled into RISC than that observed for an A/C
mismatch. We conclude that the identity of the first
miRNA nucleotide contributes more to the loading of
miR-2a than do differences in the stability of the duplex
termini. Reciprocally, when the first miRNA nucleotide
was C, the identity of miRNA* nt 19 did not have any significant effect on miRNA or miRNA* loading (Figure 3D),
demonstrating that the effect shown in Figure 3A reflects
a mutation of the first miRNA nucleotide, not the change
in miRNA* nt 19. Experiments using miR-14 and miR-184
gave similar results (Additional file 5, Figure S5).
Strikingly, the order of preference for nt 1 was not the
same across the three tested miRNA: miR-2a preferred U >
A > C (Figure 3), miR-14 preferred U ~ C > A and miR184 preferred U ~ A > C (Additional file 6, Figure S6).
Hence additional features in the miRNA/miRNA* duplex
must influence the order of preference for miRNA nt 1.
Mutating the overhanging nucleotide in miR-184* did not
alter the efficiency of loading miR-184 (Additional file 7,
Figure S7), excluding a role for base pairing between nt 1
and the 3′ overhang of the miRNA*.

Covarying features in miRNA/miRNA* duplexes suggest
that the identity of nt 2 affects the order of preference
for miRNA nt 1

If a sequence or structural feature affects the order of
preference for nt 1, then these two features should
evolve together. We searched for significant covariation
between nt 1 identity and other sequence or structural
motifs in miRNA/miRNA* duplexes. For Drosophila
miRNA/miRNA*, the identity of miRNA nt 1 covaries
with the identity of the facing nucleotide on the
miRNA* strand, the identity of the second nucleotide of
the miRNA strand and the base-pairing status of the
15th nucleotide of the miRNA strand (Figure 4A).
Mutating miRNA nt 2 in miR-2a and miR-184 influenced the order of preference for nt 1 in flies (Figures
4B and 4C).
Strikingly, the influence of nt 2 on nt 1 seems to be
specific for flies. Neither worm nor mouse miRNA/
miRNA* show such covariation (Additional file 8, Figure
S8). Caenorhabditis elegans miRNA nt 1 covaries mostly
with the base-pairing status of miRNA nt 18 and the

the significance (Fisher’s exact test) of observed covariation between the identity of miRNA nt 1 and nucleotide identity (black) or base-pairing

correlates strongly with itself. (B and C) Mutating nt 2 in miR-2a (B) or miR-184 (C) changed the order of nt 1 preference for miRNA loading.

identity of the miRNA* nucleotide facing miRNA nt 3.
In mouse, nt 1 covaries with the identity of miRNA nt
12 as well as several positions at the 3′ end of the
miRNA strand. The sequence composition of miRNA
differs greatly between flies and humans [24], suggesting
that the nucleotide preference of the miRNA loading
machinery has evolved since the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes, with only the overall tendency for miRNA to start with U remaining conserved.

Conclusions
Our data support the view that a U at the 5′-end of a
miRNA favors RISC loading in flies and, given both our
informatics data and the broad phylogenetic conservation of the 5′-U bias among miRNA in worms and mice,
likely in animals generally.
The Drosophila Ago1 loading machinery remains to
be identified, although chaperones have been implicated
in assembling miRNA into RISC [6,27,28]. It is tempting
to speculate that the requirement for the miRNA 5′-end
to be the less thermodynamically stable in a miRNA/
miRNA* duplex reflects the need for the first nucleotide
to be single-stranded to present it to components of the
RISC loading machinery or to Ago1 itself.
Why has the miRNA pathway evolved to prefer a 5′U? The likely answer is that preferential loading of
miRNA starting with U improves the precision of the
miRNA 5′-end [13]. Drosha and Dicer generate pools of
miRNA/miRNA* duplexes with alternative 5′- and 3′ends; loading of these duplexes into Drosophila Ago2,
-which prefers 5′-C, - has been shown to purify this
population of miRNA [29], loading preferentially the
miRNA isoforms bearing a 5′-C [19,25]. The preference
of the Ago1 loading machinery or of Ago1 itself for 5′U could similarly restrict entry into the Ago1 pathway
by loading only miRNA isoforms that begin with U.
Consistent with this idea, the pre-miRNA nucleotides
flanking miRNA nt 1 tend to be depleted in U (Additional file 9, Figure S9). Such a purifying selection could
ensure that most mature miRNA have the correct 5′end and therefore the correct seed sequence, ensuring
that they regulate the appropriate mRNA targets.
Methods
In vitro reconstitution of miRNA/miRNA* loading 5′
phosphorylated miRNA/miRNA* (approximately 20 nM;
the strand measured was 32 P-radiolabeled) was incubated with zero- to two-hour fly embryo lysate for one
hour at 25°C [30]. Assembly was stopped with NEM [7].

miRNA with ≥100 reads in the pooled deep-sequencing
libraries were selected (see Table 2 for the list of analyzed deep-sequencing libraries). The most abundant
isoform of each strand was retained. We evaluated the
identity and base-pairing status (using RNAcofold, part
of the Vienna RNA Secondary Structure Package;

Datasets were obtained from the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Reads (18 to 30 nt) matching known miRNA or miRNA sequences were
identified, tolerating up to 9 nt between the observed extremities and the 5′ and 3′ extremities described in miRBase version 14. Overall, the fly libraries
contained 100,603,194 miRNA and 6,569,021 miRNA* reads, the worm libraries contained 14,479,717 miRNA and 1,124,773 miRNA* reads and the mouse libraries
contained 3,416,073 miRNA and 143,617 miRNA* reads.

Additional file 5: Figure S5. Identity of miRNA nucleotide 1 affects
duplex asymmetry. (A) Changing the 5′-uridine (5′-U) of miR-14 to 5′adenosine (5′-A) decreased miRNA loading. (B) Changing the 5′-U of
miR-184 into 5′-cytidine (5′-C) decreased miRNA loading; mutating it to
ribothymidine increased miRNA loading. Changing the 5′-nt of miR-2a
(C) or miR-184 (D) into 5′-guanidine (5′-G) decreases miRNA loading
(relatively to a 5′-A).
Additional file 6: Figure S6. Duplex-specific order of preference on
the identity of the first nucleotide. (A) Regardless of the identity of
the facing (p19*) nucleotide, miR-2a is better loaded if it starts with a U
than if it starts with an A than if it starts with a C (U > A > C). (B) miR-14
is better loaded if it starts with a U or a C than if it starts with an A (U ~
C > A). (C) miR-184 is better loaded if it starts with a ribothymidine than
if it starts with a U or an A than if it starts with a C (T > U ~ A > C).
Additional file 7: Figure S7. The sequence of the miRNA* 3′
overhang is not responsible for miRNA-specific preferences for nt 1.
The modest effect of the identity of the miRNA* 3′-most nucleotide does
not correlate with the base-pairing ability of miRNA nt 1 to the miRNA*
3′ terminus.
Additional file 8: Figure S8. Structure and sequence features
covarying with the identity of miRNA nt 1 in C. elegans and mouse.
See Figure 4A legend for details. (A) Covariation in Mus musculus miRNA/
miRNA* duplexes. (B) Covariation in C. elegans miRNA/miRNA* duplexes.
Additional file 9: Figure S9. Pre-miRNA nucleotides flanking miRNA
nt 1 are depleted of U. U frequency was measured in pre-miRNA
covered by at least 100 reads in the pooled deep-sequencing libraries.
The 5′-most nucleotide of mature miRNA is enriched in U (position 0 on
the x-axis), while its flanking nucleotides are depleted. The horizontal line
indicates the mean U frequency in 100 random sets of nucleotides
picked from the corresponding 21-nt segment in the analyzed premiRNA. Dashed lines indicate 95% confidence intervals.
