Abstract
Background: A resequencing microarray called PathogenID v2.0 has been developed and used to explore various
strategies of sequence selection for its design. The part dedicated to influenza viruses was based on consensus
sequences specific for one gene generated from global alignments of a large number of influenza virus sequences
available in databanks.
Results: For each HA (H1, H2, H3, H5, H7 and H9) and NA (N1, N2 and N7) molecular type chosen to be tested, 1
to 3 consensus sequences were computed and tiled on the microarray. A total of 12 influenza virus samples from
different host origins (humans, pigs, horses and birds) and isolated over a period of about 50 years were used in
this study. Influenza viruses were correctly identified, and in most cases with the accurate information of the time
of their emergence.
Conclusions: PathogenID v2.0 microarray demonstrated its ability to type and subtype influenza viruses, often to
the level of viral variants, with a minimum number of tiled sequences. This validated the strategy of using
consensus sequences, which do not exist in nature, for our microarray design. The versatility, rapidity and high
discriminatory power of the PathogenID v2.0 microarray could prove critical to detect and identify viral genome
reassortment events resulting in a novel virus with epidemic or pandemic potential and therefore assist health
authorities to make efficient decisions about patient treatment and outbreak management.

Background
Rapid detection and identification of infectious pathogens are necessary for proper treatment of infection and
outbreak control measures.
Many promising approaches are being developed
enabling rapid identification of various infectious pathogens such as bacteria or viruses including multiplex
(RT)-PCR amplification strategies or novel technologies
such as high-performance electrospray ionization mass
spectrometry [1,2].
DNA microarray technologies provide a mean to
screen for thousands of different nucleic acid sequences
simultaneously and have been used for the detection of

many viruses such as HIV [3], Hepatitis B and D viruses
[4-6], human papillomaviruses [7], rotaviruses [8], vaccinia virus [9], herpesviruses, enteroviruses, flaviviruses
[10], and measles virus genotypes [11]. In addition to
these microarrays, which have a spectrum of identification limited to a few viral species, major microarray
platforms were developed for the detection of a much
broader range of pathogens [12-17].
In humans, influenza A viruses cause recurrent annual
epidemics of moderate to severe respiratory diseases.
Sixteen hemagglutinin (HA) molecular types (designated
H1 to H16) and nine neuraminidase (NA) molecular
types (designated N1 to N9) have been identified,
although only a few of them occur in viruses causing
human diseases. Identification and selection of
sequences to be used on a microarray are particularly
challenging, especially for rapidly mutating viruses. Antigenic drift is an ongoing process for influenza A viruses

resulting in continuous evolution and annual epidemics.
Moreover, the segmented nature of the influenza A
virus genome can lead to reassortments during coinfection thus contributing to their vast genetic diversity and
pandemic potential.
Subtyping and molecular analysis of influenza virus
strains were performed by different groups using low
density microarrays [18-23]. Most of them were used to
identify influenza A viruses H1N1, H3N2, H5N1 and
influenza B viruses. Recently, Combimatrix Corporation
(Mukilteo, WA) developed a semiconductor-based
microarray and an integrated microfluidic array enabling
the detection of 15 HA and 9 NA [24,25]. However, the
cost per microarray is too high for routine experimental
identification. More recently, a rapid subtyping assay
also identifying all the HA and NA subtypes was developed using padlock probes [2].
Resequencing, using high-density oligonucleotide
microarrays, is a technology that enables the rapid identification of genetic variants and the determination of
their nucleotide sequence at single base-pair resolution.
This allows identification of pathogens with sequences
similar but not identical to those represented on the
microarray. A resequencing microarray was designed in
order to allow identification of genetically diverse
human RNA rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, with a
minimum number of prototype 5’UTR sequences [26].
One respiratory pathogen resequencing microarray
allowed the detection of geographically distant human
H1N1, H3N2 and avian H5N1 influenza virus strains
covering the period between 1999 and 2005 [27,28].
More recently, the same team developed a broad-range
resequencing microarray for universal detection and
identification of all the possible combinations of the 16
hemagglutinin and 9 neuraminidase types of avian influenza viruses in addition to three additional influenza A
markers (M, PB2 and NS1) [29]. Their strategy was
based on probe sequence selection using in silico modeling [30].
A resequencing microarray called PathogenID v2.0 has
been developed by a consortium of laboratories of Institut Pasteur with Affymetrix Inc. It was used to explore
various strategies of sequence selection for its design.
The part dedicated to influenza viruses, presented here,
was based on consensus sequences specific for one gene.
Within the global program, another strategy was
explored for the part of the microarray specific for rhabdoviruses. That strategy was based on the use of prototype sequences representative of each of the seven
species described in the genus Lyssavirus and chosen
within a conserved region of the polymerase gene [31].
Consensus sequences generation was a posteriori used
to analyse results. Our strategy presented in this study,
uses consensus sequences generated from nucleotide

sequence alignments to determine the sequences to be
tiled. These sequences characterised by a minimum size
of 200 bp reduce the number of probes required for tiling yet still covering the wide diversity of influenza virus
strains. To validate our approach, influenza viruses from
different host origins, isolated over a period of about 50
years, were chosen. The DNA microarray not only
demonstrated its ability to identify the type and subtype
of influenza viruses but also had a strong discriminatory
power at the level of viral variants.

Results and Discussion
Microarray design

The aim of the study was to detect influenza A viruses
isolated over a long period of time, from a range of
hosts (humans, birds, horses, and pigs) and with a minimum of sequences tiled on the array. Four genes including PB2, M, HA and NA were chosen in order to type
and subtype influenza viruses. Different strategies for
selecting the region to resequence were adopted
depending on the particular gene. Characteristics of the
sequences tiled on the microarray are detailed in Table
1. Firstly, one partially conserved sequence of 218 bp
covering the majority of influenza M segments, routinely
employed in medical diagnostics, was used for genus
identification, namely Influenzavirus A, B and C. Secondly, almost one hundred sequences of PB2 genes covering a large spectrum of influenza A viruses and hosts
were selected from the GenBank database. Five typical
PB2 sequences representative of the diversity of PB2
sequences over a long period of time and for different
host reservoirs were finally retained. The five selected
sequences are described in Table 1. The strategy
adopted for the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA) genes involved the design of consensus
sequences for the H1, H2, H3, H5, H7 and H9 genes
and the N1, N2 and N7 genes. We have restricted the
number of studied molecular subtypes of HA and NA in
order to make the confirmation of our hypothesis more
straightforward and demonstrative without aiming to
cover the whole set of serotypes. The HA and NA subtypes chosen to be tiled on the microarray are shared by
all the human viruses and highly pathogenic avian
viruses, and the HAs are further distributed into phylogenetic groups that gather all the 16 serotypes [32]. For
each major HA and NA gene, sequences of influenza A
virus were selected from different hosts including
horses, pigs, humans and birds.
For each gene, a global alignment including all
selected sequences was performed and clusters grouping
a maximum number of sequences were established. In
each sequence cluster, a common region with the lowest
genetic divergence was identified. A consensus sequence
was automatically obtained from this common region,

characterised by a minimum size of 200 bases and a
divergence between the consensus sequence and any
given sequence belonging to the cluster of less than
15%. Twelve HA consensus sequences and 9 NA consensus sequences were identified and their positions are
detailed in Table 1. Finally, the microarray based on the
resequencing approach included 27 influenza viral
sequences which corresponded to 7594 bases. For each
relevant base of a given consensus or prototype
sequence, the array contained eight 25 mer probes (4
sense and 4 antisense). Two of the eight probes represented perfect matches, while the others corresponded
to possible mismatches at the central (13th) position of
the 25 mers. All together, 60752 probes were then tiled
on the microarray, allowing subtyping of influenza
viruses from different host species.
Detection of type A influenza viruses

A total of 12 influenza virus samples were analysed by
the resequencing microarray, including 2 swine, 3
human, 4 equine and 3 avian strains that originated

from various locations worldwide and covered the period of time between 1956 and 2007. All samples were
viral isolates, propagated either in embryonated chicken
eggs or in MDCK cell cultures. They were chosen from
sufficiently distant points in time to cover a large diversity of influenza viruses, especially for human and swine
viruses, which were subject to major antigenic drift over
the years. Avian strains were derived from cloacal samples collected from ducks in Baie de Somme, Marquenterre (France) in 2007. RNA extracts were amplified by
WTA (Whole Transcriptome Amplification) and hybridised on the resequencing microarray (see Methods section). Results are summarised in Table 2. Nucleotide
sequences were determined from the fluorescent signals
as previously described [33] and compared with
sequences in GenBank by BLASTN analysis, to identify
and subtype influenza virus strains. Results for the highest hit scores were taken as strain identification. After
hybridisation of WTA amplified material on the DNA
microarray, all samples were positive for the presence of
influenza A virus with a minimum call rate of 41% for

for the PB2 gene, which is the percentage of bases
determined by the resequencing algorithm. Subtypes of
the different strains were identified with HA and NA
sequences, giving a call rate ranging from 48.5% to
100%. Time ranges were obtained from BLASTN analysis. The sequences showing the highest alignment score
were considered and duplicated sequences representing
different isolates of the same strain were eliminated.
The time range indicated the oldest isolate with high

homology provided by the BLASTN algorithm and the
most recent one. The median was calculated based
upon the sequences showing the highest alignment
scores (see Methods section).
For swine and human viruses, a minimum call rate of
35.5% allowed identification of influenza virus with a
correct temporality. Indeed, for the majority of strains
the BLASTN result was close to that of the sample
strain, as outlined by median analysis. The median
obtained for the NA gene from the A/Johannesburg/33/

94 (H3N2) virus was relatively recent compared to the
year of isolation of the strain, probably because the chosen consensus sequence for this gene was highly conserved and thus weakly discriminatory. The time range
obtained for the A/Wyoming/3/2003 (H3N2) virus was
narrow and limited to the year 2000, probably due to
the marked antigenic drift from the year 2000 observed
for the H3 gene in human influenza virus strains [34].
The epidemiology of swine influenza has become
increasingly complex over the last decades. Three major
influenza A virus subtypes are currently circulating in
swine worldwide, but the origins and the antigenic and
genetic characteristics of these swine influenza viruses
differ with continents or regions of the world. A/swine/
Gent/7625/99 (H1N2) virus is the result of a multiple
reassortment involving a swine influenza virus with
avian-influenza-like internal segments and human H1N1
and H3N2 viruses isolated in 1994 [35]. BLASTN analysis
for H1N2 swine virus reflected this multiple reassortment
with blasted sequences originating from human, avian
and swine hosts (data not shown). Between 1983 and
1985, swine H3N2 viruses appeared in Italy. They contained avian-like internal genes and HA and NA genes
from human H3N2 viruses [36]. In BLASTN analysis, the
vast majority of the sequences sorted by the algorithm
for glycoprotein segments were from human or swine
origins only. All equine influenza virus strains were identified and subtyped with the DNA microarray, with a
minimum call rate of 48.5%. Medians were often heterogeneous and far from the original strain. This is probably
due to (i) the paucity of equine influenza virus sequences
available in the databases, (ii) the limited genetic evolution of those viruses leading to equivalent result scores
after BLASTN analysis, (iii) the fact that HA and NA
sequences tiled on the microarray were shorter than PB2
sequences, due to their extreme genetic diversity in influenza A viruses. For the H3N8 viruses, recent sequences
corresponded to avian strains, outlining the fact that
H3N8 equine viruses were reassortants between avian
viruses and equine H7N7 viruses which have not been
isolated in horses for more than 20 years.
All together, the results showed that the PathogenID
v2.0 DNA microarray is able not only to provide correct
full subtyping of various strains from different host origins
but also to identify/detect, after BLASTN, an array of
strains genetically related to them. In all cases, the strains
output by BLASTN belonged to the same time period
thus giving a strong insight into the variant to which it is
genetically, and very probably antigenically, related.
Avian samples

Cloacal samples were collected from ducks in Baie de
Somme, Marquenterre (France) in 2007 and analysed by
qRT-PCR specific for the M gene. WTA amplification

of viral RNA followed by hybridisation to the DNA
microarray confirmed the identification of influenza
viruses. Two samples were identified as H1N1 viruses
and one sample as H3N2 virus. Influenza virus strain
221 was identified as H3N2 virus with a call rate of
84.7% for one of the H3 consensus sequences and 99.4%
for one of the N2 consensus sequences. Influenza virus
strains 223 and 224 were both identified as H1N1 virus
with call rates of 90.7% and 94.9% for the N1 gene and
call rates of 66.5% and 81.8% for the H1 gene, respectively (see Table 2). In order to confirm subtyping of the
different viruses, primers were designed based upon
resequencing sequences reconstructed by the microarray
and used for RT-PCR (see additional file 1). Amplified
products were cloned and analysed by classical sequencing. Sequencing results confirmed the subtyping by the
DNA microarray of the 3 viral strains isolated from
cloacal samples. Time ranges showed that the viral
strains isolated in the environment are recent, except
for the H1 gene of strain 223 (Table 2). The evolutionary rate of influenza viruses in the natural avian host is
believed to be slower than in mammals, and this could
explain the above result. Sequences were analysed with
the BLASTN program and results with highest scores
are represented in Table 3. The majority of the “classical” sequences were identical to those found after
BLASTN analysis of sequences generated by the DNA
microarray. The level of sequence information generated
by the DNA resequencing microarray is sufficient and
equivalent to that obtained by classical sequencing.

Conclusions
The PathogenID v2.0 microarray demonstrated its ability
to type and subtype influenza viruses with a minimum
number of tiled sequences and to give additional information close to the individual variant level. Identification of influenza viruses was obtained within the correct
period of time in most cases. However, this level of discrimination is limited by the number of sequences available in databases and their level of divergence as
illustrated by results obtained with equine viruses. The
PathogenID v2.0 microarray should also be able to
detect a re-emerging influenza virus, that has already
circulated in the population, as happened in 1977 during
the Russian influenza outbreak [37].
BLASTN analysis of the sequences generated by the
DNA microarray should allow the determination of the
segment origin for PB2, HA and NA genes, even though
the consensus sequence design was not based on the
origin of the viral host. The avian H3N2 virus isolated
from the environment was identified and characterised
as having an H3 consensus sequence different from that
obtained for human H3N2 viruses. Recently, we have
tested the novel human A(H1N1) pandemic virus of

swine origin, derived from multiple reassortments, with
the DNA microarray and BLASTN analysis determined
the segment origin for the PB2, H1 and N1 genes,
which were derived from avian, classical swine virus and
avian-like swine virus, respectively [38]. Our data validated the strategy of using consensus sequences with all
of the serotypes tested, including H1, H3, H7 (this
paper) and H5 [38] (H9 and H2 were not tested,
because not available in the laboratory) and N1, N2 and
N7 (this paper). The simple design strategy used in this
study, based on global alignements covering the whole
gene, does not need the use of a specific algorithm as
the one used for the TessArray RPM-Flu resequencing
microarray which was based on probe sequence selection [29]. The consensus sequences which allowed to
considerably limiting the number of probes tiled on the
non-specialised PathogenID v2.0 microarray would allow
the determination of differential diagnosis with other
respiratory viruses such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus
(RSV), SARS-CoV, and also potential co-infections,
which is not possible with microarrays entirely dedicated
to influenza viruses. The use of WTA amplification provides considerably better sensitivity and accuracy of
detection compared to random RT-PCR [14] which is
compatible with the use of the PathogenID v2.0 resequencing microarray for clinical samples. Furthermore,
the use of random hexamers and multiple displacement
amplification allowed detection of a new virus which
can not be amplified with usual specific primers as
shown by the study on the last novel H1N1pdm virus
responsible for 2009 influenza pandemic [38]. However,
the DNA microarray failed to detect the N8 gene from
H3N8 equine viruses. Here, it will be useful to tile other
genes on the next generation microarray, including all
HA and NA subtypes or the PB1 gene, which has often

been involved in reassortment in past pandemics. In this
way, one could detect as many reassortants as possible
thereby impacting on public health measures.

Methods
Microarray design

From many available influenza virus sequences, genespecific databases containing only the sequences of a
specific gene or subtype (e.g., PB2 or H1 subtype) were
created and converted to the FASTA format. Then, a
multiple-sequence alignment was performed with the
data set with BioNumerics software for windows (version 5.1, Applied Maths). Additionally, a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was created. Consensus sequences
were then designed based upon global alignments of
this large number of influenza virus sequences available
in databanks.
Virus samples

Influenza virus samples were all viral isolates propagated
either in embryonated chicken eggs or in MDCK cell
cultures. The virus type was determined by hemagglutination inhibition assay [39].
Cloacal samples collected from ducks in Baie de
Somme, Marquenterre (France) were inoculated via the
allantoic route on 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs.
Eggs were incubated at 35°C and allantoic fluids were
harvested on day 3 postinfection. Virus titration of the
fluids was performed by hemagglutination by using guinea pig erythrocytes. Influenza virus isolation was confirmed by qRT-PCR specific for the M gene.
RNA isolation and amplification

Viral RNA from influenza samples and allantoic fluids
were extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/586

(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Nucleic acid amplification was performed by WTA as
described previously [14].
Hybridisation to microarrays

DNA amounts obtained after amplification were quantified by Quantit (Invitrogen(r)). Five micrograms of DNA
was fragmented (GeneChip(r) Resequencing Assay Kit,
Affymetrix Inc.) and labelled according to the GeneChip
(r) Mapping 100K Assay Manual (Affymetrix Inc.).
Microarray hybridisation was conducted at 45°C and
array processing was carried out according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Affymetrix Inc.)
as previously described [40].
Analysis of the sequences generated by the The
PathogenID v2.0 microarray

After hybridisation to the DNA microarray, the nucleotide sequences of the different genes were determined
from the signals as described previously [33] and compared with sequences in GenBank by BLASTN analysis.
All sequences generated by the microarray were characterised by the call rate, which is the percentage of bases
determined by the resequencing algorithm. For determining the time of emergence of the sample strain, median
analysis was performed as described: the sequence generated by the microarray showing the highest call rate value
was blasted against sequences available in Genbank using
the BLASTN 2.2.24+ program [41]. All homologous
sequences within the group of sequences showing the
highest score (as categorised by the BLASTN program)
were selected and their year of circulation used for median
calculation and determination of the time range. If the
number of these sequences was higher than 100, median
analysis was performed on the 100 first sequences only.
For avian influenza strains, median analysis was performed
as described above and the first sequence(s) showing the
highest scores were also detailed in Table 3.
RT-PCR, cloning and sequencing

After identification and subtyping of avian influenza
strains by the microarray, oligonucleotides specific for
each tiled influenza virus gene were designed and used
in RT-PCR assays. Five microliters of extracted RNA
was amplified by SuperScript(tm) One-Step RT-PCR
system with Platinum(r) Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). One-Step RTPCR was performed with 25 μl reaction volume. The
extracted RNA sample (5 μl) was added to RT-PCR
mixture (20 μl) consisting of 1X Reaction Mix (a buffer
containing 0.4 mM of each dNTP, 2.4 mM MgSO 4 ),
0.5 μl of SuperScript(tm) II RT/Platinum(r) Taq Mix,
0.4 μM primer Forward, 0.4 μM primer Reverse, 0.2 U/
μl of RNaseOUT Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor

and nuclease-free water. The RT and PCR were carried
out with following steps: RT at 45°C for 30 min; 55°C
for 15 min, 94°C for 5 min, then PCR cycle 1-30, 94°C
for 30 sec, 45°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 30 sec; final extension, 72°C for 5 min.
Amplified products were extracted using QIAquick Gel
Extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and cloned in pCR(r)II.1-TOPO(r) TA cloning
vector (Invitrogen). Sequences of influenza virus genes
were obtained from 3 individual clones for each gene.
