Abstract
Background: Abiotrophia and Granulicatella species, previously referred to as nutritionally variant
streptococci (NVS), are significant causative agents of endocarditis and bacteraemia. In this study,
we reviewed the clinical manifestations of infections due to A. defectiva and Granulicatella species
that occurred at our institution between 1998 and 2004.
Methods: The analysis included all strains of NVS that were isolated from blood cultures or
vascular graft specimens. All strains were identified by 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Patients'
medical charts were reviewed for each case of infection.
Results: Eleven strains of NVS were isolated during the 6-year period. Identification of the strains
by 16S rRNA showed 2 genogroups: Abiotrophia defectiva (3) and Granulicatella adiacens (6) or "paraadiacens" (2). The three A. defectiva strains were isolated from immunocompetent patients with
endovascular infections, whereas 7 of 8 Granulicatella spp. strains were isolated from
immunosuppressed patients, mainly febrile neutropenic patients. We report the first case of "G.
para-adiacens" bacteraemia in the setting of febrile neutropenia.
Conclusion: We propose that Granulicatella spp. be considered as a possible agent of bacteraemia
in neutropenic patients.

Background
Nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS), first described in
1961 by Frenkel and Hirsch [1], were classified on the
basis of growth characteristics such as nutrient requirements (pyridoxal) and presence of satellitism. In 1989,
based on DNA-DNA hybridisation, Bouvet et al. showed
that NVS could be divided in two groups, Streptococcus
defectivus and Streptococcus adiacens [2]. In 1995, based on

the genetic and phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA
sequences, the genus Abiotrophia and the two species A.
defectiva and A. adiacens were proposed by Kawamura [3].
In 1998, Roggenkamp et al. proposed the new species A.
elegans [4], and in 1999, Lawson et al. proposed the species A. balaenopterae [5]. Based on 16S rRNA heterogeneity
and phenotypic differences, Kanamoto et al. proposed an
additional species "Abiotrophia para-adiacens" [6]. In 2000,

trophia and Granulicatella may pose a challenge to treat
invasive infections [26-28].

Abiotrophia and Granulicatella species form part of the normal flora of the oral cavity [8-10], the genitourinary tract,
and the intestinal tract [11]. G. adiacens is isolated more
frequently from oral specimens than other NVS [4,9,10].
Bacteraemia and endocarditis are the more frequently
reported clinical infections due to Abiotrophia and Granulicatella species [12] and account for 4.3 to 6% of all
"streptococcal" endocarditis [13]. Isolated cases of keratitis [14], endophthalmitis [15], central nervous system
infections [16-20], sinusitis, otitis media, prostatitis,
cholangitis, arthritis [21-23] and osteomyelitis [24,25]
have also been reported. The high prevalence of betalactam and macrolide resistance among isolates of Abio-

In this study, we reviewed the clinical manifestations of
infections due to A. defectiva and Granulicatella species
that occurred at our institution over a 6-year period.

Methods
Bacterial strains
The analysis included all strains of NVS that were isolated
from blood cultures or vascular graft specimens from
patients admitted to our 800-bed University Hospital
from January 1998 to December 2004. The automated
blood culture system used in the microbiology laboratory
during the study period was the Bactec 9240 (Becton
Dickinson, Sparks, Md.) with the Plus aerobic/F and Lytic

anaerobic/F vials (Becton Dickinson). The strains were
identified to the species level using the Rapid ID32
STREPT system (Bio Mérieux SA, Marcy-l'Etoile, France).
16S rRNA gene sequencing
All strains were also identified by 16S rRNA sequence
analysis. DNA was extracted with the MagNA Pure LC
DNA isolation Kit I (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the 16S
RNA gene was performed with primers fD1 and rP2 [29]
and Taq DNA polymerase (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies)
followed by electrophoresis of the PCR products on ethidium bromide-stained 1% agarose gel. PCR products were
purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen,
Courtaboeuf, France). Sequencing was performed by
using the dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Ready Reaction kit with one of six different primers and
AmpliTaq DNA (Perkin-Elmer Biosystems, Warrington,
England) with a 3100 ABI Prism automated sequencer
(Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France). Sequences
derived from each primer were aligned and combined
into a single 16S rRNA sequence by using Contig Express,
a component of the Vector NTI suite 9.0 (Informax, Frederick, MD). Each sequence was compared with all eubacterial 16S rRNA sequences available in the GenBank
database by using the BLASTN 2.2.2 program available on
the National Center for Biotechnology Information website [30,31]. The 16S rRNA sequences of Abiotrophia and
Granulicatella isolates were aligned with those of other
members of the genus Abiotrophia and Granulicatella by
using the CLUSTWAL W program supported by the DDBJ
website [32]. Sequences were edited by removal of the
longer 5' and 3' ends so that their lengths matched that of
the shortest sequence and then analysed by neighbourjoining, parsimony and minimum evolution methods
(Kimura's correction, pairwise deletion option) using the
Mega 2.1 software [33]. GenBank accession numbers are
shown in Figure 1.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of penicillin, ceftriaxone, meropenem, clarithromycin, erythromycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, levofloxacin, vancomycin
and teicoplanin were determined for each isolate by the Etest method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden), using Brucella
agar supplemented with haemin, vitamin K1, cystein and
5% sheep blood as test medium (BA). For vancomycin, an
E-test was also performed on Mueller-Hinton agar with
5% sheep blood (BMH) and 1% vitox defined supplement (Oxoid, Basel, Switzerland). Antimicrobial susceptibilities were interpreted according to the guidelines
established by the CLSI for Streptococcus spp. other than
Streptococcus pneumoniae [34].

Clinical data
The patients' medical charts were reviewed and clinical
characteristics (age, sex, clinical diagnosis, underlying
conditions, predisposing factors, antibiotic treatment and
outcome) were recorded for each case of infection due to
NVS. Neutropenia was defined as a neutrophil count of
<500 cells/mm3.
Ethics
The design of this study was in accordance with the ethical
standards of our hospital ethics committee. Because the
study was retrospective, informed consent was not
required.

Results
During the six-year study period, ten patients had positive
blood cultures for NVS and one had a positive culture of
a vascular graft fragment. All but one positive blood culture were detected within the first twenty-four hours of
incubation. The strains grew equally from both vials. All
strains showed satellitism around streaks of Staphylococcus
aureus. Seven of 11 strains were identified successfully to
the species level using the Rapid ID32 STREPT system.
Based on their 16S rRNA sequences, 3 strains were identified as A. defectiva (isolates 1–3) and 8 as Granulicatella
spp. (isolates 4–11). Isolates 1, 2 and 3 exhibited 99.6 to
99.7% 16S rRNA homology with A. defectiva strain ATCC
49176 and 92.1 to 92.4% 16S rRNA homology with G.
adiacens strain ATCC 49175. Isolates 4 to 11 exhibited
92.2 to 92.5% 16S rRNA homology with A. defectiva strain
ATCC 49176 and 99.8% 16S rRNA homology with G.
adiacens strain ATCC 49175. Two strains, isolates 7 and
10, exhibited 100% 16S rRNA homology with "G. paraadiacens" strain TKT1 [6]. The phylogenetic tree shown in
Fig. 1 demonstrates the affiliation of strains 1,2 and 3 to
the genus Abiotrophia. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed
affiliation of strains 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 11 to G. adiacens and
strains 7 and 10 to "G. para-adiacens" (Fig. 1). Strains 7
and 10 clustered with "G. para-adiacens" strain TKT1 with
bootstraps of 94%, 84% and 80% in neighbour-joining,
parsimony and minimum evolution analysis, supporting
the node separating them from their closest neighbour G.
adiacens.
According to CLSI interpretive criteria, the 3 A. defectiva
strains were susceptible to all the antibiotics tested except
1 strain with a reduced susceptibly to penicillin (MIC 0.25
µg/ml). Two Granulicatella spp. showed resistance to penicillin (MIC 4 and 8 µg/ml, respectively), and intermediate susceptibility (MIC 2 µg/ml) or resistance (MIC 8 µg/
ml) to ceftriaxone. One Granulicatella spp. was intermediately susceptible to penicillin (MIC 0.25 µg/ml) but sensitive to other beta-lactams. Two other strains were
intermediately susceptible to ceftriaxone alone (MIC 2 µg/

ml). All Granulicatella spp. strains showed vancomycin
MICs of 1.5 to 2 µg/ml and teicoplanin MICs of <0.25 µg/
ml with BA. MICs to vancomycin were lower when tested
on BMH (MIC 0.5 to 1 µg/ml). All Granulicatella spp.
strains were susceptible to meropenem, clarithromycin,
erythromycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and levofloxacin.
The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the
patients are shown in Additional file 1. Two patients with
A. defectiva infections had endocarditis, one of which also
had sacroileitis. The third patient had polymicrobial (A.
defectiva plus Escherichia coli) vascular graft infection
related to an aorto-enteric fistula.
Seven of 8 patients with bacteraemia due to Granulicatella
spp. were immunosuppressed. Underlying conditions
included haematological malignancies (5), lung cancer
(1) and advanced metastatic oesophageal cancer (1).
Three patients had polymicrobial infections (G. adiacens
plus Clostridium sordellii, Staphylococcus epidermidis or
Lactobacillus rhamnosus). Six patients presented with
febrile chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and mucositis, including one patient with possible infection of a catheter and one with possible endocarditis. One of the six
patients with neutropenia died 10 days after bacteraemia
from gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of refractory
thrombopenia. The other 5 neutropenic patients clinically
improved clinically with intravenous antibiotic therapy.
The 3 patients with primary bacteraemia due to Granulicatella spp. with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to
penicillin were successfully treated (cases 7, 10 and 11).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/6/9

One and two of 8 Granulicatella spp. strains, respectively,
showed reduced susceptibility and resistance to penicillin.
This rate of resistance is similar to the prevalence of penicillin resistance recently described [26,28]. This suggests
that antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be systematically done in order to select appropriate antimicrobial
therapy. In severely ill patients or those with a suboptimal
response to initial therapy with beta-lactam antibiotics,
treatment with vancomycin should be considered. We did
not observed therapeutic failures; the fatal outcome in
two cases was not attributed to the infection.
All Abiotrophia and Granulicatella strains were susceptible
to vancomycin. However, depending on the culture
medium used for E-test method, we observed discrepant
results. Overestimation of vancomycin E-test values have
previously been reported for Strepococci spp., when compared to values obtained with broth or agar dilution
methods [38-40]. Vancomycin E-test values should thus
be interpreted with caution.
As observed in this series, Granulicatella spp. bacteraemia
may occur in the setting of chemotherapy-associated
mucositis and neutropenia. Oro-intestinal colonisation
by Granulicatella spp. and subsequent mucositis may represent predisposing factors for bacteraemia in neutropenic
patients, as it is well documented for viridans streptococci
[41,42]. The absence of cases of bacteraemia due to A.
defectiva in neutropenic patients could reflect a lower frequency of oral colonisation by this species in comparison
to Granulicatella spp. In one study, the rates of oral colonisation in healthy students were 11.8% and 87.1% for A.
defectiva and G. adiacens, respectively [9].

Discussion
A. defectiva and Granulicatella spp. are now considered as
two distinct genera based on 16S rRNA tree topology and
sequence divergence considerations [7]. The review of
these clinical cases suggests that each species is associated
with a distinct clinical presentation: A. defectiva infections
were seen in immunocompetent patients with endovascular infections, whereas 7 of 8 Granulicatella spp. bacteraemia occurred in immunosuppressed, mainly febrile
neutropenic patients. To date, no cases of A. defectiva and
only five cases of Granulicatella spp. bacteraemia in neutropenic patients have been reported. Pierard et al.
described one case of G. adiacens bacteraemia among 62
cases of streptococcal bacteraemia in neutropenic patients
[35]. In a small series published by Woo et al., three cases
of G. adiacens bacteraemia were associated with febrile
neutropenia in cancer patients [36]. Finally, one case of G.
elegans bacteraemia was reported by Murray et al. in a
febrile neutropenic cancer patient [37]. We report here the
first case of "G. para-adiacens" infection in the setting of
febrile neutropenia.

Conclusion
We report six cases of bacteraemia due to Granulicatella
spp. in febrile neutropenic patients. Chemotherapyinduced neutropenia and oral mucositis may represent
predisposing factors. Granulicatella spp. should be considered as a possible agent of bacteraemia in neutropenic
cancer patients.
