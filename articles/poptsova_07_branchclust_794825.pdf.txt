Abstract
Background: Automated methods for assembling families of orthologous genes include those
based on sequence similarity scores and those based on phylogenetic approaches. The first are easy
to automate but usually they do not distinguish between paralogs and orthologs or have restriction
on the number of taxa. Phylogenetic methods often are based on reconciliation of a gene tree with
a known rooted species tree; a limitation of this approach, especially in case of prokaryotes, is that
the species tree is often unknown, and that from the analyses of single gene families the branching
order between related organisms frequently is unresolved.
Results: Here we describe an algorithm for the automated selection of orthologous genes that
recognizes orthologous genes from different species in a phylogenetic tree for any number of taxa.
The algorithm is capable of distinguishing complete (containing all taxa) and incomplete (not
containing all taxa) families and recognizes in- and outparalogs. The BranchClust algorithm is
implemented in Perl with the use of the BioPerl module for parsing trees and is freely available at
http://bioinformatics.org/branchclust.
Conclusion: BranchClust outperforms the Reciprocal Best Blast hit method in selecting more sets
of putatively orthologous genes. In the test cases examined, the correctness of the selected families
and of the identified in- and outparalogs was confirmed by inspection of the pertinent phylogenetic
trees.

Background
The problem of gene family selection from any given set
of taxa is one of the primary tasks in evolutionary genomics. The correct identification of orthologs (i.e. genes
whose deepest relationship represents a speciation event
[1]) is crucial for reconstruction and interpretation of phylogenetic trees; and for addressing the following questions: How many common genes are shared by different
species? What is the extent of the core of genes that shares
a common history? Which genes underwent duplication,
were lost, or horizontally transferred between different
lineages? Most of the known methods used for detection

of orthologs are based on sequence similarity and
genome-specific best hits [2]. Phylogenetic methods are
more reliable but they are difficult to automate and the
complexity grows with the increase of the number of taxa
in question.
Another important task in molecular evolution is to
ascribe a gene function to open reading frames in a newly
sequenced genome. Today's gene annotation techniques
are based largely on a search for homologous sequences
with known functions, with orthologs more likely to have
identical functions as compared to paralogs. The methods

are based on sequence similarity searches using BLAST [3]
as a primary tool, and PSI-BLAST [4] or HMM-based
methods for profile searching [5]. The final stage of positioning of an unknown sequence in a phylogenetic tree in
order to infer its function either needs to be performed
manually by the curator, or is omitted entirely, which can
be problematic because changes in substitution rate frequently lead to situations where the closest phylogenetic
neighbor does not correspond to the highest scoring hit in
a BLAST search [6]. The algorithm we propose here fully
automates the process of assembling gene families for any
given number of taxa and also aids sequence annotation
because it positions an unknown gene sequence in a phylogenetic tree containing both paralogs and orthologs
from closely related species.
Today, a widely used method to identify sets of orthologs
from a set of n species is the reciprocal best BLAST hit
method (e.g., [7,8]). The method requires strong conservative relationships among the orthologs so that if a gene
from species 1 selects a gene from species 2 as a best hit
when performing a BLAST search with genome 1 against
genome 2, then the gene 2 must in turn select gene 1 as the
best hit when genome 2 is searched against genome 1. For
a set of n species the reciprocal BLAST hit method requires
the presence of all pairwise reciprocal connections
between all species as depicted on Figure 1A.
The reciprocal BLAST hit method is very stringent and succeeds in the selection of conserved orthologs with a low
false positive rate [9], but it often fails to assemble sets of
orthologs in the presence of paralogs. Figure 1B illustrates
how reciprocity is broken in the presence of paralogous
gene 2' closely related to gene 2. Genes 2 and 2' could be
inparalogs [10] that resulted from a recent gene duplication. In this example gene 3 chooses gene 2' instead of
gene 2 as a best BLAST hit, preventing both paralogs from
being appropriately recognized as orthologs [1].
Figure 2 gives an example where reciprocity fails in a case
of four species (two archaea and two bacteria) for a conserved anciently duplicated protein, ATP synthase ATP
binding subunits. In the case of the catalytic subunits
(ATP-A, Figure 2A), reciprocity is broken when ATP-A
from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis chooses the more
conserved subunits B (ATP-B), from Sulfolobus solfataricus
as the best BLAST hit. In the case of the ATP-B family (Figure 2B), the situation is further complicated by the presence of a third paralog frequently found in bacterial
species, a paralog that is involved in assembly of the bacterial flagella [11] (here denoted as ATP-F), which is
selected as the best hit for ATP-B from the archaeon Methanosarcina mazei. As a result, neither ATP-A nor ATP-B are
selected as gene families when applying a strict reciprocal
best BLAST hit method. In many bacteria additional ATP-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/120

A paralogs exist that make the recognition of orthologs
even more difficult (see below): a Rho transcription termination factor involved in unwinding the RNA transcript
from the encoding DNA, and an ATPase that is part of type
III secretion systems that is similar to ATP-F. In contrast to
the reciprocal best hit approach, a phylogenetic tree,
reconstructed for all the genes collected from both diagrams of Figure 2, places ATP-A, ATP-B and ATP-F on separate branches forming three distinct clusters representing
the three gene families (see Figure 3).
In total, from the four species mentioned above, the strict
reciprocal best BLAST hit method selects only 80 families.
To illustrate the influence of paralogs on the total number
of selected orthologs, we conducted the following experiment. Each genome was "BLASTed" against itself, and if a
query gene had significant hits other than the query itself,
these genes were removed from further consideration.
Then the reciprocal best BLAST hit method was applied to
the genomes "cleaned" from paralogs, and the number of
selected families increased to 200, demonstrating that the
small size reported for the prokaryotic core (see [12] for
examples) is in part due to difficulties discriminating
between in- and outparalogs. Because the genomes were
artificially reduced by removing all paralogs (including
out paralogs) that could cause confusion, the total
number of orthologous families for complete genomes
should be even bigger.
In the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) [13] strict
reciprocity is replaced by a triangular best Blast hits relationship. First, triangles forming one-side circular best
BLAST hits are constructed, and then triangles with common sides are merged together to form a cluster. The COG
clusters consist of an undifferentiated mixture of
orthologs and in- and outparalogs, and are limited to a
certain set of taxa. The same problem exists for HOBACGEN [14] whose precomputed database of gene families
also is a mixture of orthologs and paralogs and does not
contain many of the newly sequenced genomes.
A simple phylogenetic algorithm to infer speciation and
duplication events in a gene tree was proposed by [15] but
their approach requires a known species tree which is
impossible in many cases of prokaryotes. Another limitation of this method is that all incongruence is explained
by means of duplication and losses, whereas for prokaryotes, these often, result from HGT events.
The Inparanoid euykaryotic orthologs database [16] contains pairwise orthologs which were assembled by the
reciprocal best BLAST hit method. Inparalogs are added to
the orthologous pairs by applying the Inparanoid clustering method based on sequence similarities scores [17].
Only two taxa are considered at a time.

We aimed to develop a method of assembling orthologous gene families that would have no restriction on the
number of taxa, doesn't require a known species tree and
would be able to distinguish between paralogs and
orthologs by analyzing their position in a phylogenetic
tree.

Results
Algorithm
In molecular evolution the notion of branch is frequently
used as synonymous for a split, i.e. the line connecting
two nodes. Throughout the article we use the term branch
in its traditional meaning, as referring to a subtree in a
rooted tree that contains all nodes distal to a node. In the
following, the term genome refers to the collection of all
amino acid sequences encoded in a genome, and with
genome BLAST we denote the collection of all BLAST
searches, performed with blastall [3], using each of the
amino acid sequences as query. We use the term cluster to
denote a subtree containing one set of orthologous genes.
If there is more than one gene from the same taxon inside
a cluster, these genes are considered as inparalogs. We use
the term superfamily to denote a collection of genes that
show significant similarity to each other.

Here we present BranchClust, a branch clustering algorithm that parses trees to delineate families of orthologs
within a superfamily containing several paralogous gene
families. The underlying idea is that closely related genes
are placed on one branch emerging from one node on a
tree, so the task of detecting families for n different taxa is
simply a task to detect branches containing groups of
genes from all, or almost all, species. Step-by-step guidance on all procedures of the method from downloading
complete genomes to applying the BranchClust algorithm
and using BranchClust in conjunction with TreeDyn [18]
are available in the BranchClust tutorial at [19].
First, we start with selection of the so-called superfamilies,
i.e. sets of genes containing mixtures of orthologs and paralogs. Assume that we have n complete genomes of different taxa. We combine all genomes from n taxa in one
database. From this set of n genomes, we arbitrarily
choose one and perform BLAST searches of all genes in the
selected genome against a combined genome database.
Then we parse the BLAST output in such a way that not
only the best hit for each species is selected, but all of the
significant hits obtained for a given query. As a result, each
species can contribute to a superfamily through both

chain in bacteria is the catalytic subunit and corresponds to subunit A in archaeal and eukaryotic vacuolar type ATPases; the
alpha chain, or non-catalytic subunit, in bacteria corresponds to subunit B in archaea [46]. In addition, the archaeal A subunit is
sometimes labelled as alpha subunit. To simplify our discussion and the diagrammatic representation we designate all catalytic
subunits, either from bacteria or from archaea as ATP-A, and all non-catalytic subunits as ATP-B.

orthologs and paralogs of the original query. Superfamilies constructed from the paralogs of the query species are combined in one.
The choice of a starting genome could affect the ultimate
number and composition of families of orthologous
genes, especially, if we relax the criteria and require that at
least 80% of different taxa be present in each family. Different species might collect different sets of significant
hits. To select all possible orthologs we perform BLAST of
all n genomes against the database composed of the same
n genomes, and then assemble all significant hits for each
gene from every genome in superfamilies (see the BranchClust Tutorial [19] for a step by step description for assembling superfamilies).
The sequences from obtained superfamilies are aligned
and a phylogenetic tree is reconstructed by any of the preferred methods of tree reconstruction (currently by default

clustalw 1.83 is used for sequence alignment with default
parameters and for phylogenetic reconstruction using correction for multiple substitutions; see Methods and Discussion for more details).
DEFINITION 1. We will call a branch in a phylogenetic
tree complete if it contains representatives from all species, and incomplete otherwise.
DEFINITION 2. We will call a node in a phylogenetic tree
complete if a complete branch originates from that node,
and incomplete otherwise.
We start the selection from the most distant leaf in a tree
(the choice of the root will be discussed later), and then
descend node by node, adding branches and calculating
the total number of different species on the branches,
until a node becomes complete. A schematic representation of BranchClust algorithm is depicted in Figure 4.

We start from Node 1 which contains an incomplete
Branch 1. Then we descend to Node 2 and add Branch 2
containing some number of different taxa. Here we introduce the notion of "FEW" and "MANY". Depending on
the number of considered species, parameter "MANY" signifies how many different taxa would be sufficient for a
branch to be reported as a separate cluster, or, in other
words, the parameters "MANY" and FEW" determine
which branch could serve as a "stopper" when it is
encountered as a side branch while descending from node
to node (see Figure 4). The boundary between FEW and
MANY can be adjusted (for example in cases where many
reduced genomes are included); usually a boundary
between "FEW" and "MANY" around 70–80% of the different taxa in question was found to work satisfactorily.
For example, in case of 4 taxa, "MANY" would be more
than 2 or 3; in case of 13 taxa – 8–10, and in case of 30 –
20–25. "FEW" is just the total number of different taxa
minus "MANY". If Branch 2 contains "FEW" species we
continue selection until Node 2 becomes complete. If
Branch 2 contains "MANY" species, then we must check
how many species are already on Branch 1. If Branch 1
contains "MANY" species, and we also added "MANY"
species on Branch 2, then it is most likely that Branch 1 is
a separate, though incomplete, cluster. If Branch 1 con-

tains only "FEW" different species, then we add it to the
Branch 2, and continue with the selection.
The algorithm's pseudocode can be written as follows:
INPUT:
Binary superfamily tree T for n taxa.
OUTPUT:
Clusters, either complete or incomplete, with report of
selected families, inparalogs and out-of-cluster paralogs.

arbitrarily rooted: it can be rooted inside any cluster or
anywhere in between (see example below). For example,
if the root splits a cluster so that one branch will contain
more than MANY species, this branch will be wrongly
reported as a family. However, if a tree is rooted somewhere in between the clusters, the results will not be
affected by the root position because a branch with a cluster acts as a "stopper". To avoid artifacts due to placing the
initial root, the selection is repeated for the tree rooted at
the opposite end. We report as final the clustering that
minimizes the number of paralogs. The process of selection with tree re-rooting is illustrated in Figure 5.
Figure 5A shows a hypothetical unrooted tree for a set of
5 taxa A, B, C, D and E. The parameter MANY is set to 4
(i.e. the branch containing 4 different taxa will serve as a
"stopper"). The algorithm runs twice with two different
roots, which are chosen as the two nodes most distant
from each other. The process of root selection for the two
independent runs is shown on Figures 5B–D. Figures 5C,
E–H show how BranchClust works for the tree rooted with
root 1.
We repeat selection for the tree rooted with root 2 (Figure
5D) and compare the results by calculating the number of
paralogs resulting in two different runs. The clustering
that contains the least number of paralogs is selected.
Using two trees rooted at opposing ends helps to solve a
problem that arises in case of two incomplete clusters.
This problem and how it is addressed by the implemented
approach is illustrated by the clustering of the penicillin
binding proteins' superfamily for a set of 13 gamma proteobacteria (Figure 6A).
The superfamily containing the penicillin-binding proteins consists of 25 members that form two distinct clusters in the tree: one is a branch with 15 leaves and 13
different taxa, forming a complete cluster; the other cluster is incomplete, containing only 12 members from 12
different species. The results of BranchClust algorithm in
this case depend on the starting point, or the root of the
tree. If we start selection inside Cluster 1, we will select the
complete Cluster 1, remove it from the tree and the
remaining tree will be the incomplete Cluster 2. However,
if we start selection inside Cluster 2, we will skip the node
containing Cluster 2 and continue selection to form a
complete branch. This will result in the following clustering: 23:13, 5:5, meaning that one branch contains 23
leaves with 13 different taxa and the second – 5 leaves
with 5 different taxa. The number of paralogs is given by
the difference between the number of leaves on a branch
and number of different taxa. In the latter case this
number would be 23-13 + 5-5 = 10, and in the first run we
have the difference of 15-13+13-12 = 3. We select that run
which yields the minimum number of paralogs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/120

Once a cluster is isolated, a family containing one representative from each taxon is selected with identification of
inparalogs as duplicated genes inside that cluster. For
example, in the case of penicillin-binding proteins' superfamily (Figure 6A–B), cluster 1 contains two inparalogs,
one of Salmonella typhimurium, gi 16765177, and the
other is of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gi 15597468. Selection
starts from the most distant leaf on a tree, and the gene
copy which is closest to the top of the branch is reported
as part of the family, while other copies are reported as
inparalogs.
We call genes "out-of-cluster paralogs", if they are located
inside a superfamily, but not on the branch containing a
selected cluster. Note that for a given cluster all other
genes from the same superfamily are "outparalogs". We
do not include all of these outparalogs in our clustering
reports, because this would just list all genes in the superfamily not included in that cluster. The concept of "out-ofcluster paralogs" is illustrated in Figure 7, which depicts
the superfamily of DNA-binding proteins and integration
host factors for 13 gamma proteobacteria. The second
copy of gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gi 15600541, is
reported as an out-of-cluster paralog (Figure 7) because
Pseudomonas contains one copy inside each cluster. See
[19] and additional files for more examples.
Testing
Clustering
We tested the BranchClust algorithm on four different sets
of genomes: 2 bacteria and archaea, 13 gamma proteobacteria, 14 archaea and 30 bacteria and archaea together.
Table 1 compares the number of families of orthologs
selected by the reciprocal best BLAST hit method and by
the BranchClust algorithm.

The homologs of ATPase/ATPsynthase catalytic subunits
provide a good test case to explore the limits of algorithms
to assemble families of orthologs. This superfamily
includes ancient paralogs and recent gene duplications,
and among the homologs that are part of the type three
secretions system are genes frequently horizontally transferred found in pathogenicity islands [20,21]. Examples of
clustering the ATP synthases' superfamily for 13 gamma
proteobacteria, 30 and 317 bacteria and archaea can be
found in the additional files [see Additional files 1, 2, 3]
and on the BranchClust web-site [19]. In all cases BranchClust recognizes complete clusters for ATP-A and ATP-B,
as well as clusters for Rho-termination factor, and ATP-F
and type III secretion system ATPases. More examples of
BranchClust analyses are given in the additional files:
examples from the analysis of 13 gamma proteobacterial
genomes [see Additional files 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]; analysis of 14
archaeal genomes [see Additional files 9, 10, 11, 12, 13];

and for a joint analysis of 16 bacterial and 14 archaeal
genomes [see Additional file 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].
Gene annotation
An example of how the BranchClust algorithm could aid
gene annotation is provided by the example of the penicillin-binding proteins superfamily (Figure 6A). The current annotation for clusters reported by the BranchClust
algorithm is presented in Figure 6B. It is evident from the
report that the two hypothetical proteins of Wigglesworthia
glossinidia are likely to be penicillin-binding proteins 2
and 3, respectively. In the case of paralogs of Salmonella
typhimurium, the annotation is confusing. The nearest
neighbors of Escherichia coli are annotated as division-specific transpeptidases (gi 16763512 and gi 16764017), and
the paralogs, more distant to Escherichia coli, are identified
as penicillin-binding proteins (gi 16765177 and gi
16765252).

Moreover, genes within each cluster are not consistently
named. For example, 7 genes out of 13 are annotated as
penicillin-binding protein 3, and other members of the
family as peptidoglycan synthetase ftsI, or its precursor
(Escherichia coli, Buchnera aphidicola, Pasteurella multocida
and Yersinia pestis). Only specialists would recognize that
penicillin-binding protein 3 and peptidoglycan synthetase ftsI are synonymous and designate the same protein. Perhaps more species and additional structural
analysis will be needed to infer the correct gene names,
but the BranchClust algorithm can be used as a first automated step in the complex task of gene annotation. See
additional files for more examples of annotations inside
clusters.
Implementation
The BranchClust algorithm is implemented in Perl with
the use of BioPerl module for parsing trees and is available
at [19].
Automation with TreeDyn
The best way to evaluate the results of clustering is to highlight the selected clusters, families, and in- and outparalogs in a phylogenetic tree. Graphic representation of a
clustered tree can be automated using the TreeDyn program [18]. An example of how the results of the BranchClust are highlighted for a tree of ATP-ases' superfamily
for 13 gamma proteobacteria together with labelling file
for the automated use of TreeDyn are available in the
BranchClust Tutorial.

Discussion
Gene family, family of orthologs and superfamily
At present there is no agreement on the definitions of the
terms gene family and superfamily. Usually the term gene
family implies homology, i.e. descent from a common

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/120

ancestral gene, but this is a very sparse definition, because
there is no indication of how far back in time a common
origin should be traced. We used orthology as criterion
defining clusters and included the collection of all recognized homologs (para- and orthologs) under the label
superfamily. These definitions result in groupings similar
to the SCOP database, where a gene family is defined by
sequence identity of 30% and greater, and superfamilies
as "families whose proteins have low sequence identities
but whose structures and, in many cases, functional features suggest that a common evolutionary origin is probable" [22].
Throughout the manuscript we use the term "gene family"
to denote a collection of orthologs, where each species
contributes one or in case of in-paralogs several genes to
the family. Superfamilies are composed of families related
to each other via significant BLAST hits, i.e., superfamilies
correspond to single-linkage clusters. As a consequence,
some superfamilies will contain families of orthologs that
are joined via a single fusion protein. The implemented
phylogenetic reconstruction of such a superfamily places
the families of orthologs in distinct branches of the superfamily tree. See the section on phylogenetic reconstruction for further discussion and for alternatives.
The BranchClust algorithm is not restricted to the method
of assembling superfamilies proposed in this article, and
implemented in the BranchClust scripts. Rather, BranchClust allows one to analyze superfamilies assembled
under any other selection criteria; e.g., the pre-computed
families from COG or HOBCAGEN could be submitted
for further BranchClust clustering.
Technical limitations of BranchClust
Technical limitations of the BranchClust approach mostly
are due to the exhaustive BLAST all-to-all searches and to
the alignment of huge superfamilies rather than due to
reconstruction and parsing of phylogenetic trees. Processing of 1500 superfamily trees for 13 taxa with BranchClust
took about an hour on the University of Connecticut's
biocluster (PowerPC G5 2.3 GHz, 2GB RAM), while the
BLAST searches needed to assemble the superfamilies
took about 12 hours with another day required for alignment of the superfamilies. All-against-all BLAST searches
are needed only if the species in question are so diverged
that direct BLAST comparisons between two distant species fails identify homologs that can be identified via
intermediate species. Huge time savings result when only
one-to-all BLAST searches are performed using only genes
from the biggest genome from the dataset as query. However, these savings in computational time come at the
price of inconsistency, because the way the superfamilies
are selected, depends on the genome used as query
genome. Using this shortcut, we tested BranchClust on a

Page 11 of 16

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/120

set of 319 bacterial and archaeal species available on the
NCBI web-site as of April 2006. We took the genome of
Escherichia coli K12 as starting genome and performed
BLAST searches on a database composed of all 319
archaeal and bacterial species. Clustalw was able to align
and reconstruct trees for superfamilies with up to 3000
genes (see the example of the ATP synthases superfamily
for 319 taxa [see Additional file 3] and the BranchClust
web-site [19]). Using the described one genome against
all approach to form superfamilies, the total computation
time from BLAST through to BranchClust selection for
319 species was less than 1 week.

of BranchClust is the difference in divergence between
orthologs and divergence between outparalogs. Clustalw
was selected for its speed, and because the generated trees
having reasonable resolution at different levels of relatedness. By default we do not exclude poorly aligned parts
from the analyses because for closer related sequences
these poorly aligned stretches are the most informative.
The chosen default approach biases the final tree topology
towards the tree used during the progressive alignment
[23]; however, this drawback is the price that is paid for
using a single alignment for different levels of phylogenetic relationship.

If a diverse group of organisms is analyzed (e.g., all bacteria) and the MANY/FEW parameter is set too high, then
orthologs that are present in only a small subgroup of the
genomes (e.g. photosynthetic genes that are only present
in photosynthetic bacteria) will be classified as outparalogs. Future improvement of the BranchClust algorithm
will focus on training the algorithm to make context
dependent choices for the MANY/FEW parameter. In case
genomes from divergent organisms are analyzed we recommend to choose a smaller value for the MANY/FEW
parameter, and to include superfamilies in the analyses
that have representation in only a fraction of the analyzed
genomes (see the BranchClust Tutorial available at [19]).

We do not filter the initial alignments for the lengths of
match as percent of the sequence length. Nevertheless, in
none of the analyzed test cases did we find clusters of
putative orthologs that were contaminated by fusion proteins. This is a testament to the robustness of the chosen
tree building algorithm. Omitting a filter for minimum
alignment lengths allowed inclusion of divergent
sequences within one superfamily. If two families of
orthologs are joined into a single superfamily through a
fusion protein, clustalw places the families of orthologs
on separate branches and BranchClust breaks them apart
appropriately. If another tree reconstruction method is
used, or if gaps are excluded globally, the superfamilies
that are created through single fusion proteins need to be
broken apart before BranchClust can be applied. One possibility is to only consider those BLAST hits in the formation of the superfamiles where the matches extend to
more than 50% of the sequence lengths of both query and
target sequence. Another solution is to shatter large superfamilies generated in single linkage clustering through
application of Markov clustering [24,25]. This hybrid
clustering approach was used successfully in [26] to avoid
non-specific clusters resulting from matches to promiscuous domains.

If genomes from divergent organisms are analyzed, the
distinction between orthologs and paralogs might be difficult for proteins that experience high substitution rates.
Especially in case of out-of-cluster-paralogs that are not
separated from a cluster of orthologous genes by a long
branch (e.g., sequence 15600541 in Figure 7), further
analyses will be needed to test, if the sequence in question
might be a misidentified member of a family of orthologs.
Phylogenetic reconstruction
If only genomes from closely related organism are analyzed, the sequence divergence between orthologs will be
much smaller than the divergence between ancient paralogs, and therefore, the overall result will not critically
depend on the method for phylogenetic reconstruction
chosen to calculate the phylogeny for the superfamily. The
trees calculated to cluster the superfamily should not be
considered substitutes for a more detailed phylogenetic
assessment. Especially, if ancient paralogs are included in
the superfamily, the relationship between the clusters of
orthologous genes, and their relationship to other outparalogs remains uncertain. If these relations are to be determined more accurately, analyses needs to focus on the
most conserved portions of the protein, whereas for
within cluster relationships the use of the nucleotide
sequences might be necessary, because synonymous substitutions might represent the only variability observed
between sequences. A crucial determinant for the success

If BranchClust is applied to genomes of a single genus or
family, additional stringency could be applied in selecting
members of a superfamily, and this in turn would allow
excluding poorly aligned positions before further analysis.
Even though the phylogenetic analysis used to cluster the
superfamily is not very sophisticated, the utilization of a
multiple sequence alignment and its analysis using a phylogenetic framework results in a powerful improvement
with respect to the automated assembly of orthologs.
Within cluster phylogeny
For the task of assembling gene families for a set of n taxa,
we do not analyze the phylogeny within each branch, and
thus no reference species tree is used or required. The phylogeny of the superfamily tree only is used to distinguish
paralogs from clusters of orthologs. The crucial part of the
supertree phylogeny is the branch that connects a cluster

Page 12 of 16

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:120

of orthologs to the outparalogs. A cluster of orthologs is
recognized by virtue that many of the included genomes
are represented in this cluster (Figure 4). This independence from a reference species phylogeny often will be an
advantage. In case of many closely related genomes, too
few substitution events have occurred to reconstruct the
genomes' relationships from a single gene. In case of
prokaryotes single genes and operons can be transferred
between species [27,28] and many other processes and
artifacts are known to yield differences between individual gene phylogeny and the consensus phylogeny [29].
However, additional phylogenetic analysis is needed to
compare the evolutionary history between paralogous
families. The topological congruence of paralogous
branches could be used to infer the root of the superfamily tree (see results for details and Figure 6), allowing
to trace back the evolutionary history of molecules to
times before the organismal common ancestor came into
existence [30-33].
BranchClust does not alleviate the need to compare individual gene families to the consensus or species phylogenies – rather it provides for an assembly of families of
putative orthologs that is a prerequisite for studying their
evolution. Mapping the sequence of duplication events
onto a species tree, and finding instances of orthologous
replacement are important to understand the evolution of
a superfamily. Knowledge of the species phylogeny is
required to interpret the data. For example, the case of the
ATP synthase superfamily for 30 bacteria and archaea
([see Additional file 2] and examples discussed at the
BranchClust web-site [19]) a sequence from the archaeon
Methanosarcina groups within bacterial sequences for both
ATP-A and ATP-B genes, and two bacterial homologs,
from Deinococcus and Thermus, are located within a group
of archaeal homologs also for both ATP-A and ATP-B
genes [34-37]. BranchClust does not perform the analyses
necessary to identify these events, but it provides a greatly
improved, automated tool to assemble the starting materials on which to do these studies.
The universal genome core
One surprising outcome of our analysis was the large
number of families that were well represented in both the
archaeal and bacterial domains of life (see Table 1). The
strict core, i.e. genes that are found in all organisms
remains small, and is expected to shrink further as more
genome sequences become available [12]. The reason for
this trend is that specialized organisms, in particular parasites and symbionts, often have reduced genomes, sometimes lacking even important functions like ATP synthesis
and chemiosmotic coupling [38]. However, even with
only slightly relaxed conditions, the number of gene families present in most archaeal and bacterial genomes was
surprisingly high. This finding re-affirms the shared ances-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/120

try of all life and is testament to the conservative nature of
evolution: re-use of something already invented appears
to be preferred over re-invention from scratch. The
number of gene families with near universal distribution
among prokaryotes appears to be higher than previously
determined, possibly because in previous analyses the
selection of orthologs was so stringent that many legitimate orthologs were excluded.

Conclusion
The RBH method frequently fails in assembling families
of orthologous genes because this method fails to handle
paralogs, in particular inparalogs, a finding acknowledged
in many reports using automated assembly of orthologous sets (e.g., [7,39]).
BranchClust provides an automated, robust approach to
assemble families of orthologs. It effectively selects complete and incomplete clusters of putatively orthologous
genes, including inparalogs arising through lineage specific gene amplification. The use of BranchClust will allow
one to include larger portions of completely sequenced
genomes into genome based phylogenetic reconstructions, thereby allowing phylogenomics to move away
from the currently dominating reconstruction of trees
describing the history of the transcription and translation
machinery [40] to analyses that include metabolic pathways that might be present only in a subset of the analyzed genomes.

for both sequence alignment and tree reconstruction
using a distance method with Kimura correction. Other
programs that are fast and use a command line interface
can easily be substituted: e.g. MUSCLE [42] for sequence
alignment, phyml [43], TREEPUZZLE [44] in conjunction
with neighbor joining [45]) for phylogenetic tree reconstruction.
