Abstract
Background: The degree of metal binding specificity in metalloproteins such as metallothioneins (MTs) can be
crucial for their functional accuracy. Unlike most other animal species, pulmonate molluscs possess homometallic MT
isoforms loaded with Cu+ or Cd2+. They have, so far, been obtained as native metal-MT complexes from snail tissues,
where they are involved in the metabolism of the metal ion species bound to the respective isoform. However, it has
not as yet been discerned if their specific metal occupation is the result of a rigid control of metal availability, or
isoform expression programming in the hosting tissues or of structural differences of the respective peptides
determining the coordinative options for the different metal ions. In this study, the Roman snail (Helix pomatia) Culoaded and Cd-loaded isoforms (HpCuMT and HpCdMT) were used as model molecules in order to elucidate the
biochemical and evolutionary mechanisms permitting pulmonate MTs to achieve specificity for their cognate metal
ion.
Results: HpCuMT and HpCdMT were recombinantly synthesized in the presence of Cd2+, Zn2+ or Cu2+ and
corresponding metal complexes analysed by electrospray mass spectrometry and circular dichroism (CD) and ultra violetvisible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry. Both MT isoforms were only able to form unique, homometallic and stable complexes
(Cd6-HpCdMT and Cu12-HpCuMT) with their cognate metal ions. Yeast complementation assays demonstrated that the
two isoforms assumed metal-specific functions, in agreement with their binding preferences, in heterologous eukaryotic
environments. In the snail organism, the functional metal specificity of HpCdMT and HpCuMT was contributed by metalspecific transcription programming and cell-specific expression. Sequence elucidation and phylogenetic analysis of MT
isoforms from a number of snail species revealed that they possess an unspecific and two metal-specific MT isoforms,
whose metal specificity was achieved exclusively by evolutionary modulation of non-cysteine amino acid positions.
Conclusion: The Roman snail HpCdMT and HpCuMT isoforms can thus be regarded as prototypes of isoform
families that evolved genuine metal-specificity within pulmonate molluscs. Diversification into these isoforms may
have been initiated by gene duplication, followed by speciation and selection towards opposite needs for
protecting copper-dominated metabolic pathways from nonessential cadmium. The mechanisms enabling these
proteins to be metal-specific could also be relevant for other metalloproteins.

Background
Metallothioneins (MTs) constitute a superfamily of
genetically polymorphic cysteine (Cys)-rich polypeptides
that bind, with high affinity, closed-shell metal ions such
as Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu+ and others [1,2]. In many organisms

they play multiple roles. By serving as principal cellular
stores for Zn 2+ and Cu + they warrant the supply of
these essential trace elements in growth and rescue processes and, by their high sequestration power, they
shield cell components from deleterious bonding by
highly reactive metals such as Cd2+ and overabundant
Zn2+ and Cu+ [3,4]. In addition, they are also thought to
serve as quenchers of free radicals [5,6]. In most animal
species examined different MT isoforms show poor or

no appreciable differentiation and specialization in their
functions and metal-binding preferences [7,8], although
variations in metal selectivity between MT domains
exist in some cases [9-11]. As a consequence, the metal
composition of most native metal-MT complexes is very
often remarkably promiscuous [12,13]. Occasionally,
apparent metal specificity results from a disproportional
oversupply of a certain metal ion, due to particular physiological conditions such as metabolic trace element
disorders [14] or cellular overload due to metal exposure [15]. In such cases, this metal ion occupies all the
binding sites of an MT molecule which would otherwise
form heterometallic complexes. However, true metal
specificity requires an exclusive binding preference for a
certain metal to an MT peptide due to its innate structural configuration.
Understanding how MTs and other metalloproteins
achieved metal specificity through evolution is a key
question in the study of their structure/function relationship [2,16]. Among molluscs, pulmonate snails provide
an optimal system with which to study the determinants
of metal MT specificity in metazoans. Molluscs comprise
a range of economically, medically and ecologically significant species and represent one of the most successful
animal phyla, having been able to colonize nearly every
habitat on earth [17]. Some gastropod molluscs - particularly from the subclass of pulmonate snails - feature MT
isoforms that can be isolated from their tissues as homometallic complexes with either Cd 2+ or Cu + [18-21].
Hence, one isoform isolated from Cd-exposed Roman
snails (Helix pomatia) exhibited an exclusive metal complement of six equivalents of Cd 2+ per mol of protein
[22], whereas another isoform from the same species
contained 12 equivalents of Cu + [23]. It has been proposed that these two pulmonate MT isoforms serve
metal specific tasks related to cadmium detoxification
[24-26] or homeostatic copper regulation [27]. Only
recently, a third MT isoform, recovered as a mixed Cd2+and Cu + -containing complex has been detected in a
terrestrial pulmonate but, due to its low abundance, this
isoform is probably less important to the snail’s metal
metabolism [21].
So far, all pulmonate MT isoforms have been obtained
as native metal-MT complexes purified from snail tissues, where they are primarily involved in the metabolism of the metal ion species bound to the respective
isoform [18,19]. Therefore, it cannot yet be discerned if
their specific metal occupation is the result of a rigid
control of metal availability, an isoform expression programming in the hosting cells and tissues or of structural differences of the respective peptides determining
the coordinative options for the different metal ions.
The aim of the present investigation was, therefore, to
use the metal-specific snail MTs as model molecules

and to test which of the above determinants contributes
to the metal specificity in the snail MT system. To this
end, the two metal-specific H. pomatia (Hp) MT isogenes (HpCdMT and HpCuMT) were expressed in two
different heterologous environments - bacteria and yeast
- in order to test their metal binding and functional
capacities independent of their native environments.
HpCdMT and HpCuMT were recombinantly synthesized in Escherichia coli in the presence of zinc, cadmium and copper and the features of the formed metal
complexes compared by optical, chiroptical and mass
spectrometric analyses; both isoforms were compared
for their functional competence in yeast MT-knockout
cells. Furthermore, cell- and tissue-specific expression of
the two MT isogenes in the snail was scrutinized by
in situ hybridization techniques and their expression
regulation pattern was assessed by real-time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR). Finally, the phylogenetic radiation
of the gastropod MT family cluster inside the mollusc
phylum was assessed and evaluated. Overall, our data
provide an unprecedented analysis of the mechanisms
determining, at different levels, the specificity of functions of paralogous MTs, suggesting clues to how these
could have been achieved through evolution.

Results
Analysis of recombinant HpCdMT and HpCuMT metal
complexes reveals sequence-determined specialization of
metal binding

Recombinant expression of HpCdMT and HpCuMT in
metal-exposed E. coli cells was expected to reveal their
in vivo binding ability for zinc, cadmium and copper,
independent of which is the natively coordinated metal
ion.
Binding of Zn2+ and Cd2+ by HpCdMT

Mass spectrometric analysis documents that recombinant synthesis of HpCdMT in E. coli cultured in Cd2+
or Zn2+-enriched media led to the production of only a
single species with a fixed content of either six equivalents of cadmium or zinc (Figure 1a and 1b). The two
metal complexes - Cd6-HpCdMT and Zn6-HpCdMT display optical spectra with steep rises of absorbance
below 270 nm and below 240 nm which is typical of tetrahedral bonding of both metal ions to multiple thiolate
ligands (Figure 2a and 2c). The metal-to-sulphur linkages also manifest themselves by the intense positive
and negative circular dichroism (CD) bands associated
with the absorption envelopes (Figure 2b and 2d). These
signals arise in part from the dissymmetric excitonic
interactions of the sulphur-based transitions in pairs of
doubly coordinated metal-connecting cysteine residues
(of bridging thiolate ligands), thereby signifying the collective bonding of Cd2+ or Zn2+ in oligonuclear metal

thiolate complexes [28-30]. The spectral features of the
recombinant Cd6-HpCdMT product are indistinguishable from those of the native Cd6-HpCdMT previously
isolated from the tissue of Cd-exposed Roman snails
[23]. They also reappear when, at neutral pH, the full
complement of six equivalents of Cd2+ is added in vitro
to the metal-free protein apo-HpCdMT [22] or when
Zn2+ is replaced in recombinant Zn6-HpCdMT by exposure to the much more firmly binding Cd2+ (Figure 2b).
Thus, in both in vivo and in vitro, the structure of the
protein product of the HpCdMT gene is seen to direct
bonding of Cd2+ in a single energetically favoured complex fitting its supposed role of shielding the snail tissue
from this highly toxic metal ion [20,24].
Binding of Cu+ by HpCuMT

The recombinant expression of HpCuMT in E. coli cultures grown in Cu2+-enriched medium led to the formation of homometallic Cu12-HpCuMT as an essentially
single molecular species (Figure 1c), equivalent to the
native complex purified earlier from snail tissue [23].
The absorption spectra display a progressive rise below
350 nm with a broad shoulder centred at 250 nm
(Figure 2e) and in CD positive and negative ellipticity
bands (Figure 2f). These features match qualitatively and
quantitatively those seen in mammalian Cu12-MT prepared in vitro by adding 12 equivalents of the acetonitrile complex of Cu+ to native MT from rabbit and are
attributable to the formation of oligonuclear Cu +

thiolate complexes in trigonal coordination geometry
[31]. A molecular species with the same composition
and spectral properties was attained in vitro by saturating at acidic pH the recombinant, metal-free, apoHpCuMT peptide with Cu+ using [Cu(CH3CN)4]ClO4
as a titrating agent. As previously observed [23], this
homometallic recombinant product is sensitive to atmospheric O2. The recombinant complex was formed as a
single product only when the bacteria were grown
under low aeration conditions [32]. At normal oxygenation the same culture produced a heterometallic mixture
of several Cu,Zn-HpCuMT species ranging from M4 to
M12-HpCuMT (where M = Zn + Cu) and with spectroscopic features clearly different from those of Cu 12 HpCuMT. In vitro addition of Cu+ to these species in
the form of [Cu(CH3CN)4]ClO4 (see above) also failed
to transform these products into the homometallic single form.
Complexes of HpCdMT and HpCuMT with non-cognate
metal partners

In contrast to the single, well-defined MT species resulting from the recombinant expression of the HpCdMT
and HpCuMT genes in cultures enriched with their cognate metal partners, only poorly defined products were
obtained when the partners were interchanged (Figure
3). Thus, expression of the HpCdMT gene in the presence of copper resulted in mixtures of heterometallic
Zn, Cu-HpCdMT species of varying metal-to-protein

arising at less than 270 nm from oligonuclear Cd-thiolate
complexes and close to 280 nm from sulphide bonding to
the Cd-thiolate clusters [33]. In a parallel way, the production of HpCuMT in zinc (Zn)-enriched media yielded mixtures of Zn-containing species ranging from Zn3 to Zn7HpCuMT, with the different forms varying in abundance
and in different preparations (Figure 3c). The CD spectra
were indicative of Zn-thiolate coordination but differed
widely in intensity (data not shown).
Therefore, these two MTs behave in accordance with
their high metal specificity when recombinantly synthesized by bacteria grown in cultures enriched with the
non-cognate metal. The HpCdMT isoform thus rendered several mixed Zn, Cu-MT complexes of different
stoichiometries when biosynthesized in a Cu-rich medium. Following an equivalent behaviour, the HpCuMT
isoform produced a mixture of species of different stoichiometry when synthesized by bacteria grown on Znor Cd-supplemented media. The classification of MTs
according to the metal-binding behaviour shown when
recombinantly synthesized in cultures enriched with different metals and the correspondence of this classification with other ‘metal-specificity’ criteria, have been
fully reviewed [34].

second from eight to 12 equivalents (Figure 3a). The
CD spectra of the mixtures (not shown) displayed signals typical of oligonuclear Cu + -thiolate bonding but
varied in shape and amplitudes in different preparations.
The recombinant synthesis of HpCuMT in Cd2+-enriched
cultures led to mixtures of a number of Cd-HpCuMT species with a Cd content ranging from six to more than nine
equivalents and also including a sulphide-containing Cd9SHpCuMT complex (Figure 3b). The CD spectra of these
mixtures (not shown) displayed spectropolarimetric features

Stability of the Cd6-HpCdMT and Cu12-HpCuMT
complexes is documented by their metal exchange
inertness

In order to study the lability/inertness of the recombinantly synthesized Cd 6-HpCdMT and Cu12 -HpCuMT
species and their propensity to exchange their preferentially bound metal ions, an equimolar mixture of these
two complexes was allowed to stand for 20 h at 25°C
(Figure 4). The invariant electrospray ionization-mass
spectrometry (ESI-MS) spectra recorded just after mixing and 20 h later demonstrate that the integrity and
individuality of these two species was maintained for a
long period of time, which confirms that both metalHpMT complexes possess an exceptionally high stability
and exhibit a persistence attributable to their metal
binding specificity.
Transformation of HpCdMT and HpCuMT in yeast MTknockout cells confirms metal-specific roles

In order to advance from metal-specific folding to metalspecific function, the particular performance of the two
snail MT isoforms was compared by complementation
studies in another heterologous system. Hence, yeast
cells deficient in their endogenous MTs (yeast Cup1 and
Crs5 knockout cells) were transformed with complimentary DNAs (cDNAs) coding for HpCdMT, HpCuMT,
mouse MT1, yeast Cup1 and yeast Crs5 and their growth
was examined for Cu2+ and Cd2+ tolerance. When these
cells were grown at increasing Cu2+ concentrations in the

In marked contrast, when the cells were grown in media

greatest in the strain transformed with the endogenous
yeast Crs5 which reflects the known preference of this
yeast MT for divalent metal ions [32]. The second best

better than that of the cells transformed with the cDNA
coding for the mouse MT1 isoform, which natively binds

either Zn2+, Cd2+ or Cu+. The strain carrying cDNA for
HpCuMT showed almost the same high sensitivity to Cd2
+
as the MT-null knockout cells (Figure 5b).
These results show that the two snail MT isoforms
also assume metal-specific roles in a heterologous
eukaryotic environment (yeast), in accordance with their
metal-specific binding preferences revealed by their
synthesis in recombinant prokaryotic systems. Significantly, the total equivalence between the features of the
metal-MT complexes synthesized in these two hosts
(bacteria and yeast) has recently been demonstrated for
both cadmium and copper, using the Cup1 MT as a
model system [35].
In pulmonate snails, CdMT and CuMT isoforms are
products of cell-specific expression

In the midgut gland of the snail Helix pomatia, the Cdspecific isoform (HpCdMT) is synthesized in all cell
types of this organ (Figure 6a) and is also produced in
the epithelial cells of foot, gut and kidney [24]. In contrast, the messenger RNA (mRNA) coding for HpCuMT
is located only in one cell type, the so-called rhogocytes
(Figure 6b), which are present in the midgut gland, and
in many other organs, and have been shown to be the
sites of hemocyanin synthesis [27]. Consequently, both
metal-specific MT isoforms can be recovered natively
from the snail midgut gland (Figure 6c).
Pulmonate MT isoform genes display metal-specific
transcription patterns

The pattern of metal-specific transcriptional induction
of MT isogenes was examined in two pulmonate species:
in H. pomatia, the subject of this work, and in Cantareus aspersus because, in this species, a third and so far
unknown MT isogene (here called Cd/CuMT; Figure
7b) has been reported [21]. The product of this gene
also seems to occur in other pulmonate snails, as first
reported in this work (see below). The effect of metal
supplementation in the feed of the snails upon transcription was evaluated by measurement of the mRNA
copy number. For both species, the expression of the
CdMT genes was highly responsive to cadmium exposure (Figure 7a and 7b). While Cd2+ increased the number of transcripts of the CdMT genes in both species at
concentrations as low as 0.45 μmol Cd2+/g dry weight
(in the feed), no statistically significant enhancement
was observed in H. pomatia for a more than a 10-times
higher amount of Zn 2+ (6.93 μmol Zn 2+ /g dry feed
weight; Figure 7a). In Cu2+ a significant increase of the
mRNA copies of the HpCdMT gene was seen only at an
effective concentration of 5.05 μmol/g dry weight in the
feed (Figure 7a). In contrast to the CdMT genes, no significant metal-dependent enhancement of mRNA copy
number - at least at the metal concentrations assayed -

Page 8 of 20

was observed for the CuMT and Cd/CuMT genes of the
two species (Figure 7a and 7b). These induction patterns
are totally in accordance with the constitutive expression of the CuMT gene in rhogocytes [27], whereas the
much higher inducible expression of the CdMT genes in
epithelial cells supports the view that the product of this
gene plays a role in Cd2+ sequestration and detoxification [24-26]. In addition, CdMT may also serve other
biological functions, very likely in the form of the Zn2+
complex for H. pomatia, as suggested and discussed
elsewhere [36].
HpCdMT and HpCuMT as prototypes of isoform families
which have evolved metal specificity in pulmonate snails
by modulation of non-cysteine amino acid positions

HpCdMT and HpCuMT can be considered as prototypes
of a series of orthologous genes also present, except from
H. pomatia, in other pulmonate snails. Within molluscs,
gastropods and pulmonate snails, in particular, have
evolved three MT gene subfamilies, two of them comprising isoforms with a homometallic composition
[20,22,23] and distinct metal binding behaviour and functional specificities for either Cd2+ or Cu+ [18 - 21, 23; and
this work]. Figure 8 shows an alignment of the, so far
identified, MT sequences from pulmonate gastropods,
including the secondarily aquatic species Biomphalaria
glabrata. Throughout, two of the three MT isoforms are
alignable with and can thus be assimilated to the known
H. pomatia isoforms HpCdMT and HpCuMT [18]. The
third sequence, the Cd/CuMT isoform first observed in
the terrestrial garden snail (Cantareus aspersus), has
been recovered from native sources as a simultaneously
Cu + and Cd 2+ -containing complex [21] and has been
identified in other species too (see Figure 8). However,
this isogene is transcribed at low constitutive levels, as it
is not inducible by metals at all (Figure 4b) and thus
hardly detectable at the protein level. It may, therefore,
be only of circumstantial importance for the metal metabolism in its host. However, its discovery is critical for
the understanding of the diversification of MTs in this
group of organisms.
The three isoform types share strictly conserved Cys
positions in their primary structure, confirming the fundamental importance of the sulphur atoms provided by
these residues for metal complex and metal thiolate
cluster formation, irrespective of the metal species
involved. Besides Cys, a few other amino acid positions,
either on the N-terminal tail of the peptides or in the
direct neighbourhood of Cys residues, show conserved
positions through the members of the three isoform
subfamilies (Figure 8). In contrast, there is significant
variability across the three isoform types for the noncysteine amino acid residues interspersed between the
conserved positions. This suggests that the different

metal specificities of the isoforms were achieved by gene
duplication and subsequent speciation by evolutionary
modulation of these non-coordinating amino acid positions. Moreover, the alignment pattern shows that the
similarity between the members of the CuMT and
the Cd/CuMT isoform families is clearly higher than
that observed between those and the CdMT isoforms
(Figure 8, Table 1).
A nucleotide-based neighbour-joining tree shows that
pulmonate MT isoform subfamilies are assembled in three
distinct branches and are thus clearly distinguishable from

all other mollusc forms represented by the group of Bivalvia (Figure 9). This suggests that the differentiation into
these isoforms has been an evolutionary process which,
within molluscs, remained restricted essentially to pulmonate snails. The protein distance analysis tree (Figure 10)
confirms the close relationship between the CuMT and
Cd/CuMT isoforms (Table 1), which apparently evolved
from a common ancestor that gave rise to the differentiation of the Cu-specific and the less metal-specific
Cd/CuMT gene subfamilies, clearly segregated from the
CdMT gene subfamily. On the other hand, the three

pulmonate MT subfamilies share a common root with all
other gastropod MTs (Figures 9 and 10).

Discussion
In MTs, metal binding and metal exchange reactions are
mainly governed by the coordination chemistry of thiolate bonding with closed-shell metal ions such as Zn2+,
Cd2+, Cu+ [12]. To be more precise, the relative order of
in vitro metal binding affinities of apo-MT peptides, as
well as the order of displacement capacity of each heavy
metal ion within a metal-MT complex (Hg(II) > Cu(I)

~ Ag(I) > Cd(II) > Pb(II) > Co(II) > Zn(II)), follow the
rules established for metal-thiolate and metal-sulphide
low-molecular mass complexes [37]. However, the
assumption that these ‘inorganic chemistry’ rules are the
unique responsible of the metal-MT complex properties
would lead to the conclusion that MT polypeptides
sharing the same number and position of Cys residues
would exhibit equivalent metal binding behaviour. However, this is essentially untrue, as firmly demonstrated in
this work for the snail MT system. MT metal specificity
is a subject of vivid, current debate [16], as to a larger

or lesser extent, all MTs show a degree of metal specificity in native and/or in vivo environments. In this case,
metal specificity is understood to be the set of determinants that eventually leads a given MT peptide to
natively discriminate among metal ions, thus allowing
the formation of particular metal complexes and the
performance of the biological function for which they
were selected. To date, major factors claimed to explain
metal-MT specificity in live systems are protein
sequence optimization, metal ion availability and/or
metal-responsive transcription programming [2].
The structural features of the resulting MT complexes
with different metal ion species arise from the equilibrium between kinetic and thermodynamic requirements [29], so that they converge to a stoichiometric
ratio that reflects their energetically most stable state
[38]. Hence, the observation by ESI-MS of metal-MT
species synthesized in in-vivo environments, either

native or recombinant, allows one to read the propensity
of the respective peptides to form metal complexes that
are uniquely defined from a stoichiometric and thermodynamic point of view [2,23,34]. In combination with
spectroscopic studies, this leads to a clear appraisal of
the distinctness of a MT metal specificity, as exemplified
in the present work. It can, therefore, be concluded that
the homometallic and unique composition of the complexes formed by HpCdMT and HpCuMT with their
cognate metal species upon isolation from recombinant
cultures (Figure 1) reflects the innate metal specificity of
the two isoforms, rather than being the result of an
occasional association with metal ions governed by their
intracellular or environmental availability. This is confirmed by the poor metal-binding behaviour of the same
isoforms confronted with their non-cognate metal ions
(Figure 3) and by the inertness of the two complexes,
Cd6-HpCdMT and Cu12-HpCuMT, to exchange metal
ions (Figure 4). Such metal ion exchange processes have
repeatedly been reported in MTs [39] and would be reasonable to expect [12].
The complete sequential identity of Cys residues and
the high degree of conserved positions for other amino
acids shared among the three isoform families (Figure 8)
suggest, along with their nearly equal size, that metalspecific differentiation of pulmonate snail MTs must
have been initiated by gene duplication events, followed
by modulatory speciation of amino acid residues located
between the cysteine positions. Gene duplication seems
to be a common mechanism driving the evolutionary
differentiation of MT isoform in animals and is documented for MTs of Drosophila melanogaster, among
others [40], and the mussel Crassostrea gigas [41]. Once
duplicated, such genes are free to independently generate mutations, upon which selective forces can then act
towards evolution of specific features [42]. The example
of pulmonate snail MTs also proves that the evolutionary variation of non-cysteine residues can impose a
metal-specific character on to the coordination chemistry of a MT peptide. At present, it is not known how
this is achieved at a structural level. However, it must
be supposed that, due to their particular position in the
sequence and chemical nature of their side-chains, noncysteine amino acids constrain the sulphur ligands provided by the conserved Cys positions to assume only
one of several theoretically possible spatial coordination
foldings. Determination of the three dimensional structure of the Cd 6 -HpCdMT and Cu 12 -HpCuMT complexes is actually in progress which may unveil the
detailed structural basis of the metal specificity of the
two HpMT isoforms.
Cell-specific expression may also contribute to enhancing distinct metal-related functionality [2]. Roman

snails, for example, synthesize HpCuMT exclusively in
rhogocytes (Figure 6b), the modified cells of mesodermal
origin found in virtually all connective tissues of mollusc
organs [43]. Since they are also the sites of hemocyanin
synthesis [44], it was suggested that HpCuMT functions
as a Cu+ reservoir/donor for the nascent hemocyanin
[27]. The constitutive expression of HpCuMT (Figure 7)
and the exclusive preference of this isoform for Cu +
(Figure 6c) support this presumed function. The supposed incorporation of Cu+ into the structure of hemocyanin must occur under reducing conditions, which is
also consistent with the high susceptibility of native
Cu 12 -HpCuMT complexes to oxidization [20,23] and
the fact that homometallic Cu12-HpCuMT synthesis is
only achieved in low-aerated recombinant cultures (this
work). The apparent connection between the tasks of
Cu-specific MT isoforms and their presence in organisms with Cu-depending hemocyanins is reminiscent of
the situation reported for decapod crustaceans [45,46].
In these animals, concentrations of Cu-MT complexes
fluctuate with the metabolic state and the hemocyanin
levels during the moulting cycle [47,48]. Cu-specific
MTs are also observed in organisms of other kingdoms,
especially in fungi [49-51], where their role may be connected to the synthesis of the Cu-containing enzyme
tyrosinase, as in Neurospora crassa [52].
After exposure of Roman snails to Cd2+, virtually all of
this metal in the digestive tissues was bound to
HpCdMT (20) in a similar manner as for CdMT isoforms of other snail species [53]. Consistently, in the
Roman snail, HpCdMT is produced in digestive and
excretory tissues [24] (Figure 6a), where the corresponding gene is selectively upregulated by Cd 2+ exposure
(Figure 7). This suggests that absorption of toxic Cd2+
from the surrounding substrate via the alimentary tract
may constitute a particular physiological challenge, exacerbated by the evolutionary transition of gastropods to
terrestrial life [36]. Moreover, the sensitivity to Cd2+ of
important Cu-dominated metabolic pathways [54-56]
and Zn-dependent enzymes [57] could have been the
basis of the generation of a specific MT isoform devoted
to Cd2+ detoxification in these animals. Our data also
demonstrate the ready formation of homometallic complexes of HpCdMT with Zn2+, which may be a consequence of the comparable coordination preferences of
these two d10 metal ions. The much weaker bonding of
Zn2+ [58] to this isoform, however, does not prevent the
peptide from functioning as a most effective Cd 2+
sequestration agent. In the presence of Zn 2+ and the
absence of Cd 2+ , the HpCdMT isoform is expressed
only at low basal concentrations (Figure 7) and, as in
the case of mammalian MTs [59], is thought to serve
other functions [36].

Conclusion
Overall, the present study, together with the extensive
body of evidence provided by our previous work, suggests that the pair of the metal-specific H. pomatia MT
isoforms (HpCdMT and HpCuMT) can be regarded as
the prototype of a series of paralogous forms present in
pulmonate gastropods. In these organisms, divergent
evolution by gene duplication, with subsequent modulation of non-cysteine amino acid positions and a cell specific occurrence and gene expression regulation, has led
to the complete separation of their metal-binding preference, cell-specific occurrence, expression regulation and
functionality. This resulted in genuine CdMTs becoming
inducible forms specializing in the global protection of
the organism from the non-essential toxic element Cd
and in genuine CuMTs becoming constitutive forms
supplying the essential element Cu. Our findings provide experimental evidence and possible answers to how
metallotproteins in general, and MTs specifically, were
able to achieve partial or complete specificity in their
metal binding behaviour and functionality.

dry weight. At the end of the exposure period, animals
were sacrificed and their organs (midgut gland, midgut,
kidney, mantle and foot) used for in-situ-hybridization
analysis as described below.

Methods

Real-time detection PCR

Animals and metal exposure

RNA sampling for real-time detection PCR was done in
control snails and animals exposed to metals over a 5 day
period (see above). This time range was chosen because,
in pulmonate snails, maximal induction of the CdMT gene
by Cd2+ is reached only after several days. Total RNA was
isolated from the homogenized midgut gland tissue of H.
pomatia and C. aspersus individuals (Ultra Turrax T25,
IKA Maschinenbau, Staufen, Germany) and quantified
after DNaseI digestion (Fermentas, St Leon-Rot, Germany)
by means of RiboGreen® RNA Quantitation Kit (Molecular Probes, OR, USA) with calibration curves derived from
RNA standards using a fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices, CA, USA). Of total RNA, 450 ng was applied
for cDNA synthesis using RevertAid™ H Minus M-MuLV
Reverse Transcriptase (Fermentas) with hexamer primers
in a 50 μL approach. Quantification of the RNA copy
number was performed on a 7500 real-time PCR (RTPCR) instrument from Applied Biosystems (CA, USA)
using the Power SYBR Green approach (Applied Biosystems). Calibration curves from amplicon plasmids were
used for copy number analysis for each of the MT isoforms involved, using primers designed with the Primer
Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems) based on the
known cDNA sequences for MT isoforms published in
GenBank (H. pomatia HpCdMT and HpCuMT, accession
numbers: AF399740 and AF399741, respectively;
C. aspersus CaCdMT, CaCuMT and CaCd/CuMT, accession numbers: EF152281, EF178297, and EF206312). PCR
primers used were as follows: HpCdMT: sense primer,
5’AAAGTGCACCTCAGCTTGCA 3’; antisense primer: 5’

Roman snails (H. pomatia L.) were obtained from a
commercial dealer (Exoterra, Dillingen, Germany). Garden snails (C. aspersus) were provided by the Department of Chrono-Environment, University of FrancheComté, Besançon, France. All animals were reared
under laboratory conditions (20°C, 80% humidity, 12:12
h photoperiod) at the Institute of Zoology in Innsbruck,
Austria. Twenty-five snails from each species were split
equally into five groups and fed over a period of 5 days
on metal-enriched lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Metal loading of feed was achieved by soaking salad leaves in a
corresponding metal salt solution (CdCl2 in H2O, with 1
and 3 mg Cd 2+ L -1 ; ZnCl 2 in H 2 O, with 5 and 10 mg
Zn2+ L-1; CuCl2, with 10 mg Cu2+ L-1) [60]. Resulting
metal ion concentrations in the salad feed were as follows (means ± standard deviation, n = 5): Cd2+, 0.45 ±
0.11 and 1.12 ± 0.23 μmol g-1 dry weight; Cu2+, 3.51 ±
0.73 or 5.05 ± 0.97 μmol g -1 dry weight; Zn2+, 4.97 ±
3.42 and 6.93 ± 0.89 μmol g-1 dry weight). These concentrations range from physiologically to moderately
elevated levels and are, therefore, representative for
what could be the natural conditions encountered by
snails. At days 0 and 5, RNA was extracted from the
small midgut gland tissue aliquots (~10 mg fresh
weight) of at least three animals and processed for
cDNA synthesis as detailed below.
For in-situ-hybridization of HpCdMT isoform
mRNAs, five individuals of H. pomatia were exposed
over 14 days to a concentration of 14.97 μmol Cd g-1

Metal analyses

Metal-enriched salad samples were oven-dried at 60°C
for several days. Dried samples (snail tissues: 50-100 mg
dry weight; salad samples: 100 - 500 mg dry weight)
were wet-digested in screw-capped polypropylene tubes
(Greiner, Kremsmünster, Austria) with a mixture of
HNO 3 (suprapure; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and
distilled water (1:1) by heating at 70°C for several days.
At the end of digestion, a few drops of H 2 O 2 were
added to the heated samples. The remaining solutions
were diluted to a known volume with distilled water and
analysed for metal concentrations (Cd, Zn, Cu) either by
flame (model 2380 instrument, Perkin Elmer, Massachusetts, USA) or graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Hitachi Z-8200) with polarized Zeeman
background correction (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).

approach (1x Power SYBR Green PCR Mastermix, 1x

for HpCdMT and HpCuMT; 300 mM sense and 900 mM

were as follows: 50°C, 2 min; 95°C, 10 min; 40 repeats of
95°C, 15 s; and 60°C, 1 min.
In situ hybridization techniques

Cell- and tissue-specific expression of both HpMT isoforms was demonstrated by in situ hybridization (ISH).
Construction of digoxigenin-11-UTP-labelled sense and
antisense RNA probes for ISH of both MT isoform
mRNAs, as well as ISH, antibody exposure and staining
of parafomaldehyde-phosphate buffered saline (PBS)fixed paraffin sections (5 μm) from tissues (midgut
gland, midgut, kidney, mantle and foot) of control and
metal-exposed animals were performed exactly as
described previously [24]. Control sections (exposed to
either hybridization antisense or sense probes) were
treated and incubated in the same way as samples but
without anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase antibodies. For microscopy, all sections were embedded in
Entellan (Merck) [24].
Construction of the recombinant expression vectors for
wild-type Roman snail MT isoforms

The H. pomatia coding regions for both MT isoforms
were amplified by PCR using the respective cDNAs
synthesized during a previous investigation as a template
[24]. In order to facilitate their in frame cloning into the
pGEX-4T1 expression vector (Amersham GE Healthcare
Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden), BamHI and SalI
restriction sites were generated just before the anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and after the stop codon. The
oligonucleotides used for these PCR amplifications were:

AGTG 3’ as HpCuMT and HpCdMT upstream primers,
and 5’ AGGCGTCGACTTGTCGTTTATTTGCAG 3’
and 5’ ATGCGTCGACTTGTCCTGC GGTTACT 3’ as
the HpCuMT and HpCdMT downstream primers. 35cycle PCR reactions were performed under the following
conditions: 94°C 30 s, 55°C 30 s and 72°C 30 s, using
Deep Vent (New England Biolabs, Massachusetts, USA)
thermostable DNA polymerase. PCR products were isolated from 2% agarose gels, digested with BamHI-SalI
restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs) and cloned
into the corresponding sites of pGEX-4T-1, for glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-MT fusion protein synthesis. The product resulting after purification was used in
the second PCR as reverse megaprimer together with
the forward primer mentioned earlier. In the final
amplification product, the desired mutation had been
introduced and the flanking restriction sites (BamHI
and SalI) allowed the cloning in frame in pGEX-4T-1.
Prior to the protein synthesis assays, all the DNA constructs were confirmed by automatic DNA sequencing
(ABI 370, Perkin Elmer Life Sciences), using BigDye
Terminator (Applied Biosystems). DH5a was the E. coli
host strain used for cloning and sequencing purposes
and, thereafter, the expression plasmids were transformed into the E. coli protease-deficient strain BL21 for
recombinant protein overexpression.
Recombinant synthesis and purification of the metalHpMT complexes

All HpMT metal complexes analysed in this work were
biosynthesized in 2-L Erlenmeyer cultures of the corresponding transformed E. coli cells grown in LB medium
with 100 mg mL -1 ampicillin and the following metal
supplements: 300 μM ZnCl 2 or CdCl 2 for the zinc- or
cadmium-rich media, or 500 μM CuSO4 for the copperrich medium. Copper cultures were performed under
two aeration conditions (high and low aeration) as previously described [32]. GST-MT synthesis was induced
with isopropyl-1-thio-b-D-galactopyranoside at a final
concentration of 100 mM 30 min before the addition of
the metal solution. After a 2.5 h-induction, cells were
harvested by centrifugation. In order to prevent oxidation
of the metal-HpMT complexes, argon was bubbled in all
the steps of the purification following cell disruption.
For protein purification, cells were re-suspended in icecold PBS (1.4 M NaCl, 27 mM KCl, 101 mM Na2HPO4,
18 mM KH2PO4)-0.5% v/v b-mercaptoethanol, disrupted
by sonication and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 30 min. The
recovered supernatant was used to purify the GSTHpMT polypeptides by batch affinity chromatography
with glutathione sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) incubating the mixture with gentle agitation for 60 min at room temperature. After three washes
in PBS and, since the GST-HpMT fusions include a

Palacios et al. BMC Biology 2011, 9:4
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/4

thrombin recognition site, this protease was added (10 μ
per mg of fusion protein) and digestion was carried out
overnight at 23°-25°C. This allowed separation of the
GST fragment of the fusion proteins, which remained
bound to the gel matrix from the metal-HpMT portions
that were eluted together with thrombin. Therefore, the
eluate was concentrated using Centriprep Concentrators
(Amicon; Millipore, MA, USA) with a cut-off of 3 kDa
and subsequently fractionated using fast protein liquid
chromatography (FPLC), through a Superdex-75 column
(GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.0, and run at 1 mL min-1. Fractions were collected and
analysed for protein content by their absorbance at 254
nm. Aliquots of the protein-containing FPLC fractions
were analysed by 15% SDS-PAGE and stained by Coomassie Blue. HpMT-containing samples were pooled and
stored at -70°C until further use. Due to the specific
recombinant expression conditions, the three synthesized
snail MT isoforms contained one additional amino acid
residue (G) at their N-termini in relation to the native
isoforms previously isolated [20]. These modifications do
not interfere with the metal-binding capacity, as previously shown for both vertebrate [61] and invertebrate
[8] MT isoforms.
Analysis of recombinantly expressed and in vitro
prepared metal-HpMT complexes

The recombinantly expressed metal-MT complexes were
analysed for element composition (S, Zn, Cd and Cu) by
inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy
(ICP-AES) on a Polyscan 61E spectrometer (Thermo Jarrell Ash Corporation, MA, USA) at appropriate wavelengths (S, 182.040 nm; Zn, 213.856 nm; Cd, 228.802 nm;
Cu, 324.803 nm), either under ‘conventional’ (dilution
with 2% HNO3 (v/v)) or under ‘acidic’ (incubation in 1 M
HCl at 65°C for 5 min) conditions [62]. MT concentration in the recombinant preparations was calculated from
the acidic ICP sulphur measurements, thus assuming the
only contribution to their S content was that made by
the HpCuMT and HpCdMT peptides. Protein concentrations were confirmed by standard amino acid analysis
performed on an Alpha Plus Amino acid Autoanalyzer
(Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Uppsala, Sweden) after
sample hydrolysis in 6 M HCl (22 h at 110°C). Ser, Lys
and Gly contents were used to extrapolate sample
concentrations.
CD spectroscopy was performed using a model J-715
spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Gross-Umstadt, Germany)
equipped with a computer (J-700 software, JASCO). Measurements were carried out at a constant temperature of
25°C maintained by a Peltier PTC-351 S apparatus (TE
Technology Inc, MI, USA). Electronic absorption was
measured on an HP-8453 diode-array ultra violet (UV)vis spectrophotometer (GMI Inc, MN, USA), using 1-cm

Page 17 of 20

capped quartz cuvettes, and correcting for the dilution
effects by means of the GRAMS 32 software (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc, MA, USA).
Molecular mass determination was performed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry equipped with a
time-of-flight analyser (ESI-TOF MS) using a Micro TofQ Instrument (Brucker Daltonics GmbH, Bremen, Germany) calibrated with NaI (200 ppm NaI in a 1:1 H2O:
isopropanol mixture), interfaced with a Series 1100
HPLC pump (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) equipped
with an autosampler, both controlled by the Compass
Software. The experimental conditions for analysing proteins with divalent metals (Zn, Cd) were: 20 μL of the
sample were injected through a PEEK long tube (1.5 m ×
0.18 mm i.d.) at 40 μL/min under the following conditions: capillary-counterelectrode voltage, 5.0 kV; desolvation temperature, 90-110°C; dry gas 6 L/min. Spectra
were collected throughout an m/z range from 800 to
2000. The proteins that contain copper were analysed
injecting 20 μL of the sample at 30 μL/min; capillarycounterelectrode voltage, 4.0 kV; desolvation temperature, 80°C; m/z range from 800 to 2000. The liquid
carrier was a 90:10 mixture of 15 mM ammonium acetate
and acetonitrile, pH 7.0. For the analysis at acidic pH the
conditions used were the same as those used in the analysis of the case for divalent metals, except in the composition of the carrier liquid which, in this case, was a 95:5
mixture of formic acid and acetonitrile at pH 2.4. All
samples were injected at least in duplicate to ensure
reproducibility. In all cases, molecular masses were calculated according to the reported method [63].
Metal replacement titrations were performed by adding the corresponding metal ions (Cd 2+ or Cu + ) at
equivalent molar ratios to the recombinant Zn-HpMT
complexes. Titrations were carried out following previously described procedures [64,65]. The resulting
in vitro complexes were analysed by UV-Vis and CD
spectroscopy as well as mass spectrometry. All assays
were carried out in an Ar atmosphere and the pH for
all experiments remained constant throughout, without
the addition of any extra buffers.
Metal tolerance complementation assays in transformed
yeast MT-knockout cells

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae DTY4 strain (MATa,
leu2-3, 112his3 Δ 1, trp1-1, ura3-50, gal1, cup1::URA3)
was used for metal tolerance complementation assays.
This strain is characterized by a total MT deficiency due
to cup1 disruption and Crs5 truncation [66].
The cDNAs coding for the different MTs assayed - the
two snail MT isoforms (snail HpCdMT and snail
HpCuMT), the two yeast MTs (Cup1 and Crs5) and the
mouse MT1 - were ligated into the BamHI/PstI sites of
the yeast vector p424, which contains TRP1 for selection,

Palacios et al. BMC Biology 2011, 9:4
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/4

the constitutive GPD (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) promoter for heterologous gene expression,
and the CYC1 (cytochrome-c-oxidase) transcriptional
terminator [67]. The recombinant p424 vectors were
introduced into the DTY4 cells using the lithium acetate
procedure [68]. Transformed cells were selected according to their capacity to grow in synthetic complete medium (SC) without Trp and Ura.
For metal tolerance tests, transformed yeast cells were
initially grown in selective SC-Trp-Ura medium at 30°C
and 220 rpm until saturation. These cells were then
diluted to OD 600 0.01 and used to re-inoculate tubes
with 3 mL of fresh medium supplemented with CuSO4
added at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 and 105 μM final concentrations or CdCl2 at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 μM final concentrations. These cultures were allowed to grow for 18 h and
the final OD600 was recorded and plotted as a percentage of the OD600 reached by the culture grown without
metal supplement. For each concentration, and each
kind of transformation, two replicas were run.
MT sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses

MT amino acid sequences used for pulmonate MT
alignments were derived mostly from amino acid
sequence files or translated cDNA open reading frame
sequences published in GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/Tools/; see accession numbers in the legend to
Figure 9). The editing and alignment were done manually in combination with ClustalX software Version 2.0.9
[69]. For phylogenetic analyses, nucleotide sequences of
the coding region of mollusc MT cDNAs or MT genes
as well as protein primary sequences were used as published in GenBank (for accession numbers see legend of
Figure 9). Phylogenetic reconstructions we performed
with neighbour-joining [70] using the computer program PAUP* (version 4). The robustness of the phylogenetic hypothesis was tested by bootstrapping (1000
replicates) [71].
