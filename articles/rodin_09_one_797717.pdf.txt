Abstract
Background: The genetic code is brought into action by 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. These
enzymes are evenly divided into two classes (I and II) that recognize tRNAs from the minor and
major groove sides of the acceptor stem, respectively. We have reported recently that: (1)
ribozymic precursors of the synthetases seem to have used the same two sterically mirror modes
of tRNA recognition, (2) having these two modes might have helped in preventing erroneous
aminoacylation of ancestral tRNAs with complementary anticodons, yet (3) the risk of confusion
for the presumably earliest pairs of complementarily encoded amino acids had little to do with
anticodons. Accordingly, in this communication we focus on the acceptor stem.
Results: Our main result is the emergence of a palindrome structure for the acceptor stem's
common ancestor, reconstructed from the phylogenetic trees of Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya. In
parallel, for pairs of ancestral tRNAs with complementary anticodons, we present updated
evidence of concerted complementarity of the second bases in the acceptor stems. These two
results suggest that the first pairs of "complementary" amino acids that were engaged in primordial
coding, such as Gly and Ala, could have avoided erroneous aminoacylation if and only if the
acceptor stems of their adaptors were recognized from the same, major groove, side. The class II
protein synthetases then inherited this "primary preference" from isofunctional ribozymes.
Conclusion: Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that the genetic code per se (the
one associated with the anticodons) and the operational code of aminoacylation (associated with
the acceptor) diverged from a common ancestor that probably began developing before translation.
The primordial advantage of linking some amino acids (most likely glycine and alanine) to the
ancestral acceptor stem may have been selective retention in a protocell surrounded by a leaky
membrane for use in nucleotide and coenzyme synthesis. Such acceptor stems (as cofactors) thus
transferred amino acids as groups for biosynthesis. Later, with the advent of an anticodon loop,
some amino acids (such as aspartic acid, histidine, arginine) assumed a catalytic role while bound to
such extended adaptors, in line with the original coding coenzyme handle (CCH) hypothesis.

The subcode for two modes of tRNA recognition by aaRSs
The subcode for two modes of tRNA recognition by aaRSs. (A) The conventional representation of the genetic code
table with yellow and blue colors marking two modes of tRNA recognition by aaRSs – from the minor and major groove sides
of the acceptor stem, respectively. Lys is colored in lighter shade of blue in order to indicate the fact that some archaebacteria
use class I synthetases for this amino acid [9]. Stop codons are colored in yellow because the known cases of their "capture" by
amino acids are mostly from class I [8]. Codons AGG and AGA are assigned to blue Ser or Gly, as they are in mitochondria
(ibid.) Three aromatic amino acids, Phe, Tyr and Trp, with their mode of tRNA aminoacylation contradicting the class aaRS
membership, are italicized. (B) The condensed rearranged table of the genetic code, in which complementary codons are put
next to each other (all 32 pairs of complementary anticodons are shown in Figure 3). This rearrangement reveals the following
rules of tRNA aminoacylation: (1) If the complementary codons contain YY vs. RR at the second and adjacent (either first or
third) positions, their aaRSs recognize the tRNA acceptor from the same side of the groove, namely: minor (yellow) for 5'AR3'
– 5'YUN3' pairs, or major (blue) for 5'RG3' – 5'NCY3' pairs; (2) If these positions are occupied by RY and YR, the modes of
tRNA recognition are different, namely: minor (yellow) 5'YG3' vs. major (blue) 5'NCR3' and major (blue) 5'AY3' vs. minor (yellow) 5'RUN3'. These rules comprise the sub-code for two modes of tRNA aminoacylation that reveal four different quarters of
complementary codons denoted by I, II, III and IV. Other symbols: N and complementary denote all four nucleotides; R, purine
(G or A); Y, pyrimidine (C or U). For details, see [11,12].

Background
The origin of the genetic code is a great challenge to evolutionists. The genetic code (Figure 1A) acts indirectly,
through its adaptors (tRNAs). Each tRNA molecule has a
CCA-3' end, to which the specific amino acid (aa) is
attached, and an anticodon (the codon's complementary
replica) that determines this specificity. However, these
two sites are separated by nearly 70Å, the largest distance
that is spatially possible within the tRNA molecule (Figure
2). These 70Å create many complications.
First, extant tRNAs cannot self-aminoacylate. Instead, 20
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), one for each amino
acid, recognize and connect specific amino acids to the
tRNAs, in accordance with the coding assignments (Figure

1A). However, the aaRSs are themselves proteins, proteins
that mediate the translation of all protein-coding genes
including... their own. This creates the proverbial
"chicken-or-egg" problem. It is further exacerbated by the
fact that mutations in aaRS genes, due to the special role
played by the aaRSs in the translation process, accumulate
at the accelerating rate. Apparently, to escape this error
catastrophe [1], primordial life had no other means but to
use the ribozymic precursors of the synthetases to aminoacylate tRNAs. We will refer to these hypothetical
ribozymes as "r-aaRSs", to distinguish them from their
isofunctional protein successors, "p-aaRSs".

The molecule shown is the E. coli tRNAAla with GGC anticodon and the 3G:U72 "wobbling" base pair that determine the identity of all Ala tRNAs across all species [2]. Because in the ancestral tRNAs with complementary anticodons the second bases in
the acceptor are also complementary to each other [6,22], they are shown enlarged and boxed. The L-shaped tRNA consists
of two halves, the minihelix (acceptor stem plus Tψ C arm), and the 'dumbbell' (anticodon arm plus D arm). The hypothetical
aminoacylating ribozyme is shown by dotted line on the right (adapted from [12,24]).

smaller fragment of the acceptor stem, with the CCA3'
end) appear to contain enough "signal" for correct aminoacylation by cognate p-aaRSs ([2] reviewed in [3]).
Likewise, truncation of the anticodon-binding domain in
these p-aaRSs also did not change the specificity of tRNA
charging (ibid). These experiments led to the hypothesis
of the second (RNA "operational") code. The operational
code is embodied in the acceptor stem and might have
actually predated the "classic" code associated with anticodons ([4], see also [5,6]).
Third, p-aaRSs are divided into two classes (ten p-aaRSs
each) that, although performing the same functions, have
virtually nothing in common in their primary, 2D, and
3D structures [7]. However, p-aaRSs from different classes
recognize tRNAs in a mirror, complementary, fashion:
class I aaRSs approach the acceptor stem from the minor
groove side and connect aas to the 2'OH hydroxyl of the
terminal A76, whereas class II aaRSs approach the acceptor stem from the major groove side and connect aas to
the 3'OH hydroxyl of the terminal A76.
The codon-to-aa assignment (Figure 1A) represents the
universal genetic code, although deviations in some
nuclear and organelle lineages being well known [8].
Amino acids usually also do not switch the class of their
synthetases. The only known exception is LysRS – some
archaebacteria use class I aaRS instead of the standard
class II aaRS for this amino acid [9]. This suggests that
potentially either of the two aaRS classes is versatile
enough for specific aminoacylation in all 20 cases. Why,
then, are there two classes? What advantage could that
proffer? The recent analyses ([10-12], see also [13]) suggest the following (not mutually exclusive) answers: the
distribution of the codon-to-aa assignments between the
two modes of tRNA aminoacylation (1) facilitates the logically but not necessarily chemically attractive (see Results
and Discussion section) gradual reduction of coding
ambiguity and (2) protects complementary anticodons
and cognate amino acids from translational confusion. In
fact, a sub-code for the corresponding two modes of tRNA
recognition exists – a sub-code that operates with complementary anticodons flanked by evolutionarily conserved
5'U and R3' nucleotides, and therefore has little if anything to do with p-aaRSs that often recognize solely the
acceptor stem, and do not interact with the anticodon at
all [11,12]. This suggests that the "yin-yang"-like pattern
of two modes of tRNA aminoacylation and the corresponding sub-code (Figure 1B) are very ancient (definitely
predating the origin of p-aaRSs of both complementary
classes) and, as such, have been mediated by ribozymes.
Obviously, such a ribozyme (r-aaRS) could easily recognize a single-stranded anticodon by Watson-Crick pairing.
For 16 out of 32 pairs of complementary anticodons the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/4

risk of their confusion is minimal if r-aaRSs of two complementary types spread tRNA recognition in opposite
directions away from their anticodons [11,12]. However,
the (presumably) earliest amino acids, such as complementarily encoded Gly and Ala, were confusion-proof
independently of whether their r-aaRSs recognized the
anticodon loops in the same or the opposite directions
[12]. This means that in the very beginning of development of the code, the choice between the two complementary modes of tRNA recognition did not depend
much, if at all, on the anticodon loop.
In this report, we expand on the aforementioned analyses.
In particular, we focus on the reconstructed ancestral
acceptor stem, with the primordial operational code presumably located at the first three positions of the stem
(Figure 2). This reconstruction reveals the palindromic
symmetry of the acceptor stem. Accordingly, the very first
complementarily encoded amino acids were "protected"
from confusion when their ribozymic aaRSs both recognized the acceptor stem from the same (major groove)
side. This finding strengthens the hypotheses that: (1) the
two codes, operational and classic, had one ancestor
[6,14,15] and (2) the code-shaping process predated even
the origin of translation [16,17].

Methods
8,246 tRNA gene sequences, representing the three
domains of life, Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya, were
retrieved from the Genomic tRNA database [18].
We manually aligned sequences of concatenated tRNA
genes and reconstructed the phylogenetic trees (see Additional files 1, 2, 3 and 4) using MEGA 4.0 phylogenetic
analysis software http://www.megasoftware.net. The tree
topologies proved stable and sufficiently robust for our
purposes (ancestral sequence reconstruction) with respect
to the phylogenetic reconstruction method and substitution model used, and the Neighbor-Joining trees [19]
obtained using Tamura-Nei distances [20] were selected as
the baseline trees (please see the Reviewers' comments section for more detail on phylogenetic reconstruction). The
trees were also consistent with the phylogenies obtained
earlier [21], where five different whole genome-based
approaches were used.
Subsequently, and separately for each anticodon, we manually reconstructed the ancestral tRNA sequences for each
of these trees. Finally, we reconstructed the complete set
of tRNAs for the hypothetical last universal common
ancestor.
In the majority of the reconstructions (but not always –
see Results and Discussions section below) ancestral second bases coincided with the consensus second bases [22]

Biology Direct 2009, 4:4

when we used the parsimony-based method [23] to
reconstruct the ancestral states.
To measure the extent of the dual complementarity (DC),
we counted the number of tRNA pairs with complementary anticodons in which the second bases of the acceptor
helix were also complementary, and divided it by the total
number of pairs [22]. Although the anticodons contain all
four (G, C, A, and U) nucleotides, their presumed doublestranded homologs at the 1-2-3/70-71-72 positions of the
acceptor stem almost exclusively use G and C (Table 1).
Therefore, if the classic code embodied in the anticodons
and the operational code embodied in the acceptor stem
were independent of each other, then the expected DC
value would be close to 0.5 (in reality, a little lower, since
the rare U cases in the second acceptor position need to be
accounted for). We used binomial distribution with p =
0.5 (two-tailed) to estimate statistical significance of the
deviation of the observed DC values from the expected.
DC values for the reconstructed common ancestor of Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya are shown in the second panel
of Table 1. A complete set of 32 codons was used to compute DC values, because the numbers for the separate
NAN × NUN and NGN × NCN groups were too small to
guarantee the robust estimation of statistical significance
of observed differences.
It should be noted here that in statistical data analysis (in
general) one is often faced with the dilemma of either
pooling the subgroups together, or analyzing them separately. The primary advantage of the former is, of course,
increased sensitivity, specificity and robustness of the
analysis. However, if the subgroups are sufficiently heterogeneous, stratification (into subgroups) would be more
appropriate. The obvious shortcoming of such stratification is smaller numbers within each subgroup, leading to
the less robust statistical analyses. A less obvious (but
equally insidious) problem is that sometimes it is unclear
along which lines the data should be stratified (for example, should we perform a certain analysis separately for
the three domains of life? Or pool Archaea and Eukarya
together?) For the purposes of the above analysis, we
decided that the benefits of pooling all codon type subgroups together far outweighed the disadvantages of stratification (namely, numbers so low as to severely
compromise the robustness of the binomial testing).
Similar reasoning applies to DC values for Bacteria,
Archaea and Eukarya (shown in the third panel of Table
1). In this analysis, the three domains were pooled
together because not only there was no a priori evidence
suggesting subsample heterogeneity (with respect to DC
values), but an argument can actually be made that there
is even less stratification, as far as dual complementarity is

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/4

concerned, than one would generally expect for the three
domains. Indeed, direct cases of maintained dual complementarity, in spite of high variability of the second bases
in various Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya lineages (down
to the different species level), suggest that the dual complementarity maintenance phenomenon is largely invariant across (hence, independent of) the domains of life.
Therefore, stratifying by domains does not make much
sense, and might even prove harmful through its arbitrariness.

Results and discussion
Complementarity-based evolutionary link between the
acceptor stem and anticodon
The independence of the operational and classic codes
leads to certain irreconcilable contradictions (detailed in
[6,22]). Ever since the experiments uncovering the operational code were performed [2], it was obvious that the
simplest solution of the entire problem would be to have
an anticodon/codon homolog in the acceptor stem, as
close as possible to the CCA-3' end [5,14,15]. The optimal
location would be the very first 1-2-3/72-71-70 positions
of the acceptor stem [6,15], which largely determine the
identity of tRNAs. To the best of our knowledge, all
attempts to find any such straightforward homology have
failed. And yet, it is possible to observe still extant vestiges
of the ancient duplication when one considers the pairs of
consensus tRNAs with complementary anticodons: these
tRNAs turned out to be complementary at the second
position of the acceptor as well ([6], updated in [22]). The
ancestral tRNAs reconstructed from the phylogenetic trees
of Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya [24] strongly confirmed
this finding (depicted in Table 1 for all pairs of ancestral
tRNAs with complementary anticodons). It should be
noted that the DC values were miscalculated in [25]. The
primary reasons for the discrepancy were mis-determination (pairs 4, 18 in Table 1), mis-interpretation (pair 32)
and omission (pairs 9, 17, and 21). Additionally, the
ancestral bases reconstructed from the phylogenetic trees
(such as the ones used in this analysis) are more accurate
than the simple consensus majorities, especially if the
number of sequences is small (only 1,100 sequences were
used in [25]).

Worth noting are the pairs (underlined in Table 1) in
which one "partner" has different second bases in the
acceptor stem in different domains (for example, "G" in
Bacteria and "C" in Archaea) and the other partner possesses the domain-specific complementary second bases
("C" in Bacteria and "G" in Archaea, respectively). This
striking dual complementarity, which is maintained
despite the variability in the second bases, is observed not
only with the different domains but also even among different species within a domain. The pairs Val(GAC) ×
Asp(GUC) in bacteria and Ser(AGA) × Arg(TCT) in

are the ancestral second bases for pairs of tRNAs with complementary anticodons in Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya and their presumed
common ancestors (ordered from top to bottom for each pair). Plus and minus signs denote presence or absence of the concerted second base
complementarity, respectively. There is an apparent deficiency of anticodons beginning with 5'A, especially in the domains of Bacteria and Archaea.
As complementary partners, one can use (in such cases) anticodons that begin with 5'G, which allows a wobbling G-U pairing (in bold). Similarly,
one can also include the three pairs with "nonsense" anticodons (bold and italicized). The four cases of coevolutionarily maintained dual
complementarity, where the second bases change in different kingdoms, yet remain complementary in both tRNA partners are underlined.
Question mark behind + or - means that the corresponding assignment is likely, but not certain. "Incomplete" entry in columns 3 and 6 (such as "×
C" in column 6 for pair 22, third line) means that the corresponding tRNA was not found in the database. See Methods section for a detailed
explanation of how DC values were calculated.
b This pair (Ile × Tyr) was not used in the DC calculations because its status is uncertain due to the small number of tRNAs available ("ND" standing

eukaryotes are good examples (Table 1: pairs 14 and 17).
Furthermore, we show below that the dual complementarity is causatively associated with the sub-code for the two
modes of tRNA aminoacylation. In fact, it is the sub-code

that explains away rare deviations from dual complementarity.

Dual complementarity was detected for pairs of ancestral
tRNAs with completely complementary anticodons and
was not detected for pairs of tRNAs in which only the central bases of anticodons were complementary [22]. This
important difference suggests that the dual complementarity not only indirectly reflects the common ancestry of
operational and classic codes, but also might imply that
the ancestral code recruited new codons by complementary pairs (as opposed to one-by-one). There are at least
two possible mechanisms for such recruitment: (1)
through primitive in-frame translation from both complementary strands (before their differentiation into the
sense and antisense strands) [6,11,12,22,26,27] and/or
(2) utilization of the complementary pre-tRNA strands
arising through replication anyway [6,28,29], possibly in
the role of novel coenzyme (aa)-binding handles [16,17].
A pair of complementary 'codons' that was already captured by the evolving code would then generate (through
complementary mutations) the next, "daughter" pair.
Accordingly, we suggested two tetrads of amino acids that,
by fitting the above mechanism in the most parsimonious
fashion, might be the best candidates for the very first
amino acids recruited by translation [22]. These are
[Ala(GCC), Gly(GGC), Val(GTC), Asp(GAC)] and
[Ala(GCG), Arg(CGC), Val(GTG), His(CAC)] (codons are
shown in parentheses). As we shall see below, this set has
remarkable potential for building simple proteins.
The complementary pair-based scenario of early code
shaping renewed the interest in the division of p-aaRSs
into two classes, and suggested they originated from the
complementary strands of the same ancestral gene [3032]. The two classes of p-aaRSs coincide almost perfectly
with the two modes of tRNA aminoacylation, from the
major and minor groove sides of the acceptor helix
(shown in Figure 1 in blue and yellow, respectively). Out
of 20 amino acids, only three (all aromatic), Phe (class II),
Tyr (class I) and Trp (class I), have a mode of tRNA aminoacylation that is associated with the opposite class.
Another important piece of the puzzle is that p-aaRSs of
both classes are evolutionary latecomers among paralogous proteins [33], which strengthens numerous arguments in support of the hypothesis that, before the paaRSs advent, ribozymes acted as synthetases
[16,17,34,35], including both direct experimental evidence [36] and the line of reasoning stemming from the
two mirror symmetric modes of tRNA recognition by paaRSs [11,12]. Finally, it is remarkable that certain other
protein families also reveal this complementarity. Class I
p-aaRSs have obvious homology to NAD+- and NADP+ –
dependent dehydrogenases of the Rossmann fold [7],
class II p-aaRSs are homologous to the HSP70 family [31],
and it appears that in Achylia klebsiana a single gene
encodes for an HSP70-like chaperonin and a glutamate

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/4

dehydrogenase via its sense and antisense strands, respectively [31].
Sub-code for two aminoacylations
The major vs. minor groove side contemplation of the
genetic code revealed the symmetry (Figure 1A) that
prompted us to re-arrange the code table by putting complementary codons next to each other. This re-arrangement uncovered the "yin-and-yang" pattern (Figure 1B)
that represents the otherwise latent sub-code for the two
modes of tRNA aminoacylation.

Among many possible codes, the real genetic code (Figure
1A) shows a relatively high immunity to the effects of
mutations and reading errors [37]. The sub-code of aminoacylation (Figure 1B) adds to that by minimizing the
risk of confusion for 16 pairs of complementary anticodons that contain YR palindromes [12,13]. The "yin-andyang" pattern is perfectly symmetrical as far as switching
the "colors", i.e. the modes of tRNA aminoacylation
(major groove "blue"/minor groove "yellow", see above),
is concerned (Figure 1B). Therefore, the risk of confusion
might seem to be invariant with respect to this color/
mode switch. However, if one takes into account not only
the anticodons per se, but also the adjacent U and R (from
the 5' and 3' sides, respectively), the asymmetry of the risk
of confusion is immediately revealed (Figure 3). Here we
highlight the following aspects of the asymmetry:
1. The eight (blue/blue) pairs of complementary anticodons in quarter I of Figure 3 are associated with abiotically
synthesizable ("Miller") amino acids [38], presumably
evolutionarily early ones, including the likely earliest Ala
(GGC) × Gly (GCC) pair [26,27]. Remarkably, none of
the eight can be confused under any of the four scenarios
(Figure 3): both yellow (5' × 5'), both blue (3' × 3'), yellow
× blue (5' × 3'), and blue × yellow (3' × 5'), as if the anticodon did not play any role at all. The possible reason for this
anticodon-indifference is shown on the right (Figure 3).
The configuration of pyrimidines (Y) and purines (R) for
these pairs, i.e. 5'U-RRY-R3' × 5'U-RYY-R3', does not
allow confusion in aminoacylation under any of the four
scenarios. The robustness of these 5'U-RRY-R3' × 5'U-RYYR3' blue pairs is especially remarkable when contrasted
with the analogous 5' U-YRR-R 3' × 5' U-YYR-R 3' yellow
pairs in quarter IV of Figure 3. The latter are apparently
sensitive to misreading by the primordial synthetases.
Therefore, it might not be a coincidence that two of the
four confusion-prone triplets, UUA and CUA, are used as
the translation stop signals [12].
2. In addition to the quarter I, there are eight other pairs
of complementary anticodons in quarters III and IV that
cannot be confused under any of tRNA recognition scenarios (Figure 3). Interestingly, the pairs Asp(GUC) ×

Figureconfusion of complementary anticodons (at
nition by two putative r-aaRSs (adopted from [12]) the purine/pyrimidine R/Y resolution) under four scenarios of tRNA recogRisk of 3 (see previous page)
Risk of confusion of complementary anticodons (at the purine/pyrimidine R/Y resolution) under four scenarios
of tRNA recognition by two putative r-aaRSs (adopted from [12]). Pairs of complementary anticodons are ordered
following the "yin-yang" pattern of Figure 1B. Plus signs denote the pairs that have no identical tetra(or more)- nucleotides
within the loop 3' YU-XYZ-RN5' --- that is, they are distinguishable (under the corresponding scenario) by two putative
ribozymes that recognize the complementary tRNA halves. Minus signs mark the contrary, indistinguishable, cases. For each
pair, only a zero- or one base-long shift in one of two directions from the anticodon is allowed. Two simultaneous shifts (one
in each anticodon loop) are considered highly unlikely. All 32 pairs are divided in four quarters (enumerated I, II, III, and IV)
according to the sub-code for two complementary modes of tRNA aminoacylation. The earliest quarter is supposed to be I,
the latest, IV (see text for detail). The quarters II and III include 16 RY vs. YR-type pairs that satisfy the second rule of the subcode for two aminoacylations (see legend to Figure 1B). If, following Figure 4, we assign NGN and NAN anticodons to major
and minor groove sides, this would exclude the entire 3' × 5' scenario (shaded) and the number of conceivable scenarios of
tRNA recognition is reduced from four to only two (enclosed by rectangles). The actual evolutionary pathway is shown in
green.
a5'ANN3' anticodons usually do not exist – instead, the 5'GNN3' anticodons recognize not only the legitimate 3'C5' codons
but also the illegitimate wobbling 3'U5' codons. For the strictly legitimate nine pairs of the RY vs. YR type, the +/- ratio is 7:2
(second scenario) vs. 3:6 (fourth scenario) – the former being, therefore, seven times more "secure".

Pairs of pentanucleotides 5'U-XYZ-R3' on the right (with complementary anticodons in the center) show the risk of confusion
by r-aaRSs under the 5' × 3' scenario of recognition for the corresponding pairs from quarters I, II, III and IV. Compare the risk
of confusion for I vs. IV and II vs. III (see text for detail).
Val(GAC) and Glu(CUC) × Leu(GAG), often suggested to
be among the earliest amino acids [26,27,38] fall into this
group.
3. Recognition of anticodons by r-aaRS ribozymes was
likely based on the complementary base pairing [16].
With regard to G-C vs. C-G or A-U vs. U-A, the recognition
is symmetric. Why then was the recognition via the major
groove side assigned to the second column of the code
table (Figure 1A), i.e. central C in codons (G in anticodons), and not to the complementarily symmetric fourth
column? The same question arises for the first and third
columns. A possible explanation: the first and second columns might have been selected for the minor and major
groove sides of tRNA recognition because the risk of confusion of complementary anticodons was much lower
than under the seemingly symmetric choice of third and
fourth columns (Figure 4). In fact, this difference is rooted
in the fundamental asymmetry between the wobbling GU (still a pair) and complementary A*C (a clear mismatch) (Figure 4; see ref. [12] for details).
4. The differentiation of NYN codons into the major
groove (blue) NCN and minor groove (yellow) NUN
codons narrows the repertoire of subsequent evolutionary
routes to the pathway that has been actually chosen
(shaded green in Figure 3) by leaving only two options for
each type of complementary pairs (framed in Figure 3),
out of the conceivable four. In fact, this differentiation
makes the fourth scenario, 3' × 5', very unlikely, and the
advantage of the second scenario, 5' × 3', even more substantial (see [12] for details). Remarkably, this advantage

is associated with amino acids of high catalytic propensity
such as His, Arg, etc. [39]. Furthermore, these are the very
amino acids for which the cognate triplets (anticodons
and/or codons) occur more frequently in the aa-binding
centers of RNA aptamers than expected by chance alone,
thus suggesting that stereochemical affinity played a part
in shaping the code [40-42]. We think that it is not a coincidence that the risk of confusion for such "Yarus" amino
acids from the minor groove/major groove (yellow/blue)
5' × 3' pairs depends so much on the anticodons with
adjacent 5'U- and -R3' (in contrast to "Miller" amino acids
from the major groove/major groove (blue/blue) 3' × 3'
pairs).
The anticodon-flanking 5'U- and R-3' nucleotides appear
to determine the integral pattern of confusion risk for the
pairs of complementary anticodons shown in Figure 3. If,
for example, one flips these U and R nucleotides, the situation is reversed: the complementary anticodon loops
5'R-YYR-U3' and 5'R-YRR-U3' become the confusionresistant pairs, in contrast to the 5'R-RRY-U3' and 5'RRYY-U3' pairs, which now become confusion-prone
(under either of the tRNA recognition modes). However,
in nature these 5'U and R3' are conserved throughout all
tRNAs. Therefore, we speculate that during the genetic
code shaping process, natural selection favored the pairs
of complementary anticodons "adapted" to the already
existing adjacent nucleotides.
The above speculation makes even more sense if one takes
into account that it is precisely the 5'U- and -R3' flanks of
RRY (and complementary RYY) anticodons that could

The possible first tetrad recruited by the genetic code (top panel) (reviewed in [26,27])
The possible first tetrad recruited by the genetic code (top panel) (reviewed in [26,27]). Consistent with our
model, these four amino acids show dual complementarity not only in the legitimate Gly(GCC) – Ala(GGC) and Asp(GUC) –
Val(GAC) pairings but also in the Gly(GCC) – Val(GAC) and Ala(GGC) – Asp(GUC) pairings, with G-U and even A*C mismatch at the central position [22]. Accordingly, the Ala-Gly pair could generate the new Val-Asp pair via C→U and G→A transitions (ibid.) The Ala→Val expansion of the code is accompanied by a change of tRNA recognition from the major (blue) to
the minor (yellow) groove side, whereas the complementary Gly→Asp leaves the mode (blue) unchanged. This asymmetry
could be associated with a risk of pleiotropic tRNA mis-aminoacylations by ribozymes. The schematic below (under the tetrad)
(adapted from [12]) demonstrates this risk for Ala→Val and Gly→Asp expansions with legitimate (solid arrows) and 'wobbling'
(dotted arrows) recognitions of anticodons by r-aaRSs. The Ala(GCC) → Val(GUC) expansion is prone to multiple mis-aminoacylations of the old tRNAAla by the new r-ValRS (red dotted arrow). In contrast, the complementary Gly(GGC) →
Asp(GAC) expansion has no such disadvantage (green dotted arrow). To escape potential pleiotropic complications a different
mode of tRNA recognition is required that would safely distinguish the r-ValRS from the already established r-AlaRS. This is
precisely what happened: AspRS preserved the (same as GlyRS) recognition from the major groove (blue), whereas ValRS
adopted the recognition from the minor groove (yellow).

have provided smooth, sequential reading of codons in
the primitive translation ([43] see also [26]). In the evolutionary beginning of the translation the amino acid
assignments might not have been as specific as they
became later – what was important was the translation
process in itself, and the availability of amino acids.
Regardless, this configuration of anticodon loops possesses yet another substantial advantage: the lowest possible (zero, actually) risk of confusion of complementary
anticodons for the presumed early amino acids (Figure 3).
It is important to realize that this advantage might have
been crucial in the advanced RNA world, where ribozymes
used amino acids as cofactors [16,17]. Note in this regard
that, as a rule, pairs of complementary triplets encode the
functionally very different amino acids, most often those
with a high catalytic propensity (His, Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg)
contrasted with those with a low catalytic but high structural (beta sheet building) propensity (Val, Ile, Leu, Phe,
Ala) [39]. Therefore, it is clear that confusion of these
complementarily encoded amino acids would be of a
great disadvantage for riboorganisms. And, accordingly, it
would be of a great advantage for the RNA-based life to utilize
the 5'U-XYZ-R3' configuration of the anticodon loop and the
sub-code for two modes of tRNA aminoacylation even before the
origin of translation per se. This idea will be comprehensively discussed elsewhere [44]. Here we address the following questions:

(3) Why was the 3' × 3' option chosen if the three other
options (5' × 5', 5' × 3' and 3' × 5') seem to be equally
error-proof? Was this choice random or was(were) there
any selective advantage(s) behind it?

(1) Where from (and when) did these important conserved 5'U- and -R3' flanks of anticodons come?

originally the duplicate of the anticodon. Yellow and blue

minor groove (5') and major groove (3') sides, respectively.
The terminal NCCA, its presumable homolog GCCR and
complementary YGGC quadruplets are framed. Note that
the blue (3') half of the structure is a palindrome.

(2) For the 3' × 3' pairs of the first ("Miller") amino acids,
their anticodons contribute little (if anything) to the subcode for the two modes of tRNA recognition that protects
the tRNA pairs from mis-aminoacylation. Might this
imply that the recognition of these amino acids is
encoded elsewhere in the tRNA molecules?

Primordial palindrome of tRNA
Searching for the answers to these questions inevitably
brings us to the tRNA acceptor stem. Although the acceptor stem is highly variable, especially at the 4-5-6, positions [45], we reconstructed its common ancestor (Figure
5) from the phylogenetic trees for Bacteria, Archaea and
Eukarya (see Materials and Methods section above). The
5' part of the acceptor is a heptamer that consists of a
proto-anticodon (or codon) triplet (according to the dual
complementarity) and a quadruplet GCCR that is homol-

ogous to the universal NCCA 3' tail. Then, the 3' counterpart appears as a palindrome with a codon-like triplet in
the middle (Figure 5).
Two such acceptor stems with complementary second
bases (G and C shown in red) within the triplets that
might have had a common ancestor with anticodons are
shown in Figure 6. It should be noted that in modern
tRNAs the presumable codon/anticodon-like motifs that
are most frequent at this location correspond to Gly, Ala,
and Pro (all "major groove" amino acids), with the next
most common being Arg (a "minor groove" amino acid)
(see Figure 4 in [22]).
In our model, the first position of the acceptor corresponds to the first position of the anticodon that, in turn,
corresponds to the degenerate third position of codons.
Not surprisingly, because it is not essential for encoding
amino acids, this position in the acceptor is almost invariably occupied by the G-C base pair, "possibly for structural reasons to stabilize the end of the acceptor helix"
[46]. The second position of the acceptor is supposed to
be the most important position – both in the primordial
operational code, and in the genetic code (represented by
anticodons in tRNAs and codons in mRNAs) – for encoding group properties of similar amino acids. The third
position of the acceptor stem corresponds to the third
position of the anticodon that, in turn, corresponds to the
first position of codons, which is important for further,
more specific, coding. The classic example is the Ala-specific G-U base pair at this position (Figure 2) [2,4].
The symmetric location of the anticodon precursor at the
70-71-72 positions of the opposite 3' strand of the acceptor stem also makes sense [15]. At any rate, it seems reasonable to assume that the base pairs in the second
position of the acceptor stems made the most difference
in primordial RNA-mediated aminoacylation.
Importantly, to avoid confusion between two acceptor
stems with complementary second bases, both putative raaRSs must use the same groove side for tRNA recognition, i.e. major groove/major groove (3' × 3') or minor
groove/minor groove (5' × 5') scenarios (Figure 6A). In
these cases, the r-aaRSs encounter different second bases,
thus avoiding wrongly charging the acceptors with "complementary" amino acids. This is not the case under the
(3' × 5') or the mirror (5' × 3') scenarios.
Furthermore, let us consider the two acceptor stems in
which the GSS/SSC configuration at the 1-2-3/70-71-72
positions (Figure 5) is represented by the complementary
palindromes GCC/GGC and GGC/GCC, respectively (Figure 6B). A closer inspection of these two acceptor stems
reveals that the errorless (5' × 5') scenario of their recogni-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/4

tion does not differ from the (3' × 3') scenario. Indeed, the
two putative r-aaRSs (which recognize the acceptor stem
from the major and minor groove sides) are facing identical sequences (Figure 6B). Accordingly, these two r-aaRSs
were probably very much alike themselves. Thus, for complementary GCC and GGC triplets, the palindrome symmetry of the ancestral acceptor stem makes the primordial
two classes of r-aaRSs, and their modes of recognition,
functionally undistinguishable. The difference between
these modes of recognition does materialize, but only if
the proto-tRNAs gain, and incorporate into the recognition process, the single-stranded anticodon loop of the
5'U-XYZ-R3' configuration. All this might explain why out
of four options (Figure 3) it was the 3' × 3' scenario that
was "chosen" – in reality, there was simply nothing to
choose from!
At the same time, because the 3' strand of one acceptor
stem and the 5' strand of the other acceptor stem in Figure
6B are practically undistinguishable, each of the two
acceptors faces an increased risk of being recognized from
the opposite side by the complementary r-aaRS, thus
inviting erroneous aminoacylation. The risk appears all
the more real in light of the following considerations:
1. Substantial evidence points to the complementarily
encoded Gly (GCC) and Ala (GGC) as the very first pair of
amino acids that were recruited by the genetic code;
2. These two triplets are often found at the 1-2-3 positions
of the acceptor stem in tRNAs, and yet...
None of the pairs of ancestral tRNAs with complementary anticodons (including tRNAGly and tRNAAla with GCC and GGC,
respectively) has GCC and GGC at the 1-2-3 site of the acceptor. This inconsistency can be explained by an increased
probability of erroneous aminoacylation for the GGC/
GCC pair (Figure 6B). In fact, the complete absence of
GGC/GCC triplets in the acceptor stems of tRNAs with
complementary anticodons is another strong argument in
support of the decisive role of the acceptor stem in the
early stages of the genetic code evolution.
The (3' × 3') scenario efficiently discriminates the acceptors with complementary second bases. The symmetric (5'
× 5') scenario also appears to discriminate; however, the
presence of an unpaired NCCA-3' makes the (3' × 3') scenario more preferable for recognition by r-aaRSs.
This primary, anticodon-independent, choice of the (3' ×
3') scenario suggests that:
1. The operational code embodied in the acceptor stem is
very ancient, and the second base pair was originally the

only (and therefore the most important) base pair in coding.
2. Initially, the operational code was activated through the
degenerate, one-mode (from the major groove side) recognition of the acceptor – recognition that predated the
sub-code for two modes of aminoacylation. The sub-code
was established later when, as a result of duplication, the
single-stranded anticodon loop emerged.
3. The tRNA molecule might have started its evolution
into the extant cloverleaf structure from the acceptor arm
[4,47-49], although the nearly perfect symmetry of the
cloverleaf with the anticodon in its center makes the anticodon-first scenario also feasible [17].
We will compare the acceptor-first and anticodon-first
models elsewhere [44]. Here we would like to emphasize
that in any case the primary (3' × 3') "choice" in the acceptor stem turned out to be very "fateful" – it effectively
ruled out the (3' × 5') scenario (Figure 3: shaded column),
thus predetermining the subsequent genetic code shaping
(see [12] for detail).
According to the acceptor-first model of tRNA origin [4,6],
the invariant 5'U- and -R3' flanks of anticodons came
from the initial palindrome as the homologs of the basedeterminator N and its complement (). Fittingly, the most
frequent base-determinator is A (the second most frequent being G), and its complement is U (note that U can
form complementary pairs with G as well). Remarkably, it
is precisely these invariant U and A (sometimes G) bases
that adjoin the anticodon from the 5' and 3' sides, respectively. Therefore, it might not be a coincidence that when
(in some genomes) the tRNAs are encoded in pieces, the
major site of introns, splits on minigenes [50,51], and
processing in permuted tRNA genes [52] is located
between the 37th and 38th nucleotides. This is the position
that makes the lowest-confusion-risk (5' × 3') scenario of
tRNA aminoacylation by two putative r-aaRSs work, especially if these r-aaRSs are located in introns, in close proximity to the 37th nucleotide [16,17,53]. Furthermore,
consecutive duplications of the original palindrome (by
self-priming and self-templating) could produce the tRNA
cloverleaf of a full length (see Additional file 5). This cloverleaf has many of the extant tRNA’s invariant and largely
invariant nucleotides as well as sites of splitting tRNA in
pieces (see [50-52]). The sites are often located next to N
and , following the former or preceding the latter.
The sub-code of aminoacylation is correlated with dual
complementarity
The nature of selection is that it is strictly a tactical force –
it knows of no long-term strategy and has no foresight to
meet the future demands [54]. From this viewpoint, there

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/4

is a crucial difference between the operational code mediated by p-aaRSs and its remote ancestor mediated by raaRSs. Obviously, the enzyme p-aaRSs, even in their primal simplicity, could not have appeared before translation. On another hand, since nothing in nature evolves
with foresight, the putative ribozyme r-aaRSs not only
could but must have emerged before translation and, as
shown in Figs. 5 and 6, this primordial ribozyme-mediated operational code in the acceptor stem could indeed
predate the translation associated with anticodons. Therefore, it appears that the leading role in maintaining the
specificity of tRNA aminoacylation must, at some point,
have passed from the acceptor stem to the anticodon and
then, after the genetic code established its complementary
core, must have returned back to the acceptor stem
(accompanied by the r-aaRS → p-aaRS transition). This
sequence of events is reflected (approximately bottom-totop) in Figure 3. Worthy of emphasis here is the evolutionary continuity that preserved (well) the two complementary modes of tRNA recognition by aaRSs while
undergoing the ribozyme → enzyme reinvention.
The sub-code for the two modes of tRNA aminoacylation
appears to have little to do with complementary anticodons in two situations: (1) when the anticodon loop and
stem had not yet emerged (Figs. 5, 6), and (2) when the
anticodons existed, but they had a high risk of confusion
under most of the scenarios of tRNA recognition (meaning "three minuses" in Figure 3, columns 3–5). If, in the
first situation, the same mode of recognition of ancestral
acceptor stems (major groove/major groove) with complementary second base pairs helped to decrease mis-aminoacylation as Figure 6 suggests, then one would predict
for the second situation that, symmetrically, the acceptor
stems with the same second base pair need different
modes of recognition to minimize the risk of confusion.
However, having the same second base pair means a lack
of dual complementarity. Interestingly, in major groove/
minor groove YGN × CR pairs of anticodons with a "threeminus" risk of confusion (quarter II in Figure 3) dual complementarity is absent (Ala(UGC) × Cys(GCA) and
Thr(CGU) × Arg(ACG)) or indistinct (Thr(UGU) ×
Cys(RCA)). This can be compared to the perfect dual complementarity of Leu(CAR) × Gln(YUG) pairs (quarter IV
in Figure 3) – these pairs are also "three-minus", but in
contrast to the aforementioned major groove/minor
groove YGN × CR pairs, Leu(CAR) and Gln(YUG) are
both recognized from the same groove (minor). Having
complementary second bases in their acceptor stems
would protect them from being incorrectly recognized by
aaRSs, and this is exactly what we observe.
Also relevant is that the first and third columns of the
genetic code table (NAN and NUN anticodons) reveal the
dual complementarity much better than the second and

Page 15 of 30

Biology Direct 2009, 4:4

forth columns (NGN and NCN anticodons) (Table 1, see
also [22]). This difference can be explained if one takes
into consideration that the sub-code for the two modes of
tRNA recognition discriminates the minor groove/major
groove NAY × RUN pairs (quarter III in Figure 3) better
than their major groove/minor groove YGN × CR counterparts (quarter II in Figure 3).
Dual complementarity of the second bases might be a vestige of ancient duplication (that shaped the tRNA molecule as a bi-functional adaptor of the genetic code) and inframe translation of both, sense and antisense, strands of
the first protein-encoding genes [12,22,24]. Obviously,
the dual complementarity is still preserved by natural
selection because of the importance of the second base in
coding, in accordance with the principle of evolutionary
continuity [55]. Yet, this preservation is not perfect (Table
1), and it is the sub-code for the two mirror tRNA aminoacylations that explains why dual complementarity is still
present for certain pairs of complementary anticodons,
and not for others. Incidentally, this means that testing
the dual complementarity for statistical significance with
the 0.5 confidence interval might be too conservative – in
some cases dual complementarity might have been lost
secondarily, to fit the sub-code of two aminoacylation
modes, and, therefore, some sort of conditional/nested
probability model should be assumed instead of independence.
In general, the cases of violated or questioned dual complementarity are associated with (1) the cases of mixed-up
aaRS class membership and mode of tRNA aminoacylation, i.e. the three aromatic amino acids, Phe, Trp, and
Tyr, all presumably of late recruitment [27] and/or (2) the
absence of strict complementary partners for the anticodons NNU (this is most pronounced for Thr) (Table 1). If
such cases are excluded from the analysis, the dual complementarity is almost perfect (DC = 15/16 = 0.9375),
with the Cys(GCA) × Ala(UGC) pair being the only exception, which can be explained by the sub-code for two
modes of tRNA aminoacylation.
The first amino acids could have gained their anticodons
before translation
The lack of "evolutionary foresight" necessarily implies
that the genetic code, at least in the key features of its
"codon-to-aa" assignment (Figure 1), was at first evolving
not in anticipation of the catalytic advantage of proteins
over RNAs, but simply in response to the current, pressing
needs of the RNA world, meaning that the origin of the
primary code preceded its use in translation [16,17]. This
is certainly true in case of the early ribozyme-mediated
operational code – it might not have served originally in
translation but rather in replication [47-49], in saving
some amino acids from leaking into the environment [33]

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/4

and primordial catalysis [16,17]. In the latter, Coding
Coenzyme Handles (CCH) model, ribozymes use amino
acids as cofactors through their direct stereochemical
affinity-based interaction with anticodon triplets [16,17].
Consistent with the hypothesis of pre-translation coding,
the heptamer and 11-mer palindrome parts of the ancestral acceptor stem have already contained the codon/anticodon-like triplets with adjacent base-determinators.
Note in this regard that the debate which of the genetic
codes, classic or operational (associated in tRNAs with the
anticodon and acceptor stem, respectively), came first is
somewhat pointless, as these two codes have diverged
from a single ancestor. Not at all pointless, though, is the
following question: In which direction did proto-tRNA
molecules co-evolve to reach the final cloverleaf shape –
from the acceptor (with subsequent gain of the anticodon) or the opposite – from the anticodon (with subsequent gain of the acceptor)? The ancestral palindrome
(Figure 5) when considered together with the sub-code for
two modes of tRNA aminoacylation and the risk of confusion of complementary anticodons (Figure 3) support the
acceptor → anticodon model of tRNA evolution. After all,
this model is more consistent with the expansion of the
genetic code from the original {G,C} alphabet (to which
the repertoire of triplets at 1-2-3 positions was constrained in the double-stranded acceptor) to the final
{G,C,A,U} alphabet (possible only in single-stranded antcodons) than the anticodon → acceptor model that
implies the reverse, namely {G,C,A,U} shrinking into
{G,C} [56]
Care must be taken in the historical reconstruction of the
processes that have shaped the code. For example, we do
not know the real relevance for the Miller-type experiments for the origin of life (cf. [57]); hence we do not
know whether "Miller" amino acids are relevant to the
beginnings of genetic code evolution. Also, as the genetic
code is likely to have evolved in the context of protocells
with complex RNA-catalyzed metabolism [54,58] amino
acids produced by such a metabolic network may only
partly coincide with the list of prebiotiotically produced
ones (by whatever chemical scenario; cf. [59]).
The present paper suggests that the acceptor stem is historically the first, which raises the question about the functional advantage of such an early assignment. Details of
this question will be analyzed elsewhere [44], but we tentatively make a suggestion right away. It has been shown
by logical arguments that a prolonged coevolution of metabolic networks with membranes is likely to have taken
place [60], which makes it likely that selective retention of
important metabolites like some amino acids by binding
them to, say, RNA molecules was of a selective advantage
[33]. It is instructive to look at the first tetrad of amino
acids (Gly, Ala, Asp, Val), suggested here, from this point

Page 16 of 30
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:4

of view. First, some amino acids are needed for nucleotide
synthesis, so they are likely to have been important compounds in the RNA world without and before translation
or even a catalytic role: Gly and Asp are important here
(the glutamine/glutamic acid pair is used for amination
only). Another likely constraint is coenzyme synthesis
[58]. For example, the biosynthesis of coenzyme A
requires Val, Asp and Ala. Further analysis will be provided elsewhere, but this already shows that all members
of the first tetrad were metabolically important. It is also
logical that a leaky membrane selects first for the selective
retention of those amino acids that are most prone to leak
out: Gly and Ala from the list.
This suggests a refinement of the coding coenzyme handle
(CCH) hypothesis, which can now be broken down into
two main steps: (1) Some amino acids (most likely Gly
and Ala in the first tetrad) were first linked to short acceptor stem-like structures envisaged in this paper. This must
have happened already in a coded fashion. Why? Because
it were the other ribozymes that used them for functions
(such as nucleotide and coenzyme synthesis). It would
have been disadvantageous for the ribo-organisms to have
highly ambiguous charging, as already stated in original
CCH hypothesis [16]. In this stage the primordial adaptors acted as cofactors exercising group transfer, the
groups being amino acids. (2) Presumably recruitment of
Asp and the second tetrad (with Arg and His as new members) coincided with the origin of the anticodon loop. It
was at this stage that the mechanism of the original CCH
hypothesis stepped in: (some) amino acids were now
used for catalysis (beyond group transfer: Asp would have
had dual functionality), but they were presumably recognized by synthetases and other ribozymes in metabolism
via the anticodon loop at this stage.
This revised version of the CCH hypothesis is consistent
with all the findings of the present paper. We note that it
does not leave much room for classical ambiguity reduction: there would have been selection for reduced ambiguity all along, within the constraints given by an evolving
recognition machinery (cf. [61]).
Complementary pairing of nucleotides is probably the
most fundamental feature of life and all our results
described above indicate that the genetic code itself, as
well as the structures and functions of its main adaptors,
tRNA and aaRS, have retained imprints of this fundamental complementarity (see also [11-13,22,26-29]). Moreover, approaching the genetic code from this angle might
suggest some unexpected novel answers to old, longstanding questions. For example, if the code did predate
the translation, then why as triplets? Indeed, in this case
we simply cannot invoke any mechanistic or logistic criteria rooted in the optimality of the translation process

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/4

itself. There must have been something else in having the
three-letter coding "words" that provided intrinsic advantage(s) over the two- or four-letter ones. In addition to the
already reported advantages [16,17], we propose here one
more: the three-letter "words" in the U, C, A, G alphabet cannot be self-complementary, whereas the two- and four-letter
ones definitely can be. Dinucleotides CG, GC, UA, AU and
tetranucleotides CGCG, GCGC, AUAU, CCGG, etc., are
perfectly self-complementary palindromes (for example, a
complementary partner of CG is, again, CG). We shall discuss the disadvantages of such codes (compared to the triplets) elsewhere. Here we will demonstrate only one of
them. According to [41,42], the aa-binding sites of RNA
aptamers (selected in vitro) contain, more frequently than
by chance alone, their cognate triplets, mostly anticodons.
One would suppose that putative r-aaRSs could have had
such sites. Does it explain why the code is triplet? No,
because what really determines the code's "-pletness" is
the anticodon of proto-tRNAs and, symmetrically, the
anticodon-binding site in r-aaRSs. Consider pairs of raaRSs with complementary aa-binding sites that recognized, however, self-complementary anticodons in the
duplet or quadruplet codes. These hypothetical codes
would pose a much higher risk of confusion and misaminoacylation by such pairs of charging ribozymes (and,
later on, enzymes as well) compared to the real, triplet
genetic code. (Of course, a quintuplet code, or any other
"odd" code for that matter, would also avoid this confusion disadvantage – however, the triplet code is already
sufficiently redundant and robust, so any extra complexity
would not be of any selective advantage.)

Conclusion
Thus, although the {G, C} operational and {G, C, A, U}
classic codes play a crucial role in translation, their origins
from a common ancestor could have been necessitated by
the various pressures and challenges of the preceding RNA
life. Moreover, the 5'U-XYZ-R3' configuration of the anticodon loop and, accordingly, the sub-code for two complementary modes of tRNA aminoacylation might have
originated (and been used by the RNA life) also before
translation simply in order to distinguish amino acids
with a high catalytic propensity (as ribozyme cofactors)
from their complementary partners with a high beta sheet
building propensity.
Further investigations, both in silico and in the lab, are
needed to determine the comprehensiveness of the primary repertoire of proto-anticodons that could have been
established before translation. However, it is clear a priori
that "at some early stage in the evolution of life the direct
association of amino acids with polynucleotides, which
was later to evolve into the genetic code, must have
begun" [62]. In up-to-date terms, the r-aaRSs had to have
a site with affinity for a cognate amino acid, perhaps

through direct stereochemical key/lock-like binding. Any
stereochemical mechanism has less than perfect accuracy
due to the finite difference in binding energy between cognate and non-cognate amino acids [16]. On the other
hand, it is equally clear that even for the {G,C,A,U} code
associated with anticodons, this specificity may have
never reached its possible limit. This is because of the editing of aminoacylation, as we know it now (reviewed in
[3]). This editing suggests that the hypothetical ribozymemediated tRNA aminoacylation may have been, at least
for some amino acids, less specific than today – its specificity could not, for example, have exceeded that of the
Aquifex aeolicus LeuRS with its CP1 domain editing the
charged and mischarged noncognate tRNAVal and tRNAIle
[63]. Otherwise, how/why would the r-aaRS → p-aaRS
transition need to occur in the first place? Indeed, if it is
assumed that the primordial r-aaRS-mediated code had, at
some point, achieved the perfect recognition of all 20
amino acids, then it is difficult to imagine the selective
advantage(s) of transitioning from these perfectly specific
ribozymes to the isofunctional proteins without editing.
Some sort of co-evolution between the first p-aaRSs and
the genetic code shaping must have occurred. And it is
during this co-evolution that the code (possibly even
expanded compared to its initial complementary core
shown in Figure 1B) continued gaining specificity (see
also [3,11,22,32]).

Reviewer Comments
The origin of the genetic code remains a mystery, despite
its centrality to biology. In this manuscript, Rodin et al.
reconstruct the ancestral sequence of various tRNA molecules, revealing a palindromic structure in the reconstructed ancestral sequences. They use this model to
propose a pathway for the addition of amino acids to the
genetic code, linking the model to Szathmary's Coding
Coenzyme Hypothesis (the idea that the primordial function of the (anti)codon-amino acid linkage was to deliver
amino acids as coenzymes for ribozymes, and that this
system was later co-opted for translation).

Reviewers' comments
We are grateful to the reviewers for their thorough and
thoughtful analysis and critique of our manuscript. We
largely agree with all of the reviewers' comments, and

One problem that should be corrected is the 1980s view
of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. We now know that
there are more than 20 amino acids incorporated cotranslationally, that there are both class I and class II LysRS
activities, many organisms are missing some of the synthetases, etc. If the authors want to argue that the classical
picture is ancestral, some data to this effect is really
needed. I think it is essential either to recognize the diversity and complexity of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis
process (as seen in e.g. recent work from the Soll and Ibba
labs) or to explicitly make the case that the idealized picture used in this paper really was the ancestral state relevant to the origin of the code. Along these lines, I was also
surprised not to see reference to work on the Suga lab on
the evolution of tRNA-aminoacylating ribozymes.
Authors' Response
We are certainly aware of work from Soll and Ibba labs (as
well as Suga's work – see below our reply to the 3rd
reviewer). Needless to say, the synthesis of aa-tRNAs
(interface between mRNA and proteins) is much more idiosyncratic than we thought it was (in say, early 90s). However, we don't necessarily think that this (presently
appreciated) diversity and complexity needs to be contrasted with the classic "idealized" picture of 20 aaRSs
evenly divided in two nearly even classes with mutually

mirror modes of tRNA recognition. All known deviations
from this 10:10 symmetry are subsidiary to the sub-code
for two modes of tRNA aminoacylation revealed by us and
are partly discussed in previous reports [11,12]. More specifically, these deviations involve both canonical (Cys,
Gln, Asn) as well as noncanonical (Sec, Pyl) amino acids
that are commonly considered as relative latecomers in
translation. Note that their late recruitment is accepted by
Soll and Ibba as well (see, for example, [64,65]). Especially telling in this regard is the direct Gln-tRNA formation by GlnRS in eukaryotes versus its indirect synthesis in
many bacteria via Glu-tRNAGln intermediate followed by
transamidation routes: remarkably, this difference correlates with the 2nd base of the acceptor stem – absence/
presence of dual complementarity in (Leu × Glu) and (Leu
× Gln) pairs (Table 1). We will discuss the possible advantages of this difference in a forthcoming report. Here, we
would like to note that while stressing the diversity of aatRNA synthesis for some amino acids in different kingdoms, Ibba and Soll nevertheless put a strong emphasis
on the fact that with respect to tRNA recognition, class I
and II aaRSs look like mirror images of each other – the
fundamental property that likely reflects their origin
(ibid). And, our main ideas and findings are reliant only
on just this core complementarity of the genetic code
organization.
Reviewer Comments
Not enough detail is given for the methods. For example,
how was consistency between tree topologies measured,
and what threshold was used to determine acceptability?
Were the results robust to changes in the reconstruction
method and, critically, the substitution model? (One key
weakness of most available techniques is that they assume
a constant nucleotide substitution process, which we
know is not accurate for the diversity of modern genomes
due to the heterogeneity of GC contents – software such
as Galtier's phylo_win gets around this but may not scale
to datasets this large). In cases where multiple tRNAs with
the same specificity exist, what decisions were made about
which paralogs to align?
Authors' Response
We agree that more detailed description of the phylogenetic analysis would be beneficial – we simply thought
that much of the target audience might not be interested
in technical detail in a first place. Here is a brief summary:

We used primarily three software packages: proprietary
software by one of the authors that implements a fast variant of ME method, Mega 4 (NJ and ME) and, coincidentally,
Phylo-win
http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/
phylowin.html. We also used DNAML (from PHYLIP,
http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html)
and
PAML
http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/4

paml.html, but these were very slow, so we did not analyze the datasets in their entirety. The condensed (multifurcations instead of bifurcations for bootstrap values <
50%) trees were largely invariant to the method choice
except the bacteria trees that showed variation (dT = 4 and
6 for some comparisons). It was the same with respect to
the substitution model choice. We went through a full
range of appropriate (e.g., not codon-based, etc.) models
available, including Galtier and Gouy, and only condensed bacteria tree showed variation (dT = 2, 4 and 6 for
some comparisons). Importantly, this did not change our
main conclusions (see below).
For the actual trees to be included in the manuscript, we
selected Mega 4 NJ with Tamura-Nei distances for the
three reasons: first, Mega NJ implementation is a popular
and convenient one, thus enabling the readers to easily
duplicate or (built upon) our results; second, TN distance
is a robust compromise between too-simple on one side
and possibly overfitting on the other side models; third,
the topologies were consistent with the ones obtained in
previous studies using different (genomic, etc.) methods
(see, for example, [21]).
In general, it is unclear which method/model is "the best"
for tRNA phylogenetic analysis. In our forthcoming (and
substantially more technical) manuscript on tRNA evolution we will, among other things, touch on this issue.
About the paralogs: some of these cases might have represented pseudogenes. There were no strict rules for choosing "true" paralog(s). However, all other things being
equal, the likely pseudogenes (with strongly distorted secondary structure) were manually removed (thus not contributing to the phylogenetic tree reconstructions and DC
calculations).
Reviewer Comments
What criteria were used in the manual assignment of
ancestral states, and how did this manual assignment
compare to model-based approaches such as likelihood
and Bayesian approaches? (These are much slower, and
might not be feasible for the full dataset, but could certainly be used to validate the manual methodology on a
subset.) The claims made in the paper about the conservation of very deep palindromic structure are surprising, and
the reader needs to be reassured that the results are robust
to the many choices that can be made in this type of phylogenetic analysis.
Authors' Response
This is a very good point and we actually did validate our
manual methodology by applying PAML to the subset of
the Eukarya dataset. (We plan to apply model-based
approaches, Bayesian and likelihood-based, to the data-

sets in their entirety in the future – time, computational
resources and scalability permitting). Our manual reconstruction relied on simple Fitch's parsimony-based
method [23] and can be essentially summarized as a
"common sense" union/intersection algorithm. In addition, one could also construct straightforward consensus
sequences, but these would be more biased than the
ancestral sequences due to the fact that some subgroups of
species are relatively over- or underrepresented in the
tRNA database. Therefore, for the purposes of this report
manually reconstructed ancestral sequences made the
most sense. As far as "very deep palindromic structure" is
concerned, our analysis reveals that the CCR motif at 5-67 positions is very robust. However, while the CCR motif
is virtually "set in stone" in Archaea and Eukarya, it is less
robust in Bacteria – in the 5th position (for averaged isoacceptor tRNAs of 20 amino acids) we observe 10C to 8G
(with ambiguous 2S).
Reviewer Comments
I am concerned about the use of the binomial distribution
to assess statistical significance of the DC as it makes the
assumption that each pair of tRNAs is independent, yet
the same tRNA sequence contributes to many pairs. It
would be useful to check whether this violation of
assumptions matters by a Monte Carlo approach to derive
a null distribution empirically (in our experience, this
type of model violation can result in orders of magnitude
difference in apparent statistical significance in other
problems: it might not be important in this situation, but
then again, it might be). I would also argue that stratifying
by domains could be useful as you could then treat each
domain as an independent test of the hypothesis and use
Fisher's method to combine the probabilities (assuming
that there has been no horizontal transfer of tRNAs and
that the tRNAs in each domain for a given specificity are
monophyletic – on the other hand, you could certainly
make the case that these assumptions are not necessarily
warranted).
Authors' Response
We completely agree, and the work is actually underway
on deriving the empirical null. This will be one of the
focal points of our tRNA evolution manuscript that is now
in preparation (another point is discussed below). This
approach is both technically and computationally
involved, however, and at this time we decided simply to
give the readers the actual "bin counts" so that the readers
can decide for themselves – but we agree that binomialderived p-values might be oversimplified.

The idea to combine stratified test results using Fisher's
method is a good one and, frankly, did not occur to us.
However, we are almost sure that the assumptions will be
violated. For example, one can see the significant dual

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/4

complementarity separately for NGN × NCN and NAN ×
NUN pairs in domains of eukaryotes and eubacteria, but
only for NAN × NUN pairs (and not for NGN × NCN
pairs) in archeabacteria (Table 1). We are unable at the
moment to pin down the possible reason(s), although
our preliminary observations point to a possibility of lateral tRNA gene transfer as an interfering factor. Again, this
is something that we are working on right now as a part of
our methodological tRNA evolution study.
Reviewer Comments
The pathway for code expansion proposed is consistent
with the data presented, but I am unsure that it is uniquely
consistent. In general, there are so many pathways for
code expansion that have been proposed, all of which are
plausible within their own framework but all of which
disagree with one another to a greater or lesser extent
except for a few basic assumptions that may stem from
intuition and hence publication bias (e.g. the small
amino acids came earlier) that it is difficult to find this
particular pathway more convincing than the others.
Some sort of empirical test that would discriminate
amongst the various possibilities is really needed, but
beyond the scope of this paper.
Authors' Response
What the reviewer states here is undisputable. Evolutionary biology research is singular in that its results and
hypotheses are often impossible to validate. This is especially true for the early (and thus ancient) evolutionary
events, such as the genetic code origin, and is in sharp
contrast to the "standard" biomedical/genetic research
paradigm, in which validation is essential. Indeed, consider a study (fairly representative of the contemporary
biomedical/genetic research in general) where one aims
to find a gene influencing a certain human trait of interest
via either hypothesis-driven (e.g. candidate gene) or datadriven (e.g. genome-wide association) approach. Once a
gene is identified, one can validate it epidemiologically
(by replicating the association in a large independent
sample) or directly, by knocking out, rescuing, expressing,
etc., this gene in various animal models. This, obviously,
cannot be done with the genetic code origin research.
Instead, we must rely on indirect empirical tests (indeed,
beyond the scope of this paper), model selection/fit/averaging principles (Occam's razor, likelihood, etc.), and
plain common sense.

One of the authors is also interested in reconstructing
Bayesian networks from genetic epidemiology data – and
no matter how dimensionally "favorable" (few variables,
many observations) the dataset is, the robust reconstruction of the one "true" network is unlikely. However, many
robust *features* can be reliably inferred (using, for
example, bootstrap, just like in phylogenetics). Same with

the code origin scenarios: it would be presumptuous to
state "this is the only pathway!" However, some robust
features, common to various theories and pathways, do
exist. In our opinion, one such feature is the combination
of the dual complementarity, the sub-code for two modes
of tRNA recognition by present-day aaRSs (and presumably by their ribozymic isofunctional precursors) and the
hypothesis of in-frame usage of both complementary
strands of primordial genes [30-32] – all these complementarity-based findings are consistent with each other,
and can hardly be explained by chance alone (especially
the latter).
Reviewer Comments
It's not clear to me why catalytic propensity would leap
out as the explanation for separating the lists of amino
acids (His, Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg) and (Val, Ile, Leu, Phe, Ala)
rather than, say, hydrophobicity (which is known to play
a huge role in protein structure and is the one property
that invariably comes up as important in studies of code
optimization.
Authors' Response
First, as recognized (arguably somewhat late) by Kun et al.
[39], the coding coenzyme handle hypothesis generates
the prediction that catalytic propensities of amino acids
should not be distributed randomly in the genetic code,
and it is reassuring to see that this is indeed the case. Second, this automatically clusters catalytically unimportant
amino acids as well. The remarkable thing is that these
amino acids belonging to these two clusters have complementary anticodons. Third, the catalytically unimportant
amino acids turn out to be important in building scaffolds. Fourth, as enzymes are essentially catalytic amino
acids held in position by scaffolds, there seems to be a
seamless way to enter the protein world, by venturing into
the complementary worlds of structurally and catalytically
important amino acids at the same time, enforced by dual
complementarity. Fifth, although it is true that catalytically important amino acids are hydrophilic, this correlation is of course not surprising. As the Reviewer observes,
the question is which trait is primary. IF we accept the idea
that coded amino acids preceded translation and long
peptides, we believe the choice of catalysis over
hydrophilicity is more compelling because of the clear
nature of the selective forces involved.
Reviewer Comments
In general, I think the discussion could benefit from a
rewrite: the explanations given are typically plausible and
consistent with the story, but also consistent with many
other interpretations.

Overall, my opinion is that this manuscript provides an
interesting speculation on the origin and evolution of the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/4

genetic code rather than the last word. However, the ideas
it presents are certainly worth discussion and thus worth
publishing, especially once the issues noted above are
addressed.
Authors' Response
We definitely agree that this is not the "last/only" word.
We hope we made it more unambiguous in the discussion
above.
Reviewer's report 2
Juergen Brosius, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany
Reviewer Comments
It is highly conceivable that, for functional reasons, RNA
stems were aminoacylated long before the advent of templated protein biosynthesis. Even simple aminoacylated
stems in close proximity to each other could have been
involved in spontaneous peptide bond formation. Other
RNAs (a primordial ribosome) could have facilitated the
reaction (perhaps simply by bringing aminoacylated
stems into the required close proximity). This possibly set
the stage for the advent for templated peptide/protein biosynthesis and at this juncture, it is thought that the primordial tRNA stem with the operation code (the
"charging code") duplicated leading to the code, mirrored
by the anticodon in tRNAs. The authors argue that a single
base (tRNA position 2) and its environment point to such
an ancestry. Furthermore, the different modes of aminoacylation on different faces (minor versus major groove) of
the aminoacyl stem of tRNAs with class I and class II aaRSs
and their presumed ribozyme functional predecessors, raaRSs, might have had their origin in the avoidance of
mis-aminoacylation when complementary "codons" of
the "operational or charging code are involved.
Authors' Response
Not exactly so. Rules of the sub-code for tRNA recognition
by r-aaRSs are formulated for pairs of complementary
anticodons, and not for their possible double-stranded
precursors in the acceptor stem (even though different
faces of the acceptor, major vs. minor groove, do define
two sterically mirror modes of aminoacylation). What the
sub-code, in fact, does, it minimizes the risk of confusion
for complementarily encoded amino acids. However, it
turns out that for precisely the presumably earliest pairs of
such amino acids (Gly – Ala, Gly – Ser) this risk does not
depend much (if at all) on the anticodon loop. In contrast, the 2nd base pair of their acceptor stems does matter
here. Moreover, a closer inspection suggests that the major
groove side of tRNA recognition corresponds to the primordial operational (charging) code, whereas the minorgroove-side was brought into action somewhat later, after
the tRNA molecule has gained the anticodon loop.

Reviewer Comments
While the data are compelling and the underlying hypothesis well worth entertaining, there are a number of problems associated with this proposal:

1) Aminocylation of a primordial tRNA with a r-aaRSs in
trans with a reasonable amount of specificity would have
involved some complementarity between those two RNA
molecules and the acceptor "stem" should have had a different structures with at least a bulged operational code
area.
Authors' Response
This is a real problem and, obviously, solution(s) is(are)
to be found in the expansion of the tRNA molecule from
a primordial helix (Figure 5) to the extant cloverleaf. Supplemental figure 5 shows one of the models of this expansion that in fact combines (and is partly consistent with)
those of Bloch et al [66] and Di Giulio [15]. Other possible models of this expansion process will be presented in
our forthcoming paper. Here, we would like to note the
following:

First, it was emphasized in our recent paper ([12], p.351)
that "Watson-Crick pairing-based recognition of the operational proto-code by r-aaRSs might imply a local distortion of
the acceptor helix. Interestingly, interactions of typical class I
protein aaRSs with tRNAs do cause serious changes of the
acceptor stem end, including unwinding and disruption of base
pairing". Second, the signature of the acceptor arm is the
unpaired 5'NCCA3' tetramer, and it appears that the
reconstructed ancient heptamer might have already contained it (Figure 5). That is, before the formation of the
proto-acceptor helix, its single-stranded 5' half-precursor
could have been easily recognized by r-aaRSs via the usual
W-C pairing and more or less specifically charged at
CCA3' terminus. Third, it is clear that as soon as the double-stranded acceptor stem was formed, the primordial
charging code did require a local bulge-like distortion of
the stem, in order to (at least) maintain this recognition
by r-aaRSs. Remarkably, the dual complementarity might
point to the existence of such ancestral local bulges. Figure
7 shows why and how. If, in accordance with [26-29],
proto-tRNAs with complementary anticodons originated
concertedly as pairs of complementary (+ and -)
sequences, then the dual complementarity would be
observed if and only if the stem is distorted just at the 2nd
position (at least). Later, after the charging proteins supplanted their ribozymic precursors, such mispairings were
no longer required.
Furthermore, the most frequent at 1-2-3 positions of the
acceptor stem are complementary 5'GGC3' and 5'GCC3'
triplets. Figure 8 shows common ancestors for the corresponding acceptor arms (3' strand of each of them is a per-

precursors of existence of stem
The dual complemenarity might provide indirect evidence in support of the existence of small local
"bulges" in the earliest precursors of the acceptor
stem. (A) Shown is a pair of proto-tRNAs with complementary anticodons that has, in parallel, complementary 2nd bases
in their acceptor stems. When aligned head-to-tail, these
sequences reveal mismatches at the 2nd position (at least),
meaning that the two could not have originated concertedly
(as a pair) with one proto-tRNA being a complementary replica of another [26,28,29]. (B) The 2nd base pairs are identical
in these two tRNAS with complementary anticodons meaning that, in contrast to "A", their concerted origin is possible,
but the dual complementarity is not. We have noted this difference between A and B before, but interpreted it in a different way 2[6]. (C) In this case, proto-tRNAs with
complementary anticodons could originate concertedly (as a
pair of + and - sequences) but, in contrast to "B", their 2nd
bases in the acceptors are also complementary. However,
simultaneous maintenance of these two properties is possible if and only if there are local distortions of acceptor helices ("bulges") just at the 2nd position. Remarkably, such local
mismatches could facilitate recognition of anticodon precursors adjacent to the universal NCCA 3' terminus by putative
ribozymes with aminoacylating activity. The fact that the dual
complementarity does exist (Table 1) favors this ("C") case.

fect palindrome). What we have overlooked before is that
the dual complementarity (still detectable) suggests that
this pair of ancestors might have occurred in two versions.
In case of the variant shown on the left, the stem structure
is perfect, i.e., contains no bulges. However, because of
the palindrome-associated symmetry, there is a high risk
of confusion of these two acceptors if the cognate r-aaRSs
recognize them from the opposite sides. Accordingly, we
claimed the same sides as more suitable for recognition by
r-aaRSs (see text). In turn, of the two sides, the major
groove one appears to be preferable simply because it contains the unpaired NCCA3' terminus. However, again, just
because of the palindromic structure, r-aaRS of one acceptor has an increased risk to recognize its complementary
partner from the opposite site (see text for detail). And it
is probably for this reason that of all the pairs of tRNAs
with complementary anticodons none has GGC and GCC
triplets at the first three positions of their acceptors stems.

At any rate, any pair of proto-acceptors with GGC and
GCC was still confusion-prone for putative r-aaRSs (see
Figure 6).
Shown on the right (Figure 8) is another version, the one
that accords fully with the origin of proto-tRNAs as complementary images of each other [26,28,29]. This version
has mismatches C*C and G*G at the second position in
the acceptor helices. When compared to the left version,
the right version reveals a number of advantages. First, in
each of the two acceptors, major and minor groove sides
have precisely identical sequences for recognition by raaRSs, but if even the sides were confused, it would not
matter in this case (in contrast to the left case). Second,
there is no way of confusing the two acceptors under recognition by r-aaRS from complementary partners. Third,
due to this mismatch at the 2nd position, the major
groove side is apparently more exposed to r-aaRS (for rec-

(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:4

ognition) than minor groove side (which would not be
the case for the perfect acceptor stems in the left version).
Finally, acceptors with mismatches are generated by
duplications of the original palindrome (Figure 7). We
will consider this and some other models of tRNA growth
(from a proto-anticodon and NCCA to the complete 76
base-long molecules) in our next paper. Here we would
like to note that: 1) duplications of the palindrome on
one (+) strand are automatically accompanied by duplications of its mirror complementary image on the opposite
(-) strand, 2) this is one of the very few (at least to our
knowledge) ways by which different small precursors of
tRNAs (making up a primary genetic code, perhaps even
before translation) could in parallel, cohesively, reach the
final cloverleaf shape, and 3) this is precisely the way that
produces two acceptor stems with bulges at the crucial
location.
Thus, of the two variants shown in Figure 8, the one on
the right, with G*G and C*C mismatches at the second
position, appears to be better protected from mis-aminoacylation. Yet, we are unable to choose between the two
because if for the early, complementarily encoded (even
before translation) amino acids their proto-adaptors did
have these bulges, the latter were likely to proffer a very
short-term "advantage". At any rate, cases of such mismatches in the tRNA database [18] are too infrequent for
true "living fossils". Most importantly, no matter which
variant is in fact a true one, the very first adaptors for the
complementarily encoded amino acids were recognized
and distinguished by r-aaRSs via their acceptor stem, not
the anticodon loop – therefore, likely even before the
advent of translation.
Reviewer Comments
2) If the anticodon stem/loop and acceptor stem are
homologous (in the true sense of having common ancestry instead of merely sequence or structural similarity),
then the two codes a) shifted on the structure and b)
became double stranded in the acceptor stem, whereby
the proposed identity of bases in the acceptor stem with
the anticodon is much more difficult to reconcile.
Authors' Response
We do not really see the difficulty here because the two
codes, charging and classic, both have been initially quite
ambiguous. Among the evidence in support of such ambiguity especially telling is the fact that the concerted complementarity of 2nd bases in the acceptor is observed for
pairs of tRNAs with completely complementary anticodons, but is not observed for pairs in which only the central bases are complementary [22]. Also supportive
(though indirectly) is the fact that for the presumably
early amino acids, Gly, Ala, Ser, etc. (see quarter I in Figure

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/4

3), there were no reports (to the best of our knowledge)
on successful selection of RNA aptamers (see, for example,
recent reports from Yarus group) with significantly
increased content of cognate triplets in amino acid-binding sites. Actually, if the sub-code concept (Figures 1B and
3) holds, we should not expect to see such reports at all
[12]. Clearly, ambiguity of the primordial charging code
in the proto-acceptor has been reduced during the r-aaRSmediated expansion of the classic code in the anticodon
area (quarters II and III in Figure 3). The final shaping of
the code was likely taking place under control of the protein synthetases. But the latter are not necessarily needed
(or at least are not as much needed as the ribozymes) to
provide aa-specific recognition of tRNAs in the bulged
bases of the acceptor helix and/or in single-stranded anticodon loop. Experiments by Schimmel group [2-4] made
it unequivocally clear.
Reviewer Comments
3) Should complementarity of the primordial tRNA and
the r-aaRS not have played a role in this interaction in
trans, of what nature was the RNA-RNA interaction? Some
base fingers in the respective grooves might be possible
but without other interactions it might be hard to resolve
the problem of specificity. Perhaps the ribosomal RNA
structure with tRNAs bound might give us some insight.
Perhaps, this is the solution to the question of what was
the ancestor of ribosomal RNA. In the past, I entertained
RNA molecules akin to tmRNA, that could act both like a
tRNA and a mRNA [67]. Could r-aaRS have been the
ancestor of the primordial ribosome?

4) Back to the problem of aminoacylation: Perhaps, specificity was achieved by aminoacylation reaction in cis
(that is, tRNA was a self-aminoacylating ribozyme) which
would have rendered unnecessary the base-pairing (or
other specific interaction) between two separate RNA
molecules. In this case too, the molecule could have been
a rRNA ancestor.
Authors' Response
These two questions are interrelated. The self-aminoacylating tRNA as an ancestor of rRNA is an interesting
hypothesis, feasible for verification. The cis- and transpossibilities are also worthy of attention. In particular,
consistent with the idea of proto-tRNA as a self-aminoacylating ribozyme is the remarkable positioning of the
introns in tRNA genes, usually after 37th nucleotide, just
where the putative r-aaRSs could have resided ([53], see
also[16,17]). In addition, as we have mentioned before in
[56], if selective complexes of the C4N type proposed in
[68], with even a weak stereochemical affinity between
amino acids and anticodon-like triplets, did have
occurred at 1-2-3 positions of proto-acceptors, then neither cis- nor trans-acting amino acid-specific ribozymic

(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:4

predecessors of aaRS were necessary for the code evolution to get started – all the specificity required was provided by the primordial charging code in the protoacceptor. The dual complementarity basically supports
this idea. Furthermore, the perfect complementary symmetry of tRNA recognition by putative r-aaRSs points to
the possibility that one such tRNA could have originally
catalyzed the aminoacylation of its complementary partner and vice versa [56]. Thus, something like trans-"self"aminoacylation could have taken place at the very beginning.
At any rate, postulation of the ancient more or less specific
aa-RNA complex is unavoidable, never mind whether it
was a proto-tRNA itself or r-aaRS, and whether it provided
this specific charging in cis- or trans-position. More
importantly, while not denying any and all of the above
possibilities, we cannot yet imagine how the sub-code for
two modes of tRNA aminoacylation, dealing with complementary anticodon loops, could emerge without W-C
pairing-based recognition by putative ribozymes. It
should also be noted that in the model of ribosomal evolution [67] it remains unclear where the single-stranded
anticodon came from, whereas this is one of the central
aspects of this current study.
Reviewer Comments
"The complementary pair-based scenario of early code
shaping renewed the interest in the division of p-aaRSs
into two classes, and suggested they originated from the
complementary strands of the same ancestral gene [3032]." I followed these ideas 1.5 decades ago, when it was
suggested that genes encoding neuropeptide precursors
and their receptors were originally encoded on opposite
strands, ideas originally forwarded by J.E. Blalock. Not
much came out of it and I think they are far fetched. In the
simplest cases then, poly-Lysine should bind poly-Phenylalanine and poly-Proline should bind poly-Glycine or
even the grooves of polyU/poly(A) or poly(G)/poly(C)
RNA duplexes. One can always detect artifactual peptide
to protein or protein to RNA binding – if one wishes so.
Authors' Response
Our idea of the origin of two p-aaRS classes from complementary strands of one ancestral gene is based on the logic
premises and data [22,30] that have nothing to do with
the theory of mutual binding affinity of complementarily
encoded proteins. By the way, to the best of our knowledge, this theory was actually put forward as early as in
1969 [69]. While we do not necessarily share the authors'
enthusiasm for this code-based hydropathic anti-complementarity of amino acids, we would like to stress once
more that the ancient RNA world was likely much more
strand-symmetric with regard to the emerging code and
translation, so that both (+ and -) complementary replicas

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/4

of genes could have been used as mRNAs. In fact, it is precisely the continuing evolution and specialization of the
genetic code and translation that, among other factors,
made current "bilingual" life so much strand-asymmetrical.
Reviewer Comments
"Therefore, it appears that the leading role in maintaining
the specificity of tRNA aminoacylation must, at some
point, have passed from the acceptor stem to the anticodon and then, after the genetic code established its complementary core, must have returned back to the acceptor
stem (accompanied by the r-aaRS → p-aaRS transition)..."
and suddenly covered shorter or larger distances. First, a
short distance, then, after duplication, a large distance and
then a short distance again to the CCA end. This is confusing.
Authors' Response
In our opinion, there is no confusion here. These "forth
and back" passages of tRNA recognition reflect main steps
in evolution of the code mediated initially by aminoacylating ribozymes and then by their protein successors.
Undoubtedly, first protein p-aaRSs (of both sterically mirror types) could have appeared, and supplanted the isofunctional ribozymes r-aaRS, only when the latter have
already shaped the complementary core of the genetic
code (Figure 1B). This shaping minimized errors in recognizing and distinguishing just complementary anticodons. Also without a doubt, these first p-aaRSs were
simply too small to cover both major coding sites of
tRNAs – one (charging code) in the acceptor and another
(classic code) associated with the anticodon. However, at
that stage there was no need for such "prolonged" recognition – one code site was physically associated with
another one within the same tRNA molecule. The primordial charging code, located immediately next to the amino
acid attachment site, was obviously a better candidate for
the further tune-up during co-evolution with anticodons
under the control of first small p-aaRSs. Work by Schimmel group demonstrates that it is still the case for ten
amino acids (see [3] for review). For other ten, in order to
avoid mis-aminoacylation, p-aaRSs (as r-aaRSs before)
had to spread the tRNA recognition by adding (quite idiosyncratically) the anticodon-binding domain. Thus, the
acceptor-to-anticodon transition under p-aaRS control
recapitulates a similar transition under r-aaRS control
(but with the complementary core of the genetic code
already established).

Replication of any genome, no matter single- or doublestranded, necessarily passes through building a complementary copy. Single-stranded plus RNA sequences replicate through their minus replicas. We simply meant that
at the origin of the genetic code and translation both, +
and -, strands were not likely to be originally differentiated into sense and anti-sense ones.

The authors could possibly discuss [70] as well as [8].
Authors' Response
We intend to do just that in our forthcoming manuscript,
currently in preparation (it would be a better fit, thematically).
Reviewer Comments
"Indeed, if it is assumed that the primordial r-aaRS-mediated code had, at some point, achieved the perfect recognition of all 20 amino acids, then it is difficult to imagine
the selective advantage(s) of transitioning from these perfectly specific ribozymes to the isofunctional proteins
without editing." How about speed?
Authors' Response
Of course, speed could have been one of the advantages of
r-aaRS → p-aaRS transition, even though aminoacylation
by p-aaRS remains the slowest stage in modern translation. However, the first proteins encoded via r-aaRSs have
included... p-aaRSs. Replacement of these very first paaRSs synthesized with the help of slow but specific raaRSs by their analogs synthesized with the help of rapid
but less specific p-aaRSs (themselves) is actually similar to
mutations with pleiotropic effects which, in this particular
case (synthetases) would lead to the error catastrophe [1].
Reviewer Comments
"This means that in the very beginning of development of
the code, the choice between the two complementary
modes of tRNA recognition did not depend much, if at all,
on the anticodon loop." – if there even was one at that
stage!
Authors' Response
We are not sure that we understand the reviewer correctly... If we do, it should be noted that, actually, it was
this anticodon-independence that (among other indirect
arguments) led us to the hypothesis that operational
(charging) code embodied mostly in the acceptor preceded the classic code embodied in the anticodon.
Reviewer Comments
"It was obvious that the simplest solution of the entire
problem would be to have an anticodon/codon homolog

in the acceptor stem..." The authors should be cautious
and only use the terms homolog/homology if common
ancestry is really proven. Otherwise the terms (sequence)
similarity or complementarity, where applicable, should
be used.
Authors' Response
The reviewer is correct. Our "would be" was supposed to
indicate that what we were talking about was a hypothesis.
Reviewer Comments
"Recognition of anticodons by r-aaRS ribozymes was
likely based on the complementary base pairing [16]." I
thought it was always the recognition of operational codes
on the acceptor stem.
Authors' Response
No, and this misperception is important. Therefore, we
clarified the text and put a strong emphasis on the fact that
we estimated the risk of confusion for single-stranded
complementary anticodon loop (see Figure 3), not for
their hypothetical precursors in the acceptor stem.
Reviewer's report 3
Anthony Poole, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden
Reviewer Comments
This is a fascinating paper that builds on the recent comprehensive review by Rodin & Rodin in Heredity (2008;
vol. 100: 341–355). The key idea presented here by Rodin,
Szathmáry & Rodin is that the genetic code (i.e. that associated with codons in the genetic material, and anticodons on tRNA) and the operational code (whereby tRNAs
are correctly charged by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases)
share a single origin. Furthermore, the authors argue that
on current data it seems reasonable to conclude that aminoacylation predated cooption of primordial 'tRNAs' into
translation.

For readers who have not already read the Heredity paper,
I can recommend reading that first because much of the
material in the early part of the current paper is covered in
greater detail there. There is some overlap, but on balance
I think this is necessary so as to adequately introduce key
background concepts, along with several important recent
developments; unfortunately, to permit the authors to
adequately focus on the newer ideas presented here, some
of the review material from the Heredity article is covered
in a condensed form, which may make the paper difficult
to follow for those who do not already know the earlier
body of work. Still, I think this is more a consequence of
the complexity and size of the topic being addressed than
it is some shortcoming of the current paper.

Overall, I think the ideas presented here are plausible, and
extremely interesting, and the authors indicate a productive path that may be taken in order to arrive at a clearer
understanding of the origins of the genetic code. The argument that the two codes originated as a single code is elegant, and the available data do seem to support this
contention. One interesting aspect is the further development of the coding coenzyme handle hypothesis within
the context of the RNA operational code. In particular, the
order in which amino acids seem to have been coopted
into the modern code strengthens the idea that the earliest
usage of amino acids attached to RNA was in biosynthetic
and catalytic roles. A number of authors have previously
argued that an origin for the ribosome and tRNAs in replication seems likely. Considering briefly the genomic tag
hypothesis in the context of the current work, perhaps one
shortcoming of that model is that it is not clear a broad
repertoire of charged tRNAs need evolve, nor is an obvious explanation forthcoming concerning the stepwise
addition of amino acids to the genetic code. In contrast,
the biosynthetic/coenzyme view espoused by Rodin, Szathmáry & Rodin does provide that perspective, and is a
welcome development; the model presented here is on far
firmer ground than the convenient ordering of extant
examples of viral replication into a progression in an
attempt to account for the evolution of tRNA, as per the
genomic tag hypothesis. Having said that, I don't see an
obvious conflict between the idea that the decoding function of the ribosome was initially involved in replication,
nor that charged 'tRNAs' could have been coopted into
replication at some point in the evolution of this process.

encoded proteins; these may have been largely separate
and independent events.

One matter I wanted to briefly comment on regards the
possibility that the first genetically-encoded proteins may
have been RNA 'chaperones' [71]. In this model, exact
sequences would have been less important than general
attributes such as positive charge (thereby permitting
binding to and stabilisation of existing ribozymes or functional RNAs). One aspect of that idea that bugged me was
that amino acids such as arginine, which is prominent in
a wide range of RNA-binding motifs, and glutamine,
which can improve binding affinity (see [70]) are not
among the amino acids consistently argued to be the earliest additions to the genetic code. Yet the emergence of
low complexity peptides where exact sequence order
would not be crucial to function seems far more plausible
than the old idea that the first proteins would have been
catalysts. Rodin, Szathmáry & Rodin proposal that the
acceptor stem likely predates the anticodon loop, together
with the recognition that the two codes could have a single origin, is interesting in this context in that it seems
likely that a significant repertoire of charged tRNAs would
have predated protein synthesis, so my impression is that
there really is no conflict between code evolution and an
RNA chaperone function for the earliest genetically-

Reviewer Comments
A minor fact let for the discussion on page 12: in vitro
RNA selection experiments have been published that indicate ribozymes can perform aminoacylation (Lee, N.,
Bessho, Y., Wei, K., Szostak, J.W., and Suga, H. 2000.
Ribozyme-catalyzed tRNA aminoacylation. Nat. Struct.
Biol. 7: 28–33.)

Authors' Response
We share the reviewer's opinion that the earliest, pretranslation, acceptor stem – associated genetic code and
the RNA chaperone function of first encoded proteins do
not actually contradict each other; on the contrary, the latter rather complements the former when we think of the
RNA → RNP transition in general and the r-aaRS → paaRS transition in particular. More specifically, according
to [73,74], two "minimalist" complementary p-aaRSs
from the opposite classes might have simultaneously
made 'contact (from major and minor groove sides) with
one tRNA acceptor stem, thus covering and protecting it
like "chaperons". This chaperoning turned out to be quite
selective, consistent with the separation of each p-aaRS
class into three subclasses (Ia, Ib, Ic and IIa, IIb, IIc, respectively) – Ia synthetases can be paired with IIa, Ib with IIb,
and Ic with IIc, whereas binding of two p-aaRSs from different subclasses to one acceptor is sterically forbidden
(ibid). Remarkably, in full accord with this selectivity, the
ancestral acceptors more often than not have the same 2nd
base pair for the sterically compatible synthetases and different 2nd base pairs for the sterically incompatible ones.
Certain methanogenic archaeae give us a unique practical
demonstration of this possibility: a LysRS-like protein
(pLysRS), a homolog of subclass Ib LysRS that activates
the noncanonical amino acid pyrrolysine, together with
the regular subclass IIb LysRS can indeed bind simultaneously to the same tRNALys ([75], see also [3]).

Authors' Response
We have referred to this paper in our original communication on the sub-code for two modes of tRNA aminoacylation [11]. However, this is a very important work,
indeed (see also the first review), and therefore we made
the corresponding correction in this paper as well (see ref.
[36]).
Reviewer Comments
Finally, I did raise an eyebrow at the use of ancestral
sequence reconstruction in this work, but I don't think it's
crucial to the result reported here; it seems that there is
substantial overlap between consensus sequences and the
results from ancestral sequence reconstruction, and as the
aim is to try and extract some indication of the presence

of a functionally-important motif at the acceptor end of
the tRNAs, I think the approach used is probably sufficient
for the stated aim.

Supplemental figure five. One of the plausible models of elongation of
the ancestral palindrome (see Fig. 5 in the text) to the tRNA cloverleaf.
The model is based on duplications by self-priming and self-templating.
The final cloverleaf has many of the sites of splitting tRNAs on minigenes
in archaeal parasite Nanoarchaeum equitance 50 51, as well as the positions of processing in permuted tRNA genes from red algae Cyanidioschyzon merolae 52.

It may be useful to provide more detail on the ancestral
sequence reconstruction procedure – for instance, stating
that the trees were rooted (see Additional files 1, 2, 3 and
4). Furthermore, it wasn't clear to me whether the manual
reconstruction was solely using parsimony. I presume this
was the case, but it would help to be explicit.
Authors' Response
These are two very good points, also made by the first
reviewer. Accordingly, please see the detailed discussion
above.
