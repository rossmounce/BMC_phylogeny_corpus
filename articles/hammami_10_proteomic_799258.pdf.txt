Proteomic analysis of the metabolic adaptation of
the biocontrol agent Pseudozyma flocculosa
leading to glycolipid production
Research

Abstract
The yeast-like epiphytic fungus Pseudozyma flocculosa is known to antagonize powdery mildew fungi through
proliferation on colonies presumably preceded by the release of an antifungal glycolipid (flocculosin). In culture
conditions, P. flocculosa can be induced to produce or not flocculosin through manipulation of the culture medium
nutrients. In order to characterize and understand the metabolic changes in P. flocculosa linked to glycolipid
production, we conducted a 2-DE proteomic analysis and compared the proteomic profile of P. flocculosa growing
under conditions favoring the development of the fungus (control) or conducive to flocculosin synthesis (stress). A
large number of protein spots (771) were detected in protein extracts of the control treatment compared to only 435
matched protein spots in extracts of the stress cultures, which clearly suggests an important metabolic reorganization
in slow-growing cells producing flocculosin. From the latter treatment, we were able to identify 21 protein spots that
were either specific to the treatment or up-regulated significantly (2-fold increase). All of them were identified based
on similarity between predicted ORF of the newly sequenced genome of P. flocculosa with Ustilago maydis' available
annotated sequences. These proteins were associated with the carbon and fatty acid metabolism, and also with the
filamentous change of the fungus leading to flocculosin production. This first look into the proteome of P. flocculosa
suggests that flocculosin synthesis is elicited in response to specific stress or limiting conditions.
Introduction
Pseudozyma flocculosa (Traquair, Shaw, and Jarvis) Boekhout and Traquair, a basidiomycetous yeast originally
classified as Sporothrix flocculosa, is a powerful and specific antagonist of powdery mildew fungi whose mode of
action appears to be unique among other related
Pseudozyma species [1]. It is able to colonize powdery
mildew colonies within a few hours following its contact
with the pathogen and this ability was preceded and/or
facilitated by the release of an antifungal glycolipid. This
glycolipid, named flocculosin, was recently isolated and
purified from solid cultures of P. flocculosa [2]. Extracellular glycolipids are produced by a large variety of microorganisms and may serve different purposes to confer
fitness advantages. Interestingly, the structure of flocculosin is closely related to the cellobiose lipid, ustilagic
acid, produced by the plant pathogen Ustilago maydis [2].

In a previous study, the absence of growth factors contained in yeast extract, combined with high carbon availability were described as stress conditions inducing the
production of flocculosin in P. flocculosa cultures [3].
However, it is unclear how these conditions relate to the
antagonistic behavior of the fungus in nature.
In spite of recent technical advances in molecular biology, the molecular basis of metabolic changes of P. flocculosa under stress condition is poorly understood because
of the limited knowledge about the genetics of Pseudozyma spp. in general and of P. flocculosa in particular.
Recently, Marchand et al. [4] isolated and studied the
expression of a putative homolog of a cyp1 gene involved
in the biosynthesis of ustilagic acid in U. maydis [5]. They
showed a direct correlation between cyp1 expression and
flocculosin production in stressed cultures of P. flocculosa
but did not observe major differences in cyp1 expression
when the fungus was developing on healthy or powderymildew infected leaves. These findings offered a relative
appreciation of gene expression without information on

the post-translational modifications or the relative concentration of the gene products (protein). Given that no
strong correlation necessarily exists between the amount
of a given protein and its transcripts [6], an in-depth analysis of the P. flocculosa proteome under comparative conditions would provide more precise information and a
better understanding of the global cellular response of P.
flocculosa that can trigger its biocontrol activity.
The most common implementation of proteome analysis is the separation of proteins by two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis (2-DE) and their identification by peptide
analysis with mass spectrometry (MS) analytical methods. Upon encountering new growth conditions, the
microorganism under study will alter its protein synthesis
in order to adapt to the new environment. Thus, by
applying proteomic techniques such as 2-DE, different
protein patterns from the same organism exposed to different environments can be compared. For example, Böhmer et al. [7] were able to study the dimorphic transition
from budding to filamentous growth in U. maydis by
comparing the proteome maps of the two forms by 2-DE.
They thus identified 13 protein spots that were significantly enhanced during filamentous growth induced by
the bW2/bE1-heterodimer. A similar approach was used
to characterize virulence factors of Botrytis cinerea [8].
The objective of this study was to characterize the metabolic changes in P. flocculosa under two specific conditions inducing morphological characteristics conducive
or not to flocculosin synthesis. For this purpose, we conducted a comparative analysis of the protein profile of
each condition using a 2-DE approach. Taking advantage
of the recent sequencing of the P. flocculosa genome, proteins of interest were matched with predicted ORFs in P.
flocculosa and identified with a high level of confidence
based on similarity to entries in available genome databanks including that of U. maydis.

Materials and methods
Fungal material

P. flocculosa (DAOM 196992) was used throughout this
study. Stock cultures consisted of conidia lyophilized in
maltose (20%) and kept at -80°C as aliquots of ca. 1 × 106
cells. Mother cultures were obtained by inoculating 100
ml of YMPD medium (yeast extract 3 g/l, malt extract 3
g/l, peptone water 5 g/l and dextrose 10 g/l) in a 500 ml
baffled flask with one bottle of lyophilized cultures previously hydrated with 3 ml of sterile water. All culture
media ingredients were supplied by Difco (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Seed cultures consisting of sporidia, were prepared by inoculating 100 ml
of YMPD medium with 5 ml of a 3-day-old mother culture. The seed cultures were maintained on a rotary
shaker set at 150 rpm at room temperature and were

Page 2 of 9

transferred into a fresh medium every three days for a
maximum period of 30 days.
Culture conditions

Two specific culture conditions for P. flocculosa as
defined by Hammami et al. [3] were used in this study:
one favoring morphological characteristics leading to
sporidia production (control), and one favoring limited
germination of the spores and mycelial fragments with
associated production of flocculosin (stress). Briefly, 5 ml
of the seed culture were used to inoculate 100 ml of
YMPD0.5 medium (yeast extract 3 g/l, malt extract 3 g/l,
peptone water 2.5 g/l and dextrose 5 g/l) in a 500-ml baffled flask. To stress the cells into producing flocculosin, a
10-ml sucrose solution (10%) (w/v) was added to the
medium after 72 h, and this process was repeated 24 h
later. For the control conditions, no amendments were
made to the medium for the duration of the culture. After
120 h, the cell biomass was collected by filtration and
used for protein extraction.
Protein extraction

Fungal cells from both control and stress conditions were
ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen using a cooled
mortar. The extraction procedure consisted of protein
solubilization with phosphate buffer followed by protein
precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (TCA)/acetone
(phosphate-TCA-acetone). The cell powder (4 g) was suspended in 10 ml of 10 mM potassium-phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4) containing 0.07% w/v dithiothreitol (DTT)
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 200 μl of protease
inhibitor cocktail for fungi and yeasts (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO). The mixture was stirred at 4°C for 2 h and the
extract clarified by centrifugation (15 min, 20 000 g). The
supernatant was recovered and the proteins were precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of 10% w/v TCA
in acetone containing 0.07% w/v DTT. The proteins were
allowed to precipitate for 1 h at -20 C and the protein pellet recovered after centrifugation (15 min, 15 000 g) was
washed twice with acetone containing 0.07% w/v DTT.
The pellet was then solubilized in an electrophoretic
sample buffer consisting of 8 M urea (Sigma-Aldrich)
containing 2% (w/v) CHAPS, 0.5% (v/v) IPG buffer pH 310, and 60 mM DTT. Protein concentration in the samples was determined using the method of Bradford [9],
with ovalbumin as standard protein according to the supplier's recommendation (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Ca). Final
sample volumes of each extract were adjusted to normalize the amount of protein per sample to 300 μg/250 μl.
2-DE

For IEF, the samples were diluted in sample buffer containing a few grains of bromophenol blue, to a concentration of 400 μg/250 μl. The samples were then loaded on

Hammami et al. Proteome Science 2010, 8:7
http://www.proteomesci.com/content/8/1/7

immobiline IPG strips (13 cm) with a linear pH 3-10 gradient, and resolved using an IPGphor apparatus (Amersham Biosciences, Baie d'Urfé, Québec,). After active
rehydration for 12 h, IEF was performed following a voltage step-gradient (100 V for 1 h, 500 V for 1 h, 1000 V for
1 h, 5000 V for 1 h, and 8000 V to reach 47320 Vh). Before
SDS-PAGE, the IPG strips were equilibrated for 15 min in
a solution containing 6 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8,
2% (w/v) SDS, 30% (v/v) glycerol, and 60 mM DTT, and
then equilibrated for 15 min in the same solution after
substituting DTT with 5% (v/v) iodoacetamide (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO). The second dimension was carried out on a 1 mm thick 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel.
The gels were run at constant 30 mA until the bromophenol blue dye front migrated 2 cm from the bottom. The
proteins were fixed overnight in water containing 10% (v/
v) acetic acid, 50% (v/v) methanol on a rocking platform
at low speed. The gels were finally rinsed three times in
Milli-Q water and stained with the GelCode blue reagent
(Pierce, Rockford, IL) following the manufacturer's
instructions. Three replicate gels from individuals
exposed to the same experimental conditions were performed to allow for subsequent statistical assessments.
Image analysis and protein identification
P. flocculosa genome sequencing

Genomic DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy
Plant Mini Kit from a 10-ml aliquot of a 3-day-old culture
of P. flocculosa. Using 454 sequencing Titanium technology (454 Life Sciences Corp), the DNA genome of P. floc-

Page 3 of 9

culosa was sequenced at the Genome Quebec Innovation
Center (Montréal, QC, Canada). Briefly, 1.4 million reads
were generated and 80% of them were fully assembled
into 3410 contigs. Due to the large size of this genome (22
Mb), a long paired end sequencing approach was used to
arrange the contigs (order/orientation) into 1281 scaffolds. The sequences contained on these scaffolds were
used for protein identification based on matches with
predicted ORFs and extraction of the corresponding
sequences for further analysis (see below).
Protein identification

The 2-DE gels were digitized and analyzed using the Phoretix 2D Expression software, v. 2005 (NonLinear USA
Inc., Durham, NC). Protein spot intensities were normalized using the 'total spot volume' method (i.e., each spot
being expressed as a percentage of the total spot volume
on that gel) to account for variations in emission levels
between images, and a background subtraction was performed following the supplier's recommendations.
Detection by gel to gel matching was performed to identify differences among treatments. All matched spots
were detected on at least two gels from each set of three
gels (replicates). Protein spots for identification were
excised from the gels manually, and incubated for 15 min
in 250 μl of water/acetonitrile (1:1 v/v). After additional
washes in acetonitrile and 100 mM NH4-HCO3, the proteins were reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with
iodoacetamide, and digested to peptides overnight at
37°C with MS grade Trypsin Gold (Promega Corpora-

tion, Madison WI, USA). Liquid chromatography (LC)tandem MS was conducted at the Genome Quebec Innovation Centre of McGill University (Montréal QC, Canada), using a Q-time-of-flight (TOF) micro MS apparatus
(Waters, Milford MA, USA) and a Nanosource modified
with a nanospray adapter (New Objective, Woburn MA,
USA) to hold a PicoFrit column (BioBasic C18 packing, 5
μm, 300 Å). The inferred peptides were searched against
genomic data of the newly sequenced P. flocculosa database using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(BLAST) and the CLC Genomics Workbench software, v.
3.6.1 (CLC Bio USA, Cambridge MA, USA). Homologues
to the predicted ORFs were searched in the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database
and the Ustilago maydis database of the Broad Institute
http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/
ustilago_maydis/Home.html. Matched sequences in
these databases were further analyzed against the P. flocculosa genome to ascertain that they referred back to the
predicted ORFs.

Results
Culture conditions

Protein extracts from P. flocculosa cells grown under two
culture conditions were used for comparative purposes.
Under control conditions, the conidial cells (sporidia)
divided and maintained a yeast-like morphology without
producing flocculosin (Fig. 1a). Under stress conditions,
sporidia and mycelial fragments started elongating
(pseudohyphal growth), a condition leading to flocculosin production as evidenced by the presence of needlelike crystals (Fig. 1b).
Protein extraction and 2-DE

Total proteins were isolated from the cells of each culture
and resolved by 2-DE (three 2-DE replicate gels for each
condition) using IEF along a linear pH 3-10 gradient, followed by SDS-PAGE to resolve the proteins according to
their molecular mass. In brief, a comparative analysis of
the 2-D gels revealed striking qualitative and quantitative
differences in protein levels between the two treatments.
A large number of protein spots (771) were detected in
protein extracts of the control treatment compared to
only 435 matched protein spots in extracts of the stress
conditions, which clearly suggests an important metabolic reorganization in germinating cells producing flocculosin. A number of spots were selected for
identification to further characterize the proteome of P.
flocculosa actively producing flocculosin. Twenty protein
spots specific to [or up-regulated in] the flocculosin-producing treatment were first selected based on their
unique presence in the stress treatment, or based on an
important increase (= 2-fold, significant at P = 0.05) compared to control cells (Fig. 2). Ten additional spots were

Page 4 of 9

selected from control cells, based on criteria of uniqueness and high relative abundance (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3).
Protein identification

Of the 30 spots selected and partially sequenced by LCMS/MS (Table 1), 21 corresponded perfectly to a
sequence within a predicted ORF of P. flocculosa. For all
these 21 proteins, all short peptide sequences within the
same protein used for analysis were consistently and
uniquely associated with the same predicted ORF. In the
case of the nine [9] unmatched proteins, the MS/MS data
failed to generate the accurate peptidic sequences (nonsignificant score). Attempts to match those sequences in
the P. flocculosa genome were unsuccessful.
When the full sequences of the 21 identified P. flocculosa ORFs were analyzed against the U. maydis and NCBI
databanks, they all corresponded with the highest score
to an annotated protein of U. maydis (Table 1). A reverse
comparison of the 21 matching U. maydis proteins
against the P. flocculosa genome confirmed the specific
and unique association of these proteins with the respective ORF used for the initial analysis.
In all instances, the expression pattern of the identified
proteins in P. flocculosa was fairly constant from one
experiment to the next (Fig. 3). In general, our identifications revealed that most proteins induced de novo or upregulated in the stress treatment were part of carbon (e.g.
thiamine biosynthesis, transketolase), fatty acid (e.g. electron transfer flavoprotein) and biogenesis (e.g. Ras-like,
septin) metabolic pathways. By comparison, proteins specific to [or more abundant in] control cells (e.g. elongation factor alpha, ornithine aminotransferase) were
associated essentially with primary metabolic functions
such as protein biosynthesis and amino acid metabolism.
Spots F28 and F29 that were specific to the control treatment, were identified as being the same protein (phosphoglycerate kinase) in spite of their distinct migration
behaviour (Fig. 2).

Discussion
In this work, we have generated a first proteomic map of
Pseudozyma flocculosa, a biocontrol fungus known for its
antagonistic activity against powdery mildew fungi mediated, at least in part, by the release of an antifungal glycolipid, flocculosin. Our aim was to compare the proteomic
profile of cell extracts grown under two specific morphological conditions, including one conducive to flocculosin
synthesis, in order to gain a better understanding of the
factors that could trigger the biocontrol activity of P. flocculosa.
Our results highlighted important qualitative and
quantitative changes in the synthesis of individual proteins during the fungus' adaptation to a carbon-supplemented medium leading to flocculosin synthesis. As a

first observation, we noted a clear decrease in the total
number of proteins in the stressed cells, compared to
control cells. This is indicative of an important reduction
in certain metabolic activities that would be linked with
the release of stress metabolites, namely flocculosin. Incidentally, Mimee et al. [10] have recently proposed that
flocculosin could serve both roles of niche protection and
food reserve under limiting conditions. This difference in
metabolic behaviour was also accompanied with a gradual transition from the yeast-like to the filamentous form
(see Fig. 1), the latter only being apt to produce flocculosin. While this transition step is not accompanied by an
increase in biomass, as would be expected in typical filamentous fungi such as molds, Hammami et al. [3] sug-

gested that it was induced as an adaptation/protection
stage to a new environment for the epiphytic fungus. In
line with these observations, some proteins associated
with flocculosin biosynthesis in P. flocculosa were
detected specifically in cells producing the glycolipid. For
instance, a septin-like protein was recorded exclusively in
cells grown in the carbon amended medium. Septins are
GTPases that form filaments in fungi and animals, and
are thought to function in controlling cytokinesis and
coordinating nuclear division and membrane movement
[11,12]. Together with septin, we also detected a Ras-like
protein reported to promote filamentous growth in U.
maydis [13].

Given that flocculosin synthesis was supported by Cfed-batch, it is also normal that several protein activities
found in this treatment were linked to carbon metabolism. The expression levels of transketolase and transaldolase, for instance were 2 and 2.5 fold higher,
respectively in the flocculosin-inducing medium. These
two enzymes are involved in the non-oxidative part of the
pentose phosphate pathway. The pentose phosphate
pathway involves two steps: the first one (oxidative part)
metabolizes glucose-6-phosphate to ribulose-5-phosphate, the principal carbon source for nucleotide synthesis and NADPH for reductive reactions in biosynthesis
and perhaps for hydroxylation [14]. When the cell is not
in suitable conditions to produce biomass, ribulose-5phosphate joins the second step of the pathway (non-oxidative part), to be converted to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and two fructose-6-phosphate. The detection of
thiamine biosynthesis activity in the flocculosin inducing
medium is consistent with an increase in transketolase
levels. Thiamine contributes to carbon metabolism by
acting as cofactor of several enzymes such as pyruvate
dehydrogenase,
α-ketoglutarate
dehydrogenase,
branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase, transketolase
and pyruvate decarboxylase [15]. Based on this, we can
speculate that P. flocculosa does undergo a metabolic
switch from biomass production to flocculosin production under stress conditions as proposed by Hammami et
al. [3]. Indeed, the latter study found that the presence of
yeast extract supported the conidial biomass production
of P. flocculosa. When growth is blocked by the exhaustion of yeast extract, flocculosin excretion might constitute an overflow metabolism for P. flocculosa that
regulates the intracellular energy level.
In addition to the observation of proteins consistent
with the inhibition of biomass production under stress
conditions, several other proteins were induced or
increased in P. flocculosa cells following the addition of a
carbon source in the medium. Higher levels of glutamate
synthase, cyanate lyase and heat shock protein (HSP) 70
and 90 support the hypothesis that P. flocculosa was
under stress conditions following the fed-batch. The
addition of carbon increases the consumption speed of
the components of the complex medium YMPD including the yeast extract ingredients. The exhaustion of these
components, particularly yeast extract, appears to induce
flocculosin synthesis, a strategy that may have been
developed by P. flocculosa to store excess carbon in the
environment as proposed by Mimee et al. [10]. As
explained earlier, the carbon backbone of flocculosin (and
of ustilagic acid) is composed of a long fatty acid chain
originating from palmitic acid. Here, we detected the
electron transfer flavoprotein, a key cofactor of the β-oxidation which is considered a way to produce acetyl-COA
in the mitochondria. Equally, the expression of pentose

Page 8 of 9

phosphate-related enzymes is necessary to produce
NADPH, which in turn is essential to fatty acid synthesis.
Because of the complexity of the flocculosin (glycolipid)
structure, its synthesis requires ATP production. Expectedly, an ATPase and other proteins such as the glycolytic
enzyme, triose phosphate isomerase (TIM), succinate
dehydrogenase and alpha-glucosidase involved in carbon
metabolism producing the ATP molecule, were up-regulated by the carbon addition.
In the control medium, the cells tended to produce proteins that are commonly associated with biomass production. Ornithine aminotransferase has a fundamental role
in the central metabolism of organisms, as it may serve
for the synthesis of proline, polyamines, glutamate and
glutamine. These products are of great nutritional and
physiological importance for diverse functions including
growth and development [16]. Also, the soluble elongation factors are likely to play an important role in limiting
the error frequency during protein synthesis [17]. The
low abundance of these proteins in the stress treatment
suggests that carbon addition in the growth medium
inhibited some activities which assure the appropriate
course of cellular growth and shifted the overall metabolism toward the production of flocculosin.
Owing to the structural similarity between flocculosin
and ustilagic acid, and to the phylogenetic link between P.
flocculosa and U. maydis, we expected to detect in the
flocculosin production treatment proteins belonging to
the cluster of 12 co-regulated genes involved in ustilagic
acid synthesis in U. maydis [18]. Our analyses did not
identify any of the proteins related to this cluster of genes,
whether they are present in the cytosol or in the membranes. The detection of membrane proteins such as the
ATP-synthase seem to rule out the possibility that our
extraction procedure failed to detect such proteins [19].
Their low relative concentration or a poor correlation
between mRNA transcripts and protein accumulation for
these 12 genes, as noted for many genes in yeast [6], could
explain our results. A similar conclusion was reported in
the study of the proteomic changes involved in the transition of U. maydis from budding to filamentous form [7].
Two proteins, versicolorin B synthase (UM03246) and
anthranilate synthase (UM02376) that were minor components of multiprotein spots showed an increase in
transcriptional level of 4- and 13-fold respectively.
Based on our observations, it does appear that P. flocculosa will only produce flocculosin early in the process of
pseudohyphal formation under conditions of nutrient
limitations. While this process can be artificially maintained in vitro by the addition of a C source, in nature it
would serve as a means of protecting/forging an ecological niche as sporidia land in a new environment. This
supports recent quantitative evaluation of flocculosin
production in situ where Marchand et al. [4] found that

Hammami et al. Proteome Science 2010, 8:7
http://www.proteomesci.com/content/8/1/7

genes involved in flocculosin synthesis were only up-regulated within the first 6 hours of sporidia coming into
contact with a leaf. In the same manner, we can speculate
that sporidia of U. maydis would produce ustilagic acid in
the first steps of germination to facilitate contact with a
compatible mating type, as suggested by Hewald et al. [5].

Conclusion
This work presents the first proteomic map of P. flocculosa together with a positive identification of the salient
proteins. The impressive number of proteins that displayed changes in their relative rates of synthesis during
the adaptation to stress conditions conveys the idea that
P. flocculosa is an organism in which gene expression varies in response to environmental changes leading to flocculosin synthesis. This analysis was greatly validated by
the recent sequencing of P. flocculosa genome which
allowed a perfect match of the peptide sequences of 21
proteins with specific predicted ORFs in P. flocculosa.
Because of the close genetic link between U. maydis and
P. flocculosa, we were able to positively link those proteins
with a known function annotated in U. maydis thereby
confirming the high level of homology and conserved
genes between the biocontrol agent and the plant pathogen.
