Abstract
Background: Many programs have been developed to identify transcription factor binding sites.
However, most of them are not able to infer two-word motifs with variable spacer lengths. This case is
encountered for RNA polymerase Sigma (σ) Factor Binding Sites (SFBSs) usually composed of two boxes,
called -35 and -10 in reference to the transcription initiation point. Our goal is to design an algorithm
detecting SFBS by using combinational and statistical constraints deduced from biological observations.
Results: We describe a new approach to identify SFBSs by comparing two related bacterial genomes. The
method, named SIGffRid (SIGma Factor binding sites Finder using R'MES to select Input Data), performs a
simultaneous analysis of pairs of promoter regions of orthologous genes. SIGffRid uses a prior
identification of over-represented patterns in whole genomes as selection criteria for potential -35 and 10 boxes. These patterns are then grouped using pairs of short seeds (of which one is possibly gapped),
allowing a variable-length spacer between them. Next, the motifs are extended guided by statistical
considerations, a feature that ensures a selection of motifs with statistically relevant properties. We
applied our method to the pair of related bacterial genomes of Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces
avermitilis. Cross-check with the well-defined SFBSs of the SigR regulon in S. coelicolor is detailed, validating
the algorithm. SFBSs for HrdB and BldN were also found; and the results suggested some new targets for
these σ factors. In addition, consensus motifs for BldD and new SFBSs binding sites were defined,
overlapping previously proposed consensuses. Relevant tests were carried out also on bacteria with
moderate GC content (i.e. Escherichia coli/Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus subtilis/Bacillus licheniformis
pairs). Motifs of house-keeping σ factors were found as well as other SFBSs such as that of SigW in Bacillus
strains.
Conclusion: We demonstrate that our approach combining statistical and biological criteria was
successful to predict SFBSs. The method versatility autorizes the recognition of other kinds of two-box
regulatory sites.

Background
The identification of Transcription Factor Binding Sites
(TFBSs) is a fundamental problem in the understanding
of regulatory networks. A large number of software programs have been designed for the identification of TFBSs.
Some of them have been compared in a recent survey [1]
that shows the diversity of proposed solutions. Many
algorithms are devoted to single motifs prediction [2-11].
They include genetic algorithm [10], expectation maximization or Gibb sampling methods [2,5,7], with incorporated phylogeny data [11], or other methods often based
on multiple alignments [4,6] or statistical over-representation [12] and can identify some kinds of TFBSs, but
these approaches are not adapted to regulatory binding
sites composed of two boxes (a box refers to a conserved
part of a signal modelled by a word).
Indeed, in bacterial RNA polymerase, an interchangeable
subunit, the sigma (σ) factor, recognizes motifs usually
composed of two boxes called -35 and -10 in reference to
their location with respect to the transcription initiation
point. For close σ factors in related bacterial species, the
spacer length between the two boxes of the sigma factor
binding sites (SFBSs) can vary slightly [13]. This characteristic, however, is not tackled by most of the existing methods, such as the popular MEME program [2].
Consider the methods dedicated to finding two-box
motifs. Most of them can not take into account the variability of spacer length between the two boxes [14-21]. At
least four approaches deal with this property. Smile [22],
and the more efficient and recent RISO [23], can search
for two-box motifs and allows for variable spacer lengths,
but they require defining precisely structural constraints
applied to the motif in order to avoid a high number of
output motifs. In addition, they require the user to define
the minimal proportion of input sequences owning the
motif looked for. Using a quorum as small as 0.8% to
obtain motifs concerned by at least 8 sequences in a set of
1000 sequences gives in a very high number of results. A
quorum as high as 10% needs the input set of sequences
to be previously selected by another way to ensure that at
least 10% of the sequences share the motif we search for.
A motif recognized by a σ factor but corresponding to a
small number of SFBSs could not be found. In practice,
such algorithm can only be applied to sets of promoter
regions of known possibly co-regulated genes. Nevertheless, they infer the more general problem of defining TFBS
in eukaryotic organisms.
Closer to prokaryotic considerations, Jacques et al. algorithm [24] does not need transcriptional data and uses the
supposed enrichment of transcription factor binding sites
in intergenic regions. But it requires a matrix that represents the genomic distribution of hexanucleotide pairs,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/73

deduced from a training set composed of experimentally
verified promoters, often from other bacteria when little is
known in the bacterium we are interested in. The advantage of this algorithm is the variability of the spacer
between boxes authorized for a same candidate as SFBS
consensus. Unfortunately, this approach can not determine which nucleotides are important within each box
and can not define the contribution of a position in a
given SFBS. This contribution is variable depending on
the bacterium for a same SFBS (illustrated by the Figure 6
of a recent article related to structural basis for -35 element
recognition [25]). Given motifs are quite long compared
to the number of conserved letters in the known promoters of S. coelicolor for example. This last remark is also
applicable to MITRA application [18], and the algorithms
implemented by Vanet et al. (tested on Helicobacter pylori
[26]) which define 12-letter motifs. Another method
based on Gibbs Sampling algorithm (Bioprospector [17])
requires specification of the width of the motif for the
entire run, whereas motif length of SFBSs seems to be
quite variable (see the review article [27]).
An appropriate way to improve results is the footprinting
method, and more generally phylogenetic approaches
because of the relative conservation of regulatory elements across evolution process. Current comparative
approaches need either distantly related species or more
than two species [10]. In the first case, the number of
shared regulatory motifs will tend to decrease (in parallel
to the decrease of motif conservation). In the last one, the
need of a high enough number of known closely related
bacteria will limit the approach to well-studied families of
bacteria.
We present an algorithm, named SIGffRid, for identifying
SFBSs, taking into account the limitations reported above.
SIGffRid uses a comparative approach to guide word comparisons and defines two-box motifs, whose spacer length
can vary sligthly. This possible variation is an important
characteristic of SFBS motifs [13,28-32] that we have to
take into account in the detection process. By restricting
the set of searched conserved boxes to over-represented
words at its footprinting stage, SIGffRid allows a comparison of closely related species that are more likely to share
common regulatory elements and does not need a great
number of bacteria. This phylogenetic footprinting limits
false positive rate. The following stages treat each bacterium separately in order to obtain their peculiar motifs.
Our algorithm extends short pairs of patterns shared by
conserved pairs of selected words, adapting box widths,
until the global motif obtained reach a significant overrepresentation in upstream regions. It does not fix a
strongly constrained structure for final SFBS candidates.

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:73

Within the treated set of orthologue pairs, SIGffRid looks
for two-word motifs conserved in upstream sequences. If
at least eight of those motifs in the same bacterium share
the same seven-letter pattern (called motif in the following explanations), it can be considered to be a putative
SFBS. The program does not need additional transcriptional data, but can use them with improved performances, if provided. Moreover, SIGffRid's final motifs can
be composed with only seven bases. Therefore, subtle
motifs can be found by our algorithm.
Most of the characteristics of SFBS motifs (spacer length
and variability, box length) exploited by SIGffRid are
already described by Hertz et al. [33] but had been combined only once, in an algorithm [24] that defines a SFBS
with 12 nucleotides while some of known would need
only seven, as is used in SIGffRid.
Phylogenetic relationships, motif properties, and statistical characteristics of SFBSs are the only selection criteria
currently retained by our algorithm.

Results
Properties of SFBSs: parameters for the program
The parameters of SIGffRid are correlated to the biological
characteristics of the SFBSs:

• the related -35 and -10 boxes, 3 to 7 letters wide (default
values in SIGffRid), are sufficiently conserved for a same σ
factor to be detected (6 fixed letters in the two boxes, at
least 2 fixed letters per box). This motivates our interest to
group putative SFBSs by homology of pairs of words.
In practice, in many cases, only one of the two boxes is
well defined (the aptly-named extended -10 element for
instance [34]), a fact taken into account by the capability
of our algorithm to obtain motifs with various structures,
• minimal and maximal spacer lengths between -35 and 10 boxes, taking into account the binding sites of all σ factors can vary in a wide range of values (from 14 to 20
nucleotides by default for σ70 family in SIGffRid),
• spacer length between the two boxes can vary slightly for
the same σ factor in the same bacterium and for two
orthologous σ factors in two related bacteria, characteristics taken into account by using variable spacer (± 1 by
default in the same bacteria, reinforced by Agarwal et al.
experiments [35] in an actinomycete; ± 1 by default in two
related bacteria),
• SFBSs are located upstream of CDSs, property used for
defining our a posteriori statistical test,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/73

• each of the -35 and -10 boxes is over-represented in the
whole genome if we consider frequencies of their subwords. At its footprinting stage, SIGffRid restricts its set of
conserved words to those significantly over-represented.
General description
The main program needs following input data:

• the GenBank files of bacterial species of interest (from
NCBI database),
• the file giving orthologous relationships (from MBGD
database [36] possibly with a user file defining a list of
interesting genes in one of the bacteria, or a user file defining orthologous gene IDs).
For the sake of clarity, we describe step by step, globally,
the broad lines of the algorithm before refining their
description.
We know that SFBSs occurrences are rare in a genome,
because useless occurrences of SFBSs can represent a
handicap for the bacterium which has to overcome the
pressure of selection. The higher number of SFBS-like
sequences the bacterium has (in non regulatory regions),
the higher is the risk that it is counter selected as suggested
by a recent study on density of promoter-like sequences
for σ70 [37]. When a transcription factor diffuses in the cell
volume (or along with the DNA helix), it has to recognize
its binding sites. It can only detect something which is
exceptional compared to every possible motifs present in
the genome. Selection pressure contributes both to the
motif rareness and its conservation. Accordingly, we
hypothesized -35 and -10 motifs of SFBSs as exceptional
motifs in the genome. This was verified in S. coelicolor
where all known sites owned either over-represented
boxes or over-represented sub-words of boxes (minimal
width of 3 letters)(data not shown). The algorithm is summarized as below:
Restrict dictionary of searched boxes
The searched boxes are the words detected by R'MES [38]
as significantly over-represented in the whole genome of
the bacterium of our interest. We chose the whole genome
model because it is expected to be further from SFBS
model than upstream sequence model. Therefore, SFBS
boxes are more unexpected in the whole genome model.
Support for SFBS search
Using another closely related bacterium, intergenic
sequences of probable orthologous genes are extracted
and grouped by pairs. We chose to extract sequences from
position -349 (largest value) to 0 in reference to translation start site because most of SFBSs are found in this
range of positions (as shown by studies of Escherichia coli

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/73

[39] or Streptomyces [40] promoters). We fixed their minimal length to 30 nucleotides.
Though some SFBSs can occur in coding sequences, we use only
intergenic sequences, otherwise we would have word conservation related to coding sequences, and consequently a high
number of false positives. Nevertheless, for a putative SFBS
motif, every occurrences located in the -349 to 0 regions are
given in final result.
Defining pairs of orthologues
We use orthologous relationships based on MBGD database [36], and group pairs of promoter regions of orthologous according to families given in MBGD, to decrease
the number of sequences treated simultaneously.

Although, these "families" are used to split the set of promoter
regions in functionally consistent subgroups, we cannot systematically infer co-regulation relationships.
SIGffRid gives the possibility for the user to define a subset of genes of one bacterium, thus, pairs of promoter
regions obtained from orthologous relationship, if existing.

Grouping conserved pairs of words
Further, these pairs of words are grouped according to
pairs of sub-words they share satisfying a spacer constraint. For this purpose, we fix sub-word profiles, called
seeds.
Motifs extensions
From this stage, we treat the sequences of each bacterium
separately, in order to find close motifs which could have
diverged.

Finally, an extension of the shared sub-words is carried
out according to a probabilistic model. Each one-letter
extension concerns only one position and is followed by
the design of a regular expression describing the conserved extended area.
Final statistical tests on candidate motifs
A statistical test is led on this regular expression to find out
if it is specific to upstream regions of CDSs.

Our statistical test is based on counting in two sets of sequences,
and requires the using of:
whole genome sequences,

Defining conserved pairs of words
Then pairs of conserved over-represented words with a
compatible spacer for a SFBS are searched: for each pair of
orthologous promoter regions, a list of SFBS candidates
shared by the two bacteria is obtained.

Here, we consider the over-representation of each box on the
whole genome even if we search only those conserved in promoter regions. Final statistical test will consider over-representation of the complete motif in upstream sequences of coding
sequences.

lists of upstream sequences of CDS, merged if they overlap

sequences. Some SFBSs of a particular gene are known to be
located in the upstream CDS. Therefore we use upstream
sequences instead of intergenic upstream sequences to take
every occurrence of SFBSs into account in the final statistical
test.

Merging of upstream overlapping sequences on a same strand. The final statistical test of motifs needs to count the
number of occurrences in the upstream sequences. If genes overlap each other, their upstream sequences could overlap each
other. We avoid to count twice the same motif occurrence by merging upstream overlapped sequences which are on a same
strand.

If the motif is considered as an interesting one, we then
obtain annotations of genes located downstream the
motif occurrences, and stop the process. Otherwise, it goes
on recursively until an interesting motif is found.
We give a more detailed description of these techniques in
the following paragraphs.
Definition of searched words
R'MES [38] is a statistical software dedicated to finding
words with exceptional frequencies in a sequence or a set
of sequences. The exceptionality is evaluated by a statistical comparison between the observed counts and the ones
expected under Markov models taking the sequence composition into account. A score of exceptionality is then calculated for each word. The study of -35 and -10 known
boxes in Streptomyces coelicolor has shown that corresponding words, or sub-words they are composed of, get a high
positive score, i.e. are significantly over-represented (data
not shown). We have used this general property to restrict
the number of searched words.

Here, we consider maximal order Markov models meaning that one takes the (h-1)-letter word composition of the
sequences into account to find exceptional h-letter words.
Since we consider words shorter than 8 bases in genomes
longer than 8 Mb, i.e. very frequent words on average,
scores are calculated using a Gaussian approximation of
the count distribution [41]. Moreover, we analyze each
word simultaneously with its reverse complement (considered like a word family in R'MES) because we run
R'MES on the whole genome ; this is important as a mutation into a word on one strand leads to a mutation into its
reverse complement on the other strand. Therefore, the
frequency of a word is closely related to that of its reverse
complement.

over-represented word is its probability to occur so many
times in random sequences having the same short oligonucleotide composition than the observed sequence.
More precisely, if X ~  (0, 1) then the approximate pvalue is the probability for X to be greater than the
observed score. Because of multiple testing, only words of
length h with a p-value smaller than α/4h, with α = 5 × 103, will be considered as exceptionally frequent; e.g. it corresponds to scores greater than 4.11 for h = 4 or than 4.71
for h = 6.
We applied this procedure to all words of length 3 ≤ h ≤ 7
which gave us a set W of exceptionally frequent words on
the alphabet  = {a, c, g, t}. These words were then
searched in each pair of promoter regions of orthologues.
Properties of candidate motifs as possible SFBSs
Let spmin and spmax be the minimal and maximal authorized spacers between -35 and -10 boxes (deduced from
known SFBSs), and let δ be the spacer variation accepted
in the SFBSs of two promoter regions.

Consider a triplet C = {w1, w2, {s1i, s2i}} corresponding to
words w1 and w2 ∈ W in promoter regions of orthologues
s1i and s2i. C is said to be interesting if w1 and w2 occur in s1i
and s2i with spacers sp1 and sp2 in [spmin, ...,spmax] respectively, such that -δ ≤ sp2 - sp1 ≤ + δ (see Figure 2). For each
pair of orthologous sequences, we keep only interesting
triplets C. These are candidates as SFBS.
Motif extensions
Next, we group interesting triplets according to pairs of
seeds. We define a seed as a pattern g on the alphabet {*,
#} where '*' can match with any character and '#' corresponds to an exact match.

The scores of exceptionality produced by R'MES can be
converted into approximate p-values. The p-value of an

For instance, from the seed g = ##*#, we get 34 searching
motifs, or keys, on the alphabet  ∪ {*}:

ac ∗ a, ac ∗ c, ac ∗ g, ac ∗ t
tt ∗ a,

Let t1 and t2 be two keys obtained from seeds g1 = ###
and g2 = ### respectively, and let dt1-t2 be a spacer that separates t1 and t2 in a given C. By considering SS1 = ∪ s1i and
SS2 = ∪ s2i (see Figure 3), a set  = {t1, t2, [e, ..., e + δ],
SS1, SS2} is deduced from all interesting C = {w1, w2, {s1i,
s2i}} which verify, for a given integer e:
(t1 ⊂ w1) (t2 ⊂ w2) (dt1-t2 ∈ [e, ..., e + δ]).
For instance, using the key pair {gaa, gtt} obtained from
seed pair {g1, g2} with g1 = g2 = ### and a spacer of e =
19 ± δ, the following pairs of words given by R'MES (in
uppercase) for one bacterium will be grouped together

We consider λ as the minimal number of distinct
sequences (by default 8) involved in a candidate SFBS
motif. We keep each set SS1 or SS2 only if it presents at
least λ distinct sequences. Note that, for a given pair t1
and t2, we merge the sets  whose [e, ..., e + d] intervals
overlap each other.
A set G of possible seeds of length 3 ≤ L ≤ 5 is fixed before
the run. For grouping we use all non-redundant pairs of

where ᐍmin and ᐍmax are respectively the minimal and maximal number of fixed authorized letters in the two seeds,
and #(g) is the number of # in seed g (by default ᐍmin = ᐍmax
= 6). To correspond with the usual form of SFBS motifs,
we chose the set of seeds G = {###, ####, ##**#, #**##,
#*#*#, #***#, #**#, #*#}. Motif extensions only concern
seeds without '*' and composed of at least 3 letters (if one
of the two seeds has gaps or is to short, only the other will
be used for motif extension).

• position 1: immediately on the left of t1,
• position 2: immediately on the right of t1,
• position 3: immediately on the left of t2,
• position 4: immediately on the right of t2,
Note that if t1 (respectively t2) corresponds to a gapped seed,
positions 1 and 2 (respectively 3 and 4) are not used for extension and probability computations.

For the sake of clarity, we will illustrate it for the case of
pairs of trinucleotides (two seeds ###). Let t1 be the trinucleotide on the left which will be included in the -35 box
of a potential SFBS and t2 be the trinucleotide on the right
which will be included in the -10 box of the same potential SFBS. For each set SS1 and SS2, sequences are sorted
according to the letters adjoining t1 and t2 (see Figure 4).
We define the positions of letters as follows:

Our statistical criteria uses the transition probabilities of a
third-order Markov model adjusted on the whole
genome. It means that probabilities are computed according to the three letters which come before/after the considered letter (depending on its position according to seed).

sequences according to the letters at this position which have a low probability to be obtained (with at least eight related
sequences). They constitute new sets of sequences to be evaluated with LRT statistical test (see Section "Computing a consensus

minimal probability pk(a) over all a ∈  satisfying Nk(a)
≥ λ . Let  k be the set of every letters a at position k which
verify (Nk(a) ≥ λ) (pk(a) ≤ 0.15). We group sequences
according to each letter a ∈  k for the next steps (see Figure 4). A motif corresponding to this set of sequences is
generated and evaluated (Section "Computing a consensus
motif and its statistical evaluation").

where . is the concatenation operator and t[u] stands for
the u-th letter of trinucleotide t.
Therefore, the extended area includes both t1 and t1' (respectively t2 and t2') if k = 1 or k = 2 (respectively k = 3 or k = 4).
In the first case, the extension process concerns the letters on the
left of t1 and the right of t1'. In the second case, these are the
letters on the left of t2 and on the right of t2' which are concerned.
Other sequences are grouped and evaluated with the same
criteria of probability for motif extension. Here, we take
into account the fact that σ subunits of RNA polymerase
are closely related if we consider regions of these proteins
involved in -35 and -10 DNA binding (these regions are
called 2.4 and 4.2 regions). Therefore, SFBSs might be so
closely related that they differ only by one letter.
Note: We verify that the sequence set cannot be split into several distinct subsets, each one corresponding to a spacer length
with a narrower range of variation. If it is the case, we record
each one of the results corresponding to subset, otherwise we
record the global result.
Computing a consensus motif and its statistical evaluation
At each grouping step, a generic motif m is deduced corresponding to two words with a variable spacer. It is built by
adding to (extended) trinucleotide pairs, bordering letters

a ∈  k satisfying:

• If it is considered to be an interesting one, we record the
corresponding set of sequences as results,

(Nk(a) ≥ λ) (pk(a) ≤ 0.15)

• If the number of involved sequences becomes too low
(<λ), the process is stopped,

where pk(a) is obtained from Equation (2) and λ is the
minimal number of distinct sequences (by default 8)
involved in a candidate SFBS motif.

• If the motif is not interesting, a new evaluation is done
on each subset of sequences defined by letters from  k .
if the evaluation is conclusive, we record the corresponding set of sequences as results,

The method evaluates the specificity of m for upstream
sequences. The motif is then searched in the set U of
upstream sequences of CDSs (we will call them merged
sequences in this paper) by considering each strand separately (we merge sequences if they overlap each other on
the same strand, see Figure 1). It means that we take into
account the motif orientation when we search it in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/73

merged sequences. The number of occurrences is also
computed on direct and reverse strands of the whole
genome G (composed of |G| elements: genome, plasmids). We took into account plasmids because they usually contain genes with one particular interest like
antibiotic resistance genes. We chose not to neglect regulatory elements located in plasmids.
Let ᐍU (respectively ᐍG) the length of U (resp. G) and NU
(resp. NG) the number of occurrences of the motif m into
U (resp. G). We then define the following ratio

R=

NU
NG

that measures the specificity of the motif for merged
sequences. To test the significance of R, we use the likelihood ratio test (LRT) [42]: the LRT statistics given below
follows the chi-square distribution χ2(1) with one degree
of freedom.

μG) is the probability for the motif to occur in sequence U
(resp. G) at a given position. μU and μG are calculated
under the Bernoulli model (obtained from the sequence
sets U and G) to take U and G nucleotide compositions
into account. This is a crucial point because intergenic
sequences are known to be richer in AT than other
sequences in known bacteria whatever their GC letters
proportion is [43].
LRT measures the difference of concentration of a given
motif in two sets of sequences. The continuation or stop
of the consensus motif extension -by sorting sequencesdepends on LRT. A selection of the more interesting
results is made according to the ratios R and LRT.
The relationship (R ≥ Rmin) (LRT ≥ LRTmin) must be verified, with LRTmin the quantile at 5% of the χ2(1) law and
Rmin = M ⋅ 2 U the minimal threshold for specificity,
G
where M corresponds to the minimal ratio between
number of occurrences of SFBS supposed to be in merged

sequences, and the number of occurrences in the whole
genome in terms of number of occurrences (three by
default). Considering that most SFBSs are in the upstream
regions of CDSs, we suppose that sites which are located
upstream are two times more represented in this set than
in the whole genome (measurement of the density of the
motif). This evidence makes SIGffRid to continue motif
extension while motifs are not sufficiently specific to
merged sequences (see Figure 4). Therefore, general elements quite frequent in upstream sequences but largely
distributed on the whole genome are not in SIGffRid
results.
Visualization of the results
Each motif is displayed with all related gene identifiers,
scores R and LRT. Two related files complete these results
corresponding to all the occurrences found in the complete set of upstream sequences of the related bacterium
(including plasmids), their positions according to the
translation start point and the annotations of the involved
genes. For validation, only cross checking with known
biological pathway is necessary to ensure the coherence of
related gene functions linked by the same regulation
motif.

Discussion
We ran SIGffRid on phylogenetically related bacterial species belonging to the same genus, Streptomyces coelicolor
A3(2) and Streptomyces avermitilis MA-4680 [44,45]. These
mycelial Gram-positive bacteria have large genomes
(8,667,507 bp and 9,025,608 bp, respectively) and a high
GC content (72.1% and 70.7%, respectively). Sixty nine
percents of S. avermitilis genes have orthologues in S. coelicolor [45]. These bacteria present a complex regulatory
network, as suggested by the high number of predicted σ
factors (65 and 60, respectively), whose very few consensus regulatory binding sites are known. And approximately 12.3% of their genes are supposed to be regulators
[44]. As proposed by Konstantinidis et al. [46], many regulation systems are expected to cross talk, because their
genes share high sequence similarity (paralogous genes of
expanded gene families), which suggests increased complexity in regulation as well.
In this context, defining SFBSs, and more generally TFBSs
is a true challenge.
Genes of S. coelicolor and S. avermitilis were grouped
according to functions defined in MBGD database [36] to
reduce the memory and processor usage for large
genomes. A total of 3,148 promoter pairs of orthologues
were extracted, distributed in 15 functional categories
(1,476 orthologous pairs), and the rest that could not be
assigned to a function (1,672 pairs) were put in one single

category. Spacer range was chosen to correspond to σ70
family spacers (from 14 to 20). We used seeds {###, ####,
##**#, #**##, #*#*#, #***#, #**#, #*#} and the dictionary of exceptional words from S. coelicolor for the two
bacteria (using S. avermitilis dictionary gave similar
results, data not shown).
From our data set, 113 motifs (two words with a variable
spacer) were obtained for S. coelicolor and 65 for S. avermitilis.
Additional file 1 summarizes most interesting results from
SIGffRid (Table2_summary.pdf). The complete lists of
putative binding sites, positions and sequences, and
related gene functions for S. coelicolor, are also available
on SIGffRid web page dedicated to results [47]. The SIGffRid web server can be found at [48]. To assign biological
function to genes, we used the protein classification
scheme available on Sanger Institute website [49] based
on that originally created for E. coli in the EcoCyc database
[50].
Motifs and genes related to SigR binding site
To validate our approach, we looked for the presence of
the SigR binding site among SIGffRid results. The regulon
of SigR, a σ factor involved in the response to oxidative
stress, is the largest described so far in S. coelicolor. Paget et
al. show that SigR activates directly the response of at least
30 genes, and recognizes the motif GGAATN18GTT [51].

Two different motifs obtained with S. coelicolor overlapped the SFBS of SigR regulon (see Table 1). Among the
79 occurrences of the first motif GGAATN16,19GTT, 29
occured in the promoters previously described by Paget et
al. [51]. The 30th, SCO3162 motif, was not found because
it overlapped CDS. Rest of the 50 potential binding sites
were cross referenced, with microarray data showing variation of genes transcription under thiol specific oxidative
stress condition triggered by diamide containing medium
(Paget MSB, personal communication). Four among them
were differently expressed in the microarray data
(SCO4956, SCO0569-0570, SCO4297, and SCO6061).
Two of these motifs had a promoter with a 18 nt spacer
(SCO4956, SCO0569-0570) and the other two had a 19
nt spacer (SCO4297, SCO6061). The unaltered expression of the genes related to the 46 other occurrences can
be explained by either particular stress conditions inducing their transcription (not used in this microarray experiment) or by the fact that they are not real promoters.
The second motif GGGAAN18,20CGTT corresponds to previously reported promoters likely regulated by the orthologue of SigR, named SigH, in another actinomycete
Mycobacterium tuberculosis [51]. Twelve out of the 58
occurrences of this motif were related to differently

expressed genes under oxidative conditions (SCO4039,

Among these, eight were similar to the motif observed by
Paget et al. [51]. Further, two occurrences (of the 12)
shared the motif GGGAAGAN16CGTT (SCO0888,
SCO4039), very close to the one previously deduced from
SigH-dependent
promoters
in
M.
tuberculosis
(GGGAACAN16CGTT [52]). One occurrence (SCO6061)
also overlapped that of the first motif.
The Additional file 2 describes gene functions and proposed binding sites according to SIGffRid motifs similar
to SigR binding site (Table3_SigR_motifs.pdf).
Other putative binding sites of known sigma factors
Some motifs detected by SIGffRid correspond to proposed
sigma factor binding sites. The motif CGTAAN18,19GTT
matched the promoter of bldM (SCO4768 [53]), which is
the sole known binding site for BldN. BldN is involved in
morphological differenciation and recognizes the motif
CGTAACN16CGTTGA.

The SIGffRid motif was found in 24 other regions
upstream of coding sequences (see Additional file 3:
Table4_BldN_motifs.pdf) suggesting new targets for the σ
factor BldN.
HrdB, the major σ factor in S. coelicolor [54], has at least
12 known binding sites [54-62] of which six overlapped
four
SIGffRid
motifs
(TGACAN17,20AN3T,
TTGACN19,20ANCNT,
TTGAN18,19CTA,
CNGN18,21TAGGCT). Five among the six remaining
motifs, and the motif determined as HrdD binding site
[59] (a close homologue of HrdB), were also close to the

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:73

above four SIGffRid motifs. Approximately 390 genes
would be concerned by those motifs.
Other putative SFBSs
The SIGffRid motif, CNGN14,16AGTAA, could correspond
to a SFBS consensus. Indeed, the motif CNGN14,16AGTAA
is present in the promoter region of the S. coelicolor bldB
gene and AGTAA has been proposed to be the -10 box of
bldB [63]. The bldB gene encodes a 98 amino acids
polypeptide involved in morphogenesis, antibiotic production, and catabolite control in S.coelicolor [63]. Interestingly, this motif is found in the DNA region preceding
bldKC, belonging to a five gene cluster encoding an oligopeptide permease responsible for the import of an
extracellular signal governing aerial mycelium formation
in S. coelicolor.

Two SIGffRid results, TGTCAGTN14,15TnG and
TGTCAGTN14TnG, found in both S. coelicolor and S. avermitilis, could correspond to DNA damage-inducible promoters. They are declinations of the Streptomyces rimosus
UV-inducible recA promoter, given by Ahel et al.
(TTGTCAGTGGCN6TAGggT [64]) and whose variation
was proposed by Studholme et al. through a bioinformatic
method
[21].
Two
additional
motifs,
TGTCAGTGN9,12ANG and TGTCAGTN12,14TNG, could be
retrieved when the spacer length parameter range was
made from 8 to 14. In S. coelicolor, 67 genes were featured
by these motifs, and 39 of them were assigned to a function (see Additional file 4: Table5_recA_motifs.pdf). Several functional groups could be distinguished, the most
significant being related to DNA repair (13–20 genes) and
includes homologues of the E. coli genes dinP, priA, radA,
dinG, recQ. This group also included DNA glycosylases
(e.g. ung), excinuclease (e.g. uvrB SC), and polymerase I
genes. Another set of genes was related to DNA replication
(e.g. dnaE, dnaN encoding respectively α and β subunits of
PolIII, and recF).
TFBS motifs other than SFBSs
A SIGffRid motif, [TA]GTGAN18,20TN2C overlaps the
BldD binding site whose consensus was proposed by
Elliot et al. (AGTgANmTCACc [65]). BldD is a key transcriptional regulator involved in morphological differentiation and antibiotic production in S. coelicolor [65]. This
motif was found upstream of bldG (anti-sigma factor
antagonist) and five σ factor encoding genes (including
HrdB, and whiG which encodes an alternative sigma factor
essential for sporulation [66]).

Another SIGffRid motif [TA]GTGAN16,18CNT overlapping
the above motif was found upstream of seven σ factors,
including HrdD and those found downstream of the first
motif. We speculate that these motifs may be declinations
of BldD binding site.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/73

Application to other bacterial genomes
The efficiency of SIGffRid was further tested onto pairs of
related bacterial species with lower G+C genome contents
(i.e. Escherichia coli K12, 50% and Salmonella typhimurium
LT2, 52% on one hand, and Bacillus subtilis 168, 43% and
Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 14580 (DSM13), 46% on the
other hand, [67-71]). Approximately 80% of the predicted B. licheniformis coding sequences have B. subtilis
orthologues [70]. The phylogenetic relationships inferred
from the 16S rDNA identities, 97.0% and 97.4% between
the species of each pairs, was similar to those between the
Streptomyces species (97.3%) previously used to develop
the algorithm. In contrast to Streptomyces where functional
gene categories were used to limit computational times
and result quantities, the whole orthologue gene sets were
used on E. coli/S. typhimurium and B. subtilis/B. licheniformis analyses.

Several motifs were proposed by SIGffRid for each pair.
Among these motifs, some could describe the binding
sites of the house keeping σ factors, σ70 of E. coli and SigA
of B. subtilis. Thus, for B. subtilis, the motifs
TTGAN18,19TATAAT and TTGACN18,20ATAAT for instance
perfectly match the known consensus. Some other motifs
describe SFBSs for alternative σ factors such as SigW
(TGAAACN16,17CGTA [72]) which is implied in stress
response in B. subtilis. SIGffRID extends the -10 motif by
one nucleotide to give TGAAACN16,17CGTAT. For B.
licheniformis, the motif proposed match exactly the SigW
consensus of B. subtilis described in the litterature. The
data and additional motifs are detailed in Additional file
5 (Table6_eco_stm_bsu_bld.pdf).

Conclusion
Our algorithm proved to be relevant in finding different
SFBSs and TFBSs, and can be applied to any bacterial species because it only uses general properties. SIGffRid is
particularly suited to the detection of SFBSs with a high
number of occurrences (those of house-keeping σ factors,
e.g. SigA in B. subtilis) or with a small number of well-conserved occurrences (those of some alternative σ factors,
e.g. BldN or SigR binding sites in S. coelicolor).
We combine the knowledge of footprinting, constraints of
motif structures, phylogeny and statistical models to
ameliorate motif characteristics in TFBSs prediction.
Beyond phylogenetic footprinting, some features specific
to our method take better into account the variations of
the same SFBS in two closely related bacteria. The first
being the extension of shared pairs of seeds applied separately in each bacterium. We eventually obtain different
variations of the same SFBS in two related bacteria, where
the differences concern boxes and/or spacer lengths.
Another is its capabilities to group putative sites of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/73

same transcription factor using probabilities. By analysing
possible regulons found by SIGffRid, we have shown that
regulatory networks could be deduced from annotations,
in addition to consensus motifs. Finally, it features an
independant statistical test to evaluate the pertinence of
the motif. Based on a biological hypothesis, it has the
advantage of allowing SIGffRid to be applicable on any
subset of sequences (e.g. list of genes obtained from
microarray data). Though SIGffRid can be improved by
refining probabilistic models used for motif extension
and statistical evaluation, it clearly infers motifs close to
known consensuses of TFBS.

The nucleotidic motif is probably only one aspect of the
SFBS recognition, but is a necessary first bioinformatic
step for its prediction. It would be undoubtedly complicated to account for the large number of parameters implicated in DNA recognition by σ factors in all potential
promoter regions.
