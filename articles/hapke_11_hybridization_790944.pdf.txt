Hybridization of mouse lemurs: different patterns
under different ecological conditions

Abstract
Background: Several mechanistic models aim to explain the diversification of the multitude of endemic species on
Madagascar. The island’s biogeographic history probably offered numerous opportunities for secondary contact
and subsequent hybridization. Existing diversification models do not consider a possible role of these processes.
One key question for a better understanding of their potential importance is how they are influenced by different
environmental settings. Here, we characterized a contact zone between two species of mouse lemurs, Microcebus
griseorufus and M. murinus, in dry spiny bush and mesic gallery forest that border each other sharply without
intermediate habitats between them. We performed population genetic analyses based on mtDNA sequences and
nine nuclear microsatellites and compared the results to a known hybrid zone of the same species in a nearby
wide gradient from dry spiny bush over transitional forest to humid littoral forest.
Results: In the spiny-gallery system, Microcebus griseorufus is restricted to the spiny bush; Microcebus murinus
occurs in gallery forest and locally invades the dryer habitat of its congener. We found evidence for bidirectional
introgressive hybridization, which is closely linked to increased spatial overlap within the spiny bush. Within 159
individuals, we observed 18 hybrids with mitochondrial haplotypes of both species. Analyses of simulated
microsatellite data indicate that we identified hybrids with great accuracy and that we probably underestimated
their true number. We discuss short-term climatic fluctuations as potential trigger for the dynamic of invasion and
subsequent hybridization. In the gradient hybrid zone in turn, long-term aridification could have favored
unidirectional nuclear introgression from Microcebus griseorufus into M. murinus in transitional forest.
Conclusions: Madagascar’s southeastern transitional zone harbors two very different hybrid zones of mouse lemurs
in different environmental settings. This sheds light on the multitude of opportunities for the formation of hybrid
zones and indicates an important influence of environmental factors on secondary contact and hybridization. Our
findings suggest that hybridization could enhance the adaptability of mouse lemurs without necessarily leading to
a loss of distinctiveness. They point to a potential role of hybridization in Madagascar’s diversification history that
requires further investigation.

Background
There is increasing evidence that natural hybridization
between animal species occurs more frequently than
previously appreciated [1,2]. Moreover, the use of
genetic techniques has facilitated the detection of many
cases of introgressive hybridization between animals [3].
Hybridization can constitute a threat for biodiversity
when rare endemic species come into contact with
widespread invaders and are hybridized out of existence

[4,5], but there are also examples of hybridizing species
that maintain distinctiveness in the face of interspecific
gene flow (e.g. [6,7]). Introgressive hybridization can
even allow for the transfer of beneficial adaptations
between species, facilitate rapid adaptation to changing
environmental conditions and thus play an important
role for diversification [2,3,8]. According to different
models, environmental factors can influence hybrid
zones to various degrees. Tension zones are maintained
by a balance of immigration of the parental species and
endogenous selection against hybrids, which is independent of environmental factors [9]. In other kinds of
hybrid zones, environmental selection in mosaics or

gradients of different habitats influences hybridization
[1,10,11]. According to the tension zone and mosaic
zone models, hybrids are generally less fit than the parental species [9,11]. According to the bounded hybrid
superiority model [10], they are more fit than the parental species in ecotonal habitats. Under the evolutionary
novelty model [1], endogenous and environmental selection act in concert, and certain hybrid genotypes can be
as fit as or more fit than the parental species in ecotonal
and parental habitats. Temporal change of environmental conditions can also influence hybridization. Prominent examples for hybrid superiority due to climatic
fluctuations are Darwin’s finches on Daphne Major
Island [12].
Madagascar has an extremely high level of endemism
both at the species level and at higher taxonomic levels
and is among the world’s eight hottest biodiversity hotspots [13]. Due to its long isolation from other landmasses, the island harbors many endemic radiations that
gave rise to numerous microendemic species with very
restricted ranges [14-16]. In various groups of organisms, there are also macroendemic species with larger
ranges that overlap with those of their microendemic
congeners. Examples are leaf chameleons [17,18], cophyline frogs [17,19], tufted-tailed rats [20] and mouse
lemurs [21]. Patterns of microendemism in Madagascar
are just beginning to emerge in the course of a recent
and ongoing wave of species detections [14,22]. In
recent years, a variety of models have been proposed
that aim to explain the evolution of this diversity of
microendemics [15,19,23,24]. Most of these models
focus on allopatric or vicariant speciation. Consequently,
a potential role of hybridization for the diversification of
Malagasy endemics has so far widely been neglected
although the present biogeography offers numerous
opportunities for the formation of hybrid zones along
environmental gradients ([16] but see [24]). There is a
controversial discussion about a potential role of Pleistocene climatic changes for the evolution of microendemics in Madagascar [15,18,24]. At least it is clear that
Madagascar’s current biogeography arose after dramatic
changes in the course of climatic fluctuations, which are
best documented for the Holocene [25]. Most endemic
organisms must have undergone range shifts, retractions
and expansions in the course of climatic fluctuations
[15]. The study of microevolutionary processes at species boundaries is thus important for a better understanding of how species adapted to changing
environmental conditions and how the diversity of
microendemics was maintained throughout the vicissitudes of the Pleistocene. It appears probable that there
were even more opportunities for the formation of
hybrid zones in the dynamic past of Madagascar’s biogeography than is evident from current patterns. At

present, there is a belt of humid forest in eastern Madagascar, seasonally dry deciduous forest in western Madagascar and dry spiny bush in the South. Dry western
and humid eastern formations are largely separated
from each other by mostly forestless central highlands.
Dry-humid ecotones are restricted to the North and the
South, but there is evidence for the existence of forest
corridors that connected western dry and eastern humid
forest through the central highlands during the Holocene [23,26]. Heckman et al. [27] discuss secondary contact through such corridors and hybridization as
potential alternative explanation to incomplete lineage
sorting for phylogeographic patterns in western and
eastern mouse lemurs.
There is an ongoing discussion about the question
how many species of mouse lemurs should be distinguished (e.g. [28,29]). Weisrock et al. [29] delineated 16
population-level lineages based on sequence data from
two mitochondrial and four nuclear loci from a large
sample of mouse lemurs comprising localities all across
Madagascar. According to the authors [29], it depends
on the species concept applied how many of the 16
lineages deserve species rank. The currently recognized
species Microcebus murinus comprises several of these
lineages. Weisrock et al. [29] did not formally subdivide
Microcebus murinus into different species. In the study
presented here, we use the name “Microcebus murinus“
in the sense of “M. murinus sensu latu” in Weisrock et
al. [29].
Gligor et al. [30] detected a hybrid zone between two
species of mouse lemurs, Microcebus griseorufus and M.
murinus, within a dry-humid ecotone in southeastern
Madagascar. Microcebus griseorufus is a microendemic
in the southern dry spiny bush [21,30-32]. Microcebus
murinus has a very large distribution that comprises the
western seasonally dry deciduous forest, southern gallery
forest and southeastern humid littoral forest [21,30,33].
Southeastern Madagascar harbors a steep ecological gradient from the southern dry spiny bush to eastern
humid forest (Figures 1 and 2). The north-southward
directed Anosy- and Vohimena mountain chains form a
climatic barrier to incoming clouds from the east. On
their eastern flanks, there is rainforest. The vegetation
shifts abruptly towards dry spiny bush in their western
rain shadow. South of the southern tips of the mountain
barrier, there is a wide ecological gradient from dry
spiny bush in the west over intermediate transitional
forest to humid littoral forest in the eastern part of the
region. Gligor et al. [30] investigated the two species
along a transect from dry spiny bush across the transitional forest into the littoral forest with the aid of
nuclear microsatellites and sequences of a mitochondrial
locus. They observed Microcebus griseorufus in the dry
spiny bush and M. murinus in the humid littoral forest.

sites are abbreviated as in Table 1.

In the transitional forest, they identified hybrids with
murinus-like mitochondrial haplotypes and contrasting
nuclear genotypes. Gligor et al. [30] concluded on an
asymmetric introgression of griseorufus-like nuclear
alleles into formerly autochthonous populations of
Microcebus murinus in this intermediate vegetation zone
between dry and humid vegetation.
Potential contact zones between species adapted to
dry and mesic or humid conditions are not limited to
such wide ecotonal gradients in Madagascar. For example, gallery forests with mesic conditions exist throughout the southern dry spiny bush, thus providing a
virtually endless line of contact between different kinds
of habitat.
It is unclear, which role hybridization could have
played in Madagascar’s diversification history. One key

question towards a better understanding of its possible
role is how far hybridization is influenced by ecological
conditions. The aim of our study presented here was to
contribute to the answering of the latter question by
comparing contact zones of the same model species in
different ecological settings. We questioned how far
hybridization between Microcebus griseorufus and M.
murinus would be restricted to the presence of an intermediate habitat where hybrids might have selective
advantages. Would the same species also hybridize
where they come into contact under different ecological
conditions and would such a hybrid zone have a different structure? In order to answer these questions, we
performed a population genetic study of the two species
within the western rain shadow of the Anosy Mountains
where spiny bush and gallery forest border each other

sharply without intermediate habitats between them. We
refer to this system as the spiny-gallery contact zone
and to the hybrid zone in transitional forest as the gradient contact zone in the following (Figures 1 and 2).
Our genetic data yield evidence for hybridization in
the spiny-gallery contact zone. Hybridization patterns in
the two zones differ in several aspects. We discuss these
differences and possible environment-related processes
that could influence hybridization.

Methods
Description of the study area

The study area (Figure 1) is situated in and around parcel 2 of Andohahela National Park 20-40 km north of
the hybrid zone in transitional forest investigated by Gligor et al. [30]. The area is dominated by dry spiny bush,
which is crossed by temporary watercourses that mostly
originate in the eastern humid forest. Along the watercourses, there are discontinuous narrow bands of gallery
forests. Dry spiny bush and the more humid gallery

forest border each other sharply without intermediate
formations between them. We sampled mouse lemurs at
six sites (Figure 1, Table 1). Rakotondranary et al. [34]
performed a detailed ecological study of the mouse
lemurs at these localities. At Hazofotsy (Hzf), we
trapped all mouse lemurs in dry spiny bush. The closest
remnants of gallery forest were in a distance of 1500 m.
At Ambatoabo (Abt), we trapped mouse lemurs in a
dense gallery forest and in adjacent dry spiny bush. At
Ankoba (Akb), we trapped mouse lemurs in spiny bush,
close to a gallery forest along the Azoara creek and near
a small affluent. At Mangatsiaka (Mtk), there was spiny
bush with sparse gallery vegetation along some temporary watercourses. In contrast to all other sites, these
watercourses originate in the spiny bush and are dry
most time of the year. We trapped mouse lemurs within
the gallery and the surrounding spiny bush. At Tsimelahy (Tml), we trapped mouse lemurs in gallery forest
along the Tarantsy River and a small affluent and in
adjacent dry spiny bush. At Ebosika (Ebo), the Tarantsy
river flows out of the eastern humid forest and crosses
adjacent spiny bush with a gallery forest along the river.
We captured mouse lemurs in spiny bush near the river
and within the marginal part of the humid forest.
Trapping of mouse lemurs and sample collection

We trapped mouse lemurs with banana-baited Sherman
traps set up approximately 1 m above ground level.
After anesthetizing the animals, we took small tissue
samples from the ear for genetic analyses. We stored
the samples in 90% ethanol at ambient temperature. We
released all animals in the late afternoon of the same
day at the respective sites of capture. We performed the
trapping of mouse lemurs and the collection of tissue
samples in compliance with respective research authorizations by the Malagasy Ministère de l’Environnement,
des Eaux et Forêts (No 179/06/MINENV.EF/SG/DGEF/
DPB/SCBLF/RECH, No 0174/07 -MINENV.EF/SG/
DGEEF/DVRN/SPE) and by the Malagasy Ministère de
l’Environnement, des Eaux et Forêts et du Tourisme
(No 091/08/MEEFT/SG/DGEF/DSAP/SSE).

Laboratory work

We isolated DNA from tissue samples using the DNeasy
Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following the protocol for
the purification of total DNA from animal tissues. We
genotyped all individuals using the same genetic markers as Gligor et al. [30], which comprised the mitochondrial hypervariable region 1 (HV1) and nine nuclear
microsatellite loci.
We amplified the HV1 with one primer binding in the
constant region of the mitochondrial D-loop (mih1coau: 5’GTTATAGTTTCAGGTTAGTCA-3’) and one of the following primers binding in the cytochrome b gene: mih1cbau
(5’-GATCTACTTATCCTTACATGA-3’), Mcytbf (5’CTAGTAGAATGRATCTGAGG-3’), MrFTDcytbinfw58
(5’-GATTCTTCGCATTCCACTTC-3’) or TsimMgCytbfw2 (5’-TCGGACAAGTGGCCTCTAT-3’). Typical
PCR conditions comprised an initial denaturation step of 2
min at 92°C, 35 to 40 cycles of 40 s denaturation at 92°C,
60 s annealing at 55°C and 60 s elongation at 72°C, and
one final elongation step of 5 min at 72°C. When using primer mih1cbau, we changed the annealing temperature to
54°C. When using primers Mcytbf or MrFTDcytbinfw58,
we changed the elongation time to 70 s. We performed
wax-mediated hot-start-PCR using the Qiagen Core Kit.
For sequencing of the HV1 on both strands, we used the
BigDye version 3.1 kit (Applied Biosystems) on a 3130
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). We used mih1coau
combined with either mih1cbau, TsimMgCytbfw2 or
mih1cbin2Mz (5’-TTATACCWACYGTAAGYCTT-3’) as
primers for sequencing.
We applied the microsatellite markers 33104, Mm21,
Mm22, Mm39, Mm51, Mm30, Mm42, Mm43b and
Mm60 [35] with the following modifications: We performed a first wax-mediated hot-start PCR with nonlabeled primers and then reamplified 1-4 μl of the
resulting product in repeated unidirectional extensions
of one fluorescently labeled primer both with the Qiagen Core Kit. We changed the annealing temperature
for locus Mm42 to 54°C. We used a 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) for electrophoresis and the
GENEMAPPER 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems) for
raw data analysis. We used 6-FAM and HEX as fluorescent dyes and GeneScan™-350 ROX™ (Applied Biosystems) as length standard.
Data analysis: sequence data of the HV1

We aligned the sequences of the HV1 using the CLUSTAL W module implemented in BIOEDIT version 7.0.1
[36] and corrected the resulting alignment visually. We
collapsed identical sequences to haplotypes using
FABOX [37]. We performed phylogenetic tree reconstructions in order to assign haplotypes to the two species of mouse lemurs. To this aim, we added reference
sequences of Microcebus griseorufus ([GenBank:

Page 5 of 17

EU109652], [30]) and M. murinus ([GenBank:
DQ865143], [38]) to the dataset. For tree reconstructions based on maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference, we used a sequence of Microcebus ravelobensis
([GenBank: AF285455], [39]) as outgroup.
We used PAUP* version 4.0b10 [40] for a maximum
parsimony tree reconstruction. We performed a heuristic search with 100 random addition replicates and TBR
branch swapping and a bootstrap analysis with 100
replicates for the evaluation of relative levels of support
for internal nodes.
For the following tree reconstructions, we selected
most appropriate substitution models for our data based
on the Akaike Information Criterion as implemented in
JMODELTEST version 0.1.1 [41,42]. We performed likelihood calculations for 24 models, which included 3 substitution schemes, equal or unequal base frequencies, a
proportion of invariable sites and rate variation among
sites with 4 rate categories on maximum likelihood optimized trees.
We used the MRBAYES software version 3.1.2 [43,44]
for a tree reconstruction via Bayesian inference. We
applied the HKY+G model in 2 independent analyses
with 4 Markov Chain Monte Carlo chains and sampled
the resulting trees every 100th generation. We stopped
the analysis after 2,000,000 generations, when the standard deviation of split frequencies was 0.006532. We
discarded the first 5,000 samples as burnin and summed
the parameters from the remaining 15,000 samples.
There was no increasing or decreasing trend in the log
probabilities over generations. The potential scale reduction factor was 1.000 for all parameters. Based on these
observations, we concluded that the analysis had converged. We discarded the first 5,000 trees as burnin and
computed a consensus tree and posterior probabilities
for internal nodes from the remaining 15,000 trees.
We used PHYML version 3.0 [42] for a maximum
likelihood tree reconstruction, where we did not include
an outgroup. For this dataset, JMODELTEST selected
the HKY+G substitution model with a transition-transversion-parameter kappa of 80.0366 and a gamma shape
parameter alpha of 0.0740. We applied the HKY+G
model with 4 rate categories and fixed kappa and alpha
to the values estimated by JMODELTEST. We performed tree searches using the SPR method with 5 random starting trees and the simultaneous NNI method
with a BioNJ starting tree and selected the best tree
overall with the aid of the BEST method. We evaluated
support of internal branches by a bootstrap analysis
with 100 replicates.
Spatial overlap of individuals with different haplotypes

We compared the degree of spatial overlap between
individuals with mitochondrial haplotypes of Microcebus

Hapke et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:297
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/297

griseorufus and M. murinus at Mangatsiaka and Tsimelahy as follows. For each individual with a griseorufuslike haplotype, we determined the 6 nearest neighbors
based on pairwise distances between individual trapping
positions rounded to the nearest 10 m (Additional file 1:
Individual trap positions at Mangatsiaka and Tsimelahy).
We then calculated the average proportion of murinuslike haplotypes in the nearest neighborhood of griseorufus-like individuals for each sampling site. In order to
evaluate a potential impact of unequal numbers of individuals with the two species’ haplotypes, we calculated
averages from 100 datasets, where we reduced the
greater group to the same size as the smaller group by
random resampling. We wrote the program SOA [45]
for these analyses.
We further tested for significant differences of the
proportions of murinus-like and griseorufus-like mitochondrial haplotypes among individuals captured at
Mangatsiaka and Tsimelahy with the aid of Fisher’s
exact test as implemented in PASW Statistics 17.0.
Microsatellite data: F-statistics, tests of deviations from
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibria

For the following tests, we divided the individuals into
local samples according to sampling sites and griseorufus-like (-Mg) or murinus-like (-Mm) mitochondrial
haplotypes. We excluded some resulting small samples
with sample sizes between 1 and 7 and included the following ones: Hzf-Mg (n = 16), Abt-Mm (n = 19), MtkMg (n = 12), Mtk-Mm (n = 63), Tml-Mg (n = 17) and
Tml-Mm (n = 19). We used FSTAT version 2.9.3.2 [46]
for the following analyses. We estimated global F-statistics and FST between pairs of samples according to Weir
and Cockerham [47]. We tested for deviations from
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for each locus and over all
loci in each sample with 54,000 permutations of the original data. We tested for linkage disequilibria for all
pairs of loci in each sample with the aid of LINKDOS
[48] as implemented in GENETIX version 4.05.2 [49].
Identification of hybrids

We used two Bayesian methods implemented in the
programs STRUCTURE version 2.1 [50] and NEWHYBRIDS version 1.1 [51] to identify hybrids based on individual microsatellite genotypes in comparison to
mitochondrial haplotypes. We used three datasets of
microsatellite genotypes: One large dataset comprised all
individuals in the study; two smaller ones comprised all
individuals at Mangatsiaka and all individuals at
Tsimelahy.
With NEWHYBRIDS, we estimated posterior probabilities to belong to one of six predefined categories of
purebreds and hybrids for each individual’s genotype.
We used the default genotype frequency class file with

Page 6 of 17

the following categories: Mg (purebred Microcebus griseorufus), Mm (purebred M. murinus), F1 (Mg × Mm),
F2 (F1 × F1) and two classes of first generation backcrosses Mg-Bx1 (F1 × Mg) and Mm-Bx1 (F1 × Mm).
We performed Markov chain Monte Carlo computations with a burnin period of 100,000 steps and a postburnin period of 1,000,000 steps with Jeffreys-like priors
for the mixing proportions and allele frequencies and
without prior population or allele frequency information. As recommended by Vähä and Primmer [52], we
used a threshold of 0.5 as criterion for the detection of
hybrids and the distinction between hybrid categories.
We regarded an individual as purebred when the posterior probability to be purebred from the species corresponding to its mitochondrial haplotype was > 0.5, as a
hybrid when it was ≤0.5 and as a specific category of
hybrid when the corresponding posterior probability was
> 0.5.
STRUCTURE performs a Bayesian clustering of genotypes into a number of clusters K predefined by the user
and estimates membership coefficients as posterior
probabilities for each genotype to belong to each of the
K clusters. We used the admixture ancestry model with
independent allele frequencies and without prior population information. We fixed the allele frequency parameter lambda to one and let the program estimate a
uniform value for the model parameter alpha. We performed 10 independent runs with a burnin of 10,000
generations and a post-burnin period of 40,000 generations for different values of K from 1 to 9 for the large
dataset and from 1 to 5 for the two smaller datasets.
We then used the ad hoc statistic ΔK [53] to determine
the most appropriate number of clusters for our data.
ΔK unambiguously indicated K = 2 as most appropriate
for all datasets. We then performed optimal alignments
of the results from the 10 independent runs with K = 2
for each dataset and calculated average membership
coefficients using the full-search algorithm of CLUMPP
version 1.1.1 [54]. We applied a threshold of 0.1 to the
membership-coefficients as criterion for hybrid detection. We regarded an individual as purebred when the
average membership coefficient for the cluster corresponding to its mitochondrial haplotype was > 0.9 and
as a hybrid when it was ≤ 0.9.
Analyses of simulated microsatellite data

In order to evaluate the power of our microsatellite data
to detect hybrids and to distinguish between different
hybrid classes, we analyzed simulated datasets with
STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS. Within our original
microsatellite genotypes, we identified all individuals
observed as purebred from the species corresponding to
their mitochondrial haplotypes with probabilities > = 0.9
both with STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS. We then

Hapke et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:297
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/297

used these individuals’ genotypes to create simulated
datasets with the software HYBRIDLAB version 1.0 [55].
We analyzed three sets of simulated data:
Simulation A: We simulated 100 datasets, which each
contained genotypes of 100 Mg (purebred Microcebus
griseorufus), 100 Mm (purebred M. murinus), 10 F1 (Mg
× Mm) and 10 F2 (F1 × F1). Each file further contained
genotypes that we call first generation backcrosses, 10
Mg-Bx1 (F1 × Mg) and 10 Mm-Bx1 (F1 × Mm) and
second generation backcrosses, 10 Mg-Bx2 (Mg-Bx1 ×
Mg) and 10 Mm-Bx2 (Mm-Bx1 × Mm). We analyzed all
simulated datasets with STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS under the same settings as our real data. With
STRUCTURE, we performed 10 independent runs with
K = 2 for each dataset and summed up the results with
CLUMPP. We evaluated different threshold values of
0.3, 0.2 and 0.1 for hybrid detection. With NEWHYBRIDS, we used a threshold value of 0.5 as with the real
data. We then calculated efficiency and accuracy similar
to Vähä and Primmer [52]. Efficiency is the proportion
of individuals of a certain category correctly identified
(e.g. true F1-hybrids identified as hybrids), and accuracy
is the proportion of individuals assigned to a certain
category that was correctly identified (e.g. individuals
identified as purebred M. griseorufus that are truly purebred of that species).
Simulation B: At Mangatsiaka, we had sampled 12
individuals with griseorufus-like and 63 with murinuslike mitochondrial haplotypes. We questioned if the
number of hybrids that we observed in the real data at
Mangatsiaka could be an artifact due to these unequal
sample sizes. We simulated a scenario where all individuals at Mangatsiaka are purebred with the aid of 100
datasets, which comprised each 12 purebred Microcebus
griseorufus and 63 purebred M. murinus. We analyzed
these datasets under the same settings as the real data
with both programs and calculated the proportions of
datasets where the number of false-positive hybrids was
as great as or greater than the number of hybrids
detected in the real data.
Simulation C: In the real data, we had identified several individuals as hybrids with only one of both programs or in only one of two datasets. We questioned if
such discrepancies more probably indicated false-positive or false-negative hybrids. We used real genotypes of
purebred Microcebus griseorufus and M. murinus from
Tsimelahy to simulate 100 local datasets with the same
size and composition as in simulation A. We then
enlarged each dataset by adding 100 purebred individuals of each species, which we simulated based on
purebred genotypes from Hazofotsy and Ambatoabo.
We analyzed all local and enlarged datasets with both
programs under the same settings as in simulations A
and B and evaluated the proportions of true hybrids

among classifications that were discrepant between programs or datasets. We then combined the evidence
from both programs and corresponding datasets by
accepting all individuals as hybrids that we identified as
such at least once and calculated efficiencies and
accuracies.

Results
Mitochondrial haplotypes and phylogenetic
reconstructions

We observed 23 different haplotypes among the 159
individuals [GenBank:JF510161-JF510319] (See also
Additional file 2: Genotypes.). Figure 3 displays a tree
reconstruction based on Bayesian inference. All tree
reconstructions yielded two well-supported major clades
with Bayesian posterior probabilities of 1.00 and 0.90,
maximum parsimony bootstrap values of 100 and 99
and maximum likelihood bootstrap values of 100 each.
The clades had identical haplotype compositions in all

tree reconstructions and each one contained one of the
two reference haplotypes. We could thus unambiguously
assign all haplotypes to either Microcebus griseorufus or
M. murinus. We assigned 10 haplotypes, which represented 46 individuals, to Microcebus griseorufus and 13
haplotypes, which represented 113 individuals, to M.
murinus.
Spatial distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes

The spatial distribution of haplotypes of the two species
displayed a pattern of close association with different
habitats. Haplotypes of Microcebus griseorufus occurred
in spiny bush exclusively 760 to 1310 m from the nearest watercourse at Hazofotsy, 70-460 m at Mangatsiaka,
110-650 m at Tsimelahy and 250 m at Ebosika. Haplotypes of Microcebus murinus occurred at all sites with
gallery forest and were absent at Hazofotsy, where we
set traps only in spiny bush (Table 1, Figures 1 and 3).
We observed the majority of individuals with murinuslike haplotypes in gallery forest. They occurred also in
the adjacent spiny bush with distances to the nearest
watercourse up to 260 m at Ambatoabo, 90 m at
Ankoba, 680 m at Mangatsiaka, 130 m at Tsimelahy and
460 m at Ebosika. At Ebosika, we found some individuals in marginal parts of adjacent rainforest up to 150
m from the margin. We observed haplotypes of both
species at Mangatsiaka, Tsimelahy and Ebosika. There
was considerable spatial overlap of both species within
the spiny bush at Mangatsiaka, but not at Tsimelahy
(Figure 4). We could not further investigate this at

Mangatsiaka

Ebosika, where only one individual with a griseorufuslike haplotype occurred. With some caution, we can use
the mitochondrial data as indirect clues on differences
of relative abundances between sites. The proportions of
individuals with murinus- and griseorufus-like haplotypes
at Mangatsiaka (Mtk) and Tsimelahy (Tml) were significantly different according to Fisher’s exact test when
including all individuals (Mtkall:63/12, Tmlall:19/17, twosided p all : 0.001) and when including only individuals
captured more than 50 m from the nearest watercourse
(Mtk spiny : 26/12, Tml spiny : 3/17 Mg, two-sided p spiny :
0.000). The same held true after exclusion of individuals
identified as hybrids (Mtk all : 54/8, Tmlall : 19/16 twosided pall: 0.001 and Mtkspiny: 24/8, Tmlspiny: 3/16 twosided p spiny : 0.000). These observations suggest that
Microcebus murinus predominates at Mangatsiaka while
both species appear to be similarly abundant at Tsimelahy. In the spiny bush more than 50 m from the nearest watercourse, relative abundances seem to have
inverse proportions with a majority of Microcebus murinus at Mangatsiaka and of M. griseorufus at Tsimelahy.
The average proportion of murinus-like haplotypes
among the 6 nearest neighbors of griseorufus-like individuals was 68% at Mangatsiaka and 20% at Tsimelahy.
The average diameters of neighborhoods were very similar at both sites with 259 m at Mangatsiaka and 245 m
at Tsimelahy. Resampling to equal sample sizes with
both species’ haplotypes reduced the proportion of murinus-like haplotypes in the neighborhood of Microcebus
griseorufus to 46% at Mangatsiaka and 19% at

Tsimelahy. Elimination of all murinus-like individuals
trapped more than 50 m from the nearest watercourse
at Mangatsiaka reduced it to 50% and additional resampling to equal numbers of both species’ haplotypes to
42%. We observed similar differences between these
sites with different numbers of nearest neighbors
included in the calculations (Additional file 3: Proportion of Microcebus murinus within the nearest neighborhood of M. griseorufus and Additional file 4: Diameters
of neighborhoods with different numbers of nearest
neighbors). In summary, these results indicate that there
is considerably more spatial overlap between individuals
with murinus- and griseorufus-like haplotypes at Mangatsiaka than at Tsimelahy. The greater overlap at Mangatsiaka is influenced both by the greater relative
abundance of murinus-like individuals and by their
stronger invasion of the spiny bush.
Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage
disequilibria

Global F-statistics indicated heterozygote deficiency on
the global level (FIT = 0.192), which was more due to
heterozygote deficiency within local samples (F IS =
0.137) than to differences of allele frequencies between
samples (FST = 0.063). Pairwise FST values were small
(0.0055-0.0339) between samples with mitochondrial
haplotypes of the same species and considerably greater
(0.0861-0.1128) between samples with haplotypes of different species (Table 2). We observed significant heterozygote deficiencies in tests over all loci for individuals
with griseorufus- and murinus-like mitochondrial haplotypes at Mangatsiaka and for individuals with murinuslike haplotypes at Ambatoabo and Tsimelahy with FIS
values in a range from 0.101 to 0.210 (Table 3). Tests
for single loci were more often significant in samples
with murinus-like haplotypes than in those with griseorufus-like haplotypes (Table 3). We observed several
pairs of loci in significant linkage disequilibrium after
strict Bonferroni correction in each sample (Table 3).
Individuals with murinus-like haplotypes at Mangatsiaka
displayed the greatest number of significant locus pairs
(16 of 36). Although significant, linkage disequilibria
were not strong in most cases: The respective

coefficients of correlation were below 0.4 in 95% of the
significant tests.
Identification of hybrids

We identified 18 of the 159 individuals as hybrids in one
or several analyses (Figure 5). Although there was a high
level of congruence between the different analyses, the
individual identification of hybrids differed in cases
between datasets and programs. Within the great dataset,
we identified 13 individuals as hybrids. Within the two
local datasets of Mangatsiaka and Tsimelahy, we identified 5 additional individuals. Twelve identified hybrids
had mitochondrial haplotypes of Microcebus murinus, 6
of M. griseorufus. All hybrids identified by STRUCTURE
had mitochondrial haplotypes of Microcebus murinus.
NEWHYBRIDS identified hybrids with both species’ haplotypes. Hybrids with griseorufus-like haplotypes were
restricted to the spiny bush, hybrids with murinus-like
haplotypes occurred in the spiny bush and in gallery forest. Hybrids were unevenly distributed over sampling
sites: 13 of 18 hybrid individuals were observed at Mangatsiaka. Backcross- and F2-signals dominated among the
hybrid classes indicated by NEWHYBRIDS. No individual
was assigned to the class of F1 hybrids.

for hybrids, particularly first- and second generation
backcrosses (Mg-Bx1, Mm-Bx1, Mg-Bx2, Mm-Bx2),
which were often misclassified as purebreds (Tables 4, 5
Additional file 5: Simulation A, STRUCTURE, observed
proportions with a threshold of 0.1). The efficiency of
hybrid detection with STRUCTURE decreased dramatically when we used threshold values greater than 0.1,
whereas accuracies did not increase considerably (Table
4). We therefore concluded that the threshold value of
0.1, which we had applied to our real data, was an optimal choice. Beyond the detection of hybrids as such, the
distinction between specific hybrid categories with
NEWHYBRIDS was less efficient and less accurate
(Table 5). We can thus not determine with certainty,
which category the hybrids identified in our real data
truly belong to. This would presumably require a greater
number of loci [52]. At least we can conclude that F1hybrids are probably rare because there are almost no
signals for this class in the real data, whereas simulation
A indicates that we should correctly identify more than
half of them.

The table displays the proportions of simulated individuals assigned to different categories, efficiencies and accuracies. Columns: observed categories, rows: true
categories, last row: accuracies, bold: efficiencies, Mg: purebred Microcebus griseorufus, Mm: purebred M. murinus, F1: Mg × Mm, F2: F1 × F1, Mg-Bx1: F1 × Mg,
Mm-Bx1: F1 × Mm, Mg-Bx2: Mg-Bx1 × Mg, Mm-Bx2: Mm-Bx1 × Mm, H.u.c.: hybrid of unclear category. We did not set up additional observed categories for
second generation backcrosses in the genotype frequency class file used with NEWHYBRIDS. For this reason, we counted Mg-Bx2 assigned to Mg-Bx1 and MmBx2 assigned to Mm-Bx1 as correctly identified.

The simulated scenario of no hybridization at Mangatsiaka appears as highly improbable with respect to the
results of simulation B (Additional file 6: Simulation B:
Scenario of no hybrids at Mangatsiaka). Most simulated
purebred individuals were correctly identified with both
programs. The number of purebred Microcebus murinus
misclassified as hybrids was smaller than the number of
hybrids with murinus-like haplotypes detected in the
real data with both programs in all simulated datasets.
The respective number for Microcebus griseorufus was
reached in only 4% of the simulated datasets with
NEWHYBRIDS.
Almost all discrepancies between programs and datasets in simulation C concerned true hybrids that
remained undetected with one of the programs or in one
of two datasets (Table 6). Accepting all hybrids identified
with at least one program in at least one dataset led to a
considerable increase of hybrid detection efficiency while
the hybrid accuracy remained very high. Even with this
approach, several true hybrids remained completely
undetected in every dataset, and we always underestimated the true number of hybrids. Based on these findings, we conclude that most of the 18 hybrids that we
identified in the real data are probably true hybrids and
that we probably underestimate their true number.

Discussion
Our results demonstrate that Microcebus griseorufus and
M. murinus hybridize within the spiny-gallery contact
zone. In the following, we discuss our findings from this
area and compare them to those from the gradient contact zone. We refer to Gligor et al. [30] for a more
detailed characterization of the latter.
Environmental settings

The environmental settings are very different in both
contact zones. In the spiny-gallery zone, a network of

narrow gallery forests penetrates the dry spiny bush.
Both habitats border each other sharply without intermediate zones between them. In the gradient contact
zone, there is a large climatic gradient with an approximately 10 km wide intermediate zone with transitional
forests between dry spiny bush west of it and humid littoral forests to the east.
Local admixture of mitochondrial haplotypes

According to the distributions of mitochondrial haplotypes in our study area, Microcebus griseorufus appears
as strictly bound to the spiny bush and M. murinus as
closely associated with the gallery forest. The fact that
the latter also invades adjacent habitats of different
types leads to local sympatric admixture within the
spiny bush at Mangatsiaka. This is in contrast to observations at other places. At Beza Mahafaly in southwestern Madagascar, Heckman et al. [32] observed only
griseorufus-like mitochondrial haplotypes despite morphological evidence for the presence of both species
[21,56]. At Berenty, west of our study area, Yoder et al.
[31] observed mitochondrial haplotypes of Microcebus
murinus in gallery forests and of M. griseorufus in adjacent spiny bush without admixture. In the gradient contact zone investigated by Gligor et al. [30], griseorufuslike haplotypes where restricted to spiny bush and murinus-like haplotypes to transitional and littoral forest.
Directionality of hybridization

Other than in the gradient contact zone, we observed
hybrids with mitochondrial haplotypes of both species
in the spiny-gallery contact zone. The number of
detected hybrids indicates a limited degree of hybridization although we might have underestimated it. F1hybrids are apparently rare. It appears thus as probable
that F2-hybrids are rare as well and that most hybrids
are backcrosses or crosses between backcrosses. This

would indicate that the formation of F1-hybrids is more
difficult than the interbreeding of hybrids with purebreds or with other hybrids, which would provide
opportunities for introgression as soon as a few hybrids
exist [2,57]. Our results point to a limited degree of
bidirectional introgressive hybridization, which would
also be in line with the observation of heterozygote deficiencies and linkage disequilibria in subsamples of both
species separated according to their mitochondrial haplotypes. The directionality of introgressive hybridization
is not to be confounded with the directionality of habitat-invasion. The latter is apparently unidirectional
because Microcebus murinus invades the spiny bush,
whereas we have no evidence for an invasion of the gallery forest by M. griseorufus.
Gligor et al. [30] did not apply a threshold value for
hybrid detection when using STRUCTURE. In their
study, ΔK [53] indicated K = 2 as the most probable
uppermost structure but there was also some support
for K = 3. We re-evaluated the original results of Gligor
et al. [30] with K = 2 and applied a threshold of 0.1 as
in our study presented here. Among 38 individuals from
the transition zone, we identified 28 hybrids in a large
dataset and 35 hybrids in a smaller dataset (Additional
file 7: Re-evaluated identification of hybrids in the

gradient contact zone). All individuals in the spiny bush
and littoral forest were classified as purebred. With K =
3, most individuals from the transition zone formed a
third cluster of genotypes, while those from the spiny
bush and littoral forest were assigned to the other two
clusters [30]. None of the murinus-like mitochondrial
haplotypes in the transition zone occurred in the littoral
forests further east. Based on this observation and their
results from microsatellite data, Gligor et al. [30] concluded on a unidirectional introgression of griseorufuslike nuclear alleles into autochthonous populations of
Microcebus murinus in the transition zone.
Asymmetry of hybridization and mechanism of secondary
contact

Despite bidirectionality, hybridization in the spiny-gallery contact zone is apparently asymmetric since the
majority of hybrids carry murinus-like mitochondrial
haplotypes, which is similar to the gradient contact
zone, where all hybrids carry murinus-like haplotypes.
In the spiny-gallery zone, secondary contact occurs
most probably within the habitat of Microcebus griseorufus, which is invaded by M. murinus. In the gradient
contact zone, the respective mechanism is unknown
since Gligor et al. [30] did not detect recent purebred

immigrants in either direction. They discussed cytonuclear incompatibility [58,59] versus environmental
selection, potentially on cyto-nuclear gene complexes (e.
g. [60]), as possible causes for asymmetric introgression.
Our findings in the spiny-gallery contact zone now contradict strict incompatibility of either species’ mitochondrial genome with a hybridized nuclear background.
Locally unequal abundances of both species in the
spiny-gallery contact zone could play a role for asymmetric hybridization. This is most obvious at Mangatsiaka, where we observed most hybrids and where
Microcebus murinus appears to be more abundant than
its congener.
Microcebus griseorufus appears as a specialist
restricted to the southern spiny bush and M. murinus as
a generalist that colonizes a wider range of habitats
within an extremely large range from northern to southeastern Madagascar. In general, widespread species tend
to be locally more abundant than species with restricted
ranges. This has been explained by metapopulation
dynamics [61] and by Brown’s [62] niche-breadth
hypothesis, which predicts that among closely related
species, those with the broader niche will be both locally
more abundant and more widespread. It remains, however, questionable if greater ecological plasticity alone
can explain the apparent success of Microcebus murinus
at Mangatsiaka. According to Ganzhorn and Schmid
[63], the species is extremely sensitive to altered environmental conditions. They compared populations in primary and secondary dry deciduous forest in western
Madagascar. In secondary forest, Microcebus murinus
displayed lower population densities and extremely
small year-to-year survival rates. The authors explained
this by higher ambient temperatures and lower availability of tree holes, which decreased the possibilities for
energy-saving daily torpor and hibernation.
Evidence for environmental factors influencing
hybridization

The significant linkage disequilibria and heterozygote
deficiencies in the spiny-gallery zone could most likely
point to selection against or in favor of certain allelic
combinations in the course of introgressive hybridization. Theoretically, they could also be produced by
recent intraspecific admixture, e.g. in the course of colonization-recolonization dynamics, but, with respect to
very small pairwise FST values between samples of the
same mitochondrial species, such a scenario appears not
very plausible. As well, in the gradient-contact zone, significant heterozygote deficiencies and linkage disequilibria, which were mostly restricted to the transition
zone, pointed to selection [30]. Environmental selection
appears as probable in both zones because genetic patterns are congruent with habitat patterns. The

Page 13 of 17

distribution of purebreds and hybrids in the spiny-gallery zone closely reflects the mosaic-like distribution of
spiny bush and gallery forest. In the gradient zone, three
clusters of genotypes observed with STRUCTURE with
K = 3 were largely congruent with the three vegetation
zones along the west-eastern climatic gradient [30].
With K = 2, membership coefficients were predominantly griseorufus-like in the western part of the transition zone and predominantly murinus-like in the eastern
part (Additional file 7: Re-evaluated identification of
hybrids in the gradient contact zone). Genetic distances
between sites were significantly correlated with vegetation zone differences under control of geographic distances [30].
Possible environment-related processes in the two
contact zones

A remaining open question is why we did observe heterozygote deficiencies and linkage disequilibria at several
sampling sites in the spiny-gallery zone, where we identified no or few hybrids. One could explain this by the
difficult detection of hybrids, which might be more pronounced in smaller local samples. Another potential
explanation could be temporal change of the frequency
of hybridization, which could be due to stochastically
fluctuating environmental conditions. Indeed, there is
some evidence for strong environmental stochasticity
that could have an important impact on hybridization in
the spiny-gallery contact zone. According to Dewar and
Richard [64], Madagascar has significantly less predictable rainfall than continental Africa. In the North and
the South, this unpredictability takes the form of high
interannual variation of total precipitation. The weather
station at Behara, which is situated 18 km west of Mangatsiaka in our study area, displayed a mean annual
rainfall of 532 mm and the least predictable climate
among 15 weather stations throughout Madagascar
included in the study of Dewar and Richard [64]. The
climate in our study area is characterized by a short
rainy season and a long dry season (e.g. [65]). The
region is irregularly struck by severe droughts, which
can last one or several subsequent years [66-68].
According to Elmqvist et al. [69], the frequency of
droughts in southern Madagascar is increasing since the
1970’s (but see [68]). Without long-term data from our
study area, we can only speculate how these dramatic
fluctuations of rainfall might influence hybridization.
Neaves et al. [7] discuss density fluctuations of sympatric grey kangaroos due to fluctuations in rainfall as
potential cause of occasional hybridization. A hypothetical scenario for our study area could be that density
fluctuations due to irregular rainfall are most pronounced for Microcebus murinus, which is adapted to
more mesic conditions. Such fluctuations could even

Hapke et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:297
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/297

follow different rhythms or have different amplitudes
near gallery forests with headwaters in the spiny bush or
in the rainforest. Occasional high densities would lead
to increased overlap with Microcebus griseorufus and
subsequent hybridization. Intermittent droughts could
reduce the density of Microcebus murinus, reduce invasive pressure and shift the adaptive landscape towards
more divergent selection, which could help to maintain
species integrity.
Pollen data from southern Madagascar [70] and subfossil remains at Andrahomana cave [71-73] indicate
that the vegetation zones in the gradient contact zone
could have shifted in eastward direction in the course of
long-term aridification during the last 3000 years
approximately. Accordingly, Gligor et al. [30] propose
that such a shift of the adaptive landscape would have
provided a growing advantage for introgressing griseorufus-like alleles. The apparently strong degree of hybridization within the transition zone could thus result from
long-term past introgression. Without long-term climate
data from this area, it remains unclear if selection in the
course of ongoing aridification could be responsible for
heterozygote deficiencies and linkage disequilibria within
the transition zone. It could even be possible that shortterm climatic fluctuations superimpose a long-term
trend of aridification and contribute to ongoing change
of environmental selective pressures.
Potential adaptive value of hybridization and
maintenance of distinctiveness

The environment-related process proposed by Gligor et
al. [30] implies an adaptive value of hybridization in the
gradient zone, which facilitates adaptation to changing
environmental conditions. In the spiny-gallery zone, so
far, we have regarded the apparently great relative abundance of Microcebus murinus at Mangatsiaka as a prerequisite that possibly facilitated hybridization. In fact, we
were astonished to see that the great majority of individuals at this site carried murinus-like haplotypes
because it appeared as suboptimal habitat for the species. The headwaters of the temporary watercourses at
Mangatsiaka are situated within dry spiny bush to the
north and northeast, while those of all other gallery forests in our study are situated in the eastern rainforest.
Accordingly, there is only very sparse gallery vegetation
at Mangatsiaka. It appears now as possible that Microcebus murinus locally adapted to dryer conditions at Mangatsiaka and that hybridization could have facilitated
this adaptation.
There is increasing evidence for potentially beneficial
consequences of hybridization such as facilitation of
adaptability and diversification [2,3,8]. Hybridization can
enhance the invasibility of intruding species [74]. For
Microcebus griseorufus in turn, one could expect rather

Page 14 of 17

negative consequences of hybridization. Hybridization
with a more common, widespread invader is potentially
deleterious and often seen as a threat for rare specialized endemics [4,5]. On the other hand, hybridizing
species can remain distinct when hybrid zones are narrow [9] or when genotypes display bimodal distributions
[6,75]. Even rare endemic specialists can maintain distinctiveness despite hybridization with a more common
invader [76].
Microcebus griseorufus and M. murinus maintain their
distinctiveness in the two contact zones in different
ways. In the gradient contact zone, introgressed populations in transitional forest cannot be assigned to either
parental species, but the two species remain distinct in
adjacent spiny bush and littoral forest. In the spiny-gallery contact zone, the strongly bimodal microsatellite
genotypes and their concordance with mitochondrial
haplotypes indicate that selection is apparently strong
enough to preserve the distinctiveness of both species
in the face of local sympatric admixture and bidirectional introgressive hybridization. This does not preclude the potential acquisition of single beneficial
adaptations. The identification of respective candidate
loci, however, would require a genome wide scan with
numerous loci.

Conclusions
Microcebus griseorufus and M. murinus are sister species, but they are not among the most closely related
species of mouse lemurs detected so far (e.g. [27,29,39]).
The fact that they hybridize generates the expectation
that hybrid zones between further species of mouse
lemurs could exist or could have existed in the past.
Our study demonstrates that the two species display
very different patterns of hybridization under different
ecological conditions. This highlights the importance of
environmental factors for the formation of different
kinds of contact zones. Our results show that the transition zone of southeastern Madagascar harbors different
hybrid zones in very different ecological settings within
a small geographic area. This exemplifies that a multitude of opportunities for the formation of different contact and hybrid zones might exist or have existed within
the complex biogeography of Madagascar that still need
to be explored. Our study points to interesting perspectives on the potential role of hybridization in the evolution of Madagascar’s endemics that require further
investigation: It appears as possible that macroendemic
species acquire beneficial adaptations through hybridization with microendemic congeners that allow them to
extend their ranges into novel kinds of habitat. At the
same time, the two hybrid zones of mouse lemurs exemplify that species can maintain distinctiveness despite
introgressive hybridization.

Hapke et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:297

Madagascar’s biogeography has been repeatedly
reshuffled during the Pleistocene and Holocene climatic
fluctuations. These processes appear as rather recent
and rapid when compared to phylogenetic timescales.
Consequently, their importance for the diversification of
endemics in Madagascar is controversial [15,16,18,24]. It
might be possible to reconcile these conflicting views
partially when we pay more attention to the rapid evolutionary process of hybridization.
