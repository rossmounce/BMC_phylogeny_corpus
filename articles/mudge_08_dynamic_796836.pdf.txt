Abstract
Background: The major urinary proteins (MUPs) of Mus musculus domesticus are deposited in
urine in large quantities, where they bind and release pheromones and also provide an individual
'recognition signal' via their phenotypic polymorphism. Whilst important information about MUP
functionality has been gained in recent years, the gene cluster is poorly studied in terms of
structure, genic polymorphism and evolution.
Results: We combine targeted sequencing, manual genome annotation and phylogenetic analysis
to compare the Mup clusters of C57BL/6J and 129 strains of mice. We describe organizational
heterogeneity within both clusters: a central array of cassettes containing Mup genes highly similar
at the protein level, flanked by regions containing Mup genes displaying significantly elevated
divergence. Observed genomic rearrangements in all regions have likely been mediated by
endogenous retroviral elements. Mup loci with coding sequences that differ between the strains
are identified - including a gene/pseudogene pair - suggesting that these inbred lineages exhibit
variation that exists in wild populations. We have characterized the distinct MUP profiles in the
urine of both strains by mass spectrometry. The total MUP phenotype data is reconciled with our
genomic sequence data, matching all proteins identified in urine to annotated genes.
Conclusion: Our observations indicate that the MUP phenotypic polymorphism observed in wild
populations results from a combination of Mup gene turnover coupled with currently unidentified
mechanisms regulating gene expression patterns. We propose that the structural heterogeneity
described within the cluster reflects functional divergence within the Mup gene family.

Background

Communication between conspecifics mediates such interactions as mate choice, parental care and territory defense.
Whilst higher primates employ vocalization and visual display for these purposes, many other mammals communicate
chiefly by the use of chemical messengers in the form of scent
[1]. Human urination performs a purely excretory function;
the urine of the house mouse Mus musculus domesticus, in
contrast, is replete with liver-expressed major urinary proteins (MUPs), encoded by a multigene family (Mup genes) on
chromosome 4 [2,3]. Notably, the human genome contains a
single Mup pseudogene [4].
In mice, urinary MUPs are key semiochemicals in several facets of non-overlapping M. m. domesticus behavior, including
both male to male and male to female interactions [5-13].
MUPs are characterized as an eight stranded beta-barrel
structure that encloses a hydrophobic pocket, which in turn
binds male specific pheromones 2-sec-butyl 4,5-dihydrothiazole (thiazole) and 3,4-dehydro-exo-brevicomin (brevicomin)
[14-16]. Sequestration of volatile molecules within MUPs
delays their evaporation from a scent mark, such that a
deposit is detectable for hours as opposed to seconds [17]. In
addition to a role in pheromone release, MUPs also communicate information directly. In wild mice, the MUP profile is
stable and highly polymorphic: 8 to 14 MUPs are typically
detected in each adult individual by electrophoretic separation, with only certain close relatives excreting the same set of
molecules [3,9,12,18]. Selective cross-breeding of wild mice
and the manipulation of MUP profiles using recombinant
molecules have allowed us to conclude that mice remember
and distinguish between the profiles of conspecifics; MUPs
thus convey an individual recognition signal [6,9,19]. However, certain MUPs are also present in female urine, though at
lower concentrations [3,20], and mice avoid inbreeding with
very close relatives sharing the same MUP phenotype [12].
Females also preferentially associate with Mup heterozygous
males [13]. The efficiency of pheromone binding varies dramatically between specific proteins [21,22], suggesting that
the gene cluster contains divisions of functionality that are
currently uncharacterized. Finally, not all MUPs are excreted
in urine, with the transcription of specific Mup genes having
been detected in mammary, parotid, sublingual, submaxillary
and lachrymal glands [22-24]. The function of such non-urinary MUPs is poorly understood, although it is possible to
envisage similar communication roles between mother and
offspring, delivered through milk, saliva or even tears.
The extreme heterogeneity of the MUP profile in wild mice
has only recently been established as most laboratory work
has focused on inbred strains, typically C57BL/6J (henceforth B6) from the C57-related strain genealogy and BALB/c
from the Castle's mice lineage [25]. The MUP profiles of
inbred mice do not vary appreciably between individual
adults of the same sex and strain, although the B6 and BALB/
c strain profiles are distinct [16]. However, our understanding

Volume 9, Issue 5, Article R91

Mudge et al. R91.2

of the genomic organization of the Mup gene cluster lags
behind our knowledge of protein functionality, essentially
due to complexities in obtaining contiguous genome
sequence over the region; the genomic information that has
been gleaned was largely generated during the pre-genome
sequencing era [26-28]. As such, it is unclear whether the distinct phenotypic profiles of individual mice result from genic
polymorphism or variation in gene expression patterns, or
perhaps a combination of the two. Little is known about the
evolution of the Mup gene family, in particular regarding the
relationship between urinary MUPs and non-urinary MUPs,
and between those MUPs that do and do not exhibit sexually
dimorphic expression. It is anticipated that an understanding
of the evolution of the Mup cluster will, in turn, offer insights
into the population dynamics of MUP heterogeneity.
We report here targeted sequencing, detailed annotation and
phylogenetic analysis in an in-depth genomic analysis of the
Mup region of B6 mice. The architecture of the cluster is reconciled with urinary protein expression data, and we propose
a functional divergence within the gene family linked to
organizational heterogeneity, which in turn reflects differing
modes and tempo of evolution. We have also generated a
comparable amount of genomic sequence and new protein
phenotype data from 129 strain mice. These data allow us to
develop a model in which ongoing Mup genomic instability
facilitates phenotypic variation, and ultimately drives the
evolution of mouse behavior.

Results
Analysis of B6 and 129S7 genomic sequences
Whilst efforts to close all remaining sequence gaps in the
mouse genome are ongoing, a targeted attempt to improve
the B6 tile path across the Mup cluster was made as part of
this study. The selection of bacterial artificial chromosome
(BAC) clones from FingerPrinted Contig (FPC) proved to be
partially successful [29], with BACs CT572146 and CR550303
added. However, a parallel strategy based around the
sequencing of B6 fosmid ends from the WIBR-1 library
proved unsuccessful (data not shown). The mapping difficulties result from the high level of sequence conservation within
the repeat elements (see below), and they are not unprecedented; many of the remaining euchromatic sequence gaps in
both the mouse and human genomes are found within regions
containing high-identity sequence repeats, often linked to
gene families (unpublished data and [30]). The difficulties
faced here are therefore symptomatic of a wider problem in
genome sequencing, the solution to which may depend on the
further development of new or existing technologies such as
optical mapping [31]. At present we do not speculate as to the
size of the sequence gaps. The current 'finished' tile path for
this region can be viewed in Ensembl as part of the mouse
NCBIm36 assembly [32].

Schematic view of (a) B6 and (b) S7 Mup clusters
Figure 1
Schematic view of (a) B6 and (b) S7 Mup clusters. The tiling path of BAC clones is indicated by black lines with accession numbers listed. Predicted genes
are represented by triangles, pseudogenes by rectangles. Predicted genes are numbered from the 5' direction independently in both strains; official names
acquired by certain Mups based on cDNA sequences are listed as appropriate. Pseudogenes are listed alphabetically. Open triangles within the S7 sequence
represent gene loci with CDSs that differ from their B6 counterparts, or in the case of gene 5 have no equivalent locus. The gray background shading
within the center of each cluster contains those B6 genes and pseudogenes (and S7 equivalents) that form distinct clades within the phylogenetic analysis
presented in Figure 2; the loci within the unshaded peripheral regions form isolated nodes. The calculated weight of the mature protein derived from each
gene in B6 is indicated, with masses of non-equivalent S7 genes also being listed. Masses that correspond to mass spectrometry peaks identified in Figure 5
are highlighted in bold. The protein corresponding to B6 gene 18 has been identified by other methods (Figure 6); we predict that the calculated mass of
the protein does not reflect the urinary mass due to the occurrence of glycosylation (see Results). B6 gene 11 matches closely to an additional protein
mass we have previously identified in fractionated urine [21] (see Results). There are three non-equivalent sequence gaps within the central regions of
both B6 and S7; the ordering of the central contigs presented here is arbitrary. The S7 genomic sequence includes the Tscot and Zfp37 loci, which flank
the cluster in B6 (not shown), indicating that the start and end of the cluster are present. Ignoring gap regions, the B6 cluster is 1.56 Mb in size, the S7
cluster 0.72 Mb.

Figure 1a displays our manual annotation of the Mup cluster
of the B6 genome, this being done in accordance with the criteria of the Vega genome browser resource [33] (see Materials
and methods). There are 19 predicted genes and 18 loci that
are pseudogenes (variously due to frameshifts, exon deletions
and stop codons). However, the presence of three gap regions
within the tiling path indicates that the full complement of
Mup loci is not yet represented. The aligned protein translations from each predicted functional Mup are presented in
Additional data file 1. The first approximately 30 amino acids
of each MUP is a signal peptide sequence, excised from the
mature protein. The following discussions discount this
sequence, although observed variation in these signals may
have unappreciated roles in, for example, protein localization
[34].

A neighbor-joining tree of B6 Mup loci was constructed using
intronic sequences (Figure 2). Three points of particular
interest stand out. Firstly, the distinct clade marked A consists of the 13 predicted genes that co-localize within the central portion of the cluster (Figure 1a); we refer to these as
central loci. Assuming a mouse/rat divergence of 12-24 million years ago (Mya) and an average of 0.166 substitutions per
neutral site between loci within the mouse lineage [35], the
timing of the oldest duplication event within this clade is predicted at 1.2-2.4 Mya. Secondly, the pseudogenes present
within the central region also cluster together (clade B), suggesting their propagation occurred by the serial duplication of
an existing pseudogene. Finally, in contrast, the remaining
genes and pseudogenes form distinct isolated nodes, and
these loci flank the central genes on the periphery of the

Phylogenetic analysis of B6 Mup loci
Phylogenetic analysis of B6 Mup loci. This unrooted tree was constructed using intron 2, which has an average size of 766.9 bp. Nodes with a bootstrap
support of less than 700/1,000 replicates are marked with an asterisk, with the exception of those nodes within the clades marked 'A' and 'B' which are, in
general, poorly supported. Numbers and letters at each node refer to genes and pseudogenes, respectively, as annotated in Figure 1a. Pseudogenes O and
P are not present as these partial loci do not contain an adequate portion of intron 2; similar phylogenetic analysis with different sequence indicates that
these pseudogenes also form isolated nodes (data not shown).

oldest divergence amongst the lineage of these genes is estimated at 11.2-22.4 Mya between genes 16 and 19; the timing
of the minimum at 4.4-8.8 Mya between genes 18 and 19. The

topology of this intronic tree is recapitulated by a phylogenetic analysis based on coding sequence (CDS; data not
shown); the central gene CDSs share an average nucleotide
identity of 99.2%, and the peripheral genes 88.2%.

Self comparison of (a) B6 proximal contig AL181738 to CR847872 and (b) distal contig BX001066 to AL683829. Genes and pseudogenes are annotated
as in Figure 1. Loci that form isolated nodes in the phylogeny presented in Figure 2 are boxed in white; those genes and pseudogenes that form respective
clades marked A and B in Figure 2 are boxed in gray.

Figure 3 shows dot-plot analyses of the proximal (Figure 3a)
and distal (Figure 3b) contigs of the Mup cluster. Both contain a transition towards the center of the cluster from a
region of low structural definition into a lattice-like array of
homogenized sequence. The array comprises the tandem
duplication of 14 complete or partial (due to sequence gaps)
80 kb inverted-duplication cassettes, which contain in each
complete case a predicted gene and a pseudogene pair corresponding to the loci in clades A and B, respectively, from Figure 2. The average base-pair sequence identity approximates
to 98% between cassettes, although sub-regions of alignment
are frequently identical over stretches of several kilobases.
Dot-plot analysis of the 23 kb of sequence flanking the breakpoint between gene 4 and pseudogene B, which lie on adjacent cassettes, is presented in Additional data file 2. The
breakpoint corresponds precisely to the location of a murine
endogenous retrovirus (ERV), modified into an inverted
duplication. This same sequence conformation is observed
between each of the central array cassettes. Provirus elements
are known to mediate non-allelic homologous recombination
(NAHR); the male-infertility linked AZFa microdeletions on
human chromosome Y, for example, are caused by NAHR
between HERV15 elements [36]. We thus predict that the

central cassette repeat unit was formed by recombination
between nearby ERV elements.
We have sequenced and annotated seven BACs from the
genome of the 129S7/AB2.2 inbred mouse strain (henceforth
S7). The 129 lineage diverged from the C57-related lineage
early in the 20th century in a manner that was poorly documented [25]. However, recent investigations have confirmed
that the parental line was not inbred before divergence, and
subsequent inbreeding of the separated lineages has fixed distinct patterns of wild genetic variation [37]; differing genomic
segments of C57, 129 mice and other lineages originate variously from M. m. musculus, M. m. domesticus and M. m. castaneus subspecies [38,39]. It is clear that the essential
architecture of the B6 Mup cluster is conserved in S7 (Figure
1b). However, five of the twelve S7 gene loci have either amino
acid substitutions compared with their corresponding B6
genes or else do not have equivalent loci; these differences are
discussed alongside the protein phenotype data below.

Analysis of B6 and 129S5 phenotypic profiles

MUPs, expressed at high concentrations. Accordingly, we

ionization of the protein mixture, generating a complex and
overlapping set of multiply charged ions that can be deconvoluted to yield a mass profile of the urinary MUPs. The resolution of this method is ±2 Da, which is inadequate to resolve

proteins containing, for example, an Asp/Asn substitution,
but which allows many proteins to be unambiguously identified. Although the relative intensities of each peak can be
taken as a semi-quantitative index of abundance, we caution
against over-interpretation of the profiles in this regard, as

MUP expression is subject to developmental and endocrinological control and differences between individuals of the
same sex and strain in the relative amounts of individual
MUPs are evident (Figure 4).
Figure 4 shows average processed electrospray ionization
(ESI) mass spectra derived from the urine of adult male and
female B6 mice (Figure 4a,c) and male and female BALB/c
mice (Figure 4b,d); these spectra match our previously
reported results [16,21]. Previously unreported spectra
obtained from two male and two female adult 129S5 (henceforth S5) urinary samples are superimposed onto the BALB/c
data. The S5 strain is closely related to S7; the lineages were
separated in 1987 from the ancestral inbred 129/Sv stock,
with the latter undergoing a mutation in the hypoxanthine
guanine phosphoribosyl transferase 1 locus [25]. Neither of
these 129 lineages has been outbred with wild mice or crossed
with other inbred strains since their separation. Although
mice inbreeding programs are designed to minimize genetic
drift, this process undoubtedly occurs at low levels both
between and within specific lineages [40,41]. We do not,
therefore, reject out of hand the possibility that there is minor
Mup genomic variation either within B6 and BALB/c or
between S5 and S7.
The spectra from the S5 males comprised three MUPs, corresponding within 1 Da to the three BALB/c peaks at 18,645 Da,
18,693 Da and 18,709 Da, whilst the spectra from the females
of both of the strains contained two MUPs of masses 18,693
Da and 18,709 Da. As well as equivalent peaks at 18,645 Da,
18,709 Da and 18,693 Da, B6 male mice excrete a mass of
18,893 Da not observed in S5 or BALB/c. The genomic annotation of B6 and S7 Mup genes presented in Figure 1 allows us
to reconcile the urinary MUPs we have identified in Figure 4.
This preliminary relationship is summarized below. We have
also examined the transcriptional profile of these loci by comparison against the GenBank sequence database [42].

Observed mass 18,645 Da
MUPs of this mass, observed in all three strains, match to the
calculated mass of 18,644.8 Da for B6 and S7 gene 3, which
have identical translations. The protein is predominantly
expressed in males, but there is some evidence of low expression (typically <5%) in females (Figure 4b,d). There is extensive transcriptional support for this locus from liver-derived
libraries of B6, FVB/N (a distinct lineage from 129/BALB/c
and C57 mice [25]) and BALB/c strains.

Observed mass 18,709 Da
MUPs of this mass, observed in both sexes of all three strains,
are matched to gene 8 in B6 (18,707.9 Da), which lacks transcriptional support from any strain. There is no corresponding gene in the S7 genomic sequence at present; we predict
this locus resides within a gap region.

Volume 9, Issue 5, Article R91

Mudge et al. R91.7

Observed mass 18,693 Da
MUPs of this mass, identified in both sexes of all three strains,
can be matched to seven of the central array genes of B6 (4, 6,
7, 9, 12, 14, 15), five of which (6, 9, 12, 14, 15) have identical
translations except for their signal peptides (Additional data
file 1). Genes 4 and 7 have predicted masses that differ by less
than 1 Da from both each other and that of the five identical
translations; such proteins are indistinguishable at the intact
protein level by the analysis conducted here. However, in previous work combining ESI mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with
anion exchange chromatography we observed that this
18,693 spectral peak in BALB/c actually consists of two MUP
species that can be separated by their charge; we thus now
predict that these distinct proteins are derived from central
array genes that differ by one or few amino acid substitutions
[16]. We did not find evidence for the similar excretion of
charge variants in B6. However, we characterized individual
anion exchange fractions from B6 urine and identified a protein mass at 18,713 that had co-eluted with the 18,693 Da
material [21]; we now link this protein mass to B6 gene 11
(calculated mass 18,712.8 Da). Mass 18,693 corresponds to S7
genes 4, 6, and 7. The majority of gene loci from both B6 and
S7 are supported by transcriptional evidence, invariably from
liver-derived libraries. Note that B6 gene 4 and S7 gene 4 differ by a single amino acid substitution: a Gln/Glu change at
position 13 (Additional data file 1); the S7 gene 4 has a translation identical to that of B6 genes 6, 9, 12, 14 and 15.

Observed mass 18,893 Da
MUPs of mass 18,893 Da correspond to gene 17 in B6
(18,893.2 Da); the protein is predominantly expressed in B6
males (Figure 4a,b) and is thus sexually dimorphic. This locus
is supported by cDNA Em:BC089613, derived from B6 male
liver, and Em:BC092096, derived from FVB/N male liver.
The absence of this protein was previously noted in the urine
of 6 out of 84 male wild mice [21], and in this report the protein mass is undetected in the urine of S5 and BALB/c mice of
both sexes. This S5 result was surprising, since S7 gene 10 has
an identical CDS to B6 gene 17 (Additional data file 1). Also,
S7 gene 9 is equivalent in location to B6 pseudogene Q, yet
this locus has a CDS identical to that of B6 gene 17/S7 gene 10.
We further investigated the relationship between these four
18,893-associated loci in order to explain this non-conformity.
B6 pseudogene Q is classified as such due to the loss of 20 bp
of sequence within exon 4; this deletion has been confirmed
by checking the original whole-genome shotgun data across
this region [43]. A dot-plot comparison of the two 18,893associated B6 duplication regions is displayed in Additional
data file 3. Ignoring the presence of a unique IAPLTR-1 retrotransposon within pseudogene Q, it is clear that the loci were
duplicated as part of a larger event involving 29 kb of
sequence. The proximal breakpoint occurs within the solitary
long terminal repeat of an IAPLTR2 element, whilst the
downstream breakpoint occurs within an ERV element

homologous to those associated with the central array duplications (Additional data file 2). Over the proximal 22 kb the
nucleotide identity between the two regions averages as
99.6%; after this point the similarity drops abruptly, averaging at 92.2% over the final 7 kb. The point of transition occurs
795 bp in the 5' direction from the transcriptional start site,
and it does not correspond to any known transposable elements or repetitive sequence. This pattern of nucleotide identity could be explained by the occurrence of a 22 kb
duplication on top of the site of a pre-existing duplication
event. The genomic sequence of S7 contains the same duplication architecture (not shown).
We examined the DNA sequence up to 5 kb upstream of these
four loci in order to identify changes to potential promoter
elements. Figure 5 displays a portion of the alignment of the
sequences immediately upstream of the transcriptional start
site. The functional B6 gene 17 contains one notable difference: the presence of an extra 13 [A]s and a nearby C/A substitution within an A-rich site 30 bp upstream of the TATAbox element. We observe that similar (though non-identical)
A-rich sites are present in the same location at each predicted
Mup locus, and their presence and putative functionality have
previously been highlighted in the equivalent rat gene family
[44,45]. These elements do not appear to be protein binding
sites. Instead, they may act as spacer elements, affecting transcriptional efficiency by adjusting the distance between the
TATA-box and upstream control elements.

stems from the fact that the sequence contains a potential N(62

modified, increase the mass. However, we have isolated and
identified this protein in male B6 urine using a combination
of gel electrophoresis, tandem mass spectrometry and peptide mass fingerprinting (Figure 6). A minor protein species is
evident in native gel electrophoresis as a low mobility band,
and on SDS-PAGE as a higher mass band (Figure 6a). In both
instances, the bands could be excised and digested with
trypsin or endopeptidase LysC, generating comprehensive
peptide mass fingerprints that permitted unambiguous identification of the protein as that encoded by gene 18. Tandem
mass spectrometry of fragment ions allowed recovery of peptide sequence data; representative data for one such tryptic
fragment (T16: ENIIDLTNVNR, m/z 1,300.7) confirm unambiguously the identity of this protein. Confirmation of the glycosylation status was provided by treatment with
endoglycosaminidase, after which the low mobility/high
mass band on SDS-PAGE disappeared, consistent with it
being glycosylated. Although present at a comparatively low
concentration in urine (less than 2% of total urinary MUP
protein), this peripheral MUP appears to be sexually dimorphic since it cannot be detected in female urine. We have not
yet examined the presence of the equivalent gene product in
129 or BALB/c mice.

methodologies detailed above). Interestingly, three of these
genes do have predicted masses for which we have readily
detected closely matching spectra of 18,666 and 18,682 in a
parallel analysis on wild-derived M. m. domesticus mice
(unpublished data and [46]). These are B6 central array genes
5 (calculated weight 18,664.8 Da), 10 (18,681.9 Da), and 13
(18,682.8 Da), each of which lacks transcriptional support.
This suggests that these loci are not active at detectable levels
in B6 or S7, but are in certain wild individuals. In contrast, we
have never observed a protein mass corresponding to S7 gene
5 (predicted 18,698.9 Da), which has two amino acid substitutions not present in any B6 loci: Asp/Val at position 34 and
Ser/Arg at position 128 (Additional data file 1). However,
both of these positions are variant in other B6 urinary proteins with alternative substitutions, raising the possibility
that the two sites display functional polymorphism. This S7
gene is supported by a single EST, Em:BI256026, derived
from FVB/N liver.
Strikingly, the four remaining genes make up six of the genes
located within the peripheral regions of both strains. Two of
these genes have previously been described as expressing
non-urinary MUPs. Transcription of the B6 gene 1/S7 gene 1
has been described in lachrymal and parotid gland tissue
[23], and the set of cDNAs and ESTs corresponding to this
locus in GenBank are limited to these tissues. The second is
B6 gene 16/S7 gene 8, for which the S7 and B6 CDS differ in
three amino acid positions. The S7 form of the locus is
identical to BALB/c cDNA Em:M16360, a major transcript in
the submaxillary gland [24]; again, there is no liver transcriptional support in GenBank. This is the only MUP to lack a
tyrosine residue at position 121 within the internal binding
cavity of the protein. This residue may have a direct role in ligand binding [22,47], raising the possibility that the submaxillary protein might have profoundly altered ligand specificity,
or may operate in the absence of bound ligand.
The functional status of the two remaining loci is unclear. B6
gene 2/S7 gene 2 has two associated ESTs, Em:CF894970 and
Em:AV585390, derived from distinct undifferentiated
embryo stem cell libraries, although the protein has never
been identified experimentally. Finally, B6 gene 19/S7 gene
12, which differ in one amino acid position, lack the non-coding final exon of other Mup genes, suggesting they may be
pseudogenes in spite of their intact CDS. However, FVB/N
liver ESTs Em:BI146097 and Em:CA478551 indicate the

locus is transcribed in this strain at least, although again there
is no evidence for secretion of the protein.

Discussion

This is the first in depth analysis of the Mup gene clusters of
two distinct strains of mice, strengthened by resolution of the
distinct urinary profiles of these mice alongside their respective gene complements. We have linked our experimental
observations to a combination of structural and phylogenetic
analyses of the cluster, and observe that the region contains a
distinct pattern of organization, with the central and peripheral sections being structurally and phylogenetically distinct.
This appears to reflect differing modes of evolution, which
may be linked to a division of functionality within the cluster.
Figure 7 summarizes the total information now available
regarding the transcriptional and phenotypic profile of the
Mup gene cluster. It must be reiterated that our investigation
has studied inbred laboratory mice and not wild mice. Heterozygous wild males typically contain approximately twice as
many MUPs in urine as inbred males, and it seems a fair
assumption that this increase is due at least in part to heterozygosity across the cluster [3,9,12,18]. It should also be noted
that the human selection of mouse breeding pairs in the
development of laboratory strains over the last hundred years
may have imparted a degree of artificial selection on the Mup
clusters, given that these genes directly influence various
aspects of mouse behavior.

The central region is likely subject to concerted
evolution
The genes within the central array of both B6 and S7 differ by
an average of just 0.8 bp within their CDS, and since an
almost identical degree of nucleotide identity is maintained
across their intronic sequence, this similarity cannot be due
to purifying selection alone. Instead, the homogenized nature
of the central array indicates the action of concerted evolution
[48], which operates via both NAHR and gene conversion
events. The action of concerted evolution is typically demonstrated by comparing the alignment of paralogs from a variety
of species [49]. Here, ambiguities arising from the incomplete
nature of the B6 and S7 genomic sequences limit the value of
a detailed analysis at present. However, the alignment of central B6 MUP proteins 3, 5, 7, 10, 11 and 13, displays mosaicism
in the pattern of amino acid substitutions, indicative of
recombination (Additional data file 1). We predict NAHR

Figure 7 of Mup cluster transcriptional and phenotypic profiles
Summary
Summary of Mup cluster transcriptional and phenotypic profiles. The cluster of B6 is presented as annotated in Figure 1. Red arrows and red text boxes
indicate tissues in which transcription can be confirmed for each locus based on the presence of 100% supporting cDNAs or ESTs in GenBank [42] (whilst
allowing for poor-quality sequence at the immediate 5' and 3' ends for ESTs); blue arrows and blue text boxes indicate genes where a corresponding
protein has been detected in urine. The asterisks marking genes 5, 10 and 13 indicate that potentially corresponding proteins for these loci have previously
been detected in wild mice, but not in the inbred mice studied in this investigation [46] (see Results). Genes 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14 and 15 each have proteins
with predicted masses that can be matched to detected mass 18,693 Da; it is currently unclear which of these loci contribute to the protein peak in Figure
4. Proteins that exhibit sexual dimorphism (being detected in males but not females) are indicated by green arrows and text boxes marked 'Male'.

generates novel Mup genes by recombining mutations from
different cassettes, whilst the action of gene conversion generates polymorphism where single conversion events
between Mup genes result in only partial homogenization
[49-51]. By this model NAHR also causes the continuing
expansion and contraction of the cluster via duplication and
deletion events, potentially involving multiple cassettes; a
recent report into the incidence of murine global copy
number variation highlighted the Mup cluster as varying dramatically in size between different inbred strains [52]. We
predict that the central Mup region is polymorphic in wild
populations, both in terms of copy number and in the specific
loci that are present, and that the ongoing action of concerted
evolution acts to prevent the long-term differentiation of
these Mup genes [53].

The central region may confer self/non-self recognition
MUPs confer a 'signature' of individuality and kinship identity via the highly polymorphic set of proteins excreted by
wild individuals [3,6,12]. The central array of Mup genes
could generate the requisite genetic polymorphism for this
functionality by the ongoing action of point mutation and
concerted evolution. This individuality coding may overlap
with functionality in pheromone binding; interestingly, however, our earlier work showed that the central 18,645 Da,
18,709 Da and 18,693 Da proteins are poor binders of thiazole

compared to the peripheral 18,893 Da protein [21] (see
below). Furthermore, individuality coding appears to function in both male and female mice, and it is noteworthy that
the two MUP peaks identified in the female mice of the three
strains studied here correspond to central genes.
Our analysis indicates that the oldest array duplication events
occurred 1.2-2.4 Mya, although this value may be an
underestimate due to gene conversion. As it stands, the
timing for the expansion of the central array overlaps with the
separation of M. m. domesticus from the Algerian mouse Mus
spretus and eastern European mouse Mus macedonicus lineages around 1.5 Mya [54,55]. Wild M. m. domesticus mice
have higher population densities than M. spretus and M.
macedonicus, and it is believed that the former became commensal alongside the development of human civilization
10,000 years ago [56]. We have recently performed mass
spectrometry analyses on wild M. macedonicus mice captured from different locations, and observed in each case the
same solitary mass peak, indicative of a single protein species
[46]. Similar analyses of five wild-caught M. spretus males
revealed nearly identical individual profiles, in this case consisting of three peaks [57]. We proposed that MUP family
expansion and polymorphism arose in M. m. domesticus to
match a demand for elaborate communication coupled to an
increase in social complexity, and we now predict that this

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R91

acquisition of functionality may have been facilitated by the
expansion of the central Mup cluster.

The peripheral regions are likely subject to birth-anddeath evolution
The six genes that flank the central array (Figure 1) form isolated nodes in the tree in Figure 2, and do not exist within
homogenized cassettes as seen in Figure 3. The divergence of
these loci pre-dates the predicted divergence of the M. m.
domesticus, M. spretus and M. macedonicus lineages [54,55],
falling closer to the estimated divergence of the mouse/rat
lineages 12-24 Mya [35]. The exception is the duplication
event forming the B6 gene 17/pseudogene Q pair, which represents a much more recent event. Thus, whilst we infer the
peripheral regions have a higher degree of structural stability
than the central region, the potential for instability persists.
There are four other pseudogenes in the downstream peripheral region, which do not represent serial duplications. These
observations suggest that birth-and-death evolution is the
dominant mode of change over these regions [53,58],
whereby gene copies are created by duplication and either
acquire functionality or else undergo pseudogenization. By
this model, the differences between the CDS of these loci may
indicate the acquisition of individualized functions in the
absence of homogenization by NAHR. Of the six peripheral
MUP proteins, two appear to be predominantly expressed by
males in urine (B6 genes 17 and 18), two are non-urinary (1
and 16) and two have never been detected experimentally (2
and 19; Figure 7).
It has been suggested that signaling ligands may be transferred from sequestering urinary MUPs to MUPs in the nasal
cavity when a scent mark is investigated [59]. We have previously shown that the 18,893 Da protein sequesters 40% of the
total quantity of thiazole in B6 urine, in spite of the significantly lower concentration of this protein compared with the
other urinary MUPs [21]. Interestingly, the nasally excreted
B6 gene 1 also has a significantly elevated binding affinity for
this ligand [21,22]. It is thus noteworthy that thiazole is a
male-specific ligand, and that the 18,893 Da protein is normally detected only in male urine; we now suggest that these
peripheral MUPs may have evolved in tandem to facilitate
thiazole transfer in a sexually dimorphic manner. The 18,893
mass is undetected in the urine of a minority of male wild
mice [21], although it remains to be seen whether this results
from the loss of this Mup gene, amino acid substitutions that
affect mass but not functionality, or cryptic regulatory
changes (see below). Finally, if our prediction is correct, one
may expect that thiazole transfer is compromised in S5 and
BALB/c mice, given that these strains lack the 18,893 mass
peak; this possibility has yet to be investigated. At present we
do not propose a function for the urinary MUP encoded by B6
gene 18 (Figure 6), although it should be recalled that male
urine contains ligands other than thiazole, most notably brevicomin [14,15].

Volume 9, Issue 5, Article R91

Mudge et al. R91.12

Certain Mup genes appear non-transcribed
The S5 protein profile lacks mass 18,893 Da (Figure 4), contrary to our predictions based on the S7 genomic sequence,
and this mass is also absent in BALB/c. Additionally, there
are three intact CDSs within the B6 central array that match
mass peaks previously observed solely in wild-caught mice
[46] (B6 genes 5, 10 and 13; Figure 7). Four MUPs thus appear
polymorphic at the phenotypic level in a manner that is not
coupled to polymorphism at the genomic level in an obvious
way. However, genic polymorphism is not limited to the CDS.
Mup gene regulation is complex, and trans-acting factors
known to modulate Mup loci (or the equivalent rat loci)
include growth hormone [60], thyroid hormone [61], glucocorticoids [62] and androgens [63]. Certain genes lacking
protein support may contain cryptic promoter or binding site
mutations that impede transcription, and we have identified
an intriguing difference in a putative functional element
unique to the functional B6 gene 17 (Figure 5). It is also noteworthy that evidence exists indicating Mup genes are subject
to methylation, albeit in a manner that is currently not understood [64-66].

Conclusion

Our combination of genome sequencing, annotation and
experimental analysis provides a valuable resource for future
studies into both the functionality and evolution of the gene
family; attempts, in short, to trace the path from Mup genotype to MUP phenotype, and ultimately to mouse behavior.
We predict that differing modes of evolution within the central and peripheral regions of the cluster reflect functional
divergence, with the ongoing occurrence of recombination
within the central cluster generating a rapid turnover of polymorphic gene variants, whilst the peripheral loci acquire specialized functions by divergent evolution. These propositions
will be tested by the future generation of genomic sequence
from other M. m. domesticus mice, mice of other species/subspecies, and perhaps other rodents. However, even considering the urinary MUPs alone, it is clear that the link between
genotype and phenotype is not straightforward. We predict
that the differing MUP profiles of wild mice result from a
combination of the set of Mup loci a particular genome contains coupled with variation in gene expression patterns.
Future progress in genotype/phenotype correlation is thus
likely to coincide with an increase in our understanding of
Mup gene regulation.

Clone selection from C57BL/6J and 129S7 libraries
Candidate B6 BACs were selected from the FPC clone library
in line with standard procedures [29]. A tiling path of candidate BAC clones from the S7 library was selected from Mouse
Ensembl [32] to cover the region of interest in the B6 assembly (NCBI m34) using the BAC end sequence alignment track
[37]. Candidate BAC clones were analyzed using HindIII
restriction fingerprinting and assembled into contigs in FPC
[29] to allow selection of a minimal tiling path. Both the
repetitive nature of the region and the remaining gaps in the
B6 tiling path prevented contiguous coverage from the S7
library (see Results).

Sequencing of C57BL/6J and 129S7 clones
Previous sequencing of the Mup region of B6 revealed a high
level of repeat within the clones. Therefore, each selected S7
BAC clone had 2 pUC19 subclone libraries prepared with
insert sizes of 4-6 kb and 6-9 kb, this combination of insert
sizes having proved expedient for manual finishing of B6
clones. Of the seven clones finished, two utilized this combination of sequence data from both subclone libraries. Both lie
in the central region, which contains an elevated repeat
content (see Results). All pUC subclones utilized were
sequenced with AB Big Dye Terminator Mix v3.1™ and the
data analyzed on AB 3730 automated sequencing instruments at Hinxton, UK. The data were assembled and subjected to automated primer walking, prior to re-assembly
using PHRAP (P Green) and then passed into directed manual finishing for completion to phase 3. The sequences of all
BACs generated in this study have been deposited in GenBank
[42].

Annotation and phylogenetic analysis of genomic
sequence
Genomic sequence from both strains was analyzed as part of
the VEGA project [33]. This involves fully manual gene annotation based on transcriptional evidence; full criteria are
detailed on the website. Manual annotation is desirable over
automated gene building methodologies when describing
homogenous gene clusters. Prior to this analysis the Ensembl
gene build contained numerous chimeric Mup loci that erroneously spliced together exons from adjacent genes; the
Ensembl and Vega gene builds have since been merged [67].
Annotation and dot-plot analyses were performed using inhouse software (J Gilbert). Molecular weights of predicted
proteins (minus signal peptides) were calculated using the
Compute Pi/Mw tool on the ExPASy server [68]. MUPs contain a disulphide bridge between a pair of cysteine residues
conserved in all proteins; 2 Da was deducted from each predicted mass to take this modification into account [69].
Repeats were identified using RepeatMasker [70], and further characterized as appropriate using the RepBase
resources [71]. For phylogenetic analysis the sequence of
intron 2 of each locus for which this sequence was available
was excised and aligned using ClustalW [72] followed by
manual re-alignment where required. Further analysis was

performed using the Phylip software suite [73], using the
neighbor-joining methodology with the Kimura-2-parameter
model, alongside 1,000 bootstrap replicates.

MUP preparation
MUPs were purified from urine by spun-column gel permeation chromatography. Columns (5 ml) were packed with preswollen Sephadex-G25 that was subsequently equilibrated in
deionized water. Excess water was removed from the columns
with a 200 g spin for 2 minutes. An aliquot (200 μl) of urine
was then loaded onto each column, which was spun for a
further 2 minutes at 200 g. The eluent from the column was
captured in 1.5 ml polypropylene test tubes and either submitted immediately for analysis or stored at -20°C. Desalted,
unfractionated MUPs were diluted 1:500 with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile/0.1% (v/v) formic acid, and desalted ion-exchange
fractions were diluted 1:100 with the same diluent prior to
mass spectrometry.

Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
ESI-MS and tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MSMS) were
performed on a Micromass Q-ToF Micro instrument, fitted
with a nanospray source at Liverpool, UK. The electrospray
was created from a silver coated glass capillary with a 10 μm
orifice (New Objective, Woburn, MA, USA), held at a potential of +2,000 V relative to the sample cone. For measurement
of the mass of intact MUPs from B6, BALB/c and S5 mouse
urine, a desalted sample was diluted 1:500 with a solution of
50% (v/v) acetonitrile/0.1% (v/v) formic acid and introduced
into the mass spectrometer by syringe pump infusion (Harvard Instruments Ltd, Edenbridge, UK) at a rate of 0.5 μl/
minute. In this case, the instrument was operated in TOF only
mode, with the quadrupole analyzer operating in Rf only
mode to allow transmission of all ions. Raw data were gathered between 700 and 1,400 Th at a scan/interscan speed of
2.4/0.1 s. These raw data were subsequently de-convoluted
and transformed to a true mass scale using the MaxEnt 1
module contained within the MassLynx 4.0 software, published by the Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA. To
create the MaxEnt damage model, peak width and resolution
parameters of 0.75 Da and 1 Da/channel were used, respectively, and data were processed over the mass range 18,40019,000 Da. For replicate analysis, true mass spectra were normalized to the most abundant protein and aligned using
SpecAlign [74]. The average spectrum was calculated for each
strain and sex, together with the mean ± standard error of the
mean relative peak height for each mass.

Native PAGE
Native PAGE was performed essentially as described by UK
Laemmli [75]. However, no SDS or reducing agents were
included in any of the gel, running or sample buffers. Pooled
urine samples were mixed 1:1 with sample buffer before loading. The gel acrylamide concentration was 20%. Electrophoresis was performed at a constant 200 V for 2 h. Protein
bands were visualized with Coomassie brilliant blue. Loading

oxidation as a variable modification; peptide mass tolerance
was ±250 ppm.

Tandem MS/MS
Deglycosylation
B6 male MUPs were subjected to N-linked oligosaccharide
digestion according to the denaturing protocol for the enzymatic deglycosylation kit (Glyko ProZyme, San Leandro, CA,
USA). Briefly, 20 μg of protein was diluted in 30 μl of water,
10 μl of 5× incubation buffer, and 2.5 μl of denaturation solution; heated for 5 minutes at 100°C; and cooled to room
temperature. Then, 2.5 μl of the detergent solution was added
to the sample, which was then digested with 1 μl of N-glycanase for 3 h at 37°C. Protein band mass shifts due to oligosaccharide cleavage were monitored using SDS-PAGE.

In-gel trypsin digests were analyzed using a LTQ ion trap
mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, Hemel Hempstead,
UK) coupled online to a L3000 nanoflow HPLC (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) equipped with a LC packings PepMap 100
C18 reverse phase column (75 μm internal diameter × 15 cm
length, 3 μm particle size, 100 Å pore size). Tandem MS spectra were submitted to MASCOT to search MSDB [75]. MS/MS
ion search parameters were set to tolerate a maximum of one
missed enzyme cleavage with carbamidomethyl cysteine as a
fixed modification, methionine oxidation as a variable modification; peptide mass tolerance was ±1.2 Da, and fragment
mass tolerance was ±0.6 Da.

In-gel enzyme digestion
Plugs were removed from protein bands on the native PAGE
gel using a thin glass pipette and placed into microcentrifuge
tubes. Each gel plug was destained using 100 μl of 50 mM
ammonium bicarbonate, 50% (v/v) acetonitrile (trypsin) or
100 μl 25 mM Tris HCl pH 8.5, 50% (v/v) acetonitrile (lys C),
and was incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. This step was
repeated until no stain was visible. The plugs were then
washed twice in 100 μl 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate
(trypsin) or 100 μl 25 mM Tris HCl pH 8.5 (lys C), which was
then discarded. The plugs were then incubated with 50 μl of a
10 mM dithiothreitol stock solution. After 30 minutes at 37°C
the dithiothreitol was discarded and 50 μl of a 55 mM iodoacetamide stock solution was added to each tube and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The
iodoacetamide was discarded and the plugs washed twice as
above. The plugs were dehydrated in 100% acetonitrile. The
plug was rehydrated in 19 μl of 25 mM Tris/HCl, 1 mM EDTA,
pH 8.5 (lys C), or 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (trypsin).
Sequencing grade endoproteinase lys-C or trypsin (1 μl, 0.1
μg/μl, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was added and the digest
was incubated overnight at 37°C. The reaction was stopped
with 1 μl formic acid.

Additional data files
Peptide mass fingerprinting
The peptides were analyzed on a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometer (MALDITOF/MS) (Micromass) operated in reflectron mode with positive ion detection. External mass calibration was determined
using a mixture of des-Arg bradykinin, neurotenin, ACTH,
and insulin b chain (50 mM each in 50% acetonittrile, 0.1%
trifluroactic acid). Samples were mixed 1:1 (v/v) with a saturated solution of α cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetonitrile:water:trifluroacetic acid (50:49:1, v/v/v). Peptide
mass fingerprints were searched against the MSDB database
(release 20063108) using the MASCOT search engine [76].
Peptide mass fingerprint search parameters were set to tolerate a maximum of one missed enzyme cleavage with carbamidomethyl cysteine as a fixed modification and methionine
