Abstract
Background: Sequence related families of genes and proteins are common in bacterial genomes.
In Escherichia coli they constitute over half of the genome. The presence of families and
superfamilies of proteins suggest a history of gene duplication and divergence during evolution.
Genome encoded protein families, their size and functional composition, reflect metabolic
potentials of the organisms they are found in. Comparing protein families of different organisms
give insight into functional differences and similarities.
Results: Equivalent enzyme families with metabolic functions were selected from the genomes of
four experimentally characterized bacteria belonging to separate genera. Both similarities and
differences were detected in the protein family memberships, with more similarities being detected
among the more closely related organisms. Protein family memberships reflected known metabolic
characteristics of the organisms. Differences in divergence of functionally characterized enzyme
family members accounted for characteristics of taxa known to differ in those biochemical
properties and capabilities. While some members of the gene families will have been acquired by
lateral exchange and other former family members will have been lost over time, duplication and
divergence of genes and functions appear to have been a significant contributor to the functional
diversity of today’s microbes.
Conclusions: Protein families seem likely to have arisen during evolution by gene duplication and
divergence where the gene copies that have been retained are the variants that have led to distinct
bacterial physiologies and taxa. Thus divergence of the duplicate enzymes has been a major process
in the generation of different kinds of bacteria.

Background
When Charles Darwin wrote The Origin of Species, no data
existed that could inform him of the molecular nature of
genetic variation that fuels evolutionary change. Today
the existence of sequences of entire genomes and the ability to compare related sequences allows identification and
characterization of sources of genetic variation. Evolution
at the molecular level is now known to have taken place
through both selection and neutral drift acting on genetic
variation arising from many avenues: single base changes,
horizontal transfer of genes, loss of genes, rearrangements
of genomic segments and, discussed here, gene duplication followed by divergence of the copies. The comparative analysis of sequences of related and unrelated bacteria
has filled out our understanding of some of these mechanisms of evolution.
Views of the nature of genetic change underlying evolution have changed over the last century. Koonin has summarized the history of these changes up to the present
view [1]. In the beginning, Darwin thought that genetic
changes were small and evolution was gradual. This view
was maintained as plausible after the structure of DNA
became known. Successive single nucleotide changes by
point mutation would be small, conforming to the view
of the gradual nature of the process. Evolutionary change
according to this gradualist view was brought about by
selection, that is the fixation of beneficial mutations,
elimination of the deleterious. Subsequently Kimura [2]
and others introduced the neutral theory, stating that
selectively neutral mutations dominate and fixation
occurs by random drift. At this time, the type of genetic
change was still viewed as gradual accumulation of point
mutations.
However in 1970, Ohno [3] introduced the idea of gene
duplication as an important form of genetic variation, a
process that would go beyond gradualism and would permit quantum changes. The process of gene duplication in
microbes as the agent of evolution of novel gene functions
is being studied by many scientific groups today e.g. [4-7].
Another source of sudden change was the discovery of
horizontal transfer of genes from one organism to another
not necessarily related organism [8]. Both these mechanisms, gene duplication and lateral transfer, have the
capacity to bring about relatively large changes.
With availability of complete genome sequences of many
bacteria, studies have used such data to understand the
power law behavior of sizes of paralogous groups of genes
in many bacterial species [4]. Others have used collections
of genomic sequence data to enumerate types of fates of
ancestral genes, concluding that there has been a great
deal of loss following duplication, that selection for novel
functions has played a prominent role and that rates of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/46

divergence of paralogous genes depends on selection pressure and functional constraints [6]. Gevers et al. [7] analyzed presence of sequence-related groups from a
functional standpoint. They found that in all the
genomes, largest families contained transport genes and
regulation genes, smaller families were involved in metabolism and energy production. They considered that duplicated genes were retained if adapted to a changing
environment.
As distinguished from such studies of sequence-related
families in large data sets like collections of whole
genome sequences, we planned to examine a few paralogous groups in a limited number of bacteria where the
great majority of the functions of the individual proteins
in each family is known. We wanted to see what kind of
impact expansion of a family by duplication and divergence has on the host cell. Different paths of divergence
would be expected to create the differences one sees in the
taxa today. As to what kinds of proteins to examine, we
chose to look at enzymes even though they form smaller
data sets than those for transport and regulation proteins.
Our goal was not to reconstruct evolutionary events over
time, but to look at the power of duplication to affect the
identity of the cell in specific biochemical terms. We ask
in qualitative terms if the content of a family of enzymes
bears a relationship to the biological characteristics of the
organisms in which they reside.
A companion study to this one from our laboratory, used
MrBayes methodology to develop unrooted trees of the
enzymes of this study [9]. These data show that the
enzyme trees do not correspond to trees of the organisms,
nor would we expect them to. Protein family trees are different from phylogenetic trees of organisms. The selection
factors that operate on enzymes such as availability and
concentration of cofactors, energy supply (e.g. ATP,
NADH), interactions within metabolic pathways,
response to regulatory chains, tolerance to inhibitors, to
ion concentrations, the breadth of substrate accommodation, and so on and so on, need not connect quantitatively
with the factors that affect phylogeny of the organism as a
whole.
There have been few studies confined to enzymes as factors in molecular evolution. Jensen in 1976 pointed out
the importance of "recruitment" of new enzymes in evolution by gene duplication followed by changes in the
specificity of the new copies so as to take on a related, but
new role [10]. Some relationships of enzymes within a
pathway could be understood in these terms. Another
mechanism is duplication and modification of one copy
by addition of another domain. An example of such a relationship is the pair of genes in Escherichia coli for the
ribose repressor (RbsR) and the periplasmic protein for

ribose transport (RbsB). These proteins share the
sequence spanning the periplasmic binding protein (PBP)
domain (PF00352) but differ in the acquisition of a DNAbinding domain by RbsR. An alignment of RbsR and RbsB
is shown in Figure 1. While both proteins have maintained their ability to bind ribose using the PBP domain,
RbsR has gained the ability to bind DNA and regulate
transcription while the RbsB has been modified to allow
for export to the periplasmic space and for interaction
with the membrane components of the ABC type transporter.
Different from the rbs story, there are families of sequence
similar enzymes that use the same reaction mechanisms
but vary in substrate specificity. An example is the family
of aminotransferases Class III. However, perhaps even
more interesting, there are other families of sequence-similar enzymes that catalyze related but different reactions.
Such mechanistically diverse collections are called superfamilies of enzymes. Several enzyme superfamilies, isolated from many biological sources, have been studied
carefully from a structural and biochemical point of view.
These include the enolase, Nudix, amidohydrolase, crotonase and haloacid dehalogenase superfamilies (reviewed
in [11]). We have focused on identifying the members of

a superfamily within one organism, a group of enzymes
that could have arisen by duplication and divergence. We
ask whether the members of the family are of a kind that
would contribute to the metabolic identity of the organism.
One such superfamily is the Short Chain DehydrogenaseReductase (SDR) family. Similarities among certain dehydrogenases from Streptomyces spp., Drosophila melanogaster
and several mammals, led to the identification of a type of
dehydrogenase given the name SDR [12]. All reactions
catalyzed by members of this superfamily require the
cofactor NAD(P)/H and all members possess the Rossman fold. As more and more members of this superfamily
were identified, the family was found also to include epimerases, dehydratases and isomerases [13]. It is variations
on a theme of reaction chemistry that ties members of the
superfamily together. This is different from earlier ideas
on evolution of enzymes where a single enzyme would
change by modifying substrate affinities, not by varying
the reaction.
In the context of evolution, one can ask what kinds of biochemical properties have been conferred on a single
organism by this process. To answer the question we

decided to gather the members of the SDR family in E.
coli, and then expand the study to other sequence-related
enzyme families, not only from E. coli but from other bacteria as well.

Results and Discussion
To find out how many members of the SDR family are
present in E. coli K-12 MG1655, henceforth E. coli, we
assembled enzymes identified with an EC number 1.1.1.x.
Among these are enzymes with the structural and
sequence characteristics of the SDR superfamily. Initially
we used the AllAllDb program of the Darwin system [14]
(after first separating independent, fused proteins into
their components) to collect all sequence related E. coli
enzymes from this group. Parameters of the initial pairwise similarity search were set as requiring a Pam value of
at least 200, an alignment of 83 residues and an involvement of at least 50% of the length of the smaller protein
of any sequence-similar pair. Related enzymes were
assembled by transitive relationship. To extend membership in the groups to include proteins whose sequence
may have diverged further, we submitted all members to
PSI-BLAST analysis [15].
E. coli has 15 members of the SDR family whose substrates
and reactions are known (Table 1). We found that the

entire superfamily could be subdivided based their
sequence similarity into two separate groups. One of these
groups contained all the dehydrogenase/reductases, the
other all the epimerase/dehydratases. Although the reactions of the second group are not oxidative the apparent
anomaly is explained by their reaction mechanisms. For
SDR enzymes, reactions of epimerization, dehydration or
isomerization are promoted with an oxidation-reduction
type of chemistry that promotes both loss and gain of a
proton so as to change the placement of the moieties of
the substrate or to promote dehydration. Both types of
reactions are facilitated by a Ser-Tyr-Lys catalytic triad
whose spatial configuration and charge distribution is
affected by the binding of each substrate [16].
Examination of the sequence alignments of the E. coli SDR
enzymes revealed four regions that aligned for all members of the extended family, the substrate binding site, the
NAD(P)/H-binding Rossman fold and two sites of
unknown function, likely to be important for folding (Fig.
2). Each of the conserved sequences occurs in approximately the same region within each protein. Small
changes in the residues in conserved regions have large
effects on the affinity for particular substrates and on the
specific reaction that is catalyzed.

Table 1 shows the separation into two types of crotonases
and the variety of pathways and resulting phenotypes
served by the SDR superfamily. Some pathways are used
by many organisms, such as fatty acid synthesis, but many
products and processes are characteristic of the enteric
organisms only, such as bile acid emulsification, biosynthesis of colanic acid, lipid A, enterobactin and enterobacterial common antigen. It appears that the process of
duplication and divergence has contributed to the metabolic characteristics of a unique phylogenetic group of
bacteria.
One can ask how broad the phenomenon of families is
among E. coli enzymes. Even before the sequence of the E.
coli genome was completed, the existence of families of
related sequence within its genome was observed [17,18].
Such sequence-related families are viewed as paralogous
families that arose by duplication of genes within the
genome of the organism itself or in that of an ancestor,
although as previously mentioned some members of
these families could have been introduced by lateral gene
transfer. After completion of the full genomic sequence of
E. coli [19], the complete set of paralogous families in relation to the whole genome could be determined. Pair-wise
related sequences from the entire genome were assembled, using the criteria of similarity as having Pam values
below 200 and alignments of at least 83 residues. By
requiring an alignment of 83 amino acids or more we seek
to avoid grouping sequences by small common domains
or motifs, such as DNA binding domains, instead we
detect protein level duplications. For example in the
RbsR/RbsD case, the 45 amino acid DNA-binding domain
(PF00356) is present in 14 additional E. coli transcriptional regulators. Since the main components of these
proteins, the ligand-binding domains, not are related to
RbsR we do not consider them paralogs. Our groups
ranged in size from 92 members in the largest group down
to the smallest size, simple pairs. Over half of the E. coli
proteins resided in these sequence-related groups [20-22].
The existence of families of sequence-similar proteins
making up a large fraction of the genomic content supports the proposal that duplication followed by divergence is an important mechanism of molecular evolution.
The largest groups in the E. coli genome were those of
related transport proteins, regulatory proteins, and redox
(i.e. iron-sulfur) subunits of enzyme complexes. Groups
of sequence similar enzymes were smaller, had fewer
members, than the groups of transporters and regulators.
However, we concentrated on the class of enzymes
because studying families of enzymes has the advantage
of being able to draw on the detailed knowledge in the
extensive biochemical literature concerning their properties, prosthetic groups, the mechanisms of the reactions
they catalyze and pathways they belong to. One is in a

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/46

position to link genetic information with biochemical
information and thus with phenotypes of the organism.
Examining the members of enzyme families of E. coli
allowed a view at the molecular level of what kind of creation of function occurred as a consequence of presumed
duplication and divergence.
Another superfamily that is structurally and mechanistically related but catalyzes diverse reactions is the crotonase family. The family was originally characterized by
similarities in three-dimensional structure of four
enzymes derived from different sources. Although structurally related, sequence related and mechanistically
related, their biochemistry showed that they catalyzed
four different reactions [23]. Subsequent investigation has
shown that the crotonase enzymes are related in
sequence, though often distantly, and catalyze a broad
range of reactions i.e. dehalogenation, hydration/dehydration, decarboxylation, formation/cleavage of carboncarbon bonds and hydrolysis of thioesters [24].
To look at crotonases in an evolutionary context, one can
ask if they could have arisen by duplication and divergence. To approach this question, one could enumerate
all crotonases in one organism. Starting with a crotonase
in E. coli, encoded in the N-terminal portion of FadB (here
designated FadB_1) with demonstrable structural similarity at the active site to the rat liver crotonase, we assembled the group of sequence-similar enzymes in E. coli as
before by the Darwin AllAllDb program. Figure 3 presents
the alignment of residues at the active site for the E.coli
crotonase family. The greatest amino acid conservation is
seen for the residues involved in acyl-CoA-binding and
the catalytic site. There is a CoA-binding site and an
expandable acyl-binding pocket as well as an oxyanion
hole for binding the thioester C = O bond, crucial to the
reaction catalyzed by members of this superfamily
[23,25]. Variations in residues at critical positions in the
active sites dictate which of the related reactions occurs.
Again, as for the SDR family, one can visualize that the
broad family of crotonases, spanning several kinds of
reactions, could have arisen by gene duplication and
divergence early in evolutionary time.
By assembling the crotonase family members in a few
organisms, one expects that some individual enzymes will
be present in all the organisms as they are virtually universal. However other members of the crotonase family are
expected to differ from one organism to another. We
expect that bacteria in separate lineages would have some
enzymes that catalyze different reactions. Differentiation
of bacteria as they evolved along different lineages is
expected to be partly as a consequence of generating different enzyme family members in the course of the divergence process. Other molecular evolution events are

occurring at the same time as the duplication and divergence, such as lateral transfers and gene loss. To focus on
gene duplication we decided to look at families of
enzymes in a set of both similar and distant bacteria.
We asked whether members of three enzyme families are
the same in the bacteria examined or whether there are
differences dictated by separate evolutionary histories and
separate selective pressures. Three enzyme families were
compared in four bacteria. The families chosen for comparison were the crotonases, pyridoxal phosphate-requiring aminotransferases Class III, and thiamin diphosphaterequiring decarboxylases. The four bacteria are E. coli, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2
(henceforth S. enterica), the distant γ-proteobacterium
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and the gram positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis strain 168 (henceforth "B. subtilis).
The families of enzymes were assembled for the three
organisms using the same methods as for E. coli. Table 2,
3, and 4 list members of the aminotransferase-, decarboxylase-, and crotonase superfamilies, respectively. Known
enzymes and strongly predicted enzymes present in each
of the four bacteria are shown as well as the number of
proteins currently of unknown function.

We note that some of the enzymes are present in all four
bacteria, suggesting they are integral parts of core metabolic functions. This is supported by the pathways they
participate in; biotin synthesis and porphyrin synthesis
(BioA and HemL), aminobutyrate utilization (GabT),
pyruvate oxidation (PoxB/YdaP), and fatty acid oxidation
(FadB). One supposes such commonly held important
functions are conserved in many bacteria in many taxa.
Other enzymes differ in their distribution (presence or
absence) among the four organisms. This is presumably a
result of different evolutionary histories in different lineages during the divergence processes, leading to establishment of bacterial taxa with biochemical and metabolic
differences. For example the MenD decarboxylase and
MenB crotonase used for menaquinone biosynthesis are
absent from P. aeruginosa and present in the other three
organisms. This distribution is reflective of the Pseudomonads using only ubiquinone, and not both ubiquinone and menaquinone, as electron carriers for
respiration. Gcl, tartronate-semialdehyde synthase of glyoxalate utilization, is present in three bacteria, and not in
B. subtilis. Degradation of glyxolate in B. subtilis has been
shown to occur by a different pathway from the other
three organisms. In the two enteric organisms, their particular paths of metabolizing putrescine and carnitine are

used to degrade arginine by a different pathway. We
observe that the two more closely related enteric organisms have a higher similarity in their aminotransferase
content.
Some of the protein family members represent isozymes,
sequence similar enzymes that catalyze the same reaction
but with definable differences such as substrate breadth,
feedback inhibition, binding constants, reaction rates and
the like. Based on the common nature of the isozymes, we
suppose they have arisen by gene duplication and slight
divergence. Examples of isozymes are the trio of acetolactate synthases; IlvB, IlvI and IlvG, found in E. coli and S.
enterica. These isozymes function in the isoleucine and
valine biosynthesis pathway, each responding to distinct
feed back. One copy, IlvG, is mutated and inactive in E.
coli, rendering E. coli valine sensitive. This phenotype is
used in identification protocols to distinguish E. coli and
S. enterica. A second type of acetolactate synthase (AlsS) is
also present in B. subtilis, but this enzyme is used exclusively for catabolism and not synthesis of isoleucine and
valine.
E. coli and S. enterica have another set of isozymes, FadB
and FadJ. Both enzymes are used for fatty acid oxidation,
but FadB is used under aerobic conditions and FadJ is
used under anaerobic conditions. Other isozymes are
GabT and PuuE in E. coli, GsaB and HemL in B. subtilis.
Isozymes are often specific to pathways, such as PuuE,
which is specific to putrescine utilization. One supposes
that simply by small changes in duplicate genes, pathway
content and biochemical capability of an organism can
expand.
In addition there are protein family members that are
unique to only one of the four organisms and absent in
the other three. These enzymes often confer metabolic
properties unique to their host. An example is oxalyl-CoA
decarboxylase (Oxc) that is present E. coli where it is
believed to confer oxalate degrading capabilities. As is the
case for any of the enzymes present in one organism, not
the others, the gene could have been acquired by lateral
transmission [26]. However when an enzyme like oxalylCoA decarboxylase, is found in many bacteria, it is at least
as possible that it arose by gene duplication and divergence. Other organism specific enzymes, in this case B.
subtilis, include the IolD for myo-inositol degradation and
the crotonases PksH and PksI used for polyketide synthesis. Polyketides are a group of secondary products peculiar
to the Bacilli. Other unique B. subtilis enzymes AlsS, GsaB
and RocD have been mentioned above. It seems evident
that formation of different enzymes by unique divergence
events, add up to creation of taxa with different metabolic
characteristics.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/46

P. aeruginosa has the largest number of unique, or organism specific, enzymes in our dataset. This is shown for all
three enzyme families (Tables 2, 3, 4). These Pseudomonas
specific enzymes include synthesis of the siderophore
pyoverdine (PvdH), and utilization of mandelate (MdlC),
leucine and isovalerate (LiuC) and acyclic terpenes
(AtuE). Other predicted family members include two aminotransferases: PA5313, evidently an isozyme for 4-aminobutyrate, and OapT, likely a beta-alanine:pyruvate
enzyme. Each of these enzymes contributes to the distinct
metabolic character of P. aeruginosa as a pseudomonad. In
addition there are 5 aminotransferases, 5 decraboxylases
and 14 crotonases whose functions remain unknown in P.
aeruginosa. Our phylogenetic analysis [9] suggests that
these are unique enzymes representing additional functions yet to be discovered. Combining genes of known
and unknown function for the three families, the number
of unique P. aeruginosa genes (33) far surpasses that of B.
subtilis (12), E. coli (2) and S. enterica (1). The large
number of Pseudomonas specific enzymes detected is in
agreement with the well-documented metabolic versatility of this group [27,28].
These examples of differences among enzyme families in
four organisms suggest that the distinct events of divergence in genes of protein families over time have generated taxa of bacteria that are distinguished in part by their
metabolic differences. Bacteria that are closely related
have fewer differences in these families. For all three
enzyme families we noted that the two most closely
related organisms, E. coli and S. enterica, contain the most
similar complement of enzymes. Larger differences in
both number of dissimilar enzymes and enzyme functions were seen when comparing either B. subtilis or P. aeruginosa to any of the other three.
Overall, our protein family analysis includes several
examples of how the functional and metabolic diversity of
today's organisms is reflected in a history of duplicated
and diverged gene copies in their genome sequences. In
some instances the gene copies are the same in all the bacteria. These are enzymes for universal functions. Some of
the gene copies did not undergo much divergence and
resulted in isozymes catalyzing the same reactions but
with different properties. Such enzymes usually contribute to phenotypic differences, for instance by changes in
substrate specificity or regulation. Still other gene copies
were not found in other bacteria. These were functions
characteristic of the phenotype of the particular organism.
We do not suggest that duplication of genes was the only
source of diversity in these organisms. In addition there
lateral transfer could have introduced a new function and
also gene losses would have changed the composition of
protein families. Some analyses suggest that lateral gene

Page 10 of 17

Biology Direct 2009, 4:46

transfer has played a large role in assembling gene families
[29]. However one needs to take into account the lack of
congruence between organism trees and gene trees, the
latter being affected by different selective pressures on
individual enzymes (such as gene family composition,
cofactor/substrate availablility) compared to those affecting the organism as a whole. Lawrence and Hendrickson
[30] have discussed in a thoughtful way the difficulties in
distinguishing horizontal transmission from duplication
of existing genes. We have therefore not attempted to
identify laterally transferred genes in our enzyme families.
While possibly there we do not expect them to predominate. In summary, it is a combination of all these genetic
changes (duplications, divergence, loss and acquisitions)
in ancestors of contemporary organisms that has generated the characteristic phenotypes of today's organisms.

Conclusion
By assembling selected superfamilies of enzymes of
sequence and structural similarity in four different bacteria whose entire genomes have been sequenced, we suggest that members of the families arose in the course of
evolution at least in large part, by duplication followed by
divergence. We observed that differences in the enzyme
families, both in functions and numbers of homologs,
were greater as the organisms were less closely related.
Functional differences of family members were reflective
of metabolic diversity of the host genome. Events such as
gene loss and gain also must have made changes to
enzyme family rosters over time, but we suggest that the
outline of the duplication and divergence process remains
visible in the contemporary paralogous groups of
sequence-related superfamilies.
The future
The examples here of enzyme families that could have
arisen by duplication and divergence are only representative of a large number of such sets of sequence related proteins in all organisms. Continuing to assemble and
analyze such families will undoubtedly bring more understanding to the mechanisms of their origins and the relationships of enzymes and pathways to the life style of each
organism. Including proteins other than enzymes will
paint a more detailed and well-rounded picture of the
span and significance of gene duplication as a mechanism
of molecular evolution.

All other avenues of molecular evolution in terms of protein sequences will continue to be pursued using the grist
provided by the ever-increasing collection of complete
genome sequences. A different avenue of phenotypic
change that goes beyond presence and absence of protein
sequences is the immense arena of epigenetics. The complexities of many systems in regulation of gene expression
have the potential of bringing about evolutionary changes
that would not be visible in the sequences of the proteins

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/46

being regulated. Small genetic changes, in small regulatory RNAs, for instance, affecting complex multi-gene regulatory systems may give rise to far-reaching phenotypic
changes [31-34]. It seems likely that future research on
physiological functions affected by epigenetic differences
will bring new insights into the processes of evolution.
Incorporating data in a systems approach will be a way to
include regulation as an important factor affecting molecular evolution [31].

Methods
Pairwise sequence alignments and scores were generated
using the AllAllDb program of Darwin (Data Analysis and
Retrieval With Indexed Nucleotide/peptide sequence
package), version 2.0, developed at the ETHZ in Zurich
[14]. Maximum likelihood alignments are generated with
an initial global alignment by dynamic programming followed by dynamic local alignments. A single scoring
matrix is used for these steps. After the initial alignment,
the scoring matrix is adjusted to fit the approximate distance between each protein pair to produce the minimum
Pam value. Pam units are defined as the numbers of point
mutations per 100 residues [35,36].

Sequence pairs were collected that had alignment lengths
of at least 83 amino acids, distances of 200 Pam units or
less, and aligned over at least 50% of the length of the
query sequence. Multimodular proteins were identified
and separated into modules of independent functions. We

chose the length requirement of 83 residues as it improves
the significance of the sequence alignments for the more
distantly related protein pairs [37,38]. The requirement
for at least 83 residues also avoids a class of commonly
occurring protein domains smaller than 83 residues that
appear widely in many otherwise unrelated proteins (such
as small binding sites for a type of substrate or cofactor or
regulator).

Authors' contributions

To extend to a lower level of similarity, the PSI-BLAST program [38] was used to collect successively sets of related
proteins. SEG filtering was used and the search limited to
no more than 5 rounds. This allows for more divergent set
of sequences to be grouped. Proteins were removed from
a result if they had poor matches to only one or two group
members. Families were formed by transitive clustering.

Pierre Pontarotti

Sequence alignments were generated with the ClustalW
program [39].
For the proteins having weak sequence similarities, validity of including these proteins in a family was established
using structural features. We undertook to thread
sequences of weakly similar proteins sequences on the
structure of a representative bacterial protein template. To
choose a template representing each of the three functional groups, the whole-protein sequence of the most
closely related bacterial members of each group were used
as queries to search the PDB database [40] using the blastp
program of the BLAST package [41].
The closest structural neighbor (template) in bacteria was
chosen based on the highest similarity scores. The selected
templates were structures of the rat crotonase (PDB ID:
2DUB), Pseudomonas fragi FadB (PDB ID: 1WDM), E. coli
BioA (PDB ID: 1DTY, Lactobacillus plantarum Pox (PDB ID:
1POW). Structural models were generated using the
DeepView - Swiss-PdbViewer application (version 3.7)
and the MagicFit tool [42]. Pairwise alignments between
the primary amino acid sequence of each target and the
respective structural template were performed using
DeepView. To get the optimum structural alignment, the
Magic Fit and Iterative Magic Fit functions were used. This
super-imposition generated the structural coordinates for
the modeled proteins.

Reviewer comments
I carefully read your article with great interest. Unfortunately, I do not see any new information in your article.
Indeed, gene duplication related to functional evolution
has been highly described in the literature as well as the
link with physiology.

Maybe I miss something: if this is the case, I suggest that
you should better explain the originality of your work to
the reader and you also could provide a comparative
description with the already published articles.
Despite this comment, the analyze is straightforward and
carefully carried out.
Authors' response
We appreciate your prompt reading of our paper. We can
see that we have not done a good job of explaining how
our study differs from others. Many studies of gene duplication gather total data on sizes of paralogous families in
organisms, analyze numbers and rates of mutation etc., as
a mathematical model, but do not bring into the picture
the difference in functions developed by some of the
duplications. We have purposely undertaken to examine
closely just a few paralogous families where in most cases
the enzymes made by the genes in the families are known.
This allows us to see what functions are in common in the
chosen microorganisms and what functions have arisen
presumably by mutation that are specific to one organism
or to closely related organisms, but not to others. In other
words, since we know what these gene products do, what
pathways they participate in, we can learn something
about how organisms became differentiated and unique
from one another in biochemical terms.

We will be making this point much more clearly in the
manuscript now, thanks to your comments. If you know
of other studies along these lines that we should be aware
of, it would be a kindness to direct us to them.

Reviewer's comments
"These proteins share many sequence similarities except
that the repressor has a DNA-binding sequence at the Nterminal end, but the transport protein does not."

-This sentence should be modified to simply reflect the
fact that the proteins share a PBP domain and that the
transcription regulator has acquired a DNA-binding
domain.
"Pair-wise related sequences from the entire genome were
assembled, using the criteria of similarity as having Pam
values below 200 and alignments of at least 83 residues.
The groups ranged in size from 92 members in the largest
group down to the smallest size, simple pairs."
-This is an underestimate of the actual paralogy situation
in the genome. A disclaimer to this effect would be appropriate, indicating that the above method provides an
approximate estimate of the cluster sizes of paralogs in the
proteome. It might also be proper to differentiate between
the paralogy of domains and whole proteins like the
RbsR/RbsB example discussed above.
"...(CaiD) in both E. coli and Typhimurium."
-Better to spell out the whole name Salmonella typhimurium and thereafter use S.typhimurium
"P. aeruginosa has a large number of such single organism
occurring enzymes"
-The sentence is highly agglutinative, could modified to
express the point better. Secondly a more quantitative estimate of the "large number" would be useful. A comparison relative another organism could also be of value.
"...we suggest that members of the families arose in the
course of evolution at least in large part, by duplication
followed by divergence."
-This statement is entirely true, but it seems to be a bit of
a platitude in this context because the introduction itself
starts of stating the role of duplication in diversification of
protein families. Certainly the protein families have
emerged through this process. But what does the "large
part" mean? Does it imply that a part of the family did not
arise by this process? Or are the authors trying to say

within a genome in large part the process was one of
duplication/divergence but a smaller fraction could be lateral transfer.
-This leads to a more general issue regarding the current
article. The conclusions would possibly benefit from a
more explicit delineation of the relative contributions of
lateral gene transfer and lineage-specific expansions of
genes (i.e. duplications) in the evolution of families considered here. In terms of physiological adaptation there is
ample evidence from hyperthermophiles and photosynthetic organisms that gene transfer between phylogenetically distant lineages is a major contributor to the paralog
complement of these organisms and their proteomes in
general. This raises the possibility that in the adaptive
transition to new niches the acquisition of genes by lateral
transfer is a big player.
-Regarding the final discussion on epigenetics: It is known
that proteins mediating epigenetic controls are very variably distributed across the bacterial phylogenetic tree. So is
it correct to generalize a major role for epigenetics? Probably not -- it might provide some fine-tuning mechanisms
but is unlikely to make a fundamental physiological difference for after the more fundamental determinants are
directly inferred from the proteome.
Authors' response
Thank you for helping us improve our manuscript with
your many insightful comments and helpful suggestions.
We have adopted or addressed these as follows.

The sequence relationships of RbsR/RbsB has been
explained as similarity and differences in domain content.
We have explained that the sequence similar groups we
generate not are based on similarity of smaller domains or
motifs, but rather require larger fractions of the proteins to
be aligned, in an attempt to simulate gene duplication. As
a result our estimates of paralogy may be considered conservative.
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2 is now referred to as S. enterica rather than S. typhimurium so as to conform to current correct nomenclature.
We have clarified our statement about the large number of
single organism occurring enzymes in P. aeruginosa and
have included specific numbers and comparisons
between the organisms analyzed.
On the influence of duplication and divergence versus lateral transfer as well as gene loss on the current protein
family compositions, we have opted not to quantify these
sources. We feel that our dataset is too small both in the
number of enzymes and organisms compared to make

Biology Direct 2009, 4:46

such calculations. When selecting our dataset we sought
to use experimentally characterized model organisms and
families where the members had known metabolic functions. We have modified the discussion section to further
state how gene loss and lateral gene transfer influence
today's family compositions, but that based on the difficulty in distinguishing horizontally transferred genes
from gene duplications and divergence (Lawrence and
Hendrickson reference) we opted not to make such estimations for our dataset.
The section on epigenetics has been slightly modified.
While the role of epigenetics may not be the major force
affecting evolution of protein families and phenotypes of
organisms, we do believe it represents an area of potential
new insights into how functional diversity arises and is
maintained in organisms.

"In Escherichia coli they constitute over half of the
genome." - the total length of these genes is indeed likely
to be over half of the genome length; but for this statement to be accurate, the length of the non-coding regions
needs to be added to the denominator - has this been
done? In fact, I suspect that the authors meant "over half
of all proteins encoded by the genome"
"Equivalent families from different genera of bacteria are
compared." - what does "equivalent" mean - homologous, of same size, or something else?
"They show both similarities and differences to each
other." - consider deleting?
"At least some members of gene families will have been
acquired by lateral exchange and other former family
members will have been lost over time." - is it "will have
been", i.e., expected of the data, or "have been", i.e.,
shown in this work?

Reviewer's comments
The manuscript deals with the fates of duplicated genes in
bacterial genomes, focusing on the selected families of the
enzymes with related, diverged functions and their
sequence homologs. In the last 15 years, there has been a
considerable amount of work on the subject, relating to
each other such factors as rate of duplication, rate of
duplicate retention, rate of sequence divergence between
duplicates, subfunctionalization, speciation, etc. Many of
the relevant papers from this corpus of work are cited in
this manuscript. The manuscript would benefit from
engaging with these cited papers in a constructive way,
i.e., by trying to apply some of the quantitative estimates
obtained by other workers to the cases that are studied
here.

More specifically, I would like to see much more definitive
statements about the timing of gene duplication within
the selected three families vs. splits of the lineages that the
authors study. Polytomies or lack of support for deep
nodes in the tree may be a real problem in the subset of
cases, but the analysis should be attempted anyway, and
specific cases when the results lack support should be
noted.
Abstract
"Sequence related families of genes and proteins" is perhaps a tautology - "families" already means "sequencerelated", does it not?

"These families seem likely to have arisen during evolution by duplication and divergence where those that were
retained are the variants that have led to distinct bacterial
physiologies and taxa." - hard to argue with this, and yet:
what would the alternative explanation be - purely stochastic expansion and shrinkage of the families?
Background
Par. 1 "Darwin formulated the Origin of Species" - either
formulated the theory of Origin of Species, or written The
Origin of Species perhaps?

Par. 3, last line: "Stepwise" means "relatively large" in context, but perhaps it should be made more explicit (otherwise, may be interpreted as "step by step", i.e., gradual).
Par. 4: the example of recruitment that the authors discuss
is apparently recruitment by addition of novel domain.
This is one mechanism of acquiring new function, but I
am not sure that this is what R. Jensen meant; as far as I
know, his thoughts were more along the lines of sequence
drift and polyfunctionality.
Par. 5: "Some attempts to quantify the importance of horizontal, or lateral, transmission in the bacterial genome
conclude that foreign gene uptake rather than gene duplication has been a large player in assembling a genome
[29]." - I do not think that the study by Lerat et al. is an
either/or proposition. They show that a large absolute
number of detected gene transfers can coexist with the low
frequency of such transfers in most gene families, which is
in my opinion a profound result. They do not argue that
gene duplication is less important than horizontal transfer, nor I think have their results been disproved. I agree

Biology Direct 2009, 4:46

with the authors' approach expressed in the rest of this
paragraph, so I think an attempt to argue against the role
of HGT is a red herring.
Last paragraph in the Introduction: "In the context of evolution, one might ask whether the genes for this expansive
superfamily in one organism (not from many organisms)
bear similarity to one another in their sequences." The
authors already asserted that SDR is a superfamily - or is it
a family, as both terms are used seemingly interchangeably in this paragraph? On what basis has this been established? Most likely, it was sequence similarity (I have no
evidence that structures were matched directly, and
indeed similarity comparison is what the first paragraph
of the Results also suggests), in which case why this needs
to be investigated again, or what are perhaps more specific
questions that need to be addressed?
Results and Discussion
par. 4 - consider deleting?

par. 5 "The groups ranged in size from 92 members in the
largest group" - please mention that this is from one study
with a conservative similarity threshold; the current count
for Walker-box ATPases/GTPases seems to be more than
120 members...
par. 7 "sequence and mechanistically related" - replace
with "related by sequence and showing similar molecular
mechanism"?
par. 8. Is it important to the authors to make sure that they
know all members of each family in E.coli? If the answer
is yes, is the AllAllDb comparison sufficient, or perhaps
better to build an HMM or a PSIBLAST profile of the
already known members and scan the proteome again? If
the answer is no, why not?
par. 9: "Some of the SDR enzymes and some of the crotonases are almost universally present in organisms in all
three domains of life. Thus one pictures the generation of
these enzymes as happening early in evolutionary time,
distributed vertically to most organisms." - one may wish
to build a phylogenetic tree of the family and compare it
with the tree of species to see whether there is any direct
evidence for or against horizontal transfer - why not?
Ibid. "Some family members will be virtually universal,
but others will differ from one organism or taxa to
another, contributing to differences in phenotypes in separate lineages." - is this a statement of the fact or a prediction?
par. 10: "members of three enzyme families are the same
in other bacteria" - what does 'the same' mean here?

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/46

par. 12: "One supposes such commonly held important
functions could have arisen by duplication and divergence early in evolutionary time." - why one has to suppose it - can this again be evaluated by comparing species
tree and gene tree?
the next paragraphs: interesting differences are discussed,
but no specific evolutionary scenarios are proposed viz.
the timing of the events. Can one distinguish between 1.
the presence of an enzyme in the common ancestor of the
lineages under study (ie., more or less in the common bacterial ancestor) with secondary loss in some of the lineages and 2. emergence of a specific family member by
duplication in some but not all of the lineages? When a
horizontal transfer event is suspected (e.g. "As is the case
for any of the enzymes present in one organism, not the
others, the gene could have been acquired by lateral transmission [26]. However when the enzyme is one of a family of similar enzymes, it is at least as possible that it arose
by gene duplication and divergence."), why not attempt
to sort out what was actually going on?
Authors' response
Thank you for having taken the time to look carefully at
the manuscript. In response to your comments, we have
done a major rewrite, during which we incorporated all
suggestions about language and expression. We have
expanded explanations and have tried to make much
clearer the basic thrust of the paper.

In the first part of your review you suggest we do quantitative analysis to sort out when duplication occurred,
when divergence occurred, plus when gain of genes by lateral transfer and loss of genes occurred. Our data set is
much too small to undertake this type of analysis. We
have expanded discussion to include this explanation in
the revised manuscript.
You ask what alternatives there are to the process of duplication and divergence. We agree that alternatives are stochastic changes, or perhaps horizontal transfer. But
mainly we are saying that one mechanism, perhaps the
most important force, in creating the different kinds of
bacteria today was duplication and divergence.
We have considered the issue of how we could try to quantify the importance of Lateral Gene Transfer in the four
enzyme families we deal with, but we see no obvious outliers in our family groups. Members of these families do
not deviate from properties of other members, thus if they
came from another host source, time has brought about
"amelioration", therefore they are not clearly identifiable
as horizontally acquired. We agree that the issue is a "red
herring" and have minimized discussion of it in our
rewrite.

We have clarified that the definition of the SDR family
was originally based on similarity of structure of the
regions of substrate binding, cofactor binding and reaction site. Sequence similarity followed soon. The referenced papers give this history.
To our knowledge we are alone in having gathered all
members of this family and the others in this paper from
a single organism, as detected by the methods we describe,
Darwin AllAll algorithm and PSI-Blast. These have been
known already as paralogous groups. We are emphasizing
their likely formation by duplication and divergence.

It is not surprising to find that there are more Walker
ATPase/GTPase motifs than there are ATP-binding subunits of transporters because this motif appears in some
other proteins such as helicases.
Reviewer suggests we might build phylogenetic trees of
these families. This has been done in a prior report from
our laboratory, which we referenced. In our extensive revision we give our reasons for not expecting gene trees for
enzymes to be the same as RNA trees representing species.
As to the last comment by the referee, the goal of determining the history of each family of enzymes that led to
the distribution and characterization seen today. We have
explained in the revision that we have too small a data set
to do retrospective analysis, building trees of how the
enzymes were generated in each bacterium. Trees of these
enzyme families as of today have been presented in a previous publication. We are not able to determine with our
data set when specific losses occurred, or whether any of
the genes were acquired by LGT. In our revision we have
tried to explain much more clearly that this is a qualitative, not quantitative study. What we observe is perhaps
no more than common sense, but we show how differences in the members of an enzyme family (divergence)
are the kinds of differences that make each bacterial genus
unique. Divergence of duplicate enzymes generated differences we now use to characterize bacterial genera.
