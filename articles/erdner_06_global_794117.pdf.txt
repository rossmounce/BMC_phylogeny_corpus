Abstract
Background: Dinoflagellates are one of the most important classes of marine and freshwater
algae, notable both for their functional diversity and ecological significance. They occur naturally as
free-living cells, as endosymbionts of marine invertebrates and are well known for their
involvement in "red tides". Dinoflagellates are also notable for their unusual genome content and
structure, which suggests that the organization and regulation of dinoflagellate genes may be very
different from that of most eukaryotes. To investigate the content and regulation of the
dinoflagellate genome, we performed a global analysis of the transcriptome of the toxic
dinoflagellate Alexandrium fundyense under nitrate- and phosphate-limited conditions using
Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS).
Results: Data from the two MPSS libraries showed that the number of unique signatures found in
A. fundyense cells is similar to that of humans and Arabidopsis thaliana, two eukaryotes that have been
extensively analyzed using this method. The general distribution, abundance and expression
patterns of the A. fundyense signatures were also quite similar to other eukaryotes, and at least 10%
of the A. fundyense signatures were differentially expressed between the two conditions. RACE
amplification and sequencing of a subset of signatures showed that multiple signatures arose from
sequence variants of a single gene. Single signatures also mapped to different sequence variants of
the same gene.
Conclusion: The MPSS data presented here provide a quantitative view of the transcriptome and
its regulation in these unusual single-celled eukaryotes. The observed signature abundance and
distribution in Alexandrium is similar to that of other eukaryotes that have been analyzed using
MPSS. Results of signature mapping via RACE indicate that many signatures result from sequence
variants of individual genes. These data add to the growing body of evidence for widespread gene
duplication in dinoflagellates, which would contribute to the transcriptional complexity of these
organisms. The MPSS data also demonstrate that a significant number of dinoflagellate mRNAs are
transcriptionally regulated, indicating that dinoflagellates commonly employ transcriptional gene
regulation along with the post-transcriptional regulation that has been well documented in these
organisms.

Background
Dinoflagellates are a group of single celled algae that compose a highly diversified phylum that displays an amazing
range of ecological adaptation. Different species employ
autotrophy, heterotrophy or mixotrophy, many are
known to be symbiotic or parasitic, and bioluminescence
is common. They are found at all latitudes and are often a
significant component of marine and freshwater phytoplankton communities. Dinoflagellates are also notable
for their unusual genome content and organization
(reviewed in [1,2]). Estimates of dinoflagellate DNA content range from 3 to 250 pg·cell-1 [3,4], corresponding to
approximately 3000–215,000 Mb (in comparison, the
haploid human genome is 3180 Mb and hexaploid Triticum wheat is 16,000 Mb). It has been suggested that polyploidy or polyteny may account for this large cellular
DNA content [5], but studies of DNA reassociation kinetics do not support this hypothesis. Dinoflagellates have
many chromosomes (up to 325) that are permanently
condensed and attached to the nuclear envelope during
cell division [6]. Dinoflagellates are the only eukaryotes
with DNA that contains 5-hydroxymethylmuracil, which
replaces 12–70% of the thymidine [7].
The unique physical features of the dinoflagellate chromosomes are likely to affect both gene transcription and
regulation. While there is an increasing amount of
expressed sequence tag information available for dinoflagellates, very few genes have been well characterized
with respect to their gene structure and regulation. The
few nuclear genes that have been isolated from genomic
DNA seem to uniformly lack typical eukaryotic transcriptional elements (e.g. TATA boxes) and polyadenylation
sites [8-10]. Studies of dinoflagellate gene expression indicate that these organisms employ both transcriptional
(e.g. pcp [11]; Sahh, Map and Haf [12] and post-transcriptional (e.g. lbp [13]; GAPDH [14]) regulation, with the
iron superoxide dismutase of Lingulodinium polyedrum
exhibiting both modes, depending upon the stimulus
[15]. Recent results from microarray analysis of the dinoflagellate Pyrocystis lunula indicate that approximately 3%
of the transcripts included on the array exhibit transcriptional regulation [16,17].
Together, all of the above data suggests that the organization and regulation of dinoflagellate genes may be different from that of most other eukaryotes. Early microscopic
observations of the unusual dinoflagellate nuclear structure led to the hypothesis that dinoflagellates were "mesokaryotes", an intermediate between prokaryotic and
eukaryotic microorganisms [18]. However, molecular
phylogenetic evidence has since clearly identified them as
eukaryotes, and their phylogenetic placement supports
Loeblich's (1976) [19] evolutionary interpretation that
the unusual properties of dinoflagellate nuclei are derived

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/88

and not representative of a mesokaryotic ancestral state.
As such, our basic knowledge of eukaryotic genetics and
gene expression could only be increased by understanding
how (and why) dinoflagellates structure their genes and
regulate transcription within the sheer quantities of DNA
in their cells. To date, most of the data of gene regulation
mechanisms in dinoflagellates has emerged sporadically,
from studies of specific genes that are of interest for a particular function. The advent of genomic technologies, in
particular global gene expression profiling methods, provides the ability to learn about many genes or transcripts
simultaneously, even in uncharacterized systems like
dinoflagellates. The application of transcriptional profiling to dinoflagellates, in conjunction with laboratorybased gene characterization, holds tremendous potential
for understanding gene regulation in this unique and
understudied group. In addition, the availability of broadbased gene expression data has the potential to greatly
accelerate the pace of research and discovery for dinoflagellates, algae in general and eukaryotic systems as a whole.
This report describes a global and quantitative analysis of
the transcriptome of a dinoflagellate. As a model we have
used Alexandrium fundyense, a species that is capable of
producing potent neurotoxins, called saxitoxins, which
are the causative agent of paralytic shellfish poisoning.
The genus comprises approximately 30 different species
that are found worldwide, and 10 of which are known to
be toxic and cause so-called "red tides" or harmful algal
blooms. This study examined gene expression in nutrientstressed Alexandrium cells using Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS), a proprietary technology developed by Solexa, Inc [20]. The method is similar to the
well-known Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE)
[21] in that it acquires a short DNA sequence from a
defined position in each gene transcript. However, the
depth of sampling with MPSS is much greater, with the
resulting data set containing at least 1 million, 17-nucleotide 'signature' sequences, making the technology sensitive to genes expressed at low levels.
The MPSS method is "global" in that it provides quantitative expression information for the entire transcriptome.
For uncharacterized organisms like dinoflagellates, MPSS
can provide a broader view of the transcriptome than
microarray expression profiling, which generally includes
only a portion of the transcripts present in a cell. Statistical methods for the analysis of quantitative expression
data have demonstrated that the MPSS data are robust
[22]. Accepting an estimate of 300,000 mRNA molecules
in an average eukaryotic cell, MPSS constitutes a threefold sampling of a single cell, allowing the identification,
comparison and quantification of even rare transcripts.
The resulting Alexandrium MPSS data provide a quantitative assessment of the magnitude of transcriptional regu-

lation in dinoflagellates. Comparison of the Alexandrium
results to those of other eukaryotes indicates that the distribution and abundance of signature sequences is quite
similar in Alexandrium, humans and Arabidopsis. Finally,
identification of MPSS signatures via sequencing provides
insight into one mechanism that may contribute to the
observed signature number in Alexandrium.

reflected in their cellular toxin content (Figure 1C and
1D), which was decreasing in the N-starved culture (Figure 1C) and increasing in the P-starved culture (Figure
1D). This increment or decrement in toxin content under
P- or N-starved conditions, respectively, has been well
documented for this organism (e.g. [23]). At the time of
harvest, P-starved cells contained approximately ten times
more toxin than the N-starved cells.

Results
Physiological status of cells
Cells were harvested for analysis at the point at which
growth began to slow, at the transition between late logarithmic and stationary phases of growth (Figure 1A and
1B). At this time, the limiting nutrient had been depleted
for at least one day (Figure 1C and 1D), resulting in nutrient starvation. The nutrient status of the cells was also

performed for each sample, resulting in 2,259,219 successful sequences for the N/40 library and 1,501,972 successful sequences for the P/40 library (Table 1). From the

remove any signatures that were 1) not reliable: observed
in only one sequencing run, and 2) not significant: never
observed at or above 4 tpm in either library. Of the 55,472
unique signatures in the complete sequence set, 33%
(18,435 signatures) did not meet the reliability criterion.
The significance filter removed an additional 6119 signatures. After filtering, the final set of "reliable and significant" signatures comprised 27,217 signatures for N/40
and 20,161 signatures for P/40. For the purposes of this
analysis, we are concerned only with these reliable and
significant signatures and will hereafter refer to them simply as "signatures", reserving the term significant to refer
to the statistical analysis of differences in gene expression.
When the data from the two libraries was combined, a
total of 30,917 non-redundant signatures were observed.
Of these, 10,756 were not observed in the P/40 library
and 3,700 were not present in the N/40 library.

of all signatures – 8 signatures in the N/40 library and 12
signatures in the P/40 library – were present at greater
than 10,000 tpm (i.e. ≥1% of all sequences). The three
most abundant signatures in both libraries constituted
8.9%, 6.2% and 5.6% of total sequences (20.7% combined); all other high abundance signatures were less than
2.5% of sequences. Of the signatures present in a given
library, the vast majority, 93% of P/40 and 95% of N/40,
were found at less than 0.01% abundance (less than 100
tpm). Of the total signatures, 12% of them were not found
in the N/40 library, whereas almost 3 times as many
(34.8%) were absent from the P/40 library.
Differential expression of MPSS signatures
For those signatures which were present in both libraries,
their relative abundance between the two conditions – the
expression ratio – varied widely, from 1 to greater than 50
(Figure 3). Almost half of all signatures (46.8%) were condition-specific, in that they were found only in one library
and absent from the other (expression ratio = 0). Another
33.8% of signatures were constantly expressed, defined by
Meyers et al. (2004) [24] as those signatures with a
summed abundance within a two-fold range (expression
ratio <2). Only 19.4% of all signatures (6021 signatures)
were found in both libraries and showed a two-fold or
greater difference in expression. Of these, 15.5% had
expression ratios between 2 and 5, and only a small percentage of signatures, 4%, showed more than a five-fold
difference in expression level between the two libraries.

Signature abundances
Signature abundance distributions. The abundance of
each signature is given as a percentage of total signatures in
the N/40 (grey bars) and P/40 (black bars) libraries. For
example, 1% abundance indicates a signature that is present
10,000 times in each 1,000,000 sequences (10,000 tpm).

Signature abundance was also compared statistically
between the two libraries using a Z-test [25], with the
resulting statistical significance expressed as a p-value. The
expression of 11,037 signatures was significantly different
at p < 0.05. Of those 11,037 signatures, approximately
half (5978) remained significant at p < 0.01, and at p <
0.001 only 3056 signatures showed statistically significant
differences in expression (Table 2, Figure 4). Despite having statistical support, approximately 6% of the signatures
with significant differences in expression would nonetheless be considered constantly expressed, exhibiting expression ratios < 2 (Table 2, Figure 4). The majority of
differentially expressed signatures (ratio ≥2) are those that
are condition-specific, i.e. their expression is zero in one
of the libraries. About 30% of these signatures at each significance level are common to both libraries.

Comparison of expression for all of the A. fundyense

that signatures that are more highly expressed in the P/40
library are to the left (P:N) whereas those with greater
expression in the N/40 library are to the right (N:P). The
exceptions are signatures with ratio = 1, these are repeated
on the two sides of the figure, and those with ratio = 0.

RACE amplification using MPSS signatures
We synthesized oligonucleotide primers matching 45 of
the MPSS signatures, in order to generate longer fragments
via PCR for sequencing and potential transcript identification. This strategy is similar to that described as RAST-PCR
using SAGE tags [26], and as GLGI-MPSS using MPSS tags
[27], and also to the widely used rapid amplification of
cDNA ends (3' RACE). For RACE amplification, we chose
5 types of signatures: the most highly expressed signatures
found only in the N/40 library (tpmP = 0), the most highly
expressed signatures found only in the P/40 library (tpmN
= 0), signatures with the greatest relative expression in the
N/40 library (tpmN>>tpmP), signatures with the greatest
relative expression in the P/40 library (tpmP>>tpmN), and
signatures that were very highly expressed in both librar-

Two separate rounds of RACE amplification were performed, with 22 out of the 45 signatures (49%) generating
a product in one or both rounds. Product sizes ranged
from 106 to 531 base pairs, exclusive of the poly(A) tract
(Additional File 1). Seven reactions produced multiple
amplicons that exhibited widely differing database
matches and thus no definitive identification could be
made. Of the remaining 15 signatures, all produced a single product as assessed by gel electrophoresis. Sequences
of all except 2 of the 15 exhibited high similarity, at the
nucleotide level, to ESTs recently collected from Alexandrium tamarense [28]. Further identification was achieved
through translated searches of the GenBank database; 12
RACE products matched known dinoflagellate genes, one
had no similarities to known proteins, and two showed
homology to non-dinoflagellate genes.
Sequence variants of only three known dinoflagellate
genes accounted for more than half of the signatures that
could be identified (9 of 15). Four of the 15 signatures
matched the luciferin-binding protein gene (lbp) of the
dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedrum. These include the
second and ninth most abundant signatures overall; all
four signatures are more abundant in the P/40 library.
Four of the 15 signatures matched the histone-like protein
genes (hlp) known from the dinoflagellates Crypthecodinium cohnii and Lingulodinium polyedrum. These RACE
sequences are also more distantly related to the histonelike protein sequence (HAf) identified by Taroncher-Oldenburg and Anderson (2000) [12] in this same organism,
sharing homology only in the central domain of the protein. All four of the signatures matching histone-like protein transcripts are more highly expressed in the P/40
library; one of them is the third most abundant signature
and the other three are unique to the P/40 library. One of
the 15 signatures produced a RACE product that matched
the S-adenosyl-homocysteine hydrolase gene (SAHH)
first identified in A. fundyense by Taroncher-Oldenburg
and Anderson (2000) [12]. This signature was more
highly expressed in the N/40 library and was derived from
an upstream DpnII site. The signature including the
downstream 3'-end DpnII site matched one of the RACE

primers that did not produce a product (the product size
would have been 32 bp). This signature was the fifth most
abundant signature overall.
The remaining six signatures that were identified each
mapped to a different gene. One of these signatures was
unique to the P/40 library and showed homology to the
ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase gene of Arabidopsis
thaliana. Two of the six signatures were moderately
expressed and more abundant in the P/40 library; these
showed homology to a light-harvesting protein gene from
the dinoflagellate Heterocapsa triquetra and the cytochrome b gene of the dinoflagellate Pfiesteria piscicida. The
other three signatures of the six were expressed at low levels in only the N/40 library. These signatures were homologous to the dinoflagellate peridinin-chlorophyll abinding protein, a seed storage protein, and an A. tamarense EST.
For most of the signatures, multiple sequence variants
were observed amongst the multiple clones of each product that were sequenced. For example, the RACE product
generated by signature #49 appeared as a single band on
an agarose gel, was cloned and 6 clones were sequenced.
All 6 of the sequences matched lbp, but the sequences
themselves varied in length from 243 to 261 bases, and
contained sequence variations ranging from 1–3 indels to
1–3 base pair changes. Thus, in the RACE reactions, we
observed both multiple signatures mapping to the same
gene, as well as multiple sequence variants of one gene
carrying the same signature.

Discussion
Alexandrium signature content
We have utilized MPSS to examine gene expression in
Alexandrium cells grown under widely differing physiological conditions, where both nutrient status and toxicity
vary. The results of this analysis provide a global view of
the transcriptome and its regulation in these unusual single-celled eukaryotes. The number of unique signatures in
Alexandrium is quite comparable to the values observed in
humans and Arabidopsis, two other eukaryotes that have
been analyzed using MPSS: ~20,000–27,000 signatures
per library in Alexandrium, compared to ~14,000–45,000
in humans and ~11,000–25,000 in Arabidopsis (Table 3)
[24,29]. Thus, if the MPSS signature number provides a
"rough first estimate of the complexity of gene expression" [30], Alexandrium exhibits significant transcriptional
complexity, on par with multicellular eukaryotes.

Because dinoflagellates contain so much cellular DNA, yet
so little is known about their gene content and organization, it may be tempting to make inferences about gene
number based upon signature number. However, even the
few paired data available on the number of genes and
MPSS signatures (Table 3) show the relationship between
the two values to be unpredictable. Studies that have
matched expression tags (from both SAGE and MPSS) to
their corresponding transcripts from genome and EST
sequencing projects (e.g. [29-33]) have revealed a number
of reasons why each unique signature does not necessarily
correspond to a unique chromosomal gene. Some signatures arise from non-chromosomal genes, primarily mito-

chondrial or ribosomal transcripts, or from sequencing
error. A single gene may produce more than one signature
sequence due to alternative splicing, alternative 3' termination and polyadenylation, or cleavage at an upstream
restriction site on different mRNA copies. Signatures may
be derived from antisense transcripts. Each gene may not
produce a unique signature because the transcript may
not contain the restriction site, or the site may be too close
to the polyA tail to produce a meaningful signature. Two
(or more) transcripts may also share the same signature
sequence by chance alone. Many of these processes are
operating in dinoflagellates, Arabidopsis and humans.
However, alternative splicing, which contributes to transcriptome diversification, is thought to occur at a much
lower rate in unicellular eukaryotes than in multicellular
eukaryotes [34]. Nonetheless, for all of these reasons it is
problematic to make inferences about gene content based
solely upon MPSS signature numbers.
Signature abundance distribution and expression in
Alexandrium
The abundance distribution of Alexandrium signatures is
quite typical of other eukaryotes examined. The vast
majority of the signatures (>90%) are present at less than
0.01% abundance (100 tpm), indicating that most genes
are expressed at very low levels. If we assume that a cell
contains an average of 300,000 mRNA molecules [35],
this corresponds to less than 30 copies per cell. In eukaryotes, the vast majority (>90%) of mRNA sequences are
present at less than 9 copies per cell, with very few
sequences present in a high abundance class that constitutes about one-fifth of the cellular RNA [36]. The Alexandrium signature abundance data show this same classic
profile, and other recent work using SAGE and MPSS has
confirms the generality of this abundance pattern. Zhang
et al. (1997) [33] found that 86% of transcripts identified
via SAGE were present at less than 5 copies per cell, and
only 0.11% of all transcripts were found at >500 copies
per cell. MPSS analysis of cultured human cell lines
showed only 7 signatures with greater than 10,000 tpm
abundance, with ~90% of signatures present at less than
100 tpm [30]. In a variety of Arabidopsis tissues analyzed

by MPSS, more than two-thirds of signatures are present
at less than 100 tpm [31].
The extent of expression regulation also shows similarities
between Alexandrium and Arabidopsis, an organism that
has been subject to extensive MPSS analysis [24,31]. In
both organisms, about half of all signatures are shared
between conditions, and roughly half of those are constantly expressed. Of the shared genes that are differentially regulated, the expression ratios range from 2 to
almost 60. These data demonstrate quite clearly that dinoflagellates commonly employ transcriptional regulation
of their genes. Even at the most stringent significance values used in Table 2, approximately 10% of total signatures
show differential regulation. This is about three times
higher than that observed in microarray analyses of Pyrocystis lunula [16,17], where approximately 3% of their targets showed expression differences. The difference in the
magnitude of differential expression is likely due to multiple factors. The Pyrocystis studies used short-term (hours)
exposures to their experimental conditions versus the
longer (days) exposure to nutrient stress in this study, and
the proportion of genes regulated on these varying time
scales may be very different. In addition, the sampling
depth of MPSS detects more low copy number genes and
smaller expression differences, which would contribute to
the greater number of differentially expressed transcripts
in the MPSS data.
RACE analysis of MPSS signatures
The abundance and distribution of the Alexandrium signatures is very similar to that of other eukaryotes that have
been analyzed. The results of the RACE analysis of MPSS
signatures, however, suggest a mechanism that may be
more common in dinoflagellates and would contribute to
the transcriptional complexity of Alexandrium. We
hypothesize that dinoflagellates exhibit an increased tendency for genes to occur in multiple copies such as long
tandem repeats. This could easily increase signature diversity if the repeats are not exact copies of one another, but
instead contain sequence differences at or near their 3'
restriction sites. This is evident from the RACE results,

where only three dinoflagellate genes are responsible for
9 of the mapped signatures – luciferin-binding protein,
SAHH and histone-like protein. In addition, many of the
signatures produced multiple sequence variants amongst
the cloned RACE products, indicating the presence of yet
more copies of the gene in question. For example, the four
MPSS signatures that matched lbp comprised 24 different
sequence variants in total.
The MPSS and RACE data provide a global view of a phenomenon that is becoming increasingly apparent in the
literature of dinoflagellate gene content and regulation:
the presence of widespread gene duplication in these
organisms. One of the earliest descriptions of a cloned
gene in dinoflagellates – the lbp of Lingulodinium polyedrum – reported the presence of ~1000 copies of this gene
in the genome [9]. The gene encoding the peridinin-chlorophyll a-binding protein (pcp) of this same species was
documented to occur as ~5000 copies arranged in long
tandem repeats [8], making pcp one of the most highly
repeated protein-coding genes ever reported. Tandem
repeat organization of ~100 copies has been described for
the luciferase gene (lcf) of L. polyedrum [10], and ~30 copies of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase gene have been
found in this organism [37]. The ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO) gene in another
species of dinoflagellate, Prorocentrum minimum, also
exists in multiple copies but with different gene organization. The RuBisCO genes are arranged in about 37 transcribed units, each containing four copies of the coding
region [38]. Dinoflagellate mitochondrial genes exhibit
similar sequence variation; the genes for cytochrome oxidase subunit I (cox1) and apocytochrome b (cob) occur as
multiple copies in several species [39,40]. The cob, cox1
and cox3 genes may exist as polyadenylated yet random
fragments in the mitochondria, sometimes with two to
four short DNA fragments, either from the same gene or
different genes, attached together and co-translated [41].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/88

While EST and other sequence data provide ample support for the duplication of multiple genes in dinoflagellates, it does not appear that dinoflagellates have simply
duplicated their entire genome. Studies of DNA reassociation kinetics in dinoflagellates [44-46] indicate that their
genomes contain roughly 50% repetitive DNA, which is
commensurate with eukaryotes in general and argues
against polyploidy or polyteny. Furthermore, population
genetic studies of dinoflagellates using microsatellite
markers have revealed only single alleles, supporting their
status as haploid during vegetative growth [47,48]. The
presence of multiple copies of many genes does provide
some explanation for the large genomes of dinoflagellates, where DNA content ranges from approximately 3 pg
of DNA·cell-1 to more than 200 pg·cell-1 [3,4].

Conclusion
The MPSS data indicate that Alexandrium exhibits significant transcriptional complexity, comparable to humans
and Arabidopsis. Furthermore, dinoflagellates seem to be
quite similar to multicellular eukaryotes in terms of signature abundance, distribution, and expression. This
includes the observation that expression of a significant
number of signatures are differentially regulated, whereas
previous studies of dinoflagellate gene regulation implicated translational control as the primary mechanism. The
results of signature mapping via RACE add to the growing
body of evidence for widespread gene duplication in
dinoflagellates, which would contribute to the transcriptional complexity of this organism. Furthermore, extensive duplication of many genes does provide one
mechanism for the expansion of the dinoflagellate
genome without invoking wholesale genome duplication,
although it is unlikely that gene duplication is responsible
for the total DNA content of dinoflagellates. The question
still remains, however, as to the underlying mechanism
for the expansion of individual genes in dinoflagellates.

Methods
The growing number of expressed sequence tag (EST) collections for a variety of dinoflagellate species also shows
evidence of multicopy genes. In the dinoflagellate Karenia
brevis, 40% of the EST gene clusters showed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), indicating the presence of
multiple copies of those genes [42]. SNPs have been
observed at a similar rate in EST libraries from both
Amphidinium carterae and L. polyedrum [43]. A collection
of 6723 unique EST sequences has been generated for
Alexandrium tamarense, a member of the same species
complex as A. fundyense [28]. Clustering of their ESTs
revealed multiple sequences for hlp, lbp, pcp, ATP synthase,
light harvesting protein, RuBisCO, cytochrome c6, elongation factor 1-alpha, as well as several unknown and potentially dinoflagellate-specific proteins.

Isolates and culture conditions
Alexandrium fundyense CA28 is a clonal, toxin-producing
strain isolated from the Gulf of Maine, Massachusetts,
USA. Culture medium consisted of 0.45 µm-filtered natural seawater (Vineyard Sound, MA, salinity 31‰)
enriched with F/2 nutrients [49]. Cultures were grown at
20°C on a 14:10 light:dark cycle with cool-white fluorescent illumination of approximately 150 µE·m-2·s-1.
Starter cultures were grown to mid-log phase in one liter
of medium. Cells from starter cultures were quantified
microscopically and used to inoculate 18 L carboy cultures to a beginning density of 200 cells·mL-1. In one carboy, the added nitrate concentration of the medium was
reduced to 5% of F/2 level (N/40), while all other nutrients remained the same. Similarly, a second carboy contained reduced-phosphate medium (5% of F/2 = P/40)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:88

Measurement of cell density, nutrient concentrations and
toxin content
At the beginning of each light period, a sample was aseptically withdrawn from each carboy. Triplicate 1 mL subsamples were preserved in Utermohl's iodine solution for
cell counts [50]. Cell density was determined daily by
counting at least 200 cells from each preserved subsample. A 30 mL subsample was filtered through a 25 mm
diameter combusted GF/F filter and the filtrate was stored
at -20°C for spectrophotometric determination of nitrate
and phosphate concentrations.
RNA preparation
Cells were harvested for RNA isolation when the growth
rate slowed, at the transition between log and stationary
growth phases. Also at that time, one liter of culture was
transferred to a sterile flask for continued monitoring. The
remaining culture volume was processed in one liter portions by passage through a 20 µm nitex sieve. The resulting cell concentrate was washed from the sieve, pelleted
by centrifugation and resuspended in one mL of RNAWiz
(Ambion, Inc.) then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Approximately 1 × 107 cells were used for RNA extraction.
Cell suspensions were removed from liquid nitrogen and
thawed at room temperature. After the addition of 0.5
mm zirconium beads, they were processed by 3, 50-second cycles in a mini-beadbeater (BioSpec Products), and
total RNA was isolated from the cell lysate following the
manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was quantified by
spectrophotometer and its integrity was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified by two
rounds of selection using the Poly(A)Pure kit (Ambion,
Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. The
poly(A)+ RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically, and
2 µg was sent to Solexa, Inc. for Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing.
Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS)
The mRNA was processed through the MPSS protocol
essentially as described in Brenner et al. (2000) [20].
Briefly, the mRNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA. The
cDNA was digested with DpnII and the 21 bases adjacent
to the 3'-most DpnII site was cloned into a vector. The
resulting library was PCR amplified and loaded onto
microbeads. About 1.6 million microbeads was loaded
into each flow cell and the sequence of the 17 bp at the 5'
end of each fragment was determined via a series of enzymatic reactions, described in detail in Brenner et al.
(2000)[20]. More than 1 million sequences were
obtained from each sample. The occurrence of each specific non-redundant 17 bp sequence, termed a signature,
is summed across all sequences obtained from a library.
The abundance of each signature is then normalized to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/88

one million (transcripts per million, tpm) for the purpose
of comparison between samples. Signature abundance is
the N/40 library is herein referred to as tpmN, with tpmP
designating the abundance in the P/40 library.
Analysis of MPSS data
Two filters were applied to the complete set of unique signatures derived from the N/40 and P/40 samples in order
to remove signatures that may arise from errors in the
MPSS procedure (these filters are discussed in detail in
[24]). The first filter – the "reliability filter" – removes any
signature that is observed in only one sequencing run
across all libraries, with the aim of eliminating signatures
that result from technical problems specific to a single
sequencing run. The second filter – the "significance" filter
– selects for only those signatures that are found at 4 tpm
or above in at least one library. The goal of this filter is to
remove signatures that are consistently present at background levels. A cut-off of 4 tpm as opposed to 3 tpm was
chosen because, in the Arabidopsis analysis, 4 tpm was
found to be different from 0 tpm at p < 0.05, and 1, 2 or
3 tpm was not significantly different from 0 tpm (p >
0.05) [31]. For consistency, the human MPSS data [29]
were downloaded from the authors' website [51] and analyzed using these two filters, as the data analysis presented
in the paper used a significance cut-off of 3 tpm.
Generation and analysis of 3' cDNA fragments using MPSS
signatures
A procedure similar to 3' rapid amplification of cDNA
ends (RACE) was used to obtain 3' cDNA fragments for
identification of the transcripts from which the signatures
were derived (thus, they are referred to hereafter in the text
as "RACE" products, reactions, etc). mRNA was purified as
described above, from additional aliquots of the cells used
for MPSS. Reverse transcription was performed using
ThermoScript RT (Invitrogen Corp.) according to the
manufacturer's instructions and an anchored oligo-dT
primer incorporating a priming site for later PCR amplification (3RACEdT, 5'-AAG CAG TGG TAT CAA CGC AGA
GTA CT30VN-3' where V = A/G/C). The resulting cDNA
was PCR amplified using the 17 bp MPSS signature
sequence as the 5' or forward primer and the synthetic
primer sequence as the reverse primer (3RACE, 5'-AAG
CAG TGG TAT CAA CGC AGA GTA C-3'). PCR reactions
were performed in a final volume of 25 µL containing 1×
PCR buffer, 100 µM dNTPs, 0.4 µM each primer, 1.5 µL of
cDNA and 2.5 U of Taq polymerase (New England
Biolabs). Amplification consisted of an initial hold at
95°C for 2 min., followed by 45 cycles at 95°C for 30 sec.,
annealing temp. for 45 sec. and 72°C for 1 min., followed
by a final 10 min. incubation at 72°C. Because the annealing temperatures of the different MPSS signature primers
varied, PCR was performed in a gradient PCR cycler, and
reaction tubes were placed in the block positions corre-

sponding to a temperature of 5°C below the calculated Tm
of the MPSS signature primer.

Cloning and sequencing
The presence of RACE products was verified by agarose gel
electrophoresis of 10% of the total reaction volume. For
all reactions in which only a single amplicon was
observed, the remaining reaction volume was purified
using the Qia PCR cleanup kit (Qiagen Inc.), and the purified product was cloned into the pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen Corp.). Several clones from each of the RACE
products (usually 6–8) were sequenced in both directions,
using vector primers and Big Dye Terminator sequencing
chemistry v3.0 (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing reactions were visualized on an ABI 3730xl capillary
sequencer (Applied Biosystems) and edited using
Sequencher (GeneCodes Corp.). Sequences were compared to the GenBank nr and est databases using the
tblastx algorithm, to determine similarity to known gene
sequences. RACE products are deposited in GenBank
under the sequential accession numbers DY241874DY241888.
