Hymenoptera: insights from a family-level
supertree

Abstract
Background: The order Hymenoptera (bees, ants, wasps, sawflies) contains about eight percent of all described
species, but no analytical studies have addressed the origins of this richness at family-level or above. To investigate
which major subtaxa experienced significant shifts in diversification, we assembled a family-level phylogeny of the
Hymenoptera using supertree methods. We used sister-group species-richness comparisons to infer the phylogenetic
position of shifts in diversification.
Results: The supertrees most supported by the underlying input trees are produced using matrix representation with
compatibility (MRC) (from an all-in and a compartmentalised analysis). Whilst relationships at the tips of the tree tend
to be well supported, those along the backbone of the tree (e.g. between Parasitica superfamilies) are generally not.
Ten significant shifts in diversification (six positive and four negative) are found common to both MRC supertrees. The
Apocrita (wasps, ants, bees) experienced a positive shift at their origin accounting for approximately 4,000 species.
Within Apocrita other positive shifts include the Vespoidea (vespoid wasps/ants containing 24,000 spp.), Anthophila +
Sphecidae (bees/thread-waisted wasps; 22,000 spp.), Bethylidae + Chrysididae (bethylid/cuckoo wasps; 5,200 spp.),
Dryinidae (dryinid wasps; 1,100 spp.), and Proctotrupidae (proctotrupid wasps; 310 spp.). Four relatively species-poor
families (Stenotritidae, Anaxyelidae, Blasticotomidae, Xyelidae) have undergone negative shifts. There are some twoway shifts in diversification where sister taxa have undergone shifts in opposite directions.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that numerous phylogenetically distinctive radiations contribute to the richness of
large clades. They also suggest that evolutionary events restricting the subsequent richness of large clades are
common. Problematic phylogenetic issues in the Hymenoptera are identified, relating especially to superfamily validity
(e.g. "Proctotrupoidea", "Mymarommatoidea"), and deeper apocritan relationships. Our results should stimulate new
functional studies on the causes of the diversification shifts we have identified. Possible drivers highlighted for specific
adaptive radiations include key anatomical innovations, the exploitation of rich host groups, and associations with
angiosperms. Low richness may have evolved as a result of geographical isolation, specialised ecological niches, and
habitat loss or competition.
Background
One of the greatest challenges in evolutionary biology is
to explain heterogeneity in species richness amongst
taxa, and in particular why a few notable taxa comprise
the majority of species [1-4]. With over half of all
described species, the insects pose perhaps the most
obvious target group for biologists attempting to tackle
this problem [5]. In this paper we address the phyloge* Correspondence: davis@ut.ee

netic location of shifts in diversification within one of the
largest insect orders, the Hymenoptera (bees, ants, wasps
and sawflies), containing some eight percent of all
described species.
Phylogenies are useful tools for understanding the evolution of species richness. Since they specify shared common ancestry and absolute or relative taxon age they
allow appropriate comparisons to be made amongst taxa,
[6-8]. Taxon age in turn is important because for a given
positive net rate of cladogenesis, species richness will
increase over time. Thus, the species richness of a taxon

can only be identified as anomalous if its absolute or relative age is also known. The cladistic and molecular revolutions, which have advanced phylogenetic information,
have also therefore stimulated the development of statistical techniques that can best use the available phylogenetic information for macroevolutionary inference [1-5].
One of the most useful pieces of macroevolutionary
information that can be extracted from a phylogeny is the
identity of clades that are different, relative to others, in
their rates of speciation and/or extinction. Once the identity of these exceptional clades is known, hypotheses
about underlying causes may be tested [9], for example
relating to adaptive radiations [10] or key innovations
[11] although this may not always be straightforward [12].
Within the insects, some studies have attempted to do
this at level of order or family [13-15], but within orders
macroevolutionary studies have generally focussed on a
small subset of taxa [16-20], which places obvious constraints on the explanatory potential of the study. A notable exception is the study of Hunt et al. [21] using a
phylogeny of nearly 2,000 beetle species to estimate shifts
in diversification across the order. Consistent with a comparable study across the angiosperm families [22], they
detected numerous, both positive and negative, shifts in
diversification.
There are four insect orders with over 100,000
described species, of which the Hymenoptera is one [2325]. Little work has addressed the evolutionary origins of
this diversity. Below family-level, ant diversification has
been attributed to co-evolution with angiosperms [19],
fig wasp diversification has been attributed to co-speciation with their host plants [26], nematine sawfly diversification has been linked to the exploitation of a larger host
plant range [27], and the limited diversification of bumble
bees has been attributed to biogeographical constraints
[18], but the influence of such factors at higher taxonomic levels within the order have not been investigated.
Studies addressing the role of parasitism in insect diversification more generally have also included hymenopteran
data. For example, Mitter et al. [28] show increased diversification in phytophagous groups of insect (including the
hymenopterous sawflies), but the same authors [29]
found no evidence to suggest carnivorous parasitism
(including the hymenopterous Parasitica) itself, enhanced
diversification.
Clearly, if studies of Hymenoptera macroevolution are
to be conducted at large taxonomic scales, appropriate
phylogenies will be needed. Few large-scale
hymenopteran phylogenies have been produced, and
those that have are based solely on morphological data
[30-34]. The most recent large-scale morphological phylogeny was constructed in 1999 [34]. Since 1999, and
Ronquist's influential "State of the Art" hymenopteran
phylogenetics symposium [35] a wealth of Hymenoptera

phylogenies have been published. Perhaps most significant is the increased contribution of molecular work, in
its infancy in 1999, alongside morphological work. Most
molecular work however, has been fairly focussed, concentrating on certain subsets of hymenopteran families
from the two traditional suborders Symphyta (sawflies)
[36,37], or Apocrita (bees, ants and wasps) [38,39], or at
even lower taxonomic levels such as superfamily [40,41].
Symphyta are now accepted as a paraphyletic grade of
taxa within which Apocrita is nested. Within this symphytan grade, the family Xyelidae are well supported as
the sister group to all other Hymenoptera, and Orussidae
are often supported as the sister lineage to Apocrita
[34,42,43]. Within Apocrita there is a further subdivision
into the Parasitica (parasitic wasps) and Aculeata (bees,
ants and stinging wasps). Again, Parasitica is accepted
now as paraphyletic, with Aculeata nested within it
[24,34,44] (Figure 1). The Ichneumonoidea (Ichneumonidae + Braconidae) is often considered to be the sister
group to Aculeata [24,44]. Apocritan relationships are
however controversial and finding a consensus on familial and even superfamilial relationships is difficult [44].
For example, the validity of some superfamilies (e.g. Proctotrupoidea) is questionable [24,44] and relationships
within other more accepted superfamilies (e.g. Chalcidoidea) are highly debateable [24,40,45,46].
Here we take available molecular, morphological and
palaeontological information to construct a family-level
supertree of the Hymenoptera including extinct taxa,
presenting, in terms of the scope of its evidence base, the
largest phylogenetic analysis of Hymenoptera to date.
The supertree is used to examine the points at which
Hymenoptera have experienced significant shifts in
diversification. We then explore possible reasons for
these shifts in the light of previous hypotheses, and their
ability to explain Hymenoptera species richness.

Methods
Taxonomy

For consistency with other analyses by us on other orders
[13] the taxonomic nomenclature is taken from a family
list generated from Gordh & Headrick [47] for living families. There are slight differences between this list and
other authoritative lists for Hymenoptera (see additional
file 1): the list generally follows Gauld & Bolton [48],
although departs significantly in splitting Apidae (sensu
lato) into several families, following Goulet & Huber [49].
Gordh & Headrick [47] also include taxa that were recognised prior to Gauld & Bolton [48] but have since been
assigned subfamily status by most researchers (e.g.
Loboscelidiidae). By including such taxa in our input tree
search, we allowed maximal opportunity for data coverage where phylogenetic studies distinguish them. Where
possible we also included extinct families (despite their

exclusion from diversification analyses below). A benefit
of including extinct taxa is that they can help resolve phylogenetic problems [50], and may aid future attempts to
date the tree. We used the nomenclature of Ross &
Jarzembowski [51] and the regularly updated EDNA Fossil Insect Database http://edna.palass-hosting.org/
search.php for extinct families. Our diversification analyses were only conducted with extant taxa (see below). For
a full list of taxa and alternative taxonomies see additional file 1.
Input Trees

Input trees were sought online via Web of Science and
Google Scholar using the following keywords:
hymenoptera*, apocrita*, aculeata*, parasitica*, symphyta*, phylogen*, cladistic, cladogram. (* where any
word begins with those letters). Further source studies
were collected from the reference sections of these
papers. Potential input trees from the collected literature
were extracted manually and compiled into a dataset of
hymenopteran phylogenies. Hennig [52] is often cited as

a milestone in hexapod phylogenetics (synthesizing his
initial cladistic views), and only studies post-1969 were
considered. New papers on hymenopteran phylogeny are
regularly published, so a cut-off date of December 2008
was used to facilitate future updates of our work.
A total of 101 input trees were obtained from the literature, which contain information on hymenopteran family
relationships. However, not all of these could be retained
for the final analysis as there is data non-independence
(i.e. where different studies overlap in the primary data
they use) between them. This is a major challenge with
supertree analyses when they are used to summarise published phylogenies (but not when supertrees are used as
phylogenomic tools [53]) as it is often impossible to fully
remove data non-independence without unnecessary loss
of other information. Following, and slightly modifying,
the guidelines of Bininda-Emonds et al. [54] we attempt
to minimise data non-independence as far as possible.
Choosing which input trees to keep is done as follows:
• Where data overlap is under 50% we retain both
trees

Davis et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:109
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/109

• Where data overlap is over 50% but taxon overlap is
under 50% we keep both trees
• Where data and taxon overlap is 50% or over, we
first take the author's preferred hypothesis, because
supertrees are designed to synthesise current hypotheses.
• Where no tree is explicitly preferred, we take the
most comprehensive tree, because supertrees are
designed to be comprehensive.
• Where both trees are equally comprehensive we
take the most recent tree, under the notion that inferences converge on the truth with time.
• Where both trees are equally recent, we use a tree
that has support measures provided over one that
does not, as a more reliable phylogeny.
• Where trees cannot be chosen based on the above
criteria we use all available trees and downweight
them in the final analysis accordingly.
Of the 101 trees in the dataset, 24 were removed based
on the above protocol. Of the families listed in Gauld &
Bolton [48], only four were absent from input trees: the
Rotoitidae (Chalcidoidea), the Eucoilidae (Cynipoidea),
the Peredeniidae (Proctotrupoidea) and the Austroniidae
(Proctotrupoidea). For a list of input trees and data nonindependence see additional file 2. Input tree files are
available on request from RBD.
Within these trees, valid taxa (see taxonomic nomenclature) were sometimes portrayed either as paraphyletic
or polyphyletic, for example in molecular data sets where
a single family could be represented by several species. In
these instances polyphyletic families were removed
entirely as their placement is uncertain. Paraphyletic families were condensed into a single branch. This issue
could be dealt with in other ways. For example weighted
sets of input trees representing alternative placements of
such taxa could be used. Our approach is more pragmatic
than this. Alternatively, such taxa could be entirely
removed from supertree analysis, but this could result in
unnecessary loss of information. The effects of other
approaches to dealing with this issue are unknown.
Supertree Methods

Many previous supertree studies [22,55-64] have used the
popular matrix representation with parsimony (MRP)
method [65,66] only, though some more recent studies
use multiple methods [67,68]. We implement three
supertree methods; two matrix-based and one distancebased, to avoid over-reliance on a single method, and to
ensure we obtain as optimal a phylogeny as possible. In
addition to MRP, we use matrix representation with compatibility (MRC (also known as split-fit)) [69], and the
average consensus method [70]. Although the average
consensus approach can use branch length information,
here we do not as many trees do not have such informa-

tion available. We avoided using strict supertree methods
as they only identify relationships common to all input
trees [71]. For software and settings see additional file 3.
Analyses of the complete data were successfully conducted using the average consensus and MRC methods.
However, analysis of the full data set could not be conducted using MRP. There is a high amount of conflict in
the dataset, which makes the analysis more computationally challenging. Furthermore poorly represented taxa
(i.e. with much missing data in the MRP matrix) cloud the
analysis. We note that different supertree methods are
implemented in different software and the number of
optimal trees returned will reflect not only the data but
also the efficiency of tree searching. To enable analysis
using MRP, in addition to MRC and the average consensus the dataset was split into three widely accepted subgroups within Hymenoptera: Symphyta, Parasitica and
Aculeata. Since Symphyta and Parasitica are likely not
monophyletic (Figure 1) the most widely represented
member of the relevant nested clade, here Vespidae, was
included in these analyses to test for paraphyly and to
provide a reference point in order to graft the three parts
of the hymenopteran tree together. Including more
nested aculeate families has no effect on the outcome of
the analyses. Separate supertree analyses were run for
these three groups of hymenopteran taxa. The following
summarises the analyses undertaken using each technique:
• Standard MRP: Separate Symphyta, Parasitica and
Aculeata supertrees produced and grafted together.
This constrains the monophyly of Aculeata and Apocrita. Due to large amounts of conflict in the data set,
Parasitica families that were underrepresented (i.e. <
10 pseudocharacters in the matrix) or only in input
tree polytomies had to be removed to ensure the analysis could be completed. Fully bifurcating trees were
required for our diversification analysis. Extended
majority rule trees display all relationships in 50% or
more of the most parsimonious trees (MPTs) recovered in supertree analysis. Where less than 50% of
these MPTs agree on one relationship, the relationship with the largest proportion of sub-50% agreement between MPTs is displayed producing a fully
bifurcating tree. In the extended majority rule setting
symphytan and aculeate taxa in polytomies were
additionally removed. Their inclusion cannot be justified as the extended majority rule method will arbitrarily place them in bifurcating splits without any
precise information on this.
• MRC: Separate Symphyta, Parasitica and Aculeata
supertrees were produced. Problematic Parasitica did
not need removing, but could be removed for direct
comparison with standard MRP results. Analyses
were also run using the all-inclusive dataset and the

Davis et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:109

supertree compared to the re-grafted one to test the
effects of constraining monophyly. In the extended
majority rule setting symphytan and aculeate taxa in
polytomies were additionally removed.
• Average consensus: Separate Symphyta, Parasitica
and Aculeata supertrees were produced. Underrepresented Parasitica did not need removing, but all taxa
only in polytomies were removed as the average consensus method produces only one fully bifurcating
tree. The reasons behind the removal of these taxa are
the same as if an extended majority rule tree was to be
constructed (see above). Analyses were also run using
the all-inclusive dataset.
We use the V index of Wilkinson et al. [72] to measure
support. This considers the number of input trees in
agreement and in conflict with relationships in the supertree on a scale running from -1 (all conflicting) to +1 (all
supporting). For a given relationship in a supertree, each
input tree can either support or conflict with this, where
the taxa involved in the relationship are represented.
Each input tree can therefore contribute a score of +1
(indicating support) or -1 (indicating conflict) to the
score for a relationship in a supertree. All +1s and -1s are
added and a mean calculated to provide scores for individual relationships. The mean of these nodal scores can
also be calculated to provide an overall V score for a
supertree allowing comparison between supertrees produced using different methods. V+ is a more liberal score,
which considers permitting relationships in input trees
(e.g. polytomies) as support (+1), and is also used here. V
scores were calculated using the software stsupport
(obtained in January 2007 from http://webspace.qmul.ac.uk/jacotton/software/stsupport.html#Download). For clarity of presentation we use
branch thickness to visualise support for relationships in
figures and provide a table of V and V+ scores in additional file 4. An alternative supertree-specific support
measure, rQS [73,74] was not used as this has been found
to be unreliable [75,76]. Output files are available on
request from RBD.
Diversification Analysis

Fully bifurcating extended majority rule trees were used
for analysing shifts in diversification within the extant lineages of Hymenoptera. The MRP and MRC trees had
similar positive V support (see additional file 5), but as we
wished to use the most complete a tree for diversity analyses, we chose MRC supertrees over those produced by
standard MRP. We were able to retain more taxa for MRC
analyses and as we could run an all-inclusive analysis
(without needing to constrain any clades), this is arguably
a preferable approach. The average consensus tree was
poorly supported (see additional file 5) and not used for
diversification analyses. The two MRC trees differ greatly

Page 5 of 16

in deeper apocritan relationships (shown as a consensus
network in Figure 2). Given that these relationships are
weakly supported, both were used in diversification analysis to test the effects of alternative phylogenetic hypotheses on our findings, and therefore determining which
shifts in diversification are robust to changes in the phylogeny.
We compared sister taxon species richness to assess
where significant shifts in diversification have occurred
during the evolution of the Hymenoptera, as used previously in studies of insect species richness [13,14]. This
analysis does not require information on dates of branching events, which we have not attempted to infer. If sister
taxa radiate at equal, but not necessarily constant, rates
over time, including extinction [77] all possible sizes of
splits of N species between these two clades are equally
likely [78]. The two-tailed probability of an equal or
greater magnitude of split under the null hypothesis of
equal net diversification rates is given by 2 [Nsmall/(Nsmall
+ Nlarge - 1)].
Care must be taken when interpreting the results of this
analysis, as a seemingly significant difference in species
richness at a basal node may be attributable to such an
occurrence towards the crown (i.e. a "trickle-down"
effect). We therefore use the method of Davies et al. [22]
to account for this (see also Hunt et al. [21]), which works
using a contingent species-richness correction algorithm
(Figure 3). Such species-richness correction methods
have been shown to be more valid than a range of alternatives in simulations [79], and produce intuitively sensible
results [13,14,21,22].
Species richness for most families was taken from Goulet & Huber [49]. Most of the values are estimates of
described species richness. However, the number of
described species is not accurately known for the two
largest families, Braconidae and Ichneumonidae. Estimates vary markedly from source to source, and both are
known to be markedly underdescribed. We therefore also
follow Goulet & Huber [49] in using the widely cited estimates of 60,000 spp. for Ichneumonidae [80] and 40,000
spp. for Braconidae [81], which although far larger than
the number of described species are still possibly underestimates of true species richness. Alternative lower estimates have no effect on the results below. If estimates
were not given in Goulet & Huber [49], they were taken
from Parker [82], except for Stenotritidae [83] and Pterygophoridae [84]. Lastly, an outgroup to all Hymenoptera
was required in order to test for a significant difference in
species richness at the basal node of the tree. Whether we
take the panorpidan orders (Diptera, Lepidoptera,
Mecoptera, Siphonaptera, Strepsiptera and Trichoptera)
[76,85,86] or all other Holometabola [87-89] as the sister
group to Hymenoptera, has no effect on our overall find-

Figure 3 The method of Davies et al. (2004) explained. In Figure 3A taxa a and b have significantly different species richnesses (N). To detect the
direction of the shift here we compare Na and Nb to N of their nearest outgroup c. As N does not differ significantly between a and c, but does between
b and c, we have detected a significant downshift in species richness associated with b. Figure 3B shows a more complicated scenario, where taxon c
is made of two taxa d and e, which have significantly different species richnesses and they themselves need comparing to their outgroup (i.e. a + b).
However, it is not possible to compare the values for Na, Nb, Nd or Ne as they are relative outgroups to one another in which we have not been able to
detect the direction of the significant shift. In such circumstances, the combined N of species rich taxa (for example a and d) are compared to N of the
next outgroup f. The same goes for the species poor taxa (for example b and e). In this example it is Nb + Ne which is significantly different to Nf and we
have therefore detected significant downshifts in taxa b and e.

ings. We take a combined described species estimate
from Grimaldi & Engel [24] for this purpose.

Results
Whilst relationships at the tips of the supertrees tend to
be well supported, those along the tree backbone are
often less so, notably amongst the Parasitica superfamilies (e.g. Figure 4). The paraphyly of Symphyta and Parasitica is supported, as is the monophyly of Aculeata.
Apocrita appear monophyletic (ignoring the position of
the poorly represented fossil family Karativitidae in one
analysis), with Orussidae as their sister in all analyses.
The monophyly of most superfamilies is supported, but
Mymarommatidae (often afforded separate superfamily
status) nest within Chalcidoidea. Our analysis also provides no support for the monophyly of Proctotrupoidea
(Figure 4).
Ten significant shifts in diversification (six positive and
four negative) are found common to both MRC supertrees (Table 1, Figure 4, additional file 5). The most inclusive shift is the suborder Apocrita. Apocrita contain over
180,000 species, compared to the 70 of Orussidae,
although most of these species can be attributed to shifts
in diversification further up the tree (Table 1).
The Vespoidea (excluding Sierolomorphidae) and the
Anthophila + Sphecidae (forming the majority of
Apoidea) are also recovered as significant positive shifts
in diversification with possibly sizeable effects on species
richness (Table 1). Other shifts are confined to smaller
clades comprising only one or two families: upshifts in
diversification in Bethylidae + Chrysididae, in Dryinidae,
and in Proctotrupidae, and downshifts in diversification
in Stenotritidae, Anaxyelidae, Blasticotomidae and Xyelidae. Only one of these shifts is linked to a phylogenetic
topology not recovered in the standard MRP tree: in the
MRP tree Sierolomorphidae nests within Vespoidea as
sister to Formicidae + Falsiformicidae (i.e. ants), and not
at the base of this superfamily.
In addition to these positive and negative shifts in
diversification are six examples of a significant difference
in species richness between sister taxa, but not a significant difference with respect to their outgroup. Two of
these involve Chalcidoidea families, two involve Apoidea
families, and one each involves cynipoid and vespoid
families (Figure 4). Each tree also produces a small number of shifts in diversification not found in the other tree
(see additional file 6); these are generally away from the
backbone of the tree with the exception of a possible positive shift of all Hymenoptera to the exclusion of Xyelidae
in the compartmentalised MRC tree. Many of these are
poorly supported groups or the relationship with their
sister group is poorly supported (see V scores in additional file 4).

Discussion
We have produced a family-level phylogeny of
Hymenoptera that is the most comprehensive to date in
terms of its evidence base. We include almost all living
and many fossil families. As a result we have also identified several likely shifts in diversification. Below we first
discuss the implications of our trees for the future of
Hymenoptera phylogenetics. We then discuss the implications of the identified shifts in diversification.
Hymenopteran Phylogeny

This supertree approach has yielded findings both supporting and questioning previous hypotheses across the
hymenopteran tree. Several relationships receive full support (V = 1) and appear in both MRC trees, indicating
that the phylogenetic evidence, as used in our analysis, is
in full agreement: Argidae + Pergidae, Cephoidea, Orussoidea (Symphyta); Aphelinidae + Trichogrammatidae,
Ceraphronoidea, Megaspilidae + Ceraphronidae, Evaniidae + Cretevaniidae (Parasitica); Anthophila, Megachilidae + Apidae + Anthophoridae (Aculeata). In addition to
these, two sets of relationships receive a V score of over
0.8: Argidae + Pergidae + Pterygophoridae (Symphyta),
and Eupelmidae + Encyrtidae (Parasitica). Furthermore,
symphytan superfamily relationships are consistently
recovered with a mostly well-supported branching order
in supertree analyses of (Xyelidae, (Tenthredinoidea,
(Megalodontoidea, (Cephoidea, (Siricoidea, (Xiphydriidae, (Orussoidea + Apocrita))))))), with Xiphydriidae outside of any existing superfamily. The latter has often
remained unclassified at a superfamily level [49]. Here we
find no evidence to place it in an existing superfamily
either, and its position, is in agreement with more recent
symphytan studies [37,42] Full V scores are provided in
additional file 4. Hence, our analyses suggest that the
above sets of relationships can be regarded as well known
and supported.
The most concerning lack of resolution regards apocritan superfamily relationships, and is highlighted by two
MRC and one MRP trees with alternative topologies (Figures 2, 4, additional files 7, 8). However, the shifts in
diversification we identified earlier are stable to these differences (see below). No group is strongly supported as
the sister group to Ichneumonoidea. Tentatively, the
Stephanidae might be closely related as in both MRC and
MRP analyses they are either singularly or in a more
inclusive clade as sister to Aculeata yet this is poorly supported (V = -0.728 or -0.642 respectively). Furthermore,
the validity of some traditionally recognised superfamilies is uncertain. Not all extended majority rule analyses
show Vespoidea to be monophyletic. Vespoid monophyly
has previously been questioned [48], though based on
features of Pompilidae (here shown to group in

Two-Way Shifts (Both Trees)

Note: Sometimes the number of species apparently involved in a shift is greater than the observed number for a clade (e.g. Vespoidea), where
subsequent negative shifts have prevented species richness getting as high as projected. Species richness calculations can be found in
additional file 9.

Vespoidea) and not Sierolomorphidae, which may sit outside Vespoidea.
Arguably our most interesting finding lies in the phylogeny of Chalcidoidea and Proctotrupoidea. Chalcidoidea are usually well accepted as a superfamily [24,90]
but here Mymarommatidae (the single family in Myma-

rommatoidea) always nest within them with good support in agreement with Krogmann & Vilhelmsen [46].
The status of Mymarommatoidea is dubious though. It
has previously been included within Chalcidoidea when
Mymarommatidae nests within them, and as a separate
superfamily otherwise. Its taxonomy seems phylogeny-

Davis et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:109
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/109

dependent, and results here suggest Mymarommatidae
be included in the Chalcidoidea [47]. Despite this, the
Chalcidoidea are not always recovered as monophyletic
(position of Tanaostigmatidae - Figure 4), but evidence in
input trees for this is lacking (V = 0).
The validity of Proctotrupoidea has previously been
questioned, for example in some input studies [39,41] and
through agreement in supertree analyses there may be a
case for revising their higher taxonomy. It is of interest to
see which families consistently group together as a basis
for revising the taxonomy of this group, though we do not
here suggest any specific revisions. With strong support
(V = 0.6) Proctotrupidae and Vanhorniidae are recovered
as sister groups in agreement with Castro & Dowton [91]
and Dowton & Austin [39] with Heloridae basal to this in
all analyses. Diapriidae and Monomachidae are recovered
in all analyses with reasonable support (V = 0.179), while
Roproniidae and Pelecinidae are recovered in all analyses
but with poor support (V = -0.234). This relationship is
also in agreement with Castro & Dowton [91] and Dowton & Austin [39]. These problematic relationships and
arguably a revision of "proctotrupoid" taxonomy should
be priorities for future research.
Diversification Shift Analyses

Because we have conducted the first quantitative tests of
shifts in diversification at higher taxonomic levels in
Hymenoptera, most of the inferred shifts are entirely
novel hypotheses. Two important resulting questions are:
how robust are these inferences, and what might have
caused them? Whilst our analyses can directly inform us
about the former, the phylogenetic positions of shifts
constrain their possible causes but are not themselves
hard evidence about causes: any difference between the
two clades concerned might be responsible. A particular
problem is that some ecological differences between
clades noted below, such as the taxonomic extent of hosts
and geographical distribution, might have caused shifts in
diversification or might equally well be the result of them.
Nonetheless, such differences help us to raise hypotheses
for further tests.
The deepest consistent shift in diversification we infer,
although not having the greatest effect on species richness (Table 1; for species richness calculations see additional file 9), occurs at the origin of Apocrita. The sister
pairing of Orussidae (plus Paroryssidae) and Apocrita
receives poor support like most of the nodes along the
supertree backbone, but this relationship does appear in
several studies where it is often strongly supported
[33,37,42,43,92]. Where alternative sister-pairings exist
based on both morphological [30] and molecular data
[36,93] the Apocrita are still shown to be sister to another
single symphytan family and our findings are not
affected.

Page 11 of 16

Orussidae are the only carnivorous parasitic symphytans [83]. Apocritan taxa are united by the move to a
more refined carnivorous parasitic lifestyle, which probably originated out of an orussid-style life cycle. Therefore
it is possible that carnivorous parasitism is a prerequisite
for other key innovations, which are discussed below (i.e.
a case of contingent radiation [12]). Apocritan larvae
have a closed hindgut [44,94,95]. This might function to
increase assimilation of nutrients or avoid fouling the
host [95], and avoid detection by ovipositing orussids,
which use faeces to detect hosts [96]. In the adult, the
constriction between abdominal segments 1 and 2, (i.e.
the "wasp waist") is a defining feature of apocritan taxa
[44,49,94]. This might function to facilitate oviposition or
improve flight [48]. Furthermore, Sharkey [44] suggests
that the variety of ovipositor morphologies has had a key
role in facilitating the diversity of apocritan species and
may represent an adaptive radiation towards using a
range of host species.
We observe a positive shift in diversification the
Vespoidea (Table 1) to the exclusion of Sierolomorphidae
in both MRC trees despite different proposed sister
groups (either Sierolomorphidae (10 species) or
Apoidea). The shift detected could have led to the origin
of over 40,000 species had negative shifts in diversification further up the tree not occurred (where these are
detected depends on the phylogeny used). Though a sister relationship with Apoidea gains greater support, the
size of the potential shift in diversification is greater when
Sierolomorphidae are the sister group (p = 0.0004 in contrast to 0.0146). The other Vespoidea differ from Sierolomorphidae in a few anatomical features, though they lack
the constriction observed in other Vespoidea (except
Pompilidae) between the second and third abdominal
segments [48,49]. This extra vespoid constriction may act
to enhance any dexterity conferred by the apocritan
"wasp waist" in an example of contingent radiation [12],
and could enable effective use of the sting in defence [97].
The specialised articulation between the second and
third abdominal segments is also absent from Apoidea.
The Anthophila (bees) and Sphecidae, together containing over 21,500 species, form a well-supported clade
(V = 0.467) and together represent a positive shift in
diversification. The taxonomy used here [47] includes
sphecid subfamilies which have family status elsewhere
(e.g. Crabronidae, Pemphredonidae, Astatidae). Even
when the species numbers, which these families contribute to our Sphecidae, are removed (a ten-fold reduction),
this positive shift is still observed. In a similar, but less
drastic, manner to that observed in Vespoidea, the potential number of species we might have expected from this
shift could be greater (another potential 2,000 species)
had negative shifts in diversification further up the tree
not occurred. Their sister group Heterogynaidae (well

Davis et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:109
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/109

supported, V = 0.467) constitutes just five species and is
poorly known. While heterogynaid females are brachypterous (i.e. have reduced, non-functional wings)
[49,98] those of the Sphecidae and the bees are not
[48,49]. Reduced wings may result in reduced dispersal.
Heterogynaidae species are found only from Madagascar
to the Mediterranean [98], whereas bees and sphecids
have a wider distribution [49]. Furthermore, adult sphecids feed at flowers as do all bees, but whilst larvae of bees
are also phytophagous, the larvae of sphecids retain a carnivorous habit [99]. A move towards an association with
angiosperms has been cited as a reason for insect diversification in similar studies on other groups [17,19,20].
The Bethylidae and Chrysididae are a fairly well-supported sister pairing (V = 0.111) and combined have
experienced a significant positive shift in diversification
compared to their sister group of Sclerogibbidae, Dryinidae and Embolemidae (Table 1). The monophyly of these
five families is not well-supported (V = -0.091, but V+ =
0.333), but these taxa are sometimes in polytomies
[32,34], and Bethylidae and Chrysididae appear in trees
that do not include the other families and are consequently shown to be sister to alternative families
[100,101]. Bethylids are parasitoids of Lepidoptera and
Coleoptera, while chrysidids are parasitoids primarily of
other Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera. These host groups
are themselves extremely speciose, compared to the host
groups of Sclerogibbidae (Embioptera hosts), Dryinidae
and Embolemidae (both Homoptera hosts) [48,49].
A significant positive shift is observed in the Dryinidae
compared to their sister family Embolemidae (Table 1), a
sister pairing that receives strong support (V = 0.667).
Most dryinids possess an enlarged claw on the female
protarsus, which could confer increase raptorial ability,
consequently enhancing capacity for parasitisation
[49,102]. The host groups of Dryinidae are two large
superfamilies of Hemiptera (Cicadelloidea and Fulgoroidea) [48], making their potential ecological niche broad.
The Proctotrupidae (310 species) are a positive radiation relative to their sister group Vanhorniidae (5 species), a sister pairing with good support. The
Vanhorniidae are parasites on just one particular
coleopteran family - Eucnemidae (1100 species [47]),
while the Proctotrupidae parasitise members of the Diptera and Coleoptera [48] including two of the largest
coleopteran families Carabidae (20,000 species) and
Staphylinidae (32,000 species - [47]).
The only significant negative shift occurring within the
Apocrita concerns the family Stenotritidae (Table 1). This
family is sister to Colletidae (V = 0.5). While Colletidae
(comprising 2,000 species) has a wide distribution
through the southern hemisphere (with genera Colletes
and Hylaeus wider still [103]), Stenotritidae is found
solely in Australia [49].

Page 12 of 16

Three symphytan families have likely undergone significant negative shifts in diversification. The Anaxyelidae
comprises just one modern species (Syntexis libocedrii)
surviving from a previously larger Mesozoic/Cenozoic
group [104]. It is sister to Siricidae (V = -0.270 but V+ =
0.316). Syntexis libocedrii has a very specialised lifestyle,
where the female oviposits only into recently burnt or still
burning cedar wood specifically [105]. The Blasticotomidae, comprising 9 species, also occupies a specialist
niche. Blasticotomidae larvae exhibit a phloem-feeding
strategy known as "phloemining", which is unique
amongst modern families. This habit may have been
more widespread previously within tenthredinoid families [106]. They are strongly supported as sister to the
other Tenthredinoidea (either including or excluding the
extinct family Xyelotomidae), which comprises over 7,500
species (V = 0.556 or 0.569 respectively).
The Xyelidae may also represent a significant negative
shift in diversification away from the other Hymenoptera
(over 190,000 species). How large this shift is inferred to
be depends on the phylogeny studied, and therefore the
shifts in diversification detected and adjusted for further
up the tree. They are a relict family containing now just
46 species dating back to the Triassic. Carpenter [107]
reports 36 fossil genera compared to the current five.
Other relict groups are often inferred to have lost original
niche space over time [108] or to have been hindered in
further diversification by the radiation of more derived
taxa [109]. In the compartmentalised MRC analysis, a
positive shift is also detected in the remaining
Hymenoptera. If this inference is true, it could be in part
due to competitive replacement of Xyelidae. It is notable
that there are no positive shifts in diversification detected
amongst symphytan taxa, in contrast to the Apocrita.
In addition to the above shifts in diversification, which
are all in one direction, there are six two-way shifts identified common to both MRC trees, where both sister taxa
have shifted in opposite directions leading to a significant
difference in species richness (Table 1). All occur at tipward nodes within Apocrita. Only one relationship of
these six is dubious (Ormyridae v Agaonidae + Mymaridae + Signiphoridae + Mymarommatidae + Aphelinidae
+ Trichogrammatidae (V = -0.667)). Within this group,
there is a two-way shift between Mymarommatidae and
Trichogrammatidae + Aphelinidae. Mymarommatidae
are globally distributed, but little is known of their biology [49]. Trichogrammatidae and Aphelinidae are egg
parasites of taxonomically diverse insect groups including Lepidoptera and some Hemiptera. Similarly, Mutillidae use speciose host groups, while their sister group
Sapygidae have a specialist cleptoparasitic lifestyle.
Another positive shift is that of the gall-forming Cynipidae, compared to the negative shift in their sister group
Ibaliidae, which are parasites of the species-poor Siri-

Davis et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:109

coidea [49]. The other two two-way shifts in diversification both occur in Apoidea. A negative shift in Oxaeidae,
a geographically restricted group [110] occurs opposite a
positive shift in Adrenidae, which have a wider distribution. Lastly, a negative shift in Melittidae occurs against a
positive shift in Anthophoridae + Apidae + Megachilidae.
Melittidae are oligolectic, feeding on a narrow range of
host plants [111], and the other families comprise the
long-tongued bees, which may represent an adaptive
radiation to feed on flowers with more complex structures [112].
Some further shifts in diversification were inferred in
the all-in analysis (Figure 4) but not the compartmentalized one, hence are more tentative. The Ichneumonoidea
make up 100,000 species in a possible positive shift. This
superfamily displays a number of innovations relating to
parasitism (e.g. ovipositor steering mechanisms, polydnaviruses etc [113]). In the compartmentalised tree the Ichneumonoidea fall within a larger clade representing a
positive shift. Other positive shifts in diversification are
in large, but poorly supported groups with no obvious
connection. Negative shifts in diversification may have
occurred in Pterygophoridae and Monomachidae, which
have restricted geography [49,114], and also in the poorly
known Rhopalosomatidae and Bradynobaenidae.

Conclusions
This study provides the most comprehensive phylogenetic framework of Hymenoptera to date with which to
test evolutionary hypotheses. Such large-scale phylogenies must be regarded as work in progress since there are
inevitably many topological uncertainties. With the current evidence we identify many shifts in diversification
robustly, which have shaped the evolution of the group,
from suborder, through superfamily, to family-level
clades. The location of other shifts in diversification is
hard to place given current phylogenetic uncertainty. Our
findings support other large phylogenetic studies suggesting that the origin of species richness in large clades (such
as beetles and angiosperms, and insects as a whole) are
due to multiple smaller adaptive radiations with possibly
diverse independent causes [13-15,21]. Thus, there has
been much heterogeneity in net rate of change in species
richness within Hymenoptera, without which their richness would certainly have been considerably lower, but
also might in places have been higher. Notable differences
between the clades involved often include morphological
innovations in one of the groups, but also differences in
host groups and geographic distribution, and these suggest causal hypotheses for future microevolutionary studies on speciation and extinction processes. Our tree
provides a benchmark against which future large scale
hymenopteran phylogenies can be evaluated.
