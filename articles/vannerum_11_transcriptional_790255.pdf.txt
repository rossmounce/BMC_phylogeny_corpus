Abstract
Background: Streptophyte green algae share several characteristics of cell growth and cell wall formation with
their relatives, the embryophytic land plants. The multilobed cell wall of Micrasterias denticulata that rebuilds
symmetrically after cell division and consists of pectin and cellulose, makes this unicellular streptophyte alga an
interesting model system to study the molecular controls on cell shape and cell wall formation in green plants.
Results: Genome-wide transcript expression profiling of synchronously growing cells identified 107 genes of which
the expression correlated with the growth phase. Four transcripts showed high similarity to expansins that had not
been examined previously in green algae. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that these genes are most closely related
to the plant EXPANSIN A family, although their domain organization is very divergent. A GFP-tagged version of the
expansin-resembling protein MdEXP2 localized to the cell wall and in Golgi-derived vesicles. Overexpression
phenotypes ranged from lobe elongation to loss of growth polarity and planarity. These results indicate that
MdEXP2 can alter the cell wall structure and, thus, might have a function related to that of land plant expansins
during cell morphogenesis.
Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the potential of M. denticulata as a unicellular model system, in which cell
growth mechanisms have been discovered similar to those in land plants. Additionally, evidence is provided that
the evolutionary origins of many cell wall components and regulatory genes in embryophytes precede the
colonization of land.

Background
Although the form and function of plant cells are
strongly correlated, the processes that determine the cell
shape remain largely unknown. Plant cell morphogenesis
is regulated in a non-cell-autonomous fashion by the
surrounding tissues [1], hormone interference during
ontogenesis, and sometimes by polyploidy as a consequence of endoreduplication [2,3]. In contrast, in unicellular relatives of land plants, it is possible to study the
endogenous controls of cell morphogenesis without the
interference by interacting cells and to better

understand how these mechanisms have evolved in the
green lineage.
The desmid Micrasterias denticulata is a member of
the conjugating green algae (Zygnematophyceae) that
comprise the closest extant unicellular relatives of land
plants [4-8]. M. denticulata cells consist of two bilaterally symmetrical flat semicells, notched deeply around
their perimeter into one polar lobe and four main lateral
lobes. Following cell division, each semicell builds a new
one through a process of septum bulging and symmetrical local growth cessations to form the successive lobes
(Figure 1A). After completion of the primary wall (during the doublet stage), a rigid cellulosic secondary cell
wall pierced by pores is deposited, followed by shedding
of it. This peculiar growth mechanism makes

Micrasterias an ideal model to study the spatial and
temporal patterning of cell wall biogenesis [9].
Ultimately, the plant cell morphology is determined by
the composition and structure of the cell wall that governs the cell expansion direction and rate. As in land
plants, the primary cell wall of M. denticulata Bréb.

consists mainly of pectins [10,11], cellulose microfibrils
[12], hemicelluloses [13] and arabinogalactan proteins
(AGPs) [10,13]. The secondary cell wall owes it rigidness
to cellulose microfibrils originating from rosettes organized as hexagonal arrays [14,15], whereas mixed-linked
glucan is the dominant hemicellulose [13].

In land plants, expansins are important regulators of
turgor-driven cell wall expansion. These cell wall proteins comprise a large multigene superfamily consisting
of four families (EXPA, EXPB, EXLA and EXLB) of
which the evolutionary relationships are well characterized [16,17]. They are unique in their ability to loosen
the cell wall non-enzymatically by disrupting hydrogen
bonds that link the cellulose and hemicellulose wall
components [18-21]. Land plant expansins consist of
two domains and a secretion signal. The N-terminal
expansin domain 1 and the C-terminal expansin domain
2 are homologous to the catalytic domain of glycoside
hydrolase family 45 (GH45) proteins and a domain present in a family of grass pollen allergens, identified as a
putative cellulose binding site [22], respectively. Expansins play a role in tissue development [23,24] and in
growth of suspension-cultured cells [25,26]. Although
genes encoding expansin-like proteins have been
recently identified in green algae transcriptomes [27],
their physiological function and phylogenetic relationships with land plant expansins remain unknown.
Here, we explore the molecular basis of cell morphogenesis and cell wall formation in synchronized M. denticulata cells by means of a cDNA-amplified fragment
length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP)-based quantitative
transcriptome analysis [28]. Several cell wall-related
genes, among which expansins, were identified. Examination of the expansins provided the first structural,
phylogenetic and functional data on green algal homologues within this gene family.

Results
cDNA-AFLP expression profiling

First we developed a synchronization protocol to monitor the cell morphogenesis-related gene expression in
M. denticulata. The protocol was based on the observation that the majority of the cells grown in a 14-h light/
10-h dark regime divided during the second dark period,
after the growth medium of a stationary culture
(obtained after 3-4 weeks) had been refreshed and, concomitantly, the cell density reduced at the start of the
light period. Replacing the dark period by a light period
enhanced the amount of synchronically dividing cells
(Figure 1B). The effect of cell density on synchronization
was significant (GLM; F-test; P < 0.001), with an optimal
cell density below 80 cells mL-1. Following synchronization, up to 85% of the cell population divided during an
8- to 9-h period, showing a sigmoid course (Figure 1C,
D; Additional file 1). By sampling this period at five
consecutive time points we obtained samples with different proportions of cells at the major morphogenetic
stages (Figure 1A,C,D). cDNA-AFLP expression profiling
of these samples allowed the assignment of differentially

expressed genes to either the onset of cell division (Figure 1A2; Figure 2 (C1a and C1b)), the bulge (Figure
1A3; Figure 2 (C2)), the lobe (Figure. 1A4-A9; Figure 2
(C3)), or the doublet stage, during which the secondary
cell wall is formed (Figure 2 (C4 and C5)). In total, the
relative abundance was monitored of 4574 transcriptderived fragments (TDFs) during the cell growth of M.
denticulata (Figure 3, Additional file 2), for which the
expression patterns were altered visibly across time in
1420 and significantly (P<0.009; Q<0.05) in 476 TDFs.
According to other studies [29,30], we estimate that
two-thirds of the mRNA population was sampled,
implying that the real number of genes differentially
expressed during cell growth of M. denticulata could be
~2100. A high similarity (E-value < 1.E-01 and similarity
>50%) to database entries with assigned identities and
unknown or hypothetical genes was found for 107 and
22 TDFs, respectively, mostly with Embryophytes and
not with Chlorophyta. However, the majority of the
TDFs (324 or 71.5%) showed no sequence similarity to
any database entry (Figure 3; Additional file 3). Plausible
explanations might be sequences too short to reveal any
significant identity, short sequences representing nonconserved portions of genes, TDFs originating from the
3’-untranslated region of a gene, or TDFs representing
genes specific to M. denticulata or streptophytic algae.
Of the 129 annotated genes, 118 clustered into six groups
(designated C1a, C1b, C2, C3, C4, and C5) (Figure 2)
according to the timing of their highest expression (Figure
1C,D). Except for one cluster consisting of six genes (cluster C1b; Figure 2), the expression profiles were reproducible in the two independent sampling series. The few genes
not included in one of the described clusters typically
showed narrow temporal expression patterns.
Based on their annotation, the TDFs were classified
into 14 functional categories, named according to the
Gene Ontology terminology (http://www.geneontology.
org) (Figure 3; Additional file 3). The association
between the functional category and the TDF clustering
was not significant (c2 test; p = 0.070). The major group
with a significant hit was involved in cell wall metabolism. The second largest category corresponded to
sequences sharing significant similarity to unknown or
hypothetical proteins.
Of 18 TDFs with similarity to genes involved in cell
wall biogenesis or cell pattern formation, the RNA samples of the second cDNA-AFLP replication series and
on an independently sampled series (Additional file 1)
were analyzed by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription (qRT)-PCR. In general, the expression profiles
obtained by cDNA-AFLP and qRT-PCR (Additional file
4) corresponded well (Additional file 5), confirming the
obtained expression results.

In total, 4574 TDFs were scored, of which 2481 were constitutively
expressed, 673 only in stationary cultures and 1420 displayed
altered expression patterns across time (476 significantly; P < 0.009;

non-redundant sequences, 129 could be annotated. (B) Functional
classification of the 129 annotated transcript-derived fragments

Genes relevant for cell pattern formation

Seven TDFs could be identified that might be relevant for
cell pattern formation in M. denticulata, among which
two members of the Rab GTPase cycle and two members
of the SNARE cycle of membrane fusion reactions. Rab8,
similar to Md1852, is known to be involved in post-Golgi
transport to the plasma membrane, inducing the formation of new surface extensions and believed to be regulated by a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor [31]
possibly corresponding to Md0818. Both Md1852 and
Md0818 belonged to cluster C1a and, thus, had increased
mRNA levels before the onset of mitosis. This observation might be related to the determination of the basic
symmetry of a M. denticulata cell before mitosis, indicated by the development of a three-lobed semicell after
removal of the nucleus [32]. In contrast, the SNARE
cycle members were highly expressed in cluster C3,
pointing to a role in further differentiation during the

lobe stages for Md1404 (similar to plant syntaxin 32) and
Md1560 (similar to a regulatory AAA-type of ATPase).
Two TDFs were identified encoding putative glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors: Md4071 and
Md4341, belonging to clusters C1a, and C4, respectively.
Among other properties, the function of a GPI anchor
might be its dominant targeting to a specific membrane
domain [33], possibly establishing a membrane template
for morphogenesis. Md4341 turned out to be a 179amino-acid protein containing a signal peptide and a
fasciclin domain (a putative cell adhesion domain) (Evalue 2.9E-07), with similarity to a fasciclin-like and an
AGP-like protein from Brachypodium sylvaticum
[CAJ26371.1] and Arabidopsis thaliana [AAM62616.1],
respectively (Additional file 6).
Md3533 (cluster C3), similar to a very-long-chain fatty
acid-condensing enzyme, might be involved in morphogenesis in accordance to the essential role in cell expansion during plant morphogenesis of Arabidopsis [34].

(C3), MdEXP1 and MdEXP2 were up-regulated during
later stages (C4) (Figure 4). Changes in the internal
structure of the cell walls, required for cell expansion,
might be achieved by the release of hydroxyl radicals
mediated by the class-III peroxidases Md0434 and
Md0493. Peroxidase-generated hydroxyl radicals could
cause non-enzymatic wall loosening by cleavage of various polysaccharides [40]. The ORF of Md0434 contained a secretion signal peptide and a Pfam peroxidase
domain (E-value 2.50E-97) (Additional file 8). The H2O2
substrate for the peroxidase activity was probably generated by the glyoxal oxidases Md0606, Md1709, and
Md3495. Hydrolytic enzymes included the pectinesterase
Md4415, the endo-b-1,6-galactanase Md1480, and two
members of cluster C5: the polygalacturonidase Md3500
and the b-glucosidase Md0559, possibly involved in
degradation of a connecting zone between the primary
and the secondary cell wall, thereby enabling shedding
of the primary cell wall [41].

Genes involved in cell wall metabolism

Phylogenetic relationship of M. denticulata expansinresembling proteins

As the involvement of expansins in cell growth of green
algae had not been examined previously, we concentrated
the experiments on this class of proteins. The full length
characteristics of the M. denticulata expansin-resembling
proteins (MdEXPs) are given in Additional file 9.
MdEXP1 and MdEXP4 exhibited the highest sequence
similarity (74% identity, 84% similarity) (Figure 5).
Phylogenetic analysis of the first dataset revealed that all
MdEXPs were recovered as a monophyletic group with
high support (BV = 99, PP = 1.00) (Figure 6A). The

A total of 30 cell wall-related genes were identified. Six
TDFs operating in the monosaccharide metabolism,
evenly distributed over C1 and C3, could be identified
as UDP-pyrophosphorylases (Md1739, Md2333, and
Md2565), a phosphoglucomutase (Md2842), a rhamnose
synthase (Md1089), and a GDP-mannose 3,5-epimerase
(Md3053). Nine polysaccharide synthesis enzymes all
nearly clustered in C3, among which two cellulose
synthases, Md0757 (see also [35]) and Md3668, and one
cellulose synthase-like (CSL) gene of the CSLC family,
Md2838. The exostosin family glycosyltransferases
Md0450, Md1114, Md2144, and the glycosyltransferase
Md0257 might synthesize the hemicellulosic or pectinous part of the cell wall and mucilage as well that is
pectic in nature [11] and secreted simultaneously with
cell wall material during cell growth [36]. Md3598 was
the a-1,6-xylosyltransferase, typical of the hemicellulose
biosynthetic pathway, whereas Md0888 was the xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase (XET/XTH) that is a
xyloglucan-modifying enzyme. The open reading frame
(ORF) of Md0888 encoded a 277-amino-acid protein
with a signal peptide and a GH16-XET domain (E-value
6.10E-37) and therefore designated MdXTH1. The catalytic site DEIDFEFLG, conserved among GH16 family
members [37] and most seed plant XTHs [38] was present in MdXTH1 as xExDxEFxG and immediately followed by a potential N-glycosylation site NxT/S [39]
(Additional file 7). The other 15 identified TDFs were
involved in wall assembly, reorganization, and selective
degradation. Four of them gave significant hits with
expansins: MdEXP1 (C4), MdEXP2 (C4), MdEXP3 (C3),
and MdEXP4 (C3). Whereas MdEXP4 and MdEXP3
were expressed during the early morphogenetic stages

acid sequence of the M. denticulata expansin-resembling proteins MdEXP2, MdEXP1, MdEXP4, and MdEXP3 with the Arabidopsis thaliana EXPA1
[NP_001117573] and EXPB1 [NP_179668]. The C-terminal extension of MdEXP2 is omitted (see Additional file 11). Dark-shaded white characters
represent N-terminal sorting signals. Dark gray and white boxes below the alignment indicate the expansin domains 1 and 2, respectively.
Conserved Cys (C) and Trp (W) residues are indicated above the alignment. The key residues of the GH45 catalytic site that are conserved in
domain 1 of the EXPA and EXPB expansin families are shown in bold. Conserved expansin residues and motifs are lightly shaded. Asterisks mark
identical residues; colons and periods indicate full conservation of strong and weak groups, respectively.

Micrasterias and Spirogyra sequences fell within the
plant expansins and were most closely related to the
EXPA family, with which they formed a well supported
clade (BV = 86, PP = 1.00). The MdEXPs are recovered
sister to the EXPA clade and the Spirogyra sequences
form a paraphyletic assemblage, but the relationships
between the Micrasterias and Spirogyra expansins and
the EXPA clade are poorly supported. The high
sequence divergence of expansins within and among
Micrasterias and Spirogyra is shown by the relatively
longer branches than those within the EXPA clade. In
the second dataset, the putative expansin sequences of
Chlorophyta formed a highly divergent clade, separated
from the plant expansins by a very long branch (Additional file 10). Although the relationships between the
Chlorophyta clade, the Dictyostelium clade and the plant
expansin families were poorly resolved, the phylogenetic
position of the Micrasterias clade, closely allied to the
EXPA family, was well supported.

Domain organization of the M. denticulata expansinresembling proteins

The structural domain organization of the different
MdEXPs was compared with the characteristic structural
features of plant expansins (Table 1, Figure 5, Figure 7).
A secretion signal peptide was present in all of them
(Figure 5, Figure 7, Table 1). While the pollen-allerg-1
domain occurred in all proteins, except MdEXP4, the
GH45 domain was found in MdEXP2 and MdEXP3
only, albeit with insignificant E-values. Nevertheless, in
all sequences, a DPBB-1 domain was present, a rare
lipoprotein A-like double-psi beta-barrel, to which
GH45 belongs, and even twice in MdEXP2 (Additional
file 11). The eight cystenyl residues forming disulfide
bridges in fungal GH45 enzymes and maintaining their
folded structure [16] were conserved in the expansin
domain 1 of some of the plant expansin groups [22] and
also in the MdEXPs (Figure 5). In M. denticulata, the
GGACGY motif was present as GGSCGY/F, whereas

plant expansins, the pollen-allergen domain contains
four conserved tryptophan residues that form part of
the hydrophobic core of this domain [42] (Figure 5). In
the MdEXPs up to two of these residues occurred and
were fully conserved, when the structurally related

account (Figure 5, Table 1). Although the highly conserved HATFYG motif near the N-terminus is characteristic of EXPA proteins [22], this motif could not be
found in the MdEXPs. The EXPA and EXPB proteins
were distinguished by the presence or absence of short
stretches of amino acids at conserved positions at either
side of the HFDL motif in the GH45 active site (a- and
b-insertions) [16,43]. According to the phylogeny, the
MdEXPs contained an a-insertion characteristic of
EXPAs, but they lacked the four highly conserved Nterminal residues ‘GWCN’ found in other EXPAs [16].
Of the HFDL motif, only the leucine residue was conserved (Figure 5). However, the long C-terminal extension of MdEXP2 was typical for EXLA proteins [22].
Although MdEXPs were heterogeneous and divergent,
they clearly shared several characteristics of the EXPA
protein domains, supporting our phylogenetic results.

Subcellular localization of the expansin-resembling
MdEXP2 and phenotypic changes due to its
overexpression

The ORF of the M. denticulata expansin-resembling
protein with the highest mRNA levels during cell
growth, namely MdEXP2, was cloned into an overexpression vector to allow C-terminal fusions to the green
fluorescence protein (GFP) [35]. As observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy of transiently MdEXP2GFP-overexpressing interphase cells, the MdEXP2-GFP
fluorescence occurred as motile cytoplasmic dots (Figure
8; Additional file 12) but could not be observed in the
secondary cell wall itself, probably because of quenching
due to a low apoplast pH [44]. Therefore, MdEXP2-

GFP-overexpressing interphase cells were processed for
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and stained
with GFP antibodies and protein A-gold to investigate
whether the MdEXP2-GFP protein localizes into the
secondary cell wall. Indeed, a positive signal was
observed in the secondary cell wall, albeit not abundantly (Figure 9A,B), probably due to the instability of
the GFP protein in this acid compartment [44]. In addition, mucilage vesicles still attached to distal Golgi cisternae (Figure 10A) and some released from the
dictyosome (Figure 10C,D) were stained. This immunogold labelling indicated that the punctate pattern of the
GFP fluorescence (Figure 8A) could correspond to
Golgi-derived mucilage vesicles and that the fusion protein was directed to the wall via the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi secretory pathway. No staining was observed
in experiments for specificity control consisting of sections treated with protein A-gold alone (Figure 10B). In
control sections of transgenic cells producing the free
GFP, labelling occurred in the cytoplasm and was absent
from the cell wall and cell organelles (Figure 9C,D).
Next, 26 independent transient transgenic cells were isolated and further analysed (Additional file 13). A group
of cells lost the GFP-fluorescence within a few days and

divided, resulting in normal daughter cells, while the
majority of the cells died, possibly because of strong
MdEXP2 overexpression as indicated by their bright
GFP fluorescence. However, in eight independent cell
lines, a range of phenotypes related to MdEXP2 overexpression during cell division and growth could be
observed. Line 11 exhibited strong lobe elongation without loss of growth polarity after the first cell division
(Figure 8B). The lobes were stretched and rounded
instead of flattened at their tips. After the second cell
division of line 11 and in all other cases (lines 6, 7, 8,
12, 13, 18, 19), the growth polarity was altered. Line 13
lost its planarity upon cell division and, thus, had the
most severe phenotype. New semicells, without the
characteristically lobed morphology, but almost without
indentations, grew out three-dimensionally. Upon a new
cell division of one of the daughter cells, the same phenotype was observed, whereas the newly formed semicells were also fused with each other (Figure 8F-I). In
lines 6, 7, 8, 11 (from the second cell division onwards),
12, 18, and 19 axial but not radial elongation was
impaired, resulting in semicells with a stunted polar
lobe and fused lateral lobes (Figure 8C-E). Sometimes,
the second division gave rise to a similar morphology

(Figure 8D), but in most cases the phenotype was lost
over one to two subsequent generations (Figure 8C).
That all phenotypes still had the GFP signal and none
of them resulted from control experiments with transgenic cells expressing only the GFP [35] suggests that
they were related to the expression of the transgene.

Discussion
Genome-wide expression analysis revealed a role for Rab
and SNARE cycles in membrane fusions and for AGP-like
proteins in cell pattern establishment. AGPs, differing in
composition from land plants, had recently been found to
be present in the growing primary cell wall of Micrasterias

[13]. Our analysis further suggests an involvement of classIII peroxidases, XTH and expansins in cell wall growth.
Class-III peroxidases had been considered absent in green
algae [45], although a (partial) mRNA occurred in the desmid Closterium [46]. Here, a full length algal class-III peroxidase is linked to cell growth. Furthermore, despite their

supposed lack of xyloglucans [47], XET activity was found
in the streptophyte Chara and the chlorophyte Ulva [48].
Recently, the (1®3, 1®4)-b-glucan (mixed linked glucan,
MLG) has been determined as the main constituent of the
secondary cell wall of Micrasterias [13] and in this study,
the first algal XTH was identified.

The green algae Valonia (Chlorophyta) and Nitella
(Streptophyta) exhibit acid-induced wall extension, but
this response is seemingly not mediated by proteins
[49,50]. Contrary to the assumption of a land plant specific mechanism [20], four genes with significant similarity to expansins were up-regulated during cell growth of
Micrasterias, in agreement with a presumed ancient
evolutionary origin [16]. Based on significant BLAST
similarities with the expansin domains [22], global pairwise alignment and phylogeny, and structural features
like the presence of a secretion signal, MdEXP2,
MdEXP1, and MdEXP3 are considered expansins, but
considerably diverge in gene architecture from embryophytic expansins, as indicated by both domain analysis
and phylogeny. These results add to the evidence that
expansins are not strongly conserved through evolution
[17]. The key residues of the GH45 domain catalytic site
and the HFDL motif, which are present in land plants
and Spirogyra, do not occur in Micrasterias. The HFDL
motif is present in most groups of plant expansins, but
is absent in a few plant EXPA and EXPB proteins [16].
The eight N-terminal cysteines required for protein
folding [16] and the four C-terminal tryptophans or
related residues involved in cellulose binding [42] are
conserved between Micrasterias, Spirogyra and land
plants and can be considered as key characteristics of
plant expansins. The GGxCGY/F and the GxxCGxCF/Y
motifs in the GH45 domain are conserved as well. The
only constant difference in the conserved amino acid
residues in Micrasterias when compared to land plants
is the occurrence of a serine residue instead of an alanine residue in the GGACGY motif of the GH45
domain. As expansins disrupt noncovalent bonding
between cellulose microfibrils and matrix glucans that
stick to the microfibril [18], we hypothesize that the
characteristics of the MdEXPs might be related to the
dominant MLG in the secondary cell walls of Micrasterias [13] instead of the (1®4)-b-glucan backbone present
in dicotyledonous plants. The occurrence of MLG in
lichens [51], fungi [52], green algae (Micrasterias) [13],
horsetails [53], and Poales [54] has been suggested to
result from convergent evolution [55], whereas the
occurrence of distinct MdEXPs might be connected to
two different (primary and secondary) cell wall types,
implied by their different temporal expression patterns.
Based on the present expansin phylogeny, combined
with current hypotheses on the evolution of the closest
relatives to land plants [6,56], expansins can fairly be
assumed to have evolved before the origin of land
plants. However, the unresolved relationships between
Embryophytes and the streptophyte lineages Zygnematophyceae, Coleochaetophyceae and Charophyceae [57]
hamper a solid reconstruction of expansin gene history.
Assuming that the Zygnematophyceae form the closest

Page 12 of 17

living relatives to land plants [8], a possible scenario
would be that expansins evolved into two lineages
(EXPA and EXPB + EXL) in a common ancestor of
Embryophytes and Zygnematophyceae (Figure 6B). The
apparent lack of EXPB and EXL in Micrasterias and
Spirogyra might be due to gene loss, early in the evolution of the Zygnematophyceae. It should be emphasized
however, that the ancient relationships among expansin
families are difficult to resolve. Therefore the phylogenetic positions of the green algal expansin-resembling
genes should be interpreted with care, hinting at a complete divergence of the plant expansin families within
the embryophytic lineage.
Distinct differences in gene architecture between
Micrasterias and embryophytic expansins have raised
the question whether the biochemical functions of
MdEXPs and embryophytic expansins are similar. To
this end, we studied functionally MdEXP2, the MdEXP
with the highest expression levels during growth,
through localization and overexpression. A GFP antibody detecting the MdEXP2-GFP fusion protein was
used, because the sequence conservation was too low
for the available plant expansin antibodies. Unfortunately, currently, because only transient genetic transformation of Micrasterias is possible [35], immunoelectron
microscopic detection in the growing cell walls is unfeasible. Nevertheless, the ectopically produced protein was
targeted to the fully-grown secondary cell wall. In addition, the phenotypic results obtained from its overexpression suggest that MdEXP2 can alter the cell wall
shape, but this effect on growth cannot be excluded to
result from saturation or blockage of the membrane
trafficking of other essential proteins. The phenotypes
were remarkably variable, whereby the phenotype severity did not seem to directly correlate with expansin
abundance (as inferred from MdEXP2-GFP fluorescence
intensity), as reported previously [58-62]. Although a
phenotype could be observed corresponding to the
expected enhanced wall extensibility due to increased
expansin levels [19], the elongation growth impaired in
most cases, but not the lateral expansion, resulting in
the fusion of the lateral lobes. A number of factors
might explain the reduced growth of tomato (Solanum
lycopersicum) overexpressing an expansin [59]. All
together, the growth phase-specific expression, the accumulation in the cell walls, and its overexpression phenotype, allow us to to hypothesize that MdEXP2 might
have a biochemical function related to that of land plant
expansins.

Conclusions
Our study provides novel data on gene expression during morphogenesis and cell growth in the desmid
Micrasterias denticulata and adds to our understanding

Vannerum et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:128
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/128

of the evolution of genes involved in cell wall formation
in green algae and land plants.
Cell walls have played crucial roles in the colonization
of land by plants [63,64]. For a detailed understanding
of how cell walls have evolved, cell wall components
and cell wall-related genes in land plants and their closest relatives, the streptophyte green algae need to be
analyzed comprehensively. Although some cell wall
components appear to be adaptations of land plants, cell
wall evolution after the colonization of land is seemingly
characterized by the elaboration of a pre-existing set of
genes and polysaccharides rather than by substantial
innovations [65-68]. The data add to the growing body
of evidence that the evolutionary origins of many cell
wall components and regulating genes in embryophytes
antedate the colonization of land.

Methods
Culture conditions, synchronization and sampling

A clonal Micrasterias denticulata culture was grown in
twofold diluted Desmidiaceae medium [69] at 23°C and
120-140 μmol photons.m-2.s-1 under a 14-h light/10-h
dark regime.
Two independent cultures were synchronized by replacing the growth medium of a stationary culture, diluting
the density, and extending the light period to 24 h. Cells
were sampled from synchronized cultures for RNA
extraction at five consecutive time points during growth
(T1 to T5) that were chosen to include for each time
point a different proportion of cells at different morphogenetic stages (bulge, lobe, and doublet stage) (Figure 1C,
D). Two independent stationary cultures served as control samples. Cells were concentrated by centrifugation
for 1 min at 4°C and 4000 rpm and washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Cell pellets were snap-frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C.
RNA extraction and cDNA-AFLP analysis

Total RNA was isolated from approximately 80,000 frozen cells at each time point as described [70] with slight
modifications. Instead of b-mercaptoethanol, 2 M stock
solution of the anti-RNase agent dithiothreitol was
added to the extraction buffer to a final concentration
of 50 mM [71]. Cells were disrupted and homogenized
in a bead mill (Retsch) (5 min at frequency 30 s-1) with
silicone-carbide sharp particles (Biospec Products) after
the cell pellet had been thawed and suspended in the
extraction buffer. Phytopure resin (GE-Healthcare) was
added during the first chloroform:isoamylalcohol extraction to eliminate mucilage contamination of the RNA
[72]. RNA samples were controlled qualitatively with the
RNA 6000 Nano kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent
Technologies) and quantified with the ND-1000 UV-Vis
Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop).

Page 13 of 17

Starting from 2 μg of total RNA, cDNA synthesis and
cDNA-AFLP analysis with BstYI and MseI as restriction
enzymes were done according to the procedures as
described [28]. For the selective amplification, BstYI +
C/T + 1/MseI + 2 primer pairs were used, resulting in
128 primer combinations. The cDNA-AFLP fingerprints
were visualized with an autoradiography platform (PhosphorImager 445 SI; Molecular Dynamics).
Scanned gel images were quantitatively analyzed with
the AFLP-QuantarPro image analysis software (Keygene
N.V.). Expression values per gene were normalized for
replicate effects by subtracting the replicate mean value
(Additional file 2). Average linkage hierarchical clustering with the TMeV v4 software (http://www.tm4.org)
and adaptive quality-based clustering (minimum two
tags in a cluster, 0.95 significance level) [73] of the normalized expression data were carried out.
To assess the effect of the various cell division stages
(T1-T5) on the gene expression during synchronized
growth, a linear regression model of the form y = μ +
rep + time + ε was fitted to the data, where y represents
the raw expression values, rep and time the fixed replicate and time effects, respectively, and ε the random
error. For all TDFs, a F-statistic was calculated, P-values
were assigned to the main term time and subsequently
transformed into false discovery rates, and Q-values [74]
(Additional file 2). Besides the TDFs with a significant
(Q<0.05) differential expression across the five time
points, TDFs that were clearly absent in the stationary
cultures but present during the synchronized growth,
were excised from the dried gels, irrespective the significance of their differential expression across the five
stages, followed by amplification and subsequent
sequencing [28].
The TDFs were designated by Md (for M. denticulata)
followed by a number corresponding to the AFLP fragment. After mutual alignment of the sequences, only the
longest one of a group of identical sequences was
retained, except when the TDFs displayed different
expression profiles. Each sequence was identified by a
similarity search against the public databases with the
Blast2GO v1.7.2 program (http://www.Blast2GO.de)
[75]. In addition to hits displaying an E-value < 1.E-03,
hits with E-values between 1.E + 00 and 1.E-03 and a
similarity > 50% were retained for further analysis.
Real-time qRT-PCR assay

Primers (Additional file 14) were designed with the Beacon Designer 7.0 (PREMIER Biosoft International) and
the Oligo PerfectTM Designer (Invitrogen). Isolated
RNA was treated with DNaseI (GE-Healthcare). An aliquot of 1 μg of total RNA from each sample was used
for cDNA synthesis. The reverse transcription was carried out with oligo-dT primers and the SuperscriptTM

Vannerum et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:128
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/128

II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
A set of reference genes was selected, based on their
constitutive expression pattern during morphogenesis,
to serve as a normalization factor in quantitative
reverse-transcription-(qRT)-PCR analysis. Their expression stability (M) was analyzed with the geNormTM
program [76]. Among 10 constitutively expressed TDFs,
Md0789 (similar to a reticulon of Arabidopsis thaliana)
and Md1473 (similar to peroxiredoxin 6 of Norway rat
[Rattus norvegicus]) (M value = 0.421 and 0.489, respectively) were the two most stably expressed genes, followed by Md0386 (similar to the unknown gene of A.
thaliana at5g13390 t22n19_40). To determine the number of internal control genes necessary for reliable data
normalization, the pairwise variation value between two
sequential normalization factors V 2/3 was calculated
with geNormTM and turned out to be 0.151 under our
experimental conditions, slightly higher than the cut-off
value of 0.15. The inclusion of a fourth internal control
gene resulted in an increase of the pairwise variation,
yielding a V3/4 value of 0.129. As a result, the use of the
two or three most stably expressed genes was considered to be sufficient for reliable data normalization [76].
PCR fragments were amplified in triplicate on the LightcyclerTM 480 (Roche Applied Science) platform with
SYBRTM Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions with
cycling conditions of 10 min preincubation at 95°C and
45 cycles at 95°C for 10 s, 58°C for 15 s, and 72°C for
15 s. Amplicon dissociation curves were recorded by
heating from 65°C to 95°C. qBaseTM [77] was used for
relative quantification.
RACE PCRs, protein domain identification, sequence
alignment and phylogenetic analyses

The ends of the cDNAs were obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCRs with plasmid DNA
from a cDNA library of growth-synchronized M. denticulata (purchased from Invitrogen) as template. For
MdEXP1, MdEXP3, and Md0434 only 5’ RACE PCR
was done, because the TDF contained the stopcodon
and a part of the 3’ untranslated region. For Md4341,
MdXTH1, MdEXP2, and MdEXP4 both 5’ RACE and 3’
RACE were necessary. Gene-specific primers were
designed with the eprimer3 program [78] and used in
combination with vector-specific (pDONR222.1) primers
(Additional file 15) in a PCR consisting of 1 min preincubation at 95°C and 30 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 54°C
for 30 s and 72°C for 2 min 30 s, followed by 1 cycle at
72°C for 5 min.
Protein domains in the ORF sequences were identified
with the SMART tool (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/)
[79,80]. Signal sequences were confirmed with the

Page 14 of 17

SignalP 3.0 Server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP) [81,82] and iPSORT prediction (http://ipsort.hgc.
jp/) [83].
Similar sequences were retrieved from GenBank
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) using protein BLAST and
tblastx [84] (Additional file 16). The sequences were
aligned using MUSCLE [85]. To remove signal peptides
and C-terminal extensions, the alignment was trimmed
from a conserved tryptophan near the N-terminus to a
conserved phenylalanine near the C-terminus [17].
Two sets of alignments were considered for the phylogenetic analyses. The first dataset consisted of the four
M. denticulata expansin-resembling proteins (MdEXPs),
26 land plant expansins representing the 17 orthologous
clades within the four land plant expansin families [22],
and six EST sequences of the streptophyte green alga
Spirogyra pratensis that showed significant similarity to
land plant expansins [27]. Five expansin-like sequences
of the social amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum, were
selected as outgroup based on their inferred relationship
with land plant expansins [16,86]. This alignment was
227 amino acids long (Additional file 17). The second
dataset included all sequences of the first alignment plus
nine putative expansin genes found in four species of
Chlorophyta (the sister clade of the Streptophyta) (322
amino acids long; Additional file 18) and was used to
assess the phylogenetic position of other putative expansin sequences of green algae.
Models of protein evolution were selected with ProtTest 1.4 [87]. Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian
phylogenetic inference (BI) were analyzed under a WAG
model of amino acid substitution with among site rate
heterogeneity (gamma distribution with eight categories)
for all datasets with PhyML v2.4.4 [88] and non-parametric bootstrapping (1000 replicates) to assess statistical support of internal branches with MrBayes 3.1.2
[89], respectively. Two parallel runs, each consisting of
four incrementally heated chains were run for 2 x106
generations, sampling every 1000 generations. Convergence of log-likelihoods was assessed in Tracer v1.4
[90]. A burn-in sample of 500 trees (well beyond the
point at which convergence of parameter estimates had
taken place) was removed before the majority rule consensus trees were constructed.
Overexpression of MdEXP2 and microscopy

The ORF of MdEXP2 was cloned into the SpeI restriction site (ACTAGT) of the vector pSA405A under the
control of the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein encoding
gene of the desmid Closterium and was C-terminally
fused to the green fluorescence protein gene (GFP) [35].
Primers were: forward primer 5’-ATGACTAGTATGAAAATCGGCATAATCCA-3’ and reverse primer 5’GGAACTAGTTAGGCACCCATTAACGGC-3’. The

Vannerum et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:128

PCR was 2 min preincubation at 94°C and 5 cycles at
94°C for 45 s, 45°C for 45 s, and 68°C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94°C for 45 s, 55°C for 45 s, and
68°C for 2 min, and by 1 cycle at 72°C for 5 min. The
recombined plasmid was introduced into M. denticulata
by microparticle bombardment [35].
For confocal microscopy, a 100M microscope (Zeiss)
was used, equipped with the LSM510 software version
3.2. Samples were scanned with a 20x (numerical aperture of 0.5) and a 63x water corrected objective (numerical aperture of 1.2). GFP fluorescence was visualized
with argon laser illumination at 488 nm and a 500 to
530 nm band emission filter.
For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), a GFP
antibody (Rb, (ab6556) Abcam) compatible protocol was
followed to prepare the samples. MdEXP2-GFP-overexpressing M. denticulata cells were embedded in a yeast
paste in a membrane carrier (Leica) and frozen immediately in a high-pressure freezer (EM PACT; Leica
Microsystems). Freeze substitution was carried out in a
Leica EM AFS instrument. Samples were infiltrated at 4°
C stepwise in LR-White, hard grade (London Resin
Company Ltd.) and embedded in capsules. Ultrathin
sections of gold interference color were cut with an EM
UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica) and collected on formvarcoated copper mesh grids. Grids were floated on blocking solution followed by incubation in a 1:25 and 1:10
dilution (in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) of primary antibodies (GFP antibody, (Rb, (ab6556) Abcam)
for 60 min. The grids were labelled with protein A-10nm gold (PAG10nm) (Cell Biology Department, Utrecht
University). Control experiments consisted of treating
sections with PAG10nm alone. Sections were poststained in an automatic contrasting instrument (EM
AC20; Leica Microsystems GmbH) for 30 min in uranyl
acetate at 20°C and for 7 min in lead stain at 20°C.
Grids were viewed with a 1010 transmission electron
microscope (JEOL) operating at 80 kV.
Newly obtained sequence data were deposited in GenBank; the transcript derived fragments under accession
numbers HE578289 to HE578716, the reference genes
under accession numbers HE580226 to HE580228, and
the open reading frames under accession numbers
HE578717 to HE578726.
