Abstract
Background: Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacteria of protists, invertebrates and
vertebrates, but have not been found to date in photosynthetic eukaryotes (algae and
embryophytes). Genes of putative chlamydial origin, however, are present in significant numbers in
sequenced genomes of photosynthetic eukaryotes. It has been suggested that such genes were
acquired by an ancient horizontal gene transfer from Chlamydiae to the ancestor of photosynthetic
eukaryotes. To further test this hypothesis, an extensive search for proteins of chlamydial origin
was performed using several recently sequenced algal genomes and EST databases, and the proteins
subjected to phylogenetic analyses.
Results: A total of 39 proteins of chlamydial origin were retrieved from the photosynthetic
eukaryotes analyzed and their identity verified through phylogenetic analyses. The distribution of
the chlamydial proteins among four groups of photosynthetic eukaryotes (Viridiplantae,
Rhodoplantae, Glaucoplantae, Bacillariophyta) was complex suggesting multiple acquisitions and
losses. Evidence is presented that all except one of the chlamydial genes originated from an ancient
endosymbiosis of a chlamydial bacterium into the ancestor of the Plantae before their divergence
into Viridiplantae, Rhodoplantae and Glaucoplantae, i.e. more than 1.1 BYA. The chlamydial
proteins subsequently spread through secondary plastid endosymbioses to other eukaryotes. Of
20 chlamydial proteins recovered from the genomes of two Bacillariophyta, 10 were of rhodoplant,
and 10 of viridiplant origin suggesting that they were acquired by two different secondary
endosymbioses. Phylogenetic analyses of concatenated sequences demonstrated that the viridiplant
secondary endosymbiosis likely occurred before the divergence of Chlorophyta and Streptophyta.
Conclusion: We identified 39 proteins of chlamydial origin in photosynthetic eukaryotes signaling
an ancient invasion of the ancestor of the Plantae by a chlamydial bacterium accompanied by
horizontal gene transfer. Subsequently, chlamydial proteins spread through secondary
endosymbioses to other eukaryotes. We conclude that intracellular chlamydiae likely persisted
throughout the early history of the Plantae donating genes to their hosts that replaced their
cyanobacterial/plastid homologs thus shaping early algal/plant evolution before they eventually
vanished.

Background
Transfer of genes between different genomes is now recognized as widespread and has been postulated to play an
important role during evolution [1,2]. Gene transfer
between different species is generally termed horizontal
gene transfer (HGT) or lateral gene transfer (LGT). HGT is
especially common in prokaryotes [1], however, it has
become recently clear it also occurs frequently in phagotrophic protists [2]. In addition, in eukaryotes a large
number of genes were transferred from the evolving plastid and mitochondrion to the nuclear genome. This type
of gene transfer has been named intracellular gene transfer
(IGT, [3]) or endocytotic gene transfer (EGT, [4]). HGT or
EGT leads to an exchange of genes between distantly
related organisms creating genetic chimeras. It allows the
recipient to acquire new characters de novo and therefore
challenges the traditional evolutionary concept that evolution proceeds by modification of existing genetic information. As is evident most clearly in EGT no gene appears
to be immune to transfer, however, most of the recently
transferred genes (HGT) appear not to include housekeeping genes [5,6]. HGT is generally detected by phylogenetic
analyses (reviewed in [7]) and is generally considered as a
form of noise, obscuring phylogenetic signal and therefore interfering with the reconstruction of the evolution or
a group of organisms [5,8]. However, Huang and Gogarten [3] suggested that ancient horizontal gene transfers are
helpful for elucidating the evolutionary history of a group
of organisms.
Chlamydiae are well known donors for horizontal gene
transfer events [9]. Chlamydiae are an ancient group of
obligate intracellular bacteria [10], probably most closely
related to the Verrucomicrobia [11]. The presence of
Chlamydia-type genes in plants (or plant-like genes in
Chlamydiae) has been reported repeatedly [12-16]. Three
different explanations have been forwarded: 1) HGT of
plant genes to a chlamydial ancestor [12], 2) HGT of
chlamydial genes to plants [15] and 3) an ancient phylogenetic relationship between Chlamydiae, Cyanobacteria,
and chloroplasts [13]. A list of chlamydial proteins with
high similarity to plant proteins by Brinkman et al. [13]
included 37 proteins involved in diverse functions such as
protein and fatty acid synthesis, glycolysis, and nucleotide
metabolism. Whereas a list by Horn et al. [14] using proteins of the Parachlamydia-related symbiont of acanthamoebae
(recently
proposed
as
Candidatus
Protochlamydia amoebophila [17]) as query in BLAST
searches found 137 proteins from Protochlamydia with
high similarity to plant proteins. Recently, a list of 14
chlamydial genes present in Viridiplantae and Cyanidioschyzon merolae (Rhodoplantae) has been published by
Huang and Gogarten [16]. These authors postulated an
ancient EGT event to explain the large number of genes
transferred [16]. Several additional genomes (including

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/203

those of two diatoms, three chlorophytes and several
additional cyanobacteria), and a large number of additional ESTs (including those of two glaucophytes and several red and green algae) have been recently sequenced.
Therefore, we have reinvestigated the phylogenetic relationships between plastids, Cyanobacteria and Chlamydiae using an extended taxon sampling. We show that 39
chlamydial type genes are present in Glaucoplantae, Rhodoplantae, Viridiplantae and Bacillariophyta indicating
an ancient origin for these chlamydial genes. However,
the distribution of chlamydial proteins among different
photoautotrophic eukaryotes is complex requiring an in
depth phylogenetic analysis.

Results
A significant number of chlamydial genes occur in
eukaryotic algae
To search for genes of putative chlamydial origin in
eukaryotic algae, the genomes of two diatoms (Thalassiosira pseudonana, Phaeodactylum tricornutum), three green
algae (Ostreococcus tauri, Ostreococcus lucimarinus,
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), and the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae were screened for the presence of proteincoding genes most similar to genes in the genome of Candidatus Protochlamydia amoebophila (see Methods). The
initial screen identified 89 putative chlamydial proteins in
these algae (Additional File 1). Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses were performed with each of the 89
proteins using a taxon sampling that included other
eukaryotic algae and chlamydiae, embryophytes, cyanobacteria, and other bacteria (an average of 30 taxa for each
protein); 37 proteins revealed a monophyletic lineage
(with 70–100% bootstrap support (BS) for 33 proteins,
and 57–68% BS for 4 proteins) consisting of chlamydiae
and at least one of the three plastid-containing eukaryotic
lineages represented by genomes (diatoms, green algae/
embryophytes, and red algae; Table 1) to the exclusion of
all other proteins. For two additional proteins (putative
glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (Fig. 1A), hypothetical protein pc0324 (no 32, Table 1)), the phylogenetic
trees contained only chlamydiae and plastid-containing
eukaryotes because proteins with significant similarities
to the chlamydial proteins could not be retrieved from
any other taxa. Among the remaining 50 phylogenetic
trees, several trees also displayed a topological sister group
relation between chlamydiae and plastid-containing
eukaryotes, however, without bootstrap support (not
shown).

The proteins of putative chlamydial origin in plastid-containing eukaryotes perform a broad spectrum of functions
with isoprenoid, fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism,
and phosphate homeostasis featuring prominently (Additional File 1). All are encoded on the host's nuclear
genome, and most (but not all, e.g. CMP-KDO syn-

thetase) are predicted to be targeted to the plastid. Metabolic pathways involving putative chlamydial proteins
reveal a chimerical origin (some genes of the plastidic isoprenoid and fatty acid biosynthesis pathways are of
cyanobacterial origin).
Complex distribution of chlamydial genes among plastidcontaining eukaryotes
The distribution of the 39 chlamydial proteins among
four groups of photosynthetic eukaryotes (Viridiplantae
(green algae and embryophytes), Rhodoplantae (red
algae), Glaucoplantae (glaucophytes), and Bacillariophyta (diatoms)) is shown in a Venn diagram (Fig. 2). The
largest number of chlamydial proteins (34) was found in
the Viridiplantae, followed by the Rhodoplantae (24),
Bacillariophyta (22) and Glaucoplantae (5). It should be
noted that the low number of chlamydial proteins recovered from the Glaucoplantae presumably relates to that
fact that no genome of this small, yet phylogenetically
important, algal lineage has been sequenced to date and
the chlamydial proteins had to be retrieved from the limited EST (cDNA) data available for two Glaucoplantae,
Cyanophora paradoxa and Glaucocystis nostochinearum. The
Viridiplantae contain the largest number of unique
chlamydial proteins (9), followed by the Bacillariophyta
(2), whereas no unique chlamydial proteins were recovered from the Rhodoplantae and Glaucoplantae.

Viridiplantae and Rhodoplantae share 21, Viridiplantae
and Bacillariophyta 17, and Rhodoplantae and Bacillariophyta 16 chlamydial proteins. Both Viridiplantae and
Rhodoplantae share the same 5 chlamydial proteins with
the Glaucoplantae (four of which are also present in the
Bacillariophyta). Seven chlamydial proteins are unique to
Viridiplantae and Rhodoplantae, 4 to Viridiplantae and
Bacillariophyta, and 3 to Rhodoplantae and Bacillariophyta. Chlamydial proteins involved in the same biosynthetic pathway may be differentially distributed in the
different algal lineages. In the plastidic isoprenoid path-

way, the chlamydial genes ispD and ispE (nos 10 and 6
respectively, Table 1) are present in the Rhodoplantae and
Viridiplantae, whereas the chlamydial ispG (gcpE; no 24,
Table 1) is only present in the Viridiplantae and Bacillariophyta; the Rhodoplantae and Glaucoplantae contain the
cyanobacterial homologue of ispG. Similarly, in the fatty
acid synthesis pathway, the chlamydial gene fabB (no 16,
Table 1) is present in both Rhodoplantae and Viridiplantae, whereas the chlamydial fabI (no 25, Table 1) is
restricted to the Viridiplantae (and Bacillariophyta and
Apicomplexa); the Rhodoplantae contain the cyanobacterial fabI. The complex distribution pattern of chlamydial
proteins in the different lineages of photosynthetic
eukaryotes called for an in depth analysis of the phylogeny of each chlamydial protein using a broader taxonomic
sampling that included diverse chlamydiae, cyanobacteria
and other groups of bacteria such as proteobacteria and
Firmicutes (representative trees in Fig. 1A–F, summary in
Table 1 and Additional File 2).
Chlamydial genes in photosynthetic eukaryotes signal an
ancient, horizontal gene transfer event
The presence of a relatively small number of genes from
another domain of life in a genome is usually regarded as
signalling horizontal gene transfer (HGT). If a large
number of foreign genes that have a single origin are
involved, an endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) is often
the favoured hypothesis. EGT is a special case of HGT, in
which the donor (endosymbiont) transfers its genome or
part of it to the acceptor (host) and physically persists for
an extended period of time within the host. If the donor
disappears from its host, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish between HGT and EGT. As HGT
involves two genomes, the direction of gene flow is not a
priori known, e.g. the presence of chlamydial proteins in
photosynthetic eukaryotes could either signal HGT from
chlamydiae to eukaryotes or HGT from eukaryotes to
chlamydiae. Phylogenetic analyses can often resolve this
conundrum. However, in photosynthetic eukaryotes an
additional level of complexity is added by the presence of
nuclear-encoded cyanobacterial genes. Since the 39
chlamydial proteins are, with a few notable exceptions
(three chlamydial genes in Dictyostelium that may have
originated by another HGT; nos 7, 27,39; Table 1), confined to plastid-containing eukaryotes, it is also conceivable that the presence of proteins of putative chlamydial
origin in these eukaryotes simply reflects their phylogenetic relationship to the respective cyanobacterial homologues rather than an HGT between chlamydiae and
eukaryotes, the former perhaps obscured by loss or modification of the respective genes in extant free-living cyanobacteria. Again phylogenetic analyses can help to reach an
informed decision. The presence of cyanobacterial genes
in the host genome has another connotation; it may indicate that HGT perhaps did not take place between the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/203

chlamydial and eukaryotic genomes directly but between
chlamydial and cyanobacterial genomes either before or
after the cyanobacterial endosymbiosis (note that the latter scenario requires the simultaneous presence of cyanobacteria and chlamydiae within the host). In this case the
chlamydial genes were transferred to the nuclear genome
by EGT from the genome of the cyanobacterial endosymbiont.
For 9 of the 39 chlamydial proteins detected in plastidcontaining eukaryotes, a cyanobacterial homologue could
not be recovered (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Analyses of the
remaining 30 chlamydial proteins revealed no specific
phylogenetic relationships of the cyanobacterial and
chlamydial proteins to the exclusion of other bacterial
homologues (e.g. Fig. 1B–F). In fact, the cyanobacterial
proteins sometimes formed strongly supported clades
with proteins of other bacteria to the exclusion of proteins
from chlamydiae (and their associated homologues in
plastid-containing eukaryotes). Often, but not always, the
cyanobacterial proteins were recovered as sisters to the
respective proteins of the Firmicutes (e.g. polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase (bootstrap support: 100/1.0
ML/PP; no 13, Table 1) and aspartate aminotransferase
(100%/1.0 ML/PP; no 2, Table 1)). The cyanobacteria/Firmicutes sister group relationship had previously been
inferred from multigene phylogenies (e.g. Battistuzzi et al.
[18] using 32 proteins (7,597 positions) from 54 different
bacterial strains)). Although this result does not rule out
an ancient relationship between cyanobacteria and
chlamydiae, it strongly suggests that the chlamydial proteins present in photosynthetic eukaryotes are not simply
modified cyanobacterial proteins and thus are not of
cyanobacterial but of chlamydial origin. That cyanobacterial homologues of chlamydial proteins can be readily
identified as such when present in photosynthetic eukaryotes, is exemplified by three proteins with differential distribution in photosynthetic eukaryotes, the cyanobacterial
homologue being associated with Glaucoplantae and/or
Rhodoplantae (nos 24, 26, 30; Table 1, Fig. 1D), while the
chlamydial homologue is present in Bacillariophyta and/
or Viridiplantae.
Phylogenetic analyses of the 39 chlamydial proteins also
provide insight about the direction of HGT between
chlamydiae and plastid-containing eukaryotes. Although
two chlamydial proteins occur only in chlamydiae and
plastid-containing eukaryotes (see above), and another
chlamydial protein (ATP/ADP translocase, no. 3, Table 1)
is present only in intracellular bacterial parasites and plastid-containing eukaryotes, all other chlamydial proteins
have homologues among several major groups of bacteria
and are thus embedded in the bacterial radiation. Conversely, the chlamydial proteins identified here are confined to plastid-containing eukaryotes among the

Page 6 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:203

eukaryote radiation (with the exception of the three
chlamydial proteins found in Dictyostelium, see above).
The presence of chlamydial genes in eukaryotes with secondary plastids (Bacillariophyta and Apicomplexa (Table
1)), and chlorarachniophytes (results not shown)) suggests that these genes have spread from Plantae (comprising Glaucoplantae, Rhodoplantae, and Viridiplantae) to
other eukaryote supergroups such as heterokonts, alveolates, and Rhizaria together with their secondary, eukaryotic endosymbionts. In conclusion, chlamydial proteins
in plastid-containing eukaryotes are most likely derived
from chlamydiae by HGT/EGT.
When and how often did HGT/EGT between chlamydiae
and plastid-containing eukaryotes occur? For chlamydial
proteins with homologues in all three lineages of the
Plantae (5 chlamydial proteins; Table 1), a sister group
relationship was recovered between chlamydiae and Plantae for each protein (e.g. Fig. 1B). This suggests that HGT
from chlamydiae to plastid-containing eukaryotes predated the divergence of the Glaucoplantae, Rhodoplantae
and Viridiplantae.
For 8 additional proteins, a sister group relationship
between chlamydiae and Rhodoplantae+Viridiplantae
was observed (with BS support ranging from 79–100%;
e.g. Fig. 1C; nos 6, 7, 10, 11, 15–18, Table 1) strongly suggesting that HGT for these proteins predated the split
between Rhodoplantae and Viridiplantae. It is anticipated
that most, if not all of these 8 proteins will also contain
homologues in the Glaucoplantae, which are, however,
currently unknown reflecting the paucity of genome information in the Glaucoplantae (see above). For another 7
chlamydial proteins in which a monophyletic origin of
chlamydiae, Rhodoplantae, and Viridiplantae was recovered (Table 1), either the branching order among chlamydiae, Rhodoplantae and Viridiplantae was unresolved (BS
support ≤ 63%; nos 9, 13, 14, 19–21; Table 1) or the (single) protein occurred only in chlamydiae and plastid-containing eukaryotes (putative glycerol-3-phosphate
acyltransferase; Fig. 1A). With the addition of more taxa,
in particular from the Glaucoplantae, the branching order
between chlamydiae and plastid-containing eukaryotes
for these 7 chlamydial proteins may be resolved and a
monophyletic origin of the chlamydial proteins in plastid-containing eukaryotes likely be revealed. Only one
chlamydial protein (putative 7-dehydrocholesterol
reductase: no 8, Table 1) deviates from this scheme (for
this protein, long branch attraction between Rhodoplantae and chlorophytes, and the absence of any bacterial
proteins other than Candidatus Protochlamydia amoebophila and Coxiella may have obscured phylogenetic relationships among taxa; Table 1).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/203

For chlamydial proteins that display a sister group relationship between chlamydiae and Viridiplantae (13 proteins; Table 1), either the homologue from Rhodoplantae
is missing (7 proteins; nos 23, 27–29, 31–33) or the Rhodoplantae homologue is specifically associated (often as a
sister group) with cyanobacteria (e.g. Fig. 1D; 6 proteins;
nos 22, 24–26, 30, 34; Table 1). The first situation may
reflect selective loss of chlamydial genes in the rhodoplant
lineage, the second offers several contrasting explanations
(see below).
Chlamydial proteins that reveal a sister group relationship
between chlamydiae and Rhodoplantae (3 proteins; Table
1) also display homologues in the Viridiplantae, whose
positions, however, remained unresolved in the phylogenetic trees (Fig. 1E; nos 35–37; Table 1).
Finally, chlamydial proteins showing a sister group relationship between chlamydiae and Bacillariophyta to the
exclusion of Plantae (putative folylpolyglutamate synthase (Fig. 1F) and transketolase; nos 38 and 39 respectively; Table 1) either contain the three lineages of Plantae
in a monophylum together with cyanobacteria (transketolase) or two lineages of Plantae (Rhodoplantae and
Viridiplantae) together with cyanobacteria, Firmicutes
and other bacteria in an unresolved radiation (Fig. 1F). It
is likely that at least the transketolase of the Bacillariophyta originated by an HGT involving a chlamydial donor
different from the donor(s) that contributed the chlamydial genes in the Plantae (see also [19]).
The overall conclusion from the phylogenetic analyses is
that the vast majority of the 39 chlamydial proteins
detected in photosynthetic eukaryotes during this study (a
minimum of 31, perhaps all, except one) presumably
entered the Plantae by HGT from chlamydiae before the
divergence of the Glaucoplantae, Rhodoplantae and
Viridiplantae.
Another important question relates to the possible nature
of the donor in the HGT/EGT of the chlamydial genes into
plastid-containing eukaryotes. For 7 chlamydial proteins,
Candidatus Protochlamydia amoebophila was the only
member of the chlamydiae in the trees; proteins from
other chlamydiae could not be retrieved from the data
bases (Fig. 1F; Table 1). The phylogenetic tree for one of
these proteins, asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (no 1; Table
1), also included all three lineages of the Plantae, and in
this case, P. amoebophila formed a weakly supported sister
group to the Plantae + Bacillariophyta (58% BS support
for Plantae + Bacillariophyta; Table 1). For the other 6
proteins, P. amoebophila was either in an unresolved position among the photosynthetic eukaryotes (3 proteins;
nos 8, 9, 20; Table 1), was the only bacterial protein in a
tree, that, in addition to P. amoebophila, comprised only

one lineage of Plantae (Viridiplantae; hypothetical protein pc0324; no 32; Table 1) or was a sister group to the
Bacillariophyta (e.g. Fig. 1F; 2 proteins; nos 36, 38; Table
1).
Four of the 5 trees that contained all three lineages of
Plantae, displayed, in addition to P. amoebophila, other
chlamydiae (Fig. 1B; nos 2–5; Table 1). In one of the 4
trees (aspartate aminotransferase; no 2; Table 1), the
chlamydiae were paraphyletic (with P. amoebophila as a
sister group to the Plantae (BS 77% for Plantae), in two
others (nos 4 and 5; Table 1) they were monophyletic,
with P. amoebophila as their first divergence, and the
chlamydiae in sister group position to the Plantae. In one
tree (ATP/ADP translocase; no 3; Table 1) relationships
among the chlamydiae were unresolved. In the 4 trees, the
chlamydiae (except P. amoebophila) exhibited relatively
long branches, and in the case of the aspartate aminotransferase, this may have caused artificial attraction of
these chlamydiae to a very long branch comprising all
other bacteria (except cyanobacteria) rendering the
chlamydiae paraphyletic (not shown).
Extending the comparison to the other 28 phylogenetic
trees that contained chlamydial proteins from both P.
amoebophila and other chlamydial taxa, again two topologies emerged: a monophyletic chlamydiae (12 proteins;
Table 1) in which P. amoebophila always represented the
first divergence within the chlamydiae (e.g. Additional
File 3D), or a paraphyletic (sometimes polyphyletic)
divergence of the chlamydiae (16 proteins; Table 1) with
P. amoebophila either in a sister group position (with or
without BS support) to the chlamydial proteins of the
plastid-containing eukaryotes (e.g. Additional File 3E; 9
proteins; nos 6, 7, 18, 22–24, 27, 31, 35), or positioned
(albeit without resolution) within the Plantae (3 proteins;
nos 12, 15, 16, Table 1). For 4 chlamydial proteins a sister
group topology between the chlamydiae (excluding P.
amoebophila) and either a single clade of plastid-containing eukaryotes (twice with Viridiplantae (nos 21, 28;
Table 1), and once with Rhodoplantae (no. 19; Table 1);
in nos 19 and 21 without bootstrap support; Table 1) or
with two clades of plastid-containing eukaryotes
(Viridiplantae and Bacillariophyta; no 26; Table 1) was
observed. In all 10 phylogenetic trees in which the
chlamydiae were paraphyletic and P. amoebophila was sister to the plastid-containing eukaryotes (see above), the
chlamydiae (excluding P. amoebophila) exhibited much
longer branches than the branches of both P. amoebophila
and the plastid-containing eukaryotes (which may have
drawn them closer to the long branches of other bacteria
or conversely resulted in short branch attraction of P.
amoebophila and the plastid-containing eukaryotes), again
likely rendering the chlamydiae paraphyletic (see above).
Support for the monophyly of the chlamydiae is strongest

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/203

(≥ 95% BS; 6 proteins; nos 13, 17, 30, 33, 37, 39) in cases
in which the branch lengths of P. amoebophila and the
other 4–8 chlamydiae are of comparable lengths (not
shown) or in which branch lengths of the plastid-containing eukaryotes and the bacteria (other than chlamydiae)
are of similar lengths (RNA delta(2)-isopentenylpyrophosphate transferase; Additional File 3B; no 4; Table 1).
When support for the monophyly of the chlamydiae was
strong (≥ 95% BS), so was support for the sister group
relationship between chlamydiae and plastid-containing
eukaryotes (BS ≥ 96%; 5 proteins; nos 4, 13, 17, 33, 37;
Table 1).
From these data it is concluded (1) that the chlamydiae
are monophyletic, (2) that the apparent paraphyly
(polyphyly) of chlamydiae seen in some trees is the result
of a long branch (or short branch) attraction artifact
because of largely differing evolutionary rates between the
genes of P. amoebophila and the later diverging intracellular chlamydial parasites of animal hosts, (3) that the later
diverging chlamydiae lost several genes that P. amoebophila (and the plastid-containing eukaryotes) retained,
(4) that the donor of the chlamydial genes found today in
the plastid-containing eukaryotes was related to the common ancestor of P. amoebophila and other chlamydiae,
and thus (5) that the HGT/EGT of chlamydial genes into
plastid-containing eukaryotes occurred more than 700
MYA, the estimated time of divergence of P.amoebophila
from other chlamydiae [14]. The apparent ancient origin
of the chlamydial genes in plastid-containing eukaryotes
is independently supported by the recovered monophyly
of five chlamydial proteins found to date in all three lineages of Plantae (with 58 – 100% BS support for the monophyly of the Plantae; Table 1). The divergence time
between Rhodoplantae and Viridiplantae has been variously estimated, based on molecular clock analyses, to be
at least 1,100 MYA [20-22].
Phylogeny of chlamydial proteins supports the monophyly
of the Plantae, but can chlamydial proteins also shed light
on subsequent algal evolution?
Because chlamydial genes apparently entered the nuclear
genome of plastid-containing eukaryotes before the divergence of the three major lineages of Plantae (see above),
their fate can be traced through algal evolution and subsequent secondary endosymbioses in much the same way as
that of plastidial proteins of cyanobacterial origin.
Whereas the monophyly of the Plantae is rarely questioned today (but see [23] and reviews by [24,25]), the
sequence of evolutionary divergence of the three principal
types of plastids that correspond to the three lineages of
Plantae, namely cyanelles (Glaucoplantae), rhodoplasts
(Rhodoplantae) and chloroplasts (Viridiplantae) still
remains unresolved. All possible topologies of the three
lineages of plastids (or the corresponding Plantae) have

Page 8 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:203

been recovered in phylogenetic analyses, i.e. a sister group
of Rhodoplantae and Viridiplantae (R+V; [26-28]), a sister
group of Glaucoplantae and Rhodoplantae (G+R;
[29,30]), or a sister group of Glaucoplantae and
Viridiplantae (G+V; [26,31-33]. Often plastid and host
trees yielded conflicting results and statistical support was
low, taxon sampling was insufficient, especially in analyses of host genes (10–16 taxa of Plantae; [33]) or apparently long-branch attraction artefacts prevailed.
Chlamydial proteins do not (yet) shed light on the
sequence of divergence of the three lineages of Plantae,
likely because too few such proteins are currently known
from the Glaucoplantae. For the 5 chlamydial proteins
present in all three lineages of the Plantae, none of the
three topologies obtained for the Plantae was significantly
supported by bootstrap values (Table 1). Two proteins
supported a G+R sister group (nos 3 and 5, Table 1),
whereas two other proteins supported a R+V sister group
(nos 2 and 4, Table 1). The fifth chlamydial protein
(Asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase, no. 1, Table 1) supported a
G+V sister group, however the Viridiplantae were paraphyletic in this analysis (Table 1). For two additional proteins, chlamydial homologues were present only in the
Viridiplantae, whereas the Glaucoplantae and Rhodoplantae contained the cyanobacterial homologues (nos
24 and 30, Table 1). The distribution of the latter two proteins among the three lineages of Plantae is most parsimoniously explained by either a G+R or R+V topology. To
further evaluate the different topologies, phylogenetic
analyses with concatenated data sets using P. amoebophila
and two other chlamydiae as outgroup were performed.
In a 4-protein analysis (aspartate aminotransferase, ATP/
ADP translocase, tRNA delta(2)-isopentenylpyrophosphate transferase and diphosphate-fructose-6-phosphate
1-phosphotransferase; nos 2–5, Table 1) using 576 aa
positions, a moderate (71%) BS support for a sister group
relationship between Rhodoplantae and Viridiplantae
(R+V) was obtained (data not shown). When more protein sequences of chlamydial origin will become available
from the Glaucoplantae, chlamydial proteins may provide a unique opportunity to address the pattern of evolutionary divergence in the three lineages of Plantae.
The complex distribution pattern of chlamydial proteins
in the plastid-containing eukaryotes in combination with
the detailed phylogenetic analyses (see above), suggest
that chlamydial proteins were differentially lost from
individual lineages of Plantae. Of the 13 chlamydial proteins recovered from Viridiplantae only, in seven cases
chlamydial homologues were absent from Rhodoplantae
suggesting that these were lost in the Rhodoplantae after
their divergence from the Viridiplantae. For two of these
proteins (nos 23 and 28, Table 1), the chlamydial homologues were also absent and thus presumably lost in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/203

chlorophyte sublineage of the Viridiplantae, perhaps indicating that these proteins perform specific functions confined to the streptophyte sublineage of the Viridiplantae.
It should be noted that taxon sampling in the Rhodoplantae was mostly limited to Cyanidioschyzon merolae and
Galdieria sulphuraria, two members of a specialized group
of thermophilic red algae with extremely small genomes
(i.e. the Cyanidiophyta). It is thus possible, although not
perhaps likely, that the absence of these chlamydial proteins may be confined to this sublineage of the Rhodoplantae and that more "typical" Rhodoplantae will be
shown to contain them. For the other 6 chlamydial proteins confined to the Viridiplantae, the Rhodoplantae
contain a cyanobacterial homologue (nos 22, 24–26, 30,
34, Table 1). This can be interpreted in different ways. It
may be argued that this is indicative of a separate origin of
chlamydial proteins in the Viridiplantae (but see results
and discussion above). Alternatively, it indicates that both
the cyanobacterial and the chlamydial homologues were
present in the ancestor of the Plantae and persisted until
after the divergence of Rhodoplantae and Viridiplantae,
when they were differentially lost (the cyanobacterial
homologue in the Viridiplantae and the chlamydial
homologue in the Rhodoplantae (and likely also in the
Glaucoplantae; nos 24 and 30, Table 1)). In case of the
phosphate transporter (no. 22, Table 1), it is likely that
the cyanobacterial homologue was lost only from the
streptophyte sublineage of the Viridiplantae as the chlorophyte sublineage contains a cyanobacterial homologue
(not shown). It is important to stress that in no case
cyanobacterial and chlamydial homologues of the same
protein have been found in a single taxon of Plantae
(Table 1) suggesting that their functions (within the plastid) are redundant and their occurrence thus mutually
exclusive. Although several different scenarios may
explain the simultaneous presence of cyanobacterial and
chlamydial homologues of a larger number of proteins
throughout the early history of the Plantae, the most intriquing is certainly the simultaneous presence of two different intracellular bacteria throughout the early history of
the Plantae, i.e. cyanobacteria and chlamydiae (see Discussion).
Origin of chlamydial proteins in the Bacillariophyta: a
hidden secondary endosymbiosis
For 22 chlamydial proteins putative homologues were
identified in the two sequenced genomes of the Bacillariophyta (Fig. 2). Two of these chlamydial proteins apparently occur exclusively in the Bacillariophyta and not in
the Plantae (nos 38 and 39, Table 1) which instead contain cyanobacterial homologues of these proteins (e.g.
Additional File 3F). Since it is well established that the
Bacillariophyta (and the heterokonts in general) obtained
their plastids through a secondary endosymbiosis involving a rhodoplant symbiont (reviews by [34-36]), either

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:203

the rhodoplant symbiont of the heterokonts still contained both homologues (which were later differentially
lost in the Rhodoplantae and the heterokonts) or, at least
in the case of transketolase (no. 39, Table 1) more likely,
the chlamydial protein was independently acquired by
HGT in the Bacillariophyta. The latter scenario is favored
for transketolase because Dictyostelium is a sister to the two
Bacillariophyta, and all three lineages of Plantae lack the
chlamydial homologue.
For the remaining 20 chlamydial proteins, the Bacillariophyta formed a sister group with either the Rhodoplantae
(10 proteins; RB clade, Table 1) or the Viridiplantae (10
proteins, VB clade; Table 1). Both topologies received similar support values, however, BS values were sometimes
low. The four chlamydial proteins that were detected in all
lineages of the Plantae, revealed exclusively an RB clade
with variable BS support (94, 66, 80 and 55% BS values;
Table 1). Of the 16 chlamydial proteins that occurred in
both Rhodoplantae and Viridiplantae, 9 were also present
in the Bacillariophyta (Fig. 2). Of those 9 proteins, one
protein (no. 10; Table 1) revealed a strongly supported RB
clade (94% BS), four proteins a VB clade (nos 6–8, 13,
supported by BS values of 68, 54, 100, and 86%, respectively; Table 1), and the remaining 4 proteins exhibited
either one or the other topology, but without BS support
(nos 9, 11, 12, 17; Table 1). Of the 13 chlamydial proteins
that were found only in the Viridiplantae, four were also
detected in the Bacillariophyta (Fig. 2), for two of which
the Bacillariophyta formed a clade with the Viridiplantae
(no. 24; 92% BS; Table 1) or a sister group with the streptophyte sublineage of the Viridiplantae (no. 26; 100% BS;
Table 1), for one protein, the VB topology was unsupported (no. 27; Table 1) and for the remaining protein,
the Bacillariophyta were sister to the Apicomplexa (no.
25; 64% BS; Table 1). All three chlamydial proteins that
were detected only in the Rhodoplantae (Fig. 2), also displayed homologues in the Bacillariophyta: for two proteins, a well-supported RB clade was recovered (nos 35
and 37; 97 and 96% BS support, respectively; Table 1), for
the third protein, the Rhodoplantae and Bacillariophyta
formed a clade that also included P. amoebophila with
100% BS support (no. 36; Table 1). It should be noted
that in two of the chlamydial proteins revealing a wellsupported RB clade (nos 3 and 35), the RB clade contained, in addition to the two Cyanidiophyta, also members of the Rhodophyta (the second major lineage of the
Rhodoplantae according to [37]).
To study the phylogeny of the chlamydial proteins from
the Bacillariophyta in more detail, unrooted maximum
likelihood phylogenetic analyses of concatenated data
sets were performed (Fig. 3). In the first analysis (Fig. 3A),
7 chlamydial proteins that individually had revealed an
RB topology (with or without BS support; nos 1–4, 10, 12,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/203

17; Table 1) were concatenated and subjected to phylogenetic analysis using 12 taxa (2675 amino acid positions;
Fig. 3A). The taxa were selected to maximize taxon congruence with the second data set of proteins displaying a VB
topology (Fig. 3B), i.e. two Bacillariophyta, the chlorophyte and streptophyte sublineages of the Viridiplantae (5
sequences), the Rhodoplantae (2 sequences, except for
no. 10 for which only one rhodoplant sequence was
recovered) and, if possible, 3 sequences of chlamydiae
were included. The RB clade was recovered with 95% BS
values (ML) and 1.0 posterior probability in the Bayesian
analysis (Fig 3A). In a second analysis (Fig. 3B), 5 chlamydial proteins that had individually revealed a VB topology
(nos 6, 7, 9, 11, 13; Table 1; it should be noted that only
protein no. 13 received BS support for a VB clade) were
concatenated and subjected to phylogenetic analyses
using the same 12 taxa as in the concatenated analysis of
the proteins with an RB topology (1736 amino acid positions; Fig 3B). In this analysis, the VB topology was
strongly supported (>95% BS values in ML and 1.0 posterior probability in the Bayesian analysis; Fig. 3B).
Although in the individual analyses of the 5 chlamydial
proteins, the position of the Bacillariophyta with respect
to the sublineages of the Viridiplantae was not resolved
and BS values for 4 of the 5 proteins were below 50%
(Table 1), the concatenated data set clearly indicated that
the 5 chlamydial proteins of the Bacillariophyta were sister to the respective proteins of the Viridiplantae, i.e. they
diverged before the split of the Viridiplantae into its chlorophyte and streptophyte sublineages (Fig. 3B).
From these data the following tentative conclusions are
drawn: (1) The Bacillariophyta obtained chlamydial genes
from two sources of photosynthetic eukaryotes, the Rhodoplantae and the Viridiplantae, (2) it is very likely that
the chlamydial proteins forming RB clades were obtained
during the secondary endosymbiosis of a rhodoplant
symbiont into a heterokont (or chromalveolate) host, (3)
there is preliminary evidence that the endosymbiosis of
the rhodoplant occurred before the Rhodoplantae
diverged into Cyanidiophyta and Rhodophyta (although
this needs to be further studied using a larger taxon sampling in the Rhodoplantae), (4) chlamydial proteins of
the Bacillariophyta forming VB clades were obtained by
HGT or EGT from a viridiplant alga before the Viridiplantae diverged into Streptophyta and Chlorophyta, (5) since
the number of chlamydial proteins forming VB clades in
the Bacillariophyta found so far is roughly equivalent to
the number of chlamydial proteins forming RB clades, it
is suspected that EGT rather than HGT was the source of
the viridiplant genes, the endosymbiont (or its plastid)
being no longer present in extant heterokonts (or chromalveolates), (6) it cannot currently be decided which of the
two secondary endosymbioses preceded the other. If the
above conclusions are valid, the two secondary endosym-

bioses may have taken place during the same time period.
Two chlamydial proteins involved in essential plastidic
pathways (fatty acid biosynthesis, FABI; isoprenoid biosynthesis, ISPG; nos 24 and 25, Table 1) occur in the Bacillariophyta and Viridiplantae, but not in the Rhodoplantae
(both Cyanidiophyta and Rhodophyta; tree not shown),
which harbor the cyanobacterial homologues (Table 1).
For ISPG, two Glaucoplantae also contain the cyanobacterial homologue. If the rhodoplant symbiont of the Bacillariophyta also contained the cyanobacterial homologues
(the most parsimonious scenario), the latter must have
been replaced in the Bacillariophyta by the chlamydial
homologue from the viridiplant symbiont, requiring the
simultaneous presence of both eukaryotic symbionts in
the host.

Discussion
Chlamydiae are a group of obligate intracellular bacteria
that are well-known pathogens of animals and humans
and have been studied for decades [38,39]. More recently,
a large diversity of previously unrecognized chlamydiae
was discovered in the environment (e.g. [40-42]), where
they have been found in intracellular associations with
diverse eukaryotic hosts ranging from amoebae to invertebrates. Phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses of
chlamydiae indicated that "environmental chlamydiae"
represent a sister group of present-day chlamydiae pathogenic in animals, that separated from their common
ancestor more than 700 million years ago [14], suggesting
that the ancestor already lived intracellularly in eukaryotes. Recently, the Verrucomicrobia, which have been estimated to comprise up to 10% of the soil bacterial flora
and have also been found in aquatic systems including
lakes, marine sediments and hot springs but also live associated with eukaryotes, were identified as the closest
known free-living relatives of chlamydiae [11,43].
While chlamydiae are obligate intracellular pathogens/
symbionts in many eukaryotes, they have not been discovered to date in Plantae or secondary plastid-containing
eukaryotes. However, when the first chlamydial genomes
were sequenced, a surprisingly high proportion of genes
with highest similarity to plant genes were discovered
[12]. This finding, in conjunction with the obligate intracellular lifestyle of chlamydiae, sparked a number of studies that aimed to elucidate the phylogenetic history of the
plant-like chlamydial genes. The conclusions ranged from
proposals that the chlamydial proteins in plants simply
reflected an ancient phylogenetic relationship between
chlamydiae and cyanobacteria (and thus plastids) [13,44]
to an HGT between chlamydiae and plants with either the
chlamydiae [15,45,46] or plants [47,48] proposed as
donors.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/203

While the present work was in progress, Huang and Gogarten [16] published data, based on phylogenomic analyses of the rhodoplant Cyanidioschyzon merolae to identify
chlamydial homologues, which suggested that at least 21
genes were transferred between chlamydiae and the ancestor of Rhodoplantae and Viridiplantae. They concluded
that the donor was most similar to present-day Protochlamydia and that the relatively high number of genes transferred suggested an ancient chlamydial endosymbiosis
with the ancestral primary photosynthetic eukaryote.
These authors also hypothesized that the chlamydial
endosymbiont was perhaps necessary to facilitate the
establishment of the cyanobacterial endosymbiont,
explaining the apparent uniqueness of primary plastid
evolution and providing independent evidence for the
monophyly of eukaryotes harboring primary plastids. The
results and conclusions by [16] are corroborated by the
present analyses (for differences in interpretation of phylogenetic analyses of some putative chlamydial proteins
between the two studies, see Additional File 4). Using an
extended phylogenomic analyses that included three
chlorophyte (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Ostreococcus tauri
and O. lucimarinus), a second rhodoplant (Galdieria sulphuraria), and two diatom genomes (Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum), and sequences
retrieved from EST databases (in particular from the two
glaucoplants, Cyanophora paradoxa and Glaucocystis nostochinearum), as well as model-specified phylogenetic
analyses of all proteins recovered, the number of chlamydial proteins now identified in photosynthetic eukaryotes
has doubled [39 vs 19 (21) in Huang and Gogarten's analyses (two of their proteins are believed to be false positives; see Additional File 4)], which is still likely an
underestimate. This is corroborated by a recent study that
provided a list of 55 genes in Plantae of putative chlamydial origin [49], including 24 of the 39 proteins of likely
chlamydial origin described in this study. Different data
mining strategies including different e-value cut offs in the
initial BLAST analyses, different phylogenetic methods
used and the overall more conservative approach taken in
this study may account for the observed different numbers
of genes reported.
Most significantly, five chlamydial proteins (instead of
previously only one, i.e. ATP/ADP translocase) are now
represented in the three lineages of Plantae and their phylogenetic analyses all revealed monophyly of the Plantae
as well as their sister group relationship to chlamydiae.
Although P. amoebophila was often recovered as a sister to
the Plantae, in such topologies other chlamydiae were
either absent (suggesting loss of the respective genes in
such chlamydiae) or the chlamydiae were paraphyletic,
the latter likely an artifact of long-branch attraction (see
Results). It is concluded that the donor of presumably all
(except one) of the chlamydial genes found today in plas-

tid-containing eukaryotes was related to the common
ancestor of P. amoebophila and other chlamydiae, and thus
that the HGT/EGT of chlamydial genes into plastid-containing eukaryotes was an ancient event that occurred
more than 700 MYA, the estimated time since divergence
of P.amoebophila from other chlamydiae [14]. Evidence
has also been presented (see Results) that the acceptor of
this HGT/EGT event was related to the ancestor of the
Plantae, i.e. that HGT/EGT of chlamydial genes occurred
before the divergence of the Glaucoplantae, Rhodoplantae and Viridiplantae.
The simultaneous presence of cyanobacterial and chlamydial homologues of a larger number of proteins throughout the early history of the Plantae can, in principle, be
explained by four alternative scenarios (Fig. 4A–C): (1)
the first scenario (multiple HGTs from a Protochlamydiatype donor into different photosynthetic eukaryotes; Fig.
4A) can be rejected (see above), because it is in conflict
with the presence of chlamydial genes of the same origin
in the common ancestor of the Plantae (see above). (2)
The second scenario (Fig. 4B) assumes that chlamydial
genes were transferred from a chlamydial donor(s) by a
massive single or by multiple HGTs into the cyanobacterial ancestor of plastids before primary endosymbiosis,
followed by multiple losses of chlamydial genes in the different lineages of photosynthetic eukaryotes. This scenario fails to explain the complete absence of chlamydial
genes in any extant cyanobacterium (unless this gene
transfer was a unique event, see below) and cannot provide a rationale for retention of two functional homologues (of cyanobacterial and chlamydial origin) of a
protein over extended periods of time in the cyanobacterial symbiont (or plastid). Although HGT among prokaryotes is rampant [eg. [50-53]] it is difficult to envision what
kind of adaptive advantage would be gained in a free-living cyanobacterium upon acquisition of, e.g., the ATP/
ADP translocase [54]. (3 – 4) In the third and fourth scenario (Fig 4C), HGT or EGT of chlamydial genes occurred
during the same time period as EGT of the cyanobacterium into a eukaryotic host. Either there was massive bulk
transfer of genes from an intracellular chlamydial bacterium to the host or cyanobacterial endosymbiont with
subsequent differential loss of these genes in the different
lineages of Plantae (HGT) or the chlamydial bacterium
persisted as an intracellular symbiont/parasite over
extended but varying periods of time in the three lineages
of Plantae (EGT) and different chlamydial proteins were
successively recruited by the eukaryotic hosts. The latter
scenario is favored because the simultaneous presence of
chlamydial and cyanobacterial homologues of enzymes
with the same function over an extended period of time
presumably requires compartmentalization, i. e. residence
in their original environment, the respective symbionts.
Whether gene transfer occurred first from the intracellular

Scenarios to explain the simultaneous presence of cyanobacterial and

of cyanobacterial endosymbiosis and group-specific multiple gene losses of chlamydial
genes. (D) Origin of chlamydial proteins in heterokont algae. Two secondary endosymbioses are shown involving sequentially a viridiplant and a rhodoplant symbiont.

chlamydial bacterium to the host nucleus with later retargeting of the protein to the cyanobacterium (plastid), as
hypothesized by [16] or directly between the two types of
intracellular bacteria (chlamydial bacterium and cyanobacterium), with gene transfer from the plastid to the host
nucleus occurring later (favored here) or perhaps using
both routes, remains unknown and possibly depended on
the exact timing of the two endosymbioses and the intracellular location of the symbionts relative to each other.
A co-existence of a chlamydial bacterium and the evolving
plastid in the eukaryotic host over an extended time
period may seem unlikely; however, multiple intracellular
bacteria occur in extant protists, and recently, Heinz et al.
[55] provided evidence for the beneficial association of
two intracellular bacteria (a chlamydial bacterium and a
proteobacterium) in a free living Acanthamoeba. There is
also evidence for mobile DNA in intracellular bacteria of
eukaryotic hosts [56,57] and the recent discoveries of conjugation machineries in intracellular rickettsiae and
chlamydiae have been particularly enlightening [58,59].
Based on phylogenetic and bioinformatic analyses, Ogata
et al. [59] concluded that genes involved in conjugative
DNA transfer have been exchanged by HGT between the
ancestors of rickettsiae and environmental chlamydiae in
a eukaryotic host, likely an amoeba. This may have been
the same HGT event that resulted in the transfer of ATP/
ADP translocase (in total five paralogous tlc genes), the
hallmark enzyme of the intracellular ATP-parasitism of
rickettsiae and chlamydiae, from the ancestor of chlamydiae to the ancestor of rickettsiae [45,46,60,61]. Although
it has recently been suggested that the plastid paralogue
(NTT1) of the ATP/ADP translocase might have been
derived from the mitochondrial ancestor (and thus from
a rickettsia-type α-proteobacterium; [62]), this is unlikely
because almost all of the 39 chlamydial proteins identified to date in plastid-containing eukaryotes presumably
originated in an intracellular chlamydial symbiont/parasite residing in the Plantae (this study), while the origin of
mitochondria occurred much earlier (none of the 39
chlamydial proteins, with three exceptions [Dictyostelium],
has been found in other eukaryotes).
This study also offered the first opportunity to trace the
spread of chlamydial proteins through secondary plastid
endosymbioses using phylogenomic information from
the two diatoms Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Phylogenetic analyses of the 20 chlamydial proteins recovered from the diatom proteomes led to
the conclusion that chlamydial proteins originated by two
separate secondary endosymbiotic events, one involving a
viridiplant and a second involving a rhodoplant symbiont, only the latter surviving in extant photosynthetic heterokonts. It is also concluded that both secondary
endosymbioses were ancient, presumably occurring

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/203

before the major radiations in both lineages of Plantae
took place (see Results and Fig. 4D).
Analysis of the genome of Thalassiosira pseudonana gave
the first indication that the diatom proteome contained a
surprisingly large number of proteins that matched only
to Viridiplantae (i.e. Arabidopsis thaliana; 865 proteins),
more than four times as many as to the rhodoplant Cyanidioschyzon merolae [63]. Even when one considers that
the A. thaliana proteome is more than four times larger
than the C. merolae proteome, there would still be about
equal numbers of diatom proteins matching either to
Viridiplantae or Rhodoplantae. The numerical ratio of
diatom proteins with similarity to either Viridiplantae or
Rhodoplantae was even more biased towards Viridiplantae, when animals (Mus musculus) were replaced by the
cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 (2023 "green" proteins vs. 254 "red" proteins) in proteome comparisons,
perhaps suggesting that the contribution of viridiplant
proteins to the diatom proteome extends well beyond the
plastid proteome. These results were corroborated in a
comparative proteome approach using more than 5,000
non-redundant EST sequences from the pennate diatom
P. tricornutum [64]. The genomes of the early diverging
heterokonts Phytophthora sojae and P. ramosum displayed a
large number of genes (855) supporting a photosynthetic
ancestry of these presumably aplastidial protists, and
again a significant portion of these genes revealed best
matches to Viridiplantae [65].
Although the origin of the heterokont plastid from a red
alga has been established beyond doubt using phylogenetic and phylogenomic approaches [66-71], phylogenomic analyses of the "green" proteins in heterokonts/
chromalveolates have only recently been initiated [65,7174]. Li et al. [71] used 5,081 expressed sequence tags of
the haptophyte Emiliania huxleyi and a phylogenomic
approach including genome and EST data from other
algae, animals, plants and bacteria to identify the source
of endosymbiotic gene transfer for 19 non-paralogous
proteins using maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses: 17 genes were of the expected red algal origin, whereas
for two genes (chlorophyll a synthase, phosphoribulokinase [PRK]) Viridiplantae were the sister group of the heterokonts/chromalveolates to the exclusion of the
Rhodoplantae. Similar results regarding the phylogeny of
PRK were obtained by Petersen et al. [72]. Whereas
Petersen et al. [72] suggested that PRK in heterokonts/
chromalveolates originated by a single non-endosymbiotic HGT from a green alga to a rhodoplast-containing
protist, Li et al. [71], referring to the earlier controversial
discussion about a putative green algal ancestry of the apicoplast-encoded elongation factor tufA [75] and the apicomplexan mitochondrial-targeted cox2a and cox2b
subunits [76], raised the possibility that "green" proteins

Page 14 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:203

in heterokonts/chromalveolates may have originated by
EGT from a green alga that was endosymbiotic in a heterokont/chromalveolate. From their data, Li et al. [71] concluded that the red algal contribution, however, was at
least an order of magnitude larger than that of green algae.
In a related study, Nosenko et al. [73] identified 30 different plastid-targeted proteins from two EST-libraries of the
tertiary plastid-containing dinoflagellate Karenia brevis. Of
22 proteins whose evolutionary origins could be resolved,
13 were of rhodoplant, while 6 were of viridiplant origin.
These authors suggested that a major influx of viridiplant
genes occurred early in the evolution of heterokonts/chromalveolates, and since all "foreign" genes acquired by
chromalveolates before their divergence into heterokonts/
alveolates were derived from a single donor (a
viridiplant), one possible explanation would be the presence of a green algal endosymbiont in the chromalveolate
ancestor prior to the rhodoplant endosymbiosis [71]. The
phylogenetic trees derived to date from most of the
"green" proteins in chromalveolates (e.g. PRK, periplasmic serin protease IV, soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase,
γ-Tocopherol O-methyltransferase) suggest that EGT
occurred before the divergence of Chlorophyta and Streptophyta, in accordance with the results presented in this
study. In conclusion, heterokonts/chromalveolates seem
to have obtained chlamydial proteins from two sources,
both signaling ancient secondary endosymbiotic events
involving symbionts from two of the three lineages of
Plantae. An ancient "shopping for plastidial eukaryotes"
[24] in the heterotrophic ancestor of the heterokonts/
chromalveolates could explain the origin of the metabolic
versatility that may have subsequently contributed to the
ecological success of this group of organisms irrespective
of whether photosynthesis was retained or not [77,78]. As
in the case of the primary acquisition of chlamydial proteins by the ancestor of the Plantae (see above), it is suggested that in the heterokont/chromalveolate ancestor,
genes were also transferred from the old to the new "shopping bag", or to phrase it differently, "you are what you
shop".

Conclusion
We identified 39 proteins of chlamydial origin in photosynthetic eukaryotes. Most likely Chlamydiae invaded the
ancestor of the Plantae and intracellular chlamydiae persisted throughout the early history of the Plantae, donating genes either directly or via the cyanobacterial
endosymbiont/plastid to their hosts before they eventually vanished. The transferred genes replaced their cyanobacterial/plastid homologs thus shaping early algal/plant
evolution. Chlamydial proteins spread through secondary
endosymbioses to other photoautotrophic eukaryotes.
Heterokonts/chromalveolates seem to have obtained
chlamydial proteins from two secondary endosymbiotic

events involving symbionts from the rhodoplant and
viridiplant lineages.

Methods
Data set
We screened for algal proteins of possible chlamydial origin in the following ways: 1) The JGI databases for
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Ostreococcus tauri, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira
pseudonana were searched for Blast hits with Protochlamydia amoebophilia using the advanced search function and
an e-value cut off of exp -20. 2) The proteome of Cyanidioschyzon merolae was downloaded from http://merolae.biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ and blasted (NCBI BLASTP)
locally against the proteom of Protochlamydia amoebophila
using an e-value cut-off of exp-20. Proteins and contigs
showing similarity over the entire length were selected for
further analysis. To exclude false positive we blasted
(BLASTP) each algal protein against the NCB non redundant protein database and the databases for
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Ostreococcus tauri, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira
pseudonana at JGI and the Cyanidionschyzon merolae database at http://merolae.biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/. For proteins
showing an association with proteins of Chlamydiae in
the distance tree generated by the NCBI BLAST server, we
assembled a dataset containing all algal proteins and proteins from Arabidopsis, Oryza, at least 5 Chlamydiae (incl.
Protochlamydia amoebophilia), at least 5 cyanobacteria and
members of the Proteobacteria and Firmicutes and 5 – 10
bacterial strains obtained as top bacterial BLASTP hits
using the protein from Protochlamydia as a query.
Phylogenetic analysis
Alignment of single-gene data sets were generated using
CLUSTAL W and manually refined with SeaView [79].
Non-alignable regions were excluded prior to phylogenetic analyses. The evolutionary model fitting best the
protein data was determined with ProtTest 1.2.6 with
deactivated "+F" option [80,81]. Maximum likelihood
trees were done with phyml 2.4.4 set to the optimal evolutionary model and including 200 bootstrap replicates
(in most cases WAG+I+Γ; [82,83]). All trees that were chosen to be depicted, have been subjected in addition to
Bayesian inference with MrBayes 3.1.2 [84]. For each data
set, two runs with four chains and 3 million generations
have been computed. Likelihood parameters were set to 4
gamma categories and proportion of invarable sites. Computation was done across all available amino acid substitution matrices (command "prset aamodel = mixed").
Every 100th generation was sampled. Convergence of the
runs was checked according to the output of the "sump"
command. The output was also used to determine the
burn-in phase.

Two concatenated data sets with a reduced taxon sampling have been assembled from single-gene data. In the
first of these data sets, single genes that showed a closer
relationship of Bacillariophyta to red algae have been
combined, whereas the second data set comprised single
genes showing a relationship of Bacillariophyta to
Viridiplantae. All concatenated data sets have been subjected to the same analysis procedure as the single genes
concerning maximum likelihood analysis (see above).
Since in the concatenated data sets some sequences for
single taxa were missing, no partitions were defined for
Bayesian analyses (see legend of Fig. 3, additional file 5
for details).
