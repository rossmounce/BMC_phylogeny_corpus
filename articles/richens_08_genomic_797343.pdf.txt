Abstract
Background: Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) are among the most common mammals in
North America and are important reservoirs of several human pathogens, including Sin Nombre
hantavirus (SNV). SNV can establish a life-long apathogenic infection in deer mice, which can shed
virus in excrement for transmission to humans. Patients that die from hantavirus cardiopulmonary
syndrome (HCPS) have been found to express several proinflammatory cytokines, including
lymphotoxin (LT), in the lungs. It is thought that these cytokines contribute to the pathogenesis of
HCPS. LT is not expressed by virus-specific CD4+ T cells from infected deer mice, suggesting a
limited role for this pathway in reservoir responses to hantaviruses.
Results: We have cloned the genes encoding deer mouse LTα and LTβ and have found them to
be highly similar to orthologous rodent sequences but with some differences in promoters
elements. The phylogenetic analyses performed on the LTα, LTβ, and combined data sets yielded
a strongly-supported sister-group relationship between the two murines (the house mouse and the
rat). The deer mouse, a sigmodontine, appeared as the sister group to the murine clade in all of the
analyses. High bootstrap values characterized the grouping of murids.
Conclusion: No conspicuous differences compared to other species are present in the predicted
amino acid sequences of LTα or LTβ; however, some promoter differences were noted in LTβ.
Although more extensive taxonomic sampling is required to confirm the results of our analyses,
the preliminary findings indicate that both genes (analyzed both separately and in combination) hold
potential for resolving relationships among rodents and other mammals at the subfamily level.

Background
Lymphotoxins-α (LTα) and -β (LTβ) are members of the
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily and are closely
linked to the TNF gene within the major histocompatibility complex of all known mammalian species. LTα

polypeptides can form a soluble homotrimer (LT) that is
secreted principally by activated T lymphocytes and NK
cells, while LTβ polypeptides form type II membranebound heterotrimers with LTα polypeptides (LTα1β2 or
LTα2β1) [1]. Each form of the trimer is involved in inflamPage 1 of 10

matory responses, induction of apoptosis of target cells,
and lymphoid organogenesis.
Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) is caused
by several pathogenic New World hantaviruses, but most
North American cases of HCPS are caused by Sin Nombre
virus (SNV) [2-5]. The disease is characterized by the production of several proinflammatory cytokines, including
LT, in the lungs [6]. In contrast, the principal reservoir
host of SNV, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) [7],
exhibits no conspicuous pathology and remains persistently infected for life [8,9]. It is unknown how deer mice
can be persistently infected without pathology because
few methods have been developed for characterizing
cytokine responses in this species. We previously reported
a partial cDNA sequence of deer mouse LTα [10] and
present here genomic, structural, and phylogenetic characterizations of the complete lymphotoxin genes.
As one of the most ecologically and morphologically
diverse groups within Mammalia, Rodentia has always
been a challenge to delineate systematically. And, despite
the attention the group has received from ecologists and
evolutionary biologists, the lineages within the group
have been difficult to resolve. In particular, the relationships among members of the family Muridae, arguably
the most species-rich family of mammals, have yet to be
definitively resolved at the subfamily level and below
[11]. The introduction and analysis of new sources of
molecular data, such as those sampled here, may represent an avenue for understanding the evolution and diversification of the rodents. In addition, the prospect of
combining data sets, as examined here, allows investigators a greater suite of options when it comes to understanding the relationships within highly diverse groups
such as the Muridae family. Although the taxonomic sampling within this study was limited by the availability of
orthologs in GenBank, we have conducted a preliminary
examination of the usefulness of LTα and LTβ for phylogeny reconstruction at the subfamily level within the order
Rodentia. We present here the extent to which these lymphotoxins (both in separate and combined data sets) have
potential for resolving relationships within Muridae.

Results
Deer mouse Lta gene and polypeptide
The Lta sequence is 1,085 nucleotides (nt) and includes
partial 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTR). No cis-elements were identified in the UTRs due to insufficient
sequence information. As with other Lta genes, deer
mouse Lta is composed of three exons. The putative LTα
polypeptide is highly conserved with LTα from all other
known rodent species (Fig. 1). It possesses a 33 residue
leader sequence, and is 92% similar and 90% identical to
house mouse (Mus musculus) LTα [12]. The β-strands that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/9/62

form the inner (A", A, C, F, H) and outer (A', B', B, D, E,
G) β-sheets common to TNF family members are present
[13]. D48 in the A'-A" loop and Y106 in the D-E loop
involved in binding to TNFR1 [14] are conserved in deer
mouse LTα.
Deer mouse Ltb gene and polypeptide
The assembled Ltb gene is 1,840 nt and promoter analysis
(NIH Signal Scan) revealed several putative 5' UTR cis-elements, including NF-1, Krüppel-like factor (KLF), Ets-1,
NF-κB and MyoD and several Gli1 sites (Fig. 2) similar to
that of orthologous Ltb [15,16]. The deer mouse gene
uniquely possesses an Sp1 site. An unconventional TATA
signal identical to that in house mouse Ltb [16] is relatively close to the ATG start codon, suggesting the mRNA
has a short 5' UTR. The CCCAG motif, a putative site for
Gli transcription factors that are thought to control adult
organ sizes [17], occurs at four identical sites in the deer
mouse and house mouse, four sites in the human, and five
sites in the rat (Rattus norvegicus) and woodchuck (Marmota monax) sequences.

The deer mouse gene also has an A at nt 733 that is found
in house mouse Ltb (Fig. 3). In human LTB, this nucleotide is a G and acts as a donor splice site that results in a
four exon gene. In the four rodent species for which Ltb
sequences are available, the genes contain only three
exons because the intron 2 found in the human sequence
encodes additional amino acids in the rodent sequences.
Both deer mice and house mice have the A at this position,
while the rat possesses a 3 nt deletion that encompasses
this location. Interestingly, the woodchuck sequence has
the same GT donor splice site as the human sequence, but
apparently does not have a consensus splice signal and
therefore has three exons like the other rodent genes [18].
The putative deer mouse LTβ polypeptide is composed of
302 amino acids and shares 88% similarity and 84% identity with house mouse LTβ (Fig 4). It possesses a 33 residue transmembrane domain that is completely conserved
among all four rodent LTβ polypeptides. The β-strands
that form the β-sheets of the polypeptide are well-conserved in deer mouse LTβ. Human LTβ is shorter due to
the presence of the additional intron. This region is predicted to control the distance of the TNF domains from
the plasma membrane, with rodent LTβ protruding further outward, by virtue of the extra amino acids, forming
a stalk [16].
Phylogenetic analysis of LTα sequences
The final alignment of the LTα nucleotide sequences
included a total of 571 characters, 116 of which were variable but not parsimony-informative, and 66 of which
were parsimony-informative. The single most parsimonious tree resulting from the analysis of this data set (C.I.

Sister to the house mouse-rat clade was the deer mouse
lineage; the grouping of murids was supported by a bootstrap value of 100%.
Phylogenetic analysis of combined data set
The results of the partition-homogeneity test indicated
that the LTα and LTβ data sets were not significantly
incongruent and could, therefore, be combined into a single data set. The combined data set included a total of
1471 characters; of these characters, 474 were variable but
not parsimony-informative while 197 were parsimonyinformative. As in the case of the separate analyses, the

single most parsimonious tree resulting from the combined analysis (C.I. excluding uninformative characters =
0.8396; R.I. = 0.7614; length = 872) showed a well-supported clade (bootstrap value = 100%) consisting of the
house mouse and the rat (Fig. 5). Sister to this clade was
the deer mouse lineage; the grouping of murid rodents
was supported by a bootstrap value of 100%. Finally,
while all three analyses reconstructed the traditional subfamily designations within the family Muridae, none of
them was able to resolve which of the two outgroups
(Sciuridae or Hominidae) was most closely related to the
murids.

Exon 2 splice variation between rodent and human Ltb genes
Exon 2 splice variation between rodent and human Ltb genes. Human LTB possesses at the end of exon 2 a splice
donor site (underlined) that is missing in rodent orthologs. Deer mouse and house mouse genes have an A at this position,
while the rat has a 3 nt deletion. Although woodchuck gene has a GT at this position, it does not appear to have the surrounding consensus sequence to support splicing. For this reason, rodent LTβ are substantially larger than human.

Discussion
Lymphotoxin is expressed in fatal cases of HCPS and may
contribute to the inflammatory pathogenesis of the disease [6]. In lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection
of New Zealand black house mice, blockade of LTβ receptor reverses respiratory failure and immunopathology
[19]. It is unknown if lymphotoxin is expressed in the
lungs of deer mice infected with SNV. Conspicuous T lymphocyte migration into the lungs of infected deer mice is
absent, suggesting that it is not, even though viral RNA
can be detected more than 200 days post infection in
some deer mice [8,9]. Antigen-specific T cells from the
spleens of persistently-infected deer mice appear to be regulatory T cells [20], suggesting the lymphotoxin pathway
is not used during persistence.
The TNF family is a frequent target of viral evasion strategies [21] and given the role of these proteins in inflammation they may also be targets of hantaviruses in their
rodent hosts, which do not exhibit inflammatory
responses. LT has been implicated in host-virus coexistence with human and mouse cytomegaloviruses by inducing IFNβ expression in fibroblasts without apparent
cytotoxicity or induction of apoptosis [22]. In this manner, the expression of LT permits virus persistence without
cytopathology. Since hantaviruses and rodent hosts have
coevolved for tens of millions of years, it is likely that each
has adapted to induce minimal pathology. Since deer
mouse CD4+ T cells are not susceptible to SNV infection
[20] it is unlikely that viral proteins directly affect the LT
pathways of these cells.
Structurally, deer mouse lymphotoxins are highly similar
to orthologous polypeptides. Deer mouse LTα is predicted
to be composed of 169 residues and LTβ is 302 residues
long. Each polypeptide shares 11 secondary domains
found in mouse and human lymphotoxins.

The deer mouse LTα and LTβ gene and polypeptide
sequences are not conspicuously different from orthologous sequences. We did not obtain flanking information
of the Lta gene, despite repeated attempts with primers
designed to amplify additional 5' and 3' regions. These
regions may be less conserved in deer mice compared to
other rodent species, which would make primer design
problematic. We were able to obtain some promoter
information for the Ltb gene, which shares cis-elements
found in the house mouse Ltb gene. One difference is the
presence of an Sp1 cis-element in deer mouse. Whether
this has functional consequences for Ltb expression will
require further investigation since only lymphotoxin-α
has been examined in human or rodent hantavirus infections [6,20]. All five of the promoters examined here also
possess KLF cis-elements, which are recognized by a
number of Sp1-family transcriptional repressors [23]. The
intron/exon structure of deer mouse Ltb is identical to the
other rodents, namely that all have three exons instead of
four that is found in human LTB because of a splice donor
site in intron 2 of the human gene. It is unusual, though,
that while the deer mouse and house mouse have identical sequences at this site, the rat sequence possesses a
three-nucleotide deletion. Deer mice (Sigmondontinae)
are substantially more divergent than are rats and house
mice (both Murinae) [24], suggesting the deletion in the
rat gene occurred after the rat/house mouse divergence.
Additional 5' and 3' information could provide information about these genes that is limited by our PCR
approach. Alternative strategies for obtaining such information would be the use of genomic libraries, such as the
recently-produced BAC library for the deer mouse http://
bacpac.chori.org/. In addition, the deer mouse genome
has recently been selected for sequencing (M. Dewey,
pers. comm.), which should facilitate such analyses.
In agreement with many molecular studies on subfamily
designations within Muridae [10,11,25,26], all of our

analyses were able to resolve the separation between the
Murinae and the Sigmodontinae. Future tests of LTα and
LTβ utility need to add lymphotoxin sequence data from
other muroid groups such as Tylonyinae, Neotomyinae,
Cricetinae, and Arvicolinae; these subfamilies are particularly critical to sample because they are thought to be
closely related to both the murines and the sigmodontines
[11]. Although the analyses reconstructed Muridae, none
of the data sets was able to ally the woodchuck (a member
of the rodent family Sciuridae) with the other three
rodents; in other words, the analyses were not able to
resolve which one of the outgroups (woodchuck or
human) was more closely related to the murid rodents.
Further sampling within Sciuridae and other groups such
as Gliridae and Dipodidae may be necessary to test the
utility of these data for resolving family-level relationships
within Rodentia. Despite that issue, the moderate level of
useful variation that both LTα and LTβ possess, in combination with the high level of bootstrap support that characterized the subfamily-level lineages suggest that further
investigation of phylogenetic utility is justifiable. In addition, because the two data sets may be combined with one
another, investigators may have yet another approach at
hand in resolving relationships that are currently problematic.
Collectively, the tumor necrosis factor cluster is nearly
identical between mammalian species (Fig. 6; [27]).
While intervening sequences between Tnf, Lta and Ltb are
not complete for deer mice, the structures of these genes
are homologous between species. While unlikely, it is possible that gene orientation, order and location of the deer
mouse genes are not syntenic to other species' TNF loci.
The locus is found in the MHC in all mammalian species
that have been examined; however, the chromosomal
location of the deer mouse MHC has not yet been deter-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/9/62

mined, but may reside on chromosome 21 (R. O'Neill,
pers. comm.).

Conclusion
These sequences represent the fourth rodent, and first
New World murid, Lta and Ltb genes described thus far.
They exhibit substantial sequence conservation to orthologous sequences and the availability of these sequences
may provide insight into their functions in deer mice
infected with SNV.
What potential do these molecules hold for phylogeny
reconstruction and/or hypothesis testing? The results suggest that these molecules inform on the intrafamilial level
within Rodentia; in addition, our findings indicate that
combining the LTα and LTβ data into a single data set is
appropriate. Thus, LTα and LTβ may hold promise for
resolving subfamily relationships not only within Rodentia but within other mammalian orders as well. The
implementation of broader taxonomic representation will
allow for a fuller test of the utility of these molecules for
phylogenetics.

Methods
Liver DNA was extracted (PureGene DNA Isolation Kit,
Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) from an adult
deer mouse (P. maniculatus sonoriensis) [28] and used to
amplify fragments representing the Lta and Ltb genes by
PCR (PCR Core Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) with
primers from highly conserved regions of mouse, rat and
human orthologs. The fragments were cloned into pGEMT Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and transformed into Novablue cells (Novagen, Madison, WI,
USA). Plasmids containing inserts of the appropriate sizes
were used for DNA sequencing. After initial sequencing
runs using T7 and SP6 primers, insert-specific primers

were used for primer-walking sequencing. The sequence
files were assembled with Sequencher version 4 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and submitted to blast to
identify genes [29].
The Lta gene was amplified and cloned using a single
primer set (forward, 5'-TGT CTT CCG CTG TGT GCC CC3'; reverse, 5'-GTG AGA GCT CTG GGT CTG TTT GG-3').
The Ltb gene was cloned from 5' and 3' overlapping PCR
products using primers designed from conserved orthologous sequences (5' end, forward 5'-TTC CCC AGT TCA
GAG AAC C-3'; reverse 5'-TCC CTC TCC TGT AGT CCA
CC-3': 3' end, forward 5'-GAG GCG AGC CAA GAA GAA
GC-3'; reverse 5'-ACG ATT CAC ACA TTC GCA CC-3').
Promoter analysis was conducted using NIH Signal Scan
database http://www-bimas.cit.nih.gov/molbio/signal/
(Prestridge, D.S. 1991).
Phylogenetic Analyses
Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the deer
mouse nucleotide sequences collected in this study and all
available orthologous sequences found in GenBank (for
species names and accession numbers, please see table 1).
For all of the analyses, sequences from the human, house
mouse, rat, and woodchuck were accessed from GenBank.
The sequences were aligned using default parameters in
ClustalW [30]; the alignment was then checked and
adjusted by eye. Regions that were difficult to align,
because of their hypervariable natures, were removed
from the final data sets. Before initiating the combined
analysis, the two data sets were assessed for combinability
using the incongruence length difference test [31]; the
results of the test indicated that the lymphotoxin-α and
lymphotoxin-β data sets were not significantly incongruent with respect to each other and could, therefore, be
combined (P value = 1.000000). PAUP* (version 4.0b8)
was used to perform maximum parsimony analyses for
each set of nucleotide sequences [32]. All characters were
weighted equally and because of the small size of each of
the data sets, the exhaustive search option in PAUP* was
used. Because of the low level of taxonomic representation found in the sequence databases for these molecules,
outgroup designation was somewhat problematic. Nevertheless, the human and the woodchuck (a sciurid rodent)
were chosen as outgroups for all of the analysis. Robust-

ness of the recovered branches was evaluated using 1000
iterations of nonparametric bootstrapping [33].
