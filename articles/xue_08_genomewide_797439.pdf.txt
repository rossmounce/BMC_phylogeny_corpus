Abstract
Background: The protein phosphatase 2Cs (PP2Cs) from various organisms have been implicated to act
as negative modulators of protein kinase pathways involved in diverse environmental stress responses and
developmental processes. A genome-wide overview of the PP2C gene family in plants is not yet available.
Results: A comprehensive computational analysis identified 80 and 78 PP2C genes in Arabidopsis thaliana
(AtPP2Cs) and Oryza sativa (OsPP2Cs), respectively, which denotes the PP2C gene family as one of the
largest families identified in plants. Phylogenic analysis divided PP2Cs in Arabidopsis and rice into 13 and
11 subfamilies, respectively, which are supported by the analyses of gene structures and protein motifs.
Comparative analysis between the PP2C genes in Arabidopsis and rice identified common and lineagespecific subfamilies and potential 'gene birth-and-death' events. Gene duplication analysis reveals that
whole genome and chromosomal segment duplications mainly contributed to the expansion of both
OsPP2Cs and AtPP2Cs, but tandem or local duplication occurred less frequently in Arabidopsis than rice.
Some protein motifs are widespread among the PP2C proteins, whereas some other motifs are specific
to only one or two subfamilies. Expression pattern analysis suggests that 1) most PP2C genes play
functional roles in multiple tissues in both species, 2) the induced expression of most genes in subfamily A
by diverse stimuli indicates their primary role in stress tolerance, especially ABA response, and 3) the
expression pattern of subfamily D members suggests that they may constitute positive regulators in ABAmediated signaling pathways. The analyses of putative upstream regulatory elements by two approaches
further support the functions of subfamily A in ABA signaling, and provide insights into the shared and
different transcriptional regulation machineries in dicots and monocots.
Conclusion: This comparative genome-wide overview of the PP2C family in Arabidopsis and rice
provides insights into the functions and regulatory mechanisms, as well as the evolution and divergence of
the PP2C genes in dicots and monocots. Bioinformatics analyses suggest that plant PP2C proteins from
different subfamilies participate in distinct signaling pathways. Our results have established a solid
foundation for future studies on the functional divergence in different PP2C subfamilies.

Background
The reversible phosphorylation of proteins is a fundamental mechanism by which living organisms modulate cellular processes including cell cycle events, growth factor
responses, hormone and environmental stimuli
responses, metabolic control, and developmental processes [1-5]. Protein phosphatases (PPs), by reversing the
action of protein kinases, provide modulations of protein
phosphoregulation. PPs can be grouped into two major
classes based on substrate specificity: protein tyrosine
phosphatases and protein serine/threonine phosphatases
[6]. Based on enzymological criteria using specific inhibitors and activators, most serine/threonine protein phosphatases have been placed into two subcategories: the
protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2
(PP2) [6]. PP2 proteins were further distinguished by
metal ion requirements: while protein phosphatases 2A
(PP2As) have no ion requirement, PP2Bs require Ca2+ and
PP2Cs require Mg2+ or Mn2+. Alternatively, based on both
distinct amino acid sequences and crystal structures, protein serine/threonine phosphatases can be classified into
the Phosphor-protein phosphatase (PPP) and the Mg2+or Mn2+- dependent protein phosphatase (PPM) families.
The PPP family covers the PP1, PP2A and PP2B groups,
whereas the PPM family includes the PP2C group and also
pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatases [7].
Members of the PP2C group from various organisms have
been implicated in acting as negative modulators of protein kinase pathways activated by diverse environmental
stresses or developmental signaling cascades [8-15]. In
plants, several PP2Cs have been described as negative regulators within the abscisic acid (ABA) mediated signaling
network [16-20]. Two dominant ABA insensitive mutants,
abi1-1 and abi2-1, are impaired in PP2C genes (ABI1 and
ABI2). Proteins encoded by these genes are important for
plant tolerance to several abiotic stresses including salt,
drought, and freezing [16,21-30]. Also HAB1 and PP2CA,
homologous PP2Cs from Arabidopsis, are negative regulators involved in ABA signaling [19,20,23,31-33]. Antisense mediated down-regulation of PP2CA genes accelerates plant development and leads to freezing tolerance
[17]. Two PP2C genes (FsPP2C1 and FsPP2C2) were isolated from beech seeds (Fagus sylvatica). Ectopic expression of FsPP2C1 in Arabidopsis, which shows high
sequence similarity with ABI1 and ABI2, confers ABA
insensitivity during seed dormancy and germination
under unfavorable conditions, indicating that FsPP2C1
also acts as a negative regulator of ABA signaling [18].
However, ectopic expression of FsPP2C2 in Arabidopsis
resulted in enhanced sensitivity to ABA and abiotic stress
in seeds and vegetative tissues and caused a dwarf phenotype and delayed flowering, which suggests that FsPP2C2
is a positive regulator of ABA [34].

Other plant PP2C members, such as MP2C from Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, act as counterparts of the
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway during salt
stress or wounding [35]. A kinase-associated protein
phosphatase 2C (KAPP) was originally identified as an
interacting protein of the receptor-like kinase CLAVATA1
(CLV1). KAPP acts as a negative modulator of CLV1 and is
required for the proper balance between cell proliferation
and differentiation in Arabidopsis shoots and floral meristems [36,37]. KAPP is also a component of a novel Na+
acclimation pathway [38]. Moreover, POLTERGEIST
(POL), encoding another PP2C in Arabidopsis, was also
identified as a modulator of the CLAVATA pathways controlling stem cell identity in meristems [39].
The availability of the complete Arabidopsis and Oryza
sativa genome sequences allows a timely, systematic
genome-wide comparative analysis of gene families
between monocots and eudicots [40-44]. Previously, 76
genes from Arabidopsis were identified as PP2C candidates [4]; however, important features like gene structures,
protein motifs and gene duplication events were not
explored, which is critical to understanding the characteristics of the Arabidopsis PP2C gene (AtPP2C) family.
Moreover, the rice PP2C gene (OsPP2C) family has not
been analyzed in detail, and the phylogenetic relationship
of the PP2C genes between Arabidopsis and rice remains
poorly understood.
In this study, we first identified all the PP2C genes from
Arabidopsis and rice, and then conducted phylogenetic
analyses to divide them into subfamilies. We further compared the rice and Arabidopsis PP2C genes to identify
both shared and specific subfamilies, as well as potential
gene birth-and-death events. Following the analysis of
gene structure and protein motifs, we traced gene duplication events that likely contributed to the expansion of the
PP2C family. The expression patterns of the PP2Cs from
rice and Arabidopsis were analyzed and compared, in
order to shed light on their functional roles, especially in
ABA-signaling and stress tolerance. The upstream regulatory regions of the subfamily A members were finally analyzed in order to provide insight into the transcriptional
regulation machineries that define the temporal and spatial expression and the stimuli responses.

Results and discussion
Identification of PP2C genes in Arabidopsis and rice
To uncover the entire family of genes coding for AtPP2C
proteins in Arabidopsis, we performed multiple keyword
searches to obtain PP2C protein sequences from several
databases. Sequences from these hits were used as queries
employing BLAST algorithms to search against the corresponding Arabidopsis sequence data sets (see Methods for
details). A custom Perl program was used to parse the

results and to exclude the redundant entries from the initial data set. Subsequently, the SMART [45] and Pfam [46]
motif identification tools were used to identify predicted
PP2C domains in all these candidate proteins. As a result
of this filtering, 109 non-redundant putative proteins
with PP2C domains encoded by 80 genes were extracted
from the Arabidopsis genome annotation (Table 1).
To explore the occurrence and size of the PP2C gene family in rice, all predicted AtPP2C protein sequences were
initially used as query sequences to search against the
TIGR rice database [47] using BLASTP. Multiple BLAST
searches were then performed in several rice databases
using rice protein sequences with significant hits as queries (see Methods for details). After confirming the presence of PP2C catalytic domains using SMART and Pfam,
111 putative proteins encoded by 78 genes were identified
as PP2C members in rice (Table 2). While scanning for
protein catalytic domains, additional specific motifs were
found in the regions outside of the PP2C catalytic domain
in both Arabidopsis and rice PP2Cs. Transmembrane
spanning regions were found in AT1G43900,
Os01g37130 and Os02g05630, protein kinase catalytic
domains were present in AT2G40860, Os01g36080 and
Os11g37540, and a forkhead-associated domain (FHA)
was identified in At5G19280 (KAPP).
Previously, 76 genes have been identified as AtPP2C candidate genes [4], all of which were present in our gene set
except for AT1G75010, which does not contain a PP2C
catalytic domain according to SMART and Pfam, and was
thus excluded from our analysis. Twenty-five and twenty
one alternative splicing variants were found in the Arabidopsis and rice PP2C gene families, respectively (Table 1
and 2). Because alternative splice variants share a common coding sequence, they are closely related to each
other in multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic
analysis. Thus we selected only a single variant for further
analysis. Despite the differences in genome sizes between
Arabidopsis and rice (125 Mb and 389 Mb, respectively),
the two plant species appear to have a very similar number
of genes encoding PP2C proteins. Compared to other
gene families analyzed in rice and Arabidopsis, the PP2C
gene family is one of the largest families in the plant kingdom. Only six PP2Cs were found in the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genome, and no more than fifteen are
present in the human genome [48,49]. The high number
of PP2C genes present in the Arabidopsis and rice genome
highlights the importance of the PP2C class of protein
phosphatases in plants, and suggests that plant PP2Cs
may have narrower substrate range than other organisms
[16,34].

Phylogenetic and comparative analysis of PP2C family in
Arabidopsis and rice
Using the 80 PP2C full length amino acid sequences from
Arabidopsis, a phylogenetic analysis was performed to
construct a phylogenetic tree (Figure 1). The results
showed that all but 7 AtPP2Cs can be divided into 13 subfamilies. Previously, 76 genes have been divided into 10
subfamilies (A-J) [4,50]. To be consistent with this past
study, we adopted the same name for the nine common
subfamilies (A, B, C, D, E, G, H, I, J). Since the members
of subfamily F are separated into two subfamilies in our
study, we named those two subfamilies F1 and F2. High
bootstrap support is observed for each subfamily clade
(85% for F2 and > 90% for the remainders), suggesting
that the genes in the same subfamily share the same evolutionary origin. Three of the five novel members identified in this study (AT2G30170, AT4G16580, AT5G66720)
form a new subfamily, which is designated K. The fourth
(AT4G03415) is placed into subfamily E, and the last
(AT4G33500) forms a single branch. Subfamily A, G and
E are further divided into subgroups with at least 50%
bootstrap support. Moreover, subfamilies C and D as well
as subfamilies E, L and H constitute sister clades in a
monophyletic cluster with high bootstrap support (83%
and 86%, respectively), suggesting close evolutionary relationships between the respective subfamilies. Fifty of the
AtPP2Cs form 25 paralogous sister pairs, 18 of which have
very strong bootstrap support (> 90%).

In order to evaluate the evolutionary relationship among
the 78 rice PP2C proteins, we also performed a phylogenetic analysis based on their full length amino acid
sequences (Figure 2). Eleven subfamilies are identified as
monophyletic clades with at least 50% bootstrap support,
and additional seven genes form single branches (Figure
2). Twenty-five sister pairs of paralogous OsPP2Cs are
found, eleven of which had very strong bootstrap support
(> 90%). Out results suggest a clear paralogous pattern of
PP2C gene divergence by gene duplication both in monocots and eudicots.
Structural examination reveals that untranslated regions
(UTRs) are present in 71 AtPP2C genes and 70 OsPP2C
genes (Figure 1 and 2). The number of introns ranged
from zero to twelve in AtPP2Cs and from zero to eighteen
in OsPP2Cs. Most members within the same subfamily,
both in Arabidopsis and rice, share a similar intron/exon
structure and gene length. This conserved intron/exon
structure in each subfamily supports their close evolutionary relationship and the introduced classification of subfamilies.
We further investigated the relationship between the Arabidopsis and rice PP2C protein families by generating an
alignment of the full-length protein sequences of 78

OsPP2Cs and 80 AtPP2Cs followed by the construction of
a phylogenetic tree (Figure 3). While bootstrap values for
internal nodes are low, the outer nodes allow the clustering of the PP2C genes of Arabidopsis and rice into 13 subfamilies with higher support values (> 98%). The tree
topology, as well as the subfamily organization, resembles
the individual trees from rice and Arabidopsis (Figure 1
and 2). The clades defining all 13 subfamilies contain
members from both rice and Arabidopsis. Subfamilies J
and L each contain only a single rice member, and are thus
defined as singletons instead of families in rice. The
remaining 11 rice subfamilies are named according to the
PP2C subfamily nomenclature in Arabidopsis (Figure 2).
Consistent with the AtPP2C gene family analysis, pretty
high bootstrap support was also found for a clade combining subfamilies C and D in rice (62%), confirming the
close evolutionary relationship between these two subfamilies in both eudicots and monocots. The rice and Arabidopsis genes in each subfamily are thus more closely
related to each other than to the PP2C genes of the same
species from a different subfamily, suggesting that an
ancestral set of PP2C genes defining each subfamily
already existed before the monocot-eudicot divergence.
Twenty-six putative Arabidopsis/rice orthologs are identified in the tree with high statistical support (indicated by
the orange squares in Figure 3). Furthermore, the phylogenetic construction of the PP2C family fits well with the
model of birth-and-death evolution in the flowering plant
lineage [51,52]. The branches with more than one AtPP2C
or OsPP2C gene likely experienced gene birth due to gene
duplication events, whereas the branches with only Arabidopsis or only rice PP2C members likely had gene death.
Similarly, other large gene families also experienced birth-

and-death evolution, such as the MADS-box gene family
and the basic/helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family analyzed in both rice and Arabidopsis [53,54].
Evolution and divergence of PP2C genes in Arabidopsis and
rice
Large segmental duplications of chromosomal regions
during evolution, followed by gene loss, small-scale
duplications and local rearrangements, have created the
present complexities of plant genome [55]. Indications of
several whole genome duplication have been found in the
Arabidopsis genome [56-58]. Likewise, two rounds of
large scale genome duplications have occurred in the lineage leading to rice, which cover most rice chromosomes
[40,59].

To investigate the relationship between the genetic divergence within the PP2C family and gene duplication events
in Arabidopsis, we located the 80 AtPP2C genes on the
Arabidopsis chromosomes based on the location information provided in the TAIR database [60]. The genes are
distributed across all five chromosomes except for the
upper regions of chromosome 2 (Figure 4). Only one gene
cluster was identified on chromosome 3, composed of
AT3G63320 and AT3G63340, which share high level of
sequence similarity and have thus likely resulted from a
tandem gene duplication event. Thirteen paralogous
AtPP2C pairs in the AtPP2C gene family were found on
segmentally duplicated chromosomal regions (Figure 4A,
blue lines), which was originated from a polyploidy event
occurred around 24 to 40 million years ago, probably
close to the emergence of the crucifer family [61-64]. The
putative protein sequences of those 13 pairs were clus-

tered with bootstrap value higher than 70% in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1). An additional 11 paralogous gene
pairs were identified based on phylogenetic relationship
and structural similar (Figure 4A, orange squares).
Although the chromosomal regions hosting these 11 gene
pairs were not included by Blanc et al [61] as recently
duplicated segmental regions, they were considered to be
duplicated genes. Together, these genes represent 60% of
all AtPP2Cs, indicating that large-scale segmental duplication events have contributed largely to the current complexity of the PP2C gene family in Arabidopsis. Only
2.5% of AtPP2Cs (one pair) are organized in clusters, and
likely have evolved via local or tandem duplications.
To determine the genomic distribution of the OsPP2C
genes, the DNA sequence of each OsPP2C gene was used
to search the rice genome database using BLASTN.
Although all of the 12 rice chromosomes do contain
OsPP2C genes, the distribution appears not random (Figure 4B). Relatively high densities of OsPP2C genes were
found in specific chromosomal regions, including the top
of chromosome 3, and the bottom of chromosome 2. In
contrast, several large chromosomal regions are devoid of
OsPP2C genes, such as the top parts of chromosomes 8, 9,
and 10 and the central sections of chromosomes 7, 8, and
12. To detect possible relationships between OsPP2C
genes and potential genome duplication events, we
mapped 17 paralogous pairs of OsPP2C genes. Twelve of
these pairs are linked to each of at least 8 previously predicted chromosomal/segmental duplications (Figure 4B,
green bars, linked with blue lines) [54,65,66]. Five additional pairs of OsPP2C genes are close paralogs (Figure
4B, orange squares), but are located in the regions that
have not been proposed to be the result of rice genome

duplication events. Thus, 44% of the OsPP2C family
might have evolved from putative rice genome duplication events. Four OsPP2C gene clusters contain the members with high levels of sequence similarity (Figure 4B, red
rectangles), representing a total of 13 OsPP2C genes. Thus
17% of OsPP2Cs are organized in clusters and likely have
evolved via local or tandem duplications.
Taken together, it appears that the PP2C gene families
expanded differently in rice and Arabidopsis. Whole
genome and chromosomal segment duplications mainly
contributed to the expansion of both OsPP2Cs and
AtPP2Cs giving rise to 44% and 60% of PP2C genes,
respectively. But tandem or local duplication occurred less
frequently in Arabidopsis (one pair, 2.5% of all PP2Cs)
than rice (four clusters, 17%). It is noteworthy that the
members of divergent PP2C subfamilies in both Arabidopsis and rice are located within the same chromosomal
region, whereas the members of the same subfamily are
distributed in different chromosomal regions, suggesting
that PP2C genes were distributed widely in the genome of
the common ancestor of monocots and eudicots. Furthermore, in both species the duplicated pairs of PP2C genes
appear to have been preferentially retained compared
with other genes, since the density of duplicated genes
retained in recently duplicated chromosomal segments
was estimated to be only 28% on average [61]. This highlights the indispensable roles of PP2Cs in both monocots
and
eudicots.
Protein motifs of PP2Cs in Arabidopsis and rice
To identify the motifs shared among related proteins
within the PP2C family, the MEME motif search tool was
employed [76]. We identified 11 motifs and their

distance tree generated by neighbor-joining: The unrooted tree, constructed using Mega (4.0), summarizes the phylogenetic
relationship among the 80 members of the PP2C family in Arabidopsis. The neighbor-joining tree was constructed using aligned
full-length amino acid sequences. The tree shows the 13 major phylogenetic subfamilies (numbered A to L, and marked with
different alternating tones of a gray background to make subfamily identification easier). The numbers beside the branches represent bootstrap values (≥ 50%) based on 1000 replicates that were used to group the 13 subfamilies. Gene structure: The
gene structure is represented by white boxes symbolizing untranslated regions, black boxes symbolizing exons and spaces
between boxes corresponding to introns. The sizes of exons, introns and untranslated regions are drawn to scale as indicated
on top. Protein structure: Each colored box with a number represents the occurrence of a specific motif in the protein identified using the MEME motif search tool (the sequence and length of each motif is shown in Table 3). The order of motifs corresponds to their position in individual protein sequences. Numbers between colored boxes represent the amount of amino acid
residues between the motifs in AtPP2C proteins.

sequences are shown in Table 3; the distribution of these
motifs in PP2C proteins in Arabidopsis and rice is shown
in Figure 1 and 2. Some motifs are widespread among
PP2C proteins (e.g. motifs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8). In contrast,
other motifs are specific to only one or two subfamilies.
For example, motifs 5 and 11 are specific to subfamilies C
and D, respectively, while motif 9 is found almost exclusively in subfamily D members. Vice versa, motifs 6 and 7
are present in subfamily A, but were not found in subfamily D. Subfamilies C and D have especially distinctive
characteristics in terms of motif distribution within the
PP2C family.
The different motif distribution in the respective protein
sequences may provide an anchor to study the divergence
of gene function in different subfamilies. Furthermore,
the fact that proteins in the same subfamily exhibit highly
similar motif distribution supports their close evolutionary relationship.
Expression patterns of PP2C genes in Arabidopsis and rice
Gene expression patterns can provide important clues for
gene function. To date, a comparative analysis of the
expression patterns of the whole PP2C gene family has
not been performed. Therefore, we firstly examined the
expression of AtPP2C genes in inflorescence, leaf, root
and silique tissues using microarray data from Genevestigator [67], massively parallel signature sequencing
(MPSS) data [68] and EST abundance data from NCBI
[69] (Figure 5A). Expression profiles for 67, 73, and 68
PP2C genes were extracted from the Genevestigator,
MPSS, and EST databases, respectively. After integrating
the three data sets, we found that most of the genes have
a very broad expression spectrum, and only ten genes
(AT1G07160, AT2G40180, AT3G09400, AT3G27140,
AT3G23360, AT4G03415, AT4G08260, AT4G11040,
AT5G24940, and AT5G51760) were not detected in any
of those four tissues. However, transcript evidence for all
genes is present in the mix tissue samples from Arabidopsis with the sole exception of AT4G11040 and
AT3G27140, indicating that they might be expressed only
at highly specific developmental stages. Since no evidence
for the expression of AT3G27140 was found in full-length
cDNA datasets at NCBI either (Table 1), it might be a
pseudogene. We also summarized the expression of rice
PP2C genes in leaf, flower, root, seed and stem tissues
using the same approach (Figure 5B). Expression signatures for 71 OsPP2C genes were detected in the MPSS
database, and 69 members had matching ESTs. No expression evidence was found in any database for three
OsPP2C
genes
(Os02g39480,
Os02g42250,
Os02g42270) (Table 2), suggesting that they might be
pseudogenes. Twenty OsPP2C genes had no detectable
tissue specific expression, but had matching transcript
sequences (Figure 5B), which might thus be expressed at

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/550

specific developmental stages or under special conditions
only.
A total of 49 AtPP2C genes were expressed in all tissues
examined. Only three AtPP2C genes (A2G35350,
AT3G05640 and AT5G02440) displayed highly preferential expression in certain tissue (Figure 5). Twenty-seven
OsPP2C genes were expressed in all tissues examined, and
six OsPP2C genes showed tissue-specific expression. Most
AtPP2C genes (84%) and OsPP2C genes (72%) were
expressed in more than 2 tissues examined, suggesting
that most PP2Cs in plants play functional roles at multiple developmental processes, and only a few members act
in tissue-specific biological processes. It is interesting to
note that 19 of 29 paralogous gene pairs (18 duplicated
gene pairs in Arabidopsis and 11 in rice) show differential
expression patterns, suggesting functional diversification
of most duplicated gene pairs. This result is consistent
with the previous findings that the expression of paralogs
frequently diverged to become part of parallel networks,
and that the expression of each gene is strongly correlated
with other non-homologous genes acting in the corresponding networks, suggesting that neo-functionalization
is a major feature of the long-term evolution of polyploids
[61].
The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays important
regulatory roles in many stress and developmental
responses throughout the plant life cycle, particularly in
the ability to sense and respond to various unfavorable
environmental conditions, including drought, salinity,
cold shock, and wounding during vegetative growth
[21,33,70-74]. To investigate possible involvement of
PP2Cs in ABA mediated signaling, we examined the
expression of all AtPP2Cs in response to ABA treatment
and several environmental stimuli using the Genevestigator microarray dataset [67] (Figure 6). The expression of
16 PP2Cs was found to be up-regulated in response to
ABA treatment, including all 9 members of subfamily A.
Five AtPP2C genes belonging to subfamily A have been
characterized as negative regulators in ABA-mediated
processes, including AT4G26080 (ABI1), AT5G57050
(ABI2), AT1G72770 (HAB1), AT1G17550 (HAB2), and
AT3G11410 (ATPP2CA) [16-20]. Unlike the PP2C genes
from other subfamilies, all members from subfamily A
were induced by several stimuli (Figure 6). To explore
whether also OsPP2C genes from subfamily A play functional roles in ABA mediated signaling pathways and
stress responses, we analyzed the expression of 10
OsPP2C genes in rice plants treated with ABA, salt,
osmotic (mannitol) and cold stress by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results
of our experiment indicate elevated expression levels of all
OsPP2C genes from subfamily A upon treatment with
ABA and salt (Figure 7). Also mannitol and cold treatment

led to induced expression of several subfamily A members, but expression and induction levels differed among
these genes (Figure 7). Thus, the expression pattern of the
OsPP2C subfamily A genes is in good agreement with the
microarray data for Arabidopsis subfamily A members,
suggesting that the members of this subfamily play foremost roles in ABA-mediated processes related to stress
responses both in monocots and eudicots.
Interestingly, the expression of 7 PP2C genes in Arabidopsis was suppressed by ABA treatment, and 2 of them are
the members of subfamily D (Fig. 6). In previous studies,
a PP2C from Fagus sylvatica (FsPP2C2) was described as a
positive regulator of the ABA signal transduction pathway,
contrary to most other PP2Cs described so far [34]. Based
on phylogenetic reconstructions, FsPP2C2 belongs to subfamily D and is most closely related to AT3G51370 (data
no shown). This result suggests that at least some members of subfamily D might have a positive role in ABA signaling pathways.
The expression of 30 AtPP2C genes was not influenced by
different environmental stimuli (Fig. 6), suggesting that
38% of AtPP2Cs might not play functional roles in
response to environmental stress signals. Among them,
five genes are from subfamily C, which is composed of
POLTERGEIST (POL, AT2G46920), five POL-like genes
(PLL1-PLL5, gene IDs in Table 1) and AT3G16560. POL
and PLL1 have been shown to regulate meristem development and pedicel length, while PLL4 and PLL5 were found
regulating leaf development [39,75]. These results indicate that at least some of these 38% AtPP2Cs (e.g. some
members of subfamily C) might be involved in developmental processes.
In summary, our expression analyses provide evidences
that PP2C genes in different subfamilies might play different functional roles in distinct signaling pathways.
Upstream regulatory regions of subfamily A PP2C genes in
Arabidopsis and rice
Promoters in the upstream region of genes play key roles
in conferring developmental and/or environmental regulation of gene expression. To further elucidate the transcriptional regulation machineries of the 19 PP2C genes
in subfamily A in Arabidopsis and rice, two approaches
were attempted in this study.

First, we analyzed the 1000-base-pair (bp) upstream promoter sequences of these AtPP2C genes using the PlantCARE database [77], and validated the results using the
PLACE databases [78]. Based upon this approach, a total
of 20 types of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) were identified among the 19 subfamily A AtPP2Cs, which do not
contain the common eukaryotic regulatory elements, such

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/550

as TATA and CAAT boxes. The names and functions of
these 20 motifs are shown in Table 4. Their amounts and
positions in every subfamily A member obtained by the
first method are displayed in Additional Files 1 and 2.
Second, we used these 20 motifs as a base for constructing
their frequency matrix following a frequency distribution
approach (see Methods and [79]), to compare the frequency of these motifs in the promoter regions of subfamily A with that in the whole genome, in order to
explore whether these 20 motifs are overrepresented in
subfamily A in Arabidopsis and rice. The frequency matrices of 9 motifs (ABRE, CE3, G-box, GCN4 motif, HSE, O2site, TC-rich repeats, TCA-element and TGACG motif)
were generated. Only a very limited number of sequences
containing the remaining 11 motifs (ACE, ARE, AuxRRcore, CAT-box, CCGTCC-box, CGTCA motif, circadian,
LTR, motif 1, Skn-1 motif, 5UTR Py-rich stretch) are
present in the PLACE, Plantcare and other databases,
therefore their frequency matrices could not be generated
in this analysis. Thus, only the frequency matrices of 9
motifs were used to identify all single occurrences of these
motifs in the promoter regions of the subfamily A members and all protein-coding genes using the genomic
sequences of Arabidopsis (genome release 7.0, January
2007) [60] and rice (release 4.0, January 2006) [47]
(Table 5). Our results suggest that in both species, 5 out of
9 motifs (GCN4, HSE, O2-site, TC-rich repeats and TCA
element) are not over-represented in the upstream regions
of PP2C subfamily A members. In contrast, in both species the frequency of ABREs (involved in ABA responsiveness) is much higher in the promoter regions of subfamily
A than in the whole genome (Tab. 5). The CE3 (involved
in ABA and VP1 responsiveness) and G-box (involved in
light responsiveness) motifs were found only in subfamily
A promoters from rice but absent in those from Arabidopsis. Our results support a previous finding that CE3s are
abundant in rice but almost absent in Arabidopsis [79]. In
reverse, the TGACG motif (involved in MeJA responsiveness) appeared relatively abundant in subfamily A promoters from Arabidopsis while absent in those from rice.
The different motif distributions in Arabidopsis and rice
point to evolutionary divergent patterns of PP2C gene regulatory networks. The abundance of ABA responsive elements in subfamily A PP2C gene promoters provides
additional evidences for their role in ABA signaling, and
reveals shared (ABRE) as well as different (CE3) gene regulation machineries for ABA responsiveness in dicots and
monocots. The occurrence of other motifs like G-box suggests that some subfamily A PP2C genes might be
involved also in other biological processes, such as lightresponsive pathways.

and their nucleotide frequency distributions in Arabidopsis and rice are provided in Fig. 8. ABRE, CE3 and G-box
are widely distributed in the upstream regions of subfamily A as well as in the whole genome of Arabidopsis
and rice (data no shown).
Our results also indicate that although the mapping of
known motifs to the promoter regions of genes (i.e. our
first approach) can reveal interesting patterns and
insights, it is necessary to compare the frequency of these
motifs in the genes against their genome-wide frequency
(i.e. our second approach), in order to explore whether
these motifs are truly enriched in the promoter regions of
these genes and to eliminate false positive motif instances.

members may constitute positive regulators in ABA-mediated signaling pathways. We further employed two
approaches to analyze the putative upstream regulatory
elements of PP2C subfamily members. The results
obtained by both methods support the function of subfamily A in ABA responses, and provide insights into the
shared and different transcriptional regulation machineries as well as evolutionary divergent patterns of PP2C gene
regulatory networks in dicots and monocots. Overall, our
study provides comprehensive information and novel
insights into the functions and regulatory mechanisms, as
well as the evolution and divergence of the PP2C genes in
dicots and monocots. The results presented here lay a
solid foundation for future studies on the functional
divergence of different PP2c subfamilies.

Conclusion
We provide here a comparative genome-wide overview of
the PP2C family of Arabidopsis and rice, one of the largest
gene families in plants. Our computational studies show
that despite the big differences in genome sizes of Arabidopsis and rice, the two species appear to have very similar numbers of genes encoding PP2C proteins (80 and 78,
respectively), which are much higher than in yeast and
human. The AtPP2Cs and Os PP2cs are divided into 13
and 11 subfamilies, respectively, each of which shares a
monophyletic origin, common protein motifs and intron/
exon structures. We identified both common and lineagespecific subfamilies and potential 'gene birth-and-death'
events in the PP2cs of these two species. Our analyses suggest that whole genome and chromosomal segment duplications mainly contributed to the expansion of both
OsPP2Cs and AtPP2Cs, but tandem or local duplication
occurred less frequently in Arabidopsis than rice. Our protein motif analysis detected the motifs widespread among
the PP2C proteins as well as the motifs specific to only
one or two subfamilies. Our computational and experimental expression analyses suggest that 1) most PP2C
genes play functional roles in multiple tissues in both species, 2) most genes in subfamily A play primary roles in
stress tolerance, especially ABA response, 3) subfamily D

Materials and methods
Identification of PP2C genes in Arabidopsis and rice
To collect all members of the PP2C gene family in Arabidopsis, an initial keyword search was performed using
"protein phosphatase 2C" to screen six databases, i.e.
NCBI [69], DATF [80], MAtDB [81], TAIR [60], TIGR [47]
and PlantsP [82]. The resulting protein hits were pooled
together and redundant sequences were removed using a
custom Perl program. Remaining proteins sequences were
then used as a query to perform multiple database
searches against proteome and genome files downloaded
from TAIR. Stand-alone versions of BLASTP and TBLASTN
available from NCBI were used with the e-value cutoff set
to 1e-003. After eliminating redundant sequences, the
obtained protein sequences were screened for the existence of a PP2C catalytic domain by the hidden Markov
model provided with the SMART [45] and Pfam [46]
tools. Proteins without a PP2C catalytic domain were
eliminated from the dataset.

To collect all members of the PP2C gene family in rice, all
predicted AtPP2C protein sequences were initially used as
query sequences to search against the TIGR rice database
[47] using BLASTP. Multiple BLAST searches using protein

sequences of significant hits as the queries were then performed in several rice databases, including NCBI [69],
TIGR [47], Rice Genome Database-japonica of the Rice
Genome Research Program [83] and the International
Rice Genome Sequencing Project (IRSGP) [84]. After
removal of redundant sequences from our data set,
SMART and Pfam were used to confirm the presence of
PP2C catalytic domains as described above.
Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of PP2C sequences
Multiple alignments of amino acid sequences were generated using ClustalX (1.83) and were manually corrected.
Phylogenetic trees were constructed by neighbor-joining
algorithms of Mega (4.0). Bootstrapping was performed
1000 times to obtain support values for each branch.
Chromosomal localization and duplication of PP2C genes
To determine the location of PP2C genes on the five Arabidopsis chromosomes, the Chromosome Map Tool from
TAIR was used [85]. Gene duplications and their presence

to the duplicated blocks map generated by Xiong et al.
[66].
Motifs identification of PP2C proteins in Arabidopsis and
rice
To identify motifs shared among related proteins within
PP2C gene family, we used the MEME motif search tool
[76] with default settings except that the maximum
number of motifs to find was defined as 20 and the maximum width was set to 300.
In silico expression analysis of PP2C genes
cDNA signatures from MPSS [68] and EST abundance
data from NCBI [87] were used to detect the expression
patterns of Arabidopsis and rice PP2C genes in different
organs. Microarray data from Genevestigiator [67] were
used to determine the expression profile of Arabidopsis
PP2C genes in different organs and under multiple environmental stimuli.

RT-PCR analysis of PP2C gene expression
Plant tissues of the rice japonica cultivar Nipponbare were
ground in liquid nitrogen. For reverse transcriptase (RT)
mediated PCR analysis, total RNA was isolated using the
Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. RNA preparations were then
treated with DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). First
strand cDNA synthesis was performed by using oligo (dT)
primer and M-MLV RT (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
PCR products were fractionated on 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and photographed under UV
light. These experiments were independently replicated at
least three times under identical conditions. Details of
primers are listed in the additional file 3.
Upstream sequences
A total of 32,041 1000-bp upstream sequences from Arabidopsis were downloaded from TAIR 7.0 [60]. All
upstream sequences that correspond to genes that do not
code for proteins or oligopeptides were discarded (5012

sequences). Then, the reverse complementary sequences
were obtained. The final database of Arabidopsis 1-kb
upstream sequences consisted of 54,058 individual
sequences. A database of 66,170 1000-bp upstream
sequences from rice was downloaded from TIGR 4.0 [47].
Upstream sequences were cleared of transposable elements and related gene models using the gene identifiers
of transposable-element-related gene models provided by
TIGR (15,424 gene identifiers). After obtaining reverse
complementary sequences, the file used for the screening
consisted of 82,144 sequences. The 1000-bp upstream
sequences of PP2C genes in subfamily A were extracted
from the final databases from Arabidopsis and rice.
Randomized sequences
Randomized sequences were generated by shuffling the
extracted upstream sequences using the EMBOSS program
"shuffleseq" [88]. During the shuffling procedure, the single-nucleotide frequency of each sequence is maintained,
but the nucleotide order is randomly shuffled. The reshuffling process was repeated 10 times to generate 10 different data sets of randomized 1-kb upstream sequences for
Arabidopsis and rice, respectively.
Searching single occurrences of CREs
The subfamily A, genomic and randomized data sets were
screened for single occurrences of CREs on the plus and
minus strands, using the frequency matrices and the program "Profit" from EMBOSS [88]. For each screened data
set the program generates a list of matches, including the
sequence identifier, element, score and position for every
match. The score is calculated from the frequency matrix.
An arbitrary 95% cut-off was used. The position of a
match is expressed in terms of the distance to the translation initiation codon (ATG).
