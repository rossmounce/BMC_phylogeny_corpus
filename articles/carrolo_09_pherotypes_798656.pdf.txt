Abstract
Background: The boundaries of bacterial species and the mechanisms underlying bacterial
speciation are matters of intense debate. Theoretical studies have shown that recombination acts
as a strong cohesive force preventing divergence in bacterial populations. Streptococcus pneumoniae
populations have the telltale signs of high recombination with competence implicated as the major
driving force behind gene exchange. Competence in S. pneumoniae is triggered by a quorum-sensing
mechanism controlled by the competence-stimulating peptide pheromone.
Results: We studied the distribution of the two major pherotypes in the pneumococcal population
and their association with serotype, antimicrobial resistance and genetic lineage. Using multilocus
sequence data we evaluated pherotype influence on the dynamics of horizontal gene transfer. We
show that pherotype is a clonal property of pneumococci. Standard population genetic analysis and
multilocus infinite allele model simulations support the hypothesis that two genetically
differentiated populations are defined by the major pherotypes.
Conclusion: Severe limitations to gene flow can therefore occur in bacterial species in the
absence of geographical barriers and within highly recombinogenic populations. This departure
from panmixia can have important consequences for our understanding of the response of
pneumococci to human imposed selective pressures such as vaccination and antibiotic use.

Background
Horizontal gene transfer and recombination, although
recognized as important mechanisms in the evolution of
certain phenotypes such as penicillin resistance in both
Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, were
considered to be rare [1,2]. Full genome sequences and
extensive surveys of bacterial populations using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) have challenged this view

and established the essential role of horizontal gene transfer and recombination in bacterial evolution, revealing
the high frequency of these events [3,4].
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is an important
human pathogen, taxonomically recognized as a group
within the pneumoniae-mitis-pseudopneumoniae cluster
of the Streptococcus genus [5]. The capacity of pneumoPage 1 of 10

cocci to undergo genetic transformation was recognized
early in the study of this bacterium [6] and it was later
found that competence presented the intriguing property
of being tightly controlled at the population level [7].
Competence was thus one of the first examples of a multicellular bacterial response coordinated by a diffusible
signal. These processes were later termed quorum-sensing
and found to be used by both Gram positive and Gram
negative bacteria to synchronize the switch of genetic programs simultaneously at the population level in order to
achieve goals that are unattainable by single cells [8]. Several molecules are used by bacteria to regulate their quorum-sensing mechanisms, with modified or unmodified
oligopeptides being used by Gram positive and Gramnegative bacteria [8]. In S. pneumoniae, a secreted unmodified 17-aminoacid peptide pheromone, termed the competence-stimulating peptide (CSP), is responsible for
quorum-sensing [9]. The product of the comC gene is
secreted and processed by an ABC transporter (ComAB)
resulting in the accumulation of CSP in the medium. A
two-component regulatory system consisting of a histidine kinase receptor (ComD) and its cognate response
regulator (ComE) are then responsible for sensing the
CSP concentration and triggering the competence
response.
In pneumococci several distinct mature CSPs have been
identified, although the vast majority of strains produce
one of two variants: CSP-1 or CSP-2 (also designated CSPα and CSP-β, respectively) [5,10-12]. Each different CSP
variant identifies a pherotype and strains genetically carrying one of the variants are mostly unable to respond to the
presence of the other signaling peptide, possibly due to
specificity of the ComD receptors for their cognate CSP
alleles [10,11].
Competent bacteria will recognize and bind naked double
stranded DNA fragments present in their environment,
and translocate these fragments in a single stranded form
across the membrane and into the cytoplasm. A number
of genes facilitating recombination of the incoming DNA
with the bacterial chromosome are also upregulated at
competence, favoring the integration of the foreign DNA
fragment that may permanently change the cell genotype
and phenotype [9]. Competent cells are also endowed
with the capacity to kill non-competent pneumococci in a
mechanism named fratricide [13,14] and this may be a
key property for transformation in vivo by providing a
source of free DNA.
Pneumococcal fratricide is committed by cells that are
competent and thus able to lyse non-competent siblings
[13,15-17] with the concomitant release of DNA that will
become available for transformation. The existence of two
predominant pherotypes in S. pneumoniae and the docu-

mented occurrence of co-colonization [18,19], led to the
proposal of two contrasting models of the pherotype
impact on genetic exchange [15]. In the first model, the
lack of inter-pherotype communication prevents genetic
exchange between phenotypes favoring genetic differentiation [20,21]. The second model is based on the proposal
that the absence of inter-pherotype cross-activation would
result in a race for competence activation with the winning phenotype inducing the lysis of cells belonging to
the other pherotype [22]. The latter would result in a more
frequent exchange of genetic information between different pherotype lineages that is assumed to result in
enhanced genetic diversity of pneumococci.
The human host is the only natural ecological niche of all
pneumococcal strains where they are exposed to the same
environmental insults and share very similar lifestyles. We
propose that limitations to lateral gene transfer, through a
kind of "assortative mating" promoted by the existence of
two pherotypes, is creating genetically differentiated subpopulations within S. pneumoniae.

Results and discussion
Pherotype distribution among the pneumococcal
population
Traditionally, pneumococcal strains have been characterized by their capsular polysaccharide (serotype) of which
pneumococci produce 91 chemically and immunologically distinct variants [23]. Although it has been shown
that the serotype defines important epidemiological and
virulence properties of pneumococcal isolates [24], it is
also recognized that each serotype comprises different
clones that may present different properties [25].

The collection of 483 invasive pneumococcal isolates was
characterized for the comC allele (pherotype) carried by
each isolate. All isolates could be classified either as CSP1 or as CSP-2 and, in agreement with previous findings,
most presented the CSP-1 pherotype (70.6%) [see Additional file 1 - Table S1]. The data was analyzed to determine if the pherotypes were randomly distributed among
the population or if there were associations with particular characteristics of the isolates, namely serotype, antibiotic resistance and the genetic lineages identified by
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiling and
MLST.
As a first approximation we used the Wallace coefficient
(W) [26,27]. W provides an estimate of the probability of
two strains sharing the same pherotype if they share
another characteristic such as serotype or being classified
in the same PFGE cluster. Table 1 shows the W values
obtained, indicating that isolates sharing the same serotype have a high probability of belonging to the same pherotype (W = 0.730) and this probability is higher if the

isolates belong to the same PFGE cluster (W = 0.771).
Both values are significantly different from the expected
values in case of a random association between pherotype
and either of these two characteristics (Wi = 0.584), demonstrating that pherotypes are not randomly dispersed
within the pneumococcal population.
To determine if individual serotypes and PFGE clusters
were significantly enriched in isolates presenting each
pherotype, odds ratios (OR) were calculated. A total of
five serotypes are significantly associated with either one
of the pherotypes (Table 2 and see Additional file 1 - Table
S1). The high Wallace values suggest that pherotype/serotype association is not only due to these five serotypes.
Many serotypes are present in insufficient numbers to
reach a significant odds ratio. By simultaneously looking
at each pair of strains the Wallace statistic has an increased
power to detect associations. Serotypes 1 and 14 are
strongly associated with CSP-1 whereas serotypes 3, 6A
and 9N show an association with CSP-2. The same
approach was used to determine if pherotypes were associated with particular PFGE clusters within each serotype,
aiming to subdivide serotypes into closely related genetic
lineages. Five PFGE clusters showed association with a
particular pherotype [see Additional file 2 - Table S2]. Of
these, the largest PFGE clusters within serotypes 1, 3, 9N
and 14 maintained the same association found between

aOdds ratio (OR) describes the strength of the association between a
pherotype and a particular serotype. In each case, if the OR is

these serotypes and pherotype. Possibly due to the small
number of isolates in each PFGE cluster, none of the clusters expressing serotype 6A was significantly associated
with either pherotype, in contrast with the association
found between this serotype and CSP-2. On the other
hand, serotype 4 presents one PFGE cluster that was significantly associated with CSP-2, whereas no association
was found at the serotype level possibly as a consequence
of the largest cluster of serotype 4 being mainly CSP-1 [see
Additional file 2 - Table S2]. Taken together the data suggest that pherotype is a clonal property that may vary
independently of the serotype.
MLST is a sequence based approach that uses the sequence
of internal fragments of housekeeping genes for the purpose of characterizing, typing, and classifying members of
bacterial populations. The data derived from MLST can
also be used to study the population genetics of bacteria
such as Streptococcus pneumoniae [28]. Applying eBURST to
MLST data originates subnetworks of isolates with
increased probability of sharing a recent common ancestor. These subnetworks define clonal complexes as groups
of isolates that share the alleles at no less than six loci with
at least another member of that group [29]. MLST from 90
selected strains [30] revealed 57 different sequence types
grouped into 39 distinct clonal complexes. The ability of
sequence type and clonal complex to predict the pherotype is remarkably high, both with W > 0.97 (Table 1).
PFGE and MLST are widely used tools to define bacterial
clones, the fact that the groups defined by both these
methods show such strong correspondence with pherotype further strengthen the indication that pherotype is a
clonal property within the pneumococcal population.
A consistent hypothesis with pherotype clonality is that
the role of CSP in triggering competence and its consequences on lateral gene transfer is itself responsible for the
distribution of the pherotypes in the pneumococcal population. If this hypothesis is correct and the pherotype is
indeed restricting gene transfer within the pneumococcal
population, genes that are under recent strong selective
pressure and that are known to be horizontally transferred
should be associated with pherotype.
Pherotype and antibiotic resistance
To test our hypothesis, we checked if there was an association between antibiotic resistance and pherotype. Resistance to several antibiotics in pneumococcus was shown to
be mediated by the acquisition of foreign DNA that has
subsequently spread within the pneumococcal population [31]. Emergence of resistance in pneumococci and its
dissemination in the population is postulated to have
occurred since their widespread use in clinical practice in
the late 1940s. The results in Table 3 indicate that there
was an association of most antibiotics (with the exception

a Odds ratio (OR) measures the strength of the association between a pherotype and resistance to a particular antibiotic. In each case, if OR is
significantly > 1, CSP-1 is associated with resistance to that antibiotic and if OR is significantly < 1 this means that CSP-2 is associated with
resistance to that particular antibiotic.

of erythromycin) with a particular pherotype. Isolates
resistant to penicillin and other β-lactams were associated
with CSP-1. It is known that resistance to β-lactams was
acquired from closely related species of the mitis complex
and that genes encoding resistance are transferred within
the pneumococcal population by genetic recombination
[31]. The fact that penicillin resistant isolates are more frequently CSP-1 suggests that, in addition to the expansion
of resistant clones, current gene flow occurs primarily
between isolates that share the same pherotype.
The relationship between pherotype and restriction/
modification systems
Another important mechanism of lateral gene transfer is
bacteriophage transduction [32]. This is an especially
important mechanism for the transfer of large DNA fragments that may be restricted in transformation. This is for
instance the case of the locus encoding the capsular
polysaccharide biosynthesis machinery and of some of
the genetic determinants of resistance to tetracycline,
chloramphenicol or erythromycin, that are large composite transposons unable to transfer by conjugation, leaving
phage transduction as the most likely mechanism of dissemination in the bacterial population, similarly to what
was described in other streptococci [33].

Transduction should be independent of CSP activity, but
the presence of restriction/modification (R/M) systems
was shown to impair horizontal transfer through this
mechanism [34]. Pneumococci are unusual in that they
posses either one of two complementary R/M systems
located in interchangeable genetic cassettes. Strains of S.
pneumoniae contain either the dpnI cassete, containing an
endonuclease that cleaves only the methylated DNAsequence 5'GmeATC3' or the dpnII cassette, which
includes an endonuclease that cleaves the same sequence
when not methylated, together with the corresponding
methylase. These mutually exclusive R/M systems were

shown to protect against viral infection by viruses produced in cells of the opposite genotype, reducing infection frequency to < 10-5 [35].
The R/M cassette has a size compatible with horizontal
transfer by transformation, so we wondered if the distribution of the R/M cassettes could be correlated to the pherotype and thereby contribute to promote asymmetries of
horizontal gene transfer within the pneumococcal population.
To pursue this hypothesis, the R/M cassette carried by
pneumococcal isolates previously characterized by MLST
was determined. The proportion of CSP-2 isolates with
the dpnII cassette (3/23) is lower than the proportion of
CSP-1 isolates with that same cassette (25/67) and the
association between pherotype and the R/M system is significant (p = 0.037, Fisher exact test), suggesting that
phage transduction may be indirectly arbitrated by the
pherotype via the R/M systems, such that the spread of
large genetic elements that rely on this mechanism of horizontal gene transfer could also be limited by pherotype.
Pherotype is a marker of population segregation
MLST data has been used to characterize the clonality of
bacterial populations and to explore the impact of recombination and mutation in bacterial evolution [4]. For S.
pneumoniae the recombination rate has been estimated to
be 3-10 times the mutation rate per locus [28,36]. To test
if the pherotype could be limiting the genetic exchanges
within pneumococci, we took the simple approach of testing among all pairs of sequence types that diverge at the
allele of a single locus (single-locus variants - SLV) and
that should represent the initial stages of diversification
dominated by recombination, if the allele that differed
was more frequent among sequence types sharing the
same pherotype or among isolates of a different pherotype. Considering the observed SLV pairs in our study, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/191

probability that the changing allele came from a different
pherotype is 0.11. In a panmictic population, the expected
probability would be 0.38 (p < 10-4, permutation test),
again suggesting that recombination between pherotypes
is reduced.
To test if the populations defined by each pherotype
showed genetic differentiation we analyzed the concatenated sequences of six of the genes used in MLST, excluding ddl since it was previously shown that this gene
showed a hitchhiking effect with pbp2b involved in penicillin resistance[37] and could thus bias the results. Out of
143 mutations in 142 polymorphic sites, 66 were shared
between the two pherotype defined populations, 63 were
polymorphic in the CSP-1 population but monomorphic
in the CSP-2 population and 14 were polymorphic in
CSP-2 but monomorphic in CSP-1. To estimate the level
of gene flow and whether pherotype defined diverging
populations, the classic FST parameter [38], the K*ST statistic [39] and the more powerful nearest-neighbor statistic
Snn [40] were used. The FST, K*ST and Snn statistics are
measures of population differentiation based on the
number of differences between haplotypes. The statistical
significance of both the K*ST and Snn statistics were evaluated by permutation. The data in Table 4 shows that statistically significant K*ST values (p < 0.01) were obtained
not only for the analysis of the concatenated sequences
but also for most of the individual genes. The more sensitive Snn statistic presented significant values (p < 0.01) for
the analysis of the concatenated sequence as well as for all
individual genes.
A different approach to test if the pherotype is a marker of
genetic isolation consists of calculating the probability
that pairs of isolates with increasing levels of genetic divergence have of belonging to different pherotypes. Figure 1
shows that the closest pairs of isolates have a significantly
lower probability of having different pherotypes. When
genetic divergence increases, the probability of differing in
pherotype also increases, reaching the levels expected by

chance when isolates differ in more than three alleles.
Again, these results show that isolates that are phylogenetically closely linked have an increased likelihood of sharing the same pherotype.
Infinite allele model
The structured nature of the pneumococcal population
and the geographically limited origin of our sample could
explain, at least partially, the segregation of pherotypes
seen in Figure 1 and the high Wallace indices of Table 1.
To address this issue a MLST infinite allele model was
used to test the effect of restricting or promoting recombination between the two pherotype defined subpopulations. This modeling approach was previously shown to
reproduce the clonal structure of the pneumococcal population [36,41] and provides a possibly more realistic null
hypothesis for the distribution of phenotypes in the population. The model was expanded to include a new locus
with two possible alleles: CSP-1 and CSP-2. This extra
locus recombines with the same rate as the MLST loci and
the frequency of each allele is kept constant and equal to
70 and 30% of CSP-1 and CSP-2 respectively, corresponding to the observed values in natural populations. Addi-

tionally, a new parameter IPR was introduced, that
controls the probability of inter-pherotype recombination. If pherotype differences would not prevent or promote recombination, the observed frequencies of each
pherotype in the population would lead to a probability
of inter-pherotype recombination of 0.42. Figure 2A
shows that even in the absence of a pherotype effect on
recombination, high Wallace values of clonal complex
predicting pherotype are expected. This result is intuitive
since the recent common ancestry of strains belonging to
the same clonal complex would also cause them to share
the same pherotype. Still, there is a marked shift to higher
Wallace values when the probability of inter-pherotype
recombination decreases (IPR = 0.1 in Figure 2A). On the
other hand, if genetic exchange between pherotypes is
favored, in spite of their different prevalence in the population (IPR = 0.9 in Figure 2A), a shift towards lower
WCC→ST values is observed. When systematically varying
IPR and computing the probability density for the
observed Wallace coefficients (Figure 2B), one concludes
that a value of 0.2 is 2-3 times more likely to explain the
observed values than an IPR of 0.42, expected in case of
no CSP effect in recombination. Since the more probable
IPR is lower than expected if the two pherotype populations were recombining freely, these results strengthen the

proposal that recombination is promoted within individuals sharing the same pherotype, promoting the divergence of two subpopulations of S. pneumoniae.

Conclusion
In agreement with previous suggestions [14,20,21], we
propose that the specific ComC/ComD match facilitates a
form of assortative genetic exchange, which could maintain genetically diverse subpopulations within this species. Although recent studies addressing the phenomenon
of fratricide in pneumococci favor the hypothesis of preferential inter-pherotype genetic exchange [42], the data
presented here argues that in natural populations intrapherotype exchanges prevail, creating a barrier to gene
exchange. In vitro studies that led to the fratricide hypothesis show that if two pneumococcal strains with different
pherotypes are grown together, the one that becomes
competent earlier will have a greater probability of being
transformed with DNA from the other strain [42]. In order
to observe the impact of this admixture promoting event
in pneumococcal natural populations, frequent and adequate co-colonization events involving different pherotypes must occur. On the other hand, fratricide has also
been observed in experiments with a single strain [13].

Probability density function of Wallace values for simulated populations
Probability density function of Wallace values for simulated populations. Multilocus sequence types of a pneumococcal population were generated with an adapted infinite allele model [36]. It includes an additional locus for CSP type and a
new parameter IPR that, given a recombination event, defines the probability that the two recombining strains have different
pherotypes. The prevalence of each pherotype in the population was fixed during the simulation at 70% for CSP-1 and 30% for
CSP-2. (A) From 1,000 simulations, the probability density functions of Wallace values for Clonal Complex predicting pherotype were computed for three scenarios: (1) pherotype is a barrier to recombination (IPR = 0.1, red line), (2) pherotype has no
impact in gene exchange (equivalent to IPR = 0.42, black dashed line) and (3) inter-pherotype recombination is favored (IPR =
0.9, green dotted line). The vertical blue line indicates the observed Wallace value in the studied sample. (B) To identify the
value of the IPR parameter that is in best agreement with the data, the probability density at the observed Wallace values was
computed for simulated populations with varying inter-pherotype recombination probabilities (IPR from 0.1 to 0.9), both for
Wallace indexes of sequence type (blue line) and of clonal complex (red line) predicting pherotype.

is rare or inadequate to promote gene exchange, it is possible to reconcile the inter-pherotype fratricide observations with the pherotype defined genetic differentiation
identified here. The observed genetic barrier would then
be justified if co-colonization events involving different
strains of the same pherotype are more frequent or more
adequate for recombination, leaving intra-pherotype fratricide and genetic exchange as the most common event in
natural populations.
All the isolates analyzed were recovered in Portugal from
invasive infections and it is therefore unlikely that geographic or ecological fragmentation could explain the pattern observed. The model simulations also exclude the
possibility that our observation results simply from the
structure of the pneumococcal population, with multiple
isolates sharing the same genotype or with a recent common ancestry. It would also be plausible to assume that
the CSP-2 population was recently established by introduction of a novel pherotype into pneumococci. This
would result in the genome wide differentiation observed,
but if it had occurred recently it would also cause lower
haplotype diversity in the CSP-2 population, that the data
does not support. Furthermore, the CSP-2 pherotype was
found in multiple serotypes and clones, including strains
differing in the alleles of up to five of the seven genes used
in the pneumococcal MLST scheme. These observations
support an ancient origin of the CSP-2 pherotype that
would have allowed sufficient time for the coalescence of
the two pherotype defined populations due to the high
recombination of pneumococci.
Although only invasive strains were used in the present
study, a comparison of previous studies [30,44] indicates
that clones found causing invasive infections are also
found among the most prevalent in carriage, meaning that
the results described here are also expected to be valid for
the overall pneumococcal population in Portugal.
The concept of allopatric speciation follows the intuitive
rationale that genetic divergence subsequent to geographic isolation could lead to the emergence of different
species [45]. In bacteria, this has been connected with the
concept of ecotypes [46], arising as a consequence of a single clone expanding into a new niche. These events have
been implicated in the emergence of human pathogens
from environmental or commensal species, such as the
rise of Yersinia pestis or Mycobacterium tuberculosis from
within the Yersinia and mycobacteria respectively [47].
But genetic differentiation in microorganisms was also

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/191

shown to occur mainly as a result of geographic barriers,
such as that of the wild yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus [48].
In the absence of ecological isolation, a process of sympatric speciation, shown to occur in sexual eukaryotes [45], is
deemed unlikely in bacteria due to the occurrence of
recombination. In fact, theoretical studies have shown
that if recombination is more frequent than mutation, the
"cohesive force of recombination" is an effective barrier to
divergence and to bacterial speciation [49,50]. This
received further support from the recent observation of an
accelerated convergence of species within the Campylobacter genus proposed to be caused by the breakdown of
ecological or geographical barriers and the effect of
recombination [51].
Pneumococci are generally considered a sexual population due to the dominant role of recombination in the
evolution of this species [49]. It was therefore surprising
to find that two genetically distinct subpopulations could
be identified. Extensive sequence divergence, previously
shown to be a major barrier to gene exchange [52], could
not be implicated as attested by the low π values and the
fact that 66 out of the 143 mutations were shared between
the two pherotype populations. Interestingly, the existence of three differentiated subpopulations within pneumococci, with different rates of admixture, was recently
inferred using a Bayesian method of population analysis
[53], but no explanation for this differentiation was presented.
We propose that "assortative mating" mediated by different pherotypes and ongoing genetic drift may be driving
an incipient speciation process within S. pneumoniae. Our
data support theoretical predictions that the existence of
barriers to recombination allow the accumulation of significant genetic drift, even within highly recombinogenic
bacterial species. An understanding of these mechanisms
and their consequences offer further insights into the evolution of bacterial pathogens and may allow more
informed predictions on the consequences of human
interventions such as antibiotic use and vaccination on
bacterial populations.
Addendum in proof
We recently became aware of a study (Omar Cornejo, personal communication) that has addressed the same issue
discussed here. In contrast to our findings, the authors
failed to detect any differentiation between the two pherotype defined populations. The reasons behind this discrepancy of results is not clear and further studies are
needed to reconcile these apparently contradictory findings.

Methods
Bacterial strains, growth conditions, PFGE and MLST
A collection of 483 invasive pneumococcal isolates recovered during the period of 1999 to 2002 in Portugal were
obtained from the Faculdade de Medicina de Lisboa collection. The serotype, PFGE type, MLST characterization
and antibiotic susceptibility of these strains were collected
from previous studies[25,30,54]. Briefly, all S. pneumoniae
strains were grown in a casein-based semi-synthetic
medium (C+Y) at 37°C without aeration or in tryptic soy
agar (TSA) (Oxoid, Hampshire, England) supplemented
with 5% (v/v) sterile sheep blood incubated at 37°C in
5% CO2. Antimicrobial susceptibility, serotyping and
PFGE analysis was performed for all isolates. MLST analysis was performed for at least one isolate in each major
PFGE cluster (n = 90) and revealed 57 different sequence
types (ST) corresponding to 39 different lineages by
eBURST analysis.
Detection of the pherotype and endonuclease restriction
phenotype by PCR
CSP-1 and CSP-2 gene fragments were amplified using
multiplex PCR with primers CSP_up (5'-TGA AAA ACA
CAG TTA AAT TGG AAC-3'), CSP1_dn (5'-TCA AGA AAG
GAT AAA GGT AGT CCT C-3') and CSP2 _dn (5'-TAA AAA
TCT TTC AAT CCC TAT TT-3'), which allowed the amplification of fragments of 620 bp for the CSP-1 allele and
340 bp for the CSP-2 allele. dpnI and dpnII genotype was
also detected by multiplex PCR with primers DpnI_up (5'GAA GTA GGA GAT AAA TTG CCA GAG), DpnII_up (5'TAC GAA TGA TGG GAA TAC TGT G-3') and Dpn_dn (5'TGT CCT CAA TGC CGT ATT AAA TC-3'), with the
expected products of 342 bp and 421 bp for dpnI and
dpnII, respectively. Template DNA was prepared by diluting 9 μl of an overnight culture in 441 μl of water and
boiling this mixture for 2 minutes. The PCR reactions were
performed in 50 μl of final volume containing 20 μl of
template solution, 1× reaction buffer (Biotools, Madrid,
Spain), 10 mM dNTPs (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania), 20
pmol of each of the primers and 1.25 U GoTaq Polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California). The same PCR program was used consisting of 30 cycles of denaturation at
95°C for 1 min, annealing at 55°C for 30 sec, and primer
extension at 72°C for 1 min. Followed by 10 min incubation at 72°C to complete extension.
Data analysis
Statistical association between serotypes, PFGE clusters,
antimicrobial resistance or endonuclease restriction phenotype and pherotype where characterized by odds ratios
(OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) computed
through the Fisher method implemented in the epitools
package for the R language. OR significance was evaluated
with the Fisher exact test. The resulting p-values were corrected for multiple testing by controlling the False Discov-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/191

ery Rate (FDR) under or equal to 0.05 through the linear
procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg [55].
Wallace coefficients (W) and respective 95% confidence
intervals were computed as previously described [26,27].
The relationship between cross-pherotype pair frequency
and the number of divergent alleles between STs was validated for statistical significance by permutation tests. The
latter consisted in repeating the computation of frequencies of cross-pherotype strain pairs for 1,000 times, randomly shuffling the pherotype assignment of the strains
before each repetition. The p-values were obtained from
the fraction of the 1,000 random runs where the crosspherotype pair frequency was lower than the respective
values with the correct pherotype assignment. A permutation test was also performed to evaluate the significance of
the probability that a divergent allele in an SLV pair was
donated from a strain with a different pherotype. In this
case, in each of the 1,000 runs, the divergent allele was
randomly sampled from the corresponding locus in the
collection of STs. The determination of π, FST, K*ST and Snn
for the analysis of sequence data was done using the
DNASP v4.50.3 program. The values of K*ST and Snn were
used to assess population differentiation in combination
with permutation tests (1,000 permutations).
Neutral Multilocus Infinite Allele Model
The model presented by Fraser et al. [36] was expanded to
include an additional CSP locus and a new IPR parameter.
The CSP locus has only two possible alleles, CSP-1 and
CSP-2 that can interchange by recombination but are not
affected by mutations. The parameter IPR defines the
inter-pherotype recombination probability. The model
was simulated with the parameter values determined in
[36] for the pneumococcal population. Namely, the population size was 1,000, the population mutation and
recombination rates were 5.3 and 17.3, respectively. All
the analyses were repeated with a population recombination rate reduced in 50% and the results were qualitatively
similar. All simulations were run for 1,000 generations,
after which the sequence type diversity was stable, as
measured by the Simpson's index of diversity [56]. At each
generation, 70% of the selected individuals were CSP-1
and 30% were CSP-2. For each value of parameter IPR,
1,000 independent simulations were carried out. Wallace
coefficients for ST and CC predicting CSP type were calculated for each of the final 1,000 populations. Probability
density functions for the Wallace distributions were determined by kernel density estimation with a Gaussian kernel function. All simulations and computations were
done in Matlab version 7.7.
