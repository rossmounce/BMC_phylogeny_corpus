Constraint-based modeling analysis of the
metabolism of two Pelobacter species
Jun Sun1*, Shelley A Haveman2,3, Olivia Bui1, Tom R Fahland1,4, Derek R Lovley2

Abstract
Background: Pelobacter species are commonly found in a number of subsurface environments, and are unique
members of the Geobacteraceae family. They are phylogenetically intertwined with both Geobacter and
Desulfuromonas species. Pelobacter species likely play important roles in the fermentative degradation of unusual
organic matters and syntrophic metabolism in the natural environments, and are of interest for applications in
bioremediation and microbial fuel cells.
Results: In order to better understand the physiology of Pelobacter species, genome-scale metabolic models for
Pelobacter carbinolicus and Pelobacter propionicus were developed. Model development was greatly aided by the
availability of models of the closely related Geobacter sulfurreducens and G. metallireducens. The reconstructed P.
carbinolicus model contains 741 genes and 708 reactions, whereas the reconstructed P. propionicus model contains
661 genes and 650 reactions. A total of 470 reactions are shared among the two Pelobacter models and the two
Geobacter models. The different reactions between the Pelobacter and Geobacter models reflect some unique
metabolic capabilities such as fermentative growth for both Pelobacter species. The reconstructed Pelobacter
models were validated by simulating published growth conditions including fermentations, hydrogen production
in syntrophic co-culture conditions, hydrogen utilization, and Fe(III) reduction. Simulation results matched well with
experimental data and indicated the accuracy of the models.
Conclusions: We have developed genome-scale metabolic models of P. carbinolicus and P. propionicus. These
models of Pelobacter metabolism can now be incorporated into the growing repertoire of genome scale models of
the Geobacteraceae family to aid in describing the growth and activity of these organisms in anoxic environments
and in the study of their roles and interactions in the subsurface microbial community.

Background
Pelobacter species are commonly found in a number of
natural environments, including marine sediments [1],
muds [2], soils [3], and hydrocarbon-containing environments [4-6]. They likely play important roles in syntrophic degradation of organic matter in these natural
environments and are of interest for applications in
bioremediation and microbial fuel cells. Pelobacter species and members of Geobacter, Desulfuromonas and
Desulfuromusa genera in the deltaproteobacteria form
the monophyletic family Geobacteraceae, which can be
divided into two distinct subgroups of the Geobacter
and Desulfuromonas clusters [7-9]. The Pelobacter species are phylogenetically intertwined with both clusters:

Pelobacter carbinolicus is within the Desulfuromonas
cluster whereas Pelobacter propionicus is within the
Geobacter cluster [7,9,10].
P. carbinolicus and P. propionicus are both strict anaerobes that have distinct physiologies compared with the
Geobacter and Desulfuromonas species. P. carbinolicus
was first isolated from marine muds whereas P. propionicus was first isolated from freshwater sediments and
sewage sludge [6]. Both can grow by fermentation of
2,3-butanediol and acetoin in which the fermentation
products are ethanol and acetate for P. carbinolicus, and
propionate and acetate for P. propionicus [6]. In addition, both Pelobacter species can grow with ethanol,
propanol, or butanol under specific conditions [6].
Like Geobacter and Desulfuromonas species, Pelobacter
species have the capacity of using S0 as an electron acceptor [7,10]. However, Pelobacter species only incompletely

oxidize organic substrates with this electron acceptor, in
contrast to the ability of Geobacter and Desulfuromonas
species to completely oxidize acetate and other organic
electron donors to carbon dioxide [7,10,11]. For example,
P. carbinolicus only incompletely oxidizes ethanol to acetate with S0 reduction [10].
Unlike Geobacter and Desulfuromonas species, P. carbinolicus lacks most of the c-type cytochromes [12],
which are essential for optimal electron transfer to Fe
(III) in Geobacter sulfurreducens [13-16]. P. carbinolicus
reduces Fe(III) via an indirect mechanism in which elemental sulfur is reduced to sulfide and the sulfide
reduces Fe(III) with the regeneration of elemental sulfur, contrasting with the direct reduction of Fe(III) for
Geobacter species [17]. Furthermore, whereas the Geobacter and Desulfuromonas species can transfer electrons to the anodes of microbial fuel cells to produce
current, P. carbinolicus could not [18]. Thus, the Pelobacter species are regarded as primarily fermentative/
syntrophic species, whereas the Geobacter and Desulfuromonas species are primarily respiratory species. Comparative genomic studies have suggested that the
common ancestor of Pelobacter, Geobacter, and Desulfuromonas species was a respiratory microorganism and
that Pelobacter species evolved to fill fermentative and
syntrophic niches (4).
Pelobacter and Geobacter species can be closely associated in subsurface environments [19,20]. In microbial
fuel cells, a coculture of P. carbinolicus and G. sulfurreducens produced current with ethanol as the fuel, under
conditions in which current could not be produced by
either microorganism alone [18]. Genome-based experimental and computational techniques offer the possibility of predictive modeling microbial physiology and
microbial communities [21]. Genome-based analysis of
Geobacter species resulted in two constraint-based genome-scale metabolic models [22,23], which were applied
in many studies to accelerate our understanding of Geobacter species and their applications [24-29]. The genome sequence of P. carbinolicus DSM2380 and
P. propionicus DSM2379 have been completed http://
www.jgi.doe.gov. Because of the similarities and differences in metabolic capabilities between Pelobacter and
Geobacter species, in silico modeling of these two Pelobacter species will provide insight into their metabolism.
In this report, the developments of genome-scale metabolic models of P. carbinolicus and P. propionicus are
described. These models of Pelobacter metabolism can
now be incorporated into the growing repertoire of genome scale models of the Geobacteraceae family to aid in
describing the growth and activity of these organisms in
anoxic environments and in the study of their roles and
interactions in the subsurface microbial community.

Methods
Strains and culture conditions

P. carbinolicus DSM 2380 was cultured at 30°C under
strictly anaerobic conditions as previously described
[12]. Fermentative cultures were grown in chemostats in
bioreactor at dilution rates of 0.03 to 0.06 h -1 with
5 mM acetoin in the medium. Cell growth on acetoin
was monitored by measuring the optical density at
600 nm with a Genesys 2 spectrophotometer (Spectronic
Instruments, Rochester, NY). Cell dry weight was determined gravimetrically after drying at 105°C for 24 h.
Analytical measurements

Concentrations of acetoin, acetate, and ethanol were
determined with high-pressure liquid chromatography
(HPLC) using an LC-10ATVP HPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto,
Japan) equipped with an Aminex HPX-87 H column
(300 by 7.8 mm; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), with 8 mM
H2SO4 eluent. Acetate was detected with an SPD-10VP
UV detector (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) set at 210 nm.
Ethanol and acetoin were quantified with an RID-10A
refractive index detector (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Protein concentrations were determined with the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method [30] with bovine serum
albumin as standard.
Metabolic network reconstruction

The Pelobacter metabolic networks were reconstructed
according to previously published procedures [23]. The
reconstruction was carried out in SimPheny [31,32]
(Genomatica, Inc., CA) from the annotated open reading
frames (ORFs) encoded in the Pelobacter genomes. The
Pelobacter genomes and the genomes of several highquality genome-scale metabolic models were analyzed
using the sequence similarity search (BLAST), and the
BLAST results were utilized to create draft models that
served to accelerate the reconstruction of the genomescale metabolic models. The reactions and genes in the
draft models were manually reviewed using the gene
annotations and the available biochemical and physiological information. Biomass compositions in the published G. sulfurreducens model were used to create the
biomass demand reactions in both reconstructed Pelobacter models. The resulting networks were then subjected to the gap filling process to allow biomass
formation under physiological growth conditions. For
gap filling, simulations were performed to determine if
the networks could synthesize every biomass component
and the missing reactions in the pathways were identified. These reactions were reviewed for gene association,
or added as non-gene associated reactions to enable the
formation of biomass by the reconstructed networks
under physiological conditions. Experimental data were

Sun et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4:174
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/4/174

collected from published literature or generated in the
laboratory, and were applied to validate model simulation results that predict growth and products under corresponding physiological conditions. Model simulations
were also used to generate experimentally testable
hypotheses and predictions. The experimental findings
accordingly were in turn used to further refine and
expand the metabolic models in an iterative process.
The detailed list of genes, reactions, metabolites, and
gene-protein-reaction (GPR) associations in the metabolic model are available as additional files.

results. All other external metabolites were only allowed
to leave the system. To simulate physiological conditions, experimental data were used as constraints for
flux optimization. Growth simulations were carried out
for: 1) optimal growth where biomass synthesis was
selected as the objective function to be maximized with
substrate uptake rate fixed; or 2) optimal substrate utilization where the substrate uptake rate was chosen as
the objective function to be minimized with the growth
rate fixed.

Results and Discussion
Determination of energy parameters of the metabolic
model

Energy parameters of the P. carbinolicus metabolic
model including growth-associated maintenance (GAM)
energy and non-growth associated maintenance
(nGAM) energy were determined using four sets of
experimental data obtained in chemostats of P. carbinolicus during acetoin fermentation at dilution rates of
0.03 to 0.06 h-1. The experimental data including acetoin uptake rates and acetate production rates were used
as constraints to simulate fermentative growth where
the ATP maintenance requirement reaction was selected
as the objective function to be maximized. The maximum ATP production rates were calculated and plotted
against the dilution rates as described earlier [33]. The
linear regression of the plot resulted in an equation:
q ATP = a ×  + b

where qATP is the ATP production rate and μ is the
dilution rate. The intercept b represents nGAM, the
ATP requirement at zero growth, whereas the slope a
represents GAM, the ATP requirement for growth.
GAM was then incorporated into the biomass demand
equation, and nGAM was utilized for all further growth
simulations.
For the P. propionicus metabolic model, the same biomass demand equation including GAM was applied.
The nGAM was estimated using P. propionicus fermentative growth yields with 6 different substrates [6].
In silico analysis of metabolism

The metabolic capabilities of the Pelobacter models were
calculated using flux balance analysis through linear
optimization [34] in SimPheny. The simulations resulted
in flux values in units of mmol/g dry weight (gdw)/h.
All simulations were of anaerobic growth on minimal
media, where the following external metabolites were
allowed to freely enter and leave the network: CO2, H+,
H2O, K+, Mg2+, NH4+, PO43-, and SO42-. The electron
donors or electron acceptors tested were allowed a maximum uptake rate into the network as specified in the

Metabolic network reconstruction

The P. carbinolicus draft model was built with base
models including previously published Geobacter sulfurreducens [22], Escherichia coli [34], and Bacillus subtilis
[35] models. The P. propionicus draft model was prepared with the above base models plus the completed
P. carbinolicus and Geobacter metallireducens [23] models. The origin of reactions in the draft models closely
reflected the phylogenetic relationships among the species [7]. For example, reactions in the P. propionicus
draft model originating from the G. sulfurreducens, G.
metallireducens, and P. carbinolicus models were 40%,
31%, and 14%, respectively, consistent with the fact that
P. propionicus is more closely related to G. sulfurreducens and G. metallireducens than to P. carbinolicus [7].
The reactions and their gene associations in the draft
models of P. carbinolicus and P. propionicus were evaluated manually based on gene annotations, published biochemical and physiological information and external
references as previously described [23]. One important
metabolic characteristic of Pelobacter species is their fermentative growth on acetoin [6]. During acetoin fermentation, acetoin is degraded into acetaldehyde and
acetyl-CoA by the acetoin:2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol
(DCPIP) oxidoreductase [36,37]. The acetoin:DCPIP oxidoreductase was purified and characterized in P. carbinolicus [38] and was encoded by the acoA, acoB, acoC,
and acoL genes [37]. In the reconstructed Pelobacter
networks, the reaction was associated with the acoA
(Pcar_0343 & Ppro_1131), acoB (Pcar_0344 &
Ppro_1132), acoC (Pcar_0345 & Ppro_1133), and acoL
(Pcar_0347 & Ppro_1137) genes. In the P. carbinolicus
model, the resulting acetaldehyde is reduced to ethanol
by alcohol dehydrogenase, whereas acetyl-CoA is converted into acetate by phosphate acetyltransferase and
acetate kinase (Pcar_2542 & Pcar_2543) generating
ATP, as described previously [36]. In the P. propionicus
model, acetaldehyde is oxidized to acetyl-CoA by acetaldehyde CoA dehydrogenase (Ppro_0899 or Ppro_1923),
and acetyl-CoA is then converted into propionate in a
pathway through pyruvate, oxaloacetate, malate, fumarate, succinate, succinyl-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA, and

Sun et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4:174
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/4/174

propionyl-CoA [39]. The key enzyme in this pathway,
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, was associated with genes
Ppro_1367 & Ppro_1368. Reactions and their associated
genes for fermentative growth on other substrates were
also evaluated. Transportation of neutral molecules such
as acetoin, 2,3-butanediol, and other alcohols were
assumed to be energy free through reversible diffusion.
P. propionicus ferments both ethanol and lactate to acetate and propionate at an approximately 1:2 ratio via
methylmalonyl-CoA, but the molar biomass yield with
ethanol was less than half of that obtained with lactate
[6,40]. It was suggested that the different biomass yields
were likely due to either a metabolic energy requirement
for the ferredoxin-dependent reductive carboxylation of
acetyl-CoA to pyruvate, or energy conservation in lactate
uptake [40]. Since the metabolic energy requirement for
acetyl-CoA carboxylation was not demonstrated with any
Geobacteraceae family member [22,23], a lactate proton
antiporter was utilized to allow energy conservation in lactate uptake in the reconstructed P. propionicus network.
Pelobacter species have been reported to use Fe(III) or
S 0 as an electron acceptor [7,10], but studies with
P. carbinolicus have suggested that Fe(III) is reduced
indirectly through sulfur reduction, with sulfide serving
as an electron shuttle for the reduction of Fe(III) [17]. It
was suggested that a low concentration of sulfide
favored Fe(III) reduction without precipitation of ferrous
mono- or disulfides in Sulfurospirillum deleyianum [41].
Given the standard reduction potentials for the Fe3+/Fe2
+
pair (E’° = +771 mV) and the S0/H2S pair (E’° = -243
mV) [42], an extracellular nonenzymatic reaction FE3Rs
(2 Fe3+ + HS- ® 2 Fe2+ + S + H+) was used to model
the indirect Fe(III) reduction. In other bacteria, sulfide
is regenerated from elemental sulfur by the membranebound sulfur reductase that contains both hydrogenase
and sulfur reductase activities [43,44]. The sulfur reductase can use hydrogen as electron donor, or NAD(P)H at
a reduced activity [43]. Thus, two sulfur reductase reactions SRE and SRE2 were utilized in the reconstructed
P. carbinolicus network for sulfur reduction with hydrogen or NAD(P)H as electron donors, although the
enzymes catalyzing Fe(III) and So reduction in P. carbinolicus have not been identified experimentally.
The gap filling process identified some missing reactions in the pathways that were added as non-gene associated reactions to enable the reconstructed network to
synthesize metabolites for biomass formation. The
reconstructed P. carbinolicus network contains 37 nongene associated reactions whereas the P. propionicus
network contains 46 non-gene associated reactions.
These non-gene associated reactions are presumptive
metabolic functions encoded potentially by unknown
genes, and thus will be the subject of further genomic
and biochemical investigation in the future.

Recently, a sensitivity analysis in E. coli model [45]
indicated that small changes in biomass compositions
such as protein, RNA, and lipid did not significantly
affect predicted growth rates. Biomass compositions in
the published G. sulfurreducens model [22] were used to
create the biomass demand reactions in both reconstructed Pelobacter models, as they are closely related to
G. sulfurreducens. Sensitivity analysis also indicated
minimal changes in simulations by small biomass composition changes in the Pelobacter models (data not
shown). Metabolic maps including the biomass demand
reactions for the P. carbinolicus and P. propionicus genome-scale metabolic models were provided (see Additional File 1).
Determination of energy parameters and stoichiometry of
the electron transport chain

The energy parameters of the P. carbinolicus metabolic
model were determined using four sets of physiological
data from P. carbinolicus during acetoin fermentation in
chemostats producing acetate and ethanol. The gassing
required for strict anaerobic growth conditions in chemostats could result in: 1) partial loss of ethanol produced from acetoin fermentation through evaporation;
2) ethanol fermentation to produce acetate and H 2 ,
where H2 was removed by gassing to release the feedback inhibition. Therefore, only the experimental acetoin uptake rates and acetate production rates were used
to simulate the fermentative growth (Figure 1). The linear correlation of qATP = 97.5 × μ + 0.844 has a R2 =
0.994 indicating high quality of the results. Therefore,
the GAM for the P. carbinolicus model is 97.5 mmol
ATP/gdw and the nGAM is 0.844 mmol ATP/gdw/h.
To determine energy parameters of the P. propionicus
metabolic model, GAMs from the P. carbinolicus model
and the G. sulfurreducens model [22] were used to
simulate experimental results. The P. propionicus 2,3butanediol fermentation had an optimal growth rate μ =
0.144 h-1 [6] that was used for simulating P. propionicus
fermentative growth with 2,3-butanediol, acetoin, and
lactate due to similar growth yields for these fermentations. The growth rates and calculated substrate fluxes
based on experimental data [6] were used as constraints
in simulations to optimize ATP production. The average
of the ATP production rates, representing the nGAM of
the P. propionicus model, was 2.80 mmol ATP/gdw/h
calculated using the GAM of the P. carbinolicus model.
Therefore, the GAM for the P. propionicus model is
97.5 mmol ATP/gdw and the nGAM is 2.80 mmol
ATP/gdw/h.
The Pelobacter models contain two sulfur reductase
reactions SRE and SRE2 with hydrogen or NADPH as
electron donors. To determine the stoichiometry of the
proton translocation per pair of electrons transferred

(H+/2e-) in the SRE and SRE2 two reactions, the published biomass yield data for P. carbinolicus grown in
batch culture with ethanol or hydrogen as electron
donor and Fe(III) as electron acceptor [17] were utilized.
The biomass yield with ethanol as electron donor was
compared to the biomass yield with hydrogen as electron donor, and the biomass yield ratios calculated from
experimental results were compared to those from
simulation results, where the H+/2e- ratio varied from 1
to 2 for SRE with hydrogen as electron donor or for
SRE2 with ethanol as electron donor (Figure 2). As
shown in Figure 2, simulation results with the H+/2eratio of 2 for SRE and the H+ /2e- ratio of 1 for SRE2
closely matched experimental results, whereas the other
three combinations resulted in unmatched biomass yield
ratios. Thus, the H+/2e- ratios were determined as 2 for
SRE and 1 for SRE2 in P. carbinolicus model.
Metabolic models of P. carbinolicus and P. propionicus

Upon completion, the genome-scale P. carbinolicus
metabolic model included 741 genes of the 3389 genes
in the P. carbinolicus genome. As shown in Table 1, the

P. carbinolicus model contains 708 reactions and 765
metabolites including 70 extracellular metabolites (see
Additional File 2 for list of genes, reactions, and metabolites included in the P. carbinolicus metabolic model).
The genome-scale P. propionicus metabolic model
included 661 genes among the 3831 genes in the P. propionicus genome. As shown in Table 1, the P. propionicus model consists of 650 reactions and 708 metabolites
including 52 extracellular metabolites (see Additional
File 3 for list of genes, reactions, and metabolites
included in the P. propionicus metabolic model).
As shown in Table 1, the Pelobacter models included
about 20% of the genes in their genomes, similar to the
Geobacter models [22,23]. The numbers of total reactions in the Pelobacter and Geobacter models are also
comparable. Thus, these Geobacteraceae family members contain similar size genomes, share similar basic
metabolic functions, and result in similar size genomescale metabolic models.
The reactions in both Pelobacter metabolic models
were categorized according to 9 functional classifications
(Figure 3). The two models share a similar distribution

of reactions among different functional groups: reactions
for metabolism of amino acids, lipids, cofactors, and
nucleotides are the most abundant, accounting for
almost 70% of all the reactions in both Pelobacter
models.
Currently, there are 76 reactions associated with transporting metabolites in the P. carbinolicus model and 57
reactions for transporting metabolites in P. propionicus
model, including redundant transporters for some extracellular metabolites. In addition, both Pelobacter genomes contained many genes related to ABC transport
systems, which were not included in the network due to
the lack of substrate specificity. Future experiments
could provide additional evidence to include more transport systems.
Validation of the metabolic models using published
experimental data

The Pelobacter metabolic models were validated using
published experimental growth data. In cases where the
experimental data was obtained from batch culture
experiments where flux data was not readily available,
experimentally determined growth rates were used to
constrain the simulations. Ratios of biomass, substrate
and product fluxes from model simulations were calculated and compared with the ratios from experimental
value.
P. carbinolicus can grow by fermenting acetoin, 2,3butanediol, and ethylene glycol [6]. The P. carbinolicus
metabolic model was validated by comparing experimental results with predicted results from in silico simulations of P. carbinolicus fermentative growth on these
substrates (Figure 4). An optimal growth rate of 0.087 h-1
was observed with P. carbinolicus fermentative growth
on 2,3-butanediol [6], and was applied to constrain all
three simulations in which the substrate uptake rate was

minimized. In simulations, the substrates acetoin, 2,3butanediol, and ethylene glycol were consumed to produce acetate and ethanol. The biomass yield per mole of
acetoin was twice the biomass yield per mole of 2,3-butanediol and ethylene glycol in simulations, which matched
well with the experimental data [6]. Similarly, the ratios
of produced acetate and ethanol to consumed substrates
predicted by in silico simulations were validated by the
ratios from experimental results [6]. Thus, the fermentative growth of the P. carbinolicus metabolic model has
been validated and can be applied in future modeling
studies.
Similarly, the fermentative growth of the P. propionicus
metabolic model was validated with experimental data
obtained from P. propionicus fermentation of acetoin,
2,3-butanediol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, and lactate
[6]. An optimal growth rate of 0.144 h -1 was observed
with 2,3-butanediol fermentative growth [6], and was
applied to constrain the simulations in which the substrate uptake rate was minimized. The predicted results
from in silico simulations were compared with experimental results (Figure 5). In simulations, acetoin, 2,3butanediol, lactate, and ethanol were consumed to produce acetate and propionate, whereas substrates and
acetate were both consumed to produce propionate in
propanol and butanol fermentations. As shown in Figure
5, the biomass yield per mole of acetoin was higher than
the biomass yields per mole of 2,3-butanediol and lactate
in simulations, and the latter two were much higher than
the biomass yields per mole of the alcohols. The predicted biomass yields and ratios of acetate:substrate or
propionate:substrate matched well with the experimental

fermentative growth. The biomass yield per mol of substrate, the
ratios of acetate to substrates, and the ratios of produced
propionate to substrates were obtained from experimental data of
P. propionicus fermenting 2,3-butanediol, acetoin, ethanol, propanol,
butanol, and lactate [6], and were compared to those predicted by

propanol and butanol.

results. Therefore, the P. propionicus metabolic model has
been validated with experimental fermentative growth
results. In the P. propionicus metabolic model, lactate
uptake was assumed to occur through a lactate proton
antiporter for energy conservation and the simulated
results predicted about 14% less biomass yield than the
experimental results. Other lactate transporters such as a
lactate proton symporter or diffusion were tested in simulations and resulted in much larger discrepancies with
38%-63% less biomass yields than the experimental results,
supporting the assignment of a lactate proton antiporter
for lactate uptake. However, further experimentation is
required to confirm how lactate is transported.
P. carbinolicus can ferment ethanol to acetate with
hydrogen generation in coculture with either Acetobacterium woodii or Methanospirillum hungatei as hydrogen utilizing partners [6]. Simulations of P. carbinolicus
growth on 2,3-butanediol and ethanol with hydrogen
production were conducted. The simulations predicted
ratios of produced acetate to consumed substrates at
1.80 for acetate:2,3-butanediol and at 0.90 for acetate:

ethanol, matched well with the experimental results at
1.96 for acetate:2,3-butanediol and at 0.93 for acetate:
ethanol. The simulation results predicted a growth yield
ratio of 2.0 for 2,3-butanediol to ethanol, close to the
experimental growth yield ratio of 2.2 for 2,3-butanediol
to ethanol. The P. carbinolicus model was validated for
the hydrogen production for syntrophic growth with
experimental results.
Like phylogenetically related Geobacter and Desulfuromonas species within the family Geobacteraceae, P. carbinolicus can utilize Fe(III) as the terminal electron
acceptor [10], but sulfide is likely to serve as an electron
shuttle for the Fe(III) reduction in P. carbinolicus [17].
P. carbinolicus grown on 2,3-butanediol with Fe(III) produced less ethanol and more acetate than grown on 2,3butanediol without Fe(III) [10]. The experimental acetate:ethanol ratios and growth rates were applied as constraints to simulate Fe(III) reduction by optimizing 2,3butanediol utilization. Simulation results of P. carbinolicus growth on 2,3-butanediol with or without Fe(III) are
shown in Figure 6. The ratios of ethanol:2,3-butanediol
and acetate:2,3-butanediol in the presence or absence of
Fe(III) from in silico simulations matched well with
those from the experimental data [10]. These results
indicated that P. carbinolicus model worked well with
Fe(III) reduction simulations.
P. carbinolicus is capable of utilizing H2 as the electron donor coupled with Fe(III) reduction to support
growth when acetate is provided as the carbon source
[10]. P. carbinolicus growth on ethanol or on hydrogen
with acetate as the carbon source and with Fe(III) as the
electron acceptor was simulated by applying experimental growth rates as constraints and optimizing the substrate utilization. As shown in Figure 7, the biomass
yield ratios between ethanol/Fe(III) and H 2 /Fe(III)
growth were calculated from both in silico result and
experimental data, and were closely matched. Additionally, the relative ratios of acetate produced to Fe(III)
reduced and ethanol consumed to Fe(III) reduced under

Figure 6 Validation of the P. carbinolicus metabolic model for
growth with Fe(III) reduction. The ratios of produced acetate and
ethanol to 2,3-butanediol were obtained from experimental data of
P. carbinolicus grown on 2,3-butanediol with or without Fe(III) [10],
and were compared to those predicted by in silico simulations with
the P. carbinolicus metabolic model.

Figure 7 Validation of the P. carbinolicus metabolic model for
growth utilizing hydrogen coupled with Fe(III) reduction. The
relative biomass yield of ethanol to hydrogen and the ratios of
acetate and ethanol to Fe(II) produced were obtained from
experimental data of P. carbinolicus growth on hydrogen/acetate or
ethanol with Fe(III) as the electron acceptor [10], and were
compared to those predicted by in silico simulations with the P.
carbinolicus metabolic model.

ethanol/Fe(III) growth conditions were similar between
predicted and experimental results. The stoichiometry of
Fe(III) reduced to hydrogen consumed was measured as
1.9 in experiments [10] and was calculated as 1.83 in
simulations. These results were consistent between predicted and experimental values, and validated the P. carbinolicus model for H2 and ethanol utilization coupled
with Fe(III) reduction.
Comparison of the four Geobacteraceae metabolic models

The four Geobacteraceae metabolic models were compared at the reaction level. The common reactions in all
4 models were determined for each functional category
and the unique reactions in only one model but not in
the other models were also determined (Table 2). The
functional distribution of reactions among the four
metabolic models shows similar patterns, with amino
acid and lipid metabolism accounting for the most reactions and the energy metabolism category comprising
the least reactions. Overall, 470 common reactions are
present in all 4 models. These common reactions are
largely distributed in functional categories including
amino acid metabolism, cofactor metabolism, lipid
metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism. Among the
common reactions, the complete TCA cycle reactions
are present in all 4 models, yet the Pelobacter species
can not completely oxidize acetate and other organic
electron donors to carbon dioxide [10] while the Geobacter species can. Another common reaction that is
present in all 4 models is the nitrogenase reaction. The
molybdenum nitrogenase enzyme complex contains the
Fe protein encoded by the nifH gene and the MoFe protein encoded by the nifD and nifK genes [46,47], and
the genes are well conserved among the four Geobacteraceae family members. The presence of the nitrogenase
complex in all metabolic models suggested that all 4
species can fix nitrogen through ATP-dependent reduction of nitrogen to ammonia for growth, and it has

shown that G. sulfurreducens can grow by nitrogen fixation [48].
Although the four species shared many common reactions among their metabolic models, each model contains some unique reactions, reflecting the unique
metabolic capabilities of the Geobacteraceae species. As
shown in Table 2, the P. carbinolicus model contains 92
unique reactions and the G. metallireducens model contains 79 unique reactions, whereas the P. propionicus
model contains only 17 unique reactions and the G. sulfurreducens model contains 25 unique reactions. For the
P. carbinolicus model, these unique reactions include,
for example: ethylene glycol dehydratase for the fermentation of ethylene glycol; purine-nucleoside phosphorylase for the formation of purines like adenosine,
deoxyadenosine, xanthosine, and hypoxanthine; and
acetylornithine deacetylase and ornithine cyclodeaminase to form a second pathway for proline biosynthesis
through L-ornithine in addition to the common proline
biosynthesis pathway through 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate.
Additionally, P. carbinolicus contains the pyruvate formate lyase and formate dehydrogenase reactions that
can convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA with the co-production of hydrogen for syntrophic growth with hydrogenconsuming organisms. The unique reactions in the
P. propionicus model include the reactions for the
methylmalonyl-CoA dependent propionate formation
pathway. The citrate lyase reaction is also unique to the
P. propionicus model but its physiological role is not
clear yet. See Additional File 4 for a list of unique reactions in the four Geobacteraceae metabolic models.
Incorporation of gene expression levels in metabolic
models

The reconstructed metabolic models contain duplicate
genes for the same reaction, or alternative reactions

between two metabolites, or alternative pathways among
metabolites. Without additional constraints, the duplicate genes, alternative reactions, or alternative pathways
can all direct metabolic fluxes in simulations. Gene
expression data suggesting the preference of duplicate
genes, alternative reactions, or alternative pathways can
be utilized to constrain the simulations and improve
computational modeling analysis. On the other hand,
the metabolic models can also be utilized to facilitate
the interpretation of gene expression data. The P. carbinolicus metabolic model and the microarray data
obtained from P. carbinolicus cells cultured by acetoin
fermentation or ethanol/Fe(III) respiration [17] were
compared.
During acetoin fermentation, acetoin is degraded into
acetaldehyde and acetyl-CoA by the acetoin:DCPIP oxidoreductase. When the gene expression levels were displayed on the P. carbinolicus metabolic map, genes for
the acetoin:DCPIP oxidoreductase Pcar_0343-0347 were
among the most highly transcribed genes during acetoin
fermentation. During ethanol/Fe(III) respiration, the
expression levels of these genes decreased more than 10
fold [17]. Genes with the highest transcription levels
during ethanol/Fe(III) respiration include Pcar_0251 and
Pcar_0255 for the alcohol dehydrogenase (ethanol:NAD)
reaction and Pcar_2758 for the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase reaction, involved in the oxidation of ethanol to
acetyl-CoA[17]. These genes were downregulated more
than 5 fold during acetoin fermentation compared to
ethanol/Fe(III) respiration [17]. The metabolic map and
model added an additional tool to understand the gene
expression data from a metabolic point of view.
The metabolic model contains redundancy in the form
of duplicate genes, alternative reactions, or alternative
pathways. Such redundancy may play important roles in
genetic and metabolic robustness. Microarray analysis

Sun et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4:174
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/4/174

indicated that this redundancy was tightly regulated in
P. carbinolicus. For example, two acetyl-CoA:phosphate
acetyltransferase isozymes Pcar_2542 and Pcar_2850 are
present in the P. carbinolicus model. The gene expression level of Pcar_2542 was 23 fold more than the level
of Pcar_2850 during acetoin fermentation, suggesting
that Pcar_2542 was the primary enzyme to catalyze the
reaction in acetoin fermentation. Similar examples
included isozymes for aconitase, acetate kinase, acetoin
dehydrogenase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, etc.
When different reactions for the same metabolite are
present, it is likely for the cell to use the most energy efficient reaction for optimal growth. An example of this is
the presence of a sulfate proton symport transporter and a
sulfate ABC transport system for sulfate transport. The
expression level of the proton symport transporter gene
Pcar_0676 was more than the sulfate ABC transport system genes during acetoin fermentation (expression of
Pcar_0676 was about 8 times Pcar_2084). Thus, it was
likely that sulfate was mainly transported through the proton symport transporter during acetoin fermentation.
Similarly, the genes encoding nitrogen fixation enzymes
were turned off as the cell used ammonium from the culture medium. The P. carbinolicus metabolic model contains a biosynthesis pathway for proline from glutamate
through ornithine, in addition to the 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate-dependent pathway present in the G. sulfurreducens
model. Microarray results indicated that the mRNA levels
of pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase and ornithine cyclodeaminase were similar under both acetoin fermentation
and ethanol/Fe(III) respiration conditions, suggesting that
both pathways were used for proline biosynthesis.
P. carbinolicus contains genes for de novo cobalamin
biosynthesis, but some of these genes were among the
lowest expression levels during both culture conditions.
Most likely, P. carbinolicus did not synthesize cobalamin, but utilized the vitamin B12 supplemented in the
culture medium. When compared to the G. sulfurreducens model, P. carbinolicus had some unique reactions
allowing the formation of purines like adenosine, inosine, deoxyinosine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, and urate.
However, gene expression data suggested that only adenosine was formed during both culture conditions,
whereas the others were unlikely to be synthesized.
The microarray results will be utilized to constrain the
reconstructed network, where the reactions are closed
during simulations when the associated genes have very
low expression level for the corresponding culture
conditions.
TCA cycle and sulfur reduction

P. carbinolicus reduces Fe(III) indirectly through sulfur
reduction [17]. However, P. carbinolicus only incompletely
oxidizes organic substrates to acetate using Fe(III) as an

Page 10 of 12

electron acceptor [10]. The complete TCA cycle reactions
are present in P. carbinolicus model, yet the fully functional TCA cycle was not observed during simulations
with Fe(III) as electron acceptor. Further examination suggested that this was due to the inability in coupling succinate oxidation to sulfur reduction (ΔG0’ = +53 kJ/mol)
[49]. Many archaea and bacteria are able to reduce elemental sulfur using hydrogen or organic substrates as electron donors [50]. However, only a few bacteria can
completely oxidize acetate with sulfur reduction, including
Desulfuromonas acetoxidans utilizing an ATP-driven succinate oxidation mechanism for acetate oxidation to CO2
with elemental sulfur as electron acceptor [49,51]. It
seems that P. carbinolicus does not contain such an ATPdriven succinate oxidation mechanism, thus cannot completely oxidize acetate to CO2 with elemental sulfur or Fe
(III) as electron donor.
Implications

In subsurface environments, Pelobacter species can be
closely associated with Geobacter species [19,20]. The
Pelobacter and Geobacter metabolic models share 470
common reactions, about 70% of all reactions in the
models. Genome sequence analysis of six Geobacteraceae family members including all four species discussed
in this study suggested that the two Pelobacter species
evolved separately with fermentative/syntrophic metabolism from a common Geobacteraceae ancestor with
anaerobic respiratory metabolism [8]. The P. carbinolicus model contains reactions for fermentative growth
with various organic substrates and reactions of hydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase to produce hydrogen
and formate for syntrophic growth with hydrogen- and
formate-consuming organisms. The P. propionicus
model contains reactions for fermentative growth with
different organic substrates producing propionate. The
Pelobacter models contain metabolic abilities reflecting
their physiological roles in the subsurface community.
The evolution of the Pelobacter species to fermentative
metabolism could also result in the loss of many c-type
cytochromes from their genomes, since there is no need
to transfer electrons outside the cells during fermentative growth, thus abolishing their abilities to directly
reduce Fe(III) or the anodes of microbial fuel cells.
Furthermore, the evolution of a subsurface community
containing fermentative and respiratory species allowing
the breakdown of complex organic substrates to CO2
through different species may be advantageous as each
species does not need to synthesize a full set of proteins
for the complete oxidization of complex organic substrates. The development of the metabolic models of
these Geobacteraceae species will facilitate the study of
their roles and interactions in the subsurface microbial
community.

Conclusions
We have developed genome-scale metabolic models of
P. carbinolicus and P. propionicus. These models of
Pelobacter metabolism can now be incorporated into the
growing repertoire of genome scale models of the Geobacteraceae family to aid in describing the growth and
activity of these organisms in anoxic environments and
in the study of their roles and interactions in the subsurface microbial community.
