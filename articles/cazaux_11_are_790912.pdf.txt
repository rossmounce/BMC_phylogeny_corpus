Are ribosomal DNA clusters rearrangement
hotspots? A case study in the genus Mus
(Rodentia, Muridae)

Abstract
Background: Recent advances in comparative genomics have considerably improved our knowledge of the
evolution of mammalian karyotype architecture. One of the breakthroughs was the preferential localization of
evolutionary breakpoints in regions enriched in repetitive sequences (segmental duplications, telomeres and
centromeres). In this context, we investigated the contribution of ribosomal genes to genome reshuffling since
they are generally located in pericentromeric or subtelomeric regions, and form repeat clusters on different
chromosomes. The target model was the genus Mus which exhibits a high rate of karyotypic change, a large
fraction of which involves centromeres.
Results: The chromosomal distribution of rDNA clusters was determined by in situ hybridization of mouse probes
in 19 species. Using a molecular-based reference tree, the phylogenetic distribution of clusters within the genus
was reconstructed, and the temporal association between rDNA clusters, breakpoints and centromeres was tested
by maximum likelihood analyses. Our results highlighted the following features of rDNA cluster dynamics in the
genus Mus: i) rDNA clusters showed extensive diversity in number between species and an almost exclusive
pericentromeric location, ii) a strong association between rDNA sites and centromeres was retrieved which may be
related to their shared constraint of concerted evolution, iii) 24% of the observed breakpoints mapped near an
rDNA cluster, and iv) a substantial rate of rDNA cluster change (insertion, deletion) also occurred in the absence of
chromosomal rearrangements.
Conclusions: This study on the dynamics of rDNA clusters within the genus Mus has revealed a strong
evolutionary relationship between rDNA clusters and centromeres. Both of these genomic structures coincide with
breakpoints in the genus Mus, suggesting that the accumulation of a large number of repeats in the centromeric
region may contribute to the high level of chromosome repatterning observed in this group. However, the
elevated rate of rDNA change observed in the chromosomally invariant clade indicates that the presence of these
sequences is insufficient to lead to genome instability. In agreement with recent studies, these results suggest that
additional factors such as modifications of the epigenetic state of DNA may be required to trigger evolutionary
plasticity.

Background
The extensive advances in comparative cytogenomics in
recent years have considerably enhanced our knowledge
of the evolution of mammalian genomic architecture
[1]. In particular, the identification of syntenic associations of homologous chromosomal segments has led to
the delimitation of breakpoint sites, i.e., regions where

genome synteny has been disrupted by chromosomal
rearrangements. Complementary to the cytogenetic
approach, whole genome comparisons between different
mammalian groups have highlighted the extensive reuse
of breakpoints during chromosome evolution supporting
the notion of evolutionary breakpoints as hotspots of
genome repatterning [2]. This predisposition of certain
genomic regions to instability has been formalized as
the ‘fragile breakage model’ [3]. Moreover, comparative
genomics, particularly in primates, has provided greater

resolution of breakpoints. These studies have shown that
breakpoint regions are enriched with different types of
repetitive sequences such as SINEs, LINEs, LTRs and, in
particular, segmental duplications [2,4-6]. The presence
of repetitive sequences at evolutionary breakpoints is
thought to be related to the role tandem repeats play as
a substrate for non-homologous recombination (i.e.,
exchanges between two different chromosomes) thereby
promoting chromosomal rearrangements [7]. However,
several analyses suggest that rearrangement breakpoints
and repeat sequences (flanking regions of segmental
duplications) share similar physicochemical properties
(high DNA flexibility and low stability) characteristic of
fragile sites [1,8]. Centromeric and subtelomeric
domains appear as the key regions in chromosome evolution, since both accumulate repeat sequences, harbour
many breakpoints and engage in non-homologous
recombination [9,10]. Several studies have shown a significant association between breakpoint reuse and centromere repositioning in different mammalian groups
such as Marsupialia, Muridae, Equidae, and Primates
[2,11-13], underscoring the pivotal role of these genomic
regions in chromosome restructuring.
The rRNA genes represent another family of tandem
repeat sequences. These genes code for the ribosomal
subunits that are essential for the cellular translation
machinery. In mammals, each unit is composed of three
genes coding for 18S, 5.8S and 28S ribosomal RNA; these
genes are separated by two intergenic spacers and an
external transcribed spacer [14]. Whereas the sequences
of spacers are generally highly divergent, the ribosomal
coding elements show in some regions a remarkable
sequence conservation within species and even among
distantly related organisms [15]. The tandem repeats of
units are further organized into clusters present on one
to several chromosome pairs where they are most often
located in pericentromeric or subtelomeric regions
[4,16-18]. Several studies have highlighted the speciesspecific chromosomal distribution of rDNA clusters even
between closely related species, suggesting that the location of rDNA clusters can rapidly change through transposition. The rDNA clusters therefore show several
features in common with breakpoint regions: they are
tandemly repeated; they are generally located in pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions; they transpose; they
are subject to high rates of intra- and inter-chromosomal
recombination. Indeed, the coincidence of rDNA clusters
with chromosomal breakpoints has been highlighted in
vitro in plants [19]. Here, we investigate the evolutionary
dynamics of rDNA clusters in relation to genome reshuffling in an emblematic mammalian model, the genus
Mus which includes the house mouse.
Mus is an ideal biological model to investigate processes of chromosomal evolution since it exhibits one of

Page 2 of 14

the highest rates of karyotypic repatterning documented
in mammals [20]. The genus is species-rich with more
than 40 species distributed among four subgenera [21].
These include the subgenus Coelomys (shrew mice) with
four species and a South-East Asian distribution, the
subgenus Pyromys (spiny mice) with five species
restricted to the Indian subcontinent, and the African
subgenus Nannomys (pygmy mice) the most species-rich
(with 18 species) and karyotypically diverse of the four
subgenera [21,22]. Finally, the Eurasian subgenus Mus
comprises 16 species, one of which is the house mouse
[21,23]. Comparative cytogenomics has revealed a 10- to
30-fold acceleration in chromosomal change that was
coincidental with the subgeneric cladogenesis, followed
by a remarkable stasis in the subgenus Mus in which all
16 species share the same 2n = 40 karyotype. Moreover,
studies have shown that more than half of the observed
rearrangements involved centromeres (reactivation of
latent sites or neocentromerization events) [13,24].
The aim of the present study was to investigate if the
evolutionary dynamics of rDNA clusters played a role in
the extensive genomic reshuffling of the genus Mus. To
do so, we first established the variation in location and
number of the rDNA clusters between species belonging
to different subgenera. Second, we used the available
molecular phylogenies to reconstruct and track the evolution of these clusters in the genus. Finally, building
upon the existing chromosomal phylogeny, we tested
the temporal association between rDNA clusters, breakpoint regions, and centromeres.

Methods
Material

The 19 species and subspecies as well as the number of
specimens studied are listed in Table 1. Animals were
either obtained from the Conversatoire Génétique de la
Souris Sauvage (Institut des Sciences de l’Evolution,
Montpellier, France) or collected in the wild. Four additional species (Mus booduga, M. terricolor, Apodemus
sylvaticus, Rattus rattus) for which rDNA cluster data
were available, were included in the analyses [25-27].
Chromosomal analyses

For all taxa, mitotic metaphases were obtained by the
air-drying method from bone marrow cells after yeast
stimulation [28]. Identification of chromosomes was performed by DAPI-banding following the nomenclature of
Cowell [29] for the subgenus Mus, Veyrunes et al.
[22,24] for the subgenera Nannomys and Coelomys, and
Matsubara et al. [26] for the subgenus Pyromys. At least
five metaphases per specimen were analysed. All observations were made with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence
microscope equipped with an image analyser (Cytovision
3.93.2, Genetix).

Fluorescence in-situ hybridization

The chromosomal location and number of rDNA clusters was determined by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). Cloned gene fragments of the house mouse
28S rDNA [BE-2-pSP64, 1.5kb; [30]] and 18S rDNA
[SalC-pSP64, 2kb; [31]] were labelled separately with
Digoxigenin-11-dUTP by nick translation according to
the Roche Protocol and added to the same hybridization
solution. The chromosome slides were treated with
RNase for 1 hour at 37°C to remove cellular rRNA,
dehydrated in a series of ethanol washes and then airdried. They were denatured for 2 min at 72°C in 70%
formamide, 2XSSC, dehydrated in a series of ice-cold
ethanol washes and air-dried. The probes were denatured for 10 min at 72°C. The chromosome slides were

hybridized overnight with the two probes (150 ng/slide).
The slides were washed at 37°C for 2 min in 2XSSC and
4XT (4x SSC, 0.05% Tween 20, pH = 7) before they
were incubated with FITC conjugated with anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche). The slides were mounted in a
Vectashield antifade solution containing DAPI (4’, 6’diamidino-2-phenylindole; Vector Laboratories). A cluster was considered as present on a chromosome pair
when a signal was observed on at least one of the
homologs. Three positions were possible: i) pericentromeric when the cluster was observed on the proximal
region of the chromosome, i.e., adjacent to the centromere, ii) subtelomeric when on the distal end of the
chromosome, and iii) interstitial when neither proximal
nor distal.

Phylogenetic inference of rDNA cluster evolution

The determination of the phylogenetic distribution of
the rDNA clusters throughout the genus Mus first
required that the chromosomal orthology among all
taxa be established. For this, we relied on the comparative chromosome maps for the subgenera established by
Veyrunes et al. [24] based on Zoo-FISH and the chromosome nomenclature of the house mouse as reference.
The Veyrunes et al. [24] study concluded that the
ancestral Mus karyotype comprised 30 syntenic segments (Figure 1). A matrix was then constructed using
these 30 segments as characters and the following states:
the presence or absence of rDNA clusters on the

proximal region of the segment was coded 1 or 0
respectively, and a distal localisation as 2. Apodemus sylvaticus and Rattus rattus were used as outgroups in all
analyses. The chromosomal homology between these
species and the house mouse was previously determined
by Matsubara et al. [27] and Cavagna et al. [25] respectively. However, as Matsubara et al. [27] did not discriminate a distal and proximal segment corresponding to
mouse chromosome 1 in A. sylvaticus, the presence or
absence of clusters on these segments was coded as “?”.
Next, a reference tree was needed providing a topology and branch lengths and including all of the species
studied. As none of the published phylogenies met this

requirement, we reconstructed a molecular phylogeny of
the genus Mus using the nuclear interstitial retinol-binding protein 3 (RBP3 = IRBP) and mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences. These data were available in
GenBank for all species (Table 2) except Mus cypriacus:
the full-length sequence (1140 bp) of this gene was
sequenced for M. cypriacus following Montgelard et al.
[32] [EMBL: FR751074]. The sequences were aligned
using Bioedit (v.7.0.5). The best fitting model was determined by Modeltest [33] to be the GTR+G+I model
(-LnL = 11707.61; A = 26%, C = 30%, G = 21%, T = 23%,
proportion of invariable sites = 62%, gamma shape parameter = 0.95). The phylogenetic analyses were performed
on a constrained topology and the combined dataset (the
missing data were coded by “?”) using maximum likelihood (ML) as implemented in PAUP* v.4b.0. Two nodes
of the topology were constrained according to published
data: (i) the relationships between the subgenera were
unambiguously resolved by Veyrunes et al. [24] with the
subgenus Coelomys diverging first, followed by Nannomys as the sister group of the Mus-Pyromys clade.; (ii)
M. cypriacus and M. macedonicus were considered as

Page 5 of 14

sister-species as proposed by Cucchi et al. [34]. According to the highest-likelihood topology, the subgenus Mus
was divided into three clades: an Southeast Asian group
with three species (M. caroli, M. cervicolor and M. cooki),
an Indian group (M. terricolor, M. booduga, M. fragilicauda and M. famulus), and a Palearctic group (M. spretus, M. spicilegus, M. macedonicus, M. cypriacus, and the
three subspecies of M. musculus [35,36]). The sister-species relationships within some of the Paleartic taxa were
not resolved. However, slight changes in the topology of
the reference tree did not affect the results, since the
chromosomal distribution of clusters within these groups
was quite homogeneous.
We used an ML approach to reconstruct the ancestral
states of the rDNA clusters since we had no a priori knowledge on their mode of evolution. Using the previously
determined reference tree (topology, branch length), the
probability of each state (absent, pericentromeric or distal
location) of the rDNA clusters was calculated at all nodes
for each orthologous segment. This analysis was performed
using R [37] and the function ACE (ancestral character
estimation) from the package APE [38]. We used the ARD
model (All-Rates-Different) where all change rates were
different among the three rDNA cluster states.

Association between rDNA clusters, breakpoints and
centromeres

The number and positions of breakpoints were inferred
from the chromosomal phylogeny derived by Veyrunes
et al. [24], and comprised the sites involved in fissions,
fusions, translocations and inversions. The events
(breakpoints, loss or emergence of a centromere) were
then mapped onto the reconstructed rDNA trees for
each segment. The localization and co-occurrence of
breakpoints and rDNA clusters were then determined.
The co-evolution between centromeres and rDNA
clusters was next investigated by BayesTraits [39] using
the previous phylogenetic framework. The correlated
evolution between pairs of discrete binary traits (centromere, rDNA cluster) was analysed by ML. A matrix was
constructed by coding 1/0 the presence/absence of a
centromere and of an rDNA cluster for each orthologous segment and species. This analysis provided the
likelihoods of an independent (4 parameters) and a
dependent model (8 parameters) of evolution of centromeres and clusters. Likelihood ratio tests were performed to test the significance of the correlated
evolution between centromeres and rDNA clusters with
the statistics distributed as a chi square (df = 4).

Results
Overview

The chromosomal location of the 18S-28S rRNA genes
for all species and subspecies is shown in Table 1. The

Cazaux et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:124
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/124

distribution of rDNA clusters in this genus was highly
variable ranging from 1 to 21 chromosome pairs. The
Asian species harboured the highest number of clusters:
26-42 in Mus caroli, M. cervicolor, M. cooki, M. fragilicauda, M. famulus and M. pahari. The exception was
M. platythrix for which only three chromosome clusters
were observed. This pattern contrasted markedly with
the African subgenus Nannomys in which the number
of clusters varied between two and 14.
The rDNA clusters were always located in the pericentromeric region (see insert Figure 1). This organization differed in two species (i) in M. spretus, the rDNA
clusters were subtelomeric and (ii) in M. terricolor, the
clusters were located between the telomere and the centromere [40]. The clusters were exclusively present on
autosomal chromosomes with the exception of M. caroli
which showed a signal on the X chromosome.
Subgenus Mus

Eight of the studied taxa showed a distribution of rDNA
clusters that was identical to published data [see Table
1; [26,41,42]]. This included the rare subtelomeric position noted on chromosome 4 in M. m. domesticus [41].
New rDNA data are provided for six species (Figure 2).
rRNA genes were present on all M. caroli chromosomes
except the Y chromosome (i.e., all autosomes and the
X). Among the Asian species, the rDNA clusters were
located in the pericentromeric region of chromosomes
7-19 in M. cooki, of chromosomes 2-19 in M. famulus,
and of chromosomes 4-19 in M. cervicolor. In M. fragilicauda, all autosomes harboured clusters. The 18S-28S
rRNA genes were located on chromosomes 1, 4, 11, 1519 in the endemic M. cypriacus. We detected variation
in the number of clusters among the three specimens
studied from different locations in Cyprus that showed
five, seven and eight rDNA clusters respectively.
Subgenus Nannomys

The 18S-28S rRNA genes were located in the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes: 1, 4, 8, 11, 13, 14 and
17 in M. mattheyi and chromosomes 14, 15, 17 in M.
indutus. Only one signal was detected in M. haussa and
this was on chromosome 15 which has a diagnostic pericentric inversion [22]. All autosomes in M. musculoides
and the South African sample of M. minutoides result
from centric fusions of ancestral acrocentric chromosomes [22]. The poor resolution of the centromeric
areas in these metacentrics made the precise arm-localization of the hybridization signal problematic. Thus, the
clusters were simply assigned to metacentrics: Rb(4.13)
and Rb(8.15) in M. musculoides, and Rb(4.7), Rb(12.17),
Rb(13.16) and Rb(14.15) in M. minutoides. The clusters
were considered as present on both chromosomes of the
metacentrics in the phylogenetic analyses.

M. pahari showed 34 signals on the centromeric regions
of all but three chromosome pairs (6, 9 and X ).
Subgenus Pyromys

Our results were similar to those of Matsubara et al.
[26]: rDNA clusters were present on three chromosomes
5, 8 and 12.
Inference of the ancestral state of clusters

The results of the rDNA study allowed us to identify a
total of 30 clusters in the genus, 27 of which were located
in the pericentromeric area and three were telomeric.
These clusters were mapped onto the 30 orthologous segments of the ancestral Mus karyotype [24] (Figure 1). The
phylogenetic distribution of the rDNA clusters was established for each of the orthologous segments except one,
since an rDNA cluster was never observed on the segment
corresponding to chromosome 10d (see additional files 1,
2, 3 and 4). At each node of the tree, the ACE analysis
assigned a probability (0-100%) for the absence/presence
of a cluster at a pericentromeric/subtelomeric position.
From the probability distribution of all segments and
nodes, we determined a threshold probability value of
75%, i.e., each state associated with a probability ≥75% was
considered as known. Using this threshold value, the state
of the rDNA clusters for a segment could be ascertained
for 65% of the nodes over all segments i.e., a cluster was
absent (or present) in 42% (or 23%) of the nodes. Among
the 29 segments, the state of the cluster could not be
determined for four of them since all nodal character
states had a probability of 50%. In seven additional segments, clusters were never present, whereas for one segment (Chro 18, see Figure 3), a cluster was present at all
nodes. Overall, the results indicated that the rDNA clusters showed a high lability: three insertions and 10 deletions could be validated in the deeper nodes and 11
insertions/25 deletions in the terminal branches. The deletions occurred in all subgenera, whereas 86% of the insertions concerned the subgenera Coelomys and Mus. The
recurrence of events on segments 6, 7, 12 and 14 (41% of
insertions and deletions) is noteworthy. For example, the
cluster on the orthologous segment to chromosome 14
was present at the ancestral node of the genus Mus. This
cluster disappeared at the nodes leading to the subgenus
Nannomys and to the European species of the subgenus
Mus (M. spretus, M. musculus, M. spicilegus, M. cypriacus,
M. macedonicus), and then reappeared at the node leading
to M. cypriacus + M. macedonicus (Figure 3).

location of the rDNA clusters and centromeres observed
in the genus (Figure 1). The comparative distribution of
these three genomic structures highlighted that 26/30 of
the rDNA clusters occurred in the vicinity of breakpoint
regions and that 96% of these clusters were also associated with a centromere. Thus, more than half (25/42)
of the rearrangement breakpoints in the genus are localized at sites where both an rDNA cluster and a centromere were present. The phylogenetic analyses
performed herein together with the published chromosomal phylogeny [24] provided the opportunity to investigate the temporal dynamics of these genomic
structures. In other words, was an rDNA cluster present
on the orthologous segment when the rearrangement
occurred? When the breakpoints and centromeres were
mapped onto the rDNA trees of each orthologous segment, the results showed that the state of clusters for
nine breakpoints could not be determined, and that 13
breakpoints did not involve a cluster or a centromere.
In all, eight breakpoints occurred in a region where an
rDNA cluster as well as a centromere were present. In
two cases, the rearrangement resulted in the loss of
both the centromere and the cluster suggesting that the
break occurred at the distal end of the cluster (see Figure 4). In the six remaining cases, the break was situated
between the centromere and the rDNA cluster. These

rearrangements led to the loss of the centromere, four
of which were subsequently reacquired. Discounting the
undetermined clusters, these data suggest that 24% of
breakpoints occurred on either side of a cluster.
Given the predominantly pericentromeric location of
rDNA clusters and the co-occurrence of centromeres
and clusters at breakpoints, the evolutionary association
between centromeres and rDNA clusters was tested.
The results of this analysis are summarized in Table 3.
Of the 30 orthologous segments, one showed no rDNA
cluster and one exhibited a cluster at a telomeric location only. These segments were thus eliminated from
the analysis. Of the 28 remaining segments, four showed
significant evidence of co-evolution between centromeres and rDNA (p-value = 0.03-0.04). For example,
the centromere of the segment corresponding to chromosome 19 appeared at the ancestral node of the

subgenus Mus. At the same node, an rDNA cluster
appeared on this segment and persisted in all species of
the subgenus (see Figure 3). In five other cases, co-evolution approached significant values (p = 0.06-0.11).
Finally, in the remaining 19 segments, the independent
evolution of centromeres and clusters could not be
rejected. This is illustrated by the evolution of the
rDNA cluster on the segment orthologous to chromosome 7 (see Figure 3). A centromere is always present
on this segment but the cluster which was present on
the ancestral node to the genus, is lost on the node
leading to Nannomys and on the node leading to the
European species (Mus spretus, M. musculus, M. spicilegus, M. cypriacus, M. macedonicus).

Discussion
Extensive variation in number and location of rDNA
clusters

This study is the first to report such an impressive variation in number and localization of rDNA clusters
within a mammalian genus. The rDNA clusters in the
Mus species were present on 1 to 21 pairs of chromosomes with important numerical differences between
the taxa of the different subgenera. Overall, the subgenera Coelomys and Mus possessed a much larger number of clusters than species within the subgenera
Nannomys and Pyromys. This difference is reflected by
that of the diploid numbers since the karyotypes in the
former subgenera have more chromosomes (2n = 48,
40) than those in the latter (2n = 18 to 36). As there is
generally only one cluster per chromosome pair, a lower
diploid number entails fewer chromosomes and thus a
reduction in the number of available sites for rRNA
genes. Notwithstanding the relation between rDNA cluster and chromosome number, however, variation in the
number of clusters was also considerable within the subgenus Mus, although all species share the same 2n = 40
karyotype. In this group, the Palaearctic species have
less than half the number of clusters present in the
Asian and Indian species. Given that the origin of Mus
lies in southern Asia [35], the decrease in cluster number may be compatible with the loss of rDNA sites by
stochastic processes during the westward colonization of
the ancestral taxa.
In the genus Mus, the high number of clusters observed
raises questions on the processes involved in maintaining
such a large number of repeats. Whereas cellular life
requires a minimum of one cluster of rRNA genes to construct the ribosome, our results suggest that there may be
no upper constraint on the maximal number of clusters in
a genome. In a study on rDNA cluster number variation
in 40 species of rodents, a mean of 4.2 chromosome pairs
carried rDNA clusters (range 1 to 5 [16]). This is far below
the value observed in the present study (mean: 10.1; range

Page 10 of 14

1 to 21). However, the number of clusters provides no
information on the number of copies within a cluster, or
on their transcriptional activity. It is possible that when
many clusters are present, the number of repeat units at
each chromosomal site may in fact be small (not studied).
With respect to transcriptional activity of repeats within
and between clusters, cytogenetic methods involving Agstaining (silver nitrate stain) may be useful. This approach
identifies rRNA genes that were transcribed during the
previous interphase. Comparison between published Agstaining data vs our own FISH analyses for nine Mus species revealed discrepancies in some taxa [41-43]. This was
the case for example in M. caroli (15 Ag- staining/20
FISH), M. cervicolor (9/19) and M. fragilicauda (16/19).
Differences such as these have similarly been observed in
other vertebrate groups such as teleosts, bats, and horses
[44-47]. Determining the frequency of these silent rRNA
genes on a larger sample of mice will provide clues to
their regulation patterns [48].
Another notable characteristic of the rDNA clusters in
the genus Mus is their almost exclusive pericentromeric
location since they were subtelomeric in only one species (M. spretus). In rodents, both positions are commonly observed (58% pericentromeric/31% distal vs 11%
interstitial) [25,27,49-56]. Few mammal species (8/126)
exhibit clusters in an interstitial position and in several
cases, these result from chromosomal rearrangements
[50,57]. It should be noted that none of the extant Mus
species harboured rDNA clusters in an interstitial position, although the phylogenetic reconstruction inferred
four instances in which they occupied a transient interstitial position following a rearrangement (Figure 4).
The low frequency of these clusters suggests that an
interstitial location may not be evolutionary stable and
this may be due to two possibilities: (i) the location may
be deleterious, or, (ii) as suggested by our results, it may
contribute to genomic instability and predispose the
chromatin to centromere formation [58].
The location of clusters between Mus species differed,
each taxon showing its own chromosomal distribution.
Thus, the chromosomal distribution of rDNA clusters
appears as a useful cytogenetic marker (number and
position on the chromosome) to discriminate species
[59]. However, as our results have shown that rDNA
clusters may be labile, their use in inferring orthologous
chromosomal sites between species must be treated with
caution [e.g. Anura; [60]].
Do rDNA clusters contribute to rearrangements?

Our study is the first to reconstruct the phylogeny of
rDNA clusters. By combining this original approach and
a published chromosomal phylogeny, the evolutionary
relationship between rDNA clusters and rearrangements
could be evaluated and the association with the

Cazaux et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:124
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/124

accelerated rate of genome repatterning of the genus
Mus explored. Previous studies have underscored the
pivotal role of centromere change in the high rate of
chromosomal evolution in this group of rodents [13,24].
The phylogenetic analyses performed in this present
study provided a unique opportunity to reconstruct the
timing and infer the position of breakpoints relative to
that of the centromere and the rDNA site. Two patterns
were evidenced. First, we were able to determine that
24% of the breakpoints occurred at the proximal or distal end of the rDNA clusters. The corresponding rearrangements all involved the coincidental loss of linked
centromeres, some of which subsequently re-emerged in
the same position. This association is further supported
by the significant co-evolutionary behaviour observed
between some of the rDNA clusters and centromeres
suggesting that the joint presence of these two genomic
structures may lead to genome instability and predispose
to chromosomal rearrangements. Second, we identified
an impressive rate of rDNA cluster change (deletions
and insertions), most of which somewhat surprisingly
occurred in the subgenus Mus, an evolutionary clade in
which all species share the same chromosomal complement. These results suggest that rDNA clusters can
move from one chromosome pair to another with no
other modifications of the karyotype.
A role of rDNA genes as promoters of genome reorganization, particularly when located in the pericentromeric
region, has previously been the focus of studies on the
mechanisms of centric or Robertsonian (Rb) fusions
[61,62]. This type of rearrangement involves the joining by
the centromere of two non-homologous chromosomes.
The rationale of a direct or indirect role in the Rb fusion
was based on the fact that rDNA clusters group together
during interphase to form one or several nucleoli. The
physical proximity between rDNA-bearing chromosomes
in interphase was predicted to increase the probability of
their being involved in Rb fusions. Strikingly, this rearrangement is prominent within two of the present subgenera
studied herein. In two of the samples studied of the subgenus Nannomys, all chromosomes were the product of Rb
fusions [22]. The hybridization signal of the rDNA probe
seemed to co-localize with the junction between the two
chromosomal arms, suggesting that at least one of the
breakpoints may have occurred in or close to the rDNA
cluster. In the subgenus Mus, populations within two taxa
carry Rb fusions: M. m. domesticus and M. terricolor. In
the latter, only two rare Rb fusions are documented [40].
In contrast, M. m. domesticus shows a very high diversity
of populations carrying different numbers and combinations of fusions, although only five pairs of chromosomes
harbour pericentromeric rDNA clusters [[63], this study].
The fusion mechanism is well documented in M. m.
domesticus and has been shown to involve breaks in the

Page 11 of 14

centromeric satellite sequences [64] and not in the rDNA
clusters which are conserved intact. In addition, the prediction of a higher involvement of the rDNA-bearing
chromosomes in the Rb fusions was not confirmed in the
house mouse, as a statistical analysis indicated that they
had the lowest frequency of fusion [65]. These findings
suggest that centric fusions may involve different
sequences in different genomes, and determining the precise mechanism involved requires high resolution
sequence analysis.
Is there a functional association between centromeres
and rDNA clusters?

Our results highlight two characteristic features of rDNA
cluster distribution in the genus Mus: (i) rDNA clusters
are preferentially located in pericentromeric regions, and
(ii) a change in chromosomal distribution of rDNA clusters always occurs between pericentromeric regions of different chromosomes. This physical linkage between rDNA
clusters and centromeres may be driven by their genomic
structures, since both are subject to sequence homogenization. In the case of rRNA genes, several studies have
underscored the high degree in sequence similarity within
and between genomes [15]. Two models of evolution have
been proposed to account for this observation. These are
the Birth and Death model and the concerted evolution
model [66,67]. By comparing the level of intragenomic
variation of rDNA sequences, Ganley and Kobayashi [68]
were able to confirm that rRNA genes evolved via concerted evolution. This model involves two mechanisms of
sequence homogenization: gene conversion and nonhomologous recombination. Gene conversion corresponds
to a non-reciprocal transfer of an allelic difference from
one chromosome to its homologue, whereas non-homologous recombination consists in a recombination event
between non-sister chromatids. In humans, studies have
shown that rDNA clusters were involved in meiotic rearrangements at a frequency >10% per cluster and per meiosis [69], and that the regulatory and coding sequences
were highly homogenized [70]. Similar observations of
high sequence homogeneity exist for both subtelomeric
and particularly centromeric regions in several mammalian species [71-73].
How and when would concerted evolution take place?
During early prophase, all the chromosomes migrate
into one area of the nucleus and adopt a particular
orientation known as the bouquet in which all telomeres
attach to the nuclear membrane (Figure 5) [74]. Doublestrand breaks also appear at this stage that are programmed to be repaired by recombination be it by reciprocal exchange (cross-over) or gene conversion [75].
Thus, the formation of the bouquet provides the physical
opportunity for concerted evolution to occur between
similar sequences on non-homologous chromosomes

chromosomes may facilitate their sequence homogenization by
non-homologous recombination.

(such as centromeres, and the associated rDNA genes
[71,72,76]). Reciprocally, the presence of clusters could
increase the rate of non-homologous recombination in
the pericentromeric or subtelomeric regions. Several consequences of rDNA evolution are expected. First, rDNA
clusters would be predicted to localize preferentially in
centromeric or subtelomeric regions. This is in agreement with available data in mammalian species. Second,
whereas the telomere orientation in the bouquet
obviously leads to the close proximity between centromeres on acrocentric chromosomes during meiosis, this
is less evident where metacentric chromosomes are
involved (Figure 5). This difference is likely to influence
the rate of homogenization between centromeres (and
linked rRNA genes) of acrocentric vs metacentric chromosomes. Such a pattern has in fact been confirmed in
humans and recently in the pig in which the percentage
similarity of centromeric sequences is higher in acrocentric than metacentric chromosomes [71,77]. Finally,
the mechanism of concerted evolution in a bouquet context paves the way for the occurrence of exchanges of
rDNA clusters between non-homologous chromosomes.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our results agree with a main outcome of
recent studies indicating that breakpoints overlap with a
diversity of repetitive families among different groups
[5], which thus may include rDNA clusters. The present
analysis on the dynamics of rDNA clusters within the
genus Mus, has revealed an impressive variation in the
number and location of clusters between taxa, and highlighted the strong evolutionary relationship between

Page 12 of 14

rDNA clusters and centromeres. Both of these genomic
structures coincide with breakpoints in the genus Mus,
suggesting that the accumulation in the centromeric
region of a large number of repeats subject to concerted
evolution may contribute to the high rates of chromosome repatterning observed in this group. However, the
high rate of rDNA change observed in the chromosomally invariant subgenus Mus indicates that the presence of these sequences is insufficient to lead to
genome instability. Thus, an additional factor would be
required to trigger evolutionary plasticity. Emerging
clues now point to modifications of the epigenetic state
of DNA, particularly of interspersed repeats, as a prime
source of instability [1,6,78]. In plants and insects, it has
been shown that transposable elements may be associated with rDNA clusters, and thus, may be responsible
for changes in their chromosomal distribution [15,79].
However, no direct association between rRNA genes
and transposable elements has so far been described in
mammals. Although this study deals with large-scale
rearrangements and low-resolution breakpoints, our
results may serve to focus genomic investigations on the
factors triggering genome plasticity and evolution.
