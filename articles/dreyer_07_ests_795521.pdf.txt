Abstract
Background: The guppy, Poecilia reticulata, is a well-known model organism for studying
inheritance and variation of male ornamental traits as well as adaptation to different river habitats.
However, genomic resources for studying this important model were not previously widely
available.
Results: With the aim of generating molecular markers for genetic mapping of the guppy, cDNA
libraries were constructed from embryos and different adult organs to generate expressed
sequence tags (ESTs). About 18,000 ESTs were annotated according to BLASTN and BLASTX
results and the sequence information from the 3' UTRs was exploited to generate PCR primers for
re-sequencing of genomic DNA from different wild type strains. By comparison of EST-linked
genomic sequences from at least four different ecotypes, about 1,700 polymorphisms were
identified, representing about 400 distinct genes. Two interconnected MySQL databases were built
to organize the ESTs and markers, respectively. A robust phylogeny of the guppy was
reconstructed, based on 10 different nuclear genes.
Conclusion: Our EST and marker databases provide useful tools for genetic mapping and
phylogenetic studies of the guppy.

Background
The Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata Peters, is well
known for the highly polymorphic male color patterns,
which have been the subject of genetic analysis for almost
a century [1]. The vast literature on the ecology and evolution of the guppy and the extensive phenotypic variation
in wild populations make the guppy a particularly attrac-

tive choice for understanding the molecular basis of adaptation to varying natural conditions. Despite the wealth of
field studies, molecular genetic information about the
guppy is still scarce. Therefore, a genetic map would be a
first step towards identifying quantitative adaptive traits
of the guppy, including male ornamentation and predator-driven adaptations found in different river habitats in

Trinidad, underlying heritable differences in life history
traits [2,3].

not entered into the database, but were set aside for periodically repeated subsequent BLAST searches.

The genome size of the guppy is estimated to be around
740 Mbp, with a diploid set of 46 chromosomes, including genetically defined X and Y sex chromosomes [4]. A
first map of the sex chromosomes, based on classical
genetic analysis of male colour patterns, has been
sketched out by Winge and co-workers [5]. More recently,
Phang and co-workers used ornamental guppies from Singapore to generate a genetic map based on 300 RAPD
markers, and a cross between two laboratory strains of different body shape and colour was mapped using a combination of 186 AFLP and microsatellite markers [6-8].
Conservation of microsatellites between closely related
species and synteny with respect to 61 microsatellite
markers were suggested by an intergeneric cross between
Xiphophorus maculatus [9] and P. reticulata [10]. In all of
these studies, the number of linkage groups fell short of
the chromosome number, indicating that a higher marker
density is required for complete coverage of the genetic
map. Unfortunately, RAPD and AFLP markers cannot be
easily reused for studying crosses between outbred strains
of wild guppies.

Our EST database http://guppy.weigelworld.org currently
comprises about 18,000 entries, which represent about
5,300 different gene products. The Quare and Tranquille
strains are represented by about 40% of the entries each,
with the remaining 20% derived from other strains,
including the laboratory strains Blue and Istanbul wild
[15] (Table 1). About 16,200 ESTs with a minimum of
200 bp sequence available have been deposited to Genbank. The accession numbers are included in Table 1.

We have identified hundreds of expressed sequence tag
(EST)-linked single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
markers, suitable for genetic mapping of wild guppies.
The fact that these markers are linked to expressed genes
will help to exploit syntenic information from fully
sequenced genomes of other fish species [11]. This will in
turn also facilitate future identification of candidate genes
when mapping qualitative morphological as well as quantitative life history traits of the guppy.

Results and discussion
A P. reticulata EST database
Several guppy cDNA libraries were constructed using
SMART technology, as detailed in Materials and Methods.
As sources of mRNA we used whole embryos, newborn
fish, adult liver, testis, brain, retina, and skin, in order to
obtain a broad spectrum of different expressed sequences.
Several feral and laboratory strains were used, including
the Quare6 strain from East Trinidad and the Tranquille
strain from West Trinidad [12]. This allows for direct
sequence comparison of abundant transcripts between
different strains. Between 100 and 5,700 clones were
picked at random from each library, depending on its
complexity. The inserts were first sequenced from the 5'
end and sequences were compared to EMBL vertebrate
databases (see Methods) using NCBI BLASTN and BLASTX
algorithm [13] to assign a possible function. BLAST results
were parsed and automatically entered into a MySQL EST
database [14]. Sequences lacking sufficiently good support by BLAST hits with an e-value higher than 10-5 were

The results of the BLASTX searches were parsed for annotation according to GO criteria [16], describing molecular
function or biological processes, provided that the E-value
of the best hit was lower than 10-5 (Fig. 1). Most of the
proteins encoded by non-redundant annotated guppy
ESTs have binding (17%) or catalytic (13%) activity or are
structural proteins (13%). This distribution resembles
that described for the Fundulus heteroclitus EST database
[17], although the guppy database contains relatively
more ESTs derived from retina, testis, and muscle. Among
enzymes and structural proteins, muscle proteins are the
most abundant, because somite tissue prevails in
advanced embryos, the predominant source of our EST
libraries (Table 1). Sequences without significant best
BLAST hits or with hits to genes that lacked informative
annotation, e.g. from genomic surveys or non-annotated
EST products, are listed as unknown in Table 2. About
25% of the guppy cDNAs in our database is annotated as
unknown.
The EST database can be searched by clone name, by
accession number of the best BLAST search hit, and by
possible biological function of the deduced protein product of each EST. Furthermore, the BLAST hits are saved in
a table, in which a full text search for annotations as well
as accession numbers can be performed. A subset of EST
clones was also sequenced from the 3' end, and the longest ORF was extracted from the assembly with its 5'
sequence. Information on the coding regions was
obtained by database searches using BLASTX. Contigs representing multiple hits of the same gene product were
aligned in order to analyse these for polymorphisms.
We provide a download function for the extraction of the
5' and 3' end cDNA sequences, as well as assemblies in the
FASTA format [18]. It is also possible to perform BLAST
searches against all ESTs.

of different strains. We primarily amplified 3' UTR
sequences, because they are less conserved than coding
sequences and not interrupted by introns. The 3' UTRs are
typically shorter than in mammals, as has been reported
for other lower vertebrates [19]. This somewhat reduces
the usefulness of 3' UTRs for identification of SNPs by
resequencing of genomic DNA from different strains. Several EST libraries were constructed (Table 1) and some
consisted of size-selected sub fractions (data not shown).
In the different libraries, between 10 and 30 % of the
cDNA sequences had 3' UTRs longer than 400 bp and
those were given priority. The 3' end of the coding
sequence was included where required to produce fragments about 400 to 500 bp in length. In many instances,
PCR amplification and sequencing revealed that the 3'
ends of coding regions contained short (< 100 bp)

introns. A comparison of ESTs from different strains
reveals that, as expected, coding sequences are less polymorphic than the 3' UTRs.
Some primers that were designed to flank an intron were
also used, yet their efficient design required prediction of
the most likely exon-intron boundaries by alignment of
the ESTs to genomic sequences from other fish species,
and the length of the resulting PCR products was unpredictable. Aside from SNPs, 3' UTRs and introns also contained short insertions and deletions (indels) at lower
frequency (about 20% of all polymorphisms). Of these
indels, about 60 % were found as parts of either short tandem repeat polymorphisms or of homopolymer stretches
(data not shown).

A second MySQL database was established for the management of the strain-specific markers and was linked to
the EST database. From the marker database information
can be retrieved on the reference clone, the primer pairs
used, type (SNP, indel), and position of polymorphisms
between genomic sequences of the different guppy strains.
The marker database can also accommodate information
on available assays for these polymorphisms. So far, these
are mainly MALDI TOF assays developed for high
throughput detection of SNP markers [20]. All multiple
alignments of genomic and cDNA sequences that had
been generated for polymorphism detection [21] were
loaded into the multiple SNP query tool (MSQT), a database used for SNP assay development, especially for
design of strain-specific assays (Warthmann, Fitz and
Weigel, submitted).
From 400 unique ESTs that were successfully resequenced in 16 strains of guppy, we could identify 1,700
EST linked polymorphic loci. About 75% of the polymorphisms were identified by comparison of only four popu-

lations, originally collected in the Quare (East Trinidad),
Tranquille and Upper Aripo rivers (West Trinidad), and in
Central Cumaná (Venezuela). The geographically most
distant among these are the Quare and the Cumaná guppies and we found these to be most genetically divergent.
As shown in Table 3, the evaluation of 400 polymorphic
ESTs using the MSQT, allowed for the selection of 235
assays for markers that are each linked to a different gene
product and that distinguish between Quare and Cumaná
populations. A similar or slightly smaller number of
assays were predicted to distinguish other pairs of ecotypes (Table 3). For analysis of genetic crosses between
different feral guppy strains, these EST-linked SNP markers can be supplemented by about 50 microsatellite markers previously described in guppies [10,23,24].
BLAST searches with the guppy ESTs selected for marker
development were performed against the Tetraodon nigroviridis genome. The number of hits for each chromosome
was approximately proportionate to the length of each T.

had been identified. Another 38% of these sequences
aligned to the 40% of the Tetraodon sequences that were
not yet assigned to one of its 21 chromosomes (Fig. 2, and
data not shown). Similarly, guppy ESTs were aligned to
genomic sequences of zebrafish (Danio rerio), fugu (Takifugu rubripes) and medaka (Oryzias latipes), to facilitate
prediction of potential coding sequences in regions of
interest for mapping, genomic walking, and for prediction
of exon-intron boundaries (data not shown). Since a certain degree of synteny between different fish species has
been previously described [10,24], a higher marker density in regions of interest for genetic mapping may be
achieved by ortholog cloning based on synteny predictions on genes in the guppy. However, even between close
relatives, this approach will not work perfectly, given the

fact that chromosome numbers are variable and chromosomal rearrangements occur frequently.
Molecular phylogeny of the guppy
Previous molecular phylogenetic studies on guppies were
primarily based on mitochondrial sequences [25]. The
molecular resources we developed enable studies on
molecular evolution of nuclear genes, e.g. the identification of genes that have rapidly diversified and are potentially under positive selection, as exemplified by a study
comparing genes encoding the long wave length sensitive
opsins to other opsins [26].

Additional applications include studies on molecular
phylogeny of the guppy. Coding sequences of orthologous expressed nuclear genes from nine different fish species, including the guppy, were identified by reciprocal
BLAST. For phylogenetic analysis, these sequences were
concatenated and a BIONJ tree was reconstructed [27],
using SplitsTree4 software, version 4.6 [28] [see Additional file 1]. The selected genes include highly conserved
ribosomal proteins as well as metabolic enzymes and
transcription factors [see Additional file 2]. The number of
teleost species in this analysis was limited by available
sequence data from so-called non-model species, since
the intersection of orthologous genes got smaller the
more non-model species were included.
The resulting topology was essentially the same when
only four coding sequences were concatenated. By convergence tests using increasing numbers of nuclear genes we
showed that the pairwise distance statistics and the bootstrap values further improved upon addition of more
sequences. This showed that a stable tree topology
requires seven or more genes (data not shown). Furthermore, the topology of the phylogenetic tree was the same
when maximum likelihood or maximum parsimony estimation was used instead of BIONJ (data not shown). This
is in agreement with previously published comparisons of
reconstruction methods, showing that BIONJ is not inferior to maximum likelihood [29]. This tree confirms previous phylogenetic studies on Poeciliid fishes, based on
morphological criteria [30,31] and on genomic sequences
[25,32,33]. In the future, intraspecific polymorphisms

found in nuclear genes of feral guppy populations of different origins will be compared to previous phylogenies of
different guppy strains [34] (Willing et al. in preparation).
This will enable investigation of population structure and
mapping of quantitative adaptive traits.

Conclusion
We established a non-normalized EST library of the guppy
from embryos and six different adult tissues, containing
18,000 entries with three-fold redundancy on average. We
show that re-sequencing of 3' UTRs from genomic DNA of
different guppy strains is a powerful strategy to identify
polymorphisms existing between feral guppies of geographically different origins.
Sequence information of 10 nuclear coding genes is sufficient to reconstruct a robust teleost phylogeny including
the guppy Poecilia reticulata.

Alternatively, cDNA was transcribed from polyA+ RNA
using the manufacturer's protocol for primer extension,
which included only 6 to 10 cycles of PCR. Size fractionation of the double stranded cDNA after digestion with SfiI
was performed on a 1.2% low melting agarose gel stained
for 2 min with 0.1% methylene blue. After ligation, the
products were dialysed against H2O for 20 minutes on a
0.025 µm Millipore filter before transformation into electro competent ElectroTen-Blue cells (Stratagene). Clones
were picked at random and plasmid DNA was isolated
with a BioRobot 8000 using MagAttract 96 minipreps
(Qiagen). cDNAs were sequenced from both ends using
the pDNRlib-specific vector primers pDNRfw: AGTCAGTGAGCGAGGAAGC or pDNRrev: CCAAACGAATGGTCTAGAAAG on an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA
Analyzer. The resulting sequence trace files in ABI format
were processed with pregap4 (Staden package), using the
phred base calling algorithm [36]. Vector sequence and
low quality sequence was trimmed [21].

Methods
Guppy Strains
We used the laboratory strains Istanbul wild and Blue [15]
as well as offspring from wild-caught guppies that had
been kept in the laboratory for multiple generations. The
wild guppies were from the following locations: Lower
Oropuche and Quare Rivers strains (Oropuche Drainage,
Trinidad); Tranquille and APUFI strains (Caroni Drainage, Trinidad); Cumaná guppies (central Cumuná, Ve;
EnCCFR) [35], and PV6 (Rio San Miquel, Estado Sucre,
Ve).
RNA isolation
Whole late-eyed and very late-eyed embryos were isolated
from euthanised pregnant females. Embryos as well as
newborn fish and tissues from adult guppies were frozen
in liquid nitrogen. Frozen embryos, newborn fish, or
small pieces of tissue (Table 1) were homogenized for 90
seconds using a rotor-stator homogenizer (Polytron Pt
1200, Kinematica) at full speed and total RNA was isolated using an RNAeasy Miniprep or Midiprep kit (Qiagen). RNA from male skin was prepared using Trizol
(Invitrogen). Starting with total RNA extracted from
whole embryos of the Quare6 and Tranquille strains, newborn fish (Tranquille), adult liver (Tranquille), testis
(Blue), or skin (Oropuche2), polyA+ RNA was enriched
using Quiagen Oligotex on a spin column.
cDNA Libraries
Total RNA was reverse transcribed and cloned into a pDNRlib vector utilizing a creatorSMART™ cDNA construction
kit (Clonetech). The cDNA was amplified by 18 cycles of
long distance PCR using BD Advantage 2PCR™ enzyme
mixture, following the manufacturer's protocols.

The cDNA was preliminarily annotated based on the best
hit resulting from BLAST (version 2.5.15) or BLASTX
against the actual version of vertebrate databases available
in the GCG Wisconsin Package (em_vrt, embl_new,
tags_new, nr) [22].
EST database
A Perl script ran nightly NCBI BLASTN and BLASTX jobs
for new ESTs as well as for ESTs with BLAST results older
than a given time period. The BLAST information, including clone name, strain and tissue of origin, were stored in
the MySQL EST database (MySQL version 5.027-max;
binaries and documentation can be downloaded from
[14]. A PHP (version 5.1.2) web interface allows userfriendly access to this information and download of all
sequences in FASTA format.

Additional links allow direct access to alignments of
guppy ESTs with genomic sequences of Oryzias latipes,
Tetraodon nigroviridis, and Takifugu rubripes [37]16,200
ESTs with a minimum length of 200 bp available
sequence have been submitted to Genbank (see Table 1
for accession numbers).
The internal features of the database include a PHP web
interface for administrative tasks like uploading new ESTs,
updating of annotation, adding and changing position of
introns (predicted and found in genomic sequences) as
well as entering links to markers listed in the MySQL
marker database that also has a PHP web interface.
Analysis of genomic sequences
Gene-specific PCR primers (18 to 23 mers, Tm 59° to
62°C) were designed from P. reticulata cDNAs using the
Primer3 program (release 1.0) [38]. Genomic DNA was

extracted using a DNeasy Tissue kit (Qiagen), and was
amplified by PCR using a mixture of Taq polymerase and
Pfu (Fermentas; 1000:1 dilution) and following the protocol: 94°C for 5 min; 5 cycles of 94°C; 30 sec; 60°C, 30
sec; 68°C, 90 sec, followed by 31 cycles of 94°C, 30 sec;
touchdown to annealing temperature from 68 to 56°C,
30 sec; 68°C, 90 sec, and a final elongation step of 68°C
for 6 min. PCR products were purified using Bioline
Quick Clean and sequenced, using the same forward
primers as in the original PCR. Alternatively, M13forward
and reverse tags had been added to the gene-specific primers; the PCR protocol was 94°C for 5 min, 35 cycles of
94°C, 30 sec; 59°C, 30 sec; 68°C, 90 sec; 68°C for 6 min.
Sequencing was performed using M13 forward (5'TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3') or reverse (5'-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC-3') primers.

Authors' contributions

Phylogenetic analysis
Genes were included in the dataset if they met the following criteria: (1) orthologous sequences in each of ten species, and (2) alignable over most of the coding region.
Genes were searched by reverse BLAST between the guppy
and each of the nine other species, and considered to be
homologues if they had significant TBLASTX scores (Evalue < 10-50) and reliable sequence identity values (minimum 70% identity with D. rerio and more than 95%
identity with X. maculatus). The open reading frame of
each gene was manually examined after translating the
nucleotide sequences with the getorf module from the
EMBOSS package [39], version 3.0 [40].

Additional material

The coding regions were aligned in a codon-based manner, by translating the nucleotide sequences into peptide
sequences with transeq included in the EMBOSS package
and than aligning them with MUSCLE, version 3.6 [41].
Afterwards the nucleotide alignment was done based on
the peptide alignment using the tranalign module
included in the EMBOSS package [39]. Flanking gap
regions were deleted.
For tree estimation, the ten nucleotide alignments for
each species were concatenated to obtain a single alignment. The tree shown in Additional file 1 was reconstructed using BIONJ [26] implemented in Splitstree4
version 4.6 [28].
