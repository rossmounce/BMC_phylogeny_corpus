Signatures of selection in loci governing major
colour patterns in Heliconius butterflies and
related species
Grace C Wu1, Mathieu Joron2, Chris D Jiggins2*

Abstract
Background: Protein-coding change is one possible genetic mechanism underlying the evolution of adaptive
wing colour pattern variation in Heliconius butterflies. Here we determine whether 38 putative genes within two
major Heliconius patterning loci, HmYb and HmB, show evidence of positive selection. Ratios of nonsynonymous to
synonymous nucleotide changes (ω) were used to test for selection, as a means of identifying candidate genes
within each locus that control wing pattern.
Results: Preliminary analyses using 454 transcriptome and Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) sequences from
three Heliconius species highlighted a cluster of genes within each region showing relatively higher rates of
sequence evolution. Other genes within the region appear to be highly constrained, and no ω estimates exceeded
one. Three genes from each locus with the highest average pairwise ω values were amplified from additional
Heliconius species and races. Two selected genes, fizzy-like (HmYb) and DALR (HmB), were too divergent for
amplification across species and were excluded from further analysis. Amongst the remaining genes, HM00021 and
Kinesin possessed the highest background ω values within the HmYb and HmB loci, respectively. After accounting
for recombination, these two genes both showed evidence of having codons with a signature of selection,
although statistical support for this signal was not strong in any case.
Conclusions: Tests of selection reveal a cluster of candidate genes in each locus, suggesting that weak directional
selection may be occurring within a small region of each locus, but coding changes alone are unlikely to explain
the full range of wing pattern diversity. These analyses pinpoint many of the same genes believed to be involved
in the control of colour patterning in Heliconius that have been identified through other studies implementing
different research methods.

Background
Mechanisms by which biological information is encoded
in living systems are incredibly diverse, and the resulting
biological diversity is no less astounding. The relative
contribution of different mechanisms to adaptive phenotypic variation has been the focus of many recent evolutionary and developmental studies and the subject of
much debate [1-4]. One outstanding question is the
relative preponderance of coding versus regulatory
mutations in generating phenotypic change. Numerous
studies have shown rapid evolution of protein coding
regions of genes, for example in hominid lineages [5].

For other vertebrates, frequently cited examples of morphological variation controlled by amino acid changes
include repeated involvement of Melanocortin-1 receptor
(Mc1r) mutations in mice, birds, and reptiles in adaptive
melanic pigmentation [6-8].
Increasingly, the importance of cis-regulatory elements
(CREs) as the “creative” force in evolution has assumed
center stage [9,3]. The theoretical basis for this hypothesis is that every gene possesses a modular arrangement
of 5’ CREs that control temporal and spatial patterns of
expression, and that these regions are less subject to the
negative pleiotropic effects constraining coding changes,
allowing adaptive evolution to proceed at a higher rate
[10]. Oft-cited examples of cis-regulatory change as the
molecular basis for phenotypic variation come from

Drosophila, notably studies of the genetic control of yellow pigmentation patterning in adult wings of Drosophila biarmipes [11]. Other well-examined
morphological changes include the pelvic spine and
armoured plate in sticklebacks and bristles in Drosophila
larvae [12,13].
The Heliconius radiation presents an excellent opportunity to test these competing hypotheses in evolutionary genetics. These mimetic, aposematic butterflies are
highly phenotypically varied and complex, yet patterns
are under simple genetic control. Patterning variation
exists on multiple levels, from inter-specific, through
geographic variation within species to intra-population
polymorphism, and can be attributed to strong selection
for mimicry that also drives adaptive radiation [14,15].
Most importantly, the variation observed represents several cases of adaptive divergence and convergence, providing multiple sets of comparisons to test whether
evolution recruits the same genetic pathways to produce
similar phenotypic traits.
Joron et al. identified, through linkage mapping, a
conserved locus responsible for control of wing patterning in three Heliconius species, suggesting that a conserved region controls pattern evolution across the
genus [16]. In Heliconius melpomene, HmYb and HmB
loci are two major regions known to control the hindwing bar element and the red forewing band, respectively.
The corresponding loci in Heliconius erato, the comimic of H. melpomene, have been mapped to the same
genomic regions as HmYb and HmB, suggesting the
genetic mechanisms giving rise to shared phenotypes
across co-mimicking races may be similar. Furthermore,
these loci are characterised by multiple alleles responsible for many different phenotypes, such that we might
expect the genes responsible to have undergone multiple
rounds of strong positive selection. HmYb and HmB
have recently been annotated, and between 20 and 24
genes have been predicted in each locus [17,18].
It is currently unknown whether coding or regulatory
regions within these loci are primarily responsible for
wing pattern diversity. In parallel studies we have been
examining gene expression differences between races of
Heliconius melpomene. To complement this approach,
we here examine signatures of evolution in coding
regions by estimating the ratio (ω) of nonsynonymous
(dN) to synonymous changes (dS) in 20 and 18 putative
patterning genes within the HmYb and HmB loci,
respectively [19]. We first analysed BAC sequences,
Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) transcripts, and 454
transcriptome sequences, most of which are available for
three focal species (Heliconius melpomene, Heliconius
numata, and Heliconius erato) and two races of H. melpomene (H. m. cythera and H. m. malleti). Three
selected genes from each locus were then sequenced for

the entire coding region in several lineages of Heliconius
and a closely related genus when possible. The results
identify clusters of three or four genes with elevated
rates of evolution, but fail to provide strong statistical
evidence for diversifying selection. Nonetheless, genes
highlighted here as having high rates of protein coding
evolution are good candidates for further investigation
into their role in wing patterning, as has been recently
found for the UV opsins and their role in Heliconius
vision [20].

Results
Initial pairwise and lineage-wide estimates of dN and dS
suggest candidate patterning genes

Using available sequences of three Heliconius species
and two races, we estimated the substitution rate for
genes within the two patterning locus regions through
1) pairwise analyses with the YN00 program and 2) oneratio branch model with CODEML in the PAML suite
[21]. Since the only intra-specific comparison in these
analyses is between the trans-Andean races, H. m. malleti and H. m. cyrbia, we consider recent recombination
within sequences to be unlikely. Hence, we have explicitly accounted for recombination only in subsequent
analyses with larger numbers of intra-specific comparisons. Generally low pairwise dN and dS values suggest
that the majority of genes in the HmYb and HmB loci
are slow evolving and highly constrained (Figure 1).
Furthermore, no pairwise or background (one-ratio
model) ω values of any gene in either locus exceeded
one, which is the hallmark signature of positive selection. Conventionally, neutrality is inferred when ω = 1,
purifying or negative selection when ω < 1, and positive
or directional selection when ω > 1. However, the average ω value across sites in a gene is unlikely to be above
1 unless a large proportion of sites in the gene are
under diversifying selection [22].
Analysis of the 20 genes annotated within the HmYb
region highlights three genes on the reverse strand and
in close proximity to one another that show the highest
average pairwise and background ω values: HM00021,
LRR (HM00024), and fizzy-like (fzl; HM00025) (Table 1)
[18]. Analysis of background ω values calculated across
a phylogeny of available BAC sequences using the oneratio model also pinpointed these same three genes, as
well as HM00016, as having elevated values (Table 1;
Figure 2). Of these genes, fzl yielded the highest lineagewide ratio (ω = 0.456), which is also reflected in its
highest average pairwise value (ω = 0.480; Table 1). All
pairwise alignments of both HM00021 and fzl reveal
more nonsynonymous changes than synonymous
changes, while the number of nonsynonymous changes
never exceeded synonymous changes for analyses of
HM00016. Previous studies suggest ω > 0.5 to be the

Figure 1 Plot of dS v. dN values from pairwise PAML analyses for putative genes in the HmYb (A) and HmB (B) loci. Pairwise tests
between three polymorphic Heliconius species (H. melpomene, H. numata, H. erato) and two H. melpomene races (H. m. cythera and H. m. malleti)
exhibiting higher than average dS and dN values, are indicated by putative gene names. While the majority of genes found in these colorpatterning loci appear slow evolving and constrained, pairwise tests across species and races consistently highlighted the same outliers:
hypothetical protein HM00021 (A), Leucine-rich repeat (LRR) (A), fizzy-like (fzl) (A), and kinesin (B). Other outliers, including epoxide hydrolase (B),
show rapid rates of evolution in comparison to other genes for pairwise analyses only between H. m. melpomene and H. numata. The dashed

threshold at which adaptive evolution can be reasonably
suspected [23]. Therefore, based on their ω estimates,
genes HM00021, LRR and fzl were selected for further
analyses using expanded datasets to explore possible
adaptive evolution within the Heliconius radiation.
These genes are clustered together along the HmYb
BAC walk on the reverse strand (Figure 2).
In the HmB locus no pairwise, lineage-wide, or specific branch model tests estimated ω values that exceeded
one, though DALR (HM01004), kinesin (HM01018),
HM01022, and epoxide hydrolase (HM01014), exhibited
pairwise ω values approaching 0.5 and high background
ω values (Table 2; Figure 3). However, epoxide hydrolase (background ω = 0.219), has been slow evolving
within H. melpomene, with no nonsynonymous changes
and only three synonymous changes between H. m.
malleti and H. m. cythera, which is insufficient to accurately estimate ω (Table 2). HM01022 and DALR show
stronger signatures of selection in more recently
diverged taxa, with the number of nonsynonymous
changes exceeding synonymous changes between the
two H. melpomene races (Figure 3ATable 2). Similar to
the trend observed in HmYb, genes possessing high ω
values in HmB are found on the same strand and are
located in close proximity to each other along the locus,
albeit interspersed with genes showing lower ω values
(Figure 3).

The kinesin gene, in addition to yielding the highest
background ω value (ω = 0.393; Table 2; Figure 3B) and
second highest average pairwise ω value (ω = 0.401;
Table 2), is the only gene to possess more nonsynonymous changes than synonymous changes across all
pairwise analyses (Table 2). It is important to note that
kinesin is an unusually large gene, and most pairwise
analyses only encompassed 2 kilobases at the 3’ end,
since 454 contigs of H. m. malleti, H. m. cythera, and
H. numata only span this region (Table 2). SMART
(Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) functional
domain searches located a conserved kinesin motor
domain at the 5’ end, with the 3’ end likely conferring
protein binding specificity (for discussion of kinesin
gene structure, see [17]) [24]. Thus, our analyses do at
least include the region in which functionally significant
changes are most likely to occur. Due to an abundance
of insertions and deletions in exon 13 between H. melpomene and H. erato, the amino acid sequences were
aligned with ClustalW and only nucleotides of aligning
amino acids were used in tests of selection (Additional
file 1).

other Heliconiini lineages. In addition to HM00021
and LRR, trehalase 1A (HM00006) was included in
further analyses since its gene expression was found
to be associated with wing patterning (R. Reed, University of California, Irvine, personal correspondence;
N.J. Nadeau et al., unpublished data). Unfortunately,
we were unable to amplify fzl sequences from other
races and species, precluding further investigation.
For the HmB locus, Mad (HM01000) was included in
these expanded analyses due to its potentially important role as a mitotic checkpoint protein, suggesting
potential interactions with fzl in the HmYb locus [25].
Mad had been excluded from preliminary analyses
due to a lack of 454 raw reads for the gene, and we
were unable to amplify DALR from other races and
species.

Since genealogical topologies may differ from published Heliconius phylogenies, trees for each of the candidate genes were reconstructed by maximum likelihood
using the dnadist program in Phylip 3.69. Results show
that all six candidate genes produce an overall topology
similar to a recent Heliconius phylogeny [26]. The only
discrepancy was placement of H. charithonia, a monomorphic species, within H. erato for Mad. However,
because the bootstrap value for the branch grouping
H. charithonia with H. erato cyrbia was low (34%), the
published phylogeny was used for analysis.

controlling the yellow hindwing bar, are plotted across the genomic region for H. m. melpomene cythera and H. m. malleti calculated using
available 454 contigs, and the three focal Heliconius species, H. erato, H. numata, and H. melpomene using BAC sequences (A). The solid lines
connecting data points indicate genes found on the forward strand, while the dotted lines indicate genes located on the reverse strand. Gaps in
data reflect inadequate 454 contig coverage across races and species. Lineage-based analyses were used to estimate background ω values by
averaging ratios over all sites and across all branches of the three focal polymorphic species, as illustrated in the inset tree topology (model = 0;
NSsites = 0 in CODEML) (B). All plotted data are tabulated (Table 1).

to the preliminary estimate that included only the three
focal Heliconius taxa (ω = 0.39; Table 1). Nucleotide
sequence alignments of exon 5 revealed several indels,
some across many lineages, others specific between two
species (Additional file 2A, B). However, indels were
removed within reading frame from sequences used in
all preliminary and expanded PAML analyses. Most
notably, there is a 12 nucleotide insertion in H. charithonia, H. doris, H. numata, and H. m. malleti relative
to the H. melpomene and H. erato BAC sequences
(Additional file 2A). The amino acid alignments of exon
5 suggest that H. doris is an outgroup to the main
Heliconius clades at this gene (percent similarity

between H. melpomene and H. doris, 70%; and between
H. melpomene and H. erato, 81%; Additional file 2B).
Since phylogeny-based methods of detecting positive
selection do not take into consideration the effects of
recombination on sequence evolution, gene alignments
were analyzed using GARD (Genetic Algorithms for
Recombination Detection) to estimate recombining
breakage points [27,28]. Trees generated from the six
recombinant fragments for HM00021 were then used in
FEL (Fixed Effects Likelihood) tests for positive selection
(Table 3). Following previous analyses, we take p < 0.1
as indicative of positive selection [28]. FEL analyses of
GARD trees and the one neighbour joining tree found

one codon with a signature of positive selection at 0.1 >
p > 0.01 (Table 3). The inclusion or exclusion of race
sequences did not affect detection of sites under directional selection (Table 3).
Due to the difficulty of amplifying the entire LRR gene
(HM00024) in H. erato and other species in the pupal
mating clade, analyses included only H. charithonia (a
monomorphic species closely related to H. erato), three
races of H. melpomene (malleti, cythera, plesseni), and
BAC sequences of H. erato and H. numata. The background ω (0.23; Figure 4) across this topology is similar
to that of the preliminary background analysis (ω =
0.20; Table 2). Three breakage points were detected by
GARD analyses, and FEL tests of selection using these
recombinant partitions found no sites undergoing positive selection (Table 3). Phylogeny-wide analyses reveal
a low background ω value for trehalase 1A (ω = 0.074),
and FEL tests of selection provided no evidence for
selection.
HmB genes

Due to difficulty in amplifying the entire length of kinesin from many species, analysis of kinesin was limited to
exon 13 (1748 bps), the largest exon and also the region

that includes the predicted “binding domain” of the protein. Because exon 13 contained an abundance of nonframe-shifting indels, amino acid sequences for all races
were first aligned with ClustalW and nucleotide
sequences of only overlapping amino acid positions
were included in the PAML, GARD, and FEL analyses.
The H. doris kinesin sequence is again highly divergent
from the other Heliconius species sampled (Additional
file 1).
Kinesin ω values are the highest estimated across all
genes (Figure 5). Background, H. melpomene branch
(malleti, cythera, H. melpomene BAC), and H. erato
branch (lativitta, cyrbia, and H. erato BAC) ω values are
similar: 0.39, 0.35, and 0.40, respectively (Figure 5B).
GARD analyses generated eight predicted breakage
points, two of which showed statistically significant
topological incongruence at p = 0.05 (Table 3). One
codon was found to show evidence for positive selection
when accounting for recombination, while two codons
were identified when a single NJ tree was used for analysis (Table 3).
HM01022 showed no evidence for recombination
(Table 3), but also did not show any support for positive
selection. Estimated d N /d S ratios for Mad are low,

Fig. 2 were performed on 454 contigs and BAC sequences of genes within the HmB locus, which controls presence of the red band on the
forewing. Genes with higher than average ω values across many pair-wise (A) and lineage-wide (B) analyses include DALR (HM01004),
hypothetical protein (HM01022), and kinesin (HM01018). The solid lines connecting data points indicate genes found on the forward strand, while
the dotted lines indicate genes located on the reverse strand. The background ω could be estimated for only a limited number of genes since
there is no HmB BAC sequence for H. numata. Background ω values were calculated using available 454 contigs of H. numata.

suggesting that the gene is also highly constrained
(Figure 5A). Background ω was 0.034 and branch ω
values for H. melpomene (cythera and plesseni races
only) and H. erato were 0.071 and 0.0001, respectively
(Figure 5). Accounting for recombination did not alter
findings that there is no evidence for positive selection
in HM01022 or Mad (Table 3).

Discussion
The genetic basis of adaptation in natural populations is
an area of considerable current interest in evolutionary
biology. One major area of debate is the relative importance of protein-coding versus regulatory change in
morphological adaptation. The Heliconius butterflies
show both divergence and convergence in wing pattern,
making them an interesting system to test these

opposing hypotheses. Here, we explore protein-coding
change across two genomic regions controlling wing
pattern variation across multiple species of Heliconius.
The role of these regions in wing pattern evolution
across multiple species of Heliconius makes this a promising system to search for signatures of rapid evolution. However, our results provide little convincing
evidence for accelerated protein-coding evolution by
conventional interpretation. Although statistical support
is mixed and ω values are never significantly greater
than 1, a handful of genes do show evidence for adaptive evolution based on conservative estimates of ω ≈
0.5. Nonetheless, both genomic regions studied provide
some evidence for a clustering of genes with elevated ω,
suggesting the influence of selection on the region.
Furthermore, there is intriguing concordance between

Figure 4 Estimated ω values of HmYb candidate genes across various Heliconiini lineages. Background and lineage-specific ω values were
calculated for gene sequences amplified from various Heliconius species and races. Background ω values, calculated using the one-ratio model in
CODEML, are indicated at the base of each unrooted tree. Bolded branches indicate the major polymorphic clades for wing pattern (H.
melpomene, H. erato, H. numata). The topology of each tree was generated using amplified gene sequences by maximum likelihood. The
multiple ratios model was used to estimate lineage specific ω values for the focal polymorphic species, H. melpomene, H. numata, and H. erato
for three selected genes in the HmYb region: trehalase 1A (A), HM00021 (B), LRR (C). In addition to amplified sequences, BAC sequences are
included and indicated by shorthand: Hera (H. erato), Hnum (H. numata), Hmel (H. melpomene). The number of coding nucleotide bases
successfully sequenced and used in PAML analyses is shown over the gene total.

the genes highlighted here as having signatures of rapid
evolution, and those already identified by gene expression and population genetic surveys.
Fast evolving genes are clustered in candidate regions

Of the 20 genes analyzed for signatures of positive selection in the HmYb locus, only three genes, HM00021,
LRR, and fizzy-like, consistently showed accelerated rates
of evolution. And of the 18 examined genes in the HmB
locus, DALR, HM01022, and kinesin yielded the highest
ω values from several pairwise and lineage-wide tests of
selection. It is striking that these candidate genes group
together along the BAC walk: at the 5’ end of the HmB
locus and at the 3’ of the HmYb locus, suggesting that

in both cases a specific region in each locus may have
undergone selection. While HM00022 is also found
proximally to these genes along the same strand in
HmYb, its ω values are relatively much lower. Since
HM00022 codes for a protein that serves a known
important function (Enoyl-CoA Hydratase), it may have
experienced greater selective pressure to be functionally
constrained compared to other genes discussed here
[29]. These high ω values may indicate selection on the
protein sequence of several functionally important
genes, but perhaps more likely also indicate fixation of
“nearly neutral mutations” rather than positive selection
[30]. Genetic hitch-hiking due to repeated selective
sweeps, perhaps on neighbouring cis-regulatory regions

or untranslated regions (UTRs), could have locally
reduced the effective population size, leading to fixation
of nearly neutral coding changes [30]. Thus, repeated
selective sweeps in close proximity to these genes would
be expected to give a pattern of elevated ω values as
observed. Regions of low recombination also experience
a higher rate of nonsynonymous polymorphism and
greater rate of accumulation of nonsynonymous substitutions over time that better reflect effective population
size effects rather than positive selection [30-33]. Higher
ω values could also therefore result from lower rates of
recombination in these gene regions.
The problem of polymorphism

The general assumption of the analyses performed in
this present study is that differences between sequences
are fixed differences between the populations studied.
Of course, this will not be true in many cases, and in
particular, closely related races will share polymorphisms. Thus, what tests of positive selection assume to be
substitutions reflecting fixed changes may actually be
“pre-fixations” [34]. Taking this into consideration,
Kryazhimskiy and Plotkin suggest that ω values below
one may in fact still be a signature of strong or weak
positive selection, and this is supported by studies finding statistical evidence for adaptive evolution when ω >
0.5 with limited sequence comparisons [23,34]. In some
cases single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in
the sequences between H. m. cythera and H. m. malleti,
in which case the shared base was chosen for sequence
analyses (see Methods section). This may lead to either
artificially high or low ω estimates depending on
whether polymorphic sites account for silent or non-

silent variation. HM00021 (HmYb) was the only gene
for which high polymorphism observed in 454 sequence
reads was of concern. The potential consequences of
“majority-rule” or “minority-rule” selection of polymorphic sites was addressed by running analyses on
many possible combinations of polymorphic sites, with
no strong effect on estimated ω values.
Candidates in the HmYb locus

The ranges of many Heliconius species are broken up
into divergent wing pattern races separated by narrow
hybrid zones. Analysis of population differentiation for
the HmYb locus between such wing pattern races
showed a striking peak of population differentiation
around the LRR gene in several pairwise comparisons
[17]. Here, we have also highlighted this region, with
HM00021, LRR (HM00024), and fizzy-like (HM00025)
being relatively fast evolving.
In the HmYb locus, the only gene with tentative evidence for positive selection was HM00021. Its analyzed
data set is more robust as it includes broad representation of closely related species outside of the H. melpomene and H. erato branches. Yet, estimated rates of
synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions are likely
a conservative estimate of the true degree of sequence
divergence, since alignments revealed several indels in
the fifth and last exon of HM00021 (Additional file 2).
While the majority of indels exist between species, a
conspicuous 12 base-pair insertion in 454 contigs of
H. m. malleti was found in exon 5 relative to the H.
melpomene and H. erato BAC sequences (Additional file
2A). The method by which ω is estimated fails to capture and quantify the effects of insertions and deletions

Figure 5 Estimated ω values of HmB candidate genes across various Heliconiini lineages. Background ω values are indicated at the base
of each unrooted tree, calculated using the one-ratio model in PAML. The multiple ratios model was used to estimate lineage specific ω values
for H. melpomene, H. numata, and H. erato, the three highly polymorphic species, of three genes in the HmB region: MAD (A), kinesin (B), and
HM01022 (C). Other details regarding analyses and trees are as stated for Fig. 4.

as part and parcel of “protein-coding” mutations, as they
are theoretically equally capable as point mutations in
affecting phenotype. While detailed examination of the
distribution of synonymous and nonsynonmyous substitution sites in HM00021 revealed no discernable pattern,
indels are notably only found in exon 5. However, little
more can be inferred about HM00021’s candidacy as a
hindwing pattern switch gene since it shows no homology to any known gene and does not contain recognisable protein motifs. Amplified sequences that contain
indels maintain an open reading frame until the predicted 3’ stop codon, suggesting that HM00021 is functionally active.
Though we were unable to successfully amplify
sequences of fizzy-like from related species and races,
initial ω estimates for fzl are amongst the highest, identifying it as a promising candidate gene. Furthermore,

the gene shows highly complex patterns of alternative
splicing between races of H. melpomene that correlate
with hindwing phenotype (N.J. Nadeau et al., unpublished data). Strong 5’ UTR divergence in fzl has been
observed between races of H. melpomene, perhaps hinting at 5’ UTR involvement in regulation of alternative
splicing (N.J. Nadeau et al., unpublished data). While a
great diversity of regulatory mechanisms for alternative
splicing exist, including usage of regulatory modules
that have been found in exons and introns, recent studies point to alternative 5’ UTRs as important mechanisms in differential, complex, and highly targeted gene
regulation [35,36]. Such findings, in conjunction with
results in this present study, suggest that this gene may
be a target for selection, either within the coding region,
or on neighbouring non-coding regions that regulate
splicing in fzl.

Candidates in the HmB locus

In population genetic surveys between two Peruvian
races of H. melpomene, a region of the HmB locus surrounding the kinesin gene was shown to be highly differentiated [17]. Even more compelling, gene expression
studies showed parallel expression changes between
races of H. melpomene and H. erato in exon 13 of the
kinesin gene and in-situ hybridization experiments suggest consistent spatial and temporal patterns of gene
expression on the forewing [37]. At kinesin, rates of evolution are relatively high along both the H. erato and H.
melpomene branches, though ω values do not significantly differ from each other or from the background
ratio (Figure 5B). Alignments of kinesin sequences
amplified from many species and races revealed not
only an abundance of SNPs, but also a profusion of
indels that maintained open reading frames, suggesting
that rapid sequence evolution had not simply resulted in
non-functional proteins. Between the BAC sequences of
H. erato and H. melpomene across exon 13, there are at
least nine indels ranging in size from one to eight
amino acids (Additional file 1A). Surprisingly, indel patterns do not agree with overall sequence divergence patterns in that H. melpomene and H. charithonia, species
belonging to each of the two main clades, appear to
share many of the amino acid indels (Additional file
1A). Together, the evidence supports kinesin’s strong
candidacy as a potential HmB switch gene.
Not surprisingly, these very genes of interest identified
in preliminary BAC analyses as the most “fast evolving,”
such as fzl, DALR, and kinesin, were difficult to amplify
across species for further phylogeny-based analyses.
Thus, in some ways our methods are biased against the
most interesting genes. Fortunately however, analyses
using BAC sequences available for three Heliconius species include all genes in the region, so are not biased in
this way.

Conclusions
The present study did not find strong support for protein-coding changes, at least those detectable through
codon-based analyses, to be responsible for the control
of major wing pattern elements in Heliconius. However,
these analyses have been valuable in highlighting regions
within each locus that show some signature of selection.
Such patterns hint at the possibility of selection primarily acting on non-coding or regulatory regions found
between or proximal to those genes, which have reduced
effective population sizes in surrounding genomic
regions. Interestingly, the identification of these gene
regions corroborates the findings of related research
efforts.
Over recent years, a paradigm has emerged for the
origin of novel morphological adaptations that involves

Page 11 of 14

co-option of genes with conserved functions through
novel regulatory interactions. However, this paradigm
has arisen from studies using methods that are inherently biased towards discovering roles for conserved
genes, such as the use of cross-staining antibodies. Here,
we have found higher rates of sequence evolution in
genes showing little or no homology to known proteins.
The strong candidate gene for the yellow band (HmYb),
fizzy-like (HM00025) shares at most only 26% aminoacid identity with other members of the fizzy-family.
Findings from this present study raise the suspicion that
some genes involved in wing colour patterning of Heliconius may be evolving so rapidly that homology cannot
be easily established.

Methods
Sequence data acquisition for preliminary analyses

Protein-coding sequences of all predicted genes within
the HmYb and HmB loci were used to search the NCBI
Lepidoptera nucleotide and EST databases using
tBLASTn to acquire Bicyclus, Papilio, Bombyx, Spodoptera and any related Lepidoptera nucleotide sequences.
We searched consensus EST contigs available on Butterflybase http://butterflybase.ice.mpg.de/ and 454 transcriptome sequences using local BLAST, which were
available for the following species/races: Heliconius melpomene cythera (short read archive accession number
SRX005618),
Heliconius
melpomene
malleti
(SRX005617), Heliconius numata population 1 (Tarapoto, Peru, Huallaga biogeographic region; SRX014029),
Heliconius numata population 2 (Yurimaguas, Peru,
Ucayali biogeographic region; SRX014035), and Heliconius erato [18].
Preliminary pairwise and lineage-wide evolutionary
analyses

Using CodonCode alignment software, 454 consensus
sequences and raw reads of each species or race for
each gene were aligned against the BAC sequence to
ensure that the transcripts were from the genes of interest. After eliminating misaligning transcripts, sequences
were assembled into one contig per taxon per gene.
Contigs were truncated to give a core region of maximum overlap between all species and compiled into
input files formatted for analysis using PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood; Ziheng Yang,
Department of Biology, University College London).
Input files were analyzed with the YN00 program using
the method of Yang and Nielsen [38] to estimate pairwise rates of non-synonymous (d N ) and synonymous
substitutions (dS) between taxa (run mode = -2). If BAC
sequences were available for all three Heliconius species
of interest (H. melpomene, H. numata, and H. erato),
the one-ratio model was applied using the CODEML

Wu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:368
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/368

program in PAML, with fixed rates (model = 0, NSsites
= 0), to calculate a single background dN/dS (ω) for each
tree per gene. Occasionally, complete consensus
sequences constructed from 454 contigs were used to
substitute missing BAC sequences. Analyses were not
run on genes with sparse or no coverage from 454
sequences.
When polymorphisms were observed between contigs
or raw reads within a race or species, several analyses
were run on possible variants or haplotypes of the
sequence. The preferred method was majority rule, in
which the most commonly observed base was selected,
but alternative base selections were also tested and the
most conservative estimate, or the lowest ω value, was
reported. Pairwise and background estimates of ω were
plotted across the HmYb and HmB loci (Figure 2, 3).
Gene annotation images of the HmYb and HmB BAC
walks are previously published [17,18].
Amplifying candidate genes from related species of
Heliconiini

Pupae of H. m. cythera, H. m. plesseni, H. numata, Heliconius erato lativitta, Heliconius erato cyrbia, Heliconius
himera, Heliconius doris, Heliconius charitonia, Heliconius sara, Heliconius hecale, and Dione juno were purchased from Stratford Butterfly Farm, UK. Forewings,
hindwings, and thorax tissue were dissected at the early
pupal (EP) and early melanin (EM) stages to be stored
in RNAlater at -80 C (for staging see [39]).
Total RNA was extracted from whole forewing and
hindwing tissue separately using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and an RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and treated with
DNAse using a TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion). RNA
samples (2 ug) were reversed transcribed into cDNA
using Bioscript (Bioline) and random hexamer primers.
Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from <25 mg of
thoracic tissue for each species/race using a DNeasy Kit
(Qiagen). Final DNA concentration was adjusted to 25
ng/ul for all subsequent RT-PCR reactions. The RPS13
housekeeping gene was amplified from all cDNA and
gDNA samples as a positive control.
For each of the eight candidate genes that were
selected based on preliminary tests of selection or previous population genetics analyses, multiple primers
were designed using the BAC sequences to amplify
these genes from extrated cDNA and gDNA (Additional
file 3). Primers were initially tested with EP and EM
cDNA. Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR) contained
20-50 ng of cDNA, 1x reaction buffer, 2.0 mM MgCl2,
0.2 mM dNTPs, 50 pmol of each primer, 0.1 ul of Taq
polymerase (Bio-Line) and were run in a thermal cycler
with the following conditions: 2 min at 94°C, 40 cycles
of 20 s at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C, 2 min at 72°C, and 72°C
final extension. PCR products were visualized on a 1.5%

Page 12 of 14

agarose gel. When no PCR product bands were
observed, PCR experiments were repeated at lower
annealing temperatures (51 - 49°C). If amplification continued to prove unsuccessful, likely due to developmental stage specific gene expression, PCR experiments
were repeated with gDNA and gDNA-specific primers.
When multiple bands were observed due to non-specific amplification and/or amplification of two alleles
with different intronic insertions or deletions, bands
were cut from the gel and PCR products extracted using
NucleoSpin Extract II Kit (Macherey-Nagel). If multiple
PCR products were too similar in size to cleanly separate by cutting, PCR products were cloned using either
a TOPO TA cloning kit with one-shot chemically competent cells (Invitrogen) or a pGEM-T easy cloning kit
with JM-109 chemically competent cells (Promega).
Depending on the number of different PCR products
observed in each reaction, 5 to 20 colonies were chosen
per transformation, and cells were collected, suspended
in 50 ul of sterile water, lysed for 5 minutes at 95°C,
and used directly as template in subsequent PCR reactions with either M13 or T7/SP6 primers. PCR products
were prepared using a standard big dye protocol before
sequencing using an ABI13730 capillary sequencer.
All amplified sequences not previously available were
deposited in Genbank. Accession numbers are as follows:
HM00001 (trehalase 1a) [Heliconius melpomene plesseni
(HQ328814), Heliconius doris, (HQ328815), Heliconius
erato lativitta (HQ328816), Heliconius sara (HQ328817),
Heliconius charithonia (HQ328818)]; HM00021 (hypothetical protein) [H. doris (HQ328805), H. m. plessseni
(HQ328806), Heliconius erato cyrbia (HQ328807), H. e.
lativitta (HQ328808), Heliconius himera (HQ328809),
H. charithonia (HQ328810), H. sara (HQ328811)];
HM00024 (LRR) [H. m. plesseni (HQ328812), H. charithonia (HQ328813)]; HM01000 (MAX-dimerization)
[H. himera (HQ328819), H. e. cyrbia (HQ328820), H.
charithonia (HQ328821), H. e. plesseni (HQ328822),
Dione juno (HQ328823)]; HM01018 (rab-kinesin)
[H. doris (HQ328824), H. charithonia (HQ328825), H. e.
cyrbia (HQ328826), H. e. lativitta (HQ328827)];
HM01022 (ashwin) [H. e. plesseni (HQ328828), H. doris
(HQ328829), H. himera (HQ328830), H. charithonia
(HQ328831), H. e. lativitta (HQ328832), H. e. cyrbia
(HQ328833)].
Tests of selection across closely and distantly related
species/races

Sequence traces were trimmed and contigs of each species were assembled for each gene using CodonCode
Aligner software. Phylogenetic trees were newly constructed for each gene using Maximum Likelihood (ML)
in Phylip 3.69 (Joseph Felsenstein, University of
Washington). The dnaml program with the JTT (Jones

Wu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:368
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/368

Taylor Thornton) model category was used to calculate
distances. Bootstrap re-sampling was done with 100
replicates using the Seqboot program. Matrices were
then transformed into trees using the Fitch-Margoliash
tree drawing method without molecular clock, and a
consensus tree was produced using the Consense
program.
The topologies of these genealogies were compared to
the most recent published studies of Heliconius phylogenetics [26]. When the two topologies differed, the Phylip
generated candidate gene tree was used as the tree file
for PAML analyses. However, nodes with bootstrap
values below 50 were resolved using known phylogenetic
relationships between species [26].
When nucleotide sequences contained many indels
(for kinesin and HM00021), protein translations were
aligned using ClustalW and non-overlapping regions
excluded from analyses (see Additional files 1, 2 for
alignments). All available contigs for each gene were formatted into single infiles compatible with PAML.
Tests of selection were run using the CODEML program in PAML, using the one-ratio model (NSsites = 0;
model = 0) to produce a single dN/dS (ω) for each tree,
and the free-ratios model (NSsites = 0; model = 1),
which calculates different ω values for each branch.
Analyses were again rerun with model = 2, or the multiple-ratios model, producing different ω for groups
labelled in the tree file. To compare rates of evolution
in the ‘diverse lineages’, H. melpomene, H. numata, and
H. erato, branches in these clades were assigned separate
labels and ω values estimated separately.
The effect of recombination events on detecting positively selected sites for the six selected candidate genes
was investigated using GARD (Genetic Algorithms for
Recombination Detection) available on the http://datamonkey.org HyPhy webserver [28]. AIC C scores rank
goodness of fit of a model, with lower scores being better. ΔAICC is a measure of fit of a model accounting for
recombination breakpoints, with the greater the difference between the AICC scores of the null and recombinant models, the better the fit. KH tests determine
statistical significance of incongruence between tree
topologies generated using recombinant fragments and
are reported in addition to ΔAICC scores for model validation. GARD topologies generated using recombinant
fragments were then used for FEL (Fixed Effects Likelihood) tests of selection [40].

Additional material
Additional file 1: ClustalW amino acid alignment of exon 13 of
kinesin (HmB). The alignment reveals at least 12 discrete regions of
indels (A). All nucleotide sequences, despite the abundance of indels,
maintain open reading frames until the end of the exon. In comparison

Page 13 of 14

to the remainder of this large gene, the vast majority of indels are found
within exon 13, which is the penultimate and largest exon. Though
overall sequence alignment predicts greater similarity between H. erato
and H. charithonia (B), an examination of the pattern of indels suggests
that H. melpomene and H. charithonia share a similar pattern. Blue boxes
indicate shared sequence deletion between H. melpomene and H.
charithonia, and orange boxes indicate shared insertion of amino acids
(A). An unrooted phylogram of exon 13 constructed using the dnaml
program in Phylip reveals larger H. doris sequence divergence (C).
Additional file 2: ClustalW amino acid alignment of exon 5 of
HM00021 (HmYb). Alignment reveals four regions of insertions and
deletions (A). All nucleotide sequences, despite the indels, maintain open
reading frames until the end of the exon. All indels are found within
exon 5, which is the last and largest exon, and the region with the most
454 contig support. A comparison of alignment scores indicates that H.
erato and H. melpomene share highest sequence similarity and that H.
doris has the most divergent sequence (B).
