Abstract
Background: Iterative DNA "resequencing" on oligonucleotide microarrays offers a high-throughput
method to measure intraspecific biodiversity, one that is especially suited to SNP-dense gene regions such
as vertebrate mitochondrial (mtDNA) genomes. However, costs of single-species design and microarray
fabrication are prohibitive. A cost-effective, multi-species strategy is to hybridize experimental DNAs from
diverse species to a common microarray that is tiled with oligonucleotide sets from multiple, homologous
reference genomes. Such a strategy requires that cross-hybridization between the experimental DNAs
and reference oligos from the different species not interfere with the accurate recovery of species-specific
data. To determine the pattern and limits of such interspecific hybridization, we compared the efficiency
of sequence recovery and accuracy of SNP identification by a 15,452-base human-specific microarray
challenged with human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and codfish mtDNA genomes.
Results: In the human genome, 99.67% of the sequence was recovered with 100.0% accuracy. Accuracy
of SNP identification declines log-linearly with sequence divergence from the reference, from 0.067 to
0.247 errors per SNP in the chimpanzee and gorilla genomes, respectively. Efficiency of sequence recovery
declines with the increase of the number of interspecific SNPs in the 25b interval tiled by the reference
oligonucleotides. In the gorilla genome, which differs from the human reference by 10%, and in which 46%
of these 25b regions contain 3 or more SNP differences from the reference, only 88% of the sequence is
recoverable. In the codfish genome, which differs from the reference by > 30%, less than 4% of the
sequence is recoverable, in short islands ≥ 12b that are conserved between primates and fish.
Conclusion: Experimental DNAs bind inefficiently to homologous reference oligonucleotide sets on a resequencing microarray when their sequences differ by more than a few percent. The data suggest that
interspecific cross-hybridization will not interfere with the accurate recovery of species-specific data from
multispecies microarrays, provided that the species' DNA sequences differ by > 20% (mean of 5b
differences per 25b oligo). Recovery of DNA sequence data from multiple, distantly-related species on a
single multiplex gene chip should be a practical, highly-parallel method for investigating genomic
biodiversity.

Background
The development of DNA microarrays or "chips" has
greatly increased the rate at which genomic data can be
gathered. This highly-parallel technology has enabled
thousands of genes or tens of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to be recovered in a single
experiment [1]. Most such arrays have been designed to
assay variation within single species, such as Drosophila
melanogaster [2] or humans, either among tissues (e.g.,
cancerous versus non-cancerous cell lines ([3,4], or among
individuals that differ in some biomedically significant
trait (e.g., obese versus non-obese patients [5]. But for evolutionary biologists, it is of greater interest to know how
variation among species will be accommodated on speciesspecific microarrays. Consider two complementary questions. Can a microarray designed for the genome of one
species recover accurate information on the genome of a
closely-related species? Can a microarray that incorporates assays for homologous but distantly-related genes of
different species successfully discriminate DNA from
those species [6]?
The answers to these questions are of practical and theoretical interest. Evolutionary biologists are often interested in genetic relationships within and among more or
less closely-related taxa of non-model organisms. Current
costs of novel microarray design and execution of speciesspecific microarray experiments are prohibitive. Population and taxonomic studies would be more practical, if a
common microarray design were useful over a broader
range of taxa, say species within genera or closely-related
families. Alternatively, if any given design is specific to a
limited range of taxa, multiplex studies of more distantlyrelated taxa on the same microarray may be feasible. Here,
we address the former question, and its implications for
the latter, by measuring the ability of a species-specific
DNA re-sequencing microarray to recover information
from experimental DNAs over a wide range of sequence
divergences.
DNA microarrays are commonly used to measure differential gene expression in cDNA libraries synthesized from
mRNA transcriptomes, so as to determine which genes are
active, where, and at what levels across experimental treatments (reviewed in [7]). Variant Detector Arrays (VDAs)
measure not gene expression, but rather to variation in
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) among samples
of interest [8]. VDAs rely on the ability of a ssDNA in the
experimental sample to recognize and bind to its perfect
oligonucleotide complement. A refinement of VDA
microarrays is to evaluate, not just known SNPs, but all
potential SNPs within a particular gene region. As developed by Affymetrix for their "GeneChip" protocols [9], a
reference DNA sequence is represented on the microarray
as a series of overlapping 25-base oligonucleotides ("oli-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/339

gos"), one for each position in the sequence. For each
oligo, three additional variant oligos are included, each of
which varies the central (13th) base. All possible SNP variants of a reference sequence of length n are thus represented on the microarray by a set of 4 × n
oligonucleotides. An experimental sequence with any particular SNP variant in this quartet will hybridize with
greatest fidelity to its exact complement, as indicated by
the relative intensities of each of the probes bound at that
position [10,11]. This procedure has been dubbed "resequencing," since it re-reads multiple homologous
sequences in comparison with the reference sequence.
Over the past 25 years, studies of mtDNA have been
extraordinarily successful in clarifying evolutionary relationships within and among species, due to a number of
useful properties, including maternal inheritance, high
rate of sequence evolution, and lack of recombination
[11]. Gene order is broadly conserved across diverse vertebrate taxa. Recent comparative studies of multiple complete mtDNA genomes, both within [12,13] and among
species [14,15], have demonstrated the power of genomics to investigate phenomena of intra- and interspecific
population biology and evolution based on well-resolved,
highly-corroborated gene trees [6]. The mtDNA genome
has also been implicated in a number of human biomedical conditions [16,17].
One of the first applications of mtDNA to the study of
evolution was an evaluation of the tempo and mode of
molecular evolution of higher primates [18]. Studies of
mtDNA and other genetic macromolecules have now
established that the closest relatives of humans (Homo
sapiens) are chimpanzees (Pan spp., including the Common Chimpanzee (P. troglodytes) and the Pygmy Chimp
or Bonobo (P. paniscus)), with which we share a common
ancestor ~5 MYBP [19]. The next closest relatives of
chimps and humans are gorillas (G. gorilla), from which
the chimp/human lineage diverged perhaps 7 MYBP [20].
Levels of mtDNA genome diversity vary among hominoid
primate species, and are apparently lowest in Homo
[21,12], due in part to our quite recent emergence "Out of
Africa." Common Chimpanzees have a more polymorphic mitochondrial genome than humans, and variability
within the Mountain Gorilla is as high as that between the
two Pan species [22]. The greater diversity of apes in comparison with humans may be due to their historically
more fragmented populations, differences in male and
female migration, or directional selection [23]. There is
now extensive interest in comparing the genetic material
of humans and their closest relatives. The nuclear genome
sequences of chimps and humans are more than 98%
similar, and the focus of investigation is those differences
that contribute to the uniqueness of the human species
[24].

We investigated the efficiency and accuracy of microarray
resequencing where experimental and microarray reference sequences are from different species, and the influence of the degree of sequence divergence on that
performance. We use a human-specific mitochondrial
DNA array [16] to resequence the homologous genomes
of another human, as well as our two closest relatives,
chimpanzee and gorilla, and a distant relative, Atlantic
Cod (Gadus morhua). We compare these results to those
obtained by conventional dideoxy sequencing. These
experiments explore the limits of interspecies in silico
hybridization, and in so doing contribute to the design
and use of resequencing arrays for the study of intra- and
interspecific population genomic evolution [6].

Results
Dideoxy reference sequences
The reference microarray included 15452 bp of the revised
Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) [25], without the
D-loop region. Dideoxy sequencing identified 1283 interspecific SNPs in the chimpanzee sequence as compared to
this sequence. The sequence divergence is 8.21% between
the two genomes. SNP density varied from 0 to 21 polymorphisms per 100 bases over the genome (Figure 1a). In
the gorilla, there were 1600 single nucleotide polymorphisms, for an sequence divergence of 10.44% between
the two genomes. As in the chimpanzee genome, SNP
density was not uniform and varied from 1 to 22 per 100
bases (Figure 1b). SNP densities per 25 bp (the interval
tiled by each oligo quartet) are given in Table 1. These
range from 0 to 12, with a mode of 2 in both species.

For the human comparison, we used an individual whose
mtDNA genome sequence was known to differ from the
tiled reference sequence by 32 SNPs (0.21% sequence
divergence) in the region sequenced here [26].

Comparison with microarray sequencing
Results of the chimpanzee and gorilla microarray
sequencing experiments are presented as 2 × 2 tables in
which calls of "SNP" or "non-SNP" by the microarray are
classified as correct or incorrect in comparison with the
known dideoxy reference sequence, which is taken as
canonical. In the small number of cases where the dideoxy
sequence traces might be regarded as ambiguous, the
microarray confirmed the calls made a priori. We define
efficiency as the overall proportion of bases called correctly
by the microarray with respect to the canonical sequence,
whether variable or not. We define accuracy as the proportion of known interspecific SNPs correctly identified with
respect to the tiled microarray reference sequence Each of
these four classes of calls may be further classified as of
high or low confidence, for a total of eight classes (Table
2). Confidence in any call can be described as the ratio of
the highest signal intensity to alternative signals, calculated as a differential signal-to-noise ratio (dS/N) as
defined in Methods. We describe as "high-confidence"
calls those made at dS/N greater than a designated cut-off.
These may be either correct or incorrect ("errors"). For
"low-confidence" calls, made with respect to a canonical
sequence taken as a "null hypothesis", those that match
that sequence are counted as correct, and those that do
not are counted as "N". Considered without respect to
such a sequence, all low-confidence calls are counted as
"N".

The content and arrangement of the cells in these tables
therefore differs from conventional 2 × 2 contingency
tables, so as to emphasize the computation of correct,
incorrect, and 'N' calls. The inclusion of an 'N' category
also makes a conventional ROC analysis problematic. It is
important to appreciate that accurate identification of
SNPs sites ('true positives') is a more important criterion
of success than the total number of correct calls, including
non-SNP sites ('true negatives'), because the latter do not
contribute informative data to phylogenetic analysis. For
example, given 1000 sites with 10 SNPs, the correct identification of all 10 SNPs along with 890 invariant sites and
100 'N's is a more desirable outcome than correct identification of 5 SNPs along with 5 SNP erros, 985 invariant
sites, and 5 'N's, even though the conventional accuracy
rates are 90% and 99%, respectively.
Among six human mtDNA genomes resequenced on a
human-specific microarray, an empirical cut-off rule of
dS/N = 0.13 allowed exclusion of all spurious SNPs, and
correct identification of all known SNPs [26]. For the two
primate resequencing experiments, we plotted the
number of incorrect SNP calls made with various dS/N
cut-offs between 0.05 and 0.50 (Figure 2). In Pan, error
rates are < 1% at dS/N = 0.20 or greater, and are markedly
greater at dS/N = 0.13 (0.61%) than at dS/N = 0.2

Efficiency is the proportion of SNP and non-SNP sites identified correctly as compared with the canonical dideoxy sequence, either at high or low
efficiency. Accuracy is the proportion of SNPs identified correctly. Correct and erroneous calls may be made at either high or low confidence,
differentiated by dS/N= 0.20 (see Methods and Figure 2). The table is equivalent to a conventional 2 × 2 contingency table, with the categories on
the second line transposed. This arrangement emphasizes the column totals of correct versus incorrect calls, and the assignment of low-confidence
incorrect calls as Ns, in Tables 3, 4, and 5.

(0.31%). We therefore use dS/N = 0.20 as the cut-off for
high- and low-confidence calls in this study.
Efficiency and accuracy of microarray sequencing
With reference to the known dideoxy sequence, resequencing efficiency of the human mtDNA was 99.96%,
including 98.44% and 1.52% of calls at high and low confidence, respectively (Table 3). All 32 known SNPs were
identified, 24 at high confidence (100.00% accuracy).

With reference to their known sequences, resequencing
efficiencies of the chimpanzee and gorilla mtDNAs were
85.07% and 88.45%, respectively (Tables 4 and 5). Of
1283 known chimpanzee SNPs, 72.49% were correctly
identified (including 38.81% and 33.67% at high- and
low-confidence, respectively), and 26.19% were errors at

low-confidence that were counted as "N" s. There were
2.42% high-confidence errors. Of 1600 known gorilla
SNPs, 67.19% were called correctly (46.50% and 20.69%
at high-and low-confidence, respectively), and 19.13%
were "N" s. There were 19.25% high-confidence errors.
Without reference to the known dideoxy sequences, as
would be the case for de novo microarray sequencing of an
unknown genome, low-confidence calls cannot be
assigned a priori as either correct or incorrect. Then, in the
chimpanzee, 50.40% of calls were correct at high-confidence, 49.40% were "N" s. There were 0.20% errors as
before, and only 38.81% of SNPs were identified with
high confidence. In the gorilla, 66.64% of calls were correct at high confidence, 30.37% were "N" s. There were
1.99% errors, and only 46.50% of SNPs were identified
with high confidence.
The lower absolute efficiency and rate of SNP detection in
the chimpanzee experiment as compared to that with the
gorilla reflect lower probe intensities in the former. To
compare interspecies efficiency and accuracy more
directly, analysis of 6299 homologous positions called at
high confidence in both species indicated a 0.41% error
rate in the chimpanzee as compared with 2.11% in the
gorilla. Of 379 chimpanzee SNP sites in this subset,
93.35% were correctly identified, as compared with
75.32% of 504 SNP sites in the gorilla genome Tables (6).

Effect of SNP density on efficiency, accuracy, and probe
intensity
In the chimpanzee experiment, correct high-confidence
calls were made at a mean SNP density of 4.72% (i.e., 1.18
interspecific SNPs per 25 bps). Incorrect, high confidence
calls occurred at SNP densities of 6.44 ~9.14 %. Correct,
low-confidence calls occurred in regions with approximately 11% SNP density, above which, low confidence,
incorrect calls occurred (Table 4). SNP densities in the
gorilla followed the same general trends: correct high-confidence calls occurred at SNP densities < 8.64%. Incorrect,
high-confidence calls occurred at SNP densities of 13.66

regions with 13.47 to 17.16% SNP density, above which,
low confidence, incorrect calls occurred (Table 5).

bp correctly resequenced in these regions correspond to
3.83% of the cod genome.

Discussion
Miscall rates ranged from 0 ~57 per 100 bps in the chimpanzee and from 0 ~44 per 100 bps in gorilla, the majority
of which were found at low confidence in both experiments (Figure 3). The density of SNPs between the chimpanzee or gorilla and human genomes is positively
correlated with the number of miscalls between these
pairs. That is, as interspecific sequence divergence
increases, so does the degree of miscalling and the errors
observed in the microarray resequencing relative to the
dideoxy sequencing.
Resequencing of Atlantic Cod mtDNA
Resequencing of mtDNA from Atlantic Cod (> 38%
sequence divergence from human) on the human microarray generally produced extremely low probe intensities
and dS/N values (Figure 4). The experiment identified 30
regions of > 12 contiguous bases called at high confidence, including one region of 120 bp that differed by
only three mismatches between human and cod. The 592

sequences, as would be the case if these were new individuals from the same species sequenced for the first time,
efficiency of high-confidence sequence recovery falls to

subset, overall error rates remain < 2%, however, accuracy
of SNP identification falls from > 98% in chimpanzee to
< 80% in gorilla.

In resequencing closely-related humans whose pairwise
sequence differences are << 1%, it is possible to adopt the
null hypothesis that any site is invariant with respect to

the tiled reference sequence, unless there is good evidence
to the contrary. For example, among persons of European
ancestry studied by Ingman et al. [12], the greatest pairwise difference in the 15452 bp region studied is 33 SNPs
and is typically less than 20 (Figure 5). The dS/N can then
be calculated as the difference between the strongest combined probe intensity and the reference base at any position [26]. Under these constraints, overall efficiency is
extremely high, and high-confidence false-negative errors
are rare to non-existent. Low-confidence false-positive
errors are more common, the rate being determined by
the dS/N criterion adopted. In contrast, there are 134 and
123 SNP differences, respectively, between the experimental chimpanzee and gorilla genomes sequenced here and
their corresponding NCBI references [19], such that those
references do not provide reliable null hypotheses. Then,
one must rely on a confidence criterion to include or
exclude putative SNPs, with consequent loss of information and/or accuracy

Decline in efficiency is log-linear with respect to sequence
divergence (Figure 6). Extrapolation of the curve indicates
that efficiency of sequence recovery would approach zero
at ~20% observed sequence divergence. Such a divergence
is typical of inter-ordinal or inter-class comparisons
among vertebrate animals [27]. Some regions of the
mtDNA are highly conserved evolutionarily, e.g., the 12S
and 16S rDNA genes [28]. The cod resequencing experiment identified one contiguous tract of 120 bp in the 16S
rDNA locus, within which there are only three nucleotide
substitutions between primates and fish. These regions
appear to be monomorphic within species or among
closely related species [29].
Thus, microarray resequencing of experimental DNA
genomes that diverge on average less than ~10% from the
reference is able to recover a large part of the target
sequence correctly. However, many of these calls are made
at low confidence. The error rate is relatively low, but

errors are more common at interspecies SNP sites than
elsewhere, and the error rate increases sharply with the
small added sequence divergence from chimpanzee to
gorilla. Errors occur more or less uniformly over a wide
range of probe intensities and confidence values. An
increase in the stringency of the confidence criterion
beyond a certain point does not increase accuracy, and
only excludes more of the data (Figure 2).
Influence of SNP density on efficiency and accuracy
In a microarray experiment, the presence of a SNP in an
experimental sequence affects not only its binding to the
oligo quartet tiling the corresponding position, but also to
the 24 additional quartets in the 12 bp on either side of
the SNP position. Among these 100 oligos, only one will
match the target perfectly, 27 will mismatch at one position (three because of the chip design, 24 because of the
SNP), and 72 will mismatch at two positions. Thus,
reduced probe binding strength is expected on either side
of a SNP, even at invariant sites. We typically observed Ns
within a few bp of isolated SNPs. In human mtDNA, SNPs

are typically spaced at 100s of bp with respect to the tiled
reference, and are frequently associated with runs of
lower-confidence Ns [26]. Regions in the ape genomes
where SNPs are spaced > 25 bp apart are also associated
with Ns, and are typically called correctly and at high confidence. Runs of Ns are associated with interspecific SNPs
among higher primates resequenced on a human nuclear
BRCA-specific microarray [30], where the SNP density is
much lower than in mtDNA [31].
Where two SNPs occur within the 25 bp region covered by
a particular SNP-specific oligo quartet, probe binding is
affected at intermediate invariant positions. The pattern is
specific and predictable. Consider two SNPs at an interval
of 25 b, where one oligo quartet tiles one invariant position exactly 12 bp from either SNP. All four oligos in this
set will have mismatches at their terminal (1st and 25th)
positions, and three of four have an internal mismatch at
the central (13th) position. Binding and probe intensity
will be severely reduced by these two or three mismatches,
in comparison to the two adjacent positions, where only
one or two mismatches occur. Where SNPs are spaced 13
<n # 25b apart, the interference will extend to [(2)(25 - n)
+ 1] oligo quartets tiling the intermediate positions
("Flynn' s Rule"). In the ape data, we typically observe low
probe intensity at all positions between two SNPs that
occur within 25b. Precise patterns for any given oligo will

at least as divergent as this from human. In cod, where an
average of > 9 SNPs/oligo are expected, more than 95% of
the cod mtDNA genome binds weakly if at all to the
human-specific microarray.

Conclusion
be influenced by other factors, such as [G+C] content and
distribution.
Multiple SNPs in the 25b region tiled by the oligo quartet
further destabilize binding, and extensive tracts of Ns and
miscalls are common. The data in Tables 4 &5 suggest
some general guidelines, when SNP densities are
expressed as expected numbers of SNP differences
between experimental DNA and tiled oligo target, as in
Table 1. High-confidence, accurate calls occur where the
experimental sequence differs from the tiled array by 1 ~2
SNPs per 25b oligo, as is the case for about 67% and 54%
of chimpanzee and gorilla genomes, respectively. At differences of 3 ~4 SNPs/oligo, high-confidence incorrect
calls are common, which result in positive misidentification of SNPs; 28% and 34% of the chimpanzee and gorilla
genomes fall in this category. At these densities, there is
still sufficient sequence similarity for some probe-target
hybridization to occur, although not always with accurate
results. Where there are 5 SNPs/oligo or more (that is,
when the experimental DNA differs from the reference oligos by an average of 20%), the decreased homology prevents binding with sufficient fidelity to discriminate
accurately among SNP-specific oligos and generate highconfidence calls. This matches the prediction from Figure
6. The remaining 6% and 12% of the two ape genomes are

Multi-species resequencing: implications for the "ArkChip"
For the primate genomicist, the optimum result of these
experiments would have been efficient and accurate interspecific probe-target annealing with performance identical to that obtained within species. However, the goal of
the present experiments was not to recover the chimpanzee, gorilla, or cod sequences, but rather to ascertain the
limits of specificity of the human microarray. For the nonprimate genomicist, the desirable result would be a complete failure of heterologous DNA to anneal to the human
microarray. In the case of fish mtDNA, this is very nearly
achieved (Figure 4). This "failure" indicates that it should
be possible to tile both mammal and fish mtDNA
genomes on the same microarray, apply a mixed pool of
both species= DNAs to the chip, obtain species-specific
annealing, and generate efficient and accurate sequences
of both, simultaneously.

This is the essential idea behind the ArkChip. Using the
new generation of microarrays that accommodates > 120
Kbp of reference sequence, we have designed a multispecies tiling that includes the complete forward and reverse
sequences of the mtDNA genomes (including Control
Regions) of three mammal species in different orders,
three ray-finned fish species in different subclasses, and
one bird species. Minimum interspecific divergence for
these comparisons is > 23% ([6]. Experiments show that

species genomes in two- and four-taxon combinations,
from different orders and classes, are successfully and
accurately sequenced (A. T. Duggan and S. M. Carr, work
in progress).
Although the gorilla was only ~2% more divergent from
human than the chimpanzee, the corresponding 3 ~4-fold
increase in SNP identification errors indicates that this
degree of divergence is at or beyond the limit the useful
limits of interspecies microarray sequencing. The log-linear trend line suggests extinction of usable probe annealing at 15 ~20% divergence. It will be useful to define this
empirically. For this purpose, our next closest primate relatives are orang-utans (Pongo: ~14% mtDNA sequence difference) and gibbons (Hylobates: ~17% difference) [19],
followed by Old World Monkeys (Cercopithecidae, inc.
Papio: ~25% difference) [32]. At the other end of the scale,
mtDNA from our ancient cousins, such as Homo neanderthalensis [33]), might provide information as to how
microarrays perform at less than 8% divergence. Alternatively, given the multispecies ArkChip, the three species of
Atlantic wolffish (Anarhichas) [28], caribou and reindeer
(New and Old World Rangifer, respectively) [34], and various cod species (Gadus) [15] all provide pairs that are
only a few percent divergent.

which the expected amplicon sizes were 4.0, 2.9, and 2.9
kbp, respectively. Regions that remained outside the longrange amplicons were amplified by standard PCR methods. To generate reference sequences for the resequencing
experiments, dideoxy sequencing was performed on an
ABI 377 fluorescent sequenced as previously described
[29], with the human- and/or gorilla-specific primers
(Table 7). The chimpanzee and gorilla sequences were
submitted to Genbank and assigned the accession numbers EU095335 and EU095336 respecively. The mtDNA
sequence of an Atlantic Cod (Gadus morhua) was obtained
by similar means [15,6].
Microarray resequencing
We used a commercial MitoChip microarray (Affymetrix)
to resequence a 15452 bp of the coding portion of the
human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome, excluding
the CR control region and including two rDNA, 22 tDNA,
and 13 protein-coding genes [16]. These features are tiled
both as the heavy and light strands (designated "sense"
and "antisense") strands, such that every base is assayed
twice. To fill up the balance of the available 30 Kb feature
array, the MitoChip includes duplicate tiling of this portion of the mtDNA genome, without the 12S and 16S
rDNA genes. For these 12805 positions, there are thus a
total of four replicates.

Methods
Sources of DNA
Primate DNA was obtained from the roots of ten hairs
plucked from a live chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) at the
Jardin Zoologique du Quebec, and from frozen heart tissue from a Western Lowland Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) in the
collection of the Royal Ontario Museum. DNA extractions
were done with the QIAGEN QIAamp DNA Mini Kit Tissue Protocol. DNA from an Atlantic Cod (Gadus morhua)
was purified by similar means.
Dideoxy sequencing
The mitochondrial genomes were enzymatically amplified by a combination of standard and long-range, highfidelity PCR methods, so as to isolate larger fragments
[29], which minimizes subsequent variation in pooling
amplicons for microarrays analysis. Primers designed for
human mitochondrial DNA [12,26] that showed a high
degree of homology with gorilla and chimpanzee reference sequences in GenBank were used for long-range
amplification. Long-range amplification of the chimpanzee genome was done with three pairs of primers: h01F
and h10R (for coding regions 12S to COX1), h09F and
h13R (COX1 to COX3), and h14F and h17R (COX3 to
ND4), for which the expected amplicon sizes were 6.7,
3.6, and 2.9 kb, respectively. Long-range amplification of
the gorilla mtDNA genome was done with three pairs of
primers: h01F and h06R (12S to ND2), h06F and h09R
(ND1 to COX1), and h14 to h17 (COX3 to ND4), for

Preparation for microarray resequencing includes pooling
of amplicons at equimolar concentration, nuclease fragmentation, labeling, and fluorescent staining, according
to the Affymetrix GeneChip CustomSeq resequencing
Array protocol, v. 2 (2003). PCR amplicons were first
pooled, such that each nucleotide was present in equimolar quantities. Calculations were based on known amplicon size and concentration as determined with an
Eppendorf BioPhotometer. Appropriate volumes of each
amplicon were added to a single pool (Table 8), which
was then brought to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge and
reconstituted in buffer. Pooled DNA was fragmented, to
produce DNA fragments of uniform small size (ca. 20
~200 bp). Fragmented DNA was labeled with a poly-A tail
via an rTdT transferase reaction. The labeled fragments
were applied to the GeneChip microarray and hybridization proceeded for 20 hrs. Each array was stained with a
fluorescent SAPE stain in a GeneChip Fluidics Station
according to protocol. The arrays were scanned with the
Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and analyzed with the
GeneChip DNA Analysis Software.
Numerical Analysis
Experimental results from chimpanzee, gorilla, and cod
were assembled with those from a human [26]. Output
from each array experiment consisted of eight sets of
probe intensity values, corresponding to the A, C, G, and
T oligonucleotide variants of the sense and antisense

intensity scores across all four bases. The difference
between the two highest intensities was divided by the
sum, which yielded a value defined as the differential signal-to-noise ratio (dS/N). This value expresses the confidence placed on each call. The approach is similar to those

Comparison of the probe intensity values and dS/N scores
for the partially duplicated region of the genome on the
microarray shows them in all cases to be virtually identical
to the main series [results not shown].
Distribution of SNP density between the ape dideoxy
sequences and the tiled human sequence was calculated as
a sliding window of 25 bp, starting at Position 13 of the
tiled sequence. The numbers of interspecific SNPs versus
intraspecific miscalls (positions where the microarray call
differed from the dideoxy sequence) within each of the
two primate sequences were compared in a sliding window of 25 bp extending 12b on either side of each position, starting at Position 13 of the tiled reference. The SNP
versus mismatch densities were averaged over all calls in
each of the eight classes of Table 2.
Phylogenetic Analysis
To compare intra- and interspecific differentiation among
the mtDNA genomes, we performed a phylogenetic analysis with the program PAUP (36). We aligned the 15,452b
of the three primate dideoxy sequences in this paper,
together with the homologous portions of five additional
sequences from GenBank listed in Figure 5. We performed
a branch-and-bound search, with all positions weighted
equally. The tree was rooted with Gorilla as the outgroup
to Pan and Homo.
