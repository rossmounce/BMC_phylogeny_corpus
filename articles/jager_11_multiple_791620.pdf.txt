Multiple Sox genes are expressed in stem cells
or in differentiating neuro-sensory cells in the
hydrozoan Clytia hemisphaerica

Abstract
Background: The Sox genes are important regulators of animal development belonging to the HMG domaincontaining class of transcription factors. Studies in bilaterian models have notably highlighted their pivotal role in
controlling progression along cell lineages, various Sox family members being involved at one side or the other of
the critical balance between self-renewing stem cells/proliferating progenitors, and cells undergoing differentiation.
Results: We have investigated the expression of 10 Sox genes in the cnidarian Clytia hemisphaerica. Our
phylogenetic analyses allocated most of these Clytia genes to previously-identified Sox groups: SoxB (CheSox2,
CheSox3, CheSox10, CheSox13, CheSox14), SoxC (CheSox12), SoxE (CheSox1, CheSox5) and SoxF (CheSox11), one gene
(CheSox15) remaining unclassified. In the planula larva and in the medusa, the SoxF orthologue was expressed
throughout the endoderm. The other genes were expressed either in stem cells/undifferentiated progenitors, or in
differentiating (-ed) cells with a neuro-sensory identity (nematocytes or neurons). In addition, most of them were
expressed in the female germline, with their maternal transcripts either localised to the animal region of the egg,
or homogeneously distributed.
Conclusions: Comparison with other cnidarians, ctenophores and bilaterians suggest ancient evolutionary
conservation of some aspects of gene expression/function at the Sox family level: (i) many Sox genes are expressed
in stem cells and/or undifferentiated progenitors; (ii) other genes, or the same under different contexts, are
associated with neuro-sensory cell differentiation; (iii) Sox genes are commonly expressed in the germline; (iv) SoxF
group genes are associated with endodermal derivatives. Strikingly, total lack of correlation between a given Sox
orthology group and expression/function in stem cells/progenitors vs. in differentiating cells implies that Sox genes
can easily switch from one side to the other of the balance between these fundamental cellular states in the
course of evolution.

Background
The Sox genes, a metazoan-specific family of HMGdomain containing transcription factors, are important
regulators of animal development. In mammals and in
classical non-vertebrate models (Drosophila melanogaster,
Caenorhabditis elegans), studies of Sox gene expression
and function have highlighted their crucial involvement in
a great diversity of developmental contexts, for example,
in neurogenesis, cardiogenesis, angiogenesis, chondrogenesis, and endoderm development [1-3]. Sox genes are
also involved in adult tissue homeostasis and in disease,

Bernard, 75005 Paris, France

notably cancer [2-4]. At the molecular level, Sox genes
activate, repress or modulate transcription of target genes
through physical interaction with a variety of partner proteins. The mechanisms whereby this transcriptional regulation is mediated are remarkably diverse [5,6].
There is significant diversity within the Sox multigenic
family, with, for example, 20 paralogues in the mammalian genome and 8 in the fly genome [7]. Previous gene
phylogenies have identified five major Sox groups
(named B, C, D, E and F) [8-12]. With the exception of
SoxD, all of them are represented in the genomes of
bilaterians as well as non-bilaterian eumetazoans (cnidarians and ctenophores) [8-10]. Several more artificial
“groups” (for example, group A, G, H, I, J) have been

created to accommodate single genes that are difficult to
position in the Sox tree. The presence of putative members of families B, C and F in sponges furthermore
suggests that Sox genes started to duplicate before the
last common ancestor of Metazoa [9,11,12].
A recurrent theme in functional studies of Sox functions at the cellular level in bilaterian models is the involvement of various members of the family in the critical
balance between self-renewing stem cells/proliferating
progenitors, and cells undergoing differentiation, and
their pivotal role in the regulation of this equilibrium in
numerous developmental contexts [2,3,13,14]. For example, the vertebrate Sox2 gene is widely known as a key
factor for maintenance of mammalian ES cell pluripotency [13-17]. Its forced expression (together with Oct4,
Klf4 and c-Myc) in differentiated fibroblasts leads to their
re-programming into ES-like pluripotent cells [18]. In
central nervous system development, the same Sox2 gene
acts in synergy with other SoxB group genes (Sox1 and
Sox3) to maintain neural stem cells and to repress neuronal differentiation, whereas yet other SoxB genes (Sox21
and Sox14) promote cell cycle exit and neuronal differentiation under the control of the proneural genes [14,17].
The same Sox protein can sometimes act on one side or
the other of the balance between proliferating and differentiating cells depending on the developmental context,
as is the case of the vertebrate Sox2 gene, involved in the
terminal differentiation of some neuronal subtypes
[13,14,17], in addition to its earlier function in neural
stem cell maintenance.
Data from non-vertebrate bilaterians such as insects,
Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode), sea limpet (mollusc),
Platynereis (annelid) and sea urchin (echinoderm) suggest
evolutionary conservation of at least some aspects of Sox
gene functions, notably in neurogenesis and in gametogenesis [19,20]. In the annelid Platynereis dumerilii, a SoxB
group gene was found to be expressed in the neurectoderm before the formation of committed neural precursors, while the expression of a SoxC group gene evoked a
role in neuronal differentiation [19]. These data are consistent with involvement of these two genes at different sides
of the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation along the neuronal cell lineage. However, for most
invertebrate Sox genes (including Drosophila genes),
expression and function have not been precisely characterised in terms of stages and progression along cell
lineages. Therefore, it remains unclear whether Sox family
genes have evolutionarily conserved roles in these processes, and if it is the case, whether each particular Sox
orthology group was ancestrally associated with one particular side of the balance, that is, either with stem cells/
progenitors, or with differentiating cells.
Studies in animal lineages that branch outside bilaterians are expected to be informative about the early

stages of animal evolution. Phylogenetic relationships
between the early-diverging animal phyla remain contentious [21-24], but a critical re-analysis of data sets
used in recent phylogenomic studies suggests that
apparent conflicts between them disappear when errors
are corrected and appropriate taxon sampling and models are used [25]. Currently the best-supported phylogenomic estimate of basal metazoan relationships implies
the monophyly of animals with nerve cells and muscle
cells (Eumetazoa: cnidarians, ctenophores and bilaterians) in line with classical views, and the grouping of
cnidarians and ctenophores in a coelenterate clade sister-group to the Bilateria [22]. Previously-published data
on Sox gene expression in two anthozoan cnidarians
(the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis [8], and the
coral Acropora millepora [26] and in a ctenophore [10]
have started to unveil conserved features of Sox gene
expression at the eumetazoan level. In particular, these
three studies all concluded that involvement of some
Sox genes in neuro-sensory cell specification and differentiation probably dates back to the common eumetazoan ancestor. In addition, two of the ctenophore Sox
genes were found expressed in the germ line as well as
in several somatic territories recently characterised as
reservoirs of somatic stem cells [27]. It was therefore
proposed that Sox roles in the balance between stem
cells/progenitors and differentiating cells might be conserved at the eumetazoan scale [10]. However, there is
currently no data from cnidarians to fuel this hypothesis, notably because stem cells and progenitors have
not been characterised in the larvae and adults of the
two anthozoans in which Sox gene expression has been
investigated [8,26].
To gain insight into evolutionary conservation and
divergence of Sox gene expression characteristics in relation to progression along cell lineages, we investigated
the expression of Sox genes in the hydrozoan cnidarian
Clytia hemisphaerica [28]. Hydrozoan cnidarians have
multipotent stem cells, called interstitial stem cells,
whose progeny comprises neuro-sensory cells (including
the stinging cells or nematocytes), gland cells, and germ
cells [29-34]. These interstitial cells appear in the endoderm after gastrulation [29]. The planula larva has endodermal patches of interstitial stem cells already
providing larval nematoblasts, nerve cells and gland cells
[29]. Upon metamorphosis, interstitial cells migrate to
the ectoderm, where they remain localised in the adults
[29,34]. The C. hemisphaerica life cycle comprises two
alternating adult forms: the asexual benthic colony of
polyps, and the sexual pelagic medusa [28]. In a previous work [35], it was shown that the medusa contains
localised populations of somatic stem cells, notably two
symmetrical patches of stem cells positioned in the
proximal region of each tentacle bulb. Tentacle bulbs

Jager et al. EvoDevo 2011, 2:12
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/2/1/12

are specialised basal swellings of the tentacles, in which
tentacle nematocytes are generated all life long. There is
a gradient of nematogenesis stages from the proximal to
the distal pole of the tentacle bulb axis [35]. Thanks to
these features, genes expressed during nematogenesis in
the medusa can be easily characterised either as stem
cell/progenitor genes or as early or late differentiation
genes, based on the spatial position of their expression
zone along the tentacle bulb axis.
Here, we present detailed expression analyses of 10 Sox
genes (five members of group B, one group C gene, 2
members of group E, one group F gene and one unclassified Sox gene) in the Clytia hemisphaerica planula larvae,
medusae and eggs. The results suggest conservation at a
deep evolutionary level of the general features of Sox
gene expression: the SoxF orthologue has endodermal
expression in Clytia like in other non-bilaterian animals
investigated so far, whereas for all other orthology
groups, the genes are expressed either in somatic stem
cells and in the germ line, or in differentiating/differentiated cells with a neuro-sensory identity (either nematocytes or nerve cells). However, comparison with gene
expression data from ctenophore and bilaterians reveals
total lack of correlation between any particular Sox group
and expression/function in stem cells/progenitors vs. in
differentiating cells, thus indicating that the roles of individual Sox genes can easily switch from one side to the
other of the balance, in different developmental and evolutionary contexts.

Results
Phylogenetic relationships of Clytia Sox genes

Until now, 15 members of the Sox family have been identified in Clytia hemisphaerica, of which 10 have complete
or almost complete HMG domain sequences and were
included in the phylogenetic analyses (Figure 1). Expression data are reported here for these 10 genes (CheSox1,
2, 3, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15). Among them, five are
new with respect to a previously published survey of
Clytia Sox genes [9].
Maximum-Likelihood (ML) and distance NeighbourJoining (NJ) analyses recovered the monophyly of the
metazoan-specific Sox family and of most previously
identified groups (Group B, Group C, Group E, Group F
and the bilaterian-specific group D) (Figure 1 and [10]).
However, some sequences cannot be classified into any
of these groups (grey boxes in Figure 1), including one
ctenophore sequence (PpiSox4), two sponge sequences
(EmuSox1 and AquSoxF) and several cnidarian Sox genes
from various species (Hydra magnipapillata, Nematostella vectensis and Clytia hemisphaerica). In particular,
genes highlighted in Box 1 (Figure 1) are problematic
because they fall in a basal and divergent position in the
Sox family. They comprise mostly cnidarian genes, but

Page 3 of 17

also the nematode CelSoxJ gene and the human
HsaSox30 gene.
The remaining Clytia Sox genes are allocated to
groups B, C, E, F in accordance with previous gene
assignments [9]. As in previous studies based on extensive gene repertoires [8-11], these groups are not supported by statistical indices (support was obtained only
in studies using partial gene samplings, for example,
[12,26]). Like in our previous works on Clytia and
Pleurobrachia Sox genes [9,10], genes are named in a
neutral way using numbers that are without any implication in terms of gene orthology within the Sox family.
According to the tree topology, CheSox1 and CheSox5
belong to group E, CheSox2, 3, 10, 13 and 14 to group
B, while CheSox11 branches within group F and CheSox12 within group C. Most Clytia genes have clear
orthologues from Hydra magnipapillata, supported by
ML BS values between 50% and 100%, except for the
two genes CheSox1 and CheSox11 (without identified
Hydra orthologues). Most Clytia genes also have recognisable anthozoan orthologues (Figure 1).
Within group B, all paralogues from bilaterian species
group in a clade also containing the ctenophore PpiSox3
gene, while the highly diversified cnidarian genes fall in
a basal paraphyletic assemblage. Within this assemblage,
we have labelled five distinct genes sets for clarity (I to
V on Figure 1). Three of these gene sets (II, IV and V)
contain genes from both anthozoans and hydrozoans,
thereby implying that the ancestral cnidarian genome
comprised at least three SoxB paralogues. The number
of ancestral cnidarian SoxB genes might even have been
higher, since we cannot exclude the possibility of undetectable orthologies among the remaining hydrozoan
(gene set III) and anthozoan (gene set I and NveSox1)
sequences. There is one instance of a clear hydrozoanspecific duplication, within gene set V, with Clytia and
Hydra having two paralogues whereas anthozoans have
a single orthologue. Cnidarian sequences of gene sets II
and V as well as sponge sequences of gene set IV share
a unique insertion within the HMG domain (see red
star at position 320 in Additional file 1). Among the
SoxB-specific motives previously identified outside the
HMG domain [26], only the “group B motif” located
just downstream of the HMG domain is conserved in all
members of the SoxB clade including the Clytia genes
(Additional file 1). Other conserved motives, particularly
the C-terminal motifs I and II shared by “subgroup B1”
genes [26] (indicated in blue in additional file 1) are
absent from Clytia SoxB genes.
The global phylogenetic arrangement of SoxB genes
implies that the bilaterian paralogues originated from
duplication events independent from those that produced the cnidarian paralogues. An important consequence is that no simple orthology relationship exists

study).

between individual cnidarian and bilaterian SoxB genes.
For example, the vertebrate stemness master gene Sox2
has no specific orthologue in cnidarians, or in other
terms, all cnidarian SoxB genes are equally orthologous
to the vertebrate Sox2 gene and to any other vertebrate
SoxB genes. The paraphyletic arrangement of cnidarian
SoxB genes might indicate their origin from ancient
duplications with subsequent losses of all but one paralogue in the bilaterian lineage, an interpretation also
supported by the presence of sponge orthologues in
gene set IV (Figure 1). The presence of the ctenophore
gene PpiSox3 (for which expression data were described
in [10]) nested within the clade of bilaterian SoxB paralogues is puzzling as it would imply that the diversification of bilaterian genes predated the ctenophore/
bilaterian ancestor, with most ctenophore orthologues
and all cnidarian ones having been lost. Alternatively,
this strange position of PpiSox3 could be due to phylogenetic reconstruction artefacts or to sequence
convergence.
Within group C, bilaterian and non-bilaterian genes
segregated in two sister clades. Except for vertebrates
and the ctenophore Pleurobrachia pileus, each species is
represented by a single gene. The phylogenetic position
of the two closely-related ctenophore genes (PpiSox2
and 12) is unstable. They are found either sister-group
to the other non-bilaterian SoxC genes (ML analysis;
Figure 1), sister-group to all other group C genes (NJ
analysis, not shown), or unclassified (not shown Bayesian analyses and [10]). Shinzato et al. [26] identified
two SoxC-specific motives in the C-terminal region of
the protein (in blue in additional file 2). The presence of
these signatures cannot be assessed for Clytia CheSox12
because the sequence is too short. However, both
motives are detectable in the other non-bilaterian
sequences (from Pleurobrachia, Acropora, Nematostella
and Hydra) falling into the SoxC clade in our phylogenetic analysis of the HMG domain (Figure 1; Additional
file 2). This provides support for orthology between bilaterian and non-bilaterian SoxC genes.
A clade of bilaterian group F genes was recovered in
all analyses but relationships of the non bilaterian SoxF
genes are unclear. In particular, the sponge genes EmuSox1 and AquSoxF cluster with the SoxF clade in the NJ
analysis (data not shown) but not in the ML (Figure 1)
and Bayesian analyses (data not shown). Cnidarian genes
do not form a monophyletic group within SoxF. No
SoxF gene was detected in the hydrozoan Hydra magnipapillata, suggesting Hydra-specific loss of the SoxF
group. A conserved SoxF motif (transcriptional activator
domain) in the C-terminal region of the protein is
clearly present in anthozoans [26], and is also detectable
but only weakly conserved in Clytia CheSox11 (Additional file 3), reminiscent of the situation seen in Ciona

Page 5 of 17

(note furthermore that this motif is not detectable in
Drosophila SoxF).
The topology within group E suggests that the common ancestor of eumetazoans had two paralogues, that
one of them was lost independently in bilaterians and in
ctenophores (according to the phylogeny of [22]), and
that the other one was lost in Hydra. Indeed, group E is
subdivided into two sister-clades, one containing only
cnidarian genes (CheSox5, HmaSox5 and NveSoxE2),
and the other one including two ctenophore paralogues, all bilaterian SoxE genes (HSASox8, 9 and 10,
DmeSoxE and CinSoxE), the Clytia gene CheSox1, two
anthozoan genes (NveSoxE1 and AmiSoxE1) but no
Hydra gene. Three conserved motifs were previously
identified as specific for group E, although in fact they
are shared only by a subgroup of SoxE sequences
("subgroup E1” in [26]). Of these, motif III is clearly
identified in CheSox1 (as well as in the anthozoan proteins Nve SoxE1 and AmiSoxE1), but not in the ctenophore SoxE sequences (Additional file 4). Motif II is
only weakly conserved at the metazoan level and its
occurrence in Clytia (and other non-bilaterian) SoxE
proteins is not obvious. Motif I is highly conserved in
anthozoan SoxE proteins, and more weakly in ctenophore PpiSox1 and in the hydrozoan proteins HmaSox5 and CheSox5.
Four Clytia Sox genes belonging to three distinct
subgroups are expressed in stem cells of the medusa
tentacle bulbs

The four Sox genes CheSox1 (Group E), CheSox3
(Group B), CheSox10 (Group B), and CheSox12 (Group
C) have highly similar expression patterns at the medusa
stage in the interstitial stem cells of the tentacle bulbs
(Figure 2A-L). These four Sox trancripts were detected in
the proximal region of the bulb, near the bell margin, a
region identified as a stem cell niche in previous work [31].
Their expression domains were restricted to two symmetrical patches at the tentacle bulb base (Figure 2A-D) and
mimicked the expression pattern previously described
for the stem cell marker Piwi [31]. Double in situ
hybridisations were performed using two different marker genes, to gain more detailed indications concerning
mRNA distribution along the axis of the tentacle bulb.
Co-expression with Piwi was found for CheSox1, CheSox3, CheSox10 and CheSox12 (purple colour in Figure
2E-H). The Minicollagen 3-4 (mcol3-4a) gene encodes a
component of the nematocyst capsule and is expressed in
differentiating nematoblasts, the dominant cell type in
tentacle bulb ectoderm (Figure 2I-L in red; [35]). Double
in situ hybridisations with mcol3-4a (Figure 2A-D)
indicate that the proximal domain where CheSox1, 3,
10 and 12 are expressed (in blue) is clearly distinct
from the more distal mcol3-4a expression domain (in red),

medusa tentacle bulbs for CheSox1 (A), CheSox3 (B), CheSox10 (C) and CheSox12 (D). These four genes are expressed in two symmetrical patches
at the proximal pole of the tentacle bulb. (E-H) Double in situ hybridisations of these four Sox genes (in blue) with the stem cell marker Piwi

hybridisations of the four Sox genes (in blue) with Minicollagene 3-4 (mcol3-4a) (in red), a marker of nematocyte differentiation. Most CheSox1,

same four Sox genes. No signal was detected for CheSox1 (M), CheSox3 (N) and CheSox12 (P) whereas CheSox10 (O) is strongly expressed in the
ectoderm of the four longitudinal ridges of the manubrium. (O’) detailed view of the area boxed in O. Black arrowheads point to stained cells,
showing a typical neuronal morphology. (Q-T) Expression in the female gonad of CheSox1 (Q), CheSox3 (R), CheSox10 (S) and CheSox12 (T).

Jager et al. EvoDevo 2011, 2:12

with co-expression limited in each case to very few cells
(like for Piwi and mcol3-4a in [35]).
Other expression sites for CheSox1, CheSox3, CheSox10
and CheSox12

In the medusa, CheSox10 transcripts were also abundant
in the distal third of the manubrium ectoderm, particularly along each of the four ridges (Figure 2O; higher
magnification in Figure 2O’). CheSox10 expression in
this area appears salt-and-pepper. The stained cells lack
a capsule and thereby they are not nematocytes, their
polygonal cell body bearing outgrowths evokes nerve
cells (Figure 2O’), and their distribution along the four
manubrium ridges closely matches a dense population
of nerve cells revealed by anti-FMRFamide antibody
staining (Additional file 5). Therefore, CheSox10 expression in the manubrium of the medusa is likely to be
associated with a neuronal cell type. No signal could be
detected for CheSox1, 3 and 12 in the manubrium
(Figure 2M, N, P). Finally, all four Sox genes were
strongly expressed in oocytes in the gonads of female
medusae (Figure 2Q-T).
Transcripts of these four Sox genes were also detected
in the cytoplasm of the unfertilised eggs, indicating that
these mRNA are maternally inherited (Figure 3A-D).
CheSox1 transcripts (Figure 3A) appeared localised to the
region around the nucleus at the animal pole, whereas
the three other maternal transcripts were detected uniformly through the egg cytoplasm (Figure 3B-D).
In the planula larva, three genes CheSox1 (Figure 3E),
CheSox3 (Figure 3F) and CheSox12 (Figure 3H) displayed similar expression patterns with transcripts
detected in cells scattered throughout the endoderm
(but not in the aboral-most region). Observation of
these stained cells at higher magnification (respectively
3I to 3J and 3L) failed to reveal any particular characteristic that would point to differentiated cell types of the
larva. These expression patterns closely resemble that of
ChePiwi (Additional file 6) suggesting that CheSox1,
CheSox3 and CheSox12 are expressed in larval interstitial stem cells. In contrast, CheSox10 larval expression
was detected at the base of the ectoderm, particularly
concentrated at the two poles of the larva (Figure 3G),
which strongly evokes the planula nerve net, known to
be basiepithelial and to extend throughout the ectoderm
with higher nerve cell concentration at both poles (see
immunostaining of the larval nerve net in Additional file
7). Additional arguments for a neuronal identity of the
CheSox10 expressing cells in the planula are (i) transmission electron microscopy data indicating that no cell
type other than nerve cells occur in the basal part of larval ectoderm (except scattered migrating nematoblasts)
[29]; (ii) small size (about 2 to 4 μm) of these CheSox10
positive cells (diameter of neuronal cell bodies about 3

Page 7 of 17

to 6 μm in immunostained preparations, Additional file 7);
(iii) presence of thin extensions (neurites) on the
CheSox10 expressing cells (visible at high magnification:
Figure 3K’).
Five Clytia Sox genes belonging to distinct subgroups are
implicated in nematogenesis in the medusa tentacle
bulbs

Five Clytia genes CheSox5 (group E), CheSox13 (group B),
CheSox15 (unclassified), CheSox14 (group B) and CheSox2
(group B) are expressed in the nematogenic ectoderm of
the medusa tentacle bulbs (Figure 4). Their expression
patterns are crescent-shaped and interrupted on the external side of the bulb (Figure 4A-E), as for all the nematogenesis genes described by [35]. The exact position of this
crescent along the bulb proximo-distal axis differed
among the five genes. CheSox5 (Figure 4A), CheSox13
(Figure 4B) and CheSox15 (Figure 4C) are expressed in a
wide median zone spanning most of the bulb axis except
the most proximal and distal regions, similar to CheMcol3-4a expression (see Figure 2I- L in red, and [35]).
CheSox14 (Figure 4D) and CheSox2 (Figure 4E) expression was detected in a more restricted and distal area.
Double in situ hybridisation with the minicollagen
CheMcol3-4a ripoprobe (Figure 4F-J) revealed its extensive co-expression with CheSox5 (Figure 4F), CheSox13
(Figure 4G) and CheSox15 (Figure 4H) but only partial
co-expression in the most distal part of the bulb with
the two other genes CheSox14 (Figure 4I) and CheSox2
(Figure 4J). According to the model presented in [35],
these data indicate that these five Sox genes are expressed
in differentiating nematoblasts, with CheSox5, CheSox13
and CheSox15 expressed during a large time window,
and CheSox14 and CheSox2 only expressed during the
latest phase of nematogenesis. Transcripts of CheSox5,
CheSox2, CheSox13 and CheSox14, but not CheSox 15,
were also detected in developing oocytes in the gonad
(Figure 4K-O).
Expression of CheSox5, CheSox13, CheSox15, CheSox14
and CheSox2 in eggs and planulae

In unfertilised eggs (Figure 5A-5E), an in situ hybridisation signal was detected throughout the cytoplasm for
CheSox5 (Figure 5A), CheSox14 (Figure 5D) and CheSox2 (Figure 5E), and was apparently homogeneous
except for CheSox2, whose transcripts appeared to be
distributed in an animal-vegetal gradient. In contrast,
CheSox13 transcripts (Figure 5B) were only detected at
the animal pole around the nucleus (similar to CheSox1;
Figure 3A), and no maternal transcripts were detected
for CheSox15 (Figure 5C).
At the planula stage, CheSox5 (Figure 5F), CheSox14
(Figure 5I) and CheSox2 (Figure 5J) exhibited similar
expression patterns. They were mainly expressed in

CheSox10 (G) is expressed in ectodermal basi-epithelial cells distributed throughout the oral-aboral axis but particularly concentrated at both
poles. All planulae have the same orientation, with oral pole (= posterior pole) on the top. (I-L) Higher magnification views corresponding to the
boxed areas in E to H. Stained cells in I, J and L have the typical aspect of interstitial cells. CheSox10 is expressed in small cells forming a dense

This boundary cannot be placed in K because the optical plane is more superficial (ectoderm throughout the picture). (K’) Higher magnification

half of the larva, with a few positive ectodermal cells
also detected. The stained cells are maturating nematoblasts, as indicated by the presence in their cytoplasm
of a rounded capsule, observed at high magnification
(Figure 5K, O, P, black arrows). The identification of

these unstained circles as capsules (and not nuclei) was
confirmed by their lack of fluorescence after DAPI staining of the cell nuclei (Additional file 8 A-A”, D-D”, E-E”).
Some of these stained cells are arranged in clusters
(Figure 5O) and others are isolated (see for example

present in the posterior (oral) part of the planula, in
basi-epithelial ectodermal cells. Observation at high
magnification revealed that transcripts are distributed
around a capsule, again suggesting expression of the
gene in differentiating nematoblasts (Figure 5L, and
5see absence of DAPI fluorescence in these capsules in
additional file 8 B-B”). CheSox15 was expressed at two
different sites within the planula (Figure 5H). In the
posterior half of the larva, CheSox15 was expressed in
ectodermal (basi-epithelial) and endodermal nematoblasts (Figure 5M, and 5see absence of DAPI fluorescence in these capsules in additional file 8 C-C”). At the
anterior pole, CheSox15 transcripts were detected in
ectodermal glandular cells containing dense granules in
their cytoplasm (Figure 5N).

CheSox11 (Group F) is a marker of endodermal cells

CheSox11 is the only Sox gene expressed in the endoderm of the medusa (Figure 6A). Expression of this
gene was observed in endodermal cells of the tentacle
bulbs (Figure 6B), in the endodermal circular canal (cc
in Figure 6A, B) as well as in radial canals, particularly
at the level of the gonads (but not in germ line cells)
(Figure 6D) and in endodermal cells of the manubrium
(Figure 6E). No expression was detected in unfertilised
eggs (Figure 6F). At the planula stage, expression was
scattered throughout the endoderm but with higher
intensity in the anterior half of the larva (Figure 6G).
We could not identify precisely in which cell type CheSox11 is expressed. An expression of this gene in interstitial cells cannot be excluded, although this seems

the oral half of the planula. CheSox15 (H) is expressed at two different sites: in ectodermal cells at the aboral pole, and in ectodermal and
endodermal cells of the oral half of the larva. (K, L, M, O, P) Higher magnification views of the areas boxed in black in F to J reveal the
presence of a round non-stained capsule within the cytoplasm of positive cells, for each of the five Sox genes (black arrows), indicating that
these cells correspond to maturating nematoblasts. (N) Higher magnification view of the area boxed in white in H. This area is rich in cells
whose cytoplasm is densely filled with granules, some of these cells being stained with the CheSox15 riboprobe (white arrow) while others are

unlikely given that Piwi (marker of interstitial cells) is
mainly expressed in the posterior half of the planula
(see Additional file 6), whereas CheSox11 expression is
maximal in the anterior half. Given the absence of any
particular characteristic (for example, capsule, neurites...)
of the CheSox11-positive cells, they most probably correspond to banal epithelial cells of the endoderm.
All expression patterns are summarised in Figure 7.

Discussion
The general characteristics of Clytia Sox gene expression
suggest evolutionary conservation at the gene family
level

Clytia Sox genes can be classified in three expression
groups (see Figure 7 summarising all expression data
from this study): (i) endodermal expression (only for the

group F gene CheSox11; see below); (ii) localised expression in stem cells / undifferentiated progenitors (of the
medusa and/or the planula larva: CheSox1, CheSox3,
CheSox10, CheSox12); (iii) expression in differentiating
or differentiated cells with neuro-sensory identity (putative larval and medusa neurons for CheSox10, nematoblasts for CheSox2, CheSox13, CheSox14, CheSox5 and
CheSox15). The neuro-sensory nature of cnidarian
nematocytes is supported by arguments from cytology
(presence of synapses, neurites, and of an apical
mechanosensory complex, reviewed in [36]), physiology
(electrical recording of action potential-like transmembrane currents, [37]) and developmental biology (expression in nematoblasts of conserved neurogenic genes,
reviewed in [36]). Our results indicate that along the
nematocyte cell lineage in the medusa tentacle bulbs,

multiple Sox genes act at one side or the other of the
stem cell/progenitor vs. differentiating cell equilibrium.
Interesting perspectives for future experimental studies
in Clytia include the identification of their molecular
partners, as well as functional assays to determine the
roles played by these various Sox genes in stem cell maintenance, progenitor proliferation, and cell differentiation.
These general features of Sox gene expression in Clytia are likely to reflect ancestral properties of the Sox
family at the level of the eumetazoan clade. This
includes the recurrent association of Sox genes with
stem cells and with neuro-sensory cell differentiation,
well documented in vertebrates [3,13]. In the ctenophore Pleurobrachia, two Sox genes (PpiSox2 and PpiSox12) are expressed at various body locations [10] in
cell populations that have been recently characterised as
pools of somatic stem cells expressing genes like Piwi
and Vasa [27]. It is important to underline that these

PpiSox2/PpiSox12-expressing stem cells give rise to a
variety of cell types, and not exclusively to neural or
sensory cells (for example, muscle cells for the stem
cells of the tentacle root median ridge). All the remaining Sox genes for which expression was characterised in
the adult ctenophore (except the SoxF orthologue) were
expressed in ectodermal differentiated cells with a clear
or probable neural or sensory identity (for example, PpiSox3 in ganglion-like structures of the polar fields called
the Z bodies; PpiSox6 in the ciliated “polster cells” of
the comb rows, which are known to have mechanosensory properties; see [10]). There is also good evidence in
the ctenophore that at least in some contexts, several
Sox genes are differentially expressed along the same
cell lineage in stem cells and in their differentiated progeny (PpiSox2/PpiSox12 vs. PpiSox3 in the polar fields;
PpiSox2/PpiSox12 vs. PpiSox6 in the comb rows). Sox
gene expression in other non-bilaterian models has been

less precisely characterised in terms of progression along
cell lineages, but several Sox genes in Nematostella and
Acropora have “salt-and-pepper” expression patterns
thought to correspond to neuro-sensory cells [8,26].
The germline probably represents an additional context in which Sox family genes have been involved since
the eumetazoan common ancestor. Eight of the Sox
genes investigated here in Clytia, belonging to groups B,
C and E, were found expressed in germline cells of the
female medusa gonad (no data on male medusae). In
the ctenophore Pleurobrachia pileus, PpiSox2 and PpiSox12 (but not the other Sox genes) are expressed in the
female germline [10]. In bilaterians, several Sox genes
have important function in the germline. For example,
in vertebrates Sox3 (group B) is crucial for oocyte development and spermatogenesis [38]. Other instances of
Sox genes expressed in the germline include Sox30
(unclassified) in human [39,40] and Dichaete (group B)
in Drosophila oogenesis [41]. In the honeybee (Apis mellifera), four of the eight Sox genes (AmSoxB1,
AmSox21b, AmSoxF, AmSoxD) are expressed in nurse
cells and/or in oocytes, whereas AmSoxE1 and AmSoxE2
expression is testis-specific (RT-PCR analyses; [42]).
The SoxF group seems to represent a special case
among the Sox subfamilies as its members do not have
the expression characteristics outlined above, but instead
are consistently and widely expressed in endoderm

derivatives, in all non-bilaterian animals where they
have been investigated so far. Thus, the Clytia SoxF
orthologue CheSox11 is expressed in the planula endoderm, and in most endodermal structures of the medusa
(tentacle bulb endoderm, canals of the gastrovascular system, manubrium endoderm). Likewise, SoxF genes have
an exclusively endodermal expression in the ctenophore
Pleurobrachia (throughout the gastro-vascular system;
[10]) and in the anthozoan cnidarians Nematostella [8]
and Acropora [26]. The case of Hydra is particular since
the SoxF group has apparently been lost in this lineage.
In vertebrates, important functions in endoderm development are documented for SoxF genes [43]. Therefore,
SoxF endodermal expression probably dates back to a
common ancestor of eumetazoans, although the cellular
functions of these genes are unclear. Additional functions
of the vertebrate SoxF genes (for example, in cardiogenesis and angiogenesis), and the involvement of Drosophila SoxF in peripheral nervous system and wing
development, but not in endoderm development [42] are
most easily interpreted as derived situations.
Comparison of Sox gene expression across Clytia life
stages

In Clytia, Sox genes tend to have consistent expression
properties across life stages, in terms of cell type or cell
lineage stage, but with some notable exceptions. Among

Jager et al. EvoDevo 2011, 2:12
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/2/1/12

the four Sox genes expressed in stem cells of the
medusa tentacle bulb, three were expressed in the planula larva in endodermal cell patches interpreted as
groups of interstitial stem cells. These three Sox genes
(CheSox3, CheSox12 and CheSox1) thereby seem to
behave as stem cell markers across life stages in Clytia
(although data are lacking for the polyp stage, whose
stem cells are located in the stolons of the colony). The
five genes (CheSox5, CheSox13, CheSox15, CheSox14
and CheSox2) expressed in medusa tentacle bulb nematoblasts were all expressed in larval nematoblasts as
well, and the CheSox10 gene, which seems to be
expressed in a subpopulation of medusa neurons, also
had expression associated with neural cells in the planula larva. However, expression of CheSox10 was
detected in stem cells of the medusa but not of the planula larva.
Recently, we found that a series of RNA regulatory
genes (Piwi, Vasa, PL10, Nanos) all expressed in stem
cells of the Clytia medusa and planula have maternallyinherited transcripts localised in a germ-plasm-like
structure closely associated with the oocyte nucleus
([44]; Leclère et al. submitted). These transcripts appear
to be inherited through cleavage stages by a subset of
blastomeres that migrate into the endodermal region
upon gastrulation. Subsequently, the expression of these
genes was detected in larval interstitial cells. This suggests that interstitial cells are specified by a mechanism
akin to “preformation” of the germline by inheritance of
maternal determinants as known for many bilaterians
[45-47].
Contrary to RNA regulatory proteins like Piwi and
Vasa and their mRNAs, the Sox are not known as germ
plasm components in bilaterians. It was therefore surprising to see that mRNAs of two Clytia Sox genes
(CheSox13 and CheSox1) were concentrated in a
restricted area of the egg cytoplasm around the nucleus,
closely resembling the mRNA distribution of Piwi, Vasa
and other typical “germ plasm genes” ([44]; Leclère et
al. submitted). However, for Sox genes there is no correlation between expression in stem cells of the medusa
and planula, and association of mRNAs with the putative germ plasm in the egg. The stem cell markers CheSox3 and CheSox12 are expressed maternally but their
mRNA are homogeneously distributed in the egg cytoplasm, and conversely CheSox13 has germ plasm-like
expression in the egg, but in the larva and in the
medusa it is expressed in nematoblasts, not in stem
cells. Only CheSox1 cumulates expression in the putative germ plasm of the egg and expression in stem cells
of the planula larva and of the medusa. A possible interpretation of these observations could be that only part
of the regulatory genes acting in interstitial cells has
their mRNAs present in the egg putative germ plasm,

Page 13 of 17

and/or that the later might have functions others than
the specification of interstitial stem cells during
development.
Strong variability of expression characteristics between
cnidarian Sox orthologues

While orthology relationships of Sox genes at the
metazoan level are generally poorly supported and
sometimes confused, relationships between genes from
different cnidarian species are much clearer. In addition,
expression data at a comparable life stage (planula larva)
are now available for three different cnidarian species.
Except for SoxF genes (discussed above), the expression domains in the planula larva of orthologous Sox
genes between different cnidarian taxa are strikingly different. For example, while the expression of CheSox10
(group B, gene set II, see Figure 1) is restricted to ectodermal nerve cells concentrated at both poles of the
Clytia planula, its orthologue in Nematostella (NveSoxB2) is expressed in both germ layers, ectoderm and
endoderm (Figure 3I in [8]), without any particular concentration of the transcripts towards the planula poles,
and the CheSox10 orthologue in the coral Acropora
(AmiSoxBa) has its transcripts restricted to the ectoderm at the aboral pole [26]. However, “salt-and-pepper”
expression observed for the Nematostella and Acropora
orthologues of CheSox10 suggests that these genes
might be expressed in neural cells like in C. hemisphaerica, and thereby different spatial distribution of the transcripts in the planulae of the different species might
simply reflect different architectures of the nervous system. Transcript distribution across the planula larva
similarly differs for the two other cnidarian SoxB group:
CheSox2 (group B “gene set IV”, Figure 1) is expressed
in the endoderm throughout the oral half of the
C. hemisphaerica planula, while the expression of its
orthologue NvSox2 (Figure 3HH in [8]) in N. vectensis is
restricted to the ectoderm at the oral pole, and the
same holds true for “gene set V” of the B group between
C. hemisphaerica (CheSox 13 and CheSox14) and N. vectensis (NveSox3, Figure 3OO in [8]; no data for these
genes in Acropora). All three C. hemisphaerica genes of
sets IV and V are expressed in the larval nematoblasts,
and the sea anemone patterns are perhaps comparable
at this cellular level, but the cell types where NveSox2
and NveSox3 are expressed were not described in [8].
In the case of SoxC genes, there is clear disparity of
expression characteristics at the cellular level, the
C. hemisphaerica CheSox12 gene being expressed in larval interstitial stem cells, whereas in both anthozoans its
orthologues (NveSoxC for N. vectensis and AmiSoxC for
A. millepora) have salt-and-pepper expression in the
planula ectoderm, and [26] provided convincing evidence that AmiSoxC is expressed in differentiated

Jager et al. EvoDevo 2011, 2:12
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/2/1/12

sensory neurons. SoxE orthologues have endodermal
expression in the planula larva of the three compared
cnidarian species, but while in C. hemisphaerica this
expression localises to interstitial stem cells, there is no
information about the SoxE-expressing cell type in
N. vectensis and A. millepora. In conclusion, there is
strong variability of orthologous Sox gene expression
between cnidarian species. Notably, in at least one case
(group C), the same gene is expressed in stem cell/progenitors in the hydrozoan C. hemisphaerica, but in
differentiated cells in the anthozoans N. vectensis and
A. millepora.
Inconsistent distribution of gene expression/function
characteristics across the Sox gene phylogeny

Published data on Sox gene expression and function in
various animal taxa are more or less easy to interpret in
terms of cellular state along cell lineages, depending on
the characteristics of each animal model and on the
main focus of each particular study. In Figure 1, we
used symbols to label genes associated with either undifferentiated state or cell differentiation. We decided to
highlight only genes from the three animal taxa for
which relevant data is available for a substantial diversity
of Sox genes: mammals (expression and function data
reviewed in [2,3]; see [48] for mammalian Sox18); the
ctenophore Pleurobrachia pileus (expression data from
[10]) and Clytia hemisphaerica (expression data from
this study). Data from other experimental models such
as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans
have not been mapped on the tree, because in most
cases it was unclear whether the genes were associated
with stem cells/undifferentiated progenitors, or with differentiated or differentiating cells.
Even when considering this limited species sampling, the
distribution of character states across the tree (Figure 1)
clearly indicates that gene expression/function characteristics with respect to cellular state are totally inconsistent
with the gene phylogeny. Non-bilaterian Sox genes known
to be expressed in stem cells or progenitors, and mammalian Sox genes known to maintain cells in undifferentiated
state, are scattered throughout the Sox family tree. The
same holds true for non-bilaterian Sox genes expressed in
differentiating or differentiated cells and mammalian Sox
genes promoting cell differentiation.
Not only each of the main Sox group (other than
SoxF) contains genes from both categories, but also
many individual genes belong to one category or the
other in the same species, depending on the developmental context. For example, the mammalian Sox1,
Sox2, Sox3 genes (members of the SoxB group) have
fundamental roles in the maintenance of neural progenitors in the neural plate, but they also act in the terminal
differentiation of several neuronal subtypes later on

Page 14 of 17

during development of the mammalian embryo ([2,3];
see [48] for mammalian Sox18). The C. hemisphaerica
CheSox10 gene is expressed in stem cells / undifferentiated progenitors of the medusa tentacle bulbs, but also
in differentiated neurons of the medusa manubrium and
of the planula larva. Similar ambivalent involvement at
both sides of the equilibrium in different contexts can
also be suspected for some of the ctenophore Sox genes,
for example PpiSox1 and PpiSox3, both expressed in differentiated neuro-sensory cells (respectively, of the apical
organ floor and of the polar fields) but also in particular
cell populations of the tentacle root (the aboral external
cell masses) thought to be stem cells [27].

Conclusions
A contrasted picture of the evolutionary conservation of
Sox gene expression and function emerges from comparative data on bilaterian and non-bilaterian animals.
At the global scale of the Sox family, genes tend to be
involved either in maintenance of undifferentiated state
in stem cells or progenitors, or in the differentiation of
various types of neuro-sensory cells. This does not apply
to the SoxF group, whose expression was probably associated with the endoderm in the common ancestor of
eumetazoans. A high degree of evolutionary plasticity
with respect to involvement in either stem cells/progenitors or differentiating(ed) cells is observed for the other
Sox groups when comparing gene expression data (i)
across Sox groups at the metazoan scale; (ii) between
orthologous genes at a comparable life stage (planula
larva) in different cnidarian species; (iii) for the same
gene in a given species under different embryological,
life stage or histological contexts.
This apparently paradoxical situation, with evolutionary
conservation of a stereotyped set of functions at the gene
family scale, but no conservation at the scale of the orthology groups, might reflect constraints acting at the levels of
the transcriptional regulation networks, and of the physical
interactions between Sox proteins and their partners.
Indeed, it is the pair formed by a Sox protein and its partner transcription factor that determines the set of target
genes for transcriptional regulation [6]. Under some circumstances, the Sox component of such a pair might happen to be exchanged with another Sox protein (possibly
from another Sox group) without affecting the set of target
genes (and thereby, the cellular state) controlled by the
pair. This model could explain at the same time evolutionary stability of a set of functions at the gene family level,
and frequent functional switches affecting individual Sox
genes during evolution. A switch in the role could also
come from changing from a repressor to an activator
activity whilst keeping the same targets. More data on the
expression, function and interactions of Sox genes and
their partners in a wide sampling of non-bilaterian and

Jager et al. EvoDevo 2011, 2:12
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/2/1/12

bilaterian metazoans are required for testing these
hypotheses.

Materials and methods
Survey for Clytia hemisphaerica Sox genes

In a previous work [9], nine partial Sox gene sequences
(CheSox1 to CheSox9) were identified by RT-PCR amplification in Clytia hemisphaerica and one additional
sequence (CheSox10) was detected in a preliminary
survey of about 10,000 Clytia hemisphaerica ESTs.
Recently, a larger data set of Clytia hemisphaerica ESTs
(about 90,000) and full-length cDNAs (about 8,000) was
sequenced at the Genoscope (Evry, France) (see [28]).
These transcriptome data were searched by TBLASTN
using the HMG domain of CheSox1. Some of the
sequences previously identified by PCR (CheSox2,
CheSox3, CheSox5) were retrieved in these searches. In
addition, we could recover five new Sox genes, named
CheSox11 to CheSox15. The CheSox1 sequence was
extended by 3’RACE-PCR as described in [10].
Alignment and phylogenetic analyses

The dataset was built using complete Sox gene repertoires
of selected bilaterian species (Homo sapiens, Ciona intestinalis, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) as well as sequences from non-bilaterian lineages.
Anthozoan cnidarians were represented by the full Sox
gene repertoire of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis
(14 Sox genes identified by [8]) and 6 published Sox genes
sequences from the coral Acropora millipora [26]. To the
Sox gene sequences available in GenBank for the hydrozoan Hydra magnipapillata (HmaSox10 XM-002154334,
HmaBb XM-002160022 and HmaB1 XM-002161342), we
added eleven additional Sox genes (named here HmaSox1
to HmaSox9 and HmaSox11-HmaSox12; note that the
name HmaSox10 was already attributed) recovered from
blast search (TBLASTN) against the hydra genome http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/BlastGen/BlastGen.
cgi?pid=12875[49]. Our alignment thus comprises a total
of 14 Sox genes for Hydra magnipapillata.
For Clytia hemisphaerica, only sequences containing a
complete or almost complete HMG domain were
included in the alignment (CheSox1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14 and 15) and shorter sequences were left apart. To
complete this gene sampling, we added ctenophore Sox
genes from Pleurobrachia pileus (PpiSox1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
and 12 [10]) as well as available Sox gene sequences
from demosponges: four sequences from Amphimedon
queenslandica [11,12] and three from Ephydatia muelleri (also elongated by 3’ RACE-PCR). A representative
sampling of non-Sox HMG domains was selected as an
outgroup [9,10].
The alignment was done automatically using MUSCLE
[50] and then slightly corrected manually in BioEdit

Page 15 of 17

[51]. The identification of conserved blocks outside
from the HMG domain (Additional files 1 to 4) was
based on Shinzato et al. [26]. For phylogenetic analyses,
only the HMG domain (79 aa) was taken into account
(see alignment used for the analyses in Additional file
9). There were no missing data, except for Clytia hemisphaerica CheSox1, Ephydatia muelleri EmuSox1-3 and
three Pleurobrachia pileus sequences (PpiSox2, 3 and
12), for which the 11 N-ter amino-acids are lacking and
were scored as missing data.
Phylogenetic analyses were carried out from the
amino-acid alignment by Maximum-Likelihood (ML)
using the PhyML program [52] with the JTT model of
amino-acid substitution and the same parameters as in
[9,10]. Distance Neighbour-Joining (NJ) analysis was
also performed on the same alignment with 1,000 bootstrap replicates using PAUP.4.b3 [53]. We also performed a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis with Mr Bayes
[54] under the JTT model, with 5,000,000 generations
sampled every 100 generations and four chains. Convergence was reached before 2,000,000 generations; a
majority rule consensus of 30,000 trees was produced
and posterior probabilities were calculated from this
consensus. ML and NJ bootstrap values higher than 50%
and Bayesian posterior probabilities are indicated on the
ML tree (Figure 1).
Animal collection and in situ hybridisation

Medusae, eggs and larvae of Clytia hemisphaerica were
obtained in the laboratory by culture of Clytia hemisphaerica colonies established from polyps provided by
Evelyn Houliston (Villefranche-sur-mer) as previously
described [55], except that artificial seawater (Reef Crystals ® ) was used. Medusae were left unfed during two
days before fixation.
All stages were fixed for one hour at 4°C in 3.7% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde, PBT 1X (10 mM
Na2HPO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH7.5, 0.1% Tween 20).
DIG-labelled antisense RNA probe synthesis and in situ
hybridisation were carried out as previously described
[55] with some modifications. The Proteinase K treatment was extended (30 mn instead of 10 mn) and the
hybridisation step lasted 48 to 72 hours instead of overnight. After postfixation and DAPI staining [56], samples were mounted in Citifluor ® . Double in situ
hybridisation was performed as described in [35]. DIC
images were obtained with an Olympus BX61 microscope using Q-imaging Camera with Image Pro plus®
software (Mediacybernetics).
Immunofluorescence

Medusae and planulae were incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (10 mM
Na2 HPO 4 , 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5). After fixation for

Jager et al. EvoDevo 2011, 2:12
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/2/1/12

30 minutes at 4°C, samples were washed several times in
PBS, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol and
stored in methanol at -20°C. Immunofluorescence
experiments were done as described previously [10].
Two primary antibodies were used to visualise the nerve
net: a rat monoclonal anti-tyrosylated a-tubulin or YL1/
2 antibody (1:1000 dilution, Serotec) for the planula
larva, and a rabbit polyclonal anti-FMRFamide (1:1000
dilution, Abcam) for the medusa. Samples were incubated overnight at 4°C with the appropriate secondary
antibodies: Alexa Fluor® 568 goat anti-rat IgG or Alexa
Fluor ® 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular probes).
Dilutions of primary and secondary antibodies were
made using 1X PBS containing 0.01% Triton-X100
(PBST). All samples were finally incubated with DAPI (1
μg/ml) for 15 mn for DNA staining, and then washed
three times for 15 mn in PBST.
