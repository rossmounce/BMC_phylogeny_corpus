Abstract
Background: One important mechanism by which large DNA viruses increase their genome size
is the addition of modules acquired from other viruses, host genomes or gene duplications.
Phylogenetic analysis of large DNA viruses, especially using methods based on alignment, is often
difficult due to the presence of horizontal gene transfer events. The recent composition vector
approach, not sensitive to such events, is applied here to reconstruct the phylogeny of 124 large
DNA viruses.
Results: The results are mostly consistent with the biologist's systematics with only a few outliers
and can also provide some information for those unclassified viruses and cladistic relationships of
several families.
Conclusion: With composition vector approach we obtained the phylogenetic tree of large DNA
viruses, which not only give results comparable to biologist's systematics but also provide a new
way for recovering the phylogeny of viruses.

Background
Viruses are small, infectious, obligate intracellular parasites that are capable of replicating themselves within
their host cells. They are even smaller than the smallest
elementary biosystem, yet still possess some properties of
living systems such as having a genome and the ability to
adapt to changing environments. However, viruses cannot
capture and store free energy and they are not functionally
active outside their host cell [1].
Traditionally, viruses were characterized by morphological features including capsid size, shape, structure, etc., as
well as physicochemical and antigenic properties. As more
and more viral genomes are being sequenced, the evolu-

tionary relationship of a great many families and genera is
being explored [2,3] by sequence analysis on single gene
or gene families, such as polymerase, capsid and movement genes [4-10]. The virus taxonomy system is
approved and updated by the International Committee
on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).
However, it is full of ambiguity for phylogenetic analysis
based on single gene when using conserved or similar
genes since horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between
viruses, along with gene duplication, gene capture from
host appears to have been frequent in large DNA viruses
[11-14]. Genetic mosaicism of phages has been known for
a long time. Homologous morons (coding region and

transcription control sequences) are found in many lineages of phages [15], and these kinds of genetic acquirements have also been considered the main sources of
increasing genome size in large DNA viruses [9,16]. The
high substitution rate of viruses also limits the sequencebased methods from revealing the distant evolutionary
relationships [11,17]. For example, the herpes simplex
virus type 1 mutates 10 times greater than mammalian
genes (nearly 3.5 × 108 substitutions per site per year)
[18,19]. Some attempts have been made to combine viral
structure and function characteristics and genomic information of their hosts into sequence information [11,17]
although quantifying such structural similarity has proved
to be extremely challenging.
In the meantime there are several other attempts to infer
viral phylogeny from their whole genomes [12,20-25] to
avoid the problem of gene rearrangement, gene loss, gene
duplication and lateral gene transfer. However, some of
them infer the majority consensus tree of the many trees
of individual genes or use the combined sequences of
many shared genes [12,21,22]. Some of them employ
gene content [12,22,23] and gene order [12,22] method,
but the former has to correct for the genome size effect
[26] and the latter can be hindered by a lack of synteny
conservation or the variation of the evolving rate of synteny between taxa [12,26]. Above methods are partly or
completely based on alignment of conserved or similar
sequences which is hard to infer more distant evolutionary relationships. Gao and Stuart [20,25] apply new alignment-free methods to resolve virus relationships
respectively, which appear to be sufficiently powerful to
explore the phylogeny of viruses at large evolutionary distance.
Since viruses have no universal common genes just like
SSU rRNA in cellular life, it is difficult to reconstruct the
phylogenetic tree for distinct type of virus with most of
former methods. We present here a phylogenetic analysis
of large DNA viruses with the Composition Vector (CV)
method [20,27,28] and discuss their relationships at a
deep level. The CV method does not require extended
alignments, predefined operational orthologs, or even
predefined homologs (for details see material and methods). We show that the results are mostly consistent with
the biologist's systematics with only a few outliers and
also provide some information for those unclassified
viruses and cladistic relationships of several families.

Results and discussion
A phylogenetic tree including 124 dsDNA viruses is
shown in Figure 1. Apparently, despite numerous horizontal gene transfer among large DNA viruses [13], our
analysis is able to divide the 124 dsDNA viruses into 10
families with only 4 outliers, CuniNPV, IIV-6, IcHV-1 and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/41

OsHV-1 (see Additional file 1: 124 large dsDNA virus
names, abbreviations, and NCBI accession numbers for
viruses names, abbreviations and accession numbers).
Phylogenetic relationships of all 124 dsDNA viruses coming from 33 genera, 10 families are well consistent with
the taxonomy by ICTV [1] and other phylogenetic studies
[9] with few exceptions.
Adenoviridae
Fig. 1 and Fig. 2a supports the division of this family into
four genera. It is notable that the two genera, Atadenovirus
and Siadenovirus, which both comprise viruses from a variety of hosts locate between another two genera, Mastadenovirus whose hosts are mammals and Aviadenovirus whose
hosts are birds. This variety of host origin supports the
hypothesis that interspecies transmission, i.e. host
switches of adenoviruses, may have occurred [29].
Baculoviridae
According to the classification in ICTV database, one of
the largest families in dsDNA viruses, Baculoviridae, is
composed of two genera, Granulovirus and Nucleopolyhedrovirus. However, the 4-subbranch of this family shown
in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2b complies with the classification of
their hosts. Dipteran-infecting baculovirus, CuniNPV,
locates the most deep [30] and stay outside the whole
large clade, followed by the Hymenoptera baculovirus
(NeleNPV and NeseNPV) and Lepidoptera baculovirus (the
rest of them) [12,31]. There are three hypotheses on the
origin of Baculoviruses: originated within Lepidoptera with
subsequent horizontal transmissions to other insect
orders [32]; originated with the cocladogenesis of the
viruses and their hosts [33]; originated from the ancestral
baculoviruses that were probably able to infect the hosts
of different orders, with ancient coevolution between the
hosts and pathogens then leading to the different order
host specialization [12]. Our analysis apparently provides
equal support to the last two hypotheses as postulated by
Herniou [30], without comparing the division time of
viruses and their hosts.
Poxviridae
The division of Poxviridae into two subfamilies Chordopoxvirinae (ChPV) and Entomopoxvirinae (EnPV) shown in Fig.
1 and Fig. 2d, is the same as in the systematics of ICTV.
Within the cluster Orthopoxviruses in ChPV, ECTV and
CPXV are the most divergent, which is similar to
McLysaght's study [34] and is also supported by another
analysis based on multiple genes alignment [3]. Capripoxvirus, Leporipoxvirus, Suipoxvirus and Yatapoxvirus form
another cluster, in which Capripoxvirus and Suipoxvirus are
much closer to each other, and this supports the hypothesis that they might have evolved from a common ancestor [3]. In Figure 1, DPV, an unclassified Poxvirus, is

assigned to ChPV subfamily, which agrees with Afonso's
result [35].
Herpesviridae
Within the Herpesviridae family, Fig. 1 and Fig. 2c also supports the observations of an early split of the Beta- and
Gammaherpesviruses from the Alphaherpesviruses [36]. It is
worth mentioning that TuHV-1, previously known only to
belong to the Beta-subfamily, now is found to cluster with
Cytomegaloviruses in Fig. 1, which follows Bahr's analysis
[37]. According to the taxonomy system of ICTV, the
Gamma-subfamily consists of two genera, Lymphocryptovirus and Rhadinovirus. MuHV-4, whose position was previously unresolved and various [36,38] is now assigned to
Rhadinoviruses according to ICTV, and is the most divergent in fig. 1. The rest two ungulate herpesviruses within
Rhadinoviruses, AIHV-1 and EHV-2, are divergent from
others which is in accordance with other analyses [36,38].
However, another ungulate herpesvirus, BoHV-4, clusters
closely to HHV-8 and CeHV-17, which is incompatible
with the hypothesis that herpesviruses have coevolved
with their hosts [39].

All Iridoviruses except IIV-6 fall into one cluster in fig. 1.
IIV-6 and ASFV from Asfarviridae group together, which
partly supports the theory that Iridoviridae and Asfarviridae
are monophyletic [40]. It is interesting to note that

ISaKNV, which was still an unclassified Iridovirus at the
time we fixed our data sets, has been placed in a new
genus Megalocytivirus, which supports both our analysis
and Do's [41]. The same is true of PsHV-1, which is
assigned to Alphaherpesvirinae in fig. 1 just as ICTV has
done not long ago, and it should belong to Iltovirus for it
clusters to GaHV-1. Similarly, WSSV, an unclassified
marine invertebrate virus [42], has also been classified
into a new virus family, Nimaviridae, which is again supported by our results.
Our results could also provide some clues to these
hypotheses about origins and evolution of viruses of several families.
Several unclassified viruses are analyzed for obtaining
some hints for their possible taxonomic statuses. As
shown in fig. 1, PsHV-1 may belong to Iltovirus, which was
supported by Thureen's result [43]; AtHV-3 to Rhadinovirus the same as McGeoch's analysis [44]; TuHV-1 to
Cytomegalovirus just as Bahr's result [37]. SAdV-3 and
SAdV-1 are close to HAdV-(A, B, C, D, E, F), and they may
be two new species of Mastadenovirus [45,46]. NeleNPV
and NeseNPV group together, and they may belong to a
new genus according to Herniou's results [30]. In fig. 1
DPV locates between Suipoxvirus and Yatapoxvirus but not
very closes to each of them, further supporting the idea

that Iridoviridae and Asfarviridae are monophyletic [40].

However, there are some outliers in fig. 1. IcHV-1 and

Conclusion
We present here a phylogenetic analysis of large DNA
viruses with the CV method and discuss their relationships at a deep level. The results support the biologist's
systematics in overall structure and in many details and
provide some clues to these hypotheses about origins and
evolution of viruses of several families.

It should be pointed out that although baculoviruses and
their hosts are obviously subject to coevolution [30], the
phylogenetic relationships of many families and the lower
taxonomic levels cannot be fully explained by only the
hypothesis of coevolution, e.g. the variety of host origin of
Atadenovirus and Siadenovirus and the location of BoHV-4.
Some traditional methods, e.g. the measures by concatenating aligned sequences, are efficient and powerful to
recover the phylogeny of virus with closely evolutionary
relationship. However, definition and selection of
orthologs may limit their application to distance evolutionary viruses. Furthermore, these methods, in some
cases, need adjustment or fine turning.
The CV method could circumvents the ambiguity of
choosing orthologs especially for viruses since substitution rate of viruses is high and only a few number of universal common genes could be found (another paper
about the stable analysis of the CV method will be submitted subsequently), it may suggest a new angle to Large
DNA viruses evolution. Furthermore, the CV method is
robust to HGT events. It has been observed that combining many genes could reduce sampling error and converge
phylogenies on correct solution with good support
[12,52]. Herniou obtained 32 different tree topologies by
using 63 individual genes and one tree based on the combined alignment of the 63 genes, while the latter was consistent with most individual gene trees [12]. The CV
method could use the information from all coding proteins so that it may still construct stable trees even dashing
with a few horizontal transferred genes. We used two sets
of data in our previous analysis on bacteria: one is based
on whole genomes, and the other is a set of ribosome proteins. Both the results lead to reasonable phylogenetic
trees but the first one is better, this shows that these
orthologs only appeared in a subset species would also
help to stabilize the tree topology. In this way, the method
could be a well supplement to the traditional methods.
The CV method may provide a quick reference in viruses
phylogeneny and a fast analysis of co-evolution of viruses
and their hosts whenever their proteomes are available
[26].

Methods
All viral genomes were downloaded from NCBI before
May. 24th, 2005. There are two available data sets of virus
complete genomes. Those in GenBank [53] are the original data submitted by their authors. Those at the National
Center for Biotechnological Information (NCBI) [54] are
reference genomes curated by NCBI staff. Since the latter
represents the approach of one and the same group using
the same set of tools, it may provide a more consistent
background for comparison. Therefore, we used all the
translated amino acid sequences (the .faa files with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/41

NC_accession numbers) from NCBI. There are 1489 viral
genomes, including 248 phages. Under the assumption
that small DNA viruses (genome size < 10 k) probably
have a different evolutionary history than large DNA
viruses [9,11], and their mutation rate approaches that of
RNA viruses (the order of substitutions per site per year,
[55]), only large DNA viruses (total length of all coding
proteins > 4 k) were used in the phylogenetic analysis,
which included 124 viruses (phages have been excluded).
Among the 124 dsDNA viruses there are seven viruses that
are classified to certain families but their lower taxonomy
states remain unknown, and two viruses are tentative species, and one virus that is only recognized as a dsDNA
virus. The Additional file 1 lists the dsDNA viruses used,
their abbreviations, and the NCBI accession numbers [see
Additional file 1: 124 large dsDNA virus names, abbreviations, and NCBI accession numbers].
The main steps of the method are (see [28] for details):
First, collect all amino acid sequences of a species. Second,
calculate the frequency of appearance of overlapping oligopeptides of length K. A random background needs to be
subtracted from these frequencies by using a Markov
model of order (K - 2) in order to diminish the influence
of random neutral mutations at the molecular level and to
highlight the shaping role of selective evolution. Some
strings that contribute mostly to apomorphic characters
become more significant after the subtraction. The subtraction procedure is an essential step in our method.
Third, putting these "normalized" frequencies in a fixed
order, a composition vector of dimension 20K is obtained
for each species. Fourth, the correlation C(A, B) between
two species A and B is determined by taking projection of
one normalized vector on another, i.e., taking the cosine
of the angle between them. Lastly, the normalized distance between the two species is defined to be D = (1 - C)/
2. Once a distance matrix has been calculated it is straightforward to construct phylogenetic trees by following the
standard neighbor-joining method in the Phylip package
[56].
The best choice of K is related to the uniqueness of
sequence reconstruction from its K-word components and
is determined basically by the length of the sequence at
hand. According to so-called "sequencing by hybridization" [57], for dsDNA viral genomes with length around
4,000 a.a., the minimal K is estimated to be 5.
Only large genome viruses are used in our analysis to
avoid the problem of small sample size when using CV
method whose subtraction procedure is based on statistics. The CV method avoids the problems caused by HGT
on the application of prokaryotic phylogeny by using
whole genome sequences, because the extent of lateral
transfer has been increasingly restricted to smaller and

smaller gene pools of closer and closer related species as
time goes by [58]. However, its application on classification of small DNA viruses may be affected by HGT
because of relative shorter genome length, that's one of
the reasons only large DNA viruses are used.
