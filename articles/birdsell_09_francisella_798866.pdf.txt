Abstract
Background: Francisella tularensis is the etiologic agent of tularemia and is classified as a select
agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Currently four known subspecies of F.
tularensis that differ in virulence and geographical distribution are recognized:tularensis (type A),
holarctica (type B), mediasiatica, and novicida. Because of the Select Agent status and differences in
virulence and geographical location, the molecular analysis of any clinical case of tularemia is of
particular interest. We analyzed an unusual Francisella clinical isolate from a human infection in
Arizona using multiple DNA-based approaches.
Findings: We report that the isolate is F. tularensis subsp. novicida, a subspecies that is rarely
isolated.
Conclusion: The rarity of this novicida subspecies in clinical settings makes each case study
important for our understanding of its role in disease and its genetic relationship with other F.
tularensis subspecies.

Background
Tularemia is an incapacitating disease that presents in two
main forms: pneumonic or ulceroglandular. The causative
agent is the bacterium Francisella tularensis. Without antibiotic treatment, death occurs in 30%-60% of victims
with the pneumonic form [1]. Because of this high mortality and its low infectious dose, F. tularensis was historically targeted for biological weapons development by the

governments of the United States, Japan, and the former
Soviet Union [1]. As a result, it is currently classified as a
Category A Select Agent by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC). Small animals (e.g., lagomorphs
and rodents) may serve as hosts for F. tularensis and
arthropods can serve as biological vectors for transmission. Although humans commonly acquire the infection
through insect bites or handling of infected tissue, direct

contact with environments where F. tularensis persists can
comprise another source of infection [2].
Although a new species, F. piscicida, was recently identified [3], the three most commonly studied species within
the Francisella genus are F. tularensis, F. novicida, and F. philomiragia [2]. F. tularensis is officially divided into three
subspecies: tularensis (type A), which is further divided
into subpopulations A.I and A.II [4,5]; holarctica (type B),
and mediasiatica [2]. According to Staples et al. [6], these
subspecies and subpopulations differ in pathogenicity,
with F. tularensis subsp. tularensis subpopulation A.I more
virulent than F. tularensis subsp. holarctica, which is more
virulent than F. tularensis subsp. tularensis subpopulation
A.II. F. tularensis subsp. mediasiatica has been reported to
have virulence similar to F. tularensis subsp. holarctica [2],
but was not included in the aforementioned study [6].
The rarely isolated F. novicida appears less virulent than F.
tularensis [2], but has been shown to cause disease [7-10].
F. novicida is also genetically similar to F. tularensis, causing many to classify it as a fourth subspecies of F. tularensis
[2,5,11,12], which this study also will do. F. philomiragia
also causes human disease, usually in victims of neardrowning or immunocompromised individuals [8,13].
In addition to these recognized species and subspecies,
PCR-based analyses of environmental samples have
detected Francisella-like organisms in air, water, and soil
[14,15]. These findings indicate the existence of a diverse
group of organisms that are not well accounted for in the
current taxonomy [2]. These Francisella-like organisms
may or may not cause disease [14], though a recent report
of two Francisella-like organisms from human infections
with 16S rDNA sequences similar to those of the environmental Francisella-like organisms suggests the potential
for human infection [16]. The deeper phylogenetic structure of the Francisella genus remains poorly understood
but will improve as more detailed phylogenetic information is obtained from additional genomic sequences [2].
Because of pathogenicity differences, as well as the Select
Agent status of F. tularensis (including F. tularensis subsp.
novicida), correctly identifying clinical isolates as F. tularensis and assigning them to particular subspecies and/or
molecular groups within F. tularensis is desirable. Biochemical-based subtyping methods are not ideal because
of their labor intensiveness and because the results often
are non-definitive. DNA-based assays provide the most
robust means of accomplishing this task [2]. Molecular
assays capable of assigning unknown isolates to F. tularensis subsp. tularensis or holarctica have been developed [1719], but less attention has been paid to F. tularensis subsp.
novicida.
The aim of this study was to determine the species and
subspecies of a Francisella clinical isolate obtained from a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/2/223

human infection in Arizona. This aim was accomplished
using multiple DNA-based approaches. We report that the
clinical isolate has the molecular signature of F. tularensis
subsp. novicida. Human disease events caused by F. tularensis subsp. novicida are rare, making this isolate of particular interest.

Results and Discussion
Clinical presentation
In August of 2006, a 15-year-old male who had presented
with swelling on alternating sides of the face and neck
over the preceding two to three weeks reported to a hospital in Maricopa County, Arizona. The patient, who had
prior treatment with penicillin with no relief of symptoms, had no fever and normal white blood counts. The
patient was negative on screening tests for EBV, bartonellosis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and coccidioidomycosis; blood culture also was negative. The patient was
admitted for continued monitoring and an infectious disease consult, and he was treated with ampicillin and clindamycin. Biopsies in the area of the right parotid gland
revealed a reactive lymph node. A biopsy sample was
obtained for examination by microscopy, culture, and
molecular typing. Based on the results of culture (next section), antibiotic treatment for the patient was switched to
doxycycline even as the patient was on his way to recovery. No risk factors for tularemia acquisition were identified during interviews of the patient and his mother.

Hospital records were examined for this patient and it was
determined that he had presented three times to a local
emergency room in February 2006. On first visit, the
patient reported intermittent malaise for 3-4 days, myalgia, diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and one
episode of diarrhea. Elevated WBC was noted and pleural
effusion and prominent mesenteric lymph nodes were
observed on CT scan. The patient was diagnosed with
pneumonia and was sent home with a prescription for
zithromax. Four days later, the patient returned to the
emergency room with complaints of shortness of breath
and left shoulder and chest pain, although his previous
symptoms had resolved. Pleural effusion was noted on
chest radiographs. The patient was treated with rocephin,
sent home with a prescription for augmentin, and told to
continue with zithromax. Two weeks later the patient visited a local ER again with chief complaint of hand and
foot pain and was advised to take ibuprofen.
The patient and his mother were interviewed with regards
to previous medical history, travel, and other risk factors
for tularemia, but none were revealed. The patient
reported no travel history outside of county of residence
(Maricopa) for several years, no contact with any animals
or unchlorinated water, no hunting, and no insect bites.
The family, which lives in an urban setting, owns three
dogs but reported no tick problems. A sibling previously

owned a ferret which was given away and later died. However, the patient had no contact with the ferret, and no
handlers of the ferret reported illness. The family reported
that rats had been observed outside on the family's property. The patient reported that he mows the lawn for a
neighbor, but denied running over any animal carcasses
and reported that he otherwise prefers to stay indoors.
Initial identification
On culture, a light growth of Gram-negative rods was
reported by a commercial lab, and was determined by biochemical tests to resemble Kingella species. Initial PCR
analysis assigned the clinical isolate to F. tularensis. This
finding was further confirmed by direct fluorescent antibody staining. The CDC in Fort Collins, CO, USA subsequently tested the isolate and reported that it was a "F.
tularensis non-A, non-B subspecies."

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/2/223

hospitalization for abdominal pain and pneumonia six
months earlier was related to the subsequent diagnosis of
tularemia made from the lymph node biopsy. However,
because this subspecies is known to exhibit low virulence,
these findings suggest that this case may have been a lingering, chronic infection. Despite the fact that this subspecies is infrequently associated with disease in immunocompetent hosts, several cases have been documented [710] and F. tularensis subsp. novicida is considered a human
pathogen and a Select Agent. Because infections by F. tularensis subsp. novicida may often lack clinical significance,
the frequency of human infections may be underreported
[7,10,22]. The rarity of this novicida subspecies in clinical
settings makes each case study important by advancing
our understanding of its role in disease and its genetic
relationship with other F. tularensis subspecies.

Methods
Molecular analyses
Due to a lack of risk factors and the Select Agent status of
F. tularensis, identifying the subspecies of this isolate was
desirable. Because the isolate was neither of the two major
F. tularensis subspecies, tularensis or holarctica, subspecies
identification became of additional scientific interest.
One possibility was that the isolate was not actually F.
tularensis, but rather a closely-related but undefined Francisella species. To test this possibility, we subtyped the
clinical isolate using multiple DNA-based approaches that
provided increasing levels of resolution. Previous studies
have indicated that analysis of the 16S rDNA gene
sequence is useful for examining the relationship of Francisella to other closely-related genera [2,20]; this gene fragment also can be amplified from unculturable nearneighbor species [2]. Our analysis of the 16S rDNA gene
confirmed that the clinical isolate was a member of the F.
tularensis group (Fig 1). Multi-locus Sequence Typing
(MLST), which is effective at assigning unknown isolates
of F. tularensis to one of the four subspecies [12], indicated
that the clinical isolate clustered within the subspecies
novicida clade; this clade was supported by high bootstrap
values in the phylogenetic analysis (Fig 2). Within the
novicida clade, the clinical isolate possessed a unique
MLST genotype (Fig 2). Barns et al. [14] previously
reported that primer sets targeting a putative succinate
dehydrogenase locus were useful for discriminating among
the subspecies of F. tularensis. Sequencing analysis of the
amplicon generated with their primer sets indicated the
clinical isolate was identical to that of several F. tularensis
subspecies novicida isolates (data not shown). Finally, variable-number tandem repeat analysis utilizing 11 loci [21]
grouped the clinical isolate with other F. tularensis subspecies novicida isolates (data not shown).

Conclusion
We conclude that the clinical isolate from this human case
belongs to F. tularensis subsp. novicida. It is unclear if the

16S rDNA and MLST Gene Sequencing
Initial amplification of the 16S rDNA gene was performed
using the forward primer 27F.1G (5'-GAGRGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3') and two reverse primers, 787Rb (5'GGACTACNRGGGTATCTAAT-3') and 1391-R (5'-GACGGGCGGTGTGTRCA-3'). Amplification was carried out in
10 Î¼l reactions containing 1Ã PCR buffer (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA), 2 mM MgCl2 (Invitrogen), 0.2 mM each
deoxynucleoside triphosphate (Invitrogen), 0.8 U Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), and 1 Î¼l DNA template. Thermal cycling conditions were 94Â°C for 5 min, 35
cycles of 94Â°C for 30 s, 55Â°C for 30 s and 72Â°C for 1.5
min, and a final extension of 72Â°C for 5 min. Multi-locus
sequence typing (MLST) genes were amplified as
described previously [12]. Sequencing of these 16S rDNA
and MLST gene amplicons was carried out on an ABI 3100
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using BigDye terminator cycle sequencing reagents (v. 3.1 Applied Biosystems).
