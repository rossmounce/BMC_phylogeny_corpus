Abstract
Background: The sweet, floral flavor typical of Muscat varieties (Muscats), due to high levels of monoterpenoids
(geraniol, linalool and nerol), is highly distinct and has been greatly appreciated both in table grapes and in wine
since ancient times. Muscat flavor determination in grape (Vitis vinifera L.) has up to now been studied by
evaluating monoterpenoid levels through QTL analysis. These studies have revealed co-localization of 1-deoxy-Dxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (VvDXS) with the major QTL positioned on chromosome 5.
Results: We resequenced VvDXS in an ad hoc association population of 148 grape varieties, which included
muscat-flavored, aromatic and neutral accessions as well as muscat-like aromatic mutants and non-aromatic
offsprings of Muscats. Gene nucleotide diversity and intragenic linkage disequilibrium (LD) were evaluated.
Structured association analysis revealed three SNPs in moderate LD to be significantly associated with muscatflavored varieties. We identified a putative causal SNP responsible for a predicted non-neutral substitution and we
discuss its possible implications for flavor metabolism. Network analysis revealed a major star-shaped cluster of
reconstructed haplotypes unique to muscat-flavored varieties. Moreover, muscat-like aromatic mutants displayed
unique non-synonymous mutations near the mutated site of Muscat genotypes.
Conclusions: This study is a crucial step forward in understanding the genetic regulation of muscat flavor in
grapevine and it also sheds light on the domestication history of Muscats. VvDXS appears to be a possible humanselected locus in grapevine domestication and post-domestication. The putative causal SNP identified in Muscat
varieties as well as the unique mutations identifying the muscat-like aromatic mutants under study may be
immediately applied in marker-assisted breeding programs aimed at enhancing fragrance and aroma complexity
respectively in table grape and wine cultivars.

Background
Fragrance in table grapes and a persistent and complex
aroma in wine are both sought after by the modern consumer. In particular, the floral flavor typical of Muscat
varieties (also known as Muscats) is highly distinct and
has been greatly appreciated since ancient times. Muscat
vines are thought to be one of the oldest domesticated
grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.) and they are now widely
distributed all over the world [1]. It has been assumed
that Muscats originated in Greece, the putative main
progenitors of this large grape family being Moscato

Bianco and Muscat of Alexandria [2]. Several studies
have shown that the unique scent of muscat-flavored
grape varieties is linked to the presence of monoterpenoids with a low olfactory perception threshold in the
grape berry. In particular, linalool, geraniol, nerol, citronellol and a-terpineol have been described as the major
aromatic determinants because of their high concentrations in Muscat cultivars [3,4]. Mateo and Jiménez [5]
proposed a general classification of grape varieties based
on monoterpene concentrations: a first group of intensely muscat-flavored varieties with a free monoterpene
concentration as high as 6 mg/l (i.e. Muscat of Alexandria, Moscato Bianco, Gewürztraminer etc.); a second
group of non-muscat but aromatic varieties with a total
monoterpene concentration of 1-4 mg/l (i.e. Morio
Muskat, Rhine Riesling, Sylvaner etc.) and a third group

of more neutral varieties which do not depend upon
monoterpenes for their flavor (i.e. Chardonnay, Chasselas, Cabernet-Sauvignon etc.). Monoterpenoids belong
to the family of terpenoids, one of the most abundant
and structurally diverse groups of natural metabolites
essential for several biological functions of both primary
and secondary metabolism [6]. Two distinct and partially independent routes, the cytoplasmatic mevalonic
acid (MVA) pathway and the plastidial 2-methyl-Derythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, have been identified in plants as producing isopentenyl diphosphate
(IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate
(DMAPP), the precursors of all terpenoids [7]. However,
it is assumed that the MEP pathway is the dominant
route for the biosynthesis of substrates of monoterpenes
in the grape berry [8]. IPP and DMAPP are then condensed by the action of the prenyltransferase geranyldiphosphate synthase to yield geranyl diphosphate (GPP).
Different monoterpene synthases subsequently catalyze
the conversion of GPP to different cyclic and acyclic
monoterpenoids. The primary monoterpene skeleton
can be further modified by the action of various
enzymes (i.e. cytochrome P450 hydroxylases, dehydrogenases and glycosyl and methyltransferases) [9,10].
The genetic bases of muscat flavor in grapevine have
up to now been evaluated through QTL studies in distinct F1 biparental mapping populations [11,12] and in
selfing populations [13]. Two major QTLs were confirmed in all the experiments, thus strengthening the
hypothesis that muscat flavor determination is controlled
by a reduced number of loci having a strong effect [14].
Doligez et al. [11] described the co-localization on linkage group (LG) 5 of the QTL for muscat flavor based on
tasting data with a major QTL for monoterpenic odorant
content. Battilana et al. [12] subsequently reported a
positional candidate gene (CG), 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5phosphate synthase class 1 (DXS), within the major QTL
for the content of volatile and non-volatile forms of geraniol, nerol and linalool on LG 5.
DXS catalyzes the first reaction of the MEP pathway,
the production of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate
(DXP) from the central metabolic intermediates glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and pyruvate. Many investigations
support a regulatory role for DXS in terpene biosynthesis in bacteria and in several plant species [15]. DXS
regulation has been observed in plants both at the transcriptional level [16-18] and at the post-transcriptional
level [19-21]. Accordingly, DXS was described as also
being one of the main regulators of monoterpenoid biosynthesis in grapevine by Luan and Wüst [8]. The crucial role of DXS in regulating the MEP pathway is
confirmed by altered phenotypes in Arabidopsis mutants
cla1-1, chs5, and lvr111 due to a drastic decrease in
chlorophyll content [22-24]. A small DXS gene family

has been suggested for several plant species, i.e. Arabidopsis thaliana [15,25], Ginko biloba [26], great morinda
[27], Medicago truncatula [28], oil palm [29], Picea
abies [17], and Pinus densiflora [30]. Two or three
potential DXS-like genes (DXL) have been reported in
all these plants and phylogenetic analysis shows that
these genes cluster into independent clades [30,31]. DXL
genes display particular expression patterns suggesting a
housekeeping function for DXS and tissue-specific roles
in secondary isoprenoid biosynthesis for DXL1 and
DXL2 [26,28,29,31,32]. One DXS (DXS1) located on
chromosome 5, three DXL1 (DXS2A, DXS2B and
DXS2C) located respectively on chromosomes 15, 11
and 7, and one DXL2 (DXS3) on chromosome 4 have
been predicted in the grape genome [12].
In recent years, structured association (SA) mapping
has emerged as a major tool in the search for the genes
underlying quantitative trait variation in model plants
[33,34] and other perennial plants [35]. Although genome-wide association (GWA) studies have recently
gained preeminence [36,37], candidate gene association
(CG) studies remain the key approach to gene mapping
in less complex traits [38,39]. The extensive information
obtained with the sequencing of the grape genome
[40,41], and the definition of core collections retaining a
high percentage of the genetic variability of natural collections [42] make GWA and CG association studies
feasible in grapevine as well. The degree of LD, which is
highly population-specific [43,44] and locus-specific
[45], will determine the resolution of an association
study, thus influencing the choice between CG or GWA
strategies. Cultivated grapevine (V. vinifera subsp. sativa)
has extensive genetic variation with a high level of longrange LD [46] making a GWA strategy feasible. On the
other hand, intragenic LD decays rapidly in grapevine
[47,48], favoring CG association approaches, as in the
case of Myb-like genes tested for association with anthocyanin variation and berry color [49,50].
In the present study, we assessed the association of
nucleotide variation in the candidate gene VvDXS with
muscat flavor in grapevines with different genetic backgrounds. In order to avoid spurious associations, an SA
analysis was carried out by testing individual polymorphic sites in one ad hoc association population
incorporating the genetic structure of the sample as a
covariate.
The objectives of the present study were to: (1) examine nucleotide diversity and LD within the VvDXS gene,
(2) test for associations between individual polymorphisms and muscat flavor in order to identify putative causal SNPs, and (3) estimate the putative selection on this
gene by calculating diversity index as Tajima’s D and Fu
and Li’s D* and by performing a network analysis of
reconstructed haplotypes. Possible implications for

metabolic functions of the putative causal SNPs detected
in muscat-flavored varieties and in muscat-like aromatic
mutants are put forward and discussed. Moreover, the
presence of a population structure in the dataset under
study and the results of the network analysis are discussed with regard to the history of the domestication
of cultivated grapevine and the transmission of muscat
flavor.

In order to determine if the candidate gene VvDXS was
expressed in the grape berry of Moscato Bianco, we
amplified the full-ORF VvDXS cDNA from the cDNA
retrotranscribed from total RNA of berry skin. The fullORF VvDXS cDNA was then cloned and sequenced for
an overall length of 2151 bp. Two VvDXS alleles could
be distinguished and were defined as A and B based on
a point mutation G/T (SNP 1822). VvDXS protein
sequences of 716 amino acids for both Moscato Bianco
alleles were predicted from the sequenced cDNA and
were aligned (Figure 1).

is summarized in Table 1. VvDXS gene was split into 10

NC_012011). There were too many missing data for this
SNP, thus H11Y was not considered for the statistical
analysis and it was not included in the total number of

position on VvDXS ORF of V. vinifera PN40024. As
VvDXS is predicted on the minus strand of locus
NC_012011, nucleotide positions relative to NC_012011
are also reported (Additional file 1). SNP variation
among the 148 grapevine accessions corresponded to an
average of one SNP every 51 bp. As would be expected,
the frequency of sequence variants was higher in noncoding regions (one every 38 bp) than in coding regions
(one every 86 bp). A 1.5:1 ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous changes was observed in coding regions.
INDEL frequency corresponded to one every 670 bp
and INDELs were found only in introns as mononucleotide (5), dinucleotide (1) and 36 bp (1) variants.

VvDXS intragenic LD estimation and haplotype
structure detection

Intragenic LD was estimated by calculating the square of
the correlation coefficient of allele frequencies (r2) and
the absolute value of D’ for all pairs of polymorphic
sites (Figure 2). R2 and the absolute value of D’ are both
accepted measures for analysis of the distance dependence of LD. The mean r2 for all 5022 pairwise comparisons was 0.0717 and the median was 0.0067, thus no
intragenic LD measuring r2 was observed, although several sites were still closely linked (r 2 > 0.6) over long
distances (> 4500 bp). Instead, a significant gene-wide
LD was found by evaluating absolute D’ (mean absolute
D’ = 0.75 and median absolute D’ = 1). The LD plot of
r 2 values for all pairs of polymorphic sites and the
detected haplotype blocks in function of the VvDXS
gene structure and of the conserved domain organization of the predicted amino acid sequence are shown in
Figure 3. Ten haplotype blocks were deduced, blocks 1,
2, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9 being located within intronic regions
and block ten identified within a coding region. Haplotype blocks five and six are mainly located in introns
but they also include exonic SNPs (SNP 1594 and SNP
2176 respectively).

Nucleotide diversity

Nucleotide diversity (π = 0.0032, θ = 0.0034) was not
equally distributed among site categories. The estimated
π value was on average four times higher for synonymous sites and silent sites (synonymous sites and noncoding region) than for non-synonymous sites (Table 2).
In addition, nucleotide variation and diversity were separately estimated (Table 3) by grouping the accessions
into different phenotypic classes (muscat, neutral, aromatic, neutral Muscats and muscat-like aromatic
mutants). The muscat class had a lower frequency of
polymorphic sites (one every 62 bp) than the neutral
class (one every 49 bp) and the dataset as a whole, but
it was higher than the aromatic group (one every 76).
The muscat-flavored accessions also have reduced
nucleotide diversity (π = 0.0026, θ = 0.0029) compared
with the neutral and aromatic classes and with the dataset as a whole.

Association testing

To avoid false positive results due to population stratification of the subset, we tested for associations with the
structured association procedures.
With our sample, the best population subdivision
revealed by STRUCTURE was obtained for K = 2 subpopulations and the corresponding Q matrix was first
tested as an independent variable. Population structure
effect was significant (4.60E-17), so the Q matrix was
then included as covariate for association analysis. All
102 polymorphic sites revealed in the study were tested.
Using the logistic regression model, 3 out of the 102
tests yielded a significant result after Bonferroni correction (Holm-Bonferroni threshold value of P = 0.05 set
to 4.90E-04) with P-values ranging from 1.79E-05 to
1.31E-10 (Table 5). A G/T SNP at gene position 1822

In silico analysis of VvDXS protein and prediction of
tolerability of amino acid exchanges

The prediction of tolerability of amino acid exchanges
was evaluated for all ten non-synonymous mutation
detected, and four were predicted to alter protein function (SIFT score < 0.05) by affecting either amino acid
R-chain charge or amino acid polarity (Table 4). Among
non-neutral mutations, S272P and R306C were found in
Chardonnay musqué clone 44-60 Dijon and Gewürztraminer respectively whereas K284N was detected for 75
genotypes and S601F in 6 varieties. An additional nonsynonymous change H11Y was found in VvDXS protein
predicted from the cDNA of Moscato Bianco. This
amino acid change was due to a polymorphism in the
first 35 bp of the 5’ coding region (at site 3764774 bp in

was found to be significantly associated with aromatic
and muscat-flavored varieties (T1822 allele being associated to Muscat type) with a smaller P-value than a
G/A SNP at position 4108 and a T/G SNP at position
4175. SNP 4108 and SNP 4175 are linked to SNP 1822,
with r 2 = 0.38 and r 2 = 0.61 respectively. SNP 1822
causes an amino acid change from K to N in position
284, whereas SNP 4108 causes a change from V to I in
position 560 and SNP 4175 being synonymous.
In all 48 neutral varieties and in 4 out of 5 neutral
varieties sharing a parentage with muscat genotypes,
the allele carrying the mutated N at position 284
(Table 6) was not present. Regarding the 72 muscat-

flavored genotypes, more than 95% of the accessions
presented the mutation, 68 varieties in the heterozygous state and only one in the homozygous state. On
the other hand, among aromatic individuals only 25%
of the genotypes (5 out of 20 varieties) had the
mutated allele N284, including one variety that presented the mutation in the homozygous state. Three
muscat-like aromatic mutants (Gewürztraminer, Chardonnay musqué clone 44-60 Dijon and Chasselas musqué) and the aromatic cultivar Siegerrebe did not show
the mutated allele N284 but instead exhibited unique
heterozygous mutations. Gewürztraminer and Siegerrebe, which share a first degree parentage, both

In order to identify polymorphisms associated with
flavor intensity, tests were performed according to an
ordinal linear regression model. However, they did not
produce any significant results after Bonferroni correction. Thus, none of the tested polymorphic sites of
VvDXS was found to be exclusively associated to either
the high muscat-flavored groups or to the aromatic, low
muscat and unstable phenotypes.

the muscat and neutral classes (D = -0.19, D = -0.35 and
D = -0.42 respectively), and in a slightly positive value
for the aromatic group (D = 0.67). Fu and Li’s D* test
(without an outgroup) yielded positive values for all the
genotypic groups evaluated (Table 3) but the value was
statistically significant (P < 0.05) only for the muscat
class (D* = 1.58).
Network analysis of reconstructed haplotypes and
haplogroups diversification

The MJ network analysis revealed a large diversity of the
haplotypes with some major haplotypes shared across
muscat-flavored, neutral and aromatic varieties. However, it also showed a major star-shaped cluster of
VvDXS haplotypes carrying the mutation N284 (haplogroup N284) present only in Muscat genotypes (Figure
5). Haplotypes unique to Siegerrebe and Gewürztraminer (C306) and to muscat-like aromatic mutants Chasselas (del GVTKQ 285-289) and Chardonnay (P272)
grouped into a distinct cluster together with two frequent haplotypes. These two common haplotypes correspond to the alleles also found in non-aromatic
Chardonnay 130 and Chasselas respectively. Allele C306
and allele del GVTKQ 285-289 were linked to the Chasselas haplotype through single distinct mutations,
whereas allele P272 was linked to the Chardonnay haplotypes. A reduced diversity in the number of segregating sites, in number of haplotypes as well as in
nucleotide diversity was observed in haplogroup N284
(Additional file 2). Tajima D tests showed a rather negative and significant value (D = -1.71, P < 0.05) in the
haplogroup N284 and a slightly positive but not significant one (D = 0.111) in the haplogroup K284. In addition, Fu and Li’s D* test was negative and significant (P
< 0.05) in the haplogroup N284 (D* = -2.71) and still
positive and non significant (D* = 0.95) in the haplogroup K284.

Discussion
The aim of the present study was to investigate the connection between the positional candidate gene VvDXS
and muscat flavor in grapevine (V. vinifera L.) using an
association genetics approach.
Description and nucleotide diversity of the candidate
gene VvDXS

VvDXS gene structure consists of ten exons and nine
introns spread for a total of 4790 bp corresponding to
the gene prediction LOC 100249323 on V. vinifera
PN40024. A coding region of 2151 bp is predicted to
encode for a DXS protein of 716 amino acids. The overall level of sequence polymorphism of VvDXS in grapevine is high and the overall SNP frequency is higher
than the average frequency of polymorphisms (1 every
64 bp) described by Lijavetsky et al. [47] for 230 gene
fragments in 10 grape genotypes. On the other hand,
the overall SNP frequency observed here is slightly
lower than the frequency described by Le Cunff et al.
[42] (1 every 49 bp) for three genes in the G-92 core
collection. Moreover, the ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous changes in VvDXS (1.5:1) is higher than
the 1:1 reported by Ljiavetsky et al. [47]. Forty percent
of the missense mutations were predicted to affect protein function, which is again higher than the 16%
observed by Lijavetsky et al. [47]. When considering the
subsets of muscat, neutral and aromatic accessions separately, the polymorphic site frequency and the mean
nucleotide variability were higher in the neutral group
than in the muscat and aromatic groups. This is not
surprising, as 45 out of 48 neutral genotypes belong to
the G-48 core collection, which was designed to represent a huge percentage of the genetic variability in a
grapevine collection [42], while muscat types share common ancestry to a certain extend.

VvDXS intragenic LD estimation and haplotype structure
detection

Pairwise LD was evaluated by calculating r2 and absolute D’ parameters for SNP loci within the VvDXS
sequence. The r 2 calculation revealed an absence of
overall intragenic LD, even though several sites were in
significant LD over long distances. On the other hand,
absolute D’ showed significant gene-wide LD. These
contradictory results may be due to the large number of
minor haplotypes in VvDXS caused by mutations rather
than recombination events. Indeed, somatic mutations
combined with vegetative propagation may have played
a major role in increasing the genetic diversity in cultivated grapevine [51]. However, intragenic and shortrange LD in grapevine have been shown to decay
rapidly. This et al. [49] reported in VvMybA1 gene an
r2 value of 0.2 along 700 nucleotides and then a rapid
decay. Lijavetsky et al. [47] observed in more than 200
gene fragments a decay of absolute D’ and r2 between
100 and 200 bp and, consistent with these data, Myles
et al. [48] recently found low levels of LD (r 2 < 0.2)
even at short physical distances with massive genotyping. On the other hand, significant long-range LD was
reported by Barnaud et al. [46] in cultivated grapevine
using SSR markers, a discrepancy that has been
observed in other species such as maize [45] and
humans [52]. However, Barnaud et al. [53] more
recently observed a rapid decay of long-range LD in the
French wild grapevine. Most of the haplotype blocks
identified in the present study are located within
introns, whereas only one haplotype block 10 exclusively covers a coding region. The exonic SNP 1594 and
SNP 2176 are located within the pyrophosphate (TPPPP) and pyrimidine (TPP-PYR) protein domains of
DXS, these being involved in the binding of Thiamine
pyrophosphate (TPP). These domains are conserved
among DXS proteins and are very similar in all the TPP
cofactor-dependent proteins (i.e. transketolase, pyruvate
oxidase, pyruvate decarboxylase, etc). The functional
significance of these regions may explain the presence
of two major haplotype blocks (five and six) which
show several intronic polymorphisms in LD with the
exonic ones.
Association testing

Allelic variation in VvDXS was associated with Muscat
flavor in cultivated grapevines sampled to maximize flavor diversity. More aromatic (muscat or other special
flavored) accessions than non-aromatic individuals were
evaluated in this analysis. In a case-control study, case
and control groups are normally equally represented. In
this study, controls were selected in order to retain a
high percentage of the microsatellite diversity of a large
grapevine germplasm collection. The wide genetic

Page 10 of 17

variability within the controls and the presence of 5
accessions sharing a parentage with muscat genotypes
but not aromatic (asymptomatic), allowed us to overcome the unequal case-control ratio. Moreover, correction for the genetic structure of the sample increases
protection against spurious associations compared to
the Chi-squared statistic that is normally applied in simple case-control studies. According to the optimal K, all
the accessions in this study divided into two genetically
distinct pools. A significant population structure effect
was observed on trait variation probably as a consequence of the over-representation of Muscat genotypes.
Modern Muscats share a strong a family structure and
are thought to descend from two very ancient grapevine
cultivars, Moscato Bianco and Muscat of Alexandria [2].
The observed population subdivision therefore reflects a
possible divergent selection for muscat flavor [1,51] that
took place in the eastern Mediterranean basins [54].
When testing aromatic and muscat-flavored genotypes
vs non-aromatic accessions in structured association,
three SNPs (SNP 1822, SNP 4108 and SNP 4175) were
found to be significant after Bonferroni correction.
Nonetheless, given the high LD level among the significant SNPs, and the higher P-values of SNP 4108 and
SNP 4175 we may also conjecture that their association
with muscat flavor is due purely to linkage with SNP
1822. Moreover, these three SNPs do not fall into any
haplotypic block deduced within the VvDXS gene. No
significant association was detected to distinguish
between aromatic and muscat-flavored fruited varieties,
nor to explain flavor intensity variation within the aromatic and muscat groups. Therefore, none of the tested
polymorphic sites of VvDXS can explain either a quantitative or qualitative effect responsible for the aromatic
to muscat flavor transition. The SNP 1822 causes a
non-synonymous amino acid change. Lysin at position
284 is replaced by an Asparagine in over 95 percent of
the muscat-flavored genotypes under study. Three Muscat-flavored accessions did not carry that mutation; it is
therefore likely that there are other muscat or aromatic
mutations in the cultivated grapevine which may be far
rarer or may not have spread within V. vinifera. The
muscat accessions identified here that do not contain
the N284 non-synonymous change in the VvDXS coding
region may well contain mutations in other candidate
genes, such as DXR, IDS and HDR, which may also contribute to the metabolic flux through the MEP pathway
[55-57]. The hypothesis that there exist other rare mutations leading to aromatic or muscat-flavored phenotypes
is reinforced by the analysis of the muscat-like aromatic
mutants and the heterogeneous aromatic group. Interestingly, as in the muscat-like aromatic mutants of
Chardonnay, Chasselas and Savagnin rosé, unique, distinct, non-neutral mutations have taken place

Emanuelli et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:241
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/241

independently in the coding region of VvDXS near to
the muscat mutation N284. The muscat-like aromatic
mutant of Savagnin rosé (Gewürztraminer) and the aromatic cultivar Siegerrebe, for which a direct parent-offspring relationship has been postulated, show the same
non-synonymous change, confirming that this mutation
was inherited together with the characteristic flavor.
Moreover, Chardonnay musqué clone 44-60 Dijon has a
single heterozygous mutation that is absent in the neutral clone Chardonnay 130. The low presence of N284
alleles in the aromatic group needs to be carefully evaluated due to the heterogeneous nature of the accessions.
Indeed, varieties showing fruity or floral flavor other
than the distinct muscat aroma may produce different
kinds of free aromatic compounds. Moreover, where
genotypes exhibit a very slight muscat flavor, this is
often hardly perceived and they are more generally classified as aromatic. A group of five aromatic accessions
(Albalonga, Aromriesling, Bouquettraube, Bouquet Sylvaner, Jo Rizling) sharing parentage with Rhine Riesling,
did not carry the mutation N284. The characteristic
aroma of these accessions mainly depends on C13 norisoprenoid accumulation in the berry skin rather than on
monoterpenoids. These genotypes accumulate monoterpenoids in higher levels compared with the nonaromatic varieties, but in significantly lower amounts
compared with Muscats [58]. Even though monoterpenoids and C13-norisoprenoids share a common precursor, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), it is reasonable to
assume that the divergent pathways giving rise to their
production are under different genetic controls. In all 48
neutral varieties of core G-48 and in 4 out of 5 neutral
varieties sharing parentage with muscat genotypes, the
N284 mutation was absent. Only Muscat Lierval presented the missense change, even though it was classified as non-aromatic. This is an exception that should
be further investigated by carrying out a quantification
of monoterpenoid content in order to confirm the phenotypic evaluation obtained by tasting. In any case,
quantitative estimates of monoterpenoid concentrations
for all Muscats and aromatic genotypes would help to
increase the power and accuracy of the association test.
This is particularly necessary when testing polymorphisms that may explain minor effects in muscat flavor
determination compared to the N284 mutation.
Neutrality Tests and network analysis of reconstructed
haplotypes
Neutrality Test

Statistical tests of neutrality on the basis of the site frequency spectrum are known to be confounded by demographic processes [59,60]. Therefore, these results need
to be carefully managed also considering the size and
the genetic structure of the sample studied. Analysis of

Page 11 of 17

site frequency distributions using the Tajima D test did
not reveal any significant departure from neutrality in
the dataset as a whole and in the subsets of muscat,
neutral and aromatic genotypes. Similarly, the null
hypothesis of evolutionary neutrality was not rejected by
Fu and Li’s D* test (without an outgroup) except in the
case of the muscat class. A significantly positive Fu and
Li’s D* describes an excess of heterozygosity in the muscat group.
Network analysis of reconstructed haplotypes and
haplogroups diversification

There is little sequence diversity within the muscatflavored allele of VvDXS containing the N284 mutation.
This narrow genetic variability is confirmed by the negative and significant values of Tajima D and Fu and Li’s
D* (Additional file 2) detected by grouping the haplotypes carrying the N284 mutation. This observation and
the presence of a star-shaped cluster observed in the MJ
analysis suggest that the muscat-flavored allele most
likely arose only once quite recently, and it underwent a
strong selective pressure or most likely an exponential
growth due to intense breeding practice. In the opposite,
Tajima D and Fu and Li’s D* are both positive but not
statistically significant for the haplogroup K284, which
grouped the remaining haplotypes. This result assess
that there are no evidence of a human-driven selection
on VvDXS alleles that do not carry the K284N mutation.
In addition, the MJ analysis shows some major
haplotypes among the haplogrouop K284 shared by
muscat-flavored, neutral and aromatic accessions. These
observations suggest a common pool of neutral varieties
used in the breeding practices of both Muscats and
Non-Muscats grapevines. Muscat genotypes share a
strong genetic family structure while displaying considerable phenotypic variability for traits such as berry
color, flowering and ripening time. It is also well known
that Muscats have been extensively used by grape breeders to obtain several popular crosses for table grapes
and for wine. The excess of heterozygosity detected in
the muscat group and the narrow genetic variability
observed in the N284 haplogroup may reflect the breeding history of the Muscat family. We suggest an initial
selection for muscat flavor, with subsequent crosses
between muscat and neutral genotypes. Individuals displaying muscat aroma and the desired phenotypic characteristics inherited from the neutral parent were then
selected and vegetatively propagated by grafting. This
way, the N284 mutation was selected and bred in its
heterozygous state in the majority of the muscat-flavored varieties in existence today. In any case, we cannot yet exclude the possibility that homozygosity of the
N284 mutation may affect grape fitness by reducing
flower fecundity and seed fertility. The MJ Network also
shows that the mutated alleles P272 (Chardonnay

musqué 44-60 Dijon), C306 (Gewürztraminer and Siegerrebe) and del GVTKQ 285-289 (Chasselas musqué)
arose independently from single mutations of non-aromatic Chardonnay 130 and Chasselas haplotypes.
Putative functional effect of the polymorphisms

The crucial role of the DXS protein has been studied in
bacteria and in plants [15,22] and its sequence is highly
conserved, although it also shows a weak sequence
homology with transketolase (TK) [61-63]. Residues
267-312 of V. vinifera VvDXS correspond to a segment
located near the active site in domain I of Deinococcus
radiodurans. Co-located in this region are the nonneutral mutations found in Muscats (K284N), Gewürztraminer and Siegerrebe (R306C), and Chardonnay musqué (S272P), as well as the 5 amino acid deletion found
in Chasselas musqué (285-289) caused by a point mutation in a splicing site. In the case of Muscats, Gewürztraminer and Siegerrebe, the substitutions alter the
amino acid R-chain charge with positively charged
amino acids (Lysin and Arginine) being replaced by neutral amino acids (Asparagine and Cystein). Lysin at position 284 is highly conserved in DXS in plants as well as
in algae and bacteria (Figure 3), whereas Serine at position 272 and Arginine at position 306 are not so highly
conserved. Interestingly, Arabidopsis lvr111 mutant [24]
presents a D306N change in 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (corresponding to D302 in V. vinifera
VvDXS) which is located close to the non-neutral
changes reported in our study. This mutation in DXS
causes a reduction in chlorophyll accumulation, so that
the lvr111 mutant shows a semi-dominant variegated
phenotype under normal growth conditions. These residues do not correspond to the conserved DRAG
sequence of DXS [64] nor to the other conserved positions identified in DXS or TKs [65-69]. This may presumably explain the non-lethal effect of amino acid
replacement in this protein region. Some recent reports
have also demonstrated that DXS is regulated at posttranscriptional levels [19-21], so we should not exclude
the possibility that these amino acid substitutions affect
protein turnover.

Conclusions
Our results confirm the role of VvDXS in determining
muscat flavor in grapevine. For the first time, to our
knowledge, an SNP in the coding region of VvDXS has
been suggested as the causal “gain of function” mutation. Besides a clear genetic separation between muscatflavored and neutral varieties, our results highlight
VvDXS as an important human-selected locus. We suggest that VvDXS underwent a strong selection in the
group of Muscats, due to specific and intense breeding
practices during grapevine domestication and post-

Page 12 of 17

domestication. In addition, by analyzing the nucleotide
sequence of VvDXS we were able to identify independent mutations in the same region of the gene giving
rise to muscat-like aromatic mutants from neutral
clones of Chardonnay, Chasselas and Savagnin rosé.
This discovery highlights the existence of distinct mutations unique to the muscat-like aromatic mutants under
study, as opposed to the SNP found in Muscats. Further
studies are required to assess the functional effect of
these putative causal mutations. Nevertheless, these
polymorphisms may be immediately applied in markerassisted selection (MAS) for rapid screening of seedlings
with the potential to express the muscat flavor.

Methods
Plant material and phenotypic data

The association population consisted of one hundred
and forty-eight grapevine (V. vinifera L.) accessions held
by the French national grapevine germplasm collection
at “Domaine de Vassal”, France [46]. This population
includes 47 genotypes of the “G-48 core collection” [42],
which encompasses more than 80% of the microsatellite
diversity found within this species. Seventy-two muscatflavored and twenty aromatic (other special flavor)
accessions were sampled to maximize flavor diversity.
Forty-eight neutral varieties and five non-aromatic
accessions sharing parentage with Muscat varieties were
also included. In addition, three muscat-like aromatic
mutants of Savagnin rosé (Gewürztraminer), Chardonnay (Chardonnay musqué clone 44-60 Dijon) and Chasselas (Chasselas musqué), were investigated. The
complete list is reported in Additional file 3. Muscat flavor was scored in different years by trained tasters who
described the accessions as either non-aromatic, aromatic or muscat. Tasters were trained by tasting several
berries of different clusters of example samples as indicated by OIV Descriptors for Grapevine - OIV code
number 236- [70]. Grape aroma was thus scored according to a 3-point scale: 0 = non-aromatic, 1 = muscat
(light and high muscat-flavored), 2 = other special flavor
(light and high aromatic). Aromatic and muscat-flavored
accessions that were perceived as non-aromatic by the
majority of the tasters in at least one season were considered respectively as aromatic unstable and muscat
unstable. The average score was used in further
analyses.
Validation of the candidate gene VvDXS expression into
Muscat genetic background
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis

The skin and pulp of 40 berries of V. vinifera ’Moscato
Bianco’, sampled from pre-véraison to over-ripening,
were separately frozen in liquid nitrogen and then
stored at -80°C for RNA extraction. Total RNA was

Emanuelli et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:241
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/241

extracted in triplicate from pericarp tissue of each sample using the SIGMA Spectrum™ Plant Total RNA Kit.
RNA concentration and 260/280 nm ratio were determined before and after DNase I digestion (Invitrogen)
with a spectrophotometer and RNA integrity was
checked by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels in 0.5
X TAE (90 mM Tris-acetate, 2 mM EDTA). First strand
cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using Superscript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cloning Moscato Bianco full-ORF VvDXS cDNA alleles

A cDNA pool equally representing each sampled ripening
stage was then used as a template for full-ORF VvDXS
cDNA amplification. The full-ORF VvDXS cDNA was
amplified by PCR using high fidelity Phusion polymerase
(Finnzymes) with the forward primer cVvDXS-fw 5-CACCATGGCTCTCTGTACG-3 and the reverse primer
cVvDXS-rw 5-CTATGACATGATCTCCAGGGC-3, corresponding to the start and the end of the coding region
of VvDXS. Primer cVvDXS-fw contains the sequence
CACC at the 5’ end of the primer to permit directional
cloning in pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen). PCR conditions
were: 98°C for 30 s followed by 35 cycles of 98°C for 10 s,
65.8°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min, with a final elongation
step of 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were purified from
agarose gel using PureLinkTM Quick Gel Extraction and
the PCR Purification Combo Kit (Invitrogen, California)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Fragments were
subcloned into vector pENTR/D-TOPO (pENTR™ Directional-TOPO cloning kit, Invitrogen, Califonia) and E. coli
One Shot TOP10 was employed as the host strain for
gene manipulation. Forty-eight clones were randomly
picked and the allele-specific ones were identified by colony PCR screening. StyI digestion (3 hs at 37°C followed
by 5 min at 65°C, 1 unit, Fermentas) was used to distinguish the two Moscato Bianco VvDXS alleles, A and B.
PCR conditions were the same as those described for
genomic resequencing of VvDXS with the forward primer
M13fw and the reverse primer ex_dxs_2rw sequences
listed in Additional file 4. Clones containing the A and B
allele were renamed pENTR/D-TOPO:VvDXSA and
pENTR/D-TOPO:VvDXSB respectively and selected for
plasmid DNA extraction with the Genelute Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified plasmid DNA of twelve out of the 48 allelespecific clones was resequenced using primers listed in
Additional file 4, as described above.
Description and nucleotide diversity of the candidate
gene VvDXS
VvDXS amplification and resequencing

Genomic DNA was extracted from 20 mg of freezedried leaf material using the DNeasy kit (Qiagen,
Hilden) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The

Page 13 of 17

VvDXS gene was amplified and directly sequenced in
148 accessions. Gene-specific primers were designed
and synthesized based on the genomic sequence of
V. vinifera PN40024 deposited in the NCBI genome
chromosome database under accession number
NC_012011. A total of 4790 bp of the VvDXS locus, from
the initial ATG start codon to the TAG stop codon, was
resequenced corresponding to base pair numbers
3759954-3764743 of NC_012011. Both strands of eight
partially overlapping amplicons were sequenced and
assembled in a contiguous sequence. Primers used to
amplify PCR fragments were also employed for the resequencing and are listed in Additional file 5. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mixture (12.5 μl) contained 5-10
ng of genomic DNA, 1.25 μl of 10× PCR buffer (QIAGENE, Valencia, CA, USA; 1.5 mM of MgCl2), 40 μM of
each dNTP, 0.6 μM of each primer and 0.5 unit of HotStarTaq polymerase (QIAGENE). Amplification was
carried out using a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA) and a touchdown protocol [71]. Thermocycling consisted of an initial
denaturation of the template DNA at 95°C for 15 min,
followed by 11 cycles of 95°C for 45 s, 62°C (touchdown step from 62°C to 57°C) for 45 s and 72°C for 1
min, and another 24 cycles of 95°C for 45 s, 57°C for
45 s and 72°C for 1 min, with a final extension of 10
min at 72°C. Reaction products were analyzed in 1.5%
agarose gels buffered in 0.5 X TBE (90 mM Trisborate, 2 mM EDTA) and visualized by UV-light after
staining with ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml). Two to four
nanograms of amplified DNA were employed for every
100 bp to be sequenced in both directions. PCR products were purified with ExoSapIT (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and sequenced with
the Big Dye® Terminator v 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit
(Applied Biosystems) in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After
precipitation, the sequencing products were mixed
with 15 μl of HiDi™ formamide and subjected to capillary electrophoresis in an ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were processed with the Sequencing analysis v 3.7 software
(Applied Biosystems) then assembled and manually
inspected with a STADEN package ver 1.5.3.
Nucleotide polymorphisms and diversity in the candidate
gene VvDXS

Based on the SNPs, INDELs and VvDXS cDNA
sequence detected, the nature and frequency of polymorphisms were defined using the DnaSP program [72]
http://www.ub.es/dnasp. Nucleotide diversity was evaluated with the parameter π [73], which is the average
number of nucleotide differences per site between two
sequences. The neutral mutation parameter θ [74] was
calculated from the total number of mutations.

[78] were calculated using the DnaSP and TASSEL software ver. 2.1 [79] http://www.maizegenetics.net/tassel.
Fisher’s exact test was applied to calculate the significance of pairwise LD when using DnaSP, while 1000
permutations were performed using TASSEL ver. 2.1.
Haplotype blocks, detected using the method described
by Gabriel et al. [80] and the LD plot of r2 values were
evaluated using the Helixtree software package (Golden
Helix).
Association genetics
Population structure

To avoid false positive associations due to genetic stratification of the population under study, all 148 accessions were genotyped at 20 genome-wide microsatellite
(SSRs) loci [81]. SSR data were used to infer the population structure using the STRUCTURE 2.1 software
[82,83]. This software applies a Bayesian clustering
approach to identify sub-populations and assign individuals to them while simultaneously estimating the allele
frequencies in the populations. STRUCTURE produces
a Q-matrix that lists the estimated membership coefficients for each individual in each cluster. The ADMIXTURE model was applied and segregation of alleles was
assumed to be independent. A burn-in length of
1,000,000 followed by 1,500,000 iterations was used to
estimate the Q-matrix for each population from one to
ten [46]. Ln Pr(X/K) was calculated, where Pr denotes
posterior probability, X denotes genotypes of the
sampled individuals, and K denotes the assumed population number. The optimal sub-population model, i.e.
the K with the highest posterior probability, was
selected using Evanno’s correction [84].
Association statistical test

The estimated Q-matrix was used in the subsequent
association analysis which was carried out by logistic
regression in the TASSEL ver. 1.4 software [79]http://
www.maizegenetics.net/tassel. The logistic regression
model was also fitted in R using the General Linear
Model (GLM) function adapted to binary data (nonaromatic = 0; aromatic and muscat = 1) and implemented
in Rcmdr, a platform-independent menu interface to R.
An ordinal linear regression analysis was then carried
out using Rcmdr to identify polymorphisms associated

with flavor intensity (with phenotypic data scored on a
3-point ordinal scale). Three almost equally-represented
ordinal classes were defined (1 = neutral, 2 = aromatic/
light muscat/muscat unstable, 3 = high muscat) and
polymorphisms were tested incorporating the Q-matrix
as covariate to class ordinal variation (class 1 to class 2
and class 2 to class 3). An ANOVA test was used to
check for type II errors occurring when a false null
hypothesis is not rejected.
Neutrality Tests and network analysis of reconstructed
haplotypes
Neutrality Tests

Tajima’s D test and Fu and Li’s D* test (without an outgroup) implemented in DnaSP were used to estimate
neutrality of the SNP polymorphisms, taking the dataset
as a whole and the muscat, neutral and aromatic classes
into consideration separately. Neutral Muscats and muscat-like aromatic mutants were not tested separately
because of the low number of individuals. Critical values
for the above tests were calculated by coalescent simulations. As recombination tends to make these tests conservative [59,60], coalescent simulations were run to
account for the level of recombination C [85] observed
in the VvDXS sequences in each class. The 95% confidence intervals of the neutral distributions were calculated using 10,000 coalescent simulations in DnaSP, and
statistical significance was inferred where the observed
value lay outside these (p < 0.05).
Network analysis of reconstructed haplotypes

Due to the heterozygous nature of the sequence, haplotypes of the VvDXS gene were reconstructed using the
Partition-Ligation expectation Maximization (PLEM)
algorithm described in Qin et al. [86] and implemented
in PHASE v2.1 [87]. A 200 burn-in with 200 iterations
in total and a thinning interval of 1 was repeated 10
times until convergence was validated. Median-Joining
(MJ) Networks [88] were constructed with the Network
4.1.1.2 program (Fluxus Technology Ltd, Clare, Suffolk,
UK). Haplogroups N284 and K284 were defined based
on the presence or absence of the polymorphism SNP
(G/T) 1822 that causes the amino acid substitution
K284N associated to muscat-flavored varieties Nucleotide diversity and tests of neutrality were performed as
described previously by treating these haplogroups
separately
