Abstract
Background: OMT (O-methyltransferase) genes are involved in lignin biosynthesis, which relates to stover cell wall
digestibility. Reduced lignin content is an important determinant of both forage quality and ethanol conversion
efficiency of maize stover.
Results: Variation in genomic sequences coding for COMT, CCoAOMT1, and CCoAOMT2 was analyzed in relation to
stover cell wall digestibility for a panel of 40 European forage maize inbred lines, and re-analyzed for a panel of 34
lines from a published French study. Different methodologies for association analysis were performed and
compared. Across association methodologies, a total number of 25, 12, 1, 6 COMT polymorphic sites were
significantly associated with DNDF, OMD, NDF, and WSC, respectively. Association analysis for CCoAOMT1 and
CCoAOMT2 identified substantially fewer polymorphic sites (3 and 2, respectively) associated with the investigated
traits. Our re-analysis on the 34 lines from a published French dataset identified 14 polymorphic sites significantly
associated with cell wall digestibility, two of them were consistent with our study. Promising polymorphisms
putatively causally associated with variability of cell wall digestibility were inferred from the total number of
significantly associated SNPs/Indels.
Conclusions: Several polymorphic sites for three O-methyltransferase loci were associated with stover cell wall
digestibility. All three tested genes seem to be involved in controlling DNDF, in particular COMT. Thus, considerable
variation among Bm3 wildtype alleles can be exploited for improving cell-wall digestibility. Target sites for
functional markers were identified enabling development of efficient marker-based selection strategies.

Background
Stover cell-wall digestibility has long been shown to be
crucial for forage quality, and more recently this trait is
getting more attention in relation to biofuel production.
Research into bioethanol has grown significantly as a
response to global warming and increasing prices of fossil fuels. The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into
fermentable sugars by the addition of enzymes has long
been recognized as an alternative to the existing starchbased ethanol production [1-3]. Reduced lignin content
improves cell wall digestibility due to increased accessibility of cellulose and hemicelluloses by enzymatic

procedures, enabling better ethanol conversion efficiency
[4]. Lignins are phenolic polymers resulting from three
monolignols: p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohol.
These monolignols derive p-hydroxyphenyl H, guaiacyl
G, and syringyl S phenylpropanoid units, respectively,
which polymerize by oxidation to form lignins [5]. In
maize, lignins are predominantly comprised of G and S
units (37.5 and 60.0%, respectively) [6], with a low, but
noticeable content in H units which is nearly five times
higher than in dicotyledonous plants.
Lignin is synthesized by the phenylpropanoid pathway
[7]. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) catalyzes the first
step by removing ammonia from L-Phe to produce p-coumaric acid, followed by a series of enzymatic steps involving cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), 4-coumarate:CoA
ligase (4CL), hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA transferase (HCT),

p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase (C3H), caffeoyl-CoA Omethyltransferase (CCoAOMT), cinnamoyl-CoA reductase
(CCR), ferulate 5-hydroxylase (F5H), caffeic acid Omethyltransferase (COMT), and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) catalyzing the biosynthesis of monolignols. Genes encoding these enzymes controlling the
phenylpropanoid pathway in maize have been cloned
[8-15].
Four brown midrib mutations in maize (bm1, bm2,
bm3, and bm4) are associated with alterations of and
reductions in lignin content in stover [16]. The bm1
mutation decreases cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase
(CAD) activity [17], while the bm3 mutation results in
reduced caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity [18]. The genetic events underlying bm2 and bm4
mutations are unknown.
Several studies reported improvement in the digestibility of corn silage in ruminant feeding of brown midrib mutants, especially bm3 materials [19-25].
However, negative effects of brown midrib genotypes
have also been reported in relation to agricultural fitness, such as reduced grain and stover yield and stalk
breakage [26-28]. Reduced grain yield, combined with
other negative effects caused by the bm3 mutation is
so significant that it might be difficult to produce
superior maize bm3 hybrids in terms of agricultural fitness [27,26]. However, the same authors report large
genetic variation among bm3 lines, and the genotype
specificity among bm3 lines in relation to yield reduction [26,27,29].
Although many studies investigated phenotypic effects
in relation to down regulation of lignin genes for maize
and other species [30-36], intragenic variability of OMT
genes involved in lignin synthesis have not been studied
to the same extent. Ultimately, characterized QTN
(Quantitative Trait Nucleotide) or QTINDEL (Quantitative Trait Insertion-Deletion) polymorphisms within
these genes would allow development of Functional
Markers (FM) [37]. Prerequisite for distinguishing the
effects of different intragenic polymorphisms is low LD
(linkage disequilibrium) in the population(s) analyzed.
Nucleotide diversity, LD, and associations to forage
quality traits have been studied for several genes
involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway [38-41]. While
LD decreased rapidly within few hundred bp in the
COMT and CCoAOMT2 coding genes [40,41], LD persisted over a thousand bp in the CCoAOMT1 gene [40].
In this study, variation in genomic sequences coding
for COMT, CCoAOMT1, and CCoAOMT2 was analyzed
in relation to stover cell wall digestibility for the same
panel of 40 European forage maize inbred lines investigated by Andersen et al. [38,42] for other “lignin genes”
(Experiment 1). In addition, data published by GuilletClaude et al. [40] in an association analysis of the three

Page 2 of 12

O-methyltransferase genes in relation to cell wall digestibility were re-analyzed (Experiment 2), based on a different statistical approach by using General Linear
Model, and including population structure. The objectives were, (1) to identify associations between individual
polymorphisms and four forage quality traits determined
for maize stover in Exp. 1, (2) to evaluate the impact of
sequence alignment parameters on the outcome of association studies, (3) to re-analyze data of Exp. 2 under
consideration of population structure, and (4) to compare findings between both experiments for these three
jointly analyzed genes.

Methods
Plant Materials and Phenotypic Analyses

The 40 lines within Exp. 1 represent a broad range of
Central European forage maize germplasm, and were
extremes within a larger collection of >300 maize
inbreds with respect to stover cell-wall digestibility
(unpublished data). Thirty-five lines originated from the
current breeding program of KWS Saat AG and five
lines were from the public domain (AS01, AS02, AS03,
AS39, and AS40, identical to F7, F2, EP1, F288, and F4,
respectively).
The inbred lines were evaluates in Grucking (sandy
loam) in 2002, 2003, and 2004, and in Bernburg (sandy
loam) in 2003 and 2004. The experiments consisted of
49 entries in a 7 × 7 lattice design with two replications.
Nine entries from this design were consisting of not
sequenced checks (such as knock-out mutants of brown
midrib loci with known high cell wall digestibility).
Therefore, only 40 lines were analyzed for cell wall
properties and sequenced. The single row plots were
0.75 m apart and 3 m long with a total of 20 plants.
The ears were manually removed and the stover was
chopped 50 days after flowering. Approximately 1 kg of
stover was collected and dried at 40°C. The stover was
ground to pass through a 1 mm sieve. Quality analyses
were performed with near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) based on previous calibrations on the data
of 300 inbred lines (unpublished results). Four traits
were analyzed: Water Soluble Carbohydrate (WSC),
Organic Matter Digestibility (OMD), Neutral Detergent
Fiber (NDF) and digestible Neutral Detergent Fiber
(DNDF). DNDF was estimated by DNDF = 100 (IVDMD - (100 - NDF))/NDF based on Goering and
Van Soest, 1970 [43]. Since the investigated traits were
highly heritable [42,44], and “trait × location” interactions were not significant, replications and locations
were averaged, so that each entry was represented by
mean values of the cell wall traits. The results of phenotypic analysis were published previously [38]. The heritabilities of NDF and DNDF were 86.5% and 92.2%,
respectively [42].

Thirty-four inbred lines were employed in Exp. 2,
including public lines and ecotypes both from Europe
and U.S., covering substantial variation in forage quality.
The lines were evaluated in three different years: 2006,
2008, and 2009 (unpublished data of INRA Lusignan).
Values of stover in vitro cell wall digestibility was estimated by DNDF = (100 × (ES - (100 - NDF)/NDF) [45],
based on enzymatic solubility (ES) of Aufrere and
Michalet-Doreau,[46].
DNA isolation, PCR amplification, and DNA sequencing

The inbred lines from Exp. 1 were grown in the greenhouse for DNA isolation. Leaves were harvested three
weeks after germination, and DNA was extracted using
the Maxi CTAB method [47]. Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) primers were developed based on maize mRNA
sequences identified in GenBank by employing BLAST
[48] for three genes: COMT, CCoAOMT1 and
CCoAOMT2. PCR reactions contained 20 ng genomic
DNA, primers (200 nM), dNTPs (200 μM), 1 M Betain
and 2 units of Taq polymerase (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany), in a total reaction volume of 50 μl. A touchdown
PCR program was: denaturation at 95°C for 2 min, 15
amplification cycles: 45 sec at 95°C; 45 sec at 68°C
(minus 0.5°C per cycle), 2 min at 72°C, followed by 24
amplification cycles: 45 sec at 95°C; 45 sec at 60°C, 2
min at 72°C, and a final extension step at 72°C for 10
min.
Products were separated by gel electrophoresis on
1.5% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide and
photographed using an eagle eye apparatus (Herolab,
Wiesloch, Germany). Amplicons were purified using
QiaQuick spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia, USA) according to the manufacturer instructions, and directly
sequenced using internal sequence specific primers and
the Big Dye1.1 dye-terminator sequencing kit on an ABI
377 (PE Biosystems, Foster City, USA). Electropherograms of overlapping sequencing fragments were manually edited using the software Sequence Navigator
version 1.1, from PE Biosystems.
Full alignments were built for CCoAOMT1 and
CCoAOMT2 genes by using default settings of the
CLUSTAL W program. Several Indels were present
among the different COMT alleles in Exp. 1 [24]. Thus,
four different alignment parameters were set in CLUSTAL W [49] to validate the consistency of polymorphic
sites. The first alignment was based on default parameters, additional alignments were constructed by using
different parameter settings in relation to gap penalty.
The exon-intron structure of the three O-methyltransferase genes was estimated by alignments of genomic to
mRNA sequences.
In Exp. 2, primer pairs for CCoAOMT1 and
CCoAOMT2 were designed based on published cDNA
sequences (accession numbers AJ242980 and AJ242981),

respectively. For both genes, fragments of about 1.2
to1.3 kb were amplified, encompassing the 5’-UTR and
the complete coding region [40]. Since the COMT promoter sequence was not available in databases, a walking-PCR procedure was performed to amplify the 5’flanking region. Sequencing was performed for each
PCR fragment in both directions by Isoprim (Toulouse,
France) and MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). The
sequences containing singletons were checked by reamplifying genomic DNA and partially re-sequencing
the appropriate alleles. Contigs were constructed using
SeqWeb (GCG Wisconsin Package). Sequences were
aligned using CLUSTAL W [49].
Population structure and association analysis

Lines evaluated in Exp. 1 were genotyped with 101 simple sequence repeat (SSRs) markers providing an even
coverage of the maize genome. Population structure was
estimated from the SSR data by the Structure 2.0 software [50,51]. The Q matrix estimating membership
coefficients for each individual in each subpopulation
was produced. A burn-in length of 50.000 followed by
50.000 iterations was applied. The Admixture model
was applied with independent allele frequencies.
Association between polymorphisms and mean phenotypic values were performed by the General Linear
Model (GLM) analyses in TASSEL. The Q matrix produced by Structure was included as covariate in the analysis to control for populations structure. The
polymorphisms were determined as significant for padj_Marker (based on 10.000 permutations) equal to
0.05 or less. p-adj_Marker is a permutation based
experiment-wise error rate which controls the error rate
over all the markers tested.
The same parameters were applied to perform the
Logistic Regression in TASSEL. In this association analysis a logistic regression ratio test is used to evaluate
associations involving quantitative traits while controlling for population structure [52]. The trait values permuted relative to the fixed haplotypes were recalculated
for 10.000 permutations.
Associations were also tested by the Mixed Linear
Model (MLM) in TASSEL [53]. The MLM accounts not
only for overall population structure (Q), but also finer
scale relative kinship (K). Loiselle kinship coefficients
[54] between lines (a K matrix) were estimated by the
SPAGeDI software [55] based on the SSR data mentioned above. Negative values between two individuals
in the K matrix were set to zero. The Bonferroni Stepdown correction [56] was applied to correct for multiple
testing as the p-values for the MLM analysis are
expressed on a single marker basis in TASSEL.
Significant intron polymorphisms in Exp.1 were analyzed for alterations in motif sequences, using the inbred
line W64 as reference sequence (AY323283). Differential

splicing was tested by comparing expressed sequences
with genomic sequences. The discrimination of favorable and unfavorable alleles at each significant associated polymorphic site at COMT was done by grouping
lines by alleles and averaging DNDF values within the
same group.
Guillet-Claude et al. [40] tested for associations
between cell wall digestibility and polymorphic sites of
COMT, CCoAOMT1, and CCoAOMT2 by performing
Multiple Linear Regression without considering population structure. Our re-analysis included population
structure in the GLM analysis of TASSEL. The P-value
of all individual polymorphisms (including singletons)
was estimated based on 10,000 permutations. Population
structure data were obtained from Camus-Kulandaivelu
et al. [57], where five sub-populations were found using
55 SSR loci in Sructure [50,51].

Results
Genetic diversity within COMT, CCoAOMT1, and
CCoAOMT2

The analysis of overlapping sequences of common
inbred lines between Exp.1 and Exp.2 (F2, F4, F7, F288,
EP1, and W64) revealed consistency of sequences for
the COMT gene across both experiments. Only one
SNP each was different among overlapping sequences of
F4 and EP1 inbred lines, respectively (Table 1). For
CCoAOMT1, F2 and F7 sequences were identical in
both experiments, whereas between two (F288) and 13
(EP1) polymorphisms were identified for the other three
inbred lines (Table 1). For the CCoAMT2 gene, only
two inbred lines were common between both studies.
One SNP and one large Indel were identified for F288,
whereas sequences perfectly matched for EP1. For each
of the three genes, sequences of lines used in both
experiments, were in all cases most similar across both
experiments: even when comparing the EP1
CCoAOMT1 allele from Exp. 1 with all alleles in Exp. 2,
the Exp. 2 EP1 allele was the most similar sequence to
Exp. 1 EP1 among all Exp. 2 sequences.
Analysis of haplotype diversity for the 40 inbred lines
employed in Exp. 1 revealed 13, 9, and 6 haplotypes for
COMT, CCoAOMT1, and CCoAOMT2, respectively

(Table 2). The range of haplotype means for all four
stover quality traits was larger for COMT compared to
the other two genes (Table 2). A total number of 26, 12,
and 14 haplotypes was previously identified by GuilletClaude et al. [40], for COMT, CCoAOMT1, and
CCoAOMT2, respectively. When sequences from both
experiments were jointly analyzed for haplotype numbers, 38 haplotypes were discriminated for COMT, and
15 haplotypes each for CCoAOMT1, and CCoAOMT2
(data not shown).
Association analysis of COMT in Experiment 1

Varying alignment lengths and number of polymorphic
sites were observed when four different parameter sets
were applied for aligning COMT by CLUSTAL W. By
GLM based on the first alignment (default settings), 16
polymorphisms were significantly associated with
DNDF, whereas alignment settings 2, 3, and 4 identified
13, 14, and 14 polymorphic sites, respectively (Table 3),
significantly associated with DNDF. Different gap opening and gap extension penalties lead to different Indel
numbers and sizes. Some polymorphisms were observed
to change positions, others were created or vanished.
Only eight polymorphic sites showing significant associations with DNDF were in common among all four
alignments.
All subsequent analyses were performed for default
sequence alignment settings, in order to be able to compare findings reported here with previous studies
[38,42]. In Exp. 1, a total number of 16 COMT polymorphic sites were significantly associated with DNDF
using GLM analysis: 9 SNPs and 7 Indels (Table 4). The
same sites were identified by MLM analysis, with the
exception of one SNP located at 1439 bp and one Indel
located at 1638 bp based on the reference sequence
AY323283 of Genbank. Logistic regression analysis in
TASSEL identified a larger number of significant polymorphic sites in association with DNDF: 16 SNPs and 9
Indels, respectively (Table 4).
No polymorphic sites were observed to be significantly
associated with DNDF in the first exon, and most of the
polymorphic sites identified for this trait were located in
the intron, where 13 SNPs and 9 Indels were detected.
In the second exon, three SNPs were significantly

were in high LD (Fig. 1).

second exon of the COMT gene. Low values of LD were
observed between this SNP and other polymorphic sites
associated with DNDF, OMD, and WSC (Fig. 1). All
polymorphic sites (six SNPs and six Indels) associated
with OMD matched positions of DNDF associated polymorphic sites, most of them located in the intron. Only
two SNPs (2103 and 2178 bp) were identified in the second exon of the gene, both causing changes in amino
acid sequences (Ser/Pro and His/Asp, respectively). All
polymorphic sites identified for WSC were located in
the intron: five SNPs and one Indel with high LD
among each other (Fig. 1). Six singletons in complete
LD located at positions 1064, 1070, 1071, 1072, 1073,
and 1074 bp were identified by GLM to be significantly
associated with all four traits, but not included in Table
4.
Eight significantly associated Indels in the COMT
intron affected five motifs representing binding sites for
transcription factors RAV1, GAmyb, and DOFs 1, 2, and
3. Tests for differential splicing did not reveal divergent
patterns of exon inclusion (data not shown). Across
polymorphisms significantly associated with DNDF, lines
containing mostly favorable alleles had on average
higher DNDF values than lines containing mostly unfavorable alleles (Fig. 2). However, one line (AS22) with
all favorable alleles had a low DNDF value and three
lines (AS26, AS29 and AS37) containing only unfavorable alleles had high DNDF values.
Association analysis of CCoAOMT1 and CCoAOMT2 in
Experiment 1

Association analysis for CCoAOMT1 revealed substantially fewer polymorphic sites associated with the traits
investigated as compared to COMT. Two SNPs were
identified by GLM: one SNP was associated with NDF
and located in the third intron, and a second SNP was
associated with both NDF and OMD, located in the
fourth intron. One additional SNP identified by Logistic
Regression (Table 5) associated with WSC was identified
in the fifth exon, leading to amino acid substitution.
High LD was observed between SNPs of sites 726 and
944, while low LD was observed between site 1299 and
sites 726 and 944 bp (Fig. 1).
Only two Indels showed significant trait associations
for CCoAOMT2 by Logistic Regression, and only one

polymorphisms within CCoOAMT1 and DINAGZ, while
an 18-bp Indel associated with DINAGZ was identified
for CCoAOMT2. DINAGZ and DNDF are both estimates of CWD based on in vitro enzymatic solubility,
differing on how the fully digestible part of the non-cellwall part is computed. The correlation between the two
traits is high (nearly 0.90, INRA Lusignan unpublished
data). For this reason, the association results from Guillet-Claude et al. [40] should be phenotypically comparable to our analysis (using DNDF).
After taking population structure into account, five
sub-populations were identified for this line panel by
Camus-Kulandaivelu et al. [57]. In total 14 polymorphic
sites showed significant associations with DNDF for the
three investigated genes (Table 6). Thirteen of those
polymorphic sites were singletons, and most of them
were located in non-coding regions.
For COMT, three SNPs and two Indels were identified
by GLM. The SNP located at position 1948 bp was also
identified as significantly associated with DNDF in Exp.
1. This SNP was observed to be in high LD with another
polymorphic site at position 1981 bp, not identified in
Exp.1, and low LD with the other three trait-associated
sites identified in Exp. 2. The two polymorphic sites at
positions 749 bp and 1981 bp were also present in
Exp.1, but not significantly associated with any of the
four traits analyzed. Two polymorphisms located in the
promoter (at positions 342 and 659 bp) were not polymorphic in Exp.1.

was also detected by GLM (Table 5). Both Indels were
located in the second intron of the CCoAOMT2 gene,
and both were associated with WSC. Both polymorphisms were in complete LD. intron polymorphisms of
CCoAOMT1 and CCoAOMT2 did not cause changes in
known motifs, and were not found to cause differential
splicing.
Association analysis of COMT, CCoAOMT1, and CCoAOMT2
in Experiment 2

Guillet-Claude et al. [40] identified polymorphic sites of
COMT associated with DINAGZ, all located in noncoding regions. No association was found between

Contrary to the findings of Guillet-Claude et al. [40],
two SNPs and three Indels showed significant associations between CCoAOMT1 and DNDF. One SNP
located at position 944 bp was also found to be significantly associated with NDF and OMD in Exp. 1. This
SNP was in high LD with Indels at positions 704 and
734 bp, and in low LD with polymorphic sites at positions 956 and 972 bp. The Indel at positon 734 bp was
also observed in Exp.1, but it was not significantly associated with any four traits investigated in Exp. 1. Four
SNPs in CCoAOMT2 sequence were significantly associated with DNDF. All polymorphisms were singletons
not identified in Exp.1, and three of them were located
in non-coding regions.

Discussion
Impact of sequence alignments and association analysis
methods on results of association studies

Changing alignments parameters for gap opening and
gap extension costs leads to the creation of alignments
with different Indel sizes and frequencies [58]. Different
studies investigated consequences of different alignments parameters settings in the outcome of phylogenetic studies [59-62]. However, little is known about the
effect of different alignment settings in association analysis. Our results demonstrate that different sets of polymorphisms are identified by association analyses,
depending on alignments settings (Table 3). This is
especially true for sequences with multiple Indels as
observed for COMT, where choosing optimal alignment
parameters might be difficult. Comparison of different
alignments varying for gap costs may be used to identify

alleles in relation to average DNDF for lines in Exp.1.

the most consistent significantly associated polymorphic
sites.
In this study, cell wall traits of two relatively small
populations (40 and 34 lines) were tested for associations with two large sets of polymorphic sites (SNPs and
Indels). The large number of independent variables
(SNPs/Indels) in relation to number of dependent variables (lines/phenotypic data) increases the chances of
false positive associations due to overfitting [63]. However, we believe that high heritability values of the cell
wall traits analyzed [42,44] and stringent significance
levels estimated by 10.000 permutations limit the rate of
false positives [64].
The control of systematic differences due to population structure and kinship has also been suggested to
avoid spurious associations and for greatest statistical
power in association studies [53,65]. In this study, two
of our models (GLM and Logistic Regression) were controlling for population structure, and the mixed model
(MLM) approach was controlling for both population
structure and kinship. Most of the lines evaluated in
this study could be clearly identified as Flint or Dent
lines (see Figure five: Andersen et al. [38]).
Across the investigated genes in this study, most of
the significantly associated polymorphisms were
detected by Logistic Regression, followed by GLM and
MLM. A few previous studies compared results of association analyses from these methods. Andersen et al.
[66] in an attempt to validate associations of the Dwarf8
locus identified by Thornsberry et al. [52], identified a
larger number of polymorphisms associated with flowering time when using GLM (without control of population structure) as compared to Logistic Regression (with
control of population structure). According to the
authors, GLM identified more significant polymorphisms, because variation of causal alleles was closely correlated with population structure. In corroboration with
our results, Andersen et al [42] observed a larger number of significant polymorphisms by GLM analysis
accounting for population structure as compared to
MLM accounting for both population structure and kinship corrections. Fewer significant polymorphisms identified by MLM are expected, as MLM also corrects for
kinship, and significant polymorphisms identified in
GLM but not in MLM might thus reflect identity of
polymorphisms by descent. Investigating three QTL in
277 diverse maize inbred lines, Yu et al. [53] concluded
that the model accounting for both population structure
(Q) and relative kinship (K) gave the best approximation
to the cumulative distribution of p-values when compared to models containing only K, only Q and a simple
model (in which family structure is ignored).
Across the three genes and four traits within Exp. 1,
13 polymorphisms were consistent across the three

methods, while one polymorphism was identified by
both GLM and MLM, 3 by both GLM and Logistic
Regression. No significant polymorphic sites were consistent between both MLM and Logistic Regression.
Logistic Regression was the method detecting the highest number of significant polymorphisms in our study.
With this method, permutation tests are performed for
individual markers, not controlling for experiment-wise
error rates. Consequently, a larger number of false positives are expected for this method of analysis when
compared to analyses that control for experiment-wise
error, like GLM in our study. Logistic Regression (and
GLM in one occasion) revealed significant associations
between the three OMT genes with WSC, with none of
these three genes being involved in biosynthesis of soluble carbohydrates (Tables 4 and 5). However, we were
able to identify one SNP in Exp.1 by Logistic Regression
(but not by the other two methods) that was consistent
with Exp. 2 (SNP at position 1948 of the COMT gene,
Table 6). Moreover, many polymorphisms identified by
Logistic Regression were also identified by GLM and
MLM when considering p-values between 0.05 and 0.10,
especially for associations between COMT with NDF,
OMD, and WSC (data not shown). It can be inferred
that these QTN/Indels are at the threshold of being
detectable, and even small changes in statistical methods
or parameters might lead to (non-) significance of these
sites. Therefore, significant polymorphisms identified by
association analyses, need to be validated by independent experiments (ongoing).
Consistency of association results across experiments

Two SNPs were identified as significantly associated in
both datasets (Exp.1 and Exp.2). The SNP at position
1948 bp in the COMT intron was significantly associated with DNDF. At this C/T polymorphic site, a

sequence motif for a DOF3 zinc finger transcription factor was identified for the allele with the T base present.
The second SNP consistent across experiments was
located in the site 944 bp at the fourth intron of
CCoAOMT1. This SNP did not cause motif or splicing
alterations, but it was significantly associated with both
NDF and OMD in Exp.1. The consistency of these two
SNPs across experiments makes them excellent candidates for development of FMs.
In addition, three polymorphic sites identified in Exp.
2 were also observed in Exp.1, but not significantly associated with the investigated traits. The relative low number of common polymorphic sites between Exp.1 and
Exp.2 can in part be explained by the different regions
of genes that each experiment investigated. The overlapping region of each gene common to both studies was
not representing the whole gene. Moreover, for some
lines overlapping sequences were not completely identical in both studies (Table 1), most likely due to residual
heterozygosity as the “same” lines in both studies had in
all cases the most similar sequences. In addition, most
of the significantly associated polymorphic sites identified in Exp. 2 were singletons, which have a low probability of being indentified across datasets. Finally, Exp.
1 and 2 were conducted in quite different environments
in Germany and France, respectively, which might
explain for the different performance of the “same lines”
with regard to CWD in both experiments.

Genes controlling forage quality

Most of the significant SNPs/Indels identified in Exp. 1
were identified for COMT (44 significant polymorphisms) while a smaller number of sites was identified for
CCoAOMT1 and CCoAOMT2 (three and two significant
polymorphic sites, respectively). Guillet-Claude et al [40]
also observed a larger number of polymorphisms for
COMT compared to CCoAOMT1 and CCoAOMT2. In
both experiments, the alignment sequence size of
COMT was approximately two times larger than
CCoAOMT1 and CCoAOMT2, whereas the number of
significantly associated polymorphisms for COMT were
substantially higher than 2-fold.
Andersen et al. [42] investigated the same set of 40 lines
for six other “lignin genes” in relation to NDF, IVDOM,
and DNDF, and identified significant associations for
4CL1, C3H, and F5H genes. The DNDF range between
haplotypes within these three genes was largest for C3H
(10.0%), followed by F5H (7.7%) and 4CL1 (2.3%). COMT
haplotypes differed for DNDF by 17.8% (Table 2). Larger
differences between haplotypes suggest that COMT is a
promising candidate gene to derive markers affecting
stover cell-wall digestibility. Moreover, down regulation of

COMT in Arabidopsis, poplar, alfalfa and maize affecting
the lignin content/structure support the strong effect of
this gene on variation for cell wall digestibility [30-36].
Polymorphisms associated with cell wall digestibility

The association analyses revealed a considerable number
of SNPs and Indels associated with cell wall traits for
the genes analyzed. Across experiments, methodologies
and genes, 11 significant QTNs/Indels were located in
coding regions and 52 significant polymorphisms were
located in non-coding regions. Some of the significant
associations identified in this study may reflect a statistical artifact. The probability of false-positive associations
is higher in case of rare alleles and cases where a polymorphic site was only detected with one of the alignments. In addition, several of the identified significant
associations can likely be explained by high LD to closely linked causal QTN/QTINDELs. Within an unresolved linkage block, likely only one or few
polymorphisms are causative (Figs. 1 and 3). Polymorphisms causing amino acid changes are promising candidates for causative QTN/QTINDELs. The SNPs
identified to cause amino acid changes in positions 2178

Brenner et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:27
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/27

and 2185 bp of COMT (Table 4) were identified by all
statistical methods, being, therefore, strong candidate
sites to cause DNDF variation.
Several significantly associated polymorphisms located
in non-coding regions have been reported. Andersen et
al. [42] identified two respective SNPs in the F5H gene
as significantly associated with NDF and DNDF. Wilson
et al. [67] identified significant intron polymorphisms
associated with kernel composition traits for sh1 and
sh2 genes. Polymorphisms located in introns can be
“causative” if affecting transcript abundance (expression
and stability) of genes [68]. The analysis of motif alterations revealed eight significant associated Indels in
COMT introns disrupting the sequence of five motifs,
which represent binding sites for transcription factors
RAV1, GAmyb, and DOFs 1, 2, and 3. DOF-type transcription factors are well known for their function as
transcriptional activators or repressors of tissue-specific
gene expression. More recently, they have been identified as putative regulators of lignin biosynthetic genes,
based on the microarray analyses of Arabidopsis ectopic
lignification mutants [69]. Therefore, although polymorphisms in positions 1439, 1920, 1948, 1952, 1953,
and 1954 bp are located in the COMT intron, they
might play an important role as cis-regulators of gene
expression, causing changes in the lignin content and
variation in DNDF values. intron polymorphisms might
also be part of splicing signals that could cause differential splicing encoding structurally and functionally distinct protein products. However, no divergent patterns
of exon inclusion were observed for the three genes analyzed (data not shown).

Conclusions
Lines containing favorable alleles at putative QTN or
QTINDELs were generally, but not always associated
with high phenotypic values for cell wall digestibility. As
cell wall digestibility is a polygenic inherited quantitative
trait, likely unfavorable alleles at other loci affecting this
trait are responsible for this finding, either by strong
main effects or interaction with COMT. In agreement
with these observations, Barriere et al. [70] identified
conventional inbreds with equally high cell wall digestibility as bm3 lines, supporting that other genes can
have strong effects on this trait. Identifying and combining favorable alleles from multiple genes affecting cell
wall digestibility is, therefore, mandatory for functional
marker-based improvement of stover for forage and biofuel usage.
