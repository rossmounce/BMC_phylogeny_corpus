<p>A core of widely distributed network branches biosynthesizing at least 16 out of the 20 standard amino acids is predicted using comEvolution of amino acid

Abstract
Background: Twenty amino acids comprise the universal building blocks of proteins. However,
their biosynthetic routes do not appear to be universal from an Escherichia coli-centric perspective.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to understand their origin and evolution in a global context, that is, to
include more 'model' species and alternative routes in order to do so. We use a comparative
genomics approach to assess the origins and evolution of alternative amino acid biosynthetic
network branches.
Results: By tracking the taxonomic distribution of amino acid biosynthetic enzymes, we predicted
a core of widely distributed network branches biosynthesizing at least 16 out of the 20 standard
amino acids, suggesting that this core occurred in ancient cells, before the separation of the three
cellular domains of life. Additionally, we detail the distribution of two types of alternative branches
to this core: analogs, enzymes that catalyze the same reaction (using the same metabolites) and
belong to different superfamilies; and 'alternologs', herein defined as branches that, proceeding via
different metabolites, converge to the same end product. We suggest that the origin of alternative
branches is closely related to different environmental metabolite sources and life-styles among
species.
Conclusion: The multi-organismal seed strategy employed in this work improves the precision of
dating and determining evolutionary relationships among amino acid biosynthetic branches. This
strategy could be extended to diverse metabolic routes and even other biological processes.
Additionally, we introduce the concept of 'alternolog', which not only plays an important role in
the relationships between structure and function in biological networks, but also, as shown here,
has strong implications for their evolution, almost equal to paralogy and analogy.

Background

Metabolism represents an intricate set of enzyme-catalyzed
reactions synthesizing and degrading compounds within
cells. It is likely that a small number of enzymes with broad
specificity existed in early stages of metabolic evolution.
Genes encoding these enzymes probably have been duplicated, generating paralog enzymes that, through sequence
divergence, became more specialized, giving rise, for
instance, to the isomerases HisA (EC:5.3.1.16) and TrpC
(EC:5.3.1.24), which act in histidine and tryptophan biosynthesis, respectively [1-4]. Additionally, gene duplication can
promote innovations, generating enzymes catalyzing functionally different reactions, such as HisA, HisF (EC:2.4.2.-)
and TrpA (EC:4.2.1.10). The classic view of metabolism is that
relatively isolated sets of reactions or pathways are enough
for the synthesis and degradation of compounds. The new
perspective views metabolic components (substrates, products, cofactors, and enzymes) as nodes forming branches
within a single network [5,6].
In the past few years, an increasing amount of information on
metabolic networks from different species has become available [7-10], allowing for comparative genomic-scale studies
on the evolution of both specific pathways [11,12] and whole
metabolic networks [13-16]. Collectively, these studies highlight the contribution of gene duplication in the evolution of
metabolism. Nevertheless, analog enzymes - those catalyzing
the same reaction, even belonging to different evolutionary
families - have been suggested to play an important role on
this process as well [17]. This results, for instance, in three different types of acetolactate synthases (EC:2.2.1.6) acting in
the biosynthesis of L-valine and L-leucine in Escherichia coli.
Additionally, the modern perspective of metabolic processes
has shown that evolutionary studies must include not only
phylogenetic relationships among enzymes, but also the
influence of some topological properties of metabolic networks [5,6,18-20]. One of these properties is the capability of
metabolism to circumvent failures - for example, mutations
promoting unbalanced fluxes - using alternative network
branches and enzymes. Here, we introduce the term 'alternolog' to refer to these alternative branches and enzymes that,
proceeding via different metabolites, converge in a common
product. Some authors have suggested that alternative
branches can contribute to genetic buffering in eukaryotes to
a degree similar to gene duplication [18], but the role of these
alternologs in the evolution of metabolism in other phylogenetic groups remains to be solved. In evolutionary terms, one
can assume that the universal occurrence of some pathways
and branches in modern species suggests that they existed in
the last common ancestor (LCA). The evolution of these pathways and the emergence of paralogs, analogs and alternologs
reflect an increased metabolic diversity as a consequence of
increasing genome size, protein structural complexity and
selective pressures in changing environments. In the evolution of amino acid biosynthesis, for instance, alternative pathways synthesizing L-lysine via either L,L-diaminopimelate or

Volume 9, Issue 6, Article R95

Hernández-Montes et al. R95.2

alpha-aminoadipate have been suggested to have developed
independently in diverse clades [21-23]. The evolution of
these pathways is closely related to the biosynthesis of Larginine and L-leucine [22-24] and even to the Krebs cycle
[24], but the origin of all these pathways is still under discussion. Diverse studies [6,25,26] have suggested that amino
acids could be among the earliest metabolic compounds.
However, two main questions have emerged from these studies: from what did their biosynthetic networks originate and
how did they evolve? And how did gene duplication (paralogs), functional convergence (analogs) and network structural alternatives (alternologs) contribute to these processes?
The purpose of this work is to broach these questions, combining both a network perspective and a comparative genomics approach. For this purpose we consider that the
architecture of proteins preserves structural information that
can be used to identify their relative emergence during the
evolution of metabolism. Specifically, we identified a set of
enzymes and branches that originated closer to the existence
of the LCA, delimiting a core of enzyme-driven reactions that
putatively catalyzed the biosynthesis of at least 16 out of the
20 amino acids in early stages of evolution. Additionally, we
determined the contributions of biochemical functional alternatives to this core (paralogs, analogs, and alternologs) during the evolution of amino acid biosynthesis in diverse
species.

Results and discussion
Biological distribution of amino acid biosynthetic
networks
The origins and evolution of amino acid biosynthesis were
assessed by analyzing the taxonomic distributions (TDs) of its
catalyzing enzymes. Each enzyme's TD is a vector of ortholog
distribution (presences/absences) in a set of genomes or
clades (see Materials and methods). The rationale is that TDs
provide clues concerning the relative appearance of enzymes,
branches and pathways during the evolution of metabolism.
We determined the TDs for 537 enzyme functional domains,
catalyzing 188 reactions in the biosynthesis of amino acids
from diverse species, in a set of 410 genomes (30 Archaea,
363 Bacteria and 17 Eukarya). To this end, we followed a two
step strategy: first, we scanned the genomes to identify
orthologs (best reciprocal hits (BRHs)) for the 113 amino acid
biosynthetic enzymes from E. coli K12 defined in the EcoCyc
database [8]: and second, a second set of ortholog, paralog,
analog and alternolog enzymes and branches from different
species, defined in the MetaCyc [9] and MjCyc [9] databases,
was used to fill out the gaps in the E. coli-based TDs. Figure 1
shows a network formed by the 188 reactions analyzed in this
work and the average distribution of orthologs for their catalyzing enzymes (see Materials and methods). We considered
two broad categories for ortholog distribution: widely distributed enzymes, whose ortholog distribution is ≥ 50% across
the clades analyzed here; and partially distributed enzymes,
whose ortholog distribution is <50% across these clades. The

wide distribution of enzymes, branches and pathways suggests their occurrence in the LCA, although these categories
are simply a tool for presentation purposes. Even when a
pathway shows a low average distribution of orthologs, some
of its branches can be widely distributed across the three cellular domains (Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya), and hence
these branches might be present in the LCA. The opposite scenario can also take place, that is, some enzymes can exhibit a
high average distribution, but they could be restricted to specific cellular domains or divisions, such as Bacteria or γ-proteobacteria, that are overrepresented in sequenced genomes.
Thus, their distribution does not necessarily signify their
occurrence in the LCA. For these reasons, we exhaustively
examined the TDs of enzymes forming each branch within
amino acid biosynthetic pathways. In the following sections
we describe our main findings in decreasing order of average
ortholog distribution, emphasizing the possible existence of
some branches in the LCA.

Nine amino acid biosynthetic pathways are widely
distributed across the three domains of life, and eight
of their branches probably occurred in the LCA
L-arginine
There are at least four L-arginine synthesis pathways, interplaying with the conversion of L-ornithine and citrulline,
although they can be grouped in two superpathways (Figure
1). The first superpathway, involving carbamoyl-phosphate
and N-acetyl-L-citrulline, can proceed via two alternolog
branches: the first branch is the canonical E. coli pathway,
catalyzed by two widely distributed enzymes, carbamoyl
phosphate synthetase (EC:6.3.5.5) and ornithine carbamoyltransferase (EC:2.1.3.3). The second branch uses three
enzymes (EC:6.3.4.16, EC:2.1.39 and EC:3.5.1.16), of which
two are also widely distributed (Figure 2). Interestingly,
EC:6.3.5.5 and EC:6.3.4.16 enzymes are paralogs, and
EC:2.1.3.3 and EC: 2.1.39 are paralogs as well (Figure 3), representing an event of retention of duplicated genes as groups,
instead of single entities. The retention of groups of duplicates has been suggested to play a significant role in the evolution of metabolism [16]. Alternatively, the second
superpathway occurring via N-acetyl-L-ornithine is also
widely distributed across the three domains, with the exception of animals, and shows three interesting TDs. First, using
the E. coli enzymes as seeds for BRHs in this superpathway,
we detected a small amount of orthologs in some clades, but
using the ortholog sequences from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and Bacillus subtilis,
the gaps were filled in their respective phylogenetic groups
(yellow squares in Figure 2), showing the importance of using
enzymes from multiple species as queries instead of the simpler E. coli-centric strategies. Second, there are two analog Nacetylglutamate synthases (EC:2.3.1.1). The E. coli-type is a
monomeric monofunctional enzyme, while the B. subtilistype is a heterodimeric bifunctional enzyme (EC:2.3.1.1/
2.3.1.35) whose constituents are proteolytically self-processed from a single precursor protein. Both types of enzymes

Volume 9, Issue 6, Article R95

Hernández-Montes et al. R95.3

are widely distributed across the three domains (Figure 2),
although the E. coli-type was not identified in firmicutes, suggesting its displacement by the B. subtilis-type. Third,
another retention of duplicated genes as groups, instead of as
single entities, occurs between three consecutive steps in the
biosynthesis of L-arginine/L-lysine [22]: EC:2.7.2.8/
EC:2.7.2.4, EC:1.2.1.38/EC:1.2.1.11, EC:2.6.1.11/EC:2.6.1.17
and EC:3.5.1.16/EC:3.5.1.18 (Figure 3). In summary, we propose that not all pathways to synthesize L-arginine occurred
in the LCA, only those proceeding via N-acetyl-L-ornithine
and citrulline.

L-glycine
There are four branches to synthesize L-glycine. Two of them,
involving the degradation of L-threonine (Figure 1), are partially distributed in Bacteria and Eukarya (Figure 2). In contrast, the other two branches, interconnected through 5,10methylene-tetrahydrofolate, involve either the glycine-cleavage system or serine hydroxymethyltransferase (EC:2.1.2.1).
Both branches are widely distributed across the three cellular
domains (Figure 2). Indeed, EC:2.1.2.1 is one of the most
widely distributed enzymes across all the species, probably as
it also participates in folate biosynthesis, another broadly distributed pathway. Collectively, the distribution of these
enzymes suggests that the LCA synthesized glycine via the
branch of 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate.

L-tryptophan
We found the five L-tryptophan biosynthetic enzymes widely
distributed across the three domains of life, confirming previous reports [27]. Nevertheless, we did not identify orthologs
for these enzymes in animals (Figure 2), with the exception of
Nematostella vectensis, a cnidaria representative of early
stages in animal evolution [28]. This indicates that some animals had a secondary loss of the L-tryptophan biosynthetic
enzymes and also explains why this amino acid is essential for
humans. Thus, the LCA probably was able to synthesize Ltryptophan in a similar fashion to contemporary species.

L-proline
There are at least six L-proline biosynthetic branches (Figure
1). Three of them converge in L-glutamate γ-semialdehyde
and, judging from their TDs, ornithine-δ-aminotransferase
(EC:2.6.1.13) is the most widely distributed enzyme within
this pathway, even in some archaeal genomes (Figure 2). The
other two branches have been biochemically characterized,
although their catalyzing enzymes are unknown. The sixth
branch, which directly converts L-ornithine to L-proline via
ornithine cyclodeaminase (EC:4.3.1.12), was found in some
Archaea and scarcely in Bacteria and Eukarya (Figure 2). Further analyses are necessary to corroborate experimentally the
activities of these archaeal open reading frames, because the
putative EC:2.6.1.13 enzymes do not have the canonical catalytic residues involved in this activity, and little information is
known about the EC:4.3.1.12 activity. Thus, the archaeal
biosynthesis of L-proline remains enigmatic and makes it

difficult to infer if the LCA was capable of synthesizing L-proline.

L-leucine
The biosynthesis of L-leucine consists of five reactions following a mainly linear pathway (Figure 1). Using the E. coli and
M. jannaschii sequences for BRHs, we detected that putative
enzymes catalyzing the first three reactions are widely distributed (Figure 2). These three enzymes belong to a group of
duplicated genes catalyzing consecutive steps in the biosynthesis of three amino acids, L-lysine, L-leucine and L-isoleucine (Figure 3). The evolutionary relationships between Llysine and L-leucine biosynthesis have been documented previously [23,24,29]: we found that L-isoleucine biosynthesis is
also implied in this phenomenon. These duplicates together
with those from L-arginine/L-lysine biosynthesis support our
previous report on the importance of the retention of duplicated genes as groups, instead of as single entities, in the evolution of metabolism [16]. The fourth reaction occurs
spontaneously and does not require a catalyzing enzyme.
Complementarily, the fifth step in E. coli is catalyzed by one
out of the two analog branched-chain amino acid transferases
(EC:2.6.1.42); one of them belongs to the D-amino acid aminotransferase-like PLP-dependent superfamily and is widely
distributed across the three domains, including some animals. In contrast, the second EC:2.6.1.42 belongs to the PLPdependent transferases superfamily and is sparsely distributed across genomes. Collectively, these observations suggest
that the LCA was able to synthesize L-leucine-like contemporary species. Further biochemical characterization of animal
open reading frames is necessary, as L-leucine is an essential
amino acid for humans.

L-histidine
Structurally speaking, L-histidine and L-tryptophan biosynthesis are similar; both are mainly linear pathways diverging
from anthranilate using EC:2.4.2.18 (Figure 1) and, given
their wide distribution, they have been proposed to be ancient
pathways. The L-histidine biosynthesis enzyme histidinolphosphatase (EC:3.1.3.15) is the only enzyme from this pathway partially distributed across genomes (Figure 2). This is
probably due to the existence of two analog EC:3.1.3.15
enzymes (S. cerevisiae- and E. coli-types). Both types are
highly divergent in sequence, and when we relaxed the stringency of BRH analysis (increasing the threshold E-value from
10-6 to 10-1), we detected orthologs in 84% and 40% of the
analyzed genomes for the S. cerevisiae and E. coli types,
respectively. The other enzymes analyzed in this study are not
affected by the stringency of BRHs. Additionally, we found
that animals, with the exception of N. vectensis, have experienced a secondary loss of the L-histidine biosynthetic
machinery (Figure 2). Taking these results together, we suggest that the LCA had the same L-histidine synthesis pathway
as extant species.

Volume 9, Issue 6, Article R95

Hernández-Montes et al. R95.5

L-threonine
Two out of the three L-threonine biosynthetic enzymes from
E. coli were found across the three domains. We did not find
any orthologs in Archaea when we performed a genome scan
with the E. coli threonine synthase (EC:4.2.3.1) as seed. Alternatively, when we used as seed an M. jannaschii paralog with
the same function, we identified orthologs in Archaea (Figure
2). Again, this finding reinforces the importance of using
enzymes from multiple species as seeds. Some animals apparently lost the biosynthetic machinery for this amino acid, but
N. vectensis retained it. We suggest that the LCA could synthesize L-threonine like contemporary species.

L-glutamine and L-glutamate
As depicted in Figure 1, the inter-conversion of L-glutamine
and L-glutamate can be performed by many alternolog
enzymes. Both paralog glutamate synthases, the NADH
dependent (EC:1.4.1.14) and the NADPH dependent
(EC:1.4.1.13), produce L-glutamate from L-glutamine, and
are widely distributed across the three domains (Figure 2). In
the reverse direction, from L-glutamate to L-glutamine, we
found that glutamine synthetase (EC:6.3.1.2), which is ATP
dependent, is also widely distributed across the three
domains. This suggests that the LCA was able to inter-convert
L-glutamine and L-glutamate. But it leaves one open question: was the LCA capable of producing these amino acids
independently of each other? Similarly to glutamate synthases, both paralog glutamate dehydrogenases, the
NAD(P)+-dependent (EC:1.4.1.3) and the NADP+-dependent
(EC:1.4.1.4) enzymes, produce L-glutamate from 2-oxoglutarate and ammonia, and are also widely distributed across the
three domains. On the other hand, all other reactions synthesizing L-glutamine use L-glutamate as substrate and are
sparsely distributed. In summary, we suggest that the LCA
was able to synthesize L-glutamate from 2-oxoglutarate and
inter-convert it with L-glutamine, but it is difficult to determine if the LCA was able to produce this last amino acid independently of the former one.

L-cysteine
There are at least four ways to synthesize L-cysteine (Figure
1). The most widely distributed, proceeding via cystathionine,
uses cystathionine β-synthase (EC:4.2.1.22) and cystathionine γ-lyase (EC:4.4.1.1) and is documented as being eukaryotic-type, yet we found it distributed across the three domains
(Figure 2). Alternatively, cystathionine-β-lyase (EC:4.4.1.8),
cystathionine γ-synthase (EC:2.5.1.-) and O-succinylhomoserine(thiol)-lyase (EC:2.5.1.48) catalyze equivalent reactions
and they are widely distributed in Bacteria and Eukarya. In
contrast, an alternolog branch using EC:2.5.1.47 via O-acetylL-serine is sparsely distributed across genomes (Figure 2),
while another branch without assigned enzymes (nor genes)
uses O-acetyl-L-homoserine. These findings suggest that not
all the L-cysteine biosynthetic pathways occurred in the LCA,
but that the contemporary eukaryotic-like type could.

Eight amino acid biosynthetic pathways are partially
distributed across the three domains of life, and five of
their branches probably occurred in the LCA
L-lysine
L-lysine biosynthesis has been used largely to exemplify the
existence of alternolog branches in amino acid biosynthesis
[21-23]. Six alternative pathways can be recognized for the
biosynthesis of L-lysine (Figure 1), grouped in two superpathways proceeding via either L,L-diaminopimelate or alphaaminoadipate. The superpathway involving L,L-diaminopimelate has four alternolog branches, corresponding to Llysine biosynthesis types I, II, III and VI in MetaCyc; they
share a common set of six reactions catalyzed by widely
distributed enzymes. Four of these enzymes catalyze the
upper steps of the superpathway, from aspartate kinase
(EC:2.7.2.4) to dihydrodipicolinate reductase (EC:1.3.1.26),
and form the pairs of duplicated genes between the biosynthesis of L-arginine/L-lysine (Figure 3). The other two
enzymes (EC:5.1.17 and EC:4.1.120) catalyze the lower portion of the superpathway. The TDs of enzymes catalyzing
intermediate steps in these alternologs are as follow. In the
type I pathway (E. coli-type), which is catalyzed by three
enzymes, only N-succinyl-L,L-diaminopimelate desuccinylase (EC:3.5.1.18) is widely distributed across the three
domains. In the type II pathway (B. subtilis-type), catalyzed
by the other three enzymes, only tetrahydrodipicolinate
acetyltransferase (EC:2.3.1.89) is widely distributed in Bacteria, while it is absent in Archaea and Eukarya. The type III
pathway of Corynebacterium glutamicum (EC:1.4.1.16)
appears constrained to some actinobacteria and firmicutes,
while the recently discovered type VI pathway, formed by a
single enzyme, namely L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase (EC:2.6.1.-), seems to be specific for plants. These
results illustrate a general finding of this work: linear pathways seem to be more widely distributed than bifurcating
ones. As described above, L-histidine, L-tryptophan and Lleucine pathways support this observation, and correlate with
previous studies showing that within amino acid biosynthesis, larger pathways tend to have lower rates of change in their
structure than shorter pathways [31]. However, further studies on whole metabolic networks are necessary to assess the
generality of this property in the evolution of metabolism. On

the other hand, the second superpathway, proceeding via the
degradation of alpha-aminoadipate, is formed by lineage specific type IV and V pathways that share a core of five reactions
from homocitrate synthase (EC:2.3.3.14) to α-aminoadipate
aminotransferase (EC:2.6.1.39). This core contains the four
enzymes forming pairs of duplicated genes between the biosynthesis of L-leucine/L-lysine (Figure 3). The type V pathway, using N-2-acetyl-L-lysine (RXN-5181 to RXN-5185), was
characterized in the Thermus-Deinocuccus lineage, and its
representatives were found in Archaea and some Bacteria,
while the type IV pathway, proceeding via saccharopine
(EC:1.2.1.31 to EC:1.5.1.7), appears restricted to Eukarya and
some Bacteria. Collectively, the TDs of these two superpathways show that alternative pathways have led the origin of the
biosynthesis of L-lysine. None of these alternologs appears to
be universally distributed and, thus, the LCA probably was
not able to produce L-lysine using the set of enzymes analyzed
here. Interestingly, both L-lysine biosynthetic superpathways
retain groups of duplicated genes for the biosynthesis of Lleucine and L-arginine (Figure 3), which, as detailed above,
probably occurred in the LCA. Thus, there is a possibility that
L-lysine biosynthesis was incorporated into metabolism from
L-leucine and L-arginine biosynthetic routes.

L-methionine
The biosynthesis of L-methionine can be carried out by at
least three different superpathways (Figure 1). One involves
the degradation of cystathionine via homocysteine using
either cystathionine β-synthase (EC:4.2.1.22) or cystathionine β-lyase (EC:4.4.1.8), followed by methionine synthase
(EC:2.1.1.13). These three enzymes are widely distributed
across the three domains (Figure 4) and, hence, this branch
could occur in the LCA. Alternatively, the second superpathway, also called the L-methionine salvage cycle, which begins
with EC:4.4.1.14 via S-adenosyl-L-methionine and finishes in
L-methionine using EC:2.6.1.5 via 2-oxo-4-methylthiobutanoate (Figure 1), is widely distributed in Eukarya but almost
absent in Archaea and Bacteria. An exception to this distribution is the step from L-methionine to S-adenosyl-L-methionine, which can be catalyzed by one of two analog methionine
adenosyltransferases (EC:2.5.1.6). These analogs show an
almost perfect anti-correlation in their TDs (Figure 4); one is

Average taxonomic distribution of amino acid biosynthetic enzymes widely distributed across the three domains of life
Average taxonomic distribution of amino acid biosynthetic enzymes widely distributed across the three domains of life. The TDs for enzymes catalyzing
the amino acid biosynthetic pathways (vertical labels) were computed by searching for their ortholog distribution across diverse taxonomic groups
(horizontal labels). The plot shows enzymes with an average normalized distribution ≥ 50% (see Materials and methods). Amino acid three letter codes in
red denote amino acids whose biosynthesis probably occurred in the LCA (detailed in the main text). Four types of seeds were used to look for TDs: the
canonical E. coli enzymes (gray scale); homolog enzymes - paralogs and orthologs - from other species showing a higher distribution than E. coli
counterparts (yellow scale); analog enzymes - catalyzing the same reaction and coming from a different structural superfamily - (red scale); and alternolog
enzymes and branches - converging in the same end compound, but proceeding via different metabolites - in other species (blue scale). In the vertical
labels, subunits of multimeric enzymes are denoted with 'S', analog enzyme machinery is denoted with 'A' and isoenzymes are denoted with 'I'. For
example, the annotation 'EC:3.5.1.1(Eco_Ans-AnsB)(A:1/2-I:1/2)' indicates that there are two analog EC:3.5.1.1 enzymes and this annotation corresponds
to the first type (A:1/2). In turn, this type has two isoenzymes and this annotation corresponds to the first one (I:1/2), formed by AnsA and AnsB proteins
in E. coli. The average distribution of orthologs for each route is shown in parentheses following amino acid three letter codes. Biosynthetic enzymes for
each amino acid were sorted as they appear downstream in the metabolic flux.

restricted to Archaea, while the other occurs in Bacteria and
Eukarya. Complementarily, a third superpathway, characterized in plants as the so-called S-adenosyl-L-methionine cycle,
converts S-adenosyl-L-methionine to L-methionine via Sadenosyl-L-homocysteine (Figure 1). We found that one of
this cycle's enzymes, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase
(EC:3.3.1.1), is widely distributed across the three domains.
In summary, we suggest that the LCA was able to produce Lmethionine, degrading cysthationine via homocysteine.

L-valine and L-isoleucine
The terminal four steps in the biosynthesis of L-valine and Lisoleucine employ a common set of widely distributed
enzymes, from EC:2.2.1.6 to branched-chain amino-acid aminotransferase (EC:2.6.1.42) (Figure 4). This set was not
found, however, in animals, again with the exception of N.
vectensis. Complementarily, five alternolog branches can catalyze the initial steps of L-isoleucine biosynthesis, converging

in 2-oxobutanoate, which is, in turn, a substrate of acetolactate synthase (EC:2.2.1.6) (Figure 1). We found that the
canonical E. coli branch carrying out these steps via propionate uses EC:2.7.2.15 and EC:2.3.1.8 and is sparingly distributed among bacterial genomes. In contrast, the alternolog
branch characterized in spirochaetes, proceeding via (R)-citramalate (Figure 1), uses isopropylmalate isomerase
(EC:4.2.1.35) and β-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (no EC
number assigned), and both enzymes are widely distributed
across the three domains (Figure 4). These results clearly
exemplify that the E. coli canonical pathways are not necessarily the most widely distributed ones and, thus, alternolog
pathways must be included in evolutionary analysis. Additionally, this branch participates in the retention of a group of
duplicated genes catalyzing consecutive reactions in the biosynthesis of L-lysine, L-leucine and L-isoleucine (Figure 3).
Taking together the wide distribution of the spirochaetes-like
branch and the enzymes shared between L-valine and L-iso-

leucine biosynthesis, we suggest that the LCA and even contemporary species could combine these branches to
synthesize both amino acids.

Chorismate
Chorismate is not an amino acid itself, but it is a key compound in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids and we
consider the distribution of their catalyzing enzymes particularly interesting. The biosynthesis of chorismate comprises
seven steps, the last two being catalyzed by two widely distributed enzymes, 3-phosphoshikimate-1-carboxyvinyltransferase (EC:2.5.1.9) and chorismate synthase (EC:4.2.3.5).
Complementarily, the first two steps are catalyzed by
enzymes widely distributed in Bacteria and some Eukarya,
but absent in Archaea. A recent report suggesting a novel
pathway for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids and paminobenzoic acid in the archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis helps to understand this distribution [32]. Additionally, three intermediate steps are catalyzed by scarcely
distributed analog and alternolog enzymes as follows. First,
the transformation of 3-dehydroquinate to 3-dehydro-shikimate can be catalyzed by two analog 3-dehydroquinate dehydratases (EC:4.2.1.10). B. subtilis possesses both analogs,
while Archaea, some Eukarya and a few Bacteria carry only
the type II enzyme (Figure 4) belonging to the aldolase (TIMbarrel) superfamily. In contrast, the majority of Bacteria,
including E. coli, uses the type I enzyme (Figure 4) belonging
to the 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase superfamily. Second, in
E. coli there are two paralogs catalyzing the conversion of 3dehydro-shikimate to shikimate. One of them, NADP+dependent EC:1.1.1.25, is widely distributed, while
EC:1.1.1.282 (using either NAD+ or NADP+, and either quinate or shikimate) is sparsely distributed. In contrast, B. subtilis has only the NADP+-dependent shikimate dehydrogenase
and, when its sequence is used as a seed for BRHs, we found
more orthologs than with the E. coli counterparts (Figure 4).
This finding is probably caused by cross-matches between the
E. coli paralogs during the construction of TDs. Third, the
transformation of shikimate to shikimate-3-phosphate can be
catalyzed by two analog shikimate kinases (EC:2.7.1.71). The
archaeal-type belongs to the GHMP kinase superfamily, while
the bacterial/eukaryotic-type belongs to the superfamily of Ploop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases. Interestingly, there is an almost perfect anti-correlation between the
TDs of these enzymes (Figure 4). Animals, including N. vectensis, have lost all enzymes catalyzing intermediate steps in
chorismate biosynthesis, supporting the fact that aromatic
amino acids (L-histidine, L-trypthopan, L-phenylalanine,
and L-tyrosine) are essential for humans. Summarizing, we
found that the lower portion of chorismate biosynthesis, converting 3-dehydro-shikimate to chorismate, is widely distributed across the three domains, suggesting that it probably
occurred in the LCA. In contrast, the upper and intermediate
portions of this route appear to have originated independently in specific lineages during evolution.

L-aspartate and L-asparagine
The biosynthesis and inter-conversion of L-aspartate and Lasparagine are mediated by a diverse set of alternolog
enzymes (Figure 1), most of which have been characterized in
E. coli and are sparsely distributed. Nevertheless, aspartate
aminotransferase (EC:2.6.1.1) and pyruvate carboxylase
(EC:6.4.1.1) are able to produce L-aspartate from pyruvate,
via oxaloacetate, and both enzymes are widely distributed
across the three domains (Figure 4). Complementarily, the
conversion of L-aspartate to L-asparagine can be carried out
by three asparagine synthetases, two of which are glutamine
dependent (EC:6.3.5.4) while the other is ammonia dependent (EC:6.3.1.1). Both EC:6.3.1.1 type 1 and EC:6.3.5.4 belong
to the adenine nucleotide alpha hydrolases-like superfamily
and are widely distributed across the three domains (Figure
4). In contrast, the production of L-aspartate and L-asparagine via 3-cyano-L-alanine, which is mediated by β-cyano-Lalanine-synthase (EC:4.4.1.9) and two paralog nitrilases
(EC:3.5.5.1), appears to be restricted to plants, cyanobacteria
and α-proteobacteria (Figure 4). This distribution could be
the product of horizontal gene transfer among these clades,
probably by symbiosis - as some α-proteobacteria are symbionts and parasites of plants - or by endosymbiosis - because
cyanobacteria are considered descendants of plastid ancestors in plants. We did not detect any other possible horizontal
gene transfer events in these routes using a database of putative horizontally transferred genes in prokaryotic complete
genomes [33]. Finally, the two analog asparaginases
(EC:3.5.1.1), converting L-asparagine to L-aspartate, show
anti-correlated TDs. One of them, from the glutaminase/
asparaginase superfamily, was found in Archaea, some Bacteria, Fungi and Animals (Figure 4), while the second one, from
the superfamily of amino-terminal nucleophile aminohydrolases shows a distribution similar to that of EC:4.4.1.9 and
EC:3.5.5.1. In summary, the LCA probably was not able to
produce either L-aspartate or L-asparagine via the modern
canonical alternologs (nitrilase and asparaginase), but could
via the degradation of oxaloacetate using the branches
described above.

L-tyrosine and L-phenylalanine
There are at least five branches diverging from prephenate for
the biosynthesis of L-tyrosine and L-phenylalanine. Two of
them proceed via phenylpyruvate and use one of the two
widely distributed analog prephenate dehydratases
(EC:4.2.1.51). Another two branches proceed via L-arogenate
and use either arogenate dehydrogenase (EC:1.3.1.43) to synthesize L-tyrosine or arogenate dehydratase (EC:4.2.1.91) to
synthesize L-phenylalanine. EC:1.3.1.43 occurs in Bacteria
and some Archaea, while EC 4.2.1.91 has no assigned enzyme
(nor gene) sequences. The fifth branch uses prephenate dehydrogenase (EC:1.3.1.12) followed by an aromatic-amino acid
aminotransferase (EC:2.6.1.57). E. coli, B. subtilis and S. cerevisiae have two EC:2.6.1.57 and all of them can be classified
in the PLP-dependent transferase superfamily, with the
exception of AroJ in B. subtilis, whose sequence is unknown.

However, it is difficult to establish orthology relationships
between these enzymes because none of them are BRHs and,
thus, are putatively paralogs. Apparently, this high diversity
is maintained by differential expression and multifunctional
properties of these enzymes. For instance, TyrB in E. coli is
approximately 1,000-fold more active on aromatic substrates
than its paralog AspC, which is more specific for aspartate.
Similarly, in B. subtilis, HisC is more active than AroJ on phenylalanine and tyrosine, in spite of its primary activity on histidinol-phosphate, and S. cerevisiae uses Aro8 preferentially
in anabolism and Aro9 in catabolism [34,35]. HisC could represent one of the most ancestral lineages in this family
because it is the only member widely distributed across the
three domains. This agrees with the fact that biosynthesis of
L-histidine, the pathway in which HisC preferentially participates, is proposed to be ancestral (see above). The wide distribution of HisC and two analog EC:4.2.1.51 enzymes suggests
that the biosynthesis of phenylalanine and tyrosine is also
ancient. Nevertheless, the step preceding these enzymes,
from chorismate to prephenate, can be catalyzed by one of the
two analog chorismate mutases (EC:5.4.99.5); these show a
sparse distribution, with some representatives in firmicutes,
proteobacteria and plants. For instance, E. coli possesses two
paralog EC:5.4.99.5 enzymes belonging to the chorismate
mutase II superfamily and they are fused to domains catalyzing EC:1.3.1.12 and EC:4.2.1.51 activities, while B. subtilis also
has two EC:5.4.99.5 enzymes, one from the chorismate
mutase II superfamily and the other from the YjgF-like superfamily. Neither of these EC:5.4.99.5 domains is widely distributed; thus, it is difficult to establish whether the LCA was
able to synthesize L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine.

L-alanine
There are four alternolog single steps to synthesize L-alanine
(Figure 1). One of them uses cysteine desulfurase (EC:2.8.1.7)
to degrade L-cysteine and is widely distributed across the
three domains. Given that L-cysteine biosynthesis probably
occurred in the LCA (see above), we suggest that biosynthesis
of L-alanine could occur in the LCA via this step. In contrast,
alanine racemase (EC:5.1.1.1) isomerizes D-alanine to Lalanine and is constrained to Bacteria. Alanine aminotransferase (EC:2.6.1.2) converts L-glutamate and pyruvate to Lalanine and is widely distributed in Eukarya but poorly represented in Bacteria and Archaea, whereas valine-pyruvate
aminotransferase (EC:2.6.1.66) degrades L-valine to Lalanine and was detected only in few Bacteria (Figure 4).

Volume 9, Issue 6, Article R95

Hernández-Montes et al. R95.11

ine ammonia-lyase (EC:4.3.1.17), and is restricted to some
Bacteria. The third and fourth branches are closely related to
the biosynthesis of L-cysteine and L-methionine, inter-converting cystathionine and homocysteine by either EC:4.2.1.22
or EC:4.4.1.8, which are widely distributed across the three
domains (see above). Given that L-cysteine and L-methionine
could exist in the LCA, the biosynthesis of L-serine could also
exist via these enzymes. In fact, this chain of widely distributed enzymes can be extended to the biosynthesis of Lalanine (Figure 1), and all of them together constitute the
larger succession of reactions that probably existed in the
LCA.
In summary, our results have uncovered a set of 64 enzyme
domains participating in the biosynthesis of at least 16 out of
the 20 proteinogenic amino acids that tentatively occurred in
the LCA. Figure 5 shows a marked bias in the taxonomic distribution of this set of domains with respect to the general
trend for the whole metabolism and other less conserved
parts of amino acid biosynthesis, suggesting that branches in
other metabolic processes could also posses a hidden
universality.

Conclusion

We have carried out a comprehensive analysis of the origin
and evolution of amino acid biosynthesis. Our strategy combines genomic tools with a network perspective to identify a
core of widely distributed enzymes that probably occurred in
the LCA, synthesizing at least 16 out of the 20 standard amino
acids. This proposal does not imply, however, that the full
biosynthetic routes for these 16 amino acids appeared early,
but only some of their branches that could satisfy the minimal
biochemical and structural requirements. It is important to
note that some species such as parasites and free living animals, including mammals, can lack significant portions of
this 'universal' set because they can import amino acids from
their hosts or include it in their diet. In parasites, these
absences have been attributed to secondary loss. Our results
show that most basal animal lineages and other Eukarya posses these universal branches and, thus, their absence in the
animal kingdom apparently is also due to secondary losses.
Further studies on the possible occurrence of the remaining
four standard amino acid biosynthetic routes - for L-proline,
L-lysine, L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine - are necessary as
some portions of these pathways are also widely distributed
and some 'lost' reactions could fill the gaps.

L-serine
Finally, there are four proficient branches to synthesize L-serine. The first, proceeding via 3-phospho-hydroxypyruvate, is
catalyzed by three enzymes, two of them, 3-phosphoglycerate
dehydrogenase (EC:1.1.1.95) and 3-phosphoserine phosphatase (EC:3.1.3.3) are widely distributed, but the third,
phosphoserine aminotransferase (EC:2.6.1.52) is restricted to
Eukarya and some Bacteria. The second branch is a single
step converting ammonia and pyruvate to L-serine by L-ser-

One of the major biological roles of amino acids is that they
are protein constituents; thus, an emerging question from our
results is whether this core of amino acids could be sufficient
for the LCA protein repertoire? Recently, Atchley et al. [36],
grouped amino acids according to almost 500 attributes,
ranging from structural to biochemical and biophysical properties, producing a multidimensional representation of
amino acid variability. Mapping the putative core of 16

perspectives. The general trend in the whole of metabolism (MetaCyc), using a manually depurated set of enzyme domains, is also shown. The 16 amino
acid biosynthesis universal branches show a maximum of around 45% of reactions (y-axis) in 70% of sampled genomes (x-axis) when all MetaCyc enzymes
have a maximum of 24% of reactions in only 10% of genomes.

ancient amino acid biosynthetic branches onto the Atchley et
al. plot (Figure 1 in Ref. [36]) suggests that the LCA was able
to populate all the regions of amino acid variability space, so
this core could be sufficient for protein functions in early biosystems. Most of the universal branches found in this work
are connected to each other (Figure 1), allowing the possibility that they feedback and complete a minimal set of enzymedriven reactions for the biosynthesis of amino acids. Interplay
between the variability and selective pressures resulting from
increasing genome sizes and protein structure complexity
could promote the incorporation of novel amino acids to this
core.
Additionally, we identified alternative branches and routes
(paralogs, analogs and alternologs) reflecting the adoption of
specific amino acid biosynthetic strategies by taxa, probably
due to differences in their life-styles. Eleven out of the twenty
amino acid biosynthetic routes revealed an important contribution of paralogy to the generation of diversity. In particular,
we corroborated that the retention of gene duplicates as

groups, instead of as single entities, is an important factor in
the evolution of metabolism. Furthermore, analog enzymes
contribute in eight out of the twenty standard amino acid biosynthetic routes, while alternolog routes participate in nine.
This implies that analog enzymes and alternolog branches
contribute almost as much as gene duplication to genetic
buffering in the biosynthesis of amino acids. Further studies
are necessary to determine the generality of these observations and to complement them with observations from alternative reactions modeling fluxes in metabolism [37]. In
conclusion, we suggest that despite a core of amino acid biosynthetic branches being inherited from ancient systems, the
whole contemporary repertoire has been originated independently by lineages according to their environmental
resources as reflected by the high diversity of anabolic
branches.
In this sense, we consider that one of the goals of the two step
strategy presented here (E. coli and multi-organismal TD
seeds) is that it uses not only a traditional model organism for

genomic analyses, but also as many species as available in
current databases. This is important because 8 out of the 20
amino acid biosynthetic routes (L-cysteine, L-serine, Lalanine, L-isoleucine, L-arginine, L-aspartate, L-proline and
L-methionine) were quite sparingly distributed from an E.
coli-centric perspective, but widely distributed when adding
the orthologs, paralogs, analogs and alternologs from other
species, revealing the universal nature of some of these
routes. Further studies are necessary to determine the generality of these findings, not only in metabolic networks but also
in other biological processes.

Materials and methods
Network reconstruction
In bipartite metabolic networks, there are two sets of nodes enzymes and compounds (substrates, products and cofactors) - and edges relating enzymes with compounds occurring
in the same reaction. For instance, if reaction R1 consumes
compound C1 and produces C2 and C3, and it is catalyzed by
enzyme E1, the following edges are established: C1 → E1, E1
→ C2, and E1 → C3. In reversible reactions a second group of
links from products to enzymes and, in turn, from enzymes to
substrates is added. In this work we reconstructed the bipartite networks derived from three metabolic databases: EcoCyc
v8.0 [8] for E. coli, MjCyc [10] for M. jannaschii and MetaCyc
v8.0 [9] for multi-organismal assignments. To obtain information concerning the nodes and edges for each reaction, we
used the following files from EcoCyc and MetaCyc: reactions.dat (substrate/product), enzrxns.dat (reversibility) and
reaction-links.dat (EC numbers). From MjCyc the corresponding information was retrieved manually from the database's web page. Networks derived from these databases were
merged and prepared for presentation with Cytoscape v2.5.2
[38]. Amino acids were highlighted (red triangles in Figure 1)
to denote terminal points of pathways and branches into this
network. For clarity in presentation, the most highly connected compounds (mainly cofactors) and the terminal nonamino acid metabolites were removed from the network.
Additional data file 2 lists these compounds and contains the
pairs of nodes used to construct Figure 1. Multifunctional
enzyme sequences were split manually according to their
functional domain assignments from Swiss-Prot [39]. Thus,
in Figure 1 each node represents one reaction catalyzed by a
functional domain (or domains in multimeric enzymes). Analogue enzymes - those catalyzing the same reaction but possessing different folds - were detected by comparing the
structural domain content among proteins according to the
Superfamily database v1. 69 [40] using HMMer [41]. Additional data file 2 contains details for the final set of 537
enzyme functional domains analyzed in this work as well as
32 reactions without known gene/enzymes. Alternologs were
detected by manual inspection of the network in Figure 1,
looking for branches that, proceeding via different metabolites, converge in a given compound, generally in an amino
acid.

Taxonomic distribution
Amino acid sequences from 537 enzymes (functional
domains) were tracked in completely sequenced genomes
using BLASTP (cutoff E-value = 10-20, and identity percentage >95), this was carried out to obtain the corresponding
genomic sequences used as seeds for ortholog detection.
Sixty-nine enzymes were excluded because they do not have
assigned enzyme (gene) sequences (Additional data file 2).
Each genomic sequence seed was used for ortholog detection
across 410 non-obligate parasitic genomes (30 Archaea, 363
Bacteria and 17 Eukarya) representing 297 species from 192
genera (Additional data file 2), following the BRH criterion
using BLASTP with a cut E-value of 10-5, and a minimum
alignment coverage for query and/or subject sequence ≥ 50%.
Genomes with less than 1,500 predicted open reading frames
(mainly from obligate parasitic genomes) were eliminated
from this analysis because they have experienced extensive
secondary loses of anabolic enzymes in their genomes, which
could introduce noise in TDs. Sequences in the same genome
with >95% identity estimated with CD-HIT [42] were
grouped into clusters. As reported [43], this procedure
reduces the frequency of false-negative results caused by
cross-matches between highly similar sequences within a
genome. Given the redundancy of sequenced strains for some
bacterial species, we systematically depurated the original set
of genomes, attempting to obtain a normalized measure of
ortholog distribution according to the following steps. In step
1, a TD of enzymes versus species was constructed assigning a
value of1 to enzymes with orthologs (BRHs) in ≥ 50% of
strains from each species. Otherwise a value of 0 was assigned
to the corresponding bit. In step 2, a TD of enzymes versus
genera was constructed. In this TD, each vector represents
the percentage of species having a value of 1 (assigned in step
1) for each genus. In step 3, a TD of enzymes versus clades was
constructed. In this TD each vector represents an average of
the genera percentages obtained in step 2, for each clade.
Clades correspond to the taxonomic categories from the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [7]. This
procedure provides a 'normalized average distribution' of
enzymes across genomes. The final set of strains and genera
for each clade is shown in Additional data file 2.
