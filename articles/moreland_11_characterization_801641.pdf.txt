Abstract
Background: Human killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) play a critical role in governing the immune
response to neoplastic and infectious disease. Rhesus macaques serve as important animal models for many
human diseases in which KIRs are implicated; however, the study of KIR activity in this model is hindered by
incomplete characterization of KIR genetics.
Results: Here we present a characterization of KIR genetics in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). We conducted a
survey of KIRs in this species, identifying 47 novel full-length KIR sequences. Using this expanded sequence library
to build upon previous work, we present evidence supporting the existence of 22 Mamu-KIR genes, providing a
framework within which to describe macaque KIRs. We also developed a novel pyrosequencing-based technique
for KIR genotyping. This method provides both comprehensive KIR genotype and frequency estimates of transcript
level, with implications for the study of KIRs in all species.
Conclusions: The results of this study significantly improve our understanding of macaque KIR genetic
organization and diversity, with implications for the study of many human diseases that use macaques as a model.
The ability to obtain comprehensive KIR genotypes is of basic importance for the study of KIRs, and can easily be
adapted to other species. Together these findings both advance the field of macaque KIRs and facilitate future
research into the role of KIRs in human disease.

Background
Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are a highly
polymorphic family of cell surface receptors expressed
on natural killer (NK) cells and a subset of T-lymphocytes [1-3]. KIR mediated signaling plays a key role in
the identification of foreign cells and the antiviral
response [4-9]. The best characterized KIR ligands are
major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules, although ligands have not been identified for all
KIRs [10,11]. Because both KIRs and MHC-I are highly
polymorphic, host genotype plays an important role in
KIR function.
KIR genetic diversity can be described in terms of
polymorphism and polygenicity. To date, there are 15

KIR genes described in humans [12]. The number of
KIR genes varies between individuals, with 7-12 genes
per haplotype [13,14]. Because the protein product of
each KIR gene generally binds a unique set of ligands,
the subset of KIRs encoded by an individual dictates the
potential KIR interactions that can occur. In addition to
variation in gene content between haplotypes, there is
allelic polymorphism within each KIR gene [13]. Broadly
speaking, the allotypic variants encoded by a KIR gene
bind the same subset of MHC-I ligands, although exceptions do exist [15]. Distinct KIR allotypes can have differing binding affinities for particular MHC-I allotypes.
These differences in KIR/MHC-I binding affinity can
alter KIR signaling and NK cell activity [16]. In addition
to KIR genotype, MHC-I genotype must be considered
since it determines the set of available KIR ligands and
since it is possible to express a KIR with or without its
cognate MHC-I molecule [10,17].

Specific KIR/MHC-I genotypes have been implicated
as a factor contributing to the immune control of multiple human diseases including hepatitis C virus, human
papilloma virus, malaria, and human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) [6-9,18]. One of the best-studied examples
of KIR/MHC-I genetics and disease is that of KIR3DL1/
KIR3DS1 and HLA-Bw4 in HIV infection. Individuals
who express specific KIR3DL1/KIR3DS1 alleles in combination with certain HLA-B alleles containing the Bw4
motif show slower progression to AIDS [8,9]. This
genetic association has more recently been supported by
functional data demonstrating that NK cells expressing
KIR3DS1 have increased anti-HIV activity against target
cells expressing HLA-Bw4, although the underlying
mechanism remains to be elucidated [19].
Despite advances in our understanding of KIR biology,
the mechanisms through which specific KIR/MHC-I
combinations influence disease progression are not fully
understood. This is at least partially due to the complexity of KIR/MHC-I genotypes and difficulty in identifying
KIR/MHC-I matched cohorts. Rhesus macaques
(Macaca mulatta) are an established and widely used
experimental model system for many human diseases,
including immunodeficiency virus [20]. The advantages
of studying infectious disease in rhesus macaques
include the ability to manipulate the dose, route, and
strain of the infectious agent, as well as the ability to
analyze specimens from defined time points. For the
study of KIR activity, perhaps the most important
advantage is the ability to select subjects based on
genetics. This benefit is evidenced by the work in macaques to elucidate the role of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
(CTL) response in immunodeficiency viral infection,
which is also heavily dependent on host genetics [21,22].
Macaque KIRs have received less study than human
KIRs. While previous work shows that macaque KIRs
have structure and genomic organization similar to
human KIRs, and suggests that they play a similar functional role, these studies also demonstrate that there has
been considerable evolution within macaque KIRs since
the species diverged [23]. While 15 genes have been
described in humans, the number and identity of the
KIR genes present in macaques is distinct. Developing
an understanding of the KIR genes present in this species and an overall assessment of KIR genetic diversity
is a matter of practical importance for the use of macaques as a model for KIR function. Using cDNA
sequences, an initial model for macaque KIR genetic
organization was formed containing 18 putative KIR
groups [23,24]. In addition to the sequence of KIR transcripts, the genomic sequence of one rhesus macaque
KIR haplotype has been described [25]. More recent studies have added to the total number of described macaque KIR sequences [23,24,26-28]. With more sequence

data available, phylogenetic relationships became clearer,
and the model of macaque KIR genetics has been
refined. This body of work has been used to create a
model for macaque KIR genetic organization and to
develop a formal system of nomenclature (Guethlein et
al, in preparation).
Here we present the results of a survey of rhesus
macaque KIR genetics. Using full-length cloning, we
identified 47 novel full-length rhesus macaque KIRs,
substantially increasing the library of known sequences.
Using this expanded library, we performed phylogenetic
analysis supporting the existence of 22 rhesus macaque
KIR genes. Together with previously published KIR
sequences, this provides a framework with which to
describe KIR genetics in this species. In addition to
improving our understanding of macaque KIRs at the
population level, we developed a novel pyrosequencingbased approach for KIR genotyping. This technique
provides both comprehensive KIR genotyping and frequency estimates for expression of each KIR transcript.
The findings presented here, along with the novel techniques set forth, should serve as a foundation for further
research on rhesus KIR genetics and for defining KIR
function in this important animal model.

Methods
Animal Care and Specimen Processing

Animals used in this study were housed and cared for
by the trained veterinary staff at the Wisconsin National
Primate Research Center (WNPRC) or the New England
Primate Research Center (NEPRC). All procedures were
approved by the host institution’s Animal Care and Use
Committee. Nucleic acid was obtained from peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or purified natural
killer (NK) cells, as indicated. RNA purification was
accomplished using either the MagnaPure LC Total
Nucleic Acid Purification kit (Roche, Branford, CT) or
the DNA/RNA Allprep Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
NK cells were isolated from whole PBMC by negative
magnetic bead fractionation. First, PBMC were incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature in 0.1% BSA/
PBS with a cocktail of cross-reactive human monoclonal
IgG antibodies composed of the following: anti-CD3
(clone SP34-2, BD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA), anti-CD14
(clone M5E2, BD Biosciences), anti-CD40 (clone 5C3,
BD Biosciences), and anti-CD66/CEACAM (clone
TET2, AbCam, Cambridge, MA or Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Next, antibody-coated PBMC
were washed and resuspended in 0.1% BSA/PBS then
incubated for 35 minutes at room temperature with
Pan-IgG Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech, Norway) at a 4:1
bead-to-cell ratio. The suspension was then placed on a
Dynal magnet and the unbound cells were collected.

Purity was assessed by flow cytometry with >90% of collected cells routinely bearing an NK cell phenotype of
NKG2A + CD8 + CD3 - . All acquisitions were made on a
FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using
FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR).

extracellular Ig domains (D0, D1, and D2) were analyzed
separately using the methods described above. The stem,
transmembrane and cytoplasmic tails were not included in
this analysis as previous reports have shown that the stem,
transmembrane, and tail of macaque activating KIRs share
similarity to KIR2DL4 and are distinct [23].

Full-Length cDNA Cloning and Sequencing

First-strand cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript III First-Strand One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR amplification was performed using Phusion
high-fidelity polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich,
MA) and the following external primers: 5’-CAGCACCATGTCGCTCAT-3’ and 5’-GGGGTCAAGTGAAGTGGAGA-3’. PCR conditions were: 98°C for 30 s, 28
cycles of 98°C for 5 s, 63°C for 1 s, 72°C for 20 s, and a
final extension at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were
cloned into pCR-Blunt TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) and bidirectionally sequenced using DYEnamic ET
Terminator cycle sequencing kit (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Internal primers used in sequencing were 5’AACCTTCCCTCCTGGCC-3 and 5’-TTGGTTCAGT
GGGTGAAGGCCAA-3.’ CodonCode Aligner (CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA) was used for sequence
analysis, and in order to minimize error introduced by
PCR artifacts, novel alleles were only included when
three or more identical full-length cDNA clones were
observed. Novel sequences have been deposited in Genbank (Additional file 1, Table S1). Novel full-length
sequences were assigned formal names through the
Immuno Polymorphism Database [29].

As with our full-length products, cDNA was synthesized
using the Superscript III First-Strand One-Step RT-PCR
kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). cDNA-PCR amplicons
spanning 623 base pairs of the D1 and D2 domains
were synthesized using Phusion high-fidelity polymerase
(New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Each PCR primer
contained a target-specific sequence, an MID tag, and
an adapter sequence (Additional file 1, Table S2). PCR
conditions were: 98°C for 30 s, 28-33 cycles of 98°C for
5 s, 61°C for 1 s, 72°C for 20 s, and a final extension at
72°C for 5 min. cDNA-PCR product purification was
accomplished using Ampure XP beads (Agencourt, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Amplicons were then normalized to equimolar concentrations and grouped into pools of twelve samples for
Titanium amplicon pyrosequencing. Emulsion PCR,
Roche/454 Titanium amplicon pyrosequencing, image
processing, and base calling were performed according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche/454 Life
Sciences, Branford, CT) at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign High-Throughput Sequencing Center. Each pool of twelve samples was sequenced in onesixteenth of a 70 × 75 PicoTiterPlate.

Phylogenetic Analysis

Sequence Analysis

The cDNA sequences obtained in this analysis and from
previous studies [23,25,27,28,30] were aligned using
Clustal X [31] and manually corrected in BioEdit (Ibis
Therapeutics, Carlsbad, CA). Phylogenetic trees for the
complete dataset were made using both neighbor-joining
(1000 replicates, pairwise deletion, Tamura-Nei, in
MEGA4) and parsimony (1000 replicates in Paup).
These trees were used to divide the sequences into
Mamu-KIR3DL20, -KIR2DL04, -KIR1D, and -KIR3D (lineage II) groups. Subsequent analysis was restricted to the
lineage II dataset using the same methods. Alleles of
Mamu-KIR3DL11, -KIR3DS01, -KIR3DS03, -KIR3DSW07,
and -KIR3DSW08 were not obtained in this study and
sequences for these genes were taken from GenBank
[23,27,30,32].
A dataset containing consensus sequences for each of
the lineage II KIR genes was constructed using all known
sequences to compute the consensus sequence. For groups
containing only two allotypes, one of the allotypes was
chosen to represent the consensus. The sequences used
are indicated in Additional file 1, Figure S1. The individual

Pyrosequencing flowgram data was processed using a
custom analysis pipeline. Briefly, data were trimmed
by sequence quality and aligned against a reference
database of all known macaque KIR sequences using
the Mosaik aligner (http://code.google.com/p/mosaikaligner/). The reference library of KIR sequences was
obtained from the Immuno Polymorphism Database
[29]. Polymorphisms between reads and the reference
sequences were scored with custom scripts that utilized Samtools and BioPerl [33,34]. The source code
for this pipeline can be obtained from a subversion
repository (https://hedgehog.fhcrc.org/tor/stedi/trunk/
server/customModules/SequenceAnalysis). The pipeline itself has been integrated into the LabKey Software platform as the SequenceAnalysis module, which
provides a graphical, web-based platform to initiate
analysis pipelines and view results. LabKey is a free,
open source software package available at http://www.
labkey.org. Sanger sequence data was analyzed using
CodonCode Aligner (CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA).

PCR Amplification and Pyrosequencing

In order to reduce errors introduced by PCR artifacts,
KIR sequences were only considered to be present in an
animal if they represented one percent or more of total
KIR sequence reads from that animal. In order to identify novel alleles not present in the reference library,
unaligned sequences were then assembled in CodonCode Aligner at 100% identity. BLAST analysis was performed for the resulting contigs against a database of
published Mamu-KIR sequences. Unaligned sequences
were deemed novel when they represented at least one
percent of total sequence reads from at least one animal
and did not represent a potential insertion/deletion
error in the pyrosequencing base-calling.

Results
Rhesus macaque KIR diversity

KIR genotype has a significant influence on NK cell
activity. Studying the role of macaque KIR genetics in
disease pathogenesis first requires an understanding of
total diversity within the population and a framework
within which to describe it. To date, 149 distinct fulllength Mamu-KIR sequences have been deposited in
Genbank. By comparison, there are more than 615 distinct KIR alleles identified in humans–more than four
times as many alleles as have been identified to date in
rhesus macaques [35]. Thus, the previously catalogued
alleles likely represent only a fraction of total MamuKIR diversity. In order to expand the repertoire of
known Mamu-KIR alleles, we performed full-length
cloning and sequencing of KIR alleles from 17 Indian
rhesus macaques. These animals yielded 47 novel KIR
alleles, a substantial expansion of documented rhesus
macaque KIR diversity (Additional file 1, Table S1). The
novel sequences have been assigned names following the
KIR genes and nomenclature conventions established in
the Non-human Primate KIR Nomenclature Report
(Guethlein et al, in preparation)1.
As a first step in the analysis of the rhesus macaque
sequences recovered from cloning, phylogenetic trees
based on the full-length sequences were constructed.
Human KIRs have been divided by phylogenetic analyses
into four lineages2. Macaque KIRs assorted into groups
matching these lineages. The sequences assorted into
Mamu-KIR2DL04 (lineage I), -KIR3D (lineage II),
-KIR1D (lineage III), and -KIR3DL20 (lineage V), with
the majority of sequences resembling human lineage II,
in accordance with previous publications [25,30,36].
Relatively little allelic variation was observed within the
Mamu-KIR2DL04, -KIR3DL20, and -KIR1D groups (data
not shown). In contrast, the Mamu-KIR3D lineage II
sequences were highly diverse. Our sequences assorted
into 19 distinct groups corresponding to 19 of the rhesus macaque lineage II genes (Figure 1 and Additional
file 1, Figure S1). An important point to note is that

Page 4 of 13

rather than increasing the number of detected KIR
genes, most novel sequences share strong similarity with
established macaque KIR genes. Therefore, while there
are likely a large number of undiscovered macaque KIR
alleles, the most common macaque KIR genes may now
have been identified.
There is evidence for extensive recombination among
the Mamu-KIR sequences described here. To identify
recombination events affecting individual alleles,
sequences were analyzed with the RDP (recombinant
detection program) package and inspected manually
(data not shown). In addition, domain-by-domain phylogenetic analysis using consensus sequences for each
gene revealed extensive domain sharing between macaque KIR genes (Figure 2). This suggests that the genes
are themselves products of ancient duplication and
recombination events. This mechanism for the generation of KIR genes is consistent with observations of
KIRs in other species [37]. Pairs of KIRs with similar
extracellular domains but differing cytoplasmic tails
have been observed in other species, with human
KIR3DL1/3DS1 being a notable example [38]. In this
analysis we also found such pairing, with the bestmatched pair being Mamu-KIR3DLW03 and MamuKIR3DS05. Other pairs were identified that were similar
in two of the three extracellular Ig-like domains, for
example Mamu-KIR3DL07 and Mamu-KIR3DSW09.
Cytoplasmic domains were not included in this analysis,
although it should be noted that macaque long and
short cytoplasmic tails are phylogenetically distinct, with
the latter resembling the tail of human KIR2DL4 [23].
Comprehensive KIR genotyping by pyrosequencing

The expanded library of macaque KIR sequences described
in this publication and others has enabled the creation of a
framework to describe macaque KIRs, and its phylogenetic
analysis suggests that the most common KIR genes have
been identified [24-28,30,32]. For the study of KIRs in
disease pathogenesis, one of the most basic requirements
is the ability to identify the KIRs expressed by individual
subjects. KIRs pose many challenges for genotyping: each
subject expresses a distinct number of KIRs, there is
extensive sequence homology between KIR transcripts,
splice variants may be functionally significant, and pseudogenes are common. The cloning-based strategy we
employed for allele discovery can be used to provide genotypes of individual subjects; however, this method is labor
intensive and will frequently miss low-abundance transcripts due to the limited number of clones examined.
Techniques such as sequence-specific PCR (SSP) can be
used to identify the presence or absence of a particular
gene or allele; however, sequence homology between KIRs
complicates primer design, and a large number of primer
pairs would be required for comprehensive genotyping.

Figure 2 Domain shuffling has acted to form rhesus macaque
KIR genes. The results of a domain-by-domain phylogenetic
analysis are shown schematically. Predicted amino-acid consensus
sequences for each of the genes were used to form both neighborjoining and parsimony trees as described in the Methods section.
The sequences encoding the three extracellular Ig-like domains
were analyzed separately. Boxes are colored for the D0, D1, and D2
domains where the grouping was supported by >50% bootstrap
support in the phylogenetic analyses. Boxes that are not completely
colored represent cases where support of >50% was only found in
the neighbor-joining analysis. Long cytoplasmic tails are colored red
and short tails are colored green. The domains colored white were
not resolved into any group in the analysis and should not be
interpreted as being closely related to each other. The stem,
transmembrane and cytoplasmic tails were grouped as either long
or short by inspection of the alignment. D0, D1, and D2 denote the
Ig-like domains. ST/TM/CYT denotes the stem, transmembrane, and
cytoplasmic tail domains.

sequences (Figure 3). These primers amplify a region of
623 bp spanning the majority of D1, all of D2, and
part of the stem region. This amplicon was selected to
span a polymorphic region of the transcript and to
maximize conservation of primers. These primer sites
are also conserved amongst most published MamuKIR1D alleles–although they will not amplify MamuKIR2DL04 sequences, as these lack the D1 region and
therefore the 5’ primer-binding site. These primers
were used for PCR on cDNA derived from total RNA,
producing amplicons representing the distinct MamuKIR3D and -KIR1D transcripts expressed by each subject. Pyrosequencing of these amplicons produces clonal sequence reads corresponding to individual input
transcripts. Collectively, these reads represent the KIRs
expressed by the subject, with the exception of MamuKIR2DL04. A schematic of this process is shown in
Figure 4.
Using this approach, we genotyped PBMC samples
from 61 animals. We detected an average of 1836 total
sequence reads per animal, representing an average of
10.7 distinct transcripts per animal. The KIR genotypes
of three half-siblings are shown in Figure 5. For each
animal, the distinct KIRs detected are shown, along with
the relative frequency of each KIR. In most cases, each
sequence read unambiguously matched a single KIR
allele, providing typing resolution to the allele level.
When reads were identical to more than one known
KIR, the result is presented either as a set of alleles (ie.

To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel
sequence-based typing approach. Recent developments
in Roche/454 Titanium pyrosequencing technology have
enabled sequencing of cDNA-PCR amplicons with high
sensitivity and throughput. To adapt this approach for
KIR genotyping, we first identified primer sites that are
highly conserved across all published Mamu-KIR3D

sequencing reads span the D1, D2, and stem (ST) regions. The

Comprehensive KIR Genotype and
Transcript Frequencies

Figure 4 Outline of KIR genotyping strategy. The input material
is isolated RNA, which will represent all KIRs transcribed by the
subject. PCR is performed using conserved KIR-specific primers that
add adapter tags. The PCR products are pyrosequenced, producing
1000s of reads, with each read representing a single input molecule.
These reads are compared against a reference database of macaque
KIR sequences. This analysis produces a list of all KIRs detected per
subject, including the relative frequency of each KIR.

Mamu-KIR3DL10*001/004, meaning the animal is positive for either Mamu-KIR3DL10*001 or *004) or as positive for a gene (ie. Mamu-KIR1Dg, meaning the animal
has an allele of this gene). The latter is comparable to
the level of resolution commonly provided by sequence
specific PCR. To validate this technique, we compared
the results of pyrosequencing with cloning data (Figure
5 and Additional file 1, Table S3). Because pyrosequencing examines hundreds or thousands of clones, as
opposed to the tens of clones generally examined in
conventional cloning, the former is able to detect more
transcripts per animal, providing a more comprehensive
genotype. An example is seen in r95061 with MamuKIR3DS06, which was detected by pyrosequencing, but
was not detected by cloning. While the 623bp amplicon
used in pyrosequencing was frequently able to provide

Figure 5 Differential KIR expression between subjects with a
common KIR haplotype. A) KIR genotypes obtained by
pyrosequencing are shown for three rhesus macaque half-siblings.
The relative expression level of each detected KIR allele is shown.
Striped bars indicate alleles present on their shared KIR haplotype.
The number of pyrosequencing reads is shown to the left of each
graph. B) For r95061, the KIR alleles detected by cDNA cloning are
shown. A total of 101 clones were examined. If indicated, the allele
detected is listed. A plus sign indicates the genotyping resolution
obtained by cloning is identical to the resolution obtained by
pyrosequencing.

allele-level typing, there are examples for which fulllength cloning provided higher resolution typing, as we
observe for KIR3DL01*001 and KIR3DL10*004 in
r95061 (Figure 5).
A key advantage of pyrosequencing is that it provides
estimates of the relative transcript frequency for each KIR.
This is a dimension not usually captured by genotyping
techniques. The three animals in Figure 5 share a KIR haplotype containing Mamu-KIR1D, Mamu-KIR3DL1*001,
Mamu-KIR3DL10*004 and Mamu-KIR3DS04*002 (Figure 5,
striped bars). KIR expression is influenced by the complete KIR and MHC genotype of the subject [10,17,39].

Moreland et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:295
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/295

Work in humans has shown that KIR genotype is only
loosely predictive of KIR RNA expression [40]. While the
animals in Figure 5 share one KIR haplotype, their second
KIR haplotypes are distinct, and none are MHC identical
(data not shown). We observe considerable differences in
the expression level of the KIRs on the shared haplotype,
which is likely attributable to differences in KIR/MHC
genotype. While these findings are not unexpected given
the complex regulation of KIR expression, they do underscore the need to examine factors beyond the simple presence or absence of a given KIR.
To validate this technique, we examined the reproducibility of KIR expression levels. We performed two
independent NK cell preparations from four animals,
and two independent PCRs from each cell preparation.
The resulting PCR amplicons were pyrosequenced. A
graph of the relative expression level of each KIR is
shown in Figure 6, with the full data in Additional file 1,
Table S4. The frequency of each KIR was highly reproducible between sample preparations and PCR replicates. In every instance for which the average expression
of a KIR was greater than 3% of total reads, that KIR
transcript was detected in all replicates, demonstrating
high sensitivity. It should be noted that transcripts present in less than 3% of total transcripts were missed in
some reactions. There was also greater variability in
detected expression levels among lower frequency transcripts. Of interest, in three of four animals, a single
KIR transcript was dominant, representing greater than
60% of reads. Animal 225-97 was an exception, where
four distinct KIRs comprise between 15-20% of the
population each.
Another advantage of sequence-based typing, as
opposed to techniques such as sequence-specific PCR, is
that it is not limited to previously described alleles.
From this data we were able to characterize an additional 44 novel partial-length rhesus macaque KIR
sequences, 32 of which were found in multiple animals.
As was the case with our novel full-length sequences,
most novel KIR sequences showed significant sequence
homology to the phylogenetic groups defined in Figure
1 (Additional file 1, Table S5), further supporting these
putative gene groupings. While the majority of novel
sequences were similar to these groups, we also identified two novel sequences, KIRnov03 and KIRnov04, that
are similar to Mamu-KIR3DS03, but with a distinctive
sequence motif in D1 (Figure 7). These sequences are of
interest because they share this motif with a sequence
previously found only in cynomolgus macaques (Macaca
fascicularis) (EU419113). The unique residues for these
sequences (186-193) correspond to predicted MHC class
I binding sites [41]. These sequences may represent an
additional macaque KIR gene, or a lineage within
KIR3DS03.

Figure 6 Pyrosequencing produces reproducible frequency
estimates for KIR transcripts. Pyrosequencing results from four
animals are shown. Per animal, two independent cell preparations
were performed, and two independent PCRs were performed per
cell preparation. For each replicate, the expression of each KIR is
graphed as a percentage of total reads. Bars represent the average
and standard deviation among replicates. For animal 225-97
(asterisk), only one cell pellet was available, so only two data points
are shown.

Population survey of KIR gene frequency

Obtaining comprehensive KIR genotypes from this large
cohort allowed us to examine the relative frequency of
each KIR gene at the population level (Figure 8A). We
combined the pyrosequencing data with full-length cloning data to form a 69-animal cohort. While no KIR gene
was present in every animal, Mamu-KIR3DL01 was present in approximately 84% of the cohort, making it the
closest approximation to a framework gene in this
population. While Mamu-KIR3DL20, -KIR3DL11, and
-KIR3DSW08 have been proposed as framework genes
for this species, each was present in less than 25% of
this cohort [27]. It should be noted that our approach
will identify transcribed KIRs only, while Kruse et al.
employed sequence-specific PCR from genomic DNA.
Our previous work in cynomolgus macaques suggests
that Mafa-KIR3DL20 is commonly found as a pseudogene [28], which would be detected from gDNA, but
not mRNA. It is possible some rhesus macaque haplotypes also have Mamu-KIR3DL20 as a pseudogene.
While differences in technique may explain some discrepancies, it is also possible that the distinct breeding
populations of rhesus macaques have distinctive genetic
compositions. Mamu- KIR2DL04 has also been

Figure 7 Novel rhesus macaque KIR sequences share homology with cynomolgus macaque KIRs. Amino acid differences between the
consensus sequences for the lineage II Mamu-KIR genes, KIRnov03, KIRnov04 and the Mafa-KIR sequence EU419113 are shown. The amino-acid
position is indicated above the amino-acid sequences. The positions in the novel sequences that vary from the consensus are highlighted.
Residues predicted to be involved in MHC-binding or alpha-helix loops are indicated below the sequences with B or L respectively. Black
shading indicates residues for which no sequence coverage was available.

suggested as a framework gene in macaques [27],
although -KIR2DL04 was only identified in 2 of 8 published cynomolgus macaque haplotypes [28]. As noted
previously, the primers used in this study select against
Mamu-KIR2DL04 transcripts, so we could not determine the presence or absence of this gene.
Using the pyrosequencing data generated from our
cohort of 61 animals, we compared the relative contribution of each KIR gene to the total KIR transcripts identified in each animal (Figure 8B). Although pyrosequencing
provides information about the KIR allele, genotyping
results were condensed to the gene level for this comparison. The error bars representing the mean and SEM for
each gene demonstrate highly variable expression levels
for most genes between subjects, with a few KIRs consistently expressed at either high (i.e. Mamu-KIR3DL08) or
low (i.e. Mamu-KIR3DSw09) levels. As observed in Figure
5, the expression level of a given KIR gene can differ even
between genetically similar subjects and is likely influenced by the complete KIR/MHC genotype of that subject.
While it would be interesting to examine the relative
expression of each KIR in the context of MHC genotype,
macaques can express up to 20 distinct MHC class I transcripts and only a handful of macaque KIR/MHC binding
partners have been identified [42,43]. Therefore this analysis is not practical until physiological macaque KIR/MHC
interactions are better understood.

Rhesus macaque KIR haplotypes

While not all members of this cohort had pedigree
information available, there were five distinct pedigreed
families within the cohort for which segregation analysis
was possible, with a total of 46 animals. By performing
segregation analysis using genotypes obtained from
cloning and pyrosequencing data, we were able to infer
the KIR gene content of 9 haplotypes (Figure 9). Because
these haplotypes were defined using segregation analyses, the linear order of KIR genes cannot be conclusively determined and the physical map of gene order
shown in Figure 9 is arbitrary. It should be noted that
this analysis allows only for definition of the minimum
number of genes on a given haplotype, as heterozygosity
versus homozygosity is sometimes not possible to rigorously determine, and low-level transcripts may not be
detected in all animals with a given haplotype [30].
Among our 9 haplotypes, each was unique as compared
to previously published rhesus macaque KIR haplotypes,
with an average of 4.6 genes present per haplotype
(Range: 3-7) [25,27,28,30]. In accordance with previous
studies, we noted one incidence of a duplicated KIR3DL
gene (Mamu-KIR3DL10) [27,30]. As described above,
there is a notable absence of framework genes among
these haplotypes. Mamu-KIR3DL01 represents the most
common KIR in our cohort, yet it is present in only 7 of
the 9 haplotypes.

Figure 8 Frequency and relative expression of KIR genes in the
rhesus macaque cohort. A) Y-axis indicates the percentage of
animals within the cohort (n = 69) that express the indicated KIR
gene. Genes not listed were not present in any animal within our
cohort. Mamu-KIR2DL04 was excluded since it is not amplified by
our pyrosequencing amplicon. B) Graph illustrates the percent of
total pyrosequencing reads per animal (n = 61) for each KIR gene.
Averages and SEM are represented by error bars. Each animal
included had at least 100 sequencing reads. Genotyping results
representing less than 1% of total reads in an animal were excluded
to mitigate the influence of PCR artifacts. Ambiguous reads
matching more than one KIR gene and splice variants were also
excluded.

Discussion
Killer immunoglobulin-like receptor signaling is implicated in the immune response to numerous human
pathogens, yet elucidating the role of KIR mediated signaling in disease pathogenesis is difficult in human subjects. The results of this study advance our
understanding of macaque KIRs, enabling the study of
KIR activity in this important non-human primate

model for many human diseases. This study identified
47 novel full-length rhesus macaque KIRs, a substantial
increase in the number of published sequences. Combined with previously published data, our results confirm the existence of 22 common macaque KIR genes,
with extensive allelic variation within each gene (Guethlein et al, in preparation). This model of macaque KIR
genetics provides an essential framework within which
to describe and characterize macaque KIRs. In addition,
among the novel sequences found using pyrosequencing,
two sequences provide evidence for the existence of
either a divergent lineage of Mamu-KIR3DS03 or an
additional gene. While no KIR gene was present in all
subjects, Mamu-KIR3DL01 was expressed in 84% of
subjects and 8 genes were present in >50% of the
cohort. This frequency information may be useful to
prioritize KIRs for further functional characterization or
the design of cohorts. The comparative lack of
expressed framework genes is a distinction from human
KIR haplotypes, which may be related to differences in
MHC-I genetics. Humans express a maximum of six distinct HLA molecules, from 3 genomic loci. Macaques
lack MHC-I C, but can express as many as 20 distinct
MHC-I A/B alleles [44]. The expansion of macaque lineage II KIR3D loci, with a larger number of loci and few
dominant genes, likely mirrors the expansion of macaque MHC-I A/B.
We also present a novel pyrosequencing-based
approach for KIR genotyping. While this technique was
developed in macaques, it could easily be applied to
other species, including humans. The ability to characterize the KIR genotype of individual subjects is a basic
requirement for the study of KIR function; however, the
KIR region presents many challenges for genotyping.
The approach we present comprehensively identifies the
expressed KIR transcripts and provides a semi-quantitative measure of the relative expression level for each
KIR. Our data demonstrate that even subjects sharing a
KIR haplotype can have widely different expression
levels of these shared KIRs. NK cells undergo complex
regulation of KIR expression [10,17]. NK clones expressing fewer distinct KIRs can have a reduced activation
threshold under certain conditions, resulting in
enhanced NK cell activity [45]. The relative expression
of each KIR therefore provides potentially important
functional information.
While this and other recent studies have advanced our
understanding of the genetic organization and diversity
of macaque KIRs, KIR activity must be understood in
the context of MHC genotype. The limited knowledge
of functional KIR/MHC binding partners remains a key
obstacle. Recent work has identified multiple macaque
KIR/MHC-I interactions, including allotypes of MamuKIR3DL05, -KIR3DLW03, -KIR3DL11 and -KIR3DS05

Figure 9 Novel rhesus macaque KIR haplotypes. KIR genes are indicated along the top axis. The identity of the allele is indicated within the
schematic boxes if it was determined. Because data were generated from cDNA expression, only expressed KIRs are shown, and the physical
map of gene order is arbitrary. Brackets indicate gene duplication. Since Mamu-KIR2DL04 cannot be amplified by our pyrosequencing amplicon,
dotted boxes indicate haplotypes in which a false negative typing for this locus is possible.

[43,46]. Preliminary evidence suggests the residues of
the Bw4/Bw6 motifs influence KIR/MHC binding in
macaques, although the important residues differ from
those in humans. Expanding the number of identified
KIR/MHC partners and further defining the motifs
necessary for macaque KIR/MHC interaction remains
essential for the advancement of the field.

Conclusions
The data and techniques presented here have implications for the study of many diseases using rhesus macaques as a model system and for the KIR field as a whole.
The ability to study KIRs in a nonhuman primate model
creates an opportunity for significant advancement in our
understanding of KIRs in human disease. The novel highthroughput KIR genotyping method we developed has
implications for many species, including potential application in humans, and the approach could be adapted for
other polymorphic immune loci.
Endnotes
1
A note on nomenclature: KIR nomenclature reflects
both the domain structure and gene designation of the
sequence.
For
example,
an
allele
named
“KIR3DL01*001” denotes a KIR with 3 extracellular
immunoglobulin-like domains (3D). The “L” indicates
that this allele’s protein product has a long, inhibitory
cytoplasmic tail, while an “S” would instead indicate that
the protein product had a short, activating cytoplasmic
tail. The next two digits refer to the gene, in this case
KIR3DL01. Finally, the digits after the asterisk, “001” in
this example, refer to the specific allele.

Human KIRs are divided into four lineages. Lineage
I includes KIR2D genes having a D0 (immunoglobulinlike domain 0) plus D2 configuration such as KIR2DL4
and KIR2DL5; lineage II includes the KIR3DL genes
that bind MHC-A and -B epitopes; lineage III includes
KIR3D or KIR2D genes with a D1 plus D2 domain configuration that bind MHC-C epitopes, and lineage V is
represented by KIR3DL3. Lineage IV, which included
Mamu-KIR3DL01 and Mamu-KIR3DL10, was originally
described in Rajalingam, et al. [37]. Further work has
instead grouped these KIRs into lineage II and removed
lineage IV [47].
