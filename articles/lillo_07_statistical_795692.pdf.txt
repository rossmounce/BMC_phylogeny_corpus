Abstract
Background: Among microbial genomes, genetic information is frequently compressed, exploiting
redundancies in the genetic code in order to store information in overlapping genes. We investigate
the length, phase and orientation properties of overlap in 58 prokaryotic species evaluating neutral
and selective mechanisms of evolution.
Results: Using a variety of statistical null models we find patterns of compressive coding that can
not be explained purely in terms of the selective processes favoring genome minimization or
translational coupling. The distribution of overlap lengths follows a fat-tailed distribution, in which
a significant proportion of overlaps are in excess of 100 base pairs in length. The phase of overlap
– pairing of codon positions in complementary reading frames – is strongly predicted by the
translation orientation of each gene. We find that as overlapping genes become longer, they have
a tendency to alternate among alternative overlap phases. Some phases seem to reflect codon
pairings reducing the probability of non-synonymous substitution. We analyze the lineagedependent features of overlapping genes by tracing a number of different continuous characters
through the prokaryotic phylogeny using squared-change parsimony and observe both cladespecific and species-specific patterns.
Conclusion: Overlapping reading frames preserve in their structure, features relating to
mutational origination of new genes, but have undergone modification for both immediate benefits
and for variational buffering and amplification. Genomes come under a variety of different
mutational and selectional pressures, and the structure of redundancies in overlapping genes can
be used to detect these pressures. No single mechanism is able to account for all the variability
observed among the set of prokaryotic overlapping genes but a three-fold analysis of evolutionary
events provides a more integrative framework.

Background
One of the remarkable discoveries arising from the study
of microbial genomes is that a single sequence of nucleic

acid bases can encode multiple different genes in overlapping reading frames [1-5]. This represents compression of
genetic information, much like the compression of sound

or video data in MP3 or MPEG formats [6]. Compression
is possible when there are redundancies in a message, and
genomic compression minimizes redundancies in a
nucleotide sequence by exploiting degeneracies in the
assignment rules of the canonical genetic code. A common framework according to which we might understand
overlapping genes has not been available, and recent
papers have called for some form of unified, evolutionary
explanation [7]. In this paper, we analyze length, polarity
and phase properties of genetic overlap in prokaryotes
adopting a common framework of genome compression
[8]. We consider three periods of the evolutionary process
starting with the origin of overlap and the subsequent
direct and indirect selection pressures acting on overlap
length and phase. To clarify the exposition we call these:
(1) mutational origins, (2) immediate benefits, and (3)
variational benefits.
The mutational origin of overlapping genes typically
involves point mutations to stop codons. These lead to the
extension of a reading frame over an existing gene producing a genetic palimpsest in which one gene is inscribed
above another. Once an overlap has arisen it can either
impose a cost in terms of increased mutational sensitivity
and regulatory interference [9], it can have no effect and
behave as a neutral trait, or confer benefits. Benefits can be
either immediate or variational.
The immediate benefits of overlap are features that have a
direct impact on the replicative or metabolic efficiency of
a genome within a single generation. Immediate benefits
are often hypothesized to account for variation in the
length of the overlapping sequences. The two immediate
benefits of overlap are: (1) that overlapping sequences
evolve under a pressure to foster replicative compression
thereby increasing the rate of DNA or RNA synthesis for a
fixed number of genes, and/or (2) for regulatory compression, reducing the independent regulatory overheads on
different genes. In viruses immediate benefits are considered a dominant pressure on genome size and multiple
overlapping genes are frequently present, often with genes
embedded within genes.
The variational benefits are features that influence the
standing, phenotypic variation in the population and
thereby modulate the strength of selection on a lineage.
These features are intended to account for variation in the
overlap phases. The two variational benefits are that: (1)
variation in the overlap phase is chiefly to be accounted
for in terms of a compensatory alignment of genes leading
to a maximum mutational redundancy, or (2) its inverse
– aligning overlapping genes in order to encourage greater
sequence mutability by promoting multiple amino acid
replacements upon a single nucleotide mutation.

All three sets of evolutionary process are tested against
data derived from prokaryotic genomes. Previous work on
overlap [2,10,11] has stressed sequence polarity and
length variability, typically in relation to mutational origins and immediate benefits associated with translation
or replication rates. These prior studies tend to emphasize
the detailed properties of the overlapping genes in a small
sample of species [12,13]. A summary of a few related earlier papers is given in Table 1. In this paper we explore the
selective implications of statistical regularities in phase
diversity, we explicitly introduce statistical, null models
against which we compare the data, and we identify the
ongoing legacy of mutational origins in established patterns of overlap in a large set of prokaryotic genes. A couple of observations that becomes apparent when reading
over the many previous studies on this topic are (Table 1)
an emphasis on gene regulation in eukaryotes and
genome compression in prokaryotes, and (2) a clear division into those studies focused on the mutational origin
of overlap favoring neutral hypotheses, and those focusing on ongoing selection pressures to minimize the mutational load of overlap while maximizing the coding
potential. Throughout this paper it will be stressed that
while these positions can serve as an useful focus for
investigation, a full understanding of overlap requires an
appreciation of all of these evolutionary processes and
their corresponding evolutionary sequence.

1 Mutation, Length and Phase
In this section we introduce several evolutionary processes
by briefly stepping through a series of events starting with
a random mutation producing an overlap, followed by an
immediate benefit of the overlap leading to the fixation
the overlapping variant, and the subsequent differential
selection acting on overlap phase to satisfy variational
constraints.
1.1 Origination
The differences in genetic overlap characteristics that we
observe among species frequently appears to be a legacy of
their stochastic mechanism of origination [14,15,33]. In
other words, overlap can arise by mutation and behave as
if it were selectively neutral. One mechanism of origination is that the overlapping sequences arise through random mutations to contiguous nucleotides of two genes in
a single strand, leading to the formation of a 4-base overlap to include a stop and start codon. Subsequent ribosomal frame shifting at the stop of the mRNA transcript
would allow for the initiation of translation of a second
gene. It has been suggested that for two Mycloplasma species this mechanism accounts for around 7% of cases of
overlap [33].

homology" captures the pattern of many studies to couple the statistics of large databases with the detailed analysis of a small number of
overlapping genes from well studied genomes. The difference between selection on expression versus selection on regulation seeks to discriminate
between co-expression (as in a codon) and active inhibition or activation (such as through anti-sense), The difference between selection on
replication and selection on coding reflects a difference only in emphasis as both imply a greater number of genes in a shorter sequence.

1.2 Minimization
Once overlap is established in a single genome it must fix
in a population. Fixation can be neutral or selective.
Immediate selective benefits can arise through both more
efficient regulation and increased rates of replication
[8,9,11,17]. In replicative compression, the total genome
length is minimized by increasing the number of overlapping genes without loss of protein function. All else being
equal, overlap can lead to an increase in the rate of replication by reducing the number of bases that need to be
synthesized. For a constant per base per genome mutation
rate, reducing genome size also reduces the mutation load
which is an important factor in promoting fixation of
genomes reduced through deletion events [18]. Having
said this, in some cases maximal growth rates become
independent of genome size suggesting alternative rate
limiting reactions [19]. Regulatory compression works in
two ways, both of which eliminate the need for independent transcription of genes. One mechanism, which applies
to overlapping genes in an operon, is co-translation. Cotranslation renders the translation of a distal gene
dependent on the prior translation of an upstream gene
[20,2]. Co-translation can increase the rate of protein synthesis and ensures a strict stoichiometry among gene
products. In the second mechanism, overlapping genes
are alternately translated through infrequent ribosomal
frame-shifts of a single mRNA transcript. Each frameshift
favors one polycistronic gene over another [22].

1.3 Phase modification
One consequence of the triplet code, is that overlapping
sequences can overlap in different translational phases –
the incidence of codon position pairings between genes.
For example, codon position 1 of gene 1 overlaps with
codon position 3 of gene 2 [9,10]. The evolutionary stability of variation in overlap phase can not be explained simply in terms of increased translation or replication rates
within individuals, as these are largely insensitive to
phase. Phase is a "variational property" meaning that it
does not contribute directly to organismal replication
rates within one generation, but indirectly, by modulating
the phenotypic effects of point mutations on descendant
sequence variability. In addition to phase differences
stemming from neutral mutations, we consider the variational principles of redundancy [23] and amplification [24]
in explaining phase variation in overlapping genes.

Redundancy describes the ability of overlapping
sequences to minimize non-synonymous substitutions at
the level of two or more proteins encoded by a single overlapping sequence. Whereas overlap can increase rates of
replication, it is also expected to increase mutation load
by increasing the number of amino acid substitutions for
a single base pair mutation. Overlapping sequences can
compensate for this sensitivity by pairing degenerate
codon positions with non-degenerate codon positions
through a suitable choice of phase.

Biology Direct 2007, 2:22

Amplification or increased "mutational effect", relates to
increased protein polymorphism following mutations to
genes occupying certain phases of overlap. Amplification
is achieved by pairing non-degenerate codon positions of
two or more overlapping sequences, thereby maximizing
the probability of non-synonymous substitutions.
Another way to think about overlap phase is that it
behaves analogously to 'adaptive-mutation' in prokaryotes [25], whereby genes experience different effective rates
of amino acid substitution by virtue of differential overlap
phase [26].
1.4 A multi-step process
As the foregoing paragraphs have suggested, patterns of
overlap are difficult to interpret, as at least three different
mechanisms can be adduced for extant patterns of diversity: mutations leading to overlap with neutral effects and
slow fixation rates, selective benefits accruing through
replicative and regulatory minimization leading to rapid
fixation, and indirect selective benefits associated with
increased or reduced standing variation through changes
in phase. In this paper we shall endeavor to tease apart
these contributions, bearing in mind that they are all
likely to play an enduring role.

2 Methods
We analyze 58 different species of prokaryotes whose
genomes have been completely sequenced (See Figure 1)
We selected the species (and the corresponding strains)
that are included in the COG (Clusters of Orthologous
Groups of proteins) database [27,28]. Each COG consists
of individual proteins or groups of paralogs from at least
3 lineages and thus corresponds to an ancient conserved
domain. We have analyzed all bacterial species available
at the COG database except Mycobacterium leprae, because
it is known that in this genome less than half of the
genome contains functional genes and pseudogenes are
abundant. For species, such as E. coli, for which more
strains are annotated we selected only one of them to
avoid duplicates. It is worth noting that by repeating the
analysis for a larger set of 83 species and by including all
the genes in the annotation, our results do not change significantly. While the use of the COGs database reduces the
false positive rate in our analysis, we do not have access to
the ribosomal binding sites for all overlapping genes,
which would further increase our confidence.
In our dataset there are 13 Archaea (10 Euryarchaeota and
3 Crenarchaeota) and 45 Bacteria. The length of genomes
range from 580 kbp to 7 Mbp. A scatter plot of the number
of genes plotted against the genome length shows a good
linear relation (R2 = 0.98), with a density of one gene per
1130 bp. The proportion of noncoding material in the
genome is around 13%, with extremal values of 6% (Thermotoga maritima) and 26% (Methanosarcina acetivorans).

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/22

There is no evident difference in these two properties
between Archaea and Bacteria.
In the following we consider only overlapping sequences
between two (or more) genes that are both annotated as
belonging to one COG. In this way we minimize the incidence of annotation errors. On average 76% (min = 58%,
max = 99%) of the annotated genes are annotated as
belonging to one COG. This makes our analysis representative of the behavior of genes in the genome. For
increased confidence we have repeated our analysis for a
more restrictive subset. We include in the restricted set
only those overlapping sequences that are conserved in
two or more species. A sequence is conserved in two
genomes if in the two species the overlap is created by two
pairs of genes belonging to the same COGs. We have
found that our results are replicated when using this
restricted data-set.
An overlapping sequence is a portion of the genome that
encodes some part of two or more protein coding genes.
We do not include in our analysis pairs of genes in which
one of the two genes is completely contained (embedded)
within the other. The number of overlapping sequences is
relatively high when compared to the total number of
genes in the genome. The mean number of genes involved
in at least one overlap is 27% with extremal values 8%
(Nostoc sp.) and 56% (Aquifex aeolicus and Thermotoga maritima). As a consequence, in prokaryote genomes a significant proportion of genes have an overlapping sequence.
Top panel of Figure 2 shows a scatter plot of the number
of overlaps versus the total number of overlapping bases.
A linear fit on the data gives an estimate of the mean
length of the overlapping sequences equal to Ӎ26 bp (correlation coefficient ρ = 0.82, p = 10-15).

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Length and Strand Statistics
We have investigated the length distributions of overlapping sequences. We include all overlapping sequences of
all genomes conditioned on the constraint that both
genes in the overlap are annotated in the COG database.
The total number of overlaps are 14, 958. The bottom
panel panel of Figure 2 illustrates the probability that an
overlapping sequence is longer than x as a function of x.
The plot is log-log and indicates that the distribution is
fat-tailed and well approximated by a scale-free function
for at least two magnitudes of variation. This analysis indicates that long overlapping sequences are not rare. We discuss this result in section VI. The modal value of overlap
length is 4 bp. We observe a similar overlap distribution
when we restrict our analysis to conserved ORs as defined
in Section 2 (blue line in bottom panel of Fig 2). This
result decreases the likelihood that long overlapping
sequences are an artifact of the annotation procedure.

Replicative benefits predict negative correlations among
the frequency of overlapping sequences, the genome
length and the noncoding DNA. The observation that
Thermotoga maritima possesses both the genome with the
smallest fraction of noncoding DNA and the largest frac-

tion of genes involved in an overlap, suggests that a replicative compression argument might explain the variation
in overlapping sequences in our database. In other words,
a bacterium for which a short genome is important is
expected to have a small fraction of noncoding DNA and

eny. This is largely because not all species in the data set
are well time-resolved and in addition we have no compelling model of genetic substitution within overlapping
genes. Parsimony might be an acceptable first approximation, but without an exhaustive empirical study this
remains conjectural. We do however, use parsimony to
trace more coarse-grained features of overlapping genes,
such as phase, in subsequent sections. The fraction of
genes are here defined as the number of genes annotated
as COG and involved in at least one overlap divided by
the total number of genes annotated as COG. A statistically significant anticorrelation (ρ = 0.53, p = 10-5) is
found indicating that when genome compression is
important the overlap is high and the noncoding fraction
is low (and vice-versa).

a high fraction of overlapping genes. We are, in resorting
to this hypothesis, for simplicity assuming that noncoding DNA is not carrying adaptive information and that a
genome can experience a reduction in the noncoding portion without significantly influencing function.
We test this hypothesis by plotting in the top panel of Fig.
3 the fraction of genes involved in an overlap against the
percentage of noncoding DNA. Each species is represented by a single strain and we do not correct for phylog-

A smaller but statistically significant correlation (ρ = 0.33, p = 0.01) is observed between the fraction of genes
involved in an overlap and total genome length (see bottom panel of Fig. 3). Here we reason that selective pressures for increased compression are favored in shorter
genomes (in absolute terms), and hence the observed negative correlation between the genome length and overlap
frequency. Of course, organisms cannot completely minimize their genomes as they need to retain the ability to
synthesize essential proteins. This requirement establishes
a lower bound on the correlation. Finally we observe a
correlation coefficient of 0.32 between the fraction of
noncoding genomes and the genome length (plot not
shown).
An additional way to investigate whether selection pressures for compression favor overlap is to compare the
length of the overlapping genes to their orthologues
which do not overlap. Under the hypothesis that a shorter
genome is favored by selection one might expect that
overlapping genes are shorter than their orthologues that
do not overlap. For each of the 5412 COGs we extract all
of the genes from the 58 genomes belonging to one COG
and we divide this collection in two subsets, one containing those genes that contribute to an overlap and the other
containing the orthologous genes that are not involved in
any overlap. We then perform a t test with the null
hypothesis that the mean length of the genes in the two
subsets is equal. The requirement that there are at least
two genes in both subsets decreases the number of COGs
to 2059. For 290 (14.1%) COGs one must reject the null
hypothesis that the two means are equal within 95% confidence. In all of these cases the mean gene length of the
subset of overlapping genes is shorter than the mean gene
length of the complement of orthologous, non-overlapping genes. The difference between mean gene length in
the two subsets is quite large. The left panel of Fig. 4 shows
the distribution of the differences between the mean
sequence lengths in the two subsets. On average, overlap-

strand or both are in the complementary strand (we call
them codirectional), when the first is in the normal strand
and the second in the complementary strand (convergent), and finally when the first is in the complementary
strand and the second in the normal strand (divergent). If
the two genes are overlapping, each of the 3 different configurations leads to a distinct type of overlapping
sequences. The arrows inside the panels of Figure 5 give a
graphical representation of the different overlap types.
We have investigated the joint probability of finding a
pair of consecutive genes (not necessarily overlapping) in
one of the three orientations described above. This property will prove to be important serving as a null hypothesis for comparison with the distribution of configurations
of overlapping sequences. In a circular genome the
number of convergent gene pairs needs to be exactly equal
to the number of divergent gene pairs. In a linear genome
one of the two can be at most larger than the other by one.
Since the number of genes is quite large (of the order of
thousands of genes) the percentage of convergent pairs is
approximately equal to the percentage of divergent pairs.

database.

For the full set of 58 species the percentage of codirectional sequences is larger than 50%. As has been observed
in prior studies, this probably reflects the advantage of
having genes in the same strand in order to coordinate the
regulation of genes in operons [2]. Archaea have on average a smaller fraction of consecutive genes on the same
strand when compared to Bacteria (see below the discussion of Figure 5). The differences between Archaea and
Bacteria are probably related to the reduced incidence of
operons in Archaea. In many prokaryotic species the percentage of codirectional sequences in the normal strand is
close to the percentage of codirectional sequences in the
complementary strand, indicating the absence of a functional preference for either one of the two strands [17].

ping genes are 220 bp shorter than their orthologues that
do not overlap (the median value of the difference is 110
bp). The distribution of the differences between the standard deviations in lengths is fairly asymmetric. The right
panel of Fig. 4 shows the distribution of the differences of
the standard deviations in the two subsets. The distribution has more mass for positive values indicating that the
sequence length of overlapping genes has a smaller dispersion than the sequence length of orthologous genes
that do not overlap.

We now compare the empirical frequencies of the different configurations of consecutive genes with the distribution of configurations for overlapping genes. Clearly there
are 3 configurations of overlapping genes depending on
the orientation of the two genes involved in the overlap.
We will make use of the same terms, codirectional, convergent, and divergent, to indicate different configurations of overlapping genes. Figure 5 shows the percentage
of the 3 configurations of overlapping genes in the 58
genomes versus the percentage of consecutive (non necessary overlapping) genes of the same type.

The hypothesis of immediate regulatory benefits requires
that overlaps should preferentially be found on the same
strand and be short. Given a pair of consecutive genes in
a prokaryotic circular genome, they can occupy four possible orientations. When the two genes are in the normal

Assuming that the occurrence of an overlapping sequence
was equally efficient in terms of the compression of information for the three possible configurations, one might
expect that the probabilities for the 3 configurations of
overlapping sequences were approximately equal to the

probabilities for the 3 configurations of non-overlapping,
paired genes. Figure 5 indicates that this is not the case. In
fact, in the vast majority of cases, divergent overlapping
genes are strongly underrepresented. Moreover, the convergent overlapping sequences are more common in
Archaea (but also in the Chlamydiae and Cyanobacteriae)
than in most Bacteria. The under representation of divergent overlapping sequences is probably the result of the
necessity of encoding regulatory elements in the upstream
region of genes for this configuration [17].
We test the null hypothesis that the configurations of
overlapping sequences are distributed identically to the
configurations of consecutive genes. In 53 cases the χ2 test
rejects the null hypothesis with 99% confidence. The 5
prokaryotes for which the null hypothesis cannot be
rejected are Halobacterium (Archaea), Mycoplasma penetrans, Ureaplasma urealyticum (Firmicutes), Buchnera
aphidicola, (Proteobacteria bacteria), Treponema pallidum
(Spirochaetes). In summary the analysis of the frequencies of overlap configurations lends support to the immediate regulatory hypothesis.
The second prediction of the immediate regulatory benefit
hypothesis is that overlapping sequence should be short.
The inset of the bottom panel of Figure 2 shows that, even
if long sequences are frequently observed, the modal overlap length is 4 bp. This result can be better appreciated if
one considers the overlap length distribution for the three
different configurations discussed above. Figure 6 shows
the cumulative density function of the length of the 3
types of overlapping genes. The figure indicates that codi-

rectional and convergent overlapping sequences are similarly distributed, whereas the divergent sequences, that
constitute a small fraction of the total overlapping
sequences (see Fig. 5), are distributed in a different way.
A closer inspection of Fig. 6 illustrates the presence of discontinuities in the cumulative density functions at x = 4
for codirectional and convergent overlapping sequences.
These jumps are a result of overlapping sequences of
length 4 with a start (ATG) and a stop (TAA, TAG and
TGA) codon. For the codirectional overlapping sequences,
the tetramer ATGA contains the stop codon (TGA) of the
first gene and the start codon (ATG) of the second gene.
For convergent overlapping sequences, four tetramers
CTAA, TTAA, CTAG, and TTAG are consistent with the termination of the two genes in opposite strands. Thus the
abundance of short overlaps, and specifically those on the
same strand and of length 4 bp, is an indication that regulatory genomic compression is a key factor in promoting
short overlapping sequences.
Assuming that overlapping genes provide immediate regulatory benefits (for example when there is a short codirectional overlap) they can also create new challenges for
the regulation of gene expression. Consider the case of
convergent overlapping genes. One important mechanism of transcriptional termination in Prokaryotes is rhoindependent termination. The signal for termination is a
stable hairpin followed by a U-rich sequence. For E. coli
approximately half of the transcriptional units are
thought to be terminated by a rho-independent terminator [31]. For genes involved in a convergent overlap, the

rho-independent terminators must be present in the coding sequence of one of the overlapping genes. With this
constraint one might expect that the genes participating in
convergent overlaps rarely make use of rho-independent
motifs. We investigate this in the E. coli genome where 58
convergent overlaps are observed. We extract those genes
that have a putative rho-independent terminator among
those descibed in Ref. [31]. Somewhat surprisingly we
find that in 19 overlaps one of the two genes makes use of
a rho-independent terminator and in 2 overlaps, both
genes have two (different) rho-independent terminators.
In total only 23 (20%) of the 116 convergent overlapping
genes have a rho-terminator. These results suggest that
selection often succeeds in creating compressed sequences
with dual coding and regulatory properties.

3.1.1 Phylogenetic patterns in abundance statistics
Using squared-change parsimony ([32]) we have traced
the total number of overlaps, in addition to the number
of co-directional, convergent and divergent overlapping
genes through the consensus Prokaryotic phylogeny illustrated in Figure 1. The results are shown in figure 7 where
the color coding relates the numerical values as indicated
in the accompanying color-scales. When it comes to the
total number of overlaps there is no outstanding cladelevel regularity other than the appearance of an elevated
number of overlaps in the proteobacterial clades, the crenarchaeota and the euryarchaeota. Interestingly, based on
the wide distribution of abundant overlaps over the tips of
the tree, many of the more ancestral groups would seem
to have possessed a higher than average number of overlapping genes than their descendants. Derived reduction
in overlap is most pronounced in the firmicutes which

possess a below average number of overlapping genes.
Co-directional overlaps are fairly abundant across most
species (other than the firmicutes), whereas convergent
and divergent overlaps are restricted from most clades and
are most common in the crenarchaeota and euryarchaeota. Exceptions to this pattern are found for the alpha-proteobacteria, where a few species, most notably the
Caulobacter sp. shows a substantial, derived increase in the
abundance of both convergent and divergent overlapping
genes.
3.2 Phase Statistics
In order to test for variational benefits, above and beyond
biases resulting from mutation, we investigate the statistical properties of different phases in which a given overlap
can be found. For each configuration of overlapping
sequence there are three possible phases, that is, ways of
placing codon positions coupled to one another. Depending on which codon positions are complementary in an
overlap, the effect of DNA mutations on the two genes can
be different. We make use of the following notation for
the different phases [17]. For codirectional overlaps we
shall indicate the three phases as (123:123), (123:231),
(123:312), depending on whether the first codon base of
the first gene is also the first, second, or third codon base
of the second gene. We use the same notation for codirectional sequences both in the normal and in the complementary strand, although the orientation of the two genes
is opposite in the two cases. For overlapping genes of type

convergent and divergent the three phases are (123:321),
(123:132), and (123:213). As in the previous section we
do not include embedded genes in order to avoid ambiguities. For each type of overlap, we compute the percentage
of overlaps in each phase. Table 2 shows the result of this
analysis. Before commenting on this table, recall that
many overlaps have a length equal to 4, as a result of a
match between start and stop codons or between two stop
codons in complementary strands (see Fig. 6). In Table 3
we have repeated the analysis of the different phases by
restricting the analysis to overlaps longer than 4 nucleotides. The comparison of Tables 2 and 3 illustrates the
importance of excluding overlaps of length 4 bp from this
analysis, as their high incidence biases the relative phase
frequencies. Moreover, we find an inversion of phase
occurrence in codirectional overlaps in Firmicutes as a
consequence of the reduced occurrence of overlaps of
length 4 in species belonging to this clade.
For codirectional overlapping genes longer than 4 bp the
empirical analysis suggests that (i) there are essentially no
overlaps of phase (123:123). This is reasonable as the stop
codon of the first gene is translated in frame through the
second gene and this would lead to a premature termination of transcription of the second gene. (ii) The phase
(123:231) is less frequent than the (123:312) phase. This
is true on average (Table 3) but it is also systematically
true for all the genomes. This result is quite surprising as
these two phases are in some sense indistinguishable from

the statistical perspective of the distribution of paired
nucleotides. In both phases a first nucleotide complements a third nucleotide, a first complements a second
nucleotide, and the remaining pair comprises a second
and a third nucleotide.
For overlapping genes on different strands (type convergent and divergent) we observe two different patterns.
Convergent sequences are more frequently observed in
the phase (123:132) whereas divergent sequences are
more frequent in phase (123:213). It is worth noting at
this point that the phase frequencies indicated in Table 2
and 3 are also observed when we restrict the analysis to
those overlapping sequences shared by at least two species.
We now consider phase preference as a function of overlap length. We have analyzed the distribution of overlap
lengths, investigating independently different phases of
overlap. In the right panel of Figure 8 we show the histogram of the number of occurrences of different phases of
overlap as a function of overlap length. Since fluctuations
in the histogram are large, we investigate overlap length
distribution for alternative phases using a different
method. Specifically in the right panel of figure 8 we plot
the quantity p(f|ᐍ > x), the probability of observing one of

the three phases f1, f2, and f3 in an overlap of a configuration (codirectional, convergent, and divergent) conditioned on the constraint that the overlap is longer than x
base pairs. The three phases are plotted relative to their
configuration through a normalization for each value of x,
i.e. p(f1|ᐍ > x) + p(f2|ᐍ > x) + p(f3|ᐍ > x) = 1. Interestingly,
the curves for the codirectional overlapping sequences
display a crossing at length ~75 base pairs. There are more
than 300 codirectional sequences longer than 75 bp. For
sequences shorter than this value the phase (123:312) is
more frequent than the phase (123:231), whereas for
longer sequences the order is reversed. Similarly for convergent sequences the conditional frequencies tend to
equality for very large overlap. Finally for divergent overlaps, no crossing is observed.
3.2.1 Phylogenetic patterns in phase statistics
In the preceding section we found that phase is strongly
dependent on the polarity of transcription of the overlapping genes. We also observe a phylogenetic determinant
(see Fig. 9). Among those species possessing co-directional overlap phase (123:231) the firmicutes and cyanobacteria are rare. Members of the Archaeota and
Proteobacteria are better represented. For overlap phase
(123:312) there are many firmicutes. There are very few
species of any clade possessing phase (123:123). For convergent overlap the Archeaota are the most abundantly
represented clade for both (123:132) and (123:321)
phases. The two species, Aquifex aeolicus and Thermotoga
maritima also possess a high frequency of genes in these
two phases. The species Pseudomonas aeruginosa has a very
high abundance of phase (123:213). Among the remaining clades only a few cyanobacteria show evidence of a
convergent overlap above the prokaryotic average. For
divergent overlaps the pattern is very similar to the convergent case with only a few species behaving contrary to
their clade, in particular Mycobacterium tuberculosis has an
elevated frequency of (123:213) in comparison to the
Actinobacteria, whereas Caulobacter crescentus is elevated
in (123:321) in comparison to the remaining Alpha-proteobacteria. Overall, co-directional overlap would seem to
be a more ancestral form of organization than convergent
and divergent where we find a larger number of unique
derived instances in the species distribution.

4 The 3-fold evolutionary dynamic
Microbes are distinguished by their enormous abundance
and by the rapid rate at which they replicate. Both of these
features make demands on the organization and regulation of the genome. Competition in large population sizes
typically selects for fast and efficient replication and this
in turn requires that protein synthesis is rapid and low
cost. One very general mechanism for propagating information at a high rate is data compression, a technique
indispensable in computer technology, whereby redun-

lengths [6]. In this study we have analysed an evolved
form of data compression, namely, the properties of overlapping genes in a large set of 58 fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes. Both prokaryotes and phage are known to
exploit overlap extensively [11]. We have organized our
research into three sets of evolutionary questions. First:
how do overlaps come about and by what mutational
process, and how do these mutations bias the conserved
overlap lengths and phases that we observe in the database? Second: for highly conserved patterns of overlap
shared by multiple lineages, how can we explain regular
patterns in the data accruing through immediate benefits
to an individual genome? Third: among those patterns of
overlap that do not relate to immediate benefits (rates of
replication or expression) but do have implications for
population variability, is the data consistent with neutrality, redundancy or amplification?
4.1 Stochastic Origination
We corroborate earlier studies showing that the modal
number of overlapping nucleotides is equal to 4 and that
these 4 nucleotides frequently overlap initiation and termination codons of contiguous genes, or the termination
codons of complementary overlaps. This suggests that
neutral point mutation is an important mechanism for
promoting overlapping genes. We directly test the stop
codon mutation (SCM) mechanism by performing a
detailed case study of Escherichia coli overlapping
sequences.

The SCM mechanism promotes the formation of an overlap through a single nucleotide mutation within a stop
codon. Consider two consecutive, non-overlapping genes
in the same or in complementary strands. The stop codon
of one of the two genes mutates (or is deleted) and this
leads to a read-through until a new stop codon is encountered in the down-stream gene creating a sequence of
overlap. Let us assume as a null hypothesis that the function of the new gene is not altered by the elongation of the
first sequence. Can we estimate the expected length and
phase properties of the overlap? The probability that the
overlap length is longer than x codons, i.e. y = 3x nucleotides, is equal to the probability that all x codons
encountered in the read-through are different from a stop
codon. We indicate with p the probability that a codon is
different from a stop codon, and we conclude that p(overlap length > 3x) = px i.e.

where yc ≡ -3/ln(p). This argument illustrates that one
might expect from this simple model an exponential distribution of overlap lengths. This is not observed in our
data. In Figure 2 we illustrate the empirical overlap length
distribution and the best fit of the distribution to an exponential function exp(-ax) with the same mean. The discrepancy between the two curves indicates that either the
SCM is not the only mutational mechanism generating

sequences or that some additional selective processes have
filtered the variation.

gesting that SCM is the most common mechanism generating this type of overlapping sequence. This result is in
agreement with [33] where the convergent sequences of
Mycoplasma appear to be generated by a stop mutation
mechanism.

The SCM mechanism also makes predictions about the
expected distribution of overlap phases generated by a
stop mutation. As a result of the bias in the codon distribution of a species, it is more likely that the read-through
process finds a new stop codon in some phases over others. Consider two codirectional genes in an E. coli genome
and further suppose that the stop codon of an upstream
gene mutates with the read-through continuing until a
new stop codon is encountered in the downstream gene.
In E. coli there are three stop codons, TAA, TAG and TGA.
We indicate with P(XYZ) the empirical frequency of a
codon XYZ. By assuming that consecutive codons behave
independently, the probability of finding a stop codon in
a given phase can be calculated. For example, the probability of finding TGA in phase (123:312) is calculated via
the sum:

∑

P( XTG )

X ∈ A ,C ,G ,T

∑

P( AYZ ).

Y , Z ∈ A ,C ,G ,T

A related question is whether the usage of stop codons is
the same for overlapping and non-overlapping genes. To
this end we have divided the set of genes into three subsets: (i) Genes with a 3' end not involved inn the overlap
(but where the 5' end can be overlapping). (ii) Genes with
a 3' end involved in a codirectional overlap (where the
gene is upstream of the overlap). (iii) Genes with a 3' end
involved in a convergent overlap. We then counted the
total number of the three different stop codons for the
three subsets. The left part of Table 5 shows the fraction of
genes in the three subsets for E. coli. It is evident that the
usage is quite different in the different sets. Part of this difference could be a direct result of short overlaps. For
example in set (ii) (codirectional overlaps), TGA could
favored through a matching of stop and start codon at the
ATGA tetramer. Table 5 set (ii) has a percentage of TGA of
68% compared to the 24% for non overlapping genes. To
take into account this bias we now only consider overlaps
longer than 4 bp where a matching of start and stop
codons is excluded. The right part of Table 5 shows the frequencies in this restricted set. The stop codon usage is now
more similar for across the sets.

(2)

The predicted probabilities are shown in Table 4.
Table 4 shows the frequencies of the observed phases of
overlapping sequences for E. coli and the expected frequencies according to the SCM mechanisms. For codirectional overlapping genes we find that sequences longer
than 5 bp in phase (123:231) comprise 32% and phase
(123:312) 68%. The SCM mechanism predicts approximately equal frequencies for the two phases (54% and
46%, respectively). This discrepancy suggests that the stop
mutation mechanism cannot be the only mechanism promoting overlapping sequences in the same strand. In Figure 8 we observe that short sequences on the same strand
are more frequent in (123:312) phase, whereas long
sequences are more frequent in (123:231) phase. Table 4
suggests that long sequences on the same strand are more
likely to be generated by the SCM mechanism.

In order to determine the statistical significance of the
observed differences in stop codon usage for each genome
we perform χ2 tests. Specifically we took take (i) as a reference and tested whether set (ii) and set (iii) have the same
distribution of stop codon usage as set (i). We independently analyze the set including all possible overlap lengths
from the set of overlaps longer than 4 bp. From the 58
genomes we are able to perform the test on at most 52
because the remaining 6 bacteria use only 2 different stop
codons. We adopt a 99% confidence for significance.
When we consider the set of all possible overlap lengths
we find that for 98% of the genomes (51/52) we are reject
the hypothesis that set (ii) has an equal stop codon distribution as set (i) and for 48% (19/40) genomes we reject
the hypothesis that set (iii) has an equal stop codon usage
as set (i). For the set of overlaps longer than 4 bp we find

The origin of convergent sequences can be tested only
with the SCM mechanism for which a simple statistical
model can be derived. Table 4 shows a good agreement
between the observed and the expected frequencies, sug-

codon mutation hypothesis (SCM).

that for 65% (34/52) of the genomes we reject the hypothesis that set (ii) has an equal stop codon distribution to set
(i) and for 35% (13/37) genomes we reject the hypothesis
that set (iii) has an equal stop codon usage to set (i).
In conclusion, when taking into account genome individuality and possible biases introduced by a coupling
between start and stop (or two stop) codons, we find that
stop codon usage is different for overlapping and non
overlapping genes. This effect is stronger for codirectional
than for convergent genes. This difference could provide
some useful insights into the the origin of overlapping
genes.
4.2 Immediate Benefits
While stochastic processes involving mutation and frameshifts can explain some of the variation in the data, they
are not able to explain certain widespread, conserved features. We observe that short overlapping genes frequently
arise on the same strand, presumably to encourage translational coupling among coregulated genes in an operon.
We also find long overlaps in complementary strands,
which would serve to reduce the number of nucleotides
required to encode two or more proteins.

In prokaryotes genomes, around 30% of all genes are
involved in some degree of overlap, reaching an extreme
value of 56% in the species Aquifex aeolicus and Thermotoga maritima. The mean length of the overlapping
sequences is 26 base pairs, whereas the modal value is 4
base pairs. These 4 base pairs can occur as overlaps on a
single strand in which case the termination and initiation
codons overlap, or in complementary strands in which
case complementary termination codons overlap. We find
that a greater proportion of overlaps are in a single strand.
These observations argue in favor of overlap promoting
regulatory compression within co-regulated gene complexes of a strand, in particular within operons. This is the
position advocated in recent research [10] emphasizing
the high frequency of 4 nucleotide overlaps. Regulatory
compression is achieved by having the overlapping
sequence play a dual termination and initiation role, and
eliminates the time delay associated with the initiation
phase of protein synthesis by promoting translational
coupling [34,20]. Futhermore, the importance of regula-

tion in overlap is suggested by the observation that the
least frequent of the overlapping configurations is divergent, in which the 5' upstream portion of each gene is
overlaping and the 3' downstream portion non-overlapping. This configuration potentially places both the ShineDelgarno motif and the initiation codon in the overlapping portion of the sequence. Since both of these require
specific motifs, they constrain the evolution of their complementary genes in the overlap. In the non-overlapping
paired gene control, convergent and divergent are indistinguishable. Thus regulatory elements constrain the prefered overlapping configurations. An additional
observation is that convergent and divergent overlaps are
both more frequent in the Archaea than in the Bacteria,
whereas in the non-overlapping controls these domains
(or superkingdoms) are indistinguishable. Recent results
suggest an additional form of regulation, whereby overlapping genes in complementary strands are capable of
reciprocal regulation through formation of complementary anti-sense transcripts in prokaryotes [5] and also
somewhat surprisingly in eukaryotes [7] and vertebrates
[21].
While these data corroborate an important function and
constraint on overlap derived from regulatory considerations, we also find evidence for replicative compression.
Long overlapping sequences occur frequently (the mean
overlap length is significantly larger than the mode), and
very often appear on complementary strands which are
independently regulated. The importance of replicatory
compression is further supported by the fact that the
shorter genomes also have a higher proportion of overlapping genes and a reduced fraction of non coding DNA.
Shorter genomes also possess a greater proportion of overlapping genes of shorter length than their non-overlapping orthologues (Figure 4). The tendency of organelle
and microbial genomes to eliminate all extraneous nucleotide material has been termed genomic reduction, and is
well documented in mitochondria and virus genomes
where pressures on replication rates are at a premium
[35]. A similar tendency has been recently reported for a
free-living prokaryote [36]. These results together with our
findings are suggestive of a role for overlap promoting
genomic reduction.
4.3 Variational Benefits
Overlapping genes also vary in their preferred phases;
when the overlapping genes are independently translated,
mutations of large effect are encouraged. Contrariwise,
longer overlapping sequences tend to favor phases where
redundancy is maximized.

To address the questions of the variational properties of
overlapping sequences, we need to examine the phase of
overlapping genes. As a result of the triplet assignment

Page 16 of 22
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:22

rules of the canonical genetic code, genes can overlap in 6
different phases. In genes that are encoded in a single
strand, these can be written as (123:123), (123:312) and
(123:231) [9]. These describe the virtual base pairings in
the context of the overlapping codons. In the first phase,
the bases are perfectly aligned, and this phase is almost
never observed. In the second phase, the most significant
base (MSB) of the upstream gene (base 2) pairs with the
intermediate significant base (ISB) of the downstream
gene (base 1), while the least significant base (LSB = base
3), pairs with the MSB. We use MSB, ISB and LSB to
describe the relative degeneracy of codon positions.
Notice that mutations to the genes are going to be asymmetrical with respect to strand, with synonymous mutations to the LSB of the upstream gene causing a change at
the MSB of the downstream one, whereas mutations to
the LSB of the downstream gene alter the ISB of the
upstream. In the third phase, the situation is again asymmetrical, but in this case the properties of the upstream
gene are those of the downstream and vice versa.
We find that for codirectional overlaps, (123:312) is the
most common at shorter overlaps, whereas (123:231)
becomes more frequent at the longest overlaps. Can we
understand this in terms of mutational susceptibility? For
the sake of argument and without loss of generality, we
make the following assumptions. The probability per
nucleotide per generation of mutation is µ. The probability that the mutation is non-synonymous at the MSB is
equal to 1. The probability of non-synonymous mutation
at the ISB is equal to ε, where 0 <ε < 1, And the probability
at the LSB is equal to 0. Let us further assume that the
effects of mutations on phenotypes are multiplicative,
such that the phenotype of a genome with i mutations is
given by (1 - p)i, where p is the average phenotypic effect
of an amino acid substitution. This provides us with a
metric with which we can compare phenotypes to the
wildtype which assumes a phenotypic value of 1. If we
assume a single point mutation to a sequence, then the
average phenotype of a genome with an overlapping proportion of nucleotides ρ in phase (123:312), can be calculated as follows. Mutations at the first nucleotide position
of an overlapping triplet lead to substitution probabilities
in the two genes, ε and 0, at the second position 1 and ε,
and the third position 0 and 1. The expected phenotype of
a sequence with a single mutation falling in the overlapping sequence with a per genome per generation probability ρµ, is then equal to:
F+1 =
p)]

1
[(1 - p)ε + (1 - ε) + (ε(1 - p)2 + (1 - ε)(1 - p)) + (1 3
(3)

A similar value can be calculated for (123:231):

F+2 =

ε)]

1
[(ε(1 - p)2 + (1 - ε)(1 - p)) + (1 - p) + (1 - p)ε + (1 3
(4)

Where F+i indexes a positive translational offset i in the
same strand. These are identical and hence on the basis of
the changing phenotypes induced by mutations to overlapping sequences, there is no reason to expect any difference in the frequencies of these two phases.
What then is the cause of the observed difference in phase
frequency? We discussed in Section VI a possible explanation in terms of mutational mechanisms producing overlapping sequences. We also find that for those overlaps
longer than 150 bp, the frequencies of the codirectional
phases invert. We have yet to understand this trend (see
also Section VI).
In the convergent and divergent configurations two
regimes are observed. For overlaps shorter than ~50 bp the
most common phase is the (123:132) (see Fig. 8). For
longer overlaps, the phase (123:213) becomes increasingly more common (together with (123:321)).
We can write down the expected phenotype functions for
each of the three phases negatively offset in the complementary strand:F-2, F-1, F-0, corresponding to the phases
(123:132), (123:213), (123:321):
F-2 =

F-1 =

F-0 =

After some algebra we find that,
F-1 ≤ F-2 ≤ F-0

(8)

This states that the phenotypic effect associated with
phase (123:213) is the least robust. This is expected
because this phase couples the MSB of one gene with the
ISB of the other. Thus two out of three three times a mutation is non synonymous in at least one gene and the mutation is non synonymous in both genes with probability
2ε/3. This result helps us to understand why phase
(123:213) is the least frequently observed (Table 3). The
frequencies of the other two phases are in contrast with
what expected from Eq. 8. In fact Eq. 8 suggests that phase

Biology Direct 2007, 2:22

(123:321) (corresponding to F-0) should be more frequent than phase (123:132) (corresponding to F-2)
whereas Table 3 shows that the the reverse is observed in
real genomes.

5 Conclusion
The analysis of overlapping sequences indicates that more
than one mechanism is likely to be responsible for the origin and maintenance of these genomic traits. Not only do
overlapping genes preserve features relating to their mutational origin, but secondary features relating to ongoing
selection pressures. When two genes are on the same
strand a mutation in the stop codon seems to be largely
responsible for long overlaps. When two genes are in different strands the stop codon mechanism helps in
explaining the abundance of different phases but we
require additional selective hypotheses to explain phase
variation. Our essential conclusions can be stated as follows:
1. When correcting for codon bias, both short overlaps –
modal length 4 – and single strand usage can partly be
accounted for in terms of the stochastic process of mutations to stop and start codons. This suggests a role for neutral processes in promoting gene overlap.
2. The preponderance of short overlaps in operons suggests an important role for translational coupling promoting overlapping sequences for efficient gene regulation.
This is evidence for selection promoting regulatory compression through overlap.
3. Selection for genome minimization can be gleaned
from shorter genomes containing a larger frequency of
overlapping genes whose average length is less than that
of their non-overlapping orthologues. This is evidence for
selection promoting replicative compression through
overlap.
4. The most common overlap phases promote redundant
base pairings that can not be explained in terms of neutral
mutations in the presence of codon bias. This suggests a
role for selective contraints on coding sequences, promoting greater mutational robustness.
5. The persistence of many non-redundant phases in long
sequences suggests some selection pressures for amplifying the effects of point mutations in these genes. This
could reflect either selection for highly efficient purging of
deleterious mutations or a mechanism for promoting
high diversity under variable conditions.
6. Overlap length is a strong predictor of some overlap
phases but this variation can not be explained in terms of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/22

the redundancy properties of each phase – both long and
short phases can have the same error-buffering properties.
7. Long overlaps are a feature of many prokaryotic species
and manifest a tendency towards a reduction in abundance over the course of evolution. This suggests the
hypothesis that overlapping genes were a more common
feature of ancestral prokaryotes.
8. There is considerable clade variation in phase preference, but very few species ever make use of the more mutationally deleterious phases.
9. Co-directional overlapping genes appear to be an
ancestral genome trait whereas convergent and divergent
configurations appear to be more derived.
These data collectively illustrate how much information
can be compressed into a genome by exploiting the
codon-based triplet code, and how variation in compression phases exists in relation to different selection pressures and modes of gene origination. Overlap is just one
of several mechanisms organisms employ to create one to
many maps from transcription to translation overcoming
the collinearity constraint (1-gene 1-protein). Some alternatives are RNA editing [37] and post translational
procesing. An additional source of multiple-coding, at
least for recognition sites, derives from pressures reducing
mutation load at high recombination rates [38]. In all
cases, the combinatoric flexibility afforded by the transcription and translational mechanisms allow for adaptive information to be added to that provided by the
underlying linear sequence. The linear sequence is
revealed to be an expedient structure for storage purposes
rather than a true measure of the total information content of the genome.

Reviewers' comments

Health.

1. Overlapping genes are an old and appealing topic, tracing back to the startling discovery of 'genes within genes'
in small bacteriophages by Sanger et al. back in 1977.
However, the subsequent history of the study of this phenomenon has been somewhat anticlimactic because it
turns out that long overlaps are, after all, not that common in cellular life forms (or even in viruses with larger
genomes), and the longest ones reported have the
unpleasant habit to go away as artifacts. However, the
apparent lack of a truly essential biological role of overlaps – beyond very short overlaps involved in regulatory
compression as discussed in the present paper – is not to

diminish their theoretical interest. Even if the sequences
of overlap are rather short, they do carry two messages in
the same string of nucleotides, and an extensive analysis
of such sequences on genome scale has the potential to
reveal aspects of selection and neutrality that escape our
attention in the study of "normal" genes.

or adaptive processes in their evolution. However, I think
it is rather important to explain right away the range of the
phenomenon and to make distinction between viral overlapping genes where many occasions of actual "genes
within genes" and prokaryotic overlaps that are (predominantly) very short.

The paper of Lillo and Krakauer is, to my knowledge, the
most comprehensive and nuanced analysis of this kind to
date, and beyond any doubt, will be a useful addition to
the literature. Of course, I do have a variety of comments
that might be of some use for revision or could just help
the interested reader to become better oriented in this
rather complex tangle of problems.

We elected to not treat cases of embedded overlapping genes in
this study. This is because we sought those cases where controls
based on non-overlapping orthologues could be used in the analysis. Embedded genes are a fascinating topic as they often make
additional demands on the post-transcriptional machinery, and
as stated, are used extensively in viruses.

2. First a couple of very general issues. The work would
greatly benefit from a more extensive and more explicit
analysis of the evolutionary conservation of overlapping
regions (ORs). This would make a lot of sense both methodologically, by increasing the reliability of the results,
and substantively. Indeed, it is interesting to see how the
evolutionary conservation varies among different orientations and phases of ORs, are there some ORs that are conserved in a broad range of prokaryotes, and more
questions like that.
More or less along similar lines, it would make sense to
present more information on possible lineage-specific
trends in ORs. Is there some interesting biology here or are
the characteristics of ORs just a function of genome size
and gene density? If it is the latter, it is worth illustrating
and stating explicitly. All the more so if it is the former.
As we show in this paper, using some careful controls, long overlaps are in fact far more common than is thought. While short
overlaps can be reasonably easily explained in terms of an ongoing legacy of neutral mutations, modest genome minimization
and regulatory compression, long overlaps make a strong case
for replicative compression. As is shown in figure 2, the length
distribution function indicates clearly how the longest overlap
lengths exceed the expectations of the an exponential distribution with the same mean.
With regard to lineage-specific trends, we include an explicit
phylogenetic component by tracing several features of overlapping genes through a consensus prokaryotic phylogeny making
use of squared change parsimony. This allows us to track varying degrees of conservation, and to identify lineages in which
changes to the genes have been more recent or derived. We also
consider a more restricted dataset including only overlaps
formed by pairs of genes that are conserved in at least two species and in this way seek to minimize curatorial artifacts.
3. In the Background section, the authors discuss the
mutational origins of overlaps and the interplay of neutral

4. Variational benefits...this is an old, somewhat tired
issue on the reality of "evolution of evolvability", evolution having no foresight etc etc. The authors present this
as a fully legitimate, regular evolutionary force. Perhaps,
some extra caution and more discussion are due.
We have pointed out that variation in phase can not be
explained exclusively in terms of either regulatory or immediate
benefits. There is an ongoing effect of mutational origin on the
statistics of phase usage, but this is also unable to explain a significant portion of the variation. What does seem more likely is
that phases that are preferred have mutational properties that
are either conservative – more redundant, or are amplifying –
increase the amino acid replacement probability. Both of these
strategies are consistent with robustness arguments, in which
genomes are either buffered from genetic variation or more efficiently purged in a clonal quasispecies. It is also possible of
course that increased variation can come under positive selection, in which case this would constitute an evolveability
hypothesis. With the current evidence we are unable to discriminate between the previous possibilities and we do not use the
term evolveable although the hypothesis remains very much in
play. We think that evolveability could be particularly interesting in microbes where population sizes are typically large and
where indirect selective effects are thus able to exert a significant influence on adaptation. The existence of the mutator genotypes provide compelling evidence for this possibility.
5. The issue of selection for genome compression – not
regulatory compression (with which I have no problem)
but replication rate. This is very obvious and one of the
first things that comes to mind when one considers the
raison d'etre for overlaps. But is it real or, at least, is it particularly important and general? How much sequence can
be actually saved through overlaps? Fig. 2a shows values >
10 kb for 5 genomes; whether this is a lot or not really
depends on the size of the respective genomes (by the
way, is it worth to show the same data after normalizing
by genome size?) One can sort of get the hang of it by
comparing Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b but it is not, exactly,
straightforward. In any case, for the great majority of the

Page 19 of 22
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:22

genomes, the total length of the overlaps is much less. I
understand it is no easy question but could there be any
way to assess the selective advantages conferred by this
amount of compression against the obvious disadvantages of overlaps (assuming they are not subject to other
types of selection)? Also, if compression is so important,
why no genes within genes? We know from viruses that
this is not impossible.
This is now dealt with fairly explicitly in the text and the conclusions. The question of the magnitude of replicative benefit,
ideally measured in terms of replication rates in culture, is difficult to quantify using only published sequence data. Having
said this, it is instructive to note that around 3% of all genes
are involved in overlap with a mean overlap length of 26 base
pairs. In some species this percentage can be over 50%. The
sum of all overlapping regions is on average 0.2% of the total
genome length.
6. The rather notorious issue of long overlaps. It is possible that I am overly cautious but I am worried over the
right tail of the distribution in Fig. 1b. Clearly, there are
only a few points in this area, and even a small number of
artifacts would sway the curve away from the exponent. At
least, I think this issue should be given more attention.
In the revised version we give more attention to this issue by
considering a set of highly conserved ORs. See point 4 above
and the new panel in Fig. 2.
7. The explanation of the striking under-representation of
divergent overlaps given on p. 11 (and in ref. [25]) is,
probably, correct. The point, I believe is that the constellation of regulatory elements that are required for the initiation of both transcription and translation is much more
demanding than that required for termination. Hence the
strong purifying selection against divergent but not so
much against convergent overlaps. By the way, an interesting thing to check: are convergent overlaps in prokaryotes
seen primarily in genes with rho-dependent or rho-independent termination? Sequence requirements for the two
are very different.
We discuss this interesting problem in relation to the rho-independent terminators and convergent overlaps in E. coli. As the
text indicates at least for E. coli there remains a relatively large
number of sequence-dependent termination motifs even in overlapping sequences.
8. In the discussion of phase frequencies – relating to the
issue of long overlaps once again. I am very worried about
the "crossing" at length 75. How many points there, after
all?

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/22

In the revised version we make this number clear and include
the sentence 'There are more than 300 codirectional ORs
longer than 75 bp'
9. In the conclusions it would be desirable to indicate
that, alas, there is no good way to distinguish between the
adaptationist and neutral explanations or any combination thereof. Under these circumstances, is it not prudent
to take the neutral explanation as the null hypothesis?
As the paper shows there seems to be evidence for all three kinds
of evolutionary explanation. While we agree that neutral
hypotheses constitute an appropriate null model, we do find
many patterns at odds with neutrality, from the most modest 4base pair overlaps in operons, through to variation in phase
preference in long overlapping sequences. We have tried to
make these distinctions as clear as possible.

1. taxonomy: The position of the hyperthermophilic bacteria is, in my opinion, not resolved. Gene content

Aquifex with the Proteobacteria, or at least at their root.
Proteobacteria, and Thermotoga with the Firmicutes. That
position of Aquifex would fit "better" their high level of
overlapping genes which they share with the Proteobacteria. In line with this, I would be careful with the remark
about the primitiveness of the overlapping organization,
as you are, as far as I understand also referring to your
results on the Archaea (not Archaeota) here. And there is
no reason to assume that they are primitive.
We have endeavored to be cautious in the interpretation of the
phylogenetically reconstructed patterns, largely because the status of the phylogeny remains somewhat ambiguous. Our tree is
simply an 'all the evidence' super-tree which at the very least
tells us that overlapping genes have been around as long as some
of the most ancestral clades in the prokaryotic group.
2. with respect to Figure 8: please give a histogram, not a
"longer than" plot. The former would give us a better
impression of the strength of the signal and the amount of
data supporting it.
We have added a panel to figure 8containing the histogram of
the number of occurrences.
3. with respect to the phylogeny: do you observe any conservation of overlaps: i.e. rather than counting them, do
the same genes overlap in phylogenetically "close" species. I guess it goes beyond the analyses in this paper, but

Page 20 of 22
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:22

there have been a lot of analyses done on the rate at which
gene order is "randomized" in Bacteria and Archaea, also
with respect to gene order. Phylogenetic conservation is
always a strong argument for selection.
While a detailed study of all 58 genomes for conserved
sequences would be beyond the scope of this project, the analysis
of pairs of closely related genomes, such as in the study [10]does
support conservation.
4. For table 5: did you take the codon bias in E. coli into
account?
Yes, the expected fractions are computed by using the codon bias
observed in E. coli
5. Conclusion 2: Are in all cases of overlapping co-directional gene pairs both genes indeed in the same operon?
Either rephrase, or examine the available operon data, e.g.
for E. coli.
F is this the case?
6. page 21: what does population size have to do with the
rate of replication? Do know that Archaea are quite a bit
slower in their replication than e.g. E. coli, and also in the
Bacteria the differences are huge with some Bacteria (e.g.
plantomycetes) having lower replication rates than some
eukaryotes like yeast.
The point here is simply that prokaryote effective population
sizes tend to be large and that this will make selection more efficient.

1. The study by Lillo and Krakauer represents a very comprehensive analysis of overlapping genes in prokaryotes.
In particular, the carefully designed statistical analyses on
the length and strand of overlapping sequences provides
important insights into how different selective forces (i.e.
genome minimization and co-regulation efficiency)
shaped the evolution of overlapping genes. Overall, I
think this is a valuable study that advances our understanding about the evolution of prokaryote genomes.
2. The authors presented the observation that no codirectional (123:123) phase was found as one of major results.
Is it due to the bias in our current genome annotation?
When a shorter ORF is embedded in a longer ORF with
the same reading frame, only the longer one is reported. I
also noticed that the embedded genes were not included

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/22

in the dataset from the beginning. Thus, by definition, the
codirectional (123:123) phase was excluded.
This is correct. We chose to study only non-embeded overlaps in
order to arrive at a better understanding of differential patterns
of phase usage.
3. The study specifically tested the stop codon mutation
mechanism, where a mutation in a stop codon leads to
read-through, thereby making two genes overlapped. But
there is another alternative mechanism: a novel start
codon can be created by mutations at the upstream of the
second gene, leading to overlapping sequences. Discussion or further analysis on this aspect would be very helpful. The thing is that mutations occur without knowledge
of translation orientation, and only their effects are evaluated by selection.
We have wrestled with this problem from the very start of this
project. In one earlier version of the manuscript we had a section dealing explicitly with predictions derived from a model of
ribosomal frame-shifting. This was eventually removed as there
are numerous different motifs that are able to promote a ribosomal skip, and we found that we were unable to calculate the
null expectation for overlapping genes under this mechanisms
without a full look-up table of these sequences. The logic that
you describe we share and this process is often observed in the
process of differential gene translation in RNA viruses such as
HIV. See section on stochastic origination
4. It is well known that there is a strong bias on stop codon
usage and flanking nucleotide composition in most
genomes. The comparison on stop codon usage (also
flanking nucleotide bias) between overlapping and normal genes may generate some interesting results.
This is an interesting observation, and we have analyzed patterns of stop codon usage in both overlapping and non-overlapping genes. There are some differences, but we are not able to
provide an explanation in this paper.
