Abstract
Background: Subtilisin-like proteases (SLPs) form a superfamily of enzymes that act to degrade
protein substrates. In fungi, SLPs can play either a general nutritive role, or may play specific roles
in cell metabolism, or as pathogenicity or virulence factors.
Results: Fifteen different genes encoding SLPs were identified in the genome of the grass
endophytic fungus Epichloë festucae. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these SLPs belong to four
different subtilisin families: proteinase K, kexin, pyrolysin and subtilisin. The pattern of intron loss
and gain is consistent with this phylogeny. E. festucae is exceptional in that it contains two kexinlike genes. Phylogenetic analysis in Hypocreales fungi revealed an extensive history of gene loss and
duplication.
Conclusion: This study provides new insights into the evolution of the SLP superfamily in
filamentous fungi.

Background
Proteases catalyse the cleavage of polypeptides to oligopeptides or amino acids. In fungi, aspartic, cysteine,
metallo-, serine and threonine proteases, as well as
uncharacterised classes of proteases, have been identified,
which have been classified according to the amino acid
residues required for catalytic activity [1]. The serine proteases represent the most well known class, with two
major superfamilies: subtilisin-like proteases (SLPs) and
the trypsins. Both superfamilies use the same catalytic
triad (Asp-His-Ser), which is thought to have evolved
through convergent evolution [2].
Subtilisin-like proteases (SLPs) are ubiquitous in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Six families of SLPs have been iden-

tified [3]: subtilisins, proteinase K-type, thermitases,
kexins, lantibiotic peptidases and pyrolysins. Phylogenomic analyses suggest three families of subtilisin-like
proteases are present in fungi [4]. The first family, known
as proteinase K-type, was first identified in fungi and
named for its similarity to the widely known Tritirachium
album proteinase K [5]. These proteases are generally characterised by the presence of subtilisin N-terminal domain
containing the propeptide, which is thought to act as an
intramolecular chaperone to assist protein folding as well
as inhibit enzyme activity [6,7], and a catalytic peptidase
S8 domain. Phylogenetic analyses suggest subfamilies 1
and 2 of this family contain secreted proteases, whereas
subfamily 3 contains intracellular proteases localised to
the vacuole [4]. The secreted proteases are thought to genPage 1 of 13

erally play a nutritive role [8], but the vacuolar proteases
appear to play a specialised role in the breakdown of
autophagic bodies in the vacuole during autophagy,
allowing recycling of macromolecules during nutrient
starvation [9,10].
The second family of SLPs identified in fungi is the kexins.
Kexins have two major domains: a peptidase S8 catalytic
domain, and a proprotein convertase domain. Kexin-type
enzymes, first identified in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [11], play an important role in post-translational
modification in eukaryotes. Secreted proteins in eukaryotes are often synthesized as preproproteins, which
undergo two proteolytic processing events to become
mature proteins. The prepeptide is normally removed by
a signal peptidase in the endoplasmic reticulum [12]. The
resulting proprotein is then transferred to the Golgi,
where kexin-like enzymes cleave the propeptide to give
the mature protein.
The third class was described as class I, or members of the
subtilisin family [4]. Members of this family in fungi usually have inserts in the catalytic domain, and long carboxyl-terminal extensions, which are both characteristic
of a family described as pyrolysins [3]. However, the pyrolysin family appears to be heterogeneous, with many different accessory domains. The class I subtilisins generally
contain a protease-associated (PA) domain inserted into
the catalytic domain [13], along with a DUF1034 domain
(this study), which has an unknown function.
The subtilisin superfamily is an interesting case study for
the evolution of multigene families. Gene duplication
(and subsequent divergence) along with gene loss are
important contributors to gene family evolution [14,15].
Gene loss can occur through either loss of gene function
due to deleterious mutations or through complete deletion of the gene. There is evidence of extensive gene duplication and loss within the SLP family in fungal lineages,
which has been correlated with differences in fungal lifestyles [4].
In this study, we examined the evolution of the SLP gene
family from the endophytic fungus, Epichloë festucae. This
fungus forms a mutually beneficial association with its
host grass. We were interested in the gene family in this
organism because of its plant symbiotic lifestyle and close
taxonomic relationship to the insect pathogen
Metarhizium anisopliae (both Clavicipitaceae), where SLPs
are important as virulence factors. The availability of other
fungal genomes, especially those from Fusarium, Nectria
and Trichoderma spp. also allows comparisons of SLP family evolution in fungi through gene duplication, loss and
divergence.

Methods
Bacterial strains and plasmids
E. coli strains were grown on LB agar plates, supplemented
with ampicillin (100 μg/mL) where necessary.
Fungal strains and growth conditions
Cultures of Neotyphodium lolii strain Lp19 [16] and E. festucae strain Fl1 (ex cultivar SR3000) were grown and
maintained as described previously [17,18].
Molecular biology techniques
Fungal genomic DNA was isolated from freeze-dried mycelia using previously described methods [19,20]. Plasmid
DNA was isolated and purified by alkaline lysis using
either the Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA 94547, USA) Quantum
plasmid miniprep or midiprep kits or the Roche (Roche
Diagnostics N.Z., Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) plasmid
miniprep kit. Genomic DNA digests were transferred to
positively charged nylon membranes (Roche) by capillary
transfer [21] and fixed by UV crosslinking (120,000 μJ/
cm2) in an Ultraviolet cross-linker Cex-800 (UltraLum,
Inc., Claremont, CA 91711, USA). Filters were probed
with [α32P]-dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; GE Healthcare, Auckland, New Zealand) labeled probes (Additional File 1).
DNA was labeled by primed synthesis with Klenow fragment using a High-Prime kit (Roche). Labeled probes
were purified using ProbeQuant™ columns (GE Healthcare). Membranes were washed and hybridization signals
detected by autoradiography as described previously [22].
Gene cloning strategy
Nine SLP genes were identified in E. festucae Fl1 either
using sequences amplified from the closely related fungal
species N. lolii Lp19 as described previously [39], or
amplified from E. festucae Fl1 genomic DNA with degenerate primers (Additional Files 1 and 2). Probes for these
genes were hybridized to both an E. festucae Fl1 genomic
DNA library and a Southern blot containing restriction
enzyme digests of E. festucae Fl1 genomic DNA. Screening
of the genomic library identified clones containing DNA
of the gene of interest. Southern hybridizations provided
information about the restriction enzyme fragments containing the gene of interest, thus facilitating the subcloning of DNA fragments containing the desired gene. Six
further SLP genes were identified in the genome of
another E. festucae strain, E2368 (Additional file 1).
Library screening
Construction of the N. lolii Lp19 and E. festucae Fl1
genomic DNA libraries screened in this study was
described previously [23,24]. The N. lolii Lp19 genomic
DNA library was screened by plaque hybridization using
standard methods [25]. For the E. festucae Fl1 genomic
library prepared as described in [24], filters arrayed with
DNA from 5088 independent ampicillin-resistant colo-

nies at a 6 × 6 density with double offset (Australian
Genome Research Facility, Melbourne, Australia) were
screened by hybridization with radioactively labeled
probes [25].
Polymerase chain reaction and amplification conditions
Standard PCR amplifications of genomic DNA templates
were carried out in 25 μL reactions containing 10 mM
Tris-HCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM KCl (pH 8.3), 50 μM
of each dNTP, 200 nM of each primer, 0.5 U of Taq DNA
polymerase (Roche) and 5 ng of genomic DNA. The thermocycler conditions used were: 94°C for 2 min; 30 cycles
of 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min per kb,
followed by a final step at 72°C for 5 min.
DNA sequencing
DNA fragments were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide
chain-termination method [26] using Big Dye (Version 3)
chemistry with oligonucleotide primers (Sigma Genosys,
Castle Hill, Australia) specific for pUC118, pGEM-T Easy,
and genomic sequences from N. lolii or E. festucae. Products were separated on either an ABI Prism 377 sequencer
(Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA 02451, USA) or an ABI 3730
analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA 94404,
USA) at the Allan Wilson Centre Genome Service, Massey
University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.
Bioinformatic analyses
Sequence data were assembled into contigs with
SEQUENCHER (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI
48108, USA) version 4.1 and analyzed and annotated
using MacVector 7.2 (MacVector, Inc., Cary, NC 27519,
USA). Sequence comparisons were performed at the
National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
site http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov using the Brookhaven
(PDB), SWISSPROT, GenBank (CDS translation), PIR and
PRF databases employing algorithms for both local
(BLASTX and BLASTP) and global (FASTA) alignments
[27-29]. Potential open reading frames for SLP and
unlinked non-SLP genes were identified using FGENESH,
an HMM-based gene structural prediction using the Fusarium
graminearum
parameters
http:linux1.softberry.coberry.phtml?topic=fgenesh&grp=
ograms&sub group=gfind. There were some instances
where SLPs were not annotated in genome sequences.
TBlastN analysis, using a conserved region of the peptidase S8 domain as the query sequence, was used to identify all putative SLPs in genome sequences. Where
additional SLP genes were identified they were included
in the analysis. The presence of signal peptides was analyzed using SignalP3.0 [30]. Polypeptide alignments were
performed using ClustalW [31] in MEGA4 [32]).

Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA4 [32].
The evolutionary history was inferred using maximum
likelihood (PhyML)[33]. PhyML was run from the ATGC

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/168

Montpellier Bioinformatics platform at http://www.atgcmontpellier.fr/. The Newick files were imported into
MEGA 4.0 [32] to view the trees which were saved in tif
format. Sequence relationships were inferred using the
Neighbor-joining (N-J) method [34]. The bootstrap N-J
consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates was taken to
represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed
[35]. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in
less than 50% bootstrap replicates were collapsed. The
evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson
correction method [36] and are in the units of the number
of amino acid substitutions per site. All positions containing alignment gaps and missing data were eliminated only
in pairwise sequence comparisons (Pairwise deletion
option).
Assignment of subtilisin-like proteases to different families was done on the basis of domain structure, similarity
to other proteases and grouping in phylogenetic trees.
Proteinase K type enzymes have propeptide and peptidase
S8 domains. Subfamilies sf1, sf2 and sf3 were previously
described [4]. Subfamilies sf4 and sf5 of this group were
assigned on the basis of their phylogenetic grouping. The
pyrolysins have an S8 domain, interrupted by a PA
domain, and a DUF1034 domain. The two subfamilies
within this group were assigned on the basis of previous
work [4]. The OSPs have a peptidase S8 domain and distinct amino acid motifs unique to this family [37].
The following N. lolii and E. festucae sequences have been
submitted to DDBJ/EMBL/Genbank databases: prtA and
prtE (nucleotide accession EU515143/protein accessions

Results and discussion
The E. festucae genome contains fifteen members of the
subtilisin superfamily
Using a combination of PCR amplification and whole
genome analysis, 15 SLPs were predicted in the genome of
the endophytic fungus E. festucae (Figure 1A; Additional
file 3). prtA, prtE, prtB and kexB were initially identified in
N. lolii, an asexual derivative of E. festucae [38]. prtD, prtF,
prtG and prtH were identified in E. festucae strain Fl1 from
sequences amplified with degenerate primers designed to
an alignment of SLP sequences [39]. During this project,

the genome sequence for a closely related strain, E. festucae E2368, became available (C. Schardl, B. Roe, U. Hesse
and J. W. Jaromczyk, unpublished). prtI, prtJ, prtK, prtL,
prtM and kexA were identified from the genome sequence
of this E. festucae strain (Figure 1A). Direct sequencing of
PCR products identified the corresponding genes in E. festucae Fl1. The predicted subtilisin-like protease (SLPs)
genes (prtA and prtB) were identified in a genomic library
from N. lolii [38] (Figure 1A). Probes used to screen the
library were amplified with primers based on the Epichloë
typhina At1 sequence [40]. Another predicted SLP-encoding gene, prtE, was identified directly upstream of the prtA
gene (Figure 1A). Probing a genomic library also identified these three genes in E. festucae Fl1. Isolation of the
prtB gene has been previously described [41]. Further predicted SLP genes were identified in the same library by
screening with PCR products amplified using either primers designed to the E. typhina At1 gene (prtC), or degenerate primers designed to conserved SLP sequences (prtD,
prtF, prtG and prtH) (Figure 1A). The kexB gene, identified
in N. lolii directly downstream of the Nc25 gene [42], was
also identified by probing an E. festucae Fl1 genomic
library (Figure 1A).
The E. festucae subtilisin superfamily members represent
four different families
Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis showed
that the predicted E. festucae SLPs grouped into four of the
six different subtilisin families [3] (Figure 2). Eight genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/168

(prtA, B, C, D, E, F, I and J) encoded predicted proteins
belonging to the proteinase K family (Figure 1B). While
none of the E. festucae SLPs encoded by these prt genes has
been tested for protease activity, the PrtC homologue
from E. typhina, At1, has been shown to have subtilisinlike protease activity [40]. Three subfamilies of proteinase
K-like enzymes have been previously identified, two of
which are extracellular and one that is vacuolar in localization [4]. The predicted prtB, C, E and I gene products
belong to subfamily 1, while the predicted prtA and F gene
products belonged to subfamily 2. As expected based on
its isolation with degenerate primers designed to members of the vacuolar subfamily, the predicted prtD gene
product belongs to subfamily 3. Although the predicted
prtJ gene product was obviously in the proteinase K family, it did not belong to any of the known classes. Instead,
it was found in a new subfamily of proteinase K-type
enzymes we propose to call subfamily 4 (Figures 2 and 5;
Additional file 4). Many other Sordariomycete fungi, as
well as some Orbiliomycetes, contain members of this
subfamily.
Four genes (prtG, H, K and M) are predicted to encode
proteases from the previously described class I or subtilisin family [4]. In fungi, these proteases contain a peptidase S8 domain, generally interrupted by a proteaseassociated (PA) domain, sometimes followed by a
domain of unknown function (DUF1034) at the carboxylterminus. With the exception of PrtG, which is lacking the

PA domain insert, the E. festucae pyrolysin-like enzymes
have this domain structure (Figure 1B). Based on phylogenetic analyses, Hu and St Leger proposed that this family,
which they called subtilisin class I, contained two subfamilies of ascomycete proteins [4]. Phylogenetic analysis
suggested the predicted prtH, K and M gene products
belonged to subfamily 1, whereas the predicted prtG product belonged to subfamily 2 (Figures 2 and 5; Additional
file 5).
These gene products may be part of the pyrolysin family,
in which proteins have long carboxyl-terminal extensions
and large insertions in the catalytic domain [3]. In the
basidiomycete wood rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus, a fungal pyrolysin of this type cleaves and activates other proteases, which in turn cleave and activate laccase
isoenzymes, in an activation cascade [13]. It remains to be
determined if these proteases play similar roles in other
fungi.
Both the PA domain and DUF1034 domains have
unknown functions. The PA domain may play a role in
determining substrate specificity [43], as PA domain
insertion in the catalytic peptidase S8 domain may interfere with the substrate reaching the active site [13]. However, in the C5a peptidase (Streptococcus spp.), which has
a similar domain structure to the fungal pyrolysins, structural analysis suggests the PA domain is not in a position
where it affects substrate specificity [44]. While the function of the DUF1034 domain (PFAM accession PF06280)
is unknown, this domain is often present in bacterial and
plant SLPs.
The predicted kexA and kexB gene products belong to the
kexin family, which contains enzymes with a specialized
role in proprotein processing in the secretory pathway
(Figure 5; Additional file 6). The E. festucae genome is
unusual among ascomycetes in that it contains two kexinlike genes. Like other kexins, the predicted kexA and kexB
gene products both contain putative peptidase S8 and
proprotein convertase (P) domains [3] (Figure 1B). The
putative P domain in both the predicted KexA and KexB
proteins contained an RGD motif, which is conserved in
A. nidulans, A. niger and mammalian furins, but not S. cerevisiae Kex2p [45]. The predicted KexA and KexB proteins
also contained putative serine/threonine-rich and transmembrane regions downstream of the putative P domain,
which are conserved in other kexins. In S. cerevisiae, the
propeptide of the KEX2 gene product is removed by autocatalysis, with cleavage on the carboxyl-terminal side of a
Lys-Arg site [46]. Putative propeptide cleavage sites
appeared in both the predicted KexA (Lys112–Arg113)
and KexB (Arg112–Arg113) proteins.
The predicted prtL gene product did not belong to any of
the subtilisin families previously described in fungi. How-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/168

ever, sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis
suggested it was highly similar to a group of proteases
called the oxidatively stable proteases (OSPs) [37] (Figures 1B and 5; Additional file 7). The OSPs form a subfamily within the subtilisin family [47]. Like other OSPs,
the predicted prtL gene product contained many insertions in the peptidase S8 catalytic domain relative to subtilisin Carlsberg, as well as a carboxyl-terminal extension
of unknown function that may be required for structural
integrity of these enzymes.
Intron conservation
Intron gains and losses are important in the evolution of
gene families [48,49]. Intron position was examined in
the members of the Fl1 SLP genes (Figure 3). Intron positions were predicted by the gene structure prediction program FGENESH. Sequencing of cDNA amplified from the
prtA, prtB, prtE and kexB gene products validated the
FGENESH predictions for these genes. In the proteinase K
family, all of the genes except prtJ had a first intron at a
conserved position (intron position 1, Figure 3A), suggesting all of these genes were derived from a common
ancestral gene. A second intron position was also conserved in prtB, C and E (intron position 2, Figure 3A),
while a third intron position was conserved in prtB, C and
I (intron position 7, Figure 3A) Comparison of the prtI
gene with the orthologous pr1A gene from M. anisopliae
revealed that the second of three introns in the pr1A gene
appears to have been lost from prtI (missing intron position 2, Figure 3A). The loss of this intron, and those
described subsequently (see below) appears to be due to
complete deletion of the intron as there are no apparent
relics of the intron left behind. Consequently, the reading
frame of the gene is not altered. The prtF gene, which is a
homologue of the M. anisopliae pr1J gene, contained two
introns (intron positions 1 and 5, Figure 3A). In the M.
anisopliae strains where pr1J had been sequenced previously, it was suggested an intron was inserted in two
strains, rather than the other strain losing an intron [50].
However, the prtF gene contains both introns in the same
conserved positions as pr1J, suggesting that where pr1J
homologues contained only one intron, this situation has
arisen by intron loss. Intron position was not conserved in
prtJ relative to the other E. festucae genes (intron positions
3, 6, and 7, Figure 3A), but was conserved with closely
related genes such as FGSG_09382 (F. graminearum).

Introns were in conserved positions in three of the four
pyrolysin-type genes (Figure 3B). prtH, K and M have a
first intron at a conserved position (intron 1, Figure 3B),
with a second conserved intron in prtH and prtK, but
apparently lost in prtM (intron position 4, Figure 3B). The
prtG gene did not share any common introns with other
Fl1 pyrolysin-type genes (intron positions 2, 3, 5–14; Figure 3B). Both of the kexin type genes, kexA and kexB, share

sequence (intron position 2, Figure 3C). However, the
kexA gene contained an additional intron in the middle of
the coding sequence (intron position 1, Figure 3C), which
kexB did not share. This additional intron is conserved in
Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium verticillioides and Trichoderma spp., but is not found in other fungal species. This
suggests that the additional intron has been gained in the
Hypocreales lineage. A lack of introns in the prtL gene
excluded it from this analysis.
Synteny analysis
Sequence analysis revealed that four E. festucae Fl1 SLP
genes shared microsynteny with the related fungi Fusarium graminearum, Trichoderma reesei, and in some cases
Neurospora crassa (Figure 4). These genes were kexA, prtD,
prtG and prtK. The kexA (kexin-like) and prtD (vacuolar
SLP) genes have highly specialized functions within the
cell, which may suggest that conservation of the region

around these genes is linked to their conserved function,
a hypothesis supported by an analysis of regions of conserved microsynteny between the genomes of Magnaporthe grisea and Neurospora crassa [51] and other
regions of the E. festucae genome [24,52]. However, the
role of the pyrolysin-like enzymes in fungal cells is not
well understood, so it is unclear what significance the synteny of the prtG and prtK genes may have.
Comparison of the E. festucae SLP family with those from
related fungi
In order to determine how the predicted SLP family in E.
festucae compares with those in other fungal species, a
comprehensive survey of these genes in fungal genomes
was performed. Numbers of predicted SLP-encoding
genes varied from a minimum of three (Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus oryzae), to a maximum of 32 (Trichoderma virens) (Additional file 8). The wide variation

suggested that the processes of gene duplication and loss
have been important in the evolution of this gene family
in fungi.
The numbers of predicted SLP genes did not correlate with
genome size. For instance, Aspergillus clavatus four SLPencoding genes were inferred in a 35 Mb genome, whereas
Nectria haematococca had 29 SLP-encoding genes inferred
in a 40 Mb genome. Generally, saprotrophic fungi had
fewer predicted SLP-encoding genes than the phytopathogenic fungi (Additional file 8); however, a noticeable
exception to this trend was the fact that the phytopathogenic Botrytis cinerea and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum species

both had only four SLP genes each, numbers comparable
to many of the saprotrophic Aspergillus spp.
The types of SLP-encoding genes found in fungal genomes
were also classified. Previously, only three classes of SLPs
had been identified in fungi: proteinase K, kexin, and a
subtilisin-like class. Phylogenetic analyses showed that
there appeared to be other SLP classes in fungi. The class
first represented by the M. anisopliae Pr1C enzyme,
described as subtilisin class I [4], contains several unusual
features. Unlike most subtilisins, the members of this
group often contain an insertion of a protease-associated
domain in the subtilisin catalytic domain, and a domain
of unknown function, DUF1034, in the carboxyl-termiPage 8 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:168

nus. There has been a suggestion that this class of SLPs are
pyrolysins [13], which have large insertions and/or carboxyl terminal extensions [3].
Evolution of the SLP gene family in the Hypocreales
Due to the number of Hypocreales genomes sequenced,
this group is a good model to study the evolution of gene
families, especially for inferring numbers of ancestral
genes and patterns of gene gain and loss. Seven genomes
are available within this group: F. graminearum, F. oxypsorum, F. verticillioides, N. haematococca, T. reesei, Trichoderma virens and E. festucae. Along with data derived from
expression studies in M. anisopliae, this enabled comparisons to be made between SLP-encoding genes in this
group.

The first obvious difference between the genome strains
was the number of predicted SLP-encoding genes. E. festucae had the lowest number of SLP-encoding genes, with
just 15 genes present in the genome. This was about half
the number found in strains such as F. graminearum and
T. virens. These differences are presumably due to either
gene loss in E. festucae, or gene duplication in strains with
high numbers of SLPs. To test this theory, phylogenetic
analysis was used to assess the relationships between the
Hypocreales SLPs (Figure 5, Additional file 9).
In the proteinase K family, a complicated pattern of gene
duplication and loss has occurred. Analyses suggested that
the common ancestor of the Hypocreales must have contained at least six proteinase K type genes, two of which
must have belonged to subfamily 1. In E. festucae Fl1, the
prtE and prtB/prtC/prtI group represent these genes. For the
prtE homologues, a gene duplication event seems to have
occurred in the F. graminearum/F. oxysporum/F. verticillioides lineages, but not in N. haematococca. In the case of the
F. oxysporum and F. verticillioides spp. prtE homologues,
one of the duplicated genes appeared to have lost functionality due to a premature stop codon (FVEG_03737
and FOXG_05860). The prtE homologues appear to have
been lost from the Trichoderma spp. lineages.
The prtB/prtC/prtI group was represented in the Trichoderma spp. as a single gene, but was lost in the Fusarium spp.
and N. haematococca. The gene ancestral to prtB/prtC/prtI
appeared to have undergone extensive gene duplication in
the Clavicipitaceae lineages (E. festucae and M. anisopliae)
to produce prtC (Fl1)/pr1G (M. anisopliae), prtB/pr1I, and
prtI/pr1A, along with a further duplication to give the M.
anisopliae pr1B gene. Pr1A and related enzymes in M. anisopliae are thought to act as virulence factors [53], which
are effectively in an "arms race" with the protease inhibitors of the insect immune system, so these proteases may
have duplicated and diversified to allow the fungi to colonize new hosts. This history of gene duplications is supported by intron position (Figure 3), with the prtB, prtC,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/168

prtE and prtI genes all sharing two common introns, with
a third intron shared by prtB, prtC and prtI.
In proteinase K subfamily 2, there also appears to be three
ancestral genes, represented by the prtF, prtA and
FGSG_03315 (F. graminearum) genes. E. festucae appears
to have lost genes from the FGSG_03315 group, which is
present in one copy in the T. reesei and T. virens genomes,
but in two copies in the N. haematococca and Fusarium spp.
genomes, suggesting that gene duplication has taken place
in the common ancestor of these species. In the prtF
homologues, a single gene is present in all the lineages
except the Trichoderma spp., where gene loss appears to
have occurred, and F. graminearum, where a gene duplication event appears to have taken place. The prtA homologues may have arisen from duplication of one of the
other subfamily 2 genes, as it only contains genes from
Fusarium spp., N. haematococca and the Clavicipitaceae
fungi, E. festucae and M. anisopliae. While the E. festucae
and M. anisopliae genomes contain only a single copy of
this gene, two subsequent gene duplications have taken
place in the Fusarium spp. and N. haematococca species to
give three prtA-like genes for this group.
An unusual case in the M. anisopliae genome is the pr1E
and pr1F genes, which are located in tandem. Bagga et al
[54] suggest that the ancestor of M. anisopliae contained
pr1D and pr1J genes, duplication and divergence of a pr1Jlike (prtF group) gene giving rise to a pr1F-likegene, which
subsequently reduplicated to give the pr1E and pr1F genes
within the Metarhizium genus. The pr1E gene appears to
have arisen by tandem duplication of the pr1F gene within
M. anisopliae, after divergence of the f. spp. anisopliae and
acridum [54].
Proteinase K subfamily 3, containing the specialized vacuolar proteases, is represented by a single gene in all of the
Hypocreales strains, suggesting the common ancestor
contained this gene. As described earlier, this study
revealed the presence of new subfamilies within the proteinase K family. The prtJ gene is representative of the new
subfamily 4, which is present in a single copy in all of the
Hypocreales strains except M. anisopliae, where the
genome is unsequenced. This gene may be present in the
M. anisopliae genome, but was undetected during expression studies used to identify SLPs in this organism. The
presence of this gene in the Hypocreales genomes (Figure
5) as well as in other Sordariomycete genomes (Additional file 4), suggest this gene was present in the common
ancestor.
The newly proposed subfamily 5, characterized by the
CHGG_10086 gene from Chaetomium globosum, has
patchy taxonomic distribution within the Hypocreales,
being only found in the F. oxysporum and F. verticillioides
genomes (Figure 5; Additional file 4). This gene appears to

have undergone at least one duplication event in the
ancestor of these two species to give two genes, followed
by another duplication in F. oxysporum to give a third gene.
However, it is interesting to note that in F. verticillioides,
frameshifts due to base insertion or deletions have created
genes that appear to encode non-functional proteins
(FVEG_01530 and FVEG_03386), whereas one of the F.
oxysporum genes, FOXG_02695, also appears to have
undergone a similar frameshift.
Gene duplication and gene loss was studied in the fungal
pyrolysin family. For subfamily 2, a single representative
was found in each of the Hypocreales genomes, except M.
anisopliae (possibly due to not having the complete
genome sequence). This subfamily was previously shown
to have undergone extensive gene duplication in the more
distantly related M. grisea [4] (Additional file 5). In subfamily 1, gene duplication or loss may have taken place
multiple times. All of the Hypocreales genomes contained
at least one prtK-like gene, with multiple copies in the
Fusarium spp. and E. festucae.
In the kexin family, all Hypocreales strains (except M. anisopliae) have at least one kexin gene (Figure 5; Additional
file 6). This gene appears to have been duplicated in E. festucae. The differences between the sequences appear to
indicate divergence of kexB from kexA.
The prtL gene, which represents the OSP subfamily, was
present in most of the Hypocreales, except T. reesei, where
the gene appears to have been lost, and in F. verticillioides,
where the gene appears to have been duplicated (Figure 5;
Additional file 7).
A complicating factor in assessing the evolution of the
Hypocreales SLP superfamily is the presence of many
sequences with lower SLP similarity in Trichoderma, N.
haematococca and Fusarium spp (Figure 5). These
sequences, which generally encode large proteins with a
peptidase S8 domain characteristic of SLPs, were not
present in the E. festucae genome, suggesting they may
have been lost from these strains. An interesting feature of
some of these proteins was the presence of ankyrin repeats
in the amino terminus of the protein, with a peptidase S8
domain in the carboxyl terminus (e.g. FGSG_04375 from
F. graminearum). The role of these proteins within the cell
is unknown, but potentially the ankyrin repeats, which
are involved in protein-protein interactions [55], could
target SLP activity towards particular protein substrates.

Conclusion
In this study, we aimed to study the evolution of the SLP
gene family in E. festucae. Fifteen predicted SLP genes were
present in the E. festucae genome, representing four different SLP families. New subfamilies within the proteinase K

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/168

family were identified, as well as a new family, the oxidatively stable proteases previously thought to be present
only in bacteria. Phylogenetic studies showed that many
gene duplications and loss events have occurred during
evolution of the SLP gene family within the Hypocreales.
