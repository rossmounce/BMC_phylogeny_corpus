Application of computational approaches to
study signalling networks of nuclear and Tyrosine
kinase receptors
Mouna Choura, Ahmed Rebaï*

Abstract
Background: Nuclear receptors (NRs) and Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are essential proteins in many cellular
processes and sequence variations in their genes have been reported to be involved in many diseases including
cancer. Although crosstalk between RTK and NR signalling and their contribution to the development of endocrine
regulated cancers have been areas of intense investigation, the direct coupling of their signalling pathways
remains elusive. In our understanding of the role and function of nuclear receptors on the cell membrane the
interactions between nuclear receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors deserve further attention.
Results: We constructed a human signalling network containing nuclear receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors
that identified a network topology involving eleven highly connected hubs.
We further developed an integrated knowledge database, denominated NR-RTK database dedicated to human
RTKs and NRs and their vertebrate orthologs and their interactions. These interactions were inferred using computational tools and those supported by literature evidence are indicated. NR-RTK database contains links to other
relevant resources and includes data on receptor ligands. It aims to provide a comprehensive interaction map that
identifies complex dynamics and potential crosstalk involved.
Availability: NR-RTK database is accessible at http://www.bioinfo-cbs.org/NR-RTK/
Conclusions: We infer that the NR-RTK interaction network is scale-free topology. We also uncovered the key
receptors mediating the signal transduction between these two types of receptors. Furthermore, NR-RTK database
is expected to be useful for researchers working on various aspects of the molecular basis of signal transduction by
RTKs and NRs.

Background
The receptor-ligand binding triggers a series of reactions
in a living system. So, detailed knowledge and data about
receptors such as nuclear receptors and receptor tyrosine
kinases and their ligands are important for understanding
living systems and diseases, and for designing new drugs.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) are one of the most abundant
classes of transcriptional regulators in animals. They regulate diverse functions, such as homeostasis, reproduction, development, or metabolism. They are prominent

pharmaceutical targets for diseases such as hypertension,
cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and the metabolic
syndrome [1,2]. Nuclear receptors function as ligand activated transcription factors, thus providing a direct link
between signalling molecules that control these processes
and transcriptional responses. They bind to DNA as
monomers, homodimers or heterodimers. The homodimers and heterodimers can bind to DNA elements that
are oriented as palindromes, direct repeats, or even
inverted repeats. The two dimerisation domains, that is
the DNA binding domain (DBD) and ligand binding
domain (LBD) work in tandem to enable DNA binding.
The ability of NRs to bind different oriented repeats
increases the level of complexity. The dimerisation

network for human NR family revealed very connected
hub-based topology [3].
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) transmit their activation signal across the plasma membrane, and many studies have demonstrated that the receptors, and not the
growth factors, mediate the pleiotropic cellular responses.
Growth factors recognize and activate their cognate
receptors and stimulate receptor dimerization, tyrosine
kinase activation and autophosphorylation. The autophosphorylated RTKs recruit and activate a receptor-specific
complement of intracellular signalling pathways that
relay information to the nucleus and other intracellular
compartments [4].
Beyond this well-established mechanism of RTK and
NR signallings, crosstalk between the RTK and NR
receptors has been reported in many cases, such as
i) Complex interactions between steroid receptor
(estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor) and
growth factor receptor signalling governed breast cancer
evolution [5].
ii) TrkB-GR interaction plays a critical role in the
BDNF-stimulated PLC-g pathway, which is required for
glutamate release and the decrease in TrkB-GR interaction caused by chronic exposure to glucocorticoids
results in the suppression of BDNF-mediated neurotransmitter release via a glutamate transporter [6].
iii) Nuclear RTKs regulate a variety of cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, DNA damage repair and
signal transduction, both in normal tissues and in
human cancer cells [7].
Here, our goal is to get a global understanding of the
NR-RTK network using automated methods. We also
developed a database which summarizes various data
related to RTKs, NRs and their interactions and makes our
results available for further discussion and investigation.

Results and discussion
NR-RTK signalling network

We integrated results derived from genomic context,
high-throughput experiments, coexpression (conserved)
and text mining related to human NRs and RTKs to
obtain the complete dataset, with a total of 159 proteinprotein interactions including 38 RTK-RTK, 42 NRRTK and 79 NR-NR protein interactions as shown in
Additional file 1.
We then analysed the RTK-RTK, NR-NR interaction
networks separately. The RTK-RTK interaction network
is shown in figure 1 revealing the central role of Erbb
family, especially EGFR, in this very connected network
(see additional file 1).To our knowledge, this paper presents for the first time the most thorough interaction
dataset for the human RTKs. A similar observation for
the very connected NR-NR interaction network (figure 2)
showing the hub protein RXR [NR2B] (mentioned

Page 2 of 9

14 folds as interactor) which is the common heterodimerising partner of 11 phylogenetic groups and SHP
[NR0B2] (cited 15 fold as interactor) which is a corepressor as mentioned in additional file 1. These results
are in good agreement with the study of [3].
Our analysis reveals 42 NR-RTK interactions when the
two networks were merged into one (figure 3, table 1,
additional file 1). Moreover, we highlight the central
role of Erbb family and steroid hormone receptors
(EGFR, Erbb2, ESR1 and ESR2 are mentioned 7 times as
interactors). This suggests that these connecting proteins are most likely responsible for propagation of
transduction signal across the NR-RTK network.
Among the 42 predicted NR-RTK interactions, four
interactions had been previously validated by in vivo or
in vitro assays: DHTR-Erbb2 [8], EGFR-ESR1 [9],
Erbb2-ESR1 [10] and IGF1R-ESR1 [11]. The interactions
having high scores seem to be biologically relevant and
worth to be validated experimentally (table 1). A higher
confidence score may suggest a higher possibility of a
putative protein-protein interaction (PPI).
On the other hand, we should take into account the
substantial time lag between the first publication of a
finding and at the time at which the PPI is entered in a
database. It could therefore be postulated that many of
our predicted PPIs predicted today are in fact correct,
but have not been entered in a database for several years.
Topology of the interaction networks

The topological properties of each network are listed in
table 2. We tested the properties of the networks
formed by the overall NR-RTK interactions, by plotting
the log of frequency of proteins with k interactors
against log(k). For the whole NR-RTK and RTK-RTK
networks, we obtained a log-log plot linear regression
R2 value of 0.794 and 0.899, respectively. This indicates
that the networks have a scale-free topology. Nevertheless, this statistical property was not observed for the
NR-NR protein interaction network (log-log plot linear
regression R2 = 0.39) (see additional file 1). Once again,
this result is in good agreement with the study of
Amoutzias [3] who inferred that human NR-NR interaction network is hub-based dimerization network in
which a significant number of negative feedback loops is
present, with the hub protein SHP [NR0B2] playing a
major role.
In scale free networks, a few nodes called hubs have
higher degree than other nodes and play dominant role
to conserve connections of the overall networks.
Betweenness centrality is yet another global property of
networks. High betweenness nodes occur on a large
number of non- redundant shortest paths between other
nodes. If a node is removed, it may disconnect different
parts of the network. In order to identify important

nodes involved in NR-RTK communication, we combined degree distribution and betweenness centrality
measures. The highly ranked nodes are listed in Table 3
(all topological measures see additional file 2). Thus
such nodes (NR0B2, EGFR, ESR1, NR2F1, ERBB2,
RXRA, NR1D1, NR2F6, NR2C1, PGR and IGF1R) may
be thought as potential bridges between NR and RTK
networks and have most influence in the transmission
of information (or cross talk) across the two networks.
NR-RTK database content

NR-RTK database contains 624 protein receptors
divided into 288 NRs and 336 RTKs curated from public

databases. Among them 104 human protein receptors
(48 NRs and 56 RTKs), the other vertebrate orthologs
were taken from Chimpanzee, Dog, Mouse Rat and
Chicken organisms.
The premise behind the design of the database was to
utilize as many public, continually-updated databases as
possible. Thus, the menu items are linked to resources
such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Pfam, MutDB, CGAP, PharmGKB (Table 4).
Moreover, NR-RTK database includes information on
the ligand (if it exists) of corresponding receptor.
NR-RTK database is constructed through three modules. Each module performs specialized functions that

provide users with a convenient way to find desired
information according to the standard classification of
these two kinds of receptors. The modules are described
in the following sections:
• RTKs module

Receptor tyrosine kinases are classified into 20 subfamilies according to their variable extracellular domain as
described by [12].
• NRs Module

Nuclear receptors are classified into seven groups
(denoted from 0 to 6) according to Nuclear Receptor
Nomenclature Committee.
• NR-RTK interaction module

This module provides protein-protein associations
derived from high-throughput experimental data, from
the mining of databases and literature, and from predictions based on genomic context analysis.

This module contains data on NR-NR, RTK-RTK and
NR-RTK interactions inferred as previously described.
The data are collected in an Excel file containing interaction method detection, data mining references (PMID)
and combined score for every association. From a functional perspective, ‘association’ can mean direct physical
binding, but can also mean indirect interaction such as
participation in the same metabolic pathway or cellular
process.
NR-RTK database is accessible at http://www.bioinfocbs.org/NR-RTK/

Conclusions
We infer that the NR-RTK interaction network is scalefree topology. We also uncovered the key receptors
mediating the signal transduction between these two
types of receptors. Furthermore, NR-RTK database is
expected to be useful for researchers working on various
aspects of the molecular basis of signal transduction by
RTKs and NRs.

resemble a scale-free topology if the distribution of
connectivity decays in a power-law fashion. Therefore,
the better the trendline (in the log-log plot) fits a linear regression, the more the network resembles a
scale-free topology [14].

construction of the database. At present, this is not
entirely clear.
Author’s response: We have added an explanation
about the curation process in “NR-RTKdatabase
content”.
* Secondly, in the analysis of the interaction networks,
the authors do not entertain other possible equation fits
for the distribution of K_interactors versus Frequency
(K_interactors). One should really check other possible
equations also (not just a power law equation).
Author’s response: We agree with the reviewer that
we should check other equations. We feel that testing
the scale-free topology and biological interpretation is
sufficient for publication on this topic. As we are carrying on other works with the data, a more detailed comparison with other power law equation is desirable and
we hope to complete that in the near future.
* Thirdly, in the database, the Pubmed links in the
lists of families do not appear to work.
Author’s response: Done, all links work.
* Fourthly, the authors should make sure that the format of the webpages and download files is adequately
explained. Currently, there is not sufficient explanation.
For example, there is not a detailed explanation of the
columns in the Excel file of downloadable interactions.
Help pages with this information should be provided.
Author’s response: This information is explained in
the manuscript in Results and Discussion section (“NRRTK module”). Furthermore, we are now in the process
of generating a new website to house these data.
Reviewer’s report 2

Arcady Mushegian, Department of Bioinformatics, Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City,
Missouri, USA.
* This study is suitable for publication as a Discovery
Note, not as a Research Article. Targeted reconstruction
of a protein-centered interaction subnetwork by extracting and scoring all relationships of that protein may be
of interest if this results in novel observations about biological system, and I would suggest to show more of it
in this note.
Author’s response: We don’t think that this study can
be considered as a Discovery Note. We believe that the

Page 7 of 9

significance of this work consists not just in the
approach, but in the combination of methodology and
biology to get new insights on the important receptors
in signal transduction.
* For instance, instead of primarily focusing on the
node degree of the network, the authors may discuss in
more detail the actual gene content of the modules that
they discover. How many of the connections and of
module composition are well-known and how many are
novel/not covered in the literature? Any new hypotheses
suggested by the module inference? What type of evidence makes the most significant contribution to the
network? Are there types of evidence that do/do not
improve the score?
Author’s response: The sub-networks discovered are
RTK-RTK and NR-NR networks. The gene content of
each sub-network is quite clearly described in the database such are their potential connections and their citations in literature. The module inference is exactly the
main aim of the presented paper. Our approach may
serve as predictive tool for indentifying key interactions
and providing insight in experimental validation (in vivo
and in vitro assays) (table1). The experimental assays
and co-citations in literature for a given interaction
improve the score.
The figures as they stand now are typical of many
“systems-biology” papers, but it is not clear what to
make of them. Are we supposed to eyeball the list of
gene names (in which case the table would suffice)? Is
the density of links supposed to be the main message?
A position of particular nodes?
Author’s response: The figures represent the interactions derived from different sources of evidence showing
the central role of some proteins so called “hubs”. The
main point is the identification of these hubs according
to their position in the network and other topological
parameters (supplemental file 2).
Finally, about the “scale-free” character of the network. First, I am not sure that it is useful to compute
the node degree distribution of the local, i.e., proteincentric network: if it is by construction a set of interactors of one protein, it is guaranteed that at least one
protein will be very highly connected. More formally, it
is known that fitting to the power law is not a right test
here: many purported “scale-free” networks have been
proven to reject the hypothesis in standard tests (e.g.,
Khanin and Wit, JCB 2006), or fit the power law only
on an interval, or on different intervals with different
values of the gamma parameter (discussed, for example,
in several of Mark Newman’s papers). Moreover, suppose that the distribution can be fit to a mixture of
functions - what would the biological conclusion be?
Author’s response: We agree with reviewer. Although
the statistical test shows that the network is scale-free,

Choura and Rebaï Biology Direct 2010, 5:58
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/58

we are also aware that much more tests should be performed especially for such complex system.
Regarding your question supposing a mixture of functions, this would be explained by two types of interactions: physical interactions and cross-talking with the
two types of receptors that modulate gene expression.
Reviewer’s report 3: Anthony Almudevar, Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY
The authors are concerned with two classes of proteins, nuclear receptors (NR) and receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTK). These have broad functionality, with variants implicated in many disease states, including cancer.
A database is constructed based on a protein-protein
interaction (PPI) network of 48 NRs and 53 RTKs. The
PPIs are compiled using various existing knowledge
sources.
Author’s response: We corrected the typing error in
manuscript, 56 RTKs instead of 53 RTKs.
Three networks are analyzed, with NR proteins only
(NR-NR), with RTK proteins only (RTK-RTK), and with
all proteins (NR-RTK). It is reported that the RTK-RTK
and NR-RTK networks have scale-free topology (ie. possess a power-law node degree distribution, with a small
number of highly connected hubs, as is common in
cellular networks). This does not hold for the NR-NR
network, an observation which conforms to another
published finding. A hypothesis for this observation is
given, involving the presence of a large number of negative feedback loops.
Proteins which form highly connected hubs in the
NR-RTK network (11 listed) are conjectured to influence the transmission of information between the NR
and RTK networks.
The NR-RTK database is available at a URL given in
the article. It is fairly basic in structure, but provides a
useful way to explore the properties of the network and
its components.
Overall, the paper is concerned with the construction
of a knowledge database, and is not concerned with new
methodology. As such, some potentially useful hypotheses concerning signaling pathways, and their role in
disease states, are generated. The methods used seem
sound. The given biological background, and hence the
motivation for the database, is interesting.
Some suggestions:
(1) Abstract - Results: “We constructed a human signalling network ... that indentified a much more connected network topology than previously thought.” Is it
possible to provide citations, or to elaborate on this
claim?
Author’s response: To elaborate this result, we
rephrased this sentence.

The method used by the authors for testing the scalefree property is given in Barabási and Albert (1999)
Science, vol 286, p -509-512. The exponent of the
power law (the slope of the regression line) might also
be reported, since it is sometimes used to characterize
network properties, and might allow for a useful comparison to other cellular networks.
