Abstract
Background: Duplicated sequences are an important source of gene innovation and structural
variation within mammalian genomes. We performed the first systematic and genome-wide analysis
of segmental duplications in the modern domesticated cattle (Bos taurus). Using two distinct
computational analyses, we estimated that 3.1% (94.4 Mb) of the bovine genome consists of
recently duplicated sequences (≥ 1 kb in length, ≥ 90% sequence identity). Similar to other
mammalian draft assemblies, almost half (47% of 94.4 Mb) of these sequences have not been
assigned to cattle chromosomes.
Results: In this study, we provide the first experimental validation large duplications and briefly
compared their distribution on two independent bovine genome assemblies using fluorescent in
situ hybridization (FISH). Our analyses suggest that the (75-90%) of segmental duplications are
organized into local tandem duplication clusters. Along with rodents and carnivores, these results
now confidently establish tandem duplications as the most likely mammalian archetypical
organization, in contrast to humans and great ape species which show a preponderance of
interspersed duplications. A cross-species survey of duplicated genes and gene families indicated
that duplication, positive selection and gene conversion have shaped primates, rodents, carnivores
and ruminants to different degrees for their speciation and adaptation. We identified that bovine
segmental duplications corresponding to genes are significantly enriched for specific biological
functions such as immunity, digestion, lactation and reproduction.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that in most mammalian lineages segmental duplications are
organized in a tandem configuration. Segmental duplications remain problematic for genome and
assembly and we highlight genic regions that require higher quality sequence characterization. This
study provides insights into mammalian genome evolution and generates a valuable resource for
cattle genomics research.

Background

Results

Segmental duplications have been recognized as important mediators of both gene and genome evolution [1-9].
Segmental duplications are substrates of genome innovation, genomic rearrangements, and hotspots of copy
number variation (CNV) within species [7,8,10-12]. From
the genic perspective, such duplications often encode protein products which, although not essential for viability of
the organism, are important for the adaptation of the species to specific ecological niches [13]. Among mammalian
species, commonly duplicated genes include those associated with the recognition of environmental molecules
and include genes associated with innate immunity, drug
detoxification, olfaction, and sperm competition. From
the perspective of genome structure, lineage-specific segmental duplications or large repeats often delineate
regions of recurrent evolutionary liability [2,7,14]. Recent
comparative sequencing efforts among mammals, for
example, shows that highly homologous repetitive
sequence frequently associate with the breakpoints of
large-scale chromosomal rearrangement [15-18]. Understanding the nature and pattern of segmental duplications
provides fundamental insight into functional redundancy, adaptive evolution, and the structural dynamics of
chromosomal evolution [7,8,19-25]. From the practical
perspective, regions of large-scale duplication are particularly problematic for genome assembly, SNP mapping
and genotyping [1,26-28]. For example, two independent
bovine genome assemblies were recently reported
(Btau_4.0 and UMD2) and a simple comparison indicated that significant fewer intrachromsomal duplications
were detected in UMD2 [29,30]. Gene and SNP annotation will significantly improve when duplicated sequence
is correctly integrated into the assembly [31,32]. Knowledge of the location and content of duplicated regions
could be important for accurately mapping QTL, and validating putative single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
that may have arisen from allelic variants as opposed to
recently duplicated sequences[33].

Genome-wide Identification of Bovine Segmental
Duplications
We applied two well-established computational
approaches, whole genome shotgun sequence detection
(WSSD) [1] and Whole Genome Assembly Comparison
(WGAC) [34], to the publicly available bovine genome
sequence assembly (Btau_4.0) to detect putative segmental duplications. Briefly, WGAC identifies paralogous
sequences ≥ 1 kb in length with ≥ 90% sequence identity,
while the WSSD identifies genomic regions that exhibit
significant depth of coverage by aligning whole genome
shotgun sequencing reads to the reference genome
sequence (≥ 10 kb, ≥ 94%). Remarkably, we initially identified 328.0 Mb or 129,555 pairwise alignments as putative duplications by the WGAC analysis (47,261 map to
unassigned scaffolds - ChrUnAll). Of the 10,251 intrachromosomal (scaffolds assigned to chromosomes) segmental duplications, 71% (n = 7,245) map within 1 Mb
of one another. As larger, high-identity duplications (the
267.0 Mb unshaded region in Fig. 1) are frequently collapsed within working draft sequence assemblies [28] or
may represent artificial duplications within an assembly
[34], we compared these WGAC results to those detected
by the assembly-independent WSSD approach. We found
that 44% of the WSSD duplication intervals (33.4/75.8
Mb) were not detected by the genome assembly based
comparison and, likely represent collapsed duplications
(Fig. 1). In addition, we identified 42.4 Mb high-confidence duplications detected by both methods. These
include 30,559 pairwise alignments (14,207 interchromosomal and 16,352 intrachromosomal).

Segmental duplications have been extensively studied in
other organisms [1,2,4,7,8]. Here we report in detail our
genome-wide and systematic analysis of segmental duplications in cattle using Btau_4.0. We further validated the
distribution of selected large duplications and briefly
compared their corresponding regions in Btau_4.0 to a
second bovine assembly, UMD2, using FISH. We performed a cross-mammalian survey of duplicated genes
and gene families to compare gene repertoires and evolutionary mechanism of origin. Along with rodents and carnivores, our bovine results now establish tandem
duplications as the most likely mammalian archetypical
organization, in contrast to higher primates which show a
preponderance of interspersed duplications.

We note the presence of a large fraction of sequence (92.5
Mb) detected by WGAC (≥ 20 kb, ≥ 94% identity) from
the 267.0 Mb regions as defined above with no WSSD
overlap. Excluding the unassigned scaffolds, these are predominantly intrachromosomal in origin and a total of
364/402 (91%) pairwise alignments map within 1 Mb of
one another. As large, high identity alleles (≥ 99.5%) may
not be merged and represent artificial duplications due to
local assembly errors [34], we excluded all these alignments to eliminate artificial duplications in Batu_4.0. Our
results are also supported by the observation reported by
Zimin et al [30] that overwhelming majority of the large,
high-identity intrachromosomal duplications (> 5 kb, >
95%) are probably assembly artifacts. Their brief duplication analysis indicated that Batu_4.0 had significantly
more duplications of this type, 3,098 vs. 662 in UMD2.
Following our previous studies of other genomes, we
defined segmental duplications based on the union of all
WGAC hits with less than 94% sequence identity and
WSSD duplication intervals (Fig. 1). We derived an esti-

unmapped contigs, pericentromeric regions represent
3.4% of genomic sequence, but show an enrichment of
2.4-fold for duplications (p-value < 0.001) and contain
8.1% of all duplicated bases. Similarly, subtelomeric
regions show an enrichment of 1.9-fold (p-value < 0.001)
and contain 6.7% of duplicated bases. Additionally, a
strong positive correlation between segmental duplication and evolutionary breakpoint regions was observed
[29]. As expected, the "uncharacterized chromosome"
(ChrUnAll), which consists of sequence that cannot be
uniquely mapped to the genome, contains the majority of
predicted duplication bases (45.3/94.4 Mb, 47%, see
Additional File 1: Fig. S2).

Comparison of bovine segmental duplications predicted by the WGAC and WSSD algorithms. We initially identified 328.0 (red) and 75.8 Mb (blue) as putative
duplications using the WGAC and WSSD analysis, respectively. The overlapping relationship of these two predictions
is shown in a Venn diagram. We defined segmental duplications based on the union of significant WGAC hits with less

mate of the duplication content of the bovine genome to
be 3.11% (94.4 Mb/3,036.6 Mb; Fig. 2 and also see Additional File 1: Fig. S1). This, however, should be regarded
as conservative estimate that will increase as the bovine
genome assembly improves. In the following analyses, we
focused on further characterization of this subset.
Distribution and Sequence Properties of Bovine Segmental
Duplications
The recent segmental duplications of the bovine genome
are distributed in a nonrandom fashion at two different
levels. First, duplication content varies significantly
among different chromosomes. Chromosomes 5, 18, 27,
29 and X show the greatest enrichment for segmental
duplication (See Additional File 1: Table S2, Fig. S1 and
S3) with twofold the duplication content of the genome
average (excluding unplaced sequence contigs). Most of
this effect is due to an increase in intrachromosomal
duplication content localized at specific clusters. Furthermore, similar to the human, mouse, rat and dog genomes,
there are a greater proportion of duplications near pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions. Excluding

Of those duplications that can be assigned to a chromosome and confirmed by two different duplication algorithms, we note a bipartite distribution with respect to
length and percent identity (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 depicts the
duplication content of the bovine genome as a function of
the length of alignment and the degree of sequence identity. Interchromosomal duplications are shorter (median
length 2.5 kb) and more divergent (< 94% identity), while
intrachromosomal duplications are much larger (median
length 20 kb) showing higher sequence identity (~97%).
There are 1,020 duplication intervals from duplicated
sequence identified by WGAC and WSSD with a median
length and average length of 48.8 kb and 82.8 kb, respectively. Twenty-one of these duplication blocks are ≥ 300
kb in length and located in regions enriched in tandem
duplications, including multiple known gene clusters
(Fig. 2 and Additional File 1: Fig. S1). This pattern is reminiscent of the duplication pattern of other mammals
(mouse, rat and dog) but differs from the interspersed segmental duplication pattern that predominates in human
and great-ape genomes (Fig. 4) [1,3,4,7,8,20].
Delineation of the most recent duplication events at the
genomic-sequence level, and particularly sequences
located at their junctions [35], may provide insight into
their mechanism of origin [15,17,36,37]. We compared
the repeat content of duplicated sequence, flanking
sequence and the whole genome (Table 1, Methods).
Unlike human segmental duplications, which are
enriched for SINE Alu repeats [35], no SINE enrichment
was associated with bovine segmental duplications. The
working draft nature of the bovine genome sequence currently prevents a detailed analysis of the sequence structure at the transition regions between unique and
duplicated sequence. Nevertheless, two clear patterns
emerge regarding repeat content. While LTR content
remains similar, DNA, SINE and low-complexity repeat
content of most duplications are reduced (Table 1, Random simulation test, P-values < 0.001). SINE content
shows a reduction compared to the genome average
(12.71% vs. 15.90%). This gradually increases to the

Page 3 of 16

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:571

genome average as sequences flanking the duplications
are considered. An opposite trend is observed with respect
to LINE and satellite repeat sequences, even though the
fold change for LINE is only 1.03 (P-value < 0.01). Compared to the genome average, bovine segmental duplications show a 1.91-fold enrichment for satellite repeat
content and a 2.24-fold elongation for satellite repeat
average length (Table 1). When individual repeat subfamilies are considered, two related satellite repeat classes
BTSAT4 and OSSAT2 show the greatest increases in length
and/or density while BTSAT2 and BTSAT6 show decreases
in both length and density. Satellite BTSAT4 shows 2.26fold increase in density while their average lengths are
similar. Satellite OSSAT2 shows 7.55-fold increase in density and 2.71-fold increase in length.
Gene Content
We considered the genomic duplication content of the
gene sets aligned to the bovine genome. Seventy-six percent (778/1020) of the bovine segmental duplication
intervals identified by both WGAC and WSSD correspond
to complete or partial gene duplications (See Additional
File 1: Table S3). Of these, the overwhelming majority of
pairwise alignments was < 1 Mb apart, again indicating
that most "functional" duplicates within the bovine
genome are clusters of tandem gene families, as opposed
to widely interspersed duplications in humans and other
primates. Although a portion of these intervals correspond to predicted genes of unknown or hypothetical
function, 1,858 RefSeq genes were located in predicted
segmental duplications. In order to test the hypothesis
that particular gene classes are overrepresented in duplicated regions, we assigned PANTHER Molecular Function
terms to all genes that overlapped duplications. Statistically significant over or under representations were
observed for multiple categories (Additional File 1: Table
S4). Another independent Gene Ontology and pathway
analyses also confirm that these terms and categories are
significantly enriched in bovine segmental duplication
regions [29].

Consistent with similar duplication analyses in other
mammals [1,3,4,7,10], several of these gene duplications,
which are important in drug detoxification, defense/
innate immunity and receptor and signal recognition, are
also duplicated in cattle (such as cytochrome P450, ribonuclease A, and β-defensins). Since these genes or gene
families have been repeatedly detected to be duplicated in
multiple mammalian genomes, it will be interesting to
investigate their repertoires and evolutionary mechanisms. Combining the bovine gene annotation effort [29],
our duplication analyses and other published results, we
surveyed and summarized the evolutionary analyses of 7
well-studied duplicated gene families in cattle, humans,
mice and dogs (Table 2). These multiple-member gene

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/571

families normally went through the so-called "birth-anddeath" evolution [38] in which new genes were created by
gene duplication and some of them were retained in the
genome for a long time as functional genes, but other
genes were inactivated or eliminated from the genome.
While some ancient members arose before the last common ancestor of mammals, a common theme is that new
members often originated after divergence of these mammals from each other. These lineage-specific gene expansions of individual subfamilies were detected in all 4
species, especially in cattle and mice.
Depending on their nature (gene ancestries, structures,
functions, and genomic distributions), three major evolutionary mechanisms - gene duplication, positive selection
and conversion have shaped these gene families to different degrees. For example, phylogenetic analysis of RNase
A indicates that this gene family expansion predated the
separation of placental and marsupial mammals and that
differential gene duplication and loss occurred in different
species, generating a great variation in gene number and
content among extant mammals [39]. Similarly, gene
duplication and inactivation have important roles in both
the adaptive and non-adaptive evolution of Olfactory
Receptor (OR) genes [40]. Another example is β-defensin
genes which are densely clustered in four to five syntenic
chromosomal regions. Although the majority of βdefensins are evolutionarily conserved across species, subgroups of gene lineages exist that are specific in species
like cattle and mice and originated recently by gene duplication and positive selection [29,41,42]. An analysis of
cytochrome P450 gene families in 10 vertebrate species
provided two distinct evolutionary schemes depending
on gene functions. While stable genes for endogenous
metabolic functions are characterized by few or no gene
duplications or deletions, unstable genes for xenobiotics
detoxification are characterized by frequent gene duplications, deletions and positive selection [43]. Finally, gene
conversion has played a major role in shaping the IFNA
gene family in eutherian species after gene duplication
[44,45]. The other duplication examples include TCRV
[46], C-type lysozymes [29], BPI-like (BSP30) [47], BPI/
LBP, Cathelicidin [29], interferon subfamilies (IFNB,
IFNW, and IFNX) [29], Pregnancy-associated glycoprotein [48], Sulfotransferases, ULBP [49], WC1 [50] and etc.
The high level of sequence identity (median = 98.9%)
indicates that over 25% (263/1020 > 99.0%) of the
bovine duplications may have occurred within the artiodactyla, and probably more specifically within the Bos lineage. For example, some genes are only duplicated in
cattle but not in other mammalian lineages (eg. matrilin,
conglutinin, CBX3, CSKN1B, etc in 2 Additional File 1:
Table S3). Additionally, some of these may represent gene
families important in cattle adaptation or recent domesti-

Bovine segmental duplication landscape (≥ 5 kb in legnth, ≥ 90% sequence identity). Intrachromosomal (blue, with
connecting lines) and interchromosomal (red bars, without connecting lines) duplications are shown on Batu_4.0. White bars
represent gaps in the genome assembly. A local tandem distribution pattern is predominant in bovine segmental duplications.
With few exceptions, most intrachromosomal duplications are organized as clusters of tandem or inverted duplications within
close proximity (1 Mb). A total of 21 large regions (each ≥ 300 kb in length, total ~12.6 Mb of sequence) are shown as gold
bars. Twelve of these duplication blocks (labeled A to L) correspond to known genes (A:LAD1; B:GBP6; C:WC1.1, WC1.2,

cation. There are also considerable gene duplications
involved in adaptive immune responses in cattle compared with human and mouse. For example, we detected
2 duplication blocks containing at least 13 WC1 genes distributed within two distant regions on chr5 (Fig. 2). We
find evidence of recent duplication of the intelectin gene
(ITLN1; lactoferrin receptor), which is a receptor for a
major iron-binding protein in milk, and a sterol carrier
protein (SCP2), which is an intracellular protein potentially involved in lipid transfer in organs involved in lipid
metabolism, including mammary tissue. Two other genes
encoding proteins present in milk during lactation or
mastitis were found to be associated with segmental
duplications: cathelicidin (CATHL1) and β-2 microglobulin (B2M). In addition, there is over-representation of
genes involved in ruminant-specific aspects of reproduction including the intercellular signaling proteins pregnancy associated glycoproteins (chr29), interferon tau
(IFNT on chr8), trophoblast Kunitz domain proteins
(chr13) and prolactin-related proteins (chr23). Our predictions and FISH results also confirmed that the expansion of the well-known C-type lysozyme family though
gene duplication (described below and Fig. 5).
FISH Characterization of Predicted Segmental Duplication
and Comparison of Bovine Genome Assemblies
We experimentally validated a subset of the largest (≥ 20
kb) duplicated regions by FISH (Fig. 5). Forty-six largeinsert BAC clones identified by WGAC and/or WSSD
methods were used as probes and hybridized against a
Hereford smooth muscle cell line (Tables 3 and 4). One
BAC clone (210P15) was only supported by WGAC < 94%

(i.e. from the 18.6 Mb region of Fig. 1). Six of the probes
failed to generate signals by hybridization. We observed
multiple signals either by examination of interphase and
metaphase FISH for 80% (33/41) of the remaining probes
confirming their duplication status including duplications of cattle genes of ALAS2, BCAS2, GEMIN8, LDB2,
MED6, NMT2, and ZFP2. As expected, the majority (72%)
of the WSSD intervals without assembly support for
duplications (WGAC negative) were confirmed by FISH.
Only 2 of the probes showed signals on non-homologous
chromosomes (interchromosomal duplications). 93% of
the probes (31/33) showed evidence of duplicated signals
that were locally clustered (tandem intrachromosomal
duplication). 16 out of 33 duplicated BACs produced
pericetromeirc or telomeric signals. The BAC probes
(154H9) covering LYZ1 produced duplicated signals both
interchomosomally and intrachomosomally (Dup inter
and Dup intra). Similar to the mouse and dog genomes
[7,8], these FISH data demonstrate that tandem intrachromosomal duplications predominate in the cattle genome
(Fig. 2 and Fig. 4). The basis for the remaining 8 BAC
probes consistent with single copy sequence is unknown.
We note, however, that the animal for the cell line used in
the FISH experiments is a Hereford male different from
the sequenced cow (Dominette), and copy number polymorphism as well as limitations of BAC-FISH to detect
duplications < 40 kb (especially in the case of local tandem duplications) may account for differences between
the computational predictions and experimental data.

regions identified only by WGAC (the 267.0 Mb
unshaded region in Fig. 1), we chose 13 additional BAC
clones from that region (99.69% to 99.98% sequence
identity) as FISH probes to compare Btau_4.0 and UMD2.
Since the BAC-FISH method used here was most reliable
to distinguish single signal vs. duplicated signals and
interchromosomal (Dup inter) vs. intrachromosomal
(Dup intra) duplications, our assembly comparisons were
mainly based on these two criteria. Table 5 summaries our
comparisons of the FISH results with the computational
predications based on Btau_4.0 or UMD2. Except for one
BAC clone (11L7) which had no results, 10 BAC clones
supported UMD2's predictions while only 2 supported
Btau_4.0's. This result is a striking contrast to what we
obtained for those 46 BAC clones of Both, WSSD and
WGAC < 94% types (Table 4). The two assemblies essen-

tially produced the same computational predictions for
those 46 BAC clones (data not shown), suggesting two
assemblies are almost identical in those high-confidence
duplicated regions.

Discussion
We present the first detailed genome-wide analysis of
recent segmental duplication content of the bovine
genome. Global studies of segmental duplication content
have become an effective measure to assess one aspect of
the quality of whole-genome sequence assemblies [1,51].
Regions of recent segmental duplication remain one of
the greatest challenges to finishing a genome assembly.
The underlying problem is the same--the correct placement and resolution of large sequence that can be
assigned to multiple positions within the genome. An ini-

We compare the repeat content of duplicated regions as detected by both WSSD and WGAC (with ChrUnAll excluded); 20-kb flanking regions immediately flanking the clustered duplications and the genome average. Enrichment
ratios were defined as the total repeat length, count/1 Mb and average length of duplicated sequence divided by the repeat length, count/1 Mb and average length of genome. The significance of the enrichment was determined by
simulating the repeats in a random sample (n = 1,000) of cattle duplicated genomic sequence (**: P-value < 0.001, *: P-value < 0.01).

As many of these duplicated genes are present in unassigned chromosomes, gene numbers in the bovine genome are based on the cited literature
and some of them are just best estimates. *Based on searches on the international ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) information system at http://
www.imgt.org/.

tial assessment of bovine segmental duplication content
therefore provides an important level of annotation for
the user of genome sequence information in the design
and interpretation of future experiments. Moreover, these
initial analyses precisely delineate potential regions where
whole-genome shotgun or a BAC-enrichment strategy will
provide insufficient information for biologists. These
regions include gene families important in immunity,
digestion, lactation and reproduction traits. The content
and structure of these regions will be pivotal to animal
evaluation and selection. We therefore propose that such
highly duplicated regions be uncoupled from WGS
sequencing strategies and be targeted for high-quality
BAC-based finishing to resolving their true location,
organization, and complexity. The results presented here
should provide a framework for the prioritization of such
regions.

The detection of recent segmental duplications is sensitive
to the quality of the underlying sequence assembly. At
least four factors directly impact an assessment of the segmental duplication content within any genome assembly:
(1) the depth of sequencing (fold coverage), (2) the methodology of assembly, (3) the quality of common repeat
annotation, and (4) level of allelic variation. All of these
factors must be taken into account during an assessment
of recent segmental duplication content. There are some
limitations of this analysis that should be noted.
Although many of the expected bovine gene duplications
and highly homologous gene families (i.e., cytochrome
P450 and lysozme genes) were validated during our analysis, not all were detected. It is clear that duplications have
been problematic during sequence and assembly. The
analysis of the unplaced chromosome sequence provides
the best testament to this effect. The "unplaced" chromosome (ChrUnAll) in Btau_4.0 showed a marked enrichment for blocks of segmental duplication, with almost
half (45.2/94.4 Mb) of the duplications assigned to this
category.
Despite these methodological and assembly limitations,
some important trends regarding bovine segmental duplications emerged during our study. Our bovine segmental
duplication estimate is consistent with similar observations in rat [4,4] and dog [8] but lower than human,
mouse [1,3,7]. While these differences may be biologically, we suspect that differences in the strategy for
genome sequencing and assembly are the most likely
cause. The human and mouse genome assemblies are in
the "finished" phases combining both clone-based and
whole-genome shotgun strategies [7,28]. The duplicated
regions represented a major focus in finishing these efforts
resulting in a general increase in the amount of duplications as seen in Fig. 4, even when more relaxed cutoffs (10
kb vs. 20 kb) were applied to the dog and bovine
genomes. This is because that like rat, the bovine genome
is in still in draft version assembled using a hybrid strategy, termed "BAC-enrichment." The BAC-enrichment

hybrid strategy entailed low-pass sequencing of individual BAC clones, followed by an enrichment phase where
individual WGS reads were mapped to specific BAC
projects based on sequence overlap [29,52]. This may also
help to explain the unusually large number of unsupported (WGAC-only) duplications.
Our combined experimental and computational results
demonstrated that cattle, as a representative of ruminants,
is the fourth species whose pattern is reminiscent of the
duplication pattern of other mammals (including mouse,
rat and dog). Along with rodents and carnivores, these
results now confidently establish tandem duplications as
the most likely mammalian archetypical organization, in
contrast to humans and great ape species which show a
preponderance of interspersed duplications. Based on the
current Btau_4.0 assembly, bovine recent duplications are
distributed in a nonuniform fashion across the genome.
In addition to chromosomal differences, we identified 21
duplication blocks (Fig. 2) over 300 kb in length. The
majority of bovine duplications are organized as clusters
of tandem or inverted intrachromosomal duplications. A
similar bias toward clustered duplications was observed in
the mouse, rat and dog genome assemblies (Fig. 4) [35,7,8]. The molecular basis for this difference in hominoid and other genomes is unknown, although the burst
of primate Alu retroposition activity ~35 million years ago
has been suggested to correlate with the expansion and
dispersion of human segmental duplications [35]. Our
analyses of the bovine genome also clearly shows a pericentromeric and subtelomeric bias for segmental duplications, indicating that these may be general properties of
mammalian chromosomal architecture. An analysis of the
evolutionary genetic distance of all segmental duplications as a function of the sum of aligned base pairs
(43,597 alignments) showed a bipartite distribution, for
intrachromosomal and interchromosomal segmental
duplications. Two peaks were observed, at 0.015 substitutions per site (intrachromosomal) and 0.080 substitutions per site (interchromosomal). Assuming a neutral
sequence divergence range of 1.9-2.0 × 10-9 substitution/
site/year [53], this bipartite distribution may correspond

to segmental duplication expansions that occurred relatively recently (~8 and 40 million years ago, respectively).
Sequence analysis between sheep and cattle genes indicated that their divergences ranged between 1.4 and 1.7%
at non-synonymous sites and between 6.9 and 7.7% at
synonymous sites [54]. Our assessment of the underlying
genes reinforces the now relatively commonplace enrichment of specific ontological classes but also identifies lineage-specific genes (> 99.0% sequence identity)
potentially important for promoting cattle speciation,
adaptation and domestication. At the gene level, for those
duplicated genes or gene families in these mammals, both
mutation (gene duplication, inactivation, deletion and
conversion) and selection (positive and neutral) are
implied in lineage-specific adaptations of these mammals
to a particular environment. Duplication of genes
involved immunity may be particularly important to cattle due to the substantial load of microorganisms present
in the rumen of cattle, an increased risk of opportunistic
infections at mucosal surfaces and the need for a stronger
and more diversified innate immune responses at these
locations. For example, WC1 genes encode a family of
scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) proteins found
exclusively on γδ T cells in cattle, sheep and swine but not
humans or mice [50]. In addition, we found evidence of
recent duplication of ITLN1 and SCP2, which may be
involved in iron and lipid transfer in milk. Additional
copy of B2M in the cattle genome may impact on the
abundance of IgG in cow's milk and increase capacity for
uptake in the neonatal gut. Previous studies have demonstrated that the lysozyme family has gone through lineage-specific
gene
amplifications
and

adaptations to digestion in ruminants including cattle
[55-57]. Lysozyme gene duplications were correctly predicted by both in silico approaches and independently
confirmed by FISH. Although inter- and intrachromosomal FISH signals of 154H9 suggest that that genomic
region may be more complex than we currently appreciate, additional sequence analysis and EST expression data
provide further support for our observation [29]. This evidence strongly demonstrated that the expansion of the

lysozyme gene family is likely essential for both increasing
the expression of lysozyme and allowing it to adapt to different functions (immunity vs. digestion) and/or regions
(rumen vs. abomasum) of the ruminant digestive system.
It is interesting to note that many of the duplicated genes
involved in immunity have been adapted to non-immune
functions in cattle: e.g. IFNT, which is involved in maintaining early pregnancy, and the lysozyme genes, which
are involved in digestion [29], agreeing with the "birthand-death' theory.

Cytogenetics using BAC-FISH can independently test and
compare two genome assemblies [58,59]. As our current
FISH results were limited and only based on a single Hereford individual, further analysis will be needed to confirm our observations. This could include performing the
same FISH experiments in additional unrelated individuals, additional cattle breeds (beef vs. milk) and subspecies
(Bos indicus), and closely related species like bison, water
buffalo and yak. These experiments will help to clarify the
effects of inter-individual CNV on our FISH validation.

*NA: not assigned. We implemented three-letter codes to represent signal patterns detected by FISH or predicted based on Btau_4.0 and UMD2.
This is due to the fact that the BAC-FISH method was most reliable to distinguish single signal (the first letter), signals from intrachromosomal (Dup
intra, the second letter) or interchromosomal (Dup inter, the third letter) duplications. "Y" means there is while "N" means there is no
corresponding signal type. One BAC clone (11L7) had no FISH results.

Although copy numbers could not be accurately defined,
there were several signs of CNV events in our FISH experiments (such as signal differences between homologous
chromosomes for the BAC clones 213C22 and 6B15 at
http://bfgl.anri.barc.usda.gov/cattleSD/). It will be also
interesting to detect the breed-specific genomic signatures, if any exist, emerged from the intense cattle selection.
Even though our FISH results were not completely definitive, they provided the first preliminary experimental evidence to evaluate the two available bovine genome
assemblies, especially in the duplicated regions which are
difficult or challenging to assemble. Our results are more
consistent with Zimin et al, who reported that significant
fewer intrachromosomal duplications (WGAC positive
but WSSD negative) were detected in UMD2. However,
neither of these two assemblies is perfect in terms of
totally agreeing with the FISH results, suggesting a room
for further assembly improvement. Another crucial point
is that although UMD2 is different from Btau_4.0 and significantly improved in large, high-identity duplicated
regions identified only by WGAC, our definition of
bovine segmental duplication (union of all WGAC hits
with less than 94% sequence identity and WSSD duplication intervals) is essentially assembly independent. This is
because our computational approaches (WGAC and
WSSD) can effectively detect these local assembly errors
and exclude them from subsequent analyses as false positives. In this sense, it is reasonable to believe that if our
approaches were applied to UMD2, they would produce a
similar estimate of the duplication content. Beyond the
3.1% segmental duplication regions, there are other types
of differences between these two assemblies, such as deletions, inversions and translocations. A systematic

genome-wide FISH comparison of these two assemblies is
beyond the scope of this study but definitely warranted
for the future study.

Additional note
After the completion of this study, a new version of cattle
genome assembly UMD3 was made available at ftp://
ftp.cbcb.umd.edu/pub/data/Bos_taurus/. Similar in silico
analyses were also performed on UMD3 for all BACs in
Tables 4 and 5, yielding essentially the same results as the
analyses reported on UMD2.

Conclusion
In summary, this study provides insights into the bovine
genome evolution and generates a valuable resource for
cattle genomics research. We provide a roadmap for
improving the quality of specific regions of the cattle
genome that will require special care to resolve the copy,
content and structure. Duplicated regions will be an
important complement to SNP centric genome-wide association studies since SNP discovery and genotyping have
been biased against such regions. Characterizing the
impact of copy-number and single basepair variation for
genes embedded within these regions will be a challenging, next step. Such variation will likely be important in
considering the genetic basis of domestication traits and
their selection among diverse cattle breeds.

Methods
Genome Resources
We downloaded Btau_3.1 and Btau_4.0 genomic
sequences from Human genome Sequencing Center at
Baylor College of Medicine ftp://ftp.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/
pub/data/Btaurus/ and whole genome shotgun sequence
(WGS) reads from NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/.

Both cattle genome assemblies were constructed using the
BAC-enrichment strategy, which represents a hybrid
between whole-genome shotgun sequence and cloneordered approaches. Btau_4.0 was constructed by adding
a small amount of sequence data and sequence scaffolds
positioned using the IL-TX radiation hybrid physical map
[29]. Genome sequences were derived from the Hereford
cow L1 Dominette 01449, (Bos Taurus, American Hereford
Association registration number 42190680) with an
inbreeding coefficient was 31%. The source of the BAC
library DNA (CHORI-240) was Hereford bull L1 Domino
99375, registration number 41170496 (Sire of L1 Dominette 01449). UMD2 assembly was downloaded from
ftp://ftp.cbcb.umd.edu/pub/data/Bos_taurus/.
Computational Analysis of Bovine Segmental Duplications
All reported segmental duplication analyses were performed on the Btau_4.0 cattle genome assembly (Oct,
2007). Similar analyses were also performed on an earlier
assembly (Btau_3.1). Two different approaches (WGAC
and WSSD) were performed as previously described
([1,34]. Whole genome assembly comparison (WGAC)
identifies paralogous stretches of sequence through a
BLAST-based strategy which depends on the genome
assemblies. Using the WGAC approach, we totally identified a total of 129,555 pairwise alignments (≥ 1 kb and ≥
90% sequence identity) representing putative duplications. High-copy repeat sequences were initially removed
using RepeatMasker and a newly constructed cow library
of common repeats [29]. Initial seed alignments were ≥
250 bp and ≥ 88% with repeats subsequently reintroduced to create local alignments. These alignments were
then trimmed to better define their end points, and optimal global alignments were performed to generate accurate alignment statistics. As larger, high-identity
duplications (≥ 94%) are frequently collapsed within
working draft sequence assemblies [28] or may represent
artificial duplications within an assembly [34], we compared these WGAC results to whole genome shotgun
sequence detection (WSSD) results. WSSD identifies
regions (≥ 10 kb in length, ≥ 94% sequence identity) with
a significant excess of high-quality WGS reads [1] within
overlapping 5 kb windows. We established thresholds
based on the alignment of WGS reads against 96 unique
cow BACs [53]. BACs were masked for repeats and MegaBLAST alignments of these BACs were performed against a
database of WGS reads. We calculated duplication depth
by counting the number of WGS reads aligning to 5 kb
sliding windows. In addition, we calculated nucleotide
divergence between the WGS reads and the BAC
sequences for each 5 kb window. The distribution of
alignment depth and divergence in this training set allows
empirical thresholds to be determined. Consistent with
previous studies [1-4,7,8], we define significant alignment
depth and divergence scores as those that are greater than

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/571

3 standard deviations from the mean. After training, we
masked the entire bovine reference genome for repeats
with < 10% divergence and all bovine-specific repeat
sequences. We then performed MegaBLAST alignments of
the WGS reads to the reference genome. Our analysis was
based on a comparison of 23,971,214 Bos taurus WGS
reads against 400 kb segments of the Btau_4.0 assembly.
13,523,039 reads were remapped to the assembly based
on the following criteria: ≥ 94% sequence identity; ≥ 200
bp non-repeat-masked bp and at least 200 bp of PhredQ
≥ 30 bp.
Following previous studies [7], we defined segmental
duplications based on the union of significant WGAC hits
with less than 94% sequence identity and WSSD results
(Fig. 1): i.e. WGAC duplication intervals that were greater
than ≥ 94% sequence identity and ≥ 10 kb in size but not
supported by WSSD, were excluded from the genomewide calculation of segmental duplications. Paralogous
sequence relationships (Fig. 2 and Additional File 1: Fig.
S1) were generated using Parasight graphical visualization
software [60].The results of Btau_4.0 analyses including
pairwise sequence alignment locations, statistics, and
gene

are

at

bfgl.anri.barc.usda.gov/cattleSD/.
Bioinformatics Analysis of Organization and Gene
Contents in Segmental Duplications
Gene content of cattle segmental duplications was
assessed using the Glean consensus gene set [29]. Intersections between segmental duplication coordinates and
exon positions were compared using mySQL queries. During our analysis, a total of 9,192 Glean genes (from a
genome total of 26,700) were identified that had been
assigned to duplicated regions. When excluding ChrUnAll, a total of 7,156 Glean genes were identified.

We investigated the genomic distribution of segmental
duplications by testing the hypothesis that pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions were enriched for duplications [34]. Since the pericentromeric and subtelomeric
regions are not well annotated we defined pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions as 3 Mb from the most
centromeric base and 3 Mb from the end(s) of chromosomes, respectively. Since all cattle chromosomes are
acrocentric, with the exception of the X chromosome, this
results in a 3 Mb pericentromeric region at one end of the
chromosome and a 3 Mb subtelomeric region at the other
end of the chromosome. In the case of the X chromosome,
the pericentromeric region was defined as two 1.5 Mb
regions that flank the centromeric region [61] and two 1.5
Mb subtelomeric ends on both ends of the chromosome.
No sequence from ChrUnAll was included. All predicted
duplicated bases that overlap these regions were totaled
and chi-square tests were used to test the null hypothesis

of no enrichment as previously described [34]. Repeat
analysis and simulation were performed as previously
described [4,7].
We obtained a catalog of all bovine peptides from
Ensembl
ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current_fasta/
bos_taurus/pep/. This yielded 26,271 peptides, 1,160 of
which overlap with predicted segmental duplications, and
correspond to 826 unique Ensembl genes. PANTHER
accessions were assigned to all peptides using the PANTHER Hidden Markov Model scoring tools http://
www.pantherdb.org/downloads/. PANTHER accessions
with less than five observations among the duplicated
genes were not analyzed further. We tested the hypothesis
that the remaining PANTHER molecular function, biological process and pathway terms were under- or overrepresented in segmental duplications with the binomial
distribution. Bonferroni corrections were used to correct
p-values for multiple hypothesis testing. It is worth noting
that a portion of the genes in bovine duplication regions
may have been annotated with unknown function or have
not been annotated, which may influence the outcome of
this analysis.

0.1×SSC (three times, high stringency). Digital images
were obtained using a Leica DMRXA epifluorescence

signals, detected with specific filters, were recorded separately as grayscale images. Pseudocoloring and merging of
images were performed using Adobe Photoshop software.

We retrieved the 59 BAC clone sequences based their coordinates on Btau_4.0. We used MegaBLAST to perform
sequence similarity search within Btau_4.0 and UMD2,
respectively. The blast outputs were manually visualized
and compared in parasight [60]. The pattern was roughly
assigned as single vs. duplicated or interchromosomal
duplications (Dup inter) vs. intrachromosomal duplications (Dup intra).

FISH and Image Analysis
Forty-six cattle BAC clones from CHORI-240 were
selected to validate the predictions of bovine segmental
duplications. Additional 13 BAC clones from the same
library were used to compare Btau_4.0 and UMD2. Both
interphase and metaphase nuclei were prepared using a
Hereford smooth muscle cell line isolated from 1 year old
male thoracic aorta (AG08501, Coriell Cell Repositories).
Metaphase nuclei were examined to identify Dup inter or
Dup intra. More intense FISH signals, which localized to
a single site, were subsequently examined by interphase
nuclei. Interphase analyses were performed in replicates
by comparing cells at both G1 and G2 stages of arrest.

with Cy3-dUTP (Perkin-Elmer) by nick-translation. Two
hundred nanograms of labeled probe were used for each
FISH experiment. Hybridization was performed at 37°C
in 2 × SSC, 50% (v/v) formamide, 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate and 3 mg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, in a volume of 10 μL. Post-hybridization washing was at 60°C in
