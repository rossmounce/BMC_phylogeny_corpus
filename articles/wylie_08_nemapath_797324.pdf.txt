Abstract
Background: Nematode.net http://www.nematode.net is a web-accessible resource for
investigating gene sequences from parasitic and free-living nematode genomes. Beyond the wellcharacterized model nematode C. elegans, over 500,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and nearly
600,000 genome survey sequences (GSSs) have been generated from 36 nematode species as part
of the Parasitic Nematode Genomics Program undertaken by the Genome Center at Washington
University School of Medicine. However, these sequencing data are not present in most publicly
available protein databases, which only include sequences in Swiss-Prot. Swiss-Prot, in turn, relies
on GenBank/Embl/DDJP for predicted proteins from complete genomes or full-length proteins.
Description: Here we present the NemaPath pathway server, a web-based pathway-level
visualization tool for navigating putative metabolic pathways for over 30 nematode species,
including 27 parasites. The NemaPath approach consists of two parts: 1) a backend tool to align
and evaluate nematode genomic sequences (curated EST contigs) against the annotated Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) protein database; 2) a web viewing application that
displays annotated KEGG pathway maps based on desired confidence levels of primary sequence
similarity as defined by a user. NemaPath also provides cross-referenced access to nematode
genome information provided by other tools available on Nematode.net, including: detailed
NemaGene EST cluster information; putative translations; GBrowse EST cluster views; links from
nematode data to external databases for corresponding synonymous C. elegans counterparts,
subject matches in KEGG's gene database, and also KEGG Ontology (KO) identification.
Conclusion: The NemaPath server hosts metabolic pathway mappings for 30 nematode species
and is available on the World Wide Web at http://nematode.net/cgi-bin/keggview.cgi. The
nematode source sequences used for the metabolic pathway mappings are available via FTP http://
www.nematode.net/FTP/index.php, as provided by the Genome Center at Washington University
School of Medicine.

Background
Phylum Nematoda and Nematode Genomics
Nematodes or roundworms are one of the most common
phyla of animals, with over 20,000 different described
species [1], ubiquitous in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial environments. They have remarkable life-styles both
in free-living and parasitic variants, having the ability to
adapt to challenging environments or to invade multiple
hosts, respectively. Parasitic nematodes of humans cause
sub-clinical and clinical diseases of major socio-economic
importance globally as ~3 billion people are infected [2].
Financial losses caused by parasites to agriculture (domesticated animals and crops) have a major impact on farm
profitability, exacerbating global food shortage situations
(e.g., plant parasitic nematodes are responsible for $80
billion in annual crop damage [3]). Nematodes have been
studied extensively due to their agricultural and medical
importance; nematode sequencing data have increased at
a rapid rate over the past decade. As of the beginning of
2008, there are over 500,000 Expressed Sequence Tags
(ESTs) in the dbEST division of GenBank originating from
over 40 non-Caenorhabditis nematode species [4], and 32
genomic projects are completed or underway [5].

We expect that complete annotated genomes are approximately 3–4 years away. Therefore, to empower the
broader scientific community the available EST and GSS
sequences from parasitic nematodes require organization
in a functional context, a need underscored by their
absent from the majority of publicly available protein
databases such as Pfam [6] and Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [7]. These protein databases
incorporate only sequences found in Swiss-Prot [8], and
Swiss-Prot in turn relies on GenBank/EMBL/DDJP for predicted proteins from full genomes or full-length proteins.
Hence, nematode-originated EST and GSS sequence data
can only be informative when organized and presented in
an easily accessible, systematic way that can be explored
by the scientific community.
Currently, there are four comprehensive web-based databases available providing tools for exploring nematode
sequences: two model-species-specific databases and two
others encompassing parasitic and free-living nematode
sequences. The model-specific databases include WormBase [9], a model organism database for Caenorhabditis
elegans and other related Caenorhabditis species, and Pristionchus.org [10], a resource dedicated to the major satellite organism Pristionchus pacificus used in studying
evolutionary developmental biology. NEMBASE3 [11]
and Nematode.net [12] are databases concerned with the
aggregation and navigation of sequencing data derived
from multiple free-living and parasitic nematode species.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/525

Nematode Pathway Visualization and Comparison
Here we present NemaPath (made available as a component of Nematode.net) that allows for systematic study of
nematode transcriptomes via enzyme pathway associations. NemaPath compares relatively refined nucleotide
sequences (e.g., full-length cDNAs, clustered ESTs, RefSeq) to the KEGG genes database of curated protein
sequences. Sequences in the KEGG database have known,
annotated Enzyme Commission (EC) [13] system
number associations. By aligning query sequence against
annotated sequence we may assign putative function by
EC number association. The software discards KEGG database entries that do not have associated EC numbers, and
therefore only displays metabolic pathways. As our software makes no assumptions based on prior biological or
biochemical knowledge, the end-user is able to navigate
the full set of returned alignment summaries (strength of
hit as E-value and bit score, subject accession numbers,
etc.) from initial exploratory query sequences.

To eliminate data redundancy, ESTs have been assembled
by identity into NemaGene contigs and further organized
into clusters. ESTs within a contig derive from nearly identical transcripts, whereas contigs within a cluster may represent splice isoforms of a gene or transcripts from multigene families with extremely high sequence identity [14].
NemaPath associations are done on the contig level using
NemaGene contig builds as querying sequences or fulllength genes resulting from genome projects (e.g., C. elegans, Brugia malayi, Ancylostoma caninum and Ascaris
suum). Cluster sequence reports may be viewed online by
reverse lookup using constituent contig IDs from NemaPath's pathway map hit table or by viewing the cluster in
Nematode.net's implementation of the GBrowse [15]
genome viewer.
Finally, summaries of mappings are provided as extendable tree-views, which organize mappings by identified EC
numbers. The summary of pathway mappings when coupled with statistical tools [16] can provide the scientific
community with a solid platform for comparative metabolomics in the Phylum Nematoda.
Although other excellent KEGG pathway mapping software platforms exist for EST-related data – such as ESTExplorer [17] and PathwayExplorer [18] – the main aim of
the NemaPath database is to provide pre-compiled panphylum comparative metabolomics for an important and
oft-studied group of parasites, as well as cross-integration
with other nematode information (e.g., WormBase). As
such, new sequence data are added as they become publicly available without effort at the end-user level. Many of
the nematode-centric KEGG views we provide are unique
unto NemaPath.

Construction and Content
The web-based NemaPath application (see Figure 1 for
workflow) consists of two distinct components: 1) a
server-side application to align and evaluate nematode
transcript and gene sequences against the manually anno-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/525

tated KEGG genes database; 2) a browser accessible pathway viewing application for displaying associations. Both
components are written in Perl [19], the interpreted procedural programming language. A MySQL [20] relational

the form of multi-species gene sequences and multi-nematode sequences, as provided by KEGG and Nematode.net, respectively. KEGG release data (map images, bitmap coordinates, node information) are correlated and placed in the database.
KEGG gene alignments are performed and stored. Users may interrogate the database dynamically and display results through
the World Wide Web.

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:525

database holds shared data and acts as an intermediate
between the two components.
Alignment Association to KEGG
The initial step in the NemaPath pipeline involves analyzing clustered ESTs in context of the latest version of
KEGG's high-quality genomes including manual assignment of orthologies. NemaGene EST contigs [[21], Materials and Methods] are a value-added effort, refinements
include: 1) grouping of the ESTs into contigs based on
sequence similarity; 2) elimination of chimeric ESTs; 3)
accommodation of multiple splice-isoforms; 4) persistence of cluster names when new ESTs are added. For each
contig with multiple EST members, the consensus
sequence is longer and of higher quality than each standalone EST read. The KEGG genes file (used as a database
against which we BLAST our queries) is comprised of concatenated FASTA protein sequences from all of the species
in the KEGG genes database. As of this writing, the KEGG
genes file can be retrieved for academic use by download
via FTP from KEGG ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/kegg/genes/
fasta. Each FASTA entry contains metadata in the header
line: species gene name, protein matched, EC id, and
KEGG Orthology (KO) information. As the metadata represents information arrived at by KEGG's annotation
process, we can make inferred relationships by identity
using our nematode sequences.

WU-BLAST [22] alignments are performed in an automated fashion by a perl application called KEGGscan.
KEGGscan reports compile BLAST results in a tab-delimited format, including E-value and bit score for the alignment, as well as the metadata information pulled from the
KEGG subject's header line. KEGGscan reports are loaded
into the NemaPath database during every NemaPath
build; plaintext report file for each species/build can be
accessed through our web site http://www.nematode.net/
FTP/nemapath_ftp/index.php.
Pathway-Association Navigation
KEGGscan report information is cross-referenced with
corresponding KEGG pathway image map information in
the NemaPath database. EC ids have representative nodes
within KEGG-supplied pathway bitmap images. Associations between NemaGene contig sequence and KEGG
genes are pre-compiled on a per build basis for each NemaPath release. However, a user has the ability to narrow or
broaden the pool of viewable matches by supplying a
threshold for E-value, which is a statistical value of the
quality of the BLAST alignment. To aid the user in this
endeavor, NemaPath supplies an E-value hit distribution
graph for each nematode species.

Once an E-value threshold is chosen, a user is presented
with a table of pathways available for the chosen species;

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/525

only pathways with matches based on the threshold the
user has selected are presented. Choosing a pathway will
present an annotated KEGG pathway image map wherein
EC number nodes will be highlighted (colored) based
upon number of corresponding matches to the node
(darker colors represent enzymes with more matches over
those of lighter color); the highlighted nodes are interactive in that a user may position their mouse pointer over
the node to reveal a hit summary table (see Figure 2). The
table is truncated to the top ten matches based on E-value
for brevity – however, a link is provided within the popup to a page providing all matches for the node. Each
node's hit table provides E-value, subject identifier, corresponding KO numbers, bit score, a link to the EC's summary page on KEGG's web site, and a link to the full
NemaGene parent cluster page for the query contig
sequence. In turn, on the NemaGene cluster page, displayed in GBrowse, there is a link to the pathway in which
the corresponding putative enzyme encoded by the query
is active. Pathway nodes that do not have matches link
directly back to the KEGG entry for the node's EC number
entry. Additionally, on the cluster page for each EST contig
the counterpart C. elegans entry is listed and a link provided to the corresponding elegans gene page in WormBase.
In addition to EST sequence information for multiple species, NemaPath also provides association for four nematode species (C. elegans, B. malayi, A. suum and A.
caninum) for which complete or partial gene sets are available based on finished or low coverage genome sequence.
The C. elegans associations are supplemented with the
information on RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown
[23] candidates. RNA interference (RNAi) has become an
efficient high-throughput approach for rapidly determining the phenotypic effects of transcript knockdown in
many organisms, including C. elegans [24-27]. Gene functions derived from RNAi phenotypes in C. elegans can be
further extrapolated, to an extent, to orthologous genes in
other nematodes where high-throughput screening is not
yet practical [28]. Such functions may also help in identifying or confirming chokepoint reactions as potential
drug targets [29,30] by uniquely consuming a specific
substrate or uniquely producing a specific product in the
metabolic network of a species. Therefore, we incorporated RNAi results in our C. elegans associations by labeling enzymes within pathways (example in Figure 3) as
having associated RNAi phenotypes or not: the enzymes
that are "knocked down" after RNAi are colored in red vs.
the wild type or no RNAi information (yellow and blue
respectively). Chokepoint analyses are particularly
straightforward to perform with a computational representation of metabolism, due to the constraints placed on
the representation, but would be difficult to perform on a

reactions and compounds [30].
Multi-Species Comparison
NemaPath includes a tool to make comparisons between
two nematode species on a pathway level based on associations to a given EC id (see Figure 4). Selection of a second species will highlight EC ids with association to either
of the two species; a pop-up table provides the top ten
matches of highest sequence similarity to the EC ids from
both species at the required E-value threshold. This feature facilitates visual identification of differences in EC
annotations between the two species. In addition to aiding recognition of different reaction routes in a pathway,
enzymes lacking in one of the species or enzymes present
in both species may be distinguished.

Other multi-species views include clade-specific and hostspecific aggregations that incorporate only the best
matches (by lowest E-value better than 1e-05) to each gene

belonging to a clade or host category. Sequence data are
currently available for four (I, III, IV and V) of the five
nematode phylogenetic clades. All five clades include parasitic species and parasitism is hypothesized to have
arisen independently multiple times [31]. Comparative
analyses between these clades may provide valuable information; hence, we provide an interface for viewing cladespecific NemaPath annotations. In addition to cladebased comparisons, we provide a host-specific comparative view that differentiates animal parasites, plant parasites and free-living nematodes.

Utility and Discussion
NemaPath Research Application for Nematology
With algorithm improvements and ever-faster expansion
of biological sequence databases, sequence comparison
has become a basic but critical tool in the post-genomic
era. Putative functions of newly obtained sequencing data
can be easily inferred by similarity search to the currently
characterized proteins when those sequences contain sim-

ilarities significant enough to be detected on the primary
sequence level. However, while individual mappings are
frequently used for detailed studies, organized hierarchical annotations of genes provide an understanding of biological systems as a whole – namely how individual genes
interact as parts of complexes, pathways, and networks. As

a result, nematologists have used the KEGG interaction
and reaction network associations for intra- and inter-specific comparative studies and pan-phylum comparative
studies. Such in silico comparative metabolomics have
identified metabolic features that are taxonomically
restricted and/or enriched in specific stages or tissues. For

example, a pan-phylum analysis based on 93,000 genes of
partial genomes in 32 nematode species when compared
to the KEGG database identified taxonomically restricted
biochemical pathways that may serve to direct drug target
definition [32]. Comparative metabolic pathway analysis
in the human intestinal nematode parasite Strongyloides
stercoralis when compared to the metabolic pathways of

the free-living nematode C. elegans, revealed down regulation of nucleotide sugar metabolism in infective L3 and
dauer stage which is consistent with the lack of new cell
division and DNA replication in these developmentally
arrested stages [14]. Dissimilar expression profiles of
genes for metabolic enzymes of Heterodera glycines infective J2 and C. elegans have been reported [33] based on in-

depth analysis of ESTs and microarray expression data.
Finally, comparison of relative coverage of metabolic
enzymes of the adult heartworm Dirofilaria immitis compared to C. elegans, have supported a hypothesis that the
adult heartworm D. immitis takes advantages of a anaerobic electron transfer-based energy generation system distinct from the aerobic pathway utilized by its mammalian
hosts [34], an observation leading to a promising candidate pathway for development of new macrofilaricides. A
hypergeometric statistic test on the extent of KEGG
Orthology (KO) groups in the first tissue-level comparative study of nematode intestines has revealed that the
major pathways of carbohydrate metabolism and energy
metabolism are two commonly over-represented metabolic features in intestines of gastrointestinal parasitic
nematodes Ascaris suum, Haemonchus contortus, and the
free-living C. elegans [35].
As a step towards a full-scale genome project of Ancylostoma caninum – a hookworm of canids used as a model for
studying human infections – 104,000 GSSs were generated and subsequently assembled into 57.6 Mb of unique
sequence, resulting in gene identification of 9113 nonredundant genes (5538 based on GSSs and 3575 based on
ESTs); functional classifications of many of the 70% of
genes with homology to genes in other species were possible based on gene ontology and KEGG placement [36].
Validations and Limitations
Every effort has been made to improve the quality and
fidelity of EST sequences by NemaGene clustering. However, final cluster products are putative, partial gene representations built on the most current information
available. Enzyme Commission numbers are assigned to
NemaGene contigs in the NemaPath database by primary
sequence similarity. As such, associations include the
caveats pertaining to any automated, high throughput
alignment analysis.

To assess the accuracy of our methods, the NemaPath
associations of the complete full-length gene set for C. elegans was compared to the metabolic pathways in C. elegans in the KEGG database. This validation screen was
performed using two cutoffs (1e-30 and 1e-100) and identified a number of unique EC ids by the original KEGG
associations and also our NemaPath associations. Using
1e-30 and 1e-100 as a cutoff, we identified that 1e-100 gave a
number of unique EC mappings closer to the original
KEGG associations. Only in 4 out of 94 pathways were the
number of EC ids identified by NemaPath were lower
than in KEGG's C. elegans reference pathway. The revealed
differences, consistently higher EC ids identified by NemaPath, are mainly based on the manual curation of the
KEGG mappings compared to our automated associations
guided by cutoff value; our associations do not account

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/525

for the ancillary information included in KEGG Orthology numbers (KO) generation.
KO numbers incorporate ancillary information (i.e., manual curation) that is not represented in the EC number
annotation. KO is a further extension of this scheme (similarity-based automatic EC id association) based on computational analysis – as well as manual curation – of SSDB
ortholog clusters in order to classify all gene functions and
explore unknown pathways [37]. NemaPath does provide
direct representation of KO assignment, but does not
exclude EC associations in specific pathways based on a
priori KO knowledge. By design, an association of a user's
query sequence to a particular EC identifier will be highlighted in every pathway where the EC id exists, rather
than exclude information from the end-user or enforce
presumptive omissions. Partial EC numbers (e.g., 1.1.-.-)
are not excluded; care must be taken in their interpretation. The ambiguous nature of the partial EC number
allows different enzymes that catalyze different reactions
to share the same identifier within the same class, even
though this does not necessarily mean they have the same
activities [38].
Because we do not provide exhaustive curation, proper
interpretation requires the user's cognizance of the metabolic pathways, as well as an understanding of KEGG
annotation and vocabulary.
Future Directions
All species-to-KEGG associations in NemaPath are recompiled each time KEGG releases a new version of their
genes database (as of this writing the associations are
made using KEGG release 46). New nematode species are
added post NemaGene clustering. Genome sequencing
projects of several free-living and parasitic nematode species are underway or planned [39], and the associations to
KEGG metabolic pathways will be included as the data
become available. Furthermore, future builds of NemaPath will not be limited to metabolic pathways, nematode
sequence associations will include other manually drawn
pathway maps representing molecular interactions and
reaction networks. Also, further development will allow
multi-species comparison beyond the current two-species
similarity view supported by NemaPath.

Conclusion
NemaPath, the database described herein, provides the
research community a unique resource for pathway visualization of multi-species nematode genomic data in
terms of KEGG database vocabulary. NemaPath is part of
the larger Nematode.net web resource and integrates well
with the site's previous functionality, streamlining access
to significant internal nematode sequence data, as well as
