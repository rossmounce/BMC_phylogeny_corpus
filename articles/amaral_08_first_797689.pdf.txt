Abstract
Background: The recently constructed river buffalo whole-genome radiation hybrid panel
(BBURH5000) has already been used to generate preliminary radiation hybrid (RH) maps for several
chromosomes, and buffalo-bovine comparative chromosome maps have been constructed. Here,

we present the first-generation whole genome RH map (WG-RH) of the river buffalo generated
from cattle-derived markers. The RH maps aligned to bovine genome sequence assembly Btau_4.0,
providing valuable comparative mapping information for both species.
Results: A total of 3990 markers were typed on the BBURH5000 panel, of which 3072 were cattle
derived SNPs. The remaining 918 were classified as cattle sequence tagged site (STS), including
coding genes, ESTs, and microsatellites. Average retention frequency per chromosome was 27.3%
calculated with 3093 scorable markers distributed in 43 linkage groups covering all autosomes (24)
and the X chromosomes at a LOD ≥ 8. The estimated total length of the WG-RH map is 36,933
cR5000. Fewer than 15% of the markers (472) could not be placed within any linkage group at a LOD
score ≥ 8. Linkage group order for each chromosome was determined by incorporation of markers
previously assigned by FISH and by alignment with the bovine genome sequence assembly
(Btau_4.0).
Conclusion: We obtained radiation hybrid chromosome maps for the entire river buffalo genome
based on cattle-derived markers. The alignments of our RH maps to the current bovine genome
sequence assembly (Btau_4.0) indicate regions of possible rearrangements between the
chromosomes of both species. The river buffalo represents an important agricultural species whose
genetic improvement has lagged behind other species due to limited prior genomic
characterization. We present the first-generation RH map which provides a more extensive
resource for positional candidate cloning of genes associated with complex traits and also for largescale physical mapping of the river buffalo genome.

Background
Among domestic animals, the water buffalo (Bubalus
bubalis), particularly the river buffalo, holds great promise
and potential for animal production. According to estimates by the "Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations" the global water buffalo population has
increased 98% in the last decades, from 88 million in
1961 to 174 million in 2005. Buffalo is the most important farm animal species in Asia, especially India, where it
is extensively used for milk, meat, fuel and fertilizer production (from manure), as well as for draught power [1].
Currently, river buffalo can be found in many countries
worldwide. The growth of its population outside of the
Asian continent is mainly related to the increasing interest
in milk production used to produce cream, butter, yogurt
and many cheeses. Brazil, for instance, is the largest buffalo breeding center outside the Asian continent holding
the largest buffalo herd in the Americas.
River buffalo, along with domestic cattle, belongs to the
subfamily Bovinae whereas sheep and goat belong to the
subfamily Caprinae, all members of the family Bovidae.
These species have been shown to be closely related, sharing homology in chromosome banding [2-5] and gene
mapping [6-9], and have been cytogenetically characterized in detail.
Cattle (Bos taurus, BTA) and river buffalo (Bubalus bubalis,
BBU) chromosomes can be matched arm for arm at the
cytogenetic level [9-12]. While the cattle genome consists

of 29 acrocentric autosomes and a pair, X/Y, of sexual
chromosomes, the river buffalo genome has 5 biarmed
and 19 acrocentric autosomes plus the X and Y chromosomes [13]. All buffalo chromosomes arms have homology to single bovine acrocentric chromosomes. BBU1
appears to be a fusion of BTA1 and 27, BBU2 equals BTA2
and 23, BBU3 equals BTA8 and 19, BBU4 equals BTA5
and 28, and BBU5 equals BTA16 and 29 at the cytogenetic
level with state of the art banding. All the other chromosomes have a one to one correspondence between the two
species [9,14].
Although the latest cytogenetic map of the river buffalo
genome reports 388 FISH-mapped loci [11], much
remains to be done in order to generate high resolution
maps of the buffalo genome.
The radiation hybrid (RH) mapping approach has been
established as the method of choice to generate medium
to high resolution maps. RH panels are available for several domestic mammalian species such as cow [15], pig
[16], horse [17,18], dog [19] and cat [20]. The production
of a RH panel in river buffalo is quite recent [21]. It has
been used to construct preliminary RH maps for individual buffalo chromosomes, BBU1 [22]; BBU3 and 10 [21];
BBU7 [23]; BBU6 [24] and BBUX [25]. These preliminary
maps, based on cattle-derived markers, demonstrated that
the bovine genome is a useful source of markers for the
buffalo genome mapping allowing rapid and efficient
transfer of information from cattle to buffalo.

Taking advantage of the extensive resources and tools now
available as a result of the bovine genome sequencing
project, and given the close evolutionary relationship
between cattle and river buffalo, the opportunity was
available for study of the buffalo genome on a large scale
to detect micro rearrangements in the marker order that
might have taken place during the evolutionary divergence of these species. Of particular importance is the
comparison of gene order between the two ruminant species, buffalo and cattle, and an assessment of rearrangements which is independent of previous, more limited
comparisons done with specific markers of the two species by somatic hybrid cell analysis and FISH.
A high resolution genome map of buffalo will be an
important tool for evaluating chromosomal evolution
among species of Bovidae which, according to several
phylogenetic studies, are separated by only a few million
years [26-28]. It will therefore facilitate extrapolation of
data from cattle genomics and at some point aid in the
development of additional genomic tools for buffalo.
Here, we report the use of the BBURH5000 panel to construct the first-generation whole genome radiation hybrid
map (WG-RH) of the river buffalo containing more than
2500 cattle-derived loci covering all autosomes and the X
chromosome.

Results and discussion
In this report, we present the first-generation whole
genome radiation hybrid map of the river buffalo (BBU
WG-RH). From the total of 3093 markers used to assemble the maps, 472 could not be placed on the maps, so
2621 are included on the RH maps of 24 autosomes and
the X chromosome.
This is the first genome-wide RH map of the river buffalo
and establishes a base genomic map from which higher
resolution maps can be generated in the future. This first
generation map also provides a characterization of the
BBURH5000 panel allowing estimation of its potential
limit of resolution. The BBU WG-RH map spans a total of
36,933 cR. However, accurate physical distances are not
available for the genome lengths spanned by this WG-RH
map. Because karyotype analysis indicates extensive similarity at the level of chromosome arms between buffalo
and cattle, and presuming a genome size of 3000 Mbp in
both species, we extrapolate the physical distance of the
buffalo genome to be approximately 2623 Mbp, providing an estimate of 73.6 kb/cR5000. The BBURH5000 panel
clones retained buffalo DNA with an average retention
rate of 27.3% and 73.6 kb/cR5000. A summary of the river
buffalo WG-RH map statistics is shown in Additional file
1.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/631

Markers were distributed into linkage groups based on
two-point LOD score threshold of ≥ 8 to assign linkage to
a particular group of markers and not to others located on
different chromosomes. A total of 43 linkage groups were
generated for the whole genome. The number of markers
mapped to each chromosome varied from 49 (BBU22) to
233 (BBU2). The RH maps from the bi-armed chromosomes presented at least two linkage groups (one for each
arm) with the exception of BBU 5, in which markers were
distributed into a single linkage group. Among the acrocentric chromosomes, the number of linkage groups
ranged from 1–5 with BBU8 containing the greatest
number of linkage groups (5), but also had the fewest
mapped cattle-derived STS markers (2). Considering that
the markers mapped on BBU8 are almost entirely derived
from cattle SNPs, the increased number of linkage groups
observed might be related to the irregular distribution of
the SNPs on the bovine chromosome 4, which is known
to be homologous to BBU8. The number of linkage
groups and the total number of markers per chromosome
is also presented in Additional file 1.
The average retention frequency (RF) for the data set is
27.3%, with the frequency for individual autosomes varying from 18.9% on BBU9 to 37.2% on BBU3, which contains the selectable marker thymidine kinase (Additional
file 1). The average retention frequency per chromosome
observed on the BBURH panel is similar to the estimates
reported for other 5000 rad panels such as those constructed for cattle [15], horse [29] and dog [30]. The relatively low RF for BBUX (15.6%) was expected, since the
buffalo parental cell line was created from a male animal.
The variation in retention frequency for each chromosome is shown graphically in figure 1.
Preliminary RH maps for individual BBU chromosomes
(BBU1, 3, 6, 7, 10 and X) have been previously published
[21-25]. The new maps presented herein demonstrate a
considerable increase in the number of mapped markers
resulting in maps with greatly improved coverage over the
previously published data. In addition to 19 chromosome
maps published for the first time, the remaining six chromosomes are presented with the following number of
additional markers: BBU1 (+133), BBU3 (+141), BBU6
(+114), BBU7 (+ 84), BBU10 (+74) and BBUX (+ 31). An
example is shown in figure 2 with BBU6 illustrating the
improvement regarding the marker density obtained with
the new RH map. In general, the order of the markers
between the new and the previous RH maps shows a high
level of agreement except for minor flips involving closely
linked loci.
To date, this is the first whole genome RH and comparative map produced for the river buffalo. Also, this is the
first report illustrating the extensive use of cross-species

oligo assays to produce RH maps, a technique which contributed significantly to the total number of markers
placed on the maps. In addition, this BBU WG-RH map,
containing 2621 markers, is the most dense among the
first-generation RH maps produced for other domestic
species, such as pig (757 markers) [31], cattle (1087 markers) [32], horse (730 markers) [29], cat (600 markers)
[33] and dog (400 markers) [30]. In addition, this map
was assembled with fewer RH linkage groups (43) than
previously-reported for first-generation RH maps in cattle
(61) [32], pig (128) [31] and horse (101) [29].
Because traditional genetic maps are not currently available for river buffalo, we compared the order of the markers from the BBU-WG RH maps to the current bovine
genome sequence assembly (NCBI Btau_4.0). Figure 3
shows a schematic overview of the WG-RH map in comparison with their respective homologous chromosome in
BTA. To be able to extrapolate the information between
the genomes it is necessary to align conserved segments
accurately between species. Mapping a large number of

markers on the buffalo genome and cross-referencing
these with the map locations for the markers in the bovine
achieved this alignment.
Sixty-eight markers previously assigned by fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) [11] were incorporated into the
RH maps serving as anchor markers for the RH maps to
correctly orient the linkage groups. All chromosomes,
except BBU15, had at least one marker previously mapped
by FISH represented on the respective RH map. Figure 4
shows in detail the comparative mapping between the
BBU1 RH map, the latest G-banded ideogram of the river
buffalo chromosome [11] and the alignment with the
bovine genome sequence assembly (Btau_4.0). Considering the large number of mapped markers, only one
marker per 50 cR is presented in the RH map figure for
better illustration. The individual BBU RH comparative
maps from the entire buffalo genome are displayed in
additional file 2. Also, a complete version of the RH maps
containing all the mapped markers can be viewed at the
National Center for Biological (NCBI) river buffalo

Figure 3 of the WG-RH map in comparison with their respective homologous chromosome in BTA
Overview
Overview of the WG-RH map in comparison with their respective homologous chromosome in BTA. For each
comparison the buffalo chromosome is on the left and the homologous bovine chromosome is on the right. If a buffalo chromosome is represented by more then one linkage group, they are labeled alphabetically, with 'a' being the largest linkage group.
Lines between the maps connect markers common in both maps. Distances on the buffalo chromosomes are scaled in cR and
always start at the top of the map except for linkage group 'b' in maps BBU1-4, which start at the bottom. Distances on the
bovine chromosome are scaled in bp and always start at the centromere.

Figure 4
(Btau_4.0) of the BBU1 RH map, the latest cytogenetic map and the alignment with the BTA1 and BTA27 sequence assembly
Comparison
Comparison of the BBU1 RH map, the latest cytogenetic map and the alignment with the BTA1 and BTA27
sequence assembly (Btau_4.0). The BBU1 RH map is shown in the centre, the G-banded ideogram on the left and the corresponding cattle chromosomes on the right. The distances in cR5000 and Mbp are shown below each corresponding map.
Considering the large number of mapped markers, only one marker per 50 cR is shown in the RH map. The BTA1 and BTA27
sequence maps shows one marker every 10 Mbp. Markers common to both BBU RH and the cattle sequence are joined by a
solid black line or a solid red line. Solid red lines indicate markers which are oriented sequentially regarding the cattle but
inverted. A solid black line also joins those markers on the BBU RH map that have been physically mapped by FISH to their
location on the ideogram (Di Meo et al. 2008).

The comparison revealed few disagreements between the
BBU RH maps, the cytogenetic map and the bovine
sequence assembly. Marker order within the linkage
groups for the buffalo chromosomes was consistent with
the bovine genome assembly and, where information was
available, in agreement with the cytogenetic assignment.
As indicated on Figure 4, few discrepancies on the markers
order were observed. Interestingly, most of the disagreements observed with the bovine sequence assembly, for
example, those observed on BBU4, BBU5 and BBU12,
involved markers derived from cattle SNPs. An exception
was observed on the BBU7 RH map, which showed disagreements on the position of five genes, KLHL8, TRAM1L1
and UGDH from LG7a and, GPR103 and TKL2 from
LG7b. These discrepancies in marker order within conserved segments might indicate small chromosome rearrangements, but could also be due to the insufficient
resolution of the RH map in specific regions of the chromosomes or mistakes in the bovine sequence assembly.
The number of observed disagreements in marker order
positions among our RH maps and the bovine sequence
and the river buffalo cytogenetic assignment may contribute to improved maps for buffalo as well as maps for other
members of the Bovidae family.
Considering the limited genomic resources available for
the river buffalo, the comparative mapping information
presented here can be used to identify chromosomal
regions potentially associate with traits that have been
genetically mapped in other livestock. With the availability of the bovine genome sequence assembly it was possible to align the buffalo RH maps with the bovine genome
and to obtain a large amount of information on the markers likely to also be found at a particular chromosomal
location in buffalo.

Conclusion
We have built the first-generation radiation hybrid map of
the river buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) genome using the
BBURH5000 panel and cattle-derived markers. Considering
that genetic maps are absent for river buffalo, our goal was
to provide a resource for positional candidate cloning of
genes associate with complex traits and also for large-scale
physical mapping of the river buffalo genome. The comparison with the bovine sequence assembly provides
information sufficient for genome-wide scans to detect
chromosomal regions contributing to economically
important traits in river buffalo.

Methods
Selection of the markers
In order to link the BBU WG-RH map to the bovine
genome sequence, only cattle-derived markers were used.
Markers were selected from published cattle linkage and
RH maps based on their location on cattle chromosomes
homologous to buffalo chromosomes. A total of 3990
markers were typed on the BBURH5000 panel, of which
3072 were cattle-derived SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism), originated from Oligo pooled assays (OPA)
synthesized and assembled by Illumina Inc. (San Diego,
CA). These SNPs were a subset of previously characterized
bovine SNPs [34] and were selected to be evenly distributed along the bovine genome (Btau_2.0).

The remaining 918 markers, classified as cattle "sequence
tagged site" (STS), included bovine coding genes, ESTs
(expressed sequence tags) and microsatellites. All markers
used and their information details are available at the
National Center for Biological (NCBI) Information database (ProbeDB) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/
probe/reports/probereport.cgi Additional file 3 contains
the identification numbers of the markers displayed on
the database.
RH Vectors
RH vectors were produced by one of three different detection methods: conventional gel-based scoring, PCR dissociation curve analysis, or Illumina SNP analysis (detailed
below).

The Illumina SNP-based RH vectors were generated by
computer calling and by manual calling. RH vectors of
markers derived from cattle STS were mostly generated
using agarose gel analysis, except markers from BBU2 and
BBU20, which were genotyped using dissociation curve
analysis.
RH panel genotyping based on agarose gels
DNA obtained from each RH cell line was diluted to a
concentration of 25 ng/ul. The markers were typed on
DNA from the 90 radiation hybrid lines together with
control bovine and hamster DNA by PCR in 96-well
microtiter plates. Each PCR reaction was performed in 10μl reaction mixtures containing 50 ng of DNA; 1.5 mM
MgCl2; 10 mM Tris-HCl; 50 mM KCl; 0.2 mM dGTP,
dTTP, dATP and dCTP; 10 pmol each forward and reverse
primer and 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (AmpliTaq
Gold; PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The
reactions were performed in 96-well PCR plates on thermal cyclers with thermal gradient software, where available. PCR conditions included 95°C for 10 min; 35 cycles
of 95°C for 30 sec, 65°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 30 sec;
with a final extension cycle of 72°C for 7 min. PCR products were visualized on 2% agarose gels in 1.0× TBE buffer

and stained with ethidium bromide. Each primer was
typed twice on the RH panel to insure reproducibility.
Strong amplification products were scored as (1), weak
products as (2), and absence of amplification products
was assigned as (0). Markers with discrepancies between
the results from the first two runs were retyped a third
time. Scores from each RH clone for each primer was
entered into a Microsoft Excel spread sheet.

data and compare them to the positive and negative controls. There were 864 and 2075 markers typed by manual
and computer methods, respectively. Using markers that
were in common to both methods (755 markers), the
accuracy of computer scoring was determined. Compared
to manual calls, computational scoring was 98.0% accurate at determining present calls and 98.8% accurate for
absent calls.

RH panel genotyping based on Dissociation Curve Analysis
Real-time PCR was performed in a 20 μl reaction containing 20 ng template DNA, 1X PowerSYBR® Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and 300 nM
primers[35]. Amplification was carried out in 96-well
plates in either a 7900HT or a 7500 sequence detection
system (Applied Biosystems) with the manufacturer's
default thermal profile (50°C for 2 minutes, 95°C for 10
minutes, and 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C
for 1 minute) followed by a dissociation stage (95°C for
15 seconds, 60°C for 15 seconds, followed by a slow
ramp to 95°C) The incubation at 50°C was not necessary,
but the default profile was not changed. To test a semiautomated method, 10 μl reactions containing 10 ng template DNA were set up in 384-well format by a Precision
2000 Plus automated microplate pipetting system (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT) and amplified in a
7900HT sequence detection system with the same thermal
profile as described above. Amplification and dissociation
data were analyzed with SDS software v.2.2.2 (Applied
Biosystems). Radiation hybrid clones were scored independently by two people for presence or absence of the
peak representing the river buffalo product. The scores
were compared and discrepancies that were not clerical
errors were scored as questionable.

Mapping of markers against the bovine sequence assembly
Genomic sequence coordinates for the SNP markers were
determined by performing BLAST [37] comparisons of the
SNP flanking sequences against the latest bovine genome
assembly (Btau_4.0 – http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/
projects/bovine/) [38], using an expect threshold of 1e50. Positions of the STS markers on Btau_4.0 were
obtained by performing in-silico
PCR http://
genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgPcr with primers designed for
the STS markers.

RH panel genotyping based on cattle SNP
DNA from the 90 cell lines of the BBURH5000 panel as well
as hamster and bovine control DNA were typed using the
Illumina BeadStation 500G genotyping system [36]. The
presence or absence of SNP markers in the hybrids was
determined using two methods: manual and computer
scoring. Manual scoring was performed according to
methods previously described [34]. Briefly, Illumina
BeadStudio (Version 3) software was used to visualize all
the hybrids and the controls for a single marker with a cartesian plot where the X- and Y-axis represent the intensities of the A and B allele, respectively. Hybrids form
distinct clusters depending on the presence or absence of
the marker and when compared to the positive and negative controls, this allows easy scoring. Although much
faster then conventional scoring by PCR, this method can
still take considerable time to perform for thousands of
markers. We sought to automate this process through
computer scoring. We created a Java program to analyze
the intensities of the A and B alleles from the Illumina

RH data analysis
Of the 3093 markers that generated RH vectors, 2621 were
assigned to 43 linkage groups of 5 markers or more based
on two-point analysis using CarthaGene [39]. A minimum LOD score of 8 was used as evidence of linkage. RH
linkage groups were assigned to chromosomes based on a
comparison of the markers in each group with the position of the markers on Btau_4.0. The buffalo chromosome
was then determined by knowing the respective homologous chromosome in BTA [11]. Where more then one
linkage group was associated with a chromosome, the
groups were named by size (a, b, c, etc.), with 'a' having
the most markers. The marker order of each linkage group
was determined as described previously [40]. Briefly, RH
maps were constructed using the comparative mapping
approach of the CarthaGene software package [39,41].
This approach takes advantage of the known marker order
in a closely related completely sequenced organism. The
reference order used in this analysis was the order of the
SNP and STS markers in the latest bovine genome assembly (Btau_4.0). Markers with compatible retention patterns (double markers) were merged together. RH maps
were first generated by converting the RH data into a
"Traveling Salesman Problem" and solving using the LinKernighan heuristic based commands: lkh, lkhn, lkhl, and
lkhd [42]. The greedy command was used on each RH
linkage group which tries to improve the marker order
using a taboo search algorithm. Each map was refined further by iteratively testing all marker permutations in a
sliding window of size 7 (flips) and then testing the reliability of the map by displacing each marker in all possible
intervals (polish). While maps were initially generated
using the haploid equal retention model, all final map
distances, except BBUX, were generated using the diploid

equal retention model. Final maps were drawn using

Comparative maps from the buffalo genome (24 autosomes and the X
chromosome), including the RH maps, the latest G-banded ideogram
of the river buffalo chromosomes and the alignment with the bovine
genome sequence assembly (Btau_4.0). The RH maps are shown in the
centre, the G-banded ideogram on the left and the corresponding cattle
chromosomes on the right. The distances in cR5000 and Mbp are shown
below each corresponding map. For better illustration, the BBU RH maps
of the autosomes shows one marker per 50 cR and the BTA sequence maps
shows one marker every 10 Mbp. Markers common to both BBU RH and
the cattle sequence are joined by a solid black line or a solid red line. Solid
red lines indicate markers which are oriented sequentially regarding the
cattle but inverted. A solid black line also joins those markers on the BBU
RH map that have been physically mapped by FISH to their location on
the ideogram (Di Meo et al. 2008).
