A remarkably stable TipE gene cluster: evolution
of insect Para sodium channel auxiliary subunits
Jia Li1,2, Robert M Waterhouse1,2 and Evgeny M Zdobnov1,2,3*

Abstract
Background: First identified in fruit flies with temperature-sensitive paralysis phenotypes, the Drosophila
melanogaster TipE locus encodes four voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channel auxiliary subunits. This cluster of TipE-like
genes on chromosome 3L, and a fifth family member on chromosome 3R, are important for the optional
expression and functionality of the Para NaV channel but appear quite distinct from auxiliary subunits in
vertebrates. Here, we exploited available arthropod genomic resources to trace the origin of TipE-like genes by
mapping their evolutionary histories and examining their genomic architectures.
Results: We identified a remarkably conserved synteny block of TipE-like orthologues with well-maintained local
gene arrangements from 21 insect species. Homologues in the water flea, Daphnia pulex, suggest an ancestral
pancrustacean repertoire of four TipE-like genes; a subsequent gene duplication may have generated functional
redundancy allowing gene losses in the silk moth and mosquitoes. Intronic nesting of the insect TipE gene cluster
probably occurred following the divergence from crustaceans, but in the flour beetle and silk moth genomes the
clusters apparently escaped from nesting. Across Pancrustacea, TipE gene family members have experienced
intronic nesting, escape from nesting, retrotransposition, translocation, and gene loss events while generally
maintaining their local gene neighbourhoods. D. melanogaster TipE-like genes exhibit coordinated spatial and
temporal regulation of expression distinct from their host gene but well-correlated with their regulatory target, the
Para NaV channel, suggesting that functional constraints may preserve the TipE gene cluster. We identified
homology between TipE-like NaV channel regulators and vertebrate Slo-beta auxiliary subunits of big-conductance
calcium-activated potassium (BKCa) channels, which suggests that ion channel regulatory partners have evolved
distinct lineage-specific characteristics.
Conclusions: TipE-like genes form a remarkably conserved genomic cluster across all examined insect genomes.
This study reveals likely structural and functional constraints on the genomic evolution of insect TipE gene family
members maintained in synteny over hundreds of millions of years of evolution. The likely common origin of these
NaV channel regulators with BKCa auxiliary subunits highlights the evolutionary plasticity of ion channel regulatory
mechanisms.

Background
Voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels control the passage of sodium ions across the plasma membrane and
play a crucial role in the creation and propagation of
electrical signals in excitable cells, such as neurons and
myocytes. The pore-forming alpha subunits comprise a
gene family of up to ten members in vertebrate species
[1], which are associated with four types of auxiliary

beta-subunits that are important for the biogenesis and
gating kinetics of functional alpha-subunits [2]. In contrast, only two NaV channel alpha-subunit genes are
found in insects, orthologues of Drosophila melanogaster
DSC1 (Drosophila sodium channel 1) and Para (paralytic), and sequence homology searches fail to identify
homologues of the vertebrate Na V channel auxiliary
beta-subunits. Although DSC1 may rather function as a
calcium channel involved in olfactory avoidance
responses [1,3,4], Para mutants exhibit temperature-sensitive paralysis caused by loss of Na + -based action
potentials [5-8]. Thus, insect genomes appear to encode

only one functional NaV channel alpha-subunit gene and
no orthologues of the vertebrate NaV channel auxiliary
beta-subunits.
Studies of temperature-sensitive paralysis phenotypes
in D. melanogaster identified a role for the TipE locus
(temperature-induced paralysis locus E) in cell excitability, and suggested regulatory interactions with the Para
Na V channel [9,10]. Subsequent identification of the
TipE gene facilitated studies that demonstrated its NaV
channel regulator activity by stimulating functional
expression of Para in Xenopus oocytes, and established
that TipE expression during pupal development rescued
the paralysis phenotype in adult fruit flies [11]. Moreover, sodium-dependent repetitive firing in Drosophila
neurons is regulated by TipE [12], and Para-TipE interactions influence the pharmacology of the Para Na V
channel [13]. Despite the lack of insect orthologues of
vertebrate NaV channel auxiliary beta-subunits, characterization of the D. melanogaster TipE gene revealed
strikingly similar functions: an auxiliary subunit required
for the correct assembly and gating of the Para Na V
channel. Furthermore, four homologues of TipE (Teh14) are encoded in the D. melanogaster genome and their
TipE-like functions as auxiliary subunits of Para Na V
channels have been characterized through co-expression
with Para in Xenopus oocytes [14]. Thus, fruit fly TipE
gene family members are important for the optimal
expression and functionality of the Para Na V channel
but appear quite distinct from auxiliary beta-subunits in
vertebrates.
Their key roles in membrane excitability make insect
NaV channels attractive targets for the development of
insecticides [13,15,16]. However, Para mutations lead to
knockdown resistance in insects and other arthropods,
which reduces the efficacy of many insecticides and
intensifies the search for alternative targets [17-19].
Characterizing the evolutionary histories and molecular
functions of insect TipE gene family members will not
only further the understanding of the mechanisms controlling cell excitability, but may also offer novel opportunities for developing alternative insect control
strategies. In this study, we examined the genealogies of
TipE gene family members across multiple insect species
with sequenced genomes, and revealed a remarkably
conserved synteny block of TipE homologues with local
gene arrangements that have been well-maintained in
many insect genomes over hundreds of millions of years
of evolution.

A genomic cluster of TipE gene family members

species lead to the rapid decay of synteny, leaving only a

few identifiable conserved gene clusters [20]. Examples
of such well-maintained local gene arrangements include
the homeobox (Hox) [21] and wingless (Wnt) [22] gene
clusters with key roles in early development. Synteny
block analysis across 23 arthropod species with
sequenced genomes (see Methods) identified both Hox
and Wnt gene clusters, and highlighted a genomic cluster of TipE gene family members as one of the most
conserved blocks of orthologues with well-maintained
local gene arrangements. This highly conserved synteny
block was defined by a core of three sets of orthologous
genes from 20 insect species: Drosophila melanogaster
and 11 other fruit flies; three mosquitoes: Anopheles
gambiae, Aedes aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus; the
silk moth, Bombyx mori; the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum; the parasitoid wasp, Nasonia vitripennis; the
honey bee, Apis mellifera; and the human body louse,
Pediculus humanus. Sequence homology searches of
genomic resources of the remaining sequenced arthropod species revealed a similarly conserved gene arrangement in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, as well as
four TipE homologues in the crustacean water flea,
Daphnia pulex, but no homologous genes in the arachnid deer tick, Ixodes scapularis (possibly due to
incomplete genome sequencing). The three D. melanogaster genes are located in a ~15 kb region of chromosome 3L and encode the Para Na V channel auxiliary
subunits, Teh2, Teh3, and TipE. Directly neighbouring
the Teh2 gene is a fourth homologue, Teh4, which,
together with Teh1 on chromosome 3R, make up the
full complement of five D. melanogaster TipE gene
family members. The conservation of the Teh2-Teh3TipE synteny block across Insecta, despite generally high
rates of genomic shuffling [20] and gene losses [23] over
more than ~350 million years of evolution [24], suggests
that strong constraints have maintained the local genomic architecture of the TipE locus (Figure 1).
Comparative analysis of the TipE gene family previously identified orthologues of D. melanogaster TipE,
Teh1, Teh2, and Teh3 from A. gambiae, B. mori, and A.
mellifera, as well as orthologues of all five family members from two other fruit flies, D. pseudoobscura and D.
yakuba, and noted their similar genomic clustering [14].
Inspecting the genomic loci of all TipE gene family
members in D. pulex and each of the 21 insect genomes
facilitated comprehensive gene model curation to confirm and correct their predicted genomic architectures
and protein-coding sequences (see Methods). These analyses identified the previously unannotated A. pisum
TipE orthologue and the A. aegypti Teh1 orthologue,
corrected the previously split gene model of the A.
pisum Teh2 orthologue, and improved several other
gene model annotations (see Additional file 1, Table S1
for full details on all corrected gene models). The

Figure 1 Genomic organization of TipE gene family members in 11 insect species and Daphnia pulex. TipE gene family members exhibit
well-maintained local gene neighbourhoods across Insecta. Orthologues of Drosophila melanogaster (Dmela) TipE (red), Teh2 (blue), and Teh3
(green) form a conserved synteny block nested in the last intron of CG18675 orthologues (orange), except in the silk moth (Bombyx mori, Bmori)
and the four beetle (Tribolium castaneum, Tcast) where they have escaped from intronic nesting. The synteny block is extended by Teh4
orthologues (purple) in all insects except the mosquitoes (Anopheles gambiae, Agamb; Aedes aegypti, Aaegy; and Culex quinquefasciatus, Cquin)
and the silk moth. The gene cluster is conserved in fruit flies with the inserted VhaM9.7-c gene in Dmela also present in Drosophila mojavensis
(Dmoja) and ten other drosophilids (not shown). Although Teh1 orthologues (cyan) are often not linked to the TipE locus, the neighbouring
location in the human body louse (Pediculus humanus, Phuma) is likely to represent the ancestral arrangement, supported by the genomic
proximity of Teh1 in the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum, Apisu) and parasitoid wasp (Nasonia vitripennis, Nvitr). The honey bee (Apis mellifera,
Amell) and flour beetle Teh1 orthologues have undergone translocation events relative to their Teh4-Teh2-Teh3-TipE clusters, but are retained on
the same linkage groups. The genome of the crustacean water flea, Daphnia pulex (Dpule), encodes orthologues of TipE, Teh1, and Teh2, but
only one Teh3/4-like gene (s8g331). As Teh3 is a single-coding-exon gene in all the insect genomes, it likely arose from the retrotransposition of
a Teh4-like gene before the insect radiation. Putative orthologous relations among TipE gene family members are indicated with dashed lines.
Start and end positions are indicated for scaffolds, supercontigs, linkage groups, or chromosomes with arrows indicating the direction of the
forward strand of the reference assemblies. Complete gene models including untranslated regions and alternative transcripts are displayed for
Dmela while only coding-sequence regions are depicted for the other species.

otherwise strictly-conserved arrangement of the Teh2Teh3-TipE synteny block, with Teh2 and Teh3 encoded
on the opposite strand to TipE, is disrupted in the fruit
flies by a short gene encoding a Vacuolar H + ATPase
subunit (VhaM9.7-c in D. melanogaster) between Teh3
and TipE, and by a relative inversion of Teh2-Teh3 in
the silk moth (Bmori). Teh4 orthologues are located
adjacent to Teh2 and extend the core synteny block in
all the insects except the three mosquitoes and the silk
moth, which appear to have lost the Teh4 gene. In the
genome of the human body louse (Phuma), Teh1 is
adjacent to TipE (~15 kb apart), while in the pea aphid
(Apisu) it is ~63 kb away and separated by two intervening genes; in the parasitoid wasp (Nvitr), it is ~24 kb
away with only a single intervening gene. As the compact body louse genome is remarkably free from transposable elements and appears to have experienced less
shuffling than other insect genomes [25], the gene cluster in the last common ancestor with all five TipE gene
family members is likely to have resembled the genomic
arrangement found in the body louse today.
Structural constraints: intronic nesting of the TipE locus

The evidence-based annotations of the D. melanogaster
TipE locus provide a comprehensive view of the complex gene architectures and reveal that the coding
sequences of this gene cluster - Teh4, Teh2, Teh3,
VhaM9.7-c, and TipE - are all nested within the last
intron of the neighbouring CG18675 gene (Figure 1).
Such nested gene structures in eukaryotes are generally
much more frequently gained than lost, suggesting that
while intronic insertions may be relatively well-tolerated,
deletions are more likely to be constrained due to their
possible negative impact on both the nested and the
host genes [26]. Single-copy orthologues of CG18675
can be identified in almost all sequenced metazoan genomes, as well as in some flagellate protozoa, green
plants, and apicomplexan parasites, but appear to be
absent from fungi and nematode worms. These gene
sequences are relatively well-conserved, with 49% amino
acid identity between CG18675 and the human orthologue (C21orf59, ENSG00000159079), and are matched by
the sequence profile, domain of unknown function
DUF2870 (IPR021298). Although it has been preserved
as a single-copy gene across a broad phyletic range, the
nesting of multiple genes within the last intron of
CG18675 orthologues appears to have only occurred in
insects. A genomic sequence gap obscures the start of
the water flea (Dpule) CG18675 orthologue, nevertheless, the C-terminal coding exons align well with other
CG18675 orthologues (see Additional file 2), and the
last intron contains no nested genes. This suggests that
while it is possible that water flea TipE-like genes
escaped from intronic nesting, it is more likely that the

Page 4 of 11

nesting event occurred in the last common ancestor of
insects, after the divergence from crustaceans.
The genomic span of insect CG18675 orthologues
with nested TipE gene family members ranges from ~20
kb in the fruit fly (Dmela) and the body louse (Phuma)
to ~100 kb in the Aedes mosquito (Aaegy), which, in
addition to the insertion of the VhaM9.7-c gene in the
drosophilid lineage, highlights the dynamic evolution of
this region. Despite these perturbations, the intronic
nesting and local gene arrangements of the TipE locus
have remained largely intact. In addition to the constraint imposed by intronic nesting, a likely contributing
factor is the overlap of the terminal exons of CG18675
and TipE. These exons contain both coding and
untranslated regions, however, their overlapping coding
regions are out of phase and encode two distinct terminal peptides of 37 (CG18675) and 20 (TipE) amino
acids (see Additional file 3, Figure S1). Nesting of the
TipE locus and the overlapping terminal exons are
observed in the CG18675 orthologues from all the
examined insect species except the flour beetle (Tcast)
and the silk moth (Bmori). The flour beetle CG18657
orthologue (TC007236) is on a different linkage group
to the TipE locus and the silk moth gene
(BGIBMGA013920) is on a different scaffold. Both
genes show conserved coding sequences that include the
last coding exon, indicating that their gene models are
complete (see Additional file 2), and their genomic
spans of ~2.5 kb (Bmori) and ~1 kb (Tcast) are greatly
reduced compared to other CG18675 orthologues. Thus,
in these representative species from the Coleoptera and
Lepidoptera lineages, the TipE locus appears to have
been released from the constraint of intronic nesting.
Despite their escape from intronic nesting, Teh2-Teh3
remain adjacent to TipE in the silk moth, and in the
flour beetle the local gene arrangements of Teh4, Teh2,
Teh3, and TipE are strictly maintained, suggesting possible functional constraints that preserve the architecture
of the TipE locus.
Functional constraints: coordinated regulation of TipE
gene family members

Intronic nesting may suggest possible mechanisms for
coordinated regulation of host and nested genes, however, functional relations between host and their nested
genes are usually unclear, and their expression profiles
often exhibit inverse or no significant correlations
[26,27]. Insect glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductase genes exhibit a similar nested genomic architecture to that of the TipE locus; most gene family
members are encoded in a large intron of the flotillin-2
(Flo-2) gene in D. melanogaster, and its orthologues in
other insects [20,28]. This cluster of GMC oxidoreductases may be coordinately regulated for developmental

or physiological roles involved in ecdysteroid metabolism, which may be linked to the function of the host
gene product, Flo-2, in lipid rafts [28]. Multiple nesting
events of homologous genes within a single host intron
could therefore facilitate coordinated regulation of the
nested genes. Examining D. melanogaster gene expression data from different tissue samples (FlyAtlas [29])
and developmental series experiments (modENCODE
[30]) revealed common and distinct spatial and temporal
expression patterns of the TipE locus genes (see Additional file 4). Tissues with the highest transcript levels of
TipE gene family members include the brain, thoracicoabdominal ganglion, eye, larval central nervous system, and the head, mirroring the expression of Para and
consistent with their roles in excitable cells.
The developmental series data reveal two peaks of
gene expression; the first, from the 14-16-hour embryo
to the first larval stage (L1), is dominated by Teh4. The
start of the second peak is evident from the 12-hour
white prepupae, with maximal transcript levels at the 3day pupae and maintained expression in adult males,
but not in adult females. TipE-Teh1 and Teh2-Teh3 are
the best correlated pairs of expression profiles, TipE is
also well-correlated with Teh2 and Teh4, but to a lesser
extent with Teh3 (Spearman correlation test, Table 1).
Thus, coordinated regulation appears not only amongst
the intron-nested TipE gene family members, but also
with the unlinked Teh1 gene. However, these coordinated expression profiles exhibit poor correlations with
that of the host gene, CG18657, which displays a small
peak during mid-embryogenesis and then increases
again from the 12-hour L3 larval stage with greatlyTable 1 Spearman correlation coefficient for gene

Spearman correlation tests performed on D. melanogaster gene expression
data from developmental series experiments (see Additional file 4) using R
(http://www.r-project.org/) show that the expression profiles of TipE gene

elevated expression in adult males and almost undetectable levels in adult females, consistent with the high
transcript levels observed in testis samples. In contrast,
the TipE gene family members’ expression profiles are
much better-matched to that of Para, particularly TipE
and Teh1 - these two members also induced the largest
increases of expression levels of Para NaV channels in
Xenopus oocytes [14]. Thus, D. melanogaster TipE gene
family members exhibit coordinated spatial and temporal regulation that also correlates well with the
expression of Para, their functional NaV channel partner, but which appears distinct from the host gene,
CG18657.
Evolutionary history of the insect TipE gene family

Phylogenetic analysis of TipE gene family members from
D. pulex and a representative subset of the 21 insect
species highlights the five groups of orthologues (see
Figure 2 and Additional file 3, Figure S2). The TipETeh1-Teh2 proteins form a distinct clade from Teh3Teh4, suggesting possible functional divergence between
members of these two clades. This is supported by the
presence of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like
domains in the extracellular loop regions of Teh3 and
Teh4 proteins that are not found in other TipE gene
family members, which may interact with extracellular
matrix components [14]. Conserved sequence motif analysis using MEME [31] supports the orthology assignments, highlights the extended extracellular loop regions
of the Teh3 and Teh4 orthologues, and shows that the
sequence regions common to all TipE gene family members are comprised of the two transmembrane domains
and parts of the extracellular loop (see Additional file 3,
Figure S3). These regions exhibit high rates of amino
acid substitutions, and this variation may explain the
lack of confident bootstrap support for several nodes on
the TipE gene family phylogeny (see Figure 2 and Additional file 3, Figure S2). The D. pulex genome encodes
only one Teh3/4-like gene and Teh3 is found as a single-coding-exon gene in all the examined insect genomes; the alignment of the D. melanogaster genes
identifies seven sites with uninterrupted coding
sequence in Teh3 but with introns in Teh4, further suggesting that Teh3 arose from the retrotransposition of a
Teh4-like gene of the last common ancestor before the
insect radiation. In the silk moth and the three mosquitoes, the absence of Teh4 orthologues implies that the
Teh3 retrogene, which integrated into the same local
genomic environment, could have assumed the functions of the original multi-exon ancestor. The D. pulex
TipE orthologue is resolved on the TipE gene family
phylogeny (Figure 2), and although Teh1 and Teh2
orthologues are not confidently resolved, they can be
identified by comparing their motif architectures (see

Figure 2 Phylogenetic tree of TipE gene family members in 11 insect species and Daphnia pulex. The phylogeny of TipE gene family
members highlights the five groups of orthologues from the crustacean water flea, Daphnia pulex (Dpule) and 11 representative insect species:
two fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster (Dmela) and Drosophila mojavensis (Dmoja); three mosquitoes, Anopheles gambiae (Agamb), Aedes aegypti
(Aaegy), Culex quinquefasciatus (Cquin); the silk moth, Bombyx mori (Bmori); the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Tcast), the honey bee, Apis
mellifera (Amell); the parasitoid wasp, Nasonia vitripennis (Nvitr); the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Apisu); and the human body louse, Pediculus
humanus (Phuma). The clade of Teh3-Teh4 proteins is distinct from TipE-Teh1-Teh2, linked by dashed lines based on the phylogenetic tree of
TipE gene family members in D. pulex and six selected insect species (coloured), rooted using the distantly related vertebrate big-conductance
calcium-activated potassium channel beta-4 auxiliary subunits (KCNMB4) (see Additional file 3, Figure S2). The phylogeny resolves the D. pulex
TipE orthologue, and although Teh1 and Teh2 orthologues are not confidently resolved, they can be identified by comparing their conserved
motif architectures with the insect Teh1 and Teh2 orthologues (see Additional file 3, Figure S3). A single Teh3/4-like gene is found in the D. pulex
genome, which probably reflects the ancestral pancrustacean genome, where a retrotransposition event before the insect radiation generated
the Teh3 retrogene. This gene duplication may have created a functional redundancy which allowed for the loss of Teh4 orthologues in
mosquitoes and the silk moth. The maximum likelihood phylogeny was built from the confidently-aligned regions of the multiple sequence
alignment of member proteins (see Methods). Bootstrap support values from 100 samples are given and nodes with less than 60% support are
collapsed.

Additional file 3, Figure S3) with the insect Teh1 and
Teh2 orthologues. Thus, it is likely that the ancestral
pancrustacean genome encoded four TipE gene family
members, the subsequent retrotransposition of Teh4
after the divergence of the crustacean and insect
lineages gave rise to Teh3 and created a possible functional redundancy which led to the loss of Teh4 in the
silk moth and the mosquitoes.
Performing BLAST and PSI-BLAST homology
searches of non-redundant sequence databases using
TipE gene family members failed to identify any significant matches beyond Pancrustacea. Orthologues of Para
are present in all the examined insects and the water
flea, as well as in the closest outgroup species, the arachnid deer tick, Ixodes scapularis (see Additional file 1,
Table S1 and Additional file 3, Figure S4), however, no
TipE homologues were identified in either the deer
tick’s assembled scaffolds or sequence trace archives.
Similarly, TipE-like auxiliary beta-subunits are not
found in the genome of the nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, which also lacks any known NaV channel homologues, despite the likely presence of an
ancestral sodium channel before the divergence of vertebrates and invertebrates [32]. Scans with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles built from multiple protein
sequence alignments of TipE gene family members (see
Methods) also produced no significant matches to tick
or worm proteins. However, the improved search sensitivity of the HMM profiles revealed distant homology
with beta-4 auxiliary subunits of vertebrate big-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK Ca ) channels
(KCNMB4, a member of the Slo-beta or BK-beta subunit family): the HMM profile built from the 32 TipE
gene family members shown in Additional file 3, Figure
S2 identifies human, mouse, cow, and frog KCNMB4
proteins with e-values of less than 1e-05. A reciprocal
homology search of arthropod proteomes with a vertebrate KCNMB4 HMM profile identifies insect Teh1
orthologues with e-values of less than 1e-03. A notable
difference occurs in the extracellular loop region of
TipE, Teh3, and Teh4 proteins, which are longer than
the loops in Slo-beta proteins and exhibit EGF-like
domains in Teh3 and Teh4 [2,14]. Although the possibility of convergent evolution of these two families of auxiliary subunits cannot be excluded, the similar protein
architecture of TipE-like and Slo-beta proteins, with two
hydrophobic regions that anchor an extracellular loop
containing putative disulphide bridges, further supports
their common origin.
Their likely common ancestry with Slo-beta subunits
suggests that some TipE gene family members may also
play a role in the regulation of BKCa channels. This type
of ion channel is found across metazoan species, and is
named Slowpoke in D. melanogaster. Although Slowpoke

Page 7 of 11

exhibits generally higher expression levels than Para,
particularly in the eye, head, and spermatheca, their
developmental expression profiles are well-correlated
and match those of the TipE gene family members (see
Table 1 and Additional file 4). However, rather than
suggesting a role for some TipE gene family members in
the regulation of Slowpoke, their similar developmental
expression profiles may arise simply because both channels function in excitable cells. Indeed, TipE gene family
members showed no effects on Slowpoke potassium currents in D. melanogaster cell lines [14], which are
instead regulated by an auxiliary subunit with a protein
kinase-like domain, Slowpoke binding protein [33]. The
likely common ancestor of the TipE-like and Slo-beta
auxiliary subunits may therefore have functioned
together with the pore-forming alpha-subunits of an
ancestral metazoan potassium or sodium channel, subsequently undergoing independent fine-tuning to control
calcium-activated potassium currents in vertebrates and
voltage-gated sodium currents in the invertebrate
lineage.

Conclusion
The TipE gene family of Para Na V channel auxiliary
subunits forms a remarkably conserved genomic cluster
of orthologues with local gene arrangements maintained
across many diverse insect species. This conservation
suggests strong constraints that preserve the organisation of the TipE gene cluster, as observed for the wellstudied Hox gene clusters that nevertheless appear to
tolerate limited gene rearrangements in Drosophila [34].
Comparing the TipE synteny block architecture across
21 insect species and examining expression patterns of
D. melanogaster genes provides evidence of both structural and functional constraints that preserve the TipE
cluster. The ancestral insect TipE gene cluster is likely
to have resembled the genomic arrangement found in
the human body louse today; the TipE, Teh2, Teh3, and
Teh4 genes nested within the last intron of the
CG18657 ancestor, and directly neighbouring Teh1.
Although no TipE-like genes were identified in arachnid
or nematode genomes, homologues encoded in the D.
pulex genome suggest an ancient pancrustacean repertoire of four TipE gene family members. Retrotransposition of Teh4 gave rise to the insect Teh3 retrogene
following the divergence of crustaceans and insects,
which may have generated functional redundancy that
allowed for the loss of Teh4 in the silk moth and the
mosquitoes. Local gene arrangements of the TipE locus
are well-maintained despite the apparent escape from
intronic nesting in the silk moth and the flour beetle
genomes, suggesting additional constraints that preserve
the genomic architecture. D. melanogaster gene expression data reveal coordinated spatial and temporal

regulation of the TipE gene family members that is distinct from the host gene, but which correlates well with
the expression of their regulatory target, Para. Such
functional constraints are likely to contribute to the preservation of the TipE synteny block across Insecta, to
maintain coordinated expression of gene family members with or without the genomic constraint of intronic
nesting. Examining the insect TipE gene family reveals
several key evolutionary events that characterize the
evolution of genes within their genomic contexts: intronic nesting, escape from nesting, overlapping exons, retrotransposition, translocation, gene loss, coordinated
regulation, and conserved synteny. Exploration of the
evolutionary histories of genes maintained in such synteny blocks therefore offers the opportunity to identify
putative structural and functional constraints on gene
rearrangements and their relative contributions to genome evolution.
The common ancestry of the TipE-like and Slo-beta
auxiliary subunits suggests a remarkable plasticity in the
evolution of mechanisms for regulating ion channel
activities. An ancestral ion channel auxiliary subunit
appears to have evolved to regulate calcium-activated
potassium currents in vertebrates and voltage-gated
sodium currents in the invertebrate lineage. Thus,
although the pore-forming alpha-subunits are generally
well-conserved across metazoan species, their regulatory
partners appear to exhibit more lineage-specific functions. Consequently, targeting the activity of such auxiliary subunits may prove a successful strategy for the
development of insecticides that are not toxic to vertebrates, and a more detailed understanding of their molecular functions in different insect species may facilitate
targeted interventions that minimise ecological knockon effects. As well as regulating functional expression
and gating kinetics of ion channels, auxiliary subunits
are known to influence interactions with naturallyoccurring toxins, such as scorpion venom peptides
which inhibit big-conductance calcium channels [35].
Following Nature’s lead could therefore offer novel prospects for the development of insect control strategies
that target ion channel activities.

Methods
Genomic resources

Official gene sets and assembled genome sequences for
23 arthropod species were retrieved from publically
available resources including AphidBase [36], BeetleBase
[37], FlyBase [38], Hymenoptera Genome Database [39],
SilkDB [40], VectorBase [41], and wFleaBase [42]; see
Additional file 1, Table S2 for full details. The examined
arthropod species include: Diptera - Drosophila melanogaster (Dmela) [43] and 11 other fruit flies [44]: Drosophila sechellia (Dsech), Drosophila simulans (Dsimu),

Page 8 of 11

Drosophila erecta (Derec), Drosophila yakuba (Dyaku),
Drosophila ananassae (Danan), Drosophila persimilis
(Dpers), Drosophila pseudoobscura (Dpseu), Drosophila
willistoni (Dwill), Drosophila mojavensis (Dmoja), Drosophila virilis (Dviri), Drosophila grimshawi (Dgrim), as
well as three mosquitoes: Anopheles gambiae (Agamb)
[45], Aedes aegypti (Aaegy) [46], Culex quinquefasciatus
(Cquin) [47]; Lepidoptera - the silk moth, Bombyx mori
(Bmori) [48]; Coleoptera - the flour beetle, Tribolium
castaneum (Tcast) [49]; Hymenoptera - the honey bee,
Apis mellifera (Amell) [50] and the parasitoid wasp,
Nasonia vitripennis (Nvitr) [51]; Hemiptera - the pea
aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Apisu) [52]; Phthiraptera the human body louse, Pediculus humanus (Phuma)
[25]; Crustacea - the water flea, Daphnia pulex (Dpule)
[53]; and Arachnida - the deer tick, Ixodes scapularis
(Iscap).
Synteny block identification

The conserved genomic cluster of TipE gene family
members was detected by employing synteny block
identification procedures developed from a strategy
based on orthologous gene anchors [20,54]. Initial pairwise species comparisons used single-copy orthologous
genes from the OrthoDB [55,56], requiring at least two
pairs of neighbouring orthologues and allowing one
intervening orthologue at most. Subsequently, synteny
block extension across multiple species was performed
by successive projections of pairwise blocks across the
species phylogeny.
Gene model curation

Protein sequence comparisons of TipE gene family
members and orthologues of CG18675 revealed several
annotation errors including missing exons and split
gene models. Gene model curation employed additional available information such as expressed
sequenced tags (ESTs) and homology-based gene predictions using Fgenesh+ [57] and Wise2 [58] to confirm and correct the annotated gene models. HMM
profiles of TipE gene family members and CG18675
orthologues used for gene predictions were built using
HMMER [59]. The HMMs were also used to scan the
proteomes of additional non-arthropod species including Caenorhabditis elegans, Nematostella vectensis,
Hydra magnipapillata, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus,
Branchiostoma floridae, Danio rerio, Xenopus tropicalis, Gallus gallus, Bos taurus, Mus musculus and Homo
sapiens. Megablast and tBLASTn homology searches
against the unassembled sequence trace archives, as
well as the assembled genomes, were performed
respectively to check for the presence of any additional
genes potentially missed by the assembly or annotation
procedures.

Phylogenetic analyses

Multiple protein sequence alignments of TipE gene
family members and CG18675 orthologues were built
using MUSCLE [60], and confidently aligned regions
were extracted with Gblocks [61]. Maximum likelihood
phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using PhyML
[62], with the Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) substitution
model, four relative substitution rate categories, estimated proportions of invariable sites and gamma distribution parameters, and 100 bootstrap samples. To
support the phylogenetic analyses, conserved motif analysis of the protein sequences of TipE gene family members was performed using MEME [31], with the motif
width from 6 to 50 amino acids and a maximum of 10
motifs.
