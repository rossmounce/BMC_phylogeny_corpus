Abstract
Background: Saxitoxin and its analogues collectively known as the paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs)
are neurotoxic alkaloids and are the cause of the syndrome named paralytic shellfish poisoning.
PSTs are produced by a unique biosynthetic pathway, which involves reactions that are rare in
microbial metabolic pathways. Nevertheless, distantly related organisms such as dinoflagellates and
cyanobacteria appear to produce these toxins using the same pathway. Hypothesised explanations
for such an unusual phylogenetic distribution of this shared uncommon metabolic pathway, include
a polyphyletic origin, an involvement of symbiotic bacteria, and horizontal gene transfer.
Results: We describe the identification, annotation and bioinformatic characterisation of the
putative paralytic shellfish toxin biosynthesis clusters in an Australian isolate of Anabaena circinalis
Aphanizomenon sp
Nostocales
gene clusters span approximately 28 kb and contain genes coding for the biosynthesis and export
of the toxin. A putative insertion/excision site in the Australian Anabaena circinalis AWQC131C was
identified, and the organization and evolution of the gene clusters are discussed. A biosynthetic
pathway leading to the formation of saxitoxin and its analogues in these organisms is proposed.
Conclusion: The PST biosynthesis gene cluster presents a mosaic structure, whereby genes have
apparently transposed in segments of varying size, resulting in different gene arrangements in all
three sxt clusters sequenced so far. The gene cluster organizational structure and sequence
similarity seems to reflect the phylogeny of the producer organisms, indicating that the gene
clusters have an ancient origin, or that their lateral transfer was also an ancient event. The
knowledge we gain from the characterisation of the PST biosynthesis gene clusters, including the
identity and sequence of the genes involved in the biosynthesis, may also afford the identification
of these gene clusters in dinoflagellates, the cause of human mortalities and significant financial loss
to the tourism and shellfish industries.

Background
Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a syndrome acquired
through the consumption of contaminated shellfish or
drinking water. Its symptoms include numbness and
ascending paralysis followed by respiratory arrest [1]. Toxicity is mediated by a group of toxins collectively referred
to as paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) or saxitoxins (STX).
The global occurrence of PSTs coupled with their chemical
stability and high toxicity, presents a formidable problem
for marine and freshwater regulating bodies, while detrimentally affecting the health of humans and animal
worldwide [2,3]. STX and its analogues are potent neurotoxic alkaloids. PSTs have been shown to specifically
block voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels [4,5],
and prolong the gating of potassium channels in heart
cells [6]. This mechanism prevents the conduction of a
neural action potentials, paralysing the victim, and has
also been shown to exhibit a cardio-depressory effect [1].
Additionally, the globally observed abundance of PST
producing microorganisms, specifically dinoflagellates,
cause substantial economic damage to the fishing industry, mainly due to closure of fisheries affected by PST producing blooms, as well as the regulatory requirement for
expensive toxin monitoring programs [7].
The parent compound of PSTs, STX, is a tricyclic perhydropurine alkaloid, which can be substituted at various positions, leading to more than 30 naturally occurring STX
analogues [8-13] (Figure 1). The synthesis of PSTs has
been reported in freshwater and marine organisms alike,
spaning two kingdoms of life. The marine microorganisms, dinoflagellates, belonging to the genera Alexandrium, Pyrodinium and Gymnodinium have been reported
to produce PSTs [14-16]. In freshwater systems several filamentous species of cyanobacteria, such as Anabaena,
Aphanizomenon, Cylindrospermopsis and Lyngbya are also
known to produce PSTs [17-20].
The occurrence of a neurotoxin, originally termed aphatoxin, from Aphanizomenon flos-aquae was first demonstrated by Sawyer et al. [21], where a copper sulfate
treatment of a cyanobacterial bloom led to the death of six
tonnes of fish in Kezar Lake, New Hampshire. PST production was later confirmed in the cultured strain Aphanizomenon flos-aquae NH-5, isolated from a small pond near
Durham, New Hampshire. This study identified the presence of saxitoxin (STX) and neosaxitoxin (neoSTX),
together with further unidentified toxic fractions [17]. Li
et al. [22] re-evaluated the morphological based taxonomy of the toxic Aphanizomenon flos-aquae NH-5 strain.
They compared the 16S rRNA gene sequences and morphology of this strain with six other strains of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and reclassified it as Aphanizomenon sp. NH5. According to morphological and gene sequence data,
four of the investigated strains of Aphanizomenon flos-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/10/8

aquae, that have not been shown to produce toxins, are
grouped together in the phylogenetic tree and were delineated from the branch represented by the two known
toxin-producing Aphanizomenon isolates. Furthermore, Li
et al. [23] reclassified the paralytic shellfish toxin-producing Aphanizomenon flos-aquae LMECYA 31 as Aphanizomenon issatschenkoi based on morphological and 16S rRNA
gene sequence characteristics. The Aphanizomenon strains
in this study formed a monophyletic cluster with three
other species designations; the fascicle-forming Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Aphanizomenon gracile strains having
solitary trichomes, and Aphanizomenon issatschenkoi
strains characterized by solitary trichomes that have
tapered ends. More recently, a different Aph. flos-aquae
strain from Portugal has been isolated and shown to produce the PSTs, STX, neosaxitoxin (neoSTX), gonyautoxin
5 (GTX5), gonyautoxin 6 (GTX6) and decarbamoyl saxitoxin (dcSTX) [3].
Similarly, Anabaena circinalis is a common toxic bloomforming planktonic freshwater cyanobacterium with a
global distribution and an unusual geographical segregation of toxin production [24]. Australian reports of neurotoxic cyanobacterial blooms have principally implicated
A. circinalis as the toxin producing species. In 1991 a neurotoxic bloom of A. circinalis covering over 1000 km of the
Darling River in Australia, reportedly with concentrations
of up to 500,000 cells per millilitre, was the cause of cattle
mortality [25,26]. A following comprehensive study of the
Murray-Darling basin in 1994 implicated A. circinalis in
all neurotoxic blooms in Australia, and also showed A.
circinalis to produce PSTs, mainly STX, GTX2/3 and
dcGTX2/3 [18,27]. A detailed chemical analysis of the cultured strain A. circinalis AWQC131C revealed the presence
of STX, GTX2/3, C1/2, dcSTX and dcGTX2/3 [28].
We have recently proposed a putative STX biosynthesis
gene cluster in Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii T3 [29]. The
putative STX biosynthesis gene cluster (sxt) in C. raciborskii
T3 spans approximately 36 kb, and encodes genes
involved in the biosynthesis, regulation and export of
PSTs (Figure 2). Some of the genes identified in the C. raciborskii T3 gene cluster have not have been assigned a function due to their low level of structural homology to
proteins in available databases. These genes may therefore
represent novel enzyme families. Since C. raciborskii T3 is
not genetically transformable, mutagenesis of the sxt cluster was not possible. The choice of identifying and characterizing the two novel putative PST biosynthesis gene
clusters in Anabaena and Aphanizomenon was principally
motivated by the detrimental effect the producer organisms have on water quality and public health. Furthermore, comparative analysis of the differences identified in
toxin production, that is, the lack of neoSTX and all other
N1-hydroxylated PSTs in A. circinalis AWQC131C, may
provide further insights into the PST biosynthetic machinPage 2 of 13

circinalis AWQC131C and Aph. sp. NH-5, a reverse genetic
approach was employed. The primer pair nodF and nodR
(Table 1) was used in a degenerate PCR, targeting conserved regions in carbamoyltransferases (sxtI), which are
putatively involved in the transfer of a carbamoyl group
from carbamoyl phosphate onto the free hydroxymethyl
side chain of the saxitoxin precursor [29,30]. A single
amplicon of about 900 bp in size was amplified using
genomic DNA isolated from both A. circinalis
AWQC131C and Aph. sp. NH-5. The degenerate PCR
products were then cloned and clone libraries were constructed, in an attempt to identify all the carbamoyltrasferases in these PST producing organisms. Screening of
these clone libraries revealed only one gene fragment in
each of the libraries. BLAST similarity searches showed
homology between these gene fragments and other carbamoyltransferases. The sxtI gene homologs identified in
A. circinalis AWQC131C and Aph. sp. NH-5 were 90% and
91% identical in sequence to the sxtI gene from C. raciborskii T3, respectively, and were 97% identical among themselves (Table 2) [29]. These gene fragments were
consequently good candidates for sxtI homologs, and
therefore also PST biosynthesis genes in these cyanobacteria.

provides insights into the evolutionary history of the
putative PST biosynthesis gene clusters, revealing whether
they are of a common ancestor or laterally derived via horizontal gene transfer.

Results and discussion
Identification of PST gene clusters in A. circinalis
AWQC131C and Aph. sp. NH-5
The gene cluster putatively responsible for the biosynthesis of PSTs in the cyanobacterium C. raciborskii T3 has
recently been characterized by our group [29]. In an
attempt to identify the putative PST biosynthesis gene
cluster analogs, from the PST producing organisms A.

In order to obtain the DNA sequences of the entire putative PST biosynthesis gene clusters in both A. circinalis
AWQC131C and Aph. sp. NH-5, a gene walking technique
(known as pan-handle PCR) was employed [31]. Following numerous rounds of sequencing-out and gene-walking reactions from the putative sxtI homologues, the
entire gene cluster in both organisms was identified,
sequenced and characterized (Figure 2). The putative PST
gene cluster in both organisms is of comparable size. The
A. circinalis AWQC131C sxt gene cluster spans 29 kb,
flanked by a β-lactamase, a gene involved in antibiotic
resistance, at the 5' end and a smf gene homolog, believed
to be involved in DNA uptake at the 3' end (Figure 2). The
Aph. sp. NH-5 sxt gene cluster is slightly smaller and covers
27.5 kb. It is flanked on both sides by genes coding for
photosynthesis machinery, at the 5' end by psbH, a photosystem II reaction centre gene and at the 3' end by a prenyltransferase involved in the synthesis of ubiquinone
(Figure 2).
Characterisation of the PST biosynthesis gene clusters
The major PSTs identified in Aph. sp. NH-5 are neoSTX
and STX [17] and other toxic fractions that were not identified, although the methods used were not highly sensitive. While the major PSTs identified in A. circinalis
AWQC131C were STX, GTX2/3, C1/2, dcSTX and
dcGTX2/3 [28]. This observed difference in the toxin profiles is most probably the result of the different genetic
backgrounds in these producer organisms, as modifica-

tion reactions to the STX parent molecule, carried out by
the sxt gene cluster tailoring enzymes, putatively result in
the formation of the various PSTs.
Both gene clusters characterized in this study contain the
same set of genes identified in the putative PST biosynthesis gene cluster (sxt) of C. raciborskii T3 with some exceptions (Table 2) [29]. Specifically, they do not contain the
genes sxtY, sxtZ and ompR, believed to be involved in signal transduction and the transcriptional regulation of PST
production in C. raciborskii T3, and therefore might be regulated in a different manner, however it can not be completely excluded that these genes have diverged and
transposed to a different locus in the genome. Furthermore, they do not contain the gene sxtF putatively
involved in PST transport. Both the A. circinalis

AWQC131C and the Aph. sp. NH-5 PST gene clusters contain a gene, denoted sxtPER. Curiously, sxtPER, a gene
most similar to members of the drug and metabolite
transport family, has not been identified in the C. raciborskii T3 PST gene cluster.sxtPER might therefore fulfil a similar role to sxtF in C. raciborskii T3 and is postulated to be
involved in the transport of PSTs in Anabaena and AphaniTable 1: PCR primer sequences used in this study

zomenon. Interestingly, sxtPER has an evolutionary history
apparently distinct from sxtM and sxtF and represents a
different lineage, while sxtF seems to have arisen by a gene
duplication event of sxtM. The phylogeny, function and
distribution of cyanobacterial MATE genes are addressed
in a separate publication (Pengelly JJL, Mihali TK, Neilan
BA: Identification, phylogeny and expression of novel
members of the multi-drug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family from cyanobacteria, submitted).

Furthermore, the Aph. sp. NH-5 sxt gene cluster is missing
a sxtO homolog, an adenylylsulfate kinase. sxtO is present
in the A. circinalis AWQC131C sxt gene cluster and the C.
raciborskii T3 sxt gene cluster. sxtO is most similar to adenylylsulfate kinases that are involved in the formation of
5'-phosphoadenosine 3'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), which is
the sulfate donor for PAPS dependant sulfotransferases
(Table 2) [29]. The toxin profile of Aph. sp. NH-5 has not
been fully characterized, however, it has been shown to

produce STX and neoSTX and possibly other unidentified
toxic fractions [17]. It is therefore not possible to asses
whether this strain actually produces sulfated PSTs. As
adenylylsulfate kinases are not unique to the PST gene
clusters, and are ubiquitous enzymes needed for all PAPS
dependant sulfotransferases, it seems plausible that this
genetic mutation could be complemented by an additional adenylylsulfate kinase elsewhere in the genome of
Aph. sp. NH-5. Curiously, the sxtO homolog identified in
A. circinalis AWQC131C sxt gene cluster has very low similarity to sxtO identified in C. raciborskii T3 (Table 2), and
is more similar to other cyanobacterial derived adenylylsulfate kinases. This observation further supports the idea
that PST biosynthesis accessory genes may be complimented by gene homologs in the genome of the producer
organism.
On the other hand, the A. circinalis AWQC131C putative
PST biosynthesis gene cluster does not contain the tailoring gene sxtX, which is most similar to a cephalosporine
hydroxylase, and presumably responsible for the hydroxylation of N-1 in STX, thereby converting STX to neoSTX
(Figure 3). Hence, sxtX is putatively involved in the formation of all the analogs containing a hydroxyl at N-1 (Figure 1). In accordance with this finding, A. circinalis
AWQC131C does not produce any STX congeners that
contain a hydroxyl at N-1. In contrast the Aph. sp. NH-5
sxt gene cluster does contain the tailoring enzyme gene
sxtX, and correspondingly been shown to produce the N1 hydroxylated analog neoSTX [17], further affirming its
putative role in the PST biosynthesis gene cluster.
The A. circinalis AWQC131C sxt gene cluster does not contain the gene sxtW, which is present in the Aph. sp. NH-5
and the C. raciborskii T3 sxt gene clusters. sxtW is most similar to a ferredoxin and is believed to be involved in electron transport, required for the hydroxylation of C-12 by
the two ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases, encoded by sxtT
and sxtH. Curiously, the A. circinalis AWQC131C sxt gene
cluster contains a small (98 bp), disrupted ORF denoted
orf8, with similarity to sxtW and other ferredoxin genes
(Table 2). Orf8 might therefore represent yet another fragment of a PST biosynthesis accessory gene that has been
inactivated. It is plausible that an endogenous ferredoxin
complements for its loss in A. circinalis AWQC131C, since
homologs of ferredoxin (Accession no. Npun_R5178,
Ava_5008) have been detected in several recently released
cyanobacterial genomes, as evident from BLAST homology searches.
sxtV, a gene most similar to succinate dehydrogenases,
originally identified in the C. raciborskii T3 PST gene cluster, is also believed to be involved in this electron transport mechanism. Only a fragmented part of this gene is
present in the A. circinalis AWQC131C sxt gene cluster,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/10/8

while sxtV in the Aph. sp. NH-5 sxt gene cluster contains a
stop codon interrupting the ORF. It is therefore postulated
that this gene is also complemented by another locus in
the genome of these producer organisms or is not essential for PST biosynthesis.
Interestingly, the A. circinalis AWQC131C sxt gene cluster
also contains partial transposase-like sequences, which
interrupt a putative ORF and split it into 3 different fragmented partial ORFs, denoted orf3, orf5 and orf7 (Figure
2). This fragmented gene is partially similar to sxtN,
homologs of which are present in the A. circinalis
AWQC131C and Aph. sp. NH-5 sxt gene clusters, and
putatively involved in the sulfation of STX and its derivative [29]. Due to its fragmentation and short coding
sequence we were unable to assign a putative role for this
gene, but it is assumed to be inactive.
Structural organization
The organization of genes in the, A. circinalis AWQC131C
and Aph. sp. NH-5 sxt gene clusters, is very conserved, and
has less common features with the organization of the C.
raciborskii T3 sxt cluster (Figure 2). As depicted in Figure 2,
the putative PST biosynthesis gene cluster can be divided
into five segments of coding DNA, denoted as A-E. The A.
circinalis AWQC131C sxt gene cluster contains three truncated ORFs (orf 3, 5 and 7) intersected by transposases,
however, these are absent from the Aph. sp. NH-5 sxt gene
cluster. In the Aph. sp. NH-5 sxt gene cluster, segment C
contains the genes sxtX, sxtV and sxtW, whereas in the A.
circinalis AWQC131C sxt gene cluster most of segment C
is missing, only a fragmented section of sxtV is retained.
Furthermore, in the A. circinalis AWQC131C putative PST
biosynthesis gene cluster, segment E is adjacent to segment A, whereas in Aph. sp. NH-5 segment E is connected
to segment D (Figure 2). Therefore, it seems plausible to
assume that the A. circinalis AWQC131C sxt gene cluster
has had at least two DNA recombination events as compared to the Aph. sp. NH-5 sxt gene cluster, with one event
causing the truncation of segment C, thereby losing the
genes sxtX, sxtV and sxtW. The other recombination event
would have involved segment E, which contains the gene
denoted sxtPER, to relocate from its 5' position in Aph. sp.
NH-5 to the central region of the gene cluster in A. circinalis AWQC131C (Figure 2).
Biosynthesis of PST congeners
A detailed description of the proposed biosynthesis of the
STX parent molecule has recently been published by our
group [29]. Briefly, biosynthesis is initiated with SxtA,
which contains 4 catalytic domains (Table 2, Figure 3 step
1–2). A methyltransferase domain (sxtA1), a GNAT
domain (sxtA2) (loading of acyl carrier protein), an acyl
carrier protein (ACP) domain (sxtA3) and an AONS
domain (sxtA4) (which acts as a condensation domain).

followed by the SxtA1-catalysed methylation of acetylACP, converting it to propionyl-ACP. The class II aminotransferase domain (AONS), SxtA4, then performs a
Claisen-condensation between propionyl-ACP and
arginine. The product of SxtA is thus 4-amino-3-oxo-guanidinoheptane. The next step (Figure 3 step 3) is carried
out by SxtG, an amidinotransferase that transfers an amidino group from arginine onto the product of SxtA, producing 4,7-diguanidino-3-oxoheptane. This compound is
then condensed via SxtB, which is most similar to a cytidine deaminase, in a retro-aldol-like condensation (Figure 3 step 4) and the first heterocycle is formed. The
following step (Figure 3 step 5) involves SxtD a desaturase, which introduces a double bond between C-1 and C5 resulting in the 1,2-H shift between C-5 and C-6. SxtS a
2-oxoglutarate-dependent (2OG) dioxygenase, then performs the consecutive epoxidation of the new double
bond, and opening of the epoxide to an aldehyde with
concomitant bicyclisation (Figure 3 steps 6–7). The dehydrogenase SxtU then reduces the terminal aldehyde group
of the STX precursor (Figure 3 step 8). Thereafter (Figure 3
step 9), SxtH and SxtT, each coding a terminal oxygenase
subunit of bacterial phenyl-propionate and related ringhydroxylating dioxygenases, catalyse the consecutive
hydroxylation of C-12, forming dcSTX. Thereafter, SxtI in
conjunction with SxtJ and SxtK catalyse a carbamoyltrasfer
from carbamoylphosphate onto the free hydroxyl at C-13,
forming saxitoxin (STX).
Subsequently, tailoring reactions catalyse the formation
of the PST analogues, which are derivatives of the parent
molecule STX. One of the most potent STX derivatives is
the N-1 hydroxylated saxitoxin analogue neoSTX. As previously mentioned, SxtX has been predicted to be
involved in the N-1 hydroxylation of saxitoxin [29].
Therefore we postulate that SxtX, which is not encoded in
the A. circinalis AWQC131C PST biosynthesis gene cluster,
carries out the conversion of STX to neoSTX (Figure 3). A.
circinalis AWQC131C is known to produce N-21 and O22 sulfated STX analogues (GTX2/3, C1/2, dcGTX2/3).
The activity of two PAPS dependent sulfotransferases,
which were specific for the N-21 of STX and GTX-3/2, and
O-22 of 11-hydroxy STX, respectively, have been
described from the PSP toxin-producing dinoflagellate
Gymnodinium catenatum, although no protein sequence
information was obtained due to instability of the
enzyme and low yield [32,33]. Both putative PST biosynthesis gene clusters identified in this study contain a gene
denoted sxtN, which is most similar to estrogen sulfotransferase and putatively responsible for the sulfation
of STX. Therefore, the protein encoded by sxtN, is postulated to be responsible for the sulfation of STX at O-22
resulting in the formation of GTX2 and GTX3 (Figure 3).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/10/8

Alternatively SxtN could sulfate N-21 of STX resulting in
the formation of C1 and C2. It is further possible that the
enzyme catalyses both reactions, or that a sulfotransferase
not encoded in the PST biosynthesis gene cluster is
involved. Whether the product of this gene sulfates O-22
or N-21 of STX could not be determined at this point, and
will require heterologous expression of the enzyme to
determine its natural substrate specificities. dcSTX derivatives are postulated to result from the hydrolytic cleavage
of carbamoylated STXs. The candidate enzyme encoded
by sxtL, harbouring homology to GDSL-lipases, has been
proposed to catalyse this cleavage [29]. SxtL would therefore catalyse the formation of dcGTX2/3 from GTX2/3,
and putatively convert STX to dcSTX (Figure 3). The exact
sequence of reactions is not clear at this point, as there is
need for heterologous expression of each of these tailoring
enzymes and their substrate specificities have to be confirmed experimentally.
Phylogeny of the PST biosynthesis genes
It is interesting to note that the organization of the putative PST gene clusters in A. circinalis AWQC131C and Aph.
sp. NH-5 are more similar to each other, than to the
organization in the recently identified putative PST gene
cluster in C. raciborskii T3 (Figure 2). Furthermore, the A.
circinalis AWQC131C and Aph. sp. NH-5 sxt genes show
overall greater sequence similarity to each other than to
the recently identified sxt genes in C. raciborskii T3 (Table
2). In an attempt to reconstruct the taxonomic phylogeny
of the PST producing cyanobacteria A. circinalis
AWQC131C, Aph. sp. NH-5, C. raciborskii T3 and L. wollei,
a phylogenetic approach was used. 16S rRNA gene
sequences for the PST-producing and non-producing
cyanobacteria were retrieved from GenBank (Table 3). An
alignment of these sequences was created and a phylogenetic tree based on a 685 bp segment of the 16S rRNA
gene was reconstructed. As evident from the phylogenetic
tree (Figure 4), A. circinalis AWQC131C and Aph. sp. NH5 form a supported clade together with the (non-toxic) A.
circinalis AWQC310F (64% bs) and are more closely
related to each other than to C. raciborskii T3. Consequently, the topological organization of the PST biosynthesis gene cluster is reflected by the phylogeny of the
producer organism, and they therefore most likely have a
paralleled evolution.

Australian isolates of A. circinalis have been shown to be
phylogenetically related, forming two distinct branches
[24]. Furthermore, genetic screening has shown that only
toxic isolates contain the putative genes for PST biosynthesis [29]. An attempt was made to identify the insertion/
excision point of the putative PST gene cluster in the Australian A. circinalis isolates. PCR primers AnastartF and
Ana30kbR were designed based on the sequences
obtained from A. circinalis AWQC131C (Table 1), as strain

representative of the PST-producing lineage. These primers were designed within the ORF of the β-lactamase at the
5' end, and smf at the 3' end of the PST gene cluster in A.
circinalis AWQC131C (Figure 5). A PCR reaction with this
primer set was performed using genomic DNA isolated
from the non-toxic A. circinalis 310F strain belonging to
the non-PST producing clade, and the PST-producing A.
circinalis AWQC131C. The PCR resulted in the amplification of a 1.6 kb segment of DNA from A. circinalis 310F,
whereas genomic DNA from A. circinalis AWQC131C did
not yield a product. The predicted distance between the
primer set in A. circinalis AWQC131C genomic DNA was
over 29 Kb and therefore an amplicon was not expected
using the conditions described. Sequencing followed by
bioinformatic analysis of the 1.6 kb amplicon from A.
circinalis 310F revealed two ORFs, one at the 5' end that
was similar to a β-lactamase, and another at the 3' end
similar to a smf gene, both homologous to the genes identified on either ends of the putative PST biosynthesis gene
cluster in A. circinalis AWQC131C. A closer analysis of the
A. circinalis 310F amplified region revealed the presence of
four direct repeats of the sequence TTCCCTG within the
intragenic spacer identified between the two flanking
ORFs (Figure 5). Insertion sites which are targeted by a
transposon are usually innocuous and do not contain
repeats, however, the presence of direct repeats is indicative of an excision event that has followed the insertion of
a transposon [34]. Further examination of the non-coding
regions flanking the PST biosynthesis gene cluster in A.
circinalis AWQC131C revealed a relic inverted repeat of
the sequence GGCTATCAATTCAGAT on either side of the
PST biosynthesis gene cluster that could also indicate a
past transposition event. The combination of these findings supports the theory that the non-toxic A. circinalis
strains have lost the putative PST biosynthesis gene cluster
during an excision event. Together with the observation
that the organization of the putative PST biosynthesis
gene clusters resembles the phylogeny of the producer
organisms, as well as the fact that A. circinalis AWQC131C
and Aph. sp. NH-5 PST genes are overall more similar to
each other than to the C. raciborskii T3 PST genes (Table
2), might imply that the sxt gene cluster is of ancient origin. Therefore, the sporadic distribution of PST biosynthesis throughout phylogeny could be explained by the loss
of function in non-toxic strains, rather than the acquisition of one or more genes during more recent horizontal
transfer in PST producing toxic strains. A similar evolutionary history has recently been proposed for the sporadic distribution of another cyanobacterial toxin
biosynthesis gene cluster encoding microcystin synthetase
[35].

putative PST biosynthesis gene cluster presents a mosaic
structure, whereby genes have apparently transposed in
segments of varying size, resulting in different gene
arrangements in all three sxt clusters sequenced so far. This
gene cluster arrangement is in agreement with a mobile
genetic element, further supported by the identification of
multiple transposase like sequences in other recently characterized cyanobacterial toxin and secondary metabolite
gene clusters [31,36,37]. The putative point of insertion/
excision of the sxt gene cluster in Australian isolates of A.
circinalis was also identified. The gene cluster organizational structure and gene sequence identity seem to reflect
the phylogeny of the producer organisms, indicating that
the gene clusters might have an ancient origin, or that
their lateral transfer was also an ancient event. The further
sequencing and characterisation of cyanobacterial PST
biosynthesis gene clusters in different producer organisms, with different toxin profiles, may provide new
insights into the biosynthetic machinery and the enzymes
involved at each step. The availability of more putative
PST biosynthesis gene sequences from different producer
organisms will also enable the better monitoring of algal
blooms by water authorities, including the use of PCRbased early warning systems. Future studies into the transcriptional control and physiological roles of the PSTs,
furthering our ability to predict and prevent the formation
of harmful algal blooms, is also possible given these gene
sequences and associated regulatory regions. The knowledge we gain from the characterisation of the PST biosynthesis gene clusters, including the identity and sequence
of the genes involved in the biosynthesis, may also afford
the identification of these gene cluster in dinoflagellates,
the cause of human mortalities and significant financial
loss to the tourism and shellfish industries.

DNA extraction
Total genomic DNA was extracted from cyanobacterial
cells using the Mo Bio PowerPlant DNA isolation kit
(Carlsbad, CA) in accordance with the manufacturers
instructions. Genomic DNA was stored at -20°C.
PCR
Insertion/excision point PCR was carried out using the
primer set AnastartF and Ana30kbR (Table 1), and performed in 20 μl reaction volumes containing 1 × Taq
polymerase buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 10 pmol each of the forward and
reverse primers, 50 ng genomic DNA and 0.2 U of Taq
polymerase (Fisher Biotech, Australia). Thermal cycling
was performed in a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 Thermal
cycler (Perkin Elmer Corporation, Norwalk, CT). Cycling
began with a denaturing step at 94°C for 4 min followed
by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 10 s, primer
annealing at 55°C for 25 s and a DNA strand extension at
72°C for 2 min. Amplification was completed by a final
extension step at 72°C for 7 min.
Degenerate PCR
Degenerate PCR primers targeting the carbamoyltransferase sxtI used in this study, nodF and nodR (Table 1),

were designed ex-silico from sequence alignments using
ClustalX [39]. Degenerate PCR was performed in 20 μl
reaction volumes containing 1 × Taq polymerase buffer,
2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphates,
25 pmol each of the forward and reverse primers, 50 ng of
genomic DNA and 0.2 U of Taq polymerase (Fisher Biotech, Australia). Thermal cycling was performed in a
GeneAmp PCR System 2400 Thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer
Corporation, Norwalk, CT). Cycling began with a denaturing step at 94°C for 4 min followed by 35 cycles of
denaturation at 94°C for 10 s, primer annealing at 50°C
for 30 s and a DNA strand extension at 72°C for 45 s.
Amplification was completed by a final extension step at
72°C for 5 min.
Gene walking
The sequence of unknown regions that were flanking candidate genes was determined by an adaptor-mediated
(Pan-handle) PCR method [40] that was modified as previously described [31]. Short adaptor DNA was ligated to
digested genomic DNA, and a specific genomic outwardfacing primer in combination with an adaptor primer was
then used to amplify the unknown regions of the genome.
Twenty picomoles of T7 adaptor were added to each reaction mixture, containing 1 μg of genomic DNA, 10 U of
blunt-ended restriction enzyme, and 5 U of T4 ligase
(Promega) in 1 × One Phor All buffer (Amersham/Pharmacia). The one-step digestion and ligation reaction mix-

ture was incubated at room temperature overnight. The
single-stranded end of the adaptor was blocked in a solution containing 1 × PCR buffer (Fischer Biotech), 4 mM
MgCl2, and 12.5 μM ddNTP with 1 U of Taq DNA
polymerase (Fischer Biotech). Thermal cycling was performed in a PCR Sprint temperature cycling system
machine (Hybaid Ltd) with an initial step at 70°C for 15
min followed by 10 cycles of DNA denaturation at 95°C
for 10 s, DNA reannealing at 40°C for 1 min, and extension of the strand with ddNTP at 70°C for 1 min. Following the PCR cycles, the reaction mixture was incubated
with 1 U of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer
Mannheim, Göttingen, Germany) at 37°C for 20 min,
and the enzyme was heat inactivated at 85°C for 5 min.
The flanking region PCR mixture contained 1 to 2 μl of
adaptor-ligated DNA, 10 pmol of adaptor primer, 10
pmol of a genome-specific oligonucleotide primer and
0.5 U of a mixture of 10:1 Taq polymerase/PFU (Fischer
Biotech, Australia). PCR cycling was performed as
described above, with DNA strand extension at 72°C for
3 min. In addition, the primer annealing temperature was
decreased for the first 10 cycles, by 1°C at each cycle, from
65 to 55°C, followed by primer annealing at 55°C for a
further 25 cycles.
