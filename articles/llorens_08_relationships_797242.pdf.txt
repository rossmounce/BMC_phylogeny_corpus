Abstract
Background: The origin of vertebrate retroviruses (Retroviridae) is yet to be thoroughly
investigated, but due to their similarity and identical gag-pol (and env) genome structure, it is
accepted that they evolve from Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements the retrotransposons and
retroviruses of plants, fungi and animals. These 2 groups of LTR retroelements code for 3 proteins
rarely studied due to the high variability – gag polyprotein, protease and GPY/F module. In relation
to 3 previously proposed Retroviridae classes I, II and II, investigation of the above proteins
conclusively uncovers important insights regarding the ancient history of Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae
LTR retroelements.
Results: We performed a comprehensive study of 120 non-redundant Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae
LTR retroelements. Phylogenetic reconstruction inferred based on the concatenated analysis of the
gag and pol polyproteins shows a robust phylogenetic signal regarding the clustering of OTUs.
Evaluation of gag and pol polyproteins separately yields discordant information. While pol signal
supports the traditional perspective (2 monophyletic groups), gag polyprotein describes an
alternative scenario where each Retroviridae class can be distantly related with one or more Ty3/
Gypsy lineages. We investigated more in depth this evidence through comparative analyses
performed based on the gag polyprotein, the protease and the GPY/F module. Our results indicate
that contrary to the traditional monophyletic view of the origin of vertebrate retroviruses, the
Retroviridae class I is a molecular fossil, preserving features that were probably predominant among
Ty3/Gypsy ancestors predating the split of plants, fungi and animals. In contrast, classes II and III
maintain other phenotypes that emerged more recently during Ty3/Gypsy evolution.
Conclusion: The 3 Retroviridae classes I, II and III exhibit phenotypic differences that delineate a
network never before reported between Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements. This new
scenario reveals how the diversity of vertebrate retroviruses is polyphyletically recurrent into the
Ty3/Gypsy evolution, i.e. older than previously thought. The simplest hypothesis to explain this
finding is that classes I, II and III trace back to at least 3 Ty3/Gypsy ancestors that emerged at
different evolutionary times prior to protostomes-deuterostomes divergence. We have called this
"the three kings hypothesis" concerning the origin of vertebrate retroviruses.

Background

Results

Attention was first drawn to the Retroviridae when HTLV-1
was characterized as pathogenic in humans [1,2]. They
further increased in significance with the discovery of
HIV-1, the retrovirus responsible for AIDS in humans
[3,4]. These 2 retroviruses represent only a small part of
Retroviridae diversity, which can be divided in seven genera; Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, Delta-, Epsilon-, Spumaretroviridae and Lentiviridae (according to ICTV classification [5]).
Based on their strategy of transmission, the Retroviridae
can also be classified as endogenous retroviruses when
they enter the germ lines of hosts and are vertically transmitted; or as exogenous retroviruses, when they can be
transmitted horizontally from one host into another via
infection. Most recent trends in Retroviridae taxonomy [610] group endogenous and exogenousretroviruses into 3
major classes designated as I, II and III. Both classifications are complementary as class I comprises gamma- and
epsilonretroviruses; class II includes lentiviruses, delta-,
alpha- and betaretroviruses; and class III groups spumaretroviruses with ERV-L retroelements. The ancient history of the Retroviridae is yet to be thoroughly investigated,
but due to their similarity and identical gag-pol (and env)
genome structure, it is usually assumed that they evolve
from the Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements of plants, fungi and
animals [11]. The traditional view suggested by pol polyprotein domains such as the RT [12-14], RNAse H [14,15],
and INT [14,16] used to resolve the phylogeny, delineates
a common Ty3/Gypsy origin for all vertebrate retroviruses.
Nevertheless little is known about this scenario because
RT, RNAse H and INT analyses appear unable of agreeing
on a precise well-supported Ty3/Gypsy root for the Retroviridae. In an attempt to bring light on this topic, we investigated 120 non-redundant Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae taxa
based on the phylogenetic analysis of both gag and pol
polyproteins. Our results revealed conflicting phylogenetic signals between these 2 polyproteins. From that
point, we aimed to investigate more in depth this evidence through comparative analyses performed based on
3 independent proteins rarely considered by prior studies
due to their variability – the gag polyprotein, the PR and
the GPY/F module. Our study reveals taxonomic differences among the 3 Retroviridae classes, and an evolutionary network that distantly relates each class with one or
more Ty3/Gypsy lineages. This observation appears to be at
odds with the traditional monophyletic view suggested by
prior approaches to determining the origin of vertebrate
retroviruses, but requires further study. In light of this new
perspective, we introduce here a new hypothesis for
debate and further evaluation. Our hypothesis argues that
classes I, II and III probably trace back to at least 3 independent Ty3/Gypsy ancestors. We call this the three kings
hypothesis.

Consistency of lineages but conflicting phylogenetic signals
between gag and pol polyproteins in the Ty3/Gypsy and
Retroviridae evolutionary history
In a prior study [17], we used the inferred phylogenetic
reconstruction of Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements based on both gag and polpolyproteins as the criterion to create phylogenetically informative HMM profiles
[18]. Figure 1A shows a radial version of this tree, which
clearly supports the usually accepted monophyly of the
Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae groups and all their assumed
lineages (clades, genera and classes) [5-14,19-25]. This
view of the origin of Retroviridae indicates that these retroviruses had a common origin, e.g. a Ty3/Gypsy LTR retrotransposon (for more information in this topic, see [11]
and references therein). Interestingly, inferred gag-pol tree
suggests a putative Retroviridae root in the Ty3/Gypsy evolutionary history, which according to this new analysis, is
close to Micropia/Mdg3 clade [14] and other Ty3/Gypsy lineages described in bilateria genomes. This perspective suggests that the first Retroviridae ancestor emerged before or
during the split between protostomes and deuterostomes
together with several Ty3/Gypsy lineages, which apparently
have distant counterparts (Athila and Tat clades [19,20])
in the genomes of plants. Taking into account that the Retroviridae are true viruses capable of escaping their hosts,
this scenario might also be traced back to an ancient horizontal transference from protostomes to vertebrates and
the colonization of the vertebrate genomes by these viral
agents from that point on. However these two alternatives, whilst equally exciting perspectives, should be reevaluated based on the separate analysis of gag and pol
polyproteins. The phylogenetic analysis of the pol polyprotein (Figure 1B) is consistent with gag-pol tree, due to
the grouping of the taxa into clusters. In fact, the bootstrap
robustness of the different clades and genera reported by
gag-pol tree comes from the strong pol phylogenetic signal. This means that the pol signal is the essential analytical substrate responsible for the current view on the
evolutionary history and taxonomy of Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements. However, the pol signal does
not support the Retroviridae root suggested by the gag-pol
tree, and does not reveal a well-supported alternative link
between the Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae groups. Pol tree is
consistent with gag-pol tree in to delineate a scenario of
emergence for vertebrate retroviruses preceding the protostomes-deuterostomes split. However, the root suggested
by pol tree falls close to errantiviruses the canonical Ty3/
Gypsy retroviruses of flies [26-28]. Indirectly, this indicates
that whatever the relationship between Micropia/Mgd3
clade and the Retroviridae, the relationship depends on the
gag polyprotein. Consistent with this, the independent
phylogenetic analysis of the gag polyprotein (Figure 1C)
groups the Retroviridae class II with Micropia/Mdg3 clade
and other Ty3/Gypsy lineages described in bilateria

Phylogenetic analyses.
Phylogenetic analyses. A)Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae phylogeny inferred based on the concatenated analysis of both gag and
pol polyproteins. This tree is robust as gag and pol signals complement and correct each other. It also supports with significant
bootstrap values the 2 groups of LTR retroelements and all their accepted lineages (clades, genera and classes). An extended
version of this tree facilitating names, lineages, hosts, and Genbank accessions of all retroelement taxa used is provided as the
Additional file 1 accompanying this paper (see the Section "Sequences and databases" in Methods). Decomposition of gag-pol
tree and analysis of its two components separately, reveals similar phylogenetic signal but conflicting evolutionary perspectives.
B) The phylogenetic signal of the pol polyprotein is robust and therefore responsible for the current known taxonomy and
classification of Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements into lineages. C) The gag signal supports the clades, genera and
classes described in each group, but does not supports the 2 groups. Gag tree outlines an alternative scenario that may relate
each Retroviridae class with one or more Ty3/Gypsy lineages.

genomes. The gag phylogeny also reveals how the Ty3/
Gypsy origin of vertebrate retroviruses is anything but
straightforward. This tree also clusters gammaretroviruses
(class I) with the Athila/Tat clades of plants, and suggests
proximity between the Retroviridae class III and errantiviruses, and other Ty3/Gypsy lineages. In other words, the
gag signal fails to support the monophyly of the two Ty3/
Gypsy or Retroviridae groups and suggests an alternative
scenario. That is, based on gag and depending on the
class, it follows that the Retroviridae code for different
gags, each having one or more distant counterparts
among Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements.
Retroviridae differentiation into classes outlines
phenotypic differences in the gag polyprotein that
distantly relate each class with one or more Ty3/Gypsy
lineages
Phylogenetic analyses performed based on gag are rarely
reported, due to the fast rate of evolution of this polyprotein. However, the alignment from which we inferred the
gag tree was manually constructed and its accuracy tested
by comparative analyses. We contrasted all gag sequences
with each other using the NCBI BLAST search [29] available at GyDB. Comparisons revealed that gag sequences
belonging to a Ty3/Gypsy or Retroviridae clade, genus or
class are usually more similar to their lineage counterparts
than to other gag sequences (data not shown). This analysis also revealed a core of similarity that is common to all
Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae gags. This core spans the CANC region and its most conserved traits appear to be the
MHR at CA [30], and the zinc finger Cys-X2-Cys-X4-HisX4-Cys (CCHC) array at NC [31]. Evaluation of this core
shows that the Retroviridae code for 3 different types of
gag, each exhibiting a particular amino acidic architecture
phenotype that depends on the class differentiation.
While the 2 Retroviridae classes I and II appear to be
related according to BLAST analyses (data not shown),
they present greater divergence based on several phenotypic features preserved depending on the class (Figure 2A
and 2B). Class III is extremely dissimilar to classes I and II
based on gag, but preserves several features at the C-terminus that might be distantly related or equivalent to those
of class I (Figure 2A and 2C). The most prominent, but
obviously not unique, difference between the 3 classes is
the variability in the number of CCHC arrays at NC. Class
I NCs usually show one CCHC array, class II NCs exhibit
two, and class III gags have no CCHC arrays at their C-terminus. BLAST analyses also revealed how the Ty3/Gypsy
lineages related to classes I and II by gag tree, display
greater similarity to different Retroviridae taxa belonging
to these 2 classes than to other Ty3/Gypsy lineages. As an
example, Tables 1 and 2 summarize the top similarity hits
obtained from 4 comparisons conducted using 2
Micropia/Mdg3 and 2 Tatgag sequences as queries. All
BLAST analyses were supported by additional sequence

Phenotypic capsid-nucleocapsid differences of the gag polyprotein based on the three classes.
Phenotypic capsid-nucleocapsid differences of the gag polyprotein based on the three classes. Retroviridae differentiation into 3 previously proposed classes suggests how vertebrate retroviruses code for 3 different gag polyproteins, based
on the CA-NC region. A) Sequence logo describing the CA-NC region coded by all gamma- and epsilonretroviruses (class I)
used in this study. Class I gag exhibits several features (underlined in the Figure) the presence of a single CCHC array at NC
being the most prominent. B) Sequence logo describing the class II CA-NC region was built on an alignment including lentiviral
(HIV-1, HIV-2, SIVMAC, VMV, SA-OMVV and CAEV), betaretroviral (MPMV, SERV and SRV-1), alpharetroviral (LPDV and
RSV), and deltaretroviral (HTLV-1, HTLV-2 and BLV) sequences. Class II gag amino acidic architecture is similar but displays
important differences from that of class I. Note, for instance, how the C-terminus of class II gag is based on a trait we call
"NAN-C-C-KA-P" followed by 2 CCHC arrays at NC. C) Sequence logo constructed based on all class III gags used. Class III
gag has a CA trait extremely dissimilar from those of classes I and II. On the other hand, class III NC equivalent trait is rich on
residues having similar physiochemical properties to those displayed in class I, but have no CCHC arrays.

ported by BLAST analyses. However, Figure 4B shows a
multiple alignment between spumaretroviruses and
errantiviruses, which according to the qualitative domain
similarity merits further attention.
Comparative analyses confirm phenotypic features in the
gag polyprotein that distantly relate each Retroviridae class
with one or more of the Ty3/Gypsy lineages evaluated. The
similarity spans the CA-NC core and the most prominent
feature in common is the variability in the number of
CCHC arrays per NC. With very few exceptions, the Athila/
Tat elements of plants usually code for NCs exhibiting one
CCHC array, Micropia/Mdg3 and Mag elements code for
NCs usually exhibiting 2 arrays (except Mag elements of
C.elegans), and errantiviral gags have not CCHC arrays at
their C-terminus. This indicates that the number of CCHC
arrays per NC is evolutionarily preserved depending on
the Ty3/Gypsy lineage and the Retroviridae class, and that
this phenotype is an excellent indicator of taxonomy and
evolution. For simplicity's sake, we do not discuss all Ty3/
Gypsy cases. We discuss but one example, the most interesting instance of using this indicator – the chromodomain-containing Ty3/Gypsy LTR retrotransposons [14]
called chromoviruses [13]. Chromoviruses are the most
ancient branch of Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements as they
have been described in the genomes of plants, fungi and
vertebrates (for a more extensive information about chromoviruses, see [23,32,33]). It noteworthy that all Ty3/
Gypsy LTR retroelements of plants can be divided in 2
major branches – chromoviruses and Athila/Tat – and that
chromoviruses appear to be the only branch of Ty3/Gypsy
LTR retroelements capable of colonizing the genomes of
fungi. A prior study [30] reported that this branch of Ty3/
Gypsy LTR retroelements displays similarity (we confirm)
to gammaretroviruses based on CA-NC. However, we
have also found how that chromoviruses show similarities to class II in addition to a number of Ty3/Gypsy lineages (for this reason chromoviruses fall at an intermediate
position in the gag phylogeny). With rare exceptions, NCs
coded by chromoviruses usually bear one CCHC array
(data not shown). In contrast, the different Ty3/Gypsy lin-

eages described in bilateria organisms show greater variability in the number of CCHC arrays at NC thantheir Ty3/
Gypsy counterparts of plants and fungi (i.e. chromoviruses
and the Athila/Tat branch). Gag evidence thus relates class
I to the most likely CA-NC phenotype of Ty3/Gypsy ancestors predating the split between plants and the ophistokonts (fungi and animals) and classes II and III with
other CA-NC phenotypes, more frequently observed
among the Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements of protostomes
and deuterostomes.
Retroviridae differentiation into classes reveals three
protease isoforms based on flap motif polymorphisms,
which are common to Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR
retroelements
Through phylogenetic analyses, we have shown that the
pol signal is primarily responsible for the branching of
Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements in 2 monophyletic groups. That is the usual evolutionary perspective
based on the RT and other pol polyprotein domains. We
have also shown that gag signal discloses an alternative
scenario wherein each Retroviridae class can be related to
one or more Ty3/Gypsy lineages. An in-depth examination
of gag diversity through comparative analyses has
revealed the phenotypic variations involved in this differential similarity. Gag evidence is thus well supported. An
interesting question is whether this evidence should be
considered a convergence due to the fast rate of evolution
of the gag polyprotein, or if it is due to an ancient divergence. Certainly, the most robust components of the pol
polyprotein – the RT, RNAse H and INT – usually support
the traditional perspective originally delineated by RT
analyses [12]. However, the strong signal from these 3
proteins disguises the particular perspective provided by
another pol protein domain – the PR. Non-redundant
studies focusing on Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae PRs are
rarely reported as this enzyme presents identical analytical
difficulty to gag due to its fast rate of evolution. Despite
this it is well known that LTR retroelement PRs in general
are aspartic peptidases belonging to clan AA (following
MEROPS Database classification [34]). Within clan AA,

Gag comparison between class I and Athila/Tat LTR retroelements of plants. The Retroviridae differentiation into the
3 classes reveals how based on the CA-NC region, class I gammaretroviruses and Athila/Tat LTR retroelements of plants are
more similar than previously supposed. Among others features in common (underlined and named following the nomenclature
of Figure 2), both Athila/Tat and class I gags are characterized by the presence of a single CCHC array at NC. Note, however,
how Tat NCs exhibit a CHHC motif substituting the canonical CCHC array.
Retroviridae PRs are divided into 2 protein families, retropepsins (family A2) and spumaretropepsins (family A9).
Family A2 groups all PRs coded by classes I and II and
family A9 collects the PRs coded by spumaretroviruses
(class III). Such a classification keeps going because retropepsins and spumaretropepsins are strongly dissimilar
each other and do not group on a single branch in any

analysis (data not shown). On the other hand, Ty3/Gypsy
PRs are extremely variable and little is known about them.
MEROPS Database at least classifies many Ty3/Gypsy
examples within family A2 because these PRs display great
similarity to retropepsins. However, not all Ty3/Gypsy PR
are similar to retropepsins as not all Retroviridae PRs are
retropepsins. Because no study evaluates the relationships

between Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae PRs, we investigated
this topic, taking into consideration the differentiation of
the 2 groups of LTR retroelements into lineages. It is worth
remembering that while gag and pol signals are in disagreement over the taxonomical groups, they do support
the differentiation into clades, genera and classes of Ty3/
Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements.
Prior research performed using structure-based alignments and structural comparisons based on HIV-1 PR and
other retropepsins, have revealed how LTR retroelement

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/276

PRs dimerize in their active form (for a more extensive
review in this topic, see [35] and references therein). Each
lobe of the PR dimer carries a structural feature called the
flap, which is a β-hairpin loop that covers the active site
and has 2 flexible alternating forms, closed and semiopen (see Figure 5). We have extensively studied not only
Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae PRs but also other clan AA
PRs (data not shown). Interestingly, the Retroviridae differentiation into classes reveals 3 PR isoforms each preserving a particular flap motif. Class II PRs usually harbor a
sequence GIGG amino acid motif (Figure 5A), which at

the tertiary structure level constitute the flap in HIV-1 PR
and other class II PRs (see [35] and references therein). In
contrast class I PRs were found to preserve a GATG variant
of this motif (Figure 5B), and within class III spumaretroviral PRs preserve a TIHG variant of the same sequence
motif (Figure 5C). Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements also code
for a variety of isoforms, which evolutionarily preserve a
particular flap motif state depending on the lineage, in the
same manner as classes I, II and III. A number of these
states are very similar but not identical to that preserved

the motif, respectively. The GANG variant is widespread
among the PRs coded by Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements of
plants, fungi and animals. This variant also predominates
in the PRs coded by caulimoviruses of plants and Ty1/

ing the split between plants and the ophistokonts. Consistent with gag evidence, GIGG and TIHG PR variants
exhibited by classes II and III PRs are rarely observed
among Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements of plants and fungi.
In plants, only Tat clade elements code for PRs presenting
a poorly preserved flap motif, which might be discretely
related to the GIGG variant (data not shown). As Athila
clade elements (the sibling of Tat clade in plants) code for
GANG PRs, we may assume that the PR flap motif transits
from one state to another. Among the Ty3/Gypsy lineages
of fungi, only TF1-2 clade code for GIGG PRs, which is a
variant more frequently observed among Ty3/Gypsy LTR
retroelements of protostomes. In contrast, the GIGG variant carried by the PRs coded by Micropia/Mdg3 clade and
other Ty3/Gypsy lineages is almost identical to that of Retroviridae class II (Figure 6B). The TIHG variant is absent
from the Ty3/Gypsy PRs of plants. In fungi, only a putative chromoviral lineage called Ty3 clade (see [17] and references therein) code for PRs harboring a highly diverged
motif that in its consensus form can be distantly related to
the TIHG variant (data not shown). In contrast, a number
of Ty3/Gypsy errantiviruses code for PRs carrying a TIHG
motif identical to that of class III spumaretroviruses (Figure 6C). Finally, investigating other sequences not considered in this study, we also found that Gmr-1 clade [36,37]
a Ty3/Gypsy lineage recently described in deuterostomes
also code for TIHG PRs (data not shown). The PR scenario
thus reveals consistency with gag in suggesting that Retroviridae class I is most likely related to the phenotype of
Ty3/Gypsy ancestors predating the spilt between plants
and the ophistokonts. In contrast, classes II and IIIshould
be more properly related to Ty3/Gypsy lineages whose
ancestors probably emerged before or during the transition of bilateria organisms into protostomes and deuterostomes.
Retroviridae class I is a molecular fossil preserving GPY/F
module phenotypes that probably were predominant
among Ty3/Gypsy ancestors predating the split between
plants fungi and animals
As already shown, gag polyprotein and the PR depict a
new scenario as an alternative to the traditional monophyletic insight (2 groups of LTR retroelements) suggested
by prior RT, RNAse H and INT analyses. Onto understand
the two opposing scenarios, we performed phylogenetic
analyses based on the RT, RNAse H and INT and found
consistency with the traditional perspective of 2 separate
LTR retroelement groups using the RT and RNAse H ([1315]). Analysis of the INT revealed different perspectives
depending on the NJ or parsimony method used in the
analysis (see Methods). While the NJ method supports the
2 LTR retroelement groups, the parsimony method splits
the Retroviridae into 2 branches not supported by bootstrap (data not shown). This is because our model of INT
alignment covers the 3 subdomains described in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/276

amino acidic architecture of a conventional INT domain.
The traditional core used for inferring INT phylogenies is
common to all INTs in general, and includes 2 of these
sub-domains; the conserved zinc finger "HHCC" binding
motif [38] at the N-terminus, and the central sub-domain
containing the conserved D-D-E trait [39,40]. The C-terminal sub-domain of all INTs is usually dismissed from
analysis because it is less preserved than the other 2 subdomains. In Ty3/Gypsy and RetroviridaeINTs, it is definite that this sub-domain is a small trait called GPY/F
module, which was probably recruited modularly during
evolution [14]. The module name refers to the strongly
preserved GPY/F amino acid motif [14], which will be
referred to as the canonical motif throughout the rest of
this paper. Indeed, the GPY/F module appears to be
responsible of the signal discrepancy in phylogenetic
analyses (INT parsimony tree performed without this
module is in agreement with the NJ analysis, data not
shown). From that point, we investigated the GPY/F module in relation to the 3 Retroviridae classes. The module,
seen from this viewpoint, shows a number of protein isoforms based on GPY/F motif polymorphisms. With rare
exceptions, the modules of class I INTs usually preserve
the canonical motif, while the modules of classes II and III
exhibit other variants (Figure 7A). Here, classes II and III
do not make an intrinsic phenotypic distinction, each
genus exhibiting a particular variant of the motif within
these 2 classes. The modules coded by Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements delineate similar perspective. As shown in Figure 7B, while the canonical motif is practically
predominant in the modules of Ty3/Gypsy elements of
plants and fungi, the modules of bilateria Ty3/Gypsy LTR
retroelements are rich in motif polymorphisms (canonical motif included). This indicates that Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements described in bilateria organisms exhibit
greater GPY/F motif variability than their Ty3/Gypsy counterparts of plants and fungi, and strongly suggests a
number of transitions from the canonical motif toward
other states during evolution. This scenario is not completely consistent with gag and PR perspectives; for
instance, while Micropia/Mdg3 modules preserve the
canonical motif, the different Retroviridae genera belonging to class II exhibit different motif polymorphisms. Nevertheless, the GPY/F module relates the Retroviridae class I
with Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements of plants and fungi
through the common preservation of the canonical motif,
while classes II and III can be related with bilateria Ty3/
Gypsy LTR retroelements by an increase of the motif variability. In fact, the whole module of class I INTs appears to
be more similar to those preserved by the INTs of chromoviruses (Figure 8A) and Athila and Tat clades (Figure 8B)
than to those of classes II and III. Alignment between
classes I and II reveals a dramatic loss of sequence information by class II during evolution (Figure 8C). The module carried by spumaretroviral INTs is similar to that of

GPY/F motif transitions. The amino acid motif that gives its name to the GPY/F module at INT of Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae
LTR retroelements is polymorphic. While the modules of Retroviridae class I and Ty3/Gypsy elements of plants and fungi, usually
preserve the canonical GPY/F motif, classes II and III, and bilateria Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements display a number of module
isoforms based on that motif.

class I, but they greatly differ in the motif (Figure 8D).
That is, spumaretroviral modules lost the GPY/F motif,
substituting it with a highly diverged KT/SP motif. Again,
this outlines an intriguing parallelism between spumaretroviruses and Ty3/Gypsy errantiviruses because the modules of these 2 LTR retroelement lineages are qualitatively
similar (Figure 8D). Moreover, Ty3/Gypsy errantiviruses
also lost their GPY/F motif during evolution. Therefore,
whatever the INT function involving the GPY/F module
coded by the Retroviridae class I, this class appears to be a
molecular fossil preserving GPY/F module phenotypes
that were predominant among Ty3/Gypsy ancestors, predating the split between plants fungi and animals. In contrast, Retroviridae classes II and III maintain a number of
module isoforms more recently emerged during evolution.

Discussion
Retroviridae differentiation into the 3 classes I, II and III
unravels phenotypic aspects of vertebrate retroviruses,
which are probably related with their ancient Ty3/Gypsy
origins
Phylogenetic analysis inferred based on all concatenated
gag and pol products coded by Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae
LTR retroelements shows the robustness of their phylogenetic signal regarding the clustering of OTUs [5-14,1925]. We used the parsimony method to infer this phylogeny, but the clustering of OTUs is independent of the
method of phylogenetic reconstruction used (see Meth-

ods). The gag-pol analysis also divides Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements into 2 separate branches, as
suggested by original approaches in this topic [12,41]. We
do not disagree this classification for 2 reasons; first, the
strong phylogenetic signal of RT, RNAseH, and INT cannot be dismissed;and second, the Retroviridae (except
gammaretroviruses) can be distinguished from Ty3/Gypsy
LTR retroelements by features such as the presence of
accessory genes. Nevertheless, thecurrent Ty3/Gypsy and
Retroviridae classification only exposes the modern evolutionary history of these 2 groups of retroelements (we
have shown how their ancient history is not straightforward). Due to the wide distribution of Ty3/Gypsy elements
in eukaryotes, the usual means of transference of a canonical Ty3/Gypsy LTR retrotransposon is probably vertical.
However, the viral nature of a true Ty3/Gypsy or Retroviridae exogenous retrovirus resides in its capability of horizontal transference from one host to another via
infection. Moreover, the incidence of mechanisms such as
gene recruitment, genome rearrangement, recombination
and chimerism in LTR retroelement evolution, presents
difficulties in identifying the true natural history of Ty3/
Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements. This suggests
that the most realistic (not yet proposed) model for
describing Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae evolution alternates
gradual and modular evolution, and combines vertical
and horizontal means of transference.

GPY/F module comparisons.
GPY/F module comparisons. Based on the GPY/F module, Retroviridae class I appears to be more similar to Ty3/Gypsy LTR
retroelements of plants and fungi than other Retroviridae classes. A) Multiple alignment of gammaretroviruses (class I) and chromoviruses. B) Between gammaretroviruses and Athila/Tat elements. C) Between gammaretroviruses and Retroviridae class II,
this alignment reveals important differences between the two classes, as well as the evolutionary transition of the canonical
GPY/F motif towards other motif states. D) Based on the GPY/F module, spumaretroviruses (class III) is similar to class I, but
also to Ty3/Gypsy errantiviruses. In fact, both spumaretroviral and errantiviral modules lost the canonical motif during evolution.

The traditional argument supporting the Ty3/Gypsy origins
of vertebrate retroviruses is shown by their similarity in
sequence and genome structure [41]. The question is,
however, what genetic material is more informative for
exploring the relationships between these two (and other)
groupsof LTR retroelements, highl y variable traits such as
gag and PR or strongly preserved substrates such as the RT,
RNAseH and INT? Certainly, RT, RNAseH and INT are an
excellent means of classifying Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae
LTR retroelements into lineages. However, phylogenetic
analyses based on RT, RNAseH and INT are not exact
enough to resolve the ancient evolutionary history of
these 2 groups. This is because the inferred phylogeny

based on these proteins does not necessarily coincide with
the true natural history of the full-length retroelement
genome. Here, the advantage of using the gag-pol alignment to infer the phylogeny is the increase in statistical
power of the analysis, allowing the opportunity to correct
the single gene tree discrepancies. This analytical strategy
is useful but has limitations for which solutions remain
elusive; the inferred tree can accumulate systematic errors
due to the use of concatenated information. We have
shown how gag-pol tree suggests a Ty3/Gypsy root in the
origins of vertebrate retroviruses that is close to the
Micropia/Mdg3 clade. However, evaluation of gag and pol
polyproteins separately yields discordant information.

Here, while pol phylogeny supports the traditional perspective (2 retroelement groups), gag phylogeny describes
a new scenario that appears to be informative with respect
to the ancient patterns of diversity of Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements. Certainly, the phylogenetic signal of the gag polyprotein has several limitations due to its
fast evolution. To overcome these limitations we investigated other protein domains and used different methodologies to evaluate the significance of the new scenario.
The most important feature here is that, for first time in
the scientific literature, we have carried out a non-redundant study of three independent proteins that have rarely
been attempted before because their difficulty.
Our investigation conclusively reveals that the taxonomical differentiation into the 3 Retroviridae classes I, II and III
discloses 3 different gag and PR products, and that each
product has one or more distant Ty3/Gypsy counterparts.
The analysis of the GPY/F module reveals partial consistency and how the similarity of class I to Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements of plant and fungi, is significant. Our results
thus support an ancient scenario of polyphyly involving
the 3 Retroviridae classes and different Ty3/Gypsy lineages.
Here, we stress that the identification of the Retroviridae
classes is not a conclusion but an assumption based on
previous studies [6-10]. Notwithstanding, we cannot
argue for the existence of a direct ancestor between each
class and any particular Ty3/Gypsy lineage. Classes I and II
are sufficiently similar to corroborate their accepted evolutionary relationship, and it can also be assumed that
Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae phylogeny is incomplete
(sequencing projects are continuously disclosing new lineages). Despite this, the similarity of each class by simple
convergence to different Ty3/Gypsy lineages based on 3
independent protein products is an implausible parsimonious explanation. Moreover, while class III spumaretroviruses are dissimilar to classes I and II, our results reveal
that they in turn display an intriguing domain similarity
to errantiviruses that ought to be followed up. Hence we
think that the class differentiation probably unravels certain aspects of vertebrate retroviruses related to their
ancient Ty3/Gypsy origins. Instead of a single root to this
new scenario, we show how an ancient evolutionary network between the 2 groups can exist, with its most interesting aspect being its polyphyly. (The Ty3/Gypsy lineages
related to each class does not constitute a monophyletic
branch in any phylogeny). Therefore, our approach
strongly suggest that class I is a molecular fossil that
emerged quite soon in Ty3/Gypsy evolution, while classes
II and III emerged later, together with the ancestors of Ty3/
Gypsy LTR retroelements described in protostomes.

Introducing the Three Kings Hypothesis: A new principle
for debate and further evaluation about the subject of the
Ty3/Gypsy origins of vertebrate retroviruses
The evolutionary network identified by classes I, II, III is
inconsistent with the idea of a unique Retroviridae ancestor. It follows that various scenarios may either support or
disprove such a network. Assuming this network exists,
the most likely scenario relates Ty3/Gypsy elements of
plants and fungi with the Retroviridae class I. This scenario
assumes the existence of a distant evolutionary relationship between the lineages or an ancient horizontal transfer of chromoviruses from fungi (or plants) to vertebrates.
Indeed, chromoviruses are the most ancient lineage of
Ty3/Gypsy LTR retrotransposons. They are rich in genetic
variability, and are also present in the genome of many
vertebrates [23,32,33]. In both cases, the most likely
explanation for the relationship between class I and
Athila/Tat retroviruses and retrotransposons of plants is
that chromoviruses and class I are related, an argument
suggested by a previous study [30]. Nevertheless, chromoviruses of vertebrate organisms are usually more similar to
their chromoviral counterparts of fungi than to those of
plants. Therefore the chromoviral scenario does not
explain why class I and Athila/Tat elements of plants are
similar each other based on gag. On the other hand, chromoviruses have not yet been described in protostomes,
echinoderms and urochordates; furthermore it remains
unclear whether chromoviruses were inexorably driven to
extinction in these organisms or were horizontally transmitted from plants/fungi to vertebrates. Consequently,
the chromoviral scenario does not clarify why classes II
and III and the Ty3/Gypsy lineages of protostomes share
sequence similarities and phenotypic features rarely
found among the Ty3/Gypsy lineages of plants and fungi.
With this in mind, a new theoretical principle is posited
here for debate and further research. The simplest hypothesis is that classes I, II and III probably evolved from at
least 3 Ty3/Gypsy ancestors and emerged at different evolutionary times prior to the split between protostomes
and deuterostomes (the three kings hypothesis). Several
points involved in the background of this hypothesis
should be emphasized. First, we include the words "at
least" to acknowledge the three classes but do not dismiss
the possibility of more Ty3/Gypsy ancestors in the evolutionary history of the Retroviridae. Second, "different times
of emergence" suggests, but does not necessarily mean,
independent origins. Class II may in fact be directly
related to class I, but the emergence of class II seems more
recent and in parallel with the emergence of the ancestorsof several Ty3/Gypsy lineages, such as the Micropia/Mdg3
clade (or others). Class III spumaretroviruses delineate
identical perspective with Ty3/Gypsy errantiviruses. Third,
we use the term "polyphyletic" because the Ty3/Gypsy lineages related to each class do not constitute a monophyletic branch in any phylogeny. Moreover, viral

evolution is always a polyphyletic challenge involving
ecological parameters such as host populations, environment, vectors, mechanisms of transmissions, etc.
The polyphyletic recurrence of vertebrate retroviruses into
the evolutionary performance of Ty3/Gypsy LTR
retroelements
We have described how the different gags, PRs and GPY/F
modules evaluated show a variability that is preserved,
depending on the Ty3/Gypsy lineage and Retroviridae class
(or genus). While class I can be related to Ty3/Gypsy elements of plants and fungi, classes II and III preserve phenotypic features typically observed among Ty3/Gypsy
elements of protostomes. That is the evolutionary perspective provided by the protein product of 3 independent coding regions. We have discussed this evidence but
have not yet interpreted why the diversity and phylogeny
of Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements are so different regarding the different gag or pol substrates. In general, the action of viruses and mobile genetic elements is
important in host evolution [16,42-47] because they are
vectors of evolution and potential inducers of diseases
and genetic disorders, such as chromosome rearrangements and inversions [48]. However, if the action of
viruses and mobile genetic elements might somehow
influence the host evolution, it is reasonable that host
evolution could also constrain the evolution of these
genetic agents. We thus speculate with the possibility of
selective influences imposed on Retroviridae genes such as
the rt, rnase h and int (and other regions) to optimize
essential functions, such as retrotranscription and integration (according to the complexity of the new genome
environment provided by vertebrate organisms). This
probably involves gradual evolution but also a number of
molecular mechanisms, such as gene recruitment and
recombination to generate variability and new effective
genetic combinations. Here, it is important to keep in
mind that except gammaretroviruses and other exceptions, the Retroviridae usually incorporate accessory genes,
usually needed to adjust diverse aspects of their replication and infectivity (these features appear to be specific of
retroviruses infecting vertebrate organisms). On the other
hand, a prior study [15] supports a putative chimeric origin of the Retroviridae RNAse H domain and the modular
acquisition of the GPY/F module by Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae INTs [14]. Moreover, D-type betaretroviruses
probably are viral hybrids between a B-type betaretrovirus
and a C-type gammaretrovirus [5,17,49]. Finally, a
number of studies reveal how recombination is a mechanism frequently embraced by HIV evolution to generate
variability. Two studies reveal for instance how recombination of M subtypes, has resulted in the generation of
multiple circulating recombinant forms consisting of
mosaic HIV-1 lineages [50,51].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/276

Regarding coding regions such as gag, pr and gpy/f module,
we think that these traits reveal features and aspects
involving different evolutionary strategies, but which are
intrinsic and taxonomically related with ancient events of
retroelement speciation and divergence. This argument
finds an important evolutionary marker in the variability
in the number of CCHC arrays at NC and the different PR
and GPY/F module isoforms. Indeed, the CCHC array at
NC is involved in virion assembly, RNA packaging, reverse
transcription and integration processes [52]. On the other
hand, the flap lies over the PR active site and conveys specificity to the enzyme by carrying important substratebinding functions (for more information in this topic, see
[35,53,54]). Finally, while the GPY/F module is now
under investigation, the C-terminal end of the INT
appears to be important in the integration of the retroelement into the host genome [55,56]. The variability of
these three regions probably reveals different evolutionary
strategies of speciation and divergence, which can be
assumed older than previously supposed, since it does not
only occur in the Retroviridae group, but also in all Ty3/
Gypsy LTR retroelements of plants, fungi and animals.
Here, the three kings hypothesis and its testing (in one sense
or another) does not affect the evidence we have presented. That is, class I, II and III taxonomically code for 3
gag, PR and GPY/F products that have one or more distant
counterparts among Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements. However, the most interesting aspect of the gag-PR-GPY/F variability is that it appears to be constrained by the biodistribution of Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements. In turn, the
diversity patterns of the Retroviridae based on these
regions appear to be recurrent into the evolutionary performance of Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements, the most interesting aspect of which is that they seem polyphyletic.
Therefore the evolutionary network between Ty3/Gypsy
and Retroviridae LTR retroelements is informative regarding an ancestral history, which is in some respects similar
to those models of evolution indistinctly described by
population genetics and quasi-species theory (for more
details see [57]). This means that further analysis of the
evolutionary network we disclose in this study challenges
the involvement of different parameters such as bio-distribution, host's populations, environment, vectors and
mechanisms of transmissions, etc. With this aim, our
hypothesis makes possible a first evaluation of this new
scenario we present in a forthcoming manuscript (submitted for publication). In this approach, we use the number
of CCHC arrays at NC and the different PR and GPY/F
module isoforms as evolutionary markers to trace the network. This is by superimposing not only Ty3/Gypsy and
Retroviridae LTR retroelements, but also other LTR retroelement groups over their host bio-distribution.

Conclusion
Retroviridae classes I, II and III exhibit phenotypic differences that delineate a network never before reported
between Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements.
This new scenario reveals how the diversity of vertebrate
retroviruses is polyphyletically recurrent into the Ty3/
Gypsy evolution, i.e. older than previously thought. The
simplest hypothesis to explain this finding is that classes
I, II and III trace back to at least 3 Ty3/Gypsy ancestors that
emerged at different evolutionary times prior to protostomes-deuterostomes divergence. We have called this
"the three kings hypothesis" concerning the origin of vertebrate retroviruses.

Methods
Sequences and databases
This work is part of the GyDB Project [17] an ongoing
database launched with the aim of phylogenetically analyzing and classifying mobile genetic elements based on
their diversity and evolutionary profile. In the first iteration, we consider the Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements of eukaryotes. We have investigated 120 nonredundant full-length Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae genomes
collected from NCBI [58]. An extended version of the gagpol tree evaluated summarizing names, taxonomy, hosts,
and Genbank accessions of all retroelement taxa used to
perform this analysis, is available online as the Additional
file 1 accompanying this paper. By clicking the name of
each OTU in this tree, the user can browse the GyDB and
locate a file providing information of the OTU selected,
including a link to the Genbank accession of the
requested element at NCBI. The gag-pol tree can also be
found online in the Section Phylogenies at GyDB [59].
Multiple alignments and comparative analyses
In general, all Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements have 2 polyproteins in common – gag and pol. Gag
is composed of 3 domains -MA, CA and NC -, pol is usually carrier of 4 domains – PR, RT, RNAse H and INT. Note
however that PR can be coded separately or in frame with
gag and other protein domains. We have used and analyzed a gag-pol multiple alignment ~1700 residues in size,
constructed based on the concatenation of the CA, NC,
PR, RT, RNAseH and INT cores. The gag-pol alignment is
freely accessible within the GyDB collection deposited at
Biotechvana Bioinformatics [60]. The alignment is available in 6 formats at the following URL [61]. We have also
analyzed the gag and pol polyproteins by separate dividing the gag-pol alignment into 2 independent alignments
CA-NC and PR-RT-RNAseH-INT, to perform phylogenetic
or comparative analyses.

Alignments were compared using GENEDOC editor [62]
in shaded mode and the following groups of amino acid
similarity: [T,S small nucleophile amino acids] [K,R,H

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/276

basic amino acids], [D,E,N,Q acidic amino acid and relative amides], and [L,I,V,M,A,G,P,F,Y,W hydrophobic
amino acids]. Similarities between gag sequences were
correlated using different gag queries to the CORES database available via the NCBI BLAST search [29] at GyDB,
using BLASTp search mode. BLAST databases available at
GyDB are non-redundant, small and include only Ty3/
Gypsy and Retroviridae or related sequences, allowing flexible comparisons between both distantly and closely
related sequences with homologous known functions.
Comparative analyses based on sequence logos involved
CheckAlign 1.0 [63] in Shannon's algorithm mode [64]
and correction factor. Sequence logomethodology was
originally introduced by Schneider et al. [65,66] to display
consensus sequences for DNA and protein alignments.
Later, Schneider dismissed the term "consensus" [67],
arguing that a logo provides more information than the
consensus sequence of a protein or DNA alignment.
While this can be controversial because there are many
manners to obtain or describe a consensus sequence,
logos methodology being one of them, we are in agreement with the proposition of the original author in the
use of the term "sequence logo" suggested in his website
[68]. We employ the term "sequence logo" to describe the
resultant output reported by this analysis, and then refer
to the protein information underlying the content shape
of the logos constructed, based on our alignments as
"amino acidic architecture". This term may be useful to
describe with a single word – consensus, core and amino
acid patterns. CheckAlign directly builds the logo from an
ungapped alignment using the conventional methodology [65,66]. Here, the maximum uncertainty by position
in a protein alignment is log2 20 = 4.3. In the case of
gapped alignments, CheckAlign automatically builds the
logo, taking the gap as another amino acid species. Here,
the tool considers the maximum uncertainty by position
to be log2 21 = 4.4 for protein alignments (for more details
about CheckAlign see [63]).
The 3D structure of the HIV-1 PR [69] was modeled using
SWISS-PDBViewer 3.7 SP5 [70], and PDB file 1A30 as
input. The PDB file was downloaded from RCSB Protein
Data Bank [71].
Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic reconstructions of Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae
LTR retroelements inferred from gag-pol, pol and gag
alignments employed the PHYLIP 3.6 package [72]. We
first generated 100 bootstrap replicates of each alignment
using SEQBOOT. Second, we used the protein sequence
parsimony method of Felsenstein, based on the
approaches of Eck and Dayhoff [73] and Fitch [74] to perform the analyses. Here, the bootstrap file was used as an
input to PROTPARS and the input randomized using the

Page 16 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:276

following parameters, random number seed = 5 and
number of times to jumble = 5. Third, CONSENSE was
used to obtain a MRC tree [75] using the tree file generated by PROTPARS as an input. As the MRC tree usually
consists of all clusters that occur >50% of the time, we
took consensus values >55 as a bootstrap reference. Bootstrap values were used to scale the trees.
We also tested the NJ method [76] using different models
of distances implemented in PROTDIST. Here, it is important to keep in mind that the overall efficiency of the different methods of phylogenetic reconstruction in building
the true tree vary with substitution rate, transition-transversion ratio, and sequence divergence [77,78]. With the
particular material we studied, parsimony and NJ trees
support the clustering of OTUs into clades and genera in
gag-pol and pol analyses, and they are consistent in not
supporting the monophyly of each group in gag analyses.
However, parsimony phylogenies proved more consistent
with comparative analyses than NJ trees when inferring
phylogenies including or evaluating the gag and/or PR
proteins. Parsimony analyses also reported better bootstrapping and were more consistent with the three Retroviridae classes than NJ analyses (NJ trees only support
classes I and II).
