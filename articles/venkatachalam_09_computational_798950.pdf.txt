Abstract
Background: Activation of PPARs has been reported to inhibit the proliferation of malignant
cells from different lineages. They are involved in transcription regulation of genes upon activation
by a ligand. The binding of PPARs to the promoter sequence either represses or activates the gene.
Hence, PPARs represent promising targets for cancer treatment because of their anti-proliferative
and pro-apoptotic activities. Here we computationally identified PPAR binding regions in NHE1 and
MnSOD. We further validated the predictions in vitro.
Results: Our results computationally predicted the presence of 2 PPRE motifs in NHE1 and 3
PPRE motifs in MnSOD. We experimentally confirmed the true motifs and their regulation by
PPAR.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that both NHE1 and MnSOD have PPRE binding motif in their
upstream/promoter region and hence are regulated by PPAR upon ligand binding.

Introduction
PPARs (Peroxisome proliferators activated Receptor)
belong to the nuclear receptor super family and are
ligand activated transcription factors, regulating a wide

variety of genes [1]. Phylogenetic studies have shown
that PPARs form a subfamily of the nuclear receptor
superfamily, along with the receptors for thyroid
hormone, retinoic acid (RA), vitamin D, ecdysone, and

the orphan receptors Rev-ErbAa (5ear1;NR1D1) and E75
(NR1D3, from Drosophila), the two latter being the
closest relatives of the PPARs [1]. PPARs play important
role in lipid metabolism, cell differentiation and development, inflammation, cancer and demyelination [2].
Three isoforms (a, b and g) for PPAR have been
identified so far in xenopus, mouse, human, rats and
hamsters [3]. The isoforms exhibit a tissue specific
expression pattern. The first isoform PPAR a is expressed
in tissues that play a role in fatty acid catabolism such as
liver, kidney, heart, and intestine [4]. This isoform is the
first described receptor that is activated by peroxisome
proliferators and hence the name [5]. The main function
of this isoform is to regulate the genes encoding lipid
metabolizing enzymes and proteins participating in lipid
metabolism [4]. The second isoform is PPAR b. This
receptor is also called as FAAR (fatty acid activated
receptor)[1]. This isoform is expressed mainly in the
brain, skeletal muscle, skin, adipose tissue, gut, placenta
and has a very broad expression pattern. Based on the
cell proliferation and differentiation, the expression
profile of this isoform varies. Both isoforms PPAR a
and b are involved in lipid utilization activities such as
fatty acid oxidation, energy uncoupling reactions and
response to fasting [1]. PPAR g has three alternatively
spliced isoforms. PPAR g1 is virtually expressed in almost
all tissues [6]. PPAR g2 is primarily expressed in adipose
tissue while PPAR g3 is expressed in white adipose tissue,
large intestine and macrophages. PPAR g regulates the
lipid storage and insulin sensitivity reactions such as
lipogenesis, adipocyte differentiation, adipocyte survival
and adipokine secretion [1]. Activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g (PPARg) has been
identified as an approach to induce differentiation and
inhibit proliferation in a variety of cancer cells. Breast
tissue, in particular, was found to express PPARg in
amounts greater than those found in normal breast
epithelium [7]. Moreover, activation of PPARg through
cells’ exposure to synthetic PPARg ligands such as
proglitazone or rosiglitazone is shown to exert antitumor
activity through cell growth inhibition and cellular
differentiation. Activation of PPARs has been reported
to inhibit the proliferation of malignant cells from
different lineages such as liposarcoma, breast adenocarcinoma, prostate carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, nonsmall cell lung carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma bladder
carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma both in vitro and
in vivo.
Various studies have also shown that PPARs are involved
in transcription regulation of genes upon activation by a
ligand. The binding of PPARs to the promoter sequence
either represses [8] or activates [9] the gene. Hence,
PPARs represent promising targets for cancer treatment

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S3/S5

because of their anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic
activities. The PPAR a, b, and g isoforms share a highly
conserved DNA binding domain that recognizes specific
DNA sequences known as Peroxisome Proliferator
Response Elements (PPREs) (11). PPAR DNA-binding
activity is modulated by Retinoic-X-Receptor (RXR).
Upon ligand binding, PPAR translocates from cytoplasm
to nucleus and forms heterodimer with RXR. PPAR/RXR
complex then binds to PPRE composed of a Direct
Repeat (DR) preferably spaced by one nucleotide (DR1)
with a consensus sequence of AGGTCA-A-AGGTCA. It
must be noted that there are DR2 motifs which are also
recognized by PPAR that are preferably spaced by two
nucleotide (DR2). Experimental evidences link upregulation of the pH regulator Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1)
to the development and progression of carcinogenesis
[10-15] and its down regulation to inhibition of cells’
growth and enhanced apoptotic sensitivity [16,17]. It is
also suggested that cancer cells are generally under
reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress [18]. As mitochondrial respiration is the main source of O2•- generation in
the cells, MnSOD (manganese superoxide dismutase) is
of prime importance in maintaining cellular ROS
balance and mitochondrial integrity in cells. This is
specifically true for tumor cells which are constantly
under ROS stress due to its increased metabolic processes
[20]. Considering the abundance of PPARg receptor and
elevated NHE1 expression in a variety of cancer cells
including breast cancer and their absolute dependence
on MnSOD it is of interest to explore PPARg agonists for
selectively tailoring the expression of NHE1 and
MnSOD. Therefore, we manually collected experimentally proven PPRE binding motifs from literature and
arrived at a collection of 250 motifs. Search of human
NHE1 and MnSOD promoter sequence against this
collection predicted two putative DR2 PPRE motifs in
NHE1 (Figure 1) and one DR1 PPRE and two DR2 PPRE
motifs in MnSOD (Figure 2). We further investigated if
PPARg binds to the promoter of NHE 1 and MnSOD
genes at these PPRE motifs. Since these genes have not
been identified as PPARg target genes in breast cancer
cells, the results for the first time confirm regulation of
NHE1 and MnSOD by PPARg.

Methodology
Collection of PPRE motifs from literature
This collection contains 250 reported PPRE motifs from
literature. Keywords “PPRE”, “PPAR consensus
sequences” “PPAR binding sequences” were used to
search for literatures in pubmed and Google Scholar. The
sequences reported only with experimental validation
were added to this collection. For each PPRE data on its
reported consensus, isoform specificity, in vivo and in

vitro binding efficiencies and Pubmed IDs were collected
(additional file 1).
Promoter sequence extraction and motif identification
The promoter sequences (5 kb) upstream of the
transcription start site from transcripts of NHE1 and
MnSOD were downloaded from NCBI http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov using keywords NHE1 and MnSOD. The
motif collection was searched/matched (string comparison) by a cgi-script against the extracted sequence of
NHE1 and MnSOD, to check if there is presence of any of
the motifs (string) in the upstream regions of the above
gene sequences. Search of human NHE1 and MnSOD
promoter sequences against this collection predicted/
identified two putative DR2 PPRE motifs in NHE1
(Figure 1) and one DR1 PPRE and two DR2 PPRE motifs
in MnSOD (Figure 2).

The general DR1 and DR2 consensus are AGGTCA N
AGGTCA (6-N-6) and AGGTCA NN AGGTCA (6-NN-6),
respectively. Both the above patterns were matched
against the collection, first by looking for the surrounding hexamers and then looking for the spacers i.e. one
nucleotide or 2 nucleotides separation. Thus, the motifs
for DR1 and DR2 are identified based on the number of
‘N’s that separate the two hexamer consensus pattern.
These predicted motifs were experimentally validated as
explained in the subsequent sections.

Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) ELISA
The levels of CAT protein were quantified using a CAT
antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals Mannheim
Germany). All CAT quantitations were normalized to
the protein concentration of the cell extract, as determined using the Coomasie Plus Protein Assay Reagent
Kit (Pierce IL, USA).
Luciferase reporter assays
3 × PPRE promoter activity was assessed with a dualluciferase assay kit (Promega WI, USA). Briefly, feeding

1 × PBS, and lysed with ice-cold 100 μl of reporter lysis
buffer. Ten microlitres of cell lysate was then added to
50 μl of luciferase substrate solution, following which
50 μl of stop & glow buffer was added for Renilla reading.
Bioluminescence generated was measured using a Sirius
luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Deutschland, Germany). The luminescence readings obtained were normalized to the protein content of the corresponding cell

For measurement of PPARg binding, each reaction
mixture contained 5 μl of 4 × NoShift Bind buffer, 1 μl
of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (0.01 U/μl in 100 mM KCl,
20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0), 1 μl of salmon sperm DNA
(500 ng/μl in nuclease-free water), 1 μl of biotinylated
10-pmol/μl target DNA duplex, and 20 μg of nuclear
lysate in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. After 30 min
incubation on ice, 80 μl of 1 × NoShift Bind buffer was
added to each reaction mixture, and the resulting 100 μl
was dispensed into one well of a freshly washed
streptavidin plate and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After
this incubation period, plates were washed with
1 × NoShift Bind buffer, the binding of PPARg was
detected by incubation for 1 h at 37°C with 100 μl of
anti-PPARg diluted 1:250 in NoShift antibody dilution
buffer. After repeated washings, horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG)
was added (1:1000 dilution in NoShift antibody dilution buffer). After 30 min of incubation at 37°C, wells
were washed thoroughly. Finally, 100 μl of room
temperature TMB (tetramethylbenzidine) substrate was
added and the wells were incubated for 10-30 min at
room temperature in the dark until a blue color
developed. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl
of 1 M HCl to each well, and A450 was measured using
Spectrofluoro Plus spectroflurometer (TECAN, Grodig,

Renilla plasmid (Clontech, CA, USA) was used to assess
transfection efficiency in dual-luciferase reporter assay
(Promega, WI, USA).
RNA isolation and mRNA determination by real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from cells by TRIZOL reagent
(Invitrogen, CA, USA) as described by manufacturer’s
instructions with a DNAse treatment step incorporated
into the protocol. Each RT reaction contains 2.5 μg of total

μM random hexamers, 0.35 U/μl RNase inhibitor, 1.1 U/μl
MultiScribe™ reverse transcriptase and made up to 10 μl
with sterile water. RT reaction was carried out at 37°C for 1
h. 5 μl of the 10 μl cDNA reaction volume was used in
realtime quantitative PCR using ABI PRISM 7500 (Applied
Biosystems, CA, USA). Normalization was to either
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or
18S RNA. Fluorescence was measured with the Sequence
Detection Systems 2.0 software. PCR was performed in
multiplex (both target and endogenous control co-amplified in the same reaction with distinct fluorescent dyes.
Primers and probe for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 18S RNA, human NHE1 and
human MnSOD were purchased as kits from Applied
Biosystems (Assays on Demand).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using paired Student’s
t-test. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
PPRE motif collection
It is known that the general DR1 and DR2 consensus are
AGGTCA N AGGTCA (6-N-6) and AGGTCA NN
AGGTCA (6-NN-6), respectively. The determining factor
for PPAR binding to the PPRE are the surrounding
hexamers 1 and 2 (AGGTCA). The DR1 and DR2 motifs
share the same hexamers and PPARs have also been
reported to bind hexamers with DR2 spacers. Thus, for
PPARs optimal spacer nucleotide is either 1 or 2. Out of
the 413 PPRE DR1 motifs collected from literature the
binding strengths were reported for 236 motifs (Additional file 1). These 236 motifs were used to match for
both DR1 and DR2 sequences. Based on sequence
match, we identified two putative PPREs in NHE1 and
three putative PPREs in MnSOD promoter sequences.
Identification of Peroxisome Proliferator Response
Elements (PPREs) within the human NHE1 and MnSOD
promoters
We identified two putative PPREs in the human NHE1
promoter, (Figure 1). The first PPRE site (PPRE1) is
within a primate-specific Alu element (Sq) [21], within

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S3/S5

which there is a cluster of four hexamers half-sites
recognized by various nuclear receptors [22-25], termed
as Alu receptor response element (AluRRE). Kumar et al.
have previously shown in the context of the human
myeloperoxidase gene, a DR2 element is also recognized
by PPARg [24]. DR2 element, in both PPRE1 and PPRE2
are seen here within the human NHE1 promoter. We
identified three putative PPREs in the human MnSOD
promoter region (Figure 2C). In the human MnSOD
promoter, PPRE1 is a DR1 element, while PPRE2 and
PPRE3 are of the DR2 elements. Here, PPRE2 is within a
primate-specific Alu element (Sx) [21].
PPARg activation by 15 d-PGJ2 represses NHE1 mRNA
and protein levels
To assess the effect of PPARg ligand (15 d-PGJ2) on
NHE1 gene expression, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells
were treated with 3 μM and 5 μM 15 d-PGJ2 for 24 h. 15
d-PGJ2 (15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2) is a metabolite of the
eicosanoid prostaglandin J2, and is described as the most
potent natural ligand for PPARg with reported Kds
varying from 325 nM to 2.5 μM. As shown by real
time quantification of mRNA level, exposure of both cell
lines to increasing concentration of 15 d-PGJ2, led to a
significant decrease in NHE1 mRNA levels (Figure 3A)
dose-dependent decrease in NHE1 protein expression
(Figure 3B and 3C).
PPARg activation by 15 d-PGJ2 represses MnSOD mRNA
and protein levels
We investigated the regulation of human MnSOD mRNA
and protein levels in two breast cancer cell lines treated
with 15 d-PGJ2. Realtime-PCR analysis shows that
relative MnSOD mRNA expressions in both MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were significantly reduced
when exposed varying 15 d-PGJ2 doses (Figure 4A).
Western blot analysis corroborated this decrease in
MnSOD mRNA levels with an observed dose-dependent
decrease in MnSOD protein levels in MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-468 cells (Figure 4B and 4C).
Experimental evidence for PPRESearch-derived prediction
for PPARg binding site in NHE1 promoter
To determine which of the two PPREs within the human
NHE1 is the true PPARg binding site, we transfected MCF7 breast cancer cells with a full length NHE1 promoter
construct (containing both PPRE1 and PPRE2) compared
to a parallel set up transfected with a 5′ deletion of the full
length (only contains PPRE2) (Figure 5A). Activation of
PPARg by its natural ligand, 15 d-PGJ2 decreased NHE1
promoter activity only when cells were transfected with
the full length NHE1 promoter construct but not when
PPRE1 is absent (Figure 5B). Our results therefore
demonstrate that NHE1 is a PPARg target gene. We also

narrowed the bonafide PPARg binding site to PPRE1,
thereby providing experimental evidence for predicted
PPRE motifs in the upstream region of NHE1.
Experimental evidence for PPRESearch-derived prediction
for PPARg binding site in human MnSOD promoter
To determine which of the three PPREs within the
human MnSOD is the true PPARg binding site, we

transfected MDA-MB-231 cells with a human MnSOD
promoter construct (-3400 to +24, containing PPRE1,
PPRE2, and PPRE3) and a 5′ deletion construct (-1605
to +24) that lacks PPRE1 but has PPRE2 and PPRE3
(Figure 6A). Our results show both full length construct
and the 5′ deletion construct responded to 15 d-PGJ2
treatment in a dose-dependent decrease in promoter
activity (Figure 6B). This seems to suggest that the

bonafide PPRE would be either PPRE2 or PPRE3.
Interestingly, a further 5′ deletion construct (-555 to
+24) that lacks all three PPREs did not decrease with 15 dPGJ2 treatment, which suggests that 15 d-PGJ2 treatment
on human MnSOD promoter activity is PPARg-dependent
(Figure 6B). To determine if PPRE2 or PPRE3 is the
bonafide PPARg binding site, using a NoShift assay with
5′ biotinylated oligonucleotides for each of the two
PPREs,(Figure 6C), we conclusively show that PPRE3 is
indeed the PPARg binding site within the human MnSOD
promoter region, providing experimental proof for our
prediction. Interestingly, PPRE3 also had the strongest
predicted binding efficiency of 0.89 based on literature.
More importantly, PPRE2 which was not predicted by
PPRE (but was added as it was Alu element (Sx)) to bind
PPARg, our DNA binding assay indeed shows no
significant binding by PPARg to PPRE2 (Figure 6C).

Discussion
Breast cancer is the third most common cancer globally
and accounts for the highest morbidity and mortality. It
is the second highest occurring cancer in women and one
of the leading causes of death [26]. Although antiestrogens have provided an effective endocrine therapy, a
large number of patients acquiring resistance to these
drugs pose a significant problem. Recently, a new
approach using activators of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma (PPARg) to inhibit proliferation and increase cell death in breast cancer cell lines has
given hope to the development of a new class of
anticancer drugs [27]. Interestingly, tumor breast tissue
expresses PPARg in amounts greater than normal breast
epithelium, suggesting for a novel therapeutic approach
for ligand-activated PPARg as an anti-tumor agent in
differentiation-based breast cancer therapy.
Normal functioning of cell metabolism occurs within a
restricted intracellular pH (pHi) range. Regulation of pHi
is accomplished via active extrusion of H+ by the Na+/H+
Exchangers (NHEs), a membrane antiporter expressed in
a variety of cell types. The NHE family consists of ten
isoforms, NHE1 to NHE10. Interestingly, apart from its
role as a principal regulator of pHi and cell volume, the
ubiquitously expressed NHE1 has been implicated in cell
proliferation and transformation. Conversely, tumor cells
deficient in NHE1 either fail to grow or show severely
retarded growth when implanted in immuno-deficient
mice [12]. More recently, we showed that down regulation of NHE1 expression by direct silencing of the gene
expression or H2O2 treatment leads to cells’ growth arrest
and sensitization to etoposide or staurosporine [16,17].
Development of breast cancer has also been correlated to
oxidative stress, brought about by alterations to the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S3/S5

delicate balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS)
and oxidative defenses [28,29] ROS stress seems to
render cancer cells more dependent on MnSOD to
protect them by maintaining cellular ROS balance. The
importance of MnSOD became clearer when genetic
knockout studies in mice indicate that MnSOD, but not
other SODs, is essential for cell survival. Several recent
studies reported that forced suppression of MnSOD
expression by siRNA leads to decrease in breast cancer
cells invasive property [30]and to sensitization of
ovarian cancer cells to anti-cancer drugs [31]. Although
the mouse MnSOD gene has been shown to be a PPARg
target gene [32], a direct association between PPARg and
human MnSOD from tumor cells’ perspective has not
been shown.
Taken together, our results suggest that NHE1 and
MnSOD have PPRE binding motifs of high affinity.
This confirms that these genes can be downregulated by
PPARg in presence of a ligand. Since, downregulation of
NHE1 inhibits proliferation and increases cell death in
breast cancer cell lines, the presented data provides new
direction for development of a new class of anticancer
drugs. Concurrently, downregulaion of MnSOD expression is reported to decrease cancer cells invasive property
[30] and sensitizes cancer cells to anti-cancer drugs.
Thus, the presented data suggests that PPARg can regulate
MnSOD in human cell linesPPARg has been found to
regulate MnSOD transcription by binding to a PPRE on
the mouse MnSOD promoter region. This report for the
first time suggests PPARg activation and its involvement
in downregulating MnSOD gene expression in human.
