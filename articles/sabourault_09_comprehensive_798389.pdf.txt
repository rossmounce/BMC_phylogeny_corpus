Abstract
Background: Coral reef ecosystems are renowned for their diversity and beauty. Their immense
ecological success is due to a symbiotic association between cnidarian hosts and unicellular
dinoflagellate algae, known as zooxanthellae. These algae are photosynthetic and the cnidarianzooxanthellae association is based on nutritional exchanges. Maintenance of such an intimate
cellular partnership involves many crosstalks between the partners. To better characterize
symbiotic relationships between a cnidarian host and its dinoflagellate symbionts, we conducted a
large-scale EST study on a symbiotic sea anemone, Anemonia viridis, in which the two tissue layers
(epiderm and gastroderm) can be easily separated.
Results: A single cDNA library was constructed from symbiotic tissue of sea anemones A. viridis
in various environmental conditions (both normal and stressed). We generated 39,939 high quality
ESTs, which were assembled into 14,504 unique sequences (UniSeqs). Sequences were analysed
and sorted according to their putative origin (animal, algal or bacterial). We identified many new
repeated elements in the 3'UTR of most animal genes, suggesting that these elements potentially
have a biological role, especially with respect to gene expression regulation. We identified genes of
animal origin that have no homolog in the non-symbiotic starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis
genome, but in other symbiotic cnidarians, and may therefore be involved in the symbiosis
relationship in A. viridis. Comparison of protein domain occurrence in A. viridis with that in N.
vectensis demonstrated an increase in abundance of some molecular functions, such as protein
binding or antioxidant activity, suggesting that these functions are essential for the symbiotic state
and may be specific adaptations.
Conclusion: This large dataset of sequences provides a valuable resource for future studies on
symbiotic interactions in Cnidaria. The comparison with the closest available genome, the sea
anemone N. vectensis, as well as with EST datasets from other symbiotic cnidarians provided a set
of candidate genes involved in symbiosis-related molecular crosstalks. Altogether, these results
provide new molecular insights that could be used as a starting-point for further functional
genomics studies.

Background
Sea anemones, together with corals, jellyfish and hydras,
belong to the Cnidaria, which are basal to the eumetazoa
and ancestral to the bilateria. Cnidaria are characterized
by a sac-like body plan with a single oral opening surrounded by numerous tentacles. As diploblastic animals,
they are composed of only two embryonic tissue layers,
the epiderm and the gastroderm (Additional file 1).
Many cnidarians harbour photosynthetically active unicellular algae within their gastrodermal cells. In most
cases, such symbiont algae are dinoflagellates from the
genus Symbiodinium, commonly referred to as zooxanthellae. This association is a trophic endosymbiosis and is
considered to be mutualistic because the zooxanthellae
provide their cnidarian host with reduced organic carbon
resulting from their photosynthetic activity [1] while the
host provides the zooxanthellae with inorganic carbon
[2], inorganic nitrogen [3,4] and inorganic phosphate [5],
as well as a refuge from herbivory. This simple mutual
partnership has recently been revealed to be more complex, however, since the holobiont was found to be a
dynamic assemblage of animal, zooxanthellae, endolithic
algae and fungi, prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea) and
viruses [6,7]. Endosymbioses are thus highly complex
associations, implying intimate interactions between host
and symbionts as well as constraints, such as hyperoxic
conditions generated by symbiont photosynthesis, and
transfer of inorganic carbon to the symbiont [8].
In recent decades, biochemical and physiological studies
have highlighted numerous adaptations in cnidarian host
tissues (for review [8]), such as the presence of natural
sunscreens (UV-absorbing mycosporine-like amino acids,
[9]), remarkable antioxidant defences [10,11], specific
mechanisms of inorganic carbon absorption and concentration [12], and mechanisms of inorganic nitrogen
absorption [3]. However, despite increasing knowledge
about their physiological inter-relationship, very little is
known about the molecular adaptations that have permitted this successful partnership.
The cnidarian-dinoflagellate endosymbiotic association is
the very foundation of the highly productive and diversified coral reef ecosystem. Coral reefs are considered to
host at least 30% of all known marine fauna [13], like
"oases" within marine nutrient-deprived deserts [14], and
play a crucial role in shaping tropical ecosystems. Coral
reefs are, however, now also experiencing high levels of
anthropogenically-induced stress (global climate change,
pollution). Such environmental perturbations, in addition to pathogens, contribute to the breakdown of symbiosis known as "coral bleaching", and even mortality [15].
Bleaching results in whitening of cnidarian symbiotic tissues, due either to a direct loss of dinoflagellates and/or a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/333

decrease in photosynthetic pigment concentration [16].
Mass bleaching events have been increasing in both frequency and severity since the 1980s [15].
The most significant contributions to cnidarian molecular
biology are the complete genome analysis of the starlet
Sea anemone Nematostella vectensis [17-19] and the Hydra
magnipapillata genome project [20]. However, neither of
these species is symbiotic. In addition, phylogenetic studies suggest that N. vectensis and A. viridis might belong to
different suborders (Additional file 2), although both
belong to the Hexacorallia Actiniaria [21]. Very few studies using high-throughput techniques have been published to date on symbiotic cnidarians. Most cDNA
libraries have been constructed from non-symbiotic cells
and only limited EST datasets were generated. Only three
studies have been conducted on symbiotic anthozoans:
Acropora millepora, a reef building coral (10,247 ESTs;
[19,22]); Aiptasia pulchella, a tropical Sea anemone (870
ESTs; [23]); and a comparative study on two scleractinian
corals, Montastrea faveolata (3,854 ESTs) and Acropora palmata (14,588 ESTs, [24]). All have shown that cnidarians
are more similar to vertebrates, in terms of gene repertoire, composition and intron/exon structure, than the
well known ecdysozoan model organisms, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, where extensive gene
loss has occurred [19,22]. These EST datasets have been
used to develop small-scale microarrays for gene expression analysis in several coral-algal symbioses: Acropora
millepora, Acropora palmata and Montastrea faveolata [2527].
Genomic information on zooxanthellae has been
obtained by Leggat et al [28] who analysed 2,682 ESTs of
tropical Symbiodinium (clade C3) extracted from the coral
Acropora aspera. Another cDNA library (1,484 UniSeqs)
was constructed from a cultured Symbiodinium of clade A
(CassKB8), originally isolated from the Upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea sp, and sequences were compared to those
of clade C3 [29]. Additional metagenomic analyses were
performed on the microbial community associated with
the coral Porites asteroids [7,30], extending our knowledge
on the organismal diversity of the holobiont, although no
transcriptomic analyses were carried out.
To better characterize symbiotic relationships between
cnidarian host and associated symbionts, we conducted a
large-scale EST study on a symbiotic sea anemone. We
chose the sea anemone Anemonia viridis as our study species, in which the two tissue layers (epiderm and gastroderm) can be easily separated. A. viridis is the most
abundant sea anemone of the Mediterranean coasts and
hosts the temperate Symbiodinium sp. of Clade A, which
has been suggested to be the dominant clade of zooxanthellae in the Mediterranean Sea [31]. We prepared a sin-

gle cDNA library from whole specimens under several
stress conditions, in order to maximize the presence of
genes required for symbiosis. 39, 939 ESTs were generated
and a total of 14,504 UniSeqs were identified, assigned a
putative origin and annotated. This large collection of
UniSeqs provides the better characterized transcriptomic
knowledge of symbiosis in cnidarians. The data will further our comprehension of such relationships and contribute to functional genomic surveys.

Results and discussion
ESTs generation and analysis
A cDNA library was made from both symbiotic (gastroderm) and non-symbiotic (epiderm) tissues of the sea
anemone Anemonia viridis (Additional file 1). In order to
maximize the diversity of genes expressed under both normal and stress conditions within the symbiotic association, sea anemones were subjected to different
environmental conditions before RNA extraction and
cDNA library construction (light/dark sampling, thermal
stress, hyperoxia conditions, see Materials & Methods).
Out of 50,304 sequenced clones, a total of 41,247 readable sequences were produced, corresponding to a
sequencing success of 82%, and 39,939 high quality ESTs
were generated (Figure 1 and Additional file 3). A. viridis
repetitive sequences were identified and masked using
RepeatMasker before assembly. Trimmed masked ESTs
were further subjected to cluster analysis using the TIGRTGICL pipeline with default parameters [32]. A total of
30,087 ESTs were assembled into 4,652 contigs (Additional file 4) while 9,852 sequences remained as singletons. The mean trimmed EST sequence length was 626 bp,
but sequences could be assembled into contigs of up to 4
kb (CL4Contig4, described as ribosomal protein L8,
3,887 bp). Most contigs (2,959) were composed of three
ESTs or less, with an average length of 895 bp, suggesting
that they covered only parts of the transcript sequences.

Apart from the functional genomics resources available
for the reef-building corals Acropora palmata and Montastrea faveolata [24], most cnidarian genomic studies have
been performed on non-symbiotic tissues (aposymbiotic
developmental stages or adults). To our knowledge, our
study provides the largest EST collection from a symbiotic
cnidarian.
The most abundant transcripts (contigs composed of
more than 100 ESTs) are listed in Table 1. Most of these
correspond to ribosomal proteins, or proteins involved in
basic cellular processes (actin, elongation factor 1 alpha,
CAAT enhancer binding protein). However, it should be
highlighted that two of these highly abundant transcripts
had no similarity with any available sequence, either in
UniProt or NR databases, while two other large clusters
represent proteins that might be involved in stress
responses (HSP70 and ferritin). Ferritins are ubiquitously
expressed proteins that have a central role in normal iron
homoeostasis, as well as during oxidant stress, by reducing the participation of iron in free-radical-generating
reactions [33]. Ferritin genes have also been identified as
being highly expressed in Acropora EST datasets and one
has been shown to be under positive selection [24].
Microarray experiments, designed to identify genes differentially expressed in response to elevated temperature in
Anthopleura elegantissima [34] or A. viridis (data not
shown), revealed that ferritin genes might be induced in
response to increases in reactive oxygen species following
thermal stress.
Repeated elements
Based on reverse transcriptase domain search, 46 transposable elements (retrotransposons/retroposons) were
identified (data not shown). Among these, 4 were of
prokaryotic origin (without any similarity to N. vectensis
sequences) and 42 were of metazoan origin. While 2 of

them were almost identical to N. vectensis transposable
elements, 21 only had slight similarity to N. vectensis
sequences (BlastX or BlastN with E-value of 1.10-25 to
1.10-10), and 19 showed no similarity to N. vectensis
sequences but had been previously identified in other
Metazoa.
Self BlastN analysis on our EST dataset also identified
another abundant set of repeated elements. Over 1,500
repetitive sequences were identified, with 412 repeated
more than 10 times in our UniSeqs dataset. A typical
sequence would be around 200 bp length, harbouring
40–50 bp inverted terminal repeats at its extremities.
These repeats often formed very long and stable hairpins,
depending on their orientation (Figure 2). They were
found in 19.8% of UniSeqs and were overrepresented
within contigs (62% of contigs contained at least one
repeat). When open reading frame could be identified,
these A. viridis repeated elements were always mapped in
the 3'UTRs of the protein coding genes. Using a BlastN

analysis, none of these sequences were found either in the
genome of N. vectensis or in the large EST datasets of Hydra
magnipapillata, and search in Repbase did not show any
homologs. However, members of these A. viridis repeated
elements could be found in the limited EST datasets available for the symbiotic coral Acropora millepora and the sea
anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. Further structural and
functional characterisations of these repeated elements
are currently being made.
Comparative analysis to related taxa
Because the cDNA library was made from symbiotic tissue, we expected to find ESTs related both to the cnidarian
host and to its dinoflagellate symbionts. The analysis
pipeline used in this study is presented in Figure 1.
Sequences were compared with SwissProt (2008.03) and
Uniprot KB (TrEMBL+Swissprot) (2008.03) databases
using BlastX with a cutoff E-value of < 1.10-10 to retrieve
functional annotations. Of the assembled dataset, 6,238

ilarity to any sequences in the chosen databases.
Sequences were also compared with NCBI-indexed
prokaryotic nucleic sequences (2007.08 release), using
BlastN with a stringent E-value of < 1.10-15 to assess the
proportion of prokaryotic sequences. Finally, a specific
search of the UniSeqs for virus proteins returned 7 hits.
Relative contribution is shown in Figure 3. First of all, a
relatively high proportion of sequences (57%) remained
that showed no significant similarities to previously
described genes and were therefore considered as
'unknown'. This is somewhat comparable with results
obtained from other cnidaria, Acropora palmata, Acropora
millepora, Montastrea faveolata, and Nematostella vectensis
[19,24]. Most of the UniSeqs identified in Symbiodinium
sp were also of unknown origin [28]. Metazoan hits were
found for 32.3% of UniSeqs (75% of annotated
sequences). Among these, most of the annotated UniSeqs
(4,266 out of 4685) matched with Nematostella vectensis
predicted proteins. However, we also identified sequences
that were clearly from the host (first Blast hits of metazoan
origin with cutoff E-value < 1.10-50), but these had no significant similarity to predicted proteins of N. vectensis.
Three of these (a glycoprotein, a ferroxidase and an

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/333

amine-oxidase) were studied in more detail (Figure 4).
PCR and sequencing were first performed on genomic
DNA from both A. viridis epiderm and in vitro cultured
Symbiodinium, which confirmed the animal origin of these
sequences (Figure 4A). The first sequence studied is
related to the ependymin glycoprotein family (more specifically to the Mammalian Ependymin-Related Proteins
group or MERP1), which has been well described in vertebrates due to its involvement in the regeneration processes. Ependymins are secretory proteins that can bind
calcium and that were found predominantly in the cerebrospinal fluid of teleost fish. A bound form has been
described, associated with the extracellular matrix. Recent
data demonstrated that these proteins are also present in
non-vertebrate deuterostomes and protostomes [35], and
that positive selection may have shaped their evolution.
Figure 4B illustrates an amino acid alignment of A. viridis
MERP sequences to homologous proteins found in publicly available databases (Bayesian analysis of the MERP
sequence confirmed the phylogenetic relationship, not
shown). The presence of ependymin proteins in basal
organisms clearly indicates for the first time that this protein family is far older than previously thought (first
described as chordate-specific, then deuterostome-specific, and finally also found in protostomes).
In addition, there are at least 3 distinct MERP homologues
in A. viridis, all of animal origin. As this is never the case
in other phyla (only one homologue was found in any
other species), we could hypothesize that MERP are
important for symbiosis in cnidarians. The second
sequence is related to a copper-dependent ferroxidase
family protein (hephaestin) involved in copper detoxification, which has been described both in eukaryotes (unicellular eukaryotes and vertebrates) and prokaryotes.
Nevertheless, no significant similarity was found in D.
melanogaster or in C. elegans genomes, nor in any available
protostome database, suggesting that this has been lost
during protostome evolution. The third sequence is
related to a prokaryotic amine-oxidase (permease) family
protein, which has also been identified in the genome of
C. elegans and other Caenorhabditidae but not in any
other animal sequence database. Such species-specific
occurrence could be explained by the presence of a similar
prokaryote in both nematoda and A. viridis associated
flora (sequence contamination) or a parallel gene transfer
event during their evolution. However, molecular phylogenetic analyses (neighbor joining, maximum parsimony
and maximum likelihood) showed that cnidarian and
rhabditidae nematode sequences cluster to outside other
prokaryote representative gene sequences (Additional file
5). The latter rather suggest that amine-oxidase genes were
maintained in these taxa but lost in other metazoa.
Quite a large proportion of UniSeqs (9%) were uniquely
shared with prokaryotes, of which Proteobacteria was the

most prominent bacterial group (Pseudomonas, Bordetella, and Burkholderia). The holobiont has already been
described as a dynamic assemblage, made up of the animal host, zooxanthellae, endolithic algae and fungi, Bacteria, and Archea [7]. Such "prokaryotic sequences" could
therefore be assigned to the sea anemone-associated flora.
In addition, a small but significant number of A. viridis
sequences, recognized as being of prokaryotic origin
based on Blast analysis, had already been identified in the
N. vectensis genome. Such genes are clearly similar in
sequence to prokaryotic homologs, although they contain
introns. In N. vectensis and A. millepora they were proposed as "ancient genes", conserved in cnidarians but lost
in other animal genomes [19]. Although our results are in
line with this interpretation, comparative genomic studies
among cnidarians, such as A. viridis, could help to identify the most probable evolutionary scenario between
maintenance of "non-metazoan" genes in cnidarians or
lateral gene transfer events, followed by rapid intron
acquisition.

H), and water as a negative control (C). Three other specific
genes were used to confirm the resulting profiles: Ssp EF2 is
the nuclear gene for Symbiodinium sp elongation factor 2, Ssp
psbA is the chloroplast-encoded gene for Symbiodinium sp
photosystem II protein D1, and Av EF1 is the nuclear gene for
A. viridis elongation factor 1 alpha. B: Amino acids alignment

Surprisingly, only a small fraction of our dataset could be
assigned to unicellular eukaryote sequences (putative
Symbiodinium sp, 3.6% of annotated sequences). Two well
accepted explanations have been proposed: i) poor representation of dinoflagellate sequences in databases, leading to wrong assignment after Blast analysis; and ii)
technical bias due to the Symbiodinium cell wall impairing
complete RNA extraction with standard methods, thus
leading to an under-representative number of cDNAs in
our library.
GC content was calculated for all UniSeqs to better assign
a source to the transcripts (species of origin). Figure 5 represents the distribution of GC content in the three major
taxa (metazoans, unicellular eukaryotes and associated
prokaryotic flora), as well as for sequences without BlastX
hits (unknown). Two distinct distribution curves were
observed, with the metazoan ESTs averaging 40% GC,

while bacterial ESTs averaged 63%. Despite our small
number of Symbiodinium sequences, their GC content
(58%) agreed with that already published for dinoflagellates, which have a relatively high GC content compared
with other eukaryotes: Triplett et al [36] calculated a GC
content of 64% for Heterocapsa pygmaea and an EST analysis of Alexandrium tamarense estimated that coding region
GC-content was 60.8%, whereas GC-content in the 3'UTR was slightly less, at 57.6% [37]. GC-content analysis
of our unknown sequences revealed that ESTs were clustered around two peaks corresponding to 35% and 58%
GC content for the larger and smaller peaks respectively.
These data strongly suggest that most of the unknown
sequences are likely to be of animal origin. As the GC content of 3' UTRs is usually lower than that of 5' UTRs or
CDSs, these results are also consistent with our hypothesis
that these sequences are mainly 3' UTR (due to cloning
strategy), which also explains their low level of annotation. On the other hand, the smaller peak (58% GC)
could be attributed to dinoflagellate sequences, although
no dinoflagellate genome is currently available to test this,
and the most closely related available genomes are those
of apicomplexans (Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma
gondii), which are also compact genomes of parasitic protozoans.
To gain some insight into genes potentially involved in
symbiosis among cnidaria, we performed comparative
Blast analyses on the subpart of A. viridis sequences that
were of animal origin (12,448 sequences). They were subjected to tBlastX (cutoff E-value of < 1.10-10) against cni-

darian EST sequences available in NCBI-dbEST (2009.05).
A parallel BlastX (cutoff E-value of < 1.10-10) was performed against the N. vectensis predicted proteins dataset.
Table 2 gives the number of positive Blast hits (presence
vs absence) obtained from A. viridis sequences against
ESTs from selected cnidarian species. This comparison
highlighted two species with a high number of homologous sequences, the sea anemone M. senile and the symbiotic stony corals A. millepora and A. palmata. In the Figure
6 Venn diagram we compared A. viridis with two non symbiotic species (N. vectensis and M. senile), and the symbiotic Acropora species: 1,535 sequences were common to
the four species, while only 129 sequences (of which 88
have no BlastX hit) were specific to the symbiotic species,
which probably contain candidate genes required for the
symbiosis.
Functional classification of ESTs
Finally, this set of UniSeqs was annotated using similarity
searches in both nucleotide and protein databases, as well
as domain searches. Gene ontology terms were then
assigned automatically using customized scripts based on
InterProScan search results. We also submitted N. vectensis
predicted proteins to the same InterProScan analysis for a
comparative approach. To homogenize annotation level
we only kept the root domain, using the hierarchical
domain organization available from EBI. InterPro protein
domains were identified in 40% of proteins. Based on
similarity searches (Figure 3), we assigned putative taxa
(A. viridis, Symbiodinium or associated flora) to each
unique sequence. Figure 7 represents the distribution of
assigned gene ontology terms. Comparison of domain
occurrence in A. viridis with that in N. vectensis demonstrated that our library is highly representative of the Actinaria transcriptome. We also identified increased
abundance of a number of molecular functions in A.
viridis compared with N. vectensis: translation regulator
activity (0.46 vs 0.23%), oxidoreductase activity (6.86 vs
4.98%), antioxidant activity (0.07 vs 0.03%), and structural molecule activity (3.24 vs 1.28%). It is noteworthy
that some of these molecular functions are involved in
symbiotic interactions with zooxanthellae, such as protein binding [24], nutrient transport and antioxidant
activity [8]. For example, A. viridis counters the oxidative
stress produced by the photosynthetic activity of its symbionts by using a great diversity of antioxidant defences
[38]. Some biological processes were also increased in the
A. viridis dataset compared with N. vectensis: secretion
(0.81 vs 0.36%) and catabolism (0.65 vs 0.26%). The
cytoplasmic components were also found to be more
highly represented in A. viridis compared with N. vectensis
(20.42 vs 9.59%).

All these differences between the present A. viridis dataset
and the N. vectensis genome may reflect the crucial role of

Conclusion
This large EST collection has provided high quality data
on all aspects of a temperate symbiotic cnidarian, particularly with regard to coding sequences and regulation features. For example, we identified many novel repeated
elements (RE) in 3'UTRs, suggesting an invasion of most
animal sequences by some specific RE families. It will be
interesting to further investigate their potential biological
role, particularly on gene regulation. Phylogenetic origin
and functional classification of the holobiont sequences
allowed the identification of several symbiotic candidate
genes. These data are now being used to develop a dedicated microarray that will provide a valuable resource for
future studies on symbiotic interactions in A. viridis. Furthermore, these data also have shown the importance of
Symbiodinium symbionts as well as the associated flora of
the three major prokaryotic species. Some sequences will
be further analysed from the new perspective of gene
transfer between host and symbiont. The relatively low
abundance of sequences from Symbiodinium was attributed to experimental bias; a new ongoing sequencing
project should fill this gap. Finally, these data from a temperate zone cnidarian provide novel molecular insights

Methods
Sampling and cDNA library construction
To maximize the diversity of genes expressed in the symbiotic association under both normal and stress conditions, sea anemones were subjected to different controlled
stress conditions before RNA extraction and cDNA library
construction.

Specimens of the Mediterranean sea anemone, Anemonia
viridis (Forskål, 1775), were collected close to Villefranche-sur-mer (France). During an initial acclimatation
period of at least 4 weeks, animals were maintained in
tanks of running seawater at 17 ± 1°C with a light intensity of 250 μmol quanta m-2s-1 (overhead metal halide
lamps Philips HQI TS 400W), on a 12 h light/12 h dark
cycle (starting at 8 am). Animals were fed once a week.
After the acclimatation period, animals were treated and
sampled (five tentacles from each specimen, four specimens from each experiment except for the hyperoxia
stress) as follows:
• Light/dark cycle: sampling was performed at different times of the day (10 am and 7 pm) and night (7
am and 10 pm).
• Thermal stress: sea water was heated from 17°C to
24°C over 2·hrs and maintained at this maximal temperature for 5·days. Five A. viridis tentacles were sampled after 1, 2 and 5 days of continuous thermal stress.

• Hyperoxia condition: three specimens of A. viridis
were subjected to 10·h of 100% O2 at 17.0 ± 1°C
under a constant irradiance of 250·μmol·m-2·s-1.
Oxygen saturation of the medium was achieved by
bubbling pure O2 through seawater and was monitored using a gas analyser (Radiometer Copenhagen
ABL 30; Copenhagen, Denmark).

was made both by using CENSOR [44] to retrieve publicly
available repeats, and by running a BlastN of all ESTs
against themselves to identify the most abundant repeat
regions.

• Bleached specimens, resulting from symbiosis disruption, and maintained bleached over several years
(at 17°C in dark conditions) were also sampled.

Repeated elements analysis
Putative transposable elements (46 sequences) were first
identified based on homology search after BlastX analysis
against UniProt KB (E-value of < 1.10-20). An additional
local BlastN search was performed using the EST dataset
both as query sequence file and target database. Repeated
motif sequences, i.e. repeats occurring more than twice
from non overlapping ESTs, were selected as a first screen
repeats dataset. These were used, together with the Repbase repeats library, to mask our EST sequences before
clustering and assembling (TGICL). The same first screen
dataset was then BlastN compared with the assembled
database, and repeated motif sequences occurring on
more than two different UniSeqs (E-value of < 1.10-20)
were considered as A. viridis repeat sequences.

The mRNAs were then extracted using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen), as described in Richier et al. [39], and equal
amounts of mRNA from the different conditions
described above were combined before cDNA library construction. A. viridis cDNA library was generated at the
RZPD (Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung GmbH, Berlin, Germany) by oligodT, random priming and directionally cloning into pSPORT1. From this
library, 50,304 clones were picked, replicated and subsequently sequenced at the Genoscope (French national
sequencing centre). High-throughput sequencing of 5'end
was performed using a Big-Dye terminator cycle sequencing kit and M13 reverse primer on an ABI-3730 Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's protocol (Genoscope, Evry, France). 41,247 chromatograms were thus generated and further analyzed.
EST processing and analysis
EST sequences were processed using SURF analysis pipeline tools (SURF: SeqUence Repository and Feature detection, developed by the SIGENAE team, Dehais Patrice and
Eddie Iannucelli, INRA, Toulouse). Basically, SURF provided an integrated solution, from chromatogram data
storage to cloned insert detection, by integrating several
dedicated bioinformatic software programs (sequence
base calling, vector detection, etc.) in order to produce relevant nucleotide sequences according to base quality and
feature detection. The chromatogram files were exported
to PHRED for base calling [40,41]. Cloned insert detection was made according to different detected features
(vector, adaptator, poly(A) or poly(T) tails and repeat)
and their respectively positions, using third party programs (Crossmatch and RepeatMasker). Only inserts with
more than 100 bp, with a Phred score >20, and not
belonging to a low complexity area were exported into a
fasta format with its corresponding quality file. Additional
extremity trimming was made using the "trimseq" command (EMBOSS package). Low complexity regions and
repeats were masked using the RepeatMasker program
[42]. For this purpose, two different libraries were used:
the RepeatMaskerLib (RepBase Update of 2007.09.24,
[43]) and a custom library of A. viridis. This custom library

High quality ESTs (39,939) were then assembled into
contigs using the TIGR-TGICL tool [32].

Gene Ontology annotation
Gene functions were automatically assigned to 39% of the
predicted proteins (5,652 UniSeqs). This assignment was
based on the identification of InterPro (IPR) domains
[45] using InterproScan [46] and the following command
line: iprscan -cli -i unisequences.fa -o unisequences.ipr.raw -seqtype n -goterms -iprlookup -format
raw. For comparative analysis of IPR domains found in
the A. viridis dataset, we also ran the program InterproScan on the predicted N. vectensis proteome dataset. To
homogenize the granularity level of annotation between
organisms for each non-overlapping set of domains
found, we only kept the root domain. We used the hierarchical organization of domains proposed in the "ParentChild" description available on the EBI public ftp server
ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/interpro/ParentCh
ildTreeFile.txt. For example, all CYP proteins which have
a P450 domain ([InterPro:IPR002949], [InterPro:
IPR002397], [InterPro: IPR008070]) were counted at
their root domain (IPR001128).
Comparative genomic analysis
All contig and singleton sequences were compared with
several databases, using Blast: the Nematostella vectensis
draft
genome
(Predicted
proteins,
http://
www.jgi.doe.gov/), SwissProt (2008.03), TrEMBL
(2008.03) and other ESTs from symbiotic cnidarian species (Acropora millepora, Acropora palmata, Aiptasia pallida,
Montastrea faveolata) or from non symbiotic species
(Metridium senile).

To confirm the origin of some selected genes, amplifications were performed on 10 ng of genomic DNA from A.
viridis epidermal cells (non-symbiotic cells, animal origin
[39]), cultured Symbiodinium cells extracted from A. viridis
tentacles (non symbiotic cells, symbiont origin), and
whole tentacle extracts (symbiotic cells, both animal and
symbionts). Primers designed in the experiment are presented in Additional file 6 and were used in 40-cycle PCR
reactions. Elongation factor 1 alpha and Elongation factor 2
were used as positive controls for nuclear-encoded genes
from A. viridis and Symbiodinium spp, respectively, while
psbA (photosystem II protein D1) was used as a positive
control for chloroplast-encoded Symbiodinium spp genes.
Sequence alignment was done using Multalin [47]. Signal
peptide prediction was performed using SignalP [48].
Phylogenetic analyses were done using both MEGA 4.0
[49] and PHYML [50] software.
