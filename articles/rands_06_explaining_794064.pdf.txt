Abstract
Background: Studies of birds have a disproportionate representation in the literature on lifehistory evolution, because of the (apparent) ease with which the costs and benefits can be
quantified and manipulated. During reproduction, birds frequently show a highly conserved pattern
of mass change and changes in mass loss during breeding have been widely considered to be a valid
short-term measure of the costs of reproduction. Experimental manipulations of the breeding
attempts of birds usually argue that the presence of a response shows that a cost of reproduction
exists, but there is little consensus as to how the size of these costs can be measured.
Results: We model this mass loss by considering how a parent can maximise its lifetime
reproductive success, using a theoretical framework that is particularly suited to modelling parental
care in altricial birds. If lifetime reproductive success is taken to be the sum of a parent's current
and future reproductive success, we show that the exact forms of these components will influence
the optimal amount of mass a parent should lose. In particular, we demonstrate that the shape of
the relationship between parental investment and chick survival will lead to differing degrees of
investment between parents of different initial qualities: parents with initially high levels of energy
reserves could conceivably invested a lesser, similar or greater amount of resources than parents
with initially low reserves, and these initially 'heavy' parents could potentially end up being lighter
than the initially 'lighter' individuals.
Conclusion: We argue that it is difficult to make predictions about the dependence of a parent's
final mass on its initial mass, and therefore mass loss should only be used as a short-term measure
of the costs of reproduction with caution. The model demonstrates that we require a better
understanding of the relationship between mass loss and both current and future reproductive
success of the parent, before predictions about mass loss can be made and tested. We discuss steps
that could be taken to increase the accuracy of our predictions.

Background
Most species of bird show stereotypical patterns of mass
loss during their breeding period, and studies looking at
these changes in body mass have been appearing in the lit-

erature since the 1930s [1,2]. There are species-specific
trends of loss during the reproductive phase, which can be
related to phylogeny and life-history strategies [3]. Some
but not all of the loss is due to the regression of the gonads

parent will therefore reflect a trade-off between its current
and future reproductive success [17]. In this paper we
describe a simple model that suggests that if the parent is
optimising its total reproductive success, then quantifiable differences (or their absence) in mass loss and final
mass may occur for reasons that have not yet been
explored experimentally.

simple linear function of x. Shown are the fitness functions
for parents that start off with high (heavy) and low (light) values of x0 – the resulting offspring fitness at any final mass
(such as that at which future reproductive success fitness is
maximised, xpers) is greater for the parent that starts off with
higher reserves, as it has allocated a larger amount of
reserves to the offspring to reach this mass.

after gametogenesis [4-6]. A reduction in mass as a result
of a reduction in energy reserves could have an effect on
the individual's chances of surviving to reproduce in the
future (and the effort that can be put into reproduction),
and so has been argued to be a physical manifestation of
the costs of reproduction (e.g. [7-9]). It has also been suggested that mass loss may instead be a means of reducing
the costs of flight [6,10] (leading to an increase in the
amount of food available to the offspring), and hence
does not necessarily reflect a cost of reproduction.
Experimental studies attempt to alter some aspect of the
parent's workload or reaction to its environment – by, for
example, manipulating clutch size (e.g. [11]), length of
the breeding season (e.g. [12]), age of the chicks in the
nest (e.g. [13]), clipping parental flight feathers (e.g.
[14]), or giving the parents or chicks supplemental food
(e.g. [8,15]). However, little consensus seems to exist in
these studies as to the functional reasons for mass loss,
and how the patterns of loss resulting from the manipulations are determined [16]. The effects of the manipulation
on the mass changes in the parents are typically assessed
by measuring the mass of the parents at set points during
the period (such as just before the manipulation, and at
the end of the chick rearing period), relative to a control.
A manipulation will affect the immediate effort a parent
makes. It will also affect the offspring, either directly or
indirectly. The resulting changes in the investment of a

The basic model of optimal mass loss
The following model describes the pattern of mass loss
shown over a set period of the reproductive cycle. We consider the period to start at the point when the parent alters
its routine in order to devote a significant portion of its
time and energy to the current reproductive attempt. (The
moment at which the routine changes could be defined in
many species as the point at which incubation starts,
whilst in birds that migrate to a distant breeding site (such
as geese and ducks), it could be the point at which pre-laying feeding ends). The end of the period of interest is
taken to be the point in time at which intensive offspring
care ends (such as fledging, or the cessation of provisioning). The model assumes that the parent starts the period
of interest at mass x0, and has achieved a mass x by the end
of the period.

The lifetime reproductive success of the parent is considered to be the sum of two components, the current and
the future reproductive success [17]. Here, the current
reproductive success is taken to be dependent upon the
survival of the current brood of chicks through to reproduction, and the future reproductive success of the parent
is dependent upon its ability to reproduce in subsequent
breeding periods (note that a parent could engage in several consecutive breeding periods within a season). We
now describe how these components of fitness are
dependent upon initial and final reserve levels (note that
when we refer to 'fitness' below, we are referring to the
lifetime reproductive success of the parent: therefore,
there are current and future components to its fitness).
We assume that the greater the amount of mass lost by the
parent at a given decision step, then the greater the benefit
to the chicks: their reserves will increase, and therefore so
will factors such as the probability of surviving a period of
bad foraging, or the amount of energy available for
growth. (It may seem naïve to assume that an extremely
large amount of mass lost by the parents will be extremely
beneficial to the chicks, but note that we are considering a
simplified form of the current fitness component here – at
the same time, losing an extreme amount of mass is going
to be highly detrimental to the parent's own survival, and
is manifest through its future fitness component.) Thus,
the resulting gain from the current breeding attempt is an
increasing function of the mass loss L = x0 - x, and is

occurring somewhere between maximum and minimum
mass. Here, we consider the relationship to have a single
maximum value. It should be noted however that for
most of the arguments presented here, the p(x) function
need not have a intermediate value at which it is maximised – it can be modelled simply as an increasing and
decelerating function of final mass (i.e. p' > 0, p" < 0).

The parent's total fitness is considered to be the sum of
current and future reproductive success. It follows that the
optimal final mass x* should maximise p(x) + b(x0 - x).
Differentiating with respect to final mass, it follows that
x* satisfies
p' - b' = 0.

This sketch (not to scale) demonstrates that the degree of
mass lost to reach the optimal mass x* is greater than the
loss necessary to reach the optimal parental mass xpers. Note
that the shapes of the current fitness component, b(L), and
the future fitness component, p(L), are arbitrarily drawn as a
linear and a quadratic function here.

Because b(x0 - x) is defined as an increasing function of L
= x0 - x, then b'(x0-x*) is positive. From (1), this means that
p'(x*) is positive, and hence x* < xpers. Therefore, the final
mass at which a breeding parent's lifetime reproductive
success is maximised is less than the mass at which the
future reproductive component is maximised (this is
sketched in Fig. 2).
Implicit differentiation of Equation (1) with respect to

denoted by b(L). Note that we ignore any effects on the
chicks of the final parental mass (such as mass-dependent
flight costs): see the appendix for a more general case that
could include these effects.
Assuming that the fitness component from the chicks is
not influenced by the mass of the parent, we could model
the changes as shown in Fig. 1. With an increase in mass
lost, the fitness return from the chicks increases. As the figure shows, if a parent starts off with large reserves
('heavy'), then as it approaches a set weight (such as the
mass at which the parent's future reproductive success is
optimised, which is defined below as xpers), then it will
have lost more mass than an individual that started off
'light' (with low reserves), and therefore its current fitness
will have reached a greater value.
We take the future reproductive success of the parent to be
the success of the parent in future breeding seasons (we
assume that the parent survives through the current reproductive period). This is considered to be solely dependent
upon the final mass of the parent, and is denoted p(x).
Consider the effects of reserve size on the future reproductive success of the parent, without considering the effects
of these reserves on the chicks. The optimal parental mass,
xpers, represents a trade-off between starvation at low
energy reserve levels and greater predation risk and metabolic costs at high reserve levels [18-21]. As a consequence, it can be expected that the fitness function for
parental mass should be a curve with an optimal mass

where the derivatives are evaluated at x*. From Equation

dx*/dx0 < 0; and if b" is negative, then dx*/dx0 > 0.

Because p" < 0, this tells us that a parent's optimal mass
loss is an increasing function of initial reserves: parents
that start with larger reserves should lose more mass overall than parents that start with lower reserves.

that the optimal final mass of initially light parents is
lower than that of heavier parents, despite the heavier parents losing more mass, as shown by Equation (3).

during the period, L, and sketches the three cases defined in
the text (case 1: constant slope; case 2: decreasing slope; case
3: increasing slope).

The effect of the current fitness component
The exact shape of b(x0 - x), the current fitness component,
has a great effect upon the predictions we can make about
optimal mass loss in the parent. Calculating the exact benefit of mass loss (in terms of fitness) to the parent is complicated by the fact that its effects upon chick survivorship
and future reproductive success are not direct. Mass loss
provides extra energy to the chick [22], but the resulting
value of this energy to the chick (and hence its fitness)
needs to be considered as well: for example, a small
amount of food may have a greater impact on the survival
of a young chick in comparison to an older chick. Here,
we consider some simple shapes for the current fitness
component (sketched in Fig. 3), where fitness is assumed
to be a monotonic increasing function of chick reserves:

i. constant slope (i.e. b" = 0). Gain in current fitness per
unit of mass lost is constant. From Equation (2), it follows
that optimal final parental mass should be constant
regardless of initial mass, and so all parents should ideally
be the same mass at the end of the period.
A non-constant slope could occur because the fitness of an
offspring may not be proportional to its intake (cf.
[23,24]) or because offspring intake is not proportional to
mass lost by a parent.
ii. decreasing slope (decelerating, i.e. b" < 0). Here,
although current fitness increases with increasing mass
loss by the parent, the increase in fitness per unit of mass
lost decreases as more mass is lost. This might be a consequence of a decrease in the ability of chicks to utilise

iii. increasing slope (accelerating, i.e. b" > 0). Here, the
increase in fitness per unit of mass lost increases as more
mass is lost. This could be the case with chicks that have
few stored energy reserves to rely upon, because the probability of avoiding starvation might be an accelerating
function of energy intake when reserves are low (e.g.
[23,24]). Considering initially heavy and light parents,
Equation (2) indicates that in this case initially heavy parents should finish lighter than parents that start the breeding season with small reserves.
As could be expected, the parents with the largest reserves
should lose the greatest amount of mass. However, as
demonstrated here, the final mass of the parent depends
not only on its own initial reserve level, but also on the
shape of the offspring fitness function (Fig. 3). If this function has a decreasing slope (case ii), then patterns are as
would perhaps be expected intuitively: parents that start
heavy will remain heavier than initially lighter parents.
Counter-intuitively, the reverse of this pattern is seen if
the offspring fitness function has an increasing slope (case
iii), initially heavier parents end up lighter than initially
light parents (Fig. 4).
This is simply considering what happens when the chick
reproductive success component is directly related to mass
lost. We also need to consider the effects of this loss upon
the parent: similar amounts of mass loss by heavy and
light parents may result in them having very different
flight costs, which could lead to further differences in the
current reproductive success. Therefore, changes in flight
costs would also have to be considered (see the appendix
for a more general case where current reproductive success
is related to both mass loss and final mass). Similarly, factors such as the distance travelled by the parent [22] may
be important in determining the form of the parent's current reproductive success.

Discussion
In this paper, we have described a simple model that considers mass changes in breeding birds from an adaptive
perspective. The model shows that it is vital to have a clear
understanding of the effects that a manipulation or environmental change has upon both the current and future
reproductive success of a parent, before we can state
whether an observed change in the mass of the parent
reflects an optimal response to the manipulation. We
have extended the established concept that mass loss may
be adaptive [6,10]. We show that the shapes of functions

itself and its chicks can have subtle and counter-intuitive
implications upon the patterns of loss we would see in
individuals (and differences between the shapes of these
functions between individuals could depend upon factors
such as the age of the chicks, or individual differences
between parents). Particularly, we show that it is difficult
to predict the degree of mass lost by a parent with a given
initial amount of energy, without giving careful consideration to both components of its fitness. In experimental
studies, cases have been seen where initially heavier parents lose more mass than light parents (e.g. [25,26]). The
model described here suggests that these patterns can have
biological significance if the shape of the offspring fitness
function is taken into consideration: for example, by considering an accelerating curve to the future fitness component as we describe here in case iii. It should be noted here
that although we are suggesting that these patterns of
mass loss can by justified biologically, care should be
taken to ensure that an observed difference between individuals is not just a statistical artefact arising from estimating mass changes through regression (examples are
discussed by [27,28], but see [29]). Statistical artefacts of
this form are well known in other disciplines, and it is
possible to avoid them with correctly designed and controlled experiments [30].

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/3/1/20

The shape of the current fitness component function may
change with chick age. The main energetic expenditure of
a young chick is invested in growth, and it may be the case
that growth is accelerated when chick reserves are higher,
which could suggest an increasing and accelerating offspring function. It may be less advantageous for older
chicks to have high energy reserves (such as in species
showing weight recession – see [31]), because chicks
approaching fledging will have to face similar body mass
trade-offs to an adult. An increasing and decelerating
function may therefore be more appropriate in the case of
older chicks. Therefore, it may be that the shape of the offspring fitness function changes with the age and requirements of the chicks, and so the predictions we can make
are crucially dependent upon the shapes of the fitness
curves (Winkler [32] also argues that the shapes of parental investment curves are important, and for a similar concept used in the discussion of food sharing and natal
dispersal, see [33]). Similarly, in many passerine and nonpasserine species where clutch sizes are greater than one,
competition between siblings [34] may alter the forms of
the fitness curves.
The exact shapes of the current fitness function (sketched
in Fig. 3) are open to debate, since there is a lack of experimental evidence to suggest that one form should be
favoured over the others in specific systems – in particular,
the linear function (case i) states that all parents should
end up at the same value, which is arguably unrealistic
biologically, but which gives a useful null hypothesis to
frame the results of our non-linear functions against. So
how do we estimate the shape of this function? We could
try to make inferences from related experimental work
concerning the growth of chicks. We know for example
that larger or heavier chicks tend to have a higher chance
of surviving to reproduce [35]. Similarly, we know that if
chicks are exposed to different food intakes during their
development, this can affect their growth rate [36], which
may in turn have effects upon their fitness [35,37]. Furthermore, we have a good understanding of the physiological constraints involved in avian development, and
how this may affect the optimal growth rates of different
species [38-40], which in turn gives us information about
the maximum amount of investment a parent can give to
a chick [41]. However, this information does not explicitly give us an obvious relationship between the amount
of mass a parent loses, and the resulting increase in the
survival of its chicks. This is something that still needs to
be experimentally determined, preferably using techniques that will affect the survival of the chicks without
potentially affecting the response of the parent (and therefore the shape of its future fitness curve, which will lead to
knock-on effects regarding the optimal degree of mass to
lose). This means that popular techniques such as clutch
size manipulation [42-45], which definitely affect the

Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling 2006, 3:20

work-load of the parent (and hence its future fitness), are
not suitable for determining the shape of the current fitness component unless one can find a means of deconfounding the changes the manipulation imposes upon
both the future and current fitness values.
Our model involves various simplifications, and we do
not explain why parents differ in their initial reserves. This
might result from some underlying difference in individual quality, or could happen through chance alone, such
as a period of bad luck in finding food (or, in the case of
some empirical studies, may be due to initial non-random
allocation of individuals to differing experimental treatments). The timing of breeding within the season may
also be important, as both chick and parental survival
through to a subsequent breeding season will be affected
by the date at which the chicks fledge. The timing of
breeding is therefore likely to have an effect upon the optimal parental mass xpers, and individuals breeding earlier in
the season should have differing fitness functions to those
breeding later. Furthermore, the model described here
considers an individual that does not die during the current reproductive attempt, and that only makes a single
decision about the amount of mass it should choose to
lose. Relaxing this or any of the other assumptions
described would complicate the models further, and
essentially confuse any predictions we could make about
loss.
The model discussed is suitable for explaining loss in central-place foraging passerines and other altricial birds,
where parents show most of their loss during the period
when they are foraging for the chicks. A different patterns
of loss is seen in birds with precocial development [3]. In
most of these, one of the parents (usually the female)
shows the greatest loss of mass during incubation, when
the nest has to be tended constantly to keep the eggs warm
and guard them from predators. On hatching, the chicks
have some degree of independence, and the parents are
able to forage to supplement their own reserves. This great
difference in allocation strategies has led to a divide in the
theoretical treatment of reserve allocation, where workers
on mostly-altricial taxa have pursued very different lines
to those working in mostly-precocial taxa, such as the
wildfowl, where a much greater emphasis is placed upon
'capital' and 'income' strategies of investment [46]. We
argue that the model developed here is flexible enough to
be applied to precocial species, because it is still necessary
to consider the consequences of the parent's behaviour
upon the fitness of both it and the offspring. For example,
for species that don't feed (or forage very little) during
incubation, such as common eiders Somateria mollissima
[47], it could be argued that the longer a parent stays on
the nest, the faster the development of the embryos is
going to be, and so offspring fitness will be an increasing

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/3/1/20

function of mass lost (see [48] for discussion and references). Furthermore, where the parent is not able to feed
(through both the demands of incubation, and the lack of
food within or near the incubation environment), it is
likely that energy reserve usage has a much greater effect
upon its survival and future reproductive success. The parent's own future fitness is also affected by the amount it
loses, and could perhaps be approximated to an increasing function of final mass (so a parent will benefit from
losing as little mass as possible when it is at the breeding
site), rather than a curve with an intermediate maximum
value, as discussed in the model. If we were to consider a
linear decrease in future fitness using the model we
describe here, we are stating that a parent behaving to
maximise its future fitness should lose no mass, such that
xpers = x0 (we assume that the parent is unable to gain mass
when incubating, as it does not leave the nest to feed).
From Equation (1), we have shown that x* < xpers, and so
the optimal final mass of an incubating precocial species
such as the common eider will be less than its initial mass,
where again the shape of the current fitness function will
be important in determining the amounts of mass lost by
individuals of differing qualities. Field studies have
shown that the final mass of incubating parents in precocial species can be highly dependent upon initial mass,
with initially heavy parents ending as the heavier individuals (e.g. [45,47]). This suggests that species such as common eiders may have a type ii current fitness curve.
However, it could instead be argued that in precocial species nesting in harsh environments, the window of time in
which egg-laying can occur and the massive reduction in
activity during incubation mean that the time spent incubating and the rate of energy expenditure during this
period are practically independent of mass – with this
independence, we would therefore expect all birds to lose
approximately the same amount of mass, meaning that
initially heavy birds will still remain the heaviest. In precocial species, it is also likely that the shape of the parent's
curve is more complex than discussed in the model, and
could change with season, availability of food in the environment, predation risk, and so forth. An understanding
of these functions could give an insight into the decisions
made by the precocial parent – such as when and how frequent recesses away from the nest should be, and when
the parent should abandon its offspring and ensure its
own survival.

Conclusion
Therefore, the model we present here is a first step towards
producing a life-history model that would include temporal changes in the two fitness components in relation to
chick age and time of breeding. In order to test the predictions of this current model, we would require fieldworkers
to quantify both current and future reproductive success
in order to assess how the shape of these functions deter-

mines the mass changes within their species. This is arguably difficult, complex, and likely to be extremely
sensitive to environmental variation. In the meantime, we
could instead look towards studies that accurately quantify the changes in mass within individuals at set stages in
the breeding cycle [2], and address how individual variation in the survival and mass of both parents and chicks
affects fitness. Given the added complexities of considering temporal changes throughout the breeding cycle and
season, this is something that would then ideally be modelled using a state-dependent approach, such as through
dynamic programming [24,49]. Here we could then consider parents as making multiple consecutive decisions
about how much of their reserves they should allocate to
both themselves and their offspring.
