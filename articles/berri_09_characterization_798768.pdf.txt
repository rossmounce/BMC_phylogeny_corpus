Abstract
Background: The WRKY transcription factor gene family has a very ancient origin and has
undergone extensive duplications in the plant kingdom. Several studies have pointed out their
involvement in a range of biological processes, revealing that a large number of WRKY genes are
transcriptionally regulated under conditions of biotic and/or abiotic stress. To investigate the
existence of WRKY co-regulatory networks in plants, a whole gene family WRKYs expression study
was carried out in rice (Oryza sativa). This analysis was extended to Arabidopsis thaliana taking
advantage of an extensive repository of gene expression data.
Results: The presented results suggested that 24 members of the rice WRKY gene family (22% of
the total) were differentially-regulated in response to at least one of the stress conditions tested.
We defined the existence of nine OsWRKY gene clusters comprising both phylogenetically related
and unrelated genes that were significantly co-expressed, suggesting that specific sets of WRKY
genes might act in co-regulatory networks. This hypothesis was tested by Pearson Correlation
Coefficient analysis of the Arabidopsis WRKY gene family in a large set of Affymetrix microarray
experiments. AtWRKYs were found to belong to two main co-regulatory networks (COR-A, CORB) and two smaller ones (COR-C and COR-D), all including genes belonging to distinct
phylogenetic groups. The COR-A network contained several AtWRKY genes known to be involved
mostly in response to pathogens, whose physical and/or genetic interaction was experimentally
proven. We also showed that specific co-regulatory networks were conserved between the two
model species by identifying Arabidopsis orthologs of the co-expressed OsWRKY genes.

Conclusion: In this work we identified sets of co-expressed WRKY genes in both rice and
Arabidopsis that are functionally likely to cooperate in the same signal transduction pathways. We
propose that, making use of data from co-regulatory networks, it is possible to highlight novel
clusters of plant genes contributing to the same biological processes or signal transduction
pathways. Our approach will contribute to unveil gene cooperation pathways not yet identified by
classical genetic analyses. This information will open new routes contributing to the dissection of
WRKY signal transduction pathways in plants.

Background
WRKY genes code for transcription factors characterized
by the presence of one or two 60 amino-acid WRKY motif
including a very highly-conserved WRKYGQK sequence
together with a zinc-finger-like motif CX4-7 -CX23-28 -HX1-2
-(H/C) that provides binding properties to DNA. Most of
the WRKY proteins bind to the conserved W-box (C/
T)TGAC(T/C) [1-4]. The WRKY genes were initially
believed to be plant-specfic [5], but their ancient origin, is
witnessed by the presence of two-domain WRKY in two
non-photosynthetic unicellular Eukaryota organisms: in
the Diplomonadida Giardia lamblia and in the Mycetozoa
Dictyostelium discoideum. An ancestor WRKY gene may,
therefore, have already been present before divergence of
animals, fungi and plants, but was probably lost in the
former groups [6]. The WRKY genes have experienced an
incredible evolutionary success in the plant kingdom
where successive duplication events have resulted in large
gene families that includes up to 74 members in Arabidopsis and over one hundred in rice. The first record of a
WRKY gene [7] came from cloning genes from sweet
potato (Ipomoea batatas) followed by the description of
two WRKY genes (ABF1 and ABF2) in wheat, barley and
wild oat [8]. Eulgem et al. [9] described most of the Arabidopsis WRKY genes and classified them on the basis of
both the number of WRKY domains and the features of
their zinc-finger-like motif. WRKY proteins with two
WRKY domains belong to group 1, whereas most proteins
with one WRKY domain belong to group 2. In general, the
WRKY domains of group 1 and group 2 members have the
same type of zinc finger motif, whose pattern of potential
zinc ligands CX4-5 -CX22-23 -HXH is unique among all
known zinc-finger-like motifs. The single zinc finger motif
of a small subset of WRKY proteins is distinct from that of
group 1 and 2 members. Instead of a C2H2 pattern, their
WRKY domains contain a C2HC motif. As a result of this
distinction, they were assigned to group 3 [9].
Several studies have shown that WRKY genes are involved
in many different biological processes such as response to
wounding [10], senescence [4,11], development [12] dormancy and drought tolerance [13], solar ultraviolet-B
radiation [14], metabolism [15,16], hormone signalling
pathways [17,18] and cold [19]. However, numerous
WRKY genes are involved in response to biotic stress and

pathogen attacks. The first evidence for this was shown by
Rushton et al. [20] who found three WRKY genes that specifically were able to bind to three W-box in the promoter
of the pathogenesis-related gene PR1 in parsley. Later
studies showed the involvement of other WRKY genes in
response to pathogen, either because they are regulated
during infection [3,21-24] or due to their proximity to
well characterized genes that play a crucial role in plant
defence, such as NPR1 in Arabidopsis [2,25].
Although there are several publications describing WRKY
genes, only a few of the respective mutants show a clear
link between a WRKY gene and an altered phenotype. In
Arabidopsis, the gene TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA2
(TTG2) encodes a WRKY transcription factor (AtWRKY44)
that, when mutated, causes disruptions to trichome development, different seed coat colour and mucilage production [12]. A second WRKY transcription factor of
Arabidopsis is involved in seed development (AtWRKY10,
encoded by MINISEED3 [26]); the corresponding
mutants show smaller seeds and early cellularization of
the endosperm. Despite the availability of insertion
mutants for nearly every gene in Arabidopsis [27], a
reverse genetic approach has so far only succeeded in
revealing pathogen-related phenotypes for a few WRKY
genes; the observed phenotypes were often weak or
described as "enhanced susceptibility" [28,29]. Typically,
phenotypes become detectable by combining mutants in
multiple WRKY genes or by over-expression analyses [25].
There are a few exceptions: the atypical gene AtWRKY52
that provides resistance to Ralstonia solanacearum [30],
AtWRKY70 whose mutant shows enhanced susceptibility
to Erysiphe cichoracearum and differential accumulation of
anthocyanins following methyl jasmonate application
[31,32]. Similarly, mutation of AtWRKY33 results in
enhanced susceptibility to two necrotrophic pathogens,
namely Botrytis cinerea and Alternaria brassicola [33]. For
20 WRKY insertion mutants in rice screened in our laboratory (data unpublished) no phenotypic variation was
observed for host and non-host pathogen interaction.
The most frequent hypothesis to explain the lack of phenotype in knockout plants is functional redundancy
[25,28]. Indeed, lines in which multiple WRKY genes were
knocked out, are often produced to test whether a small

group of phylogenetically-related genes are redundantly
involved in a certain function. It is, therefore, important
to clearly understand the phylogenetic relationships
between genes of the same family. This has been extensively performed for WRKY genes both in rice and Arabidopsis [9,34,35]. This strategy has been successful in some
cases [22,28], but it is still insufficient to pinpoint genes
that might be part of the same regulatory network.
Another possible explanation for the lack of a clear association between WRKY genes and a specific phenotype
was proposed by Ülker and Somssich [6] who demonstrated that in parsley several WRKY transcription factors,
by binding to W-box in the same promoter, are involved
in regulating expression of one or more target genes. To
understand the function of a single WRKY gene it is crucial
to identify all the genes participating in the associated regulatory network. In the first attempt to unveil the network
of WRKY genes involved in pathogen response using a
microarray approach, Wang et al. [29] identified five
WRKY genes (belonging to three different phylogenetic
subgroups) involved in systemic acquired resistance.
To identify the OsWRKY genes involved in response to
Magnaporthe infection and osmotic stress, and to ascertain
the existence of co-expression gene clusters, a custom
WRKY specific oligo array was designed. Hybridisation
results highlighted the involvement of OsWRKY genes
that were differentially regulated in conditions of biotic
and/or osmotic stress. Some of these genes were coexpressed, suggesting a possible co-regulation in the same
signal transduction pathways. We also performed a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) analysis using public
Arabidopsis Affymetrix expression data, which is the largest and most reliable transcriptome dataset available. Two
main co-regulatory networks were identified, one of
which contains many of the AtWRKY genes known to be
involved in response to pathogens. The different sets of
co-expressed WRKY genes described in rice and Arabidopsis contained a significant number of phylogenetically distantly-related genes. The power of the described approach
was validated by the Pearson Correlation analysis of the
MADS-BOX genes which correctly identified most members shown to belong to the major network controlling
floral patterning and differentiation. Our results revealed
the usefulness of characterizing co-regulatory networks to
identify potential novel candidate genes cooperating in
the same biological processes or signal transduction pathways. These candidates will, then, need to be experimentally tested at the functional level.

Results
WRKY proteins have been previously studied in a wide
range of plant species [5,8,16,19,36] and shown to be
involved in the regulation of several cellular processes,
such as control of metabolic pathways, drought, heat

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/120

shock, senescence, development and hormone signalling.
However, the most studied role of this gene family
appears to be in response to biotic and abiotic stress stimuli. The main goal of the work presented here was to perform a whole gene family transcription analysis of the rice
and Arabidopsis WRKYs to identify those that are coexpressed in biotic and abiotic stress responses and that
are potentially part of common signal transduction coregulatory networks.
Phylogenetic analyses of rice WRKY gene family
One hundred and four WRKY genes were identified in the
rice genome by searching TIGR release 5 database using
the PFAM ID PF03106 and Genbank using tblastn with
the consensus WRKY domain as the query sequence (see
Methods). Manual inspection of the results obtained was
performed to eliminate duplicated entries [see Additional
file 1]. Phylogenetic analysis performed with the Maximum Likelihood method using all 104 proteins containing a single or double WRKY domain, divided the genes
into 5 main phylogenetic groups (Figure 1). Additional
sub-groups and smaller clades were identified within each
group, based upon bootstrap values. The OsWRKY genes
containing two domains (see OsWRKY names ending
with N and C) represented two distinct clades of the same
phylogenetic main group (see Figure 1). Bootstrap values
of some nodes of the tree were found to be moderately
low; this finding in the global OsWRKY analysis was not
completely unexpected due to the low degree of conservation, short length of the WRKY domain and to the large
size of the OsWRKY gene family. To attempt to improve
the bootstrap values it would be necessary to align longer
sequence stretches, but this approach would not be of
help for WRKY genes as, outside the WRKY domain,
amino acid sequences are poorly conserved.

To reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of WRKY
genes in rice and Arabidopsis, a phylogenetic tree was
built using all of the WRKY domain sequences from the
two species. Our analysis is in good agreement with the
classification reported by Eugelm et al. [9] in Arabidopsis
[see Additional file 2]. The Os-AtWRKY tree obtained in
this study suggests a further division of group 3 into three
distinct sub-groups: 3A, 3B, 3C [see Additional file 2].
More precisely, the presence of a sub-group containing
only Arabidopsis WRKY genes (3A) was observed, a second one including only OsWRKY genes (named 3C) and
a third one (3B) containing the remaining genes. This partition is likely to be the consequence of a series of speciesspecific duplication events in the OsWRKY 3 group, which
occurred after the separation of Monocotyledons from
Dicotyledons [35] and that are well documented in rice
[18,37]. These events led to the great expansion of the rice
WRKY group 3, to a total of 36 genes which represent 35%
of the OsWRKY gene family.

Rice WRKY whole gene family transcriptome analysis
A custom 60-mer oligo array (OsWRKYARRAY) was developed for rice WRKY gene family transcriptome analysis.
This array contained the complete set of OsWRKY genespecific probes based upon the hundred and four known

genomic sequences [see Additional file 3]. RNA samples
isolated from leaves and roots of two week-old rice plants
following biotic or abiotic stress treatments were used for
hybridisation on the OsWRKYARRAY. The expression of
the 104 OsWRKY genes was assessed in the following con-

ditions: 1) upon inoculation of leaves with one Magnaporthe oryzae isolate from rice, FR13, and two non-rice
Magnaporthe isolates, M. oryzae BR32 from wheat and M.
grisea BR29 from crabgrass; 2) upon application of
osmotic stress in hydroponic conditions. Considering that
fungal appressoria take about 16 hours to penetrate a rice
leaf epidermal cell [38], leaf samples were collected 24
hours post inoculation (hpi) with the three Magnaporthe
strains. The aim of this experiment was to assess early rice
responses to fungal infection. RNA purified for these
experiments came from the same batch of rice plants used
for the cytological and molecular characterization of riceMagnaporthe interactions described in Faivre-Rampant et
al. [39]. For the study of OsWRKY gene expression upon
osmotic stress conditions, samples were collected 1 hour
(roots) and 5 hours (leaves and roots) after osmotic treatment. Gene expression results obtained from OsWRKYARRAY hybridisation experiments are reported in Table
1 and Figure 2. OsWRKY genes were considered to be up
or down regulated when the logarithm values of the ratio
of expression levels between treated and control RNA
were higher than 0.2 or lower than -0.2 with the associated corrected P-value < 0.05. The analysis of differentially
expressed OsWRKY genes revealed that 24 (22% of the
total) were differentially regulated (down or up) in at least
one of the six tested stress conditions (Table 1). Interestingly, among these 24 rice WRKY genes, gene expression
of
eight
(OsWRKY4,
OsWRKY18,
OsWRKY61,
OsWRKY19, OsWRKY37, OsWRKY112, OsWRKY43 and
OsWRKY100) changed in response to both biotic and
osmotic stress stimuli (in bold in Table 1). A few genes
appeared to be differentially regulated only in a limited
number of stress conditions, such as OsWRKY110,
OsWRKY87, OsWRKY27, OsWRKY64 (see blue dots in
Figure 2). OsWRKY110 was induced by FR13 infection,
but repressed upon osmotic stress in leaves. OsWRKY87
was up regulated by BR32, whereas it was down regulated
at late stage in both osmotic-stressed roots and leaves.
OsWRKY27 is up regulated by BR29 and upon osmotic
stress, but only in roots at 1 hpi. Finally OsWRKY64 was
repressed by BR32 and induced only in roots by osmotic
stimuli at an early stage. In addition, four genes
OsWRKY6, OsWRKY115, OsWRKY69 and OsWRKY31
were differentially-regulated only in one stress condition
(see yellow dots in Figure 2).
Clustering analysis of the data obtained with the OsWRKYARRAY was performed to pinpoint genes with similar
expression profiles between different stress conditions.
This analysis highlighted the following points (see red
boxes in Figure 2):
i) three clusters of genes co-expressed in all test conditions
for biotic and osmotic stress. In cluster A (OsWRKY4,
OsWRKY18, OsWRKY61) and B (OsWRKY19, OsWRKY37,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/120

OsWRKY112) genes are up regulated after infection with
all 3 Magnaporthe strains, but repressed upon osmotic
stress treatment, in leaves and in roots. In contrast, in the
small cluster C, genes OsWRKY100 and OsWRKY43 are
down regulated after Magnaporthe interactions, but
induced in roots and leaves after osmotic stress stimuli.
ii) three clusters of genes differentially expressed specifically upon one Magnaporthe interaction. Genes
OsWRKY48, OsWRKY86 and OsWRKY40 (Cluster D) are
induced after infection with M. oryzae BR32, while
OsWRKY71 and OsWRKY79 (Cluster E) with M. grisea
BR29. The remaining cluster F includes OsWRKY38,
OsWRKY11 and OsWRKY53 genes, which are down regulated by Magnaporthe oryzae strain FR13.
To broaden the WRKY gene family expression profile
obtained with the OsWRKYARRAY, WRKY expression
data from the 22 K NIAS array (National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences) were extracted to highlight those
genes that are co-expressed in a wider range of abiotic
stress conditions, as well as at different developmental
stages (shoot, meristem, panicle). Since in the 22 K NIAS
array, only a subset of 50 WRKY genes is present (out of
104 of the whole gene family), a separate clustering analysis was performed (Figure 3). The gene expression data
analysis was carried out using the same rationale as was
applied to the OsWRKYARRAY (logarithm values of the
ratio higher than 0.2 or lower than -0.2 and associated
corrected P-value < 0.05). The 22 K NIAS gene expression
data confirmed the correlation between OsWRKY18 and
OsWRKY4 (see cluster A in Fig 2), and extended the clustering to the OsWRKY22, OsWRKY100, OsWRKY53,
OsWRKY78 and OsWRKY84 genes (see Cluster I in Figure
3). These seven OsWRKY genes were found to be coexpressed in most conditions tested (e.g. flooding,
drought and cold treatments) and in different plant
organs (root, meristem, callus, panicle). This analysis
revealed two additional clusters of co-expressed OsWRKY
genes that were not identified by the OsWRKYARRAY
analysis. Genes in cluster G, OsWRKY24, OsWRKY8,
OsWRKY42 and OsWRKY3 are co-expressed in cold and
drought conditions. Cluster H is constituted by the two
genes OsWRKY96 and OsWRKY50, which have similar
regulation profiles in flooding, cold and drought conditions.
Our findings are partially supported by previous comprehensive gene expression analysis of OsWRKY genes
[23,40]. Ryu et al. [23], analysed the OsWRKY gene expression after infection with different pathogens (Magnaporthe
strains and Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae) and treatment
with hormone signalling molecules. Overall, between the
two studies there is agreement for fifty percent of the genes
identified as being differentially expressed upon Mag-

naporthe infection. It is important to stress that the cultivars (indica vs japonica varieties), pathogen strains, and
plant-pathogen interactions (virulent/avirulent vs compatible/multi-avirulent/non host) used in the two studies
were different, making difficult a direct comparison of the
obtained gene expression results. The WRKY genes found
to be induced only in one of the studies may reflect the
existence of different responses to pathogen attacks and/
or adaptation to different environmental conditions;
these data may be pertinent to define the evolutionary history between different rice cultivars and their responses to
the same pathogens. In a recent work [40], the OsWRKY
gene family was analysed under different abiotic and phytohormone treatments and the authors showed that several OsWRKY genes were co-expressed at the tested
conditions (cold, salt, drought, phytohormones). Interestingly,
OsWRKY4,
OsWRKY43,
OsWRKY61,
OsWRKY53, OsWRKY63 and OsWRKY100 were found to
be co-regulated upon different abiotic stress conditions, as
well as in our experiments.
Comparing phylogenetic relationships and microarraybased gene expression clusters it was observed that the following pairs of closely related genes (OsWRKY18 and
OsWRKY4 in cluster A, OsWRKY71 and OsWRKY79 in
cluster E, OsWRKY100 and OsWRKY53 in cluster I) were

co-expressed, reflecting recent duplications and potentially functional redundancy (see Figure 1). However,
seven out of the nine identified clusters of co-expressed
OsWRKYs contained sets of genes clearly belonging to different phylogenetic groups (see Figure 1). These findings
suggest the existence of "complex networks" of OsWRKY
genes contributing to orchestrate specific signal transduction pathways.
Validation of OsWRKYARRAY by quantitative RT-PCR
To validate the results obtained with the OsWRKYARRAY,
quantitative RT-PCR analysis (Q-PCR) of 58% (14 out of
24) of the differentially expressed rice WRKY genes was
performed (13% of the whole gene family), to confirm
their level of expression in leaves after Magnaporthe infection and osmotic stress treatment. The following fourteen
genes were chosen for Q-PCR assays: OsWRKY18,
OsWRKY4, OsWRKY61, OsWRKY112, OsWRKY100,
OsWRKY43, OsWRKY40, OsWRKY71, OsWRKY101,
OsWRKY63, OsWRKY53, OsWRKY87, OsWRKY64 and
OsWRKY115. Quantitative expression of these genes was
measured in samples obtained from new independent
experiments carried out at the same conditions as were
used to obtain RNA samples for the OsWRKYARRAY transcriptome analysis. RNA was extracted from leaves 24
hours after inoculation with the same three fungal strains

M. grisea BR29 from crabgrass and upon application of osmotic stress (mannitol) in hydroponic conditions. Panel A T-test Pvalues (shown by a green - black gradient) of treated vs control of the corresponding ratios shown in Panel B. The range of log

that were used for the microarray experiments (Magnaporthe BR29, BR32 and FR13) and 5 hours post osmotic
treatment, respectively. Results of the Q-PCR experiments
from the four test conditions (three biological replicates/
treatment) are reported in Table 2 and showed that eleven
out of the fourteen tested genes (80%) were confirmed as
differentially expressed with the associated P-value < 0.05.
The Q-PCR data of three genes (OsWRKY43, OsWRKY101
and OsWRKY115) were not in agreement with those
obtained in the microarray analysis. In conclusion, QPCR analyses confirmed the robustness of microarray
results and validated our hypothesis of the existence of coexpressed cluster of OsWRKY genes. In particular, Q-PCR
results confirmed that OsWRKY4, OsWRKY18 and
OsWRKY61 (see cluster A in Figure 2) have very similar
expression profiles, in agreement with the existence of
OsWRKYs co-regulatory networks. Based upon these data,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/120

we decided to characterize in detail the occurrence of
WRKY networks in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.
WRKY co-regulatory networks
The integrated transcriptome results indicated that specific clusters of co-expressed rice WRKY genes are involved
in response to a range of applied stress conditions. The
clusters A, E and F comprised mostly OsWRKY genes
belonging to the same phylogenetic groups and often
closely related. These genes are likely to be derived from
recent duplication events and, therefore, as it may be
expected, to share similar expression profiles. On the
other hand, the clusters B, C, D, G and H mainly consisted
of members of distinct phylogenetic groups. The largest
cluster (I) included both distantly-related and closelyrelated OsWRKY genes (see Figure 1).

To further investigate clusters of co-expressed WRKY genes
in plants, data were collected from 2,000 Arabidopsis
Affymetrix microarray experiments and correlation analysis based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)
was carried out; scatterplots of individual gene pairs were

obtained, as previously described by Toufighi et al. 2005
[41]. A scatter plot of the results obtained with two noncorrelating (AtWRKY35 vs AtWRKY40) and two correlating (AtWRKY33 vs AtWRKY40) genes is presented in Additional file 4. The source and the processing of the gene

Results of quantitative expression for the fourteen OsWRKY genes selected to validate the OsWRKYARRAY results are summarized. The
expression level of each OsWRKY gene was measured in leaf samples infected with three Magnaporthe strains (BR29, BR32, FR13) and after osmotic
stress treatment (see Treatment column). Ma is the log2 value of the ratio of expression levels between treated and control RNA samples
obtained in the OsWRKYARRAY (see Table 1); Mq and st.dev. indicate log2 and standard deviation of ratio treated vs controls obtained by qRTPCR, respectively. P-val indicates the P-value obtained with the statistical T-test. Results with an associated P-value > 0.05 were considered not
significant and therefore are not reported. The "Agreement" column reports agreement among microarray and qRT-PCR results. YES with
agreement in up/down regulation; NO without agreement in up/down regulation; qRT-PCR: indicates genes up/down regulated only in the qRTPCR experiments. NS in the microarray colum indicates genes resulted not significant at the statistical analysis of the microarray data.

expression data were described in detail in Menges et al.
[42], but a new matrix was generated for this study. For
every AtWRKY gene on the At Affymetrix microarray (61
out of the 74 WRKY genes present in the Arabidopsis
genome), we calculated the untransformed PCC value (Plin) with each of the other members of the gene family
[see Additional file 5]. In the logarithm analysis (P-log),
the gene expression data were transformed into logarithmic values before calculating the PCC [see Additional file
6]. We performed both P-lin analysis to pinpoint co-regulatory patterns occurring in only few microarray experiments (e.g. tissue- or condition-specific expression) and
P-log analysis to better define the WRKY co-regulation in
the presence of very different gene expression levels
between the gene pairs under examination. To define the
existence of AtWRKYs co-regulatory networks, values of
Pearson Correlation Coefficient higher or equal to 0.6
were considered as significant both for the topology of the
networks and for the number of represented genes. To validate the PCC threshold value used to obtain AtWRKYs coregulatory networks, PCC analysis of the AtMADS-BOX
gene family was also carried out. As for the topology, the
appropriateness of using the 0.6 threshold value was confirmed by plotting the number of edges and the mean of
edges/gene as a function of the threshold values [see Additional file 7]; this analysis clearly highlighted that, taking
a threshold value of 0.7, the mean number of edges/gene
significantly dropped by 30%, losing important information about the complexity of the network. In addition, by
plotting the number of edges and number of genes as a
function of the threshold values [see Additional file 8], it
was observed that the number of genes is reduced by 30%
in the P-lin and by 39% in the P-log analysis. Moreover,
the number of edges dropped by 59% in the P-lin analysis
and by 70% in the P-log analysis, when the threshold
value was raised from 0.6 to 0.7. As a further supporting
evidence the AtMADS-BOX PCC analysis was performed
at 0.6 and 0.7 threshold value [see Additional file 9 and
10], as this gene family is experimentally well characterized at the molecular and genetic levels. This analysis
revealed that the network of the AtMADS-BOX genes
(involved in floral differentiation) is very robust, with 13
genes in the P-lin analysis with threshold value > 0.6 [see
Additional file 9A] linked by 40 edges, 32 of which are
backed up by molecular evidence for direct interaction
(e.g. two hybrid, co-IP) or for involvement in ternary or
quaternary complexes [43,44]. Moreover, 5 out of the 8
interactions lacking direct molecular evidence involved
SEP2 which is an auto-activator in the two-hybrid assay
and, therefore, could not be tested as bait. Two other separate networks of MADS-BOX genes were identified from
our PCC analysis, which were backed up by molecular or
genetic evidence: one network comprised AGL18, -29, -30,
-65, -66 and -104 implicated in pollen maturation [45]
and the second one AGL67, -68, MAF4, MAF5 and FLF

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/120

involved in flowering transition [46]. The P-lin networks
obtained with threshold value of 0.7 [see Additional file
9B] loses experimentally supported connections such as
AP1 with P1 and AP3/SP3 with SHP1. In addition applying the threshold value of 0.7, SEP4 is absent in the main
AtMADS-BOX network and the MAF5 gene is missing in
the flowering one. The P-log analysis with threshold value
of 0.6 [see Additional file 10A] keeps the same general
topology as the P-lin one, albeit with a slightly reduced
complexity (with 10 genes and 25 edges), whereas results
obtained from the P-log analysis with threshold value of
0.7 [see Additional file 10B] reduces dramatically the
number of genes and networks which are mostly experimentally validated. These data clearly showed that, carrying out the PCC analysis with a threshold value of 0.7, the
number of genes represented in the network decreases significantly, and confirmed the appropriateness of using the
0.6 threshold value.
P-lin analysis of AtWRKY genes revealed the existence of
two major co-regulatory networks (COR-A and COR-B)
and of two additional smaller networks COR-C and CORD (Figure 4A). The P-log analysis confirmed the existence
of the two interconnected COR-A and COR-B clusters
(Figure 4B) while the other two smaller networks were not
present. Taken together, the P-log and P-lin analyses
revealed that more than 70% (45 out of 61) of the Arabidopsis WRKY genes analysed are co-regulated with other
WRKYs [see Additional file 11]. The existence in COR-A of
a sub-cluster constituted of AtWRKY70, AtWRKY38,
AtWRKY46 and AtWRKY54 co-regulated genes in both Plin and P-log analyses, was experimentally proven by
Kalde et al. [22]. In the P-lin analysis the genes
AtWRKY70, AtWRKY38, AtWRKY46 and AtWRKY54 are
clustered together, whereas, AtWRKY30 and AtWRKY55
are apart, although they belong to the same group 3. This
is in agreement with the results by Kalde et al. [22], who
showed that the former four genes are induced by salicylate and pathogens, whereas the latter two are not differentially expressed at the same conditions. Moreover, the
implication of the strongly co-regulated AtWRKY25 and
AtWRKY33 genes (P-lin value 0.74) in the same signal
transduction pathways and the functional redundancy of
AtWRKY11 and AtWRKY17 (P-lin value 0.63) were
reported by Andreasson et al. [47] and Journot-Catalino et
al. [48], respectively. It is noteworthy to highlight that in
the AtWRKY PCC analysis using a threshold value of 0.7
[see Additional file 12], the aforementioned subcluster of
AtWRKY70, AtWRKY38, AtWRKY46 and AtWRKY54 genes
and the connection between AtWRKY11 and AtWRKY17
were lost. As previously mentioned, P-lin analysis allowed
us to highlight the existence of a correlation between two
genes that are expressed in just a few conditions/treatments, while P-log highlights co-regulation between
genes even in the presence of large differences in their

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:120

expression levels. The small networks COR-C and COR-D
were present only in the P-lin analysis (see Figure 4A),
reflecting their co-expression only in few tested experimental conditions (data not shown). AtWRKY3 and
AtWRKY4 genes (COR-D) were found to be specifically
and rapidly induced upon infection with Botrytis cinerea
and the virulent P. syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000
(PstDC3000). As a supporting evidence of their restricted
but correlated role, the wrky3wrky4 double mutant plants
exhibited more severe disease symptoms only following
Botrytis infection [49]. On the other hand, the P-log anal-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/120

ysis (Figure 4B) revealed the co-regulation (P-log value
0.73) of two (AtWRKY18 and AtWRKY40) of the three
WRKY genes belonging to the group 2A, previously shown
to physically interact [28].
In conclusion, our approach is validated by the presence
in the COR-A and COR-B networks of recently duplicated
genes tightly co-regulated not only in silico but also in
vivo. Our work revealed that both COR-A and COR-B networks included significantly co-regulated WRKY genes
belonging to distinct phylogenetic groups (see Figure 4

Figure 4
Co-regulatory networks of Arabidopsis WRKY genes
Co-regulatory networks of Arabidopsis WRKY genes. For each pair of WRKY genes, the Pearson Coefficient was calculated on untransformed values P-lin (see Panel A) and on log-transformed values P-log (see Panel B) to measure the correlation of expression levels, based on 2,000 Arabidopsis microarray experiments. Each pair of correlated WRKY genes (Pearson
Correlation Coefficient value higher than 0.6) are shown in the figure with an edge connecting them. The thickness of the
edges is proportional to the value of the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. Thick black line: Pearson Correlation Coefficient
0.96; Thin black line: Pearson Correlation Coefficient 0.6. Proximity of two genes on the graph is not indicative of their relatedness. The colours indicate different phylogenetic groups. See Additional files 5 and 6 for the specific numeric values of the Plin and P-log correlation coefficient, respectively. The four identified co-regulatory neworks were indicated as: COR-A, CORB, COR-C and COR-D.

and Additional file 11); the WRKY PCC analysis is a valuable tool to unveil novel co-regulatory pathways between
WRKY genes in plants.
Integration of rice co-expression clusters and Arabidopsis
WRKY co-regulatory networks
We attempted to link rice co-expression clustering data to
Arabidopsis co-regulatory pathways and vice versa by
search for respective orthologs. We used GreenPhylDB
[50] to search for pairs of rice-Arabidopsis orthologs in
the WRKY gene family with a bootstrap value greater than
50%. By this analysis we identified the following conserved WRKY networks between rice and Arabidopsis (see
Table 3):

- the Arabidopsis orthologs (AtWRKY18, AtWRKY40 and
AtWRKY33) of the three rice genes of cluster A in the
OsWRKYARRAY
(OsWRKY61,
OsWRKY4
and
OsWRKY18) were significantly connected in the COR-A
network. In particular, the two orthologs, AtWRKY18 and
AtWRKY40, were connected in P-log analysis and, as
aforementioned, it was reported that they physically interact in vitro and in vivo [28].
- the Arabidopsis orthologs (AtWRKY46, AtWRKY70/
AtWRKY54) of the two rice genes of cluster E (OsWRKY71

and OsWRKY79) were found to be connected within the
COR-A network; these findings were experimentally supported by their very similar profiles of gene expression
upon pathogen attack [22].
- the six genes belonging to the rice co-expression cluster I
(OsWRKY4,-18,-22,-53,-78,-100) had all Arabidopsis
orthologs belonging to COR-A; five of these identified
AtWRKY orthologs were directly pairwise connected
within the COR-A network.
As regards to the remaining rice WRKY genes shown to be
part of co-expression clusters, in most cases, it was not
possible to find their respective orthologs in Arabidopsis.
In particular, four of them belong to the OsWRKY 3C
group, which has not orthologs in Arabidopsis [see Additional file 2]. The role of these WRKY genes and of the 3C
rice-specific phylogenetic group in defence related signalling pathways deserves further investigations at the functional level.

Discussion

OsWRKY genes belonging to each of the nine identified co-expression clusters in rice are listed together with their assigned phylogenetic group,
according to the At-Os phylogenetic analysis [see Additional file 2]. When identified, the putative Arabidopsis ortholog/s with a bootstrap value
higher than 50% is/are reported along with its/their affiliation to a co-regulatory network, as obtained by P-lin correlation analysis (Figure 4). no
ortholog indicates the absence of identified corresponding Arabidopsis gene.

differentially co-expressed upon biotic and abiotic stress
conditions.
The genes OsWRKY6, -18, -61, 71, found to be differentially expressed in the OsWRKYARRAY experiments, were
previously described as being involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses [51-54]. In particular, OsWRKY18,
which resulted to be significantly regulated in our biotic/
abiotic stress experiments, was reported as being modulated in roots during microbial colonization [55], after
application of salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, 1-aminocyclo-propane-1-carboxylic acid and in response to both
wounding and pathogen infection [52].
To extend our transcriptome analysis we took advantage
of a large set of gene expression data extrapolated from the
22 K NIAS array experiments. By integrating the data from
both microarrays, nine co-expression WRKY gene clusters
were identified (see Figures 2 and 3), some of them
restricted to specific experimental conditions, while others found in a larger set of them. Despite the relatively low
ratios of the expression levels in both rice microarray
experiments of the differentially-regulated WRKY genes,
the majority of them were confirmed by qRT-PCR analyses. In fact, most plant transcriptional factors are tightly
and, often, only transiently up- or down-regulated upon
stress stimuli making it difficult to capture their peak of
induction/repression [56-58]. Moreover, in the case of
infection with fungal pathogens, as Magnaporthe, only a
few cell layers (e.g. epidermal cells) are implicated in the
plant responses [38], while gene expression studies rely
on bulked leaf material, causing a "dilution" effect of the
detected gene expression levels [59,60]. In a number of
cases only in situ hybridisation or laser capture microdissection (LCM) coupled with microarray experiments
revealed the exact gene expression patterns of specific
members in transcriptional factors gene families (e.g.
MADS-BOX genes in ovules, meristem) [61,62]. Recently,
LCM technology was also successfully applied to the study
of plant-microbe interactions [63].
The integration of the gene expression clusters to the phylogenetic data of the whole OsWRKY gene family (see Figure 1) highlighted that also genes belonging to clearly
distinct clades were significantly co-expressed. Closelyrelated OsWRKY genes, likely to be derived from recent
duplication events, were found to be tightly co-regulated;
this was expected, since it was shown that recently duplicated WRKY genes often keep the same role in signal
transduction, representing a typical case of functional
redundancy [37]. On the other hand, the OsWRKY CORs
would indicate the existence of WRKY protein complexes
where WRKYs belonging to different subgroups bind to
different cis-regulatory elements, thus giving them different targets that are expressed under the same conditions,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/120

tissue and timing. The identification of co-regulated
WRKY genes would allow researchers making moreinformative choices of double and triple mutant combinations to circumvent redundancy or test for potential
protein-protein interactions to functionally investigate
the relevance of specific WRKY complexes in pathogen
resistance, tolerance to abiotic stress, hormonal balance
and plant development.
At WRKY co-regulatory networks
To address the existence of co-regulatory pathways of phylogenetically unrelated WRKY genes in plants we carried
out Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) analysis of
Arabidopsis Affymetrix transcriptome data from 2,000
experiments. All Affymetrix array experiments were carried out by the same laboratory (NASC) with standardized
normalization process thus facilitating the creation of
robust and reliable PCC matrices. The generated matrices
for AtWRKY genes using both untransformed [see Additional file 5] and logarithm-transformed [see Additional
file 6] expression data were analysed at different threshold
values of PCC. The appropriateness of the applied threshold value of 0.6 was validated using the set of available
data for the MADS-BOX gene family of transcription factors [see Additional file 7, 8]. We took advantage of the indepth knowledge of the MADS-BOX signal transduction
pathways and protein-protein interactions to validate the
factual existence of the correlations identified in our PCC
approach. In most cases the identified co-regulatory edges
well reflected the existing genetic evidences described in
the literature. Moreover, most of the PCC-identified networks supports specific sets of MADS-BOX genes in the
same signal transduction pathways and their tight coexpression in specific cell layers [64,65].

The PCC analysis (see Figure 4) highlighted the presence
of two main interconnected co-regulatory networks of
phylogenetically distinct AtWRKY genes (COR-A, CORB). Such networks represent powerful tools to identify
candidate partners of WRKY genes of interest or to investigate experimentally the existence of interactions
between WRKY proteins in vivo (e.g. co-immunoprecipitation analysis). The presence in COR-A of AtWRKY18,
AtWRKY40, -38, -46, -54, -70, 33 and -25 showed that the
PCC approach was able to identify WRKY genes previously described as being part of a functional network
involved in response to stress stimuli. In fact, AtWRKY18
and AtWRKY40 are pathogen-induced genes and known
to physically interact [28]. AtWRKY38, AtWRKY46,
AtWRKY54 and AtWRKY70 are also pathogen-induced
genes and three of them are known to act in the same regulatory pathway. Moreover, the application of salicylic
acid to wrky54 mutants altered the expression patterns of
AtWRKY38 and AtWRKY70 genes [22]. The COR-A network also included AtWRKY genes found to be involved

in Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) by Wang et al. [29],
in a study aimed to identify targets of NPR1, an essential
regulator of plant SAR. Among these targets, the authors
found eight AtWRKYs of which five were shown to be part
of the complex transcriptional regulatory network of SAR.
In our PCC analysis of AtWRKY networks, four of these
five genes (AtWRKY18, -54, -53 and -70) not only
belonged to the same group (COR-A), but they were also
tightly correlated (Fig 4A). In this study, the authors stated
that, in addition to AtWRKY46, AtWRKY53, AtWRKY54, a
related gene of AtWRKY70 is required to fully silence salicilate biosynthesis, yet to be identified. In both the P-lin
and P-log analysis AtWRKY38 is significantly connected to
these co-regulated genes and, therefore, it may be the best
candidate to be functionally characterized.
Most of the previously-mentioned genes were studied as
they are phylogenetically related [22,28]. However, our
PCC analysis of the AtWRKY genes suggested that the
interaction in co-regulatory networks may occur also
between phylogenetically unrelated WRKY genes, such as
AtWRKY40, AtWRKY6, AtWRKY33 and AtWRKY46
belonging to different groups (2A, 2B, 1 and 3, respectively).
The topology of the COR-A network predicted the presence of further genes that could be involved in the same
signal transduction pathway. A role for these genes in
plant defence has yet to be defined, but according to the
Pearson co-regulatory analysis they are interesting candidates to be tested at the genetic and biochemical level.
Similarly, the co-regulatory network Cor-B indicated that
several unrelated WRKY genes, functionally uncharacterized to date, are likely to interact among each other.
Genetic analysis of those genes as part of a regulatory network rather than as single genes may give further insights
into their function and role in specific signalling pathways. In COR-C the AtWRKY34 and AtWRKY42 genes
were found to be strongly connected by a PCC value of
0.9; these two genes, together with AtWRKY31 were only
seen in the P-lin analysis as their expression was found to
be restricted only to a very specific plant tissue (data not
shown). The COR-D network, only present in the P-lin
analysis, was constituted of the three genes AtWRKY3,
AtWRKY4 and AtWRKY32. While the genetic interaction
between AtWRKY3 and AtWRKY4 both belonging to the
phylogenetic group 1 was previously demonstrated [49],
the association of the yet unassigned AtWRKY32 to the
other two genes and its potential role in WRKY-mediated
pathogen signal transduction pathways (e.g. resistance
mechanisms to B. cinerea) remains to be elucidated. Our
PCC analysis enables scientists to formulate new working
hypotheses involving AtWRKY genes belonging to distinct
phylogenetic groups to dissect specific regulatory pathways in plants.

Orthology rice - Arabidopsis
A large set of microarray data is vital to build up detailed
and reliable co-regulatory networks. Among plants, this
can be achieved, to date, only for Arabidopsis thaliana due
to the large and consistent expression dataset. However,
the Arabidopsis co-regulatory networks can be used as reference for other species where a smaller set of expression
experiments is available. In addition, when information
of orthology is available between Arabidopsis and
another species, this approach can identify the existence
of genes involved in a common biological process or
extend their number, even if expression data are not sufficient to reveal the existence of co-regulatory networks
[25]. This approach was proven to be successful and
highly informative for OsWRKY genes in this study. In
fact, we found 20 pairs of orthologous genes among rice
and Arabidopsis and 8 of them were co-regulated in both
species, integrating our microarray, Q-PCR and PCC
results.

In summary, our first attempt to correlate specific
OsWRKY co-expression clusters to AtWRKY-COR groups
revealed the existence of one large (cluster I in rice) and
two smaller (cluster A and E in rice) conserved co-regulatory networks between the two model plants. This will
now open the route to test the functional conservation of
the identified clusters of WRKY genes between the two
species and their involvement in the same signal transduction pathways. However, the difficulty in finding
orthologs between rice and Arabidopsis WRKY genes, due
to successive rounds of duplications in both species and to
the existence of Monocot and Dicot-specific phylogenetic
clades, calls for the need to develop suitable transcriptome resources to carry out PCC analysis in rice. Only this
systematic analysis will enable researchers to develop
working hypotheses on co-regulatory signal transduction
pathways of rice WRKY genes to be experimentally tested.

Conclusion
Ülker and Somssich [6] pointed out that to assign a specific function to members of this complex gene family "of
imminent importance is to uncover WRKY-interacting
proteins that assist in regulating the transcription of
genes". Here we proposed a validated and innovative
approach that aims at finding such interacting proteins
relying not on their sequence similarity, but rather on coregulation at the transcriptome level. Our integrated riceArabidopsis co-expression approach showed the existence
of large co-regulatory networks of WRKY genes in plants.
The PCC analysis revealed that closely-related AtWRKY
genes, known to be involved in the same signal transduction pathways (and often functionally redundant), are
also strongly co-regulated with other phylogenetically distantly-related members of the WRKY gene family. The indepth analysis of WRKY COR networks will surely con-

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:120

tribute to unveil the function of WRKY genes, as a more
targeted genetic analysis will be possible on sets of candidate genes, shown to be significantly co-regulated. Moreover, the existence of complex regulatory pathways clearly
supports the existence of cascades of WRKY signal transduction steps, as shown for MADS-BOX and MAP kinase
genes [66], yet to be defined.
In conclusion our rice-Arabidopsis integrated approach
strongly supports the existence of cross-regulatory pathways by WRKY genes possibly via specific feedback mechanisms, as recently highlighted by Pandey et al. [25].
The PCC analysis presented in this manuscript represents
a powerful tool applicable to gene families of other classes
of transcriptional factors, contributing to define regulatory networks in plants activated in response to biotic and
abiotic stress stimuli.

Methods
WRKY gene sequences
Nucleotide sequences to design oligos have been retrieved
searching for PFAM ID PF03106 as query in the Rice
Annotation Release 5 at TIGR http://www.tigr.org/tdb/
e2k1/osa1/domain_search.shtml. The PFAM PF03106 is
the name of the WRKY domain stored in the PFAM database, a large collection of protein domain families, which
provides multiple sequence alignments and Hidden
Markov Models (HMMs). When more than one alternative splicing sequence was found for the same locus, only
the longest one was used. Further sequences previously
found as WRKY gene in previous releases of TIGR but not
confirmed in the last one were kept anyway. A search for
WRKY genes not annotated as WRKY by TIGR was perform with tblastn on Genbank using the following consensus sequence: KPRFAFMTKSEVDILDDGYRWRKYGQK
MIKNNPYPRSYYRCTMAKGCVKKQVERCSDDPIIVITTYE
GQHNHPWP as a query filtering for E value < 10-13. A
summary table specifying nomenclature used in this article of the retrieved 104 OsWRKY, gene locus in TIGR
nomenclature and names provided in earlier publications
[17,34] are reported in Additional file 1. For each gene, a
gene-specific sequence of 60 nucleotides was designed
generally in the 3' end of the gene and, in any case, out of
the conserved domain. Four replicates of each oligo were
spotted on slides together with oligos for positive, negative, and 7 housekeeping genes. A complete list of spotted
genes and their sequences is provided in Additional file 3

Phylogenetic analyses
We based our evolutionary reconstruction of the WRKY
family on the multiple alignment of the amino acidic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/120

sequence of the WRKY domains. We made two major
reconstructions: one with all the rice members of the
WRKY gene family and the second with all the WRKY
domains of rice and Arabidopsis. In the latter, the nonplant sequences of Giardia lamblia, Dictyostelium discoideum and Chlamydomonas reinhadrtii were also included.
The final set of proteins was composed of 122 sequences
for the OsWRKY tree and of 204 for the Arabidopsis-Os
WRKY tree. We built up a multiple sequence alignment
(MSA) using MUSCLE [67] with the maximum number of
iterations set to 1000. We derived Maximum Likelihood
(ML) phylogenetic inferences using PHYML [68], applying the JTT matrix. Our model of sequence evolution
assumed that there were two classes of sites, one class
being invariable and the other class being free to change.
The rate variation across these sites was assumed to follow
a gamma shape distribution calculated using a discrete
approximation with eight categories of sites. One hundred
bootstrap replicates were used to support the hypotheses
of relationships. The tree image was produced using iTOL
[69].
Interaction with Magnaporthe grisea
Rice plants (Oryza sativa L. ssp japonica) cv. Nipponbare
were grown from seeds in a greenhouse in trays of 40 × 29
× 7 cm filled with compost (7/8 Neuhaus compost N 9, 1/
8 pouzzolane) under a 27°/22°C day/night temperature,
60% humidity. Twenty seeds were sown in rows with 6
rows per genotype. Nitrogen fertilization with 8.6 g of
nitrogen equivalent was done at 7 and 2 days before inoculation. The same conditions were applied to control
(mock) and infected plants.
Magnaporthe grisea isolate cultures
Three fungal isolates with different geographic origins
were chosen from the Magnaporthe (Hebert) Barr strain
collection (CIRAD, Montpellier). Magnaporthe oryzae
FR13 is a rice isolate, Magnaporthe oryzae BR32 is a nonrice isolate from wheat and Magnaporthe grisea BR29 was
isolated from crabgrass. These strains were cultured in
Petri dishes containing 20 mL of medium composed with
20 g × L-1 rice seed flour, 2.5 g × L-1 yeast extract, 1.5% agar
(Merck). After autoclaving, 500,000 units of Penicillin G
(Sigma) were added aseptically by filter sterilizing. The
cultures were then placed in a growth chamber with a 12
h photoperiod and a constant temperature of 25°C for 7
to 9 days prior to inoculation.
Inoculation
Conidia were harvested from plates by rinsing with sterile
distilled water and filtering through two layers of gauze.
Inoculations with Magnaporthe strains were performed
with rice plantlets 2 weeks after sowing by spraying with
conidial suspensions. Thirty mL of either a 100,000 (for
FR13) or 300,000 (for BR29 or BR32) conidia × mL-1 sus-

pension with 0.5% gelatin were sprayed on each tray (60
plants). Control plants were sprayed with a solution of
water with 0.5% gelatin (mock-treated leaves). Treated
and control rice plants were then kept together for 16
hours in a controlled climatic chamber at 25°C and 95%
relative humidity. Leaf tissue was then harvested 24 hours
after inoculation for total RNA extraction. To obtain RNA
for the microarray experiments, each treatment was
repeated twice on independent assays. Additional independent experiments were carried out in three biological
replicates to obtain RNA for the Q-PCR and validate
OsWRKYARRAY results.
Abiotic stress
Dehisced seeds from Nipponbare genotype were sterilized
with 15% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite for 30 minutes and
then rinsed with distilled water. Seeds were germinated in
Petri dishes at 28°C on Whatman paper soaked in deionized water. After 4 days, rice seedlings were transferred in
pots containing pouzzolane and allowed to growth under
controlled conditions with a 28/25°C day/night temperatures, 12 hours photoperiod and 55-65% humidity for 2
weeks in Yoshida modified solution (Yoshida, 1981): 0.7
mM KNO3, 1.2 mM Ca(NO3)2, 1.6 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM
(NH4)2SO4, 0.8 mM KH2PO4, 60 μM FeEDTA, 20 μM
MnSO4, 0.32 μM(NH4)6Mo7O24, 1.4 μM ZnSO4, 1.6 μM
CuSO4, 45.2 μM H3BO3. Medium pH was adjusted to 5.0
twice a day. Seedlings at the 5 leaves stage without any visible tiller were carefully selected for stress treatments. For
osmotic stress, 100 mM of mannitol was added in the
hydroponic solution, whereas in the control (nonstressed) mannitol was not added to the solution. Root
and leaf tissues were harvested 1 hour and 5 hours after
the beginning of stress treatment. The harvested tissues
were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
-80°C. Tissues of control plants were collected at the same
conditions and time as stressed plants. Each treatment
was repeated twice, on independent assays for the microarray experiments. Additional independent experiments
were carried out in two biological replicates, to obtain
RNA for the qRT-PCR and validate OsWRKYARRAY
results. Leaf samples from treated and control plants were
harvested 5 hours after mannitol application.
RNA extraction
Each biological replicate was obtained by pooling three
leaves (third leaf) harvested from three different plants
(mock/infected) for each treatment. Total RNA of each
biological replicate was purified, using the TRIZOL protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was quantified using a
NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer; RNA with an
absorbance A260/A280 ratio > 2.0 was tested for quality
and integrity using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent).

Microarray hybridisation
The customized OsWRKYARRAY microarrays were produced using a Virtek ChipWriter Pro contact printing
robot. Hundred thirty oligos of 60-mers representing rice
WRKY genes and positive and negative controls were
printed onto Corning GAPSII (gamma amino propyl
silane) slides at a final concentration of 20 μM. Ten μg of
total RNAs were used for Cy3 or Cy5 labelling using the
Cyscribe First-Strand cDNA labelling kit (Amersham). The
labelled cDNA samples were purified using the CyScribe
GFX Purification Kit (Amersham) and concentrated using
a microcon YM-30 filter (Millipore). Five ng of Luciferase
RNA (Promega) was added to each RNA sample prior
labelling and used as spiking control. For array hybridisation, Cy3 and Cy5 labelled cDNA probes were mixed with
Calf thymus DNA (Sigma) and EGT hybridisation buffer
(Eurogentec) and hybridized to the microarray (Eurogentec) at 42°C in a humid chamber (Corning) for 16 hours.
Arrays were washed 5 minutes in a 0.2×SSC-0.1% sodium
dodecyl sulfate solution then 5 minutes in 0.2×SSC. The
arrays were spin-dried and scanned using the Axon 4100A
Scanner. The hybridisation data were collected using the
GenePix Pro 3.0 software. Dye swaps for each experiment
were performed and hybridisations repeated twice for
experiments BR29, BR32, osmotic stress (leaves) at 5
hours, and for osmotic stress (roots) at 5 hours; only once
for FR13 and osmotic stress (roots) 1 hour. Two biological
replicates have been tested for each analysed condition.
Three negative (Drosophila melanogaster lysozyme C,
Drosophila melanogaster myosin 61F, Drosophila melanogaster Male-specific RNA 57Db), and four positive control (PR1 and PBZ1, dehydration-stress inducible protein
and no apical meristem) were included. Housekeeping
were the following genes: actin, zinc finger, cathepsin blike cysteine proteinase, polyubiquitin, glyceralde-3phosphate dehydrogenase, vacuolar proton-translocating
ATP-ase subunit [see Additional file 3].
Microarray and clustering analysis
OsWRKY expression data were extracted from results of 30
hybridisation experiments with the 22 K NIAS array http:/
/www.nias.affrc.go.jp/index_e.html of which 17 were
involving abiotic stress treatments; each value represents
the mean of three independent hybridisation experiments. Both OsWRKYARRAY and NIAS 22 K microarray
data were normalized using Limma [70] a package of the
statistical software R, part of Bioconductor http://
www.bioconductor.org/. Normalization on total signal
was performed using the "loess function", but giving a differential weight (10 times higher) to housekeeping genes
and DNA. A linear model was then applied to test the null
hypothesis that the log of the ratio treatment/control was
equal to 0. Associated P-values were corrected for false discovery rate [71]. For presence-absence of transcript, for
every slide expression level (log of the average of two

channels) of replicates of every gene was analysed with
statistical T-test, if significantly different from expression
level of negative control (Mst_57_Db, Myo61 and LysC).
Genes which passed the test with a P-value < 0.001 were
considered expressed. Raw data can be found at GEO
(NCBI) with accession numbers GSE5819 (WRKYARRAY), GSE7531 and GSE7532 (NIAS). Clustering of rice
data was performed using EPICLUST, a module of Expression Profiler http://www.bioinf.ebc.ee/EP/EP/. Default
parameters were applied and a hierarchical clustering
analysis was carried out using linear correlation based distance (Pearson) to calculate similarity matrix and
UPGMA. Image of P-values were obtained using R on a
computer with Ubuntu Linux installed.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR
Leaf samples were obtained in new independent experiments carried out specifically to biologically validate
OsWRKYARRAY results. The RNA (800 ng) was treated
with the DNase I (Fermentas), and 500 ng of the treated
RNA was reverse-transcribed with High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystem) using an
oligo(dT) primer following manufacturer's recommendations. The cDNA synthesis reactions were treated with
RNAse H, diluted hundred fold in sterile water, and 2,5 μl
of the diluted cDNA served as template for PCR. For quantitative PCR, 2× Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystem) were used according to manufacturer's recommendations on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time
PCR System using version SDS 2.2.2 software (Applied
Biosystems) to analyse raw data. Specific primer pairs
were designed for 14 WRKY full-length cDNAs using
Primer3 software and ordered from Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd. (Haverhill, UK). Primer specificity was assessed
by sequencing PCR products. Primer sequences are shown
in Additional file 13. The expression level of each gene
was measured in leaf samples infected with the three Magnaporthe strains and after osmotic stress treatment (4 different conditions). Results with an associated P-value >
0.05 were considered not significant and therefore are not
reported in Table 2. The PCR was carried out in a total volume of 10 μL containing 0.3 μM of each primer, 1× Power
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were amplified as follows: 95°C for 10 min, then 40
cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 1 min. The absence of
genomic DNA and non-specific by-products of the PCR
amplification was confirmed by analysis of dissociation
curves. For each primer pair, appropriate calibration
curves were first obtained with different dilutions (0.1,
0.04, 0.02, 0.01, 0.004, 0.002, 0.0010) and were accepted
when the correlation coefficient was ≥ 0.99 and the efficiency between 95 and 105%. All calculations for relative
quantification were performed as described in Pfaffl [72]
using a mathematical model to determine the relative

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/120

quantification of the target gene compared with the reference gene (actin) from an inoculated plant versus a control (mock) one. Statistical significance of the difference
between mock and infected was assessed by T-test analysis.
Pearson correlation
Pearson correlation values were calculated essentially as
described by Toufighi et al. [41] for the 'Expression
Angler'. To this purpose a Visual C++ based program was
developed (P. Morandini, L. Mizzi, unpublished) to calculate the correlation value from the data obtained with the
ATH1 GeneChip from Affymetrix and deposited at the
NASC array database http://affy.Arabidopsis.info/nar
rays/experimentbrowse.pl as of September 2008. For the
calculation of Pearson coefficient from log values, data
were simply transformed into log before calculating the
correlation value. From such values, networks of Arabidopsis WRKY genes were produced using the program dot
http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/gansner93technique.html. The
input text file for dot was prepared using a script that filtered WRKY genes with a reciprocal coefficient of 0.6 or
higher from the complete table of Pearson coefficient.
Intensity of arrow colours are proportional to the coefficient between each pair of WRKY genes. A more detailed
explanation of the method used is reported in Menges et
al. [42] in the section Global expression correlation analysis
in Methods.
