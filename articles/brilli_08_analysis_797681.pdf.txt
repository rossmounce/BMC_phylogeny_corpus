Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic methods are well-established bioinformatic tools for sequence
analysis, allowing to describe the non-independencies of sequences because of their common
ancestor. However, the evolutionary profiles of bacterial genes are often complicated by hidden
paralogy and extensive and/or (multiple) horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events which make
bifurcating trees often inappropriate. In this context, plasmid sequences are paradigms of networklike relationships characterizing the evolution of prokaryotes. Actually, they can be transferred
among different organisms allowing the dissemination of novel functions, thus playing a pivotal role
in prokaryotic evolution. However, the study of their evolutionary dynamics is complicated by the
absence of universally shared genes, a prerequisite for phylogenetic analyses.
Results: To overcome such limitations we developed a bioinformatic package, named
Blast2Network (B2N), allowing the automatic phylogenetic profiling and the visualization of
homology relationships in a large number of plasmid sequences. The software was applied to the
study of 47 completely sequenced plasmids coming from Escherichia, Salmonella and Shigella spps.
Conclusion: The tools implemented by B2N allow to describe and visualize in a new way some
of the evolutionary features of plasmid molecules of Enterobacteriaceae; in particular it helped to
shed some light on the complex history of Escherichia, Salmonella and Shigella plasmids and to focus
on possible roles of unannotated proteins.
The proposed methodology is general enough to be used for comparative genomic analyses of
bacteria.

Background
Despite the huge amount of available sequences, few
papers reported comparative analyses of entire plasmids
with the aim of a complete classification of the functions

they code for [1-4], and none considered all the sequences
coming from entire genera or more inclusive taxonomic
groups.

Nevertheless, plasmids are extremely important in microbial evolution, because they can be transferred between
organisms, representing natural vectors for the transfer of
genes and functions they code for [[5,6] and references
therein]. In medical epidemiology and microbial ecology
plasmids are thoroughly investigated because they often
carry genes encoding adaptive traits such as antibiotic
resistance, pathogenesis or the ability to exploit new environments or compounds [[7-9] and references therein].
While bacterial chromosomes show a relatively high conservation of their architecture, plasmid molecules are
more variable concerning gene content and/or organization, even at short evolutionary distances. Indeed, plasmid genes can be considered to be under differential
selection, while moving around the bacterial community.
Moreover they have a dynamic structure, i.e. genes can be
gained or lost from the plasmid molecule. Actually, the
same plasmid can be hosted by different organisms
inhabiting different environments (e.g.: pH, temperature
and chemical composition) and cohabiting with different
genetic backgrounds. These factors may shape both the
functional role(s) of the proteins, and the compositional
features of plasmid DNA, such as GC or oligomers contents, some of the last being a very specific signature even
at close phylogenetic distances [10].
Despite their key role in the microbial world, at least two
main issues concerning plasmids remain poorly investigated: i) the function of proteins they code for (see Additional file 1, more than 25% of proteins do not have
assigned COG) and ii) the evolutionary dynamics of plasmids including their importance in bacterial evolution
[11].
This latter point is often analyzed using phylogenetic
methods that make use of rigorous statistical approaches
to model the evolution of sequences (such as Maximum
Likelihood or Bayesian inference). However, such methods are of restricted use in the case of plasmid molecules:
they are computationally expensive when thousands of
amino acid or nucleotide sequences are analyzed, and,
moreover, require a set of homologous and universally
shared sequences, that could be unavailable when studying plasmids.
To overcome these limitations we have developed a bioinformatic package (Blast2Network, B2N) having three
main aims:
1) to reconstruct the evolutionary history of plasmids
molecules by identifying those having the most similar
gene content;
2) to assign a putative function to previously uncharacterized proteins. This task is fulfilled in two ways: by means

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/551

of sequence similarity of unknown or hypothetical proteins to known ones and through a phylogenetic profiling
approach. In this case the function of a protein is inferred
by observing co-occurrence patterns. This is based on the
idea that proteins involved in the same metabolic process
or macromolecular complex tend to be maintained (or
lost) together and that proteins which often occur
together are likely to be functionally linked [12].
3) to provide an immediate visualization of the similarities existing among sequences. In fact, one of the outputs
of the program is a network of sequence similarities in a
format readable by the visualization software Visone
http://visone.info/.
To test the package, we focused the attention on plasmids
harbored by members of the Enterobacteriaceae family of
γ-Proteobacteria, which is one of the most studied divisions of bacteria and includes Escherichia, Shigella, and
Salmonella genera, whose biomedical importance [13] has
allowed to record a relatively high number of completely
sequenced plasmids in a few species. Moreover, horizontal transfer of plasmids between them has been described
[14], complicating the phylogenetic information on plasmids; lastly, several pathogenesis-associated phenotypes
are plasmid-borne [15]. Consequently, the application of
B2N to this dataset could allow to reveal the presence of
relationships between known pathogenesis-associated
proteins and those which have not been characterized yet.

Methods
Description of the program
The procedure implemented in B2N is schematically
reported in Figure 1a, but several tasks can be performed
separately because of the modular nature of our software.
The main workflow starts from a file containing protein or
nucleic acid sequences in standard NCBI fasta format.
This is used as an input to gather information on source
sequences from the NCBI website. Several files are automatically generated for reference along with the corresponding nucleotide sequences for both genes and source
sequences (e.g. the genome or the plasmid encoding the
proteins used as input). Input sequences are then screened
one against each other using BLAST [16]. The resulting
output is parsed in the form of an adjacency matrix that
describes the global sequence similarities in the dataset
where each entry wij reflects the similarity existing between
protein i and j. The user is initially prompted to choose
two different selection criteria for alignments: an E-value
threshold and an alignment length cut-off; after setting
these parameters, all alignments passing the selection criteria are inserted in the matrix. Moreover, the user can
specify the nature of the similarity score to be used, i.e.
identity percentage or bit score; the bit score can also be
normalized using the score of the alignment of the query
with itself obtaining a value which is normalized on the

The input of each module (i.e. the output of the previous one) is shown in red fonts. b) Phylogenetic profiling of molecules in
the dataset. Using the matrix of occurrence patterns, groups of proteins are identified at different threshold values. A new
matrix is obtained composed of a row for each plasmid in the dataset and a number of columns corresponding to the number
of groups in the network. Each entry i, j of the matrix contains 1 if at least one protein from plasmid i is present in cluster j, 0 if
no protein from plasmid i is present cluster j. This matrix is used for calculating distances using the Jaccard metric and dendrogram construction. This analysis identifies those plasmids that contain similar proteins. By applying the same workflow in the
second dimension of the phylogenetic profiles matrix, it is possible to find those protein clusters having similar occurrence patterns.

alignment length. The weighted link values can be useful
when comparing sequences from different species searching for those having the highest rate of horizontal transfer.
This can be done in B2N specifying a distance matrix of
house-keeping genes in Phylip format. The adjacency
matrix obtained by parsing the BLAST output is the input
for the phylogenetic profile method.
Phylogenetic Profiling
This approach allows the analysis of co-occurrence patterns, metabolic reconstruction and so on. In details, by
taking as input the adjacency matrix storing the sequence
similarity values, B2N produces a rectangular matrix (as
described in the central part of Figure 1b) composed by all
the plasmids under analysis (rows) and all the protein
clusters (columns) identified through a depth-first search
of the adjacency matrix. Each position of the phylogenetic
profile matrix will be "1" in the case a given plasmid (row)
possesses (at least) one protein in the corresponding protein cluster (column), whereas it is filled with "0" in the
opposite case.

One of the commonly used metrics for binary data comparison is the Jaccard similarity coefficient. Given two vectors of phylogenetic profiles in binary form (A and B in
this case, with n observations), the Jaccard coefficient is
defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size
of the union of the sample sets: J(A, B) = |A ∩ B|/|A ∪ B|.
The 'Jaccard distance', which measures dissimilarity
between sample sets, is obtained by dividing the difference of the sizes of the union and the intersection of two
sets by the size of the union: Jδ (A, B) = |A ∪ B| - |A ∩ B|/
|A ∪ B| = 1 - J(A, B).
The Jaccard coefficient is a useful measure of the overlap
that the attributes of 'A' and 'B' share. Each attribute of 'A'
and 'B' can either be 0 ('absence') or 1 ('presence'). The
total number of each combination of attributes for both
'A' and 'B' are specified as follows: M11 (M00) represents
the total number of attributes where 'A' and 'B' both have
a value of 1 (0). M01 (M10) represents the total number of
attributes where the attribute of 'A' is 0 (1) and the
attribute of 'B' is 1 (0). Each attribute must fall into one of
these four categories, meaning that their sum equals n.
The Jaccard similarity coefficient is J = M11/(M01+ M10+
M11). Blast2Network calculates the Jaccard distance for
both dimensions of the phylogenetic profiles matrix,
which corresponds to the distance between plasmids in
term of shared genes, and the distance between occurrence patterns of clusters in plasmids. The Jaccard distance
matrices are then used for the construction of two neighbor-joining dendrograms (Figure 1b). The first one
describes similarities in gene content of the plasmids, the
other one groups together those protein clusters with the
most similar occurrence pattern within plasmids. Ran-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/551

dom permutations of the original data allows to compute
the statistical significance of the Jaccard distances.
Network construction
B2N also outputs the BLAST post processing results as a
network in Visone format http://visone.info/, a freely
available software for network visualization and analysis.
In doing so, it takes advantage of several information: the
position and the color of the nodes (proteins) in the network correspond to the plasmid source, whereas the links
indicate the existence of a given degree of sequence similarity between nodes. To reduce the dimensionality of the
networks it is possible to use the Jaccard distance matrices
to construct two hypergraphs where each plasmid or protein cluster, respectively, are collapsed to single nodes
connected by edges whose values reflect the significance
of the Jaccard distance calculated (see below and in Additional file 2).
Additional tools
B2N can include additional information in the network,
assigning to each node a numerical (or binary) value
which can be visualized in Visone as the size of the node;
this node-associated value might be a compositional
measure, such as the GC content and/or the codon adaptation index [17,18] of the corresponding gene. To this
purpose, B2N has two methods but the user can input its
own list of values as a text file. The first built-in method
writes node values corresponding to the GC content of a
sequence, while the other one implements the dinucleotide analysis derived from [10] and [19], obtaining a
composition-based dissimilarity index of a gene sequence
with respect to the source plasmid (or genome). Considering each possible dinucleotide, say xy, and a gene s, xy(s)=
(fxy(s)/fx(s)*fy(s)). From this value the program obtains (s,g)
= 1/16 * | xy(s) - xy(g)| over all 16 dinucleotides, that is a
measure of the compositional bias of a given sequence (s)
with respect to a reference sequence (g) i.e. the genome or
the entire plasmid. The can be used to detect genes that
have been recently transferred and have since then maintained the compositional properties of the original plasmid.
Sequence data source and software availability
The dataset used in this work is composed by all the proteins encoded by the available completely sequenced plasmid sequences from Escherichia, Shigella, and Salmonella
genera (Table 1). Complete plasmid sequences were
downloaded from the NCBI ftp website ftp://
ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/release/plasmid.

The software B2N with the user's manual can be directly
requested to the authors and is also available as Additional file (Additional file 3).

Results and discussion
Visual representation of sequence homology network
B2N was used to study the relationships existing between
homologous proteins from all the completely sequenced
plasmids available from three γ-Proteobacterial genera:
Escherichia, Shigella, Salmonella. The dataset contains a
total of 3701 ORFs, from 47 different plasmids (Table 1).
To our knowledge, no attempt was made to describe in a
meta analysis the overall body of plasmid sequence data
in these species. Figure 2 shows the graphical representation of two networks generated with B2N using protein
sequences in our dataset and using an aminoacid
sequence identity threshold of 90% or 100% (Figure 2a
and 2b respectively, where the thresholds are particularly
high and the number of plasmids reduced to 39 out of 47
for clarity purposes). Proteins from the same plasmid are

circularly arranged around the same centre and share the
same color; proteins from the same genus are represented
by the same shape (Figure 2c). The networks, obtained
choosing an E-value threshold of 0.0001 and a minimum
alignment length of 70 residues, have been visualized
using the software Visone. The size of the nodes is proportional to the number of links they have. The analysis of
Figure 2 revealed that most plasmids are strongly connected to others, but there are also plasmids exhibiting
just few connections (see the section Phylogenetic profiling).
Focusing on protein clusters instead of plasmids, we can
arrange nodes in an uniform visualization, where nodes
are clustered together if they directly or indirectly share at
least one link (Figure 3, with a threshold of 40% identity).

Quite interestingly, clustering of similar sequences at
lower thresholds permits to assign a putative function to
unknown or hypothetical proteins, and to discover the
presence (if any) of functional classes or metabolic pathways that are more common in the network.

Network data analysis
The analysis of the network data represented in Figures 2
and 3 revealed several interesting features of the relationships among the sequenced plasmids of the three genera
under investigation:

One of the problems faced with such complex data is the
reduction of the dimensionality, so that important relationships can be more easily identified. Similarities in
gene content between different plasmids can be better visualized by collapsing all the proteins belonging to the
same plasmid in a single node. In this way a hypergraph
is obtained where each node represents a single plasmid.
The connection can be obtained from the plasmid vs plasmid Jaccard distance matrix or better, they can reflect the
p-values matrix, so that each link in the hypergraph quantifies the significance of a given association between plasmids (showed in Additional file 2) and a simple hard
thresholding allows changing the stringency for the inclusion of edges in the hypergraph.

1) Out of a total of 3701 proteins in the dataset, we found
1633 (44%) and 2471 (66.7%) isolated nodes at a threshold of 90% or 100% of identity for links, respectively (Figure 2a and 2b).
2) Most plasmids contain at least some gene coding for
highly interconnected proteins; however, some of them
(e.g. pRK2, ColJs Cjl, pLG13, CloDF13) exhibited only
few connections. Hence, these plasmids share few genes
with the other members of the dataset at these threshold
levels. This, in turn, may suggest that they might have
experienced less recombination events than others.

displayed using a threshold identity for links of 40% (a degree of amino acid sequence identity sufficiently high to cluster
together proteins that should perform the same function, and also allowing a better defined separation of all the main protein
clusters [29,30]). Groups of homologous proteins are separated, allowing the identification of proteins that very likely share an
identical/similar function. The labels for some groups of proteins discussed in the text or very common are shown: KlcA,
antirestriction protein involved in the broad-host range of IncP plasmids; FinO, RNA chaperone related to repression of sex
pilus formation; CcdB, protein involved in plasmid stability by killing bacteria that lose the plasmid during cell division; TetA and
TetR, proteins responsible for resistance to tetracycline; Bla, β-lactamases; AadA, and DHPT synthase, proteins involved in
resistance to aminoglycosides or sulfonamides, respectively. Tra and Trb, proteins requested for sex pilus formation; Mxi, Spa,
Ipa, Ipg and Osp, proteins that are part of the type III secretion system.

3) Several proteins (about 40% of all the connected
nodes) were found to be mobile elements (transposases,
IS and transposons -related sequences), representing the
most highly connected proteins in the network.
4) As shown in Figure 3, proteins shared by Escherichia,
Salmonella and Shigella plasmids included: a) the
antirestriction protein KlcA involved in the broad-host
range of IncP plasmids [20]; b) the RNA chaperone FinO,
related to repression of sex pilus formation [21,22]; c) the
CcdB protein, which is involved in plasmid stability by
killing bacteria that lose the plasmid [23].
5) Several clusters were composed by proteins shared by
Shigella spp. and Escherichia coli; this finding is in agreement with the notion that they are considered to belong
to the same species [24]. Moreover, several proteins were
shared only by E. coli and Salmonella plasmids, including:
the genetic determinants for antibiotic resistance such as
TetA and TetR [25], β-lactamases (Bla) [25,27], genes for
resistance to amino glycosides (AadA) and sulphonamides (DHPT synthase). A similar scenario was observed
for sex pilus related proteins, such as Tra and Trb proteins:
out of 22 different Tra groups, 21 contain proteins coming
from E. coli and Salmonella, but 3 groups only (TraDI for
DNA transport and TraX for pilin acetylation) have Shigella sequences. Likewise, out of 5 different Trb groups, we
observed Shigella plasmid sequences in a single cluster
(TrbH). Moreover, the proteins TraP, TrbA and TrbJ seem
to be only present in plasmids from E. coli, while all the
other sex pilus related proteins are shared with Salmonella.
These data are in agreement with evidences for recent
transfer of plasmid genes between enteroinvasive
Escherichia and Salmonella [26,27].
Concerning the pathogenesis-related genes, Shigella plasmids seem to have a specific set of these genes, comprising
at least some of the proteins of the type III secretion system (TTS), e.g.: Mxi, Spa, Ipa, Ipg and Osp proteins.
Finally, on the overall observation it appeared that
besides the closer phylogenetic relationships existing
between E. coli and Shigella, plasmid content appeared
more similar among E. coli and Salmonella for what is concerned with antibiotic resistance and sex pilus formation.
Phylogenetic Profiling
Data discussed in the previous paragraphs, that is which
proteins join a given cluster, were stored by B2N into a
text file, which represent the phylogenetic profile of the
dataset used; this can be further used by the program to
calculate two matrices storing the distances between profiles in the two dimensions (i.e. for plasmids and for proteins), as described in Methods. The corresponding
neighbor-joining dendrograms, that describe the similar-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/551

ity in gene content of the plasmids and protein co-occurrence patterns are shown in Figure 4, Figure 5 and
Additional file 4. Data reported in Figure 4 revealed that
most of plasmids does not form tight clusters coherent
with the taxonomic status of their respective host species
(E. coli, Salmonella or Shigella). This finding suggests a
complex evolutionary history of such plasmid replicons
with massive horizontal transfer and gene rearrangements. In particular, plasmid pSFD10 from Salmonella
grouped with two E. coli plasmids (pRK2 and pLG13).
A relevant exception is represented by five Shigella plasmids (pCP301, pSB4 227, pSD1 197, pWR501, and pSS
046) that form a unique clade (which, however, also
includes pC plasmid from Salmonella enterica).
Figure 5 and Additional file 3 report the co-occurrence
clustering for the protein dataset of the selected plasmids.
In general, plasmids are believed to share very few common functions (mainly related to their replication and
mobility), several accessory genes and a complex history
of recombination events among either them or the host
chromosome(s) [28]. Here, we actually show that most of
the co-occurrence clusters are due to protein related to
plasmid transfer (e.g. Trb and Tra proteins). Nevertheless,
several clusters are present showing the co-occurrence of
hypothetical proteins with proteins with predicted functions such as type II secretion proteins and pilins (BfpK),
or with proteins involved in mobilization (MobA, MbkC)
and virulence factors (IroN). These analyses may help in
addressing experimental analyses for elucidating the functional role of these proteins.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we report that the tools implemented by
B2N allow to describe and to visualize in a new way some
of the evolutionary features of plasmid molecules of
Enterobacteriaceae; the most important results obtained
by B2N on the Enterobacteriaceae dataset are related to
the possibility, by means of phylogenetic profiling and
network relationships of proteins, to uncover some of the
molecular history, which shaped the evolution of this
group of plasmids. In particular, data obtained suggested
a large amount of horizontal transfer and rearrangement
of plasmid molecules between E. coli, Salmonella and Shigella. Moreover, interestingly some plasmids from Shigella
share a common history with Salmonella and several
hypothetical proteins form co-occurrence clusters, suggesting possible roles in plasmid maintenance and/or
pathogenesis, which could be investigated by conventional genetic techniques.
The proposed method is general enough to be proposed
as a new tool for comparative genomic analyses of bacteria and can work at least within the range of phylogenetic

distances enabling Blast to find homologs. For this reason, the B2N approach could help solving some questions
linked to the presence of (few) well conserved functions
within plasmid datasets from wide taxonomic ranges (e.g.
functions related to transfer or replication). Moreover,
possible applications of the method could include also
chromosomal replicons, trying to depict histories of gene
rearrangement and integration from plasmid to chromosomes and viceversa.

Figure 2S – Hypergraph of plasmid sequences. Similarity network showing the relationships existing among plasmids listed in Table 1, shown at
two distinct thresholds. Differently from Figure 2, now each node represents a single plasmid and links the overall protein content shared among
entire plasmids. In details, the size of nodes is proportional to the number
of links possessed by a given plasmid, whereas the thickness of links was
computed using p-values of the Jaccard distance calculated in phylogenetic
profiling analysis (see text), hence accounting for an overall estimation of
the shared proteins by each plasmids in respect to the others.
