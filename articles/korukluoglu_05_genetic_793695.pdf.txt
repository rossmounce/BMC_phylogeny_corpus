Abstract
Background: Molecular epidemiologic studies have made significant contributions to measles
surveillance activities by helping to identify source and transmission pathways of the virus. This
report describes the genetic characterization of wild-type measles viruses isolated in Turkey in
2000 and 2001.
Results: Wild-type measles viruses were isolated from 24 cases from five provinces in Turkey
during 2001. The viruses were analyzed using the standard genotyping protocols. All isolates were
classified as genotype D6, the same genotype that was identified in Turkey in previous outbreaks
during 1998.
Conclusion: Turkey has begun implementation of a national program to eliminate measles by
2010. Therefore, this baseline genotype data will provide a means to monitor the success of the
elimination program.

Background
Measles virus (MV), an enveloped virus with a singlestranded, negative sense RNA genome, is a member of the
genus Morbillivirus within the family Paramyxoviridae. MV
is highly contagious and causes a disease characterized by
high fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis and appearance
of a maculopapular rash [1]. In many parts of the world,
vaccination programs have controlled measles. However,
despite the tremendous progress of global measles control, MV is still responsible for the deaths of approximately 700,000 thousand children each year, mostly in

developing countries [2]. Measles remains the most common of vaccine-preventable childhood mortality.
Although MV is considered to be monotypic, genetic variability exists among wild type strains [3]. Genetic characterization of wild-type MVs is based on sequence analysis
of a hypervariable region (450 nt) of the nucleoprotein
(N) gene and the full-length hemagglutinin (H) gene. A
standard nomenclature and analysis protocol for describing the genetic characteristics of wild-type MVs was established by the World Health Organization (WHO) [4-7].

WHO recommends that genetic analysis of MV isolates
should be conducted during all phases of measles control.
Genetic analysis of wild-type MVs has provided an
increasingly comprehensive picture of the worldwide distribution of MV genotypes [8]. Molecular epidemiologic
studies can help to measure transmission pathways and to
clarify epidemiological links during outbreaks. Virologic
surveillance can also help to measure the success of measles vaccination programs by documenting the interruption of transmission of the endemic viral genotype(s)
[9,10].
In 2001, Turkey experienced a large measles epidemic and
the number of reported measles cases was over 30,000
[11]. From October 2000 to August 2001, we isolated MVs
from measles cases in five different provinces of Turkey.
Since Turkey has recently initiated a program to eliminate
measles, this report provides important baseline data that
will allow future molecular epidemiologic studies to help
measure the success of this program.

Results and Discussion
With the exception of one specimen that was collected in
October 2000, the remaining specimens were collected
between February and August in 2001 (Table 1). MV isolates were obtained from 24 specimens collected from

widely dispersed areas of Turkey, including the provinces
of Ankara, Sinop, Diyarbakir, Sirnak, and Ardahan (Figure
1, Table 1). Measles specific IgM antibody was detected in
serum samples from 16 of 20 cases, while serologic results
were not available for 4 cases. The serum samples from 3
of the 4 IgM negative cases were taken 2 days after rash
onset when the sensitivity of IgM detection is low.
Comparison of the N gene sequences of the Turkish
viruses with the sequences of the current of WHO reference strains showed that all 24 Turkish strains were members of genotype D6 (Figure 2). The sequences of the
Turkish viruses were closely related to each other showing
no more than 1.3% nucleotide heterogeneity overall. In
fact, the N gene sequences of 21 of these MV isolates were
identical, though they came from different regions of Turkey. Although the Turkish viruses were clearly in genotype
D6, the sequences of the more recently isolated viruses
formed a distinct group relative to other genotype D6
viruses recently isolated in Germany, Luxembourg, Brazil
and the United States [10,18-20]. However, the nucleotide sequences from the Turkish cluster differed from the
sequences of the non-Turkish viruses by no more than
1.1% overall. The sequence of a single isolate from Ankara
in 2000, MVi/Ankara.TUR/38.00, and a genotype D6 isolate from the 1998 outbreak, MVi/Ankara/10-98-4 [21],

were more closely related to the sequences of the European, and Brazilian genotype D6 viruses than the
sequences of the Turkish cluster (Figure 2).
At present, genotype D7 appears to be the most frequently
detected genotype in Western European countries; however, D6 genotype is still circulating in some European
countries including the Russian Federation [6,19]. Genotype D6 viruses were imported to the United States from
various European countries and Brazil on 13 occasions
between 1997 and 2000; however, after 2000, only 2 genotype D6 viruses were detected in the United States (Rota,
unpublished).
In some parts of Europe, measles is near elimination or
has been eliminated, whereas in others measles is still
endemic [22]. Despite an active vaccination program,
measles has been an endemic disease in Turkey with epidemics occurring every 3–4 years. In 2001, the last epidemic year, over 30.000 cases were reported [11]. The
previous epidemic year was 1998, when more than
27,000 cases were reported. The virologic surveillance
data suggest that viruses in genotype D6 were responsible
for both epidemics and continued to circulate during the
inter-epidemic periods.
To reduce measles morbidity and mortality in Turkey, the
Ministry of Health launched a National Measles Elimination Program in 2002. In parallel with the strategic plan of
the European Regional Office of WHO, the Turkish
national plan targets elimination of measles by 2010 [23].
The plan included a "catch-up" vaccination campaign tar-

geting nearly 20 million children between 9 months and
14 years of age to be conducted in two phases during
December 2003 and 2005 [24]. The National Measles
Plan also includes activities for establishing a laboratory
based surveillance system to monitoring the effectiveness
of the measles elimination program [25]. In Turkey, subnational laboratories from seven selected provinces will
carry out laboratory-based surveillance, each representing
a region of the country. These sub-national laboratories
will perform serologic confirmation of suspected measles
cases. Clinical specimens collected from laboratory-confirmed cases will be sent to the National Measles and
Rubella Laboratory for virus isolation and genotyping.

Conclusion
Genetic analysis of MVs isolated after the measles vaccination campaigns will help to determine if the circulation of
the endemic genotype D6 viruses is interrupted. This analysis would not be possible without the baseline data presented in this report. Turkey is in a unique geographic
position to monitor transmission of measles virus
between Europe, the Middle East and the rest of Asia.
Strengthening virologic surveillance capacity in Turkey
will benefit several WHO regions.

Materials and methods
Clinical specimens
Urine, nasopharyngeal secretions and blood samples were
collected from 24 patients who had acute, febrile maculopapular rash from five different provinces in Turkey. All
clinical samples were collected within six days of rash
onset and transported to Refik Saydam Hygiene Center,
National Measles and Rubella Laboratory in accordance
with standard protocols (Table 1). Isolation of MV was
performed using the B95a cell line (12) for 12 samples
and the COBL cell line (IL-II treated human cord blood
cells, 13) for 15 samples. Syncytia formation, the cytopathic effect (CPE) characteristic of MV infection,
appeared within 1–7 days. When the CPE was advanced
the cultures were harvested and stored at -80°C. All isolates were confirmed as measles by a neutralization test
performed by using monospecific rabbit antibody to the
H protein.
Sequence analysis
RNA was extracted from infected cells using the guanidinium acid-phenol technique [14]. The 450 nucleotides corresponding to the COOH-terminal 150 amino acids of the
N protein were amplified by using a one-step RT-PCR kit
according to manufacturer's protocol (Superscript, Invitrogen). Forward and reverse primers were: 5'GCTATGCCATGGGAGTAGGAGTGG
and
5'CTGGCCCTCGGCCTCTCGCAC,
respectively.
Sequences of the PCR products were derived by automated sequencing with the BigDye terminator VI.I
