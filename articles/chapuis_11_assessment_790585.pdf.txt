plasticity in the Australian plague locust

Abstract
Background: The Australian plague locust, Chortoicetes terminifera, is among the most promising species to unravel the
suites of genes underling the density-dependent shift from shy and cryptic solitarious behaviour to the highly active and
aggregating gregarious behaviour that is characteristic of locusts. This is because it lacks many of the major phenotypic
changes in colour and morphology that accompany phase change in other locust species. Reverse transcription-quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the most sensitive method available for determining changes in gene expression.
However, to accurately monitor the expression of target genes, it is essential to select an appropriate normalization strategy
to control for non-specific variation between samples. Here we identify eight potential reference genes and examine their
expression stability at different rearing density treatments in neural tissue of the Australian plague locust.
Results: Taking advantage of the new orthologous DNA sequences available in locusts, we developed primers for genes
encoding 18SrRNA, ribosomal protein L32 (RpL32), armadillo (Arm), actin 5C (Actin), succinate dehydrogenase (SDHa),
glyceraldehyde-3P-dehydrogenase (GAPDH), elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1a) and annexin IX (AnnIX). The relative
transcription levels of these eight genes were then analyzed in three treatment groups differing in rearing density (isolated,
short- and long-term crowded), each made up of five pools of four neural tissue samples from 5th instar nymphs. SDHa and
GAPDH, which are both involved in metabolic pathways, were identified as the least stable in expression levels, challenging
their usefulness in normalization. Based on calculations performed with the geNorm and NormFinder programs, the best
combination of two genes for normalization of gene expression data following crowding in the Australian plague locust was
EF1a and Arm. We applied their use to studying a target gene that encodes a Ca2+ binding glycoprotein, SPARC, which was
previously found to be up-regulated in brains of gregarious desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria. Interestingly, expression of
this gene did not vary with rearing density in the same way in brains of the two locust species. Unlike S. gregaria, there was
no effect of any crowding treatment in the Australian plague locust.
Conclusion: Arm and EF1a is the most stably expressed combination of two reference genes of the eight examined for
reliable normalization of RT-qPCR assays studying density-dependent behavioural change in the Australian plague locust.
Such normalization allowed us to show that C. terminifera crowding did not change the neuronal expression of the SPARC
gene, a gregarious phase-specific gene identified in brains of the desert locust, S. gregaria. Such comparative results on
density-dependent gene regulation provide insights into the evolution of gregarious behaviour and mass migration of
locusts. The eight identified genes we evaluated are also candidates as normalization genes for use in experiments involving
other Oedipodinae species, but the rank order of gene stability must necessarily be determined on a case-by-case basis.

Background
Locusts are an excellent model organism for analyses of
phenotypic plasticity in behaviour and other traits [1].
Plastic phenotypic responses to crowding are expressed
to varying degrees among insects in the orders Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, and Orthoptera [2]. The
expression of phase polyphenism, in which individuals
can undergo extreme density-dependent changes in
behaviour, physiology, colour and morphology, is a
defining feature of locusts (Orthoptera: Acrididae) [3].
Among this complex suite of traits, behaviour is the first
to respond to changes in local population density and
lies at the heart of swarm formation and migration [1].
Locusts reared under low population density conditions
develop into the shy and cryptic solitarious phase,
whereas rearing at high population density results in the
highly active and aggregating gregarious phase. As local
population size increases, patchy resource distributions
in a habitat tend to concentrate solitarious phase
locusts. Cues associated with contact among individuals
on these resources mediate the process of phase change,
referred to as gregarization, and cause initially solitarious phase locusts to become attracted rather than
repelled by others [4]. A positive feedback loop is then
established that can drive an initially solitarious population into the swarming gregarious phase [1].
Along with major advances in our understanding of
locust behaviour and ecology, substantial progress has
been made toward understanding the neurophysiological
mechanisms underlying the process of behavioural
phase change [3]. However, unravelling the molecular
genetic basis of the shift from solitarious to gregarious
behaviours remains the “final frontier” in locust research
[3]. In recent years, insight into the putative functions
of specific candidate genes involved in phase polyphenism has been obtained through gene expression profiling
analyses under different density conditions [5-7]. Moreover, Rahman et al. [8] applied the differential display
PCR method [9] for locust brain tissue, the findings of
which were confirmed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The differential display PCR method systematically detects changes in mRNA profiles without
the need for any prior knowledge of genomic information of the study organism. Functional genomics
resources have also been developed for key locust species that will further foster the exploration of nonhypothesis driven high-throughput gene expression data
resulting from microarrays [10-12]. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect gene expression studies to become
increasingly prominent in analyses of locust phase polyphenism. These techniques will likely be extended to
other non-model taxa provided they bear sufficient
genetic similarity.

Although at least 23 grasshopper species show elements of density-dependent phase polyphenism, our
understanding of locust behaviour is primarily based on
studies of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, and to
a lesser extent, the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria
[3]. The Australian plague locust, Chortoicetes terminifera, is one of Australia’s most significant agricultural
pests and has recently emerged as a new model of considerable interest for studying the transition between the
two behavioural phases. Despite the lack of striking
changes in colour and morphology, which are seen so
prominently in L. migratoria and S. gregaria, C. terminifera was recently shown to exhibit full density-dependent behavioural gregarization within days of crowding
[13,14]. Therefore, the quantification of density-dependent transcriptional responses in C. terminifera might
be particularly suited to identify the suite of genes
underlying locust behaviour plasticity, as it may avoid
confounding transcriptional changes associated with the
expression of additional density-dependent traits seen
notably in other locust species [13]. Furthermore,
because the ability to change phase from solitarious to
gregarious in response to increased population density
has evolved multiple times within the grasshopper
family Acrididae and resulted in a phylogenetically heterogeneous group of ‘locusts’ [15-17], comparison of differential gene transcription across C. terminifera, L.
migratoria and S. gregaria may provide insights into the
evolution of gregarious behaviour and mass migration
[13].
Reverse transcription-quantitative Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-qPCR) is the most reproducible and sensitive method available to measure mRNA transcription
levels for individual genes, and is often used to confirm
results from high-throughput systems like microarrays.
However, the quality of results is directly related to data
normalization that eliminates template heterogeneity
due to variations in initial sample amount, mRNA
recovery and integrity, and reverse transcription efficiency [18,19]. The most common normalization technique uses internal standards, mainly housekeeping genes,
so called because their transcription occurs in all
nucleated cell types since they are necessary for cell survival [20]. The expression of housekeeping genes is
often presumed to be stable across experimental procedures and cell types. Despite this assumption, numerous
studies have shown that such housekeeping genes can
be differentially expressed, thereby compromising their
use as stable internal standards (e.g. [21]).
To avoid bias from normalization, the stable expression of candidate reference genes should be validated
under specific experimental conditions. The use of a
suite of multiple stably-expressed reference genes is

Chapuis et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2011, 12:7
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/12/7

currently the gold standard [19,20,22]. To this aim, statistical approaches have been developed to determine
the best-suited genes for normalization from a panel of
candidate genes in a given set of biological samples [e.g.
[23,24]]. Accordingly, studies of the transcriptional stability of reference genes are becoming more common.
Yet, to our knowledge, the only insects for which suites
of reference genes have been validated and published
are those of a few model organisms, namely Apis mellifera [25,26], Tribolium castaneaum [27] and Bombyx
mori [28], as well as those of Bombus terrestris and
lucorum [29], Liposcelis bostrychophila [30], and S. gregaria [31].
The study of Van Hiel et al. [31] in the desert locust,
S. gregaria, provides an initial set of reference genes to
be evaluated for rearing density-controlled experiments
in locusts. The authors validated seven reference genes
for their stability during development in brains, which
are of critical importance to the neuronal and neuroendocrine processes involved in behaviour. However, the
stable expression of these genes across the different
rearing density treatments that must be imposed for
analyses of density-dependent phase polyphenism in
locusts has not yet been examined. In the present study,
we used the S. gregaria mRNA sequences from Van
Hiel et al. [31], supplemented with data on L. migratoria
[11], which is a member of the same subfamily as C. terminifera (Oedipodinae), to identify partial sequences for
8 orthologs of putative housekeeping genes in C. terminifera. We evaluated the stability of these genes in
neural tissue as candidates for normalization in RTqPCR assays to study transcriptional-changes involved
in the initiation and maintenance of density-dependent
behavioural phase change in the Australian plague
locust. We then applied our RT-qPCR normalization in
studying the variation in expression across treatment
groups of the gregarious phase-specific gene identified
by Rahman et al. [8] in brains of S. gregaria. This gene
which was found to be dominantly expressed in
crowded gregarious phase locusts [8], shares high
homology with the gene that encodes the Ca2+ binding
glycoprotein SPARC (Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich
in Cysteine). It modulates cell adhesion, is essential to
mesoderm development and affects mobility [32-34].
The final overall goal in this study was to develop an
accurate and comprehensive method of RT-qPCR for
use in studies of locust phase polyphenism that complies
with MIQE recommendations for essential quality information [19].

Results
Sample purity and concentration

RNA integrity was confirmed using denaturing gel electrophoresis and visualisation of intact rRNA subunits of

28S and 18S. The rRNA bands from C. terminifera samples were ~1.8 and 2.3 kb, the former showing greater
intensity. The 28S rRNA (4-5 kb) of most invertebrates
dissociates into two subunits under denaturing conditions due to the breaking of a phosphodiester bond in
the primary structure, referred to as the ‘hidden break’
by Ishikawa [35]. It is likely that the site of the hidden
break in the 28S molecule is determined by the size of
the 18S rRNA (1.8 kb) [35]. At least one of the 28S fragments resulting from the hidden break is expected to
have the same or similar electrophoretic mobility to 18S
rRNA. Our gel banding pattern suggests that the intense
1.8 kb band contains the 18S rRNA and a smaller fragment of the 28S rRNA while the larger fragment of the
28S molecule is 2.3 kb. Formaldehyde (denaturing) agarose gels of the 15 C. terminifera total RNA samples can
be seen in Additional file 1.
RNA quantities were assessed with a Nanodrop ND1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies) and
ranged between 153 and 368 ng μL -1 of total RNA.
Interestingly, pooled brains and thoracic ganglia from
long-term crowded samples yielded 40% more total
RNA than those from either the isolated or 24 hcrowded groups (t-tests, P = 0.03). This could possibly
result from larger brain sizes of 5th instar nymphs reared
under long-term crowded condition as recently shown
by Ott and Rogers [36] in the desert locust. All samples
were assumed adequately free from protein contamination and (organic) salts since they showed 260/280 and
260/230 nm ratios higher than 1.9 and 1.7 respectively.
Additional file 2 provides further details about total
RNA sample purity and concentration.
Expression level and PCR efficiency

Six out of the 360 PCR reactions led to unexpected melt
temperatures and were discarded. Figure 1 shows that
all candidate reference genes except 18SrRNA were
moderately abundant, with Cq values averaging from 20
for EF1a to 30 for RpL32. Expression of 18SrRNA was
high in the tested samples, with Cq values averaging 9.5.
The maximal standard deviation of Cq values for the
three replicates was 0.42 over all biological samples
and primer pairs (i.e. coefficient of variation of 1.4%).
Table 1 shows the efficiency of RT-qPCR amplification
for each primer pair. All but one slope of standard
curves were -3.9 to -3.3, which translates in PCR efficiencies to 1.8- 2 fold increases per cycle. The exception
was Actin with a slope of -4.5, i.e. PCR efficiency of 1.66
fold increase per cycle. The mean square errors of
regression were between 0.01 and 0.08, below the
recommended threshold of 0.2. The standard deviations
of the estimated PCR efficiencies are reported in
Table 1 from duplicated standard curves. All but one
standard deviations were below 0.05 (i.e. coefficient of

variation of 2.5%). Standard deviation reached 0.10 for
SDHa (i.e. coefficient of variation of 5% ).

Any potential genomic DNA amplification of EF1a and
GAPDH genes can be detected through the melt temperatures, which markedly differed from that of cDNA
amplicons. In addition, gDNA Cq values for both genes
were ≥ 10 cycles larger than the highest observed Cq
value from our diluted cDNA samples (see Figure 1 for
ranges of Cq values in our assay). The PCR inefficiency
and different amplicon identity may result from partial
and non-specific annealing although one primer spans
exon-exon boundaries for both genes (see Additional file
3 for alignment data). In contrast, 18SrRNA and RpL32
primers amplified gDNA and cDNA fragments of similar
size and melt temperature. gDNA Cq values were similar
to those from our diluted cDNA samples, which makes
these two genes susceptible to potential gDNA contamination in RT-qPCR. Nevertheless, none of the noRT
samples were found to amplify these two genes in the
present study. This is perhaps because the gDNA concentration was too low to result in a detectable product
and thus all the samples were considered as noncontaminated.
Expression stability

Potential for gDNA amplification

Table 2 shows that primer pairs for Arm, Actin, SDHa,
and AnnIX to be used in RT-qPCR runs failed to
amplify genomic DNA. This is most likely because the
primers flank an intron (e.g. see Actin in Additional file
3) which is too large for the 20s extension time in the
PCR protocol (see Methods). An amplicon of 500 bp
requires at least 20s extension time (LightCycler 480
SYBR Green I Master manual, version Feb 2008), so any
target exceeding this length would fail to amplify.

Table 3 shows that geNorm and NormFinder softwares
ranked the eight candidate reference genes similarly.
The four most stable genes were found to be Actin,
EF1a, 18SrRNA, and Arm by both programs. Actin and
EF1a was found to be the most stably expressed pair of
genes in geNorm. Levels of pairwise variation between
two sequential normalization factors were all below the
cut-off value of 0.15 (see Additional file 4). In addition,
the threshold for an unstable gene in geNorm is an average expression stability measure of 1.5, far above our

Gene expression of a target gene

In order to apply the selected set of reliable reference
genes, we analyzed the relative expression of a target
gene in the nymphal brains of C. terminifera under different crowding conditions. We designed forward and
reverse primers (F-TCTGGAAATGGTGTGACTTGG
and R-ATAAGTGGAGCACGGATTG) for RT-qPCR
using primer sequences conserved within the SPARC
orthologs for L. migratoria (LMC_004100 in LocustDB;
[11]) and S. gregaria (AY751536; [8]). Size (85 bp) and
singularity of PCR product was confirmed with gel electrophoresis and sequencing. PCR reaction efficiency
with SPARC RT-qPCR primers at 0.5 μM was 1.80 (fold
increase per cycle). No change in SPARC gene expression could be detected when comparing long-term or
24 hour crowded insects to solitary insects (P = 0.801
and 0.631). These results were obtained by using EF1a
and Arm as reference genes and in-run PCR efficiency
estimates. Using Actin and EF1a for normalization gave
similar p-values and expression ratios.

maximal observed value of 0.212 for the least stable gene,
SDHa. Thus, geNorm examination suggests that all eight
candidate genes are stable enough to be used for normalization, and the addition of a third gene to the normalization is not imperative. The most stably expressed gene
selected by NormFinder was Actin followed by EF1a then
18SrRNA. The best stability measure for a pairwise combination with Actin was provided by 18SrRNA (0.030)
followed closely by EF1a (0.031). When comparing the
long-term crowded and isolated groups only, Actin and
EF1a remained the two reference genes of choice by
using both programs (results not shown). EF1a and Actin
also remained as the most stable genes when compared
between 24 h crowded and isolated locusts (results not
shown). Because the use of rRNA (as opposed to mRNA
transcript) for normalization is debated due to its great
abundance (see Discussion) and Actin primer pair efficiency was restrained (i.e. Efficiency = 1.66, see Table 1),
we performed the geNorm and NormFinder analyses

Discussion
Knowledge of mRNA transcription levels in response to
crowding is central to understanding the molecular
mechanisms and evolution of density-dependent phase
polyphenism in locusts. Now that high-throughput systems are becoming more widely available, gene expression studies and in particular the use of RT-qPCR will
become even more important for molecular genetics
and evolutionary research in locusts. However, successful RT-qPCR experiments require multiple, carefully
validated, reference genes to allow for reliable data normalization and determination of differentially expressed
genes.

In this study, we identified eight appropriate reference
genes that show invariant expression in neural tissue of
the Australian plague locust, whether reared in a solitary
state or exposed to different durations of crowding. All
of the genes we evaluated were classified as stably
expressed as each presented with geNorm stability
indexes well below the cut-off of 1.5 [23]. In this study,
we provide a comprehensive assessment of these reference genes for use in subsequent RT-qPCR assays.
Amongst the eight candidate housekeeping genes evaluated, Actin and EF1a were selected as the most stable
pair by both geNorm and NormFinder. Although Vandesompele et al. [23] recommend the use of at least
three reference genes for reliable normalization, the
pairwise variation analysis in geNorm indicated that
there is no need to include more than two genes. If we
assume that stability is likely to be consistent across
locust species, our results may serve as a posteriori validation of the use of Actin as a reference gene in previous studies of rearing density effect on locust gene
expression patterns [5,6,8]. When comparing our results
to the study of reference genes in brains of the desert
locust, S. gregaria [31], we see that EF1a was also validated as stable with age in brains of fifth- instar nymphs
and adults of the desert locust, S. gregaria. In contrast,
Actin was excluded for normalization of transcriptional
studies in brains of ageing adults. Interestingly, despite
being amongst the most abundant proteins in all eukaryotic cells, with key roles in cell motility and cytoskeleton maintenance, Actins have been shown to vary in
transcript levels with growth and ageing, at least in
mammals [21]. The different ranking of the Actin gene
across studies underlines the necessity for validation of
the candidate reference genes prior to an experiment
utilizing different treatments.
The 18S ribosomal subunit was classified as the third
most stable gene in our study (Table 3). However, caution should be exercised when using 18SrRNA as a
reference control. First, as ribosomal subunits are not
polyadenylated they cannot be exploited in purified
mRNA samples, i.e. in Reverse-Transcriptase reactions
primed with oligo-dT. This was addressed in this experiment by using random hexamer primers only. Second,
the high abundance of rRNA molecules compared with
target mRNA transcripts, as revealed here by relatively
low Cq values for 18SrRNA, makes it difficult to subtract the baseline value in fluorescence data analysis
[23]. In the present study, accurate fluorescence treatment was only possible by a large dilution of the RTqPCR template (i.e. 100-fold, equivalent of 0.25 ng total
RNA). Furthermore, because 18SrRNA is so abundant,
representing up to 80% of cellular RNA, it is expected
that variations from sample-to-sample in initial sample
amount, mRNA recovery and integrity, and reverse

Page 6 of 11

transcription efficiency, will be more difficult to detect.
Furthermore, 18SrRNA is likely to experience RT-qPCR
kinetics that are different to those of less abundantly
expressed genes [37]. As a consequence of these factors,
18S rRNA can reduce the sensitivity to detect variation
in relative levels of expression [38]. Because it is more
likely to be expressed at a comparable order of magnitude as the investigated targets, we suggest that Arm
will be a best suitable third normalizer in gene expression studies of locust neural tissues that address either
the initiation or the maintenance of phase differences.
In our study, the two least stable genes were GAPDH
and SDHa that code for the metabolic pathways
enzymes, glycolysis and citrate cycle, respectively.
Kristensen et al. [39] showed in Drosophila melanogaster
that genes involved in metabolic processes are differentially expressed in response to heat stress. In particular,
both glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate and succinate dehydrogenases were down-regulated at 36°C versus 25°C. This
indicates that housekeeping metabolism is a dynamic
process that can be regulated under different physiological states, thus challenging the usefulness of genes
involved in metabolic processes in normalization.
Crowded conditions themselves might be predicted to
impose physiological stresses that can affect gene transcription. Accordingly, heat shock proteins, which are
synthesized in response to stress in insects and act as
molecular chaperones to mediate numerous cellular
functions, have been shown to be up-regulated in heads
of crowded gregarious phase migratory locusts [7].
RT-qPCR reactions showed a linear concentrationdilution relationship and were highly efficient, as every
cycle of reaction amplification increased the amount of
DNA template by 1.90-2 fold. The two exceptions were
Armadillo and Actin primer pairs which respectively
showed a moderate and low 1.81 and 1.66 fold increase
per cycle. An exponential amplification of 2 (±10%), as
retrieved for most of primer pairs, is needed when using
the delta-delta-Cq quantification model as originally
described by Livak and Schmittgen [40]. However, the
most common efficiency-corrected methods currently in
use for relative quantification [41] do not assume that
all targets amplify with the same optimal PCR efficiency.
Instead, efficiencies must be calculated prior to quantification, be reproducible and preferably be validated in
each target gene RT-qPCR run. Our reaction efficiencies
were shown to be reproducible, and therefore should be
the same between standards and all of the samples in
each of the future qPCR assays. However, we suggest to
adopt the more conservative approach of avoiding low
efficiency primer pairs (i.e. Actin), which would suggest
EF1a and Arm as the best combination of two reference
genes. These reference genes do not present any risk of
misleading gDNA amplification.

Chapuis et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2011, 12:7
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/12/7

We applied the use of EF1a and Arm for accurate
normalization in gene expression studies of locust
neural tissue by studying the target gene SPARC shown
to be up-regulated in gregarious brains of desert locusts.
We showed that 24 hours of crowding did not change
the expression of SPARC in brains and thoracic ganglia
of the Australian plague locust. Similarly, no expression
change was detected with longer crowding. Similar
results were found when using Actin as sole normalizer
following Rahman et al. [8]. The discrepancy in SPARC
expression between this and earlier studies may have
arisen from other differences in experimental procedures; in particular, neural tissues were dissected from
4-5 day old adults in Rahman et al. [8], as opposed to 2day old 5 th -instar nymphs in our study, and SPARC
expression is known to be developmentally regulated
(reviewed in [42]). We might also expect S. gregaria and
C. terminifera to differ in the density-dependence regulation of the glycoprotein, as their high density gregarious phase express different suites of behavioural [13,14]
and morphological traits [43]. However, since the role of
the SPARC protein with respect to density-dependent
changes in behaviour or any other trait remain
unknown, this alternative cannot be examined further as
part of this study.
The reference genes we selected for gene expression
normalization will provide a promising starting point for
further studies of density-dependent transcriptional
changes in the Australian plague locust. Now that
appropriate primers had been identified for a range of
potential reference genes, validation tests for other gene
expression studies involving experimental treatments
other than rearing density can also be performed in a
relatively straightforward manner. Our findings should
also facilitate the selection and use of suitable reference
genes in the related migratory locust, L. migratoria, as
the primers we used target the cDNA sequences of this
species too. The possibility also remains that the primer
sequences presented in this study are conserved across
other members of the Oedipodinae which includes at
least seven other species that show elements of densitydependent phase polyphenism [3].

Conclusion
We propose that EF1a and Arm primer pairs evaluated
here be used for accurate and reliable normalization of
RT-qPCR results in gene expression studies in neural
tissues of the Australian plague locust under different
rearing density conditions.
Methods
Locust culture and experimental samples

A C. terminifera rearing colony was established in 2006
with approximately 25,000 locusts from north central

Page 7 of 11

Victoria (35°55’S, 144°25’E) and southwestern Western
Australia (30°40’S, 116°15’E). The culture has since been
maintained under crowded conditions with thousands of
egg-pods establishing each generation. As a result,
genetic variation among the individuals was recently
shown to be substantial at neutral microsatellite loci,
with 83% of the alleles and 97% of the gene diversity
found in the field being retained in the lab [44]. In this
study, we generated expression profiles of the reference
gene transcripts from solitarious and gregarious phase
locusts that had been reared long term under either isolated or crowded conditions, respectively, as well as solitarious phase individuals that had been subjected to
short-term crowding for 24 hours as described below.
Crowd-reared juveniles were reared from hatching in 30
cm 3 steel mesh cages at densities of 200 - 300 locusts
comparable to those of outbreaking field populations of C.
terminifera [45,46]. First-instar nymphs were collected
from the gregarious culture from different cages, each
initiated with a minimum of 30 egg-pods, to establish isolated-reared cohorts in a separate constant temperature
room with the same temperature (32°C) and photoperiod
(14:10 L:D) as crowded-reared locusts (see Gray et al. [13]
for further details on crowd- and isolated- rearing conditions). Behavioural phase change in the Australian plague
locust does not accumulate across generations as known
to occur in other locust species, but shifts completely
within days in response to a change in immediate rearing
density [13]. Therefore, we considered 5th instar isolated
nymphs to be fully solitarious, and their comparison to the
long-term crowded locusts of similar age can potentially
identify genes involved in the maintenance of behavioural
differences between the phases. Given that behavioural
phase change in C. terminifera begins to occur within just
6 hours of crowding [14], we also included a treatment
group of solitarious 5th instar nymphs that had been
removed from their individual rearing cages 24 h postecdysis and been crowded as described above for only 24
hours to examine the stability of putative reference genes
between relatively short versus long-term gregarious phase
insects. The three rearing density treatment groups are
hereafter referred as to isolated, long-term crowded and
24 h-crowded.
All locusts from each of the three different treatments
were removed from their rearing cages the day of their
5th ecdysis and marked on the pronotum with correction fluid (Office Max) and coloured ink (Staedtler permanent Lumocolor) depending on their treatment. All
locust neural tissues were dissected the second day of
the 5th larval stage. The brain, optic lobes and the three
thoracic ganglia of each insect were dissected with
RNAse-free instruments under a binocular microscope
and immediately immersed in RNAlater (Ambion). Tissue samples from each individual were kept in RNAlater

overnight at 4°C and then stored at -80°C until RNA
extraction, which was performed on pooled tissues of 2
males and 2 females. Five replicates of such pooled samples were analyzed for each of the three groups (longterm crowded, isolated, and 24 h-crowded).

and internal to the amplicon. Primers were verified for
specificity in silico using the L. migratoria transcriptome
available at LocustDB [11] and MFEPrimer [54] at
default settings. Size and singularity of PCR products
was confirmed with gel electrophoresis.

Candidate reference genes and primer design

RNA isolation, reverse transcription and qPCR

Details on the candidate reference genes examined are
given in Table 4. Because no genome or full transcriptome sequence data is currently available for C. terminifera, a first set of primers was developed based on
orthologous sequences from different insects, including
L. migratoria (EST database LocustDB; [11]) and S. gregaria [31]. Accession numbers for orthologs and primer
sequences are available in Additional file 5. For all study
genes except 18SrRNA, PCR products varying in size
from 305 to 937 bp were generated from C. terminifera
cDNA templates. PCR products obtained from C. terminifera gDNA for EF1a, GAPDH, and Actin, were also
sequenced to determine exon-intron boundaries (see
Additional file 3). We were unable to amplify the other
genes of interest, i.e. Arm, RpL32, SDHa, and AnnIX
from gDNA, suggesting the presence of large introns.
Products for EF1a, GAPDH, and Actin were cloned
before sequencing to rule out the presence of multiple
loci such has already been reported in some fish and
crustaceans [47-49].
RT-qPCR primers were designed from C. terminifera
cDNA sequences using Primer3Plus [50] with the amplified fragment length kept between 90 and 175 base pairs
(see Table 1 for further details on primer pairs). Parameters for primer and dimer complementarities were
set by default. In order to optimize PCR efficiency, we
checked amplicons for secondary structures at the site
of primer binding [51] with UNAFold using the DINAMelt web server [52,53]. Additionally, we avoided stable
helix formations both within primer DNA sequences

For the preparation of each total RNA sample, pooled
neural tissue (≤ 20 mg) was disrupted and homogenized in
1 ml Trizol (Ambion) using a Tissue Lyser (Qiagen) operating at 25 Hz for 40 s with 7 mm stainless steel beads.
The homogenized samples were incubated for 15 minutes
at room temperature and then centrifuged at 12,000 g for
10 minutes at 4°C. We decanted off 0.8 ml which was then
vigorously mixed with 0.2 ml of chloroform. The RNAcontaining upper aqueous phase was recovered after spinning at 12,000 g for 20 minutes at 4°C and 0.350 ml was
transferred to a Qiagen genomic DNA eliminator spin column. The remaining steps were carried out according to
Qiagen’s RNeasy® Plus Mini Kit instructions (i.e. from
step 4 in the version from Oct 2005). Eluted total RNA
samples were further subjected to a RNase-free DNAse I
treatment (Ambion). A combination of on-column and insolution DNase treatment was used to minimize genomic
DNA contamination [51].
First strand cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng total
RNA using the Superscript III VILO cDNA Synthesis
kit (Invitrogen) with random hexamer primers according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. All samples were reverse
transcribed together in a single run. We pooled together
5 μl of each cDNA sample to determine reaction efficiency of each of the qPCR assays by means of a standard curve consisting of ten-fold diluted samples
(equivalent to a range of 0.005 to 5 ng total RNA).
Remaining cDNA samples were diluted 20- (for SDHa
only) or 100-fold with PCR-grade water (equivalent of
1.25 and 0.25 ng total RNA, respectively).

Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was performed in
a 384-well block using a LightCycler 480 Instrument
(Roche Diagnostics). Every PCR assay contained a final
volume of 5 μl, including 2.5 μl 2 × SYBR-Green I Master
Mix (Roche Diagnostics), 1 μl diluted cDNA template, 0.25
to 0.5 μl (250 to 500 nM final concentration; see Table 1)
of each primer, and nuclease free water. PCR was carried
out with an initial 10 min hot start activation of the polymerase at 95°C followed by 45 cycles of 10 sec denaturation
at 95°C, 10 sec annealing at 60°C, and 20 sec extension at
72°C. Melt curve analysis was performed after completion
of the thermal PCR program, 55-90°C with increments rising by 0.5°C each step and a 5s hold at each degree. This
ensured the resulting fluorescence of PCR products originated from the single PCR product of interest rather than
primer dimers or non-specific PCR products. Samples were
run in triplicate and standard curves were included in each
PCR run. In addition, a no-template control (NTC) was
included for each primer pair. We used a Biomek NXP
Span-8 Laboratory Automation Workstation (Beckman
Coulter) to limit technical errors in pipetting.
Prior to the quantitative PCR assay, PCR cycling was
performed on control reactions without reverse transcriptase (noRTs) for all cDNA samples and primer pairs.
Finally, a gDNA template was also run for each primer
pair to determine their sensitivity to gDNA contamination.
We used an intentionally large amount of gDNA template
(5 ng), equal to that of the least diluted sample of the standard curve (in equivalent of total RNA).
Statistical treatment

The fluorescence data were processed using LightCycler
480 software version 1.5.0 (Roche Diagnostics) with two
different methods, namely the absolute quantification fit
point and second derivative methods. Because it was
highly accurate and reproducible, we hereafter present
results from the second derivative method only (details
on the fit point method and results can be found in
Additional file 6). Quantitative cycles (Cq) are determined from the amplification curve’s second derivative
maximum, which corresponds to the point where the
acceleration of the fluorescence signal is at its maximum
[55]. This method assumes that the curve shape is more
predictive of starting concentration than is the fluorescence level of the curve [56]. The background fluorescence was computed as the arithmetic mean of cycles 2
to 6 and subtracted from the fluorescence values. The
mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation of
the raw triplicate Cq values were determined. For each
primer pair, biological samples whose coefficient of variation was greater than 1.5% were inspected; a replicate
reaction was considered an outlier if it deviated more
than one standard deviation from the mean and was
excluded from analysis [57].

Page 9 of 11

To identify the optimal normalization genes among our
set of candidates, we used software programs, geNorm
[23] and NormFinder [24]. Both programs rank the candidate reference genes according to their expression stability in a given sample set where an increase in the
program-designated value correlates with a decrease in
gene expression stability. geNorm measures the expression stability of a reference gene as the average pairwise
variation for that gene with all other tested reference
genes. The program geNorm also calculates the pairwise
variation between two sequential normalization factors to
determine the optimal number of reference genes
required for normalization. A pairwise variation value
above 0.15 indicates that the added gene has a significant
effect and should preferably be included in the normalization. Contrary to geNorm, NormFinder determines the
stability of a reference gene based on the experimental
design, with top-ranked genes having the least variation
accumulated within and between groups (i.e. long-term
crowded, isolated, and 24 h-crowded in this study). The
gene with the smallest quality value is then selected and
its value combined with each of the other genes to produce a stability measure for the combination of two
genes. Both tools require the transformation of Cq values
to linear scale expression quantities. For each gene, mean
Cq values of the 15 biological samples were converted
into relative quantities by using the formula E-(Cq[control]
-Cq[sample])
, with E denoting the exponential amplification
efficiency (E = 10-(1/-slope of the standard curve)) and the sample with the lowest mean Cq value used as a control [58].
We evaluated the reproducibility of PCR amplification
efficiency for all pairs of primers by using constant reaction conditions but a different cDNA sample in a different run plate.
To estimate potential up or down regulation of the
SPARC gene in response to our different rearing density
treatments, we used the software REST 2009 [59] with
2,000 random pairings of untreated controls (i.e. isolation) and treatment samples (i.e. crowding) to calculate
confidence intervals and estimate the statistical significance of calculated expression ratios. The software calculates an efficiency-corrected relative quantity for each
randomization pair by using the formula E-(Cq[control] -Cq
[sample])
. The expression ratio is then normalized using
the geometric average of the relative quantity values for
the two most stably-expressed reference genes selected
by geNorm and NormFinder.

and total RNA (Ct3A) templates for GAPDH, Actin, and EF1a. The
primer sequences for RT-qPCR are also provided. Amongst the 10 cloned
PCR products, sequence variants that differed by a single nucleotide
change were considered to result from artificial substitutions due to misincorporation during the PCR process. Indeed, by considering an error
rate for the Pfu polymerase of 2 × 10-6 per bp per duplication [60-62],
the maximum expected numbers of bp changes per independent PCR
was 0.08 for 35 cycles of PCR amplification (i.e. assuming a length of
1151 bp, which is that of the Actin gDNA sequence). Based on this error
rate, we should expect no more than one mutation due to PCR misincorporation among 10 cloned sequences.

Additional file 4: Determination of the optimal number of reference
genes required for normalization using geNorm. The program
calculates the pairwise variation (V) between two sequential
normalization factors (in x-axis). V2/3 indicates the variation in the
normalization factor using two versus three genes. A large pairwise
variation V indicates that the added gene has a significant effect and
should preferably be included in the normalization. Vandesompele et al.
[23] suggest that the cut-off value for such significance should be 0.15.
