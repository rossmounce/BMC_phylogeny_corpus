Abstract
Parainfluenza virus is an important pathogen threatening the health of animals and human, which brings human
many kinds of disease, especially lower respiratory tract infection involving infants and young children. In order to
control the virus, it is necessary to fully understand the molecular basis resulting in the genetic diversity of the
virus. Homologous recombination is one of mechanisms for the rapid change of genetic diversity. However, as a
negative-strand virus, it is unknown whether the recombination can naturally take place in human PIV. In this
study, we isolated and identified a mosaic serotype 3 human PIV (HPIV3) from in China, and also provided several
putative PIV mosaics from previous reports to reveal that the recombination can naturally occur in the virus. In
addition, two swine PIV3 isolates transferred from cattle to pigs were found to have mosaic genomes. These results
suggest that homologous recombination can promote the genetic diversity and potentially bring some novel
biologic characteristics of HPIV.
Introduction
Human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) is known to induce
acute respiratory infections (ARI) including lower
respiratory tract infection, which is a leading cause of
morbidity and mortality in infants and young children
[1,2]. Until now, four serotypes of parainfluenza virus
(PIV) infecting human being have been found. Especially, human PIV (HPIV) 1, 2 and 3 are the second
leading causative agents of pediatric hospitalizations due
to respiratory disease following respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV) [3]. It is important to know the mechanism
resulting in genetic and antigenic diversity of HPIV for
controlling the pathogen.
As one member of the Respirovirus ge nus of the
family Paramyxoviridae, HPIV is an enveloped non-segmented negative single-stranded RNA virus [4]. RNA
viruses usually exhibit genetic variation, which can be
attributed to their high rate of mutation during their
replication process and the large population size [5]. In
addition, homologous recombination has been recognized increasingly as a potentially important means of
generating and shaping genetic diversity in positive

strand RNA virus [6]. In several other members of the
Paramyxoviridae family, Newcastle disease virus (NDV)
[7-11] and human respiratory syncytial virus [12], natural recombinants have been detected. Moreover, attenuated vaccines were found to be able to influence the
evolution process of NDV through exchanging their
genetic material with circulating virus [7,9,11]. For
HPIV, it is unknown whether there is natural recombinant virus circulating in the field.
In this study, we isolated and identified a natural type
3 HPIV mosaic isolate LZ22/FJ455842 (with a mosaic N
gene) to show that homologous recombination can
occur in HPIV3. Additionally, three HPIV1 isolates
(HT88/U01082, HT89a/U01083 and HT89c/U01085)
were found to be deposited in previous report. Interestingly, we also found that there were the two Swine PIV3
recombinants with mosaic L protein were thought to be
associated with an cross-species infection in previous
report [13,14]. Collectively, these recombination events
suggested that homologous recombination played a role
in HPIV genetic diversity and rapid evolution.

Results and Discussion
The sequence of LZ22 complete genome has been
deposited in GenBank (Access Number, FJ455842). And

was analyzed employing RDP3 software package for
scanning the recombinant sequence. And the isolate
LZ22 was found to have greatly strong recombination
signal: RDP, p-value < 10-21; GENECOVY, p-value < 1021
, Bootscan, p-value < 10-20 , MaxChi p-value < 10 -3 ;
Chimaera p-value < 10-7; Siscan, p-value < 10-8, 3Seq, pvalue < 10-13. And a breakpoint was located at position
485. Two strains GP and ZHYMgz01 were suggested as
representatives of its putative parent lineages.
And then, Simplot software package was used to
determine the recombination event [15]. Employing the
Findsites subprogram of SimPlot, one potential breakpoint was located at parsimonious regions with the
maximization of c 2 , from positions 485 to 615 (c 2 =
122.3, P < 0.0001 of Fisher’s exact test). A similarity plot
(Figure 1A) which was constructed by using all sites,
revealed that the sequence of LZ22 showed greater affinity with one putative parent lineage of GP in the region
from position 1 to 485 than the other putative parent

ZHYMgz01 (100% versus 94%). However, sequence
from positions 486 to 15536, ZHYMgz01 shared greater
similarity with LZ22 than GP (98% versus 95%). P value
(Fisher’s Exact Test) and c 2 value of the breakpoint
were shown on the vertical line in Figure 1. The identical evidence also appeared in BootScanning result (Figure 1B). The region from GP lineage spanned the amino
terminal 1/3 of the N protein approximately.
At last, The phylogenic trees were also constructed
using Mega 4 to determine the recombination events
[16]. From positions 1 to 485, LZ22 and GP were clustered into the same sublineage with 98% bootstrap
value, while ZHYMgz01 was grouped into distinct sublineage (Figure 2A). But, in the other portion, the
arrangement of the phylogenetic tree reflecting the relationship of the three isolates was in contrast with the
previous one (Figure 2B). The topology of the two phylogenetic trees around the breakpoint showed a significant statistic discrepancy when the mosaic was included

Figure 1 (A, B) Results of Similarity and BootScanning analysis of the genome of LZ22_FJ455842. The y-axis in Similarity plot (A) gives
the percentage of sequence identity within a sliding window of 400 bp wide centered on the position plotted, with a step size between plots
of 20 bp, while in BootScanning plot (B) represents the percentage of permuted trees. The c2 of maximization and P value of Fisher’s Exact test
are shown near (or on) the vertical line. GP and ZHYMgz01 are used as two parental lineage sequences and JS_U51116 an outgroup sequence.
The breakpoint is identified and located at position 485, with c2 value maximized. The query sequence LZ22_FJ455842 demonstrates greater
sequence identity and BootScanning support with GP in the beginning region while otherwise with ZHYMgz01_EU326526 in the
complementary regions.

in analyzed data (Shimodaira-Hasegawa test, P < 0.001),
constituting a powerful evidence for recombination.
The minor putative parent of LZ22 was isolated from
Japan, suggesting the existence of a global reservoir of
HPIV with local subreservoirs supporting extensive
levels of virus circulation, which permitted co-infection
and resulted in the recombination event at last. The
potential breakpoint 485 presents in gene N coding
nucleoprotein spanning the region from positions 56 to
1737 of genomic sequence [17]. In the previous study,
viable artificial chimeric HPIV3 recombinants were constructed, which contained the nucleoprotein open reading frame (ORF) from either BPIV3 Kansas or shipping
fever (SF) strain in place of the HPIV3 N ORF. The artificial recombinant (PIV3) in which the nucleocapsid N
protein had been replaced by that of bovine PIV3 was
found to be attenuated in primates [18]. Here, we isolated a HPIV3 with a natural mosaic in NP ORF. Interestingly, before the breakpoint, the similarity of peptide
sequences was up to 98.5% (129/131) although the similarity of gene sequences was only 94% between the two
putative parent lineages. It is unknown whether the
recombination in N gene is also associated with their
adaptation in host cell via a changed virulence.
In addition, since there has been no report to show
homologous recombination can take place between PIVs
before this study; we analyzed 55 isolates (Table 1) from
GenBank in order to determine to what degree genetic
diversity of the virus is affected by the homologous
recombination. Five additional mosaic PIV sequences

were detected through the analysis of sequences from
isolates characterized in previous reports:, HT88
(U01082) [19], HT89a [19] (U01083), HT89c (U01085)
[19], 81-19252_Texas-81 (EU439429) [13,14] and 927783_ISU-92 (EU439428) [13,14] (Table 2). Two HN
gene mosaics, HT88 and HT89a shared the same
recombination event (Table 2), suggesting they descended from the same mosaic ancestor. Please also refer
additional files 1, 2, 3, and 4 for the detail recombination information of each mosaic strain. These results
suggested that homologous recombination did play a
potential role in the evolution of the virus.
Interestingly, two mosaic viruses 81-19252_Texas-81
(U439429) and 92-7783_ISU-92 (EU439428) were
reported to be involved in a cross infection between
swine and bovine [13,14]. Both of the isolates had a
mosaic L gene. The transcription and replication functions of the parainfluenza virus are associated with the
large RNA polymerase protein. Additionally, polyadenylation, and RNA editing activities have to do with L protein [20]. The two putative mosaics were isolated from
pigs in the United States [13,14] while both of their
putative parent lineages (Shipping fever and 910N
lineages) belonged to BPIV3. Viruses are largely speciesspecific with respect to their host and usually do not
cross species boundaries [5]. Recombination processes
will allow some viruses to acquire many of the key
adaptive mutations in a single step, and thus make a
major leap in fitness, which might result in a change of
host tropism [21]. It might be necessary to further study

whether the recombination event is relative to the
BPIV3 cross-species infection.
In conclusion, this study provides the potential evidence that there is mosaic PIV in the field. Our observations show that homologous recombination is a
molecular mechanism of PIV genetic diversity and evolution. Therefore, this study might be important for
knowing the genetic basis resulting in the rapid change
of PIV biologic characteristics.

Material and methods
Virus and sequencing

The virus LZ22 was isolated from lower respiratory tract
of a patient infant with pneumonia in Lanzhou, Gansu
Province of China in 2003. The virus was identified
using previously described protocols [22]. After isolated,
LZ22 was also purified 3 times by the plaque forming
method in Vero cells. Before sequencing, LZ22 was passaged 13 times and amplified in Vero cells for RT-PCR.
Viral RNA was extracted from Vero cell virus cultures
using RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Netherlands) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription
was performed using SuperScriptΠ one-step RT-PCR
platinum Taq HiFi kit (Invitrogen, USA). 3’ and 5’
RACE were performed using 5’-full RACE CORE kit
and 3’-RACE kit (Takala Dalian) to analyze the 3’ and 5’
UTR sequences. The primers of PCR and 3’ and 5’
RACE used in this study were listed in Table 3. The full
genome of LZ22 was amplified and sequenced referring
to previous report [22]. All PCR products were cloned
into pGEM-T-vector (Promega USA) and sequenced by
Takara Biotechnology (Dalian, China).
