Abstract
Background: In recent years real-time PCR has become a leading technique for nucleic acid
detection and quantification. These assays have the potential to greatly enhance efficiency in the
clinical laboratory. Choice of primer and probe sequences is critical for accurate diagnosis in the
clinic, yet current primer/probe signature design strategies are limited, and signature evaluation
methods are lacking.
Methods: We assessed the quality of a signature by predicting the number of true positive, false
positive and false negative hits against all available public sequence data. We found real-time PCR
signatures described in recent literature and used a BLAST search based approach to collect all hits
to the primer-probe combinations that should be amplified by real-time PCR chemistry. We then
compared our hits with the sequences in the NCBI taxonomy tree that the signature was designed
to detect.
Results: We found that many published signatures have high specificity (almost no false positives)
but low sensitivity (high false negative rate). Where high sensitivity is needed, we offer a revised
methodology for signature design which may designate that multiple signatures are required to
detect all sequenced strains. We use this methodology to produce new signatures that are
predicted to have higher sensitivity and specificity.
Conclusion: We show that current methods for real-time PCR assay design have unacceptably
low sensitivities for most clinical applications. Additionally, as new sequence data becomes
available, old assays must be reassessed and redesigned. A standard protocol for both generating
and assessing the quality of these assays is therefore of great value. Real-time PCR has the capacity
to greatly improve clinical diagnostics. The improved assay design and evaluation methods
presented herein will expedite adoption of this technique in the clinical lab.

Background
Real-time PCR assays are gaining popularity as a clinical
tool for detecting and quantifying the presence of both
viral and bacterial pathogens, as reviewed in [1]. Com-

pared to traditional culturing methods used in identification, real-time PCR is fast and cost effective. In addition,
it can be quantitative and sensitive, in some cases greatly
exceeding the sensitivity for conventional testing meth-

ods. Commercially distributed kits are available for PCRbased pathogen diagnostics, and PCR is no longer
thought of merely as confirmatory to culture. However
real-time PCR assays are limited by the quality of the
primers and probes chosen. These primers and probes
must be sensitive enough to match all target organisms yet
specific enough to exclude all others.

ily be copied from an online source were avoided. In total,
112 signatures from 32 papers were analyzed.

A common approach to developing a primer/probe combination is by using commercial software such as
PrimerExpress® (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA). This software asks the user to upload a DNA
sequence file, and then finds possible primer/probe sets
that meet the assay criteria. Generally a researcher will
provide as input a gene region conserved throughout the
taxa that the assay is being designed to detect. The software then provides possible primer/probe sets. The
researcher chooses a representative signature. If there are
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the chosen conserved region, a signature with consensus primers
and probes is often chosen. Next a BLAST [2] search is performed to ensure that the primers are not hitting other targets. Finally the signature is verified in vitro with
laboratory strains.
While this design approach may work acceptably well in
the research laboratory, the clinical laboratory calls for a
more thorough analysis to ensure detection of novel,
diverse, and uncommon strains. These may appear, for
example, as a result of spread by foreign travel or migration. Whole genome based automated signature design
[3] presents a great improvement to the common method.
However, in addition to better design strategies, methods
for automated signature evaluation are needed. As additional sequence data becomes available, it is necessary to
regularly reassess the predicted efficacy of a given signature. This analysis must include the predicted false negative and false positive rates for the developed signatures,
and consider all available public sequence data.
We have analyzed a number of real-time PCR assays
found in the literature based on public sequence data.
Herein we report how well these signatures performed,
offer a revised approach to PCR assay design, and use this
approach to produce new assays predicted to have higher
sensitivity and specificity.

Methods
Literature search
The literature was combed for recently published articles
reporting real-time PCR assays for the clinical detection of
bacterial and viral taxa. The primer and probe sequences
were accumulated, with a preference for TaqMan assays.
However, 3 intercalating dye assays were also selected.
Papers reporting nucleotide sequences that could not eas-

Database construction
Local Oracle databases have been constructed from the
complete genome sequence data available at NCBI Genbank, TIGR, EMBL, IMG (JGI), and Baylor HGSC. We used
our "all_virus" and "all_bacteria" databases to find signature matches and predict false negatives and false positives. These databases were designed to contain only
whole genomes and whole segments from segmented
genomes. However, the heuristics used to separate whole
genomes from partial sequences are not fail-proof due to
inconsistency in sequence annotation within the public
databases. Consequently many sequences in these databases may show up as false negatives when they are actually just a section or segment of a genome that is not
expected to contain the signature, and we manually sorted
these sequences into true or false negatives.
BLAST search
A freely available real time PCR analysis tool called
TaqSim [4] was used to find public sequences that would
match the primer/probe assay in question. TaqSim uses
BLAST searches to find sequences that match both forward
and reverse primers and probe. To be reported as a "hit"
the primers and probe must match in the required orientations relative to one another and the primers must be in
sufficiently close proximity. The forward/reverse primers
may fall on either the plus or minus strand, so long as the
orientation relative to one another is appropriate. There
may not be mismatches at the 3' end of either primer. For
each hit TaqSim calculates the primer and probe melting
temperatures as bound to the candidate hit sequence
(accounting for mismatches) based on reaction conditions (reagent concentrations and hybridization temperature), and returns sequences predicted to be amplified.
Instead of replicating the various exact reaction conditions reported in each paper, very lenient settings were
applied in all cases, essentially removing the screen for
primer/probe vs. candidate hit Tm by setting this threshold to 0°K, and instead checking for specificity by requiring that hits have fewer than 3 mismatches per primer or
probe.
Signature/taxonomy comparison
TaqSim's predicted sequence hits were compared with
sequences listed under a given set of NCBI taxonomy tree
nodes. For instance, if a signature was reported to detect
Hepatitis B, then its set of TaqSim hits would be compared
with the set of sequences under node 10407, corresponding to Hepatitis B virus. Sequences in both sets were considered true positives, sequences in the TaqSim output
that were missing from the chosen taxonomy nodes were
considered false positives, and sequences that were in the

taxonomy tree but missing from the TaqSim output were
considered false negatives. Test statistics such as specificity
and sensitivity (power) were then calculated. In this paper
we define sensitivity and specificity as follows:

that finished sequencing could result in re-classification as
a true positive.

false negatives
Sensitivity = 1 − false negative rate = 1 −
true positives + false negatives

Specificity = 1 − false positive rate = 1 −

false positives
true negatives + false positives

Taxonomy node selection
The primary research articles were read carefully to determine what the authors had designed their primers/probes
to detect. NCBI Taxonomy nodes were chosen to represent
these target organisms. This was not a trivial task, since
many articles lack clarity as to which taxa, specifically,
their assay should detect. For instance, the cytomegalovirus assay did not detect all sequences in the cytomegalovirus genus (taxonomy node 10358), but rather all
sequences in the human herpesvirus 5 species (taxonomy
node 10359). None of the articles specified a taxonomy
node for their signatures.
Hand curating
Perl scripting [5] was used to help compare BLAST hits
and taxonomy node sequences, and count false negative,
false positive and true positive sequence matches. However some sequences required hand sorting due to the
wide array of sequence types and annotations. These often
represented segmented genomes, in which case many of
the would-be false negative sequences simply represent a
different segment than that on which the signature lands,
so we manually tabulated them as true negatives. They
may also represent plasmids. In these situations, a careful
review of the Genbank entry, and sometimes of the primary article cited by Genbank, was necessary to determine
if the sequence of interest was truly a false negative.

Although we attempt to include only complete genomes
in our sequence database, because of inconsistencies in
the annotation of sequence data some partial sequences
nevertheless make it into our databases. Any of these partial CDS's documented as containing the target gene on
which the signature was supposed to land were counted as
false negatives, but those partial CDS's not documented to
contain the target gene were eliminated from the false
negative pool because it is possible the signature could
land on the unsequenced section with the target gene. Our
database also contains "glued fragments", which represent draft genomes "glued" together with hundreds of
"N"s as a simple way to keep the separate contigs associated as part of the same genome. While we report false
negatives from these draft genomes, it is possible that the
signatures could land on gaps between the contigs, and

Results
Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 summarize our analysis of various DNA
signatures. Details of all true positive, false positive and
false negative sequences are available from the authors.
Note that these results are in silico results; no laboratory
testing was performed for verification, so that by stating
that an organism is "detected" we mean that this is our
prediction based on sequence data. A few notes of interest
concerning the data in the tables are described below:
Assorted viral signatures (table 1)
The two human corona virus strains, 229E and OC43 are
a frequent cause of the common cold [6]. A Taqman assay
for 229E was predicted to perform perfectly, while an
assay for OC43 turned up a number of false positives, all
of which were animal corona viruses. A coxsackie B3 virus
assay [7] performed well, but a coxsackie B4 assay [8] hit
many other human coxsackie, echo, and entero viruses.
Four out of 5 false negatives for a Marburg virus assay [9]
were of the Lake Victoria variety. False negatives associated with a yellow fever signature [10] included Trinidad,
French neurotropic, French viscerotropic, and vaccine
strains. The Filoviridae (Ebola/Marburg) assay [10]
detected only Ebola viruses.
Assorted bacterial signatures (table 2)
Staphylococcus aureus [11] and Enterobacteriaceae assays
[12] had low sensitivity. An Escherichia coli assay [12] hit
Shigella and Vibrio sequences.
Measles signature set (table 3)
Many of these signatures [13] had high sensitivity. Combining several of them into a multiplex assay would probably improve sensitivity further.
Hepatitis signature set (table 4)
These signatures were designed using a minimal set clustering approach [14]. While individual signatures have
decent sensitivity, combining several signatures in one
assay, as advocated in the publication greatly improved
sensitivity. The signatures for Hepatitis A are currently
undergoing laboratory screening by the FDA, and are performing well (G. Hartman, personal communication).
Signatures that had no hits (table 5)
Several reported signatures produced no predicted hits.
These include assays for several flaviviruses [10,15,16],
and 16S rRNA assays [12] for several bacteria. Examination of BLAST output showed that in these cases either a
primer or internal oligo (probe) did not have BLAST hits
to target, there were too many mismatches per primer or
probe sequence above the threshold specified in our anal-

yses, or there were mismatches at the 3' end of a primer
relative to target. It is possible that if the sequences of the
samples used in the laboratory differ from available
genomic data, or if the PCR reaction conditions are performed at low stringency (e.g. low annealing temperatures
or high salt concentrations) these assays could in fact
work in the laboratory. However, according to the
genomic data available, a better match of primers and
probes to target is possible and is usually desired for high
sensitivity detection.

In cases where the target strains of a species are too diverse
to be detected by a single signature that hits all target
strains, the MSC software groups the targets into genetic
clusters to enable signature generation per group. If there
are single signatures that are sufficient to detect all targets,
then each of those comprehensive signatures is reported.
We have used this method to design signature sets for
numerous viruses, including Influenza A HA serotypes,
foot-and-mouth-disease virus, Norwalk, Crimean Congo
hemorrhagic fever, Ebola, hepatitis A, and other divergent
viruses. Many of these signatures have been tested by collaborators at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,
US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), USDA, FDA, and
elsewhere.

Improved signatures using minimal set clustering
(additional file)
Targeting a number of the organisms for which currently
published signatures were predicted to perform poorly, as
well as some for which additional signatures may be
desired (even though published signatures may perform
well), we generated new signatures using Minimal Set
Clustering (MSC) according to methods previously
described [14,17]. MSC begins by removing non-unique
regions from consideration as primers or probes from
each of the target sequences relative to a database of nontarget bacterial and viral sequences. The remaining unique
regions of each target sequence are mined for all or many
candidate signatures, without regard for conservation
among other targets, yet satisfying user specifications for
primer and probe length, Tm, GC%, avoidance of long
homopolymer runs, and amplicon length. All candidate
signatures are compared to all targets and clustered by the
subset of targets they are predicted to detect. Signatures
within a given cluster are equivalent, in that they are predicted to detect the same subset of targets, so by clustering
we reduce the redundancy and size of the problem to finding a small set of signatures that detect all targets. Nevertheless, finding the optimal solution of the fewest clusters
to detect all targets is an NP complete problem, so for
large data sets we use a greedy algorithm to find a small
number of clusters that together should pick up all targets.

In the supplementary table, we often provide more than
one alternative signature to detect a given equivalence
group of genomes to serve as a backup should a signature
perform poorly in laboratory testing. Some of the signatures may have mismatches to some of their intended targets, although these mismatches are not predicted to
reduce the Tm of primer/probe hybridizing to target below
typical TaqMan reaction conditions. None of these computationally predicted signatures have been screened in
the laboratory, as this is beyond the scope of this paper.
The supplementary table contains signatures for the following organisms: Viruses: Dengue 1–4, human adenovirus A-F, canine distemper, coxsackie B4, cytomegalovirus,
human herpes 1–4, 6–7, Japanese encephalitis, mumps,

published, or new variation, the result of mutation and
natural selection. In either case, an improved or additional signature should be designed.

Discussion
As expected we found that false negatives were much more
common than false positives. Though signatures are generally based on conserved gene regions, they often fail to
take into account all of the variation within a target set of
organisms. This may be because the signatures were developed using sequence data from a handful of strains, rather
than a thorough study of all strains publicly available.

High false positive or false negative rates do not necessarily indicate a "bad" DNA assay. The quality of an assay
must be considered in light of the milieu in which the testing will take place. In the clinical laboratory, a signature
with high sensitivity but perhaps low specificity may be
preferred over a test with lower sensitivity in cases where
the putative pathogen requires immediate treatment or
may spread quickly. The case of antibiotic resistant bacteria probably falls in this category. On the other hand, the
nation's BASIS and BioWatch programs insists on zero
false positives, so as to avoid public disturbances due to
false alarms, while still aiming for zero false negatives
[18].

These false negatives may also represent sequences that
have become available since the publication of the given
signature. Since new sequence data is made available at an
ever increasing rate, there is great benefit in re-evaluating
clinically used DNA signatures regularly. When new
sequence data leads to false negative predictions for a signature, one of two explanations can be given. The new
sequences either represent recently recognized variation
that has been around since the time the signature was

One must also consider the type of false negative and false
positive results to determine their relevance. For instance,

Too many mismatches in either forward or reverse primer. Several strains have 3 mismatches at 3'
end of forward primer in addition to internal mismatches.
Reverse primer only has a blast hit to one strain (Angola71). Forward primer only has blast hits to
3 strains, and there are many mismatches (e.g. for Angola71, the 11 bases at the 3' end of the
primer do not match).
Too many mismatches in the reverse primer, with 3 mismatches at 3' end as well as at other
locations.
Reverse primer does not have any BLAST hits to target.
Forward primer has 3 or 12 mismatches at 3' end for most strains, the probe has BLAST hits to
only 7 of the 57 genomes available, and reverse primer only has a BLAST hit to 1 genome but there
are 3 mismatches at the 3' end.
Too many mismatches in forward primer and in some cases the probe.
Too many mismatches in forward primer. However, they are at the 5' end, so assay could still
work for some strains with 19 matches at the 3' end of the forward primer.
No blast hits of probe to Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Probe is not between or even in close proximity to the forward and reverse primers
No blast hits of probe to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia
Probe only matches in 17 of 22 bases, which is unlikely to give a strong signal, since probe is
unlikely to bind prior to the primers as desired for real time TaqMan chemistry.

was reported with a number of false positives to animal
corona viruses. However, in the clinical lab in the US,
need the clinician worry about the possibility of a false
positive match to giraffe coronavirus in human sputum?
What about such a match in a clinical lab in Africa? On the
other hand, the echovirus sequences that the coxsackie B4
assay [8] can detect could produce misleading results in
any clinical lab.
The false negative and false positive rates presented in this
study may vary substantially from those seen empirically.
This is because the strains available in a laboratory may
differ significantly from the sequence data available, or
because the empirical protocol is more or less stringent
than the sequence-based requirements we imposed,
which allowed no more than 2 mismatches per primer or
probe for detection.
We believe that as more target sequences become available, our predicted false negative rates will tend to increase
for a given published signature both as a result of better
sampling of diversity and as a result of failure to detect
newly evolved variants. It has been estimated that a minimum of 3–4 genomes are needed in order to computationally design TaqMan PCR signatures likely to detect
most strains, with those isolates chosen for sequencing
that have been selected to span gradients of geographic,
phenotypic, and temporal variation [19]. Even more than
4 genomes are needed for particularly diverse organisms.
Thus, older signatures may not perform as well as newly
developed signatures from the most up-to-date sequence
data. A future study of interest would be a longitudinal
look at how these rates continue to change over time as
additional sequences become available. This study could

be performed retrospectively, since sequence submission
dates are easily obtained from public databases.
We also hypothesized that the wider the intended scope of
a signature, the lower its sensitivity would tend to be. The
point is illustrated loosely in our data tables. Twenty-six of
the 28 signatures with less than 10 publicly available target sequences had sensitivities of 1 (i.e. zero false negatives), while signatures with 10 or more targets had an
average sensitivity of 0.710116. However this approach
only considers scope in the context of sequence data available.
We tried to demonstrate the relationship between specificity and scope at a more fundamental level by grouping
signatures by the taxonomic level of their target as shown
in Figure 1. However the results are misleading. In virology, taxonomic level is not a good indicator of nucleotide
diversity. For instance, there is more diversity in the influenza A species then there is in the entire Filoviridae family,
which consists of only two known genera: Ebola-like
viruses and Marburg viruses. A better approach might be
to calculate nucleotide diversity as a function of phylogenetic branch length or shared k-mer clusters within a target taxonomy node.
Finally, we averaged the sensitivities of microbes by
genome type as shown in Table 6. Note that the ssRNA-RT
category includes only HIV-1. This chart demonstrates
that creating signatures with high sensitivity becomes
more difficult for target organisms with high mutation
rates.

Top and bottom of each box indicates 75th and 25th percentiles, and grey lines at whisker ends denote min and max values. The wide ranging sensitivities demonstrate both
inconsistency in genetic diversity at a given taxonomy level,
and inconsistency in signature design approaches.

Conclusion
Current real-time PCR assay design approaches produce
signatures with sensitivities generally too low for clinical
use. We suggest that a rigorous approach involving false
positive and false negative analysis should be the standard
by which an initial assessment of signature quality is
made. Signatures must also regularly be reassessed as
sequence data becomes available. For targets with wide
nucleotide diversity, it becomes necessary to develop a set
of signatures, for which we suggest a minimal set clustering approach that may also include signatures with degenerate/inosine bases.
