Abstract
Background: High-throughput SNP genotyping has become an essential requirement for molecular breeding and
population genomics studies in plant species. Large scale SNP developments have been reported for several
mainstream crops. A growing interest now exists to expand the speed and resolution of genetic analysis to
outbred species with highly heterozygous genomes. When nucleotide diversity is high, a refined diagnosis of the
target SNP sequence context is needed to convert queried SNPs into high-quality genotypes using the Golden
Gate Genotyping Technology (GGGT). This issue becomes exacerbated when attempting to transfer SNPs across
species, a scarcely explored topic in plants, and likely to become significant for population genomics and inter
specific breeding applications in less domesticated and less funded plant genera.
Results: We have successfully developed the first set of 768 SNPs assayed by the GGGT for the highly
heterozygous genome of Eucalyptus from a mixed Sanger/454 database with 1,164,695 ESTs and the preliminary
4.5X draft genome sequence for E. grandis. A systematic assessment of in silico SNP filtering requirements showed
that stringent constraints on the SNP surrounding sequences have a significant impact on SNP genotyping
performance and polymorphism. SNP assay success was high for the 288 SNPs selected with more rigorous in silico
constraints; 93% of them provided high quality genotype calls and 71% of them were polymorphic in a diverse
panel of 96 individuals of five different species.
SNP reliability was high across nine Eucalyptus species belonging to three sections within subgenus Symphomyrtus
and still satisfactory across species of two additional subgenera, although polymorphism declined as phylogenetic
distance increased.
Conclusions: This study indicates that the GGGT performs well both within and across species of Eucalyptus
notwithstanding its nucleotide diversity ≥2%. The development of a much larger array of informative SNPs across
multiple Eucalyptus species is feasible, although strongly dependent on having a representative and sufficiently
deep collection of sequences from many individuals of each target species. A higher density SNP platform will be
instrumental to undertake genome-wide phylogenetic and population genomics studies and to implement
molecular breeding by Genomic Selection in Eucalyptus.

Background
High-throughput, high density SNP genotyping has
become an essential tool for QTL mapping, association
genetics, gene discovery, germplasm characterization,
molecular breeding and population genomics studies in
several crops and model plants [1-7]. The abundance of
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in plant genomes together with the rapidly falling costs and
increased accessibility of genotyping technologies, have
prompted an increasing interest to develop panels of
SNP markers to expand resolution and throughput of
genetic analysis in less-domesticated plant species with
uncharacterized genomes such as those of orphan crops
[8], forest [9-12] and fruit trees [13-15].
Two main strategies have been employed to identify
SNPs in plants: utilization of EST sequence information
to direct targeted amplicon resequencing and, more
recently, next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies
coupled or not to genome complexity reduction methods [16]. Amplicon resequencing of stretches of target
genes is carried out in a germplasm panel that is relevant to the downstream applications and sufficiently
large to avoid ascertainment bias. SNPs are mined in
the resulting sequences and then assays are designed
focusing on those particular SNPs. This strategy,
although labor intensive, has been successful when the
goal is to develop a moderate number of assayable SNPs
[16]. High throughput NGS and direct in silico SNP
identification now provide a very effective alternative to
amplicon resequencing for SNP development in plants
[17]. Thousands of SNPs can be readily identified given
that sequences are obtained from an adequately large
representation of individuals with sufficiently redundant
genome coverage. Complexity reduction strategies such
as using cDNA libraries [18,19], AFLP derived representations [20], reduced representation libraries generated
by restriction enzyme digestion and fragment selection
[2,21], microarray-based [22] or in-solution [23]
sequence capture, and additional target enrichment strategies [24] can be used to obtain the necessary sequence
depth when the objective is to develop SNP based markers in specific genes or regions of the genome. Multiplexed bar-coded sequencing of such reduced genomic
representations optimizes costs of SNP identification by
increasing coverage and genotypic representation in the
target regions [24-26]. Clearly the prospects are that
sequence abundance and quality for SNP identification
will no longer be a limiting factor for any plant genome.
A number of SNP genotyping technologies were
developed in recent years mostly geared toward assaying
human SNP variation. Among those that have been
used in plant genetics, the Golden Gate Genotyping
Technology (GGGT) developed by Illumina has consistently been reported as a reliable technology, displaying

high levels of SNP conversion rate and reproducibility
[16]. This assessment, initially reported for large scale
human genotyping, has been corroborated in plant species including autogamous crops with low nucleotide
diversity (0.2% to 0.5%) [3,27-29] and outbred species
with much higher sequence diversity typically ≥2%
[9-13]. In highly heterozygous genomes, the development of GGGT SNP assays has been carried out mainly
by amplicon resequencing targeting specific genes. This
approach has been practical in conifers using haploid
megagametophyte tissue [30,31] and poplar for which a
reference genome is available [12]. If attempted for large
scale SNP development, however, this approach would
be technically challenging for most outbred plant genomes due to the high levels of nucleotide diversity and
additional indel variation as shown in earlier attempt for
grape [32]. Direct SNP development from large in silico
sequence resources will likely be the best approach for
the highly heterozygous genomes of the majority of
undomesticated plant species.
Irrespective of the method used to develop SNP markers in heterozygous genomes - direct in silico or targeted amplicon re-sequencing - challenges are faced in
later steps when attempting to convert queried SNPs
into high-quality genotypes. Particularly for the development of GGGT assays based on hybridization of allele
and locus specific oligonucleotides, constraints have to
be placed on the sequences flanking the target SNP
[33]. A robust diagnosis of sequence variation in the
vicinity of the target SNPs will depend largely on
sequence coverage, sequence quality [34] and origin of
sequences as far as the number and relatedness of individuals surveyed for SNP discovery. These issues will
become increasingly exacerbated when attempting to
transfer SNP assays across species within the same
genus. Still a rarely explored topic in plants [13,30,35],
the assessment of inter-specific transferability of SNPs
will likely be an important subject for population genomics and inter specific breeding applications in less
domesticated and less funded plant genera.
Species of Eucalyptus are currently planted in more
than 90 countries and are well known for their fast
growth, straight form, valuable wood properties and
wide adaptability [36]. Eucalyptus subgenus Symphyomyrtus, includes the majority of the twenty or so commercially planted species. E. globulus has been the top
choice for plantations in temperate regions. Tropical
Eucalyptus forestry, on the other hand, is based on
interspecific hybrid breeding and clonal propagation
with E. grandis as the pivotal species [36]. Molecular
marker technologies have allowed a significant progress
in the genetics and breeding of this vast genus that
includes over 700 species [36]. Genetic analyses with
molecular markers were key to settle phylogenetic issues

[37], manage breeding populations [38] build linkage
maps [39-41] and identify QTLs for important traits
[42-45]. Nonetheless, more extensive genome coverage,
higher throughput and improved inter specific transferability of current genotyping methods are necessary to
increase resolution and speed for a variety of applications. A DArT array delivering around 3,000 to 5,000
dominant markers for mapping and population analyses
was recently reported [46]. SNP developments in species
of the genus have targeted specific candidate genes generating a few tens SNPs for specific association genetics
studies [47,48]. However, large scale SNP arrays developments for Eucalyptus are yet to come. Due to their
recent domestication, large population sizes and outbred
mating system, species of Eucalyptus are among the
ones with the highest frequency of SNPs reported in
woody plant species and possibly in plants in general,
with up to 1 SNP every 16 bp [49]. While a bonus for
overall SNPs identification, such high nucleotide diversity, both within and among species, could represent an
obstacle for the development of large sets of robust and
polymorphic sets of Golden Gate assayable SNPs across
species.
We are interested in developing genome-wide parallelized genotyping methods to be used for the operational
implementation of Genomic Selection in Eucalyptus
hybrid breeding, population genomics and phylogenetic
studies in natural populations of the genus. The upcoming availability of a reference genome for Eucalyptus
grandis and the rapid evolution of high throughput
sequencing technologies will foster the buildup of large
sequence dataset from many individuals, a valuable
resource for the development of large collections of
SNPs for the genus. In anticipation to this time, we
used a 1.2 million mixed EST dataset including Sanger
and 454 sequences from multiple Eucalyptus species
and individuals to: (1) develop and validate an initial
collection of genome-wide SNPs for Eucalyptus derived
exclusively from in silico EST sequence data from unrelated individuals of different species; (2) assess the effect
of increasingly stringent in silico SNP identification and
design parameters on the reliability and polymorphism
of SNP genotyping in species of Eucalyptus using the
Golden Gate Genotyping Technology (GGGT); (3) evaluate SNPs transferability across eleven species of Eucalyptus and polymorphism in the five main planted
species worldwide. Information on all SNPs discovered
and validated in the present study is provided.

variation across species, although only a portion was
retained for assembly after applying several quality filters. From a total of 136,041 Sanger-derived ESTs,
78,087 of them (57.4%) were further processed. Similar
percentage was retained out of the 1,028,654 454derived ESTs (60.7%) (Table 1). The majority of the
Sanger reads and all 454 reads were obtained from
E. grandis, the pivotal species in most tropical breeding
programs, totaling 94% of the available ESTs before
assembly and 96% after assembly, i.e. effectively used for
SNP discovery. A two-step EST-assembly strategy was
used: clustering performed at the species and sequencing technology levels followed by using the MIRA 2
assembler (Whole Genome Shotgun and EST Sequence
Assembler) to consolidate the contigs and singletons
from the previous step into a final EST assembly. After
the MIRA assembly 48,973 contigs were obtained. Only
those contigs formed by five or more ESTs were considered in this analysis to mitigate the limitations of alignment depth in SNP detection, thus resulting in 17,703
usable contigs (36.15% of the total). From this contig
set, SNPs were predicted using the program PolyBayes.
Only SNPs with high probability (P SNP ≥0.99) were
selected, totaling 162,141 potentially polymorphic sites
(Figure 1).
In silico selection of genome-wide SNP

Five sequential filters were applied to the 162,141 candidate genome-wide SNPs for GGGT assay design from
F0 (less stringent) to F4 (most stringent) (see Methods).
When the filtering stringency increased from F0 to F4,
the number of SNPs surviving selection in silico
decreased abruptly. A total of 66,254 SNPs (40.6%) were
selected that had ≥ 5 reads on the SNP position and a
minimum of one read with the alternative base. This
number dropped to 21,944 (13.5%) when an in silico
MAF ≥ 0.2 constraint was applied and to 10,032 (6.2%)
when at least one EST from the more distant species E.
globulus or E. gunnii was required in the contig. When
the filter requiring flanking sequence conservation was
applied, the number of SNPs selected dropped even

further to a final number of only 1,329 when a cutoff of
60 bases with no additional SNP on each side of the target SNP was stipulated. The number of unigene contigs
retained along the filters also dropped significantly from
an initial number of 17,703 to a mere 998 when all filtering constraints were applied (Table 2). Overall the
proportion of SNPs with ADT (Assay design Tool)
score greater than 0.6, i.e. SNPs with a high likelihood
to be converted into a successful genotyping assay, was
around 95%, irrespective of the filtering treatments. For
example, by applying only filter F0, 598 SNPs out of 621
had ADT score ≥ 0.6; similarly, with filter F4, 525 out of
547 SNPs had ADT score ≥ 0.6. The proportion of SNPs
with ADT score ≥ 0.9 was between 50 and 53% again
showing no impact of the filtering treatments (Table 2).
For bench validation only SNPs with ADT score ≥ 0.8

SNP discovery in pre-determined candidate genes

From a list of 42 candidate genes selected from the literature as being putatively associated with relevant
wood phenotypes in Eucalyptus (see Material and Methods), only in 20 of them SNPs were found that matched
the minimum requirements of having ≥ 2 reads with
alternative bases at the SNP position and at least 60
bases of flanking sequence on each SNP side. For these
20 genes, a total of 175 SNPs were discovered and 72
were included in the bead array for downstream validation. These 72 SNPs were selected to assay at least one
SNP in each one of the 20 genes and in those genes
where several SNPs were available, SNPs that were
derived from a contig with at least one read coming
from E. globulus or E. gunnii and distantly positioned
along the contig were selected. These 72 SNPs assayed
in candidate genes are available as a separate spreadsheet in Additional file 1.
SNP genotyping reliability

The distributions of the proportions of SNPs in increasingly more reliable classes as measured by the GeneCall50 and GeneTrain scores for each in silico filter
level were plotted (Figure 2). The relative distribution of
the broken bars histograms corresponding to increasing
levels of reliability suggests that when progressively
more stringent in silico SNP selection requirements are
applied from F0 to F4, larger proportions of SNPs with
higher GeneTrain and GC50 scores were obtained. For
SNPs in pre-determined candidate genes (CG) the proportions of SNPs at the lower ends of the distribution
of GC50 and GeneTrain scores were larger reflecting
the less stringent in silico selection applied in these
cases (Figure 2). SNPs developed in specific candidate
genes for which limitations existed regarding the number of available EST reads, generally showed a slightly
lower performance in all measured parameters of reliability even when compared to SNPs developed only
applying filter F0. The proportion of SNPs with call rate
rate ≥ 95% was only 80.6%, the average GeneTrain
score was the lowest at 0.61, and the proportion of
SNPs with GeneTrain and GC50 scores ≥ 0.40 was less
than 90%. However no difference was seen in the proportion of polymorphic SNPs in relation to the more
stringent in silico filtering levels. Because SNPs in candidate genes were mined without observance of any
specific in silico filtering level besides the most fundamental one (see methods), they were not included in
the subsequent comparative analyses of the in silico filtering parameters.

Averages and SNP counts above specific thresholds of SNP reliability parameters (Call Rate, GeneCall50, GeneTrain scores) and polymorphism (MAF) for SNPs in
pre-selected candidate genes and for genome-wide SNPs selected with increasingly stringent in silico SNP selection and design requirements (F0 through F4 see methods for details).

The overall genotyping reliability for the 768 SNPs
was assessed by estimating SNP counts above conventionally used threshold and average values for Call Rate,
GeneCall and GeneTrain scores (Table 3). Goodness-offit for normality tests showed that all these three variables were not normally distributed (p < 0.0001). The
average call rates for all SNPs, irrespective of in silico
filter levels were above 90%; 87% of all 768 SNPs had
call rates ≥ 95%. Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests
showed no significant difference in average call rate and
GeneTrain score between filtering levels tested individually or combined based on requirements of conservation
of flanking sequences (F0+F1+F2 against F3+F4). The
proportion of SNPs with call rates ≥ 95% varied, with an
increasing trend when going toward a more stringent
SNP filtering selection and reaching 93.1% with filter F4.
When tested pair-wise and sequentially, i.e. F0 against
F1, F1 against F2 and so on, no significant differences in
the proportion of SNPs with call rates ≥ 95% or GeneTrain ≥ 0.4 were found using a Chi-square Pearson test.
However when the pooled count of all SNPs selected
with no requirements of conservation of flanking
sequences (filters F0+F1+F2; 245 in 300) was compared
to the count of SNPs selected with such requirements (i.
e. no additional SNPs either in 20 or 60 bases on each
SNP side, i.e. filters F3+F4; 365 SNPs in 396) (Table 3),
a highly significant difference was found in the final
number of SNPs recovered with call rates ≥ 95%, (Chisquare Pearson = 17.40; p = 0.00003). SNP reliability
based on the GeneCall50 score followed a similar trend
observed with the Call Rate and GeneTrain with an
increase from 0.59 for F0 to 0.67 for F4. However a significant difference in the average GC50 score was found
when the comparison was between the pooled SNPs

from filters F0+F1+F2 (GC50 = 0.61) and those derived
from filters F3+F4 (GC50 = 0.66) (Mann-Whitney nonparametric test p = 0.000041). These results indicate
that although the vast majority of SNPs could be
robustly scored with high call rate, a more stringent in
silico selection on the flanking sequences yields more
SNPs with higher call rates and GeneTrain scores as
well as SNPs with average higher GeneCall50 scores.
We used a relatively stringent GeneCall50 cutoff of 0.4
when compared to other SNP development studies as
we observed that at lower thresholds, the genotype cluster separation consistently showed undesirable shifts.
SNP polymorphism

The proportion of polymorphic SNPs overall the five
main Eucalyptus species (N = 96 individuals) for all 768
SNPs was estimated at 66.1%, which corresponds to the
conversion rate. When only the 711 SNPs that simultaneously met the adhoc thresholds of reliability (GC50 ≥
0.4 and Call Rate ≥ 95%) are considered, a higher proportion of them are polymorphic with MAF ≥0.05 (505
in 711) i.e. a conversion rate of 71%. The average MAF
of polymorphic SNPs was consistently around 0.25 for
all filtering levels and for the candidate gene SNPs as
well (Table 3). The proportion of SNPs with higher
polymorphism level, measured by MAF, increased as
progressively more stringent selection was applied in
silico as depicted in the broken bars histogram. However
only with the more rigorous F4 selection on the SNP
flanking sequence a larger proportion of polymorphic
SNPs was effectively recovered (Figure 2). No increase
was seen in the proportion of polymorphic SNPs when
going from filter F1 (69.4%) to F2 (68.5%), i.e. by including the requirement of ESTs reads from section

Maidenaria in the contig (Table 3). However the proportion of polymorphic SNPs significantly increased from
selection with filters F0+F1+F2 (175 in 300) to selection
with filters F3+F4 (279 in 396) (Chi-square Pearson =
9.36; p = 0.00221), suggesting that the inclusion of a filtering requirement on the SNP flanking sequences not
only results in more reliably assayable SNPs but also
increases the proportion of polymorphic SNPs.
The proportions of polymorphic SNPs were also estimated for each main species separately, and for all possible combinations of species, i.e. the number of SNPs
that were polymorphic for the species simultaneously
(Table 4 and Additional file 2). In this analysis only the
711 SNPs that simultaneously met the adhoc thresholds
of reliability were considered. The highest proportions
of polymorphic SNPs were observed for E. grandis, E.
urophylla and E. camaldulensis, between 40.9% and
49.4%, while in the two species of the more distant section Maidenaria, the proportion of polymorphic SNPs
was around 22 to 25%. The average number of polymorphic SNPs in all three-way species combinations
varied from a maximum of 144 (20%) for the E. grandis,
E. urophylla and E. camaldulensis set to a minimum of
77 (11%) for the E. urophylla, E. globulus and E. camaldulensis set. Only between 64 and 78 SNPs were polymorphic when any four species combinations were
considered and only 55 (7.7%) when all five were taken
into account (Additional file 2). Given the relatively limited sample size, when a less conservative estimate of
polymorphism within species was used (MAF ≥ 0.01)
the proportions of polymorphic SNPs increased considerably in all species and combinations. For example in
E. grandis the proportion went from 49.4% to 62%, in E.
camaldulensis from 41.2% to 58.5% and in E. globulus
from 22.2% to 33.6%. Likewise SNPs that were polymorphic in two or more species concurrently also
increased.
SNP reliability across subgenera

Based on the results showing a significant increase in
SNP genotyping reliability when introducing in silico
constraints on SNP flanking sequences, SNP reliability
across a larger set of species and subgenera was evaluated by considering only two overall SNP selection

levels: (1) SNPs selected with no requirement of conservation of flanking sequences (this group includes candidate genes SNPs plus genome-wide SNPs from filters F0
+F1+F2, totaling 372 SNPs) and (2) SNPs selected
requiring conservation in flanking sequences of either
20 or 60 bases (this group includes genome-wide SNPs
from filters F3+F4 with a total of 396 SNPs). Reliability
was assessed by the counts and proportion of SNPs that
displayed a Call rate ≥ 0.95 and a GC50 score ≥ 0.40
(Table 5). A comparison of the GeneTrain score across
species does not apply in this case, as it is a SNP specific statistics appraising the quality of the genotype clusters and remains unchanged for all samples used to
generate the clusters. The relative proportions of reliable
SNPs across all nine species of subgenus Symphyomyrtus did not vary much within each SNP selection level.
With no flanking sequence constraints on average 81%
of the SNPs had call rate ≥ 0.95 and 88% a GC50 score
≥ 0.40. With flanking sequence constraints the proportions were higher, 90% of the SNPs had call rate ≥ 0.95
and 94% a GC50 score ≥ 0.40. However, a lower genotyping reliability was observed for the two species outside subgenus Symphyomyrtus, with only around 50% of
the SNPs having satisfactory call rate and GC50 scores
even for SNPs selected with flanking sequence constraints. In all eleven species but E. cloeziana, a significant increase was found (Pearson chi square test p
<0.01) in the number of SNPs that met or exceeded the
call rate and GC50 thresholds when flanking sequence
constraints were applied in silico (Table 5). This result
confirms the impact of flanking sequence constraints on
the reliability of SNPs in all tested species, irrespective
of the presence of ESTs from the particular species in
the database used for SNP discovery.
Heritability-based SNP validation

SNP assay quality was further assessed by estimating
heritability of allelic transmission in parent-parent-offspring trios involving different Eucalyptus species as
parents. Heritability is defined as the number of offspring genotypes that agree with the expected inheritance over the total number of genotype calls possible.
In family E. grandis × E. urophylla (G × U) there were
457 Mendelian transmission inconsistencies out of the

36,864 allelic transmissions assayed, i.e. a genotyping
miscall rate of 1.2%. In total 719 SNPs out of the 768
tested (93.6%) had 100% heritability and 80% of the
inheritance miscalls were concentrated in 24 SNPs. In
the four species family ([E. dunni × E. grandis] × [E.
urophylla × E. globulus]) (DG × UGL) 1,596 transmission inconsistencies were seen, i.e. a genotyping miscall
rate of 4.3%, only 678 SNPs (88.3%) had 100% heritability and 80% of the inheritance miscalls were concentrated in 71 SNPs. Only 17 SNPs displayed miscalls in
both families concurrently, revealing potentially more
problematic SNPs. Upon inspection of the SNPs clustering graphs most inheritance miscalls in both families
were due to the two parents being homozygous AA and
BB and offspring not having the expected genotype AB
but rather one of the two homozygous ones.
Sequence-based validation of SNP genotypes

SNP validation was possible for 50 SNPs for which five
or more genomic reads overlapping at the SNP position
with sequence quality Q ≥ 20 were obtained. Given the
limited sample size available (number of observed reads
at the SNP site) a less conservative alpha level a = 0.1
was used to increase the power of the binomial test
used to declare sequence-based genotypes. In other
words, by increasing the chance of obtaining a statistically significant result, the probability of correctly
declaring a sequence-based homozygous genotype in
spite of the small number of observed reads was
increased although at the expense of an increase in
Type I error, i.e. erroneously declaring the genotype as
homozygous when in fact it is heterozygous. Sequencebased genotypes at 43 of the 50 SNPs (86%) matched

the Golden Gate assay called genotypes (Additional file
3).

Discussion
We have successfully developed the first set of 768 SNPs
assayed by the Golden Gate genotyping technology for
the highly heterozygous genome of Eucalyptus. The
overall SNP success rate was high, with 87% of all SNPs
showing call rates ≥ 95%, 94.1% of them having a GeneTrain score ≥ 0.40 and 93.6% a GeneCall50 score ≥
0.40. The conversion rate, which is the proportion of
polymorphic SNPs divided by the total number of SNPs
was 66.1% estimated in a diverse panel of 96 individuals
of five different species (Table 3). These are the first
results of a larger scale SNP development effort for
Eucalyptus suggesting that the Golden Gate assay performs well both within and across species notwithstanding the high nucleotide diversity of the complex
Eucalyptus genome and the wide range of species for
which SNP genotyping is pursued.
SNP discovery and selection from Eucalyptus ESTs

SNP discovery and assay development was carried out
based on all available 1,164,695 ESTs in public and our
own databases as of May 2009 (Table 1). Although this
was considered a large EST set by pre-next-generation
sequencing standards, it constitutes a relatively small
collection given today’s sequencing technologies. A large
number (162,141) of potentially polymorphic sites was
found after EST clustering and assembly in agreement
with the previous abundance of SNPs reported for species of Eucalyptus from in silico surveys [18,49]. However only 36% of the assembled contigs met the depth

Grattapaglia et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:65
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/65

requirement of five reads overlapping the SNP position
with 60 bases of available sequence on each side recommended for Golden Gate genotyping (Figure 1). In fact
when SNPs were searched in 42 pre-determined candidate genes of interest, only 20 of them were available
for SNP assay design. This result suggests that if SNPs
are to be developed for specific genes from direct in
silico sequence resources, a much higher sequence coverage than the one used in this work is necessary.
Recently, such an approach proved successful by massive sequencing of reduced representation libraries of
multiple grape varieties to develop a ~9,000 selected
SNP array from over 470,000 in silico detected SNPs
[13]. Several genetically heterogeneous plant genomes
should be amenable to this same SNP development
approach opening concrete perspectives for high
throughput genotyping in a large number of less characterized, largely undomesticated species.
SNP reliability is enhanced by stringent in silico
constraints

Knowledge of the SNP flanking sequences is an important aspect of the success of the Golden Gate assay. The
assay design tool provided by Illumina checks for the
presence of repetitive or palindromic sequences, GC
content and neighboring polymorphisms to provide a
functionality score for each candidate SNP [33]. However no systematic assessment of the impact of additional polymorphisms in the flanking sequence of the
target SNP on its genotyping reliability has been
reported. While this represents a minor concern for species of low nucleotide diversity such as humans, crop
plants and domestic animals, it is a key issue for highly
heterozygous genomes with nucleotide diversity in
excess of 1%. In the heterogeneous genome of loblolly
pine, for example, Eckert et al. [9] suggested that the
SNP success rate observed (67%), lower than the typical
≥ 90% rate obtained in crop plants and humans, could
be attributed to the presence of undetected SNPs in the
flanking sequences, but no detailed assessment of this
issue was carried out. In spruce, no specific selection for
conserved flanking sequences was carried out during
SNP development; SNP success rates were around 69 to
77% [11]. In Pinus pinaster, the proportion of successful
SNPs (GeneTrain > 0.25) developed from in silico was
estimated at 61.5% while for SNPs developed by targeted
amplicon resequencing it was slightly higher, at 73% but
also no specific selection for more conserved SNP flanking sequences was carried out [10].
In our study we used five sequential in silico filters on
the initial set of 162,141 candidate genome-wide SNPs
discovered in 17,703 EST contigs that had ≥ 5 reads.
While filter F0 was a commonly used criterion for SNP
discovery in silico, F1 added a requirement for a

Page 9 of 18

minimum in silico estimated MAF ≥ 0.2. This single
additional requirement, however, reduced to less than 1/
3 the number of available SNPs for assay design (Table
2). Filter F2 introduced a requirement of inter-specific
sequence representation in the contig to increase
sequence sampling both at the SNP position as well as
for flanking sequences, in an attempt to increase SNP
transferability across more distant species. This further
filter caused a reduction of 50% in the number of available SNPs. When filters F3 and F4 added a progressively
more rigorous requirement on the SNP flanking
sequences, the number of surviving SNPs decreased
rapidly to a point that only 3,187 SNPs in 1,651 genes
remained for SNP assay design after filter F3 or 1,329
SNPs in 998 genes after F4 (Table 2). The application of
similarly stringent in silico quality filters to the initial
SNP source also caused a 10-fold reduction in the available putative SNP when developing a 54,000 SNP array
for bovine, but resulted in an increase from 50% to >85%
in the conversion rate [50]. In our study, however, it is
important to note that the observed reduction in the
number of available SNPs was largely a result of the relatively limited number of ESTs available at the beginning
of the pipeline (702,009), many derived from short 454
reads, so that the minimum in silico MAF ≥ 0.2 and sufficient flanking sequences could not be achieved in most
contigs. Additionally only ~17,000 ESTs from section
Maidenaria (E. globulus plus E. gunnii) were available
among the 702,009 used (only 2.4%), strongly limiting
the ability to fulfill the requirement of filter F2. This
highly unbalanced sequence representation most likely
was responsible for this sharp decrease in sequences used
for SNP assay design. Had we had access to a more
balanced EST representation across species, a much larger number of SNPs would probably have survived all
sequential filters and be amenable to assay design.
Our results show that the increasingly more stringent
requirements on the SNP surrounding sequences are
highly effective and have a statistically significant impact
not only on SNP reliability but also on the proportion
of polymorphic SNPs. Significantly more SNPs with
higher call rates and GenCall50 scores were observed (p
< 0.001) when filters F3 and F4 on flanking sequences
were applied (Table 3). Furthermore, although comparison of SNP success rates across studies is not clear-cut
due to the peculiarities of SNPs discovery and SNP
reliability thresholds used, our overall SNP success rate
averaged 87% if measured by the percentage of SNP
with call rate ≥ 95%, or 94% if measured by the proportion of SNPs with GeneTrain and GeneCall50 ≥ 0.4
(Table 3). For the 288 SNPs selected with the most
stringent filtering level F4, over 96% of them had GeneTrain and GeneCall50 ≥ 0.4. These assay success rates
are comparable to those obtained for the human [33]

Grattapaglia et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:65
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/65

and barley [3] genomes. It is worth mentioning, however, that our considerably higher success rates when
compared to other studies with highly heterozygous tree
genomes, likely derives from the fact that the vast
majority of the ESTs used were obtained from a relatively large sample with more than 21 unrelated diploid
individuals (i.e. more than 42 sampled chromosomes) of
E. grandis. More importantly, the pipeline filtered out
SNPs that did not belong to the same exon by using the
draft genome sequence for E. grandis, therefore avoiding
failures due to SNP located in intron/exon junctions, a
considerable drawback when developing SNPs from
ESTs [51]. The impact of using a reference genome was
likely responsible for the comparably high success rate ≥
87% for the candidate genes SNPs for which no flanking
sequence requirements could be applied. In summary,
although we did not compare the reliability of SNPs
designed without using a final selection step based on
the reference genome, the simple comparison of our
success rates with those obtained for comparably heterozygous tree species supports the value of having
access to a reference genome sequence for successful
large scale SNP development.
SNP conversion rate was increased by selecting for
conserved SNP flanking sequences

An overall conversion rate of 66.1% was observed when
genotype data for all 768 SNPs in a panel of 96 individuals of five species was considered. If only the 711 reliable SNPs are considered, the conversion rate increases
to 71% which corresponds to the conversion rate of the
top 288 SNPs developed after applying filter F4 on the
SNP flanking sequences (Table 3). This conversion rate
is equivalent to the one obtained for catfish SNPs developed from in silico ESTs after applying constraints on
the number of ESTs and on the presence of minor allele
sequences in the contig [51], and slightly higher than
the conversion rates obtained for SNPs developed from
in silico resources with no stringent filtering and assayed
in analogous population samples of Pinus pinaster [10].
Interestingly, the proportion of polymorphic SNPs significantly increased (p = 0.00221) when flanking
sequence conservation of 60 bases was required. We
hypothesize that the effect of flanking sequence conservation on polymorphism is not a direct one. It is partly
a result of the higher SNP reliability but probably also
due to an indirect effect of assaying a SNP surrounded
by higher quality flanking sequences likely devoid of
sequencing errors, and thus selected as more conserved.
Such a SNP is therefore less likely to be a false SNP due
to sequencing errors in one or more of the reads in the
contig resulting in a better in silico assessment of polymorphism and consequently a more polymorphic one
when assayed at the population level.

Estimates of polymorphic SNPs within Eucalyptus species
are conservative

SNP polymorphism levels were also estimated for five
species independently for which samples between 16
and 24 individuals (32 or 48 alleles) were genotyped
(Table 4). The highest estimate was obtained for E.
grandis (49.4%) followed by E. camaldulensis (41.2%)
and E. urophylla (40.9%). These estimates are relatively
low when compared to other SNP development studies
in forest trees especially bearing in mind the high
nucleotide diversity in Eucalyptus. Estimates of MAF in
SNP development studies are, however, strongly influenced by the sample size and by the genetic origin of
the population [10]. For example, a sample size of 146
individuals (292 alleles) would be necessary to estimate
an allele with frequency 0.05 ± 0.025 with 95% probability. The samples sizes used in our study were therefore
not optimal to detect low frequency alleles at several
SNPs that would otherwise be deemed polymorphic had
we used a larger sample size. Furthermore, none of the
individuals used to generate the ESTs were present in
the genotyped panel. In fact several species were not
even represented in the EST databases such as E. nitens
and E. camaldulensis and even for E. globulus and E.
urophylla the proportion of sequences used was very
limited, less than 2% and 1% respectively. Therefore the
estimates of the proportion of polymorphic SNPs in
each species individually are conservative and should be
taken as a lower bound estimate. Conversion rates will
likely improve considerably by selecting SNPs from a
sequence database built from a much wider representation of the diversity of each target species and validating
in a larger panel of individuals.
As expected, the highest rate of polymorphic SNPs
was observed for E. grandis, the predominant species in
the EST database with over 96% of the sequences used
for SNP discovery. Interestingly, however, E. camaldulensis showed the second highest conversion rate
(41.2%) despite the fact that not a single sequence was
used for SNP discovery and that only 16 individuals, as
compared to 24 in E. grandis, were genotyped. This
result could be explained by a recent study that found
E. camaldulensis with the highest nucleotide diversity
among four Eucalyptus species, estimated at 1 SNP
every 16 bp when amplicons in 23 genes were resequenced in 456 individuals from 93 populations [49]. In
that same study several hundred individuals of E. globulus and E. nitens were also surveyed showing much
lower nucleotide diversity, 31 and 33% respectively, in
an equivalently wide sample of individuals and populations. In our study these two species displayed the lowest proportion of polymorphic SNPs (22.2 and 25.5%)
(Table 4) and no statistically significant effect on the
recovery of polymorphic SNPs was obtained by

Grattapaglia et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:65
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/65

including at least one read from Maidenaria species (E.
globulus or E. gunnii) in the contig, i.e. going from filter
F1 to F2. Besides the ascertainment bias due to the very
limited or nil representation of sequences in the EST
databases, the lower proportion of polymorphic SNPs
observed in these two species could be explained not
only by their greater phylogenetic distance from E.
grandis as compared to E. urophylla and E. camaldulensis but also by their intrinsically lower nucleotide
diversity.
A substantial reduction in the proportion of simultaneously polymorphic SNP in two or more species was
observed. The highest proportion of shared polymorphic
SNPs was seen for the two and three-way combinations
of E. grandis, E. urophylla and E. camaldulensis which
agrees with their closest phylogenetic relationship.
When Maidenaria species were included, however, the
proportion of shared polymorphic SNPs dropped considerably to 14 to 18% and to 7.7% when all five species
were contemplated together (Table 4 and Additional file
2). These results are consistent with in silico SNP sharing rates among four Eucalyptus species, estimated
between 20 and 43% for 23 resequenced genes in much
larger sample sizes [49]. In spite of the ascertainment
bias that both in silico and assay-based estimates of
shared polymorphic SNP suffer, these proportions suggest that a large number SNP pre-dating species separation will be available for assay development. From the
practical standpoint this means that it is possible to
develop a SNP array with informative SNPs across multiple Eucalyptus species. However the success of such an
effort will strongly depend on their phylogenetic relationship and an extensive sampling of genome
sequences of numerous individuals of each species.
Furthermore all SNPs developed in our study were
derived from expressed sequences, including 5’ untranslated regions and exons. Kulheim et al. [49] showed a
considerably higher SNP variability in introns when
compared to exons in 23 genes in four Eucalyptus species. This result suggests that a higher SNP conversion
rate could possibly be obtained in future SNP development efforts by screening SNPs derived from genomic
sequences generated by massive NGS. On the other
hand, however, the highest polymorphism of intronic
and intergenic sequences should render more challenging the selection of SNPs with flanking sequences with
no additional SNPs.
SNP genotype calls match sequencing data and are
correctly inherited in inter-specific crosses

SNP validation was carried out two-ways: by parent-parent-offspring allele transmission test in two unrelated
pedigrees and by shallow next-generation sequencing of
a single individual of E. camaldulensis. The inheritance

Page 11 of 18

assessment showed an overall high rate of correct Mendelian transmission with almost 99% of correct genotype
calls in the E. grandis × E. urophylla pedigree and above
95% in the more diverse four-species pedigree. Reported
genotyping inheritance miscall rates with the GGGT
assay have been essentially zero in humans [33] and
rarely reported for non-model plant genomes. Recently
however, a global genotyping error rate of 0.54% in 188
SNPs was reported for Pinus pinaster [10] and between
zero and 1% in polyploid wheat [52]. While the genotyping miscall rate of 1.2% in the E. grandis × E. urophylla
pedigree falls within expectations, the much higher 4.3%
rate in the four-species family is probably a result of a
reduced SNPs transferability to this more diverse genomic background. Alternatively these higher miscall rates
could be due to paralogous genomic sequences being
assayed, although generally this has not been a major
problem with the GGGT even in complex plant genomes [27]. We decided to use inter-specific pedigrees
for a rigorous SNP inheritance assessment considering
that several envisaged application of SNP genotyping in
Eucalyptus will contemplate progenies from wide interspecific crosses both for QTL mapping and the implementation of Genomic Selection. In both of these applications, however, a low proportion of genotype miscalls
can be tolerated. This multi-species inheritance validation should be useful to reveal error-prone SNPs providing an additional selection criterion when developing a
larger set of SNPs for genus wide genotyping in
Eucalyptus.
Concordance between GGGT called genotypes and
short-read sequencing was 86%. This NGS-based SNP
validation approach is practical, especially in highly heterozygous genomes where direct amplicon sequencing
can be challenging, but evidently has some limitations
as SNP sampling is strongly dependent on sequence
coverage. Five divergent genotypes were called homozygous by the GGGT assay and inferred as heterozygous
by sequencing. A manual curation of these discordant
cases suggested that these could be due to paralogous
genes being sequenced, although they could also be
caused by sequencing errors. Two SNPs called as heterozygous by the GGGT but homozygous by sequencing
correspond to false positives possibly due to the small
number of reads available, only five for one SNP and six
for the other (Additional file 3).
SNP detection with MIRA could significantly enhance SNP
conversion rates

In an attempt to establish useful in silico predictors to
guide future SNP development efforts, we further investigated the impact of the in silico variables used in the
pipeline on SNP reliability measured by the GeneCall50
score and polymorphism by the MAF in E. grandis for

Grattapaglia et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:65
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/65

which a large number of EST sequences was available.
These variables were: 1) in silico estimated MAF; 2) the
number of EST reads of a species at the SNP site; and
3) minimal distance to the next SNP site. GeneCall50
and MAF were modeled as binary response variables
based on the established thresholds, i.e. SNPs were considered reliable if GeneCall50 ≥ 0.4 and unreliable
otherwise and polymorphic if MAF ≥ 0.05 and monomorphic otherwise. Data were analyzed by means of a
logistic regression [53] using each one of the explanatory variables above. The criterion for considering a
SNP as polymorphic in silico was the presence of at
least two reads with an alternative allele. The only significant explanatory variable for SNP reliability was the
distance to the adjacent SNP site (Additional file 4), corroborating previous results. However the allele frequencies at SNP sites in the EST contigs (in silico MAF) and
distance to the adjacent SNP site are not reliable predictors for SNP polymorphism. Interestingly, however,
upon reviewing our SNP mining pipeline, we noticed
that besides the final SNP calling by PolyBayes, an earlier SNP prediction is performed by MIRA, the EST
clustering program. We therefore set to investigate the
relative performance of both SNP calling approaches for
the 696 genome-wide SNPs, reminding that all SNPs
tested in the genotyping assay were predicted by PolyBayes with ≥99% probability. However, not all SNPs
were tagged as such by MIRA. This inconsistency suggested the possible presence of SNP miscalls, which can
be consequential to assay polymorphism. Out of the 696
SNPs considered, 632 were deemed reliable for E.
grandis (GeneCall50 ≥ 0.4) and were divided in two
classes: in silico SNPs tagged (348) and not tagged (284)
by MIRA. When SNPs in these two classes were classified for polymorphism, a clear trend emerged indicating
that a significantly larger proportion of SNPs called in
silico by both PolyBayes and MIRA were in fact polymorphic in the GGGT assay when compared by those
called exclusively by PolyBayes (p = 0.00024). Considering SNPs predicted only with PolyBayes the conversion
rate was 43.4%. For SNPs called by both PolyBayes and
MIRA the conversion rate was 58.1%. This result could
be explained by the way that the two SNP calling algorithms operate. Polybayes likely suffered from the relatively large number of ESTs obtained in GeneBank for
which no base quality values were available. In these
cases an arbitrary Q value of 15 was assigned, a procedure that later impacted the estimate of SNP probability.
MIRA, on the other hand, uses a sliding window of
sequence quality instead of a single column, a strategy
that favors the estimation of base quality and consequently an enhanced accuracy in SNP detection. This
unexpected result suggests that in future SNP

development efforts SNP tagging by MIRA could lead to
higher SNP conversion rates.
SNPs are reliable across Eucalyptus species and subgenera

Very few studies to date assessed the transferability of
the same SNP genotyping array across a wide range of
species within the same genus. In grape, transferability
of SNPs assayed by the SNPlex™ Genotyping System
(Applied Biosystems Inc.) averaged 18.8% across V. vinifera wild forms and only 2.3% when genotyping nonvinifera Vitis species. Only 4 SNPs out of 137 were polymorphic (MAF values ≥ 0.30), in non-vinifera Vitis species [35]. In the genus Picea in 279 resequenced genes
that had at least one SNP in each of white spruce (P.
glauca) and black spruce (P. mariana), only 4.7% of the
observed SNPs were shared between the two species,
requiring the development of separate 768 SNP arrays
for each species. Recently, NGS of reduced representation libraries from 10 cultivated V. vinifera varieties and
6 wild Vitis species was used to develop a selected set of
8,898 SNPs and 24.3% of the were shared between V.
vinifera and wild Vitis species [13]. In bovines when the
50K BovineSNP50 assay was applied to a set of DNA
samples from six other species within Bovinae, including
two from different genera, over 96% of the SNP produced genotype calls for at least five of the species
including the four species within the genus Bos but only
between 1 and 5% of the SNP that produced genotype
calls were polymorphic despite the relatively recent
divergence (1-5 Mya) between these species and Bos
taurus [50]. In our study SNP genotyping reliability
rates were high across nine species belonging to three
sections within subgenus Symphomyrtus with more that
83% of the SNPs with call rates ≥ 95% and GeneCall50
≥ 0.4 between 92% and 95%. Transferability rates were
still satisfactory when going across subgenera with over
50% of the SNPs showing call rates ≥ 95% in two more
distant species (Table 5). Estimates of divergence times
among eucalypt lineages are still controversial. Those
based on climatic and tectonic events suggest that the
radiation of species within sections (<2 Mya) and sections within subgenus Symphyomyrtus (5-10 Mya) [54]
are much more recent than estimates from molecular
dating (5-10 Mya) and (13-36 Mya) respectively [55].
The relatively high transferability rates of our SNP panel
across sections of Symphyomyrtus and even across distinct subgenera most likely agrees with a more recent
species divergence and/or the maintenance of large
population sizes over time and suggests that a reasonable proportion of SNPs developed for species of Symphyomyrtus pre-date the divergence from other
subgenera and could be useful for genetic analysis in
more distant species of Eucalyptus.

Conclusion and perspectives

We have shown that a large number of SNPs assayed by
the GGGT can be successfully developed from in silico
sequence resources for a complex genome with very
high nucleotide diversity. Using a systematic approach
we have also shown that the application of stringent criteria on SNP flanking sequences in silico provides
enhanced SNP reliability and good conversion rates
across multiple species despite the absence of several of
them in the EST collection used for SNP discovery.
Although this might be a distinctiveness of Eucalyptus,
where species radiation is probably recent, this study
suggests that the Golden Gate assay could be a practical
SNP genotyping method to carry out SNP-based population genomics studies in other outbreeding tropical tree
genera. Nevertheless, SNP conversion success will be
strongly dependent on having a representative and deep
collection of sequences of the target species and a
robustly selective SNP discovery pipeline including a
moderate quality draft genome sequence now within
reach for many species using third-generation singlemolecule real-time DNA sequencing [56].
This study has provided the groundwork for a larger
scale effort to develop a significantly larger SNP array
for Eucalyptus. Following the successful reports published for a number of species to date [2,13,50], we are
now using deep sequencing of reduced representation
libraries (RRLs) to develop a large numbers of informative SNPs across the main species of Eucalyptus planted
worldwide. SNPs discovered in diverse RRLs will provide
exceptional opportunities to discover ancestry informative SNPs for genome-wide phylogenetic reconstructions
and dating at different levels in Eucalyptus and related
genera. Finally, a higher density SNP platform could be
instrumental to implement Genomic Selection in Eucalyptus [57] although datapoint costs have to drop by an
order of magnitude to become economically viable in
tree breeding programs that encompass tens of thousands of samples. The current DArT marker array provides adequate density and genome-coverage at
unbeatable costs [46]. However co-dominant SNPs
would provide an added advantage to estimate haplotypes and allow the inclusion of non-additive effects in
the predictive models, thereby increasing the expected
accuracy of genomic predicted breeding values.

Methods
EST resources

Three EST datasets were used in this work. The first one
is a Sanger 5’ sequenced set of 101,240 ESTs from
E. grandis, E. globulus, E. pellita and E. urophylla generated in the Genolyptus project [58]. The second one is a
Sanger set of 34,801 sequences downloaded from dbEST
that included 1,990 sequences from E. grandis, 19,860

Page 13 of 18

from E. gunnii, 13,863 from E. globulus and the remaining from other species. The third was a dataset of
1,028,654 ESTs from NCBI SRA [accession SRX000427]
generated from 21 individual trees of E. grandis using the
454 pyrosequencing technology [18]. These are the final
numbers of sequences following removal of possible contaminations with vector, linker and adaptors using SeqClean and Crossmatch [59]. Poly (A/T) tails were
trimmed, retaining a short 6-10 bp sequence to get quality ESTs for subsequent clustering, alignment and assembly. To assist in avoiding over-trimming of the
hypothesized polyA/T site, an iterative scan for such
homo-oligomers was implemented with est2assembly
[60]. This routine also contributes to minimize errors
produced by the 454 pyrosequencing methodology
regarding detection of homopolymer sequences. Usersupplied files with Phred scores [61] when available, were
used as a measure of sequence quality in the pipeline.
EST datasets downloaded from dbEST without associated
quality information had their scores internally computed
during the alignment process using Phrap [62].
EST clustering and alignment

ESTs derived from each Eucalyptus species and with each
technology (Sanger or 454) were grouped separately into
clusters, each one expected to correspond to a single
DNA segment and then aligned with the help of the
user-supplied and internally computed base quality information using Phrap for Sanger reads or Newbler for 454
reads. Clustering was carried out using an algorithm
based on the dissimilarity measures criteria with subword
comparisons. Evaluation of the suitability of string dissimilarity measures for EST clustering was reported earlier [63]. The wcd EST clustering system [64] used in this
study is an open source clustering system that provides
efficient implementation of different dissimilarity measures, heuristics for speeding up clustering, a pre-clustering booster based on suffix arrays, as well as parallelized
implementations based on MPI and Pthreads. The wcd
EST clustering can be used to cluster large sets of mixed
EST and RNA sequences, and is adaptable to shorter
length error-prone sequencing technologies. For alignment, conservative Phrap parameters were applied to
prevent misalignments in the resulting clusters and data
quality information was used to ensure that maximum
numbers of individual sequences were retained. A similar
Phrap alignment investigation approach was used when
processing sequences for loblolly pine SNP identification
[65]. Clustering of the 454 sequences was carried out
using Newbler 2.3 (Roche-applied.science.com). Aligned
sequences in clusters comprised two or more sequences
and could be a combination of one or more contigs.
Sequences not aligned within a cluster corresponded to
ESTs that were considered as unique within each dataset,

Grattapaglia et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:65
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/65

i.e. singlets. Contigs and singlets were joined into one
single FASTA file and another single file with quality
data information was obtained. Each sequence in the
FASTA file was identified in a third accompanying file
which contained information about the Eucalyptus species of origin.
EST assembly and identification of candidate SNPs

A general pipeline was put in place based on the software MIRA 2 - Whole Genome Shotgun and EST
Sequence Assembler V2.9.25 with the enhanced 454 and
Illumina/Solexa support. MIRA is an EST sequence
assembler that specializes in reconstruction of pristine
mRNA transcripts, while at the same time detecting and
classifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
occurring in different variations thereof [66]. MIRA
combines a redundancy based approach with a symbolic
pattern analyzer developed for recognition of column
discrepancies in sequence alignments to allow detection
of SNPs. In the algorithm implemented by MIRA the
decision on whether discrepancies between similar EST
sequences are significant or not relies more on the
underlying quality information data. Under those circumstances, even a discrepancy caused by a single base
in a single column of an alignment can be seen as a
hint for a SNP site, i.e., if the base probability values of
the bases in the immediate area are high and do not
allow an alternative sequencing error hypothesis. The
most important criterion adjudicating a SNP was therefore the group qualities of the bases in the immediate
area of the SNP site - a SNP block - that can be calculated for different bases in a column. To investigate if
group qualities of the bases in the vicinity of the SNP
site could serve as a good predictor of true SNPs, SNPs
from each one of those tags together with other nontagged sites were selected from the list generated by
MIRA. The selected predictors representing this classifier are a combination of two measures provided by the
MIRA Assembler at the SNP site: the major allele score
and the minor allele score. The minor allele is the allele
occurring in the minority of the sequences at the SNP
site, while the other is called the major allele. All the
tagged or non-tagged SNP sites from the previous
assembly step were submitted to an in silico evaluation
for assessing the probability that a given site was polymorphic. SNP prediction was carried out using PolyBayes version 3.0 [67] with a p prior of 0.01
corresponding to an expected mean frequency of one
SNP every 100 nucleotides and putative SNPs called
with a stringent cutoff probability of PSNP≥ 0.99.
SNP selection for GGGT assay design

Following the Polybayes probability and SNP vicinity
scores provided by the alignment, a set of parameters

Page 14 of 18

were defined to construct filters to select SNPs for the
GGGT assay design. Initially all SNPs had to have at
least 60 bases available on each SNP side to allow
designing allele and locus specific oligos for the GGGT
assay. Additionally the following parameters were used:
(1) the in silico estimated minor allele frequency (MAF)
at the SNP site; (2) the number of EST reads by target
species aligned at each SNP site; and (3) the presence of
additional SNPs along the SNP flanking sequences. The
impact of these parameters on SNP reliability and polymorphism validated by the GGGT assay was evaluated
by sequentially implementing increasingly stringent
in silico SNP filtering levels as follows:
Filter F0

bi-allelic SNPs with ≥ 5 reads on SNP position, and a
minimum of one read with the alternative base;
Filter F1

bi-allelic SNPs with ≥ 5 reads on SNP position and a
Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) ≥ 0.2;
Filter F2

same as F1 plus a minimum of one read derived from
E. globulus or E. gunnii; these species belong to the section Maidenaria, phylogenetically separate from
E. grandis, E. urophylla and E. pellita that belong to section Latoangulatae;
Filter F3

same as F2 plus a minimum of 100 bases on each SNP
side without repetitive elements and a minimum of 20
bases flanking the SNP on each side without any additional SNPs in the contig;
Filter F4

same as F3 but increasing to a minimum of 60 bases
flanking the SNP on each side without any additional
SNPs in the contig.
As the SNPs were derived from cDNA sequences, the
occurrence of intron/exon border in the flanking
sequences upon which the oligos are later designed, may
cause significant genotyping failure [51]. To mitigate this
problem an additional analysis based on the Exonerate
program [68] using the est2genome model, was implemented on all SNPs that passed one or more of the five
filters. Only SNPs that had 30 bp on each side belonging
to the same exon were selected. The 4.5X draft genomic
assembly of Eucalyptus grandis used as reference was
downloaded from the EUCAGEN (Eucalyptus Genome
Network) site at http://Eucalyptusdb.bi.up.ac.za.
From each one of the five filtered subsets of SNPs a
random sample between ~300 and 600 SNPs was
derived to be subsequently submitted to the Assay
Design Tool (ADT) made available by Illumina with a
target of having between 96 and 288 SNPs to be effectively designed and validated. Each SNP receives a SNP
score that is a predictor of the likelihood of genotyping
success using the GGGT assay. ADT generates scores

Grattapaglia et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:65
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/65

for each SNP that could vary from 0 to 1. According to
the Illumina standard recommendations, a SNP with
score ≥ 0.6 has a high probability to be converted into a
successful genotyping assay. Based on the ADT scores
returned by Illumina, a subset of SNPs to be included in
the SNP bead array was randomly selected from the
final set of SNPs obtained with a more stringent ADT ≥
0.8 for each one of the five filter treatments.

Symphomyrtus, and E. cloeziana and E. pilularis belonging to two different subgenera, Idiogenes and Eucalyptus,
respectively. DNA extractions from fresh expanded
leaves were carried out as described earlier using a modified CTAB procedure [75] and quantified using the
PicoGreen assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a
Nanodrop 3300 micro-volume fluorospectrometer and
standardized to Illumina-specified concentrations for
SNP genotyping (50-100 ng/μL).

SNPs selected in candidate genes

A list of 42 genes described in the literature as being
putatively associated with relevant wood phenotypes in
Eucalyptus was compiled. These were genes involved in
lignin biosynthesis [69,70], genes derived from expression studies of wood formation using microarrays
[71,72], expression-QTL mapping [73,74] and association studies [48]. GenBank accession numbers for these
genes or their names as described in the respective
papers were used to select and assemble ESTs from the
databases for SNPs discovery. All SNPs that satisfied the
standard requirement of 60 bases of available sequence
on each SNP side and at least two reads with alternative
bases at the SNP position (i.e a more relaxed selection
than Filter F0 which required ≥ 5 reads at the SNP position) were submitted to the Illumina assay design tool
and those with ADT score ≥ 0.6 were subsequently
selected to populate the bead pool array.
Plant material and DNA extraction

Population samples of unrelated trees of each one of the
five most widely planted and bred species worldwide
were used for SNP reliability, inter-specific transferability and polymorphism assessment. All these five species
belong to the same subgenus Symphomyrtus but to different sections. Sample sizes were N = 24 for E. grandis
(section Latoangulatae), N = 24 for E. globulus (section
Maidenaria), N = 16 for E. urophylla (section Latoangulatae), N = 16 for E. camaldulensis (section Exsertaria)
and N = 16 for E. nitens (section Maidenaria), totaling
96 individuals. For E. grandis, twelve trees from each of
two different provenances were sampled, Atherton (17°
15’S 145°28’E) and Coffs Harbor (30°18’S 153°07’E); for
E. globulus twelve trees were from Jeeralang (38°24’S
146°28’E) and twelve from Flinders Island (40°00’S 148°
07’E); for E. urophylla all trees were from Flores Island
(8°39’S 122°15’E), for E. camaldulensis all trees were
from Walsh River (17°17’S 144°88’E) and for E. nitens
trees were from Eastern Ebor (30°24’S 152°29’E). Small
samples of N = 8 individuals were also genotyped for
other six species of more limited world relevance to
provide a preliminary assessment of SNP transferability
across a wider inter-specific range and across two additional subgenera. These were: E. dunnii, E. saligna, E.
tereticornis, these four also belonging to the subgenus

SNP genotyping

Selected SNPs were used to construct an Illumina bead
array of 768 SNPs based on the GoldenGate assay (Illumina Inc., San Diego, California). Out of these 768
SNPs, 696 were distributed across the five SNP selection
filters while 72 SNPs were derived from specific candidate genes. Genotyping was performed using an Illumina BeadStation 500 GX (Illumina, San Diego, CA) at
the Genome facility of the Interdisciplinary Center for
Biotechnology Research (ICBR) of the University of
Florida using the protocol described earlier [76]. SNP
data were analyzed using GenomeStudio V2009.2 Genotyping module 1.5.16 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) that
clusters and calls the data automatically, allowing visualization of the data directly for downstream analysis.
Call rates, GeneTrain and GenCall scores were exported
using the GenomeStudio internal Locus Summary
Report Tool for the subsequent analysis of SNP reliability and polymorphism.
SNP genotyping reliability

SNP reliability was evaluated by the GeneTrain and the
GeneCall scores. The GenTrain score, a statistics with a
value between 0 and 1, was estimated for each SNP to
assess the quality of the shapes of the genotype clusters
(homozygous and heterozygous) and their relative distance to each other. A GenCall score, estimated for each
datapoint (SNP × individual sample), is designed to rank
particular DNA samples or SNP loci and is obtained by
the product of the GenTrain Score and a data-to-Bayesian-model fit score as implemented by the Genome
Studio software. Genotypes with lower GenCall scores
are located further from the center of the genotype cluster and have a lower reliability. To assess the reliability
of each individual SNP the GenCall scores for all typed
samples for each SNP were used to estimate a GeneCall50 (GC50) score that corresponds to the 50th percentile (median) of the distribution of the GenCall
scores for that SNP. A GeneCall50 score threshold ≥
0.40 was used to declare a SNP reliable. SNPs genotyping performance was additionally assessed by the call
rate for each SNP using a GeneCall score cutoff ≥ 0.25
for each datapoint (SNP × Individual sample) following
the Illumina recommended threshold for GGGT [76].

Grattapaglia et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:65
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/65

Reliability parameters were evaluated consolidating genotyping data for all species that had 16 or more individuals genotyped and for each species separately.
SNP polymorphism information content

Polymorphism was evaluated by the conventional MAF
(Minimum Allele Frequency) parameter. A SNP was
considered polymorphic if MAF ≥ 0.05. Polymorphism
was evaluated consolidating data for all samples
together, irrespective of species, and also for each species separately but only for those species that had at
least 16 samples (32 chromosomes) analyzed. Species
for which only eight individuals were analyzed could not
provide acceptable estimates of polymorphism level.
Assessment of the in silico variables on SNP reliability and
polymorphism

Goodness-of-fit for normality tests were carried out on
GeneTrain and GeneCall50 scores estimated for each
SNP. Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests were carried
out to assess the impact of the SNP filtering levels (F0
through F4) on GeneTrain and GeneCall50 scores.
Furthermore, using a GeneTrain score ≥ 0.4, a GC50
score ≥ 0.4, a call rate ≥ 95% as thresholds for declaring
a reliable SNP and a MAF ≥ 0.05 as a threshold to
declare a polymorphic SNP, pair-wise Chi-square Pearson contingency tests were used to assess the impact of
the five filtering levels on the final proportions of SNPs
declared as being reliable and polymorphic. The final
SNP conversion rate estimated by the proportion of
polymorphic SNPs (MAF ≥ 0.05) within the ones
deemed reliable (GeneTrain score ≥ 0.4 and GeneCall50
score ≥ 0.4) was estimated for the whole data set and
for each one of the main five species separately.
Inheritance-based SNP validation

Heritability of SNP allelic transmission was calculated
for each SNP using data from a total of 48 parent-parent-offspring trios involving different Eucalyptus species
as parents. Both parents and 24 offspring individuals
were randomly selected from each one of two segregating populations, one derived from a E. grandis × E. urophylla interspecific cross and the second one from a
four-species cross involving a E. dunni × E. grandis
male parent and a E. urophylla × E. globulus female parent. Heritability was estimated using Genome Studio
internal heritability report tool by counting the proportion of correct allelic transmissions for each set of 24
trios.
Sequence-based validation of SNP genotypes

Genotypes for queried SNPs were validated for a sample
of E. camaldulensis by comparing the GoldenGate called
genotypes with NGS based genotypes derived from

Page 16 of 18

shotgun genomic reads (Illumina 2 × 76 bases pairedend reads) providing an estimated 2X coverage of the
630 Mbp Eucalyptus genome. Sequence based genotypes
were called only for SNP positions that had at least five
clustered reads on the reference genome and sequence
quality Q ≥ 20. A sample size of 5 reads provides an
expected probability of 0.9375 of detecting at least one
read with the alternative allele if the genotype is heterozygous. Sequence based genotypes were declared based
on a simple binomial test where a null hypothesis of an
expected 1:1 ratio of the read counts was set. When the
null hypothesis was not rejected a heterozygous genotype was declared. Rejection of the null hypothesis, on
the other hand, led to the inference of a homozygous
genotype at the SNP.
