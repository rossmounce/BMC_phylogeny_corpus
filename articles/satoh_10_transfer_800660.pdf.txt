Transfer RNA gene arrangement and codon
usage in vertebrate mitochondrial genomes:
a new insight into gene order conservation

Abstract
Background: Mitochondrial (mt) gene arrangement has been highly conserved among vertebrates from jawless
fishes to mammals for more than 500 million years. It remains unclear, however, whether such long-term
persistence is a consequence of some constraints on the gene order.
Results: Based on the analysis of codon usage and tRNA gene positions, we suggest that tRNA gene order of the
typical vertebrate mt-genomes may be important for their translational efficiency. The vertebrate mt-genome
encodes 2 rRNA, 22 tRNA, and 13 transmembrane proteins consisting mainly of hydrophobic domains. We found
that the tRNA genes specifying the hydrophobic residues were positioned close to the control region (CR), where
the transcription efficiency is estimated to be relatively high. Using 47 vertebrate mt-genome sequences
representing jawless fishes to mammals, we further found a correlation between codon usage and tRNA gene
positions, implying that highly-used tRNA genes are located close to the CR. In addition, an analysis considering
the asymmetric nature of mtDNA replication suggested that the tRNA loci that remain in single-strand for a longer
time tend to have more guanine and thymine not suffering deamination mutations in their anticodon sites.
Conclusions: Our analyses imply the existence of translational constraint acting on the vertebrate mt-gene
arrangement. Such translational constraint, together with the deamination-related constraint, may have contributed
to long-term maintenance of gene order.

Background
The animal mitochondrial (mt)-genome generally
encodes 13 protein, 2 rRNA, and 22 tRNA genes.
Although their arrangement is rather variable among
invertebrate mt-genomes, a typical gene arrangement
has been highly conserved among vertebrate mt-genomes from jawless fishes to mammals with some exceptions [1,2]. This implies an extremely long-term
persistence of mt-gene order probably for > 500 million
years across diverse clades of vertebrates. However, it
has been unclear whether such high-conservation of
gene order is a consequence of some constraints, or
whether it results only by sharing a common ancestry.

This has been a long-standing enigma for more than
20 years since the initial reports of the whole mt-genome sequence of vertebrates [3].
To address this problem, we analyzed codon usage
and tRNA gene arrangements of the vertebrate mt-genomes to examine possible constraints on the gene order
of vertebrate mt-genomes.

Results and Discussion
Amino acid usage and tRNA gene arrangement

We began by focusing on the fact that all of the 13 proteins encoded by the vertebrate mt-genomes are transmembrane proteins [3], which are rich in hydrophobic
amino acid residues (Fig. 1). The frequency of codon
usage for hydrophobic amino acids is, consequently,
higher in the vertebrate mt-genome (0.624, the mtREV
matrix [4]) compared to a general nuclear genome
(0.490, the JTT matrix [5]). Based on this observation,
we divided the mt-tRNA genes into two groups

representative proteins encoded by vertebrate mitochondrial
(mt) and nuclear (nc) genomes. Hydrophobic residues (Phe, Val,

(light; PDB: 1V55). In these panels, the protein subunits encoded by
mt-genes are shown by space-filling models, and the remaining
subunits encoded by nc genes are shown by Van der Waals’ surface
dot models. The lower panels show globular proteins encoded by
nc-genomes: human hemoglobin A (PDB: 1BZ0) and lysozyme (PDB:

using the program RasMol [30].

according to the hydrophobicity of their corresponding
amino acids, and then examined their positions in the
vertebrate mt-genomes (Fig. 2). This revealed that genes
for tRNAs that specify hydrophobic amino acids (Fig. 2,
colored magenta) are located close to the control region
(CR; [6]) compared with the other genes for tRNAs
specifying hydrophilic amino acids (Fig. 2, colored blue;
p = 0.0295, Mann-Whitney U-test, U = 27.000, n1 = 10,
n2 = 12; the detailed data based on human mt-genome
is shown in Table 1).

Base-pair distance between the 3’-end of control region and the 5’-end of

Such tRNA gene localization may indicate that, in the
typical vertebrate mt-genomes, highly-used tRNA genes
are located in the genomic region close to the CR, where
the transcription efficiency is thought to be relatively high.
The transcription of the vertebrate mt-genome is initiated
from regulatory elements within the CR [6,7], and thus,
the complete transcription of the genes into mRNA and
functional RNAs would be more successful in the genomic
region closer to the CR. In fact, the two rRNA genes
immediately adjacent to the CR (12 S and 16S; see Fig. 2)
are highly expressed [8]. Likewise, the tRNA genes localized close to the CR, which specify hydrophobic residues,
would also be highly expressed. Such an efficient production of the highly-used tRNAs may be favorable for translation of vertebrate mt-genomes.

species, the tRNA gene arrangement with regards to
amino acid usage can be assessed more quantitatively by
analyzing a correlation between physical (base pair [bp])
distance from the CR to each tRNA gene and codon
usage of the mt-genome. We analyzed correlation
between these two parameters using both parametric
and non-parametric methods based on the mt-genome
sequences of 47 representative vertebrates from jawless
fish, cartilaginous fish, ray-finned fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals (species names are listed in
Table 2). Among these 47 species, 33 represent the
“evolutionarily stable” mt-gene orders including the typical gene arrangement of vertebrates and slightly rearranged gene orders of lamprey and birds (supplementary
Fig. S1 [see Additional file 1]). The remaining 14 species
from ray-finned fish, amphibians, and reptiles represent
rearranged gene orders within these lower taxa. More
rearranged mt-genomes were sampled from ray-finned
fish (8 species) than from amphibians and reptiles
(6 species) because ray-finned fish is a sister group to all
tetrapods, and shows greater diversity in terms of
mt-gene rearrangements.
In the correlation analysis, we aimed to eliminate the
effects of shared common ancestry [9] based on independent contrast analysis [10] of the codon usage and
tRNA positions. Independent contrasts for these two
variables were estimated using the program CAIC [11]
based on a composite tree of the sampled species that
was constructed from recent molecular phylogenies for
the major clades of vertebrates (supplementary Fig. S2
[see Additional file 1]). This method focuses on differences only between sister lineages or nodes in a phylogeny, which have arisen after a split, therefore yielding
sets of independent “contrasts” [10]. Our data points
were derived from ancestral states (namely, various
nodes across the tree) based on independent contrasts
of tRNA genes (listed in supplementary Table S1, Table
S2, and Table S3 [see Additional file 1]). Thus, many
data points were above the level of major clades such as
mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, actinopterygians,
chondrichthyans, and agnathans, and the total number
of data points became much smaller than the number of
pair-wise comparisons.
As a result, we found a significant correlation between
the tRNA positions and codon usage (Fig. 3; evolutionarily stable gene orders: Pearson’s correlation coefficient

t = -3.9727, one-tailed p < 0.0001, n = 308, d.f. = 306; all
of the 47 mt-genomes: Pearson’s correlation coefficient r
= -0.1643, one-tailed p < 0.0001, n = 990; Spearman
rank-correlation coefficient r s = -0.1441, t = -4.4827,
one-tailed p < 0.0001, n = 990, d.f. = 988). These results
imply that the tRNA genes that correspond to highlyused codons were located nearer the CR compared with
the others. The data points for the tRNA-Leu (CUN)
and tRNA-Thr genes, however, deviated visibly from the
trend. The usage of their corresponding codons was
relatively high, although their genomic positions were
distant from their putative transcription start site in the
CR (see Fig. 3). When these two genes were excluded,
the correlation became stronger (not shown as figures;
evolutionarily stable gene orders: r = -0.4207, one-tailed
p < 0.0001, n = 304; rearranged gene orders within
lower taxa: r = -0.2760, one-tailed p < 0.0001, n = 294;
all of the 47 mt-genomes: r = -0.4121, one-tailed p <
0.0001, n = 900).
The significance of the above correlations, however, may
be due to the larger number of degrees of freedom generated by multiple-species comparisons on multiple tRNA
genes, although we sought to eliminate the effect of shared
common ancestry as described above. To limit this effect
and to corroborate our results, we took two other
approaches: first, we averaged codon usage and distance
from the CR for each of 22 tRNA across taxa, respectively,
yielding 22 independent data points of 22 non-

homologous tRNA genes. This set of data might reflect an
ancient adaptation between codon usage and tRNA positions of an original vertebrate mt-genome. Second, we
analyzed variations of codon usage and distance from the
CR of each of the 22 tRNA genes across taxa, specifically
focusing on the rearranged gene orders within lower taxa.
The second analysis might detect a recent adaptation
between codon usage and tRNA positions in taxonomic
groups concerned (lower than an order level; for details,
see supplementary Fig. S2 [see Additional file 1]).
By way of the first approach, we found a weak (but
statistically not significant) correlation between mean
codon usage and tRNA positions (Fig. 4; evolutionarily
stable gene orders: r = -0.1440, one-tailed p = 0.2613, n
= 22; rearranged gene orders within lower taxa: r =
-0.2345, one-tailed p = 0.1468, n = 22; all of the 47 mtgenomes: r = -0.1719, one-tailed p = 0.2222, n = 22),
implying that the tRNA genes corresponding to highlyused codons were located nearer the CR. This relationship became stronger and the correlation significant
when the outlier tRNA-Leu (CUN) and tRNA-Thr genes
were excluded (not shown as figures; evolutionarily
stable gene orders: r = -0.4510, one-tailed p = 0.0230, n
= 20; rearranged gene orders within lower taxa: r =
-0.4206, one-tailed p = 0.0324, n = 20; all of the 47 mtgenomes: r = -0.4503, one-tailed p = 0.0232, n = 20).
These results would support the correspondence
between codon usage and mt-tRNA positions possibly
in the origin of the vertebrate mt-genome gene order,
although such constraint might have been weak.
The second approach involving the meta-analysis of
the results of the respective 22 tRNA gene sets showed
that the rearranged gene orders within lower taxa had
little effect on the preexisting correlation between codon
usage and tRNA positions (an overall weighted Fisher’s r
= 0.0722, Stouffer’s combined p = 0.3128; the results of
the correlation in the respective 22 tRNAs are shown in
the supplementary Fig. S3 and Fig. S4 [see Additional
file 1]). This result can be explained as a result of elimination of novel gene arrangement deviating from the
relationship. In fact, among 13 of phylogenetically independent cases of gene-order rearrangements (supplementary Fig. S5 [see Additional file 1]), three cases
(deep-sea eels, frogs, and Tuatara) were observed to
have improved correlation between tRNA position and
codon usage compared to the evolutionarily stable gene
orders; majority of the cases of gene order rearrangements showed no improvement in the relationship
(detailed data are shown in supplementary Table S4 [see
Additional file 1]). This implies that not a few gene
order rearrangements without improvement have existed
for some periods of evolutionary time. It is noted, however, that the correlation between tRNA position and
codon usage was significant (or marginally significant)

and recent molecular phylogenies for vertebrates (supplementary Fig. S2 [see Additional file 1]). Data points for the tRNA genes that specify
hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids are colored magenta and blue, respectively; exceptionally, the data points for the tRNA-Leu (CUN) and
tRNA-Thr are colored light pink and light blue, respectively. The regression lines were derived from the all data points in each plot. When the
tRNA genes of H-strand and L-strand were analyzed separately, the correlation remained negative for either of the strands (data not shown).

for the above three cases only. Their novel gene order
arrangements might be maintained through some forms
of natural selection.
On the basis of these sets of analyses, we propose that
the tRNA gene arrangement of vertebrate mt-genomes,
and possibly that of an ancestral, original vertebrate mtgenome, may be adaptive with regard to translational
efficiency. The genes close to the CR, where the transcription initiation sites of both strands exist, appear to
be highly expressed in the vertebrate mt-genomes [8].
Consequently, genes of tRNAs specifying highly-used
codons would be favorably located close to the CR to
ensure the efficient translation of the protein-coding
genes in the vertebrate mt-genomes.
Mitochondrial gene arrangement and translational
constraint

the tRNA genes and mean usage of the corresponding codon.
The data points represent the average of each of tRNA across the
mt-genome sequences from (A) 33 species with evolutionarily
stable gene order, (B) 14 species with rearranged gene orders
within lower taxa, and (C) all of the 47 species selected (Table 2).
Data points for the tRNA genes that specify hydrophobic and
hydrophilic amino acids are colored magenta and blue, respectively;
exceptionally, the data points for the tRNA-Leu (CUN) and tRNA-Thr
are colored light pink and light blue, respectively. The regression
lines were derived from the all data points in the plot.

On the basis of the results obtained from our analyses,
we suggest the existence of translational constraint on
the positions of mt-tRNA genes, but not on their gene
copy numbers, in the vertebrate mt-genomes, although
the constraint may be weak. In nuclear genomes, translational selection is known to promote adaptation of
tRNA gene number to the usage of the corresponding
codon [12,13]. Clear association of tRNA gene number
with codon usage has been observed in the genomes of
various organisms ranging from E. coli to humans
[14-19]. The vertebrate mt-genome is also likely exposed
to translational selection because vertebrates are considered to be metabolically active and have high rates of
ATP synthesis. However, translational selection would
not act at the level of tRNA gene numbers in the vertebrate mt-genome since it is extremely compact and the
number of contained genes is limited.
Recently, some studies suggest the replication and
translational constraints affected the positions of translational genes such as RNA polymerase, rRNA, and tRNA
genes in bacterial genomes [20], and abundant and
broadly expressed genes in the human genome [21].
Such constraints associated with translation and gene
expression may also have limited the gene order rearrangement of vertebrate mt-genomes, specifically the
rearrangements which interfere with transcriptional efficiency of mt-tRNAs (see Fig. 3B, Fig. 4B, and supplementary Fig. S3 and Fig. S4 [see Additional file 1]). This
constraint may have driven the conservation of the mtgene arrangement among vertebrates from jawless fishes
to mammals for more than 500 million years.
Gene-order rearrangements are often found in vertebrate mt-genomes within lower taxonomic categories
such as families, genera, and species (166/769 = 21.6%
of species [22]), however, there are no extensive rearrangements shared across higher taxa, which are likely
to have persisted for long evolutionary periods of

Satoh et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:479
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/479

time [1]. This observation further implies the existence of constraint on vertebrate mt-gene orders, possibly through translational efficiency as discussed
above. Exceptionally, mt-genomes of birds and lampreys show some little deviation from the typical gene
order; either of the bird or lamprey have mt-genomes
showing some changes in tRNA-Glu, tRNA-Thr, and
tRNA-Pro gene positions (see supplementary Fig. S1
[see Additional file 1]). These non-typical gene orderings, however, interfere little with the correlation
reported above (when birds and lampreys were
excluded; r = -0.1499, one-tailed p = 0.0071, n = 267).
This also implies that the deviations of the tRNA-Leu
(CUN) and tRNA-Thr from the supported relationship
(see Fig. 3) do not arise from the rearrangements of
birds and lampreys.
We found two tRNA genes that contradict our notion.
The tRNA-Leu (CUN) and tRNA-Thr genes were
located distant from their putative transcription start
site in the CR, but the usage of their corresponding
codons was relatively high (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). The presence of such outlier tRNAs is not strange because mttRNA genes are also under constraints associated with
their other functions such as punctuation markers during the pre-mRNA processing of adjacent genes [7].
However, one attractive possible constraint on mt-tRNA
position is deamination gradients during replication and
possibly transcription of the mt-DNA [23]. Deamination
commonly occurs in single-stranded DNA exposed during replication or transcription, causing mutations from
adenine to guanine and from cytosine to thymine
[23,24]. Consequently, the gene loci exposed in single
strand for longer time in replication and transcription
are more prone to suffer these deamination mutations.
In the replication of mtDNA [25,26], the Heavy (H)strand is initially replicated from the H-strand replication origin (O H ) in the CR. The parental, original
H-strand is exposed as a single strand (see right part of
the Fig. 5A, gray line). Subsequently, using this original
H-strand as a lagging strand, the Light (L)-strand is
replicated from the L-strand replication origin (OL) in a
WANCY region [26] (Fig. 5A, green arrow). Based on
this view, the tRNA genes located more distant from the
OL along the direction of L-strand replication would be
exposed as a single strand for a longer time. Consequently, such tRNA genes are more likely to undergo
the deamination mutations. A similar deamination gradient might also exist in transcription initiated from the
CR [23].
The present analysis considering the asymmetric nature of mtDNA replication provided results match with
the above prediction (Fig. 5). The tRNA loci that are
expected to be exposed as a single strand for a longer
time tend to have more guanine (G) and thymine (T) in

Page 7 of 10

their anticodon region on the coding strands (Fig. 5A:
tRNA loci located between the O L and O H along the
direction of L-strand replication: r = 0.1750 one-tailed
p = 0.2838, n = 13; Fig. 5B: all tRNA genes: r = 0.4281
one-tailed p = 0.0234, n = 22). This suggests that the
tRNA gene arrangement of typical vertebrate mt-genome is also adaptive in avoiding mutations in anticodons through deamination during replication, and
possibly, in transcription [23]. Regarding the correlation
coefficients, the deamination-related constraint may be
stronger than the codon/amino-acid usage-related constraint discussed above.

Conclusion
In this paper, we propose that the high conservation of
the gene arrangement of the vertebrate mt-genome is
underpinned not only by a shared common ancestry,
but also by translational constraint acting on the tRNA
gene arrangement. This conclusion can be derived
from the simple observation that the mt-tRNA genes
corresponding to hydrophobic amino acids, which are
frequently used in translation of the mt-genes, are
localized close to the CR. In addition, an analysis considering the asymmetric nature of mtDNA replication
suggested that deamination-related constraint against
mutations in tRNA anticodons is also an important
determinant of the tRNA gene arrangement in the
typical vertebrate mt-genome. The translational constraint together with the deamination-related constraint may have contributed to shaping and
maintaining the typical gene order of the vertebrate
mt-genomes.
Methods
Taxonomic sampling of mitochondrial genome data

To consider variation in codon usage and gene arrangement across typical vertebrate mt-genomes, we chose
five species from each of mammals, birds, reptiles,
amphibians, actinopterygians, and chondrichthyans, and
three species from agnathans, for which only few mtgenome sequences were available in databases. Those 33
mt-genomes are defined as “evolutionarily stable” gene
orders. In addition, to include mt-genomes that have
rearranged gene orders within lower taxa, we chose
eight species from actinopterygians and three species
from reptiles and amphibians, respectively. Those 14
mt-genomes are defined as “rearranged gene orders
within lower taxa”. Species names and GenBank accession numbers of the mt-genomes are listed in Table 2:
these species were selected to represent a broad niche
breadth. The invertebrates could not be analyzed in this
study, because a transcription system of the mt-genome
and a sound phylogenetic framework are unclear for
most of them.

Figure 5 Correlation between the number of guanine (G) and thymine (T) in 1st and 2nd anticodon positions of tRNA loci and
expected time duration of single-strand exposure during mtDNA replication. The analysis is based on a human mt-genome. Data points
for the tRNA genes that specify hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids are colored magenta and blue, respectively; exceptionally, tRNA-Leu
(CUN) and tRNA-Thr are shown in light pink and light blue, respectively. (A) Analysis for tRNA genes located between the OL and OH along the
direction of L-strand replication (tRNA-Cys, -Tyr, -Ser1, -Asp, -Lys, -Gly, -Arg, -His, -Ser2, -Leu2, -Glu, -Thr, and -Pro). The expected time duration of
single-strand exposure was measured as distance from the OL along the direction of L-strand replication. This distance is named as a, as
depicted in the right part of the panel A. (B) Analysis for all tRNA genes. For the above-mentioned 13 tRNA genes (described in the legend of
the panel A), the duration of single-strand exposure was measured as a. For the other 9 tRNA genes (tRNA-Asn, -Ala, -Trp, -Met, -Gln, -Ile, -Leu1,
-Val, and -Phe), the duration of single-strand exposure was estimated as (a - b), where b is distance from the OL along the opposite direction of
L-strand replication. This is because, among those 9 tRNA loci, the tRNAs located more distant from the OL along the opposite direction of Lstrand replication remain in double-stranded DNA for a longer time based on the displacement model of mtDNA replication [26].

Measuring codon usage and the position of each tRNA
gene

The usage of each codon was counted in the sequence of
the 13 protein-coding genes (ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4,
ND4L, ND5, ND6, CO I, CO II, CO III, ATPase6,
ATPase8, and Cyt b) of the mt-genomes examined. The
overlapping codons between ATPase 8 and ATPase 6,
and between ND4L and ND4 were considered once for
each gene, because the open reading frame was different
among these neighboring genes. To measure the position
of each tRNA gene, base-pair distances from the 3’ end
of CR to the 5’ end of each tRNA gene were counted in
their respective positions on the H- and L-strands of mtgenome sequences. Although the accurate locations of
the transcription start sites of mt-genome are unknown
in most of the vertebrate species, it is assumed that the

transcription start site for heavy and light strands may
differ in distance from the 3’ end of CR on the respective
strand. Therefore, we examined whether such supposed
differences affect the analysis in this study, and we found
that the hypothetical differences of ± 150 bp and ± 500
bp in distance, which are based on a reference [27], do
not affected the significance of the results of Mann-Whitney U-test and correlation analyses shown in the Results.
Thus, we considered that measuring the positions of
tRNA genes based on their base pair distances from the
3’ end of the CR is justified.
Regression analysis considering the effects of shared
common ancestry

To examine whether the frequency of usage of each
codon varies with the position of its corresponding

tRNA gene (the base-pair distance from the CR), we calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) and Spearman rank-correlation coefficient (rs), and evaluated the
significance of the relationship both parametrically and
non-parametrically, respectively. To account for the
effect of shared common ancestry [9], “independent
contrasts” [10] for these two variables were estimated
using the program CAIC [11] based on a composite tree
of the sampled species (supplementary Fig. S2 [see
Additional file 1]). The typical mt-gene order has predominated and persisted in most of the major vertebrate
lineages for more than 500 million years, however, local
gene order rearrangements and codon usage variation
have been observed and described in vertebrates
[1,2,28]. By considering such potential changeability of
mt-gene order and codon usage, we regarded the data
points obtained from independent contrast analysis as
virtually independent of each other, although all vertebrate mt-genomes share a common ancestor. The analysis using the program CAIC was performed using
logarithmically transformed data to focus on the proportional change in the variables. The validity of this
approach is discussed in the CAIC User’s Guide [29].
