Abstract
Retroviruses have been linked to a variety of diseases such as neoplastic and immunodeficiency disorders and neurologic and respiratory diseases. Recently, a novel infectious human retrovirus, the xenotropic murine leukemia
virus-related virus (XMRV), has been identified in cohorts of patients with either a familial type of prostate cancer or
chronic fatigue syndrome. The apparent unrelatedness of these diseases raised the question of the potential involvement of XMRV in other diseases.
Here, we investigated the presence of XMRV in a selection of pediatric idiopathic infectious diseases with symptoms that are suggestive of a retroviral infection, as well as in children with respiratory diseases and in adult
patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA). Using a XMRV env-nested PCR, we screened 72 DNA samples obtained from
62 children hospitalized in the Montpellier university hospital (France) for hematological, neurological or inflammatory pathologies, 80 DNA samples from nasopharyngeal aspirates from children with respiratory diseases and 19
DNA samples from SpA. None of the samples tested was positive for XMRV or MLV-like env sequences, indicating
that XMRV is not involved in these pathologies.
Findings
Retroviruses have been isolated from a wide variety of
animal species and have been linked to a broad range of
diseases, including neoplasia, non-neoplastic hematological or inflammatory diseases, immunodeficiencies and
neurodegenerative and respiratory syndromes [1-3].
However in humans, it was not until the early 1980 s
that two pathogenic retroviruses were isolated, a deltaretrovirus, the human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV), and
a lentivirus, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Both HTLV and HIV appear to have resulted from
cross-species transmissions from non-human African
primates involving simian T-cell leukemia viruses
(STLV) and simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV),
respectively [4,5]. Interestingly, two new types of HTLV,
HTLV-3 and 4 have recently been reported [6-8]. Crossspecies transmission of gammaretroviruses amongst vertebrates has also been established. For example, the
avian spleen necrosis virus (SNV) derives from a murine

leukemia virus (MLV) and a koala endogenous retrovirus (KoRV) have been shown to be related to the gibbon ape leukemia retrovirus [9]. In 2006, an infectious
human gammaretrovirus was found in prostate tissue
samples from cancer patients [10]. Phylogenetic analyses
revealed that this virus was closely related to several
known xenotropic mouse leukemia viruses (xeno-MLV),
and thus was coined XMRV for xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus. XMRV displays more than
90% sequence identity with MLV and harbors distinct
amino acid substitutions and a short deletion in the gag
leader region. Strikingly, these combined features lead to
a putative absence of glycoGag, an alternative open
reading frame of the gag gene that has been shown to
play a role in MLV replication and pathogenesis [11].
The cellular receptor for XMRV has been shown to be
the same as for xeno-MLV, i.e. XPR1 [12], a multipass
membrane protein with unknown function [13]. XMRV
was first described in patients who develop a familial
form of prostate cancer associated with RNAse L deficiency [10]. However, in subsequent studies, a prevalence of 23% of XMRV infection in prostate cancer
patients has been reported to be independent of the
RNase L gene mutation [14]. More recently, XMRV has

also been found, with a high prevalence, in the blood of
patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), unveiling
a potential broader prevalence of XMRV [15]. Most surprisingly, the prostate cancer and CFS XMRV isolates
are almost identical with over 98% nucleotide sequence
identity. This homology suggests that XMRV has
recently arisen from a common ancestor, and that the
number of replication cycles that took place during
transmission and/or within one infected individual is
limited.
The association of XMRV with these two pathologies
remains debated in part due to the fact that several studies by European teams and a more recent one in the
United States did not detect XMRV by PCR in either
types of patients [16-22]. When detected, XMRV prevalence in the United States appears to be up to 40% and
67% in prostate cancer patients and CFS patients,
respectively, while in Northern Europe, the prevalence is
virtually zero. Furthermore, Lombardi et al., found a 4%
prevalence of XMRV in control patients from the same
geographic region [15]. In view of the striking conservation of XMRV sequences, the lack of detection of
XMRV is unlikely due to potential differences in PCR
sensitivity. Therefore, differences in the worldwide distribution of XMRV may rather result from an infection
that would have recently occurred in North America
and that is not yet widespread in other parts of the
world, or at least in Western Europe.
Retroviral pathogenesis most frequently involves
hematopoietic, neurological and/or vascular symptoms
through lytic, inflammatory or proliferative processes.
In many human diseases of unknown etiology, retroviral involvement has recurrently been suspected. Since
XMRV has been reported to be present in very different clinical entities and to a lesser extent in control
samples, we wished to address the potential presence
of XMRV in France, outside of CFS and prostate
cancer.
While cross-species transmission is likely to take place
during predatory interactions involving blood exchange,
intraspecies spreading is most likely to occur through
sexual exchanges or from mother-to-infant. Very few
studies have been performed in pediatric samples to
monitor potential retrovirus infection others than those
with HIV and HTLV. In this study, we wanted to investigate XMRV as a possible etiologic agent for a selection
of pediatric idiopathic diseases suggestive of retroviral
infection.
Blood samples or synovial fluid cells were collected
from pediatric patients less than 17 years of age
admitted at the University Hospital of Montpellier
(CHU Montpellier). This ongoing collection of pediatrics samples of idiopathic infectious diseases was
started on September 2007, in accordance to the ethical

Page 2 of 5

guidelines of the French Ministry of Health (DC-20091052). All patients or their legal representatives have
given their written informed consent.
Blood samples were drawn by venipuncture using
standard phlebotomy procedures into 2 ml sterile
microtubes containing EDTA, and synovial fluids were
obtained by needle puncture and transferred in special
collection tubes. For each samples, at least 2 aliquots
were prepared and stored at -80°C for later use. Total
DNA was isolated from whole blood or synovial fluid
cells using the QIAamp blood kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf,
France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
DNA concentrations were determined by Nanodrop
ND-1000 spectrophotometer. To ensure quality of the
DNA extracts, all samples were subjected to a singleround PCR reaction using GAPDH primers (Figure 1A).
Bacterial exploration with direct examination and culture was performed in all synovial fluid samples with no
bacterial agent found.
The present study included 72 samples obtained from
62 children who exhibited hematological, neurological
or inflammatory pathologies. All pathologies selected
are listed in Table 1. In addition, we screened 80 random nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from a cohort
of children aged < 5 years with respiratory diseases
(including mostly bronchiolitis, >90%, pneumonia and
asthma) [23].
We also screened samples from 19 adult patients with
spondyloarthritis (SpA), a chronic inflammatory disorder
resembling the juvenile idiopathic arthritis, our largest
cohort of pediatric patients. The SpA samples were previously tested for the presence of HTLV-related
sequences using a sensitive semi-nested DNA amplification method allowing the detection of all PTLV-like
sequences [24]. No HTLV-like sequences were found in
SpA patients (unpublished data).
We designed primers to specifically target XMRV-like
sequences. A 600-bp region of the SU env gene, spanning the receptor binding domain (RBD) was amplified
with the following primers with positions indicated
according to the XMRV VP35 sequence [10]: XenvS1:
5′-ATGGAAAGTCCAGCGTTCTCAAA-3′ (5754 to
5776) and XenvAS1: 5′-ATGGGGACGCGGGGCCCTACATTG-3′ (6443 to 6466) for the first round, while
primers for the second round were XenvS2: 5′;AGGAGCCTCGGTACAACGTGACAG-3 (5840 to
5863), and XenvAS2: 5′-TGGCGGGTCAGAGAGAACAGGG-3′ (6415 to 6437).
Specificity of the primers was verified in silico http://
www4a.biotec.or.th/cgi-bin/webPcr and confirmed
experimentally by PCR amplification on random human
DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs). The sensitivity of our XMRV PCR was estimated with 10-fold serial dilutions of a plasmid

us to detect both xeno-MLV and polytropic MLV
[25,26].
In contrast with our results on pediatrics respiratory
disease samples (bronchiolitis and others), Fischer et al.
found a significant proportion of XMRV gag sequences
in all of their respiratory disease patient and donor
groups (between 2 to 10%). They found the highest incidence of gag XMRV detection in the group of immunosuppressed patients (adults conditioned before
transplant) [27]. Although, this confirms that XMRV is
more likely to emerge in the context of altered immune
response, it remains perplexing that no other report
found XMRV in Europe.
We showed that our nested PCR procedure is sensitive enough to detect as few as 10 copies of an XMRV
env gene in a sample. Moreover, we have shown that we
were able to detect XMRV-related env sequences such
as xeno-MLV and the related polytropic MLV. However,
we cannot formally exclude that variant viruses lacking
the env sequences that match our primers would be present in some of these samples. Nevertheless, the remarkable conservation of XMRV env sequences described in
all the studies published so far rather argues in favor of
a bona fide absence of XMRV infection in these pathologies. Furthermore, a representative third of our samples
was also unsucessfully amplified with XMRV gag specific
primers (not shown).
As mentioned above, gammaretroviruses also participate in zoonotic transmissions [28]. Therefore, the
absence of XMRV in pediatric patients as described here
should not discourage the search for other gammaretroviruses potentially able to cross the species barrier
through recognition of human receptors by their envelope glycoproteins.
