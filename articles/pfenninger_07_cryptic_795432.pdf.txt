Abstract
Background: Cryptic species are two or more distinct but morphologically similar species that
were classified as a single species. During the past two decades we observed an exponential growth
of publications on cryptic species. Recently published reviews have demonstrated cryptic species
have profound consequences on many biological disciplines. It has been proposed that their
distribution is non-random across taxa and biomes.
Results: We analysed a literature database for the taxonomic and biogeographical distribution of
cryptic animal species reports. Results from regression analysis indicate that cryptic species are
almost evenly distributed among major metazoan taxa and biogeographical regions when corrected
for species richness and study intensity.
Conclusion: This indicates that morphological stasis represents an evolutionary constant and that
cryptic metazoan diversity does predictably affect estimates of earth's animal diversity. Our findings
have direct theoretical and practical consequences for a number of prevailing biological questions
with regard to global biodiversity estimates, conservation efforts and global taxonomic initiatives.

Background
Cryptic species are two or more distinct species that were
classified as a single species due to their morphological
similarity. Facilitated through technical advances such as
PCR and direct DNA sequencing, many phylogenetic,
phylogeographic and population genetic studies in the
last two decades discovered – frequently without a priori
intention – genetically divergent but morphologically
cryptic lineages. These discoveries continue to increase
exponentially and raise a number of general questions,
such as: How frequent are cryptic species? Are cryptic species evolutionary young? Is morphological stasis upon
speciation more often found in environmental extremes,
such as the tropics, the artic or the deep sea? A recent
review proposed that the distribution of cryptic species is

non-random across taxonomic groups and biomes, which
might have substantial consequences for biodiversity
assessments, macroecology, biogeography, conservation
management and evolutionary theory [1]. Biodiversity
estimates of certain taxonomic groups might be largely
underestimated, ecological interactions remain hidden,
conservation efforts may be inappropriate and cryptic
pathogens, parasites and invasive species might represent
unrecognised threads to human health. To tackle these
issues, we need more information on the proportion of
cryptic species in different phyla and different biomes.
Here, we analysed the Zoological Record™ database
(1978–2006) for the taxonomic and biogeographical distribution of cryptic metazoan species in relation to the
number of described species.

Results and discussion
We found 2,207 cryptic species reports (CSR) under
771,931 studies that were suitable to detect cryptic species. Log10 number of CSR were correlated with the log10
of estimated number of described species in different
metazoan taxonomic groups (Fig. 1, R2 = 0.53, F1,18 =
20.69, P = 0.0002). Deviations from the regression line,
termed CSR taxon variation, are presumably composed of
differences in study intensity and taxonomic practice in
the respective research community, true differences
among taxonomic groups and random error. In order to
assess the impact of differential research intensity, we
regressed the log10 number of studies on the log10 number
of described species in the respective taxonomic group;
the residuals were used as a measure of taxonomic study
bias (R2 = 0.64, F1,18 = 8.63, P = 0.0088). This parameter
explained part of the CSR taxon variation (Fig. 2, R2 =
0.47, F1,18 = 15.67, P = 0.0009). Assuming that the numbers of CSR are proportional to the true number of cryptic

species, their distribution is nearly homogeneous across
the taxa analysed. Only six groups fell outside the 95%
confidence intervals: Mammalia, Amphibia and combined smaller Arthropoda classes exhibited an excess of
CSR, while Bivalvia, Arachnida and combined smaller
Mollusca classes exhibited a deficit of CSR. At least for vertebrates, we suspect that these results might result from
taxonomic inflation [2]. Overall, differential taxonomic
practice in the various research communities seemingly
exerted no major impact on the results.
Applying the same procedure to the classic biogeographical regions revealed a marginally significant correlation
between the number of CSR and the proportion of
described species in the respective region (Fig. 3, R2 = 0.59,
F1,5 = 7.34, P = 0.0423). Study intensity of biogeographical regions was independent of estimated metazoan species richness (R2 = 0.41, F1,5 = 3.41, P = 0.1242). However,
regressing the residuals against each other, the same

study area in focus. Further studies will show whether this
relation holds for lower level systematic categories and
other kingdoms.

Conclusion
Our results indicate that the proportion of cryptic species
is almost evenly distributed among major metazoan taxa
and biogeographical regions when corrected for species
richness and study intensity. All users of taxonomic information must consequently be aware of the potential pres-

Species are cryptic to human perception largely due to the
lack of conspicuous differences in outward appearance.
Given their homogeneous systematic and geographic distribution, it seems therefore that morphological stasis
upon speciation represents an evolutionary constant,

independent of phylogenetic relation or ecological circumstances.
Although the true proportion of cryptic species in nature
is unknown, our results indicate that it seems to be similar
across major metazoan taxa and biogeographical realms.
Therefore, global barcoding initiatives [3], aiming at the
exhaustive treatment of selected taxa like birds or fishes
could also provide a first glimpse on the real extent of
cryptic diversity in all metazoans.
The most important consequence of our unexpected finding is, however, that cryptic metazoan diversity can be
treated as random error in biodiversity assessments [4].
There are probably not systematically more cryptic species
among insects than in reptiles or in the tropics than in
temperate regions. It stresses therefore that we should not
preferentially target specific taxonomic groups or regions
to detect cryptic species, but rather expect a predictable
proportion of cryptic diversity in each metazoan group.

Methods
The Zoological Record™ (Thomson Scientific) 1978–2006
was searched for entries containing the search term [cryptic speci* OR cryptic linea* OR cryptic tax* OR sibling
spec*] which yielded 2207 entries. Even though the term
sibling species has also the slightly different connotation
of recent divergence [5], it is used synonymously to cryptic
species in the great majority of cases. As cryptic species discovery is typically not an explicit aim in itself but a byproduct of other research, we selected a reference data set
of studies where the detection of cryptic taxa was possible.
To this end, we scanned the retrieved cryptic species data
set for typical keywords. These were sorted after approximate frequency and consecutively added to a query until
more than 90% (1990 entries) of the initial data set were
recovered. The discrepancy to 100% can be explained by
the occasional absence of abstract and keywords as well as
some articles being not in English. The final search string,
finding 771,931 entries, was [phylogen* OR taxonom*

records contain information about taxonomic affiliation
and biogeographical origin, which allowed retrieving the
number of studies performed on certain taxa and biogeographical regions. In general, our database searches were
focussed on the larger phyla within the kingdom Metazoa.
For the three most specious phyla (Arthropoda, Chordata,
Mollusca), we analysed the major classes separately (Table
1). Information on the estimated number of currently
described species for each taxon was obtained from the
IUCN 2004 report [5] and various internet resources. The
total number of metazoan species as well as their distribution across taxa closely matched numbers previously published [6]. No direct information on the species richness
of biogeographical regions was available. However, the
proportional species richness of various taxa occurring in
the same biogeographical region shows substantial consistency [7]. We estimated therefore the proportion of species harboured in each region by averaging the proportion
of mammals, amphibian and bird species as given in [5]
as proxies for total faunal richness (Table 2). Data were
log-transformed prior to standard regression analysis.
