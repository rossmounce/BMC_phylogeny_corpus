Abstract
Background: Compelling evidence indicates that Shigella species, the etiologic agents of bacillary
dysentery, as well as enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, are derived from multiple origins of Escherichia
coli and form a single pathovar. To further understand the genome diversity and virulence evolution
of Shigella, comparative genomic hybridization microarray analysis was employed to compare the
gene content of E. coli K-12 with those of 43 Shigella strains from all lineages.
Results: For the 43 strains subjected to CGH microarray analyses, the common backbone of the
Shigella genome was estimated to contain more than 1,900 open reading frames (ORFs), with a
mean number of 726 undetectable ORFs. The mosaic distribution of absent regions indicated that
insertions and/or deletions have led to the highly diversified genomes of pathogenic strains.
Conclusion: These results support the hypothesis that by gain and loss of functions, Shigella
species became successful human pathogens through convergent evolution from diverse genomic
backgrounds. Moreover, we also found many specific differences between different lineages,
providing a window into understanding bacterial speciation and taxonomic relationships.

Background
Gram-negative, facultative anaerobes of the genus Shigella, the principal etiologic agents of bacillary dysentery,
continue to pose a threat to public health, with an estimated annual incidence of 164.7 million and 1.1 million
deaths worldwide [1]. They are sub-grouped into four species: Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Shigella boydii and
Shigella sonnei. However, classification based upon serotype and other physiological properties has provided limited information regarding the genetic relationship
between the species and, moreover, is not sufficient for

making disease associations. The results of multilocus
enzyme electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing
(MLST) argue that Shigella diverged from Escherichia coli in
eight independent events and, therefore, may not constitute a separate genus [2,3]. However, these results can't
reflect the influence of horizontal gene transfer and gene
loss. And comparison of genomic differences between different flora and strains will be helpful in revealing gene
acquisition and gene loss in bacteria genome evolution,
and in revealing the genetic basis of the diversity of biological activities [4].

What remains particularly intriguing about Shigella, are
the unique epidemiological and pathological features that
each of the species exhibits. For example, Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 can cause fatal epidemics in Africa; however, Shigella boydii is restricted to the Indian subcontinent, whereas Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei are
prevalent in developing and developed countries [1].
Development of a vaccine remains a significant task.
Comparative genome information will assist achieving
this goal as well as enhance our understanding of the
pathogenesis of Shigella. Reports on the genome of the
two S. flexneri 2a strains previously revealed a dynamic
nature and unique characteristics when compared to the
genomes of close relatives, the non-pathogenic K-12
strain and enterohemorrhagic O157:H7 strain of E. coli
[5,6]. Furthermore, we also have completed a project,
which involved sequencing strains of S. dysenteriae Sd197
serotype 1, S. boydii Sb227 serotype 4 and S. sonnei Ss046,
all epidemic isolates from the 1950s in China [7]. The
release of five Shigella sequences has initiated a new era of
comparative genomics in Shigella biology. However,
sequencing remains a laborious and expensive technique,
making it difficult to obtain answers concerning the
genetic composition of serotypes, or newly emerged variants of interest in a timely manner. The technique of
microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization
(CGH) provides a valuable adjunct to current protocols
used for the assessment of differences and changes in bacterial genetic content. Indeed, this approach has already
been utilized in a variety of bacteria to probe for differences between clinical isolates, vaccine strains, species
diversity, and disease endemicity [8-11]. There is currently
data on five Shigella genomes, which can reflect four lineage gene contents of Shigella. Such diversified genomic
compositions stated previously [5-7] have prompted us to
investigate gene distributions among all lineages of Shigella using a CGH microarray approach. Herein, we present
the results of a genomic comparison of 43 Shigella strains
based on CGH analysis, which maximizes and extends the
information gained from genome sequencing efforts to
closely related strains. And this sequence information will
provide a valuable resource from which we can begin to
dissect shared and distinct features of Shigella between different lineages and start exploring how and why these differences arose. In addition, the pattern of acquisitions and
deletions detected on the DNA arrays may, to some extent,
reflect the gene contents of eight lineages and the evolution of a strain's genome.

Results
Analysis of control hybridizations indicates the level of
sensitivity of the microarray
Results for the four sequenced Shigella strains' hybridization were directly compared to expected hybridization
results as assessed by the percent identity of each MG1655

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/218

and Shigella amplicon to the four sequenced Shigella
genome sequences. From this analysis, we were able to
determine that genes with ≥ 75% identity to the amplicon
could be detected as present/conserved on our array,
whereas genes that diverged by more than 74% could be
assigned as absent/divergent (For details, see Methods). It
is noted that positive signals in the CGH analysis may not
indicate the presence of functional genes or a pathway.
For example, although fec genes are present in Sd197,
Ss046 and a few other strains, only Ss046 possesses an
intact set.
Genome order analysis of E. coli dataset reveals discrete
regions among Shigella serotypes
Generally, the results of the CGH demonstrated that the
genome contents of Shigella spp. isolates differ markedly
from that of E. coli strain MG1655. The number of ORFs,
which comprised the backbone sequence of Shigella spp.
strains used in this study, was 1955 (include 12 ORFs
which were not present in MG1655), which was less than
the number cited in previous reports [10,12]. These conserved ORFs included all 231 essential protein-encoding
genes listed in the PEC database except 19 ORFs not spotted on the microarrays [13].

2,245 ORFs of MG1655 were found to be absent in at least
one strain (see Additional file 1). These ORFs accounted
for 52.5% and 53.6% of all MG1655 ORFs annotated and
spotted on the slides, respectively. The numbers of absent
ORFs ranged from 476 in B5 to 956 in B3 (Table 1). The
mean number of absent genes was 726, which is consistent with data from a previous study [14]. There were 137
MG1655 specific ORFs absent in all strains. Among which
64 ORFs were absent in pathogenic E. coli too [10]. The
mosaic distribution of the absent regions and some gene
clusters is shown in Figure 1A. Genes for cell motility, cell
envelope, and carbohydrate transport and metabolism
genes in the MG1655 genome (Table 2) were frequently
found missing in the Shigella spp. strains (P < 0.001 based
on the two-tailed Student t-test). For example, among the
43 strains of Shigella in our study, 35 showed a loss of several flagellar genes to different extents, while the other 8
strains had almost complete flagellar gene sequences.
Moreover, E. coli surface pili have about 15 gene clusters,
among which only 3 (hofCB-ppdD, ppdC-ygdB-ppdBA, and
hofQ-yrfABCD) are found in most Shigella strains, which is
in accordance with previous results [10]. 399 identified
ORFs of MG1655 have been annotated with regulatory
functions in the PEC database [13]. Out of the 2,245 missing ORFs, 167 are regulatory genes, the majority of which
are regulatory transcription factors, including a few global
regulatory factors. This result is consistent with the findings from the previous study [10,15]. In addition, ompT,
encoding outer-membrane protease, was found lost in all

the strains, and cadA, encoding lysine decarboxylase, was
not found in most strains, either.
In general, what we found was that the gene contents of
most categories are more variable in C1 strains than those
in others. For instance, 49.4% and 40.3% genes coding for
carbohydrate and amino acid transport proteins and signal transduction proteins respectively, were absent from
at least one strain of C1. In contrast, strains from C2

shared relatively more core genes of most categories than
those from the other two groups (Table 2). However, it
should be noted that the three Shigella groups consist of
different number of strains which may also be a key influence to the count of conserved genes here.
The alterations were observed scattered over the entire E.
coli MG1655 chromosome. However, the prophages of
strain MG1655 represent chromosomal variation "hot

spots." At least 10 prophages and phage like regions were
identified in MG1655 [16,17]Shigella , but few were intact
among spp. strains.
Genes for transport and metabolism of carbohydrates
E. coli is able to utilize several types of carbohydrates.
However, Shigella has lost the capability to use some carbohydrates due to the loss of several transport and conjugated genes, which are also the basis for the biochemical
typing of Shigella spp. strains. CGH Result indicated that
the missing genes were different in different strains. By
means of CGH analysis, it was found that the lac operon
is only intact in B9 and B15, while lacA and lacY are absent
in all other strains. This result conforms to the observation
that Shigella cannot ferment lactose. Moreover, the metabolism of mannitol, melitose and glycerol are also in
accordance with the CGH results, however, results from
galactitol and rhamnose show discordance with the CGH
data. The reason for this discrepancy requires further
investigation. Furthermore, the fact that Shigella is unable
to use xylose differs from the CGH result with S. flexneri,
and may be explained to a certain extent by a terminating
mutation found occurring in xylA, the gene encoding Dxylose isomerase [5]. The CGH results for genes related to
transport and metabolism of some carbohydrates are
shown in additional file 2.
Analysis of known and putative virulence-associated genes
There were 886 Shigella ORFs that were not present in
MG1655 (non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain) on the
microarray (see Figure 1B and Additional file 3 for the
details). Since part of them were also present in some
pathogenic Escherichia coli strains, those ORFs may be
putative virulence-associated genes. Shiga toxin was only
found in D1. Previously identified Shigella pathogenicity
islands SHI-1 and SHI-2 are absent in Sd197 but present
in other sequenced strains (SHI-3 from S. boydii is essentially identical as SHI-2) [5-7]. SHI-1 encodes an enterotoxin ShET1 and proteases SigA and Pic, all implicated in
virulence [18] and SHI-2 (SHI-3) encode an aerobactin
system for iron acquisition [19,20]. Variants of the SHI-1
and SHI-2 (SHI-3) that were missing one or more marker
regions were found in most Shigella strains. The sigA gene
was conserved in most strains, while the pic gene was
absent. SHI-2 is almost complete in S. flexneri while lost
in D1 and D7. The iuc and iutA genes that encode
siderophore and its receptor in the SHI-2 (SHI-3) island
are present in all of the other strains. Sci island, the possible pathogenicity island that has been found in genome
Sf301 [5], almost exist in all S. flexneri strains except F6,
but are all missing in the other strains. And the pdu gene
cluster, which is correlated with propanediol utilization,
only exists in SS. The result of complete Shigella islands is
showed in Figure 1B, while the result of selected virulence
genes is showed in Figure 2.

The distribution of the known and putativevirulence
related genes among Shigella spp. strains. The ORFs
status is color-coded: blue, present/conserved; yellow,
absent/divergent. The designations of these genes are indicated on the right. Strains are labelled according to the designations in Table 1. The product of stxA is shiga toxin. SigA
and Pic are serine proteases. The gene clusters of iuc, iutA,
iro, sit, shu, ent-fep, fhu, feo, tonB-exb, fec and SF1192-1194 are
all iron acquisition associated. Two type II secretion systems
are encoded by yhe and gsp respectively. The products of
SDY0420-0424 are exoproteins.

Compared with E. coli k-12, most Shigella strains are missing fec, but have retained feo, fep, and fhu, and have even
developed their own iron transport system (sit, iuc, iro and
shu etc.). The type II secretion system (T2SS) encoded by
genes of the general secretion pathway is widely distributed in Gram-negative bacteria [7]. The well-known E. coli
T2SS, encoded by the yhe genes at 74.5 min of the
MG1655 chromosome, is absent in all sequenced Shigella
genomes but present in several tested strains. Moreover,

there is a novel set of gsp genes in the Sd197 and Sb227
chromosomes, which is also present in all C1 strains (see
below for details) and several other strains (Figure 2).
Lineage relationships are revealed by phylogenic analysis
Using the above CGH microarray data and the previously
published data [10], we performed phylogenic analysis
(Figure 3). The phylogenic tree shows that most of the
Shigella strains can be grouped into three clusters (C1, C2
and C3) leaving SS, D1, D8, D10 and B13 as additional
minor branches. SS is closer than D8, D1, D10 and B13 to
the main clusters. C1 contains D strains (D3, D4, D5, D6,
D7, D9, D11, D12, and D13) and B strains (B1, B2, B3,
B4, B6, B8, B10, B14, and B18) with F6 as minorities. C2
is mainly composed of B strains (B5, B7, B9, B11, B15,
B16, B17) and D2. C3 consists mostly of F strains (F1a,
F1b, F2a, F2b, F3, F4a, F4b, F5, Fx, and Fy) and B12. The
results are in good agreement with the MLST result [3],
supporting the hypothesis that Shigella species originated
from multiple E. coli strains with diverse genetic backgrounds. Furthermore, two sonnei strains are grouped with
three EIEC strains, and other pathogenic E. coli strains are
grouped together. The high bootstrap values of most
branches confirm the robustness of the tree.

In addition to what was discussed above, we also found
many specific differences between different lineages, providing a window into understanding bacterial speciation
and taxonomic relationships (Additional file 1). For
example, ybcZ/ylcA, which encodes a two-component signal transduction system that is responsive to copper ions,
is absent in three lineages (D1, D8 and cluster 1 strains),
and the locus glc, which is associated with the glycolate
utilization trait in E. coli, is only present in cluster 3 strains
(except B12), several cluster 2 strains and B13. The locus
aga, which is related to acetylgalactosamine metabolism,
is only conservative in cluster 2, B13 and D10.
F6 sits in a different cluster as compared to the other
flexneri strains and we found many differences that set it
apart (Additional file 4). For example, gsp genes, yea
genes, waaWYJI, rhsABC and several phage-related genes
were present in F6 and absent in other S. flexneri strains,
while the cai-fix gene cluster, ybcZ-ylcA-ylcB, marAB, yehABCDE, glc genes, dgoTAK, bglBFG, yih genes, malGFE and
safABC were absent in F6 but present in other members of
S. flexneri.

Discussion
Abundant information is currently available for research
on the genome evolutions of different organisms and the
exploration of the roles played by different genes in their
life processes. However, more and more evidence has
revealed that most bacteria have shown unexpected diver-

sity during the evolutionary process, even within one species [21].
Advantages and disadvantages of CGH technique
In order to systematically assess the genetic variability of
bacteria, several genome comparison techniques, e.g.,
multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, MLST, pulsed-field
gel electrophoresis and restriction fragment length polymorphisms, have been used. Microarray-based CGH has
emerged as a revolutionary platform for comparative
genomics that has recently been used for the analysis of
genome variability among bacterial species or closely
related bacteria. Given that the sequencing of strains on a
large scale is time-consuming, laborious and unfeasible at
present, CGH may resolve the problem to some extent by
applying the available genome sequence information to
closely related species. And this method can supply more
information about genome composition and provide
opportunity to analysis unsequenced strain on genomic
scale. CGH proved a useful tool in this study for identifying genetic differences between different Shigella lineages
over other techniques. Even though this technique has
several limitations as described before [14], we believe,
based on the criteria for data analysis, which we described
before, that the use of CGH technology allows sufficient
assessment of the genetic diversity and gene content
among Shigella spp. strains.
Genomic diversity of Shigella
An MLST study [3] and five reported Shigella genomes [57] have suggested strongly that Shigella is derived from
multiple origins of E. coli. And the five Shigella genomes
vary in size from 4.3 to 4.8 Mb. Our study has revealed
extensive diversity among Shigella genomes, forming a
genetic basis to explain species/strain specific epidemiological and pathological features. The phylogenic analysis
results supporting the hypothesis that Shigella have
emerged from multiple independent origins. The fact that
two sonnei strains are grouped with three EIEC strains supports the hypothesis that EIEC strains are in an intermediate stage and are a potential precursor of "full-blown"
Shigella strains [22]. Based on our results, we believe that
the reason why Shigella exhibits unique epidemiological
and pathological features is due to the loss of several genes
and gene acquisition as described above. We found many
specific differences between different lineages that never
been described before. Previous study showed that there
was over-representation of regulatory genes in the missing
ORFs in Shigella/EIEC strains [15]. Our result reconfirmed
this observation. How these genomic differences account
for the differences in epidemiology and pathology remain
to be elucidated. A comparison with respect to the new
group relationship is particularly significant in providing
insight into the virulence of Shigella, such as F6, D8, D10,
B13, etc. Furthermore, F6, which is distinct from other

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/218

flexneri strains in several ways, should not be considered a
flexneri member. And our results support the Brenner's
suggestion to transfer F6 to the Boydii subgroup [23].
Currently, there are data on five Shigella genomes, which
can reflect only four lineage gene contents of Shigella. Our
CGH results may, to some extent, reflect the entire
genome diversity within Shigella and the evolution of a
strain's genome. In addition, we found a large number of
deletions in different genes of the relevant operon in carbohydrate utilization, emphasizing strong evidence for
the extinction of these metabolic pathways. After Shigella
became pathogenic to humans, the host presented a constant environment rich in metabolic intermediates, some
genes were rendered useless by adoption of a strictly pathogenic life-style. These superfluous sequences were eliminated through mutational bias favouring deletions, a
process apparently universal in bacterial lineages [24].
The findings that diverse mechanisms appear to be
responsible for same biochemical characteristics reconfirm the convergent evolution that Shigella might have
experienced. For example, Shigella strains cannot decompose lactose, but each has resulted from a different mechanism. Some strains lost the lac operon completely, while
others only lost lacA and lacY. The reasons to no flagellum
and no motility of Shigella are also diverse.
Genetic basis for variation in virulence
Understanding the virulence of Shigella, in addition to the
CGH data, facilitates our understanding of the scenario
that underlies the difference between these organisms.
The pattern of acquisitions and deletions detected, may
explain these differences to some extent. On loss and gain
functions, it is important to recognize these differences
may enhance the virulence or lead to variation in virulence. Variants of SHI-1 that were missing one or more
marker regions were found in most Shigella strains. The
SHI-2 island is only absent in strains D1 and D7, indicating its importance to most of the strains, and the unique
iron acquisition mechanisms in the two D strains. Furthermore, our results indicate that SHI-1 and SHI-2 are
genetic elements that have disseminated throughout Shigella and diverged into distinct structural forms, emphasizing their importance in Shigella pathogenesis.

Previous study argues that the gsp genes in S. dysenteriae,
encoding the T2SS, ought to contribute significantly to
pathogenicity as it enables Stx to reach the target host cells
from proliferating bacteria[7]. Our CGH result indicates a
wide distribution of the gsp genes among strains from all
phylogenetic groups which suggests that many strains
possessed Stx before their subsequent loss. Perhaps, loss
of Stx genes has provided advantages to the bacteria for a
better adaptation to the human hosts as causing severer

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:218

disease offers little benefit to the organisms for long term
survival. It is known that the deletion of certain genomic
regions present in E. coli (so-called "black holes")
enhances the virulence of Shigella [25,26]. These pathoadaptive deletions could be identified as "absent" on the
arrays. Our CGH results demonstrated the existence of
those "black holes" in all lineages.
The comparative genomic analysis between pathogenic
and non-pathogenic E. coli strains reveals that a specific
genetic background is required for acquisition and expression of virulence factors [27]. Furthermore, we found that
the iron transport system, which is virulence related, is
reinforced in Shigella by the development of its own iron
transport system, in addition to the retention of most of
the iron transport system from E. coli. Shigella species
express numerous iron acquisition systems, reflecting the
importance of obtaining iron. A previous study which
focused on transcriptome polymorphism of Shigella/EIEC
also indicated that it was important to acquire iron for
Shigella/EIEC [15]. These results indicate that the acquisition of some genes has enhanced the ability of Shigella
species to adapt to the complicated host environment during its evolution into an intestinal pathogen.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the comparisons performed in this study
are necessary for further understanding the implications
of genetic background in the evolution of Shigella pathogenicity. These findings provide an invaluable genetic
basis for future studies examining bacterial evolution, as
well as pathogenicity, and the development of novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of shigellosis.

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth condition
We used 43 Shigella strains to represent the known serotypes. Details are given in Table 1. Shigella strains were
routinely grown at 37°C overnight on Luria-Bertani agar
plates containing 0.01% congo red. Red colonies were
inoculated into Luria-Bertani broth without antibiotics
and grown overnight at 37°C with shaking (260 rpm) for
isolating genomic DNA. And E. coli K-12 MG1655 strain
was routinely grown at 37°C overnight on Luria-Bertani
agar plates for isolating genomic DNA. Genomic DNA
was extracted by using Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega).
Microarray fabrication
The microarrays used in this study featured 4,188 of the
4,279 ORFs identified in E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 [17],
because 91 ORFs were not on the microarray of the inability to amplify these products. Furthermore, there were 934
ORFs from 4 Shigella strains (Sf301, Sd197, Sb227 and
Ss046) which were not present in MG1655 also in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/218

microarray. The ORFs cover the known and putative virulence genes from the Shigella chromosome.
ORFs were amplified with specific primer pairs (Invitrogen). To ensure that the elements of our array would
detect specifically their corresponding genes and no others, the ORF coordinates fed into the primer program were
circumscribed such that they would exclude regions of any
ORF that contained significant similarity to any other ORF
(70% identity over 70 nucleotides was considered to be
significant). Since there were ORFs from different strains,
different genomic DNA was used as target according to the
dataset.
Agarose gel electrophoresis was used to perform quality
control on all PCR products. Oligonucleotides were
removed from the PCR mix by PCR 96 cleanup plate (Millipore). DNA was resuspended in 12 μl of spotting solution containing 50% dimethyl sulfoxide. PCR products
were spotted onto gamma amino propylsilan coated
GAPII slides (Corning) with a Cartesian® arrayer (Cartesian). And arrayed slides were blocked prior to hybridization as described previously [28].
Probe preparation and hybridization
For each microarray hybridization reaction, two micrograms of genomic DNA (for test strains) and two microgram reference sample (mixed genomic DNA of MG1655,
Sf301, Sd197, Sb227 and Ss046) were fluorescently
labelled with Cy5- dCTP or Cy3-dCTP (Amersham)
respectively. The separate labelling reactions were pooled
after each respective Cy dye incorporation step and then
again divided into aliquots to minimize inconsistencies in
probe generation. Hybridizations were performed as
described previously [29]. Competitive hybridization was
done at least three times for one strain.
Microarray data analysis
The processed slides were scanned with a GenePix 4100A
scanner (Axon). Fluorescent spots and the local background intensities were quantified with GenePix Pro 5.0
software (Axon). The local background value was subtracted from the intensity of each spot. The mean of the
signal intensities of the control spots hybridized with
labelled reference genomic DNA in each experiment was
calculated. Ten different A. thaliana genes and human βactin gene from SpotReport™ cDNA Array Validation System (Stratagene) were used for the controls. The spots that
showed intensity with labelled reference genomic DNA
that was lower than the mean value of the control spots
were excluded from further analysis. The mean log2 Cy5/
Cy3 (sample/reference) ratios of signal intensity were calculated for analysis. In addition, spots that gave invalid
results for more than 20% of the strains were removed.
The final data set was 5,122 ORFs. The multiple arrays for

each strain were averaged across the datasets. CGH data
analysis was done by using Microsoft Excel and a microarray genomic analysis program called GACK according to
the previous reports [30]. GACK is capable of dynamically
generating cut-offs for conserved/divergent gene analysis
for each array hybridization and functions independently
of any normalization process that would otherwise be
strongly influenced by differences between the reference
strain and test strains.

The hybridization data for the four Sf301, Sd197, Sb227
and Ss046 arrays were filtered by using the same parameters indicated above to avoid copy number effect. The percent similarity for the highest high-scoring profile of each
amplicon in the four Shigella genomes was obtained by
using WU-BLAST. This percent similarity was compared to
the averaged logRAT2N of the hybridization data. Of the
5,122 ORFs that were retrieved, 60 ORFs had hybridization results contrary to what was expected from the percent similarity analysis. A total of 12 of these were false
positives, whereas 48 of were false negatives. This list was
used as an additional filter for the data. Genome order
analysis was performed by organizing the spots for the
entire data set in their genome order according to the
MG1655 and Sb227, Sd197, Sf301 and Ss046 annotation
and viewed with TMEV [31].

Phylogenic analysis
The E. coli data set obtained from the CGH analysis (0 =
absent and 1 = present) was fed into the Phylip software
(version 3.6 by Joseph Felsenstein, Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle). Maximum parsimony (MP) trees with equal weighting of characters were
drawn by a branch-and-bound search. Tree reliability was
assessed using non-parametric bootstrap re-sampling of
100 replicates.
