Abstract
Background: Sensing bitter tastes is crucial for many animals because it can prevent them from
ingesting harmful foods. This process is mainly mediated by the bitter taste receptors (T2R), which
are largely expressed in the taste buds. Previous studies have identified some T2R gene repertoires,
and marked variation in repertoire size has been noted among species. However, the mechanisms
underlying the evolution of vertebrate T2R genes remain poorly understood.
Results: To better understand the evolutionary pattern of these genes, we identified 16 T2R gene
repertoires based on the high coverage genome sequences of vertebrates and studied the
evolutionary changes in the number of T2R genes during birth-and-death evolution using the
reconciled-tree method. We found that the number of T2R genes and the fraction of pseudogenes
vary extensively among species. Based on the results of phylogenetic analysis, we showed that T2R
gene families in teleost fishes are more diverse than those in tetrapods. In addition to the
independent gene expansions in teleost fishes, frogs and mammals, lineage-specific gene
duplications were also detected in lizards. Furthermore, extensive gains and losses of T2R genes
were detected in each lineage during their evolution, resulting in widely differing T2R gene
repertoires.
Conclusion: These results further support the hypotheses that T2R gene repertoires are closely
related to the dietary habits of different species and that birth-and-death evolution is associated
with adaptations to dietary changes.

Background
Taste perception refers to sensations triggered by taste
buds on the surface of the tongue, which sense sweet,
salty, sour, bitter and umami flavors. These gustatory
senses are closely related to an animal's diet and external
environments [1-3]. Most taste sensations are triggered via
receptor-based sensors expressed in different taste-cell
types [4-6]. Among these chemical senses, bitter tastes are
particularly important because many poisonous substances tend to be bitter, and bitter taste perception can

allow animals to detect and avoid toxins in food [7]. This
process is mainly mediated by bitter taste receptors (T2R)
which are encoded by T2R genes.
T2R genes belong to one type of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) which are characterized by their seven conserved transmembrane regions [8]. T2Rs are the largest
family of taste receptors, which bind to tastants. T2R genes
contain an average of 300 codons, and there are no
introns in their coding regions, making them easy to

detect in whole-genome sequences. Like olfactory and
other chemosensory receptor genes, T2R genes also form
a multi-gene family and display high sequence similarity
[9,10]. T2R genes are not randomly distributed through
chromosomes; instead they tend to cluster together in a
few specific genomic regions, perhaps corresponding to
their generation by tandem gene duplications. For example, human T2R genes are mainly located in chromosomes 7 and 12, and mouse T2R genes are concentrated in
chromosomes 6 and 15 [10,11].
In previous studies, T2R gene repertoires have been
described in some mammals, chickens, frogs and some
teleost fishes [9-18]. With the availability of wholegenome sequences of animals, T2R genes can be detected
by applying data-mining methods. The nearly complete
human and mouse T2R gene repertoires have been
reported by Conte et al. [9,18] and Shi et al. [10].
Although these studies used different methods, their
results were similar. Conte and colleagues [9,18] identified 34 and 40 T2R genes in human and mouse genomes,
respectively, and Shi and co-workers [10] identified 33
and 36 T2R genes, respectively. Other vertebrate T2R gene
receptors have also been identified [15,16], for example,
those of rat, dog, opossum, chicken and some teleost
fishes. By analyzing the low-coverage genome sequence,
T2R genes have also been identified in the cow. Owing to
the different data-mining criteria used for the identification of T2R genes, results have differed among studies. For
example, Shi et al [16] identified 64 T2R genes in the frog,
whereas Go [15] only identified only 54 T2R genes. Furthermore, some studies focused on identification of Gprotein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) from genome
sequences [19-21]; however, not all GPCR-encoding
genes are T2R genes, they also include other gene families,
such as olfactory receptor (OR) and vomeronasal pheromone (VR) receptor genes. These studies also distinguished T2R genes from non-T2R GPCR genes. In
Additional file 1, we list the sizes of the T2R gene repertoires that have been well documented from a range of
species. These results indicate that the number of T2R
genes shows extensive variation among taxa. For example,
the chicken and zebrafish have only 3 and 4 intact T2R
genes, respectively, whereas the frog (Xenopus tropicalis)
has nearly 50 intact T2R genes. The number of intact genes
in the frog is therefore about 16 times greater than in the
chicken and 12 times greater than in the zebrafish. Furthermore, massive pseudogenization has occurred in
some species. These observations indicated that ability to
bitter taste might be largely determined by the number of
functional genes. Bitter taste perception in animals is
tightly coupled with diet and habitats. Differences in gene
family size are due to lineage-specific gene duplications
and losses in vertebrates, which represents an extreme
form of birth-and-death evolution [15]. Therefore, it is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/12

interesting to study the pattern of gains and losses of T2R
genes during vertebrate evolution.
Go has previously predicted the numbers of ancestral T2R
genes using the linearized tree method [15], and identified some lineage-specific gene expansions and contractions that occurred throughout vertebrate evolution.
However, this method did not characterize the gains and
losses of T2R genes in detail, especially in mammals. To
gain further insight into the evolutionary dynamics of T2R
genes, we identified more T2R gene repertoires in vertebrates, and used the reconciled-tree method to study evolutionary changes in T2R gene families [22-24]. In this
study, we provide a more comprehensive view of birthand-death processes involving T2R genes during the evolution of vertebrates, and suggest that this approach might
further improve our understanding of bitter taste sensitivities.

Results
T2R gene repertoires
T2R gene repertoires have previously been described in
some vertebrates [10,15,16,19-21]. In see Additional file
1, we list the documented sizes of T2R gene repertoires in
several species. Here, we have updated these results using
the most recent versions of the genome sequences to
obtain more accurate results. Furthermore, we have identified the T2R gene repertories of the rhesus macaque
(Macaca mulatta), horse (Equus caballus), platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), lizard (Anolis carolinensis) and stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) for the first time; Table 1
shows the number of T2R genes identified for these species.

Many genome sequences are still incomplete, so we must
be aware of the risk that some of the T2R gene repertoires
are also incomplete. Using recently available high coverage of genome sequences, most of our results are consistent with previous reports [15,16], indicating that the T2R
gene repertoires identified are nearly complete. However,
some genome sequences were still unassembled into
chromosomes, and short contigs/scaffolds might lead to
an underestimate of the number of T2R genes. Therefore,
we also identified partial T2R genes from draft genome
sequences, and these might contain many potential T2R
genes. Furthermore, we have also updated some previously incomplete results. Therefore, we believe that we
have identified a nearly complete T2R gene repertoire for
each species. For example, Shi et al. [16] found 12 intact
genes and 7 partial genes using the low-coverage of the
cow genome (3 × coverage), whereas we identified 18
intact cow T2R genes. The discrepancy between the two
results could be because we used different versions of the
genome sequence or be due to the different T2R data-mining criteria used in the two studies. Fischer et al. [25]

reported the T2R repertoire of the rhesus macaque using
molecular cloning methods and identified 22 intact T2R
genes and the fraction of pseudogenes was about 15%. In
our results, 26 intact T2R genes were identified and the
fraction of pseudogenes was about 29% in the rhesus
macaque, which is close to the estimate for humans. The
horse and cow are both herbivorous animals, and we
identified 19 intact T2R genes in the horse. The fractions
of pseudogenes in the cow and horse are much higher
than those in other vertebrates (Table 1). Go has previously suggested that gene expansion occurred in the mammalian lineage [15], but we found only a small T2R gene
repertoire (four intact genes) in the platypus. The genome
sequence of a lizard (Anolis carolinensis), a common reptile
found in the southeastern United States, has recently
become available and a total of 49 T2R genes were identified, including 37 intact genes, 2 partial genes and 10
pseudogenes. Both the frog and the lizard have a large
number of intact T2R genes. The DNA sequences of all
T2R genes from 16 vertebrates are shown in Additional
file 1.
Phylogenetic analysis
To investigate the evolutionary relationships among
intact T2R genes, we constructed a neighbor-joining tree
[26] for 307 amino acid sequences of intact genes identified from 16 vertebrates (Fig. 1). We did not use the partial
T2R genes and pseudogenes because most of them were
much shorter than intact genes. The results suggested a
major divergence between the intact T2R genes of teleost
fishes and tetrapods. The T2R genes in tetrapod vertebrates form a monophyletic clade with high bootstrap
support (82%); the genes in this clade were classed as the
'tetrapod group' and other genes in teleost fishes as the

'fish group'. The genes in the tetrapod group can be further
manually divided into different phylogenetic families,
each of which contains more than five genes and is supported by a bootstrap value >70%. If some smaller families were nested within a larger family, we selected the
larger one and ignored the smaller families. Using this
approach, we identified ten gene families, most of which
had bootstrap values >90%, labeled A-J according to the
number of the genes in each family. As shown in Figure 1,
mammalian T2R genes can be subdivided into several
phylogenetic families that are distinct from the frog and
lizard lineage-specific families.
Most of the T2R genes are organized into clusters on specific chromosomes [10,11,16]. For example, T2R genes in
the mouse and rat are mainly located on chromosomes 6
and 4, respectively. To describe the relationship between
the genes in specific phylogenetic families and genomic
distributions, we compared chromosomal distributions
for each family containing more than two genes. Owing to
the lack of chromosome information in frogs and lizards
so far, we also compared their scaffold distributions. As
shown in Table 2, T2R genes belonging to the same family
are always located together on the same chromosome/
scaffolds which is in agreement with the expansion of T2R
gene families by tandem gene duplication.
It has been reported that the evolution of vertebrate T2R
genes is characterized by rapid turnover and species-specificity [10,15,16]. The phylogenetic tree showed that vertebrate T2R genes can be clearly divided into different,
divergent families. Shi et al. described lineage-specific
gene duplications in teleost fishes, frogs and mammals
[16]. As shown in Figure 1, lizard T2R genes form two sep-

arate lizard-specific families with high bootstrap support
(99%), perhaps indicating that multiple recent gene
duplications occurred in lizards. It is also known that
there are lineage-specific gene expansions in mammals.
One might wonder about the mechanisms underpinning
the form of birth-and-death evolution, especially in mammals, and we describe a scenario for the evolution of T2R
genes.
Evolutionary changes in the number of T2R genes
The number of T2R genes is variable among different species. This variability indicates that some lineages have
gained additional functional genes through gene duplication or that these genes have been lost from specific lineages. To understand the evolutionary changes in the
number of T2R genes, we estimated the gains and losses of
the T2R genes in a diverse range of vertebrates using the
reconciled-tree method [22-24]. The resulting phylogenetic tree (Figure 1) shows lineage-specific families in teleost fishes, frogs, lizards and mammals, indicating that
the T2R genes underwent independent gene expansions.
The divergence time among these vertebrate species is so
long (>450 million years ago [MYA]) that it is difficult to
accurately estimate the number of ancestral genes with a
deep divergence based on the parsimony principle. In this
study, we therefore mainly focused on mammals.

First, we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree of all T2R genes
in mammals and used mouse VR genes as outgroups [27].
The species tree was constructed according to the mammalian phylogeny principle reported by Murphy et al.
[28] and Glazko et al. [29] and we then estimated the
number of T2R genes in common ancestors. It is difficult

to verify the real phylogenetic relationships of genes with
low bootstrap values, so we generated a condensed tree
with 50% bootstrap values. Figure 2 shows the estimated
number of T2R genes in the common ancestors of mammals. In general, the principle of parsimony uses the simplest hypothesis, so the numbers of ancestral genes may
be underestimated. Therefore, it is necessary to compare
our results with those of previous studies that used different methods. The estimated number of genes in the common ancestor of placental mammals and marsupials in
our study (~15 genes) is similar to that estimated in a previous study (16–17 genes) [15] that used the linearizedtree method. Therefore, we believe that, despite some limitations, our results broadly reflect the trends in gains and
losses of T2R genes in mammals.
Our results showed that lineage-specific gene expansions
and contractions are common in the branches leading to
different mammal lineages. Figure 2 shows evolutionary
changes in the number of T2R genes in mammals. We can
clearly identify two extensive gene expansion events that
occurred at two distinct times in evolution (branch a and
branch b in Figure 2). The first occurred after the divergence of monotremes and placentals/marsupials, and the
number of T2R genes increased almost five-fold in the
mammalian lineages. The other gene expansion occurred
in the branch of the common ancestor of all mammals
including placentals, which is consistent with the observation previously been reported by Go [15]. We found that
the common ancestor of placental mammals had one of
the largest number of T2R genes. Furthermore, there was
a lineage-specific expansion in the opossum lineage,
which might be important for a taxon-specific sense of bit-

Evolutionary changes in the number of T2R genes in mammals

obtained from Murphy et al. [28] and Glazko et al. [29]. The numbers to the right of each black dot indicate the numbers of

ter taste. Primates and rodents are often omnivorous, but
their functional T2R genes also underwent markedly different evolutionary changes, indicating many births and
deaths of genes.
Moreover, multiple T2R gene losses have previously been
reported to have occurred in the cow, horse and dog, all of
which are of the superorder Laurasiatheria [28] ; however,
there was no evidence for gene gains in the dog lineage.
The phylogenetic relationships among Cetartiodactyla,
Perissodactyla and Carnivora remain unclear [30], but we
postulate that Cetartiodactyla and Perissodactyla are sister
groups, as suggested by Waddell et al. [31] and conducted
the same analysis (see Additional file 2); indeed, in a similar analysis, we identified a similar number of gene gains
and losses. In this analysis, we also identified gene contractions in the dog, cow and horse.
Extensive independent gene expansions occurred in teleost fishes, frogs and lizards, which might indicate marked
differences in the bitter taste sensitivities of these species.
We also performed the same analysis of all 16 vertebrate

T2R gene repertoires (see Additional file 3) using a conventional vertebrate phylogeny approach [32]. The results
showed slight changes in the number of T2R genes in the
evolution of teleost fishes and massive gene expansions in
the frog and lizard. However, we did not find gene contractions in the chicken.

Discussion
In the present study, we identified and updated T2R gene
repertoires from a wide range of vertebrate taxa. Among
these taxa, T2R genes in the rhesus macaque, horse, platypus, lizard and stickleback were reported for the first time
based on currently available genome sequences. Datamining methods based on high-coverage genome
sequences are considered as a reliable method to detect
T2R gene repertoires, and most previous studies have
identified nearly complete gene repertoires. Furthermore,
to avoid missing potential T2R genes, we also validated
each of the Blast-hit sequences and identified partial T2R
genes. Therefore, our methods should have provided
almost complete coverage of T2R gene repertoires,

although some genome sequences may still be incomplete.
To better understand the evolutionary dynamics of vertebrate T2R genes, we also performed an evolutionary analysis of the T2R gene repertoires from 16 vertebrates. The
results indicated that there are frequent changes in the
number of genes and there have been extensive gains and
losses of T2R genes during vertebrate evolution. It should
be mentioned that the number of genes in common
ancestors is likely to be underestimated using the reconciled-tree method. Our estimated number of genes in the
common ancestor of placentals and marsupials is similar
to that reported by Go [15], which indicates that our
results provide a reliable estimate of the gains and losses
of T2R genes in mammals.
It has long been assumed that bitter taste evolved as a
defense mechanism to detect potentially harmful toxins
in food. Functional studies have shown that T2R proteins
respond to bitter tastants and bitter taste reception is
likely to associate with dietary selection [1,33]. Speciesspecific T2Rs might be required for animals to detect distinct bitter substances. For example, teleost fishes have
only a small number of T2R genes, which show a low level
of sequence similarity with those of tetrapods; in addition, the frog and lizard contain no mammalian-like gene
family members and their T2R likely evolved in a lineagespecific manner. The platypus has one of the smallest T2R
repertoires in mammals, which might be due to the semiaquatic survival environment and diet (such as underwater crustaceans) where it seldom tastes bitter compondes
[34]. It has often been assumed that any food that tastes
bitter should be toxic. Glendinning and co-workers [2]
have reported that bitter substances are unequally distributed in animal foods, and that plants contain more bitter
constituents. Therefore, herbivorous and omnivorous
mammals would be expected to need a greater level of bitter taste rejection compared with carnivores, which is in
agreement with our results that the dog has the smallest
T2R gene repertoire size among placental mammals. In
addition, we also identified the T2R genes in the cat from
its low-coverage genome sequence [35] (three intact
genes, four partial genes and four pseudogenes, data not
shown), which supports the hypothesis that T2R genes are
less diverse in carnivores.
Surprisingly, our results show that the cow and horse have
a larger fraction of pseudogenes compared with primates
and rodents. It is possible that T2R genes lost functionality
due to artificial selection or genetic drift during the
domestication of cows and horses, resulting in extensive
pseudogenization. So, vertebrate T2R gene repertoire size
might be greatest in herbivorous taxa, with reduced numbers found in omnivorous, carnivorous and aquatic ani-

mals, respectively; however, this is speculative and needs
further analysis. It would be interesting to examine the
sense of bitter taste in more animals with a wide range of
feeding habits.
As environments change, the feeding behavior of animals
will also evolve [1]. Therefore, animals need to adapt their
T2R to foods found in markedly changeable circumstances, possibly resulting in extensive birth-and-death
evolution of T2R genes. In addition to the marked gene
divergence among teleost fishes, frog, lizard and mammals, massive gene expansions and contractions were
observed in the evolution of several mammal lineages.
The T2R gene repertoires in teleost fishes seem to have
diverged substantially from those of tetrapods, which
indicated that there were few T2R genes before the separation of teleost fish and tetrapods. Regarding genetic
changes during bird evolution, we obtained quite different results from those previously reported by Go [15]. Go
concluded that the chicken lost T2R genes during evolution, whereas we identified no marked changes in the lineage leading to the chicken. Indeed, our results question
whether birds lost T2R genes after their divergence from
reptiles (~250 MYA) [36]. To answer this question, analysis of more bird T2R gene repertoires is needed.

Conclusion
Investigation of the T2R gene repertoires in vertebrates has
revealed extensive birth-and-death evolution in this study.
One caveat of this analysis in vertebrates is that there are
few representative amphibian, reptile and bird lineages,
so the number of genes in the common ancestors of these
species might be underestimated. In the future, analyses
of additional species would be helpful to describe the
dynamic evolution of T2R genes. Nevertheless, our results
provide a new perspective on the relationships among
T2R gene repertoires and different survival circumstances,
and help explain how bitter taste reception has evolved.

T2R gene identification
We identified T2R genes from each vertebrate species
using the following methods. We first collected previously
published T2R gene sequences from human, mouse, dog,
opossum, chicken, frog and zebrafish genomes as query
sequences. Next, we conducted a TBLASTN [41] search
using the E-value 1e-10 against each genome sequence.
There were so many TBLASTN query results that hit the
same genomic region that we extracted non-overlapping
sequences, each of which showed the lowest E-value
among the hits to a given region. Functional, intact T2R
genes were identified from these blast-hit sequences using
the following approach. First, we collected the blast-hits
that were >100 amino acids long. Then, each of the blasthit sequences was extended in both 3' and 5' directions
along the genome sequences. Obtained sequences were
confirmed by BLASTP searches against the NCBI databases
to ensure that genuine T2R genes were identified. Finally,
the coding sequences with proper ATG and the stop
codon were extracted (the average functional T2R gene
was ~300 amino acids long). Sequences that contained
interrupting stop codons or frameshifts were regarded as
pseudogenes and the remaining sequences containing
either initiation codons or stop codons were considered
partial T2R genes.
Phylogenetic analysis
The translated amino-acid sequences were aligned using
the program FFT-NS-I nested in Mafft version 5 [42]. The
phylogenetic T2R gene tree (Figure 1) was constructed
using MEGA3 software [43] and the Neighbor-Joining
[26] method with the protein JTT matrix model, and was
evaluated by 500 bootstrap replications.
The reconciled-tree method
The processes of gene gains and losses can result in incongruence between the topologies of gene trees and species
trees. An alternative approach is to investigate the relationship between gene trees and species trees using reconciled trees, which can show the history of the genes by
comparing the species tree with the gene tree using the
parsimony principle. The resulting reconciled tree is a
map of a gene tree and a given species tree, with any
incongruence between the two trees being explained by

predicted gene gains and losses [44]. The evolutionary
changes in the numbers of the T2R gene in tetrapod animals were estimated using the method of Niimura et al
[23] and the program was kindly provided by them. The
predicted number of T2R genes in the most recent common ancestor would be minimal, but this method can
also provide a good estimate of the evolutionary dynamic
changes in T2R genes (see above).
