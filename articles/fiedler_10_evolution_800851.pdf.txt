The evolution of euhermaphroditism in caridean
shrimps: a molecular perspective of sexual
systems and systematics

Abstract
Background: The hippolytid genus Lysmata is characterized by simultaneous hermaphroditism, a very rare sexual
system among Decapoda. Specialized cleaning behavior is reported in a few pair-living species; these life history
traits vary within the genus. Unfortunately, the systematics of Lysmata and the Hippolytidae itself are in contention,
making it difficult to examine these taxa for trends in life history traits. A phylogeny of Lysmata and related taxa is
needed, to clarify their evolutionary relationships and the origin of their unique sexual pattern. In this study, we
present a molecular phylogenetic analysis among species of Lysmata, related genera, and several putative
hippolytids. The analysis is based upon DNA sequences of two genes, 16S mtDNA and nuclear 28S rRNA.
Phylogenetic trees were estimated using Bayesian Inference, Maximum Likelihood, and Maximum Parsimony.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis of 29 species of Lysmata, eight genera of Hippolytidae and two genera of
Barbouriidae based on a single (16S, 28S) and combined gene approach (16S+28S) indicates that three groups of
Lysmata differentiate according to antennular morphology: (1) Lysmata, having a multi-segmented accessory
branch, (2) Hippolysmata (prior to Chace 1972), with a one-segmented accessory branch, and (3) a third group of
Lysmata outliers, with one-segmented unguiform accessory branch, and close affinity to the genera Exhippolysmata
and Lysmatella. The monophyly of the clade bearing a multi-segmented accessory branch is robust. Within the
short accessory branch clade, species with specialized cleaning behaviors form a monophyletic clade, however, the
integrity of the clade was sensitive to alignment criteria. Other hippolytid and barbouriid genera used in the
analysis are basal to these three groups, including one displaying simultaneous hermaphroditism (Parhippolyte). The
two barbouriid species occur in a separate clade, but among hippolytid taxa.
Conclusions: The data support the historical morphological division of Lysmata into clades based on accessory
branch morphology. The position of the “cleaner” shrimps, indicates that specialized cleaning behavior is a derived
trait. The topologies of the cladograms support the monophyly of the barbouriids, but do not support their
elevation to familial status. Taxa ancestral to the genus Lysmata display simultaneous hermaphroditism, suggesting
that this life history trait evolved outside the genus Lysmata.

Background
The hippolytid shrimp genus, Lysmata (Risso, 1816), has
attracted the attention of biologists for several decades.
Members of this genus are small caridean shrimp and
occur in tropical to warm temperate marine coastal waters
worldwide. They are popular marine aquarium pets, with
some species engaging in cleaning behavior of fishes. One

species (L. seticaudata) was used as a model organism
for ground breaking studies on sexual differentiation in
Crustacea [1-3], with the mistaken impression that this
species underwent male-to-female sex change, or protandric hermaphroditism (PH). For many years, PH was
thought to be the only form of hermaphroditism in the
decapod crustacea, albeit uncommon. This perception
changed in the last decade with the discovery that the
reproductive system of two Lysmata species was a form of
simultaneous hermaphroditism, or euhermaphroditism
[4,5]. This system has been confirmed in every Lysmata

species examined (e.g. L. amboinensis [5], L. wurdemanni
[4], L. nilita [6], L. seticaudata [6], L. californica [7],
L. bahia [8], L. intermedia [8], L. rafa [9] and L. holthuisi
[10]). Among confirmed euhermaphroditic Lysmata
species, all individuals pass through a functional male
phase early in life [4-7]. This is the impetus of the term
“protandric simultaneous hermaphroditism” or “PSH” (e.g.
[11]) to describe the system. The early male phase also
contributed to the mistaken impression that Lysmata
species were protandric hermaphrodites [1-3].
Bauer [12,13] postulated that the evolution of PSH in
Lysmata was related to social systems and/or behavioral
characteristics among members of the genus. He divided
Lysmata into two informal, non-taxonomic ecological
groupings: 1) low density, pair living, specialized “cleaner
shrimps”, with bright and contrasting coloration, including
yellow and red colors and long white antenna, and famous
for their ability to actively “clean” fish (e.g. L. amboinensis,
L. grabhami, L. debelius, and L. splendida); 2) high density,
group living, “peppermint shrimps”, with color patterns
consisting of semi-translucent bodies with longitudinal
and lateral red bands (e.g. L. wurdemanni, L. californica,
and L. seticaudata). Bauer [12,13] hypothesized that PSH
must have evolved from a paired, cleaning ancestor species
living at low densities with few opportunities to find mates
and further suggested that group-living species diverged
once or multiple times from these paired species. However, this explanation was made without phylogenetic
inference for the genus Lysmata and its socioethological
patterns. Furthermore, there are indications that PSH may
have evolved outside the genus. Recent studies have
shown that PSH occurs in the hippolytid genera Exhippolysmata Stebbing, 1916 [14,15], Lysmatella Borradaile,
1915 (Rhyne unpub.), and one barbouriid genus (previously a hippolytid) Parhippolyte Borradaile, 1899 (Onaga
& Fiedler, unpub.). The presence of PSH within these few
taxa suggests an opportunity to examine the evolution of
this unique system via a molecular phylogenetic approach.
Unfortunately, the systematics of both genus Lysmata
and the family Hippolytidae are still unsettled. Recent
revisions in the caridean genus Lysmata have increased
the number of species to nearly 40, an expansion of 33%
over the last 10 years, and this has not abated [9,10,16,17].
Members of the genus Lysmata were originally split into
two genera: Hippolysmata Stimpson, 1860 and Lysmata.
These two genera were previously differentiated by the
presence of a multi-segmented accessory antennal branch
in Lysmata species, and the lack thereof in Hippolysmata
species (see [18] for an example). Chace [19] placed
Hippolysmata in synonymy of Lysmata, based upon a
perceived wide intraspecific variation in the accessory
branch morphology. However, Chace may have failed to
properly delineate several species based on this character,
which directly led to his misinterpretation (c.f. [20]).

Page 2 of 14

Furthermore, both generic names were in use two decades
later by Holthuis [18].
The family Hippolytidae has also been under recent
scrutiny. Christoffersen [21] concluded that the Hippolytidae are a polyphyletic group, based upon a detailed
manual cladistic analysis of morphological characters. He
went so far as to rearrange member genera between the
superfamilies Alpheoidea Rafinesque, 1815 and Crangonoidea Haworth, 1825. He placed the genus Lysmata
with the closely related Lysmatella and Exhippolysmata
in its own family, the Lysmatidae Dana, 1852. Chace [22]
did not agree with Christoffersen’s rearrangement of taxa
into new superfamilies. He performed a non-cladistic
analysis of the 40 genera originally assigned to the
Hippolytidae, examining 107 separate characters [22]. He
concluded that the family was “reasonably homogenous”,
but agreed with Christoffersen’s [21] suggestion to move
the genera Barbouria Rathbun, 1912, Janicea Manning
and Hart, 1984, and Parhippolyte from the Hippolytidae
to a new family, Barbouriidae Christoffersen, 1987.
Martin and Davis [23] recognized some of the inconsistencies detailed by Christoffersen [21], and use Barbouriidae in their classification of recent Crustacea. However,
they kept the Barbouriidae within the superfamily
Alpheoidea, because of similarities to hippolytids.
Furthermore, Martin and Davis [23] kept the rest of the
hippolytids intact, not recognizing any of Christoffersen’s
[21] other new families. More recently, in a phylogenetic
analysis of the Infraorder Caridea based on 16S and 18S
sequence data, the genus Lysmata formed a distinct
clade, well separated from the other hippolytids [24],
supporting Christoffersen’s view of a paraphyletic Hippolytidae. Hence, the accepted phylogeny of the Hippolytidae and related taxa is as yet unresolved.
In this paper, we present a phylogeny of 29 Lysmata
species and eight genera of related hippolytids and two
barbouriids, based upon sequences from both mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal gene sequences. Our use of
two genes from independently evolving genomes, a thorough taxonomic coverage of the Lysmata and related
genera, and a robust analysis in terms of alignment strategies improves upon a very recent preliminary phylogeny of the genus Lysmata [25]. We demonstrate that
PSH evolved outside the genus Lysmata, as it is present
in at least one ancestral taxon. Our phylogenetic analyses
support the past division of Lysmata and Hippolysmata
species based on the morphology of the antennular
accessory flagellum, and the need for revision of both
past and present Hippolytidae.

Accessory antennal branch types are indicated for Lysmata and closely allied taxa. Numbers of specimens (#) sharing the same sequence are indicated after the
Genbank Accession Number. Accession numbers in bold face type represent new sequences. (*) denotes new putative species. (†)We use L. cf. acicula, as
L. acicula (Rathbun) is the prior synonym used for Hawaii L. ternatensis. Body coloration and our 16S data and indicate that Hawaii L. ternatensis differs from
L. ternatensis from Okinawa, Japan. The assignment of species to families is based on [64] and the assignment of sexual systems is based on [65] or where
sufficient information is present. Hermaphroditism types: PH = protandric, PPH = partial protandric, PSH = protandric simultaneous, blank cells = no information
or gonochoristic.

when discussing phylogenetic relationships we refer to
the historical Hippolysmata/Lysmata taxonomic nomenclature (prior to [19]) based on the presence or absence
of a multi-segmented accessory branch on the dorsolateral flagellum of the antennule. We differentiate Lysmata
as ornamented with a short, one-segmented accessory
branch, a long multi-segmented accessory branch, or
unguiform accessory branch (newly described here).
Most of the Indo-Pacific specimens were collected by the
first author in Hawaii, Japan, and other Pacific locations;
the majority of West Atlantic specimens were provided
by AR. Other specimens were kindly provided by individuals from a variety of locations, including Indonesia, the
Mediterranean, and Brazil. Many specimens were photographed prior to fixation, as color information is critical
in the ultimate determination of species identity [16].
Species identities were determined using published
descriptions (e.g. [16]), the most recent morphological
keys (e.g. [16,22]), and descriptions of several new species
[26] Specimens or portions of specimens were fixed in
80-100% ethanol by their respective sources. A small
number of specimens were frozen for mitochondrial
separation procedures (see below). Where possible, we
included replicate specimens for each species, including

confirmed specimens from different geographical regions.
For example, Lysmata wurdemanni was sampled from
two locations in Florida and one location in Texas.
We have also included representatives of the hippolytid genera Alope, Exhippolysmata, Heptacarpus,
Tozeuma, and Thor, as well as two barbouriids (Barbouria, Parhippolyte) to explore their phylogenetic
relationship with Lysmata. The snapping shrimp Synalpheus brevicarpus from the closely related Alpheidae
[24] was selected as the designated outgroup (Table 1).
The final data sets consist of a combination of our
novel sequences with published sequences obtained
from GenBank. The sources of the GenBank sequences
are recent papers by Porter et al. [27], Baeza et al.
[25], and Rhyne et al. [28]. Samples including taxonomic authority, location, and GenBank accession
numbers are given in Table 1.
Molecular Methods

DNA was isolated from individual specimens using one
(or more) of three techniques, dependent upon sample
condition, fixation method, and laboratory location.
Total DNA extractions from EtOH-fixed specimens
were performed in one of two ways: a) using the

Fiedler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:297
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/297

PureGene DNA isolation kit (Gentra) for fixed-tissue or
b) via SDS & phenol/chloroform extraction [29,30].
When available, frozen samples were also subjected to
preferential mtDNA extraction using the alkaline lysis
procedure [31]. This procedure was used because of
concerns that mtDNA sequences (i.e., 16S) were confounded by the presence of putative mitochondrial pseudogenes (numt) in several species [32,33].
The 16S region was amplified with the 1471-1472 primers [34]. The 28S region was amplified with “28S01” 5’GACTACCCCCTGAATTTAAGCAT-3’ and “28SP19F”
5’-GAGATTACCCGCCTAATTTAAGCAT-3’ as forward primers paired with the reverse primer “28SR-02”
5’-CTCCTTGGTCCGTGTTTC-3’. PCR conditions were
optimized for each gene-species combination via gradient
PCR procedures. PCR products were assessed via electrophoresis of 2.5-5 μl of amplicon on a 0.7-1% agarose gel.
Amplified bands were visualized under UV light and
stored digitally. PCR products were cleaned of excess
dNTPs, primers, and other impurities with one of two
methods: a) enzymatic treatment with EXOSAP or b)
silica gel extraction and wash [35]. All successful PCR
products were processed for sequencing using the Big
Dye 3.1 Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit and the ethanol precipitate products were loaded into either an ABI
3130xl 16-capillary Genetic Analyzer or an ABI 377
DNA sequencer. DNA products were sequenced from
both directions. Sequence traces were viewed and processed with Phrap/Phred/Consed software [36-38] or
4Peaks software [39] and the chromatographs were
cross-checked during contig building. Identical sequences
were collapsed in MacClade [40] and represented as one
taxon in the analysis. We reconstructed phylogenies
based on both the 16S and 28S data sets separately, and
combined. Preliminary analysis of the 28S region in
several species showed that there was either no variation
or very little variation among closely related species, so
representative species of each of the 3 main clades of the
16S tree were chosen for sequencing. DNA sequences
were aligned in ClustalX [41] using the default parameters. The resulting alignments of 16S and 28S consisted of conserved and highly variable regions. Some of
highly variable regions could not be aligned unequivocally and those regions were removed by Gblocks v 0.91b
[42]. The Gblocks parameters for the 16S and 28S data
sets were: minimum number of sequences for a conserved position (11/32), minimum number of sequences
for a flanking position (11/32), maximum number of contiguous non-conserved positions (8/8), minimum length
of a block (5/5), and allowed gap positions (with half/
with half). We explored further the robustness of the
phylogenetic signal of the datasets against a) the alignment deriving after highly variable regions were removed
with even more stringent criteria by Gblocks and b) the

Page 6 of 14

alignment deriving from the default settings in ClustalX.
All alignments are available as supplementary data (Additional File 1: Table S1).
We analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of the
sequences by using MCMC-based Bayesian inference
(BI) as implemented in MrBayes v. 3.2 [43] and maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) in
PAUP* [44]. Data specific models of nucleotide evolution were evaluated with ModelTest [45] by the AIC criterion. In the BI of the combined data set (16S+28 S),
each data partition was assigned a different model of
substitution. The conditions for the Bayesian analysis
were: three million generations, four simultaneous independent runs, and tree sampling every 1000th generation. For the Bayesian analysis of the concatenated data,
different nucleotide substitution models were applied to
each data partition. Graphs of ln(L) against number of
generations were inspected to determine the burn-in
factor. A consensus tree was calculated after discarding
the first 10% trees as burn-in, which ensured that nonoptimal trees were not included. Searches for the MP
tree(s) run using the full heuristic option with 10 random replicates and for ML trees the fast stepwise addition option was used. The robustness of each clade was
assessed with 100 replicates for ML and 1000 for MP of
the non-parametric bootstrap procedure [46]. For each
bootstrap replicate, in MP a heuristic search was performed with 10 random taxon addition sequences and
TBR branch swapping and in ML, a heuristic search was
performed with the stepwise-addition option and TBR
branch swapping. The Bayesian trees are presented and
important topological discrepancies among the three
phylogenetic methods are discussed. Posterior probabilities (pP) and bootstrap support (bp) values are used to
indicate clade support.

Results
We obtained 16S sequences from more than 100 specimens belonging to 29 species of Lysmata (27 named, 2
new), in addition to 16 species belonging to 8 other hippolytid genera and two genera of Barbouriidae, from all
over the world (Table 1). In addition, we obtained partial sequences of the 28S ribosomal gene from 11 species of Lysmata and 9 species (eight genera) of other
hippolytids and barbouriids (Table 1). The TrN + I + Γ
and the GTR + Γ models of substitution were selected
as the appropriate models for the 16S and 28S data sets,
respectively.
Phylogenetic analyses of 16S (Figure 1), 28S (Figure 2)
and the concatenated data sets (16S+28 S; Figure 3) overall
supported the historical division of the Lysmata based
on antennular accessory branch morphology. The short
accessory branch group includes L. bahia, L. ankeri,
L. pederseni, L. bogessi, L. rafa, L. wurdemanni,

have been removed by GBlocks using less stringent criteria. Clade support values are shown along the corresponding branches (Bayesian
Inference/Maximum Likelihood). Colored lines indicate Lysmata species. The orange clade represents those with a one-segmented (short)
accessory branch, the red clade represents those with a multisegmented (long) accessory branch and the green clade represents those with a
one-segmented unguiform (unguiform) branch.

L. gracilorostris, L. nayaritensis, L. amboinensis, L. grabhami, L. debelius, L. californica, and L. olavoi (Figure 1, pP
= 63). The low clade values (pP < 50) supporting the basal
position of L. olavoi with respect to species possessing a
short accessory branch reflect the uncertainty of its placement in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1). The Lysmata
group ornamented with a long accessory branch consists
of L. galapagensis, L. moorei, L. nilita, L. intermedia,
L. seticaudata, L ternatensis, L. trisetacea, L. acicula and
was recovered as a highly supported monophyletic group
(Figure 1, pP = 100). The three species (Lysmata hochi,
L. cf. anchisteus, and L. lipkei) that are ornamented with
an unguiform branch are recovered outside Lysmata and
clustered with Exhippolysmata and Lysmatella (Figure 1),
but this topological arrangement is not consistent with all
alignment strategies.
The analyses also support a behavioral split within the
short accessory branch clade - the so-called “cleaner” vs.
“peppermint” shrimps. The specialized cleaner shrimps
are defined as species with white antennae and legs, and
bright body coloration, where peppermint shrimps lack

white antennae and legs, and bright body coloration
[47]. The “peppermint” shrimps, which are represented
in the 16S tree by L. wurdemanni, L. boggessi, L. pederseni, L. ankeri, L. rafa, L. bahia, L. gracilirostris,
L. nayaritensis are differentiated from the “cleaners”
L. debelius, L. amboinensis and L. grabhami as separate
clades (pP = 88 and pP = 71, respectively). The placement of L. californica, which is considered a peppermint
shrimp, is contingent to the alignment strategy of the
16S data. Different alignments placed this species ancestral to cleaners or ancestral to non-cleaners (Additional
File 2: Figure S1) or nested within the cleaner clade, sister taxon to L. debelius (Figure 1). The phylogenetic
divisions between short and long accessory branch
clades and between behavioral groups within the short
accessory branch clade are supported mainly by BI and
not by the ML or the MP method.
The clade including Exhippolysmata oplophoroides,
Lysmatella prima, and the three unguiform Lysmata is
positioned outside of Lysmata (short and long accessory
branch) but the placement is either weakly supported

branches (Bayesian Inference/Maximum Likelihood). Asterisks indicate 100% clade support for both phylogenetic methods. Colored lines indicate

(pP = 62; Figure 1), or in different positions in alternative alignments (Additional File 2: Figure S1). This
group of species, along with Parhippolyte mistica, Barbouria cubensis, and Merguia Kemp 1914, are basal to
all Lysmata, except those ornamented with an unguiform accessory branch (Figure 1). Finally, the 16S topology indicates two pairs of sister taxa, the genera
Hippolyte with Tozeuma Stimpson, 1860, and Heptacarpus Holmes, 1900 with Thor Kingsley, 1878.
The resulting phylogeny from the 28S data alone (Figure 2) displays a general topology similar to that observed
from the 16S (Figure 1) and the concatenated 16S+28S
data set (Figure 3). The same major clades are apparent
among the Lysmata, Lysmatella, and Exhippolysmata
taxa. The only exception is the relative ancestral/derived
positions of these clades, which are not resolved. This
loss of resolution may simply be due to the relatively
more conserved 28S region. The concatenated data

strongly support the behavioral division within the
shrimps possessing a short accessory branch: cleaners
(pP = 100, bp = 87) vs. peppermint shrimps (pP and bp =
100). These data also support the historical division
(prior to [19]) between Lysmata (pP = 100, bp = 99) and
Hippolysmata (pP = 100, bp = 96), though neither L californica, L. olavoi or L. nayaritensis) are included. Lysmata cf. anchisteus and Lysmata lipkei are clustered
outside Lysmata and Hippolysmata forming a clade with
Exhippolysmata and Lysmatella, an association observed
in the 16S analysis. Similar to the 16S tree, Merguia, Parhippolyte, and Barbouria are basal to Lysmata.

Discussion
I. Lysmata taxonomy & phylogeny
A. Historical division between Lysmata &Hippolysmata

Our data generally support the historical division of
Lysmata based on accessory flagellum morphology. It

Fiedler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:297
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/297

also partly supports Rhyne’s [48] further division of
Lysmata according to morphology and/or color pattern: (1) Lysmata, having a long accessory branch, (2)
Hippolysmata (prior to [19]), having a short accessory
branch and displaying typical peppermint color patterns, and (3) cleaner shrimps, within Hippolysmata,
with a short accessory branch and displaying bright
coloration with white antenna. However, support for
these groupings is contingent upon analysis method
and alignment strategy (Figure 1, Additional File 2:
Figure S1). Specifically, the positions of three peppermint shrimp species are problematic. The inconsistent
placement of L. californica and L. nayaritensis challenges the monophyly of the peppermint shrimps.
Furthermore, the support for the monophyly of the
species with short accessory branch is weakened by the
variable topological position of L. olavoi. Regardless,
the discovery of a putative third group with unguiform
branch (see below), renders the genus Lysmata paraphyletic. The BI recovers the different groups more
consistently than both ML and MP, especially in the
combined dataset (Figure 3). However the absence of
L. californica, L. nayaritensis and L. olavoi from the
combined data set weakens the comparison between
the 16S and the 16S/28S trees. For comparison, the
Baeza et al. [25] analysis recovers Exhippolysmata and
L. hochi within the clade with the short accessory
branch. Another problematic taxon is L. olavoi which
is placed (pP = 63) in a basal position in the group
with short accessory branch (Figure 1). Unlike L. californica, there is no behavioral data for L. olavoi, which
has only been collected with traps from >125 m depth
in Azores [49]. Lysmata olavoi is placed ancestrally to
all other Lysmata in [25]. Any interpretation of the
current results and those of Baeza et al. [25] should be
made cautiously, as the evolutionary nature of the
ribosomal datasets (i.e. excessive indel events) may
limit the phylogenetic information they can convey.
The “cleaners” (L. amboinensis, L. debelius, and
L. grabhami) may form a monophyletic group [25],
except for the inclusion of L. californica within the cleaner clade. The placement of L. californica is unresolved,
because it is strongly influenced by the alignment strategy. Lysmata californica has “peppermint shrimp” characteristics, lacking white legs and antenna, having
translucent body with red stripes and living in groups.
The monophyly of the remaining peppermint shrimps
(i.e., L. wurdemanni, L. rafa, L. boggessi, L. pederseni,
L. ankeri, L. bahia, L. gracilirostris, L. nayaritensis) was
strongly supported (pP = 88; Figure 1). In contrast, the
support for a monophyletic clade with species bearing a
long accessory branch was very robust (pP = 100) and
insensitive to the alignment conditions and the dataset
used.

Page 10 of 14

The topologies based on ribosomal data are also sensitive to the inclusion of particular taxa. By including Lysmatella prima in the analysis, L. hochi is no longer the
sister taxon of Exhippolysmata, as indicated in [25].
Rather, Lysmatella is the “new” sister taxon, whereas
L. hochi is consistently grouped with L. anchisteus
(Figure 1). There are arguments supporting that a denser phylogenetic sampling of taxa will generally improve
the phylogenetic accuracy [50,51], but others highlight
the importance of longer sequences rather than denser
taxon sampling [52]. However, the addition of more
sequence data without concomitantly increasing the
sampled taxa can lead to strong systematic biases, producing highly supported, but incorrect or misleading
topologies [53]. Without a doubt, more species and
more genes will be added in the future and should better resolve the systematic inconsistencies of Lysmata
and related genera. Besides the potential problem of
limited taxa and gene sampling, the tree topology may
be more influenced by the final alignment itself than by
the phylogenetic reconstruction method [54,55]. There
are several possible ways to resolve the problem of
alignment uncertainty: 1) explore the effect of different
alignment strategies, 2) removal of uncertain regions
and/or 3) include protein coding genes where homologous alignment may be more objective by using the
more conserved amino acid sequences. The alignment
uncertainty of ribosomal data sets caused by the excessive indel events of the Lysmata phylogeny will be ameliorated when nuclear protein-coding genes are included
in the analysis.
B. A possible third clade of Lysmata

Three Lysmata species (L. anchisteus, L. hochi, L. lipkei)
are robustly placed outside the Lysmata + Hippolysmata
clade in the 16S phylogeny. Similarly, the 16S/28S concatenated phylogeny places L. cf. anchisteus and L. lipkei in
the same clade with Lysmatella and Exhippolysmata outside of their traditional taxonomic boundaries (Figure 3);
this grouping suggests that an additional clade might be
formed by species with a highly reduced antennular accessory branch. Lysmata anchisteus, L. hochi, and L. lipkei
possess a vestigial antennal flagella, at most one segment
in length with an unguiform shape [[19,20,26,49], respectively]. The position of these three species suggests they
are basal to the other clades of Lysmata. Data from
morphologically similar species (e.g. L. uncicornis and
L. kuekenthali) may help clarify the occurrence of this
clade. These “outlier” Lysmata also present a challenge to
any revision of the nomenclature of the genus. If one proposes to resurrect Hippolysmata and Lysmata to their previous status based upon phylogenetic data, the outliers
could not be placed into either genus. A new genus may
have to be erected, once their relationship with Exhippolysmata and Lysmatella is clarified. Alernatively, the

Fiedler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:297
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/297

presence of Exhippolysmata and Lysmatella in the putative third clade of Lysmata, may indicate that the generic
definitions of these two genera based on raised basal crest
(Exhippolysmata) and lack of epipods (Lysmatella) may be
insufficient to raise these species to the genus level. Unlike
the Lysmata species of the third clade that are ornamented
with an unguiform antennal flagella, Exhippolysmata and
Lysmatella have a short blunt flagella.
C. Exhippolysmata &Lysmatella

One of the surprising findings in [25] is the position of
the genus Exhippolysmata within Lysmata, rendering
the genus Lysmata paraphyletic. We have shown that
the position of Exhippolysmata depends on the alignment strategy for 16S and the taxon sampling. Additionally, single gene approaches of closely related species
should be interpreted cautiously as they often represent
the phylogeny of the genes [56-58] or the organelles
[59] and not the “true” organismal phylogeny. It is
obvious that more genes and additional taxon sampling
are needed to resolve the phylogenetic issues of Lysmata
and other closely related genera. When the morphology
of the two genera is taken in to consideration (raised
basal crest in Exhippolysmata; lack of epipods on the
first four pereiopods in Lysmatella) it seems highly
improbable that species with vastly different morphological characters would be nested within a clade of Lysmata. Even though we present a phylogeny based on a
denser taxon sampling and an additional gene from the
independently evolved nuclear genome, our approach is
still limited. We have proceeded by concatenating the
two gene sequences prior to the phylogenetic analysis
(i.e. total evidence approach), because it has been
demonstrated empirically that concatenation of multiple
genes often results in a single well-supported topology
[60]. Theoretical work, however, has shown that especially when the coalescent process is highly variable
from gene-to-gene [61], concatenation of data sets can
produce inconsistent phylogenetic estimates [62].
II. Hermaphroditism & Life History Patterns

Our data do not support any relationship between
cleaning symbiosis or social system and the origin of
PSH or the genus itself. Results from our phylogenetic
analyses suggest that fish cleaning is a derived behavior
within the short accessory branch clade. Lysmata californica, a peppermint shrimp that commonly associates
with moray eels is placed within the clade that includes
species living in pairs and bright coloration indicating
strong specialized behavior (Figure 1). For comparison,
L. californica is basal to the cleaner clade in the study of
Baeza et al. [25]. The different placement of this taxon is
an alignment artifact as both studies used different
alignment criteria. There is also evidence of moray eel
interactions with species bearing long accessory branch

Page 11 of 14

[63]. Since well-developed cleaning behavior evolved
once within Lysmata, there seems to be no obvious connection of the so-called “paired cleaning species” with
the origin of PSH; PSH is ubiquitous within Lysmata
and likely evolved ancestrally to the genus. Furthermore,
most of the Lysmata species examined would be classified as group living species, including taxa basal to the
“paired cleaner” clade. The assumption that group size
= mating system in nature should be substantiated with
supporting observations of behavior under natural
conditions.
PSH has been recently been reported in Exhippolysmata [15], Lysmatella prima (Rhyne, unpublished) and
Parhippolyte (Onaga & Fiedler, unpub.), a genus placed
ancestrally to Lysmata, regardless of the alignment strategy. Clearly, studies attempting to determine the origins
of PSH must focus on related genera that are ancestral
to Lysmata, a point that has been highlighted also in
[25]. Christoffersen [21] subdivided the hippolytids into
superfamily and families based on morphological comparisons. The placement of Parhippolyte and Lysmata in
different families (Barbouriidae and Lysmatidae, respectively) would further support that PSH evolved well outside of Lysmata and could be far more common than
previously considered. The cave dwelling, group-living
shrimp genus Parhippolyte possesses PSH and all phylogenetic analyses support the ancestral position of this
group relative to all Lysmata and Exhippolysmata.
When Bauer [12,13,47] postulated the evolution of PSH
within Lysmata and why there are two distinct ecological clades, he was unaware that PSH is secondary to the
divisions within the genera. The evolution of PSH likely
predates the diversification of Lysmata and may have little or no bearing on the evolution of different ecological
groups within the genus. For Lysmata, the question is
not how PSH is related to socio-ecological systems, but
rather why pair living and specialized fish cleaning behavior evolved from a group living ancestor.
III. Phylogenetic issues in the Hippolytidae and related
taxa

Based on cladistic analysis, Christoffersen [21] split the
hippolytid genera into several different families. Notably,
Lysmata, Calliasmata Holthuis 1973, Exhippolysmata,
and Mimocaris Vereshchaka 1997 were assigned to the
family Lysmatidae, while Barbouria, Parhippolyte,
among other genera were assigned to the Barbouriidae.
These two families were included with the Processidae
Ortmann, 1890 and Crangonidae, and the genera Merguia and Glyphocrangon Milne-Edwards 1881, in the
superfamily Crangonoidea. The rest of the hippolytids
are assigned by Christoffersen to various families within
the superfamily Alpheoidea. Chace [22] rejected this
wholesale rearrangement, though agreed with the

Fiedler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:297
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/297

erection of the Barbouriidae. This assertion was reaffirmed by Martin and Davis [23]. We consistently
recover the branch of Barbouria + Parhippolyte in all
trees, therefore we cannot reject Christoffersen’s suggestion for separating the Barbouriidae. However, it is not
clear whether or not the level of differentiation from
Lysmata, Exhippolysmata, Lysmatella, and Merguia is
sufficient to propose a separate family. Although the
relative placement of Merguia and the two barbouriids
is susceptible to alignment strategies, they are clearly
more closely related to Lysmata than the other hippolytid genera in our phylogenies. The ancestral relationship
of Merguia to Lysmata and its basal position to the barbouriids could invalidate the Crangonoidea sensu Christoffersen. A denser sampling of taxa from
Christoffersen’s proposed groups may help to clarify the
level of differentiation present among these taxa and
others that have traditionally been a part of the Hippolytidae. Until more convincing conclusions can be drawn,
the current delineations proposed by Martin and Davis
[23] should be maintained.

Conclusions
Our mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal data generally
support the historic morphological division of Lysmata
based on accessory branch morphology. Shrimps within
the short accessory branch clade differentiate according
to behavior and color pattern. The monophyly of the
Lysmata group which is bearing a multi-segmented
accessory branch is strongly supported, underlying the
taxonomic importance of this character. Lysmata with
an unguiform accessory branch are part of a third clade
which includes Lysmatella and Exhippolysmata. The
third clade does not conform to the historic division
between Lysmata and Hippolysmata. PSH is ubiquitous
within Lysmata and occurs in Barbouriidae, suggesting
that this rare reproductive system that evolved ancestrally to the genera Lysmata, Exhippolysmata and Lysmatella. The two representative species of barbouriids
form a monophyletic group and are consistently placed
within the Hyppolytidae, therefore not providing support for the family Barbouriidae. The ribosomal data
provides a unique view of the phylogeny of Lysmata and
life history traits, however, the position of some taxa is
sensitive to alignment strategies.
