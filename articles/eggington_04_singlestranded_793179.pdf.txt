Abstract
Background: Deinococcus radiodurans R1 is one of the most radiation-resistant organisms known
and is able to repair an unusually large amount of DNA damage without induced mutation. Singlestranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein is an essential protein in all organisms and is involved in DNA
replication, recombination and repair. The published genomic sequence from Deinococcus
radiodurans includes a putative single-stranded DNA-binding protein gene (ssb; DR0100) requiring
a translational frameshift for synthesis of a complete SSB protein. The apparently tripartite gene
has inspired considerable speculation in the literature about potentially novel frameshifting or RNA
editing mechanisms. Immediately upstream of the ssb gene is another gene (DR0099) given an ssblike annotation, but left unexplored.
Results: A segment of the Deinococcus radiodurans strain R1 genome encompassing the ssb gene
has been re-sequenced, and two errors involving omitted guanine nucleotides have been
documented. The corrected sequence incorporates both of the open reading frames designated
DR0099 and DR0100 into one contiguous ssb open reading frame (ORF). The corrected gene
requires no translational frameshifts and contains two predicted oligonucleotide/oligosaccharidebinding (OB) folds. The protein has been purified and its sequence is closely related to the Thermus
thermophilus and Thermus aquaticus SSB proteins. Like the Thermus SSB proteins, the SSBDr functions
as a homodimer. The Deinococcus radiodurans SSB homodimer stimulates Deinococcus radiodurans
RecA protein and Escherichia coli RecA protein-promoted DNA three-strand exchange reactions
with at least the same efficiency as the Escherichia coli SSB homotetramer.
Conclusions: The correct Deinococcus radiodurans ssb gene is a contiguous open reading frame
that codes for the largest bacterial SSB monomer identified to date. The Deinococcus radiodurans
SSB protein includes two OB folds per monomer and functions as a homodimer. The Deinococcus
radiodurans SSB protein efficiently stimulates Deinococcus radiodurans RecA and also Escherichia coli
RecA protein-promoted DNA strand exchange reactions. The identification and purification of
Deinococcus radiodurans SSB protein not only allows for greater understanding of the SSB protein
family but provides an essential yet previously missing player in the current efforts to understand
the extraordinary DNA repair capacity of Deinococcus radiodurans.

Background
Deinococcus radiodurans R1, a tetrad-forming gram positive
soil bacterium, is among the most radiation resistant
organisms known [1]. The D37 γ irradiation dose, (the
dose at which an irradiated population of cells is reduced
to 37%) for D. radiodurans is approximately 6,000 Gy.
This dose is 200 times that required to reduce Escherichia
coli survival to the same extent [1]. A 6,000 Gy dose of
radiation introduces approximately 300 DNA double
strand breaks, greater than 3,000 single strand breaks, and
more than 1,000 sites of base damage per D. radiodurans
haploid genome ([1] and references therein). D. radiodurans is also able to sustain growth without induced
mutation in the presence of considerable levels of ambient radiation (6 krads/h) [2]. Presumably, this organism
possesses a robust DNA damage repair system. Singlestranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) is an essential protein in all known organisms and is required for DNA replication, recombination and repair [3].
The genome of D. radiodurans consists of 2 chromosomes,
a megaplasmid, and a plasmid. Each of these genomic elements is present at 4–10 copies per cell [4]. The genome
has been sequenced [4]. In this sequence, the SSB protein
appeared to be encoded by a tripartite ssb gene, requiring
two translational frameshifts or some other mechanism to
allow expression of a full length functional SSB protein
[2,4-6]. The apparent need for frameshifting in this gene
has led to considerable speculation about both the presence of novel frameshifting or RNA editing mechanisms
in D. radiodurans and their possible roles in normal
metabolism [2,4-6]. There has even been some uncertainty as to whether D. radiodurans possesses a functional
ssb gene. We now report that the ssb sequences as originally published (genes DR0099 and DR0100) include
two errors that render the gene interpretation opaque. The
correct sequence reveals a longer and completely contiguous ORF for ssb, encoding an SSB protein closely related to
the recently characterized Thermus thermophilus and Thermus aquaticus SSB proteins [7]. The D. radiodurans SSB protein has been over-expressed and purified, and like the
Thermus SSB proteins, has been shown to form a
homodimer in solution. The D. radiodurans SSB
homodimer stimulates both the D. radiodurans RecA protein and E. coli RecA protein-promoted DNA three-strand
exchange reactions at a level comparable to or greater than
the stimulation of these reactions by the E. coli SSB
homotetramer.

Results and Discussion
The D. radiodurans ssb gene encodes a contiguous ORF
The region encompassing the ssb gene, which is flanked by
DR0098, the ribosomal protein S6 gene and DR0101, the
ribosomal protein S18 gene, was PCR amplified from
genomic DNA and sequenced (Fig. 1). The genomic DNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/2

was derived from the Deinococcus radiodurans R1 type
strain obtained directly from the ATCC (ATCC 13939).
The ssb gene was also independently cloned into two different cloning vectors and re-sequenced. In each case, the
sequence revealed two additional guanine nucleotides
that are not present in the sequence deposited in the database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (Fig. 1) [4]. (The original submitted sequence
has accession #AE000513. The current sequence has
accession #NC_001263 and is identical to the original).
With the corrections reported here, a contiguous ORF that
encodes a complete ssb protein is revealed. A recognizable
D. radiodurans ribosomal binding site (AAGGAG) exists at
an optimal 8 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon
(Fig. 1) [8-10]. The corrected ssb sequence has been deposited with GenBank, accession number AY293617. The
predicted D. radiodurans SSB protein is the largest bacterial
SSB polypeptide identified to date (301 amino acids,
including the initiating methionine), exceeding in length
the T. thermophilus VK1 SSB by 35 amino acid residues.
The presence of a contiguous open reading frame encompassing the regions designated DR0099 and DR0100 was
confirmed by PCR amplification of this region from
genomic DNA, and cloning it into an E. coli expression
vector. Excellent inducible expression of a protein of the
predicted size was obtained from the pEAW328 vector
(see Methods) (Fig. 2). This protein was purified and confirmed to be D. radiodurans SSB protein by N-terminal
sequencing of the first nine amino acids (ARGMNHVYL).
As expected, the N-terminal methionine residue was
absent in the D. radiodurans SSB protein purified from E.
coli. The calculated molecular weight of the purified D.
radiodurans SSB protein monomer (300 amino acids without the initiating methionine) is 32,591. We estimate that
the D. radiodurans SSB protein purified as described here
is more than 99% homogeneous. Additionally, the purified D. radiodurans SSB protein was free of detectable DNA
endo- and exonucleases.
D. radiodurans SSB protein is closely related to the T.
thermophilus and T. aquaticus SSB proteins
The protein sequence predicted for D. radiodurans SSB
protein shares 43% identity and 58% similarity with the
T. thermophilus HB-8 SSB protein, 43% identity and 58%
similarity with the T. thermophilus VK-1 SSB protein and
44% identity and 61% similarity with the T. aquaticus YT1 SSB protein (Fig 3A and 3B). The N-terminal segment of
the D. radiodurans SSB protein shares 38% identity and
49% similarity with the E. coli SSB protein. The C-terminal
segment of the D. radiodurans SSB protein shares 39%
identity and 64% similarity with the E. coli SSB protein.

Virtually all bacterial SSB proteins identified to date contain only one oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding

(OB) fold per monomer and function as homotetramers
[11,12]. The very recently characterized T. thermophilus
and T. aquaticus SSB proteins have broken that pattern,
and contain 2 OB folds per monomer [7,11] and function
as homodimers [7]. In the formation of homodimers, T.
thermophilus and T. aquaticus SSB proteins maintain the
bacterial trend of 4 OB folds per SSB protein oligomer.
The D. radiodurans SSB protein gene structure is quite sim-

ilar to that of the T. thermophilus and T. aquaticus ssb gene
structures and is predicted to contain two OB folds. The
high similarity of the D. radiodurans SSB protein sequence
to the Thermus SSB proteins (Fig 3) suggested that the D.
radiodurans SSB protein would also form a homodimer.
This prediction was confirmed (see below). The structure
of the D. radiodurans SSB protein is consistent with and
reinforces the close phylogenetic relationship between

protein 2 and purification of the D. radiodurans R1 SSB
Expression
Expression and purification of the D. radiodurans R1
SSB protein. Protein expression was obtained from the
pEAW328 vector in BL21 Codon Plus (DE3) (Stratagene) E.
coli cells. Proteins were examined on a standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Lanes are (1) molecular weight markers (BioRad, Low Range), as noted with the labels at left; (2) Whole
cell extract of uninduced cells; (3) whole cell extract of cells
after induction of the D. radiodurans ssb gene; (4) purified D.

Deinococcus and bacteria of the Thermus group of extremophiles [2,4-6].
D. radiodurans SSB protein forms a homodimer
Native molecular weight approximation by gel filtration
analysis (Fig 4) and sedimentation equilibrium experiments confirmed our prediction that D. radiodurans SSB
protein exists as a homodimer. In the gel filtration analysis, D. radiodurans SSB protein displayed a fractional retention (Kav) on a Sephacryl S-200 column of 0.21. E. coli SSB
protein, ran for comparison, displayed a Kav of 0.18. Using

a standard molecular weight curve generated for the column, these values correspond to 85 kDa and 101 kDa
respectively. The native molecular weight approximation
for D. radiodurans SSB protein is 2.6 times the molecular
weight of a D. radiodurans SSB monomer (32.6 kDa), or
1.3 times that predicted for a D. radiodurans SSB
homodimer (65 kDa). The native molecular weight
approximation for E. coli SSB protein under these conditions is 5.4 times that of the molecular weight of an E. coli
SSB monomer (18.8 kDa), or 1.3 times that of an E. coli
SSB homotetramer (75 kDa). E. coli SSB protein is known
to form a homotetramer in solution [13,14]. Given the
aberrant chromatographic behavior of the native E. coli
SSB homotetramer, the apparently similar behavior of the
native D. radiodurans SSB is most consistent with a
homodimer. Due to the high sequence identity and similarity of the OB folds between E. coli SSB protein and D.
radiodurans SSB protein, we anticipate that the proteins
will have similar properties. In the experiment of Fig. 4,
both proteins chromatograph with an apparent mass corresponding to 1.3 times that of their calculated molecular
weight, assuming the D. radiodurans SSB is a homodimer
and the E. coli SSB is a homotetramer.
The sedimentation equilibrium data were best described
as a single species. There was no evidence for multiple species and modeling attempts using associations or simple
mixtures did not yield physically realistic parameters for
some fitting variables. The results of global fitting of the
all data at absorbance less than 2 gave a molecular weight
of 63,300 ± 70, in excellent agreement with the value of
65,183 for a dimer based on the sequence. In fact an
increase in the calculated partial specific volume of only
0.008 would yield perfect agreement.
Since sedimentation equilibrium shows the protein to be
a homogeneous population of dimers, the results from
column chromatography would suggest that the shape of
the molecule deviates from that of the globular standards.
The C-terminus of SSB has special functional significance.
Although the length and the sequence of the C-terminal
regions (the region extending past the OB fold(s)) is variable across bacterial species, the last 10 amino acids at the
C-terminus are highly acidic and well conserved across
bacterial species [3]. An acidic C-terminus is also seen in
the D. radiodurans SSB protein C-terminal tail (Fig 3).
Studies of E. coli SSB C-terminal truncation mutants have
indicated that the last 10 amino acids of E. coli SSB protein
is essential for cell survival and is probably involved in
protein-protein interactions [15]. This may be of functional significance to the D. radiodurans SSB. As a
homodimer, SSBDr contains 4 OB folds, similar to the E.
coli SSB homotetramer. However, the same D. radiodurans

ally weakens the binding of E. coli SSB homotetramer to
nucleic acids [15]. The authors of this study conclude that
the amino acid sequence contained between the OB fold
and the highly acidic 10 amino acid tail acts purely as a
spacer to shield the negative charges of the C-terminus
from the bound DNA on the SSB protein [15]. In support
of this idea, a crystal structure of E. coli SSB protein, in the
absence of DNA, suggests that the C-terminal region (the
region not involved in the OB fold) protrudes from the
tetramer and that each of the four C-terminal regions take
on different conformations [16].
We speculate that the acidic terminus of the D. radiodurans
SSB protein is also important for in vivo protein-protein
interactions, but that there may be some interesting functional differences reflecting the reduced number of C-terminal regions in the D. radiodurans SSB oligomer
compared to that of E. coli and other bacterial SSB oligomers. Further studies involving the D. radiodurans SSB C-terminus will help to further understand the role of the
spacer and acidic tail regions of bacterial SSB proteins.

Molecular weight approximation of the D. radiodurans SSB protein oligomer. Gel filtration of the standards and SSB proteins were performed as described in the
Methods section using a S-200 Sephacryl HR column. The
protein standards β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic
anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa) were used
to calibrate the column as shown by open circles. The elution
volume of blue dextran was used to calculate the void volume and the total volume of the column was known. The
best-fit line was generated of the log Mr of the protein standards versus Kav of the standards. D. radiodurans SSB protein
and E. coli SSB protein samples were injected onto the column in independent experiments and their elution volumes
were used to calculate their Kav. The position of D. radiodurans SSB protein on the standard curve is indicated by a
closed square and the position of E. coli SSB protein on the
standard curve is indicated by an open square.

SSB homodimer contains only two C-terminal regions
whereas the E. coli SSB homotetramer contains four.
In vitro analyses of the E. coli SSB protein showed that the
C-terminal third of the protein is not needed for tetramer
formation or DNA binding and that the last 10 amino

A D. radiodurans SSB protein homodimer facilitates RecA
promoted DNA three-strand exchange
Single-stranded DNA binding proteins, in general, help
stimulate recombinase promoted in vitro DNA strand
exchange reactions. The E. coli system has been most
intensely studied and E. coli SSB protein has been shown
to have both pre-synaptic and post-synaptic roles in E. coli
RecA protein-promoted DNA strand exchange reactions
[17,18]. The addition of E. coli SSB during the presynaptic
formation of RecA filaments helps to remove ssDNA secondary structure, allowing formation of contiguous RecA
filaments [17]. Post-synaptically, E. coli SSB facilitates the
recombination reaction by binding the displaced ssDNA
and preventing the reversal of the strand exchange reaction [18].

The SSB proteins from different organisms have frequently been interchanged and found to stimulate the
reactions of recombinases from other organisms [19-21].
These observations suggest that there is little species-specific protein-protein interaction. The E. coli SSB protein
greatly stimulates the D. radiodurans RecA protein-promoted DNA strand exchange reaction [22], and in fact an
SSB protein is required to observe significant reaction. We
have now found that the D. radiodurans SSB protein stimulates the DNA strand exchange reactions promoted by
both RecADr and the E. coli RecAEc (Fig. 5). In the reactions
promoted by both D. radiodurans RecA protein (Fig 5 Panels A, B and C) and the E. coli RecA protein (Figure 5 Panel
D), less than half as much D. radiodurans SSB protein was
needed to generate a yield of nicked circular product equal
to that seen in the reactions with E. coli SSB under the
same conditions. The reduced requirement for the D.

radiodurans SSB is again consistent with the formation of
a D. radiodurans SSB homodimer (Fig 5). Since the D. radiodurans SSB forms a homodimer (with 4 total OB folds)
and E. coli SSB forms a homotetramer (with 4 total OB
folds), the concentration of SSBDr should be multiplied by
a factor of 2 to provide an SSBDr-SSBEc comparison that
reflects equal numbers of OB folds (see dashed line in Fig.
5, panels C and D).
Note that the maximum product generation is slightly different for the D. radiodurans and E. coli RecA protein-promoted reactions. The optimal conditions are slightly
different for the two recombinases, and the conditions
used in these reactions were those optimal for the E. coli
RecA protein.

Conclusions
We conclude that frameshifting does not occur within the
D. radiodurans ssb gene. The gene consists of a contiguous
open reading frame encompassing the regions now
labeled DR0099 and DR0100. The predicted amino acid
sequence of the D. radiodurans SSB protein is closely
related to the SSB proteins from T. aquaticus and T. thermophilus. The purified D. radiodurans SSB protein, like the
SSB proteins from T. aquaticus and T. thermophilus [7],
forms a homodimer. The D. radiodurans SSB homodimer
stimulates D. radiodurans RecA and also E. coli RecA protein-promoted DNA strand exchange reactions with at
least the same efficiency as the E. coli SSB homotetramer
stimulates these reactions. Elucidation of the complete D.
radiodurans ssb gene and purification of the D. radiodurans
SSB protein opens the way for further studies of the DNA
metabolism of this unusually DNA repair-proficient
organism.

Methods
Strain
The Deinococcus radiodurans R1 type strain was obtained
directly from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC 13939).
Genomic DNA isolation
Genomic DNA was purified from Deinococcus radiodurans
R1 type strain cells using the following protocol. TGY
media (5% tryptone, 3% yeast extract, 1% glucose) was
used in a 5 mL overnight 30°C culture growth. The cells
were pelleted and resuspended in 2 mL suspension buffer
(10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM Na-EDTA, 0.35 M
sucrose). Lysozyme (2 mg) was added and the suspension
was incubated for 4 hours at 37°C. Lysis buffer (3 ml; 100
mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.3 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, and
2% (w/v) SDS, with 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol added
just before use) was added to lyse the cells. The suspension was extracted with equal volumes of TE saturated
phenol once, then once with 25:24:1 phenol/chloroform/

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/2

isoamyl alcohol and then once with 24:1 chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. The non-aqueous layer was removed, and
the DNA was ethanol precipitated. The dry DNA pellet
was dissolved in 200 µl TE, and 1 µl was used in subsequent PCR amplifications.
Sequencing approaches
The sequence of the ssb gene was checked in three independent analyses using different PCR primers and
sequencing primers. In a direct approach, primers starting
in the flanking DR0098 ribosomal protein S6 gene (5'
CATCAAGGCTTCGGGCAAC 3') and the DR0101 ribosomal protein S18 gene (5' TTGCGTTCGCCGCTGTTTCC
3') were used to PCR amplify the ssb gene and flanking
regions. Sequencing primers were used to directly
sequence this PCR fragment with a 2–4-fold coverage. In
addition to this direct approach, the ssb gene was independently PCR amplified and inserted into two separate
plasmids, pRAD1 (obtained as a gift from Mary E. Lidstrom) [9] and pET21A (Novagen) and sequenced from
these plasmids. The first clone, with the ssb gene inserted
between the XhoI and HindIII cloning sites of vector
pRAD1, used the PCR forward primer containing the XhoI
site (underlined) (5' CTACCGCTCGAGAGTGGAAGACCAAGAAGGCCTGAGC 3') and the reverse primer containing
the
HindIII
site
(5'
TATGAAGCTTTTAGTGGTGGTGGTGATGATGGCCACCAAAGGGCAGGTCG 3'). The forward primer for the
pRAD1 insertion PCR was designed to anneal in the
upstream flanking ribosomal protein S6 gene while the
reverse primer was designed to anneal at the end of the ssb
gene and included a C-terminal histidine tag sequence.
The ssb gene was sequenced in this clone with a two-fold
coverage. This clone was not used for any further experimentation contained within this report. A second, independently created clone called pEAW328, with the ssb
gene inserted between the EcoRI and the NdeI cloning sites
of pET21A, used the PCR forward primer containing the
NdeI site (5' CGTATTCCATATGGCCCGTGGCATGAACCAC 3') and the reverse primer containing the EcoRI site
(5' CGGAATTCTTAAAAGGGCAGGTCGTC 3'). The forward primer for the pET21A insertion PCR was designed
to anneal at the initiating codon of the correct ssb gene
and contained a CGT codon (italicized) rather than the
natural CGA codon for Arg in order to replace a low use
Arg codon (the third amino acid in the primary sequence)
with a higher use Arg codon in preparation for overexpression. The reverse primer for the pET21 insertion PCR was
designed to anneal at the natural termination codon of
the correct ssb gene. No tag sequence was used in the
pET21A vector construction. Three separate pET21A
insertion clones were sequenced twice. All restriction
enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs.

DNA strand exchange reactions promoted by D. radiodurans RecA and E. coli RecA with SSB titrations
Figure 5
DNA strand exchange reactions promoted by D. radiodurans RecA and E. coli RecA with SSB titrations. Reactions were carried out as described in the Methods section. Circular single-stranded DNA (css) was preincubated with either
D. radiodurans or E. coli RecA. ATP and SSB protein (either D. radiodurans or E. coli SSB protein as indicated) were then added
and incubated, followed by the addition of homologous linear double-stranded DNA (lds) which initiated the DNA threestrand exchange reaction. The nicked circular double-stranded DNA product (nc) is distinguishable by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantifiable. Panels A and B show the agarose gel electrophoresis results of reactions promoted by D. radiodurans
RecA with various monomer concentrations of D. radiodurans SSB protein and E. coli SSB protein, respectively. These results
are quantitated in panel C, with the data from reactions with D. radiodurans SSB (closed circles) and E. coli SSB (closed triangles)
coming from Panels A and B respectively. Panel D shows the quantitated results of similar reactions promoted by E. coli RecA
with D. radiodurans SSB (closed circle) and E. coli SSB (closed triangle) (agarose gel not shown). Since an SSBDr monomer has
two OB folds and an SSBEc monomer has only one, the improved reactions seen in the reactions containing the former protein
could simply reflect the higher effective concentration of OB folds when monomeric SSB concentrations are compared. In panels C and D, the dashed lines represent a plot in which the percentage reaction product generated in the reactions using SSBDr
are plotted against the actual concentration of OB folds in these reactions (twice the actual concentration of D. radiodurans SSB
monomers). The dashed lines (--X--) thus allow a direct comparison of the reactions observed with the D. radiodurans SSB protein with the reactions observed with the E. coli SSB protein (closed triangles). The production of nicked circular doublestranded DNA product is calculated as a percentage of total duplex DNA (the sum of linear double-stranded DNA substrate,
nicked circular double-stranded DNA product and any network products near the well).

Protein sequence analysis
Standard BLAST pair wise analysis (Blosum62 matrix at
default settings) of the protein sequences was used to calculate percent identity and similarity values between
proteins. ClustalX was used to generate the multiple
sequence alignments.
Expression and purification of D. radiodurans SSB Protein
As described above, the D. radiodurans ssb gene PCR product was inserted into the EcoRI and the NdeI cloning sites
of pET21A (Novagen) to yield construct pEAW328. The
ssb gene in this construct did not contain a histidine tag or
any modification that would lead to a translation product
that would differ from that encoded by the chromosomal
D. radiodurans ssb gene. Construct pEAW328 was transformed into BL21 Codon Plus (DE3) (Stratagene) E. coli
cells. These cells were grown in LB broth in the presence
of 100 µg/ml of ampicillin and 25 µg/ml of chloramphenicol at 35°C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.8. The
cells were then induced with 0.4 mM IPTG and grown at
35°C for three more hours before harvest. Harvested cells
were resuspended in Buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3,
12% w/v glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA) with the buffer addition
corresponding to five times the cell volume. Lysozyme
was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. Cells
were stirred at 4°C for 1 hour and then sonicated on ice.
All subsequent purification steps were performed at 4°C.
Cell debris and insoluble material were removed by 3 successive 20 min centrifugations at 38,000 g with insoluble
material being removed between centrifugations. Solid
NaCl was then dissolved in the supernatant to a concentration of 0.18 M NaCl. DNA and proteins were precipitated by drop-by-drop addition of 10% (w/v)
polyethylenimine, pH 7.5, with constant stirring to a final
concentration of 0.4% (w/v) polyethylenimine. The solution was stirred for 15–60 minutes and then centrifuged
for 15 min at 10,000 g. The SSB protein remained in the
pellet at this point and was eluted from the pellet with
Buffer B (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.4 M NaCl, 12% w/v
glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol) in a
volume equal to the volume initially used to resuspend
the cells. The polyethylenimine pellet was broken up and
resuspended using a plastic spatula and then a glass
homogenizer or small mortar and pestle. This suspension
was stirred for 30 min and then centrifuged for 15 min at
10,000 g. The SSB was found in the supernatant. Solid
Ammonium Sulfate was slowly added to the supernatant
while stirring over the course of 30 minutes to a 30% saturation of the solution. This solution was allowed to continue stirring for approximately 3 hours and the
precipitated proteins, including much of the SSB, were
collected by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 20 min. The
Ammonium Sulfate pellet was dissolved in TGE Buffer (50
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 20% w/v glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1
mM β-mercaptoethanol) with gentle stirring at a volume

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/2

~65% of the initial volume used to resuspend the cells.
The resuspended solution was centrifuged for 20 min at
30,000 g to remove non-dissolved proteins. The supernatant was dialyzed against TGE Buffer. Following dialysis,
the solution was cleared of precipitate by a 5 min centrifugation at 3,800 g and the supernatant was dialyzed
against P (20 mM) buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate,
pH 7.5, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol). Again the solution was cleared by centrifugation following dialysis. A hydroxyapatite column (BioRad) was pre-equilibrated with P (20 mM). EDTA was not
used in buffers applied to the column other than the
EDTA contained in the load volume. The hydroxyapatite
bed volume used and found adequate was 110% of the
initial volume used to resuspend the cells. The dialyzed
protein was loaded on the column and eluted over a 10
column volume linear gradient going from Buffer P (20
mM) to Buffer P (152 mM, i.e. 152 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol). The SSB completed elution approximately half way
through the linear gradient. Fractions containing mostly
SSB and some very minor degradation bands by SDSPAGE were pooled and dialyzed against TGE Buffer. The
dialyzed protein was then loaded onto a DEAE Sepharose
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (bed volume of
110% of the initial volume used to resuspend the cells was
found adequate) and eluted in a 10 column volume linear
gradient of TGE Buffer going from 0.0 M NaCl to 0.3 M
NaCl. Degraded protein eluted before the pure SSB protein eluted. Elution was complete at about half way
through the gradient. Fractions containing pure SSB protein were pooled and dialyzed into storage buffer (20 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.5 M NaCl, 50% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mM
EDTA, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol), aliquotted, snap frozen
in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C.
The extinction coefficient for the D. radiodurans SSB protein was determined as described previously [23,24].
Eleven determinations at three different concentrations of
D. radiodurans SSB protein gave an average extinction
coefficient of ε280 = (4.1 ± 0.2) × 104 M-1cm-1. The N-terminal sequence analysis was performed by the Protein
and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratories, Department of
Molecular Biology and Pharmacology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Mo., without the laboratory personnel knowing the identity of the protein.
Native Molecular Weight Determination by Gel Filtration
The native molecular weight of D. radiodurans SSB was
approximated by gel filtration FPLC. A Sephacryl S-200
HR column (31.4 cm × 1.0 cm) was used at a flow rate of
0.05 ml/min. The buffer in all experiments was 50 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, as recommended by
Sigma for the protein standards. Chromatography was
performed at 4°C while A280 was measured. The column

was calibrated using Sigma Gel Filtration Molecular
Weight Markers: blue dextran (2,000 kDa), beta-amylase
(200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine
serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa),
and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). The standards were loaded
independently at the concentrations recommended by
Sigma in 100 µl sample volumes. Approximately 70 µg of
E. coli SSB protein (18.8 kDa per monomer) and 200 µg
of D. radiodurans SSB protein (32.6 kDa per monomer)
were independently loaded on the column in 100 µl
sample volumes. Standards and SSB loads were dissolved
or dialyzed respectively into the recommended buffer plus
5% (w/v) glycerol. The elution volume of blue dextran
determined the void volume (Vo), and the total volume
(Vt) was determined by volume measurements of the column before packing and measurement of the column tubing used. The peak elution volumes (Ve) were calculated
from the chromatogram and fractional retentions, Kav,
were calculated using the equation: Kav = (Ve - Vo)/(Vt - Vo).
A standard curve was determined by plotting the Kav of the
protein standards against the log10Mr of the standards. The
native molecular weight of D. radiodurans SSB protein was
approximated by comparing its Kav value to the standard
curve. The native molecular weight of E. coli SSB protein
was determined for comparison in like manner. E. coli SSB
protein was purified as previously described [25], and an
extinction coefficient of 2.38 × 104 M-1cm-1 was used to
calculate the concentration of E. coli SSB.
Sedimentation Equilibrium Measurements
To prepare samples for sedimentation equilibrium a 1 mL
D. radiodurans SSB 157 µM protein sample (in 35 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 25% w/v glycerol, 300 mM NaCl, 1
mM EDTA, 0.5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA
buffer) was dialyzed for 1 hour at 4°C against 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA dialysis buffer,
and then again against 2 L of fresh dialysis buffer overnight at 4°C. The protein concentration of the resulting
sample was 80.4 µM. The final dialysate was used to dilute
aliquots of this stock to concentrations of 4.67 µM, 12.4
µM and 20.4 µM.

100 µL of each sample was placed in 12 mm double-sector
charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces with about 105 µL of the
final dialysate as reference. Centrifugation was performed
at 4°C in a Beckman model XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. The protein gradients were recorded at 280 nm every
2–3 hours until they became superimposable. Data were
collected at six speeds (5200, 8200, 11000, 14000, 16500,
18500 rpm). With the various speeds and starting concentrations, absorbance in the gradients ranged from ~0 to
>2.8, which corresponds to ~0 to >60 µM protein. Baseline absorbances were measured for each sample after
high speed depletion and was less than 0.03 in all cases
and was subtracted prior to curvefittings. The partial spe-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/2

cific volume was calculated from the composition as
0.722 mL/gm. The dialysate density was measured as
1.007518 gm/mL at 4°C using an Anton Paar DMA5000
density meter.
The data from the three samples at six speeds were globally tested against models of a single species, two noninteracting species and two species in equilibrium.
Programs for analysis were written in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR) by Darrell R. McCaslin.
DNA Three-Strand Exchange Reactions
Enzymes and Reagents
The E. coli RecA and D. radiodurans RecA proteins were
purified by polyethylenimine precipitation followed by a
DEAE-Sepharose column and a hydroxyapatite column as
described [26]. Protein concentrations were determined
by absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficients
ε280 = 2.23 × 104 M-1 cm-1 for E. coli RecA [27], 1.41 × 104
M-1 cm-1 for D. radiodurans RecA [22] and 2.38 × 104 M1cm-1 for E. coli SSB [28]. E. coli SSB protein was purified
as previously described [25].
Preparation of DNA substrates
Duplex supercoiled DNA and circular ssDNA (css DNA)
substrates from bacteriophage M13mp7 (7238 bp) were
purified as described [29-31]. The linear dsDNA substrate
was prepared from M13mp7 supercoiled dsDNA, which
was cut with BsmBI and purified by electrophoresis on
1.0% agarose gel. The concentrations of ssDNA and
dsDNA solutions were determined by absorbance at 260
nm, using 36 and 50 µg ml-1 A260-1, respectively, as conversion factors. The concentrations of DNA and proteins
reported below are the final concentrations after addition
of all components and DNA concentrations are in terms
of total nucleotides.
DNA three-strand exchange reaction
The DNA three-strand exchange reactions were carried out
at 37°C in solutions containing 25 mM Tris-OAc (80%
H+, pH 7.5), 10 mM Mg(OAc)2 (Fisher Scientific), 1 mM
DTT (Research Organics), 3 mM Potassium Glutamate,
5% (w/v) glycerol and an ATP regeneration system (12
mM phosphocreatine and 10 units/ml phosphocreatine
kinase (Boehringer Mannheim)). Two µM RecA protein
(from E. coli or D. radiodurans) was pre-incubated with 6
µM css DNA in the reaction buffer and regeneration system for 10 min. ATP (3 mM) and SSB (indicated concentrations) were then added, followed by another 20 min
incubation. The reactions were initiated by addition of 10
µM lds DNA. The reactions were incubated for 2 hr and
stopped by the addition of 1.2 µl 10% SDS, 0.3 µl 0.5 M
EDTA and 0.6 µl 20 mg/ml Proteinase K followed by 30
min incubation. Aliquots mixed with 2.5 µl 6 × loading
buffer (15% Ficoll, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25%

xylene cyanole FF) were loaded on an 1% agarose gel and
electrophoresed at 25–35 V for 16 hr at room temperature. To visualize the DNA bands, the gels were stained
with ethidium bromide, and exposed to UV light. Gel
images were captured with a digital CCD camera utilizing
GelExpert software (Nucleotech). The intensity of DNA
bands was quantitated with the software package TotalLab
v1.10 from Phoretix.
