Abstract
Background: Bacillus subtilis glucokinase (GlcK) (GenBank NP_390365) is an ATP-dependent
kinase that phosphorylates glucose to glucose 6-phosphate. The GlcK protein has very low
sequence identity (13.7%) to the Escherichia coli glucokinase (Glk) (GenBank P46880) and some
other glucokinases (EC 2.7.1.2), yet glucose is merely its substrate. Our lab has previously isolated
and characterized the glcK gene.
Results: Microbial glucokinases can be grouped into two different lineages. One of the lineages
contains three conserved cysteine (C) residues in a CXCGX(2)GCXE motif. This motif is also
present in the B. subtilis GlcK. The GlcK protein occurs in both monomer and homodimer. Each
GlcK monomer has six cysteines. All cysteine residues have been mutated, one-by-one, into alanine
(A). The in vivo GlcK enzymatic activity was assayed by functional complementation in E. coli UE26
(ptsG ptsM glk). Mutation of the three motif-specific residues led to an inactive enzyme. The other
mutated forms retained, or in one case (GlcKC321A) even gained, activity. The fluorescence spectra
of the GlcKC321A showed a red shift and enhanced fluorescence intensity compare to the wild
type's.
Conclusions: Our results emphasize the necessity of cysteines within the CXCGX(2)GCXE motif
for GlcK activity. On the other hand, the C321A mutation led to higher GlcKC321A enzymatic
activity with respect to the wild type's, suggesting more adequate glucose phosphorylation.

Background
Glucose kinase/glucokinase (GlcK/Glk) (EC 2.7.1.2) is
one of the first enzymes encountered along the glycolytic
pathway. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the
ATP/ADP-dependent phosphorylation of the sixth carbon
position of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate. Unlike the
bacterial and archaeal glucokinases, the closest eukaryotic
glucokinase counterpart such as yeast hexokinase B and
human hexokinase IV (HK4 or GCK) (EC 2.7.1.1) are well

characterized. In fact, the protein structure of yeast hexokinase B (31% identical amino acid residues to human
HK4) was deciphered more than two decades ago [1].
Sites for the glucose formed hydrogen bond in human
HK4: T168, K169, N204, D205, N231, and E290 are conserved among eukaryotes [2-4]. However, these sites are
not found in microbial glucokinases. HK4 is able to phosphorylate not only glucose, but also mannose, fructose,
sorbitol, and glucosamine (for review, see reference [5]).

Microbial glucokinase has its own unique glucose-binding domain, which maybe conserved among glucokinases. The domain seems highly specific for glucose.
We have previously cloned and characterized the glcK
gene of Bacillus subtilis [6]. Replacement of ATP by ADP
revealed no detectable glucokinase activity, neither did
replacement of glucose by fructose, galactose, or mannose
[6]. The GlcK protein was characterized by Km values for
ATP and glucose of 0.77 mM and 0.24 mM, respectively
[6]. The ATP binding-motif D [ILV]G [GA] [T] conserved
for both GlcK and HK4 are located at the N-terminal [3].
The mechanism of Mg2+-ATP binding to GlcK has never
been directly observed but rather proposed by their
homology to the ATP-binding sites of HK4 [6]. Two recent
3-D protein structures of ADP-dependent glucokinases,
belonging to hyperthermophilic archaeon, Thermococcus
litoralis and Pyrococcus horikoshii, showed the Mg2+ motif
(NEXE) and the ADP/ATP-dependent kinases motif
([SD]TXG XGDX [IF]) [7,8]. Interestingly, the T. litoralis
and P. horikoshii glucokinases are similar to ATP-dependent kinases: E. coli ribokinase and human adenosine
kinase [7]. As a consequence, those archaeal glucose-binding sites are similar to the ribokinase, while the specific
glucose-binding sites for many bacterial glucokinases
remain elusive. It turns out that the archaeal glucokinases,
including the Aeropyrum pernix ATP dependent Glk,
showed broad specificity for hexoses, such as fructose,
mannose, glucosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, and Nmannosamine [9].
Glucokinases, which participate in carbon catabolite
repression [10-13], contain the so-called ROK (repressor,
ORF, kinase) [14,15]. Two alternative ROK motifs have
been suggested: [LIVM]X(2)G [LIVMFCT]GX [GA]
[LIVMFA]X(8)GX(3–5) [GATP]X(2)G [R KH] [14,15] and
CXCGX(2)GX [WILV]EX [YFVIN]X [STAG] [9,16]. Concha and Leon [16] further proposed cysteine (C) residues,
especially those within the ROK motif, to be essential for
the catalytic activity of glucokinase. These may also be
required for glucose binding.
Here we describe the unexpected finding that the phylogenetic analysis provided two clusters of microbial glucokinases sequences, which are also distinguished by the
presence or absence of the CXCGX(2)GCXE motif. Since
B. subtilis GlcK contains this motif, the role of C residues
within the motif as well as the remaining C residues was
examined.

Results
Glucose kinases/glucokinases (EC 2.7.1.2) comprise two
lineages with or without a conserved CXCGX(2)GCXE
motif
The 52 amino acid sequences that have been analyzed in
this study were used to understand the relationship and
the distinction between B. subtilis GlcK and other glucokinases. Multiple alignments of glucokinases showed a typical ATP binding site and ROK motif. However,
phylogenetic analysis demonstrated two lineages of glucokinases (Fig. 1). The first lineage includes B. subtlis GlcK,
which clustered with the 33 other glucokinases belonging
primarily to Gram-positive bacteria and archaea. The lineage is indicated by three conserved C residues in the
motif: CXCGX(2)GCXE (Fig. 2). In contrast, the second
lineage does not contain this motif. All the glucokinases
retain the conserved ATP binding motif. The well-characterized E. coli Glk (P46880) belongs to the second lineage
and it has very low sequence identity (13.7%) to B. subtilis
GlcK. Glucokinases in the second lineage generally have a
sequence identity lower than 15.9% to the B. subtilis GlcK.
Biochemical properties of glucokinases from both lineages are very similar but surprisingly the sequence identities among them are quite diverse. Therefore, it was
intriguing to identify the role of the amino acid sequences
that are uniquely conserved. Conserved C residues within
the CXCGX(2)GCXE motif were of particular interest and
maybe important for GlcK's enzymatic activity.
B. subtilis GlcK occurs in both monomeric and dimeric
forms
Purified B. subtilis GlcK enzyme in soluble fractions was
obtained after over-expression in E. coli RB791. The B. subtilis GlcK produced in E. coli was active as indicated by the
ability to phosphorylate glucose. Under the reducing condition, GlcK showed a monomeric band of 35-kDa (Fig.
3A no. 1), while a homodimeric band of 70-kDa appeared
under oxidative condition (Fig. 3B). Both forms were also
observed under denaturating (SDS-PAGE) electrophoresis
in the absence of reducing agent (Fig. 3A no. 2). This finding was supported by MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the
GlcK, which also demonstrated two peaks of 35.2 kDa
and 70.4 kDa, except for the protonated form (17.6 kDa)
(Fig. 3C).
The C175, C177, and C182 are essential for B. subtilis
GlcK enzymatic activity
Exploring the roles of specific amino acid residues is
essential to understanding the structure and function of a
protein. The B. subtilis GlcK consists of six C residues at
positions 166, 175, 177, 182, 282, and 321. Three-conserved C residues at positions 175, 177, and 182 were
detected as part of a distinctive amino acid sequence motif
in the first lineage but not the second one. In order to
understand the correlation of C residues with the protein's

structure–function relationship, we replaced C with an A
residue using site-directed mutagenesis. We then analyzed
their enzymatic activity in vivo by functional complementation in E. coli glk mutant UE26. E. coli UE26 (ptsG ptsM
glk) is unable to utilize glucose as carbon source and,
therefore, forms colourless colonies on glucose-containing MacConkey plates, while the wild type forms red colonies. Since E. coli UE26 cannot transport glucose via
phosphotransferase system, we supplemented the plates
with 50 mM glucose and 100 mM fucose. Fucose leads to
the induction of galactose permease, which can also transport glucose. This unphosphorylated glucose can then be
metabolized only if it is converted to glucose 6-phosphate
by glucokinase. Plasmids carrying the mutated B. subtilis
glcK genes were transformed into E. coli UE26 and cultivated on MacConkey agar plates supplemented with glucose and fucose. As a positive control, plasmid carrying
the wild type glcK was also transformed into E. coli UE26.
Negative controls were E. coli UE26 alone and E. coli UE26
carrying the plasmid expressing GlcKD10K, in which D was
replaced by K at the ATP binding motif. Wild type B. subtilis glcK in E. coli UE26 showed red colonies (Fig. 4).
GlcKC166A, GlcKC282A, and GlcKC321A also produced red
colonies similar to the wild type GlcK. These mutants
showed various degrees of red colour, suggestive of differential enzymatic activity (Fig. 4). However, mutants
GlcKC175A, GlcKC177A, and GlcKC182A showed colourless
phenotypes, similar to the negative controls. This phenotype indicates a complete loss of glucokinase activity
caused by the mutation (Fig. 4). This data suggests that C

at position 175, 177, and 182 is essential for enzymatic
activity of B. subtilis GlcK.
C321A mutation increases B. subtilis GlcK enzymatic
activity, which maybe independent of the dimerization
status
In order to confirm the enzymatic activity of GlcK
mutants, we overproduced and purified the wild type
GlcK, GlcKC166A, GlcKC282A, and GlcKC321A from soluble
protein fractions of E. coli RB791. Induction of mutant
GlcK was done with 1 mM IPTG at OD0.7. Three hours
after induction, proteins were harvested and subjected to
AKTA Purifier using Ni2+-NTA column. A 1000 ml culture
yielded about 1 mg of pure GlcKC166A and about 10–15
mg of pure wild type GlcK, GlcKC282A, or GlcKC321A. The
purified proteins were then tested for glucokinase activity
in vitro, by coupling the phosphorylation of glucose to the
formation of NADPH by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenese. The GlcKC166A activity was 12.3 ± 6.2 µmol min-1
(mg protein)-1, which was comparable to the wild type
GlcK activity. The GlcKC282A activity, 26.0 ± 7.4 µmol min1 (mg protein)-1, was slightly higher than GlcKC166A and
the wild type GlcK. However, GlcKC321A's activity was 5fold higher than GlcKC166A's and the wild type's. This
result was in agreement with the in vivo functional
complementation assay. Mutants GlcKC166A and GlcKC282A
displayed red phenotype of E. coli UE26 colonies similar
to the wild type GlcK (Fig. 4). As the enzymatic activity
was much higher than that of the wild type, the C321A
mutation caused much darker red colonies (Fig. 4).

mM 1,10-phenantroline (3) shows only the homodimer. A
MALDI-TOF mass spectrum shows the homodimer (70.4
kDa) and monomer (35.2 kDa) of GlcK. The 17.6 kDa peak
is the protonated form of the sample.

Similar to the wild type GlcK, SDS-PAGE analysis showed
that GlcKC166A, GlcKC282A, and GlcKC321A appeared both as
monomers and as homodimers under the non-reducing
condition. The data suggests that the enzymatic activity of
GlcK was independent of the dimerization status. Therefore, the increasing enzymatic activity of the GlcKC321A
may not correlate well with the dimerization status. Nevertheless, whether the GlcK activity is affected by different
ratios of monomer to homodimer warrants further study.
To prove that there were conformational changes of
GlcKC282A and GlcKC321A, which had higher enzymatic
activity, we analysed the GlcK mutants with fluorescence
spectroscopy. Since the GlcK contains six tryptophan (W)
and five tyrosine (Y) residues, excitation wavelengths of
280 and 295 nm were used to obtain emission spectra of
the protein. Subtraction of W spectrum at λex.295 from the

W-Y spectrum at λex.280 was done in order to obtain the
separated spectrum of Y according to Isaev-Ivanov et al.
[17]. GlcKC282A as well as GlcKC321A showed significant
increased fluorescence intensity compared to the
GlcKC166A, which has similar spectra to the wild type GlcK.
This observation is indicative of changes in their structure
due to the C mutation at 282 or 321. Increasing fluorescence intensities, as shown by GlcKC282A and GlcKC321A
(Fig. 5), were due to conformational changes by these
mutants leading to the re-positioning of tryptophan
(λex.295) and tyrosine (λex.280–295) residues. Conformational changes by GlcKC321A were more pronounced as
shown, not just by higher fluorescence intensity, but also
a shift towards higher wavelengths (red shift) of the emission peak with respect to the wild type GlcK, GlcKC166A,
and GlcKC282A (Fig. 5A, 5C). The red shift indicates a phenomenon similar to the effect of solvent reorganization.
The enhanced fluorescence suggests a quenching mechanism that involves the thiol of C residue. Both red shift
and enhanced fluorescence imply a loosening of packing
interactions in the core of the protein and co-localization
of C residues as well as W/Y residues that contribute to fluorescence [18,19]. In our case, these implications may
cause an increased ability of glucokinase to phosphorylate
glucose as shown by the increasing glucokinase activity of
GlcKC321A (Fig. 4, 5).

Discussion
We have shown that two lineages of glucokinases has
evolved with the presence or absence of the
CXCGX(2)GCXE motif. Glucokinase belongs to the ROK
family with the hallmark [LIVM]X(2)G [LIVMFCT]GX
[GA] [LIVMFA]X(8)GX(3–5) [GATP]X(2) G [RKH] motif
[14,15]. Park et al., 2000 [20] reported that some glucokinases do not contain the ROK motif. In fact, most glucokinase sequences, retrieved by us, preserved the ROK motif.
However, some of the ROK motifs belonging to the second lineage have one to four amino acid mutations.
Within the ROK family, the B. subtilis GlcK was grouped
together with B. subtilis Xyl repressor protein (XylR), putative B. subtilis fructokinase (YdhR), Streptococcus mutans
fructokinase (ScrK) encoded within a sucrose regulon,
and Zymomonas mobilis fructokinase (FruK) [14,15]. Dahl
et al., 1995 [21] analyzed the interaction of fructose, fructose 6-phosphate, glucose, and glucose 6-phosphate on
the binding of XylR into xylO. Interestingly, only glucose
stimulated the XylR binding [21]. The XylR has a ROK
motif and a CXCGX(2)GCXE motif. In contrast, Z. mobilis
FruK, B. subtilis YdhR, and S. mutans ScrK contain ROK
motifs but not the CXCGX(2)GCXE motif. Hence, the
CXCGX(2)GCXE motif may correlate with glucose binding. This is a reasonable possibility considering that the
GlcK mutants with cysteine substitution exhibited a loss
of enzymatic activity (Fig. 4).
B. subtilis GlcK was present in both monomeric and
dimeric forms (Fig. 3). Mutants GlcKC166A, GlcKC282A, and
GlcKC321A were still able to form a homodimer as shown
by SDS-PAGE, under non-reducing conditions. However,
oxidation of GlcK led to the homodimer formation (Fig.
3B). The dimerization of GlcK is possibly due to the
overall role of the ATPase domain. Proteins with the
ATPase domain acquired the capacity to dimerize and
bind to ATP in an active site between the two subunits
[22-24]. The evidence for this comes from the overall
structural symmetry between two domains of the ATPase
as well as from the symmetric arrangement of the two
phosphate binding loops [22]. The ATPase domain of
GlcK is located between amino acid residues 6 – 27: FAGIDLGGTTIKLAFINQYGEI (phosphate 1), 109 – 126:
IENDANIAALGEMWKGAGDG (connect 1), 135 – 149:
VTLGTGVGGGIIANG (phosphate 2), 255 – 282: PSKIVLGGGVSRAGELLRSKVEKTFRKC (adenosine), and 295 –
308: IAALGNDAGVIGGA (connect 2).

B. subtilis GlcK. The three-conserved C residues in that
motif are clearly essential for GlcK activity. However, the
C321A mutation led to higher GlcKC321A enzymatic activity with respect to the wild type's, suggesting more adequate glucose phosphorylation.

Methods
Bacterial strains, plasmids, and growth conditions
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are shown
in Table 1. Both B. subtilis and E. coli were grown at 37°C
in LB medium supplemented with the appropriate
antibiotics.
Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis
Sequences for eukaryotic, bacterial and archaeal glucokinases and putative glucokinases were retrieved from the
GenBank database. Those sequences were aligned using
the Clustal method [25] with the MegAlign 4.0 program
(DNAStar Co., Madison, WI). To confirm the conservative
domain, the obtained CXCGX(2)GCXE motif was used as
template for BLAST searching [26]. Neighbor joining distance trees of microbial glucokinases were produced using
the phylogenetic package MEGA2 [27]. Amino acid
differences between sequences were corrected for multiple
substitutions using a gamma correction. In this correction, α, the shape parameter of the gamma distribution,
was set to 2. Therefore, the distance between any two
amino sequences is approximately equal to Dayhoff's
PAM distance per site [27]. Support for the nodes within
phylogenetic tree were evaluated by the bootstrap [28],
which was done in 500 replicates of the whole data set.

Conclusions

Site-directed mutagenesis
D10K, C166A, C175A, C177A, C182A, C282A, or C321A
was introduced in the glcK gene of B. subtilis using the
Excite™ PCR-based site directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, LA Jolla, CA). The constructed plasmids were pLMGlcK [D22K], pLM-GlcK [C178A], pLM-GlcK [C187A],
pLM-GlcK [C189A], pLM-GlcK [C194A], pLM-GlcK
[C294A], and pLM-GlcK [C333A] (Table 1). The coding
sequences of the mutated glcKs were verified by DNA
sequencing. Sequences of primers used to introduce the
desired amino acid exchange are shown in Table 2. In
brief, the amplified DNA fragment was subjected to DpnI
digestion, which removed the pMD496 template DNA.
Mutant plasmids were transformed into Epicurian
Coli®XL1-Blue super-competent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla,
CA) and plated on LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg ml-1).

Multiple alignments and phylogenetic analysis had led
directly to valuable insights into the possible molecular
function and the evolution of glucokinase. This study enabled us to classify microbial glucokinases into two distinct
lineages, with or without the CXCGX(2)GCXE motif. The
experimental study also identified the role of C residues in

corresponding plasmids (Table 1). Cells were harvested
three hours after induction with 0.1 mM IPTG at an OD600
of ~0.7. The pellet was then resuspended and sonicated in

lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5).
Over-produced soluble proteins were purified from the
supernatant as previously described [6]. The crude extract
of cells was quickly passed over a Ni2+-loaded HiTrap
chelating column (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany), which
had been equilibrated with 40 column volumes of washing buffer (200 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole and 5 mM
Tris-Cl pH 7.5). Pure protein was eluted by a linear gradient using elution buffer (200 mM NaCl, 500 mM
Imidazole and 5 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5) at a flow rate of 0.5
ml min-1. Eluted protein aliquots of 0.5 ml were analysed
on 12% SDS-PAGE. The GlcK concentration was determined by absorption measurement at 280 nm in 50 mM
Tris-Cl pH 7.

In vivo functional complementation of B. subtilis GlcK
mutants in E. coli UE26
E. coli strain UE26 (ptsG ptsM glk) was transformed with
plasmids carrying wild type glcK or glcK mutants. In vivo
glucokinase activities were observed by monitoring colonies' colour shift from white to red on MacConkey agar.
The agar was supplemented with 50 mM glucose and 100
mM fucose [6].
In vitro assay of glucokinase activity
Enzymatic activity of wild type or mutated GlcK was quantified in vitro by a method described previously [6]. Specific glucokinase activity was determined in a coupled
enzyme assay by the method of Seno and Charter [29] in
a solution consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 20 mM
glucose, 25 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM NADP, 1 mM ATP, and 1
U of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). The
G6PDH activity was assayed by monitoring the change in
the optical density at 340 nm at 32°C with NADP as a
cofactor.
Analysis of protein multimerization with SDS PAGE,
oxidative cross-linking, and MALDI-TOF mass
spectrometry
GlcK was subjected to reducing or non-reducing conditions by using loading buffer (0.1% Bromphenolblue,
16% Glycerol, 4% SDS, and 55 mM Tris-Cl pH 6.8) with
or without 10% β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were
analysed on 12% SDS-PAGE. Oxidative cross-linking was
carried out either with H2O2 or with a complex of Cu(II)
and 1,10-phenantroline. The procedure for the oxidative
cross-linking of glucokinase was carried out as previously
described [30] using 10 µg of glucokinase and analysing
using an 8% SDS-PAGE. In order to remove the reductant,
samples were dialyzed for several hours at 4°C in buffer
(5 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.4, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT) containing 8 M, 5 M, or without urea [31]. Multimerization
and molecular mass determination of B. subtilis GlcK was
performed on a Biflex™ III Matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF
MS) (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany)
equipped with a nitrogen laser at λ = 337 nm at the Institute for Biochemistry, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg.
Fluorescence measurement
Fluorescence studies, carried out on a Spex Fluorolog
spectrometer (Edison, NJ, USA), were used to determine
spectral changes of GlcK and its mutants. The excitation
wavelength was set to 280 nm or 295 nm and the emission was recorded in the range of 300 nm to 450 nm. For
these measurements, the slit widths were set to 2.2 mm.
Fluorescence measurements were carried out at 22°C.
