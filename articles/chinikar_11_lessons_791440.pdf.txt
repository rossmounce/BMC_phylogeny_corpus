Background
Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a viral
zoonotic disease with high mortality rate in humans
caused by CCHF virus (CCHFV) belonging to the genus
Nairovirus, family Bunyaviridae, and congaing a three
segment single-stranded RNA genome. The CCHFV is
transmitted to humans by bite of infected ticks, by
direct contact with blood or tissues of infected livestock
and nosocomially. After Chaharmahal-va-Bakhtiari outbreak in 1999 whose serum samples was sent to South
Africa for diagnosis, Arboviruses and Viral Hemorrhagic
Fevers Laboratory (As National Reference Lab) was
established in 2000 to precise and on time laboratory
diagnosis of CCHF in the country. The Lab along with
CDC of Iran (national health regulator) and Veterinary
organization (control program of tick populations and
livestock monitoring) are members of National Expert
Committee on Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (NECVHFs)
for surveillance and control of CCHF in Iran.
Methods
Since the establishment of the laboratory as National Ref.
Lab, probable human sera, suspected livestock sera and tick
samples were analyzed by serological (IgM and IgG ELISA)
and molecular (Real-Time and Gel-Based RT-PCR) assays.
Results
As our result show, the mortality rate of CCHF in the
country has been declined in the recent years compared
with the early year. Regarding transmission route, most
important route of transmission has been through close
contact with blood and tissue of infected livestock, so
the highest proportion of CCHF infection has been seen
in high risk professions such as slaughterers, butchers,
farmers. By considering geographical distribution,
Sistan-va-Baluchistan not only ranked the most infected

province in Iran, but also, the infection has been seen in
all years. On the other hand, other most infected provinces included Isfahan, Fars, Khorasan and Yazd
respectively, although CCHF infection has been seen in
23 out of 30 provinces of the country. Concerning sex
distribution, males are infected with triple times as
much as females. Also, in age distribution the disease
has been prevalent in age range of 21-40 years old. The
CCHFV genome was detected in tick populations collected from different high risk areas. With respecting
genetic analysis, Our phylogenetic studies on CCHFV
genome extracted from human and tick demonstrated
that the Iranian strain have had close relationship with
Pakistani (Matin) strain and the genome extracted from
both hosts were very similar altogether.

Conclusion
With efficient trainings for high risk professions, the
mortality rates can be decreased in high risk areas. In
addition, control and prevention programs such as tick
population control may address the decline of the CCHF
disease in endemic regions and to block its prevalence to
other regions of the country. Lastly, import of livestock
to the country should be monitored and population of
livestock and tick in high risk areas and endemic regions
should be always surveyed with serological and molecular
epidemiology. With different data on mortality rate in
different endemic regions, more pathogenesis and phylogenetic analysis should be performed.
