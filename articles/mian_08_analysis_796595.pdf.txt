Abstract
Background: Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb) is a major cool season forage and turf grass species
grown in the temperate regions of the world. In this paper we report the generation of a tall fescue
expressed sequence tag (EST) database developed from nine cDNA libraries representing tissues from
different plant organs, developmental stages, and abiotic stress factors. The results of inter-library and
library-specific in silico expression analyses of these ESTs are also reported.
Results: A total of 41,516 ESTs were generated from nine cDNA libraries of tall fescue representing
tissues from different plant organs, developmental stages, and abiotic stress conditions. The Festuca Gene
Index (FaGI) has been established. To date, this represents the first publicly available tall fescue EST
database. In silico gene expression studies using these ESTs were performed to understand stress
responses in tall fescue. A large number of ESTs of known stress response gene were identified from
stressed tissue libraries. These ESTs represent gene homologues of heat-shock and oxidative stress
proteins, and various transcription factor protein families. Highly expressed ESTs representing genes of
unknown functions were also identified in the stressed tissue libraries.
Conclusion: FaGI provides a useful resource for genomics studies of tall fescue and other closely related
forage and turf grass species. Comparative genomic analyses between tall fescue and other grass species,
including ryegrasses (Lolium sp.), meadow fescue (F. pratensis) and tetraploid fescue (F. arundinacea var
glaucescens) will benefit from this database. These ESTs are an excellent resource for the development of
simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) PCR-based molecular markers.

Background

Results and discussion

On a worldwide basis, grasslands occupy twice the land
area of grain crops [1]. Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea
Schreb) is a major cool season forage and turf grass with a
genome size of approximately 6 × 103 Mbp and an outcrossing mode of reproduction [2]. Tall fescue is a hexaploid species that contains three genomes (P, G1, and
G2). The P (2x) genome originates from F. pratensis while
the G1 and G2 (4x) genomes are derived from F. arundinacea var 'Glaucescens' [3]. Tall fescue is closely related to
a number of Lolium species including perennial ryegrass
(Lolium perenne) and annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum).
The Festuca-Lolium complex contains well-adapted, highly
productive grass species that are widely distributed in
many parts of the world [4]. These cultivated forage
grasses provide numerous benefits to humans, including
providing feed and fodder for millions of dairy and beef
cattle, horses, sheep, and countless wild animals [5]. Turf
grass production for use in golf courses and lawns is a
multi-billion dollar U.S. industry. Besides the direct economic benefits gained from forage and turf grasses, their
contributions in soil conservation, environmental protection, recreation, and aesthetics are substantial.

Festuca cDNA libraries and generation of unigene sets
More than 49,000 EST sequences were generated from
nine tall fescue cDNA libraries constructed from tissues
representing various tissue types (leaves, roots, stems, and
floral meristems), growth stages (young seedlings, juvenile vegetative stage, and early reproductive stages), and
abiotic stress factors (drought, heat, and multi-factor field
stress) (Table 1). DNA sequencing success rates varied
between 75 – 97% for all libraries with an overall average
length of 536 bp. The young seedling (SD1) and heat
stressed shoot (HSS) libraries had the highest (598 bp)
and lowest (505 bp) average trimmed EST lengths, respectively (Table 1). Sequences less than 50 nucleotides in
length (7.7%), low quality sequences (1.8%), chimeric
sequences (1.8%), and contaminated sequences (3.4%)
were removed from the data set. A total of 41,834 EST
sequences were deposited in the GenBank dbEST.

To date, complete genome sequences are available for
only two plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza
sativa, both with relatively small genome sizes compared
to most crop plants. The genome of tall fescue is approximately 14 times larger than that of rice. It is unlikely that
a complete genome sequence will be available for tall fescue or any other forage or turf grass species in the near
future. For grass species with large genomes, focused
large-scale development and analysis of ESTs can provide
a basis for gene discovery and the determination of gene
function [6].
The out-crossing nature of reproduction and genome
complexity of tall fescue make conventional molecular
studies difficult and inefficient. Thus molecular studies in
tall fescue have lagged far behind those of major cereal
species. Tall fescue EST and database resources will be useful for comparative genomic analyses of this important
plant species with other major grass species, including rice
[7], and help cross-species transfer of genetic knowledge
from the well characterized species (e.g., rice) to those less
studied.
Here we report the generation of 41,516 tall fescue ESTs
characterized from nine cDNA libraries representing tissues from different plant organs, developmental stages,
and abiotic stress factors. We also report the results of
inter-library and library-specific in silico EST expression
analyses.

In collaboration with The Institute for Genomic Research
(TIGR) the Festuca Gene Index (FaGI) containing 41,516
high-quality ESTs was established [8]. A library-based
breakdown of the ESTs is shown in Table 1. Cluster analysis revealed 17,806 unigene sequences that included
11,917 singletons and 5,889 tentative consensus (TC)
sequences assembled from 29,599 ESTs (Table 2). More
than 67% of the unique sequences or 29% of all ESTs were
singletons. The number of ESTs in the TCs ranged from
two to 981 ESTs with an average of five ESTs per TC (Figure 1). More than 99% of TCs are less than 2 kb in length,
including TCs <1 kb (78%) and those between 1 to 2 kb
(21%) (data not shown). The longest tentative consensus
(TC 2128) was 3,215 bp and encodes a rice beta-galactosidase homologue (Table 2). Approximately 30% of
unique sequences are expressed at a low to medium level,
i.e. they are represented by TCs assembled from two to
nine ESTs and accounted for 42% of all sequences. Only
2.7% of unique sequences are highly expressed as they are
represented by TCs comprising more than ten ESTs. The
highly expressed genes covered 30% of the ESTs (Figure
1). Among them were 15 TCs that consist of more than
234 ESTs each. Eight of these highly expressed transcripts,
derived from stem or leaf tissue libraries, demonstrate
sequence similarities to genes with known function, most
of which are involved in carbon fixation (rubisco, photorespiration, photosystem II) and carbon metabolism.
TC1995, comprising the largest number of ESTs (981), is
most similar to a rice hypothetical protein of unknown
function.
To compare ESTs characterized from each library, the
numbers of singletons, ESTs in unique TCs and unique
ESTs were calculated. Singleton percentages were calculated by dividing singletons by the total number of ESTs
in each library. Singleton percentages ranged from 3.9%

to 61% in the DR1 and FSS libraries, respectively. Only
2.6% of ESTs assembled into unique TCs in the FSS
library. The percentage of unique ESTs, which include
both singleton and ESTs in unique TCs, is based on ESTs
present in each library, and therefore, suggests library specificity of ESTs. Almost two-thirds of the ESTs from the FSS
library are unique to this library (Table 1).
Annotation of the unigene sets
BLASTX [9] was conducted against the GenBank nonredundant protein (nr) database to assign putative identity to the Festuca unigene set. Based on an E-value cutoff
of ≤ 1 e-5, 68% (12,077) of the Festuca unigenes showed
significant levels of similarity to nr. Approximately 28%
(3,410) of these protein homologues were annotated as
unknown, hypothetical, or expressed proteins, while the
remaining (8,667) correspond to proteins with putative
known functions.

Functional annotation was assigned by mapping unigenes
onto the Gene Ontology Consortium [10] structure using
the FaGI (1.0). Unigenes with assigned putative functions
were classified into three ontologies: molecular function,
biological process, and cellular component by controlled
GO vocabulary [10]. In total, 2,410 unigenes (including
1,762 TCs and 648 singletons) were mapped to one or

library are available at NCBI.

more ontologies, with multiple assignments possible for a
given protein within a single ontology. Thus, 2,305
assignments were made to the molecular function ontology, with more than 75% of these in the catalytic activity
and binding category annotations such ligase, transferase,
helicase, and nucleotide binding proteins (Figure 2A).
Branch child terms for transporter and transcription regulator activities revealed several genes implicated in water
channel (e.g., Q40047 and Q8S4X5), carbohydrate transporter (e.g., Q8GTR0 and Q5XF02), as well as predicted
transcription factors with putative roles in stress responses
(e.g. heat shock factor RHSF6, HMG1/2-like protein,
MYB-like protein Q4L214 and Q4JL76, and zinc finger
protein genes Q5Z9H7 and O82115). Under the biological process ontology, the majority of the 1,773 assignments were to the physiological process (76%) and
cellular process (66%) categories, with frequent sub-classification into the response to stress, response to external
stimulus, and cell growth and maintenance categories
(Figure 2B). The abundance of stress-related annotations
is not surprising, considering that a significant portion of
the ESTs were generated from tissues subjected to abiotic
stresses. Of the 1,725 unigenes mapped into cellular component ontologies, the largest groups were assigned into
the cell (66%) and organelle (53%) categories (Figure
2C).

In silico analysis of gene expression
To identify putative differentially expressed genes, in silico
expression analysis were conducted by hierarchical clustering [11] of expression levels of all 5,889 TCs in the nine
cDNA libraries, represented as EST counts normalized
according to library size, using GeneSpring 7.2. The libraries were separated into four arbitrary groups based on
clustering analysis (Figure 3). Five libraries, including
DS1, LF1, SD1, FSS, and HSS formed the largest group by
step further relationships. Three libraries (DS1, FSS, and
HSS) were from stressed above ground tissues, and therefore, may share similar gene expression memberships.
Another group contains RT1 and ST1 libraries, which con-

tain apical meristem tissues active in cell division, elongation, and differentiation. Expression of ESTs generated
from stressed root tissue (DR1) significantly differed from
other libraries, and was therefore grouped into a third
block. As expected, TFM (floral meristem) library, representing ESTs from reproductive tissue showed unique
expression that differentiated from all other tissue type
libraries.
Genes sharing quantitatively and functionally related
expression patterns were also identified. Based on their
library specificity, TCs were classified into nine major
clusters (A to I) as shown in Figure 3. Each library was

cluster are homologues of enzymes involved in cytosolic
glycolysis. For example, ESTs of genes that encode for
sucrose synthase, glucose dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase were
present at 20 or greater copies in the stem library.
Cluster D includes genes specifically expressed in roots
(RT1) and contains high-copy number ESTs encoding different classes of methionine synthases and methyl transferases. ESTs of a barley metallothionein-like protein
(MT) homologue were highly expressed in the root (RT1)
library and were clustered into six TCs comprised of 139
copies. MT1, one of the four classes of metallothioneins
was previously reported to express significantly higher in
root than in other tissues such as leaf and flower [12].

assigned a major cluster containing genes specifically
expressed in the particular tissue type or stress treatment
of the library. Number of TCs included in each cluster was
from 303 (cluster I) to 1,232 (cluster G) (Figure 3).
The majority of the genes in cluster A were generated from
leaf tissue-derived ESTs. Not surprisingly, numerous photosynthesis and carbon fixation genes were highly
expressed, e.g., protein homologue of chloroplast carbonic anhydrase and rubisco activase gene transcripts
were represented by more than 570 and 244 ESTs, respectively from this library. In addition, more than 40 TCs in
cluster A were the homologues of chlorophyll a/b binding
(CAB) and photosystem II (PSII) proteins. Abundant stem
tissue ESTs were grouped in cluster C. Included in this

The genes associated with clusters E and G are mainly
expressed in actively dividing (young seedling and floral
meristem) tissues. Products of genes in these clusters are
necessary for cell cycle regulation, transcription and translation. Germination-specific cluster E contains a number
of genes coding for transcriptional factors (e.g., shaggyrelated protein kinase, CBL-interacting protein kinase,
MYB29 protein). In addition, genes involved in photosynthesis were also highly expressed in young seedlings. G,
the largest cluster comprised of 101 TCs, contains significant numbers of floral meristem ribosomal and histone
protein isoforms that comprise approximately 8% of the
members of this cluster. Histone H2, a meristem-specific
gene homologue, was present in 19 TCs from this library.
Histone H2 mRNA is transiently accumulated during a
period of the cell cycle that mostly overlaps the S phase
[13]. Our results show increased expression of these transcripts which may be indicative of active cell division in
floral meristem tissues [14].
Cluster B, F, H, and I represent drought-stressed (DS1),
heat-stressed shoot (HSS), drought stressed root (DR1),
and field stressed shoot (FSS) libraries, respectively. A
total of 2,338 TCs were contained in these four clusters,
and accounted for 40% of all contigs. Large numbers of
stress response genes were found in these four clusters,
including homologues of heat-shock and oxidative-stress
proteins, and various classes of transcription factors. Differences in stress-related gene expression were also
observed among libraries. Perhaps this is due to differences in stress mechanisms and in other environmental
and biological factors among libraries. For example, 23
TCs coding for different classes of heat-shock proteins
(cluster F) were found in the heat-stressed shoot library.
This is significantly higher than the number of heat-shock
TCs observed in other stress libraries. Heat stress induced
by high temperatures can result in damage to the photosynthetic apparatus [15] thus many chloroplast and photosynthesis related genes found in this cluster were

expected. TC1995 had high EST numbers in both
drought-stressed shoot (107) and drought-stressed root
(1,873) libraries, but was not detected in other libraries
(non-stressed shoot or root, other tissue types, or stress
treatments). This novel drought-specific TC has no similarity to any gene in the nr database. Another highly
expressed TC, a homologue of a DNA binding protein,
contained 1,272 ESTs in drought-stressed shoot and 56
EST in drought-stressed root libraries.
Environmental conditions and gene expression

stresses constitute challenges to forage production. Heat
and drought stress typically overlap during summer tall
fescue production, and both stresses may induce plant
responses leading to similar physiological changes. To
identify genes induced under stress conditions, ESTs were
generated from four cDNA libraries constructed from
drought stressed shoot (DS1), drought stressed root
(DR1), heat stressed shoot (HSS), and field stressed shoot
(FSS) tissues. ESTs were assigned GO molecular function
annotations, and EST percentages were calculated based
on comparison to libraries representing non-stressed,
greenhouse-grown tissues to identify stressed-associated
genes (Figure 4).

The field-stressed shoot library was constructed using the
entire shoot and leaf tissues harvested from field-grown
plants during mid-July with high daily average air temperatures ranging from 35.2°C to 38.7°C. Plants were under
environmental stresses including heat, drought as well as
possible field pathogens, representing severe summer pasture growth conditions in the U.S. southern Great Plains.
FSS ESTs were compared to the greenhouse-grown leaf
library to examine stress-response of above ground tissues. Many ESTs identified in the field-stressed library
include a number of stress-related gene homologoues
(e.g., cysteine proteinase, cytochrome P450, and prolinerich proteins). In addition, the percentage of ESTs
involved in enzyme regulator activity, based on ontology,
was much higher than those from non-stressed leaf
(0.74% vs. 0.27%) (Figure 4). However, a higher percentage of ESTs having transporter, binding, and catalytic
activity GO function may suggest active growth of nonstressed leaf tissue. Large numbers of genes involved in
photosynthesis and carbon fixation were found only in
the greenhouse-grown leaf library.
Comparison of drought stressed (DR1) vs. non-stressed,
greenhouse-grown root libraries revealed an elevation in
transcription regulator ESTs in drought stressed roots (Figure 4). ESTs of genes coding for components of signal
transduction pathways (MAP kinase MAPK2, Ras-related
GTP-binding protein), transcription factors (Zinc-finger
protein, WRKY transcription factors, and MYB factor), and
hormone-mediated signalling proteins (auxin response
factor 1, and 2) are included in this group. Homologues
of the rice s-adenosylmethionine synthetase gene were
highly induced in drought-stressed roots (70 ESTs), while
only four ESTs of this gene were found in non-stressed
root tissues. Ontology analyses indicate that antioxidant,
translation regulator, transporter, binding, and catalytic
activities of drought stressed root were suppressed in comparison to greenhouse grown roots (Figure 4). The expression of root-specific metallothionein-like protein genes
were significantly decreased in drought-stressed root tissues (0.46%) when compared to roots from greenhousegrown plants (1.49%). This may suggest physiological
processes, including chelation of toxic metal ions and protection against oxidative damage during the process of cellular death and degradation [12], may have been reduced
in stressed roots. ESTs unique to drought-stress were also
identified. A drought-specific gene (TC1995), which was
highly expressed only in drought-stressed root and shoot
libraries (928 ESTs – cluster H) showed no similarity to
sequences in nr. Between library EST comparisons were
made to examine changes in shoot tissue ESTs from tall
fescue plants subjected to drought-, heat-, or field-stress (a
combination of drought, heat and other environmental
stresses). Under multiple stress conditions, field stressed
shoots expressed fewer classes of genes compared to heat-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/27

(HSS) or drought- (DS1) stress alone (Figure 4). However,
many ESTs expressed in at least two of the three libraries
were found. Proline-rich protein ESTs were expressed in
both DS1 and FSS libraries, and may suggest a common
mechanism of producing osmoprotectants in response to
drought under either condition. Among the transcripts
expressed in field- and heat-stressed shoots, transcripts
encoding mitochondrial proteins such as various subunits
of NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase were
identified. Expression of these transcripts correlated with
the enhanced respiratory activity [16] detected in plants
subjected to heat stress or field stress. As expected, large
numbers of HSPs genes were expressed under both environments. Transcripts expressed under all three treatments include genes for transcriptional factors, oxidative
burst, and stress-related homologues (e.g., zinc-finger
protein, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, oxidase, DnaKtype molecular chaperone, wound-responsive family protein, proline-rich protein, jasmonate-induced protein,
cysteine proteinase inhibitor, and catalase). Our results
indicate universal expression of these genes in response to
stress conditions, similar to those reported in other studies [16-19].
Heat shock proteins and beyond
Due to the important roles of heat shock proteins (HSPs)
in multi-stress conditions, we compared the expression of
HSPs in all nine cDNA libraries (Table 3). A total 53 HSP
gene homologues were identified, representing four of the
five classes of heat shock proteins [20]. Based on their predicted molecular mass, tall fescue HSPs were grouped into
low molecular weight (15–30 kDa), HSP70 (69–71 kDa),
high molecular weight (80–114 kDa), and unclassified
HSPs (Table 3), each contains 22, 7, 9, and 15 HSPs,
respectively. Although special focus was placed on stress
treated tissues, HSPs ESTs were also present in rapidly
developing tissues of floral meristems, roots, and young
seedlings.

Generation of low molecular weight (LMW) or small (sm)
heat shock proteins is one of the unique aspects of the
heat shock response in plants [21]. Six classes of smHSPs
have been identified in stressed plants [22]. Although the
function of smHSPs has not been defined, evidence suggests that they serve as molecular chaperones to protect
cells from stress damage, but that they are not required for
normal cellular function [23]. Our EST analysis showed
that 16 LMW-HSP genes were expressed in the heat
stressed shoot library, which is significantly different from
their expression in other libraries (Table 3). The expression of five LMW-HSP genes in field-stressed shoot tissues
may reflect the high temperatures encountered during
summer. Previously we found that LMW-HSP genes were
highly induced in heat treated tall fescue but not detectable in non-stressed plants [24]. Sun et al. [25] found the

expression of HSP17.6A, a cytoplasmic class II smHSP
gene in Arabidopsis was triggered by changed water potential and was critical in osmotic stress tolerance. TC4040
codes for a wheat smHSP17.8 homologue that was highly
expressed in drought-stressed roots (48 ESTs), however,
no expression was detected in drought-stressed shoot.

logue of ClpB, a subfamily of HSP100 [29], had mid-level
expression in young seedling tissues in addition to expression in heat-stressed shoots of tall fescue. A previous study
has shown this nuclear-localized protein has a negative
influence to the growth rate of the primary root in addition to its role in thermotolerance in maize [30].

HSP70 proteins have been proven to be essential for normal cell function [26]. Some members of the HSP70 family are expressed constitutively while others are induced
by heat or cold [27]. TC63 was expressed in seven of the
nine libraries (Table 3). Interestingly, more than twenty
ESTs of this TC were found in floral meristem and greenhouse grown root libraries- tissues active in cell division
and elongation.

Because the expression of HSPs is regulated by the activity
of heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) [31], the expression pattern of HSF genes was examined for tall fescue. We
identified ten HSF genes representing eight classes of
HSFs, all of which had homologues in O. sativa. It is well
accepted that at least two families of heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) exist in plants: Class A HSFs are primarily responsible for stress-inducible activation of heat
shock genes whereas some of the class B HSFs may be specialized for repression, or down-regulation, of the heat
shock response [32]. This may explain the difference of
the expression patterns for ten tall fescue HSF genes. For
example, DT694677 which codes for HSF3 homologue
was expressed in heat-stressed shoot tissue only. This is
similar to findings regarding AtHSF3, which functions as
a key regulator of the immediate stress-induced activation
of heat shock gene transcription in Arabidopsis [33]. A
HSF6 gene homologue (TC2134) had high levels of
expression in drought-stressed roots, heat-stressed shoots,
and young seedlings, and therefore, may function in both

Divergent from LMW-HSP and HSP70 gene transcripts,
expression of high molecular weight HSP genes occurred
mostly in developing tissues (floral meristem, greenhouse
grown root, stem, and young seedlings) rather than in
stressed tissues. For example, TC148, which encodes a
barley cytosolic HSP90 homologue, was represented by
multiple ESTs in all developing tissue libraries. As a chaperone complex in plants, HSP90 functions in response to
external stimuli (abiotic stresses and pathogens) and it is
involved in phenotypic plasticity, developmental stability, and buffering of genetic variation [28]. A gene homo-

stressed and developing tissues. HSFA9 is a transcription
factor critically involved in developmental activation of
hsp17.6G1 and specifically expressed during embryogenesis in sunflower in the absence of environmental stress
[34]. A tall fescue homologue of RHSF9 was expressed in
greenhouse grown root tissues.
Expression of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), a defence
enzyme controlled by HSFs and elevated during heat
stress was also examined [35]. APX isoenzymes are critical
components that prevent oxidative stress in photosynthetic organisms by removing reactive oxygen intermediates [36]. Six genes coding for APX homologues were
identified in our tall fescue EST gene index, all of which
were expressed in heat stressed shoot. Expression of these
genes was also present in eight of the nine cDNA libraries,
but not in field stressed shoot library (data not shown). A
previous study has shown that the expression of APX was
induced shortly after tall fescue plants were exposed to
heat (12 hrs at 39°C) [37]. However, APX expression was
reduced with increased temperatures and exposure time.
Therefore, it is not surprising to find low (or no) expression of APX in plants grown under prolonged high-stress
(field) conditions.

Conclusion
Prior to this study, little or no genomic information was
available for tall fescue. In this study, we analyzed 41,516
tall fescue ESTs from nine cDNA libraries representing different abiotic stresses, tissue types and developmental
stages. A large number of known stress response gene ESTs
were identified from stressed tissue libraries. These ESTs
represent gene homologues of heat-shock and oxidative
stress proteins, and various transcription factor protein
families. The EST database reported herein has been used
for the development of 145 EST-SSR markers [38] that
have been used to generate a genetic linkage map of Festuca [39]. The development of additional EST-SSR markers
is underway [40]. A study using tall fescue EST-SSR markers in a phylogenetic analysis of 12 cool-season forage
grass species representing eight genera of four tribes from
two subfamilies of Poaceae demonstrated the utility of
these markers for comparative genomics studies among
grass species [41].
The EST characterized in this study can be used for the
development of microarrays and mined for single nucleotide polymorphism markers. This database provides a
basis for further gene discovery and the determination of
gene function. Additional cDNA libraries representing tissues subjected to other abiotic stress factors, e.g., phosphate starvation, high salt stress, summer field stress, not
included in this study will enrich this database. Moreover,
an important growth component of tall fescue, endophyte-host interactions, has not been studied in relation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/27

to gene expression. Development of ESTs from fungal
endophyte-infected tall fescue tissue may assist in better
understanding of plant-fungal symbiotic relationships.

Methods
cDNA library construction
Nine cDNA libraries were constructed to characterize
developmental stage-, environmental stress-, and tissuespecific ESTs (Table 1). Details on the libraries are available from GenBank dbEST [42]. Endophyte-free tall fescue
(cv. Kentucky 31) plants were used for cDNA library construction. In an out-crossing species, plants within a cultivar (population) are not genetically identical. Therefore,
tissues were collected from 25 plants at each sampling
time point in order to account for the genetic variation
within the cultivar. Total RNA was extracted by Tri-Reagent (MRC, Cincinnati, OH). Quality and quantity of
RNA were assessed using both an Eppendorf Biophotometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and formamide gel
electrophoresis according to standard protocols. An equal
amount of each appropriate RNA sample was pooled
together to form a composite total RNA sample. mRNA
isolation to construct the cDNA library. The mRNA was
purified by Oligotex mRNA Midi kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA). cDNA libraries were constructed using the ZAPcDNA Gigapack III Gold Cloning Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla,
CA). cDNA was size fractionated following manufacturers
instructions. Fractions containing cDNA greater than
1,000 bp were selected for library construction.
DNA sequencing and data processing
Plasmid isolation and DNA sequence analyses were performed on an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer using standard
procedures. Sequence data generated from this project
were processed through ESTAP [43]. Sequences were
screened for overall base quality and contaminating vector, mitochondrial, ribosomal and E. coli sequences were
removed.
EST assembly and annotation
Sequences with either short length (<100 bp) or low complexity were excluded from the gene index. High quality
ESTs were clustered and assembled by TGI Clustering
tools (TGICL) [44]. Tentative consensus (TC) and singleton EST sequences are available for downloading from
The Dana Faber Cancer Center [45]. A batch BLASTX [46]
comparison of the ESTs to the GenBank nr database [47]
was performed. A BLASTP search was performed against
the database of sequences associated with GO gene products which was downloaded from the GO website [48]
along with GO controlled vocabulary terms and their relationships. Following annotation, a Perl script embedded
with SQL statements was executed to count the number of
members for each library at different go term branch and
sub-branches.

In silico analysis of gene expression
Based on the assumption that the occurrence of a gene in
a cDNA library may represent the level of its tissue-specific
expression, TC member numbers were counted according
to the corresponding library by Perl and Unix bash scripts,
and a matrix exhibiting the expression differentiation of
TCs across the nine libraries was generated. In this matrix,
TCs and their membership size in each library are provided in each row and column, respectively. The data
matrix was normalized to compensate for variation in EST
sample size among libraries. Normalized gene expression
level in each library was calculated as: TC membership
size in a library/total number of ESTs of the library ×
10,000. Data was imported into GeneSpring GX 7.3 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) for expression analysis.
To compare between libraries, hierarchical clustering
analysis was performed on the matrix of in silico gene
expression pattern (counts of normalized EST copy numbers) generated by tracking unigene membership from all
nine libraries. The clustering algorithm implemented by
the GeneSpring software package measures similarity of in
silico gene expression pattern by calculating "standard correlation" and further generates hierarchical clusters using
the "average linkage" clustering algorithm. Figure 3 shows
a heat map of the data matrix with data organized based
on gene tree and condition tree clusters.
