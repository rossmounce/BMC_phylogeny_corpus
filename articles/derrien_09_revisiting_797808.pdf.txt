Abstract
Background: Among mammals for which there is a high sequence coverage, the whole genome
assembly of the dog is unique in that it predicts a low number of protein-coding genes, ~19,000,
compared to the over 20,000 reported for other mammalian species. Of particular interest are the
more than 400 of genes annotated in primates and rodent genomes, but missing in dog.
Results: Using over 14,000 orthologous genes between human, chimpanzee, mouse rat and dog,
we built multiple pairwise synteny maps to infer short orthologous intervals that were targeted for
characterizing the canine missing genes. Based on gene prediction and a functionality test using the
ratio of replacement to silent nucleotide substitution rates (dN/dS), we provide compelling
structural and functional evidence for the identification of 232 new protein-coding genes in the
canine genome and 69 gene losses, characterized as undetected gene or pseudogenes. Gene loss
phyletic pattern analysis using ten species from chicken to human allowed us to characterize 28
canine-specific gene losses that have functional orthologs continuously from chicken or marsupials
through human, and 10 genes that arose specifically in the evolutionary lineage leading to rodent
and primates.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates the central role of comparative genomics for refining gene
catalogs and exploring the evolutionary history of gene repertoires, particularly as applied for the
characterization of species-specific gene gains and losses.

Background
Comparative genomics plays a key role in understanding
organism evolution, refining functional annotation and
identifying orthology relationships. By taking advantage
of whole-genome sequence assemblies with a high level of
coverage [1-4], one can seek to provide exhaustive and

genome-scale level predictions regarding functional
sequence [5]. The general approach relies on the exploitation of sequence similarities [6-8] phylogenetic data
[9,10], evolutionary models [11,12] and evidence regarding conservation of gene order [13-15]. These often complementary comparative approaches have been developed

to estimate and improve the identification of functional
sequences for both newly sequenced species as well as reference species, such as human and mouse [16-18]. Moreover, multispecies genome scale comparisons allow to
refine protein-coding genes annotation [19-21] as well as
better understanding of the timing and the frequency of
duplication events for lineage-specific genes called in-paralogs [22,23].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/62

of 21 genes lost as pseudogenes in the canine species. To
further characterize gene losses, we inferred their phyletic
pattern in ten species from chicken to human over a
period of 310 million years. Therefore, we were able to
differentiate canine-specific losses from gene losses that
have occurred in others lineage or genes formed after the
evolutionary branchpoint leading to dog.

Results
Fine-scale comparative maps constructed using robust
orthologous sequences are key for allowing identification,
visualization and characterization of conserved segments
as well as collinearity of gene order between the species
[24,25]. Gene order between species is not random and
this has been shown to correlate with, for example, coexpressed and co-regulated genes suggesting a functional
significance [26]. Otherwise, gene order conservation
between species could also be exploited to identify relocated protein-coding genes in non-syntenic chromosomal
regions [27], as well as potentially retrotransposed genes
given that the latter correspond mostly to pseudogenes
inserted in non-syntenic regions [10]. Consequently, as
part of the characterization of architecture of a genome,
analysis of gene order conservation between species can
be a strong indicator for both gene prediction [28] and
identification of gene loss [29].
In this study, we have analyzed the sequence assembly of
the domestic dog for which the annotation process identified less protein-coding genes than expected compared
to predictions from the primates and rodent genomes. We
focused on a set of 412 genes that are all annotated in four
closely related mammals; human, chimpanzee, mouse
and rat, but absent in the dog genome in the most recent
assembly of the dog (CanFam 2.0). We exploited the
property of gene adjacency conservation between related
species to target in-depth sequence alignments over a
short genomic interval. In addition, our approach
includes a functionality test that investigates the ratio of
amino acid replacement (nonsynonymous, dN) to silent
(synonymous, dS) substitution rates, which indicates
selective constraints acting on a given genomic regions
[10]. As mutations in genes causing amino acid replacements with functional consequences are selected against
in contrast to mutations occurring in pseudogenes, we
took advantage of the distinctive patterns of dN/dS ratios to
refine the identification of new gene predictions and gene
losses occurring in dog.
Using the above strategies we identified 232 canine genes
for which synteny conservation, cross-species sequence
analysis and the neutral rate of evolution based on dN/dS
results converged strongly to support their existence. In
addition, we identified 69 gene-loss candidates of which
predictions for which accumulating ORF-disrupting
mutations, and significant dN/dS ratios support scenarios

Using all annotated genes from human, chimpanzee,
mouse, rat and dog (Ensembl v42) [30], we extracted 412
genes annotated as protein-coding in all species but dog.
These genes exhibit a '1:1:1:1:0' phyletic pattern, that is
indicative of the presence/absence of genes with a one-toone orthologous relationship among the five species. We
refer to these as 'missing genes' for purposes of this study.
We examined the structural features of the 412 missing
genes in the four mammalian reference sequences and
compared them to an independent and randomly selected
set of 400 genes. The mean length of the protein products
of the missing genes set was 722 amino acids (AA), which
is significantly smaller than the random set at 905 AA (t
test; P = 6.8e - 11). Similarly, the mean transcript size was
~50% smaller than observed in a random set (t test; P =
2.6e - 9). The mean number of exons in missing genes was
also smaller (5.8 vs 9.8; t test;P = 3.7e - 13) than the random set and particularly single-exon genes were found to
be over represented by 15%. To ensure that single-exon
missing genes were functional and not processed pseudogenes, we analyzed each, using the human dataset, for
accumulated degenerative mutations (frameshifts and
premature stop codons) in their coding sequence and
found none. In addition, we identified sequence alignment between single-exon genes and ESTs (sequence similarity > 96% for at least 150 bp) for 95% of them.
To test the underlying assumption that missing genes may
be implicated in particular biological pathways, we examined their functional annotation in the context of Gene
Ontology (GO) using the program GO Tree Machine [31].
Using the human sequence as a reference, the results demonstrate that the missing gene set is enriched for genes
implicated in physiological pathways of immunity and
organism responses to pathogens (12 genes), olfaction
(16) and regulation of transcription (63). This classification comprises functional pathways that play an important role in the adaptation of organisms to their
environment. Interestingly, these biological functions are
often linked to large proteins families that are attractive
targets for lineage-specific functions and lineage-specific
loss and gain of genes [32].
Constructing synteny maps with 1:1 orthologs
We extracted pairwise sets of 14,997; 14,798; 14,667 and
14,065 one-to-one (1:1) orthologous protein-coding
genes (Ensembl v42) between human and dog (H-D),

chimpanzee-dog (C-D), mouse-dog (M-D) and rat-dog
(R-D), respectively. Using those 1:1 orthologs as comparative anchors, we built four fine-scale whole-genome pairwise synteny maps (Additional data file 1) with the
program AutoGRAPH, which we recently developed [13].
We identified 218, 229, 326 and 325 CSOs, i.e. chromosomal segments for which markers are in the same linear
order on the chromosome as noted across species [25],
between H-D, C-D, M-D and R-D respectively. The mean
distance between two consecutive genes was ~180 kb. In
all synteny maps, CSOs cover almost the entire genome
while breakpoint regions, areas delimitating CSOs, cover
only ~5% of a genome and may contain single-gene segment or very short synteny blocks [33] (Additional data
file 2).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/62

In each pairwise synteny map, we localized the missing
gene orthologs on the reference sequence (Figure 1). Of
the 412 missing genes, the vast majority (mean of 92.3%;
range 92 to 94%) mapped within CSOs with only 7.7%
mapping within breakpoints. In all reference species the
missing genes spanned all chromosomes, although their
distribution varied greatly, i.e. one to 44 per human
(HSA) chromosome in the case of the human-dog synteny
map.
Targeting genomic intervals
We used multiple pairwise synteny maps described above
to identify short, targeted, orthologous genomic intervals.
On each reference genome, these intervals are delimited
by the closest flanking 1:1 orthologs on either side of each

the right of the figure.

missing gene that in turn define orthologous intervals on
the canine genome as shown in Figure 1. The use of multiple pairwise maps enabled us to identify the shortest
consensus interval on the canine genome to search for
genes, that we refer to as Consensus Ortholog IntervaLs
(COILs) (Figure 1). From the 412 missing genes, we
delimited 383 COILs (92.9%) having a mean size of 347
kb (Additional data file 3). For a set of 17 COILs (4.1%)
localized in common breakpoint regions (i.e. overlapping
between at least two species) [24,34] and for 12 missing
genes, no COIL could be determined because of the
absence of a consensus interval.
Targeted gene prediction
Within each canine COIL, we used the GeneWise program
[6] to splice and align the protein sequence of each reference species in order to most accurately predict the structure of the dog gene. We retained gene predictions

produced by at least two reference species protein templates. This produced 231 gene structure predictions with
amino acid identity > 40% (Figure 2). Fifty-three genes
were predicted using only rodent protein sequence as templates, thus illustrating the complementary contribution
of multispecies analysis. We post-processed GeneWise
results to detect potential gene features and found the
presence of a coding start site for 53.1% of the gene predictions. In addition, amongst the 231 predicted genes,
75% of the predictions with multi-exonic structure exhibit
at least a canonical splice site (GT/AG).
To address the question whether COIL delimitation is too
restrictive for gene prediction, we aligned the human transcript sequences corresponding to the 383 missing genes
for which we defined a COIL, against the assembly of the
canine genome sequence (CanFam 2.0) with the Exonerate program [35]. We repeated the analysis with chimpan412

zee, mouse and rat transcript sequences. We considered
the best five matching sequences to relax the limitations
of conventional best-match methods [29]. Then, we
defined a concordance between the COIL approach and
the whole-genome sequence analysis, when matching
sequences from the Exonerate-based analysis for at least
two species were totally embedded in COILs. Based on
this criterion, concordance was obtained for 342 (89.2%)
genes. Of the 41 instances with no agreement between the
expected syntenic location and the whole-genome
sequence analysis, 36 showed weak match (identity <
20%) within the canine genome assembly suggesting
unspecific alignment while five showed a significant
match, from at least two species suggesting that these
genes may have acquired a new location in the dog. Of the
latter five instances, we identified only one gene prediction (PLA2G4C) with conservative criteria indicating a
relocated gene in a non-syntenic genomic area.
In this study, we applied Genewise program with a
sequence similarity-based method that explicitly models
the conservation of gene structure and a high degree of
conservation. As such model is known to show a marked
decrease in performance for less similar genes [36], we further investigate the undetected subset of genes using a
probabilistic pair hidden Markov model (HMM) that
show a weaker dependence on percent identity and performs better to pick out distant homologs. The Genewise
HMM based analysis allowed to predict 36 additional
genes (Figure 2). Both prediction sets were merged into a
single set (n = 268) for further analysis.
Sequence alignments were next generated between gene
predictions and canine transcript sequences (Unigene
april 08 [37]). We identified significant alignment
(sequence similarity > 96% for at least 150 bp) in 53% of
cases with an average of 7.5 ESTs/mRNA per gene prediction (range 1–99). Using Interproscan, [38] protein
motifs were found from InterPro database for 80.5% of
the gene predictions, providing additional evidence for
dog gene identification.
As a further validation step, the construction of canine
predicted protein three-dimensional models was investigated based on the homologous structure of the human
ortholog or paralog (>40% identity), which was used as a
template. For the subset of genes for which the 3D structure is solved (n = 21), canine-human comparative modelling was determined using the SWISS-MODEL server
[39]. In 16 instances of canine-human comparative modelling, the mean identity obtained between sequences was
70%. Homology-based 3D model for each canine prediction was validated using the Verify 3D graphs [40] (data
not shown) that distinguish between homology models
of higher and lower accuracy.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/62

To test for possible overlap between gene predictions
obtained in this study and all canine genes annotated in
Ensembl (v42), we performed sequence alignment
between these two sets of predictions. A total of 232
(88%) predicted genes did not overlap any Ensembl
annotated protein-coding genes. Therefore, these were
classified as "definite" gene identifications together with
the delineation of new orthologous relationships with the
four reference species (Additional data file 4). The remaining 36 gene predictions overlapped an annotated gene
(protein identity > 80%) indicating that these gene predictions correspond to sequences already defined as genes,
but with undetected or spurious orthologous relationships (Figure 2). [41].
Gene prediction assessment from dN/dS analysis
To assess the validity of gene predictions through the
strength and direction of selective constraints, we used a
functionality test that uses the ratio of replacement to
silent nucleotide substitution rates (dN/dS). The ratio dN/
dS, where dN is the number of non-synonymous nucleotide substitution per non-synonymous site and dS the
number of synonymous nucleotide substitution per synonymous site, is used as a proxy for the evolutionary constraints that occur on nucleotide substitution [42]. The
calculation of the dN/dS ratio requires the comparison to a
homologous reference sequence. First, we constructed a
benchmark set of true orthologous genes using all 1:1
orthologous genes between human and dog (n = 14,994)
to obtain a representative dN/dS value. From this benchmark set, we calculated the median dN/dS ratio of 0.15
using all dN/dS values extracted from the pairwise alignments of transcripts (Figure 3). To assess the 232 gene predictions identified in this study with the functionality test,
we determined dN/dS ratio for each of the gene predictions
in comparison to their human functional orthologous
gene from pairwise transcripts alignments. We calculated
a median dN/dS of 0.19, a value highly similar to the
benchmark set (0.15). To further assess the dN/dScomparison, dN/dS values were analyzed through their distributions (as log dN/dS) between benchmark and predicted
genes sets (Figure 4) and we did not detect statistically significant differences (Mann-Whitney test; P = 0.16). Therefore dN/dS similar distributions are indicative of similar
high selective constraints and little or no positive selection on both benchmark and predicted genes sets, suggesting the functional properties of the canine gene
predictions products involved are conserved.

To analyze the evolutionary rate of the new canine predicted gene sequences in a phylogenetic context we used
the 232 mouse genes in addition to human genes and dog
predicted genes to assess the levels of selective constraint
of each lineage in comparison to the rest of the tree. In this
way, differences or similarity in selective constraints can

account the coding sequence length, we expect proteins of
similar lengths to now have similar numbers of stopcodons or a frameshift. We therefore examined the ratio of
accumulation of ORF-disrupting mutations per 100 AA in
both groups of pseudogenes. A mutation rate of 0.28 was
determined for the group of pseudogenes with one mutation and a significant higher rate of 1.21 (Mann-Whitney
test; P = 8.052e - 7) was found for the set of pseudogenes
with accumulated mutations.

mutation) and pseudogenes (with accumulated mutations)
sets exhibit a median dN/dS of 0.15, 0.18, 0.22, 0.47, respectively, compared to their human functional orthologues.
While the dN/dS distribution of pseudogenes with accumulated mutations sets is clearly shifted upwards to the theoretical value of 0.57 (average between 1.0 for no selection and
0.15 for selection from the benchmark set), the pseudogene
set with one mutation is not significantly shifted suggesting
this set may contains spurious pseudogene prediction. Predicted and benchmark gene sets have a similar dN/dS cumulative frequency distribution indicating comparable selective
constraints level.

be predicted on all lineages within the phylogeny. For
each of the 232 genes, we inferred the dN and dS values and
calculated the dN/dS ratio. The median dN/dS for the dog
lineage was found between human and mouse (Table 1),
a result in agreement to these determined for 13,816
human, mouse and dog genes with 1:1:1 orthologs [2]
with similar differences found across the three lineages.
Pseudogene predictions
Off the 412 missing genes, a subset of 55 predictions containing ORF-disrupting mutations lead to pseudogene
identification. Among pseudogenes, we determined if
protein sequences have different numbers of in-frame
stop codons and/or frameshift disruptions. Using such
quantitative measures, two mutation levels were apparent. A set of inactivated genes (n = 21) was predicted with
accumulated mutations (mean = 4.2; range 2–11) and a
second set (n = 34) was predicted with one mutation (Figure 3). To normalize the mutation rate by taking into

Although transcribed pseudogenes have been experimentally identified [43], a significant part of pseudogenes are
thought to be transcriptionally silent in comparison to
protein-coding genes. We thus searched for sequence
alignment with canine transcript sequences (Unigene
april 08 [37]) to assess the transcription activity of the
pseudogene predictions with two and more mutations.
We obtained alignment for 14%, a result in agreement
with a recent report [44] showing that 19% of pseudogenes are the sources of novel RNA transcripts. These data
indicate that the predicted pseudogenes are mostly undetected as expressed sequences in comparison to gene predictions with intact ORF (53%) and therefore significantly
correspond to untranscribed pseudogenes [44].
Detecting nonfunctionality from dN/dS analysis
To assess independently of the presence of stop codons or
frame-shifts, the validity of pseudogene predictions, we
used the functionality test that uses the dN/dS ratio. Assuming a constant mutation rate, the dN/dS ratio between dog
pseudogenes, for which a loss of function occurred, and
their human functional orthologs should theoretically
relax towards 0.57 (as the average of 1.0 in the absence of
selection and 0.15 for negative selection as we calculated
from the benchmark set) [10]. Thus, we calculated dN/dS
ratio for each of the candidate pseudogene predictions in
comparison to their human functional orthologous gene
from pairwise transcripts pair alignments. For the pseudogene set with accumulated mutations, we calculated a
median dN/dS of 0.50 indicating a considerable relaxation
of selective constraints of the canine pseudogenes in comparison to their human functional orthologous (Figure 3
and Table 1). Furthermore, the dN/dS distributions
obtained were shifted upwards in comparison to the
benchmark set (Figure 4), which is significant to a MannWhitney test (P = 5.17e - 6), indicating relaxation of evolutionary constraints on the predicted pseudogenes. For
the pseudogene set with one mutation, the median dN/dS
of 0.18 was observed, suggesting no detectable differences
in selective constraints between predicted pseudogenes
from the canine sequence and their human functional
counterparts. In addition, we analyzed whether the dN/dS
ratio has an independent value before and after the stop
codon among the predicted pseudogenes. In 26/28
instances, no significant differences were detected when

comparing dN/dS ratio for the two parts of each gene. In
two cases, the dN/dS value before the stop was indicative of
strong selective constraints (<0.1), in comparison to the
value detected after the stop (>0.9), which suggest that the
biological function may have been preserved.
We next searched to determine if the canine predicted
pseudogenes showed any deviations from the expected
rate of evolution using a phylogenetic context that
includes human and mouse gene sequences. Such variation in rate may reflect relaxation of constraints in the dog
lineage. The deviation between dog predicted pseudogenes with multiple mutations and the human and mouse

lineages differs clearly (dN/dS = 0.41 for dog, 0.19 for
mouse and 0.26 for human; Kruskal-Wallis test: P = 1.04e
- 2) while no significant deviation (P = 0.36) was observed
for the set of pseudogenes with one mutation (Table 2).
We therefore retained the 21 pseudogene predictions with
both the higher dN/dS value as characterized by pairwise
and phylogenetic approaches and high mutation rate as
gene loss candidates.
Gene loss identification
In addition to pseudogene identification, 11 gene predictions could not be detected with sufficient protein identity

(COIL) and in the whole canine sequence. For these predictions with no readily identifiable counterparts in dog,
we searched for sequence alignment with canine
expressed sequences (Unigene april 08) to address the
underlying assumption that genes are not transcribed
when placed in the context of highly degraded sequence.
We identified sequence alignment in only three cases.
These results showed that the gene predictions with poor
sequence similarity were largely undetected as expressed
sequences in comparison to gene predictions with intact
ORF.
For the last subset of 49 canine genes that remained undetected in this study, we address the possibility that gene
predictions could have been prevented because of a gap in
the canine sequence assembly. We searched for gap content in the COILs that lack canine orthologous genes. For
12 COILs, the gap content was found to account for >10%
of the total size of the COIL, seven-fold more than a random expectation set (n = 1000, gap = 1.32%) and manual
inspection of sequence content resulted in identifying
multiple sequence gaps. The 12 missing genes in those
short targeted regions were therefore not retained in further analysis. Based on these results, a total of 37 undetected genes was considered and merged with the 11 gene
predictions that could not be detected with sufficient protein identity and the 21 pseudogenes into a single set (n =
69) of gene loss candidates for further analyses (Figure 2
and Additional data file 5).

also included the chicken sequence to infer gene origins
that occurred as long as 310 million years ago (MYA) (Figure 5).
Orthologous genes were detected between human and all
species (except dog) for 11 genes. Therefore, they have an
origin that occurred before the separation of the mammals and birds lineages and have been functional for 310
million years (My). In addition, 17 genes were identified
in all species of the opossum/platypus, elephant-tenrecarmadillo and Euarchontoglires branches, a period of 170
My, 17 in all species of the elephant-tenrec-armadillo and
Euarchontoglires branches (100 My), and 10 in Euarchontoglires only (87 My) (Figure 5) [45].
Overall, 28 canine gene losses could be characterized as
being functional in other species for more than 170 My

Evolutionary scenarios of the canine gene losses
Do we detect losses of genes that occur specifically in the
dog or do such losses occur in other mammalian lineages
as well? If so, do such losses correspond to the time the
dog branch diverged from the Euarchontoglires (rodent/
primate) lineage? One way to analyze these possibilities is
to determine their phyletic pattern using ten species from
chicken to human and to define the amount of time
between gene origin and present. The timing of genes origin was defined by searching for 1:1 orthologs between
human and nine species. In addition to human, chimp,
mouse and rat genome sequence assemblies, we used scaffold assemblies of elephant, tenrec and armadillo from
the Afrotheria and Xenarthra superorder and two non-placental genome assemblies of opossum and platypus. We

Gene origin timing
Gene origin timing. Timing of gene origin is assessed by
determining the one-to-one orthologs between human and
nine species listed on the left side of the figure. The species
belong to Euarchontoglire (Primates and rodents), Xenarthra
(Armadillo), Afrotheria (elephant and tenrec), Marsupial and
Monotreme (opossum and platypus). Time of species divergence from the lineage leading to human is shown in MYA
(million years ago). Filled squares represent the presence of
the ortholog in the species. Numbers at the bottom of the

and 10 genes were not detected before 87 My and therefore specifically arose in rodent and primate lineages. For
these genes, postulating that they arose through duplication events of a parental gene, we searched for paralogs
among all human genes. For seven genes (ZNF426,
WFDC12, ZIK1, HLA-SX-alpha, PNMA5, PNMA3,
ZNF251) we identified at least one paralog (sequence
identity >30%) in the close vicinity of the parental gene
(mean of 71 kb; range: 16–128 kb).
We further used the Ensembl reconciliation tree method
[46] for checking possible duplication events specific of
the primates and rodents lineages. Indeed, assuming that
all homologous genes are known, the reconciliation of the
gene tree with the species tree allows to distinguish duplication from speciation events and therefore orthologous
from paralogous genes. Five genes (ZNF426, ZIK1, HLASX-alpha, PNMA5, PNMA3) have in-paralogs in the reference species suggesting a pattern of duplication event
(Additional data file 6).
These results suggest that tandem duplication events have
occurred and lead to specific in-paralogs in the branch
leading to human species. Another contribution of this
analysis is that it permits identification of 10 losses that
occur in several lineages indicating multiple and independent gene loss events [47].
Functional characteristics of gene losses
For the 28 canine-specific gene losses that have been functional for more than 170 My, we determined the functional annotation of the human genes using WebGestalt,
a Web-based gene set analysis toolkit [48]. The classification using the GOTree sub-module includes seven genes
that belong to the biological process of response to stimulus with PROZ, a vitamin K-dependent protein Z precursor involved in blood coagulation pathway and
SERPINA10 a protein Z-dependant protease inhibitor that
regulates factor Xa involved in blood coagulation. Moreover, it includes five genes involved in response to stimulus
pathways that play a role in sensory function such as
UGT2A which encodes an enzyme with transferase activity
that may catalyze inactivation and facilitate elimination
of odorants, OR1Q1, OR1B1, ORN1 which arethree olfactory receptors, and Noggin, a secreted polypeptide
encoded by the NOG gene that appears to have pleiotropic effect, both early in development as well as in sensory perception of sound. Other genes of interest belong
to families with at least six members such as TBX22 a transcription factor involved in the regulation of various
aspects of embryonic development, in particular cell type
specification and regulation of morphogenetic movements [49], and MS4A3 which is a subset of the superfamily of tetraspan transmembrane protein encoding
genes. Several genes were classified with function

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/62

involved in DNA repair, apoptosis and tumor formation
such as BOK which encodes a Bcl-2 related protein and
PDE1B which may play a role in apoptosis. To address the
question of which tissue might be significantly affected by
gene loss, we determined a gene-expression profile characterization per tissue based on the occurrence frequency of
the ESTs profiles of human genes corresponding to the
gene lost set using the tissue expression profile sub-module of WebGestalt. Testis-expressed gene expression profiles showed a significant over or under representation
and, to a lesser extent, expression profiles related to placenta and kidney tissues did as well (Additional data file
7).

Discussion
This study describes a multispecies comparative genomics
approach that provides a methodology for improving
genes prediction and detecting putative gene losses. When
coupled to a strategy of phyletic pattern analysis, the
approach allows differentiation of species-specific gene
loss from multiple independent gene loss. Here, focusing
on genes that were not detected in the whole-genome
assembly of the dog but annotated in four rodents and
primates species, we identified 232 new gene and we predicted 69 canine gene loss candidates of which 21 are
identified as pseudogenes,
Targeted gene prediction: strengths and limitations
A basic application of gene order-based approaches is the
capacity to detect short conserved genomic context based
on robust orthologous gene pair annotation. Therefore,
results are limited by the source of gene annotation. In
this study, we used the Ensembl annotation because of its
good gene prediction coverage of the four species used as
reference genomes. Since annotation of mammalian
genome is a continuous process, our gene order-based
approach may be improved over the course of time.

The use of short orthologous genomic intervals filtering
has been well documented [28]. First, it reduces the cost
of detecting false-positives as it filters out paralogs, with
the exception of those caused by tandem gene duplication, and alignments to processed pseudogenes. Second, it
allows a balance between sequence alignment sensitivity
versus accuracy [50]. Alternatively, for more divergent
sequences, alignment criteria may be relaxed in short predefined space where the background noise is significantly
reduced compared to a genome scale search.
In our analysis, predictions may not provide an exhaustive
list of gene predictions as inaccuracies may be generated
by sequence artifacts that typically exist in draft sequence
assemblies. Another issue related to prediction accuracy is
the unexpected and unknown level of highly divergence at
the nucleotide level. While scenarios of functional

sequences with different evolutionary rate in different species exist [51], we postulated that using protein coding
genes with a comparable evolutionary rate amongst four
reference species reduces the possibility that a gene
evolves independently in the dog species.
Computational prediction of gene loss
A corollary to targeted gene prediction is that the absence
of prediction strongly predicts gene relocation to a different region or chromosome or a gene loss event. Gene
losses arise through retrotransposition or segmental or
tandem duplications events followed by inactivation of
one copy, or by degenerative mutations. We used a computational analysis to identify genes lost as pseudogenes
based on various detrimental sequence mutations such as
in-frame stop codons and frameshifts causing or resulting
from loss of function. In this study, pseudogenes were
separated in two groups, with the group of pseudogenes
with one mutation (showing a low mutation rate) and the
second group with an elevated mutation rate (>4 mutations, on average). Pseudogene predictions with one
mutation could be overstated due to sequence artifacts
that exist in the assembly. Indeed, stop codons and
frameshifts are accommodated by algorithm like GeneWise. Other programs specifically designed for aligning
pseudogenes such as GeneMapper [52] may be useful for
addressing this problem. Another hypothesis is that pseudogene predictions have existed as pseudogenes (i.e. inactivated) for different amounts of time in the carnivore
lineage. The formation of pseudogenes present in the
canine genome could have been initiated by different or
multiple events rather than have resulted from a continuous process over the course of time. Pseudogene characterization through the ratio of silent to replacement
nucleotide substitution rates (dN/dS) may be a good indicator of changes in selective constraint that tend to be
recent [53]. It is clear from our analysis that the dN/dS
approach is useful to assess the evolutionary constraints
that occur on nucleotide substitution. However, inferences of selection need to be treated with extreme caution.
Functional impact of gene loss
We identified 28 gene losses that have been functional for
more than 170 million years, a time period that extends
from platypus to human (Figure 5). Losses of gene in a
given species can be considered an adaptive event that
may confer selective advantages to an organism [54]. Similarly to neutral losses, adaptive losses occurring ~95 MYA
(for lineage leading to canid) are expected to leave
genomic signatures with ORF-disrupting sequence mutations accumulation due to sequence degeneration. Here,
the losses identified are based on ORF-disrupting
sequence mutations, absence of EST validation and
absence of significant similarity at the protein level.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/62

Although highly speculative, one hypothesis is that species-specific gene loss may confer a selective advantage in
dog. Among the gene losses we identified were PROZ, a
vitamin K-dependent protein Z precursor gene involved in
response to stimulus that plays a role in blood coagulation. Mammalian blood coagulation is initiated and regulated by a complex network of interactions involved in
normal hemostasis. Interestingly, Lindberg et al. describes
a decrease of the expression of heme and globin related
genes that correlate with the tameness trait in silver foxes
suggesting that differences in behavior have a genetic basis
[55]. A second hypothesis, is that gene loss may be a direct
reflection of the loss of redundancy, where functionally
overlapping genes cover for the loss of function as for
genes involved in sensory functions [56,57].

Conclusion
Among mammals, one-to-one orthologous correspondence can be defined for a large part of gene repertoires.
Complex homologous relationships such as one-to-zero
and many-to-many ones remain to be deciphered within
gene families, for genes with divergent sequence as well as
for species-specific genes that have emerged or have been
lost through evolution. The combination of multispecies
comparative genomics with in-depth gene prediction,
accurate consideration of phylogenetic relationship, and
timing of gene origin events can predict both gene structure and gene losses in newly sequenced genomes. This, in
turn, enhances the integrity of reference genomes. The end
result is a higher quality product for all sequenced
genomes, regardless of the depth of sequence. We aim to
see this approach applied to many other model organisms, thus enhancing the utility of the new sequencing
resources throughout the comparative genomics community.

Methods
Gene datasets
Biomart [58] version 0.5 (Ensembl v.42) was used to collect orthologous protein-coding genes from the five
genomes of interest: human (NCBI 36), chimp (Chimp
2.1), mouse (NCBI m36), rat (RGSC 3.4) and dog (CanFam 2.0). Ensembl Gene Id, orthologous relationships,
locations in base pair for each species were downloaded
and deposited into a MySQL database (v.4.1.12). The set
of 412 protein-coding genes not annotated on the dog
genome
assembly
with
a
1:1:1:1:0
Human:Chimp:Mouse:Rat:Dog match was then extracted
from the MySQL database.
Synteny maps
We used the program AutoGRAPH [13] to construct pairwise synteny maps between reference genomes and tested
genome. AutoGRAPH has been designed to construct syn-

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:62

teny maps using genomic coordinates of ortholog pairs.
The program transposes genomic coordinates into
sequence of ordinal numbers and positions genes on an
ordinal scale in relation to others on their respective chromosomes. Conserved segments ordered (CSO) can then
be identified with respect to the ranking order. We only
considered CSO containing a minimum of three genes.
AutoGRAPH inferred the collinearity rate within CSO corresponding to the longest increasing gene order sequence
between the two species divided by the total number of
orthologs. We discarded CSO that had a collinearity rate
less than 0.5. All synteny maps (n = 88) built in this work
are presented in Additional data file 1 and can be downloaded.
Gene structure prediction
The GeneWise program [6] (wise2-2-0) was used with
default parameters to align each reference protein on the
dog COIL forward and reverse strands (option -both)
sequence. Predictions were post processed to pick up the
highest genewise prediction, to compute sequence identity/similarity against reference proteins and to analyze
splice sites conservation. Only predictions exhibiting at
least 40% identity with reference proteins were retained.
GeneWise was also used with the Hidden Markov model
that uses HMM profiles generated with the HMMER package [59]. HMM-based prediction considers exons, introns
and UTR regions as different states of gene structure that
occupy subsequences of a sequence. A gene structure can
be considered as an ordered set of state/sub-sequence
pairs. A HMM-based prediction is considered as a predicted gene structure if probability of generating a gene
structure is maximal over all possible states. Dynamic programming method for finding an optimal parse, or the
best sequence of states has [10] been computed with the
HMMER package.
Homology searches
Reference transcript sequences were collated from
Ensembl (v.42) and aligned against the canine sequence
assembly (CanFam2) with the program Exonerate v1.2
[35]. Exonerate includes various models for aligning
splice sites, combining speed and accuracy. We used the
est2genome model, with a minimum perfect match of 18
bases to trigger alignments (dnawordlen 18). For each reference transcript, we retained the best five matching
sequences.

Canine proteins inferred from the gene predictions were
aligned against all canine transcripts with Exonerate using
the coding2coding model. Canine predicted proteins
were aligned on canine dbEST (est.fa 05/19/07 from
UCSC) and UNIGENE (April 2008) using Exonerate with
the protein2genome model.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/62

The protein three-dimensional structure was available for
21 human genes. The sequences were retrieved via the
Protein Data Bank. The amino sequences for the corresponding canine predictions were obtained from the
genewise program prediction. Canine-human comparative modelling was determined using the SWISS-MODEL
server [39]. Amino acid sequences are aligned between the
primary structure of the human and the canine sequence.
The three-dimensional model is constructed through the
process implemented in the SWISS-MODEL server.
DN/dS analysis
DN/dS analyses were conducted using the maximum-likelihood-based CODEML program (model = 0; PAML package) [60]. Sequence alignments of the whole coding
region of the human orthologous sequence with canine
prediction were realized with clustalW program. Ds values
were calculated from pairwise alignments using all transcripts. To filter for possible inconsistencies among
orthologous trancripts, we selected the transcript with the
smallest phylogenetic distance using the smallest dS. For
each dataset, we calculated a threshold on dS which two
fold the median dS; all dS larger than this threshold were
not used for the dN/dS calculation. DN/dS values of the
benchmark set were extracted from Ensembl. DN/dS ratio
in the phylogenetics context were calculated using
CODEML program using the branch model set as model
= 1 and run mode = 0. Sequence alignments of the whole
coding region of the human, mouse and canine prediction orthologous sequence were realized with clustalW
program
Gene Ontology annotation
The Gene Ontology Tree Machine (GOTM) and WebGestalt programs [31,48] were used to retrieve GO term associated with ensembl gene ID. A hypergeometric test
computes the statistical significance of overrepresentations of GO term compared to a reference complete list of
genes. Only GO terms that were significantly over-represented (P < 1.0e - 3) were considered.
Determining gene origin
For each of the 69 candidate gene losses, one-to-one
orthologous gene was searched between human and nine
species using the complete collection of orthologous protein-coding genes (Ensembl). Genome sequence assemblies were used for human, chimp, mouse, rat,
monodelphis, platypus and chicken and scaffold assemblies for elephant, tenrec and armadillo. Timing of gene
origin was inferred by determining the longest serie of
one-to-one orthologs between the human and each of the
nine species.
