Background: Chromosome four of Drosophila melanogaster, known as the dot chromosome, is
largely heterochromatic, as shown by immunofluorescent staining with antibodies to
heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and histone H3K9me. In contrast, the absence of HP1 and
H3K9me from the dot chromosome in D. virilis suggests that this region is euchromatic. D. virilis
diverged from D. melanogaster 40 to 60 million years ago.

Conclusion: Combining these results with recent findings about RNAi, we suggest that specific
repetitive elements, as well as density, play a role in determining higher-order chromatin packaging.

Results: Here we describe finished sequencing and analysis of 11 fosmids hybridizing to the dot
chromosome of D. virilis (372,650 base-pairs) and seven fosmids from major euchromatic
chromosome arms (273,110 base-pairs). Most genes from the dot chromosome of D. melanogaster
remain on the dot chromosome in D. virilis, but many inversions have occurred. The dot
chromosomes of both species are similar to the major chromosome arms in gene density and
coding density, but the dot chromosome genes of both species have larger introns. The D. virilis dot
chromosome fosmids have a high repeat density (22.8%), similar to homologous regions of D.
melanogaster (26.5%). There are, however, major differences in the representation of repetitive
elements. Remnants of DNA transposons make up only 6.3% of the D. virilis dot chromosome
fosmids, but 18.4% of the homologous regions from D. melanogaster; DINE-1 and 1360 elements
are particularly enriched in D. melanogaster. Euchromatic domains on the major chromosomes in
both species have very few DNA transposons (less than 0.4 %).

Comparison of dot chromosome sequences from D. melanogaster
and D. virilis reveals an enrichment of DNA transposon sequences in
heterochromatic domains

R15.2 Genome Biology 2006,

Volume 7, Issue 2, Article R15

Slawson et al.

Background

FDNA in the eukaryotic interphase nucleus can broadly be
distinguished as packaged into two different forms of chromatin, heterochromatin and euchromatin [1]. Classically,
heterochromatin has been described as the fraction that
remains highly condensed in interphase, has high affinity for
DNA-specific dyes, and is commonly seen around the periphery of the nucleus [2]. Heterochromatic regions of the
genome have very low rates of meiotic recombination and
generally replicate late in S phase. These regions are rich in
repetitive sequences, including remnants of transposable elements and retroviruses, as well as simple repeats (satellite
DNA). Heterochromatin tends to be gene poor, and those
genes found in heterochromatin tend to be larger (longer
transcripts) than genes found in euchromatin [3]. Introns of
heterochromatic genes have a much higher density of transposable elements than introns of euchromatic genes,
accounting for this shift [4]. The less densely packaged
euchromatin contains most of the actively transcribed genes.
In contrast to this general picture of repeat distribution, Pardue et al. [5] have found by in situ hybridization that the frequency of (dC-dA)·(dG-dT) dinucleotide repeats is higher in
euchromatin than in heterochromatin.
Several biochemical marks have been identified that distinguish heterochromatin from euchromatin, including a distinctive pattern of histone modification and the association of
particular chromosomal proteins [6]. High concentrations of
heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) are found primarily in pericentric heterochromatin and associated with telomeres in
organisms from the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe to
mammals [7,8]. Histones in euchromatic domains are typically hyperacetylated, particularly the amino-terminal tails of
H3 and H4. In contrast, methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9
(producing H3K9me) is a consistent mark of heterochromatin [9]. HP1 binds to H3K9me through its chromo domain
and to SU(VAR)3-9, a methyltransferase that specifically
modifies histone H3 at K9, through its chromo shadow
domain [9,10]. These interactions are thought to contribute
to heterochromatin maintenance and spreading [1]. The functional significance of this chromatin packaging is demonstrated by the observation that loss-of-function mutations in
the gene for HP1, including one that disrupts binding of HP1
to H3K9me, result in a loss of silencing of reporter genes
placed in or near heterochromatin (suppression of position
effect variegation) [11].
Chromosome four of Drosophila melanogaster, also known
as the dot chromosome or the F element, is unique in its chromatin composition. The banded portion (amplified during
polytenization) is 1.2 Mb long with 82 genes; this gene density
is similar to that of the euchromatic regions of the major
(euchromatic) chromosome arms [12,13]. However, the
fourth chromosome also displays many characteristics of heterochromatin, including late replication [14] and a complete
lack of meiotic recombination [15]. The banded region of

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/2/R15

chromosome 4 is known to have an approximately ten-fold
higher density of repetitive elements (for example, remnants
of retroviruses, transposable elements) in comparison with
the long arms of chromosomes 2, 3, and X [16-19], but has little or no (dC-dA)·(dG-dT) dinucleotide repeats [5], again
resembling heterochromatin rather than euchromatin.
Immunofluorescent staining of polytene chromosomes with
antibodies directed against HP1 shows an abundance of HP1
in a banded pattern on chromosome four [20]. A very similar
pattern is seen with antibodies directed against H3K9me
[9,21].
A transposable P element containing an hsp70-driven white
(w) gene has been a useful reporter of chromatin packaging,
giving a uniform red eye phenotype when inserted into the
euchromatic arms but a variegating phenotype when inserted
into the pericentric heterochromatin or into telomere associated sequences [22]. The variegating phenotype is associated
with packaging into a nucleosome array showing more uniform spacing, accompanied by a loss of DNase hypersensitive
(DH) sites [23]. Transposition events resulting in insertions
on the fourth chromosome produce both variegating and
solid red eye phenotypes. The data suggest that while the
fourth chromosome of D. melanogaster is largely heterochromatic, it also includes some euchromatic domains [23].
P element transposition-induced deletions and duplications
of small genomic regions around the genes Hcf and CG2052
on chromosome four have been shown to cause switching of
eye phenotypes from red to variegating and vice versa [24].
Mapping of the breakpoints has shown that the small deletions and duplications lead to changes in the distance of the
reporter from a particular DNA transposon, 1360 (also
known as hoppel or PROTOP_A). In the region of the fourth
chromosome studied, if the inserted P element is within
approximately 10 kilobases (kb) of a 1360 element, the white
reporter gene has a greater than 90% chance of exhibiting
variegating expression, suggesting it is in a heterochromatic
domain. If the reporter is more than 10 kb away from a 1360
element, it has a greater than 90% chance of generating a red
eye phenotype, suggesting that it is in a euchromatic domain.
Therefore, Sun et al. [24] have suggested that proximity to the
1360 element can influence the chromatin packaging state.
Recent results from fungi and plants [25], as well as Drosophila [26] have shown that heterochromatin formation is
dependent on the RNA interference (RNAi) system. Small
double-stranded (ds)RNAs have been recovered from many
of the repetitive elements in Drosophila, including 1360 [27],
and might target repetitive elements in the genome for silencing by initiation and spreading of heterochromatin
packaging.
The small dot chromosome exists in many species of Drosophila [28]. It has long been recognized that phenotypes of
similar mutations map to the dot chromosomes of both D.
melanogaster and D. virilis [29,30]. Podemski et al. [31] have

equal staining, red represents more H3K9me staining, and green represents more HP1 staining. The dot chromosome is indicated with an arrow. In D.
melanogaster, antibodies for HP1 and H3K9me stain both the chromocenter and the dot chromosome, although the HP1 staining is slightly stronger than

shown that probes for several genes from the D. melanogaster fourth chromosome, including ci and Caps, hybridize to the dot chromosome in D. virilis. D. virilis is a member
of a Drosophila genus that diverged from D. melanogaster 40
to 60 million years ago [32]. In addition to the sex chromosomes, it has four large autosomes, rather than the two of D.
melanogaster; thus, the dot chromosome of D. virilis is chromosome six. The polytenized regions of both dot chromosomes are similar in size. In this study, we will refer to
chromosome six of D. virilis and chromosome four of D. melanogaster as dot chromosomes. Our analysis concerns the
banded 1.2 Mb region of these chromosomes, estimated to
contain approximately 80 genes.
Prior reports indicated that the dot chromosome of D. virilis
does not share the heterochromatic characteristics of the dot
chromosome of D. melanogaster, despite the fact that it
maintains a similar proximity to the heterochromatic chromocenter, as seen in polytene nuclei. In situ hybridizations
performed by Lowenhaupt et al. [33] demonstrated that the
(dC-dA)·(dG-dT) dinucleotide repeat frequency of the D. virilis dot chromosome is similar to that in its euchromatic arms.
In contrast to the observations using D. melanogaster,
recombination is observed on the D. virilis dot chromosome
[30,34]. Further, the polytenized portion of the dot chromosome in D. virilis fails to stain with antibodies directed
against HP1 [20] (Figure 1b).
Comparative genomics has been invaluable in discovering
new functional and regulatory elements in the genomes of a
cluster of yeast species, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as
the reference point [35]. We believe this comparative
approach will be equally valuable as comparisons of Drosophila species become possible [36,37]. If the gene compositions of the dot chromosomes of D. melanogaster and D.
virilis are similar, what other differences in the DNA
sequence could lead to the apparent difference in higherorder chromatin structure? To address this question, we have
generated a finished, clone-based sequence for a sample from
the D. virilis dot chromosome and from the long chromosome
arms; finished sequence leads to more accurate inferences
about repetitive sequences [38]. By comparing similar
regions of the two dot chromosomes, we show that while the
overall repeat density of the dot chromosomes is similar, the
density of DNA transposon remnants is significantly higher in
D. melanogaster than in D. virilis; the difference is particularly striking for the DINE-1 elements and 1360 elements, discussed above. These results, combined with recent findings
about RNAi, lead us to suggest that the difference in chroma-

tin packaging between the dot chromosomes of these two species of Drosophila could be a function of the density and
distribution of a subclass of repetitive elements.

Results
Immunofluorescent staining indicates that the D. virilis
dot chromosome is largely euchromatic, in contrast to
the heterochromatic D. melanogaster dot chromosome
The dot chromosome of D. melanogaster is largely heterochromatic, with some interspersed domains of euchromatin
[24]. Immunofluorescent staining of D. melanogaster polytene chromosomes using HP1 antibody shows a banded pattern on the dot chromosome. Many species in the Drosophila
genus closely related to D. melanogaster share this staining
pattern, including D. simulans, D. yakuba, and D. pseudoobscura (data not shown). In D. melanogaster, staining with an
antibody against histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 (antiH3K9me) coincides with the HP1 staining, at a level slightly
less than seen in the pericentric heterochromatin [21] (Figure
1a). In contrast, the dot chromosome of D. virilis does not

Initial annotation focused on gene finding. D. virilis is evolutionarily close enough to D. melanogaster that the protein
coding regions are well conserved. Gene prediction algorithms and local alignment search tools (such as GENSCAN
and BLAST; see Materials and methods) were used to annotate genes and determine intron-exon boundaries. In most
cases, it was possible to identify the entire coding region of
the gene, but the high level of sequence divergence made
defining untranslated regions impossible [36]. Comparison
of the D. virilis contigs with homologous regions of the D.
melanogaster dot chromosome identified specific regions

Fosmid sequencing and annotation

libraries were prepared and approximately 600 subclones
from each fosmid were end sequenced. The sequences were
assembled and finished to high quality by Washington University undergraduate students in the Bio 4342 'Research
Explorations in Genomics' course, using phred, phrap, and
consed [41-43]. Finished sequences had an estimated error
rate of less than 0.01%, and showed in silico restriction
digests that matched digests obtained from the starting fosmid with a minimum of two enzymes. Students annotated the
finished sequences by looking for genes, repetitive elements,
and other features as described in Materials and methods.
Four pairs of fosmids have significant sequence overlap; each
pair was collapsed into a single contig of non-redundant
sequence (contigs 30, 50, 67, and 80).

similarity to act as conserved hybridization probes. The
desired probes (see Materials and methods) were radiolabeled and used to screen a D. virilis genomic library
(BDVIF01 fosmids, Tucson strain 15010-1001.10, available
spotted on a single filter) at low stringency. Positive clones
were verified and characterized by in situ hybridizations to
the polytene chromosomes from third instar larval salivary
glands of D. virilis. Sample results are shown in Figure 2.
Eleven fosmids were recovered with homology to the dot
chromosome of D. virilis, and seven fosmids were recovered
with homology to the major chromosome arms. Based on the
in situ hybridization results, the order of the fosmid clones on
the dot chromosome is as follows: contigs 30, 103, and 106
appear to cluster near the centromere; contigs 67, 72, and 91
are in the middle of the chromosome; and contigs 50 and 113
hybridize near the telomere. There is also a minor signal with
the contig 30 probe near the telomere; this may be the result
of a repetitive element present in multiple regions in the
chromosome.

in D. virilis, whereas in D. melanogaster, there are more transposable elements in the introns. All of the fosmids described here with homologous regions in
D. melanogaster have been annotated in a similar manner; the maps are available in the Additional data files. Scale: one division equals 5 kb.

where synteny has been maintained, as well as those regions
where inversions have occurred. Figure 3 shows a comparison
of two D. virilis contigs with the homologous regions from the
D. melanogaster chromosomes. Detailed annotation results
and comparisons between the other individual D. virilis fosmids and their homologous regions in D. melanogaster are
available as Additional data file 1 (dot chromosome
sequences) and Additional data file 2 (non-dot chromosome
sequences). Note that the strain of D. virilis used here is a different strain from that recently sequenced (by Agencourt Bioscience Corporation, Beverly, MA, USA). The two strains
differ by about 1% base substitutions, with numerous insertions or deletions (indels), but show similar organization at
the gene level (CDS, unpublished observation). The clonebased sequencing used here results in more accurate inferences in regions that are highly repetitive; the sequences most
likely to be missed in whole genome shotgun techniques are
the repeats [38].
Table 1 shows all contigs sequenced, giving their total sizes,
listing annotated genes, and providing clone names (BACPAC

Center). In situ hybridization results identified the fosmids as
either on the dot chromosome or on a major D. virilis chromosome. In parentheses following each gene is the chromosome position of the gene in the genome of D. melanogaster.
Figure 4 maps the contigs from the dot chromosome of D. virilis to the dot chromosome of D. melanogaster based on the
presence of orthologous genes. Three of the contigs (67, 106,
and 113) are completely syntenic with respect to the D.
melanogaster dot chromosome. One contig, 103, is completely syntenic with respect to its genes from the dot chromosome, but also contains CG5367, a gene from the second
chromosome of D. melanogaster. Four contigs (30, 72, 50,
and 91) contain genes that are exclusively from the dot chromosome of D. melanogaster but show evidence of a high
number of inversions with respect to the D. melanogaster
chromosome. For example, contig 30 contains both pan and
Caps, genes that come from opposite sides of the banded portion of the D. melanogaster dot chromosome. (This rearrangement was also observed in earlier studies [31].) Of the
28 genes identified in the D. virilis dot chromosome clones,
only one lies elsewhere in the D. melanogaster genome. In

genes that have been cloned and sequenced (for example,
light [44]) suggests that these genes may have larger introns
on average, and this has been reported for D. melanogaster
dot chromosome genes [19]. Average intron size, defined as
total intron length divided by total number of introns, is 448

it is 859 bp (± 115 bp). Figure 5 shows a graph that compares

between the two dot chromosomes is not statistically significant (D = 0.1237, p = 0.2816). However, the distribution of
intron sizes for the dot chromosomes is significantly different
from those for the major chromosomes for both species (D =
0.223, p = 0.0496 and D = 0.245, p = 0.0291 for D. virilis and
D. melanogaster, respectively).

deposited research

the D. virilis contigs from major chromosomes, four (contigs
13, 112, 121, 122) are completely syntenic compared to homologous gene regions from D. melanogaster, and two (contigs
11 and 80) show inversions within the chromosomes. Only
one major chromosome contig (80) contains a gene that is
found on the dot chromosome in D. melanogaster. Contig 80
maps to a major arm of D. virilis; it contains D. melanogaster
dot chromosome gene CG1732 flanked by several genes from
D. melanogaster chromosome 3. In total, the fosmids
sequenced represent 372,650 bp of sequence from the dot
chromosome of D. virilis and 273,110 bp of sequence from the
major chromosomes. D. virilis contigs 72 and 91 from the dot
chromosome and 11 and 80 from the major arms showed so
much rearrangement that it was impossible to define precise
homologous area(s) from D. melanogaster. These contigs
were not used in comparisons for intron size, percent DNA
transcribed, or in any of the repeat density calculations. Maps
representing locations and sizes of genes and repeats in each
contig are available in Additional data files 1 and 2.

Distribution of intron sizes in D. virilis compared to D. melanogaster. Introns from all D. virilis and D. melanogaster genes in the contigs studied were
separated into groups based on size. The number on the x axis represents the minimal intron size; an intron is counted in that bin if it has that many bases
or fewer. The y axis tallies the percent of total introns that fall into that bin. The two dot chromosomes have significantly similar intron size distributions,
which differ significantly from those of the major chromosome arms.

be identified in the putative D. virilis genes.) The sequenced
regions of the D. virilis and comparable regions of the D. melanogaster dot chromosomes have transcript densities of
58.7% and 51.0%, respectively, while transcript densities of
the major chromosomes are 22.2% for D. virilis and 25.9% for
D. melanogaster. The difference in percent DNA transcribed
between the dot and non-dot contigs reflects the larger average size of introns in the dot chromosome genes.

(dC-dA)·(dG-dT) dinucleotide repeat frequency
One marker of euchromatin is the presence of abundant (dCdA)·(dG-dT) dinucleotide repeats, also known as CA/GT
repeats. In situ hybridization shows that these repeats are
widely distributed in euchromatin, but that the dot chromosome of D. melanogaster has a much lower density of these
repeats [5]. The dot chromosome of D. virilis has a CA/GT
repeat frequency similar to its major autosomes, as shown by
in situ hybridization [33]. Dinucleotide repeat analysis of the
sequences from the D. virilis fosmids in comparison with the
homologous regions of the D. melanogaster genome supports
the in situ hybridization results. The fosmids from the dot
chromosome of D. virilis have CA/GT repeats with an average
length of 36 bp and a total density of 0.15%. Regions of the D.

melanogaster dot chromosome homologous to these fosmids
have only one CA/GT repeat, which is 21 bp long, giving a
total CA/GT density of 0.0069%. In the D. virilis clones mapping to major chromosomes, 0.96% of the DNA is made up of
CA/GT, with the average repeat being 32 bp long. In homologous regions of the D. melanogaster genome, 0.32% of the
DNA is CA/GT, with the average length of dinucleotide
regions being 24 bp. Thus, while the D. virilis dot chromosome has a lower level of CA/GT than the major chromosome
arms (about six-fold less than D. virilis and about two-fold
less than D. melanogaster), it has a approximately 20-fold
higher level of this repeat than is found in the dot chromosome of D. melanogaster.

Repeat analysis
Initial analysis of known repetitive elements in the D. virilis
contigs was performed using RepeatMasker [45]. RepBase
8.12 [46,47] contains previously characterized repeats from
the D. virilis species group. As a simple initial approach we
searched for de novo repeats by comparing the fosmid
sequences to each other, looking for regions of high similarity
by BLASTN [48]. Most apparently novel repeated sequences
identified by this technique were immediately adjacent to

Repeat 6 (see of D. virilis contigs compared to the D. melanogaster genome
Repeat analysis of D. virilis contigs compared to the D. melanogaster genome. The repeat density, defined as the percentage of total sequence (in base-pairs)
that has been annotated as repetitive has been calculated using the D. virilis fosmid sequence obtained in this study and homologous regions from D.
melanogaster (see Materials and methods). D. melanogaster and D. virilis have a very similar low repeat density on the major chromosome arms, and a similar
but much higher repeat density on the dot chromosomes. (a) Percent repeat for each type identified by RepeatMasker using RebBase 8.12 with additional
repeats identified in a BLASTN all-by-all comparison of the fosmid sequences presented here. (b) Percent repeat for each type identified by RepeatMasker
using the Superlibrary (see text for description). The dot chromosome of D. melanogaster has about three times more DNA transposon sequence than
does the D. virilis dot chromosome. 'Unknown' repeats are those from both RebBase 8.12 and the D. virilis PILER-DF library that have not been classified as
to type.

known repeats identified by RepeatMasker and were, therefore, assumed to be unmasked extensions of those repeats. A
few novel repeats were identified that were not similar to any
other known repetitive element, expressed sequence tag
(EST), or protein sequence. Using this simple technique,
novel repeats constituted less than 1% of the total repetitive
DNA; however, given the small size of our dataset (0.65 Mb)
it is possible that repetitive elements could be missed.
Figure 6a shows the repeat density of different classes of
repetitive elements in the D. virilis contigs and the comparable regions of the D. melanogaster genome using RepeatMasker/RepBase (Drosophila default parameters) plus this
simple de novo BLASTN technique. While there is some variation in repeat density between the contigs of a given region
(dot chromosome or major chromosome), the totals appear to
represent an average value of the contigs studied. Using this
analysis, the overall repeat density of the D. virilis dot chromosome contigs is 14.6%; the average of the individual repeat
densities is 15.4% ± 7.9%. The overall repeat density of the
homologous D. melanogaster regions is 25.3%; the average of
the individual repeat densities is 24.7% ± 5.4%. Fosmids from
the dot chromosome of D. melanogaster show a consistently
higher density of DNA transposons and DINE-1 elements
than do the fosmids from the dot chromosome of D. virilis.
Comparison of the sample from the dot chromosome of D.
melanogaster analyzed here to the entire banded portion of
the dot chromosome (using RepeatMasker and RepBase 8.12)
shows very similar results (Figure 6a). In contrast, the
euchromatic arms of the large chromosomes of D. melanogaster and D. virilis have similar repeat densities, with
approximately 6% of the sequence classified as repetitive.
(Quesneville et al. [49] estimate the total repeat density of D.
melanogaster to be 5.3%.) Other repeat types differed
between the two species as well. In our sample from these
chromosome arms, D. virilis has more simple repeats and D.
melanogaster has more retroelements. Overall, these results
suggest that both the higher repeat density and the overrepresentation of DNA transposons contribute to heterochromatin formation on the D. melanogaster dot chromosome.
However, because D. virilis is not as well studied as D.
melanogaster, it is possible that this approach misses some
uncharacterized repeats. To address this issue, we undertook
several different strategies.
Recent investigations have developed multiple search tools
for de novo identification of novel repetitive sequences in

genome assemblies [50,51]. Using such tools, we created a
'Superlibrary' in which we added sequences from species-specific libraries from both D. melanogaster and D. virilis to the
RebBase 8.12 Drosophila transposable element (TE) library
to generate a library with as little bias as possible. The additional repeats came from three sources. Two novel repetitive
elements that were identified in D. melanogaster using the
PILER-TR program were added [50]. We also added a complete set of 66 elements from D. virilis identified by PILERDF analysis (C Smith and G Karpen, personal communication) of the posted D. virilis whole genome assembly [52].
Finally, a recently identified sequence of DINE-1 from D.
yakuba was added [53].
All of the D. virilis and D. melanogaster sequences used in
this study were then analyzed for repetitive DNA using
RepeatMasker with this Superlibrary. This approach
identified a total repeat density of the D. virilis contigs from
the dot chromosome of 22.8%, while homologous regions of
the D. melanogaster dot chromosome have 26.5% repetitive
DNA (Figure 6b). Using the same Superlibrary, the segments
from the major chromosomes of D. virilis have a total repeat
density of 8.4%, compared to D. melanogaster major chromosomes, which have a density of 6.8%. This analysis shows
that the overall density of repeats on the D. virilis and D. melanogaster dot chromosome fosmids is similar, and significantly higher than the density of repeats on the major
chromosomes from either species. Other analysis techniques
used to assess the difference between the D. virilis and D.
melanogaster sequences, including a TBLASTX comparison
using a RebBase 8.12 library from which invertebrate
sequences had been removed [49,54], and a Repeat Scout
library assembly [51], also showed little difference in the total
amount of repetitive sequence found in the D. virilis and D.
melanogaster dot sequences (not shown). Thus, all of the follow-up techniques applied indicate that the sequences from
the dot chromosomes of both D. virilis and D. melanogaster
are enriched for repetitive sequences compared to the
sequences derived from the major chromosomes of both species. The analysis of each contig as well as the total representation of each type of repeat is presented in Table 2 and in
Figure 6b. The contrast between the results shown in Figure
6a and those shown in Figure 6b illustrates the problem
posed by biased repeat libraries, an issue that must be carefully considered in studies of this type. The observation that
three different analyses (discussed above) support the results

from our sample, 18.6% consists of remnants of DNA transposons, including sequences from 1360 elements, P elements
(artifacts and related fragments), Tc1 elements and DINE-1.

virilis consists of remnants of DNA transposons, about a
three-fold reduction. The bulk of the repetitive sequence in
the D. virilis dot fosmids tentatively classified as DNA transposons are the dvir.16.2 centroid and the dvir.16.17 centroid,
sequences identified in the PILER-DF analysis. Table 3 shows
the repeat element and class of the most common repeats in
the D. virilis and D. melanogaster dot chromosome contigs
studied here, as identified by RepeatMasker/Superlibrary.
DNA transposon families are preferentially represented in D.
melanogaster, while retroelements (LINEs and LTRs) are
more common in D. virilis. Examination of the quantitative
results in Table 2 suggests that the dot chromosome of D. virilis has an increase in retroelements (9.1%) in comparison
with homologous regions of D. melanogaster (4.2%).
However, this difference appears to be due to sample bias, as
RepeatMasker/RebBase 8.12 classifies 8.7% of the whole D.
melanogaster dot chromosome as retroelements.
DINE-1, also known as DNAREP-1 or INE-1, is a repetitive
element that is very common in the genome of D. melanogaster [55]. The density of DINE-1 elements is especially
high on the dot chromosome of D. melanogaster, more so
than on the major chromosome arms or on the dot chromosome of D. virilis [17,56]. Using our Superlibrary and repeat

identification process, RepeatMasker identifies 0.1% of the D.
virilis contigs as sequences with significant similarity to
DINE-1 elements, while in the homologous regions of the D.
melanogaster dot the density is 10.5%. (The entire D. melanogaster dot has a 9.2% incidence of DINE-1 elements,
assessed using RepeatMasker/Superlibrary.) There has been
considerable debate as to the origin of DINE-1 elements
[56,57]. Kapitonov and Jurka [57] have recently suggested
that DINE-1 is a retrotransposon based on homology to a D.
virilis Penelope GenBank accession, but sequences with
homology to DINE-1 in this accession fall outside of the
canonical Penelope sequence [58] (C Bergman, personal
communication). Analysis of DINE-1 elements in D. yakuba
suggests a relatively recent burst of transposition in that species. A consensus sequence based on these recent DINE-1 elements contains no long terminal repeats nor a poly-A tail
(suggestive of a retroelement), but does have a terminal 12 bp
perfect repeat, a characteristic of transposons [53]. Thus,
while we have provided separate statistics for this class, we
consider DINE-1 elements to be DNA transposon remnants.
Separate statistics are also provided in Table 2 for the 1360
DNA transposon fragments, as this class is of particular interest as a potential target for heterochromatin formation, as
discussed above. Again, this family is significantly enriched in

the dot chromosomes (see above). Thus, the heterochromatic
D. melanogaster and the euchromatic D. virilis dot chromosomes are very similar to each other in gene density, percent
DNA transcribed, and gene/intron size, suggesting that these
parameters are not critical in determining chromatin packaging decisions.

While one of the conspicuous characteristics of pericentric
heterochromatin is a low gene density, previous sequence
analysis has shown that the heterochromatic D. melanogaster dot chromosome resembles euchromatic domains
in this regard, having a gene density (number of genes per
Mb) similar to the long arms of the major autosomes [12,19].
Interestingly, the D. melanogaster dot chromosome does
have an approximately two-fold higher percentage of DNA
transcribed (percentage of DNA between the start sites and
stop sites for transcription) than the major chromosomes,
due primarily to longer introns in the dot chromosome genes.
Introns of dot chromosome genes of both species examined
here were longer than introns from the major chromosomes
(Figure 5), apparently reflecting the higher repeat content of

The dot chromosomes of D. melanogaster and D. virilis
differ in the density of DNA transposons

This analysis rather focuses attention on the high level of
DNA transposons found in the D. melanogaster dot chromosome, but lacking in the D. virilis dot chromosome. Prominent elements of this type in D. melanogaster include 1360
(aka hoppel or PROTOP_A) and DINE-1. It has previously
been suggested that DINE-1 might contribute to
heterochromatin packaging on the dot chromosome of D.
melanogaster [17,56]. In our computational analysis, we
found that sequences homologous to DINE-1 were also
present on the dot chromosome of D. virilis, but at a much
lower concentration (0.1%) compared to D. melanogaster
(10.5%), in agreement with the in situ hybridization analysis
previously reported [56]. Our computer homology searches
and analysis by others [57] indicates that portions of the
DINE-1 element found in RebBase 8.12 show high similarity
to a genomic fragment containing Penelope elements from D.
virilis, but this similarity falls outside of the region defined by
Evgen'ev et al. to be required for Penelope activity [53,58] (C
Bergman, personal communication). Thus, in our analysis,
DINE-1 has been treated as a DNA transposon type, but has
been reported separately in Figure 6 for clarity. DINE-1 is
absent from the major chromosome arms in this sample. In

Discussion

Total repeat density (percentage of the DNA in repetitive
sequences) for the D. virilis dot chromosome fosmids has a
value of 22.8%, while the homologous regions of the dot chromosome of D. melanogaster have a total density of 26.5%.
Kaminker et al. [18] analyzed the distribution of transposable
elements (not including simple or tandem repeats) in the D.
melanogaster genome. This analysis indicated that the
number of repetitive elements per Mb is five to ten times
higher on the dot chromosome than in the rest of the
sequenced genome, which includes very little heterochromatin. The repeat analysis of our region of study agrees with the
whole chromosome results from Kaminker et al. [18] in that
the level of repetitive elements (predominantly partial or
dead TEs) shows a large difference (about three- to four-fold)
between the dot chromosomes and the major chromosomes.
Our analysis reported here shows that there is only a small
difference in the total repeat density on the heterochromatic
D. melanogaster dot chromosome and on the euchromatic D.
virilis dot chromosome. This finding suggests that the higher
density of repetitive elements probably does not play a deciding role in driving the heterochromatic packaging of the dot
chromosome in D. melanogaster. This does not preclude the
possibility that high repeat densities are a necessary precondition for heterochromatin formation, but argues that a high
repeat density is not sufficient in and of itself to drive formation of heterochromatin.

reports

Comparing Figures 6a and 6b, it is apparent that the two
repeat-finding strategies represented gave very different
results. D. melanogaster and D. virilis are fairly close
together phylogenetically, but use of the previously defined
RepBase library, which has good representation of D. melanogaster repeats, was insufficient to find all of the D. virilis
repeats, particularly on the dot chromosome. This result
stresses the importance of using techniques such as PILER to
find species-specific repeats as new species are sequenced,
even when repeat sequences are available from a well-studied
nearby species. Relying on existing repeat databases can lead
to erroneously low estimates of repeat content.

reviews

Transposable elements are much more prevalent in the
introns of heterochromatic genes than in the introns of
euchromatic genes [4]; this may contribute to the evolution
and structure of genes in heterochromatin. Maintaining a
focus on total repeat density (and not repeat type), we analyzed the introns of all of the contigs with a repeat database
generated by combining the RepeatScout output from both
the D. melanogaster and the D. virilis whole genome assemblies. Using RepeatMasker with this library (omitting low
complexity and simple repeats), one finds that introns of the
D. virilis dot chromosome genes studied here contain 27.0%
repetitive elements, while in homologous regions of the D.
melanogaster dot, 33.1 % of the introns are made up of repetitive elements. Analysis of the contigs from the major chromosomes of D. virilis and the homologous regions from D.
melanogaster did not find any recognizable transposable elements in the introns. Thus the two dot chromosomes are in
this respect more similar to each other than they are to the
major chromosomes from either species.

contrast, Penelope elements are very common in the dot
chromosome (approximately 9%), and are present in the
major chromosomes of D. virilis (0.4%). Retrotransposons
such as Penelope are important in determining chromosome
rearrangements [59], but have not been associated with heterochromatin formation.
It has been suggested that the buildup of repetitive elements
on the dot chromosome may be due in part to the lack of
recombination [19,60]. However, we find an overabundance
of repetitive sequences on the dot chromosomes of both D.
melanogaster and D. virilis. Recombination does occur on
the dot chromosome of D. virilis, albeit at a lower rate [30].
This observation suggests that there may be a selective advantage in maintaining a higher than average density of repetitive
sequences (and larger than average genes) in this small chromosome, regardless of the chromatin packaging status.

DNA transposons may be targets for heterochromatin
formation
Work by Sun et al. [24] suggests a particular DNA transposon
that may act as an initiator of heterochromatin formation on
the dot chromosome of D. melanogaster. If a white reporter
P element insertion site is within 10 kb of a 1360 element on
the dot chromosome, there is a high probability of a
variegating phenotype [24]. Hence remnants of this DNA
transposon may serve as a cis-acting determinant of heterochromatin formation on the dot chromosome of D. melanogaster, presumably acting as targets of an RNAi-directed
process [26] analogous to that reported in S. pombe [1].
1360 elements are fragments of a DNA transposon that has
been recognized in many studies to have a high concentration
on the dot chromosome and in the pericentric heterochromatin [17,19]. Coelho et al. [60] studied 1360 in many different
strains of D. melanogaster and found that the association
with heterochromatin is very consistent, again suggesting
that 1360 elements play an important role in the structure
and function of heterochromatin. Given a lack of introns, it
has been suggested that 1360 elements are derivatives of a
retrotranscription event [61], but because this element has
terminal inverted repeats at its ends and encodes a transposase with similarity to the P enzyme [57,61], it is likely to
function as a DNA transposon. 1360 may be a very recent
invader of the D. melanogaster genome [57]; some differences in insertion sites are observed in different stocks of D.
melanogaster [24,60]. The origin of RNAi is thought to be as
a silencing mechanism for retroviral genome invaders or
transposons with multiple exact copies. Thus, it is possible
that recent invaders are most likely to be targets of RNAiinduced heterochromatin formation.
Some regions of the D. melanogaster dot chromosome have
significantly lower density of DNA transposons other than
DINE-1 than the chromosome as a whole, particularly contigs
30.1, 106, and 67 (Table 2). The density of DINE-1 elements

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/2/R15

in these contigs is similar to that in the rest of the dot chromosome, but the level of other DNA transposons is less than 2%.
Interestingly, these regions appear to be euchromatic
domains of the dot chromosome of D. melanogaster as shown
by a white reporter. The region around contig 30.1 is within
25 kb of an insertion site for a P element with full red eye
expression, and the region around contig 67 is within 20 kb of
six P elements with full red eye expression [24]. This suggests
that the local density of repetitive elements other than DINE1 may be important in driving changes in chromatin structure, or that another factor might be countering the influence
of DINE-1 in these regions.
Why might DNA transposons be a preferred target for heterochromatin formation? DNA transposons contain inverted
repeats at each end that facilitate their mobilization within
the genome; these could intrinsically lead to dsRNA if both
ends are transcribed. This has been reported in C. elegans
[62], but we are not aware of any similar reports for D. melanogaster. Using a P element reporter, Dorer and Henikoff
[63] showed that DNA transposon mobilization events can
lead to tandem and inverse duplications of the P element.
These tandem arrays can lead to heterochromatin formation
and silencing of a reporter gene within the P element construct. It is also possible that an endogenous transposable element could be present as inverted copies in an intron;
transcription could then produce hairpins that could be targeted by the RNAi machinery for degradation and result in
heterochromatin-mediated transcriptional gene silencing.
(Fragments of LINE elements in inverted orientations in the
introns of mammalian genes have been found to be a source
of miRNAs [64].) Thus, the mode of mobilization might generate configurations of DNA transposon sequence that make
these elements a preferred target for RNAi-directed gene
silencing and heterochromatin formation.
Our computational analysis has shown that inverted fragments of TEs can readily be found in introns in both species.
Screening for inverted repeats (IRs; using RepeatMasker/
RebBase 8.12) located within a single intron and within 100
bp of each other revealed 87 copies of inverted TEs (81 DINE1, 2 1360 elements, 4 S2_DM elements) within the D. melanogaster genome and three (all Penelope) within our D. virilis fosmids. Some of these candidates are predicted to form
stable hairpin structures by mfold [65]. Among these hairpin
candidates are the 1360 IR found in an intron of Caps on the
D. melanogaster dot chromosome, and the Penelope IR
found in an intron of toy on the D. virilis dot chromosome.
Transcription through these loci could create hairpin structures that might be subsequently processed by the Drosha
and Dicer machinery to produce short dsRNA, leading to initiation of heterochromatin formation. Hence the potential
exists for both DNA transposons and retroelements to act as
targets for RNAi-directed gene silencing and heterochromatin formation; why the former appears to be favored is not
clear.

Genome Biology 2006,

Empirically, the absence of heterochromatin formation on
the D. virilis dot chromosome appears not to be related to a
lower density of repetitive elements in this genomic domain,
but may be a consequence of the low density of DNA tranposons. Gene density, percent DNA transcribed, and size of
introns do not seem to be critical discriminatory factors.
However, a higher frequency of CA/GT repeats on the D. virilis dot chromosome is associated with euchromatic chromatin packaging. No mechanism has been suggested to explain
the significance of this correlation. Other differences in primary sequence and density of particular transposable elements between the dot chromosomes of these two species, as
yet unidentified, could also play a role. Genomic data is forthcoming on many Drosophila species [52]. A comparison of
several heterochromatic dot chromosomes with several
euchromatic dot chromosomes will no doubt further elucidate the basis of heterochromatin formation in Drosophila.

information

Gene sequences were initially identified by similarity in
BLASTALL [48], comparing finished D. virilis fosmids to D.
melanogaster protein, EST, cDNA and genomic sequences in
GenBank. D. virilis fosmids were also compared to D. pseudoobscura genomic sequence [40] using BLASTN and
TBLASTN [72]. Intron-exon boundaries were determined by
visual inspection of coding matches, aided by Genscan
[73,74], in conjunction with other annotated features. BLAT
[75] was also used in this process, comparing intron-exon
boundaries of predicted coding sequence across D. melanogaster, D. yakuba and D. pseudoobscura. Known protein-

interactions

Coding sequences from all genes from the dot chromosome of
D. melanogaster were used in BLASTN [48] searches against
the D. pseudoobscura NCBI trace archive [40]. Similar
regions were entered into Block Maker [67] to find regions of
highest conservation; PCR primers were designed around
these regions using CODEHOP [68]. Criteria for inclusion
were a length of at least 200 bp, with 80% homology between
D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura, with screening to
the D. melanogaster genome to ensure that the region did not
contain any repetitive elements. PCR was performed using D.
melanogaster genomic DNA as the template; the PCR products were subsequently labeled and used to probe the
BDVIF01 library (of Tucson strain 15010-1001.10) originally
described in Bergman et al. [36], now available spotted on a
single filter from BACPAC [69]. Hybridizations and washes
were performed at low stringency. Positive clones were verified using Southern blots, slot blots, and restriction mapping.
Some of the recovered clones mapped to chromosomes other
than the D. virilis dot; these appear to have been identified by
cross hybridization resulting from low stringency hybridization and washing conditions.

D. virilis fosmid DNA was prepared by streaking the glycerol
stocks onto selective media agar plates, picking three isolated
colonies and preparing a mini-prep of DNA from each. Miniprep DNA was digested using HindIII and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to compare restriction patterns to
those obtained initially from the clones. Colonies verified by
the restriction pattern were then inoculated into 200 ml of
liquid media and grown in culture. Large-scale fosmid DNA
isolation was performed from these cultures. The DNA was
then sheared with the Hydroshear™ (manufactured by
Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) to a nominal size
range of 3 to 4 kb, end-repaired, and separated on an agarose
sizing gel. The 3 to 4 kb band was excised from the gel and
purified by phenol:chloroform extraction. The sheared insert
DNA was subcloned into pZero2.1 (Invitrogen, Frederick,
MD, USA), electroporated into DH10B cells, and the cells
plated onto solid media. For each fosmid project, 768 subclones were picked into glycerol-containing media and
archive stocks were grown for 24 hours at 37°C. Of these, 384
subclones were processed through the Genome Sequencing
Center production sequencing pipeline, including magnetic
bead-based DNA purification, dual end sequencing with Big
Dye version 3.1 terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems
Inc., Foster City, CA, USA), and analysis on ABI 3730xl
sequencers. Sequence assembly was performed using phred,
phrap, and consed to design finishing strategies [42,43]. All
fosmids were finished to the same quality standard as used
for the human genome [71]. Sequences were confirmed by
comparison of in silico digests of the finished sequence to
restriction digest patterns of the purified fosmid DNA for at
least two separate restriction enzymes. The nucleotide
sequences and predicted protein sequences reported here
have been submitted to GenBank (accession numbers
DQ378280-DQ378293).

coding sequences, exon boundaries and intron sizes were
obtained from Ensembl [76] and Flybase [13,77].
D. virilis retroelements, DNA transposons, low-complexity
and simple repeat sequences were masked by RepeatMasker
[45] using default parameters for Drosophila sequences. The
RepeatMasker version used was from 03/06/04 with crossmatch version 0.990329 (RebBase update 8.12). Repeats
unique to the D. virilis fosmids were predicted by BLASTN of
each fosmid against a database of all the D. virilis sequences
obtained, excluding regions that had significant D. melanogaster EST and protein BLASTALL matches.
The Superlibrary was created by combining repeats identified
by the Drosophila TE library in RepBase 8.12, novel repeats
identified using PILER-DF on the D. virilis dvirAra08 assembly [78] (C Smith and G Karpen, personal communication),
novel D. melanogaster repeats identified using PILER-TR
[50] and the D. yakuba DINE-1 element [53]. RepeatMasker
was used with the Superlibrary to identify the portion of each
fosmid or equivalent region that contained repetitive
sequences.
RepeatScout (1.0.1) [51] was run with default parameters
against the dmelWGS2 and dvirAra08 assemblies to generate
the RepeatScout libraries for D. melanogaster and D. virilis.
Tandem repeats and simple repeats in each RepeatScout
library were removed using trf [79,80] and nseg [81,82]. The
results were then combined to create a custom Drosophila
RepeatScout library.

Sequence comparison
Sequence comparisons were made of D. virilis fosmids with
corresponding regions from the D. melanogaster (Release
3.2) genome, as determined by a set of reproducible guidelines involving syntenic features and equivalent flanking
sequence. If a region of non-coding sequence from D. virilis
was interrupted in the corresponding D. melanogaster
sequence by an annotated gene, then only sequence up to that
gene was included in the comparison. Where non-coding
sequence flanked a corresponding gene in D. melanogaster,
with no other identifying features that would indicate a loss of
synteny, the extracted sequence extended an equal number of
bases from the gene as seen in D. virilis. Several of the D. virilis fosmids (contigs 11, 72, 80, and 91) had no appreciable
synteny with the D. melanogaster genome and were, therefore, not included in repeat comparisons between the two
species. The gene density and intron size calculations take
into account all fosmids.

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
The KS test is a non-parametric, distribution-free statistical
test that can determine if two datasets differ significantly. It
produces a D statistic that represents the maximum difference of the two distributions in an empirical cumulative distribution plot, allowing one to accept or reject a hypothesis

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/2/R15

that the datasets are from the same distribution. Statistical
analysis was done using program R from the R Foundation
for Statistical Computing [83].

CA/GT repeat analysis
BLASTN [48] was used to search the contigs for CA/GT
repeats. Blast databases containing either all of the D. virilis
sequence obtained here or all of the corresponding regions
from D. melanogaster were constructed using formatdb with
default parameters. The databases were searched with a
sequence of 100 (CA) repeats using BLASTALL default
parameters except that low complexity filtering was turned
off and the (E)xpect value was set to 0.1. The location of all
hits was analyzed to remove any duplicate hits prior to assignment to either the dot or major chromosomes.
