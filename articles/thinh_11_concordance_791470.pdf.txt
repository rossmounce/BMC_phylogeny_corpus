Concordance between vocal and genetic diversity
in crested gibbons
Van Ngoc Thinh1, Chris Hallam2, Christian Roos1,3, Kurt Hammerschmidt4*

Abstract
Background: Gibbons or small apes are, next to great apes, our closest living relatives, and form the most diverse
group of contemporary hominoids. A characteristic trait of gibbons is their species-specific song structure, which,
however, exhibits a certain amount of inter- and intra-individual variation. Although differences in gibbon song
structure are routinely applied as taxonomic tool to identify subspecies and species, it remains unclear to which
degree acoustic and phylogenetic differences are correlated. To trace this issue, we comparatively analyse song
recordings and mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequence data from 22 gibbon populations representing six of
the seven crested gibbon species (genus Nomascus). In addition, we address whether song similarity and
geographic distribution can support a recent hypothesis about the biogeographic history of crested gibbons.
Results: The acoustic analysis of 92 gibbon duets confirms the hypothesised concordance between song structure
and phylogeny. Based on features of male and female songs, we can not only distinguish between N. nasutus,
N. concolor and the four southern species (N. leucogenys, N. siki, N. annamensis, N. gabriellae), but also between the
latter by applying more detailed analysis. In addition to the significant correlation between song structure and
genetic similarity, we find a similar high correlation between song similarity and geographic distance.
Conclusions: The results show that the structure of crested gibbon songs is not only a reliable tool to verify
phylogenetic relatedness, but also to unravel geographic origins. As vocal production in other nonhuman primate
species appears to be evolutionarily based, it is likely that loud calls produced by other species can serve as
characters to elucidate phylogenetic relationships.

Background
A striking feature of gibbon songs is the fact that they are
species-specific and evolutionarily based. Hence, gibbon
songs became a promising tool to identify the taxon affiliation and to describe evolutionary relationships among taxa
[1-8]. However, it is also known that gibbon songs are not
totally fixed and that they show a certain amount of interand a not well-described intra-individual variation [9-12].
Therefore, it remains unclear to what degree acoustic features can be used as taxonomic characters, especially
when only subtle differences between populations or taxa
are observed. For this, it would be necessary to conduct a
systematic comparison of neighbouring populations across
different taxa.

In most gibbon species, both males and females sing
together [5,13-15], while in a few species males make
solo songs in addition to the duets. Until now only two
species, the Kloss’s gibbon (Hylobates klossii) and the
silvery gibbon (H. moloch), are known where females
and males produce solely solo songs [4,6,16,17]. The
structure of gibbon songs shows a clear adaptation to
improved long-distance transmission. The energy is concentrated in single frequency bands. The frequency of
their call elements exhibits only slow modulations and
the frequency range of their song syllable lies in an optimized transmission range [18]. With these features,
gibbon songs differ from all vocalisations of other nonhuman primates, resembling more songs of typical rainforest birds. It is notable that they are also similar in
their proposed functions, like territory advertisement,
mate attraction, and strengthening pair bonds [19-25].
Crested gibbons, genus Nomascus, occur only in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and parts of southern China

(Figure 1). Adults show a strong sexual dichromatism
with orange or yellow coloured females, and black males,
which in some taxa have light cheeks. The crown hair in
males is erect, which gives them their common name
“crested gibbons”. According to recent investigations

Page 2 of 9

using acoustic, genetic and morphological data, seven
species of crested gibbons are recognized [8,26-30].
These include the Hainan gibbon (N. hainanus), the eastern black gibbon (N. nasutus), the western black gibbon
(N. concolor), the northern white-cheeked gibbon

(N. leucogenys), the southern white-cheeked gibbon
(N. siki), the northern buff-cheeked gibbon (N. annamensis) and the southern buff-cheeked gibbon (N. gabriellae).
N. hainanus and N. nasutus form a clade and are basal
among crested gibbons. Among the remaining species,
N. concolor branched off first, before finally N. leucogenys/N. siki and N. annamensis/N. gabriellae diverged
[28-30] (Figure 2A).
In this study, we aim to elucidate whether differences
in song structure of six crested gibbon species and especially of the four closely related species, N. leucogenys,
N. siki, N. annamensis and N. gabriellae, are persistent
enough to be regarded as phylogenetic trait. Therefore,
we recorded more than 400 male and female songs
from 92 groups at 24 locations in Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia, and compared the extracted vocal features
with gibbon mitochondrial cytochrome b gene
sequences from 22 of the 24 populations [29]. Further,
we want to describe the relatedness between geographic
origin and song similarity as well as genetic distance.
We hypothesize that beyond intra- and inter-individual
variation, song structure can be used to distinguish
between populations and species, and that geographic
distance between populations is highly correlated with
their song structure.

Results
General differences in song structure of crested gibbons

N. nasutus and N. concolor could be clearly identified by
general acoustic characteristics of their songs (Figure 3,
Additional File 1). In contrast, N. leucogenys, N. siki,
N. annamensis and N. gabriellae had very similar song
structures and only minor differences could be observed
among them (Figure 3).
N. nasutus females produced fast up-down sweeps like
a spiral spring with a vibrato sound on first two notes.
Males produced staccato sounds during, before and
after their multi-modulated phrases. All male notes
started with almost unmodulated frequency, followed by
a down sweep and a fast up sweep. Males of N. concolor
produced their multi-modulated phrase immediately
after the climax of the female great call. The first note
of the male call had slightly ascending structure, followed by notes with fast down-up modulation (Figure 3,
Additional File 1). Males of N. leucogenys gave regularly,
loud staccato sounds, which appeared rarely in N. siki
and N. annamensis, and were nearly absent in N. gabriellae. N. leucogenys could be distinguished from the
three southern species by their great calls, which had a
longer duration and a faster frequency modulation.
Accordingly, only population 4 could be assigned to

were more similar in their song structure to N. leucogenys than to N. annamensis populations (13-20). The

main criteria to distinguish N. siki and N. annamensis
songs were criteria 2 and 4 (Additional File 1). In contrast, we found higher similarities between N. annamensis populations and N. gabriellae (21-24). Here the main
criteria were 3 and 5 (Additional File 1).

Acoustic discrimination of the four southern crested
gibbon species

As mentioned above, N. nasutus and N. concolor could
be clearly distinguished from each other and the four
southern species, N. leucogenys, N. siki, N. annamensis
and N. gabriellae, by general acoustic characteristics,
while for latter four species no obvious criteria were
found to discriminate among them. Similar results were
detected in a first stepwise Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) (Figure 2B). Accordingly, N. nasutus, N. concolor and the four southern species formed three clearly
differentiated clusters with an assignment of populations
to respective clusters of 100%. To discriminate among
the four southern species, we performed a second DFA
(Figure 4) in which 85.2% of the 81 recorded groups
were assigned to its correct species. The assignment
accuracy ranged from 50% for population 16, 60% for
populations 10 and 17, 75% for populations 14 and 18,
80% for population 13, 90% for population 6, and 100%
for the remaining 14 populations. The cross-validation
achieved a classification result of 55.6%. The decline in
the cross validation is mainly caused by the fact that

Page 5 of 9

from some populations we have recordings of only one
or two groups. Nevertheless, 55.6% is highly significant
above the change level of 4.75%.
The stepwise DFA needed 14 out of the 53 acoustic
parameters to achieve this classification result. The
DFA included acoustic parameters of both sexes, six
parameters of the multi-modulated male call (parameters: 1, 11, 14, 19, 23, 28) and eight parameters of
the female great call (parameters: 31, 33, 34, 40, 41,
43, 47, 50; for description see Additional File 2). The
scattergram (Figure 4) showed the separation of the 21
populations according to the first and second discriminant function, explaining 54.3% and 12.8% of variation,
respectively. The first discriminant function, which
mainly represents frequency characteristics of gibbon
songs, separated populations 4-12 from populations
13-24. The second discriminant function, which represents temporal features of gibbon songs, separated
populations 21-24 from all other populations. Already
the first two functions achieved a good separation of
the four species with the exception of one group in
population 10, which was assigned to N. leucogenys
instead of to N. siki.
We conducted hierarchical cluster analysis (CA) to
verify the results of the DFA and to test whether a CA
would come up with the same number of expected categories (i.e., species). Based on the acoustic song structure, the CA algorithm revealed a high concordance
between the four species (Additional File 3). In total, the
CA could correctly classify 68 out of 81 groups (84%).
In the first cluster, N. siki groups clustered together
with groups of N. leucogenys (6, 9-14) interspersed by
two N. annamensis groups (33, 34). The second and
third cluster comprised only of N. leucogenys and N.
gabriellae groups, respectively. The fourth cluster comprised of N. annamensis groups interspersed by three N.
gabriellae groups (72, 76, 77).
Correlation between vocal structure, genetic and
geographic distance

Among the 21 populations of the four closely related
species, N. leucogenys, N. siki, N. annamensis and
N. gabriellae, we found a significant correlation between
similarity in vocal structure of gibbon songs and geographic distance (Table 1, Additional File 3). A similarly

significant correlation was also detected between genetic
diversity and geographic distance. To test the concordance between genetic diversity and similarity in song
structure, we performed comparisons on species and
population level. For the comparison among the four
species, a significant positive correlation was observed.
Also the comparison of the 19 populations, for which
both genetic and acoustic data were available, revealed a
significant correlation coefficient.

Discussion
Acoustic analysis could confirm the concordance
between song structure and phylogenetic relationships
as obtained from mitochondrial sequence data. We
found significant differences between the songs of
N. nasutus, N. concolor and the four southern species,
N. leucogenys, N. siki, N. annamensis and N. gabriellae.
Although latter four species revealed only subtle differences in their songs, a detailed acoustic analysis was
able to discriminate significantly between them. This
relation was positively correlated with their genetic
relatedness found by recent molecular studies [27-32].
In addition, we found a highly significant correlation
between similarity in song structure and geographic
distance.
Since the early study of Marshall and Marshall [16],
we know that gibbon songs are an important trait of
their taxonomic relationship [8,10,33]. In many cases,
species could be distinguished by directly inspecting
the spectrograms of their songs (see Figure 3). However, as can be seen in the same figure, closer related
taxa can have very similar song structures. Although
there are some studies on individual variation in gibbon songs [9,11], there is no systematic study available
to confirm whether individual variation or variation at
group level is high enough to contradict a possible
relation between song structure and genetic relatedness
among closely related species. One reason for this lack
of information could be the fact that the comparison
of single neighbouring groups revealed unambiguous
results. The few misclassifications in our study
occurred only between neighbouring groups, whereas
groups living far away from each other followed the
rule, larger distance dissimilar song structure. It
remains undecided whether these misclassifications
between neighbouring groups in gibbons have a similar
reason as in song birds. In many song bird species,
neighbouring males tend to emphasis difference in
their vocal repertoire [34]. Song birds seem to use this
principle of increased contrast as a tool to settle territory boundaries. However, song birds must learn their
songs [35], whereas gibbons have a predominantly
innate song structure. Therefore, their ability to produce more distinct songs in relation to their direct

Page 6 of 9

group neighbours should be limited. However, we do
not know whether gibbons even follow such a rule.
The dispersal pattern of males and females could be
also an explanation for the misclassification between
neighbouring groups. If neighbouring groups are
genetically dissimilar then they should also differ in
their acoustic structure. Again, we have no precise
knowledge about the dispersal patterns of crested gibbons, although at least in a related species, the siamangs, females seem to disperse over longer distances
than males [36]. A last possibility is that the misclassification between neighbours is mainly due to the fact
that songs of neighbouring groups are too similar and
therefore cannot reliably be assigned to the correct
group. However, the high significant relation between
acoustic similarity, geographic distance and genetic
relatedness showed that crested gibbon songs are a
salient feature of their genetic relatedness. Accordingly,
song structure is a promising tool to identify the
taxon-affiliation of gibbon individuals or populations.
This is of great importance, because samples from
free-ranging gibbons for genetic analyses are difficult
to be obtained and fur colouration, especially of female
crested gibbons, is due to its extreme intra-taxon
variability unreliable [5].
There are not many possibilities to explain our second
finding, the high correlation between acoustic structure
and geographic distance. The structure of animal vocalisations is under different selective forces, such as body
size, habitat characteristic or different functions [37].
However, gibbons are limited to forest habitats and the
functions of their songs make it necessary to broadcast
them over larger distances. Selection pressure forces
under such closed habitat conditions an optimal adaptation of song structure (recently reviewed in [38]). Therefore, the influence of other factors is very limited and
gene flow must have achieved the major influence on
the structural variation in gibbon songs.
From our acoustic result we cannot conclude the origin of crested gibbons, because we have no evidence,
which song structure is most ancestral. However, we
found the largest differences in the song structure
between the most northern and most southern species
with successive gradation between them. This fits very
well with the proposed hypothesis that the genus originated in the north and successively migrated to the
south [28-30] (Figure 2A).

Conclusions
In this study, we have shown that in crested gibbons,
vocal diversity correlates with genetic relatedness and
geographic distance. Accordingly, acoustic analyses provide a reliable tool to support taxon-affiliation and to
settle distributional ranges. Furthermore, the acoustic

Thinh et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:36
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/36

analysis is able to support proposed migration backgrounds. Because other nonhuman primate species have
similar constraints in vocal production, it is likely that
also in other primate species, loud calls can function as
valuable tool to explain taxonomic relations and migration backgrounds.

Methods
Survey locations and data collection

In 2007 and 2008, we conducted field surveys in 24 protected areas in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia (Figure 1,
Additional File 4), and recorded songs from N. nasutus,
N. concolor, N. leucogenys, N. siki, N. annamensis and N.
gabriellae. Recordings in the range of N. hainanus were
not conducted, but the species clearly differs in song
structure from all others [5,6]. Vocalisations were
recorded in the early morning using a “listening post”
approach based on described methods [39]. When hearing calls, the time and direction was recorded with compass bearings on angle. With this information, it was
possible to distinguish calls from different groups.
Group positions were depicted on a map (1/50000) to
enable changes in listening posts and to ensure the best
coverage in obtaining different groups in the observation
area. When doubtful whether the same or a nearby
group was recorded, the data were excluded from
further analysis. We used only 92 out of 175 recordings.
In total, we analysed 440 great calls and 447 male calls
from 92 different gibbon groups at 24 locations. To
record songs, a digital solid state recorder MARANTZ
PMD 660; (Marantz, Japan; sampling rate: 44.1 kHz, 16
bit amplitude resolution) and a Sennheiser directional
microphone (K6 power module and ME66 recording
head with MZW66 pro windscreen; Sennheiser, Wedemark, Germany) was used. Research complied with protocols approved by the National Forest Protection
Department of Vietnam, the Cambodian Forestry
Administration and the Lao Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry, and adhered to the legal requirements of the
countries in which research was conducted. The study
was carried out in compliance with respective animal
care regulations and the principles of the American
Society of Primatologists for the ethical treatment of
nonhuman primates.

describe the general differences in song structure are
listed in Additional File 1.
We used AVISOFT SASLAB Pro (R. Specht, Berlin,
Germany) to generate spectrograms and to calculate
acoustic parameters. To find the point with maximum
energy at the beginning, ending and anchor points of
notes in the frequency spectrum, we used the free reticule cursor tools of AVISOFT (frequency range: up to
500 kHz, frequency resolution: app. 8 Hz, time resolution: 16 ms). In total, we calculated 53 acoustic parameters describing the temporal and frequency structure
of male and female gibbon phrases. A detailed description how we measured the acoustic parameters are
given in Figure 5. A list with detailed description of the
53 acoustic parameters is given in Additional File 2.
Statistical analysis

We conducted two DFAs to statistically verify the observations as obtained from the general acoustic descriptions for the six analysed species and to test whether
the four southern species, which are not separable
by the general acoustic description, can be assigned
correctly by the calculated acoustic parameters.

Acoustic analysis

Crested gibbon songs consist of phrases from both
sexes. Males produce three different phrases including
boom, staccato and multi-modulated phrases, and
females so-called great call phrases only (Figure 3). For
the analysis we considered male phrases as fully developed if they consisted of two or more notes. Female
phrases were considered as fully developed if they consisted of six or more notes. The criteria we used to

We calculated mean values per group using 440 great
calls and 447 multi-modulated male calls (population
numbers 1-24, see Figure 1, Additional File 4). For the
second DFA, including only the four southern species,
we used group mean values from 410 great calls and
395 multi-modulated male calls. We analysed a total of
81 different groups from 21 populations (population
numbers 4-24, Figure 1, Additional File 4). We standardized the acoustic parameters and conducted all 53
parameters to a stepwise DFA in SPSS 13 [40]. The
selection criterion for an acoustic parameter to be
entered was p = 0.05 and p = 0.1 to be removed from
the analysis. The assignment of songs to the different
populations was cross-validated by the leaving-one-out
method [39], which involves leaving out each of the
cases in turn, calculating the functions based on the
remaining n-1 cases and then classifying the left-out
case. In addition, we carried out a CA in SPSS to evaluate the similarity in the acoustic structure of the 81
groups. We calculated the z-score variables of the 14
acoustic parameters selected by the stepwise DFA. As
distance measure we used the Euclidean distance and
cluster method ‘between groups linkage’.
To test the statistical relationship between acoustic
structure, and genetic and geographic distance matrices,
we used a Mantel test as implemented in GenAlex [41].
The vocal distance matrices for the four closely related
species, N. leucogenys, N. siki, N. annamensis and
N. gabriellae, were generated using the F values of pairwise distances in the stepwise DFA. The geographic distance matrices were calculated from the minimum
distance of different groups between the 21 populations.
Geographic coordinates were obtained via GPS. Genetic
distances were generated using pairwise population F
values between haplotypes of mitochondrial cytochrome
b gene sequences by the distance function in GenAlex.
Respective haplotypes were recently published by our
group [28,29] (GenBank: GU595000-GU595004 [N. leucogenys], GU321270, GU595005-GU595008 [N. siki],
GU595009-GU595015 [N. annamensis], and GU595017GU595022 [N. gabriellae]).
