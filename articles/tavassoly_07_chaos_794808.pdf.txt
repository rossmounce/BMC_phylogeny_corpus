Chaos Game Representation (CGR) is an iterative mapping method which can convert a nucleotide sequence to
a unique and scale-independent image. There are some
studies indicating different applications of CGR images of
nucleotide sequences but there is still limited information
on their possible application in phylogenetics. In this
study we have tried to have an evolutionary evaluation of
CGR images of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in different
species using different image processing tools. In this
study the algorithm of chaos game for four points as four
bases in nucleotide sequences were coded in Matlab 7.0
language licensed by the Mathworks Inc. http://
www.mathworks.com. We produced CGR images of complete mtDNA genomes of 15 species. We used different
methods of image processing for comparing these images
in different species. Our results showed that there is some
evolutionary information in CGR images of mtDNA. In
CGR images of a DNA sequence both global and local patterns are displayed. These images allow us to investigate
patterns in the sequence and help our eye to recognize
hidden structures. Our results indicated that CGR images
of mtDNA may be useful tools in phylogenetic studies
although we need more studies to build a hypothesis
about possible applications of these images in molecular
evolutionary studies.
