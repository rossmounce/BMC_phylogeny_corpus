biohydrogenating ruminal bacterium,
Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens

Background: Health-promoting polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are abundant in forages grazed by ruminants
and in vegetable and fish oils used as dietary supplements, but only a small proportion of PUFA finds its way into
meat and milk, because of biohydrogenation in the rumen. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens plays a major role in this activity.
The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms by which PUFA affect the growth of B. fibrisolvens, how
PUFA are metabolized and the metabolic response to growth in the presence of PUFA.
Results: Linoleic acid (LA; cis-9, cis-12-18:2) and a-linolenic acid (LNA; cis-9, cis-12, cis-15-18:3) increased the lag
phase of B. fibrisolvens JW11, LNA having the greater effect. Growth was initiated only when the PUFA had been
converted to vaccenic acid (VA; trans-11-18:1). The major fish oil fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5(n-3))
and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6(n-3)), were not metabolized and prevented growth. Cellular integrity, as
determined fluorimetrically by propidium iodide (PI) ingression, was affected as much by 18:1 fatty acids, including
VA, as 18:2 fatty acids. The methyl esters of LNA, LA, EPA and DHA had no effect on growth or other
measurements. The ATP pool decreased by 2/3 when LA was added to growing bacteria, whereas most acyl CoA
pools decreased by >96%.
Conclusions: It was concluded that biohydrogenation occurs to enable B. fibrisolvens to survive the bacteriostatic
effects of PUFA, and that the toxicity of PUFA is probably mediated via a metabolic effect rather than disruption of
membrane integrity.

Background
Unsaturated fatty acids, particularly a-linolenic acid
(LNA; cis-9, cis-12, cis-15-18:3) and linoleic acid (LA;
cis-9, cis-12-18:2), are abundant in grass and other
ruminant feedstuffs, yet are present at low concentrations in meat and milk. Furthermore, tissue lipids of
ruminants have been known for a long time to be more
saturated than those of non-ruminants [1]. As the consumption of saturated acids in dairy products and ruminant meats is often associated with an increased
incidence of coronary heart disease in man [2], the
transformation of unsaturated fatty acids to saturated
fatty acids, or biohydrogenation, in ruminants presents
a major human health issue. The biohydrogenation

process has long been known to occur in the rumen as
the result of microbial metabolic activity [3,4]. Thus, if
ruminal biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids can
be controlled, it may be possible to improve the healthiness of ruminant meats and milk by increasing their
unsaturated fatty acids composition in general and the
n-3 fatty acids in particular [5]. One of the unsaturated
fatty acids that appears most desirable is conjugated
linoleic acid (CLA; cis-9, trans-11-18:2) because of its
anticarcinogenic and other health-promoting properties
[6,7]. Major advances have been made in achieving the
desired changes in fatty acid content of meat and milk
experimentally, via dietary manipulation in ruminants,
generally by adding oils containing unsaturated fatty
acids to the diet [5,8-10]. The inclusion of fish oil in
particular seems to alter biohydrogenating activity in
the rumen [11].

Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens was identified many years ago
to undertake biohydrogenation of fatty acids [12] and to
form CLA as intermediate in the process [13]. Kim et
al. [14] noted that LA inhibited growth of B. fibrisolvens
A38, an effect that depended both on the concentration
of LA and the growth status of the bacteria. Growing
bacteria were more tolerant of LA. In a study of CLA
production in different strains of B. fibrisolvens, Fukuda
et al. [15] found that the most tolerant strain had the
highest linoleate isomerase (forming CLA from LA) specific activity. Different members of the Butyrivibrio/
Pseudobutyrivibrio phylogenetic grouping, all of which
biohydrogenate PUFA, had different sensitivities to
growth inhibition by LA, the most sensitive possessing
the butyrate kinase rather than the acyl transferase
mechanism of butyrate production [16]. For reasons
that were unclear, lactate exacerbated the toxicity of LA
to Clostridium proteoclasticum [17], now renamed
Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus [18]. The aim of this work
was to understand the nature of the toxic effects of
PUFA on B. fibrisolvens JW11. Strain JW11 is located in
the middle of the numerous B. fibrisolvens/Pseudobutyrivibrio cluster, members of which share the ability to
form CLA and vaccenic acid (VA; trans-11-18:1) but
which also lack the ability to biohydrogenate VA to
stearic acid (SA; 18:0) [16]. Understanding these effects
could have important indirect implications for human
health by enabling ruminal biohydrogenation of dietary
PUFA to be manipulated in order to provide healthier
ruminant-derived foods.

Results
Fatty acid metabolism by B. fibrisolvens JW11

The metabolism of LA was measured during the growth
cycle of B. fibrisolvens JW11 (Figure 1). No growth
occurred until 10 h, but then growth was initiated and
bacteria grew at a specific growth rate similar to that
found in the absence of added fatty acid (not shown).
During the lag phase, LA was very rapidly converted to
CLA, but growth was not initiated until all the dienoic
acids had been metabolized and converted extensively to
vaccenic acid. No SA was formed.
A longer lag phase was seen with LNA (Figure 2).
LNA was also metabolised rapidly during early lag
phase, being converted firstly to the conjugated cis-9,
trans-11-cis-15-18:3. A little trans-9, trans-11, cis-1518:3 was formed as well. The main dienoic acid formed
transiently was trans-11, cis-15-18:2, which was subsequently converted to VA. Variation in the time taken
for different replicate tubes to escape the lag phase
meant that the average concentration across three tubes
gives a misleading impression. For example, at 32 h,
replicate tubes contained 0.125, 0.140 and 0.193 mg bacterial protein ml -1 , indicating that the culture in the
third tube had begun to grow sooner than the others.
The concentrations of cis-9, trans-11, cis-15-18:3 were
23.0, 21.1 and 0 μg ml-1, respectively, while the concentrations of trans-11, cis-15-18:2 were 0, 0 and 24.5 μg
ml-1. An analysis comparing bacterial protein concentrations and fatty acid concentrations in the same tubes
(not shown) demonstrated that bacterial protein

concentration was low while cis-9, trans-11, cis-15-18:3
and trans-9, trans-11, cis-15-18:3 were present. Higher
bacterial concentrations occurred only when these fatty
acids were removed from individual cultures. High concentrations of VA did not affect growth, while trans-11,
cis-15-18:2 also appeared to permit growth. No SA was
formed in any LNA-containing culture.
Comparative effects of fatty acids and methyl esters on
growth and metabolism by B. fibrisolvens JW11

The effects of various fatty acids and their methyl esters
on the growth of B. fibrisolvens and the biohydrogenation
products in M2 medium were carried out in a similar

way, and are summarized in Table 1. The more unsaturated fatty acids were more toxic, with g-linolenic acid (gLNA; cis-6, cis-9, cis-12-18:3) and the fish oil fatty acids,
DHA and EPA, causing lag phases >72 h. LNA induced a
lag phase of 37 h, longer than that found with LA (P =
0.001), which in turn was longer than that caused by
CLA (P = 0.01). VA and SA had little growth-inhibitory
activity, while oleic acid (OA; cis-9-18:1) caused a short
lag of just under 2 h (P = 0.005). g-LNA was metabolized
to a trienoic acid, which from its elution time in GC was
judged to be conjugated, most likely cis-6, cis-9, trans-1118:3. OA was not metabolised and was slightly toxic.
Neither EPA nor DHA was metabolised. SA did not

cause a lag phase and was not metabolised. No methyl
esters caused a lag phase, yet they were converted to the
same products as the free fatty acids, with the exception
of methyl-g-LNA, which formed a dienoic acid eluting in
the same area as CLA. GC analysis of extracted samples
before they were methylated indicated that the fatty acid
methyl esters had been hydrolysed before the fatty acids
were metabolized.
Influence of fatty acids on cell integrity of
B. fibrisolvens JW11

The influence of different C-18 fatty acids and their
methyl esters on cell integrity was determined using propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence (Figure 3). All

unsaturated fatty acids, including OA and VA, had a
similar effect, although the monoenoic acids tended to
cause less disruption (P = 0.063). The effects of 200 μg
ml-1 fatty acids were only slightly greater than 50 μg ml-1
(P < 0.001). SA gave a small response in comparison with
the unsaturated fatty acids (P < 0.001), and methyl esters
caused only about one-tenth of the disruption of the free
fatty acids (P < 0.001) (Figure 3).
The influence of fatty acids on cell integrity was analysed
further by flow cytometry (Figure 4). All unsaturated fatty
acids transformed the PI signal to one in which the great
majority of cells displayed fluorescence, i.e. the fluorescence response profile moved to the right in the flow display. The unsaturated fatty acids caused apparently greater

disruption than boiling the cells, suggesting that the fatty
acids enhanced access of PI to the bacterial cytoplasm. SA
had no effect, the profile following exactly that of
untreated cells. Differences between the different unsaturated fatty acids were minor. Even in untreated cell suspensions, some fluorescence was observed at the 10 2
region, consistent with about 25% of the bacteria being
non-viable. Very few cells remained unaffected by either
boiling or the fatty acids, judging by the low incidence of
fluorescence at the <101 region of the traces.
The presence of 70 mM sodium lactate in the growth
medium increased the lag phase from 7 to 16 h (not
shown) when LA was present. The influence of LA on PI
fluorescence and growth was also determined in the presence and absence of sodium lactate (Figure 5). As before,
LA increased the fluorescence due to PI (P < 0.001), indicating that cell integrity had been disrupted. Sodium lactate did not alter the response significantly (P > 0.05).
Influence of LA on ATP and acyl CoA pools of
B. fibrisolvens JW11

LA was added to culture that had been mixed with an
equal volume of fresh medium, and the pool sizes of ATP
(Figure 6) and acyl CoA intermediates (Table 2) were measured. Initially, the ATP pools were similar, at about 2
nmol (mg protein)-1. Thereafter, the ATP pool remained
similar in the LA culture, while the concentration increased
3-4-fold (P < 0.05 from 40 min onwards) in cultures to
which no LA was added. The acyl CoA pools were measured only after 20 min, at which time the ATP pool had
not yet changed significantly (P > 0.05). In control cultures,
the highest pool sizes of short-chain acyl CoAs were of
acetyl CoA and butyryl CoA, followed by propionyl CoA.

Crotonyl CoA and acetoacetyl CoA were present at much
lower concentrations, 10 pmol (mg protein)-1 or less. bHydroxybutyryl CoA was not determined by the methods
used. All CoA pools, except acetoacetyl CoA, were
decreased by >96% (P < 0.001) in LA-containing cultures.

Discussion
B. fibrisolvens was originally described as a small, Grampositive bacterium particularly prevalent in the rumen
of grazing animals [19]. Many strains are proteolytic and
involved in fibre breakdown [19,20]. B. fibrisolvens JW11
was originally isolated as a proteolytic strain [21]. It has
been many years since the importance of B. fibrisolvens
in the process of PUFA reduction, or biohydrogenation,
was first documented [12]. Although other bacteria have
been implicated [22], biohydrogenating activity is high
among all members of what is now known to be an
extensive Butyrivibrio phylogenetic tree [16]. Indeed, in
our experience, its activity is many times higher than in
other species [17]. ‘Type B’ bacteria, which complete the
reduction of 18:1 isomers to SA, was identified as C.
proteoclasticum [23], which has recently been renamed
Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus [18]. The pattern of metabolism of LA and LNA observed here, and the identity of
the intermediates, follows the pathways established first
by Kepler et al. [13] and confirmed later by others
[24-26]. The observations linking growth and LA metabolism with B. fibrisolvens JW11 are consistent with
those obtained with B. fibrisolvens A38 [14] and B. fibrisolvens TH1 [15]. What is novel about the present
observations is that they clearly demonstrate that biohydrogenation is a detoxification process, necessary to
escape from the bacteriostatic effects of PUFA. Indeed,

they explain that the concentration-dependence of LA
toxicity and its apparently lower toxicity in growing cultures, observed by Kim et al. [14], have to be considered
in terms of time required by different biomass concentrations to hydrogenate, and thereby detoxify, different
concentrations of fatty acids.
Henderson [27] examined the effects of fatty acids on
ruminal bacteria. A Butyrivibrio sp. was generally most
sensitive to fatty acids, but only saturated and monoenoic acids were included in the study. OA was much
more toxic than the saturated fatty acids. Marounek et
al. [28] found that C-12 and C-14 fatty acids were more

toxic to ruminal and rabbit caecal bacteria than other
chain lengths, but again the study was of saturated acids
and oleic acid. In non-ruminal bacteria, LA and LNA
were much more toxic than saturated or monoenoic
acids [29]. The present paper describes the effects of the
more abundant poly- and monounsaturated fatty acids
on B. fibrisolvens. The PUFA were found to be much
more toxic than more saturated fatty acids.
The present experiments help to resolve the purpose
of biohydrogenation in the ruminal bacteria that undertake this reductive metabolism. Our results provide support for the conclusions of Harfoot and Hazlewood[22],
Kemp and Lander [30] and Kemp et al. [31] that biohydrogenation is a detoxification mechanism rather than a
means of disposing of reducing power, as proposed earlier [32]. The reductase which converts CLA to VA in
B. fibrisolvens comprises 0.5% of the total cell protein
[33], a very significant expenditure of cellular resources
that signifies a vital function. It should be noted that,
although more research emphasis is placed on its metabolism of LA because CLA is an intermediate, biohydrogenation is probably more important for B. fibrisolvens
to survive high LNA concentrations, as LNA is more
toxic than LA and is usually present at higher concentrations than LA in forages (e.g. [3]). Also to be noted is
that CLA is almost as toxic as LA, as found before [14].
There are several possible reasons why unsaturated
fatty acids are generally more toxic than saturated fatty
acids. The double bonds alter the shape of the molecule,
such that kinked unsaturated fatty acids disrupt the lipid
bilayer structure [34]. The finding that different PUFA
isomers, such as LNA and g-LNA, had different toxicity
would be consistent with such an interpretation. However, it is not clear that the toxicity was necessarily a
membrane effect. The free carboxyl group was necessary
for growth inhibition to take place. Methyl esters, which
might be expected to be sufficiently hydrophobic to be
incorporated into a membrane just as efficiently as a
free fatty acid, were non-toxic. They were metabolized
in the same way as the free fatty acids, however, as they
were hydrolysed by bacterial esterase activity. The free
carboxyl group was also necessary for disruption of cell
integrity, as measured by PI ingression. However, PI
ingression was affected little by the number of double
bonds in the fatty acid molecule, as detected by both
fluorescence spectroscopy and flow cytometry, and
could not explain why 18:3 fatty acids were more toxic
to growth than 18:2 fatty acids, and especially why 18:1
was not toxic to growth. Furthermore, sodium lactate
exacerbated growth inhibition by LA, in a similar manner to that observed with B. proteoclasticus [23], but
had no similar effect on the influence of LA on cell
integrity of B. fibrisolvens. A similar conclusion was
reached by Maia et al. [17] when comparing the toxic

Maia et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:52
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/52

effects of fatty acids on growth and cell integrity in different species of ruminal bacteria. Thus, although a
toxic mechanism involving disruption of the extraordinarily thin cell envelope of B. fibrisolvens [35] seems an
attractive and logical possibility, the evidence suggests
that the primary effect of PUFA lies elsewhere.
An alternative possibility is that the ready diffusion of
the free fatty acid across the membrane causes chemiosmotic difficulties, perhaps uncoupling the proton-motive
force [36], dissipating the membrane potential by facilitating ion leakage [37] or decoupling intramembrane
pathways [38,39]. While this remains a possibility, the
different effects on acyl CoA and ATP pools on PUFA
toxicity suggest a metabolic effect, specifically in acyl
CoA metabolism. Measurement of CoA metabolic pools
in bacteria is relatively rare. Here, acetyl CoA and
butyryl CoA were present at highest concentration and
the butyrate pathway intermediates at much lower concentrations, as found also in Clostridium acetobutylicum
[40]. All acyl CoAs except acetoacetyl CoA were diminished by >96% when LA was added to the medium. In
contrast, the ATP pool was affected later than acyl CoA
pools, and remained at about one-third of the control
values, presumably due to the contribution of glycolysis.
The toxicity of PUFA in different species of ruminal
bacteria was found to be related partly to whether the
bacteria produced butyrate; cellulolytic bacteria were the
other most sensitive species [17]. Within the Butyrivibrio
phylogenetic group, the most sensitive species were those
that formed butyrate via the butyrate kinase mechanism
rather than acyl CoA transferase [16]. Thus, there seems
to be a connection between PUFA toxicity and butyrate
formation. A metabonomic analysis [41] might help to
identify precisely where the PUFA act. It may also be
instructive to determine why trans-11, cis-15-18:2, a product of LNA metabolism, appeared to permit growth
while the other dienoic acid investigated here did not.
The influence of sodium lactate in lengthening the lag
phase indicates that lactate potentiates the toxic effects
of PUFA in B. fibrisolvens, as shown previously with B.
proteoclasticus [22]. Such a high concentration of lactate
(70 mM) would only occur in animals suffering acidosis
[42]. The toxicity may be an osmotic effect, or due to a
leakage of ions across the membrane, or may even be a
metabolic effect. Lactate is a major product of glucose
metabolism in B. fibrisolvens JW11 and many other
butyrivibrios [16], and high concentrations may therefore impose metabolic feedback, further stressing bacteria affected by PUFA.

Conclusions
This paper explains the basis of the beneficial effect on
meat and milk fatty acid composition of adding oils to
the ruminant diet. Ruminal biohydrogenation is

Page 7 of 10

modified via differential toxicity to ruminal bacteria of
different PUFA, including the fish oil fatty acids, EPA
and DHA. If we can understand how selective fatty acid
toxicity, or indeed other factors, affects the physiology
of biohydrogenating bacteria in the rumen, we may be
able to suggest new, rational dietary modifications that
will eventually lead to ruminant products that are healthier for human consumption.

Methods
Bacteria and growth conditions

Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens JW11 was originally isolated
from sheep as a proteolytic species [21], and is held in
the culture collection maintained at the Rowett Institute.
All transfers and incubations were carried out under O2free CO2 and at 39°C in Hungate-type tubes [43]. Inoculum volumes were 5% (v/v) of a fresh culture. The
media used in these experiments were the liquid form
of M2 medium [44]. Fatty acids were prepared as a
separate solution, sonicated for 4 min in water and
added to the medium before autoclaving. Growth of
bacteria was measured from the increase in optical density (OD) at 650 nm of the control tubes, in triplicate,
using a Novaspec II spectrophotometer (Amersham
Biosciences, UK).
The influence of fatty acids and their methyl esters
was determined in two kinds of experiment. In experiments where fatty acid concentrations were measured at
the end-point of the growth curve, usually in stationary
phase, the tubes were freeze-dried in order to enable
fatty acid extraction from the whole culture. The experiment was conducted by inoculating multiple 10-ml
tubes. At each sampling time, three tubes were removed,
the turbidity was determined, and the tubes were placed
in a heating block at 100°C for 5 min, left to cool and
frozen. One ml was taken for protein analysis and for
fatty acid extraction and derivatization.
Fatty acid extraction and analysis

Extraction, derivatization of fatty acids and GC analysis
of methyl esters were carried out using procedures
described by Wąsowska et al. [11]. The products from
incubations with LNA were identified by comparing elution profiles and mass spectra with those identified previously from analysis of methyl and 4,4dimethyloxazoline (DMOX) esters [11].
Measurement of cell integrity using propidium iodide

One ml of overnight culture was inoculated into 10 ml
of M2 medium and incubated at 39°C until it reached
mid-exponential phase (OD650 = 0.4, approx. 4 h). The
bacterial cultures were centrifuged (3000 g, 10 min, 4°C)
and the pellet was washed twice with anaerobic potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM; pH 7.0) containing 1

Maia et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:52
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/52

mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Anaerobic conditions were
maintained by carrying out transfers in an anaerobic
chamber with a gas phase of 80% N2, 10% CO2 and 10%
H2 and temperature of 39°C. Cells were resuspended in
15 ml of the same buffer, and fatty acids and their
respective methyl esters (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA)
were added to the cell suspension to a final concentration of 50 μg ml-1. Stock solutions (1 mg ml-1) of fatty
acids and methyl esters were prepared immediately
before use by sonication for 4 min in anaerobic potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.0, containing 1
mM DTT). Untreated and heat-treated cells (100°C for
20 min) served as control samples.
Following 30 min incubation of cell suspensions with
fatty acids, cell integrity was measured using PI. Ten μl
of each sample were added to 985 μl of anaerobic potassium phosphate buffer, to which was added 5 μl of 1.5
mM PI (prepared in distilled water and stored at 4°C in
the dark). The mixtures were incubated for 15 min at
39°C in the anaerobic chamber, then transferred to an
ice-water slurry and kept in the dark for up to 45 min
before being analysed for fluorescence using a fluorimeter or by flow cytometry. Fluorimetry measurements
were made using a spectrofluorimeter set at lEX = 488
nm and lEM = 650 nm. Flow cytometry was carried out
with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson
Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, California, USA)
equipped with an air-cooled argon ion laser emitting 15
mW of blue light at 488 nm. The red fluorescence of
the PI signal was collected in the FL3 channel (>600 nm
long-pass filter). FACSFlow solution (Becton Dickinson)
was used as sheath fluid. The analyses were done using
the low rate settings (12 μl/min).
ATP and acyl CoA pools

The influence of LA on metabolic pools in B. fibrisolvens was measured in cells growing in Roché et al. [45]
medium in the anaerobic chamber, as follows. Fresh
overnight culture (60 ml) of B. fibrisolvens JW11 was
mixed with 60 ml of uninoculated medium, or uninoculated medium containing 200 μg LA ml-1, then samples
(3.0 ml) were taken periodically into 1 ml of 30% (w/v)
perchloric acid. After 10 min, 4 ml of KOH were added
to the acidic solution, forming a precipitate of potassium
perchlorate, which was removed by centrifugation
(15,000 g, 15 min, 4°C). The supernatant was stored at
-80°C, then subsequently thawed and ATP was measured using a luciferase preparation according to the
manufacturer’s (Sigma) instructions.
Acyl CoA measurements were made in parallel 120-ml
control or LA-containing cultures after 20 min incubation. Cultures were maintained under CO 2 and

Page 8 of 10

centrifuged immediately at 15,000 g for 15 min at 39°C.
The pellet was stored in liquid nitrogen. Derivatization,
separation, and fluorescence detection of acyl CoAs
were carried out as described by Larson and Graham
[46]. Identification of acyl CoAs was carried out using
mass spectrometric analysis of peaks obtained from a
Hypercarb porous graphitic carbon column [47].
Bacterial protein was measured by a modification of
the Lowry method [48].
Data analysis

All data were derived from three separate cultures.
Means were compared by a Student’s t-test. Measurement of the lag phase was carried out by fitting a gradient by linear regression to log(A 650 ) vs. time during
exponential phase. The lag phase was defined as the
time at which the best-fit gradient passed an OD650 of
0.1, and was compared to the time at which the control
cultures passed 0.1. Propidium iodide ingression was
determined by 8 fluorescence measurements for each
culture.
