Abstract
Background: We are profoundly ignorant about the diversity of viruses that infect the domain
Archaea. Less than 100 have been identified and described and very few of these have had their
genomic sequences determined. Here we report the genomic sequence of a previously undescribed
archaeal virus.
Results: Haloarchaeal strains with 16S rRNA gene sequences 98% identical to Halorubrum
saccharovorum were isolated from a hypersaline lake in Inner Mongolia. Two lytic viruses infecting
these were isolated from the lake water. The BJ1 virus is described in this paper. It has an
icosahedral head and tail morphology and most likely a linear double stranded DNA genome
exhibiting terminal redundancy. Its genome sequence has 42,271 base pairs with a GC content of
~65 mol%. The genome of BJ1 is predicted to encode 70 ORFs, including one for a tRNA. Fifty of
the seventy ORFs had no identity to data base entries; twenty showed sequence identity matches
to archaeal viruses and to haloarchaea. ORFs possibly coding for an origin of replication complex,
integrase, helicase and structural capsid proteins were identified. Evidence for viral integration was
obtained.
Conclusion: The virus described here has a very low sequence identity to any previously
described virus. Fifty of the seventy ORFs could not be annotated in any way based on amino acid
identities with sequences already present in the databases. Determining functions for ORFs such
as these is probably easier using a simple virus as a model system.

Background
The three domain description of cellular life on earth,
Eukarya, Bacteria and Archaea is a firmly established biological tenet [1]. Each domain has an associated, probably

vastly diverse, virus population [2-6]. Thousands of
viruses infecting representatives of the domain Eukarya
have been described and many of their DNA/RNA
genomic sequences determined [7]. Something like 5–

6000 viruses (bacteriophages) infecting representatives of
the domain Bacteria have been described, at least morphologically, although rather fewer DNA/RNA genomic
sequences have been determined [8]. In contrast we are
largely ignorant about viruses infecting representatives of
the domain Archaea. Just 40 or so have been described and
the genomic sequences of only a few have been determined, sixteen being listed in Genbank. All archaeal
viruses so far discovered have dsDNA genomes, both linear and circular [8,9]. Archaeal viruses having an RNA
genome have not yet been identified and perhaps do not
exist [9].
The domain Archaea is divided into four established kingdoms, the Crenarchaeota, the Euryarchaeota, the uncultivated Korarchaeota and the very recently identified
Nanoarchaeota [10,11]. Virus particles associated with the
first two phyla have been identified, recently reviewed in
[9]. About 24 viruses of crenarchaeotes have been identified, often with unusual shapes, e.g. droplets and bottle
shapes never observed elsewhere; these viruses have no
obvious relationship to phage infecting members of the
domain Bacteria [8,9]. Similarly about 20 viruses infecting
members of the Euryarchaeota have been identified of
which 15 infect haloarchaea, recently reviewed in [12].
These are mostly head/tail viruses of the order Caudovirales, including myoviruses and siphoviruses that may be
distantly related to those infecting the domain Bacteria
[8,9]; although other morphotypes have also been
observed [12]. Only six viruses of the haloarchaea have
been sequenced. All were isolated by the Dyall-Smith laboratory in Melbourne, from hypersaline sources in Australia, except for φCh1. φCh1, a temperate myovirus with
a 58.5 kb linear genome, the host of which is the haloalkaliphile Natrialba magadii [13] was isolated from a laboratory strain and presumably originates, like the host,
from Africa. Lytic viruses HF1 and the closely related HF2,
having linear genomes of 75.9 kb and 77.7 kb, infect the
haloarchaea Haloferax lucentense and Halorubrum coriense
respectively [14,15]. His1 and the distantly related His2
spindle shaped viruses with linear genomes of 14.5 and
16 kb respectively, both have lytic and carrier status in
Haloarcula hispanica [16]. Finally a lytic icosahedral virus
SH1, having a linear genome of 31 kb infects Har. hispanica [17,18].
We have been studying both archaeal and bacterial
prokaryotic diversity in Chinese salt lakes in Inner Mongolia; as part of this study we looked for virus particles
associated with haloarchaea. In this report we describe the
complete genomic sequence of a ~43 kb virus BJ1.

Results
Description of site and lake water parameters
Lake Bagaejinnor is a hypersaline lake in Inner Mongolia,
China [coordinates N45 08 527 E116 36 167]. The lake
was sampled in September 2003. It had substantially
evaporated over the summer, exposing expanses of [pink
salt – encrusted] mud flats and had been reduced to small
pools and lagoons of salt – saturated colourless water, pH
8.5. The pink colouration of the salt crystals indicated the
presence of haloarchaea. The chemical composition of
lake water was determined using laser inductively coupled
plasma optical emission spectrometry by the Department
of Geology, University of Leicester. Carbonate/bicarbonate concentrations were determined by titration with
H2SO4 using a Digital Titrator Model 16900 according to
manufacturer's instructions (Hach Systems for Analysis).
Chemical concentrations were Na, 5.32 M; Cl, 4.61 M; S
1.07 M; Mg, 0.35 M; K, 33.25 mM; Br, 8.05 mM; HCO3,
7.4 mM; B, 4.25 mM; CO3, 3.3 mM; Ca, 0.77 mM; Li, 0.33
mM.

Obviously this is a seasonal chemical analysis of the lake
water, the composition of which continually varies, more
dilute in spring following the winter thaw and then gradually becoming concentrated by the hot summer winds.
We used trial and error techniques to find an appropriate
medium where we could pour both top and bottom agars.
Medium composition was influenced by very high salt
concentrations interfering with agar solidification and
causing "salting out" of some of the components. The
eventual salt composition of this medium was identical to
that determined for the lake above with the following
exceptions; Na was at 2.85 M, Cl was at 2.6 M, S was at
0.642 M, Ca and Li were omitted completely.
Identification of a haloarchaeal host
Virus BJ1 was isolated from the water column of Lake
Bagaejinnor and propagated using strain BJ1 B11. The
host was characterised by 16S rRNA gene sequence using
both forward and reverse primers, giving 1305 bp of
sequence [EMBL: AM412370]. Strain BJ1 B11is most
closely related, at 98% identity, to Halorubrum saccharovorum with 1289 identical nucleotides. It is also closely
related to Hrr. lacusprofundi (1283 identical nucleotides)
and the recently described Hrr. aidingense (1286 identical
nucleotides). All three species were originally isolated
from hypersaline environments, a salt pan in San Francisco, Deep lake Antarctica and Xin-Jiang in China respectively [19,20]. Fig 1 is a phylogenetic tree showing the
relationship of the BJ1 B11 isolate to other closely related
sequences present in the BLAST database.
Plaque morphology
Plaques for BJ1 required one to two weeks to appear on
plates because the host is slow growing. Plaque size for

BJ1 was variable between experiments ranging from 1–5
mm in diameter, probably due to slight changes in growth
conditions; they were also irregularly shaped and turbid.
No attempt was made to optimise plaque formation by
modifying temperature, salt concentrations or host strain.
Electron microscopy
Virus BJ1 has an icosahedral head, collar and tail, (Fig. 2).
The icosahedral head usually has an electron dense shadowing in the centre. The sizes of these features are shown
in the schematic diagram Fig 2. The length of a single vertex is 28 nm. The average length of an entire virus particle
is about 127 nm. The virus appears to be non-contractile
and can be tentatively assigned to the Siphoviridae family,
(see the Discussion).
Characterisation of virus genome
The genomic nucleic acid was tested for susceptibility to
various nucleases (Fig 3) Control experiments showed
that no virus – associated nucleases were responsible for
the degradation observed in these experiments. Fig. 3,
lanes 1 and 4 show undigested genome controls, lane 2
shows that the genome was sensitive to DNase I digestion
and lane 3 shows that the genome was insensitive to

RNAse A. Susceptibility to a wide range of double strand
– specific endonucleases i.e BamHI, HaeIII, SstI and XhoI,
confirmed that the DNA was double stranded e.g. (Fig 3,
panel c). Exonuclease III, specific for linear or nicked circular dsDNA, failed to cut circular double stranded DNA
plasmid DNA controls (not shown) but substantially
degraded virus genomic DNA (Fig 3 panel a, lane 5). Thus
BJ1 probably has a linear dsDNA genome, although the
possibility that it is a nicked circular genome cannot be
completely ruled out.
Genomic nucleic acid ran on 1.2% TAE agarose gels as a
discrete single band larger than a 23 kb DNA marker
band. (data not shown). PFGE also suggested a genomic
size greater than 23 kb but less than 48 kb (Fig 3, panel b).
BamH1 digestion of the genomic DNA gave 21 discrete
bands ranging in size from 6.5 kb to ~500 bp (Fig 3, panel
c). From the size of these fragments we estimated a
genome size of 42.7 kb, remarkably close to the size eventually determined by sequencing (42.271 kb, see below).
In silico digestion of the determined sequence with BamHI
showed that it would generate 20 different fragments i.e.

563, and 90 bps, with sizes in close agreement to those we
observed. Thus the genomic DNA is not subject to methylation at BamHI sites.
Genome sequence of BJ1
See Figure 4 and Table 1. The double stranded genomic
DNA isolated from virus particles is shown as a circular
sequence 42, 271 bp long with a G+C content of 64.8
mol% [EMBL: AM419438]. Exonuclease III susceptibility
showed that the DNA is linear but sequence assembly
indicated it to be circular. This indicates that the genome
is terminally redundant (and may be circularly permuted). It is unclear if the BJ1 genome ever forms a circular molecule but if it does then cos sites are unlikely to be
involved as digests with three infrequent cutting restriction enzymes (HindIII, EcoRV and EcoRI) followed by
melting at 80°C failed to show any change in the number
of bands compared to un-melted digests (data not
shown).

In the absence of an obvious end for the genome from our
sequencing experiments we analysed the cumulative GC
skew of the sequence (Fig. 4). Skew minima and maxima

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/410

often represent initiation and termination points of DNA
replication in prokaryotes and viruses with a cumulative
increase in skew related to the direction of replication and
transcription [21]. A clear maximum was observed at
about 43000 followed by a sharp change with the minima
from 1–8000. This in conjunction with the ORF map and
pattern of operons was used to designate a +1 start of the
genome (Fig. 4). The cumulative GC skew is consistent
with the reading direction of most ORFs and a rolling circle pattern of DNA replication. A single tRNA for phenylalanine (GAA anticodon recognising a UUC codon) was
identified using the tRNAscan-SE program. Potential
ORFs were assigned using the programs FGENESB and
GeneMark.hmm v2.5a (set for prokaryotes); these analyses predicted 63 and 66 ORFs, respectively, encoding
polypeptides larger than 30 amino acids. We further analysed the regions upstream and downstream of these predicted ORFs for putative ribosome binding sites and
overlapping start and stop codons, and found several
additional ORFs. BLAST searches using the amino acid
sequences of all predicted ORFs were used to differentiate
between possible genes e.g. ORFs 5 and 6 have matches
(see below), so putative ORFs in the opposite strand with
no BLAST matches have been discounted. By combining
all of the data we conclude that BJ1 probably contains 70
ORFs (Fig 4 and Table 1). [If we only count ORFs greater
than 60 aa in size then the number of ORFs drops to 55].
Taking the upper estimate of 70 gives an ORF density of
1.65/kb. This is fairly close to the figure of 1.7 ORFs/kb
observed for other archaeal virus genomes (17). The
majority of the ORFs have initiation codons of ATG (62)
and the rest are GTG (8).
The Shine/Dalgarno sequence from Halobacterium (Halorubrum) saccharovorum 16S rRNA gene sequence (Accession HSU17364), which is the closest phylogenetic match
to the phage host was complemented (AGGAGGUGA)
and used to search 5–15 bp upstream of each putative
start site for the presence of putative ribosome binding
sites (RBS). 51 of the 70 ORFs had sequences suggestive of
a RBS, (Table 1). One particular stretch of 6 predicted
ORFs (ORF43-ORF48) showed no obvious RBSs at all. A
lack of a RBS for some genes is not surprising as archaeal
transcription/translation is a mosaic of prokaryotic and
eukaryotic mechanisms and the first gene of an operon, or
a singly transcribed gene often lacks a RBS [22-24].
The majority of the ORFs (59/70) had a low calculated
isoelectric point (pI < 5), which is similar to the acidic
proteins of halophilic organisms [15,25]. Just three small
ORFs (less than 74 aa) were predicted to be extremely
basic (pI > 10). No ORF larger than 100 aa had a pI above
6.3. 63 ORFs and the tRNA are coded on one strand (designated forward) and 7 are on the reverse strand. One
ORF, 30 (13255–14700 bp) overlaps entirely with

another, ORF31 (13270–14487 bp), running in the opposite direction. It seems probable that both ORFs are coding, ORF30 because it overlaps with the start and stop
codons of the ORFs before and after it i.e. 29 and 32, with
a good consensus RBS; ORF31 because it shows significant homology to integrases, (see below).
BJ1 ORF analysis
BlastN analysis of the whole virus genome showed significant matches (E 10-9 to 10-4) to small segments of several
haloarchaeal sequences i.e. Natronomonas pharaonis, Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and Har. marismortui. BlastX analysis
identified four regions of the genome having significant
matches to data-base proteins either from haloviruses or
haloarchaea, discussed below. The putative ORFs were
individually analysed using BlastX and BlastP. InterPro
was also used to search for functional domains. Using
these approaches we were unable to ascribe any match or
function to 50 of the 70 ORFs i.e. E values were greater
than 0.05. Of the 20 we could match i.e. E value less than
0.05, most were to haloarchaeal virus entries or to haloar-

chaea. These results are summarised in Table 2. Of these
20, 4 were matches to data-base entries with no identifiable function, i.e.: ORF9, ORF10, ORF17, ORF55 and ORF
24.
The remaining 15 ORFs could have functions tentatively
ascribed to them on the basis of amino acid similarity,
(Table 2). We place them into three groups. (i) Those
probably concerned with DNA replication, gene expression and possibly integration, i.e. ORFs 5, 6, 16, 20, 21,
31, 35, 39 and 43. (ii) Those proteins likely to be involved
in virus assembly, i.e. ORFs 48, 49, 50, 52 and 53. (iii)
Those proteins with other identifiable functions, i.e.
ORF1.
Nucleotide features
Nine direct repeats were observed greater than 13 nucleotides; the largest was 17 nucleotides, i.e. GGCGGCATCCAACTCGG repeated at positions 34076 and 34120. All
of the repeats were located in putative ORFs and we can
infer nothing of significance for them. A number of per-

Orfs are in the forward direction unless indicated by a -ve sign. v indicates a valine start. aa indicates the number of amino acids. Mr is the molecular

and its distance from the start codon.

fect and imperfect inverted repeat/stemloop structures
were identified, often having loops 100 s–1000 s of nucleotides in size. One perfect palindrome is located at nuclein
otides
14226GTCCGCTGGA/TCCAGCGGAC14247
ORF31, the putative integrase gene. Another palindrome
separated by 3 nucleotides (lower case) is
42048ACTATCCGACtggGTCGGATAGT42070; again both are
present in putative ORFs and their significance is unclear
although the last palindrome is located 209 nucleotides
from the 3' end of the genome. The BJ1 genome has a low
incidence of CTAG and GATC sequences, just three of
each of these palindromes being present. This incidence is
low, both compared to the statistically expected incidence, (every 256 base pairs) and compared to the related
tetramers CGAG and GCTC which were both found 36
times. CTAG and GATC sequences appear to be selected
against by many haloviruses e.g. these palindromes are
absent from the genomes of HF1, HF2, His2 and SH1 [6].
This selection pressure is thought to be due to the avoidance of restriction-modification systems in the host cells
[26], and there is evidence that CTAG and GATC palindromes are used by haloarchaeal systems [27,28].
Sequence heterogeneity
BamHI digests of virion DNA gave rise to a fragment of
about 3.5 kb, as judged by agarose gel electrophoresis,
present in sub-stoichiometric amounts relative to the
other bands, indicated by the black arrow in Fig 3c. This
was fully sequenced and found not to fit into our genome
assembly. Primers derived from this sequence were used
with virus sequence primers and virus genomic DNA as a
template. Products were observed with primers derived
from the 3' end of ORF 32, suggesting that a minor subfraction of virion DNA did contain this BamHI fragment.
Sequencing showed that the site of insertion was at nucleotide 14790 in ORF 32 and showed that this part of ORF
32 was rich in CGX repeats, (Table 3). We have not yet
been unable to derive PCR products defining either the
location or 5' end of the insertion/substitution. Instead

we have primer walked out from the defined 3' end of the
insertion. ~8.7 kb of sequence has been determined
[EMBL: AM491333] having a G+C content of 72.6 mol%,
notably higher than the 64 mol% determined for the rest
of the virus genome and close to that reported for Hrr. saccharovorum (71 mol%). Predicted ORFs have much higher
homologies to known haloarchaeal proteins than the
other viral ORFs, (Table 3). We think it most likely this
sequence is derived from the host genomic DNA due to an
integration/excision event.

Discussion
Morphological criteria used for virus classification is outlined by the International Committee for Taxonomy of
Viruses [7]. Virus BJ1 is an icosahedral head/tailed virus
and as such is assigned to the order Caudovirales with
examples infecting members of both the domains Bacteria
and Archaea. BJ1 can also be assigned to the Bradley classification group B and might tentatively be assigned to the
family Siphoviridae due to the apparent absence of a contractile tail, base plate and tail fibres and the presence of
striations in the tail fibre. If we assume that this classification is phylogenetically justified then it could indicate
that the Caudovirales originated before the divergence of
the Bacteria and Archaea [29]. An alternative explanation
is that the Caudovirales originally infected members of the
domain Bacteria but that horizontal gene exchange from
mesophilic Bacteria to the Archaea and the subsequent stabilisation of these genes in the Archaea allowed the Caudovirales to spread into the domain Archaea [Certainly we
have detected diverse bacterial populations in the water of
Lake Bagaejinnor, SH unpublished] [9].
As described in the Introduction, very few viruses infecting
the domain Archaea have been described and as yet we
have little idea as to the extent of virus diversity in this
domain. The virus we describe here may not be a common
or dominant member of the virus community infecting
haloarchaea in saline waters. We screened for lytic virus

requirements for host culturability, good lawn formation
and plaque formation are probably extremely restrictive.

As pointed out by others, there is a genuine need to
develop other isolation and culture techniques to study
both the dominant virus populations and the true extent

of archaeal virus variation in samples such as these – perhaps using a combination of electron microscopy and
metagenomic sequence studies.
The GC content of BJ1 at 65 mol% is quite close to that
reported for Hrr. spp aidingense, lacusprofundi and saccharovorum, varying from about 63–71 mol% [19,20]. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/410

host strain for BJ1 clearly belongs to the genus Halorubrum
having 98% 16SrRNA gene sequence identity to these Halorubrum species. Its precise taxonomic relationship to
these species, in particular if it belongs to a new Halorubrum species is the subject of current studies.
Of the ORFs identified in BJ1 described in the results, all
of the statistically significant matches are recorded, (Table
2). Six of the ORFs (9, 20, 50, 52, 53, 55) are most closely
related to the haloarchaeal temperate, isometric head/
contractile tail viruses φCh1 [13] and the intensively studied, φH [30]. These two viruses are closely related to each
other, the completed genome of φCh1 shows 97% homology to the genome of φH, which is about 60% complete.
ORF 43 is most closely related to a gene from the haloarchaeal isometric head/contractile tail virus HF1. There are
no similarities with the ORFs from either the spindle
(His1, His2) or icosahedral (SH1) shaped haloarchaeal
viruses described in the Introduction. The most significant
matches were ORFs 16, 31, 35, which are almost certainly
the origin of replication complex, integrase and helicase
functions respectively of the virus, having highly significant matches to full length proteins in Har. marismortui.
ORF50 was also closely related to the putative portal protein (NP_665924) of Nab. magadii virus φCh1.
Speculatively, almost all ORFs are in the forward strand in
the same direction consistent with a rolling circle mechanism of DNA replication. The 7 ORFs on the reverse
strand including the integrase may be poorly expressed. A
few ORFs had GTG starts (but with good RBS sequences)
and the other ORFs lacked RBS sequences altogether, presumably both coding features control/reduce expression
levels. The fact that putative Int gene is coded for on the
minor strand with no RBS and that it overlaps with ORF
30 on the major strand may indicate that its expression is
tightly controlled; perhaps most infections are lytic with a
small proportion of lysogenic events. The suggestion of
operons indicated in Fig 4 is also entirely speculative and
based on the presence of overlapping stop and start signals, one run of ORFs from 43–48 has no RBS at all. Proteins with putative functions involved in DNA replication
and transcription are found in ORFs 1–43, putative structural proteins are found after ORF48 consistent with early
and late expression of operons.
Although BJ1 stocks are clonal in origin, the genomic
DNA preparation is obviously and necessarily derived
from a virus pool. Genome sequence projects often therefore give rise to heterogeneous sequences. We found one
substantial region of heterogeneity in ORF 32 at nucleotide 14790 involving either a large insertion or more
probably a substitution event (since terminally redundant
virus genomes usually package genomes in a 'head full'
mechanism). To distinguish between these possibilities

requires more sequencing. The variant sequence probably
involves the acquisition of host derived DNA since the GC
content is higher (72.6%) than that of the virus (64.8%)
and close to that reported for Hrr. saccharovorum (71%).
Obviously this insertion/substitution has taken place
about 300 nucleotides away from the putative integrase
gene. The integrase gene in viruses is often the site of insertion as well. We speculate that this variant sequence in the
virus population is the result of an integration/excision
event (possibly aberrant) during the virus infection to prepare genomic DNA. This may indicate that BJ1 is a lysogenic virus; plaques were certainly turbid consistent with
this suggestion but further experiments will be required to
prove it. Whether the virus population with this variant
sequence is viable will also require further studies. Certainly virus populations with insertions and or substantial
genomic deletions can be viable or at least rescued by
functional virus genomes.
Many interesting features remain to be discovered about
the BJ1 virus. Optimal growth conditions for this virus
need to be established and its host range determined. This
will facilitate studies on its environmental stability, patterns of transcription, protein functions, lysogenic potential and the viability of the variant virus. Assignment of
protein functions to ORFs which cannot be assigned any
function based on sequence identity is probably easier
using a virus as a model than any other genome. A systematic effort on this front will reduce the number of unclassified ORFs that metagenomic and archaeal sequencing
projects so often throw up.

Methods
Cultivation of prokaryotes from environmental samples
Isolates were grown on a modified Classic Halophile
Medium (mCHM) broth, [31]. This was made in two
components; component 1 contains 1% (w/v) yeast
extract, 0.75% (w/v) casamino acids, 0.248% (w/v) KCl
and 0.3% (w/v) trisodium citrate; component 2 contains
0.162% (w/v) Na2B4O7, 0.084% (w/v) NaBr, 7.116% (w/
v) MgCl2.7H2O, 13% (w/v) NaCl, 4.56% (w/v) Na2SO4,
0.062% (w/v) NaHCO3 and 0.036% (w/v) Na2CO3, pH
8.0. Both components were autoclaved separately and
mixed once cooled to 60°C, then stored at room temperature. 2% (w/v) agar was added to component 1 if
required to make mCHM agar plates, while 0.7% (w/v)
agar was added to component 1 to make soft top agar.
Prokaryotes were cultivated from brine, salt or sediment
samples. Brine was filtered on site through sterile 0.45 µm
membrane filters in a 250 ml capacity polycarbonate filter
unit (Sartorius) using a Nalgene hand pump until flow
stopped. Membrane filters were immediately placed in
cold sterile stabilisation buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,
1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl) and agitated to resuspend the
cells. Filtered waters were placed in sterile falcon tubes.
Samples were placed immediately on ice until they could
be stored at -20°C, usually within 6 hours of collection.
Either, cell suspensions from agitated filters were serially
diluted and plated onto mCHM agar plates, or about 0.5
g sediment and salt crust was resuspended in 0.5 ml of
mCHM and serial dilutions plated onto the mCHM agar
plates. These were incubated for two months at 37°C and
were periodically checked for the appearance of new colonies which were picked and grown on fresh plates. Subculturing was continued on the same medium until purity
was achieved. Isolated colonies were then grown in

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:410

mCHM broth to an OD695 of 2 to 4, and maintained on
sterile beads at -80°C for long-term storage in mCHM
broth with 30% (v/v) sterile glycerol.
Identification of haloarchaeal isolates by 16S rRNA gene
sequencing
Pure cultures, see above, were lysed in 100 µl nanopure
water and boiled for 10 min. Cell debris was pelleted by
centrifugation at 13 000 × g for 10 min. 1 µl cell lysate was
used in a PCR reaction containing (75 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.8, 20 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20), 0.2 mM
dNTPs, 3 mM MgCl2, 20 pmol forward primer, 20 pmol
reverse primer, 2.5 U Taq polymerase and nanopure water
to a final volume of 50 µl. To amplify the 16S rRNA genes,
the Archaeal domain specific primer 27Fa, 5'-TCY GGT
TGA TCC TGS CGG-3', [32] and rP1 5'-ACG GHT ACC
TTG TTA CGA CTT-3', [33] were used. Reaction conditions
were: 95°C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for
30 s, 50°C for 40 s and 72°C for 2 min, followed by 10
min extension time at 72°C. PCR products were purified
using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and
stored at -20°C until required. DNA sequencing, also see
below, was done by Lark Technologies, Cambridge UK
using 27Fa and rP1 primers described above (corresponding to nucleotides 27–1492 with E. coli as the reference
sequence). The DNA sequences were analysed using the
BLASTN homology search program [34], which is available at the National Centre for Biotechnology Information
to identify close matches.

Strains were placed on a phylogenetic tree using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) version 3.1
[35], using the Jukes and Cantor nucleotide substitution
model for sequence alignment and the Neighbour-Joining
method of tree inference. The support for each node was
determined by assembling a consensus tree of 500 bootstrap replicates.
Isolation of haloarchaeal virus by plaque assays
Haloarchaeal strains identified as described above were
grown in soft top agar. mCHM bottom agar plates were
overlaid with mCHM soft top agar containing 0.75% (w/
v) agar, kept molten in a 55°C water bath until required.
300 µl of the haloarchaeal strain (OD approximately 0.2
at 695 nm, avoiding absorbance by the archaeal pigments) was added to 3 ml agar cooled to approximately
50°C and mixed. This was immediately poured on top of
the bottom agar and left to set. The plates were carefully
inverted and incubated in a sealed bag at 37°C for a week
or longer. If good lawns were formed the strain was used
to isolate haloarchaeal virus as follows: 10 µl of Bagaejinnor lake water passed through both a 0.45 and 0.22 µm
filter (both from Millipore) was added to 1 ml cell culture
and incubated at 37°C in an orbital shaker at 150 rpm
overnight. The culture was plated in soft top agar as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/410

described and the resulting lawns checked for the appearance of lytic plaques. Single plaques selected for purification were picked with a sterile toothpick. Virus particles
were then resuspended in 100 µl mCHM broth; this was
then used to infect the host as previously described. This
process of plaque purification was repeated twice to
ensure that the virus samples were pure. Virus particles
remained stable in mCHM broth when placed at 4°C for
at least 1 year.
Transmission electron microscopy
5 µl of the virus sample was adsorbed onto glow discharged, carbon coated pioloform grids and fixed in glutaraldehyde vapour for 3 min. Excess sample was blotted
from the grid using filter paper. Salts were removed by
washing with distilled water. The sample was visualised
by negative staining using 1% (w/w) uranyl acetate and
viewed on a JEOL 1220 transmission electron microscope
fitted with a SIS Megaview III digital camera system. Captured Images were viewed and analysed using the Image J
program [36].
Viral nucleic acid extraction
Attempts to purify virus nucleic acid from infected liquid
cultures were unsuccessful. Accordingly 30 µl of virus
stock (~106pfu/ml) were added to 300 µl of host cell culture (OD approximately 0.2 at 695 nm). Virus particles
were left to adsorb onto the host cells for 15 min at room
temperature, mixed with soft top agar and poured and
incubated as described above to give agar plates with a
high density of virus plaques. 0.5 ml halovirus diluent
[60% (v/v) of a salt solution containing; 0.3% (w/v) KCl,
0.162% (w/v) Na2B4O7, 0.084% (w/v) NaBr, 7.116% (w/
v) MgCl2.7H2O, 13% (w/v) NaCl, 4.56% (w/v) Na2SO4,
0.062% (w/v) NaHCO3 and 0.036% (w/v) Na2CO3; 29%
(v/v) H20; 1% (v/v) 1 M Tris pH 7.2; 10% (v/v) glycerol]
was added to each plate and the virus harvested by scraping off the soft top agar and homogenising by vortexing
for 30 s. Agar and cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 20 mins. The supernatant was
transferred to a fresh clean tube. To increase the yield of
virus particles, the pellet was resuspended in 2 ml halovirus diluent and the previous steps of homogenisation and
centrifugation were repeated. Combined supernatants
were passed through a 0.45 µm filter and then a 0.22 µm
filter to further remove agar and cell debris. To remove
any exogenous non-virus nucleic acids DNase I and RNase
A were each added to a final concentration of 1 µg/ml and
the sample left at room temperature for 30 min.

Virus particles were precipitated by the addition of 1/8
volume polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 solution (2.5 M
NaCl, 20% (w/v) PEG 6000) and left to incubate for 15
min at room temperature. Virus particles were pelleted by
centrifugation at 13 000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant

Page 11 of 13

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:410

was carefully removed and the pellet resuspended in 100
µl phosphate buffered saline (0.8% w/v NaCl, 0.121% w/
v K2HPO4 and 0.034% w/v KH2PO4). To extract genomic
nucleic acid from the virus, the pellet was mixed with an
equal volume of phenol chloroform and centrifuged for
30 s. The top nucleic acid containing aqueous layer was
transferred to a fresh tube. Excess phenol chloroform was
removed by ether extraction. The nucleic acid was ethanol
precipitated, redissolved in 20 µl Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0 and
left to rehydrate at 4°C overnight. An extraction from 20
plates typically yielded 1–2 µg nucleic acid.
Genome characterisation and sequencing
1 µg virus nucleic acid was treated with either excess
DNase I (NEB), RNase A (Sigma) or Exonuclease III (NEB)
in the manufacturers reaction buffer and incubated at
37°C for 10 min, 60 min or 30 min respectively. Reactions were electrophoresed on Tris-Acetate-EDTA (TAE)
agarose gels and stained with SYBR green. Viral nucleic
acids were ran on a 1% agarose pulse field gel (BioRad) in
0.5× TBE buffer at 14°C in a CHEF DR-II apparatus (BioRad). The run time was 22 h with a voltage gradient of 6
V/cm and a linearly ramped pulse time of 50 to 90 s at an
angle of 120°.

BJ1 genomic DNA was digested with BamHI (giving
approximately 20 fragments ranging in size from 100 bp
to 5 kbp, and cloned into BamHI-digested pUC18NotI
vector [37]. Resulting clones were sequenced using vectorspecific oligonucleotide primers pUCF, 5'-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTG-3' and pUCR, 5'-CACAGGAAACAG CTATGACC-3'; these sequences were used to
design further primers to primer walk across the clones.
The high G+C content (~65 mol%) of the initial
sequences was used to identify restriction enzymes that
would likely cut the phage genome to give smaller (on
average 500–1000 bp) fragments. Secondary libraries of
SstI and XhoI fragments were created in pUC18NotI and
representative clones of these libraries were sequenced
using pUCF and pUCR and subsequent primer walking.
Finally the remaining gaps were filled by designing primers to the ends of the larger contigs, orientating these contigs by PCR using phage genome as template, and then
primer walking out from the contigs using the PCR amplified products as sequencing template. The genomic
sequence was assembled using the Lasergene SeqMan 7.0
program (DNAStar). Final coverage of the genome was 4fold with the majority sequenced on both of the strands
or, where bidirectional sequencing was impractical, with
multiple sequence runs on the same strand.
Bioinformatics
Potential ORFs were assigned using the programs
FGENESB [38] and GeneMark.hmm v2.5a [39]. tRNA
sequences were identified using the tRNAscan-SE program

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/410

in [40]. Translations of potential ORF sequences to amino
acids were made with the SeqBuilder program (DNAStar).
Statistics for each of the ORFs were calculated using the
program ProtParam [41].
GC skew was calculated using the online base composition tools at [42]. BLAST (blastp and tblastn) and PSIBLAST [43] were used to search for possible homologies
to known proteins, or proteins predicted by translation of
the unannotated DNA sequence in GenBank. Inverted
repeats in the DNA sequence were identified using Einverted [44] and PALINDROME [45]; direct repeats were
located using Palim [46].
