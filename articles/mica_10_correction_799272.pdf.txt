Abstract
The version of this article published in BMC Genomics 2009, 10:558, contains data in Table 1 which are now known
to be unreliable, and an illustration, in Figure 1, of unusual miRNA processing events predicted by these unreliable
data. In this full-length correction, new data replace those found to be unreliable, leading to a more straightforward interpretation without altering the principle conclusions of the study. Table 1 and associated methods have
been corrected, Figure 1 deleted, supplementary file 1 added, and modifications made to the sections “Deep
sequencing of small RNAs from grapevine leaf tissue” and “Microarray analysis of miRNA expression”. The editors
and authors regret the inconvenience caused to readers by premature publication of the original paper.
Background: MicroRNAs are short (~21 base) single stranded RNAs that, in plants, are generally coded by specific
genes and cleaved specifically from hairpin precursors. MicroRNAs are critical for the regulation of multiple
developmental, stress related and other physiological processes in plants. The recent annotation of the genome of
the grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) allowed the identification of many putative conserved microRNA precursors, grouped
into multiple gene families.
Results: Here we use oligonucleotide arrays to provide the first indication that many of these microRNAs show
differential expression patterns between tissues and during the maturation of fruit in the grapevine. Furthermore
we demonstrate that whole transcriptome sequencing and deep-sequencing of small RNA fractions can be used
both to identify which microRNA precursors are expressed in different tissues and to estimate genomic coordinates
and patterns of splicing and alternative splicing for many primary miRNA transcripts.
Conclusions: Our results show that many microRNAs are differentially expressed in different tissues and during
fruit maturation in the grapevine. Furthermore, the demonstration that whole transcriptome sequencing can be
used to identify candidate splicing events and approximate primary microRNA transcript coordinates represents a
significant step towards the large-scale elucidation of mechanisms regulating the expression of microRNAs at the
transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.

Background
This article has been published as a correction for [1].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (19-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that play important roles in the regulation of
various cellular processes by inhibiting gene expression
at the post-transcriptional level [2-4]. Many miRNAs
interact with target mRNAs, leading to degradation or
sequestration from the translational apparatus [5,6];
some miRNAs target other non-coding transcripts and
are required for the generation of trans-acting small
interfering RNAs (ta-siRNAs) [7]. miRNAs have been
implicated in the regulation of key developmental, stress
response and other physiological processes. While in
animals many miRNAs are derived from introns or
untranslated regions of coding messages, plant miRNAs
are typically specified by dedicated MIR genes. These
genes are, at least for the most part, transcribed by RNA
polymerase II to yield capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNA) [8]. The RNAse III
enzyme Dicer-like-1 (DCL1) mediates the specific excision of mature miRNAs from the pri-miRNA via the
initial generation of imperfect hairpin precursors (premiRNAs) and the subsequent excision of a duplex consisting of the mature microRNA and its complementary
region (miRNA*) [9,10]. Most, if not all plant miRNAs
then undergo methylation of the 2’ hydroxyl group at
the 3’ ends of this duplex [11] and are subsequently
exported to the cytosol, where one strand, the mature
miRNA, is selectively incorporated into the RNA
Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) which mediates
interactions with target mRNAs [12].
The same, or highly similar mature miRNAs are often
specified by different genomic loci within a species, and
many, but by no means all, miRNAs show broad phylogenetic conservation - similar miRNAs are grouped into
families. Several computational methods have been developed to identify putative pre-miRNAs by evaluating the
capacity of the genomic context of sequences similar to
known mature miRNAs to form hairpin structures exhibiting structural and thermodynamic features consistent with
known pre-miRNAs (e.g. [13]). Purely ab-initio
approaches to the prediction of non-conserved (lineagespecific) miRNAs have also yielded some notable successes
(e.g. [14]), although such approaches are often plagued by
an excess of false positive results. The most reliable
method to identify putative novel pre-miRNAs remains
the sequencing of small RNA fractions [11,15-21] coupled
with the identification of plausible hairpin structures in
flanking genomic sequences (e.g. [22]).
Once mature miRNA sequences have been identified,
their expression in different tissues, developmental
stages or environmental conditions can be studied
through experimental approaches such as northern

blotting, oligonucleotide arrays or deep-sequencing of
isolated small RNA fractions. However, the fact that
identical or highly similar mature miRNAs can derive
from multiple loci within a single genome limits the
capacity of such approaches to determine which genomic precursor loci are truly expressed.
Meaningful insight into the regulation of miRNA
expression at the transcriptional and other levels is
undoubtedly desirable in the context of post-genomic and
systems biology initiatives. However, large scale and insilico studies of the regulation of transcription of miRNAs
require accurate definition of primary transcript coordinates on a genomic sequence, or at the very least, fairly
accurate estimates of transcriptional start sites. Owing to
their typically short physiological half-life, relatively few
pri-miRNAs have been found in EST and large-scale fulllength cDNA sequencing projects in plants. For the same
reasons, manual cloning and characterization of primary
miRNAs is a laborious process, and has been performed
for relatively few plant miRNAs [8,23-25].
To date, large-scale analysis of expression of plant
miRNAs and associated prediction of precursor
sequences have been restricted to relatively few species
and the paucity of complete plant genome sequences
limits the possibilities for studies incorporating extensive
genomic information. The recently published genome
sequence of the grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) [26] provides the first opportunity to study the potential roles of
miRNAs in fruit maturation and other physiological processes of a commercially important species in the context of a complete genome sequence.
We have previously used comparative methods to predict 140 putative pre-miRNAs (representing 28 conserved miRNA families) in the grapevine genome [26].
Here we present experimental validation of a large number of these predictions using several high throughput
methodologies. Oligonucleotide arrays reveal that several
of these families show significant changes in expression
levels in different tissues and during fruit maturation.
Small RNA deep-sequencing allowed the precise definition of boundaries of mature miRNA sequences where
comparative predictions left some ambiguity. Additionally, we demonstrate that deep sequencing of the polyA+
transcriptome permits the precise identification of
which candidate precursors are expressed in different
tissues and shows that, in many cases, fairly precise estimates of primary transcript coordinates may be inferred
from such data. Finally, we show that patterns of splicing and alternative splicing of pri-miRNAs may be elucidated from whole transcriptome deep sequencing data
and confirm that a significant proportion of grapevine
pri-miRNAs are subjected to such processes, consistent
with the suggestion that post-transcriptional regulation

Mica et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:109
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/109

might play a widespread role in the regulation of plant
miRNA maturation.

Results and Discussion
In the previous description of 8.4 fold coverage assembly
of the grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) genome [26] we identified 164 candidate conserved miRNAs. Here we present a comprehensive characterization of conserved
miRNAs in grapevine including a refinement of mature
miRNA sequences and important information regarding
pattern of expression of both mature miRNAs and precursors. Three complementary approaches were followed to characterize the expression pattern of both the
mature miRNAs and their precursors. To allow a comparison between methods, all technologies were applied
to leaf tissue. Whole transcriptome deep sequencing was
performed on all tissues available from the highly homozygote sequenced clone PN40024. To maximize the coverage of tissues studied, microarray and 454
transcriptomic analyses were performed on berries organs of particular agronomic importance - from other
clones as they cannot be easily obtained from the very
weak PN40024 clone.
Comparative prediction of microRNA precursors

We previously used the MicroHarvester software [13]
with all plant miRNAs present in release 9.1 of miRBase
[27] to identify 164 candidate conserved miRNAs and
their precursors in the 8.4 fold coverage assembly of the
genome of the grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) [26]. Manual
refinement of these predictions provided 140 high-confidence candidate pre-miRNAs classified in 28 conserved
families (79 unique predicted mature microRNA
sequences).
For the most part, we confirm existing patterns of
miRNA family conservation with respect to completely
sequenced plant genomes for which extensive analyses
of miRNAs have been performed (Arabidopsis thaliana,
Populus trichocarpa, Oryza sativa and Physcomitrella
patens). Of the 28 families for which we identified putative precursor sequences in Vitis vinifera (Table 1), 9
are represented in all four of these species and a further
10 have been characterized in all three magnoliophytes.
One family (miR403) is present in both of the previously
sequenced Dicots, while two previously Arabidopsis-specific families (miR828 and miR845) were predicted in
grapevine (suggesting their loss or - as yet - undetected
presence in poplar), while miR479 and miR482 (annotated only in poplar and grapevine) are likely to have
evolved in a common ancestor of these organisms after
its divergence from the Arabidopsis lineage [26].
miR477 precursors have been characterized only in
poplar, grapevine and P. patens, while a series of
miR535 precursors represent the first members of this

Page 3 of 15

family to be identified in core eudicots, having been
identified only in P. patens, rice and more recently in
the California poppy (Eschscholzia californica) [28]. The
only families tested for which members have been identified in poplar and at least one other of the aforementioned genomes but for which microHarvester failed to
identify candidate precursors in the grapevine genome
were miR472, miR530 and miR827.
With respect to the reference annotation of protein
coding genes in the Vitis vinifera genome, 127 putative
pre-miRNAs were intergenic in location (17 overlapped
with annotated genes but on the non-coding strand).
Four precursor predictions fell within or overlapped
annotated coding or UTR exons although homology
searches and transcriptomics data generated subsequently to the initial annotations call into question the
validity of all but two of these exon annotations. miRNA
156 h is probably an incorrect prediction derived from a
coincidentally plausible hairpin structure formed by the
opposite strand to the presumed target (a Squamosapromoter Binding Protein (SBP) box gene). A similar
situation is observed for miR171g which falls on the
opposite strand to to a GRAS domain transcription factor gene. Nine precursor predictions were apparently
intronic in location. Manual checks of the automated
annotations suggested that all of the introns putatively
containing pre-miRNAs were likely to be erroneous predictions, being atypically long (over 13 kb) and interrupting putative retroelement derived genes or obvious
fusion gene predictions (not shown).
Deep sequencing of small RNAs from grapevine leaf
tissue

We generated 13,078,222 reads with Illumina sequencing of small RNA isolated from Vitis vinifera L. clone
PN40024 leaves. 2,585,821 individual small RNA reads
of 18-27 bases (19.8% of the total reads generated)
yielded at least one perfect match to the draft genome
after removal of adapter sequences and allowing for
post transcriptional oligoadenylation of reads. After
exclusion of reads mapping to annotated structural
RNAs, Over 7% of the total mapped sequences were of
length 21 bases and accounted for 7.8% of the genomic
loci represented by the mapped data (mean redundancy
of 4.38 reads/locus). 15% of loci represented were of
length 24 (10.7% of tags sequenced) with a mean redundancy of 3.08 reads/locus, suggesting, in accord with
other studies [29,30], that miRNAs in our sample tend
to be expressed at higher levels or processed more specifically than the more heterogeneous 24 base small
RNAs.
Mapping of the short tags onto the genome sequence
revealed that of the 28 families predicted by our comparative analysis, 23 showed at least one sequence tag

Mica et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:109
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/109

either in exact or very close correspondence to the position of one of the predicted mature sequences (the
exceptions being miR395, miR396, miR477, miR828 and
miR845). In some cases, the most commonly observed
sequences were identical to the predicted mature
sequences while for other families, the predominant
mature miRNA sequenced exhibited small variations
(shifts or differences of length of one or two bases) with
respect to the predicted mature sequences. This finding
was not unexpected given the variation in mature
miRNA lengths within families observed in other plant
species and the nature of the comparative method used
to generate the initial predictions. For predicted precursors for which matching small RNA reads were recovered, the vast majority of reads conform to the
sequences indicated in Table 1 [see also Additional File
1: Supplemental figure S2], consistent with the primary
requirement for the annotation of plant miRNA
sequences [31].
We recovered a number of reads that include an additional 3’ base that does not correspond to any genomic
locus, this tendency has been observed in other species
(e.g. [29]). Furthermore, a low but notable proportion of
mapped small RNA sequences show mismatches to the
genomic sequence while preferentially mapping only to
putative miRNA precursor loci. This is probably due to
errors in sequencing or during reverse transcription or
amplification and particularly to the higher error rate of
the Illumina sequencing strategy in GC rich sequences
[32]. During the course of these analyses it became clear
that two precursors (miR172a and 172b) were likely to
derive from the opposite strand from that initially predicted. Where appropriate, corrected mature sequences
have been deposited in miRBase.
Due to identity or similarity among mature miRNAs
belonging to the same family, deep sequencing of small
RNAs does not allow consistent unambiguous assignment of mature miRNAs to their genomic loci of origin.
Nevertheless our analysis provided indications of the
presence and relative abundance of 36 distinct mature
miRNAs from conserved families in leaves - corresponding to up to 65 distinct precursor loci (see Table 1 for
summary and Additional File 1: Supplemental figure S2
for detailed maps of all small RNA reads mapping to
predicted precursors).
Oligonucleotide arrays

A 12 K CombiMatrix custom array was developed to
validate our in-silico miRNA predictions and to profile
miRNAs expression in different tissues.
Slides were hybridized with low molecular weight
RNA (LMW-RNA), extracted from six grapevine (V.
vinifera L. cv Corvina) tissues: ripening berries (three
stages analyzed), roots, leaves and young inflorescences.

Page 4 of 15

Each hybridization and LMW-RNA extraction was performed twice.
In addition to the mature miRNA sequences, the
probe set included probes shifted 5 or 10 bases 3’ or 5’
with respect to the central base of the corresponding
mature miRNAs as well as probes derived from regions
of the stem not predicted to overlap with the mature
miRNA sequence and controls containing maximally
destabilizing substitutions with respect to probe
sequences [see Additional File 2: Supplemental figure
S5]. Except for probes shifted 5 nucleotides towards the
5’ end of the miRNA precursor, for more than 90% of
the probes a signal drop-off greater than 90% was
observed - indicating no significant hybridization for
these probes occurred. On the contrary, for probes
shifted 5 nucleotide towards the 5’ end of the miRNA
precursor the lack of signal drop-off might be due to
the fact that probes were synthesized with their 3’ termini towards the slide, and that no “spacer” oligonucleotide was used (according to CombiMatrix
protocols). As a consequence, steric effects might reduce
the specificity determined by the 3’-most five bases of
the probes.
Other than for 26 out of 140 pre-miRNAs (Table 1),
no detectable signals were recorded for the probes
designed on the precursor loop regions - likely due to
size fractionation of RNA samples and the relatively
short half-life of pre-miRNAs. We conclude that our
miRNA expression data are principally derived from
mature miRNAs molecules, without appreciable premiRNA contamination.
Finally, it should be noted that recent studies have
demonstrated appreciable levels of cross-hybridization
between closely related miRNAs and probes differing by
only one or two bases [33]. It is therefore difficult to
exclude the possibility that cross-hybridization within
miRNA families causes a distortion of quantitative estimates of expression levels of some individual mature
miRNA sequences.
Microarray analysis of miRNA expression

Of the mature miRNA sequences considered, 56 (corresponding to 23 different families), showed significant
expression in at least one tissue tested (Table 1 and
Additional File 1: Supplemental Figure S1), and another
6 showed a borderline signal. Specifically, 41 different
miRNAs showed significant signal in roots, 47 in leaves,
49 in young inflorescences, 53 in green berries, 42 in
berries at veraison (the point where growth ends and
maturation begins) and 40 in mature berries.
To evaluate the statistical significance of the differential expression of mature miRNAs in the six tissue considered, we set up two distinct comparisons: one among
the three developmental stages of the ripening berries

For each predicted pre-miRNA the table reports: the mature sequence, the number of perfect matching or oligoadenylated short RNA reads observed in leaf, asterisks indicate that corresponding miRNA* sequences
were also recovered by deep sequencing (column A), tissues in which significant expression of the precursor was observed by Illumina whole transcriptome sequencing (column B, where L = leaf, R = root, S = stem,
C = callus), the presence of 454 reads including the precursor sequence in leaf (column C, where Y = yes, N = no), and tissues where the Combimatrix oligoarray showed significant expression of the mature
sequence (column D, where L = leaf, I = inflorescence, R = root, Bg = immature berry, Bv = veraison, Bm = mature berry). Asterisks indicate signal detected for precursor in that tissue. Mature miRNAs are ordered to
reflect expected cases of crosshybridization for oligonucleotide arrays. For all microRNAs, chromosome, strand and coordinates of the precursor miRNA are provided (scaffold coordinates indicate that the miRNA was
situated on a scaffold not incorporated into the 8.4× genome assembly).

Figure 1 Oligonucleotide design strategy for Combimatrix custom oligonucleotide array. Probes were designed complementary to the
predicted mature miRNA (green line) and miRNA* (thick black line) sequences. Additional probes were designed to the loop region (thin black
line) as well as probes shifted 5 nucleotides (red lines) and 10 nucleotides (blue lines) with respect to the miRNA and miRNA* sequences.

and the other one among leaves, roots and inflorescences. ANOVA analyses were performed with a Pvalue threshold of 0.05 and subsequently a Scheffè test
was used to assess which of the three tissues showed
significant differences. Thirteen different mature miRNAs showed a statistically significant change in signal
between the ripening stages of the berry (Figure 2A-C),
and 27 miRNAs showed significant changes in their
expression when comparing three different tissues
(leaves, roots and inflorescences)(Figure 2D-H).
miR395a and miR171h show a distinctive pattern of
expression - being highly expressed at veraison with
respect to the other two stages (4.4 and 2.3 fold changes
of expression level respectively) (Figure 2A). Seven miRNAs (miR156f, miR169a, miR169f, miR169r, miR169x,
miR319b and miR535a) are more expressed in mature
berries than in green berries (Figure 2B). Four miRNAs
(miR171c, miR172c, miR396c, miR403a) are, on the contrary, more expressed in green berries, their expression
decreasing during ripening (Figure 2C).
Clear patterns also emerge from analyses of differential expression between roots, leaves and young inflorescences. Thirteen miRNAs are significantly differentially
expressed in roots, showing a similar expression in the
other tissues. In particular miR397a, miR398b and
miR408 all show at least 100 fold higher expression in
root than either leaf or early inflorescences, while
miR159a, miR160a, miR399a, miR399b, miR403a and
miR535 show more modest, but still significant, changes
in the same comparisons (Figure 2D). On the contrary
miR164a, miR164b, miR171c and miR172c show a significantly lower level of expression in roots (Figure 2F).
Five miRNAs (miR169v, miR169y, miR171f, miR171h
and miR319b) yield significantly higher signals in young
inflorescences than both leaves and roots (between 2
and 7.2 fold higher levels in this tissue)(Figure 2E). Only
one miRNA, miR160c, shows a leaf-specific expression
profile (2.5 fold lower level in leaves with respect to
other tissues) (Figure 2G). Finally, six miRNAs
(miR169a, miR169e, miR169f, miR169x, miR171e and
miR395a) exhibit significant differences in expression
levels in all comparisons between leaf, root and

inflorescences (Figure 2H). Five of these miRNAs (169a,
169e, 169f, 169x and 171e) show the highest expression
in young inflorescences and the lowest in roots.
Following the widespread assumption that many
miRNA/target interactions are conserved between
related species [2,3], our data regarding differential
expression of mature miRNA sequences raise some
intriguing possibilities particularly with respect to the
potential importance of miRNA in the regulation of
fruit maturation.
Li et al. [34] recently showed that the transcription
factor NFYA5 is targeted by miR169 and that overexpression of miR169 leads to excessive water loss through
leaves and hypersensitivity to drought stress in A. thaliana. In this light, the preponderance of miR169 family
members in the group of miRNAs upregulated in
mature berries is striking and might reflect a mechanism
to protect maturing fruit from dehydration. We also
note that miR535 family, identified so far only in O.
sativa and P. patens [35] is upregulated during berry
maturation. This is a first indication of a possible function of miR535 for which no information was previously
available. miR396c shows 6 fold decrease in expression
during ripening. The mir396 family targets seven
Growth Regulating Factor (GRF) genes in Arabidopsis
[14]. GRF genes encode putative transcription factors
associated with cell expansion in leaf and other tissues
in A. thaliana and O. sativa [36,37]. A potential role for
miR396 in the regulation of cell expansion during fruit
maturation is an intriguing hypothesis. In addition,
recent data also link miR396 to responses to abiotic
stresses including drought [38], again suggesting the
importance of water homeostasis during berry ripening.
miR172, downregulated during berry maturation, targets
Apetala 2 (AP2) -like transcription factors, regulators of
flowering time, organ identity and of vegetative phase
change [39]. In grapevine, genes related to AP2 are
upregulated at veraison, being involved in berry maturation [40] and putatively connected with abiotic and biotic stress resistance. This evidence fits well with our
findings. The sharp up-regulation of miR395 at veraison
suggests a further role for miRNAs in an agronomically

important aspect of grape maturation. miR395 is known
to contribute to the regulation of sulfur metabolism, targeting both sulfate transporters and ATP sulphurylase
genes. A direct connection between ATP sulfurylases
and berry maturation has not been demonstrated, but it
is known that a Glutathione S-transferase is strongly
connected with berry ripening and in particular with
coloration during berry development [40].
miR397a, miR398b and miR408 which are extremely
highly expressed in root tissues target various copper
proteins: plantacyanin, laccases and a superoxide dismutase, all putatively involved in stress responses and lignification [14,16,41,42]. These miRNAs have also been
shown to be coexpressed in Arabidopsis under conditions of copper deprivation [43]. Moreover some laccase
genes in Arabidopsis are root specific (for example

AtLAC15) or mostly expressed in roots [44] and are
involved in root elongation and lignification [45]. Given
that grapevine roots are much more lignified than those
of Arabidopsis, it is plausible that regulation of laccase
expression is vital in the grapevine. It is interesting to
note that the laccase family is, along with other polyphenol oxidase gene families, massively expanded in grapevine with respect to Arabidopsis (>60 genes in V.
vinifera, 17 in Arabidopsis).
Whole transcriptome sequencing and differential
expression of precursors

The majority of plant miRNA genes are transcribed by
RNA polymerase II and result in the production of polyadenylated primary transcripts [8]. A strict correlation
between expression levels of individual precursors and

Mica et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:109
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/109

levels of mature miRNAs should not be expected.
Mature miRNAs are likely to be, in general, more stable
than their corresponding primary transcripts and may
derive from more than one genomic locus. Furthermore,
recent data in plants [46] and animals [47] suggest that
a variety of mechanisms, including alternative splicing
and the specific binding of protein factors, can regulate
the efficiency with which pri- or pre-miRNAs are processed. High levels of primary transcript can thus be
associated with low levels of mature miRNAs and viceversa. These considerations notwithstanding, it is reasonable to presume that sequences derived from highly
expressed pri-miRNA transcripts should be represented
in whole transcriptome “deep sequencing” experiments.
To investigate this hypothesis, we have analyzed whole
polyA+ transcriptome data generated with the Illumina
Solexa technology [48] and Roche 454 next generation
sequencing platforms.
A total of 135,047,735 Illumina sequences (33-35
bases in length) derived from polyA+ RNA isolated from
4 tissues (in vitro cultivated juvenile leaf (29,829,113
sequences), in vitro cultivated juvenile stem (30,785,175
sequences), in vitro cultivated juvenile root (29,254,635
sequences) and embryonic callus (45,178,812 sequences)
were mapped to the grapevine genome and coordinates
compared to those for predicted pre-miRNAs.
The statistical significance of the number of reads
mapping within a predicted pre-miRNA was evaluated
(see Materials and Methods) and 52 predicted precursors show significant expression in at least one tissue
(25 in leaf, 38 in stem, 17 in root, 33 in callus)(Table 1).
Many predicted precursors show a wide expression
(miR156d, miR159c, miR166a and c, miR168, miR171a,
miR398a, miR398b and c, miR408, miR482). In some
families, when expressed, precursors show overlapping
patterns. For example, miR319c, miR319e and miR319f
are all expressed in stem, while miR319c and miR319g
are expressed in callus, no expression of miR319 was
detected in leaf or root. A similar situation is observed
for the miR396 family. In other cases, different precursors seem to be predominantly expressed in different
tissues. For example miR171e transcripts are detected
only in callus, miR171f is only transcribed in stem while
miR171g is observed in callus and root - a similar situation can be observed for several families including
miR166, miR167 and miR169). These data suggest that
tissue specific expression of different precursors within
single families is widespread in the grapevine.
454 sequencing generated 613,098 and 581,655 reads
respectively from leaf and berry polyA + RNA. The
expression of 15 unique predicted precursor sequences
received ulterior support from these data (Table 1).
With the exception of miR160b and the miR535 family
the expression of all precursors detected by 454

Page 9 of 15

sequencing in leaf was also strongly supported by Illumina data. Interestingly, given the lack of detectable
expression of the mature sequence in leaf or berry,
miR482 precursors were detected at high levels both by
Illumina and 454 sequencing, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation of processing of this transcript.
Estimation of primary microRNA transcripts and splice
sites

For a number of predicted microRNAs the density of
coverage of the corresponding genomic loci was sufficient to attempt to estimate primary transcript coordinates as well as patterns of splicing and alternative
splicing.
We constructed Position Specific Scoring Matrices
(PSSMs) of experimentally validated grapevine canonical
splice donor and acceptor contexts (French-Italian Consortium for Characterization of the Grapevine Genome,
unpublished data) and used these matrices to evaluate
all possible canonical splice donors and acceptors from
3 kb upstream to 3 kb downstream of predicted microRNA precursors showing extensive coverage by Illumina
RNA-Seq reads. The positions and flanking exonic
sequences of all possible splice donor/acceptor pairs
were used to combinatorially generate possible splice
junctions. RNA-Seq reads which did not map perfectly
to the genome sequence were compared to these computationally generated splice junctions and pairs providing perfect matches (with at least 8 bases on either side
of the splice junction) were recorded along with the tissue distribution of reads supporting each splice event.
Additionally, for each supported splice event, we
recorded the ratio of base coverage by RNA-Seq of the
flanking 40 putatively exonic bases and the coverage of
flanking 40 putatively intronic bases (not including
reads previously identified as covering the putative splice
junction). Three fold greater coverage of exonic regions
was considered as additional support for the presence of
a functional splice junction. Introns inferred from mapping of 454 transcriptome reads were also recorded.
Visual examination of RNA-Seq coverage of regions
upstream and downstream of miRNA precursor loci was
used to provide initial estimates of transcript start and
end positions. This step was complicated by the known
propensity of RNA-Seq to provide uneven coverage of
transcript termini - presumably due to the dynamics the
nebulization step in sample preparation and to issues
associated with differential recovery of fragments during
sample preparation. Accordingly, we subjected the 6 kb
interval centered on predicted precursors to promoter
prediction analysis by TSSP-TCM [49] in order to
attempt to provide support for manually identified transcription start sites. Estimated transcript coordinates,
putative intron coordinates quality scores for each

donor/acceptor, frequencies of splice junction-covering
reads, and TSS proposed by TSSP-TCM are reported in
Additional File 1: Supplemental Table S4.
Figure 3 shows the transcriptional landscape for the
genomic region from 3 Kbp upstream to 3 Kbp downstream of three exemplar predicted miRNA precursors,
including introns inferred from 454 and Illumina
sequence data, the concordance of splicing events identified by 454 and Illumina reads is notable and consistent with the reliability of the Illumina data to infer
splicing events. Detailed genomic alignments of all reads
supporting splices indicated in Figure 3 are available in
Additional File 1: Supplemental Figure S4. We note that
relative numbers of tags representing different regions
of putative primary miRNA transcripts vary but tend to
be consistent between different tissues. The GC content
of 100 base windows centered on each genomic position
are also shown and illustrate, within the proposed primary transcripts, an apparent correspondence between
depth of coverage and GC content [32].
Figure 3A shows the transcriptional context of
miR394b and the presence of a canonical intron supported by 14 Illumina reads (7 distinct sequences). This
intron was also easily detectable through RACE experiments (see Additional File 1: Supplemental Table S3).
We note that the position of the intron corresponds
well to a region of low, or undetectable levels of Illumina transcriptome coverage, and that tissue specific
differences in Illumina reads mapping to this region are
quite apparent. These data suggest that our approach is
capable of identifying introns in pri-miRNA transcripts
and differences in steady state levels of pri-miRNA transcripts between tissues. Additionally, 3’ RACE

experiments indicated a transcript 3’ end within 20 bp
of the position predicted from RNA-Seq read coverage
(see Additional File 1: Supplemental Table S3).
The miR162 precursor (Figure 3B) is of particular
interest in that it covers a region including several
potential canonical introns that are supported by multiple Illumina and 454 reads. All tissues indicate that the
transcriptional start site falls between positions
4,714,680 - 4,714,687 on chromosome 17. The postulated canonical introns imply alternative splicing of the
nascent primary transcript from this locus, as does the
coverage of the region by 454 contigs (whose map positions are also consistent with the Illumina data with
respect to the overall coordinates of the nascent primary
transcript). Several of these introns, and the alternative
splicing of this transcript were also supported by preliminary RACE experiments (see Additional File 1: Supplemental Table S3). Indeed, while the boundaries of
proposed introns correspond to “shoulders” of falling
transcript coverage, significant levels of reads mapping
within the introns are observed. Interestingly, Hirsch et
al. [46] recently demonstrated that the primary miR162a
transcript of Arabidopsis is subjected to complex pattern
of alternative splicing, similar to that proposed for the
grapevine miR162 transcript. In Arabidopsis, only
unspliced isoforms are capable of yielding mature miRNAs. Our findings therefore suggest conservation of
alternative splicing as a key regulatory mechanism in
miR162 expression and indicate that Illumina and 454
transcript data can also be used to identify alternatively
spliced plant pri-miRNAs.
Figure 3C shows evidence for expression of the
miR168 locus. Analogously to miR162, our data suggest

Mica et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:109
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/109

alternative splicing of the pri-mRNA, while the distribution of 454 contigs is highly consistent with the Illumina
data. Vaucheret et al. [50] showed that AGO1, the target
of miR168 is involved in the regulation of miR168 stability. Our data may hint at yet another mechanism of
regulation of this intriguing miRNA.
Of 25 precursor loci chosen on the basis of extensive
RNA-Seq coverage (see Additional File 1: Supplemental
Table S3), 18 showed evidence of transcript splicing and
8 of alternative splicing, suggesting that post-transcriptional modification of miRNA transcripts is likely to be
widespread. It is possible that some splicing events frequently identified by deep sequencing approaches could
be associated with regulation of downstream processing
of transcripts as has been shown for the miR162 transcript of Arabidopsis [46]. For miR162 and miR168, this
hypothesis might be consistent with the low levels of
mature microRNA observed by deep-sequencing, in
contrast to the apparently high spliced transcript levels.
For several pre/pri-miRNA loci (notably miR162 and
miR168) we infer several closely related canonical
introns (shared splice donors with splice acceptor sites
shifted by a few tens of bases or vice-versa). We speculate that this phenomenon might be due, in part, to the
incapacity of the Nonsense Mediated Decay pathway
(which is dependent on ribosomal scanning of mRNAs
[51] to monitor “erroneous” splicing of non-coding
transcripts.
The estimation of primary transcript coordinates, and
in particular transcription start sites is a critical step
towards the elucidation of specific mechanisms regulating the expression of miRNAs at the transcriptional
level. Our Illumina transcript reads are non-directional it is not possible to establish from which strand of the
genome a transcript is derived. However, we show elsewhere that both concomitant transcription of both
genomic strands at single loci and transcription of intergenic regions are rare in grapevine (French-Italian Consortium for Characterization of the Grapevine Genome,
unpublished data). Thus, evidence of transcription of
intergenic pre-miRNAs can reasonably be considered as
validation of transcription of the precursor.
The finding that relative depth of coverage of different
regions of primary transcripts is consistent between tissues suggest the presence of systematic biases in either
the procedure used to fragment the cDNA, in amplification of fragments for sequencing, or in sequencing efficiency. Dohm et al. [32] observed a strong relationship
between local GC content and depth of coverage with
Illumina genome resequencing. Indeed, we observe a
relationship between local GC content and depth of
coverage - even within regions that show contiguous
coverage and are unlikely to represent introns (correlation between log coverage for positions represented by

Page 11 of 15

at least one sequence and GC content of 100 base window centered on that position for all bases within 3 kb
of a predicted precursor is >0.25 for all tissues, p = 0).
However, grapevine introns between both coding and
non-coding exons show a low GC content (34.7 and
32.3% respectively) with respect to coding and non-coding exons (44 and 37.3% respectively) [26]. Thus, it may
be difficult to differentiate between introns and regions
where low coverage is a result of low GC content in
exonic regions on the basis of Illumina transcriptome
data - particularly where levels of template are likely to
be low and a-priori gene models are not available. However, the discovery that putative splice junctions for primiRNAs can be identified by discontiguous mapping of
illumina reads may help to ameliorate this problem for
plant pri-miRNAs. The fact that we recovered evidence
of alternative splicing of miR162, is consistent with data
from A. thaliana [46] and validates our basic approach.
Indeed, other putative pri-miRNAs, including miR394b
show evidence of splicing from both transcript coverage
and discontiguous mapping of whole transcriptome
reads.

Conclusions
We have used a combination of high throughput
approaches to show highly tissue specific expression of
mature miRNAs in the grapevine Vitis vinifera including
the first evidence of differential expression of miRNAs
during fruit maturation in this species. We have shown
that, for plants at least, whole transcriptome sequence
data can be applied to the detection of differential transcription of putative precursor miRNA loci and to the
detection and definition of pri-miRNAs as well as to the
tentative definition of patterns of splicing in such precursors. It is probable that similar analyses performed in
lines carrying mutations in genes involved in miRNA
processing (in particular DCL1- plants) will allow more
extensive and accurate definition of miRNA transcripts
on a large scale, eventually facilitating detailed analyses
of promoter sequences and a deeper understanding of
mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of miRNA
genes. Our analyses also suggest that splicing (and alternative splicing) of pri-miRNAs may be widespread and
might constitute a general mechanism for the regulation
of miRNAs.

was extracted with the Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit
(SIGMA) as directed by the manufacturer. RNA was
DNase treated with RQ1 RNAse-Free DNAse (Promega)
and RNA integrity was checked using an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer.
Total RNA samples from leaf, root, stem and callus
were processed using proprietary kits at Illumina, Inc. in
Hayward (CA, USA). Briefly, PolyA+ RNA was isolated
from total RNA fragmented using Ambion RNA fragmentation buffer. cDNA synthesis was performed with
Invitrogen random hexamer primers and cDNA was
purified using QIAquick PCR spin column (Qiagen).
Ends were blunted and 3’ A overhangs introduced using
T4 DNA polymerase and E. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment. cDNAs were ligated to adapters with a
single ‘T’ base overhang. After selection of 150-200 bp
fragments from 2% low-range agarose gel, samples were
amplified by 18 PCR cycles to enrich cDNAs with correctly ligated adapters and to amplify the amount of
DNA in the library. Samples were loaded on Cluster
Station to create flow cells of CSMA (Clonal Single
Molecular Array) and sequenced on the Illumina platform. RNA-Seq data are available from http://www.
genoscope.cns.fr/externe/gmorse/raw_data/.
Small RNAs (20-30 nt) were isolated from leaf total
RNA by a denaturing PAGE gel. Samples were prepared
for sequencing using proprietary kits at Illumina, Inc
(CA, USA). Briefly, 5’ and 3’-adapters were ligated to
small RNAs. After reverse transcription, a low number
of PCR cycles were used to create a sufficient amount of
cDNA constructs. cDNA sample was then loaded on the
Cluster Station and sequenced at ultra-high throughput
on the Illumina platform. Small RNA sequencing data
are available from the Short Reads Archive (SRA) under
accession number SRS005164.
For 454 transcriptome analysis, polyA+ RNA was isolated from V. vinifera L. cv Corvina leaf and berry tissues by according to Rezaian and Krake [52]. After
reverse transcription using an oligo(dT)-adapter primer
for first strand synthesis, cDNAs were amplified with 18
(leaf) and 17 (berry) cycles of LA-PCR [53]. Normalization was carried out by one cycle of denaturation and
reassociation of the cDNA. Reassociated ds-cDNA was
separated from the remaining ss-cDNA (normalized
cDNA) by passing the mixture over a hydroxylapatite
column. After hydroxylapatite chromatography, the sscDNA was amplified with 9 LA-PCR cycles using phosphorylated primers. cDNAs were finally purified using

the NucleoSpin ExtractII kit from Macherey & Nagel
and subjected to sequencing on the ROCHE 454 GS
FLX platform according to manufacturer’s instructions.
For oligonucleotide array analyses, total RNA was
extracted from V. vinifera L. cv Corvina tissues and
size fractioned, following the procedure [54] with
minor modifications. Before extracting RNA from berries, seeds were separated from the rest of the fruit.
Low molecular weight (LMW) RNA was checked for
quality and quantity using the NanoDrop Spectrometer
(ND 1000, Celbio SpA) and the Agilent 2100
Bioanalyazer.
Oligonucleotide arrays

Predicted grapevine miRNA precursor sequences have
been published elsewhere (Jaillon et al., 2007). A CombiMatrix 12 K CustomArray was synthesized with 1947
miRNA-specific probes synthesized to test grapevine
miRNA expression profiles.
For each grapevine miRNA precursor, we designed a
set of 20 -22 nt probes specific for the mature miRNA,
the miRNA* and their complementary sequences, as
well as a probe specific for the non mature microRNA
stem/loop region and probes designed on the miRNA
and miRNA* sequences but shifted of five or ten nt, forward and backward in order to test probe specificity.
snRNA U6 and four grapevine tRNA probes were used
as positive controls. Fourteen distinct negative and
mRNA degradation control probes were included. Additionally, for each specific probe, a mismatch control
with 2 maximally destabilizing substitutions was
included. Each probe was present on the final array in
three replicates. All probe sequences are available in
Additional File 2: Supplemental Table S6.
Slides were hybridized with 3 g of LMW RNA labeled
with Cy5 (Mirus LabelIT miRNA labeling Kit (Mirus
Bio Corp.)). Hybridization and washing were performed
as indicated by CombiMatrix. Slides were scanned with
a Perkin Elmer Scanarray 4000 XL raw data was
extracted with Scanarray Express 4.0 and Microarray
Imager (CombiMatrix) software. After each hybridization, slides were stripped according to manufacturer’s
instructions and re-used 5 to 6 times.
Two hybridizations were performed with independently extracted LMW RNAs, for each sample. Background level was defined as the average signal of the
negative and degradation controls plus two times their
standard deviation. The ratio between intensities of the
perfect match probe and its mismatch probe (referred to
as PM/MM) was also used to estimate the reliability of
each signal. Probes with a median signal higher than
background and with PM/MM value higher than 1.2
were called as present. The normalization between
arrays was performed using the quantile normalization

Mica et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:109
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/109

method [55] using the BLIST software, provided by
Combimatrix.
Normalized signals were Log2 transformed and probes
with a low PM/MM ratio (<1.2) were discarded. Differentially expressed genes in various tissues were identified with a one-way ANOVA test (p-value < 0.05).
Significant results were further investigated with Scheffè
test, a post hoc test to define which tissues showed significant differences.
The use of short RNA probes has not proven to be
effective to distinguish between miRNAs that have few
differences, in particular at the first or last nucleotide
[33], therefore microarray data from closely related miRNAs have been treated as replicated data. Thus different
miRNA precursors that give rise to almost identical
mature products have been clustered as single entities.
Complete oligonucleotide array experimental design
and data are available from the Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO: GSE13801].
RACE experiments

Total RNA was extracted from V. vinifera L. cv Corvina leaves, using a rapid CTAB method, as described
[56], with minor modifications, and DNAse treated
(DNase I from Sigma). The FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit
(Ambion) was used to perform classic 3’ and 5’ RACE
protocols, following manufacturer’s instructions. PCR
products, obtained with gene specific primers
(miR482-5’-Rout-CGGCATAGGATCTGAGTCCAC,
miR482-3’-Finn-AGGAAGAATGGTGGATTCATTA,
miR394b-5’-Rout-CCTCTTTTGTGGCTGTGAGATG,
miR394b-5’-Rinn-TGAAAGAGGCAAAGAGGAGGAG,
miR394b-3’-Fout-CAATCTCTCTCGCTCTTCCACT,
miR394b-3’-Finn-ACATCTCACAGCCACAAAAGAG,
miR162-5’-Rout-GAATTTGGCGTTGTGATGCTAC,
miR162-5’-Rinn-AGAAGAACACAGGGCGGATCT,
miR162-3’-Fout-AGACTCTGGTAGCATCACAACG,
miR162-3’-Finn-GGTTTATCTTCCGATGGAGAAC),
were subsequently cloned in pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced.
Bioinformatics methods

For small RNA deep sequencing, initial reads of length 33
bases were scanned for the presence of the 5’ part of the
3’ linker sequence 5’-TCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG3’ allowing 2 mismatches. Raw sequences whose last 9-14
bases represented the first 9-14 bases of the 3’ cloning
primer were mapped to the draft genome sequence after
removal of adaptor sequences using the software SOAP
[57]. Whole transcriptome Illumina reads were mapped
to the Vitis vinifera genome using the software SOAP.
Counts of reads mapping to defined genomic loci and
all statistical analyses of cluster densities were performed using custom scripts written in PYTHON.

Page 13 of 15

For Illumina transcriptome data, we estimate the
probability that at least the observed number of reads
should be clustered in the genomic interval defined by
the precursor using the Poisson distribution. Thus, we
exclude all reads mapping to predicted genes, and
search for significant violations (at the 1% confidence
interval) of the null-hypothesis that remaining reads
should be distributed randomly among intergenic
regions. We consider only reads mapping uniquely to a
single genomic locus. Given the expected short half-life
of most primary miRNA transcripts, we believe that
these criteria constitute an extremely conservative test
of precursor expression.
For the genomic regions containing predicted miRNA
precursors, we used ad-hoc PYTHON scripts exploiting
the MatPlotLib library to plot, for each base the log of
the coverage (normalized to the expected coverage
under a null model of random distribution). Thus only
values above zero reflect higher than expected numbers
of transcript-derived matches.
Python scripts were used to generate PSSMs for U2
splice donors and acceptors (3 exonic bases, 14 intronic
bases) and aggregate log scores were used to assign
scores to all possible canonical splice donors and acceptors. Custom PYTHON scripts were used to combinatorially generate putative splice junctions and SOAP was
employed to map RNA-Seq reads that did not provide
contiguous perfect matches to the genome sequence to
such junctions.
454 and RACE reads were mapped to the Vitis vinifera L. genome sequence using preliminary Blast
searches and fine mapping of splice junctions was performed using SPIDEY [58] with default settings for
plant sequences. Only reads where over 85% of the read
length was aligned at over 95% identity were considered.
