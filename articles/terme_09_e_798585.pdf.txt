Abstract
The palindromic sequence motifs (CANNTG) known as E boxes are considered as binding sites
for the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) class of DNA-binding proteins. Their presence has been
reported in the long terminal repeats (LTR) of the HIV-1 and HTLV-1 proviruses. Their close
proximity with the TATA region of both LTRs indicates that the bHLH proteins may act as
important regulators of the function of proviral transcription. Indeed, observations on HIV-1 and
recent results on HTLV-1 underline that these E boxes may be critically involved in the regulation
of the proviral transcription of these human retroviruses. Indeed, of the two E boxes flanking the
TATA sequences of the HIV-1 provirus, the 3' E box has been implicated in the transcriptional
inhibition of viral gene expression. Such a role might also be played by the unique 5' E box present
in the HTLV-1 LTR. In both cases, the expression of tissue-specfic bHLH proteins, like TAL1 might
counteract the inhibitory effect exerted by E box proteins, thereby increasing proviral
transcription. Finally, a phylogenetic study encompassing several subtypes of these two human
retroviruses underlines that these E box motifs have recently appeared in the proviral LTRs and
may be considered as potential mediators in the establishment of proviral latency.

Introduction
The two prototypic human pathogenic retroviruses HIV-1
(Human Immunodeficiency Virus, type 1) and HTLV-1
(Human T cell Leukaemia Virus, type 1) infect their hosts
on a long-term basis that relies on their abilities to infect
latently specific cellular subsets, such as memory CD4+ T
cells. These viruses are thus able to efficiently escape the
immune responses as well as the effects of anti-retroviral
drugs that are included in highly efficient therapeutic protocols. Consequently, understanding the mechanisms

that promote the establishment of latency is critical to the
design of future therapies. A promising avenue of investigation is the search for host factors that would decrease
proviral transcription. Hence, by considering data on HIV1 and recent results on HTLV-1, we discuss lines of evidence showing that bHLH proteins may critically intervene in the proviral transcription of these two human
retroviruses. Such an intervention is made possible
through the presence of E-boxes in the long terminal
repeats (LTRs) of the respective provirus.

Discussion
The consensus hexanucleotide sequence known as the Ebox motif (5'-CANNTG-3') represents the core DNA
sequence capable of binding the basic helix-loop-helix
(bHLH) class of proteins [1,2]. These proteins contain a
basic DNA-binding region juxtaposed to the HLH domain
that functions in protein dimerization. bHLH proteins
include ubiquitous (class I, e.g. E47) and tissue-specific
(class II, e.g. TAL1) transcription factors and play a prominent role in regulatory networks that control a diversity of
processes from cell proliferation to cell differentiation.
They can form homodimers or heterodimers with class II
bHLH proteins and can act as transcriptional activators or
repressors through the recruitment of distinct co-activator
or co-repressor complexes, respectively [2,3]. Accordingly,
the presence of E boxes in the LTRs of HIV-1 and HTLV-1
underlines the possible intervention of bHLH proteins in
regulating proviral transcription.
E box motifs in the LTR of human retroviruses
Indeed, four E box motifs have been described in the LTR
of HIV-1; two are located 11 base pairs (bp) upstream and
6 bp downstream of the TATA sequence [4,5]. These two
palindromic sequence motifs (CAGATG and CAGCTG)
have been referred to as the 5' E box and the 3' E box,
respectively [4]. More recently, the presence of a unique E
box sequence (CATATG) in the LTR of HTLV-1, located 28
bp upstream the TATA box, has been reported [6]. The
close proximity of these E boxes to the TATA region
appears to be specific to the LTRs of HIV-1 and HTLV-1. In
the 5' LTR of bovine leukemia virus, (an HTLV-1 related
retrovirus), three E box motifs overlapping the cyclic AMP
responsive elements (CREs) have been shown to be
involved in transcriptional repression of BLV basal gene
expression [7].

Disruptive mutagenesis experiments have underlined the
functional importance of the TATA sequences and the
flanking E boxes of the HIV-1 LTR, and more particularly
of the 3' E box in regulating basal and Tat-induced gene
expression [4]. Thus, it has been observed that one natural
clone of HIV-1 carrying two mutated E boxes exhibited a
high LTR basal activity in U937 cells [8]. More interestingly, experiments have been performed to characterize
the bHLH proteins that bind to these E boxes in order to
determine their role in the regulation of proviral transcription. Gel retardation analysis demonstrated that the specific binding of E box proteins (as either E47 homodimers
or HEB homodimers or HEB/E47 heterodimers), and AP4, a bHLH-ZIP protein, to the 3' E box of HIV-1 LTR [4,5].
Recently, the binding of AP-4 (and possibly other bHLH
proteins) to the 3' E box was found to exclude the binding
of TATA-binding proteins (TBP) to the TATA box and to
inhibit the LTR-mediated transcription of the HIV-1 provirus in vitro [4,9]. Consequently, E boxes in the LTR may

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/81

account for a modulation of viral replication, and even for
the establishment and maintenance of latency in HIV-1
infected cells. The presence of an E box motif in the LTR
of HTLV-1 and the observation that E47 was repressing
both basal and Tax-induced LTR activity suggest that this
bHLH protein indeed favors HTLV-1 proviral latency, possibly by interfering with the binding of TBP to the proximal TATA element [10]. The functional significance of the
HTLV-1 putative E box has not been assessed yet. However, the above observations suggest that these E boxes are
able to mediate the effect of bHLH proteins on the LTR
activity of human retroviruses. Of interest, the overlap of
E box elements and CREs in the BLV LTR has been proposed as a strategy to allow better silencing of viral transcription. In this model, suppression of viral gene
expression has been shown to contribute not only to the
impairment of immune surveillance, but also to the onset
and progression of lymphoid tumours in BLV-infected
sheep [11].
Collectively, these observations support that E box motifs
in the LTRs of HIV-1 and HTLV-1 might represent important mediators of proviral transcription, by allowing the
binding of bHLH proteins that might interfere with the
transcriptional complex recruited at the TATA element.
Consequently, some of these motifs would contribute to
post-integration latency by turning off proviral expression. Furthermore, epigenetic mechanisms could also be
implicated in the long-term suppression of viral expression, as E47 is known to bring chromatin-remodeling
complex to specific promoters and therefore could induce
epigenetic changes in proviral genome [12]. In return, that
inhibition could be relieved by the action of tissue-specific class II bHLH proteins, such as TAL1 (T-cell Acute
Leukemia 1), providing a way to exit proviral latency (Figure 1). Indeed, the binding of E47/HEB heterodimers to
the HIV-1 3' E box is abrogated by the over-expression of
a tissue-specific class II bHLH factor, TAL1, a functional
inhibitor of E proteins [13]. Similarly, the over-expression
of TAL1 is also able to counteract the E47 protein-mediated inhibition of the HTLV-1 LTR [10]. The regulation of
proviral transcription during the early steps of T lymphocyte maturation might, therefore, be an important
event contributing to the pathogenesis of this retroviral
infection [14,15]. As an alternative to this scenario, one
can imagine that the tissue-specificity of class II bHLH
proteins may be linked to the differential ability of retroviruses to establish post-integration latency. For example,
HIV-1 is known to establish latency in mature, but not in
immature thymocytes [16]. Such a difference may be
linked to the expression of TAL1 that is restricted to immature thymocytes. Clearly, much more experimental work
is needed to assess the functional significance of these E
boxes; however, the observations that have been devoted

provide valuable information on their involvement as
mediators of proviral latency and on the evolutionary significance of the mechanisms highlighted above. At the
scale of one to a few individuals, nearly all HIV-1 quasispecies exhibit intact E boxes (85 to 100% of intact E
boxes) [8,17,18]. At a larger phylogenetic scale, E box
mutants are strictly restricted to HIV-1 subgroups E, F and
G (most virological studies have been performed with
subtype B isolates) [19]. Interestingly, isolates of subtypes
E and G while accounting for less than 9% of all HIV-1
infections were found to display a two- to three-fold
higher LTR basal activity than those of subtype B, consistent with a role of the intact E box in decreasing viral
expression [19,20]. Thus, the presence of intact E boxes in
the HIV-1 LTR might account for a mechanism that regulates HIV-1 gene expression, as well as proviral latency.

Schematic representation of the proposed regulation
of the HTLV LTR by E box proteins. Binding of E box
proteins to the adjacent E box disrupts the interaction of
TBP with the TATA element and may inhibit basal expression
thus favoring proviral latency. In turn, the expression of a
bHLH class II protein (like TAL1) should interfere with the
binding of bHLH factors to the E box, thus restoring the
basal retroviral expression and turning off latency.

Considering that HTLV-1 replication occurs mainly by
clonal expansion of infected cells (rather than by reverse
transcription), this retrovirus is expected to lack intraindividual sequence variations. However, variations have
been observed at the population level. On the basis of
phylogenetic analyses, 6 groups of HTLV-1 (HTLV-1a to f)
have been identified [21]. As the early diverged HTLV-1c
sequences lack the putative E box [6], the ancestral state of
HTLV-1 should be characterized by the absence of a TATAneighbouring putative E box thus arguing for an active
proviral transcription and reverse transcription. Of note,
this putative E box (CANNTG) can only be found in the
LTR sequences of HTLV-1a and HTLV-1e (as deduced
from the analysis of alignments [6]). HTLV-1a, often
referred to as the Cosmopolitan clade, represents by far
the most widely distributed strain in HTLV-1 infected persons. It is striking to observe that an overwhelming majority (97%) of HTLV-1a isolates harbour this putative E box
(as deduced from the analysis of alignments [22]), suggesting a selection for this motif during evolution (Figure
2). Such an observation might suggest that the presence of
an E box might have contributed to the spread of the retrovirus, possibly by favouring the transcriptional repression of viral genes and thus facilitating virus- escape from
the host immune system. Indeed, such a strategy might be
critical to proviral maintenance via clonal expansion
which necessarily precedes leukemia development.

to delineate their intervention in the control of proviral
latency are suggestive of their critical contributions.

Conclusion

Evolutionary significance of E box motifs in the LTR of
human retroviruses
As outlined above, the functionality of the E box elements
needs further experimental evidence. Nevertheless, one
can already address their evolutionary significance
through the analysis of their distribution and conservation in LTRs of retroviruses that infect individuals, populations and species. Indeed such an analysis might

Even if HIV-1 and HTLV-1 have distinct characteristics and
strategies to survive in the infected T cells, the capacities of
these two human retroviruses to establish a latent infection is considered to be crucial for their pathogenesis.
HIV-1 latency has been described to occur at both preintegration and post-integration levels in infected CD4+ T
lymphocytes [23-25]. More specifically, the presence of E
box motifs in the HIV-1 LTR has been reported several
years ago and raised their implication in the transcrip-

mogenic process, during which the emergence of epigenetic events, such as LTR methylation [27,28], would in
turn favor the long-term suppression of LTR activity.
Finally and more importantly, evolutionary considerations also point out the potential importance of these E
box motifs in the LTRs of HIV-1 and HTLV-1. Clearly, they
plead for further functional investigation of the mechanisms involved in the recruitment of bHLH proteins to
the E boxes and of the importance of these motifs as mediators of proviral latency.

Mapping putative E-boxes (CANNTG) onto a global
HTLV-1 phylogeny. HTLV-1 strains have been gathered
into 6 groups of common ancestry (clades) named a to e,
with HTLV-1a being often referred to as the Cosmopolitan
clade [21]. This phylogenetic tree depicts the relationships of
127 strains (appearing as terminal, non-interior branches)
among which >100 belong to the Cosmopolitan clade (the
only pandemic HTLV-1 clade, solid line polygon). HTLV-1a is
here largely overrepresented, which fits the reality of the
pandemic; the other group distribution areas being much
more restricted (e.g. Central Africa). Putative E-boxes have
been mapped onto this phylogeny through the appending of a
color code (blue = CANNTG consensus sequence; black =
other sequences). This makes evident the presence of putative E-boxes in nearly all Cosmopolitan strains, which sharply
contrasts with the situation prevailing in the other clades.
This tree has been obtained through the analysis of a dataset
derived from Coulthart et al.[22].

tional regulation of the provirus. The E boxes in the LTR
of HIV-1 might represent the binding sites of positivelyand negatively-acting bHLH factors that arbitrate between
episodes of active viral transcription and silenced gene
expression [4]. Under these conditions, it is expected that
bursts of viral replication will expose infected cells to the
host's immune response, and lead to the gradual depletion of the CD4+ T-cell compartment, favoring immunodeficiency. Concerning HTLV-1, the primary infection is
considered as a two-step process involving a transient step
of reverse transcription followed by the Tax-induced polyclonal proliferation of infected cells, during genetic instability occurs [26]. Consequently, its is possible that E box
proteins (and particularly E47) could contribute to
decreased and silenced proviral transcription, that may
favor the selection of a restricted number of latentlyinfected clones that escape the immune response and survive the genomic insults. Thus, proviral silencing might
significantly contribute to the initiation of the leuke-
