Abstract
Background: Whether MHC molecules undergo concerted evolution or not has been the subject of a longstanding debate.
Results: By comparing sequences of eight functional homologues of HLA-E from primates and rodents with those
of MHC class Ia molecules from the same eight species, we find that different portions of MHC class I molecules
undergo different patterns of evolution. By focusing our analyses sequentially on these various portions, we have
obtained clear evidence for concerted evolution of MHC class I molecules, suggesting the occurrence of extensive
interallelic and intergenic exchanges. Intra-species homogenisation of sequences is particularly noticeable at the
level of exon 4, which codes for the α3 domain, but our results suggest that homogenisation also concerns certain
residues of the α1–α2 codomain that lie outside the antigen recognition site.
Conclusion: A model is presented in which Darwinian selective pressures due to pathogens could, at the same
time, favour diversification of MHC class Ia molecules and promote concerted evolution of separate loci by
spreading advantageous motifs arising by mutations in individual MHC molecules to other alleles and to other loci
of the MHC region. This would also allow MHC molecules to co-evolve with the proteins with which they interact
to fulfil their functions of antigen presentation and regulation of NK cell activity. One of the raisons d'être of the
MHC may therefore be to favour at the same time both diversification of MHC class Ia molecules and
homogenisation of the whole pool of MHC class I molecules (Ia and Ib) involved in antigen presentation.

Background
A major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is found in
the genome of all vertebrates from cartilaginous fish to

mammals. This region, which covers over two megabases
in the mammals where it has been studied [1], contains a
large multigene family that encodes the membranebound glycoproteins known as MHC molecules. These
molecules are not only crucial for establishing and controlling adaptive immune responses but also play important roles in many aspects of innate immunity. During
evolution, a bona fide MHC region first appeared with the
jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) and correlates with the
appearance of an adaptive immune system [2].

Schematic representation of the 'birth an death' and the 'conSchematic representation of the 'birth an death' and
the 'concerted evolution' models. In phylogenetic analyses, class Ia (solid boxes) and class Ib (hatched) molecules
within a species are more similar to each other than to class
Ia or class Ib molecules in another species. According to the
'birth and death' model, this reflects the propensity of MHC
molecules to derive from a single ancestral sequence by successive gene duplications. Another explanation, the 'concerted evolution' model, is that class Ia and class Ib molecules
tend to become like each other due to frequent events of
gene conversion, without necessarily deriving from a single
sequence.

MHC molecules are frequently classified into three major
groups. Firstly, class Ia molecules, also called classical
class I molecules, are expressed at high levels on the surface of most nucleated cells. They present peptide antigens, derived mostly from intracellular proteins, to CD8+
cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This targets for destruction cells
infected by intracellular pathogens, in particular viruses.
The extraordinary allelic polymorphism of class Ia molecules at the level of their peptide binding region (PBR) is
broadly perceived as a mechanism to counter the adaptive
capacity of viruses.
Second, class Ib, or non-classical class I molecules, are
usually expressed at lower levels than their classical counterparts, and show a more or less restricted tissue distribution. Within individual species, class Ib molecules exist in
either a single or a few different allelic forms, and this
relates to the fact that their role is to present ligands that
are much less subject to genetic variation than peptides of
viral origin [3]. Although this classification of MHC class
I molecules into classical and non-classical is quite convenient, it should be noted that, for certain MHC class I
molecules, the line between these two classes is difficult to
draw.

The best characterised class Ib molecules present the
leader peptides of class Ia molecules to natural killer (NK)
cells, that recognise them with their CD94-NKG2A and
CD94-NKG2B inhibitory or CD94-NKG2C activating
receptors. This allows the immune system to counter the
tendency of many intracellular pathogens to block the
production of MHC class I molecules [3]. These class Ib
molecules, which we will refer to as the CD94L family, are
called HLA-E in human, H2-Qa1 in mouse, and RT-BM1
in rat. Such CD94L molecules have been identified in all
rodent and primate species where MHC molecules have
been extensively characterised, which hints at their important role(s).
The CD94L are, however, not the only MHC molecules
regulating the lytic activity of NK cells: many other class Ia
and class Ib molecules are also involved, through interactions with numerous activatory and inhibitory receptors
on the surface of NK cells (see [4-6] for reviews).
The third group, class II molecules, are expressed mostly
on professional antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic
cells, macrophages and B cells. These molecules present
peptides processed from proteins of extracellular origin to
CD4+ regulatory T lymphocytes.
Although MHC molecules are encoded by the most rapidly evolving and polymorphic genes in vertebrate
genomes, the MHC is, curiously, also a site of extraordinary conservation as regards the structure and functions of
MHC molecules [7,8] as well as at the genomic level
[1,2,9]. The evolution of CD94L molecules being much
slower than their classical counterparts [10], this allows us
to decipher patterns of evolution that are apparently paradoxical. Many other multigene families probably
undergo processes similar to those we study here, but
would be much less apparent than in the very diverse and
actively evolving family of MHC class I molecules.
One of the most striking features of MHC class I molecules is that the sequences of classical (class Ia) and nonclassical (class Ib) MHC class I molecules within a species
are usually more closely related to one another than to
their respective homologues in other species (Fig. 1)
[11,12]. Two main hypotheses have been proposed to
explain this apparent paradox: the 'concerted evolution'
hypothesis and the 'evolution by birth and death' hypothesis.
The concerted evolution hypothesis, on the one hand, suggests that frequent gene conversion events (i.e. nonhomologous inter-locus recombination) homogenise the
various sequences within multigene families. This means
that the similarity among homologous genes is maintained over time, or will even tend to increase. Concerted

evolution is a universal biological phenomenon. In species ranging from eukaryotes (including mammals) to
prokaryotes, most multigene families thus far examined
undergo concerted evolution [13]. Sequence homogenisation through extensive gene conversion was initially proposed by Baltimore to explain the homology observed
between MHC genes within a species [14]. This hypothesis gained further support from Rada et al. when they compared sequences of rat and mouse MHC class I genes, and
found evidence suggesting homogenisation of sequence
motifs between distant loci on either side of the class II
region [15]. More recently, work by Edwards and others
has suggested that MHC molecules of birds could also
undergo concerted evolution [16]. Concerted evolution of
MHC molecules could explain why MHC molecules from
separate loci within one species can be like one another
without necessarily deriving from a common ancestral
locus.
The evolution by birth and death hypothesis, on the other
hand, proposes that strong homologies among MHC class
I genes within a species can only arise when the entire
class I gene pool re-evolves from a single sequence by successive gene duplications [11,12,17-19].
Historically, the two most likely, non mutually exclusive,
explanations for the intra-species homology found within
almost all multigene families have been gene amplification by repeated unequal crossing overs and gene conversion [20-22].
Genes for MHC molecules do indeed undergo very active
expansion ('birth') and contraction ('death'), as testified
by the extreme variability in the number of the various
loci coding for different MHC molecules, even within species [18,23,24]. For example, depending on the strains,
there are one or two functional class Ia loci in rats, two or
three in mice, and three in humans.
The genes for class Ia molecules are also remarkably
mobile within the MHC. For example, the human class Ia
loci HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C occupy completely different positions in the MHC than those for RT1-A molecules,
their functional homologues in rat. This gene 'jumping' is
probably the result of regional duplications followed by
loss of one of the original loci over the course of evolution. MHC genes therefore have an undeniable tendency
to duplicate and disappear [25,26], consistent with the
'birth and death' idea.
One particular observation is, however, difficult to reconcile with evolutionary processes based solely on birth and
death mechanisms as the sole explanation for the intraspecies homologies of MHC molecules: although the
CD94L molecules HLA-E and H2-Qa1 harbour certain

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/2

structural similarities and clearly have the same function,
HLA-E is, overall, more closely related to the human class
Ia sequences (HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C), and H2-Qa1 to
the mouse ones (H2-K, H2-D and H2-L). Given their
views that, within species, the pool of MHC class I genes
tends to derive by successive duplications of a single locus,
Yeager, Kumar and Hughes concluded that HLA-E and
H2-Qa1 must have arisen as a result of convergent evolution, i.e. that evolution produced molecules with similar
functions twice independently [27].
While we were documenting the sequence variability of
the rat CD94L class Ib molecule RT-BM1 among rat
strains, we compared the rat class Ia and CD94L sequences
to those of mouse and human [28]. In doing so, we
noticed that the sequences of exon 4 (which codes for the
membrane proximal α3 domain of the extracellular portion of class I molecules) were particularly similar
between class Ia and class Ib sequences within species. On
the other hand, comparing the sequences of exons 2 and
3 (coding for the PBR) of RT-BM1, H2-Qa1 and HLA-E
suggested an orthologous relationship between these
three genes, i.e. that all three molecules derived from a
common ancestor. The logical consequence of this assertion was that the α3 domain homologies observed within
each of the three species could only have arisen as a result
of concerted evolution, i.e. by homogenisation of separate
loci within species.
In this study, we have carried out a much more extensive
comparison of the sequences of CD94L from four primate
and four rodent species with those of class Ia sequences
from the same species. The results of these comparisons
allow us to conclude that separate loci for MHC molecules
do undeniably undergo concerted evolution within species, with different portions of the molecules evolving differently. Since the 'concerted evolution' and the 'birth and
death' hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, our results
are in agreement with a model where both phenomena
contribute to the homology of MHC molecules observed
within species. This leads us to discuss concepts of why
the MHC exists, and how it evolved and will keep evolving.

Results
HLA-E, H2-Qa1 and RT-BM1 occupy similar positions
within the MHC
Early comparative maps of the human and mouse MHC
placed the HLA-E locus in a much more telomeric position than the H2-Qa1 locus [for example, see Figure 3 of
[9]]. This contributed to the general perception that these
two loci were unlikely to occupy conserved syntenic positions, and were therefore unlikely to be orthologues (we
use this term to indicate that sequences derived from the
same ancestral locus). If the positions of invariant genes

indicated by blue dots corresponds to the footprint of the

within the MHC region are taken as a reference point [29],
however, the CD94L loci HLA-E, H2-Qa1 (also called H2T23) and RT-BM1 are all found in the very same genetic
location: the portion of the MHC class I 'island' between
GNL1 and RPP21 [30,31]. On the grounds of genetic mapping, therefore, there is no reason to believe that the pri-

Certain residues are CD94L-specific, and others are
homogenised within species
To investigate the evolutionary relationship between the
CD94L and class Ia loci, we searched the nucleotide database to identify species in which sequences were available
covering the whole extracellular portions (domains α1,
α2 and α3) of both CD94L and class Ia molecules. This
search yielded four rodent species [mouse (Mus musculus),
rat (Rattus norvegicus), Chinese hamster (Cricetulus griseus), deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatis)] and four primate species [human (Homo sapiens), chimpanzee (Pan
troglodytes), Rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), and cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus)]. CD94L and/or class
Ia sequences are available for many other rodent and primate species, but either as partial sequences, or only for
either a CD94L or class Ia molecule(s). Attempts to identify potential CD94L molecules in species outside of the
primate and rodent genera by homology searches in
sequence databases yielded no promising candidates (not
shown).

For each of the species listed above, in addition to the
CD94L sequence, we picked one representative of each of
the characterised class Ia loci. For the hamster and deer
mouse, because the definite locus information was lacking, we picked sequences that were as different from one
another as possible (two for hamster, and three for deer
mouse). To extend our investigation beyond the CD94Ltype class Ib molecules, we also included the rat RT1-M3
and mouse H2-M3 class Ib sequences. RT1-M3 and H2M3 are clear orthologues, and are both specialised in the
presentation of bacterial N-formylated peptides [32].
Altogether, we selected 29 sequences, and aligned the protein sequences of their extracellular domains (Fig. 2). All
these sequences are closely homologous to one another,
with no gaps or deletions in the alignment, and there is
perfect consensus between all the class I molecules at 87
positions (32.2%).
At 24 positions along the sequence (indicated by a blue
number above the alignment), some residues have clearly
been conserved among the CD94L molecules (in blue letters) within either the rodent or the primate orders (for
example, see positions 116 and 140 for rodent CD94L,
and 124 and125 for primate CD94L). At six of these positions (68, 69, 70, 143, 147, 155), the same residues are
found in either seven or all eight of the primate and
rodent CD94L sequences.
Given the previously reported observation that HLA-E,
H2-Qa1 and RT-BM1 are each more closely related to their

Identification of species-specific and CD94L-specific residues. Comparison of the CD94L protein sequences (blue)
with those of the class Ia molecules of their respective species (black). The sequences of the murine class Ib molecules M3,
which are orthologous between mouse and rat were also included (green). Sequences from rodent are on the top 15 lines, and
from primates on the lower 14 the alignment (see Materials and Methods for key to the abbreviations used). The 'pretty' output of the GCG software was used to generate this alignment of the MHC molecules extra-cellular portions (α1 domain: 1–90,
α2: 91–180, α3: 181–270). Positions in agreement with the consensus are indicated by -. The positions of CD94L-specific residues, i.e. those that were found in at least 3 of the 4 CD94L rodent or primate sequences and not in the corresponding class Ia
sequences are indicated by a blue number above the alignment. Conversely, certain residues were identified that differed from
the general consensus, but were common to all the sequences of at least one species. These positions, where intra-species
homogenisation has taken place, are indicated by a red number above the alignment.

respective class Ia counterparts, we also inspected the
alignment to get an idea of the localisation of the speciesspecific residues (Because the number of class Ia
sequences included in this alignment is very small compared to all those known in the different species, the list
of residues we identified in this manner should, however,
only be considered as indicative rather than exhaustive
and/or definitive). Such positions, where all the shown
class Ia and Ib sequences from at least one species are
identical to one another but diverge from the general consensus, are indicated by a red number above the alignment (for example, position 52 is a valine in all three
macaque sequences, and position 54 is an arginine in all
three hamster sequences). Fourteen such positions occur
within the first 180 residues, which corresponds to the
α1/α2 codomain that constitutes the PBR. There is very
little room for doubt that all four primate CD94L genes
descend from a common ancestral gene, and similarly for
all four rodent CD94L genes. Both in the primate and in
the rodent ancestral species, there must, therefore, already
have been a co-existence of the loci for ancestral CD94L
molecules and for ancestral class Ia molecules. The most
likely explanation for residues found in the class Ia and
CD94L molecules of only one species is the occurrence of
gene conversion between the various MHC class I genes in
that species, including those for class Ia and CD94L molecules, resulting in localised homogenisations, which
would ultimately lead to concerted evolution.
Remarkably, within the α3 domain, which separates the
PBR from the transmembrane domain (last 90 residues of
the alignment), 22 positions have evolved in a speciesrelated manner, and no single position is found among
either the rodent or primate CD94L groups despite the
fact that separate loci for class Ia and CD94L must have
pre-existed the species' radiation within each genus.
From these observations, we conclude that, at least for the
α3 domain, the CD94L have all undergone intra-species
concerted evolution with their respective class Ia molecules. This phenomenon is very evident among rodent
sequences, but it can also be observed within the primate
ones (e.g. at positions 182, 194 and 228). The identification of 14 positions along the α1/α2 codomain that have
undergone similar intra-species homogenisation further
suggests that this type of phenomenon is likely to be true
also of sequences outside exon 4.
Different topological distributions of the CD94L- and
species-specific residues
We analysed the locations on the MHC class I molecule of
those residues that have been conserved among CD94L
molecules and those that evolve in a species related manner (Fig. 3A and 3B). The residues that appear to undergo
intra-species concerted evolution are all located outside

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/2

the PBR, whereas most of the residues that are conserved
amongst CD94L molecules are situated at positions
within the PBR. Three noticeable exceptions are positions
1, 90 and 91.
The observation that the residues of the α1/α2 codomain
that undergo concerted evolution mostly tend to occupy
positions on peripheral loops suggests that these positions may correspond to sites of interaction of the class I
molecules with other proteins.
Remarkably, most of the α3 domain residues that have
undergone concerted evolution occur furthest away from
the PBR (Fig. 3B), and a handful of others lie at the CD8
interaction site (area indicated by a blue dotted oval) [33].
According to the recent report by Mitra et al[34], MHC
class I molecules are not 'standing up' on the plasma
membrane as is generally presumed, but adopt a supine
position, as shown here. In this conformation, the portion
of the α3 domain where residues have a strong tendency
to undergo concerted evolution would be eminently
accessible to interactions with one or several molecular
partners.
Different portions of MHC class I molecules undergo
different patterns of evolution
Using the protein alignment in Figure 2, we carried out
successive phylogenetic comparisons focusing on various
portions of the proteins. The tree shown in Figure 4A is a
graphical representation of the widely accepted divergence pattern of the eight species in this study, together
with the divergence times estimated according to the fossil
record. We first compared the entire extracellular portions
(270 amino acids; α1+α2+α3 domains) of the 29
sequences together with the pig class Ia sequence SLAI
(used as an 'outlier') (Fig. 4B). Our findings confirm the
previously reported observation that class Ia molecules
(red) and class Ib molecules (blue and green) co-segregate
within an order [11,12].

Among the class Ia molecules the only orthologous relationships suggested by this analysis are between the
human and chimpanzee B loci (HLA-B07 and Patr B), and
human, chimpanzee and macaque A loci (HLA-A2, Patr
A2 and Mamu A01), with no locus orthology suggested
within rodents. Among the class Ib molecules, however,
the independent groupings of CD94L sequences for primates and for rodents establishes beyond reasonable
doubt that, within each group, all four loci must derive
from a common ancestral CD94L locus. The fact that the
comparison of primate sequences strongly suggests that
the four CD94L are orthologues, whereas this is much less
clear for the corresponding class Ia sequences confirms
previous reports that primate CD94L molecules are much
more evolutionarily conserved than are class Ia molecules

[10,35,36], and extends this observation of high conservation to rodent CD94L and to the M3 class Ib molecules
found in mouse and rat. If HLA-E and H2-Qa1 arose by
convergent evolution, this must not only have taken place
earlier than the intra-order species divergence, roughly 50
million years ago, and after the primate-rodent split 100
million years ago.
Given the observations collected from the sequence alignment in Figure 2, which suggested that the sequence of the
α3 domain may evolve differently from that of the α1/α2
codomain, we next generated phylogenetic trees to compare separately the evolution of these domains (Fig. 5).

Comparison of the α3 domains reveals a strong tendency
of the class Ia sequences (red) and class Ib (blue and
green) to group by species. This observation confirms our
earlier conclusion from direct inspection of the sequence
alignment;i.e. that concerted evolution within species
does clearly take place between class Ia and class Ib
sequences, at least for the sequences of the α3 domains.
This is supported with very strong significance by the
groupings of the tamarin and hamster CD94L molecules
with their respective class Ia counterparts rather than with
their respective primate and rodent CD94L functional
homologues. The clade containing all the murine MHC
molecules, class Ia, M3 and CD94L also provides a further

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/2

clear proof of the intra-species homogenisation of the α3
domains, although, in this latter case, the H2-Dd molecule
clusters with the rat MHC class Ia sequences rather than
with those of other mouse class Ia.

by both class Ia and CD94L molecules, however, we
believe that concerted evolution within species could
occur significantly for these ROARS, thereby also contributing to the sequences' tendency to group by species.

We then constructed a phylogenetic tree for the first 180
amino acids that constitute the α1–α2 codomain (Fig 5B).
The most remarkable difference between the tree shown
in Figure 4B and this one is that the removal of the species-specific sequences of the α3 domain results in the
rodent and primate CD94L molecules (blue) falling much
closer together, and away from the clades of their respective class Ia counterparts. This finding already suggests
that these two sets of class Ib molecules may well share a
common ancestor.

Gene conversion can result in the transfer of as few as half
a dozen nucleotides to as many as several hundred [37].
For the sequences coding the α1–α2 codomain, the interspersed arrangement of PBR and ROARS residues must
greatly influence the size of the DNA segments that can be
exchanged to result in ROARS homogenisation. For class
Ib molecules, the need to preserve their defined antigenbinding specificity would mean that PBR residues could
not undergo gene conversion with other loci. The size of
the DNA segments being exchanged would then be limited to those fitting in between PBR residues, resulting in
a slower rate of evolution than for the α3 domain, where
the size restriction would not apply. For class Ia molecules, however, the very intense evolutionary processes
that drives their PBR residues towards heterogeneity
would result in an acceleration of the homogenisation of
ROARS compared to the α3 domain residues.

The presence of the rat and mouse M3 molecules (green)
on the same branch as the group of rodent CD94L could
indicate that the M3 and CD94L loci arose by gene duplication in a rodent ancestor before the rat-mouse divergence. An alternative explanation is that the CD94L and
M3 loci have coexisted long enough for concerted evolution to drive their homogenisation. Yet another interpretation – turning the tree on its head – is that the M3
molecules may not only go back a long time, but the structural requirements imposed by their function may be sufficiently tight that their evolution could have been much
slower than that of the other molecules on the tree. In this
case, these sequences would be closer to an 'ancestral'
MHC sequence, with the CD94L sequences moving
slowly away from it, and those of class Ia molecules much
faster. The clustering of the mouse H2-M3 α3 domain
sequence with those of hamster sequences rather than that
of other mouse sequences could be seen as a further, albeit
weak, argument in support of this argument.
Given the observation that certain residues of the α1–α2
codomain that are situated outside the PBR tend to evolve
by species, we carried out separate comparisons for those
67 residues that are generally considered as being
involved in the PBR, and for the 113 residues outside the
antigen recognition site (ROARS; see Materials and Methods for the precise list).
The tree obtained by comparing the ROARS (Fig. 6A) has
roughly the same overall structure as that derived from
comparing the three domains together (Fig. 4B), with the
rodent sequences clearly separated from the primates. The
class Ia molecules (red) have a strong tendency to cluster
by species, and the class Ib (blue) by function within each
order, the exception being Saoe E that clusters with HLAC. This clustering of class Ia loci by species is probably in
good part explained by gene duplication and contraction,
as proposed in the birth and death model [18]. Given our
observation of certain species-specific residues harboured

Comparison of this tree (Fig. 6A) to that for α3 domains
(Fig. 5A) indeed hints that class Ia ROARS sequences
homogenise even faster than their α3 domains. Firstly,
mouse H2-Dd falls among rat sequences in the α3 domain
analysis but clusters with the other mouse class Ia molecules for the ROARS. Similarly, the Mamu A01 sequence
clusters with human and chimpanzee A sequences for the
α3 domain but with the Mamu B04 sequence for the
ROARS (albeit with low support values).
When the 67 PBR residues are compared (Fig. 6B), all
CD94L (blue) fall in one clearly defined group. This
grouping could be explained either by convergent evolution, or by the fact that all eight CD94L genes derive from
a common ancestor. Since the murine and human CD94L
loci occupy conserved syntenic positions within the MHC,
and since concerted evolution can explain the homologies
of MHC class I sequences found overall within species, we
conclude that all eight CD94L molecules almost certainly
derive from a common ancestor, without the need to call
upon convergent evolution. A further argument supporting this conclusion is the arrangement of the CD94L
sequences on this tree that matches exactly the divergence
of the species (Fig. 4A). Comparison of the PBR of the
class Ia molecules (red) gives an indication of their exuberant evolution, with some primate sequences (Saoe 4,
Saoe 6, Saoe 8 and Mamu B04) intermingled with rodent
sequences (with, however, exceedingly low support values
for the branches), and Mamu-A01 resembling most
closely the pig class Ia molecule we picked as an outlier.
From this type of observation, we conclude that phylogenetic trees are not necessarily the best tool to decipher the

evolution of residues that undergo extremely rapid evolution such as the PBR residues of class Ia molecules.
The PBR residues of primate and rodent CD94L molecules
have been actively conserved from a common ancestral
sequence
Comparing the rates of synonymous versus non-synonymous (ds/dn) substitutions in nucleic acid sequences has
been used to great effect to investigate the nature of the
selective pressures that drive the evolution of MHC molecules, particularly to demonstrate that the PBR residues of
class Ia molecules are under positive selective pressure
[17]. If our conclusion that the rodent and primate

CD94L molecules derived from a common ancestor is correct, and the antigen presenting function of these molecule has been conserved for over 50 million years, then we
predict that their PBR residues would show signs of negative selective pressure.
To test this prediction, we carried out comparisons of synonymous versus non-synonymous substitutions for the
codons corresponding to the PBR residues. With this type
of analysis, sequences under negative selective pressure
are expected to have ds/dn values greater than 1, and
those under positive pressure less than 1. As can be seen
in Table 1, a comparison between the corresponding 19

class Ia sequences gave an average ds/dn value of 0.87,
confirming that PBR residues of class Ia molecules evolve
under positive selective pressure [17]. Conversely, the global average of the ds/dn values found for the eight CD94L
molecules was 3.02, suggesting negative selective pressure, or, in other words, that PBR residues have been
actively conserved in CD94L molecules since deriving
from a common ancestor. More importantly, we found
that the averages for inter-order and intra-order CD94L
comparisons were roughly comparable (3.40 and 2.78,
respectively), with an interspersed distribution of individual intra- and inter-order ds/dn values.

Although the statistical interpretation of this distribution
is difficult, it is certainly consistent with our conclusion
that all eight CD94L most likely derive from a common
CD94L ancestor molecule, and have all evolved under
similar global evolutionary pressures since the rodent-primate radiation that took place over 100 million years ago.

Discussion
Concerted evolution to reinterpret previous data
Since the polymorphism of the HLA-E locus apparently
predates most HLA-A and HLA-B polymorphism [10],
HLA-E can be considered as quite an ancient locus, which
fits with our conclusion that it must have been present in
the rodent/primate ancestor. In 1989, Hughes and Nei

individual pairwise comparisons (see MαM). For the sake of space and clarity, only the ds/dn values obtained for comparisons among CD94L
molecules are shown here, as well as their rank within those 406 comparisons. Values for intra-taxa comparisons are shown in bold (i.e. primate vs

pointed to a probable interlocus exchange of the whole
exon 4, coding for the α3 domain, between HLA-A and
HLA-E [38]. The sequence alignment shown in Figure 1 of
their paper (see Additional file 1), however, is more consistent with gene conversion than with an overall exon
swap by recombination between HLA-A and HLA-E. Over
the first 21 nucleotides of exon 4 (red box), HLA-E is
much more closely related to HLA-B, HLA-C and the Patr
B sequence than to HLA-A or Patr A. Over the following 93
nucleotides (blue box), all six sequences are almost completely homologous to one another. The relatedness of the
HLA-E α3 domain to those of HLA-A and Patr A is, in fact,
due almost entirely to eight sites in the subsequent 99
nucleotides where the HLA-B, HLA-C and Patr B
sequences diverge from these three sequences. The follow-

ing 12 nucleotides are completely homologous between
the six sequences (blue box), and over the last 48 nucleotides of exon 4 (red box), the HLA-E sequence matches
once again better with HLA-C than with HLA-A. Given
that the length of the DNA segments exchanged by gene
conversion can concern any number from less than 10 to
several hundred nucleotides [37], this 'mosaicism' of the
human and chimpanzee sequences is, therefore, much
more suggestive of events of gene conversion than of exon
swapping, and the extensive occurrence of such events
appears to be the most likely source of the concerted evolution we witness for the α3 domain.
The fact that gene conversion contributes to the diversity
of MHC molecules is broadly accepted. The frequency of

past gene conversion events in human and chimpanzee
MHC class I sequences was even evaluated statistically by
Kuhner et al. [39], and matching of the data on polymorphism obtained in mammals to mathematical simulations has suggested that the rate of allelic conversion is
relatively high [40]. Although gene conversion can contribute to the generation of new MHC class I alleles by
shuffling DNA sequence motifs, thereby enhancing heterogeneity, the very same mechanism can also result in
homogenisation of sequences within a multigene family.
Since gene conversion does not actually mutate DNA but
simply shuffles motifs between existing loci, we can see
that this phenomenon has no intrinsic effect on increasing or decreasing heterogeneity of individual residues.
What gene conversion actually does is to accelerate the
rate of evolution of MHC molecules, and it is the selective
pressures on the function of MHC molecules that must
drive certain portions of these molecules towards homogeneity or heterogeneity.
Concerted evolution and protein function
Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the fact
that MHC molecules are the most diverse and fastest
evolving genes in mammalian genomes, including pathogen driven evolution, high spontaneous mutation rate,
frequent gene conversion, mating preferences and
materno-foetal incompatibility [41]. These hypotheses are
not mutually exclusive and probably all contribute to a
certain extent to MHC diversity, but the main driving force
is clearly the stringent selective pressure imposed by infectious pathogens. Several models have been put forward to
explain how the pressure of fast evolving pathogens drives
MHC diversity, for example balancing selection, over
dominant selection and rare allele advantage All these
models are reviewed and discussed in a recent review by
Jeffery and Bagham [42].

In their turn, many pathogens have devised several clever
ways to block antigen presentation by making inhibitors
that bind either directly to MHC molecules outside the
PBR or to other molecular partners involved in antigen
processing, presentation and recognition [43,44], providing another level of selective pressure by pathogens on the
immune system. Many of these proteins [e.g. the transporter for antigen processing (TAP), tapasin, calnexin, calreticulin, beta 2 microglobulin (β2M), CD8 and the T cell
receptor for antigen (TCR)] must, therefore, also be under
considerable evolutionary pressure to evade these inhibitory mechanisms.
If a pathogen evolves to block the antigen presentation/
recognition pathway, individuals carrying mutations that
allow them to evade this blockage will have a sizeable
advantage to fight off the infection. Such advantageous
mutations might occur either in one of the multiple loci

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/2

coding for MHC class I molecules, or in one of the genes
encoding proteins involved in the antigen presentation/
recognition pathway (PRIAP). If a mutated form of a
PRIAP arises as a result of pathogen selection, one potential consequence would be that the pool of MHC class I
molecules in that species would no longer be optimally
suited to interact with that PRIAP mutant. Evolutionary
pressures would, in turn, favour individuals harbouring
MHC molecules adapted to interact better with these new
PRIAP forms. Such co-evolution has been reported for the
genetically linked TAP and MHC class Ia loci in the rat
[45] and the chicken [46]. In these circumstances gene
conversion could spread advantageous motifs between
MHC molecules within a given species, ultimately resulting in their concerted evolution.
In strong support of this model, in our study, all the positions evocative of species-specific evolution correspond to
residues that would be readily accessible to interactions
with other proteins, be they PRIAPs or inhibitors of antigen presentation derived from infectious pathogens (or
both). Regarding the remarkable congregation of speciesspecific residues in the portion of the α3 domain furthest
away from the PBR, this portion of MHC class I molecules
is known to be involved with interactions with the peptide-loading machinery; position 222 is involved in interactions with tapasin [47] and position 227 with
calreticulin [48]. Residue 182, which also undergoes intraspecies homogenisation, is located next to the site bound
by the inhibitory protein US2 from human cytomegalovirus [49]. Our observation that three positions in the α1–
α2 codomain that clearly lie outside of the PBR (1, 90 and
91) tend to be conserved among CD94L molecules could
indicate sites of interactions with partners specific to those
molecules, possibly with the CD94-NKG2 receptors
themselves.
NK receptors are amazingly diverse both within and
between species, and they have almost certainly coevolved with the MHC molecules they recognise [50-53].
Certain residues of MHC class I molecules that evolve in a
species-specific manner may therefore be involved in
interactions with NK receptors.
Our results suggest that, in MHC molecules, different subsets of residues are under different selective pressures. As
previously shown by Hughes and Nei, the PBR residues of
class Ia molecules, which present highly variable antigens,
are under positive selective pressure, favouring heterogeneity of their antigen-binding properties [17]. Conversely,
in class Ib molecules, which present precisely defined
antigens such as N-formylated peptides or the leader peptides of class Ia molecules, the same PBR residues are
under negative selective pressure to ensure maintenance
of function. Similarly, for class Ia molecules, the ROARS

Biology Direct 2006, 1:2

residues of the α1 and α2 domains undergo frequent gene
conversion and evolve fast, whereas in class Ib molecules,
which are less variable, the ROARS residues evolve more
slowly. We predict that the residues of the α3 domain will
evolve at similar rates in class Ia and class Ib molecules,
between those of the fast class Ia and the slow class Ib
ROARS.
By contributing to a better understanding of how MHC
molecules evolve, we hope that our results may help to
decipher where and how our adaptive immune system
arose, and keeps evolving in the face of the permanent
challenge of infectious organisms or, as the case may be,
the lack of them that may well favour allergic or autoimmune conditions.

Materials and methods
Protein and DNA sequences of MHC class I molecules
were all obtained from the database with the accession
numbers provided in table 2. Over the region studied (α1
to α3 domains encoded by exons 2, 3 and 4), we made
sure that all the sequences chosen had exactly the same
length, with no insertion of gaps necessary, since introducing gaps can affect the value of the comparisons
obtained [72]. We chose to compare protein rather than
nucleic acid sequences for three main reasons: i) this circumvents the concern about potential differences in G/C
contents at synonymous sites between class Ia and Ib
sequences [11,73], ii) The sequences are shorter, and
hence easier to compute, and the validity of the alignment
is much easier to ascertain iii) The comparisons incorporate degrees of similarity between residues, which seems
important when dealing with sequences under strong
selective pressures.
To assemble the list of residues taking part in the PBR, we
were careful not to be influenced by the observations collected from the alignment shown in figure 2. Rather, we
constituted a pooled list of all the residues that we could
find in the literature as allegedly taking part in the PBR
[27,74-76]. The resulting list of 67 residues is as follows:
5, 7, 9, 22–26, 34, 45, 57–59, 61–77, 80–82, 84, 95, 97,
99, 114, 116, 118, 123–124, 133, 143, 145–147 149–
152, 154–163 165–167 169–171. The 113 ROARS residues are those between 1 and 180 that are not in the
above list.
To generate the subset of residues for the various domains
and sub-domains, we made use of the Seaview software
[77], which is available for download from http://
pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/seaview.html.
Neighbour
Joining (NJ) trees were then drawn with the phylip option
of the clustalW software which can be downloaded
together with Seaview. Support values for branches were
obtained by 10000 boostrapping steps. For the sake of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/2

completeness of information, we chose to provide all the
values obtained. Values above 60% are usually considered
significant. Trees based on the same alignments were also
generated with the puzzle 5.2 software http://www.treepuzzle.de/[78], and gave very similar results to those
shown in this paper (data not shown). Many other trees
were also generated that incorporated many more MHC
class I sequences than the ones that were picked pretty
much at random for the work presented here. All these
trees always gave the same overall indications as the ones
shown here. We chose to present trees based on this
restricted number of sequences for the sake of simplicity
of presentation.
All trees were visualised with Treeview.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1
Stephan Beck
In their manuscript Joly and Rouillon report new evidence
for the hypothesis that MHC class I genes undergo concerted evolution through gene conversion (e.g. nonhomologous recombination). In support, they analysed 8
classical class I genes (termed class Ia) and 8 non-classical
class I genes (termed class Ib) from primates and rodents
with focus on three class Ib genes to which they refer to as
CD94L family (human HLA-E, mouse H2-Qa1 and rat RTBM1). The results are comprehensively discussed within
the context of various relevant hypotheses which adds a
review-like flavour and greatly enhances the appeal of the
manuscript.

Although some conclusions (and assumptions) are better
supported than others, I only take issue with one particular point. Based on evidence I do not agree with, the
authors assume the above mentioned CD94L family
genes to represent orthologues and their many respective
paralogues are not considered in subsequent analyses
which may have affected some of the conclusions.
Author response: Following this comment, and a suggestion
made by Pierre Pontarotti on the phone, I have now modified
the manuscript to remove the statement about 'the clear orthologous relationship of CD94L molecules within the primate or
the rodent orders'. This is now replaced by 'There is very little
room for doubt that all four primate CD94L genes descend
from a common ancestral gene, and similarly for all four rodent
CD94L genes'.
On page 12, for instance, the authors conclude that at
least the alpha 3 domains of the CD94L genes have all
undergone intra-species concerted evolution with their
respective class Ia molecules but not one of the 22 informative positions is shared across species as one would
expect for orthologues. The logic conclusion would have
to be that gene conversion did not occur in the ancestral

(e.g. pre 80 mya) CD94L genes studied here. This is
unlikely, as gene conversion has been demonstrated to be
a general mechanism clearly predating the species studied
here.
Author response: Thanks to the process of 'open refereeing',
I have been able to discuss this point with Stephan over the
phone directly. His comment sprouted from some slight misunderstanding, which has now been lifted.
The additional section (appended to main manuscript)
does not really constitute a separate manuscript but adds
further interesting points to the discussion and the key
points could be summarized and included in the main
manuscript.
Author response: The solution to this has been to remove a
sizeable portion of the discussion and to provide it as a clearly
separate manuscript.
The paper itself now focuses on the demonstration that HLA-E
and Qa1 are orthologues. It is now much shorter, easier to read,
and the message is, I hope, much clearer.

The accompanying paper is now clearly labelled as 'hypothesis',
and I have used it to regroup 4 topics of discussion touching on
different aspects of MHC evolution that derive from the results
obtained in the paper itself, but are not directly related to these
results.
Reviewer's report 2
Lutz Walter
In this paper, Joly and Rouillon compare major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes derived from
human, non-human primates, and rodents. Based on
multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree
reconstructions, the authors conclude that the MHC class
I genes in these species are subject to concerted evolution
by means of gene conversion.

One main point of criticism refers to the fact that not all
known MHC class I genes of the species studied here are
compared, and only a small extract from the full repertoire of class I genes was chosen for comparison. This may
bias the interpretation of data. In this respect, it might be
useful to concentrate on one or two species, e.g. the 'class
I-rich species, mouse, rat, or rhesus monkey. In its current
form, the paper contains data from a single mouse haplotype, but from several rat haplotypes. Thus, the data set
should also be updated to allow the study of both interand intralocus gene conversion.
Author response: One of the main challenges we faced when
we started to do the work that would allow us to write this paper
was not in terms of "How many sequences for MHC class I molecules can we collect and align ?". It was, in fact, exactly the
reverse, i.e. :" With how few sequences can we proceed to demonstrate, beyond reasonable doubt, that MHC class I loci do
undergo concerted evolution ?" All the figures presented in the
paper were obtained from the one alignment we settled for in
the end. Changing just one sequence in the list would require
performing the whole study all over again, which would represent several weeks of tenuous work.
Although our observations lead us to discuss many aspects
related to MHC evolution, evaluating the frequency of inter
and intra-locus conversion events was not within the remit of
this study. Regarding the choice of MHC sequences from several rat MHC haplotypes, and from a single mouse haplotype,
we do not see why this should have any relevance to the type of
work we have done, and to the conclusions we reach. Outside
of particular situation where genes can co-evolve because they
are closely linked (such as RT1-A and TAP), MHC haplotypes
are, after all, relatively artificial sets of genes that happened to
find themselves on the same chromosomal strand when inbred
strains were generated.
Starting with many more sequences, we would have faced the
following problems:

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/2

1) The alignment showed on Figure 2, which was used to generate the trees, could not have been provided within the manuscript. We also find that the clarity of figures containing trees
degrades rapidly when these trees have too many branches.
2) The computer time required for calculation of the trees and
of the ds/dn values grows exponentially with the number of
sequences, and the time spent generating the alignments and
the figures is also dependent on the number of sequences
included.
3) For the precise question we wanted to address, the only class
Ib loci that were informative were those identified in at least
two species. We also felt that it was best to restrict our analysis
to those molecules for which a function had clearly been documented, and which had the same number of amino-acids as
class Ia sequences (to avoid gaps in the alignment). When we
embarked on this work, the only class Ib loci fulfilling these criteria were the CD94L and the murine M3 molecules. As far as
we know, this is still true today.
page 16: the sister grouping of M3 and CD94L genes is
due to a limited data set (see above) and does not reflect
true phylogenetic relationship (and is not supported by
bootstrapping). Furthermore, it contradicts data by Hurt
et al. (2004) who studied the phylogenetic relationship of
all rat and mouse class I genes;
Author response: We are in complete agreement with the
statement that the grouping of M3 and CD94L does not necessarily reflect phylogenetic relationship, and this despite a bootstrapping value of 63% (with the methods used for these
comparisons, values above 60% are usually considered significant, and this is specified several times in the paper). Two alternative interpretations relating to this were (and still are)
proposed in the manuscript. We actually pointed to this feature
of the tree to underline our point of view that extreme caution
must be exerted when carrying out phylogenetic analyses of
members of multigene families that undergo extensive intergenic exchanges.
page 16 and more: it is not obvious why the authors introduce a new abbreviation for 'residues outside the antigen
recognition site (ROARS)' and do not use the widely
accepted 'non-PBR';
Author response: We chose to use ROARS because we think
it sounds better than 'non-PBR', and also because not all class
I molecules present peptides.
page 17, second paragraph: the authors should explain
how homogenisation can be afforded in non-PBRs, particularly at those sites where PBRs and non-PBRs alternate. Is
the degree of homology between the two sequences high
enough to allow gene conversion to take place?

Page 15 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:2

Author response: What we witness here are signs that are
very evocative of intra-species homogenisation, and gene conversion seems to be the most likely mechanism to explain this.
We have no way of knowing when these events took place, and
between what sequences (for example, some other genes, or
pseudogenes, could have served as relay between certain
sequences). Furthermore, although gene conversion is clearly
favoured between homologous sequences, we are not aware of
data documenting the minimal length of homologous sequences
required for gene conversion to take place. Outside of the fact
that this question seems to be way beyond the scope of our study,
we therefore would have no way of addressing this question.
I would not recommend adding of the additional section
into the manuscript, as the manuscript might become
'unreadable'. However, certain aspects of this "additional"
discussion section might be included in the manuscript.
Nevertheless, I would strongly recommend considerable
shortening of the manuscript.
In my opinion, this paper should be published, but
should be regarded as a 'hypothesis paper' as it contains
many assumptions, which were not proven by experimental evidence, and it contains many review-like sections.
Author response: As explained above, we have managed to
comply to these slightly contradictory recommendations (i.e.
including more points but shortening overall) by splitting the
paper in two: One 'real' paper with the results, and one hypothesis paper.
Reviewer's report 2
Pierre Pontarotti
This article hypothesizes that the Peptide Binding Region
of the mouse, rat and human Class I b, that presents the
leader peptide from the Class I a molecules to natural
killer cells, evolved from a common ancestor while the
non PBR part evolved via gene conversion.

The arguments are based upon phylogenic analysis and
upon the conserved location of these MHC class I b genes.
This contrasts with another hypothesis: the MHC class I
genes are lineage specific, they come from a common
ancestor which is different in the human and mouse lineage, (in other word class I gene from mouse and human
are paralogues), and HLA E and H2Qa1 PBR evolved via
convergent evolution...
In order to strengthen their hypothesis the authors should
screen other mammalian lineages using ensembl data
bases since some sequences of ensembl data base are not
obligatory present in NCBI NR, especially those from
canis, loxodanta, bos Taurus, canis Familirais and monodelphis (even if this species is out side of the eutherian

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/2

group). If an "HLAE like" PBR orthologue is found in all
these groups, the author hypothesis will be stronger supported.
Author response: We would indeed have been very interested
to identify MHC class I molecules with CD94L-like PBR outside of the rodent and primate genera. As was already indicated
in the result section entitled "Certain residues are CD94L-specific, and others are homogenised within species" (on page 10
of the current manuscript), we have repeatedly tried to identify
such molecules via several approaches in all the online databases available to us, and, as of 20 Dec 2005, we have not succeeded so far.
Second if the conversion of the non PBR HLA E like gene
is an ongoing process, this could be seen at higher taxonomic level, for example at primate level by comparing
human chimp and macaque MHC class I genes: more
homogenization should be seen outside the "HLA E like"
PBR than within the PBR.
Author response: This is indeed exactly what we see, and this
is discussed on page 18 of the manuscript (Comparison of this
tree. low support values)
Other comments
Concerning the sentence page 14 L 11: Among the classI B
...years ago. I do not understand why the results confirm
that CD94L molecules are much more evolutionary conserved than Class I a molecules.
Author response: This was indeed confusing, and I have tried
to clarify this point by writing the following sentence:
"The fact that the comparison of primate sequences strongly
suggests that the four CD94L are orthologues, whereas this is
much less clear for the corresponding class Ia sequences confirms previous reports that primate...".

Additional material
Additional File 1
Comparison of primate α3 domains suggests past gene conversions
rather than whole exon exchange. This figure is reproduced from Figure
1 in [38]. Areas boxed in red indicate zones where the HLA-E sequence
matches better with HLA-Cw1, and in green with HLA-A3. Over the
zones marked in blue, all six sequences are so homologous to one another
that no grouping is suggested.
