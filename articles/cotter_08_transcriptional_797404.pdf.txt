Abstract
Background: Very little is known about the immunological responses of amphibians to pathogens
that are causing global population declines. We used a custom microarray gene chip to characterize
gene expression responses of axolotls (Ambystoma mexicanum) to an emerging viral pathogen,
Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV).
Result: At 0, 24, 72, and 144 hours post-infection, spleen and lung samples were removed for
estimation of host mRNA abundance and viral load. A total of 158 up-regulated and 105 downregulated genes were identified across all time points using statistical and fold level criteria. The
presumptive functions of these genes suggest a robust innate immune and antiviral gene expression
response is initiated by A. mexicanum as early as 24 hours after ATV infection. At 24 hours, we
observed transcript abundance changes for genes that are associated with phagocytosis and
cytokine signaling, complement, and other general immune and defense responses. By 144 hours,
we observed gene expression changes indicating host-mediated cell death, inflammation, and
cytotoxicity.
Conclusion: Although A. mexicanum appears to mount a robust innate immune response, we did
not observe gene expression changes indicative of lymphocyte proliferation in the spleen, which is
associated with clearance of Frog 3 iridovirus in adult Xenopus. We speculate that ATV may be
especially lethal to A. mexicanum and related tiger salamanders because they lack proliferative
lymphocyte responses that are needed to clear highly virulent iridoviruses. Genes identified from
this study provide important new resources to investigate ATV disease pathology and hostpathogen dynamics in natural populations.

Background
Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) pose a serious threat
to the health, stability, and persistence of human and
wildlife populations [1-4]. Genetic and genomic tools

have been incredibly useful for discovery of genes associated with host response and variation in resistance or susceptibility to a variety of pathogens [5-7]. The advent of
genomic tools such as microarray analysis has offered new

insights into host-pathogen systems. Additionally, their
application to genomic response to host disease response
allows rapid characterization of candidate genes for further research into control and eradication methods.
EIDs are a leading hypothesis for the global decline of
amphibians and two pathogens in particular, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and Ranaviruses have been
implicated in worldwide epizootics. Although studies are
beginning to investigate possible mechanisms of resistance to these pathogens [8], in general, very little is known
about the immune response of amphibians to EIDs. This
is because most natural amphibian species are not used as
laboratory models and we lack fundamental molecular
tools to investigate disease pathology and host-pathogen
interactions at the molecular level for all but a few species
(e.g., Ambystoma tigrinum spp., Xenopus spp.).
Over the last 15 years, Ranavirus infections have been
associated with marked increases in morbidity and mortality in fish, reptiles, and amphibians [9]. Ranaviruses are
globally-distributed double-stranded, methylated DNA
viruses of fish, amphibians and reptiles and are implicated in amphibian epizootics worldwide [9-11]. Both
encapsulated and non-encapsulated forms can be infectious. The virus enters the cell via receptor mediated endocytosis or via fusion with the plasma membrane; and
DNA and RNA synthesis occur in the nucleus, while protein synthesis occurs at morphologically specific assembly
sites in the cytoplasm [9]. In North America, ranaviruses
have been isolated from the majority of recent documented amphibian epizootics [12], including from tiger
salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) epizootics in Saskatchewan, Canada [13], Arizona [14], North Dakota,
Utah, and Colorado, USA [15,16]. The viral variant that
infects tiger salamanders, ATV, is transmitted either via
direct contact with an infected animal or immersion in
water that contains virus and infected individuals exhibit
systemic hemorrhaging, edema, ulceration, and necrosis
of the integument and internal organs [13,17,18]. In cases
where ATV infection leads to mortality, it usually occurs
within 2–3 weeks of exposure, with animals displaying
symptoms often between 8–10 days post-exposure. Thus,
ATV can rapidly overwhelm the tiger salamander immune
response. However, mortality is not always a pathological
endpoint because virulence and resistance are known to
vary among ATV strains and tiger salamander populations, respectively, as indicated by both laboratory experiments and field observations [19]. Research
characterizing the tiger salamander genomic response to
ATV is needed to better understand the pathology, virulence, and possible mechanisms of resistance to this
emerging disease.

The tiger salamander species complex includes A. mexicanum (Mexican axolotl), a model organism with a growing
genomic and informatics resource base [20]. The immune
system of the Mexican axolotl has been extensively studied using several classical approaches. Relative to other
vertebrate models, the axolotl immune response has been
described as immunodeficient [21,22]. There are several
reasons for this characterization, including: production of
only two immunoglobulin (Ig) classes, only one of which
regulates the humoral response and neither of which is
anamnestic [23,24]; no response to soluble antigens [25];
poor mixed lymphocyte reactions [26,27]; and lack of cellular cooperation during the humoral immune response
as indicated by enhanced humoral immunity following
thymectomy or X-ray irradiation [28,29]. Weak immune
responses are known for salamanders in general, and the
Mexican axolotl and related tiger salamanders are especially susceptible to ATV infections with high observed
mortality rates both in the laboratory and in the field.
Indeed, an outbreak of ATV in 2003 at the Indiana Axolotl
Colony significantly reduced adult stocks before the virus
was contained. By way of comparison, adult Xenopus effectively clear close-related FV3 Ranavirus with an immune
response that includes an early T-cell proliferative phase
in the spleen [30].
To further investigate the axolotl immune response to
ATV, we used an Affymetrix custom microarray to identify
genes that were significantly, differentially expressed in
the spleen. We then compared these genes to a list of
genes associated with regeneration that were previously
identified from A. mexicanum using the same microarray
platform. We reasoned that such a comparison would
allow us to filter gene expression responses of humoral
cells induced generally in response to injury and stress
from those expressed specifically in response to ATV infection. Also, this comparison would potentially identify
gene expression signatures associated with cell proliferation in response to ATV, as we have previously identified
many cell proliferation probe sets on the Ambystoma genechip that are differentially regulated during spinal cord
regeneration [31]. The genes that we describe provide
mechanistic insights and new tools to investigate salamander antiviral responses in the laboratory and in natural populations.

Methods
Animal care and surgery protocols
Inbred A. mexicanum eggs from a single full-sib mating
were obtained from the Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center
at the University of Kentucky. Each A. mexicanum egg and
larva was reared in an individual container in aquifer
water treated with ReptiSafe and changed weekly. Individuals were fed brine shrimp ad libitum for the first four
weeks post-hatching and blackworms (Tubifex) ad libitum

thereafter. Animals were reared in an environmental
chamber on a 12:12 h light:dark cycle at 20°C. At 4.5
months of age, 12 individuals were injected with 100 μl of
106 p.f.u./ml of ATV isolated from the axolotl colony and
suspended in cell culture medium. This amount of virus
was determined to be the minimum lethal dose via injection in previous unpublished experiments (Storfer,
unpublished data) and the strain utilized in the experiment was extracted from axolotls that had previously been
infected and killed by the virus. Simultaneously, four
uninfected (control) individuals were sacrificed in MS222
for spleen and lung removal. Spleens from all animals
were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The same surgical
procedure was performed on four infected individuals following 24, 72 and 144 hours of infection. Spleen tissue
was utilized due to its previously noted importance in
CD8+ T cell immune responses to Ranaviruses, particularly FV3, in frogs [30] Additionally, spleen is an important immune organ as antigens from the blood are
processed in the spleen. Lung tissue was removed for viral
quantification as it is an internal organ that can be utilized
in early stage virus quantification (Stewart, unpublished
data).

with all GeneChips simultaneously. Upon conducting
these probe level analyses, we background corrected, normalized, and summarized all sixteen GeneChips using the
Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) algorithm [36]. Following this, we calculated correlation matrices for replicate GeneChips (four correlation matrices with four
GeneChips per matrix; all r from replicate GeneChips >
0.980) on the summarized probe-set level data. The
strong correlations observed between replicate GeneChips
suggests that we were able to obtain a high degree of
repeatability within treatments.

During the infection period behavioral observations were
taken opportunistically. Total RNA was extracted from
spleen with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA isolations were further purified
using RNeasy mini columns (Qiagen). The amount of
RNA present in each isolate was determined via UV spectrophotometry, and RNA quality was inspected via a 2100
Agilent Bioanalyzer. Sixteen high quality isolates (four
replicates at each of four sampling times: 0 (controls), 24,
72, and 144 hours post-infection) were used to make individual-specific pools of biotin labeled cRNA probes. Each
of the 16 pools was then independently hybridized to an
Amby_001 custom Affymetrix GeneChip (for a more
detailed description of the microarray platform see [31]
and [32]). The University of Kentucky Microarray Core
Facility generated cRNA probes and performed hybridizations according to standard Affymetrix protocols.

Identifying Differentially Expressed Genes
We used the Bioconductor package LIMMA [38,39] to
generate moderated t-statistics for all six of the possible
pair-wise contrasts of the four sampling times investigated
in our study. LIMMA employs an empirical Bayes methodology that effectively shrinks the sample variances
towards a pooled estimate. This approach reduces the
likelihood of obtaining large test statistics due to underestimation of the sample variances. The moderated t-statistics generated by LIMMA test the null hypothesis that the
difference between the two groups being compared is zero
(i.e., group 1 – group 2 = 0). LIMMA also generates moderated F-statistics that test the null hypothesis that none of
the contrasts within a family of contrasts are statistically
significant. We corrected for multiple testing by applying
the step-up algorithm [40] to the P-values of the moderated F-statistics associated with our six contrasts. Upon
correcting for multiple testing, we identified 2322 genes
(probe-sets) that were statistically significant. To prioritize
amongst differentially expressed genes, we focused on
probe-sets that exhibited two-fold or greater changes at
any time-point relative to controls. Any gene that was
non-significantly down-regulated but significantly up-regulated at one or more time points was considered up-regulated, and vice versa for classification of up- versus
down-regulation. We also required that these probe sets
have moderated F-statistics greater than or equal to the
50th percentile of the 2322 F-statistics from the statistically
significant probe-sets (F ≥ 12.68). We further limited our
analysis to only those probe sets that exhibited significant
sequence identity with a human reference sequence. We

Quality Control and Data Processing
All quality control and processing analyses were done in R
[33]http://www.r-project.org. We used the Bioconductor
package "affy" http://www.bioconductor.org to perform
several quality control analyses at the individual probe
level [34,35]. These analyses included: (1) viewing images
of the log(intensity) values of the probes on each GeneChip to check for spatial artifacts, (2) investigating measures of central tendency and dispersion by viewing boxplots and histograms of all the GeneChips, (3) viewing
pair-wise M versus A plot matrices for replicate GeneChips, and (4) viewing an RNA degradation plot [35] that
enables the visualization of the 3' labeling bias associated

Data Filtering
Microarrays may not accurately quantify the abundance of
lowly expressed genes [37]. Calculating statistical tests for
such genes adds to the multiple testing burden that is
inherent to microarray studies. To address this issue, we
filtered genes whose mean intensity across all 16 GeneChips was greater than the mean of the lowest quartiles
(25th percentiles) across all GeneChips (n = 16, mean =
5.83, SD = 0.06; data presented on a log2 scale). Upon
imposing this filtering criterion, 3619 probe-sets were
available for significance testing.

note that 263 probe-sets with no functional annotation
were statistically significant, differentially expressed by ≥
two-fold, and had F-values ≥ 12.68.

between 24, 72, and 144 hours post-infection, and all
time points were significantly different from all other time
points (F3,44 = 242.56; p ≤ 0.01).

Clustering
Hybridization intensities were averaged within treatment
groups (0, 24, 72, and 144 hrs post-infection) and log2
ratios were calculated for each non-zero sampling time
relative to 0 hours post-infection. Genesis v. 1.6.0 [41,42]
was used cluster these log2 ratio data and to generate heat
maps. Clustering was conducted using a Self Organizing
Map (SOM) algorithm. Default conditions were used with
the exception that the SOM was allowed to run for
263,000 iterations. The dimensions of the final SOM are
2x *1y. These dimensions were determined by comparing
output from several different combinations.

No animals displayed any gross symptoms of ATV infection in terms of hemorrhaging, lesions or edema, either
externally or on any internal organs upon euthanasia and
subsequent surgery. Similarly, there were no notable
changes in behavior observed during the period of infection. This is likely due to the relatively short infection
period utilized in this experiment. As noted in the introduction, infected animals often take 8–10 days, or more,
to become symptomatic upon infection.

Enrichment Analyses
Functional annotation of genes by gene ontology was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization
and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, [43]). Functional
annotation clustering was performed using the default settings with the exception of using the highest classification
stringency.
Quantitative real-time PCR
We used quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to confirm
the results of the microarrays. We estimated a fold change
for 24 and 72 hr time points using the ΔΔct method of relative quantification [44], utilizing ribosomal protein L 19
as an endogenous control gene. The same total RNA that
was used for microarray analysis was used to create cDNA
for qPCR using the BioRad iScript cDNA synthesis kit, following manufacturer instruction. Primers for the qPCR
were designed using Primer Express 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). Primers were designed to encompass the sequence
of GeneChip probe sets (Additional file 1). qPCR was
accomplished using SYBR Green chemistry.

To verify that exposed animals were infected and to quantify viral load and replication over time, we performed
qPCR on lung tissue with TaqMan chemistry following
the protocol detailed in [45]. ANOVA with a Tukey's HSD
correction for all pairwise comparisons was performed to
determine if viral loads were significantly different across
time points.

Gene clustering and functional annotation
We identified 263 probe sets with statistically significant
differences in mRNA abundances between Day 0 and any
other subsequent time point (Tables 1, 2). We assume that
statistically significant probe sets correspond to genes that
were differentially regulated after ATV infection. Cluster
analysis of the statistically significant genes identified two
groups that exhibited similar changes in mRNA abundance. After ATV infection at Day 0, 158 putative genes
showed a significant increase in mRNA abundance at subsequent time points (Figure 2), while 105 transcripts
showed a significant decrease (Figure 3). Thus, more
genes were up-regulated than down-regulated in response
to ATV infection. Overall, DAVID categorized statistically
significant genes among 44 different groups that correspond to different biological processes. Eight of these
groups contained more genes than would be expected by
chance sampling of genes from the microarray (geometric
mean p-value < 0.05); these groups were considered significantly enriched with candidate genes relative to other
groups (Table 3). Four of these significant groups contain
gene ontologies related to immune response and pathogen response, including innate immunity, complement
activation, lysosome function, and antigen processing and
presentation. The most enriched functional group contains genes primarily related to immune function and
defense responses. The remaining four functional groups
contain gene ontologies related to ion binding, ion transport, vitamin metabolism, and response to an unfolded
protein. Many genes that were classified in broader biological process categories that are not directly immunityrelated are nonetheless associated with immunity in vertebrates [e.g. [46-48]].

Results
Viral load and disease pathogenesis
Viral load for each animal was estimated using qPCR and
then averaged for each time point (Fig 1). The significant
increase in viral load across time points indicates that animals were infected and that viral replication was occurring. ANOVA with a Tukey's correction for multiple
comparisons confirmed that viral load increased linearly

Genes Up-regulated in Response to ATV
Across all time points, the majority of up-regulated genes
were related to immune response or other related functions, such as inflammation and apoptosis. Other up-regulated genes pertained to gene functions such as ion
binding and transport, membrane related functions, and
protein binding and modification. Twenty-three genes

(represented by 26 probe sets) demonstrated 2-fold or
greater changes at 24 hours post-infection, all of which
were up-regulated. Ten of these 23 have functions pertaining to immune response. Of the remaining highly
expressed genes, one was associated with inflammation,
two to regulation of apoptosis, three to ion binding, three
to protein binding and modification, one to transport,
one to the extracellular constituent, and one to membrane
and glycolipids. Many of these genes showed increasing
transcript abundances over time. At 72 hours post infection, 43 genes had a greater than 5-fold change, and 40
genes had a greater than 5-fold change at 144 hours. The
highest expression level, 91-fold increase at 144 hours,
was observed for interferon-induced protein with tetracopeptide repeats 5 (IFIT5).
Genes Down-regulated in Response to ATV
In contrast to the very high fold changes observed among
up-regulated genes, the largest fold change observed
among down-regulated genes was approximately 4.9-fold,
in chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (NCAN). Five down-regulated genes each code for regulation of transcription and
translation. An additional 15 down-regulated genes correspond to 20 probe sets that have functions associated with

cell division and mitosis, which was not observed in the
up-regulated genes. Other notable down-regulated gene
ontologies include one gene corresponding to pinocytosis
and endocytosis, and one gene related to natural killer cell
mediated cytotoxicity.
Validation of Microarray Results Using Quantitative Realtime PCR
We used qPCR to estimate fold changes for nine genes to
verify our microarray data (Table 4). For five of the nine
genes investigated (56%; Myxovirus resistance 1, Macrophage receptor with collagenous structure, Complement component 3, Cyclin dependant kinase inhibitor 1B, Vaccinia related
kinase 1) there is good agreement between the microarray
and qPCR data. In genes where the microarray estimates
of fold change were modest (Serine dehydratase like, Hemoglobin gamma alpha, Glycogen synthase kinase, Programmed
cell death 8) there is poorer agreement between fold
change estimates from these two technologies. However,
for this latter group of genes with modest fold change values, the microarray and qPCR data were always within
four fold of each other. These results demonstrate that we
were able to verify robust differences that were suggested
by the microarray data.

regeneration were identified in this study. Thus, there was
no evidence of cell proliferation by spleen cells after ATV
infection.

Discussion and conclusion
Emerging infectious diseases are implicated in the global
decline of amphibians and other animals [3,49-51]. There
is urgent need to develop understanding of amphibian
immunological responses to pathogens and to identify
host genes that may be important in disease resistance.
Our study shows that functional genomics provides a
means to rapidly meet these needs. We infected Mexican
axolotls from the Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center with a
viral pathogen that is clearly affecting tiger salamander
populations in nature [10,13-15,19]. Our results show
that ATV infection induces transcriptional changes of
genes that are known to function in vertebrate immunity.
Below we discuss the transcriptional response in more
detail and suggest hypotheses to explain why ATV is often
lethal to axolotls and other tiger salamanders.
We detected significant gene expression changes 24 hours
post infection. Many of these gene expression changes
likely reflect transcription within lymphocytes, as they are
the predominant cell type in the spleen of juvenile and
adult axolotls [52]. Indeed, the functions of many of these
genes are associated with neutrophil, dendritic, and macrophage cell functions, including cytokine signaling
(chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4), phagocytosis and
destruction of phagocytised particles (disabled homolog 2,
mitogen-responsive phosphoprotein, neutrophil cytosolic factor
2, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1, RAS homolog
gene family, member B), complement (complement factor B,
complement component 3), and inflammation (pentraxin
related gene, rapidly induced by IL-1 beta, cytochrome B-245
beta polypeptide, n-myc and STAT interactor). Up-regulation
of complement components that are known to function
in the removal of viral particles, and up-regulation of the
stress-associated transcription factor jun-b, clearly shows
that ATV induced a humoral gene expression response in
the axolotl. Further support for this idea was obtained by
comparing ATV-induced gene expression changes to
changes identified from a previous microarray experiment
using A. mexicanum and the same microarray platform.
Twenty-five genes that were up-regulated in response to
ATV infection were also identified as significantly up-regulated during regeneration [31]. In both microarray studies, blood was not perfused from tissues prior to tissue
collection and it is known that leukocyctes express genes
during the early wound-healing phase of spinal cord and
limb regeneration. Thus, it seems likely that many of the
early gene expression changes that we observed in
response to ATV-infection reflect a general, humoral transcriptional response to stress.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/493

In addition to this general humoral response, the gene
expression patterns that we observed suggest that the Mexican axolotl manifests an antiviral transcriptional
response that is not unlike that observed in other vertebrates. For example, ATV infection clearly induces an
interferon-mediated, antiviral response. Although probe
sets for interferon genes are not represented on the GeneChip, we estimate based upon literature surveys that at
least 20% of the significant genes that we identified are
known in other systems (in vitro and in vivo) to be
involved in interferon-mediated transcription [53-55].
These genes exhibited some of the largest fold-changes
and include two primary transcription factors that compete to activate (interferon regulatory factor 1, up-regulated)
and repress (interferon regulatory factor 2, down-regulated)
transcription of interferon-alpha and beta (Type 1 interferon), and inferon-inducible genes that recognize and
degrade intra-cellular viral nucleic acid (interferon induced
with helicase C domain 1). Considering further that four of
the most highly enriched functional groups also contained genes relating to the immune response and pathogen response, the results show that axolotls mount a
robust anti-viral response from 24–144 hours post-infection.
Given the robust immunological transcription response
that we observed, it is curious why ATV is so virulent to
tiger salamanders. In the closely related Ranavirus frog
virus 3 (FV3), larval Xenopus laevis succomb to FV3 but
adults effectively clear virons and develop lasting resistance to future infection [56]. Adult resistance in X. laevis is
correlated with a significant proliferation of cytotoxic
CD8+ T cells in the spleen upon infection (within 6 days),
as well as increased mortality upon CD8+ T cell depletion
[30,57]. Mortality events due to ATV are more significant
among larvae in natural tiger salamander populations,
however metamorphosed adult tiger salamanders are
more susceptible than larvae to ATV infection in the lab
[18]. It is well established that Mexican axolotls have a less
complicated immune system and never develop the type
of mature immune response typical of amniote vertebrates [21-29,52]. We did not observe any gene expression
changes that would indicate proliferative leukocyte
responses in axolotl spleen. Perhaps this is because we
used juvenile axolotls that are incapable of such a
response. However, it is also possible that ATV maybe
more resistant to the immune response mounted by A.
mexicanum than FV3 is to the Xenopus immune response.
Phylogenetic analyses indicate ATV is more closely related
to iridoviruses found in fish than to FV3, which suggests a
relatively recent host switch occurring with the introduction of sportfish to areas of the southwestern United
States [15]. Iridoviruses found in sportfish have a larger
genome and contain more ORFs related to immune evasion than FV3, which could also be related to improved

performance of this virus on the salamander host [15].
Further studies are needed to better understand the ontogeny of immunological responses in axolotls, the virulence
of different ranaviruses, and the role of innate versus
adaptive immunity in ATV infection.
Our study has identified hundreds of new candidate genes
for laboratory and field studies of stress and disease in
tiger salamanders. Significantly more gene candidates will
undoubtedly be discovered using a higher content, 2nd
generation microarray that is currently under development. Genomic and bioinformatics tools make
Ambystoma a powerful system for wildlife disease research.
In particular, molecular information can be quickly crossreferenced from a genetically homogeneous strain that is
available for laboratory studies (Mexican axolotl), to
other closely related tiger salamander species in North
America [20]. Such power is needed to quickly understand
how ATV and other pathogens are overwhelming amphibian immune responses and causing population declines in
nature.
