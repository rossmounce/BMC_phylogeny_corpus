Multilocus sequence typing of a global collection
of Pasteurella multocida isolates from cattle and
other host species demonstrates niche
association

Abstract
Background: Pasteurella multocida causes disease in many host species throughout the world. In bovids, it
contributes to bovine respiratory disease (BRD) and causes haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS). Previous studies have
suggested that BRD-associated P. multocida isolates are of limited diversity. A multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
scheme for P. multocida was used to determine whether the low levels of diversity reported are due to the limited
discriminatory power of the typing method used, restricted sample selection or true niche association. Bovine
respiratory isolates of P. multocida (n = 133) from the UK, the USA and France, collected between 1984 and 2008
from both healthy and clinically affected animals, were typed using MLST. Isolates of P. multocida from cases of HS,
isolates from other host species and data from the MLST database were used as comparison.
Results: Bovine respiratory isolates were found to be clonal (ISA 0.45) with 105/128 belonging to clonal complex 13
(CC13). HS isolates were not related to bovine respiratory isolates. Of the host species studied, the majority had
their own unique sequence types (STs), with few STs being shared across host species, although there was some
cross over between porcine and bovine respiratory isolates. Avian, ovine and porcine isolates showed greater levels
of diversity compared to cattle respiratory isolates, despite more limited geographic origins.
Conclusions: The homogeneity of STs of bovine respiratory P. multocida observed, and the differences between
these and P. multocida subpopulations from bovine non-respiratory isolates and non-bovine hosts may indicate
niche association.

Background
Pasteurella multocida is a Gram-negative bacterium that
causes a wide range of clinical presentations in a wide
range of host species [1]. It has been shown to cause
respiratory disease in many animals, including cattle [2],
sheep [3] and pigs [4,5] although it is also found in the
respiratory tract of apparently healthy animals [6]. The
organism also causes haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) in
bovids, mainly in South and Southeast Asia and subSaharan Africa [7]. In pigs P. multocida contributes to
atrophic rhinitis [4] and in rabbits the organism is associated with a syndrome called “snuffles” [8]. Fowl cholera in avian species is a source of great economic losses

in commercial poultry flocks and also affects wild birds
[9]. In humans, P. multocida infections are mainly associated with animal bites [10,11].
Historically, phenotypic methods have been used to
differentiate strains and it has been shown that different
serotypes are associated with different hosts and clinical
presentations [12]. However the usefulness of phenotypic methods is limited due to the lack of discriminatory
power and the fact that they do not reflect population
structure [13]. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) provides a standardised system of typing by sequence analysis of several housekeeping genes, allowing strains to be
compared worldwide and the relationship between isolates to be explored [14]. MLST can be used to explore
the global epidemiology of an organism, for example
identifying niche-associated strains (strains that are

predominantly associated with a particular host or organ
system) [15-17]. This information can be used to
develop disease control measures, targeted towards
these niche-associated strains.
An MLST scheme has recently been established for P.
multocida, the Pasteurella multocida Rural Industries
Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC)
scheme [18,19]. This scheme was originally designed to
type avian isolates and these comprise the bulk of submitted data; it has since been used by the international
research community to submit data relating to several
other host species. An alternative scheme, the Pasteurella multocida Multi-host MLST scheme [20] (hereafter
referred to as “the alternative MLST scheme”) is also
available but at the time of data analysis it was not possible to submit isolates into this database.
Pasteurella isolates from avian species have high levels
of diversity; there were 26 sequence types (STs) in 63
Australian avian P. multocida isolates and most STs (16/
26) consisted of a single isolate [18]. This concurs with
previous findings using non-MLST methods [13,21]. In
cattle, diversity has been shown to be limited, but results
were based on limited geographic regions [22,23].
We wanted to establish whether the limited diversity
observed in bovine respiratory isolates is indicative of
niche association, rather than a reflection of a limited
sample population or the method’s discriminatory
power. Therefore we used the published (RIRDC) MLST
scheme to type a global collection of isolates and to
compare results across host species, clinical manifestations and geographic origins.

Results
Complete results are available for 195 P. multocida isolates, as one avian and five cattle respiratory isolates
failed to amplify at 1 of 7 loci after repeated attempts.
Primer set ZWF-F1/ZWF-R1 failed to amplify 3 isolates;
these were successfully amplified and sequenced using
ZWF-F2/ZWF-R2 (all three isolates were allele zwf-1).
Each locus had between 16 and 26 alleles and the proportion of polymorphic sites varied from 4.6% (mdh) to
13.1% (est) (mean of 7.2%) (Table 1). The dN/dS ratios
at all loci were less than 1, indicating that genes used
were not under selective pressure.
A total of 62 STs were assigned to the 195 P. multocida isolates analysed. Where members of a group were
defined as sharing 6 of 7 alleles, eBURST divided the
isolates into 22 singletons and 12 groups (either pairs of
single locus variants or larger groupings of related STs)
(Figure 1). Data were also explored using less stringent
criteria for eBURST group definition (5 of 7 alleles
shared alleles), allowing for inclusion of dual locus variants (DLVs) in groups, in the absence of single locus
variants (SLVs) connecting them to the remainder of

the group. In this case, the isolates divided into 11
groups and 17 singletons; there were no major changes
to population structure (Figure 1).
Within cattle respiratory isolates, 105/128 belonged to
clonal complex (CC) 13 (sharing 6 of 7 alleles) (Figure
1). The isolates in CC13 originated from UK, USA and
France from different time periods (1984-2008) from
both apparently healthy and diseased individuals. Over
two thirds of bovine respiratory isolates (91 of 128)
belong to just three STs (ST13, ST79 and ST80). All
three of these STs included UK isolates, ST13 and ST80
included French isolates and 7 of 8 US cattle isolates
were ST79 (the remaining US isolate was ST135, an
SLV of ST79).
Seven isolates from calves sampled as part of a crosssectional study in Scotland in 2008, from 7 different
farms, grouped into ST123, which was unrelated to any
other ST found (using the criterion of sharing 5 of 7
alleles). At the est locus, these isolates had a unique
allele (allele est-50) which has a single nucleotide insertion, resulting in a frame shift mutation. The functional
significance of this is unknown.
The majority of HS isolates (9 of 12; 7 cattle, 2 buffalo) belonged to a unique sequence type (ST122),
which also included 2 elephant and one bison isolate of
unspecified clinical status. The 28 ovine isolates grouped
into 19 STs; no ST was found in both Spanish and New
Zealand sheep, although multiple closely related STs
(SLVs and DLVs) were identified across both groups
(Figure 1). Seven porcine isolates were typed as ST13
and an additional 6 isolates belonged to 5 STs, with one
ST (ST9) also found in cattle, two STs that were DLVs
of cattle-associated STs and 2 STs found in pigs only
(Figure 1). Eight novel STs were detected in the eight
avian isolates typed in the current study.
Most STs were specific to host of origin (Figure 1),
the exceptions being ST13 (40 bovine respiratory and 7
porcine isolates), ST122 (10 bovine HS and 2 elephant
isolates), ST 132 (3 ovine and 1 bovine isolates) and
ST9 (1 porcine, 1 bovine and 1 human isolate).

locus variants.

A highly significant Standardised Index of Association
(ISA) (0.45, P = 0.000) in cattle respiratory isolates indicated the presence of linkage disequilibrium within this
population of P. multocida isolates and the results of
SplitsTree analysis corroborated this, showing a treelike, rather than a network, structure (Additional file 1,
Figure S1). Significant linkage disequilibrium was also
detected when all 195 isolates were analysed (ISA = 0.33,
P = 0.000) and a tree-like structure was again observed
on split decomposition analysis (Additional file 2, Figure
S2). In the absence of strong evidence for recombination, a Neighbour-Joining tree was constructed from
concatenated sequences (Figure 2). The population
structure as demonstrated by eBURST analysis was generally maintained, with some substructuring within
populations associated with specific niches, for example

within ovine and bovine respiratory isolates. Bovine
respiratory isolates identified as CC13 formed a discrete
cluster with the inclusion of ST88, which is a DLV of
STs 79 and 80; no bovine non-respiratory associated ST
was related to this cluster (Figure 2). The tree divided
the isolates into clusters which corresponded with the
groups identified when eBURST classified a group as
sharing 5 of 7 alleles.
Comparison with isolates already submitted to the MLST
database

At the time of submission, the P. multocida (RIRDC)
database was comprised mainly of avian isolates (135 of
185) as well as 24 porcine and 5 bovine isolates. Fowl
cholera was the main recorded disease (81 isolates);
respiratory disease or pneumonia was recorded in 18

the database (ST8, ST9, ST13, ST50, ST51, ST58 and
ST74).
The database included 11 isolates in CC13, including
isolates belonging to ST13 (6 pig, 2 turkey and 1 cattle
isolate), ST70 (1 pig isolate) and ST44 (1 turkey isolate).
These findings, coupled with results from the current
study, indicate that CC13 is associated strongly, but not
exclusively, with bovine respiratory isolates with porcine
isolates commonly included in this clonal complex.
Results of the current study are consistent with data
already submitted to the database in many instances.
For example, ST122, identified in the current study as
being associated with isolates from cases of HS, is an
SLV of ST63 from the database, which represents a buffalo isolate (albeit of unknown geographic and clinical
origin). Two of the STs identified in avian species in the
current study (ST-109 and ST-110) are SLVs of ST40
from the database, which also represents avian isolates
(chicken and herring gull).
Combined analysis of isolates from the current study
and those already in the database at the time of manuscript preparation showed that of 137 STs, 95 were
comprised of just one isolate. Of the remaining 42 STs,
3 were lacking sufficient data to determine host association. Nine STs were found in more than one host
although the majority of these showed evidence of a
predominant association with one host type (Table 2).
For example ST13 appears to be bovine associated but
not bovine specific, and the same is true for STs 5, 8
and 37 in avian species and ST50 in pigs. STs 9 and 58
are notable exceptions - to date ST9 has been detected
in isolates of avian, bovine, porcine and human origin.
Thirty STs are represented by multiple isolates and have
so far only been identified in one host type, although in
some cases this may be explained by collection of epidemiologically related isolates.

The isolates in the database represented 78 STs.
The current study produced 47 new alleles and 55
new allelic profiles (STs). Only 7 STs were already in

Discussion
The focus of the current study was cattle respiratory
isolates, which we have found to be predominantly clonal, belonging mainly to CC13. The isolates in CC13
include cattle isolates from a range of countries, years
and presentations. Preliminary studies had suggested
clonality among bovine respiratory P. multocida isolates [22,23] but clonality of cattle isolates cannot be
confirmed in isolation; if a typing mechanism indicates
clonality but no other host species are examined, it is
not clear whether the isolates are truly clonal or if the
typing scheme is not appropriate for the organism. In
this case, the fact that the scheme clearly differentiates
P. multocida isolates within and between host species,
and differentiates bovine respiratory and non-respiratory isolates, suggests that the findings in cattle are
robust.

Included are isolates typed in the current study and isolates deposited in the P. multocida RIRDC MLST database, where relevant data were available.

MLST (often in conjunction with other typing methods) has been used to determine host or niche association in many pathogens, for example to explore
zoonotic potential of animal pathogens, to support
source attribution for human infections and to identify
host or niche specific clones that can be investigated in
depth to understand host adaptation and host-pathogen
interactions. MLST of Campylobacter jejuni has identified poultry-associated strains as the major cause of

foodborne infection [24,25]. In contrast, other strains of
C. jejuni, for example from the environment and wild
birds, are not associated with disease in humans [25].
For C. jejuni, as for P. multocida, host-association transcends geographic boundaries [17]. Similar phenomena
are observed in Gram-positive species, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, which is a common cause of disease in
humans and ruminants. MLST has identified clonal
complexes of S. aureus that are associated with humans,

Hotchkiss et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:115
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/115

cattle and small ruminants, respectively, and these clonal
complexes are found across multiple continents [26,27].
Further study of host-associated strains has led to identification of molecular correlates of host specialisation in
Campylobacter [28] and S. aureus [29] and our findings
could form the basis for similar work in P. multocida.
Within many bacterial species, generalist strains also
exist. Examples would include C. jejuni ST45 [25], S.
aureus ST398 [30] and P. multocida ST9 from the current study.
Whilst the majority of bovine respiratory isolates did
group into CC13, there were a number that did not.
The epidemiological significance of these outliers is
unknown; isolates were from clinically and non-clinically
affected animals in the UK and France and were collected over a number of years. Strains of other pathogens that appear unrelated by MLST and other
molecular analyses (but may share other common characteristics) have been shown to cause the same clinical
picture in the same host species, for example S. aureus
in bovine mastitis [15].
Isolates from both clinically affected and apparently
healthy animals grouped together in CC13. As housekeeping genes were used, this is perhaps not surprising as virulence is likely to be driven by other genetic markers, for
example those encoding outer membrane proteins
(OMPs), iron acquisition factors and colonisation factors
[31,32]. In addition, there may be other non-pathogen
related drivers of disease, such as host immunity. For
example, the ovine isolates identified here as NZ originated from sheep being exported by sea when an outbreak
of pneumonia caused a number of fatalities [33]. Multiple
serotypes of P. multocida were identified as the primary
pathogen in necropsied sheep, suggesting that diverse
commensal flora in the respiratory tract of the sheep
behaved as opportunistic pathogens when the sheep
encountered stress and adverse environmental conditions.
In the current study, multiple STs were also detected in
this outbreak but MLST has been shown to lack sufficient
discriminatory power when used at farm level in cattle
[23]. In cattle, more discriminatory typing methods should
be employed where local epidemiology is being studied
(for example outbreak investigations). In these cases,
methods such as RAPD and PFGE may be appropriate
tools [23]. OMP profiling has also been shown to be more
discriminatory than MLST in P. multocida isolates [22].
HS isolates were distinct from bovine respiratory isolates, suggesting that isolates in CC13 are not just cattle
associated, but more specifically associated with the
bovine respiratory tract niche. However it is also possible that there has been geographical substructuring or
ecological isolation of populations - we do not have
access to bovine respiratory tract isolates from the Tropics or HS isolates from Europe/USA to test this theory.

Page 6 of 8

HS isolates have been shown to differ from respiratory
isolates at phenotypic markers, particularly capsular serotypes (HS isolates are usually capsular group B whereas
bovine respiratory isolates are usually capsular group A)
[2,7].
The alternative MLST scheme has also found cattle
samples to be clonal in nature [22], with 22 of 32 bovine
respiratory isolates grouping into one clonal complex
which also included 11 porcine isolates. In the alternative
scheme, HS isolates were not related to bovine respiratory
isolates, using the criterion of sharing 5 of 7 alleles and
data were consistent with the RIRDC scheme in that some
STs were non-host specific whereas others appeared to be
host associated. One of the major advantages of MLST is
the portability of methods and results, which is why we
chose to use the (RIRDC) scheme rather than the alternative scheme. Because results are portable and standardised,
they can be compared across database entries from multiple contributors. When attempts were made to use the
database to explore host association of STs, however, it
was not always easy to determine whether STs that
appeared host specific could reflect epidemiologically
linked isolates. For example, ST2 appears to be host specific, comprising 13 isolates, all of avian origin. Examination
of an associated reference reveals that 12 of these isolates
are epidemiologically related [18]. The epidemiological
value of data from MLST databases is limited by the isolates and data submitted by contributors. Where contributors only submit data for one representative isolate per ST,
epidemiological interpretations may be misleading [34].
With expansion of an MLST scheme, referring to all associated publications to determine, for example, frequency
of occurrence of STs or epidemiological relatedness of isolates becomes less feasible.

Conclusions
The analysis by MLST of this global collection of isolates from multiple host species and disease syndromes
has identified niche association in bovine respiratory P.
multocida isolates. Development of an efficacious vaccine against P. multocida would be a valuable tool in
reducing the significant economic losses, and welfare
concerns, associated with BRD. Future work in this area
should target the dominant, niche-associated strains
such as those included in CC13.
Methods
The aim of sample selection was to include as diverse a
range of isolates as possible, from different host species,
clinical presentations, geographical locations and years
of collection. As they were of particular interest, the
majority of isolates were obtained from cattle (Table 3).
These isolates were drawn from 6 collections, 3 continents and from healthy as well as diseased animals

(bovine respiratory disease and HS). Isolates from other
host species (Table 3) and data from the MLST database
were used for comparison.
Stocks of 201 P. multocida isolates stored previously at
-70°C in glycerol were cultured overnight on sheep blood
agar (5% citrated sheep blood in agar No.2 base; E&O
Laboratories Ltd), at 37°C. Colonies were suspended in
500 ul sterile water, vortexed and heated at 95°C for 10
minutes. These lysates were used as template in a PCR to
confirm species, based on the kmt gene [35].
The DNA was used to amplify loci from 7 housekeeping
genes. The primers and conditions were as per the MLST
(RIRDC) scheme [18,19] As specified, 7 loci (adk, est, pmi,
pgi, zwf, gdh, mdh) were used and gene fragments of
lengths 570-808 bp were amplified. For the zwf locus, both
sets of primers were used on all samples (ZWF-F1/ZWFR1 and ZWF-F2/ZWF-R2). After confirmation of amplification by gel electrophoresis, PCR product was purified
and sequenced in both directions by a commercial company (GATC Biotech). Forward and reverse sequences
were aligned and manually inspected using SeqMan
(DNASTAR Lasergene 8). Consensus sequences were
stored in FASTA format. High quality double stranded
DNA was used to assign alleles, with lengths ranging from
466 to 602 bp (Table 1). At each locus sequences were
checked for existing alleles using the MLST database. New
alleles and STs were assigned by the MLST database curator, after verification of trace files.
STs were analysed using eBURST v3 [36,37]. Groups
were defined where STs shared 6 of 7, and also 5 of 7,
alleles. Split decomposition analysis was performed on
allelic profile data using SplitsTree v4 [38,39] and the
standardized index of association (I SA) was calculated,

both for cattle respiratory isolates alone and for all isolates using LIAN v3.5 [38,40]; the Monte-Carlo method
with 1000 samplings was used to determine significance.
Only one representative of each allelic profile was
included. A Neighbour Joining tree was constructed
from the concatenated sequences (3715 bp) using the
Jukes Cantor algorithm with 1500 bootstrap replicates
(MEGA v.5.03) [41]. The number of polymorphic sites,
allelic frequencies and ratio of nonsynonymous to
synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) was calculated for all
loci using START v2 [42].
