Abstract
Background: The cellulose synthase superfamily has been classified into nine cellulose synthaselike (Csl) families and one cellulose synthase (CesA) family. The Csl families have been proposed
to be involved in the synthesis of the backbones of hemicelluloses of plant cell walls. With 17 plant
and algal genomes fully sequenced, we sought to conduct a genome-wide and systematic
investigation of this superfamily through in-depth phylogenetic analyses.
Results: A single-copy gene is found in the six chlorophyte green algae, which is most closely
related to the CslA and CslC families that are present in the seven land plants investigated in our
analyses. Six proteins from poplar, grape and sorghum form a distinct family (CslJ), providing
further support for the conclusions from two recent studies. CslB/E/G/H/J families have evolved
significantly more rapidly than their widely distributed relatives, and tend to have intragenomic
duplications, in particular in the grape genome.
Conclusion: Our data suggest that the CslA and CslC families originated through an ancient gene
duplication event in land plants. We speculate that the single-copy Csl gene in green algae may
encode a mannan synthase. We confirm that the rest of the Csl families have a different
evolutionary origin than CslA and CslC, and have proposed a model for the divergence order
among them. Our study provides new insights about the evolution of this important gene family in
plants.

Background
The first plant gene encoding a cellulose synthase catalytic
subunit (CesA) was identified in 1996 in cotton based on
its sequence similarity to a bacterial CesA [1]. In 2000,
Richmond and Somerville identified 10 CesA genes and
31 cellulose synthases-like (Csl) genes in Arabidopsis,
which were further classified into one CesA family and six
Csl families (CslA/B/C/D/E/G) based on phylogenetic
analyses [2]. Since then, the whole CesA and Csl gene rep-

ertoire has been cataloged in fully sequenced plants,
including rice [3], poplar [4,5] and the moss Physcomitrella
patens [6]. Additional CesA and Csl genes have also been
found in diverse and not fully sequenced land plants such
as maize [7], barley [8] and pine [9]; CesAs have been
identified in streptophyte green algae such as Mesotaenium
caldariorum [10,11] and in red alga Porphyra yezoensis
[12,13] as well. Two additional Csl families (CslF and
CslH) were found in these studies; together with the other

six Csl families and one CesA family, they comprise the
CesA superfamily.
The CesA superfamily genes are among the most important players involved in the biosynthesis of plant cell
walls, which are mainly composed of biopolymers such as
celluloses, hemicelluloses, pectins and lignins. Because
the Csl genes share sequence similarities with the CesA
genes, they are hypothesized to be involved in the biosynthesis of the backbone of various polysaccharide polymers
[2], in particular hemicelluloses [14]. This so-called "CSL
hypothesis" has been supported by recent experimental
studies, which suggest that the CslA genes encode the
mannan synthases [15,16], the CslF and CslH genes
encode the mixed linkage glucan synthases [17,18], and
the CslC genes are probably involved in the xyloglucan
biosynthesis [19]. Therefore the backbone synthases of all
major hemicellulose classes except for xylans are known.
However, the functional roles of the other Csl families
(CslB/D/E/G) remain unclear.
The phylogenetic classification and the function of the
CesA superfamily were reviewed by Lerouxel et al. in 2006
[14], and since then there have been a few updates in
terms of the phylogenetic analyses of these important
genes. Fincher et al. have found a new Csl family (CslJ) in
cereals [20,21]. Roberts and Bushoven have mined the P.
pattens genomic and EST data and found CesA, CslA, CslC
and CslD genes in this lower plant [6]; their phylogenetic
analyses revealed that seven P. patens CesA genes form a
monophyletic clade by themselves and there are no oneto-one orthologs in the moss corresponding to the Arabidopsis CesA triplet subunits (CesA1/3/6 for the primary
cell wall and CesA4/7/8 for the secondary cell wall). Furthermore, comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of the

plant CesA superfamily by including CesAs from other
organismal groups (e.g., bacteria, fungi and animals) indicated that plant CslA and CslC genes have a different origin than the remaining plant genes [22]. Evidences have
been reported that these remaining genes of the CesA
superfamily were anciently acquired from cyanobacteria
[23]. It was proposed [22] that the plant CslG genes
evolved first, followed by the CslE, CslB, CesA and CslD/
F genes. However, a more recent study could not find
homologs of the CslG/E/B/H/F genes in P. patens [6], suggesting that these Csl families are narrowly distributed
and unlikely to be the earliest evolved.
To date 17 plant and algal genomes have been fully or
nearly fully sequenced, and their gene prediction and
annotation are publicly available (Table 1). The availability of these genomes and their annotated genes facilitates
comparative genomic studies of plants, making it possible
to address major plant biology questions in silico [24]. We
have performed comparative analyses of the CesA superfamily genes in the 17 sequenced plant and algal
genomes. Our goals are to define CesA and Csl gene
homologs across these genomes and to investigate the
evolution of different Csl gene families. We have built a
catalog of all the Csl genes and classified them phylogenetically. The gene structure, the evolutionary rate, and
the distribution of the Csl families across different
genomes are also studied. Throughout this paper, we use
Csl genes to denote all cellulose synthases-like genes
including CesAs.

details). We found that all predicted Csl proteins contain
either the Pfam Cellulose_synt domain (PF03552, 898 aa
long) or the glycosyltransferase family 2 (GT2) domain
(PF00535, 149 aa long) but not both. For example, all
CslA and CslC proteins in Arabidopsis have the GT2
domain but not the Cellulose_synt domain, while all
other Arabidopsis Csl proteins contain only the
Cellulose_synt domain, which is consistent with a previous finding that CslA and CslC have a different origin
than the other Csl families [22]. We then grouped all proteins with the GT2 domain into a set denoted as the GT2
dataset, and those with the Cellulose_synt domain into
the Cellulose_synt dataset. These two datasets do not
share any common proteins.

bacterial genomes. These two proteins were originally
identified by Nobles et al. in 2001 [23], and here are used
to root the eukaryotic Cellulose_synt phylogeny.
Phylogenetic classification of Csl families
To characterize the identified Csl genes from the 17
genomes, we built phylogenetic trees for each of the two
aforementioned datasets, based on the multiple sequence
alignments of both the full length proteins and the conserved Pfam domains (see Methods for details). Figures
1A and 1B show the un-rooted maximum likelihood (ML)
trees for the Cellulose_synt dataset and the GT2 dataset,
respectively. The number and the species information of
the genes included in the phylogeny are given in Table 2.
Neighbor joining (NJ) trees for the two datasets were also
constructed and given in the Additional file 1 [see Additional file 1].

By querying the Pfam Cellulose_synt domain, we identified two cyanobacterial proteins from the fully sequenced

c) AtCslA1 was not identified in our hmmsearch (see Methods for details), and thus the number of Csl genes in Arabidopsis is shown to be 39
instead of 40.
b) Genome

The number of proteins in each Csl family, calculated
based on their groupings as shown in Figure 1, is given in
Table 2. No Csl genes were detected in the three stramenopile algae (two diatoms: Thalassiosira pseudonana, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and one brown tide alga:
Aureococcus anophagefferens) and the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae. Only one single-copy gene, which is
most closely related to CslA/C, was identified in each of
the six green algae. Overall, 77 proteins from land plants
have the GT2 Pfam domain, which are assigned to either
the CslA or the CslC family (Figure 1b). Six additional
proteins from green algae also have the GT2 Pfam domain
and are the most homologous to both the land plant CslA
and CslC genes. The Cellulose_synt Pfam domain is
found in 211 proteins, which are assigned to the other Csl
families (Figure 1a). Based on their taxonomic distribution and the phylogenies shown in Figure 1, we have
divided the 294 identified Csl proteins into three categories. The first category consists of CslA and CslC, the most
conserved Csl families in our analyses. These families are
found in all seven land plants and all six green algae sampled in this study. The second category contains three phylogenetically related families, CesA, CslD and CslF (Figure
1a). Among these families, CslF is specific to grasses while
CesA and CslD are present across all the sampled land
plants, including the two lower plants (P. patens of bryophytes and S. moellendorffii of lycophytes in Table 1).

The last category includes the remaining Csl families,
which appear to be confined to the five sampled seed
plants (Table 2). Such a restricted distribution suggests a
likely late origin of these Csl families and possible functional roles specific to seed plants.
CslJ represents a new Csl family that is found in both
monocot and dicot plants
Figure 1 shows all the nine previously known Csl families
[14], namely CesA and CslA/B/C/D/E/F/G/H, each forming a well-supported group. A new Csl family was discovered very recently in cereals and named CslJ [20,21]. Here
we found this family not only in sorghum but also in poplar and grape, suggesting that it is another seed plant-specific Csl family in addition to the CslE family. The
sorghum sequence (Sb03g047220) was found in both
this study and previous papers [20,21]. According to the
phylogeny (Figure 1a; [see Additional file 1]), CslJ is
closely related to CslG. We have examined if the CslJ family contains functional genes, knowing that neither Arabidopsis nor rice contains this family (Table 2). The
following evidence suggests that genes of this family are
not likely to be pseudogenes. First, our Ka/Ks analysis (see
Methods for details) shows that members of this family
are under negative selection (median of Ka/Ks = 0.23, Figure 2). Second, all members of this family (Table 3) have
EST sequences in the NCBI EST database, indicating that

Estimation of evolutionary rates of different Csl families
Estimation of evolutionary rates of different Csl families. If the Ka/Ks ratio for a protein is less than one (less amino
acid replacements than silent base substitutions), it means the protein is under negative selection; otherwise if Ka/Ks>1, it
means the protein is under positive selection. We used the model = 1 implemented in codeml of PAML to compute Ka/Ks,
which allows each gene in the tree evolving at its own rate; therefore within each family (tree) a different Ka/Ks value for each
gene is obtained (see Methods for details). The distribution of the Ka/Ks values of genes of each Csl family is plotted side by
side, showing the minimum, the 25% percentile, the median, the 75% percentile and the maximum values of Ka/Ks. The boxes
are drawn with widths proportional to the square-roots of the number of genes in the groups. A notch is drawn on each side
of the box towards the median. For panel a) we used Csl genes from all the seven land plants; for b), c) and d) we extracted
and plotted genes from only subsets of the seven genomes, namely, the five seed plants, the three dicot plants and the two
monocot plants, respectively.
these genes are expressed. And third, members of this gene
family have also been found in unfinished genomes such
as barley, wheat and maize [20,21].

(Figure 1b). Inasmuch this green algal Csl group possibly
represents the most homologous genes of the common
ancestor of CslA and CslC in all the land plants.

Protein sequences of the CslJ members (first column) were queried to search against the NCBI EST database. With E-value cutoff <= 1e-2, EST
matches that are >98% identical to the query protein and are from the same species as the query were collected and listed in the second column.

cates a higher evolutionary rate. Using Ka, Ks and the Ka/
Ks ratio as proxies, people have found significant correlations between protein evolutionary rates and numerous
features derivable from genome sequences, such as the
number of protein-protein interaction partners, gene
expression levels, the essentiality of a gene and the
number of paralogs of a gene [42-44] (and papers cited
therein). In particular, genes that originated relatively
recently through gene duplications or by other mechanisms usually evolve more rapidly than the more ancient
genes [45]. In order to compare the relative evolutionary
rates among the Csl families that may have come into

being through duplications [46], we have calculated the
Ka/Ks ratios (see Methods for details) and conducted rigorous statistical analyses on the computational results.
The comparisons of the distribution of the Ka/Ks ratios
across different Csl families are shown in Figure 2aâd,
from which it is clear that the narrowly distributed Csl
families (CslB/H/E/G/J) tend to have higher Ka/Ks ratios
than those widely distributed Csl families (CslA/C/D and
CesA). This observation is statistically supported by pairwise Wilcoxon tests (Table 4aâd). Interestingly, this observation remains to be true when we compared the genes of

In a hypothesis testing, a P-value is usually calculated to indicate if the null hypothesis is statistically supported. In this case, genes of Csl families in
the column are tested against those in the row in terms of their Ka/Ks values. The null hypothesis is that the column is equal to the row, and the
alternative hypothesis is that the column is larger than the row. If the P-value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative
hypothesis is statistically significantly supported. This table shows that except for a very few cases (those with asterisks), the columns are always
significantly larger than the rows.

the Csl families across different groupings of the plant
genomes, namely across (a) all the seven land plants (Figure 2a), (b) the five seed plants (excluding moss and spike
moss from (a); Figure 2b), (c) the three dicot plants (Figure 2c), (d) the two monocot plants (Figure 2d), and (e)
each of the seven plants (data not shown). Specifically, we
found that the dicot-specific CslB and CslG families have
evolved the most rapidly, followed by the monocot-specific CslH, and then by the seed plant-specific CslE and
CslJ. In addition, the monocot-specific CslF has evolved
significantly more rapidly than CslC and CesA, but not
than CslA and CslD (Table 4d). Overall, we found that the
CslB/H/E/G/J families have evolved more rapidly than the
other Csl families, which lends further support for the
hypothesis that these families might have diversified relatively recently to acquire new functions specific to the seed
plants.

Csl families are given in the Additional file 2 [see Additional file 2].

Comparative study of individual Csl families
We have compared the Csl genes across different plant
genomes by inspecting the phylogeny of each family and
analyzing the gene structures. We present here a detailed
comparative analysis of the less studied and narrowly distributed CslB/H/E/G/J families. The analyses of the other

B) CslG and CslJ families
These two families are closely related to each other in the
phylogeny shown in Figure 1. Genes of the dicot-specific
CslG family [14] form mostly genome-specific monophyletic clusters (except for CslG-II that has a grape gene),
and have conserved gene structures. This suggests that the

A) CslE family
The phylogeny and the gene structure of the CslE family
are shown in Figure 3. While there is only one CslE gene
in Arabidopsis, nine copies of the gene are found in the
recently sequenced grape genome (Table 1). Six of these
grape genes form a monophyletic group, and are located
on the chromosome in tandem within a ~45 kb region,
which apparently resulted from a tandem duplication
event. All these grape genes have Ka/Ks ratios between
0.24~0.33 (under purifying selection) and have EST data
in GenBank, suggesting that they are functionally active.
The grass genes form a large group on the phylogeny, suggesting that CslE diverged separately after the split of
dicots and monocots.

CslG family diversified separately in each dicot plant via
intragenomic duplications. Similar to CslE, this family is
also substantially expanded in the grape genome possibly
as a result of tandem gene duplications (Table 2 and Figure 4). The 14 grape CslG genes have Ka/Ks ratios between
0.20~0.65; nine of them have ESTs in GenBank, and one
has more than ten identical ESTs (UniGene entry
Vvi.9751). The EST data indicate that this gene is
expressed mostly in grape leaves, although further experimental studies are clearly needed to determine if any of
these duplicated genes is actually functional.CslJ is possibly a new family according to recent studies [20,21] and
our current analyses. Although CslJ is closely related to
CslG, these two families have very different gene structures (Figure 4). In addition, unlike other families, the
CslJ genes appear to be less conserved in their gene structures.

terized [14]. This study focuses on the computational
identification and classification of the Csl families in fully
or nearly fully sequenced plant and algal genomes. Our
phylogenetic analyses have led to the identification of the
Csl orthologs across these genomes and the generation of
new insights about how they might have evolved in plants
and algae.
Limitation in identifying CesAs forming linear terminal
complexes (TCs)
Our analyses did not detect any CesA and Csl genes in the
three stramenopile algal genomes nor in the red algal
genome, but this does not necessarily mean that no stramenopiles or red algae contain these families. In fact, a
CesA gene has been identified very recently in an yet
sequenced red alga Porphyra yezoensis [13]. Actually, the
cellulose synthases, which assemble into the so-called terminal complex (TC), have been found across all classes of
organisms. TCs can be morphologically classified into
rosette TCs or linear TCs [47-49], for each of which the
component CesAs have rather different domain structures
[48]. While the rosette TCs have been extensively studied
and found in all seed plants, the linear TCs may be the
most ancient, given their wider distribution across bacteria, fungi, animals and many classes of algae including
stramenopiles [48,50].

C) CslB and CslH families
These two families are phylogenetically related as shown
in Figure 1. CslB is a dicot-specific family while CslH is
monocot-specific [14]. We have observed that the paralogous genes of these two families tend to form clusters and
have similar gene structures (except for Os04g35020.1)
(Figure 5), suggesting the possibility of independent
genome-specific duplications followed by subsequent
sequence divergence.

Since the focus of this study is on CesAs that form rosette
TCs, we have adopted a rather conservative filtration procedure (see Methods for details), which may have
excluded some GT2 proteins that are possibly forming linear TCs. For instance, one GT2 gene from P. patens and
seven GT2 genes from S. moellendorfii were removed by
our filtration procedure (data not shown) but have been

Discussion
The cellulose synthase-like gene families are among the
most important players involved in the formation of plant
cell walls. Some Csl families have been found to be
responsible for the synthesis of the backbone of hemicelluloses, while the others are yet to be functionally charac100

found to be similar to the CesA genes of cyanobacteria
and the red alga Porphyra yezoensis [32].
The green algal CslA/C-like genes and their possible
functions
Despite all the previous studies about the distribution of
CesAs, very little has been done to identify the other Csl
families across different organisms. So what is known
about these families is fragmented at the best. For example, a sequence fragment from Chlamydomonas was
reported to have diverged early from the CslA and CslC
families [22]. In our study, we found that all the six sampled chlorophyte green algae have a single-copy gene that
is the most homologous to the land plant CslA and CslC
families. Our phylogenetic analysis indicates that the CslA
and the CslC families might have evolved via a gene duplication event that occurred uniquely in land plants after
they split from green algae (Figure 1b).

CslAs and CslCs have been characterized to encode mannan synthases [15,16] and xyloglucan synthases [19],
respectively. It is tempting to speculate that the mannan
synthesis might represent the ancestral function for the
single-copy CslA/C-like genes in green algae, since mannan is present in both charophyte algae and chlorophyte
algae while xyloglucan is absent from these green algae
[51,52].
The divergence order of Csl families
Recent studies have shown that the plant CesA genes and
some other Csl families are likely of cyanobacterial origin
[22,23], possibly as a result of intracellular gene transfer
from plastids (or cyanobacterial endosymbionts). In a Csl
gene phylogeny built by Nobles and Brown, CslG was sug-

gested to be the first Csl family evolved in plants, followed
by CslE, CslB, CesA and CslD [22]. However, our search of
fully sequenced plant and algal genomes has shown that
CslG is among the most narrowly distributed Csl families,
and is absent from our sampled algae and lower plants
(Table 2). Intuitively, such a distribution pattern suggests
that CslG might not be the earliest plant Csl family.
When constructing the phylogeny of Csl families (Figure
6), we included two cyanobacterial CesA protein
sequences (YP_322086.1 from Anabaena variabilis ATCC
29413 and NP_487797.1 from Nostoc sp. PCC 7120) as the
out-group of the plant CesA and Csl genes. These
sequences are the only two hits (see the first section of
Results) in our hmmsearch with the Pfam Cellulose_synt
domain against all fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes
(with E-value cutoff < 1.0). These two cyanobacterial
sequences are phylogenetically more closely related to the
land plant rosette-TC-forming CesAs than to the other
bacterial linear-TC-forming CesAs [22], and thus have
been proposed as the progenitor of all the rosette-TCforming CesAs and Csl genes. The rooted Csl phylogeny
(Figure 6) suggests a major early split between CesA/CslD/
F and the other Csl families (at node I). Clearly neither
CslG nor any of the other Csl families could be considered
as the earliest in plants, because the cyanobacterial CesAs
are not placed closer to any particular plant Csl family
than to the others. Instead, the Csl phylogeny suggests
that, after the establishment of plastids (or cyanobacterial
endosymbionts) in the ancestral plant, the cyanobacterial
derived CesA gene might have undergone several rounds
of sequence and function divergence (see nodes I to IV in
Figure 6). The evolutionary relationship of CslB/H to the
other families is less clear from our phylogeny since the

A phylogeny of the Csl families based on the multiple

sequences. 217 proteins were used in Figure 1a. Two
cyanobacterial sequences (YP_322086.1 from Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 and NP_487797.1 from Nostoc sp. PCC
7120) were used as the out-group to root the phylogeny.

The seed plant-specific CslB/H/E/G/J families
Although the common ancestor of the CslB/H/E/G/J families may have split from the other Csl families during the
early evolution of plants, their diversification might have
occurred recently. This is supported by the narrow distribution of CslB and CslG in dicots and CslH in monocots.
Additionally, we have shown that all these five families
have evolved rapidly (Figure 2). Paralogous genes of these
families typically form a monophyletic group in our phylogenies and have highly similar gene structures (Figure 3,
4, 5). These findings suggest that recent intragenomic
duplications have played a major role in the rapid
sequence and functional diversification of these families
[46]. A simple TBLASTN [39] search of the Csl proteins
against the masked plant genomic DNA sequences (with
all annotated gene models masked) found many homologous DNA fragments, indicating that they are likely pseudogenic relics after gene or genome duplications. A
detailed analysis of these DNA fragments could possibly
lead to a deeper understanding about the evolution of
these Csl families.

Conclusion
grouping of CslB/H with CslE/G/J has only a modest support (61% bootstrap value).
The finding that CslB/H/E/G/J split earlier than CslD/F (I
vs. III) is surprising, because CslD is found in lower plants
(moss and spike moss) whereas CslB/H/E/G/J are not.
One plausible explanation is that some ancestral genes of
the CslB/H/E/G/J families might have been present in the
most recent common ancestor of the land plants, but were
lost in moss and spike moss later. To test this hypothesis,
we performed a TFASTY [53] search of the Csl proteins
against the P. patens genomic sequences and the S. moellendorffii genomic sequences (Table 2), respectively, after
masking out all predicted genes. Interestingly we found
that some short sequence fragments are more similar to
CslB/E/G than to the other Csl families, suggesting the
possibility that they are the remnants of CslB/H/E/G/J.
For example, the P. patens scaffold_21 region from position 2584724 to position 2584398 (in base pair) is 28%
identical (51% similar) to the poplar CslB protein
eugene3.00141027 from position 7 to position 109 (in
amino acid), whose Cellulose_synt pfam domain is from
position 9 to position 747; and the S. moellendorffii
scaffold_577 region from position 192 to position 741 is
27% identical (52% similar) to the rice CslE protein
Os09g30120.1 from position 533 to position 708, whose
Cellulose_synt pfam domain is from position 15 to position 737. Similar searches against green algal genomic
DNAs also found some homologous regions to the land
plant CslB/H/E/G/J genes.

The cellulose synthase superfamily is identified and phylogenetically analyzed in fully sequenced plant and algal
genomes. We conclude that 1) a CslJ family is present in
both monocot and dicot plants, confirming two previous
reports that it is a new Csl family, and that 2) a green
algae-specific Csl family is most homologous to both land
plant CslA and CslC families and it is speculated to be a
mannan synthase, and that 3) CslG may not be the first
evolved Csl family and a new model is proposed in regard
to the evolution order of different Csl families.

Methods
Data sources
We downloaded the genome, proteome, and gene prediction and annotation data for the 17 genomes from various
sources (Table 1). Specifically, the Arabidopsis data were
from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR version 7.0) [54], rice data from The Institute for Genomic
Research (TIGR version 5.0) [55], grape data from [56],
red algae data from [57], and data for all the others are
from Joint Genome Institute (JGI) as of Dec. 2007. The
Arabidopsis and rice proteome data include alternatively
splicing variants, while all the other proteomes do not. We
included these splicing variants of the two organisms in
our analyses, but counted them as one gene in our statistics in Table 2. For instance, AtCslA3 has three known
splicing variants (AT1G23480.1, AT1G23480.2 and
AT1G23480.3); all these three proteins were included in
our phylogenetic analyses, although we count them as
one single gene in Table 2. We specified these variants in
our gene structure figures such as Figures 3, 4, 5. In addi-

tion, 597 fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes were
downloaded from [58] as of Dec. 2007.
BLAST search
We downloaded known Csl sequences from the Cell Wall
Navigator database [59,60], including all known Arabidopsis and rice Csl genes as well as sequences from other
species in UniProt [61]. We took this data set as the initial
query to search against the annotated protein sequences
of the 17 genomes.
HMMER search
There are two Pfam [40] domain models for the Csl proteins: PF03552 (Cellulose_synt) and PF00535
(Glycos_transf_2 or GT2), both of which were searched in
our analyses. In addition, we searched bacterial cellulose
catalytic domain model PF03170 (BcsB) but did not find
any significant hits (with E-value cutoff < 1.0) in plants
and algae. We ran hmmsearch against proteins of the 17
genomes by querying these HMM models in the ls mode
(global with respect to query domain and local with
respect to hit protein; see details in the manual of
HMMER package). We also performed hmmsearch
against the 597 prokaryotic genomes.
Selection of homologs
We have processed the search hits obtained from the
above BLAST and HMMER searches in order to build an
accurate Csl gene catalog for each genome:
a) Intersection of search results
We removed all the BLAST and hmmsearch hits with Evalue higher than 1.0, and kept only the hits returned by
both BLAST and hmmsearch; that is, the final hits should
be similar to the query Csl genes in the pair-wise sequence
comparison and contain either of the two conserved Pfam
domains. We used E-value cutoff < 1.0 for both BLAST and
hmmsearch because, under this condition, all known Arabidopsis Csl proteins except for AtCslA1/AT4G16590
(therefore in Table 2 the number of Arabidopsis Csl genes
is 39) were successfully retrieved and no false positives
were found. In addition, under this condition, the best
Arabidopsis homologs of all the identified Csl sequences
are known Csl genes.
b) Further filtration
We searched the candidate Csl proteins against the 17
genomes. For the true Csl genes, we expect to see their top
hits in the candidate Csl gene list. For each candidate, we
manually inspected its top 10 non-self hits: a candidate
was dropped if fewer than eight of the top 10 non-self hits
were in the candidate list. A few additional sequences
were found to be not Csl genes in the subsequent more
rigorous phylogenetic analyses and were removed. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/99

FASTA format sequences of all the finally identified CesA
and Csl genes are given in the Additional file 3 [see Additional file 3].
Phylogenetic analysis
Two datasets were prepared for our phylogenetic analysis:
protein sequences that contain the PF00535 (GT2)
domain and those that have the PF03552
(Cellulose_synt) domain. Multiple protein sequence
alignments (MSAs) were performed on both the full
length regions and the conserved Pfam domains for the
two datasets. MAFFT [62] was used in these alignments
using two highly accurate methods: L-INS-i and E-INS-i. LINS-i is considered to be the most accurate MSA method
[63,64], and E-INS-i performs well on sequences with
large unalignable regions (see manual of MAFFT). The
resulting MSAs were manually edited to remove gaps and
ambiguously aligned regions. We have also inspected the
MSAs for the presence of the DXD and D, D, D, QXXRW
motifs that are characteristic of possessive Î²-glycosyltransferases [65]. The original MSAs, the edited MSAs and the
resulting phylogenetic trees are all available in the Additional file 4 [see Additional file 4].

The ProtTest v1.4 package [66] was run on the computed
MSAs to select the best-fit models for phylogenetic analyses. We found the combination of JTT+I+G+F models to
be the best one for our phylogeny reconstruction. The
maximum likelihood (ML) trees were built using PhyML
[67], while neighbor-joining (NJ) trees were built using
MEGA4 [68] considering the above models. Specifically,
PhyML analyses were conducted using the JTT model, 100
replicates of bootstraps, an estimated proportion of the
invariable sites (I), four rate categories, an estimated
gamma distribution parameter (G), and optimized starting BIONJ tree. MEGA analyses were conducted using the
JTT substitution model, 500 replicates of bootstrap, pairwise detection of gaps or missing data, gamma distributed
rate among sites and the gamma parameter set at 1.0 (G).
Evolutionary rate computation
The evolutionary rate of proteins can be estimated by calculating the evolutionary distances that are often measured by calculating the ratio of the number of
nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site
(Ka) and the number of synonymous substitutions per
synonymous site (Ks) [43]. For each Csl family, in order
to obtain the longest possible alignment, we firstly built
an initial multiple sequence alignment on the full length
Csl protein sequences, and then manually examined the
alignment to remove fragmental sequences that introduced long gaps into the alignment (e.g. for those less
well annotated genomes, the predicted protein sequences
are often of low quality and fragmented). We then rebuilt

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:99

the multiple sequence alignment on the remaining
sequences and reconstructed an un-rooted ML tree.
We transformed the amino acid sequence alignment into
codon sequence alignment by using pal2nal [69]. The
coding sequences were obtained from the downloaded
genome data. The maximum likelihood estimation of Ks,
Ka and Ka/Ks values for each gene family was conducted
by running codeml in PAML [70], using the above tree
and the codon alignment as the input. The computation
of Ka/Ks ratios for a group of genes based on their phylogeny is conducted under the assumption that each gene
evolves at an independent rate. We used this model to
compute the Ka/Ks ratio for each gene of each Csl family.
Analyses were also performed using the conserved
domain regions; the result as shown in Figure 2 remains
unchanged (data not shown).
Gene structure analysis
The gene structure information was parsed from the GFF
file downloaded along with the genome data, and was
used as the input for the graphic display at the Gene Structure Display Server of Peking University [71].
