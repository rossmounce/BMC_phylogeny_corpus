Abstract
Portal hypertension is a clinical syndrome that is difficult to study in an isolated manner since it is
always associated with a greater or lesser degree of liver functional impairment. The aim of this
review is to integrate the complications related to chronic liver disease by using both, the array of
mast cell functions and mediators, since they possibly are involved in the pathophysiological
mechanisms of these complications. The portal vein ligated rat is the experimental model most
widely used to study this syndrome and it has been considered that a systemic inflammatory
response is produced. This response is mediated among other inflammatory cells by mast cells and
it evolves in three linked pathological functional systems. The nervous functional system presents
ischemia-reperfusion and edema (oxidative stress) and would be responsible for hyperdynamic
circulation; the immune functional system causes tissue infiltration by inflammatory cells,
particularly mast cells and bacteria (enzymatic stress) and the endocrine functional system presents
endothelial proliferation (antioxidative and antienzymatic stress) and angiogenesis. Mast cells could
develop a key role in the expression of these three phenotypes because their mediators have the
ability to produce all the aforementioned alterations, both at the splanchnic level (portal
hypertensive enteropathy, mesenteric adenitis, liver steatosis) and the systemic level (portal
hypertensive encephalopathy).
This hypothetical splanchnic and systemic inflammatory response would be aggravated during the
progression of the chronic liver disease, since the antioxidant ability of the body decreases. Thus,
a critical state is produced, in which the appearance of noxious factors would favor the
development of a dedifferentiation process protagonized by the nervous functional system. This
system rapidly induces an ischemia-reperfusion phenotype with hydration and salinization of the
body (hepatorenal syndrome, ascites) which, in turn would reduce the metabolic needs of the body
and facilitate its temporary survival.

Background
Portal hypertension is a clinical syndrome defined by a
pathological elevation in blood pressure in the portal system [1-3]. Ascites, portosystemic encephalopathy and

variceal hemorrhage are some of its most notable clinical
signs [4].

The increase in portal vein pressure is usually related to
the obstruction of portal flow [5,6]. Depending on the
level, the obstruction is classified as prehepatic, intrahepatic or posthepatic [7].
Prehepatic portal hypertension is most often caused by a
cavernoma of the portal vein. This cavernoma is related to
acute portal-vein thrombosis and develops concomitantly
with splenomegaly, portosystemic shunts and the reverse
flow in the unaffected intrahepatic portal veins [8]. It is
considered that these patients have no underlying liver
disease and their liver function is expected to remain normal throughout life [5,8].
Intrahepatic portal hypertension is most often caused by
chronic liver disease, with the majority of preventable
cases attributed to excessive alcohol consumption, viral
hepatitis, or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [9]. As a
result, the pathology related to portal hypertension is
associated with the pathology of chronic liver disease
[10].

portal tract with three equidistant partial ligations. In
brief, three partial ligations are performed in the superior,
medial and inferior portion of the portal vein, respectively, and maintained in position by their previous fixation to a sylastic guide. The stenoses are calibrated by a
simultaneous ligation around the portal vein and a 20-G
needle [16,17] (Figure 1).
At two weeks of evolution, portal hypertension is a consequence of a pathological increase in the portal venous
inflow ("forward" hypothesis) and resistance ("backward" hypothesis) [18,19]. The increase in blood flow in
the portal venous system is established through the
splanchnic arteriolar vasodilation that produces hyperdynamic splanchnic circulation or splanchnic hyperemia
[20]. In turn, the increase in vascular resistance to the portal blood flow is found in the presinusoidal (PVL) hepatic
circulation, as well as the portal collateral circulation

Post-hepatic portal hypertension, as the intrahepatic form
is also associated with hepatocellular dysfunction [11].
Therefore, for the experimental study of portal hypertension, the prehepatic form is usually chosen since it has the
least degree of hepatic affectation. In particular, the most
frequently used experimental model of prehepatic portal
hypertension is that which is achieved by partial portal
vein ligation (PVL) in the rat [12-14].
The aim of this review is to integrate the complications
related to chronic liver disease by using both, the array of
mast cell functions and mediators, since they possibly are
involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of these
complications.

Experimental prehepatic portal hypertension
PVL in various animals, but particularly in the rat, has
been widely used to study portal hypertension [12,14,15].
The surgical technique is simple. In brief, the rat is anesthetized and after laparotomy, the portal vein is dissected
and isolated. A 20-gauge blunt-tipped needle is placed
alongside the portal vein and a ligature is tied around the
needle and the vein. The needle is immediately removed,
yielding a calibrated stenosis of the portal vein [12].
If it is taken into account that the intensity of the portal
hypertension is determined by the resistance to the inflow
produced by the constriction of the portal vein, this
model of prehepatic portal hypertension could be
improved by increasing the initial resistance to the blood
flow. With this objective in mind, we have modified the
surgical technique by increasing the length of the stenosed

Alterations related to prehepatic portal hypertension in the rat, where mast cells and their mediators
could participate in its production. The systemic inflammatory response would integrate splanchnic alterations (portal hypertensive enteropathy, hepatic steatosis, splenomegaly
and portosystemic collateral circulation) with extrasplanchnic alterations (portal hypertensive encephalopathy).

(enhanced portosystemic collateral resistance) [21,22].
Thus, normalization of elevated portal pressure can only
be achieved by attempting to correct both, elevated portal
blood flow and elevated portal resistance [21] (Figure 1).
The hyperdynamic circulation stands out among the systemic alterations related to portal hypertension [22]. This
vasodilatory state in short-term (2–4 weeks) PVL rats has
been principally attributed to two mechanisms: increased
circulating vasodilators and decreased response to vasoconstrictors [22-24]. The vasodilators involved include
nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), alpha-tumoral
necrosis factor (TNF-α), glucagon, prostacyclin (PGI2),
endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, endocannabinoids, adrenomedullin and hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
[22]. In turn, the hyporeactivity to the vasoconstrictors,
that is, to endogenous ones (norepinephrine, endothelin,
vasopressin) or exogenous (alpha agonists) reflect the
impaired vasoconstrictor response, which contributes to
vasodilation [25]. Furthermore, it is conceivable that there
might be different mechanisms underlying the hyporeactivity of vasoconstrictors in portal hypertension.
It has been proposed that the splanchnic and systemic
vasodilation is the initial step leading to the hyperdynamic syndrome or progressive vasodilatory syndrome
[22]. Multi-organ failure in chronic liver disease is in large
part attributable to this syndrome [22,26] (Figure 2).
In the early evolutive phase of prehepatic portal hypertension in the rat, mainly two types of portosystemic collat-

eral circulation are established: splenorenal and
paraesophageal [27]. The development of the portal collateral venous system is not only due to the opening of
preexisting vessels, but also to new vessel formation,
which is a very active process. Particularly, it has been
shown that portal hypertension in the rat is associated
with VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) induced
angiogenesis [28] (Figure 1).
An increased systemic angiogenic response is a common
finding in patients with overt liver diseases or advanced
cirrhotic stages [22,29-31]. In this late stage the impaired
modulation of vascular growth with deregulation of vascular remodeling is a pathophysiological mechanism that
not only participates in the production of splanchnic
alterations (portosystemic collateral circulation, cirrhotic
liver and hypertensive portal intestinal vasculopathy)
[9,30,32] but also in different systemic alterations
(hepatic encephalopathy, portopulmonary hypertension,
vascular spiders and digital clubbing) [22,29,31,33].
Therefore, the angiogenic response developed in portal
hypertension and mainly located in the splanchnic area
seems to progress when it is associated with a chronic liver
disease. In this way, the existence of a progressive angiogenic syndrome would be proposed that contributes significantly to structural splanchnic and systemic
remodeling [34] (Figure 2).
The crosstalk between the vasodilator and angiogenic
responses, both in prehepatic portal hypertension and in
chronic liver failure, would be represented by the inflammatory response, established in both conditions. This
relation would be based on the fact that both vasodilatory
and angiogenic responses are also components of the
inflammatory response [35-38].

The successive pathophysiological mechanisms that
develop in the interstitium of tissues when they undergo
inflammation are considered increasingly complex
trophic functional systems for using oxygen [36,38].
The nervous or immediate functional system presents
ischemia-revascularization and edema, which favor nutrition by diffusion through the injured tissue. This trophic
mechanism has a low energy requirement that does not
require oxygen (ischemia) or in which the oxygen is not
correctly used, with the subsequent development of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) (reperfusion). In this phase, while the progression of the
interstitial edema increases the space between the epithelial cells and the capillaries, the lymphatic circulation is
simultaneously activated (circulatory switch). Thus, the

[38].

(N)
VASOCONSTRICTION (ISCHEMIA)

In the following immune or intermediate phase of the
inflammatory response, the tissues and organs which have
suffered ischemia-reperfusion, are infiltrated by inflammatory cells and bacteria. Interstitial infiltration is favored
by the actions of intrinsic and extrinsic components of the
coagulation cascades. In the tissues and organs which suffer oxidative stress, symbiosis of the inflammatory cells
and bacteria for extracellular digestion by enzyme release
(fermentation) and by intracellular digestion (phagocytosis) could be associated with a hypothetical trophic capacity. Improper use of oxygen persists in this immune phase
and is also associated with enzymatic stress. Furthermore,
lymphatic circulation plays a major role and macrophages
and dendritic cells migrate to lymph nodes where they
activate T lymphocytes.
It is considered that angiogenesis characterizes the last or
endocrine phase of the inflammatory response, so nutrition mediated by the blood capillaries is established.
However, the angiogenic process becomes active early on
and excessive proliferation of endothelial cells occurs
which, in turn, develops a great density of endothelial
sprouts. Through this initial and excessive proliferation,
the endothelial cells could successively perform antioxidant and antienzymatic functions. These functions would
favor the evolution of the inflammatory response towards
tissue repair through specialized capillary development. If
so, it would be in this last phase of the inflammatory
response when the process of angiogenesis would be
responsible for tissue nutrition through the capillaries.
Oxygen and oxidative metabolism are an excellent combination through which the cells can obtain an abundant
energy supply (energetic stress) for tissue repair by epithelial regeneration or wound healing [34,36-39] (Figure 3).

The inflammatory response mediated by mast
cells in experimental portal hypertension
PVL rats are far from having a uniform evolution, since
they can present wide variability in both hepatic weight,
or degree of liver atrophy [27], as well as in the type and
degree of portosystemic collateral circulation developed
[19,27]. Furthermore, the variability of this experimental
model of prehepatic portal hypertension is not only
observed in short-term evolution (14 to 28 days) which is
where it is studied most, but also in the chronic evolutive
stages (6 to 14 months) [40].
One of the reasons that the prehepatic portal hypertension experimental model presents great evolutive variability could be based on its inflammatory nature [34]. Thus,

matic inflammatory response as unifiers of the phylogeny,
and therefore with the category of generics [39], could
also participate in the production of the alterations related
to portal hypertension.
It has been considered that portal hypertension is essentially a type of vascular pathology resulting from the
chronic action of mechanical energy on splanchnic
venous circulation [41]. This kind of energy can stimulate
the endothelium which, owing to its strategic position,
plays an exceedingly important role in regulating the vascular system by integrating diverse mechanical and biochemical signals and by responding to them through the
release of vasoactive substances, cytokines, growth factors
and hormones [42-44]. Mechanical energy may also act in
the vascular endothelium as stress stimuli, generating an
inflammatory response [43-45]. If it is considered that, in
the case of portal hypertension, there is an endothelial
inflammatory response induced by mechanical energy
that affects the splanchnic venous circulation and, by
extension, the organs into which its blood drains, it could
be speculated that there is a common etiopathogeny that
integrates the pathophysiological alterations presented by
these organs [41].
Mast cells, strategically located close to blood vessels [46],
could be among the first responders to the mechanical
stimuli that initiate splanchnic inflammation in rats with
prehepatic portal hypertension. When appropriately activated, mast cells have the ability to produce vasoactive
amines, enzymes (proteases), cytokines, chemokines and
growth factors through degranulation [46,47]. This plas-

ticity of the mast cells, which is the base for the called
"mast cell heterogeneity" [48] suggests that mast cells can
also show diverse responsiveness during the splanchnic
inflammatory response related to the pathological
increase of portal pressure. Thus, during the inflammatory
response evolution, genetic and environmental factors
can position or "tune" mast cells within a broad spectrum
of functional responsiveness [46]. If so, mast cells could
successively participate, by piecemeal degranulation
[46,47], in the expression of the three trophic functional
systems, which have been previously proposed, as components of the inflammatory response [36,38] (Figure 4).
Mature mast cells can be found in almost every tissue, but
they are preferentially localized in organs that are in contact with the environment, namely the skin, airways and
gut [49]. That is why, when pathological splanchnic
venous hypertension is produced, the gastrointestinal
tract becomes an organ predisposed to host the inflammatory response mediated by its resident mast cells.

Mast cells in portal hypertensive enteropathy
Mature mast cells, normally resident close to the gastrointestinal blood vessels and epithelia [46,49], immediately
and directly suffer the sudden increase in venous pressure
produced by the PVL in the rat.
In an early period, portal venous hyperpressure is highest
[18,19] since portosystemic collateral circulation has not
yet developed, and the intestinal mucosa ischemia is an
immediate consequence of the venous stasis. Mucosal
hypoxia is also related to the constriction of mucosal arterioles, meanwhile the dilation of arterioles in the muscularis increases the blood flow in this layer [50]. Hypoxia

in the intestinal mucosa causes oxidative and nitrosative
stress. However, though hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1), it also enhances the expression of hypoxia responsive
genes, and therefore improves cell survival in conditions
of limited oxygen availability [45].
Two days after PVL in the rat, portal hyperpressure is associated with intraperitoneal free exudates, peripancreatic
edema, hypoproteinemia and hypoalbuminemia. The
inflammatory nature of these alterations can be hypothesized, since the oral administration of budesonide prevents these early exudative changes [51]. The venous
hyperpressure associated with hypoxia could be an important trigger of the splanchnic mast cell activation in the
earlier periods of prehepatic portal hypertension in the
rat. Degranulation of mast cells results in the release of
preformed mediators such as histamine, a potent vasodilator and exudative mediator [49,52]. Histamine can
cause exudation related to an endothelial permeability
increase, which is the cause of swelling and production of
peritoneal exudate in this early evolutive phase of experimental portal hypertension [51].
The inhibition of this acute inflammatory response by
budesonide would indicate the efficacy of this steroid in
the prophylaxis of this early acute response. It could be
speculated that budesonide produces a down-regulation
of the pro-inflammatory mediators partially due at least to
an inhibitory effect on the transcription factors that regulate inflammatory gene induction, including activator
protein-1 (AP-1) and NF-κB, and through mechanisms
similar to those that also act with great efficiency on the
allergic inflammatory response to allergens [53,54]. It has
been also described that corticosterone has a rapid inhibitory effect on histamine release from rat peritoneal mast
cells which the classical genomic mechanisms could not
explain [55]. Taken all together, these results suggest that
mast cells could be key cells in the early stages of acute
portal hypertensive splanchnic inflammation (Figure 4).

We have shown that prophylaxis with Ketotifen, an antiinflammatory drug that stabilizes mast cells [56], reduces
portal pressure, the number of degranulated mast cells in
the cecum and the concentration of mast cell protease II
(RMCP-II) in the mesenteric lymphatic nodes of rats with
early (48 hours) prehepatic portal hypertension [57].
Although histamine and serotonin stand out among the
mediators released by mast cells and cause vasodilation
and edema due to increased vascular permeability
[46,48], neutral proteases may also regulate the tone of
the splanchnic vascular bed and provoke matrix degradation and edema [58]. Particularly RMCP-II, considered a
specific marker of rat mucosal mast cell degranulation,
can modulate the vascular function through their ability
to convert Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II. It also may pro-

mote epithelial permeability. Angiotensin II is a powerful
vasoconstrictor that produces mucosal ischemia and also
increases vascular permeability and promotes recruitment
of inflammatory cells into tissues [59]. Furthermore, both
Angiotensin II, which produces vasoconstriction and
mucosal ischemia, and RMCP-II, which increases intestinal permeability and enhances antigen and bacteria
uptake, consequently induce bacterial translocation to the
mesenteric lymph nodes where they would activate a
"chemotactic call" to mast cells and worsen the inflammatory responses [60]. Therefore, Ketotifen could inhibit
mast cell migration and activation in the mesenteric
lymph nodes and thus reduce the release of mediators
involved in the development of the increased portal
venous inflow that causes portal hypertension in shortterm PVL rats [57].
In a later evolutive phase (4 weeks) portal hypertension is
associated with features of hyperdynamic circulation
[18,19]. In this model of pre-hepatic portal hypertension,
splanchnic and systemic vasodilation is the initial step
leading to the hyperdynamic syndrome [22]. Also the
hyperdynamic circulation could favor the maintenance of
the inflammatory response that has been proposed as
characteristic of this experimental model. [34,41]. Particularly, the hyperdynamic splanchnic circulation could be
involved in the persistence of a low grade gastrointestinal
inflammation. First, since the pathological increase of the
portal pressure associated to the hyperdynamic splanchnic circulation, could favor a disturbed splanchnic venous
flow, with shear stress mediated by non-laminar flow
[22]. Unidirectional laminar shear stimulates production
of NO and in the long-term decreases ROS production
and has anti-inflammatory effects [61,62]. In contrast,
non-laminar flow or disturbed flow associated with low
shear stress have profound effects on biology of the vascular wall, particularly the vascular endothelium, and could
stimulate inflammation [61]. Second, both the increase in
blood flow speed and the opening of the arterio-venous
shunts that induce the splanchnic hyperdynamic circulation, would reduce the oxygen tissue availability. This fact
would induce tissue hypoxia and, therefore the chronicity
of the inflammatory response (Figure 4).
Splanchnic and systemic hyperdynamic circulation,
related to progressive vasodilation and the development
of arteriovenous splanchnic and systemic shunts, are associated with water and sodium retention [14,22,26]. The
early development of portosystemic collaterals in PVL rats
associated with the splanchnic hyperdynamic circulation
could fundamentally represent the switch of the splanchnic portal system in a big arterio (splanchnic)-venous
(systemic) shunt. Thus, progressive hyperhydration and
salinization of the body produces the expansion of the
plasma volume and play a fundamental role in perpetuat-

ing and aggravating the hyperdynamic syndrome [22,26]
(Figure 4).
Portal hypertensive rats at six weeks of evolution show
increased mast cell infiltration in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum and superior mesenteric lymph node complex [63,64]. Mast cells are normally found in great
density in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract [65].
This accumulation at tissue sites where foreign materials
attempt to invade the host suggests that mast cells are
among the first cells to initiate defense mechanisms [6668]. This function of mast cells in the gastrointestinal
tract, which provides a barrier against infection, could
explain their increase in the small bowel in rats with prehepatic portal hypertension [64].
Mast cells have the unique capacity to store presynthesized TNF-α and thus can spontaneously release this
cytokine after they are activated [69]. Therefore, the excess
number of mast cells in the small bowel and in the
mesenteric lymph node complex of PVL rats could be
related to their ability to release the stored TNF-α when an
appropriate stimulus is acting. It has been hypothesized
that TNF-α causes vasodilation through both the PGI2 and
NO pathways [69]. If so, the release of the stored TNF-α
by activated mast cells may be involved in the development of the hyperdynamic splanchnic state [70].
Maybe mast cells also contribute to avoid the risk of
hemostasis and portal thrombosis in PVL rats, which
would be related to the splanchnic hemodynamic impairments, through the expression of tissue type plasminogen
activator (t-PA) which induces fibrinolysis and heparin
production [71]. The convergence between the clotting
system and complement [72], both of which form proteolytic cascades, probably originated from a common
ancestral developmental-immune cascade [73], which
suggests that their activation occurs simultaneously in this
experimental model of prehepatic portal hypertension.
This concurrent activation of hemostasis and Complement cascades, could be regarded as a critical mediator of
mast cell activation [65,68,72,74].
Portal hypertension is one factor determining bacterial
intestinal translocation [74]. A reduced bacterial translocation rate is recorded in simple PVL rats [75]. However,
in triple-PVL- rats it has been shown that the incidence of
intestinal bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph
nodes increases significantly [76]. Mast cells can prevent
dangerous bacterial translocation in PVL rats developing
thus a protective role in defense against infections
[46,67,68]. In this way, mast cell activation could be
regarded in PVL rats in the context of antibacterial host
defense preserving the rat life during the course of innate
and adaptive host response against pathogens [68] includ-

ing modulation of both dendritic cell and T-cell responses
[77-79]. Growing evidence suggests physiological roles
for intestinal mast cells in the protection of tissues from
inflammatory damage [65,67,68,77,79].
In addition to initiating innate immune response in the
gastrointestinal tract [46,52,60], mast cells are central in
the initiation and regulation of the adaptive immunity
[52,68,69,79,80]. Mast cells by TNF-dependent [81,82]
and TNF-independent (complement) [83] mechanisms
induce hypertrophy of the draining lymph nodes. Both
mechanisms could be involved in the mesenteric lymph
node hypertrophy that the PVL rats present (Figure 1)
since in the absence of mast cells, bacteria and their products alone do not initiate nodal hypertrophy [81].
The increased presence of mast cells in the hypertrophied
mesenteric lymph nodes of PVL-rats has been suggested,
which could be related to migration from the inflamed
intestine. In turn, the activation of the mast cells in the
mesenteric lymph nodes in these rats with portal hypertension, would not only collaborate in the production of
mesenteric adenitis, but also would constitute a source of
inflammatory mediators located between the intestine
and systemic blood circulation [64].
The lymph tissue associated with the intestine constitutes
the largest lymphatic organ of the body and its activation
in portal hypertensive enteropathy would produce the
release of inflammatory mediators [84]. These would be
transported by the intestinal lymph vessels to the pulmonary circulation-inducing and inflammatory phenotypeand later to the systemic circulation. The priority of
mesenteric lymphatic circulation with respect to portal
circulation for transporting pro-inflammatory mediators
released in the intestinal wall in different conditions
related to intestinal ischemia, such as hemorrhagic shock
or serious burns [85], suggests that in other conditions
that also produce a hyperdynamic splanchnic state with
intestinal ischemia, like prehepatic portal hypertension,
the mesenteric lymph is a regional pro-inflammatory
mediator vehicle, that is, a splanchnic one, but with a systemic effect [41] (Figure 4).
Due to the destructive potential of proteases, they have
been considered to act primarily as degradative enzymes
in the interstitial space [86,87]. However, these enzymes
make important contributions to intestinal immune
response [52,88] and that is why they could collaborate in
the production of portal hypertension enteropathy mediated by mast cells. Tissue responses to these enzymes are
modulated by protease-activated receptors (PARs) [89], a
new subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors that use a
fascinating mechanism to convert an extracellular proteolytic cleavage event into a trans-membrane signal [90].

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/5/1/44

RMCP-II, a product of rodent mast cell degranulation, in
addition to other serine proteases such as thrombin and
tripsin, through PARs activation, may modulate the
splanchnic immune response in PVL rats. The demonstration that PARs may link mast-cell derived proteases to
experimental bladder inflammation [90] is the basis for
this hypothetical relation.
After activation in the intestine of PVL rats, mast cell could
migrate, via afferent lymphatics to mesenteric lymph
nodes where they mediate T lymphocyte recruitment to
facilitate antigen presentation and the initiation of an
adaptive response. The contribution of mast cells to the
induction of this immune response has been demonstrated during the sensitization phase of dinitrofluorobenzene-induced contact hypersensitivity in mice [91].
In this study it is not only demonstrated that fluorescentlabeled mast cells injected in the skin appeared in draining lymph nodes after antigen application, but also that
they subsequently migrate to the spleen [91].
Spleen enlargement is often detected in PVL rats accompanied by the rise in portal venous pressure [40,41]. However, congestion cannot be considered as the only cause of
splenomegaly, since other pathogenic mechanisms,
including the immune ones, participate in its production
[92,93]. Rats with bile duct ligation present hypodynamic
intrasplenic circulation, associated with decreased TNF-α
and eNOS phosphorylation and increased VEGF expression [94].
Histamine is synthesized and stored in the vesicles of mast
cells [46,49,79] and is involved in regulation and modulation of immune response through the stimulation of
four subtypes of receptors present on the target cells [95].
It has been speculated that higher content of histamine in
the spleen could attenuate the immunological response
through histamine receptors in T lymphocytes, macrophages and mast cells. Moreover, higher content of histamine in spleen may possibly change the Th1/Th2 balance
through histamine receptors in T lymphocytes [95]. In
portal hypertensive-rats at six weeks of evolution, the
increase in diameter and number of blood vessels in the
submucosa has already been shown in the duodenum,
which at the same time is correlated with mast cell infiltration [63]. Therefore, vasodilation and angiogenesis,
which are responsible for the increase in size and number
of vessels, and in turn, for vascular structural alterations
that characterize portal hypertensive enteropathy [96-98]
can be attributed to, among other factors, the pathophysiological effects produced by the excessive release of mast
cell mediators [63,64] (Figure 4).
Since 1985 when McCormack et al. [99] described hypertensive gastropathy in patients with portal hypertension,

successive histological studies on the remaining portions
of the gastrointestinal tract have demonstrated that alterations similar to gastric ones are found in the duodenum,
jejunum, ileum, colon and rectum [97,98]. Since the basic
structural alteration found in the gastrointestinal tract is
vascular and consists of increased size and number of the
vessels, the very appropriate name of "hypertensive portal
intestinal vasculopathy" has been proposed [96].
The ability of the mast cells for the synthesis and selective
or dedifferentiated release of different mediator molecules
of the inflammatory response [46,79] would explain their
participation in the different evolutive phases of the portal hypertensive enteropathy. In particular, in the last
phases, the chemotactic factors derived from the mast
cells stimulate the proliferation of fibroblasts and the synthesis of collagen. Meanwhile, histamine and heparine
promote the formation of new blood vessels. Both fibrogenesis and angiogenesis are responsible for fibromuscular and vascular proliferation in the intestinal wall,
respectively [41].
Splanchnic hyperemia, increased splanchnic vascularization and the development of portal-systemic collateral circulation in portal hypertensive rats are partly a VEGFdependent angiogenic processes [28,100]. Extrahepatic
portosystemic collateral circulation persists in long-term
(3, 6 and 12 months) PVL rats [17,27]. However, in these
chronic evolutive phases, although the animals present
collateral circulation, this is not always associated with
portal hypertension [40,41]. That is why it has been proposed that long-term collateral vasculopathy in PVL rats
constitutes a remodeling process not associated with portal hypertension [101].
Ischemic mucosal injury could be the main inducing stimulus for the expression of the potent angiogenic factor
VEGF in the intestine of PVL rats and, therefore one of the
most important mediators in the production of hypertensive portal intestinal vasculopathy in this experimental
model [63,64]. And so mast-cell derived histamine has a
variety of functions in the inflammatory response regulation including VEGF production via H2 receptor stimulation [102]. Also production and release of angiogenic
(VEGF) and growth factors by mast cells [46] in the intestinal mucosa and submucosa of PVL rats could have a role
in modulating this splanchnic angiogenic process
[41,103].
The angiogenic hyperactivity that occurs in the prehepatic
portal hypertensive model, could constitute an extending
and progressively intense process or a "progressive angiogenic syndrome". That is, it would initiate in the
splanchnic area (portosystemic collateral circulation,
splenomegaly and intestinal vasculopathy) and it would

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/5/1/44

reach a systemic diffusion during its evolution (peripheral
systemic vasculopathy affecting the extrasplanchnic
organs).
The earliness, intensity and diffusion which establishes
angiogenic hyperactivity in PVL rats, suggests that the
endothelial cells could carry out other functions aside
from forming new blood vessels. And so, the anti-oxidant
and anti-enzymatic properties of the endothelium could
stand out [104]. The expression of anti-oxidant and antienzymatic functions by the endothelial cells during the
evolution of the splanchnic inflammatory response in
PVL rats would therefore represent a defensive mechanism. This early hypothetical endothelial proliferation
would constitute a local mechanism to counteract both
oxidative stress and enzymatic stress, inherent to the
inflammatory response (Figure 4).
The angiogenic response also contributes significantly to
structural splanchnic and systemic remodeling. The structural changes that are produced in the long-term in prehepatic portal hypertension in the rat, could be similar to
those described in other chronic inflammatory processes.
These morphological alterations would not only be vascular, both macro and microscopic, but also the rest of the
intestinal structures would participate in greater or lesser
intensity [105]. In particular, the morphological vascular
alterations stand out in chronic portal hypertensive enteropathy [96-98]. However, we have also described, in the
experimental chronic portal hypertensive enteropathy,
the existence of epithelial remodeling, which consists in
goblet cell hyperplasia [105,106]. Goblet cell hyperplasia
with mucus hypersecretion is an alteration characteristic
of epithelial remodeling of the respiratory tract in chronic
inflammatory processes, as are asthma and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease [107,108]. And so, goblet
cell hyperplasia could be attributed to chronic hypertensive portal enteropathy in the rat [105,106]. Mucus
secreted by goblet cells into the intestinal lumen, constitute a component of the mucosal defense [67]. But also
goblet cells can secrete into the lumen of the small and
large intestine trefoil peptides. These peptides are protease-resistant factors and their presence both protects
against intestinal epithelial injury and promotes repair
[109].
Therefore, mast cells and their mediators could participate
in the production of morphological alterations characteristic of the splanchnic remodeling associated with experimental prehepatic portal hypertension [41].
And so it could be considered that in prehepatic portal
hypertension in the rat, a low-degree chronic splanchnic
inflammatory response is produced that would evolve in
three dominating successive expression of pathological

Page 8 of 15

Journal of Translational Medicine 2007, 5:44

functional systems called the nervous, immune and endocrine. Since mast cells are functionally heterogeneous and
participate in the establishment of these three systems, it
could be considered that their intervention in this type of
splanchnic inflammatory response is indispensable.

Mast cells in portal hypertensive encephalopathy
Prehepatic portal hypertension in humans is associated
with neuropsychological and brain magnetic resonance
changes consistent with minimal hepatic encephalopathy
[110]. Since intrinsic hepatocellular disease does not exist
in this type of portal hypertension, the existence of a portal-systemic bypass is the principal cause of minimal
hepatic encephalopathy. Consequently, this encephalopathy is categorized as type B [111].
The PVL rat model could be appropriate for the experimental study of the minimal hepatic encephalopathy
related to prehepatic portal hypertension because portalsystemic shunting is developed [12,18]. Hence, it should
be considered that an associated hepatic pathology exists
[41] (FIGURE 1).
A histological study of the liver of PVL rat, has demonstrated that hepatocytic fatty infiltration exists. Fat accumulation in the hepatocytes progress from a short- (1
month) to a long-term (1 year) evolutive stage of portal
hypertension and thus the persistence of etiopathogenic
mechanisms involved in its production could be considered. Therefore, it could also be considered that PVL in the
rat not only makes it possible to obtain an experimental
model of portal hypertension but also a steatosis model
[41,112-114].
The important role that inflammation has on modulatingthe molecular pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy
has recently been highlighted [33]. Inflammation, however, may not only be limited to modulating the severity
of hepatic encephalopathy but also could indeed be its
own pathophysiological mechanism [33,34]. If so, the
inflammation of the central nervous system, when related
to prehepatic portal hypertension [34], could be the basic
mechanism that drives the essential nature of minimal
hepatic encephalopathy [34].
At one month of evolution, prehepatic portal hypertensive-rats present increased SDF-1 alpha levels in the hippocampus and cerebellum associated with increased TNFα and CXCR4 levels in the hippocampus [115]. The
increase of the chemokine system CXCR4/SDF-1 alpha in
the hippocampus could be related to a remodeling structural process since SDF-1 alpha, a pro-inflammatory
cytokine, regulates neurodevelopmental processes in the
central nervous system and neuronal migration [116].

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/5/1/44

Chemokines have a dual role as neurodegenerative or
neuroprotective molecules in the central nervous system.
In experimental portal hypertensive encephalopathy,
chemokines can contribute to creating an immune phase
in the hippocampus and cerebellum that does not necessarily involve only harmful phenomena, but rather exerts
a beneficial remodeling action [34]. The objective would
be to adapt cerebral areas to the new metabolic state created by portal hypertension [33]. At the same time, the
brain changes demonstrated in this experimental model
of portal hypertension could be related to the development of a minimal hepatic encephalopathy [115].
Mast cells can be found in areas of the central nervous system of many mammalian species. Mast cells in rats are
predominantly located in the thalamic region of the brain
[117,118]. Since these cells, when activated, could translocate from the splanchnic area to the central nervous system [119] we have hypothesized that mast cells would be
involved in a splanchnic-brain chemokine-mediated
crosstalk [115]. Mast cells can migrate from the splanchnic region to the brain, and release different neurotransmitters and neuromodulators such as monoamines,
proteases, cytokines and histamine [118]. Mast cellderived products also can enter neurons by a process
termed transgranulation, a novel form of brain-immune
system communication [120].
Since the gastrointestinal tract is known to contain the
most extensive immune system in the body as well as the
largest and most diverse collection of nerves outside the
central nervous system, there is an ample opportunity for
these inflammatory cells to interact with neurons [121].
In this way, the enteric nervous system is considered a
local "minibrain" [122]. Hence, mast cell degranulation
can release mediators that can signal intrinsic and extrinsic neurons [122] and also provide a connection node
between the central nervous system and enteric nervous
system [121,122]. The evidence for a bidirectional crosstalk between mucosal mast cells and the enteric and central nervous systems [121,122] suggest that these
inflammatory cells are potential integrators of the systemic inflammatory response that induces portal hyertension.

Chronic liver disease and portal hypertension
The functional ability of the liver could be considered one
of the most important factors for modulating the evolution of the syndrome induced by portal hypertension. Particularly, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis can aggravate
the portal hypertensive inflammatory syndrome exceedingly [34].
The most studied models of cirrhosis in the rat are those
achieved by extrahepatic cholestasis [14,123,124], and by

Page 9 of 15

Journal of Translational Medicine 2007, 5:44

administering carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) [14,125] or
(TAA) [101,126]. Hepatic fibrogenesis is the common
final result of injury to the liver. Furthermore, fibrosis is
believed to be a critical factor that leads to hepatic dysfunction [127].
Hepatic dysfunction related to fibrosis or cirrhosis in the
rat would aggravate the grade of systemic inflammation
characteristic of prehepatic portal hypertension and as a
result would increase the incidence of complications [34].
It has been recognized that liver mast cells are present
under normal and pathological conditions in both
humans and experimental animals [128]. There is evidence that mast cells are involved in various hepatobiliary
disorders [128-130]. Mast cells have been shown to promote fibroblast proliferation. They are found in the periportal sinusoids joining the destruction and inflamed
limiting plates in chronic liver diseases and biliary/cholestatic diseases, suggesting that they are at least involved in
inflammation and periportal fibrosis [128,131,132].
Therefore, mast cells can be considered key elements during liver fibrosis of any etiology [132,133].
Mast cells also are involved in the regulation of physiological and pathological hepatic vasculogenesis to which they
contribute by producing mediators such as heparin, histamine, tryptase, TNF-α, transforming growth factor-beta
(TGF-β) and VEGF [46,49]. In this way, it has been
hypothesized that mast cells may be primary elements in
the transition from sinusoidal to capillary-type endothelial cells [134]. Mast cell mediated diffuse hepatic sinusoidal capillarization may therefore be pathogenically
significant in the progression of liver disease [134].
One important consequence of chronic liver disease is
that both the local and systemic anti-oxidant function of
the liver is reduced [135]. A decreased anti-oxidant capacity of the liver plays an important role in the pathogenesis
of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis and portal hypertension
[136,137]. That is why, anti-oxidants have been proposed
as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of portal hypertension [135,136]. However, the deficient anti-oxidant
ability of the liver when suffering from fibrosis or cirrhosis
could also induce the production of a systemic pathology.
In this hypothetical situation, in prehepatic portal hypertensive-rats with chronic oxidative stress and a low-grade
inflammatory state, the reduction of the hepatic anti-oxidant capacity would increase the intensity of the inflammatory systemic response and add severity to this
syndrome [34,40].
Therefore, the relationship between the liver anti-oxidative capacity and the severity of the systemic complications could be more important than the grade of
splanchnic and systemic oxidative stress. Aside from the

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/5/1/44

degree of oxidative stress, the reduction of the hepatic
anti-oxidant capacity would aggravate the intensity of the
inflammatory response [34]. In this hypothetical situation, the progressive evolution of the chronic liver disease,
would be associated with a progressive reduction of its
anti-oxidant capacity and as a consequence, it would favor
the systemic inflammatory response. Since the proposed
inflammatory response is based on the successive functional predominance of the nervous, immune and endocrine systems [36,38] it could be considered that the
worsening of the systemic hyperdynamic circulation associated with an ischemia-revascularization (nervous) phenomenon would favor the progression of tissue
infiltration by inflammatory cells and bacteria (immune).
Therefore, the remodeling of the body would become

more intense, favoring both splanchnic and systemic angiogenesis (endocrine) (Figure 5).
Mast cells can significantly influence multiple factors of
chronic inflammatory responses, though diverse effects
that can either promote or, perhaps more surprisingly,
suppress aspects of these responses [138]. In the case of
the chronic liver disease complicating the evolution of
portal hypertension, mast cells could participate as regulators of the inflammatory response evolution. And so,
during the evolution of this disease, harmful factors can
position or "tune" mast cells within a broad spectrum of
functional responsiveness [46] that would favor or restrict
the progression of the inflammatory response.
Chronic liver disease could favor the expression in the
body of a dedifferentiation process. Through this defensive mechanism, the functions with a higher energy
requirement would be reduced [36,38]. In particular, the
specialized epithelial cells have high energy costing functions. These epithelial cells have nutrition mediated by
blood capillaries. The combination of elevated capillary
support of oxygen with the oxidative metabolism (oxidative phosphorylation) allows epithelial cells to obtain an
abundant energy supply, which is used to drive multiple
specialized processes with limited heat generation (coupled reaction) [38]. In the evolution of the chronic liver
disease, the systemic inflammatory response could repre-

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/5/1/44

sent the establishment of lesser energy "costing" functions, since using oxygen to get energy is not as effective
(uncoupled reactions). In this hypothetical situation, the
mast cells would collaborate in the expression of the
inflammatory phenotype most appropriate according the
needs of the body (Figure 6).
Therefore, the mast cells could have a defensive and favoring role in high-risk survival situations. The incidence of
harmful influences during the evolution of chronic liver
disease could involve the regression to the most primitive
metabolic stages, and the adoption of an ischemic-reperfusion phenotype (nervous system). The body, under the
effects of an ischemia-reperfusion phenomenon, reduces
its metabolic needs (oxidative stress), favors its hydration
and salinization (water and salt retention) and enhances
nutrition by diffusion (interstitial and cellular edema).
These supposed defense mechanisms are simple but also
less costly, and facilitate temporary survival until a more
favorable environment makes it possible to initiate more
complex metabolic and nutritional functions. Thus, this
would explain why both patients and animals with
chronic liver disease and portal hypertension are predisposed to develop hepatorenal syndrome, ascites and pleural effusion when they suffer harmful influences
[10,11,140]. In essence, they would suffer a process of
reperfusion, a major complication in which mast cells
could participate since they have the right mediators for
inducing this acute-on-chronic pathology in patients and
animals with portal hypertension associated with chronic
liver diseases.

Conclusion
In conclusion, mast cells could participate in the production of a low-grade systemic inflammatory response that
induces portal hypertension. Mast cells also participate in
the worsening of the inflammatory response when a
chronic liver disease is associated. Finally, these fascinating cells collaborate in the decompensation of the systemic inflammatory reaction or acute-on-chronic
response if a precipitating factor prevails.
