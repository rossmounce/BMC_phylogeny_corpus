Abstract
Background: Posttransfusion hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection still occurs although its incidence has been
substantially reduced since the introduction of screening of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in blood donors.
This study aimed to investigate the occult HBV infection in accepted blood donors in Nanjing, China.
Results: The lower detection limit of the nested PCR in this study was estimated to be 20 copies/ml HBV DNA.
The positive rate of occult HBV infection was 0.13% (5 of 2972) in the accepted blood donors. Sequencing data
showed that the amplified HBV sequences were not identical each other and to the known sequences cloned in
our laboratory, excluding the false-positive caused by cross-contamination. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the
HBV in all five donors was genotype B; a single base deletion was detected in the S region of HBV DNA from one
donor, and no mutation was observed in the “a” determinant of HBsAg from four other donors. All five donors
were negative for anti-HBs and one was positive for anti-HBc.
Conclusions: The prevalence of occult HBV infection in the accepted blood donors in Nanjing, China is relatively
high. The data would be meaningful in adapting strategy to eliminate posttransfusion HBV infection in China.

Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the major
health problems worldwide. The infection is usually
defined by the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg) in serum or plasma. However, HBV may exist
in humans without detectable HBsAg but with presence
of HBV DNA in the serum and/or in the liver, i.e. the
occult HBV infection [1]. The occult infection may
result from the low viral load in circulation (usually
<200 IU/ml) [2] or a mutant HBsAg which is not recognized by the monoclonal antibodies against HBsAg
(anti-HBs) used in some commercial detection kits [1,3].
Because of routine screening of blood donors for
HBsAg, the incidence of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis B has been steadily reduced over the last four decades; however HBV transmission remains the most
frequent transfusion-transmitted viral infection [4-6].
The residual risk of HBV transmission by transfusion is
mainly associated with occult HBV infection in blood

donors. Additionally, occult HBV infection also has
significance in bone marrow and organ transplantations
[2,7-9].
Attributed to widespread use of hepatitis B vaccine
and other strategies for control of HBV infection, the
prevalence of HBsAg carrier rate in general population
in China decreased from some 10.0% in 1980 s to 7.2%
in 2006 [10-12]. However, HBV infection is still endemic
in China. Studies have shown that the prevalence of
occult HBV infection is closely related to the endemicity
of HBV infection [13,14], however, the occult HBV
infection in China has been less studied [15-17]. Thus,
we performed this study to investigate the prevalence of
occult HBV infection in blood donors in Nanjing, an
eastern region of China.

Results
The sensitivity of the nested PCR

To determine the sensitivity of the nested PCR developed in this study, we performed the PCR using 10-fold
serially diluted template DNA extracted from a plasma
with a concentration of 2000 copies/ml HBV DNA. As
shown in Figure 1, the minimum copies detected by the
three sets of the primers were all 20 copies/ml HBV

DNA, equivalent to 1 copy per reaction. Thus, the lower
detection limit of the nested PCR using the different
primers was comparable.
Positive rate of HBV DNA in accepted blood donors

The samples in which HBV DNA was detected by at
least two sets of the primers were considered to be
positive for HBV. Of the 2972 accepted blood donors,
5 (0.17%) were determined to have occult HBV infection (Table 1). The plasmas of the nested PCR positive
samples were also measured by fluorescent real-time
PCR, and the results showed that the viral load in each
sample was less than 500 copies/ml. However, when
the three plasmas (200 μl for each) were subjected to
DNA extraction and the extracted DNA was dissolved
in 20 μl TE buffer, HBV DNA became detectable by
the fluorescent quantitation PCR with 2.1 × 10 3 and
1.2 × 10 4 copies/ml respectively. Compared with the
final volume of 40 μl DNA extracted from 20 μl plasmas according to the instruction of the real-time PCR
kit, the DNA extraction steps in this study actually
concentrated the plasma DNA with 20-fold. Thus, by
reverting the concentrated DNA to the original level,
the actual viral loads in these two plasmas were

approximately 105, 110, and 600 copies/ml respectively
(Table 1).
Of the five HBV DNA positive samples, one was positive for anti-HBc and four others were negative, and all
of them were negative for anti-HBs. The ALT of all the
positive samples was normal (Table 1).
HBV sequencing and genotyping

The PCR products amplified by the S region primers
were sequenced; the readable sequences were more than
180 bps and contained the sequences of the “a” determinant of HBsAg. Sequencing data demonstrated that
none of them was identical to the known sequences
detected in our laboratory and there were at least 2 bps
differences among the different plasmas, excluding the
false positive caused by cross-contamination. A single
base deletion was detected in the S region from a
donor, and no mutation in the “a” determinant was
observed in four other donors after comparing with the
known wild sequences in the GenBank. Phylogenetic
analysis of the partial S-gene sequences from the five
samples and corresponding sequences recovered from
GenBank demonstrated that the viruses in the five samples all belonged to genotype B (Figure 2).

Discussion
We investigated the occult HBV infection by detecting
HBV DNA in plasmas from accepted blood donors in
China with nested PCR and found that the positive rate
of HBV DNA was 0.17% (5/2972). Compared with the
risk of posttransfusion HBV infection in countries in
which nucleic acid amplification tests (NAT) are used to
screen HBV in blood donors [18,19], the data in the
present study indicate that there is still substantial risk
for posttransfusion HBV infection in China despite
screening for HBsAg in blood donors.
Although nested PCR is sometimes associated with the
risk of false-positive results, the HBV DNA detected in
this study is unlikely to be caused by cross-contamination

or carryover because of the following reasons: (1) we took
particular precautions in performing each PCR step as
suggested by Kwok and Higuchi [20]; (2) the DNA
extraction and each PCR round were undertaken in different rooms; (3) the positive samples were separately
tested with two different sets of primers and retested by
real-time PCR; and (4) most importantly, the sequencing
data showed that all sequences of the positive samples
were not identical to each other and to the sequences
amplified in our laboratory. On the other hand, the
nested PCR used in this study was highly sensitive as it
detected as low as 20 copies/ml HBV DNA (Figure 1).

Although detection of HBV DNA using liver tissue DNA
extracts can increase the positive rate of occult HBV
infection [21], it is not feasible to get liver tissues from
the blood donors. Thus, under the current circumstance
and with the available techniques, the positive rate of
occult HBV infection detected in this study is less likely
to be underestimated.
The prevalence of occult HBV infection in blood
donors appears to be varied in different countries or
even in different areas in a country. The variations may
be associated with the different assays used in the various surveys and the HBV endemicity. It has been documented that low, intermediate, or high endemic areas
have different occult HBV infection rate; the NAT tests
in blood donors demonstrated that occult HBV infection
in regions with low HBV endemicity, such as Western
countries is rare, whereas in Japan and Hong Kong it is
much higher [22]. Indeed, the occult HBV infection rate
(0.17%) in blood donors in the present study is higher
than that in Western countries like Canada and Germany [23,24], and comparable to that in Ghana [25].
In China, a few relevant studies show substantially
divergent prevalence of occult HBV infection in the
blood donors, ranging from 0.028% (8/28800) in Guangdong Province [26] and 2.71% (18/1698) in Zhejiang
Province [27] to as high as 9.78% (57/583) in Hunan
Province [28]. The relatively low rate in Guangdong
may be due to the mini-pool (24 samples) approach
used in that study. In the present study, we used realtime PCR to detect HBV DNA in all five plasmas with
occult HBV infection, but none of them had a detectable level at a lower detection limit of 500 copies/ml.
On the other hand, the high frequency of 9.8% found
among accepted blood donors in Hunan [28] is questionable, since that report did not exclude the possibility
of cross-contaminations.
Several factors are involved in the recognition of the
occult HBV infection, including viral variants carrying
mutant HBsAg that are not recognized by specific antibodies used in assays for HBsAg [29-32] and low level
expression of HBV genes [33-35]. In the present study,
the mutation in the “a” determinant of S region was
observed in only one donor and there was no mutation
in the “a” determinant in four other donors, yet their
HBV DNA levels were only between 105 and 600 copies/
ml. Thus, strong suppression of viral replication and
gene expression may have resulted from the host
immune responses [36]. Alternatively, since four of the
five occult infections did not show any serological HBV
markers, it is also possible that these samples were collected during the seroconversion window period, in
which case further follow-up may have identified this serologic phenomenon [37]. However, this issue can not be
clarified since we did not follow-up these blood donors.

The occurrence of posttransfusion hepatitis B in China
has been substantially reduced since the introduction of
HBsAg screening of blood donors. However, the true
incidence remains unknown because of the obstacles in
conducting such studies. In the present survey, we
found that 0.17% of the accepted blood donors had
occult HBV infection, which is much higher than that
observed in Western counties as well as in Japan and
Hong Kong. Although the conversion of residual risk of
occult HBV infection into the true rate of infection is
largely unknown, the results in the chimpanzee model
demonstrate that as low as 10 copies of HBV may result
in half of the animals being infected, irrespective of
HBV genotype [38,39]. Considering that our blood
donors had HBV DNA exceed 100 copies/ml, the recipients of these five occult HBV carrier donors were highly
possible to be infected with HBV although we did not
follow-up the recipients. Indeed, numerous reports have
documented that occult HBV infection in blood donors
may cause posttransfusion hepatitis B [40-42].
Currently, only a few financially prosperous cities in
China detect HBV DNA in blood donors by minipool
NAT. We consider that NAT for HBV DNA as a routine screening in blood donors in China will be costeffectiveness, since the risk of HBV transmission by
transfusion in China is relatively high based on our data.
Even in countries with low HBsAg prevalence such as
USA and some European countries, minipool NAT has
been used as a routine test in blood donors [43].

Conclusions
The data in the present study will be meaningful in setting up a strategy to prevent posttransfusion hepatitis B
in China. Because of relatively high rate of occult HBV
infection in blood donors in China, tests for HBV DNA
in blood donors would substantially reduce the incidence of posttransfusion hepatitis B.

anti-HIV, and antibody against treponema pallidum; the
HBsAg in each donor was tested in parallel by two different commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) kits. The donors’ average age was 24.9 years
(range, 18-53). They were 1475 males and 1497 females.
The plasmas were stored at -20°C. All the experiments
were approved by the Ethics Committee of Nanjing
Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing University Medical
School, in accordance with guidelines of the Nation
Health and Medical Research Council of China.
Plasma DNA isolation

DNA was extracted from plasma using phenol-chloroform extraction by the standard method. Briefly, 200 μl
plasma was treated with proteinase K at 50°C for 3 h,
and then DNA was extracted twice by phenol-chloroform and rinsed once by 70% ethanol. Finally, 20 μl
Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer was added to each sample to
dissolve DNA.
Detection of HBV-DNA by nested PCR

Nested PCR was performed using specific primers derived
from the regions coding for HBsAg, hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and pre-C respectively as previously reported
with minor modifications [44-46]. Primer sequences are
shown in Table 2. In brief, the first round PCR was carried
out in a final volume of 50 μl containing 1.25 units of Taq
polymerase (Takara, Dalian, China) and 5 μl DNA template. The amplification was carried out for 35 cycles (20
seconds at 94°C, 30 seconds at 55°C, 45 seconds at 72°C)
after initial denaturation for 2 min. A final extension step
was performed for 10 min at 72°C. The second round PCR
was carried out using 5 μl of the first PCR product under
the same condition as the first round PCR except 25 pmol
of each internal primer was used. The PCR products were
electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gel and stained with

Blood donors

Region

We randomly collected plasma samples from 2972
accepted volunteer donors at the Nanjing Red Cross
Blood Center between February 2007 and April 2008.
Each sample was not directly collected from the donor,
but collected from one tubing segment connected to the
bag of the donor’s blood; each tubing segment was cut
with a fresh blade to avoid cross-contamination among
samples. According to the policy set up by the China
Health Ministry, an accepted donor is defined as a generally healthy person with normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), negative for HBsAg and antibodies against
hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV, and treponema pallidum.
Thus, the laboratory tests in all the 2972 donors showed
to be normal ALT and negative for HBsAg, anti-HCV,

ethidium bromide, and then photographed by image
analysis system (UVP, Upland, CA).
To determine the lower detection limit of the nested
PCR in this study, we carried out the PCR using 10-fold
serially diluted template DNA, which was extracted
from a sample with known concentration of HBV DNA
with 2000 copies/ml. The DNA was extracted from
200 μl serum and dissolved in 200 μl TE.
To prevent carryover or cross contamination during
the extraction of DNA from plasmas and PCR, each
step of the procedure was performed in separate areas
with dedicated equipment. Negative controls, including
plasmas DNA from normal subjects without HBV infection and distilled water, and a positive control (an HBV
DNA positive plasma diluted to 20 copies/ml) were
always included in every nested PCR test.

Quantitative assay of HBV DNA

Competing interests
The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Plasma HBV DNA in occult HBV infections was quantified by real-time PCR with a commercially available
fluorescent real-time PCR assay (Shenyou Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) which had a strict internal quality
control and passed the Clinical Laboratory Center of
Chinese Ministry of Health external quality assessment
on the DNA Engine Opticon 2 System (MJ Research,
Waltham, MA). Plasma DNA was extracted using a
commercial kit (Shenyou Biotechnology) from 20 μl
plasma by boiling. The PCR was run for 40 cycles and
the fluorescence signal of the amplicons was detected by
the DNA Engine Opticon 2 System. The lower detection
limit of this assay was 500 copies/ml with a linear range
of up to 108 copies/ml.
Detection of serological markers for HBV infection

Anti-HBc of the HBV DNA positive samples was measured by ELISA using the Diagnostic kit (Huakang Biotechnology, Shenzhen, China) for anti-HBc.
HBV DNA sequencing and HBV genotyping

The PCR products amplified by S region primers were
purified and directly sequenced on an ABI Prism 3130
sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan)
after reaction with BigDye Terminator v3.1 (Applied
Biosystems, Foster, CA). Sequence analysis and comparison were conducted by using molecular programs
deposited in the web site of the National Centre for Biotechnology Information http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/.
The sequences were compared with the same region of
HBV sequences from different genotypes found in the
genotyping reference set available on the NCBI website
(URL: http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/projects/genotyping/view.
cgi?db=2). The phylogenetic tree was constructed
according to previous methods [47].
