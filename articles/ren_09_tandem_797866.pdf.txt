Abstract
Duplications and rearrangements of coding genes are major themes in the evolution of
mitochondrial genomes, bearing important consequences in the function of mitochondria and the
fitness of organisms. Yu et al. (BMC Genomics 2008, 9:477) reported the complete mt genome
sequence of the oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis (16,475 bp) and found that a DNA segment
containing four tRNA genes (trnK1, trnC, trnQ1 and trnN), a duplicated (rrnS) and a split rRNA gene
(rrnL5') was absent compared with that of two other Crassostrea species. It was suggested that the
absence was a novel case of "tandem duplication-random loss" with evolutionary significance. We
independently sequenced the complete mt genome of three C. hongkongensis individuals, all of
which were 18,622 bp and contained the segment that was missing in Yu et al.'s sequence. Further,
we designed primers, verified sequences and demonstrated that the sequence loss in Yu et al.'s
study was an artifact caused by placing primers in a duplicated region. The duplication and split of
ribosomal RNA genes are unique for Crassostrea oysters and not lost in C. hongkongensis. Our study
highlights the need for caution when amplifying and sequencing through duplicated regions of the
genome.

Background
Because of its nature of maternal inheritance, mitochondrial (mt) genome has a fast rate of evolution and is particularly useful in phylogenetic analysis. The analysis of
complete mt genome sequences provides not only information about nucleotide changes, but also insights into
gene order and rearrangements that are indicative of
major evolutionary changes.
We read with great interest an article appeared in a recent
issue of BMC Genomics (9:477 2008) entitled 'Complete
mitochondrial DNA sequence of oyster Crassostrea hong-

kongensis – a case of "Tandem duplication-random loss"
for genome rearrangement in Crassostrea?' by Yu, Z.N.,
Wei, Z.P., Kong, X.Y., and Shi, W. [1]. Based on our data,
we believe that an important part of Yu et al.'s paper is
incorrect and would like to share our results with the readers of this Journal.
In their paper, Yu et al. (2008) reported that the complete
mt genome of C. hongkongensis is 16,475 bp in length
(GenBank accession number EU266073) and pointed out
that 'A striking finding of this study is that a DNA segment
containing four tRNA genes (trnK1, trnC, trnQ1 and trnN)

and two duplicated or split rRNA genes (rrnL5' and rrnS)
are absent from the genome, when compared with that of
two other extant Crassostrea species, which is very likely a
consequence of loss of a single genomic region present in
ancestor of C. hongkongensis. It indicates this region seem
to be a "hot spot" of genomic rearrangements over the
Crassostrea mt-genomes' (p. 1, Abstract, line 14–19). We
have independently sequenced the complete mt genomes
of three C. hongkongensis individuals. All our three
sequences contained the DNA segment that was reported

missing in Yu et al.'s study. The discrepancy is not trivial
as the loss of the duplicated region was central to Yu et al.'s
hypothesis of a novel "tandem duplication and random
loss" event during the evolution of C. hongkongensis. It was
further suggested that this region was a "hot spot" for
genomic rearrangement. Therefore, it is critical to determine if the loss of the duplicated region is real in view of
the different sequences we obtained.

Experimental design, results and discussion
The three complete mt genome sequences of C. hongkongensis that we independently obtained were submitted to
GenBank: accession No. EU672834 for oyster HN from
Hainan, FJ593172 for oyster BH45 from Guangxi, and
FJ593173 for oyster H50 from Fujian. The length of the
complete mt genome of C. hongkongensis reported by Yu et
al. is 16,475 bp. The length of all three mt sequences that
we obtained is 18,622 bp, which is 2,147 bp longer than
that of Yu et al.'s. We aligned our sequences with that of
Yu et al. and other Crassostrea species. We annotated our
mt sequences according to that of C. gigas with minor revi-

sions [2], and the results are presented in Table 1. Our
sequence for C. hongkongensis has exactly the same gene
order and arrangements as C. gigas, both containing the
segment that is missing in Yu et al.'s sequence. The segment contains four tRNA genes, a duplicated rrnS and part
of the split rrnL. The split rrnL is first discovered in C. virginica and appears to be unique for oysters [2].
The three C. honghongensis oysters used in our study were
from diverse populations (Hainan, Guangxi and Fujian)

covering the entire geographic range of this species as we
know (Guo et al., unpublished), and they were genetically
identified using molecular markers prior to our study [3].
We compared one of our sequences with Yu et al.'s using
BLAST
http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bl2seq/
wblast2.cgi[4]. In the 16,475 shared nucleotides, there are
15 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and the similarity between the two gnomes is 99.91%, suggesting that
oysters used in our study and Yu et al.'s study are all C.
hongkongensis. Sequence identity in major coding genes
between our C. hongkongensis sequences and that of C.
gigas is shown in Table 2. Considerable differentiation
has occurred between the two sister-species at some genes

(i.e., gene identity of 75.1% for nad2) despite the identical gene order. Analysis of all four C. hongkongensis mt
sequences revealed 41 SNPs: 28 in coding and 13 in noncoding regions (Table 3). Of the 19 SNPs from protein
coding genes, only one is non-synonymous, suggesting
strong purifying selection. The non-synonymous mutation occurred at the atp6 gene in Yu's sequence only, and
further studies are needed to determine whether it is a true
SNP or sequencing error.
Yu et al. used ten pairs of primers to amplify the complete
mt genome of C. hongkongensis (p. 11). We carefully studied the positions of each primer and located them in our

*Primer pairs from Yu et al. (2008). Because one or both of the primers are located in the duplicated rrnS gene, two fragments are expected but
only the shorter one is actually amplified.

mt genome sequences of C. hongkongensis (Figure 1). It
occurred to us that Yu et al. might have failed to amplify
the gene block of K1-C-Q1-rrnL5'-N-rrnS2 because some of
their primers were placed in a duplicated region. As
shown in Figure 1, primer pair 1* is located in gene cob
and rrnS1 (or rrnS2), primer pair 2* is completely located
within the duplicated gene rrnS (rrnS1 or/and rrnS2), and
primer pair 3* is located in rrnS2 (or rrnS1) and atp6
(primer pairs 1*, 2* and 3* correspond to the third, the
fourth and the fifth primer pairs in Yu et al.' paper, Table
4). Because these three primer pairs are either completely
or partially (one of the two primers) located in the duplicated gene rrnS1 and rrnS2, they should theoretically
amplify two fragments of different length, but in reality
the smaller fragment may be preferentially amplified and
sequenced. The length of shortest PCR products expected
from the three primer pairs was 2,470 bp, 824 bp and
1,016 bp, respectively (Table 4). Primer pair 2* was completely located in the duplicated gene rrnS (rrnS1 or rrnS2);
thus they may directly concatenate the sequence between
the duplicated gene and artificially lose the gene block of
K1-C-Q1-rrnL5'-N-rrnS2 (Figure 1). The block, 2,147 bp,
may be too large to be amplified under competition with
a smaller fragment.

pairs designed by us successfully amplified and produced
fragments of expected sizes, 2,658 and 1,905 bp (Table 4,
Figure 2), proving that the gene block between the duplicated rrnS genes are actually there. To further confirm that
the two products both contain the duplicated rrnS, each
product was used as PCR template for amplification with
the primers 2* that amplifies rrnS only; both PCR produced a fragment of the expected size (824 bp), the same
as using genomic DNA as template (Figure 2). We also
sequenced some of the fragments, and the sequences are
the same as expected from the mt sequences we obtained.
These results clearly demonstrate that the duplicated rrnS
and the split rrnL exist in the mt genome of C. hongkongensis. There is no loss of the duplicated genes and the gene
block between them. "Tandem duplication-random loss"
is not a real feature of oyster mt genomes and has not
occurred during the evolution of C. hongkongensis. The
possibility of Yu et al. sequenced a rare mutant of C. hongkongensis is extremely low considering: 1) we sequenced
three individuals from three diverse populations; 2) Yu
and colleagues screened more than one individual; and 3)
we duplicated their results with our samples. This is a clear
case of PCR artifacts involving duplicated genes.

Conclusion
To test our hypothesis that the gene block between duplicated rrnS failed to amplify in Yu et al.'s study, we synthesized the three primer pairs used by Yu et al. (after
removing mismatches based on our C. hongkongensis
sequences to improve specificity). As expected, the three
shorter products mentioned in Yu et al.' paper were successfully obtained (Table 4, Figure 2). We increased the
elongation time for PCR trying to obtain the longer fragments, but failed probably because of distance between
the duplicated genes (2,147 bp) is too long. We designed
two new pairs of primers targeting the block between the
duplicated rrnS genes, with one primer of each pair
located in the rrnL gene that was supposed to be absent
according to Yu et al. (Table 4, Fig, 1). The two new primer

In conclusion, the complete mt genome of C. hongkongensis is 18,622 bp in length, and its gene order and arrangement are identical to that of C. gigas. The loss of a gene
segment reported by Yu et al. (2008) was an artifact due to
placing PCR primers in a duplicated gene, and the phenomenon of "tandem duplication-random loss" does not
exist in the mt genome of C. hongkongensis. Our study
highlights the need for caution when amplifying and
sequencing through regions with tandem duplication.
When tandem duplication is expected, it is important to
design long PCR fragments and not place primers in
duplicated regions. Cross-verification with different sets
of primers should be considered.
