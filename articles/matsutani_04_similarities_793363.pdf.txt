Abstract
Background: In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) transcribes the genes for small RNAs
like tRNAs, 5S rRNA, and several viral RNAs, and short interspersed repetitive elements (SINEs).
The genes for these RNAs and SINEs have internal promoters that consist of two regions. These
two regions are called the A and B blocks. The multisubunit transcription factor TFIIIC is required
for transcription initiation of RNAP III; in transcription of tRNAs, the B-block binding subunit of
TFIIIC recognizes a promoter. Although internal promoter sequences are conserved in eukaryotes,
no evidence of homology between the B-block binding subunits of vertebrates and yeasts has been
reported previously.
Results: Here, I reported the results of PSI-BLAST searches using the B-block binding subunits of
human and Shizosacchromyces pombe as queries, showing that the same Arabidopsis proteins were
hit with low E-values in both searches. Comparison of the convergent iterative alignments obtained
by these PSI-BLAST searches revealed that the vertebrate, yeast, and Arabidopsis proteins have
similarities in their N-terminal one-third regions. In these regions, there were three domains with
conserved sequence similarities, one located in the N-terminal end region. The N-terminal end
region of the B-block binding subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is tentatively identified as a HMG
box, which is the DNA binding motif. Although I compared the alignment of the N-terminal end
regions of the B-block binding subunits, and their homologs, with that of the HMG boxes, it is not
clear whether they are related.
Conclusion: Molecular phylogenetic analyses using the small subunit rRNA and ubiquitous
proteins like actin and α-tubulin, show that fungi are more closely related to animals than either is
to plants. Interestingly, the results obtained in this study show that, with respect to the B-block
binding subunits of TFIIICs, animals appear to be evolutionarily closer to plants than to fungi.

Background
Phylogenetic relationships among animals, fungi, and
plants have been a controversial issue. Although fungi traditionally had been considered more closely related to
plants than to animals, Whittaker and Margulis [1] classified the fungi as a separate kingdom in their five-kingdom

classification: the three major multicellular groups of animals, fungi, and green plants were each given the status of
kingdoms derived from different protistan lineages of
uncertain affinities. With the determination of the primary structures of homologous macromolecules in various organisms, spanning several kingdoms, molecular

phylogenetic techniques resulted in new hypotheses
about the relationships among eukaryotes. Small subunit
rRNA, and the proteins like actin and α-tubulin, exist
ubiquitously and their primary structures are highly conserved. Thus, these sequences have been used to make
molecular trees [for examples, [2,3]]. Most of these studies
place fungi as more closely related to animals than either
is to plants [3-6].
Eukaryotic RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) transcribes a
variety of small RNAs like tRNAs, 5S rRNA, and several
viral RNAs [7]. Short interspersed repetitive elements
(SINEs) are also transcribed by RNAP III [8]. Genes for
these small RNAs have internal promoters that consist of
two regions called the A and B blocks [9]. These promoter
sequences are well-conserved in diverse eukaryotes [9].
Transcription by RNAP III requires the multisubunit transcription factor TFIIIC, which plays an important role in
transcription initiation [10]. TFIIIC contains a B-block
binding subunit, which recognizes the RNAP III promoter
in the transcription of tRNAs and several viral RNAs, orienting its associated subunits along the DNA [11]. TFIIIC
that is oriented toward the start site, promotes TFIIIB
binding and assists in directing accurate initiation by
RNAP III [12,13].
In TFIIIC of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a subunit of 138 kDa
binds to a B-block, and its gene which is called TFC3, has
been cloned [14]. The open reading frame for the B-block
binding subunit is interrupted by one intron [14]. TFC3 is
a single-copy gene and essential for cell viability [14]. In
human and rat, the B-block binding subunits of TFIIICs
are 243 kDa and 220 kDa respectively [14,15], and there
is great similarity between them at the amino acid
sequence level [15]. However, B-block binding subunit
from mammals has been thought to show no homology
to the S. cerevisiae 138 kDa subunit, although all of them
bind to similar DNA regions, suggesting a significant
degree of evolutionary divergence for RNAP III factors
[15,16]. Huang et al. [17] identified several subunits of S.
pombe TFIIIC from the S. pombe sequence database by
homology searches using the S. cerevisiae TFIIIC subunits
as queries; one of these subunits named Sfc3p, is similar
to the S. cerevisiae B-block binding subunit. It has been
thought that, like the B-block binding subunit from S. cerevisiae, Sfc3p does not share homology with the human Bblock binding subunit. On the other hand, Sfc1p, Sfc4p,
and Sfc6p, which are other subunits of S. pombe TFIIIC,
show homologies not only to S. cerevisiae TFIIIC subunits
but also to human TFIIIC subunits [17]. It has been
shown that Sfc1p, Sfc3p, Sfc4p, and Sfc6p are associated
in vivo, and the isolated Sfc3p complex is active in the in
vitro RNAP III-mediated transcription of S. pombe tRNA
genes [17].

The lack of clear homology between the yeast and human
B-block binding subunits is strange, because transcription
of tRNA genes by RNAP III is initiated by the binding of
these subunits to the B-block regions, and the internal
promoter sequences are highly conserved between vertebrates and yeasts (see above). Interestingly, bacterial tRNA
genes also have conserved RNAP III promoters (Fig. 1)
[18]. Although these genes are transcribed from the
upstream promoters by the bacterial RNA polymerase,
RNAP III can transcribe some of them in vitro [18]. Thus,
understanding the relationship of the B-block binding
subunits from human and yeast TFIIICs is important for
understanding the evolution of the RNAP III transcription
machinery. Here, I demonstrate that, at the amino acid
sequence level, the B-block binding subunits of the vertebrate and yeast TFIIICs do have important homologies.
These homologies are found by comparing the B-block
binding subunits with Arabidopsis proteins, which appear
to be the homologs of both the human and yeast
subunits.

Results
PSI-BLAST search using the human B-block binding subunit
as a query
When the B-block binding subunits of human and S. cerevisiae are aligned using the early Clustal program, they
show little sequence similarity [16]. To search for potentially homologous B-block binding regions, first I carried
out a PSI-BLAST search where the human subunit was
used as a query. PSI-BLAST is known to be useful in finding distantly related proteins [19]. After three iterations,
twelve sequences were found with strong similarities to
the sequence of human B-block binding subunit. Fig. 2A
shows a summary of the result of a PSI-BLAST search,
including proteins with alignment scores better than 200.
Proteins that showed only local alignment similarities
(shorter than about 300 amino acids) were omitted. The
human B-block binding subunit was very similar to the rat
subunit (75% identity and 84 % positive) as reported by
Lagna et al. [15] (Fig. 2A). The nuclear protein of 238 kDa
in the mosquito Chironomus tentans (GenBank identification number: 18073910) is structurally similar to the
human B-block binding subunit [20]; in BLAST and
FASTA searches of non-redundant databases using C. tentans protein as a query, the best hits were the human and
rat B-block binding subunits with 28 % identities. A comparable level of similarity has been found also in the Drosophila hypothetical protein, but no other related proteins
were identified in the database [20]. Immunoelectron
microscopy shows that this mosquito protein is located at
sites of transcription, suggesting the role of the protein in
transcription initiation [20]. In this study, when a PSIBLAST search was performed using the human sequence
as a query, the Chironomus and Drosophila proteins were
hit (23 % and 20 % identities respectively) (Fig. 2A). In

Sequences of the internal promoters for RNA polymerase III. In the sequences of the Xenopus tRNAMet gene [37], the
Xenopus 5S rRNA gene [38], adenovirus VAI [39], human Alu [40], and the E. coli tRNAAsp gene [18], the nucleotides identical
to those in the consensus sequence [9] are shown by capital letters.

addition to these, hypothetical proteins from the mosquito Anopheles gambiae (GI 31212899), Mus musculus
(GIs 38087408, and 21595152), Caenorhabditis briggsae
(GI 39594187), and Arabidopsis thaliana (GIs 25402830,
9665127, 15218016, 25404859, and 30685327), were
also hit with low E-values: E-values were 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, e-169,
e-167, e-148, and 5e-87, respectively (Fig. 2A). Interestingly,
in Arabidopsis proteins of GIs 25402830, 9665127, and
15218016, both the N- and C-terminal end regions corresponded to those of the human subunit, suggesting that
these Arabidopsis proteins are orthologs of the B-block
binding subunits (Fig. 2A).
PSI-BLAST using the yeast B-block binding subunits as
queries
The S. cerevisiae B-block binding subunit exhibits 21 %
identity and 39 % similarity to the S. pombe Sfc3p protein,
and these similarities extend to the overall sequences
(Background; [17]). When I performed a PSI-BLAST

search using the S. cerevisiae B-block binding subunit as a
query, five sequences were hit with E-values better than
threshold after three iterations: the Neurospora crassa
hypothetical protein (GI 32412546) with 0.0, S. pombe
Sfc3p with e-159, the Magnaporthe grisea hypothetical protein (GI 38108450) with e-121, the Saccharomyces bayanus
hypothetical protein fragment (GI 10863079) with e-100,
and the Arabidopsis hypothetical protein (GI 15218016)
with 0.002 (data not shown). It is noteworthy that the
Arabidopsis protein of GI 15218016 was hit although the
E-value was not so good. This protein was hit also in the
PSI-BLAST search using the human B-block binding subunit as a query (Fig. 2A).
Next, I performed a PSI-BLAST search using the S. pombe
Sfc3p protein as a query. Fig. 2B is a summary of the result.
The Magnaporthe grisea and Neurospora crassa hypothetical
proteins (GI 38108450 and GI 32412546), were hit with
very good E-values (0 and e-168 respectively) (Fig. 2B). The

Proteins
Proteins which show homologies to the B-block binding subunits of human and S. pombe, and the Arabidopsis
protein GI 25402830. A. The result of a PSI-BLAST search using the human subunit (GI 4753161) as a query. B. The result
of a PSI-BLAST search using the S. pombe subunit (GI 19112919) as a query. C. The result of a PSI-BLAST search using the Arabidopsis protein (GI 25402830) as a query. In A-C, only the proteins that had bit scores more than 200 are shown. Bold horizontal lines (black, dark gray, and pale gray lines) are the regions that appeared as convergent iterative alignments. The
numbers above the lines are the amino acid positions in the query sequence, and those beneath the lines are the amino acid
positions in the hit sequences. When more than two regions were hit in the same sequence, the highest bit score and E-value
are shown. Black lines are the alignments that had the best bit scores and E-values. Gray-colored alignments had the worse
scores. Dark gray lines represent the alignments with the bit scores more than 200, and the scores of the pale grey alignments
are lower than 200. The proteins that had similarities only in short regions (smaller than about 300 amino acids) were omitted,
even if the bit scores were more than 200. The case of the Ustilago sequence is exceptional. This result was from the PSIBLAST which was limited a search of the fungi database. The bold horizontal lines are the regions that appeared as convergent
iterative alignments, and below them E-values are shown.

Aspergillus nidulans protein GI 49107000 also was hit with
a robust E-value (data not shown). Four hypothetical
proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana were hit with E-values
worse than those of the two fungi proteins but well above
the threshold: GI 15218016 with e-113, GI 25402830 with
e-88, GI 9665127 with 2e-88, and GI 25404859 with 7e-70
(Fig. 2B). The Arabidopsis protein GI 15218016 was found
also in the result of the PSI-BLAST search using the S. cerevisiae subunit as a query, but in the search with S. pombe
Sfc3p it had a much better E-value. Surprisingly, these four
Arabidopsis proteins were identical to the proteins that
were hit with low E-values in the PSI-BLAST search using
the human B-block binding subunit as a query (Fig. 2A).
While both the N-terminal half regions and C- terminal
end regions were similar between the Arabidopsis proteins
and the human subunit, their similarities to S. pombe
Sfc3p were only in the N-terminal halves (Figs. 2A and
2B). The B-block binding subunits of rat and human also
were hit in this search, but with E-values of 5e-5 and 0.20,
respectively (data not shown); the N-terminal 350 amino
acid sequences of the rat and human subunits showed
similarities to the N-terminal region of S. pombe Sfc3p
protein.
PSI-BLAST using the B-block binding subunit homolog
found in Arabidopsis as a query
The four Arabidopsis proteins (GIs 25402830, 9665127,
15218016, and 25404859), were hit with low E-values in
both of the PSI-BLAST searches using the human and S.
pombe subunits as queries. Thus, I performed a PSI-BLAST
search using one of these Arabidopsis proteins (GI
25402830) as a query. Fig. 2C shows a summary of the
result. Six hypothetical Arabidopsis proteins were hit with
E-values of 0, and three of them were identical to the proteins which were hit in the PSI-BLAST searches using the
human and S. pombe subunits as queries. In addition to
these, the human and rat subunits were hit with low E-values (e-132 and e-108 respectively). The N-terminal 700
amino acids of the human and rat subunits were most
similar to the Arabidopsis proteins, but the short regions of
the C-terminal ends also were similar (Fig. 2C). The hypothetical mouse protein (GI 38087408) which was hit in
the PSI-BLAST search using the human subunit as a query,
also was hit in the PSI-BLAST search with Arabidopsis GI
25402830 (Fig. 2C). The B-block binding subunits of S.
pombe and S. cerevisiae were hit with E-values worse than
threshold (0.024 and 1.1 respectively) (data not shown).
However, it should be noted that these Arabidopsis proteins were hit with E-values better than threshold when a
PSI-BLAST search was performed using the S. pombe Bblock binding protein as a query.

It is interesting that the four Arabidopsis proteins were similar to the B-block binding subunits of vertebrates and
yeasts, despite the fact that vertebrate and yeast subunits

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/26

share no recognizable homology [15-17]. These results
seemed to imply that the Arabidopsis proteins of GIs
25402830, 9665127, 15218016, and 25404859 represent
a 'missing link' between the vertebrate and yeast B-block
binding subunits.
Alignment of the B-block binding subunits and their
homologs
When the primary structures of human and rat B-block
binding subunits and their homolog in Drosophila are
compared, the most conserved sequences are located
within the N-terminal two-thirds of the proteins, while
the C-terminal one-third is much less conserved [20]. The
Chironomus tentans protein, which probably binds to the
B-block in the RNAP III promoter, also has similarities to
the human, rat, and Drosophila proteins in the N-terminal
region [20]. The results of PSI-BLAST searches here also
showed that conserved sequences in the human subunit,
and the three Arabidopsis homologs (GIs 25402830,
9665127, and 15218016), mainly are located in the N-terminal halves of the proteins (Fig. 2A). Similarly,
conserved sequences in the S. pombe subunit and the three
Arabidopsis homologs (GIs 25402830, 9665127, and
15218016), are located in the N-terminal one-third
regions of the proteins (Fig. 2C). Thus, I used the Clustal
W program [21] to align the N-terminal one-third regions
of the proteins of human, rat, mouse, Drosophila, Chironomus, Arabidopsis, and yeasts. The Clustal W alignment
of the N-terminal ends of about 60 amino acids corresponded to each of the alignments obtained by the PSIBLAST searches between the query and hit sequences (Fig.
3A). However, the rest of the Clustal W alignment did not
correspond to the alignments obtained by PSI-BLAST
(data not shown). Therefore, I compared all of the PSIBLAST alignments further by eye. Three regions including
the N-terminal ends were found to be most conserved
between the PSI-BLAST alignments; these three regions
were aligned separately by Clustal W (Fig. 3). Previously,
Rozenfeld and Thuriaux [22] performed PSI-BLAST using
the S. cerevisiae B-block binding subunit as a query. They
identified two domains of about 70 amino acids, which
were conserved in S. cerevisiae subunit and Arabidopsis
thaliana protein of 1808 amino acids [22]: amino acid
(aa) positions 333–361 of the S. cerevisiae subunit correspond to positions 334–362 of the A. thaliana protein,
and positions 1079–1111 in S. cerevisiae correspond to
positions 1716–1748 in A. thaliana. These local homologies are detected also in the human B-block binding subunit by visual inspection (aa positions 367–397 and
1987–2019) (Fig. 2 in [22]). The Arabidopsis protein
reported in Rozenfeld and Thuriaux [22] appears to be the
GI 9665127 protein hit in the PSI-BLAST searches here,
because the lengths of their amino acid sequences are the
same and the partial sequences shown in their paper are
identical to those in the GI 9665127 protein. The

cases of the Clamydomonas sequences are exceptional. These sequences were hit by tblastn of the C. reinhardtii genome

this study.

When a PSI-BLAST search was performed using the
human B-block binding subunit as a query, it was shown
that the C-terminal region also is conserved (Fig. 2A); for
examples, Chironomus, Anopheres, Drosophila, and Arabi-

dopsis (GIs, 25402830, 9665127, and 15218016) proteins
are hit with E-values of e-29, 3e-7, 6e-54, 2e-20, 2e-39, and 2e21 respectively (data not shown). These regions contain
the domains shown to have sequence similarities [22]
(see above). When a PSI-BLAST search was performed
using the S. pombe B-block binding subunit as a query,
alignments consisting of its C-terminal region and each of
the Magnaporthe, Neurospora, and S. cerevisiae sequences
were generated, but no homology to the C-terminal
regions of the Arabidopsis proteins was suggested (Fig. 2B).
However, in agreement with the result of Rozenfeld and
Thuriaux [22], when the S. cerevisiae B-block binding subunit was used as a query, the C-terminal region of the Arabidopsis protein (GI 9665127) was hit after four iterations;
aa positions 1032–1146 of the S. cerevisiae subunit
aligned to positions 1673–1774 of the Arabidopsis protein
(GI 9665127) with an E-value of 5e-21 (data not shown).
Consequently, the C-terminal sequences of the human,
rat, mosquitoes, Drosophila, Arabidopsis and fungi proteins, can be aligned by Clustal W (Fig. 3D).
Are the HMG boxes in the B-block binding proteins?
The aa positions 1–68 and 1037–1110 of the S. cerevisiae
B-block binding subunit had been tentatively identified as
HMG boxes [14]. The HMG box is a small eukaryotic DNA
binding motif (70–80 amino acids in size) found in many
proteins including transcription factors [23]. Interestingly, the regions of HMG boxes predicted for the S. cerevisiae subunit overlap the N- and C-terminal regions
conserved in many B-block binding proteins. Therefore, I
investigated whether these conserved regions could be
homologs of HMG boxes. HMG boxes are diverse, and it
is sometimes difficult to determine whether a given protein belongs to the HMG box superfamily [24]. However,
in alignments of known HMG boxes a loose consensus
sequence can be defined, in which many basic and aromatic residues are conserved [24-26] (see also Fig. 4B).
Structures of several HMG boxes have been determined by
the NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction [for examples, [25,27,28]] (Fig. 4B); most of them have three α-helices arranged in L-shapes, and tertiary structures stabilized
by conserved aromatic residues. It should be noted that in
alignments of the N- and C-terminal end regions of Bblock binding proteins, several basic and aromatic residues also are conserved (Figs. 3A and 3D). Since HMG
boxes contain three helices (see above), I predicted the
secondary structures of N- and C-terminal regions of Bblock binding proteins using the PSIPRED method [29].
The results are shown in Figs. 4A and 4C. In the N-terminal end regions, all of the sequences (except for Drosophila) were predicted to contain three α-helices with
corresponding locations (Fig. 4A). Although the Drosophila N-terminal sequence was predicted to have only
two helices, their locations corresponded to the middle
and posterior helices in the other sequences (Fig. 4A). In

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/26

the C-terminal end regions, all of the sequences were predicted to contain one helix in the same corresponding
location (Fig. 4C). Fig. 4 shows alignments of B-block
binding protein sequences and HMG boxes, arranged to
show relationships between them. Numerous gaps were
inserted into the sequences by visual inspection in order
to relate the positions of basic and aromatic residues and
locations of the α-helices (Fig. 4). It appears possible that
HMG boxes are present in B-block binding proteins, particularly in their N-terminal regions, however, strong evidence for this relationship is not clear from comparing
their amino acid sequences.
Evolutionary relationships of the B-block binding proteins
PSI-BLAST searches presented here provide the evidence
that the B-block binding subunits of vertebrates and yeasts
are homologous, and that the Arabidopsis proteins can be
used to link these subunits. These results suggest that,
with respect to the B-block binding subunits of TFIIICs,
animals are evolutionarily closer to Arabidopsis than to
yeasts. These results are intriguing because phylogenetic
analyses using sequences of small subunit rRNA, elongation factor 1, actin, α-tublin, β-tubulin, and heat shock
protein 70, show that animals and fungi are most closely
related, to the exclusion of the broad diversity of
eukaryotic phyla including plants [3-6]. To confirm that
the B-block binding subunits of animals and plants are
closely related, I decided to carry out an extensive comparison of the sequences from additional plant taxa. However, the PSI-BLAST searches using the B-block binding
subunits of human and S. pombe, and Arabidopsis homolog
(GI 25402830) as queries, did not significantly hit any of
the plant sequences except the Arabidopsis proteins shown
in this study. Therefore, I performed a tblastn search of the
Viridiplantae database using the Arabidopsis protein GI
25402830 as a query. The Oryza sativa sequence GI
37990182 was hit with the best E-value (8e-85) among
Viridiplantae sequences, except the Arabidopsis genes
already described (Fig. 5A). In this Oryza sequence, there
are four regions that show high similarities to the query
Arabidopsis protein (Fig. 5A). This result suggests that the
Oryza sequence GI 37990182 encodes a B-block binding
protein. Subsequently, I performed the PSI-BLAST
searches using three conserved domains from the Oryza
sequence of GI 37990182 (Fig. 5B). The query sequence
from the 5' end of the Oryza gene had greater similarities
to the B-block binding proteins in animals than those in
fungi: for examples, the human and rat subunits were hit
with E-values of e-26 and 7e-26 respectively, while the S.
pombe subunit was hit with an E-value of 0.005, and other
fungal sequences were not hit with E-values better than 10
(Fig. 5B). The results for the query sequence from 3' region
of the Oryza gene also indicate that the animal and plant
proteins are more closely related: for examples, the
human and rat subunits were hit with E-values of 0.009

and 0.12 respectively, while the yeast subunits were not
hit with E-values better than 10 (Fig. 5B). The result for
the query sequence from the middle region of the Oryza
gene, however, did not retrieve animal subunits, although
the S. cerevisiae subunit was hit with an E-value of 0.21
(Fig. 5B).
I also searched for a B-block binding protein homolog in
the genome of green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. I performed a tblastn search using the Arabidopsis protein GI
25402830 as a query and the C. reinhardtii genome
sequence ver2 in the Joint Genome Institute website (see
Methods). The Arabidopsis sequences at aa positions of
83–144, 234–262, 698–713, and 1812–1847 showed
similarities to sequences corresponding to bp positions of
539027-538842, 527862-537776, 534044-533997, and
526942-526835 in the C. reinhardtii scaffold 16, with Evalues of 9.7e-5, 80.2, 80.2, and 9.7e-5 respectively (Fig.
5C). The amino acid sequences deduced from bp positions 539027-538842 and 526942-526835 corresponded
to the domains conserved among the B-block binding
proteins that were aligned by Clustal W, as shown in Figs.
3B and 3D. These results suggest that the Chlamydomonas
B-block binding protein is encoded in these DNA regions.
Subsequently, I performed PSI-BLAST searches using the
two amino acid sequences of C. reinhardtii with the highest similarities to the Arabidopsis protein (Fig. 5D). The
query sequence from bp positions 539231-538197 in C.
reinhardtii, showed similarities to the rat B-block binding
subunit and its homolog in mouse (E-values of 7.1 and
5.8 respectively) (Fig. 5D). Although these E-values are
not robust, no fungal B-block binding proteins was hit
with E-values better than 10. The other query sequence
encoded in bp positions 527524-526466 of C. reinhardtii
also had greater similarities to the B-block binding proteins in animals than to those in fungi: for examples, the
human and rat subunits were hit with E-values of 4e-68
and 2e-56 respectively, while no fungal proteins were hit
with E-values better than 10 (Fig. 5D). The results of these
PSI-BLAST searches with Oryza and Chlamydomonas query
sequences indicate that the greater similarity in TFIIIC Bblock binding proteins between animals and plants, with
yeast as more distant, across the broad diversity of the animal and plant kingdoms.
Because yeasts may not be representative of all fungi, it is
important to demonstrate that the greater similarity
between the animal and plant B-block binding proteins
extends beyond the yeast taxa. To this end, I searched for
homologs of the B-block binding protein in the basidiomycete genomes. I performed a PSI-BLAST search using
the S. pombe subunit as a query, limiting the search to the
fungi database. The sequence hit with the best E-value
among the basidiomycete sequences, was the Ustilago
maydis protein GI 461005911 (Fig. 2B). The Cryptococcus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/26

and Coccidiodes sequences were not hit with E-values
better than 10. In the Ustilago sequence GI 461005911,
three regions show similarities to the S. pombe subunit,
particularly the N-terminal one-third and the C-terminal
regions as is true of other homologs in fungi (Fig. 2B).
Subsequently, a PSI-BLAST search was performed using
the human B-block binding subunit as a query of the
fungi database. Although the S. cerevisiae B-block binding
subunit was hit with an E-value of 5e-7, the Ustilago
sequence of GI 46100591 was not hit with an E-value better than 10 (data not shown). Moreover, a PSI-BLAST
search performed using the Arabidopsis homolog (GI
25402830) as a query of the fungi database also did not
hit the Ustilago sequence of GI 46100591 with an E-value
better than 10, although the S. cerevisiae and S. pombe Bblock binding subunits were hit with E-values of 0.93 and
9.7 respectively (data not shown). These results indicate
that animal and plant B-block binding subunits are more
similar to the yeast subunits than to the Ustilago protein
GI 46100591. The overall results in this section demonstrate that the greater similarity between the plant and animal B-block binding proteins extends to the green alga
protein, and the greater differences in fungi go beyond the
yeast taxa.

Discussion
In this study, I have demonstrated that the B-block binding subunits of TFIIICs in vertebrates are apparently
homologous to those of yeasts, by identifying the
homologs of each in Arabidopsis. The Arabidopsis proteins
(GIs 25402830, 9665127, 15218016, and 25404859),
which show strong similarity to B-block binding subunits,
are the hypothetical proteins translated conceptually from
the nucleotide sequences of the chromosome I [[30]; see
also http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez]. The lengths of
the inferred amino acid sequences of three of these Arabidopsis proteins (GIs 25402830, 9665127, and 15218016),
are close to those of the amino acid sequences of the vertebrate subunits (Fig. 2). These Arabidopsis proteins probably function as the B-block binding subunits in vivo. Bblock binding subunits act on the RNAP III promoters, the
sequences of which are conserved in diverse eukaryotes
(Background; Fig. 1). Thus, the domains of the subunits
that bind to these promoters also should be conserved in
vertebrates and yeasts. The N-terminal one-third regions
of the human, yeast, and the Arabidopsis homologs found
in this study probably associate with the B-block
sequences. It is interesting that the HMG boxes predicted
in the S. cerevisiae B-block binding subunit [14] overlap
with the regions conserved in many of these putative Bblock binding subunits.
There is a striking degree of similarity in most of the RNAP
III transcription machinery in human, S. pombe, and S. cerevisiae; RNAP III, TFIIIA, TFIIIB, and the TFIIIC subunits

Page 10 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:26

that interact with the transcription initiation site, are
highly conserved in these three organisms [31]. On the
other hand, the TFIIIC subunits, which interact with
downstream promoter regions including the B-block
binding subunits, are more divergent [31]. There is the
possibility that substitution rates of the amino acid residues in the B-block binding subunits vary among animals,
fungi, and plants, resulting in the high divergence
between the human and fungi proteins, and the similarity
between the human and plant proteins. Alternatively, evolutionary inferences based on the RNAP III transcription
machinery may be different from those of the genes that
generally have been used to examine phylogenetic relationships in animals, fungi, and plants. RNAP III transcribes genes encoding tRNA, 5S rRNA, and several viral
RNAs, and SINEs (Background). It was reported that
molecular phylogenies based on tRNA sequences place
plants as the sister group to the animals, although the
tRNA data set available at the time was small [32]. Generally, it is thought that 5S rRNA is convenient for intrakingdom phylogenies, but cannot resolve the question of the
animal-plant-fungal divergence because of its short length
and high divergence [32,33]. It should be noted that more
recent investigations of the proteins involved in RNA
metabolism, the mRNA capping apparatus, and several
key components that regulate the cell cycle, also suggest a
close relationship between animals and plants, with fungi
as more distant [34-36].

Conclusions
Previously, no evidence of homology between the B-block
binding subunits of TFIIICs of vertebrates and yeasts has
been reported. PSI-BLAST searches presented here provided the evidence that these subunits are homologous,
and that the Arabidopsis proteins can be used to link them.
These results imply that, with respect to the B-block binding subunits, animals are evolutionarily closer to Arabidopsis than to yeasts. Comparisons of the B-block binding
proteins from additional plant taxa showed that the
greater similarity between plants and animals extends to
the green algae Chlamydomonas. It was also demonstrated
that the differences in fungi go beyond the yeast texa, and
occur in basidiomycetes. These are interesting because
molecular phylogenetic analyses using the small subunit
rRNA and ubiquitous proteins, show that fungi are more
closely related to animals than either is to plants.

Methods
To search for similarities between the B-block binding
subunits of vertebrates and yeasts, I used the PSI-BLAST
program
in
the
NCBI
website
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/[19]. PSI-BLAST searches
were performed by default: matrix was BLOSUM62; gap
costs were Existence 11 and Extension 1; and the E-value
of threshold was 0.005. Peptide sequence databases used

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/26

for the PSI-BLAST searches were all non-redundant GenBank CDS translations, RefSeq proteins, PDB, SwissProt,
PIR, and PRF (total 1605642 sequences). The PSI-BLAST
was limited searches of the eukaryota databases, when the
amino acid sequences from the Oryza and Chlamydomonas
coding regions were used as queries. The fungi database
was used in a search for homologs of the S. pombe B-block
binding subunit in basidiomycetes. PSI-BLAST was run
three times for each of the queries. To search for homologs
of the Arabidopsis protein GI25402830 in the plant
sequences, the tblastn program was used http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/[19]. To search for
homologs of the Arabidopsis protein GI25402830 in the
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii sequences, the tblastn program
at the Joint Genome Institute website http://genome.jgipsf.org/cgi-bin/runBlast.pl?db=chlre2, was used. Clustal
W in the EMBL-EBI website http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clus
talw/ was used to align the multiple amino acid sequences
[21]. Clustal W was performed by default: matrix was
Gonnet 250; the penalty for opening a gap was 10; the
penalty for extending a gap was 0.05; and gap separation
penalty was 8. Secondary structures of the proteins were
predicted by using the PSIPRED protein structure prediction server (PSIPRED v2.4 in http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/
psipred/) [29].
