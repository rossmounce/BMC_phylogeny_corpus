Abstract

Background

While the amount and quality of publicly available sequence
data is improving, a second complete Anopheles gene build in
October of 2003 by Ensembl was able to utilize only 40,000
expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences in the EST gene
build, leaving gene predictions heavily reliant on finding
regions homologous with Drosophila, an organism that
diverged from Anopheles more than 250 million years ago [35]. A recent preliminary analysis of the Anopheles genome

information

Annotation of the A. gambiae genome by defining genes and
other genomic features is the first step in moving from the
realm of simply a genome sequence to one of understanding

gene function. Extremely important to this effort is the accumulation of high-quality sequence data capable of refining
the structural features of known genes and revealing previously unknown genes. Unfortunately, before the completion
of the genome sequence, very few Anopheles genes were well
characterized experimentally, with exceptions primarily
being genes involved either in olfaction or in host-parasite
interactions (for example, innate immunity genes).

interactions

Malaria is currently considered to be the most important
tropical disease, afflicting 300-500 million people, and killing
over 1 million annually [1]. It is caused by infection of the
human host with a single-celled parasite belonging to the
genus Plasmodium and relies on female mosquitoes of the
genus Anopheles for its transmission. The recent wholegenome sequencing of Anopheles gambiae, the primary vector in sub-Saharan Africa of Plasmodium falciparum - the
agent of the most common and deadly type of malaria - now
provides researchers with a vast set of data with which to better understand this insect vector and to develop possible solutions to malaria [2].

refereed research

We describe the preliminary analysis of over 35,000 clones from a full-length enriched cDNA
library from the malaria mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae. The clones define nearly 3,700 genes,
of which around 2,600 significantly improve current gene definitions. An additional 17% of the genes
were not previously annotated, suggesting that an equal percentage may be missing from the
current Anopheles genome annotation.

annotation suggests that this lack of sequence data, combined
with potential assembly problems and the absence of a closely
related organism to use in homology comparisons, is proving
a significant challenge for current attempts at genome annotation [6]. Like other groups [7,8], we have initiated a program to increase the total amount of experimental sequence
data and improve current Anopheles gene models. Unlike
EST data, full-length cDNA libraries are biased toward complete copies of mRNA transcripts and thus provide significantly more information, including intron-exon structure as
well as the first and last exons (often the most difficult to
identify in silico [9]), alternative splicing, the correct start
codon(s), and the full protein-coding sequence. Additionally,
full-length transcripts can be used in the optimization of
gene-expression studies and can be used directly as templates
for protein synthesis.
Here we report the sequencing and preliminary analysis of
67,044 reads from a full-length enriched cDNA library
derived from whole-body adult female A. gambiae mosquitoes. These sequences were initially clustered with each other
and then aligned to the Anopheles genome sequence, and correspond to approximately 3,700 genes. Nearly 650 of these
genes appear to be novel because they neither overlap nor
simply extend previous Ensembl gene models. In addition,
clusters that matched previous gene definitions improved
those definitions in 85% of cases. These results demonstrate
both the usefulness of full-length cDNAs in genome annotation, as well as the degree to which further annotation of the
Anopheles genome is needed.
All sequences from this project were submitted to GenBank
under the accession numbers BX005485-BX072528 and the
physical clones are being submitted to the Malaria Research
and Reference Center (MR4) [10].

been assigned to a particular chromosomal location.

Comparison with previously predicted genes

Results and discussion

We constructed a non-normalized library of enriched fulllength cDNAs with RNA extracted from the complete body of
adult female mosquitoes (see Materials and methods).
Sequencing of clones was carried out from both the 5' and 3'
ends of the cDNA insert. After sequencing, sequence reads
were cleaned, clustered and assembled into consensus
sequences using the Paracel Transcript Assembler package.
Output from this process results in the creation of either a single consensus sequence or multiple consensus sequences
(because of alternative splicing, for example) for each cluster
of overlapping cDNAs. Individual reads that could not be initially clustered with any other sequence are referred to as singlets. Together, consensus and singlet sequences were
aligned to the genome, and for each strand, overlapping
cDNA sequences were grouped into a single cluster representing a putative gene. This process generates three major end
products: clusters and singlets that overlap previously predicted gene models; novel clusters or singlets that do not

To discern clusters representing known genes from those that
would potentially be considered novel, we compared the coordinates on the genome of our cDNA clusters to those of
Ensembl transcript models. Specifically, we used transcript
model data taken from Ensembl gene build version 16.2.1,
which did not have our cDNAs available for the creation of its
14,653 gene models. In this analysis, clusters were categorized as previously predicted if any overlap occurs, by even a
single base, between a cluster and an Ensembl transcript. If
no overlap occurs, genes were considered to be novel. Note
that, as described in [11], Ensembl transcript models were
generated from a combination of previously described
Anopheles protein sequences, high homology matches from
SwissProt+TrEMBL and Anopheles EST information. In our
analysis, we do not consider transcript models generated only
from in silico gene-prediction algorithms. In summary, when
we find a cluster that does not overlap any predicted Ensembl
transcript, the cluster is considered the product of a new gene
and is designated as being 'novel'. If a cluster does overlap an

information

We note that 2205 sequences (around 3% of all reads) cannot
be aligned to the genome. Essentially all of these sequences
are singlets, many of which are of low complexity and/or contain repetitive regions. Nearly half (1,066) were eliminated
during the alignment process due to their poor quality (identity and/or coverage). It is possible, however, that some unaligned sequences represent genes lying within sequence gaps
of the genome assembly. For example, within the unalignable
group there are eight clusters having an average length of
1250 nucleotides, composed of from two to four reads, with
three of these clusters consisting of overlapping 5' and 3'
reads. Visual inspection suggests that most of these clusters
also contain low-complexity regions. In addition, in two cases

interactions

While consistent, this method does require that some qualifying conditions be kept in mind. First, it is possible that a gene
that we designate as novel does in fact have some previous
transcript information available as supporting evidence (such
as EST data). This will happen, for example, if during the
process of automatic annotation the existing information did
not result in the creation of a new transcript model by
Ensembl. In fact, in the initial analysis of the Anopheles
genome, as many as 1,029 genes were believed to have been
missed in this manner [2]. Since the initial annotation process, the increased amount of available sequence information
has improved coverage considerably. Despite these improvements, however, such misclassifications are unavoidable. In
addition, if an Ensembl prediction is incorrect, an overlapping cluster would be classified as previously predicted,
although it would, in fact, be new to the annotation. Inspection shows that such instances are rare and generally require
additional experimental evidence as well as the manual definition of gene models for complete reconciliation of the data.
While difficulties will exist with any such automated comparison, as a whole our approach is consistent, reproducible, and

refereed research

Of the initial set of 10,961 singlets (see Figure 1), most
(around 80%) not only aligned to the genome with high quality, but also overlapped with Ensembl predictions, while
approximately 2,200 singlets were unable to be aligned. This
latter group is discussed further in the next section. Additionally, 202 reads or 'singlets' were found that accurately aligned
to the genome but did not overlap with any Ensembl transcript predictions. These singlets are generally shorter in
length than clusters, with a mean of 912 nucleotides. Of the
202 sequences, 65 were found through manual examination
to be probable 5' or 3' extensions of a nearby Ensembl-predicted transcript. Of the remaining 137 singlets, 38 (or 28%)
are non-overlapping 5- and 3-prime reads representing 19
genes where additional sequencing must be done to obtain
the complete gene sequence. Blastx analysis against a combined SwissProt+TrEMBL database showed that 25 of the
novel singlets (around 12%) have limited homology to previously described genes (E-value < 10-7), with the remaining
novel singlets having no significant similarity to the database
members. Thus singlets provide evidence for 118 additional
novel genes, and together with the previously described clusters, support the existence of 654 novel genes. While clusters
supported by a singlet provide further opportunities to investigate potentially novel genes, we do not describe them further here. Future work will investigate such transcripts in
greater detail.

deposited research

Using this approach we find that 3,032 clusters (86%) correspond to predicted Ensembl genes. Of these, nearly 46%
(1,393 sequences) extend both the 5' and 3' ends of Ensemblpredicted transcripts. In addition, 9% extend the 5' end only
(271 clusters) and 31% extend only the 3' end (935 clusters) of
the corresponding Ensembl transcript. Just 433 clusters
(around 14%) fell entirely within a predicted gene and did not
extend either extremity of an Ensembl gene model. In addition, 536 clusters that do not correspond to any previously
described Ensembl gene were also identified. The mean
length of these novel clusters was 1,303 nucleotides versus
1,615 for Ensembl-predicted genes. As detailed in Table 1,
both Ensembl-predicted and novel clusters appear to be well
distributed across the genome. As expected, the majority of
clusters are composed of a small number of reads - 37% of
clusters have two to three reads and 80% contain fewer than
12. The single cluster with the greatest number of reads (over
2,000) is annotated as a guanine-nucleotide-binding beta
subunit.

and do not include them in our group of novel genes.

ribosomal protein (S8; E-value ~10-12). Comparing the
remaining 1,139 reads that could not be initially aligned to
any chromosome arm via BLAST, we found that at least 808
reads appear to be bacterial contaminants. Approximately
19% have no similarity to proteins in SwissProt+TrEMBL.
Another 10% of the group (118 sequences) have similarity to
known proteins (E-value < 10-7). In fact, 32 sequences have
similarity to previously identified Anopheles proteins. At this
time, it is not clear whether these sequences fall into unse-

To characterize cDNA clusters in terms of their potential biological role, we compared both Ensembl-predicted as well as
novel gene clusters to a Gene Ontology (GO) annotated database (SwissProt+TrEMBL 796,016 sequences) [13,14]. Using
Blastx and an E-value of 10-7, clusters could be placed into a
range of biological processes and functions (Figure 2). For the
clusters supporting Ensembl-predicted genes, 2,398 of 3,032
(79%) could be assigned to a biological process or function, as
compared to the novel clusters where only 123 out of 536
(23%) had at least one qualifying match. Of the deduced proteins of clusters corresponding to predicted genes, approximately 63% could be classified as having catalytic, binding, or
nucleic-acid-binding function. Similarly, for deduced proteins of novel gene clusters, these same categories were the
most highly populated, representing nearly 80% of classified
functions. The processes of cell growth and/or maintenance
and protein metabolism and modification were the most
highly represented process categories for both Ensembl-predicted and novel cDNA clusters.
To better describe the novel genes defined by the cDNAs, we
compared consensus sequences from each cDNA cluster to a
SwissProt+TrEMBL database and found that approximately
35% (188) of novel clusters had significant hits to known proteins (E-value 10-7). Again, these clusters were represented by
a single consensus sequence composed of between two and 19
reads. For those transcripts without significant homology
results, it is likely that many represent species-specific and/or
insect-specific genes, and are thus of particular interest for
more detailed experimental study.
In addition, we attempted to identify a satisfactory open reading frame (ORF) in each cluster. Of the 536 novel clusters in
the final set, 298 contained an ORF of at least 100 amino
acids (see Materials and methods). Additional evidence in
support of the biological reality of a gene or gene transcript is
the existence of protein domains within the ORF as well as
multi-exonic structure. As shown in Table 2, we found 60
ORFs encoding at least one Pfam domain. Most domains are
found only once; the zinc finger C2H2 domain is found 18
times, however, distributed over five different proteins. Further evidence in support of these clusters being real biological
entities is the observation that nearly half of the clusters
(47%) are comprised of two or more exons.

test, we compared novel clusters to geneid [16] predictions
and found that 232 clusters (43%) overlap with a geneid prediction, while 311 novel clusters (57%) do not. In contrast,
only 9% of Ensembl-predicted genes do not have a corresponding geneid prediction. This result suggests that the
majority of novel genes would not be readily discovered without customized gene-finding methods. Currently, newer
gene-finding methods specifically trained on Anopheles
cDNAs are now being developed and implemented (see, for
example [17]) into the Ensembl gene prediction and annotation methodology (E. Mongin, personal communication).

GC content of cDNA clusters
It has been suggested that, at least in the case of human
genome annotation, there is a prediction bias against GC-rich
transcripts by current gene-prediction methods [15]. To
investigate the possibility that there are obvious biases in
sequence properties of novel clusters that would make them
more or less difficult to predict computationally, we determined the GC content for novel and predicted cDNA clusters
and compared them to all Ensembl-predicted genes. As
shown in Figure 3, the Ensembl transcript models are largely
contained between 35 and 70% GC content with a mean of
54%. The range of GC content for both novel and predicted
clusters spans a nearly equivalent range. For the novel clusters, however, there appears to be bias towards more AT-rich
transcripts. The mean GC content for novel clusters was 46%,
compared to 52% for clusters corresponding to predicted
genes. As a whole, the Anopheles genome has a GC content of
35.2% (Drosophila melanogaster is 41.1%) [2]. As a simple

As discussed earlier, genes represented by full-length cDNA
transcripts span a wide range of molecular and cellular roles.
Here we highlight a few examples and their relevance to current Anopheles research. Note that we have compared these
transcripts to a more recent version of the Ensembl database
(release 23) that now includes these cDNAs as part of the gene
build process. As a result, our cDNA transcripts are identified
in this section by their current ENSANGT, ENSANGEST, or
name identifier whenever appropriate. While some of the
genes described here had previous EST evidence, the availability of full-length enriched cDNAs for these transcripts is
particularly valuable for future annotation.
One transcript of interest encodes a protein containing both
CLIP and serine protease domains. This protein, which we
have designated here as Putative_CLIPA5B, has been incorporated
into
Ensembl
as
part
of
transcript
ENSANGT00000027174. In insects, these CLIP-domain serine proteases are involved in a variety of processes, including
embryonic development and the innate immune response.
For example, in response to malarial infection, CLIP-domain
proteases help to initiate the prophenoloxidase cascade
which, in 'malaria-resistant' mosquitoes, results in the generation of reactive oxygen species and the eventual
encapsulation of the parasite within a melanin capsule
[18,19]. Four subfamilies (A-D) are known within Anopheles,

Genome Biology 2005, 6:R39

and phylogenetic analysis of the novel protein sequence
deduced from our novel cluster suggests that it is a new member of the A subfamily (Figure 4a). Ten members of this family were previously described and CLIPA5 appears to be the
closest relative of the new protein. The gene for the new protein lies within a cluster of 15 serine protease/CLIP-domain
genes located on chromosome arm 3L (between 32.55-32.62
MB). Its similarity and proximity to clipA5 would suggest that
it arose from a recent duplication event. While the exact function of this new protein is unknown, it is interesting to note
that transcription of a related member in the same subfamily,
clipA6, is induced by bacterial infection [20].

[25,26]. While definitive proof of the involvement of P450 in
resistance is limited [27], it has been shown that certain P450
families are expressed at higher levels in various insecticideresistant strains (see, for example [28,29]). Of the two putative
P450
genes
discussed
here,
one
(ENSANGT00000029062) has high similarity (E = 10-146) to
CYP9L1 and the other has similarity to CYP6M4 (E = 10-149;
Ensembl known transcript AAP76391). Both families are
insect-specific, and members of the Cyp6 family have been
linked to insecticide resistance by elevated P450 activity in
insecticide-resistant insects [25]. In total, we retrieved
cDNAs representing 23 of the known 111 members of the
Anopheles P450 family.
We also find examples of interesting novel genes that are currently found only within this cDNA library. For example, our
cDNAs
identify
a
869-base-pair
(bp)
gene
(ENSANGT00000025538) which is most similar to mouse
and human members of the MAGE (melanoma antigenencoding) gene family. This gene was previously unrecognized in A. gambiae even though a Drosophila member of
this family does exist [30]. The gene was previously found to
be expressed specifically in mammalian tumors and is

example is a transcript of approximately 1,300 bp which is
homologous to Drosophila DIP2 (Disco interacting protein 2,
CG9771) which is involved in nervous system development
[31].

refereed research

We found that over 85% of previously predicted A. gambiae
genes had their boundaries extended either on the 5', 3', or
both 5' and 3' ends by our initial full-length cDNA collection.
While all the consensus models are not complete full-length
transcripts, it is particularly encouraging that such a large
percentage of previously predicted gene models were
extended on both their 5' and 3' ends. The use of such fulllength data is particularly valuable in the absence of well
annotated and evolutionarily close organisms which can be
used for sequence comparisons. The sequencing of the Aedes
aegypti genome is much anticipated in this regard. However,
even with the availability of a genome from a mosquito relative, species-specific genes, along with the variability inherent
in 5' and 3' exons, will probably require the use of full-length
data for accurate gene characterization.

deposited research

Other transcripts of interest are two previously non-predicted, putative P450 genes, which are of particular interest
with regard to insecticide resistance. Currently, the major
method for mosquito control within malaria endemic regions
is the use of pyrethroid-based insecticides, typically through
the impregnation of bednets and application to mosquito
breeding sites [24]. While a major tool in the fight against
malaria, the continued development of mosquito resistance
to these insecticides has become an important problem. One
potential mechanism of resistance to insecticides is the oxidative metabolism of insecticides mediated by cytochrome P450

We also identify a cDNA that encodes a peptidoglycan recognition protein (gene D of the long (L) subfamily - PGRPLD).
Members of this protein family play a key role in the response
to both bacterial and malarial infection [21]. While PGRPLD
was not predicted in the original Anopheles annotation and
was not part of the Ensembl 16 annotation, it was predicted
without cDNA evidence in the preliminary analysis of
immune genes within the genome [22] (Figure 5). In Drosophila, PGRPLD is enriched in hemocytes, is probably membrane bound and is actively expressed throughout
development. Although its exact role in innate immunity is
currently unknown, it is believed to be involved in bacterial
recognition [23]. As many as three different gene products
may be produced by pgprld in Drosophila, and our fulllength cDNAs suggest two alternative start sites for this gene
in Anopheles. Interestingly, as described in Drosophila, its
untranslated 3' end overlaps with an ORF on the opposite
strand encoding retinaldehyde-binding and alpha-tocopherol
transport domains [23]. The cDNAs for pgprld have been
incorporated into the supporting evidence for Ensembl EST

All libraries/clones are being deposited to MR4 and will be

Materials and methods
Sequences were cleaned, clustered and assembled using the
Paracel TranscriptAssembler software package (Paracel).
Cleaning consisted of comparing cDNA sequences against
vector and mitochondrial databases, with matching
sequences being removed from further analysis. In addition,
low-complexity, poly(A/T) regions, and repeat regions
(Ensembl repeat library courtesy of E. Mongin, Ensembl)
were determined and masked. After sequence cleaning,
masking and trimming, sequences with fewer than 200
unmasked bases were removed from further processing. As
an aid to the initial clustering process, we used Ensembl
release 16 cDNA transcripts as seed clusters. In this process,
each cDNA is compared to each Ensembl transcript, and if
significant similarity exists between the two, the cDNA is
placed into a corresponding seed bin and clustered with all
transcripts in this bin. Sequences that did not have high similarity to seed sequences were separately compared and clus-

The isolated total RNA was resuspended in H20 and the
poly(A)+ RNA fraction was obtained from the equivalent of
700 µg total RNA using the Qiagen Oligotex mRNA batch protocol. Oligo-capped libraries were then constructed from the
poly(A)+ RNA fraction as described by Sugano and collaborators [32,33]. Synthesis of the first-strand cDNA was obtained
with the SuperScriptII RNase H-Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen); subsequently, the template RNA strand was
degraded by alkaline hydrolysis and the first-strand cDNA
was amplified using the LA Taq polymerase (Takara). After

Note added in proof: A recent status report of the Anopheles
annotation effort by Ensembl agrees with our estimates suggesting that around 600 new genes were discovered from the
sequences presented in this communication, and that the current transcript set may be under-represented by as much as
20% [11].

20 PCR cycles the PCR fragments were digested with SfiI and
size-fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Two different size fractions (0.7-1 kilobase (kb), 1 kb-3 kb) were cloned
into the vector pME18S-FL3 in an orientation-defined manner, using a DNA ligation kit (Takara). Ligations were
electroporated into Escherichia coli DH10B electrocompetent bacteria (Invitrogen). Clones were randomly isolated and
subjected to high-throughput single-path sequencing from
their 5' and 3' ends. Note that this is a female whole-body
library created under the constraints of selection for fulllength transcripts within a given size range, and as such, does
not provide a comprehensive survey of the genes expressed or
capable of being expressed within the female Anopheles mosquito.

reports

A major result of this study was the finding that approximately 17% of the clusters represent previously unpredicted
genes. This is perhaps more significant when considering that
this was a non-normalized library constructed from whole
mosquitoes. Further extrapolation suggests that at least a
similar percentage of genes remains to be found elsewhere in
the Anopheles genome. Additional tissue- and treatment-specific libraries, currently under construction, should help to
characterize more undiscovered genes.

tered with each other. Next, both seed and non-seed clusters
were assembled into one or more consensus sequences. If a
sequence could not be assembled into the consensus
sequences it was designated as a singlet. Finally, each consensus and singlet sequence was aligned to the Ensembl Anopheles genome assembly (release 16.2.1) using a combination of
BLAST and Spidey [12,34] with minimum identity and coverage of 90% and 75% respectively. In addition, to prevent spurious 'exons' from being produced from low-quality sequence
noise common at read extremities, we trimmed terminal
exons separated by over 10 kb and which were less than 50
nucleotides long.
We compare the resulting clusters and singlets to Ensembl
transcripts (ENSANGT identifiers) from the Anopheles 16.2.1
release. Note that database revision numbers between 16.2.1
and 20 contain only one new gene build (ver. 17.2a.1 which
incorporates the cDNA sequence data presented in this
paper) with the rest primarily representing changes to the
underlying database schema. If a cluster did not overlap on
the genome with an Ensembl gene, it was classified as 'novel';
otherwise it was classified as 'Ensembl predicted'. The protein
database used for homology searches was a combined SwissProt (Release 44.2) and TrEMBL (Release 27.2) dataset.
Internally, we used the Genome Browser (Gbrowse) [35]
developed by the Generic Model Organism Database consortium [36] for display and analysis of clusters as well as the
public resources provided by Ensembl [3].

CLIPA phylogenetic tree
The regions containing the CLIP and serine protease domains
for each sequences were aligned with ClustalX [37] (default
values; version 1.83), manually adjusted in Jalview, and a
neighbor-joining tree created, excluding gaps, with PAUP*.
The CLIP and serine protease domains were included in the
alignment and large insertions were removed before aligning.

ORF determination
For each cluster considered, a representative cDNA sequence
was taken (the longest in terms of total concatenated exon
length if there were multiple consensus sequences in a cluster) and translated in all six reading frames. An ORF was
defined as being at least 100 codons long, starting with a
methionine and ending with a stop codon.
