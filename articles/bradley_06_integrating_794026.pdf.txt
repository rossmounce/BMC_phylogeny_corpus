Abstract
Background: When accurate models for the divergent evolution of protein sequences are
integrated with complementary biological information, such as folded protein structures, analyses
of the combined data often lead to new hypotheses about molecular physiology. This represents
an excellent example of how bioinformatics can be used to guide experimental research. However,
progress in this direction has been slowed by the lack of a publicly available resource suitable for
general use.
Results: The precomputed Magnum database offers a solution to this problem for ca. 1,800 fulllength protein families with at least one crystal structure. The Magnum deliverables include 1)
multiple sequence alignments, 2) mapping of alignment sites to crystal structure sites, 3)
phylogenetic trees, 4) inferred ancestral sequences at internal tree nodes, and 5) amino acid
replacements along tree branches. Comprehensive evaluations revealed that the automated
procedures used to construct Magnum produced accurate models of how proteins divergently
evolve, or genealogies, and correctly integrated these with the structural data. To demonstrate
Magnum's capabilities, we asked for amino acid replacements requiring three nucleotide
substitutions, located at internal protein structure sites, and occurring on short phylogenetic tree
branches. In the cellular retinoid binding protein family a site that potentially modulates ligand
binding affinity was discovered. Recruitment of cellular retinol binding protein to function as a lens
crystallin in the diurnal gecko afforded another opportunity to showcase the predictive value of a
browsable database containing branch replacement patterns integrated with protein structures.
Conclusion: We integrated two areas of protein science, evolution and structure, on a large scale
and created a precomputed database, known as Magnum, which is the first freely available resource
of its kind. Magnum provides evolutionary and structural bioinformatics resources that are useful
for identifying experimentally testable hypotheses about the molecular basis of protein behaviors
and functions, as illustrated with the examples from the cellular retinoid binding proteins.

Background
The amino acid sequences from a set of homologous proteins contain an imperfect record of the history of
sequence divergence within that protein family. Much of
this history can be modeled by a process that formally
reconstructs the sequences of ancestral proteins throughout an evolutionary tree, given a multiple sequence alignment relating individual sites in the descendent proteins
[1]. These reconstructions are generally presented in probabilistic form, where the likelihood that each of the standard amino acids occupied a particular site at a point in the
tree is represented by a vector whose coefficients sum to
unity, and where each coefficient represents the probability, conditional on the reconstruction model, that each of
the standard amino acids occupied that site at that point.
Reconstructed ancestral sequences can be viewed as an
expedient representation of extant sequence data, because
they include all of the sequence information in a way that
represents a best guess model for the historical reality. It is
not surprising, therefore, that explicitly considering reconstructed ancestral sequences is a powerful tool for interpreting sequence data. For example, explicit consideration
of ancestral states provided an understanding of the general features of correlated changes in proteins [2], an
understanding that eluded a perplexed literature that
attempted to analyze correlated change by leaf-leaf comparisons [3-6]. Likewise, many compelling tools for predicting the folded structure of proteins are based on
analyses that consider reconstructed ancestral sequences
[7,8]. Ancestral sequence reconstructions have provided
insight as well into the relation between protein sequence,
behavior, and adaptive function in proteins as diverse as
ribonucleotide reductase [9], leptin [10], aromatase [11],
sulfotransferase [12], steroid receptor [13], alcohol dehydrogenase [14], elongation factor [15], ribonuclease and
its homologs [16,17], rhodopsin [18], lysozyme [19], and
biofluorescent proteins [20]. In the last seven cases, ancestral proteins from extinct organisms were actually resurrected in the laboratory (reviewed in [21]).
As valuable as such studies are, however, only a very few
scientists pursue them. Two reasons explain, at least in
part, why studies involving reconstructed ancestral proteins are challenging. First, evolutionary analyses are
highly dependent on the availability of a large amount of
data collected by others. An evolutionary analysis of a protein family can generate interesting biological interpretations only if it contains a sizeable number of members,
and only if those sequences are contributed from interesting organisms. Further, the analysis depends on the extent
to which the sequences have diverged, and how the tree
interconnecting the sequences is articulated.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/89

Non-sequence information to support an evolutionary
analysis of sequence data is also usually available only
opportunistically. Thus, the availability of a crystal structure for a member of a protein family is generally not
determined by a desire to support an evolutionary analysis. Likewise, there is no guarantee that a fossil record will
exist for organisms holding ancestral proteins of interest,
or kinetic data will be collected on the interesting proteins
as biomolecules, or even that an interesting physiological
recruitment has been studied by cell or organismic biologists.
This contingency means that one rarely knows in advance
when one sets out to perform an evolutionary analysis
what will be discovered. Generally the most interesting
insights are true discoveries, coming opportunistically by
those who can resourcefully take advantage of all information, especially that from researchers who delivered it
to the literature for reasons quite different from the desire
to support an evolutionary analysis.
This places a high value on database architectures that
support browsing. The most useful database for an evolutionary bioinformaticist must allow the user to ask "What
if?" and "Why not?" questions about the evolutionary histories of multiple families, where the answers can be
extracted from the database in minutes or hours, not days
or weeks.
This generates the second reason why detailed evolutionary bioinformatic analyses are rarely done. The public
databases are inadequate for those who wish to browse,
especially if they hope to collect information about ancestral protein sequences. The decision to do an evolutionary
analysis with the NCBI web page is a decision to spend
weeks doing expert interpretation of BLAST outputs, multiple sequence alignments, and tree constructs. This
means that evolutionary analyses are today done one family at a time, by experts in evolutionary analysis, and are
not done by bench experimental scientists who have the
most access to the non-sequence information that
enriches a purely bioinformatics study.
A naturally organized commercial database incorporating
information from ancestral sequences, known as the MasterCatalog, was introduced in 2000 to support browsing
[22]. It has been remarkably successful doing so in the
hands of those who have had access to it [10-12,23,24].
The product falls between market niches, however; too
expensive to be available to academic scientists, yet generating too little revenue to attract major capital support.
Therefore, it has not permitted broad based discovery
using genomic sequence data. Some time ago, we set out
to develop a publicly available database that would support browsing of evolutionary and structural data jointly.

We report here a characterization of the Magnum database, which covers the multiple sequence alignments,
phylogenetic trees, inferred ancestral sequences, amino
acid residue replacements on branches, and crystal structures. We demonstrate the utility of Magnum as a research
tool for addressing general trends in protein evolution as
well as more specific questions of relevance to individual
protein families. In this case, we performed queries to
select individual amino acid replacements occurring
along short branches, located at internally folded protein
sites, and requiring a nucleotide change at each of the
three codon positions for interconversion. The results lead
us to, among others, the family of proteins that bind retinol and other hydrophobic ligands, where we discovered
along one branch a replacement that may explain physiological differences in ligand binding specificities, and
along another branch a set of replacements related to the
recruitment of this protein as an eye lens crystallin in diurnal geckos.

Description of magnum
In its current form, Magnum comprises 1,820 "Superfamilies" [25] from the Protein Information Resource
(PIR) containing from 4 to 191 family members.
Together, these contain a total of 85,386 protein
sequences (Figure 1A). The average family has 43
sequences aligned over 333 sites (Figure 1B). If all of the
alignments were concatenated, the total alignment length
would be 606,638 sites.

The average family in Magnum has a width of 4.2 amino
acid replacements per site (Figure 2A). The average branch
represents a distance of 0.2 replacements per site (Figure
2B). An unrooted phylogeny with n leaf sequences has n2 internal nodes and 2n-3 branches. The trees collected in
Magnum contain 81,746 internal nodes and 165,312
branches. Over 80% of internal nodes are less than 0.4
amino acid substitutions per site distant from a leaf
sequence (Figure 2C). A substantial fraction of these connected an internal node to a leaf. The remaining 20% of
the nodes, nearly all not directly connected to a leaf, were
more than 0.4 amino acid substitutions per site distant

Families

Of the 606,638 alignment sites, 68% were completely
gap-free. Where gaps do occur, they comprise less than
15% of all alignments characters for approximately twothirds of the families (Figure 1C) and are concentrated
within ten or fewer distinct regions for the typical family
(Figure 1D).

Alignment Sites

In Magnum, 31,283,104 ancestral sites were reconstructed. At 6,022,509 sites, the reconstruction suggested
gap characters, which are not assigned a probability value.
Although we do not consider replacements involving gaps
in this study, we chose to model the gapping history
because even a simple representation of the indel process
was preferable to ignoring it. Where the reconstructions
did not contain gaps, the overwhelming majority of conditional posterior probabilities for the primary amino
acids (the preferred amino acid reconstructed at a site in a
nodal sequence) were above 90% (Table 1).

Accuracy and error in reconstructed sequences
To obtain a general measure of the reconstruction accuracy at the typical site in the Magnum database, conditional posterior probabilities were obtained from the
marginal reconstruction method, which independently
treats each site at each internal node in order to calculate
the probability of deriving the leaf sequences starting
from each of the 20 amino acids at that position in the
tree (see Methods). These probabilities are conditional on
the parameters of the metatheory used during the reconstruction. As the accuracy of a reconstruction declines, so
to does the posterior probability value generated by the
scoring tool.

The primary amino acid residues reconstructed using marginal and joint methods were then compared. Discrepancies between these reconstructions would indicate
disagreement, which would imply uncertainty in reconstructions arising from an irresolvable concern over which
of the two methods is more likely to capture the historical
reality. Fortunately, the primary residue inferred using the
marginal reconstruction method differed from that
inferred by the joint reconstruction method at only 2.8%
of the ungapped ancestral sites (747,557 sites, see Table
1). These sites predominantly occurred among sites where
the marginal posterior probabilities were low. This indicates that disagreement between the "marginal reconstruction" and "joint reconstruction" metatheories is
found primarily at sites where the inferences of the ancestral amino acid are not confident in any case. At the
majority of these sites, the residue inferred by the joint
reconstruction method was the second or the third most
likely residue inferred by the marginal reconstruction
method.
From these results, we conclude that the majority of
ancestral reconstructions in Magnum are fairly accurate
and robust to the reconstruction philosophy (joint versus
marginal). More precisely, inferences drawn directly from
the Magnum database without further refinement of its

ancestral characters are not likely to be dominated by
database error. Further, when performing detailed analyses with the data, numerous indicators of accuracy are
available from Magnum to the user for deciding where the
reconstructions are likely to be less certain.

In the current version of Magnum, 1,057 families are associated with multiple PDB chains (Figure 3A). For the
majority of these families, a strong correlation exists
between the average length of the PDB chains and the
alignment length after correcting for sites without structural information (Figure 3D). This demonstrates that in
many families with multiple structures the same alignment sites are covered by each PDB chain.
The structural information was then used to assign surface
accessibility and secondary structural characteristics for
the 503,694 sites where it was available (Table 2). If more
than one PDB chain was applicable to a site, the side chain
accessibility values were averaged. At the 426 and 6,416
sites where four and three, respectively, secondary structure types were assigned we report the most common
type. In the event that none of the secondary structures are
more common than the others, such as in the 56,877 sites
with exactly two assignments, the secondary structure is
reported according to the following hierarchy: turn, helix,
coil, and then strand.
Residues at approximately half of the sites were less than
30% accessible. This is a threshold at which we distinguish 'buried' and 'exposed' sites for the studies below,
although the user is able to select alternative cutoffs. The
four secondary structure types were each well represented

Multiple sequence alignment was used to relate PDB

final sites, gaps were placed within the PDB chain
sequences (Figure 3C). At an additional 22,571 sites, residues in the PDB-listed sequence were aligned, but the
PDB database did not report resolved crystallographic
coordinates for their side chains, and therefore secondary
structural information was unavailable (Figure 3C). After
correcting for gaps and unresolved residues, 503,694 sites
were aligned with at least one resolved residue from the

Structural characteristics of the families
As a condition for inclusion within Magnum, each PIR
Superfamily had to be associated with at least one protein
chain from a structure in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
The median Magnum family has members associated with
two PDB chains (Figure 3A). The families with the longest
alignments have the fewest PDB chains and vice versa
(Figure 3B). We explain this by the observation that short
sequences are more prevalent in the PDB.

All reconstructed sites are cross-tabulated according to the posterior probability of the best marginal reconstruction amino acid and the marginal
reconstruction rank, from highest to lowest posterior probability, of the sole joint reconstruction amino acid.

at all levels of surface accessibility. Residues in strands
were more likely to be buried, while residues in turns were
more likely to be found on the surface [26]. Residues in
helices and coils did not show a preference for buried or
exposed sites.
Amino acid residue replacements along branches
As a further test of the uncertainty in the ancestral
sequence reconstructions, we asked whether patterns in
the replacement of amino acids as represented by replacements inferred from ancestral sequences were similar to/
different from those patterns obtained by many workers
(e.g., Dayhoff [27]) by comparing extant sequences. For
short, medium and long branches, 10,000 leaf-leaf and
node-node pairs were randomly selected. Replacements
were counted within these six collections of aligned
sequences, and Dayhoff matrices were constructed from
the replacement counts [see Additional file 1].

For the node-node comparisons, replacements were
counted using three tools that differed in the weighting of
replacements. The 'best count' tool assigned equal weight
to all replacements, which were detected by searching for
sites where the most probable parent residue differed
from the most probable residue at the same site in the
child nodal sequence. Using the same strategy to search
for replacements, the 'best fractional' tool weights each
replacement by the product of the marginal posterior
probability values of the parent and child residues. The
'all fractional' tool exhaustively considers, for every
aligned site, all possible combinations of parent and child
residues weighted by their combined probability. In addition to the 190 pairs of different residues (i.e. replacement
events), each tool also keeps a running total the 20 nonreplacement pairs.

Intriguingly, the correlation coefficient was larger in the
long branches examined than in the medium and short
branches. This phenomenon is not understood. Interestingly, the replacement pairs that deviate from the regression line in Fig. 4 appear most frequently to involve
alanine or valine. Further, alanine and valine appear to be
most conserved, regardless of the distance between the
sequences. This is a discovery worth investigating in the
future.

A clear linear relation was observed between corresponding node-node and leaf-leaf matrix elements at all three
distances regardless of the replacement counting tool (Figure 4A–C and data not shown). From this, we conclude
that replacement events reconstructed from node-node
comparisons are similar in type to the amino acid replacements based on leaf-leaf comparisons.

The branch lengths used in the Magnum trees are
obtained by fitting the matrix of pairwise leaf-leaf distances (in units of replacements per site) upon the tree
that gives the smallest total distance using the strategy in
the program Weighbor [28]. Once the ancestral sequences
are in hand, an alternative measure of the distance of a
branch connecting two nodes (or a node-leaf branch) was
obtained by examining two (or one) ancestral sequences,
and counting the number of changes, weighted by the
fractional probabilities of those residues where appropriate. These are "branch-lengths-from-reconstruction".

The number of changes on any branch at any individual
site cannot exceed unity, as multiple substitutions at a site
are not captured by simply comparing two sequences.
Thus, the branch-lengths-from-reconstruction, a metric
that averages these over all sites, cannot exceed unity. The
branch-lengths-from-reconstruction with the all fractional tool closely resembled the actual branch lengths,
especially at short distances (Table 3). The other tools
rarely overestimated the actual branch length (Table 3).
Where branch-lengths-from-reconstruction are less than
actual lengths, one explanation is that intermediate
replacements occurred at some sites. By correcting for
multiple substitutions, which occur more frequently on
longer branches and for sites with higher substitution
rates, it would be possible to improve the correspondence
between branch-lengths-from-reconstruction and the
actual tree branch lengths.

*Replacements per site from all fractional (AF), best fractional (BF), and best count (BC) tools.

We started by noting, trivially, that 190 distinct amino
acid replacement patterns exist given 20 standard amino
acids and ignoring directionality in time (X-to-Y equals Yto-X). In 14 of these, three nucleotide substitutions (one
at each codon position) are required to effect the replacement, regardless of the codons used in the parent or child
genes. Three of these pairs interconvert the hydrophobic
amino acid phenylalanine (F) with one of the polar
amino acids, lysine (K), glutamine (Q), or glutamate (E).
For example, the F-to-K replacement requires the conversion of a TTY codon (where Y is a pyrimidine) to an AAR
(where R is a purine), requiring a total of three transversions. The six shortest pathways for the F-to-E, F-to-Q, and
F-to-K replacements are shown in Figure 5.
The F-to-E/Q/K replacements on branches of any length
were found to be relatively infrequent, observed at only
0.026% of all recorded replacements (Table 4). The collection of F-to-E/Q/K replacements appears to be distributed
with no obvious preference in large and small families,
long or short alignments, or branches connecting sites
with higher or lower posterior probability. The F-to-E/Q/
K replacements are, however, found more frequently on

longer branches and in sites holding side chains on the
protein surface (Table 4). Each of these facts is readily
retrieved given the structure of the Magnum database.
In the hope of identifying F-to-E/Q/K replacements
involved in adaptive change, buried sites on short
branches (less than 0.12 substitutions per site) were
selected. Again, the Magnum database permitted this
information to be extracted with little effort. A total of 291
replacements satisfied these criteria [see Additional file 2].
First, the alignments and phylogenies were inspected to
determine which of these events might reflect database
error; misalignments were of special concern. Out of 41
events we found that 17 of the alignments were most
likely incorrect. This is not surprising due to the unusual
nature of the replacement events under inspection in this
sample. We expect, therefore, that this is a worst case
example.
Cellular retinoid binding proteins
While each of the remaining F-to-E/Q/K replacements
proved to be interesting, we choose to discuss here just

F-to-E/Q/K replacement pathways
F-to-E/Q/K replacement pathways. Start and end residues
are black with white codons, intermediate residues are gray
with black codons. Codons are written using DNA symbols
(A, adenine, T, thymine, C, cytosine, G, guanine, Y, pyrimidine, R, purine). Red pathways cross two different residues;
blue pathways cross one residue; dashed pathways cross a
stop codon. Note that dashed paths are identical in (A) F-toE, (B) F-to-Q, and (C) F-to-K.

This particular F-to-Q replacement was found in a lineage
leading to a subfamily of proteins, known as cellular retinol-binding protein II, after the mammals holding these
proteins diverged from bony fishes (Figure 6; branch 3). A
crystal structure of a member of this subfamily (135
amino acids, PDB: 1opbA) was used as a reference structure; the F-to-Q replacement occurs at position 4 in this
protein.
We considered two hypotheses. The first, actually intimated in the literature [29,30], is that the residue at alignment site 7 influences the geometry of the glutamine at
alignment site 122 (PDB:1opbA position 108) via hydrogen bonding. The glutamine at site 122 directly contacts
the hydroxyl group of retinol, and the carbonyl group of
retinal [29,30]. According to this model, F in site 7 forms
a "pi anion" interaction with the amide hydrogen of site
122 glutamine, constraining it to offer its amide oxygen to
either retinol or retinal, and therefore causing the protein
to favor the first as a ligand over the second. A Q at site 7
would be able to hydrogen bond with either the amide
oxygen or the amide hydrogen from Gln 122, allowing it
(in turn) to offer either the amide hydrogen or the amide
oxygen to the retinal or retinol (respectively), allowing it
to bind either (but see [31]). The intermediary amino
acids along the shortest pathways between F and Q do not
each possess the chemical properties to perform this
molecular physiological function. Leu cannot form a
hydrogen bond of any kind. His can form hydrogen
bonds that are analogous, although not geometrically

identical, to those that can be formed by Phe or Gln. Tyr,
in contrast, can form hydrogen bonds using the pi anion
mechanism; indeed these are at least as strong as those
formed by Phe.
The second hypothesis is that at least some of the intermediates between Phe and Gln are acceptable to the protein.
Under this hypothesis additional sequence data that articulated the branch, sequences that were not available when
version 2.62 of iProClass was established, might show
that the intermediate steps were found.
The second proved to be the case. Motivated by the peculiarity of the F-to-Q event in this protein family, we
searched for and found additional sequences from Gallus
gallus (Genbank: XP422636) and Xenopus tropicalis (Genbank: DN068529). Further, both contained a Tyr at site 7.
Therefore, articulating the tree along branch 3, we reconstructed a Tyr as an intermediate between the parent Phe
and the derived Gln. This is, perhaps not accidentally,
exactly the residue that would be chosen based on the
chemical logic in the preceding paragraphs.

It is still necessary, of course, to take two steps to get from
Tyr to Gln. Leu would presumably be unacceptable in this
role; His might be tolerated. Although efforts to further
articulate the tree must involve the sequencing of marsupials (these are in progress), we would predict that if the
tree were articulated and an intermediate amino acid were
detected, it would be His, not Leu.
Curiously, although Leu is not known in this lineage, it is
known elsewhere among the cellular retinol binding protein paralogs. This fact is easily discoverable with Magnum, given its support of browsing. It is found in site 7 in
several of the cousin families, including the cellular retinol-binding protein III, known in human and gecko (as a
crystallin [32]), and cellular retinol-binding protein IV,
known in mouse and human. Interestingly, the affinity of
these for retinal and retinol was both very low: Kd values
of 60 and 200 nM [33,34], compared with 0.1 nM for the
homologs that retain the ancestral F, and 10 nM for those
with the derived Gln at site 7 [35,36].
The opportunistic nature of database browsing, and the
ability of the Magnum database to support it, was then
illustrated again. The amino acid replacements along the

Page 10 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:89

branch leading to the gecko crystallin (Figure 4; branch 7)
were delivered from the precomputed Magnum database
[see Additional file 4], as was their distribution in the crystal structure of the nearest homolog (PDB:1gglA).
Remarkably, the sites undergoing replacement along this
branch were not randomly distributed. Rather, many of
them were concentrated in strands I and J, and helices 1
and 2, on the amino acids presented to the surface, creating a highly modified surface (Figure 7). We expect that
these are contact sites required for the formation of lens
crystals. A planetary biology explanation as to why this
protein, which binds the light absorber 3,4-didehydroreti-

nol, evolved as geckos moved from a nocturnal lifestyle to
a diurnal lifestyle is found in the literature [37].

Discussion
The Magnum database is presented here as a tool to permit the rapid exploration of hypotheses relating to protein
structure and function, using evolutionary analyses, and
to support the pursuit of leads obtained by browsing. As
required to obtain the full power of a combined evolutionary and structural analysis, Magnum integrates crystallographic protein data with detailed evolutionary
features, such as amino acid replacements inferred along

branches within the evolutionary tree. The precomputed
nature of the Magnum resource is critical for meeting its
intended uses but also imposes certain constraints.
Application to example questions
The present study interrogated a subset of replacements
involving three nucleotide substitutions, a buried site in
the protein structure, and a short branch in the phylogenetic tree. It is a rare and interesting event when a site
experiences multiple amino acid replacements on a short
branch. We hypothesized that these replacements on relatively short branches may indicate a functionally important site. The rationale behind this hypothesis is that if
none of the intermediates are observed, a "non-Markovian" process might drive the introduction of the second
and third transversion after the first occurs, because the
amino acids that are intermediates in the F-to-E, F-to-Q, or
F-to-K replacements create selective disadvantage on the
host organisms. As a counterhypothesis, some of these
events correspond to sites that are unimportant for functional reasons that would constrain their evolution, where
the intermediates are not seen in the reconstructed history
simply because the branch is not articulated (noting the
contingencies discussed in the introduction).

The F-to-Q replacement at alignment site 7 along the
branch leading to the mammalian retinol binding proteins was a case of poor articulation. Orthologs from the
recently completed chicken and frog genomes possessed
Tyr, an intermediate amino acid in the F-to-Q pathway.
Nevertheless, the structural position of this site suggested
that the amino acid residue it holds can modulate ligand
binding affinity by influencing the orientation of the dual
hydrogen bond donor/acceptor residue at a second site,
which is in direct contact with the polar end of the bound
ligand. These hypotheses are specific enough to be experimentally testable.
In the same protein family, we noticed an unusual protein
sequence from the gecko (Lygodactylus picturalis). Literature searches revealed that it had been found in the eye
lens and prompted us to ask if the sites replaced along this
branch might explain how this protein had been recruited
to function as a crystallin. Many of the sites were clustered
in a region of the protein with their side chains protruding
away from the surface – a pattern consistent with the
emergence of a new binding site.
These three examples illustrate how the naturally organized Magnum database supports querying across many
protein families, as well as opportunistically following
leads obtained by browsing, to quickly explore and generate hypotheses related to protein structure and function.

Integrating protein evolution and structures
Existing protein sequence and structure data sources are
Magnum's foundation, yet Magnum is much more than
the sum of its source data. The specific sources of raw data
chosen for inclusion in Magnum, and three major steps
employed to generate the final product, distinguish Magnum from other databases such as PFAM [38], Pandit
[39], and PALI [40]. The Magnum source data is first
organized under a common schema designed to allow
storage, integration, and retrieval of the source data and
its derived information. Importantly, this step establishes
the orthologous relationships between sequence and
structure protein sites. Genealogies are then built for each
protein family and the derived molecular evolutionary
information stored in the database. This process is not a
trivial one. It requires extensive planning, computational
processing, and integrating of results from different stages
of the evolutionary analysis. Finally, interactive browsing
and analysis tools are deployed that make use of a custom
application programming interface to the Magnum database.

The chemical behaviors of polypeptides determine, to a
large extent, biological phenotypes. Investigating the
molecular basis of phenotypes would be simple if the
behavior of a protein and the consequence of replacing
residues at particular protein sites were predictable from
the linear sequence of amino acids. In the absence of these
predictive powers, combining phylogenetic sequence
analyses with additional sources of complementary data
represents a powerful approach to the study of protein
molecular function [41,42]. While many would agree that
integrative biology is a worthwhile goal, the slow pace of
progress in this direction indicates significant challenges
exist. Here we succeeded at developing an integration
scheme for just two fields of protein study, evolution and
structure, which obviously have a synergistic relationship.
We applied the method in a high-throughput manner to
full-length protein families where at lea one crystal structure could be identified.
We attribute the successful synthesis, at least in part, to the
particularly detailed approach employed for reconstructing protein evolution. While many recognize that homologous sequences are more valuable when aligned and
organized phylogenetically, few have considered the benefits of capturing branch-specific replacement patterns
through the use of ancestral sequences. Reconstructing
amino acid replacements along phylogenetic lineages is a
realistic and efficient means of modeling the actual events
that have occurred during the divergent evolution of the
homologous protein sequences. The alternative, when
ancestral sequences are unavailable, is to make 'leaf-leaf'
comparisons. In leaf-leaf comparisons lineages are visited
multiple times as the paths for different leaf-leaf pairs

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:89

cross many of the same branches [43]. Leaf-leaf comparisons introduce bias in the counting of replacements, thus
making the interpretations more difficult. In addition,
leaf-leaf pairs are always separated by at least two
branches and the number of replacements separating
them will always be larger (in many cases much larger)
than the number of replacements along individual
branches. When searching for a few replacements of functional importance amidst a background of functionally
neutral replacements the smaller groups of mutations
organized by node-node comparisons are expected to be
helpful. In addition, node-node comparisons should capture multiple substitutions at a site better than leaf-leaf
treatments.
Homologous proteins with detectable sequence identity
possess nearly identical backbone structures [44]. Therefore, a single structure reasonably depicts the fold of all
members of a family of homologs. Here the definition of
what constitutes a protein family becomes important.
Homeomorphic protein families, such as those from the
PIR Superfamily resource, contain similar domain contents and arrangements, and the aligned sites share common structural environments. From a folded protein
model, sites with buried residues and sites with residues
exposed to the solvent are easily identified. Buried residues commonly interact to stabilize the protein fold,
whereas exposed residues can bind crucial ligands, catalyze reactions, and mediate the formation of inter-molecular complexes. Three-dimensional structures also divulge
groups of sites that might be distant in a linear sequence
but proximal in the folded structure, and regions of the
molecule that tend to remain flexible. When different proteins are crystallized as a complex, a detailed map of
where and how different proteins interact is also captured.
All of these structural insights can be investigated from a
fresh perspective when the different levels of protein structure (primary, secondary, etc.) are connected with a
detailed account of protein evolution.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/89

of scales, such as specific replacement patterns (e.g. F-toQ), groups of coincident replacements along a branch,
replacements in similar structural elements, or all of these
in combination. For those who are willing to follow leads
opportunistically, Magnum offers a unique resource that
enables discovery through browsing. We have found that
this can be an effective method for research project selection.
Ideally, Magnum should consider all families of proteins,
regardless of whether they are represented in the crystallographic database, and should be rebuilt continuously.
Limited resources required us to consider only those families represented in the PDB by a crystal structure, and to
construct only a static database from a single release of
iProClass (Version 2.62). The first limitation is not excessively severe; as such families are most susceptible to the
combination of structural biology and evolutionary biology that has proven to be so valuable in inferring function. The second is more severe, as is illustrated by our
discussion of the cellular retinol binding proteins.
Use of Magnum to analyze cellular retinoid binding proteins, and proteins involved in inflammation (M.B. and
S.A, in preparation), showed certain deficiencies related to
statically built databases. Most notable of these was the
absence of sequences deposited in the public databases
since the last build of Magnum was completed.
Another disadvantage is that specific metatheories must
be chosen before the database is built. The metatheories
and evolutionary parameters that we chose here generated
outputs that appear, by various metrics, reasonably accurate, meaning that errors in the alignments, trees, and
ancestral sequences will not dominate any conclusions
drawn by automated analysis of the database. Ideally, if
resources were available, the evolutionary models for
individual families would also be continuously upgraded
as these metatheories improve. We can even imagine a
human inspector evaluating each protein family.

Strengths and weaknesses of the approach
As demonstrated here with examples from the cellular
retinoid binding proteins, Magnum allows any inquisitive
user to ask questions about individual protein families
and get quick answers, which may beg additional questions that are either answerable through Magnum or by
consulting the scientific literature. There is no need to be
an expert or to spend days or weeks preparing the data
before the question can be asked. This is the most obvious
advantage of a precomputed resource such as Magnum.

Expediency of ancestral sequences
The core of an evolutionary model is a multiple sequence
alignment and an evolutionary tree. The first describes the
historical relation between individual codons in the genes
that encode the derived proteins; aligning two amino
acids in two derived sequences is equivalent to a statement that the codons encoding these two amino acids are
descendents of a single codon in the last common ancestral gene for the two.

Another distinguishing feature of Magnum is its inclusion
of detailed molecular evolutionary and structural information for a large number of diverse protein families. This
permits the user to browse or query the data across a range

Few dispute the existence of the ancestral gene/protein,
given the existing derived genes. The likelihood that the
model for any particular ancestral sequence corresponds
to a sequence that actually existed depends on many fac-

Page 13 of 18

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:89

tors. Most critical are the number of homologous
sequences that contribute to the reconstruction, the extent
to which the sequences have diverged, and how the tree
connecting them is articulated. Perhaps obviously, more
sequences, less divergence, and greater articulation leads
generally to a higher likelihood of correspondence than
fewer sequences, more divergence, and less articulation.
Also obviously, correspondence requires that the multiple
sequence alignment and the phylogenetic tree represent
the true evolutionary relationships. The treatment of phylogenetic correctness has received little attention in this
study for several reasons. The true evolutionary relationships for a protein family, including topology and branch
lengths, are unknowable in many cases due to the large
number of possible trees. Assessing the reliability of an
evolutionary tree through bootstrapping is also not without problems [45]. These issues would be partially surmountable if additional resources were available. For
example, the hierarchal Bayesian framework integrates
over uncertainty in the tree and branch lengths when
inferring ancestral sequences [46].
Given a substantial dataset and satisfactory congruence
between the actual history of a protein family and features
of the model for that history, other factors become important. These include the choice of a metatheory describing
the likelihood of specific amino acid replacements and
various tactics for apportioning variation between different sites. Although much has been written comparing
these various features of evolutionary metatheories (e.g.
[47]), the selection of a metatheory generally has far less
impact on the outcome than other factors. In particular, it
does not appear to be important to consider higher order
models for protein sequence evolution that include
replacements at adjacent or distant sites when inferring
the amino acids at individual sites in ancestral sequences.
To a good approximation, the amino acids at the derived
sites are sufficient [48-50].

Conclusion
In these demonstrations we have relied upon universal
protein/codon relationships, and additional criteria from
structural and evolutionary biology, to investigate individual amino acid replacements requiring three nucleotide substitutions. We remind that this is but one of
many analyses that can be performed using the protein
information assembled in the current version of Magnum.
Any analysis that considers how the amino acid replacements recorded at individual sites, or collections thereof,
along a single branch (or even branches in series) have
affected a measurable property of the descendent protein(s) would be addressable with Magnum. Of course,
analyses that integrate structural information would make
fullest use of the resources delivered.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/89

The integrative framework outlined here can be viewed as
the outset of an ambitious project to model biological systems from the bottom up. Integrating biological data from
other maturing areas would increase the number and type
of questions that can be addressed. For example, additional molecular components of biological systems (e.g.
transcription, translation, and protein dynamics), connections between these components (e.g. biochemical pathways, protein interactions, and metabolic networks), and
even a dating framework for inferring correlations
between the molecular and natural history records could
be integrated. When done properly, the integration of disparate, but interrelated, sources of biological information
offers a powerful resource for asking biological questions,
where the answers can be used to formulate new hypotheses and make predictions that warrant experimental testing.

Methods
Protein families and structures
Sequences and annotations for a universal, non-redundant protein set were obtained from the iProClass
resource [51]. Version 2.62 of iProClass was obtained in
March 2005. PIR Superfamily classifications [25] were
also obtained from iProClass. Unlike protein family classifications that split individual proteins into domains, PIR
Superfamilies include full-length proteins with common
domain architectures and sequence similarities over their
entire lengths.

To manage the redundancy in the Protein Data Bank, a
non-redundant set of protein chains from structures
solved by crystallography was obtained from the Pisces
protein culling server [52]. Each protein chain in the PDB
was then associated with individual iProClass protein
entries. This was accomplished with data from the
Seq2Struct resource [53], which associates proteins in the
PDB to entries in Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL [54].
In this way we obtained a set of PIR Superfamilies containing at least one member associated with a structure in
the PDB. Secondary structure data were obtained using
the dictionary of protein secondary structure (DSSP) [55].
Surface accessibility of individual residues is reported as
the DSSP value divided by the maximum value obtainable
for the residue [56]. When more than one PDB chain is
aligned at a site we report the average surface accessibility.
Atomic coordinates were collected from PDB legacy files.
Multiple sequence alignments
To begin investigating families and structures together,
global multiple sequence alignments of family members
and PDB chains were constructed using ClustalW [57].
Because insertions and deletions occur less frequently in
structured (alpha helix or beta sheet) regions relative to

Page 14 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:89

unstructured regions [58], secondary structure information was used to set the scoring penalties for placing gap
characters in the alignment.
For each family, a second alignment was constructed that
corresponds to the region in between the first and last columns having homology to at least one PDB chain residue.
Redundant sequences were removed from these alignments. Sequences with fewer characters than 60% of the
alignment length were deemed to be fragmentary and
were also removed from the alignment. These alignments
were used for all further analyses.
Amino acid replacement model
Pairwise distance estimation, phylogenetic tree inference,
and ancestral sequence reconstructions were carried out
with the Ancescon package [50]. Ancescon employs a
probabilistic model of amino acid replacement in which
alignment sites are assumed to evolve independently
according to a homogeneous, stationary and time reversible Markov process. The assumption of time reversibility
dictates that the matrix of amino acid substitution probabilities (or relative rates), S, be symmetrical. The S matrix
used was collected from more than 3,000 globular
sequences and is one of the best available descriptions of
amino acid replacement for most protein families [59].

For each alignment, an amino acid frequency vector, π,
and a rate matrix, Q, are determined. Off diagonal elements Qij are calculated as the off diagonal elements of
the matrix product
Q = S * diag(π)

(1)

and diagonal elements Qii were fixed so that the row sums
of Q equal zero. In theory, the transition probability
matrix of all 20 amino acids
P(t) = eQt

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/89

sums to the length of the alignment, just as if the substitution rate per site was held at unity.
Evolutionary distances between leaf sequences were estimated by maximum likelihood while incorporating substitution rate factors for each site. From the matrix of leafleaf distances, phylogenetic trees were inferred with the
weighted neighbor joining algorithm, Weighbor [28].
Weighbor accounts for the larger errors inherent in longer
distance estimates and has been reported to escape the
problems of long branches experienced by parsimony and
neighbor joining approaches. Weighbor produces trees
comparable to those from ML phylogeny reconstruction
in much less time.
Ancestral sequence reconstructions
Probabilistic ancestral sequences for each internal node
were inferred using the Ancescon package [50]. The models implemented in Ancescon deal with each site in an
alignment independently. The only model variables are
the ancestral amino acids. Other parameters in the model
are defined for each family. These include an amino acid
frequency vector calculated from the alignment, a set of
branch lengths from Weighbor, substitution rate factors
for each site, and, of course, the observed leaf sequences.
Ancestral amino acids at a site are reconstructed by maximizing the conditional probability of the ancestral character given the observed data in the leaf sequences.
Reconstruction using pre-set model parameters is generally referred to as an empirical Bayesian analysis [46].

Ancescon implements the method of Koshi and Goldstein
[48] for marginal reconstructions. In marginal reconstruction, each internal tree node site is treated separately. For
each site at an internal node, the probability of ancestral
amino acid X (AX) conditional on the set of observed leaf
sequences {AL}, the mutation matrix (M), and the phylogenetic tree (T) is calculated using Bayes' Theorem:

(2)

describes the probability of amino acid i being replaced by
amino acid j over time t as Pij(t). In practice, Pij(t) values
are calculated by decomposing the Q matrix into eigensystems.
Substitution rate factors, pairwise distances, and
phylogenies
For each site, a substitution rate factor was calculated
using the alignment based method [50]. Invariant sites
were assigned a rate of zero. At variable sites, substitution
rates were calculated according to the average transition
probability for all non-gapped, non-identical amino acids
pairs and normalized by the length of the alignment. In
this way, the substitution rate across all alignment sites

P( A X | A L , M, T ) =

P({A L }| A X , M, T )* P( A X )
P({A L }| M, T )

( 3)

where the P({AL} | AX, M, T) is the conditional probability
of the leaf sequences for a given ancestral amino acid, and
P(AX) the probability of the given ancestral amino acid.
Because the amino acids at all other internal nodes are
unknown, P({AL} | AX, M, T) is obtained by summing the
probabilities of the replacements needed to generate the
leaf sequences through all possible replacement paths
between the node and the leaf sequences. For example, for
a single site at an internal node in an unrooted tree with
four leaf sequences (1–4) and two internal nodes (5, 6),
the P({AL} | AX, M, T) can be expanded as:
P( A1 , A2 , A3 , A4 | A5 , M, T ) =

∑ PA5 A6 (αi ⋅ dA5 A6 )PA5 A1 (αi ⋅ dA5 A1 )PA5 A2 (αi ⋅ dA5 A2 )PA6 A3 (αi ⋅ dA6 A3 )PA6 A4 (αi ⋅ dA6 A4 )

(4)

A6

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:89

where the summation is over each of the twenty amino
acids at node A6. For each site at internal node A5, the P(AX
| AL, M, T) is calculated for each of the twenty amino acids.
Thus, at each internal node site marginal reconstructions
generate a vector composed of the twenty amino acids and
their posterior probabilities. In this context, the best
ancestral amino acid at a site will be that which has the
highest posterior probability.
Ancescon implements the method of Pupko et al. [60] for
joint reconstructions. In a joint reconstruction sites are
treated independently but all internal nodes are treated as
a set. The objective is to identify the most likely set of
amino acids for all internal nodes at a site that yields the
maximum joint likelihood of the tree. As a result, only a
single amino acid is reported for each site and conditional
posterior probabilities at a site are not available. For
details of the joint method the reader is referred to [60].
Gaps were placed in ancestral sequences according to the
default settings of the Ancescon program. The same rulebased strategy was applied in both marginal and joint
reconstructions. Thus, the gapping history is the same
regardless of the reconstruction method. The placement
of gaps in ancestral sequence proceeds by traversing a tree
from the leaves inward. If an internal node had one or
zero branches leading to the remaining descendents a gap
character was placed at that site at that node.
Reconstructed amino acid replacements
Replacements were tallied by comparing residues at
aligned sites of parent (ancestor) and child (descendent)
sequences that define a branch. Note that the parent-child
relations are created for organizational purposes and do
not imply the use of rooted phylogenies. Three methods
of counting were employed. The simplest method [61]
counts a replacement with weight probability of one if the
best parent and child amino acids are different. This is
referred to as the 'best count' method. The best residue
was judged by the posterior probability values for all
twenty residues. The 'best fractional' method finds
replacements by the same rule as the best count, but
counts are given a weight probability equal to the product
of the parent and child posterior probabilities. The 'all
fractional' method compares each parent with each child
residue and reports the sum of combined probabilities
where the amino acids differ. In the rare event that two
residues had the same posterior probability the residue
suggested by the Ancescon software was treated as the primary residue. Note that these ties only occur when the
best possible residue has a posterior probability less than
or equal to 0.5.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/89

Count and Dayhoff matrices
Log-odds (Dayhoff) matrices were created with the CreateDayMatrices option in the DARWIN package [62]. As
input, count matrices were constructed using the three
counting methods described above. For the 'best count'
method, identical amino acid pairs (on-diagonal terms)
were scored with a value of 1. A value of 0.5 was added to
both off-diagonal elements for non-identical pairs [61].
For example, upon observing a TS (threonine-serine) pair,
0.5 was added to both TS and ST matrix elements. This
results in a symmetrical matrix to account for the fact that
the direction of change is unspecified along a branch in an
unrooted tree. In the matrices derived with 'best fractional' and 'all fractional' tools, pairs were scored as the
product of the posterior probabilities. As before, nonidentical pair scores were halved and added to both matrix
elements.

Count matrices were constructed from pairs of aligned
sequences representing either two consecutive internal
nodes (node-node), or two leaf sequences (leaf-leaf).
Using branch length values (l), sequence pairs were placed
into one of three bins, short (0.005<l <0.015), medium
(0.120<l <0.220), and long (0.520<l <1.00). In each
range, 10,000 node-node or leaf-leaf sequence pairs were
randomly selected. For node-node pairs the branch
lengths were the values from the Weighbor phylogenies.
For leaf-leaf pairs, branch lengths represent the sum of
individual branch lengths along the shortest path from
one leaf to another. The chosen ranges were a compromise between maintaining a narrow enough range to keep
the members of each bin similar, while maintaining a
wide enough range to obtain enough branches to permit
statistical analyses. Frequency counts and Dayhoff matrices are provided as supplementary material [see Additional file 1].
