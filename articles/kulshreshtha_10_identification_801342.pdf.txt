Abstract
Background: Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) virus (ISAV) is a pathogen of marine-farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo
salar); a disease first diagnosed in Norway in 1984. This virus, which was first characterized following its isolation in
cell culture in 1995, belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae, genus, Isavirus. The Isavirus genome consists of eight
single-stranded RNA segments of negative sense, each with one to three open reading frames flanked by 3’ and 5’
non-coding regions (NCRs). Although the terminal sequences of other members of the family Orthomyxoviridae
such as Influenzavirus A have been extensively analyzed, those of Isavirus remain largely unknown, and the few
reported are from different ISAV strains and on different ends of the different RNA segments. This paper describes
a comprehensive analysis of the 3’ and 5’ end sequences of the eight RNA segments of ISAV of both European
and North American genotypes, and evidence of quasispecies of ISAV based on sequence variation in the
untranslated regions (UTRs) of transcripts.
Results: Two different ISAV strains and two different RNA preparations were used in this study. ISAV strain ADL-PM
3205 ISAV-07 (ADL-ISAV-07) of European genotype was the source of total RNA extracted from ISAV-infected TO
cells, which contained both viral mRNA and cRNA. ISAV strain NBISA01 of North American genotype was the
source of vRNA extracted from purified virus. The NCRs of each segment were identified by sequencing cDNA
prepared by three different methods, 5’ RACE (Rapid amplification of cDNA ends), 3’ RACE, and RNA ligation
mediated PCR. Sequence analysis of five clones each derived from one RT-PCR product from each NCR of ISAV
transcripts of segments 1 to 8 revealed significant heterogeneity among the clones of the same segment end,
providing unequivocal evidence for presence of intra-segment ISAV quasispecies. Both RNA preparations (mRNA/
cRNA and vRNA) yielded complementary sequence information, allowing the simultaneous identification and
confirmation of the 3’ and 5’ NCR sequences of the 8 RNA genome segments of both genotypes of ISAV. The 3’
sequences of the mRNA transcripts of ADL-ISAV-07 terminated 13-18 nucleotides from the full 3’ terminus of cRNA,
continuing as a poly(A) tail, which corresponded with the location of the polyadenylation signal. The lengths of
the 3’ and 5’ NCRs of the vRNA were variable in the different genome segments, but the terminal 7 and 11
nucleotides of the 3’ and 5’ ends, respectively, were highly conserved among the eight genomic segments of ISAV.
The first three nucleotides at the 3’ end are GCU-3’ (except in segment 5 with ACU-3’), whereas at the 5’ end are

5’-AGU with the polyadenylation signal of 3-5 uridines 13-15 nucleotides downstream of the 5’ end terminus of the
vRNA. Exactly the same features were found in the respective complementary 5’ and 3’ end NCR sequences of the
cRNA transcripts of ADL-ISAV-07, indicating that the terminal sequences of the 8 RNA genome segments are highly
conserved among the two ISAV genotypes. The 5’ NCR sequences of segments 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7, and the 3’ NCR
sequences of segments 3 and 4 cRNA were 100% identical in the two genotypes, and the 3’ NCR sequences of
segment 5 cRNA was the most divergent, with a sequence identity of 77.2%.
Conclusions: We report for the first time, the presence of intra-segment ISAV quasispecies, based on sequence
variation in the NCR sequences of transcripts. In addition, this is the first report of a comprehensive unambiguous
analysis of the 3’ and 5’ NCR sequences of all 8 RNA genome segments from two strains of ISAV representing the
two genotypes of ISAV. Because most ISAV sequences are of cDNA to mRNA, they do not contain the 3’ end
sequences, which are removed during polyadenylation of the mRNA transcripts. We report for the first time the
ISAV consensus sequence CAT/ATTTTTACT-3’ (in the message sense 5’-3’) in all segments of both ISAV genotypes.

Background
Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) virus (ISAV) is a pathogen of marine-farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar); a
disease first diagnosed in Norway in 1984 [1]. It has
continued to cause major disease outbreaks in marine
fish [2,3] with the clinical signs of severe anaemia, congestion of the liver and spleen along with haemorrhagic
liver necrosis [4]. ISA is an OIE [Office International
des Epizooties] listed disease [1]. The ISA virus was first
propagated in cell culture in 1995 [5], which allowed its
molecular characterization [6] and subsequent taxonomic classification to the family Orthomyxoviridae,
genus, Isavirus [7].
The ISAV particles are enveloped (90-140 nm in diameter) and contain a genome of eight single-stranded
(ss)RNA segments of negative polarity [1,6]. Like in
other orthomyxoviruses such as influenza A virus, each
RNA segment contains one to three open reading
frames (ORFs) flanked by the 5’ and 3’ non-coding
regions (NCRs). In influenza A virus, the first 12
nucleotides at the 3’ end and the first 13 nucleotides
at the 5’ end of NCR in all the viral RNA segments are
highly conserved [8-13]. These partially complementary
termini base pair to form terminal panhandle structures [14], which function as promoters by interacting
with the viral polymerase complex during replication
and transcription of viral RNA [8,15-20]. Moreover,
the segment specific NCR sequences may play important roles in virus virulence [21], and in the rescue of
influenza virus using the reverse genetics system
[8,22]. Although the terminal sequences of members of
the family Orthomyxoviridae such as Influenzavirus A
have been analyzed extensively and subsequently used
in engineering recombinant viruses, those of Isavirus
remain largely unknown, and the few reported are
from different ISAV strains and on different ends of
the different RNA segments [23-30]. Moreover, others
have reported unique 5’ terminal sequences for ISAV
RNA segments 2 [31], 3 [26], 5 [27], and 8 [7],

indicating a variation in the RNA templates used.
Furthermore, the focussed sequencing of cDNA to
ISAV mRNA to date has meant that all 3’ sequences of
ISAV found in the GenBank Database [32] till now
(except for genome segments 6 [27,28] and 7 [23,33])
are incomplete since the 3’ terminal sequences downstream of the orthomyxoviral polyadenylation signal
are removed during polyadnyelation [34].
Sequence analysis of several ISAV isolates in the ORFs
on the eight genomic RNA segments consistently reveals
two genotypes that are designated with respect to their
geographic origin, European and North American; the
two show 15-19% difference in their amino acid
sequences of the surface glycoproteins, fusion (F) protein and haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein [35]. It
has been proposed to designate the European genotype
as Genotype I and the North American genotype as
Genotype II because the virus has now been reported in
Europe, North America, and South America [3]. ISAV
isolates can be further differentiated on the basis of
insertion/deletions in a highly polymorphic region
(HPR) spanning residues 337 V to M 372 in the stem of
the HE protein, adjacent to the transmembrane region
[36], but the HPR is vaguely defined [37], and has been
rejected in epidemiological investigations because HPR
groups vary significantly and are not suited as an indicator of relatedness between virus isolates [38]. There is a
lack of information on the genetic changes in NCRs of
any RNA segment of ISAV although these sequences
are known to play a vital role in replication of orthomyxoviruses [8,15].
ISAV being an orthomyxovirus is characterized by
abundant genetic variation. Orthomyxoviruses such as
influenza viruses have high mutation rates because the
viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases have a high
misincorporation frequency and have no proofreadingrepair mechanisms [39]. Moreover, mismatch repair
mechanisms are unlikely to operate on replicating RNA
[40] and cannot operate on ssRNA progeny genomes

Kulshreshtha et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:338

[39]. In addition, RNA viruses generally have very short
replication times and generate very high virus yields
[41], two characteristics that strongly accelerate evolution of RNA viruses. As a consequence, viral quasispecies populations [39,40] are present wherever
orthomyxoviruses multiply in a host [42,43], and are
connected with a high potential for rapid evolution
[44,45] since the multiple variants are subjected to continuous adaptation pressure [46]. Quasispecies in influenza A virus isolates and samples have been readily
identified using the highly discriminating methodologies
of Mass Spectrometry coupled to RT-PCR [47], and
high-resolution genome sequencing [43]. There is very
limited information on the existence of ISAV quasispecies populations. In the report on ISAV terminal
sequences of segments 7 and 8 [23], the mRNA transcripts of these segments showed heterogeneous 5’ ends
suggestive of a quasispecies, however this was not
further pursued as the heterogeneity was attributed only
to cap-stealing that is characteristic of influenza virus
mRNA synthesis [24,48]. Kibenge et al. [3] used
sequence analysis of RT-PCR products of ISAV segment
6 ORF obtained directly from fish tissue and found 24
distinct HPR variants associated with the 2007-2009 ISA
epizootic in Chile, but only 7 distinct ISAV strains
based on segments 5 and 6 phylogenetic analyses. The
appearance of multiple HPR groups in such a short time
in tissues from the same or different fish originating
from the same or different fish farms indicated that the
ISAV HPR groups existed as quasispecies populations
[3]. To examine further the genetic diversity of ISAV
transcripts and the intra-segment viral evolution of
ISAV, the terminal sequences of an RT-PCR product
from each end of the eight RNA segments of ISAV
strain ADL-ISAV-07 were determined. Because of the
vital role they play in virus replication in orthomyxoviruses [9], it was considered that the diversity of terminal sequences in a population of viruses present in an
infected cell lysate as represented by RT-PCR would be
a true indication of ISAV quasispecies. In addition, the
3’ and 5’ NCR sequences of each of the eight segments
of the ISAV genome were determined from vRNA
extracted from purified virus particles of ISAV strain
NBISA01. The two different ISAV strains belong to the
two genotypes of ISAV (ADL-ISAV-07 is of European
genotype and NBISA01 is of North American genotype)
and each was a source of a different RNA type (mRNA/
cRNA versus vRNA) such that the NCR sequences
obtained were complementary, allowing the simultaneous identification and confirmation of the 3’ and 5’
NCR sequences of the 8 RNA genome segments of both
genotypes of ISAV. The experimental design of this
study is illustrated in Figure 1.

Results
Non-coding sequences of ISAV RNA segments determined
from transcripts of ISAV strain ADL-ISAV-07

The 5’ and 3’ UTR sequences of viral RNA segments
were determined using the Rapid Amplification of
cDNA ends (RACE) method. For performing the 3’
RACE, total RNA containing viral mRNA and cRNA
was reverse transcribed to cDNA, which was then
amplified by PCR using the ISAV segment specific primers (Table 1) and adapter primer (Invitrogen). The
adapter primer has 17-dT residues and an adapter
sequence with three restriction endonuclease sites. Since
the long stretches of dT residues do not base pair well,
the specificity of amplification was improved by performing a second PCR using the ISAV segment specific
primers (Table 1) and the universal amplification primer
(AUP). The nucleotide sequences of the cDNA of 3’
UTRs of five clones of each ISAV segment transcript
are shown in Figure 2, with the 17-dA residues of the
poly-A tail removed.
The 5’ RACE protocol with ISAV segment specific primers (Table 2) did not work for total RNA for any ISAV
segment despite repeated attempts. An RNA ligation
method as depicted in Figure 3[8,49] was therefore used
to obtain both the 5’ and 3’ end sequences. For this, the
5’ and 3’ ends of the ISAV transcripts in total RNA
were ligated using T4 RNA Ligase to form a single
stranded RNA circle. Using the appropriate primers
(Table 3), the circular RNA spanning the ligation junction was reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR.
These PCR products were cloned using the TOPO TA
cloning kit (Invitrogen) followed by plasmid DNA
sequencing. The nucleotide sequences of the cDNA of
the complete 5’ and 3’ UTRs of five clones of each ISAV
segment transcript, from the stop codon (TAA or TGA)
to the first codon (ATG) of the ORF, are shown in
Figures 4 and 5. The absence of a poly(A) tail in these
sequences for all eight ISAV segments indicated that
only viral cRNA molecules (Figure 1) had been circularized, and that we had obtained the full 5’ termini and
full 3’ termini of all eight ISAV segments of ISAV strain
ADL-ISAV-07 including any accompanying genetic
variation within each segment.
ISAV quasispecies based on non-coding terminal
sequences

In designing this study, it was considered that the diversity of terminal sequences in a population of viruses
present in an infected cell lysate as represented by RTPCR would be a true indication of ISAV quasispecies.
For this, two types of viral transcripts were studied; viral
mRNA transcripts were analyzed using the 3’RACE protocol whereas viral cRNA transcripts were analyzed

using RNA ligation method (Figure 1). Thus, a large
number of clones of cDNA to 3’ UTRs of viral mRNA
transcripts and to 5’ and 3’ UTRs of viral cRNA transcripts of segments 1 to 8 were screened and sequenced,
and the first five clones with good sequences in each
case were used for further analysis.
The lengths of the 3’ UTR sequences for mRNA transcripts of the different segments (Figure 2), and the 5’
and 3’ NCR sequences for cRNA of the different segments (Figures 4 and 5) were variable. However, significant homology was observed among the five different
clones of each end of the same segment in both viral
mRNA and cRNA. Interestingly, mutations and/or deletions were observed in both the 3’ UTR sequences of
mRNA and 5’ and 3’ NCR sequences of cRNA of all the
segments except in the NCRs of segment 5 cRNA,
which were highly conserved. Deletions were more prevalent in clones of the viral cRNA (Figures 4 and 5)

whereas nucleotide substitutions were mainly observed
in the viral mRNA (Figure 2) of the same segment. The
majority of the mutations in the cDNA to viral mRNA
were A®G or T®C mutations. The presence of these
mutations and deletions in clones of the same RNA segment were considered to indicate intra-segment ISAV
quasispecies. In order to document the quasispecies of
each NCR of ISAV RNA segment, a heterogeneity index
(HI) [50] was calculated as the proportion of ISAV
clones for a particular terminus of an RNA segment not
bearing the predominant sequences. All 3’ UTR
sequences of mRNA were heterogenous, with segments
2, 5, and 7 having the lowest HI (0.2) and segments 1, 3,
and 6 having the highest HI (0.8) (Table 4). Of all ISAV
NCR sequences, the lowest HI (0.0) was found in the 5’
and 3’ NCRs of segment 5 cRNA in which all five clones
had identical sequence (Table 5). The 5’ and 3’ NCRs of
segment 1 cRNA, and the 3’ NCR of segment 4 cRNA
also had low HI (0.2) since four of the five clones in
each case were identical. The 3’ NCR of segment 3
cRNA had the highest HI (0.8) of all NCRs of ISAV
cRNA, with all five clones having different sequences
(Table 5).

The 3’ and 5’ end sequences of the NCRs of RNA segments of ISAV were confirmed from RNA extracted
from purified virus, i.e., vRNA, using 3’ and 5’ RACE,
respectively, and appropriate primers (Tables 6 and 7).
For ISAV segments 2 and 3 vRNA, the 5’ RACE did not
work. In this case, the RNA ligation method (Figure 3)
[8,49] was used without tobacco acid pyrophosphatase
(TAP) treatment for segment 2 and with TAP treatment

PCR was performed on the cDNA spanning the ligation
junction.
3’ end of vRNA

The length of the 3’ NCR in the different genome segments was variable, ranging from seven nucleotides in
segment 6 to 48 nucleotides in segment 3 (Figure 6).
The terminal 7 nucleotides were conserved in all eight
segments except for segment 5 at position 3 with a
C®T mutation, segments 1, 4, 5, and 7 at position 4
with A®T mutation, and segment 5 at position 7 with a
G®A mutation. Exactly the same features were found in
the respective complementary 5’ end sequences of the
cRNA transcripts of ADL-ISAV-07 (Figures 4 and 5).
The first three nucleotides at the 3’ end in all members
of Orthomyxoviridae are GCU-3’ (except in ISAV

segment 5 with ACU-3’), and the length of the non-coding region in orthomyxoviruses other than ISAV is 2023 nucleotides long [51-54]. Table 9 summarises the
structural features of the NCRs of both genotypes of
ISAV. The 5’ NCR sequences of segments 1, 2, 3, 5, and
7 were 100% identical in the two genotypes of ISAV.
The 5’ NCR sequences of segment 6 were also identical
in the two genotypes except that ISAV strain ADLISAV-07 had a deletion of the first 2 nucleotides, which
was present in all 5 clones that were analyzed.
5’ end of vRNA

The length of the 5’ NCR in all eight ISAV segments
was significantly longer than the corresponding 3’ NCR
(Figure 7). It was also variable in the different genome
segments, ranging from 67 nucleotides in segment 4 to
147 nucleotides in segment 3 (Figure 7; Table 9). The 5’

which results in the formation of double helical structures
known as panhandle structures [55]. The predicted secondary structures of terminal sequences of the eight segments of ISAV strains NBISA01 and ADL-ISAV-07 at 15°
C and 37°C are shown in Figures 8 and 9. Those of the
NCRs of influenza A viruses are reported to be 21-24
nucleotides of which the self-complementary 3’ and 5 termini consist of terminal 12-13 nucleotides [24]. The present study shows that only 7-11 terminal nucleotides are
conserved in both genotypes of ISAV, resulting in slightly
fewer self-complementary nucleotides in the secondary
structures of genomic segments of ISAV.

terminal 11 nucleotides were conserved in all eight segments except for segment 3 at position 4 with a T®A
mutation, segments 3, 4, 5, and 7 at position 9 with
T®A mutation, segment 8 at position 10 with A®T
mutation, and segment 7 at position 11 with a C®G
mutation. Exactly the same features were found in the
respective complementary 3’ end sequences of the
cRNA transcripts of ADL-ISAV-07 (Figures 4 and 5).
The first three nucleotides at the 5’ end of vRNA are 5’AGU (or 5’-TCA in the cDNA), with the polyadenylation signal 13-15 nucleotides downstream of the 5’ end
terminus of the vRNA. This is also true for other members of Orthomyxoviridae [8,15]. In both NBISA01
vRNA (Figure 7) and ADL-ISAV-07 (Figures 4 and 5),
the polyadenylation signal sequence was identical in
each genome segment although the length varied
between 3 and 5 uridines, depending of the segment.
ISAV RNA segment 5 had the shortest, 3 uridines, while
segments 4 and 8 had the longest, 5 uridines and the
rest of the segments had 4 uridines. As summarized in
Table 9, the 3’ NCR sequences of segments 3 and 4
cRNA were 100% identical in the two genotypes of
ISAV, whereas the 3’ NCR sequence of segment 5
cRNA was the most divergent, with a sequence identity
of 77.2%.
Secondary structures of terminal sequences

The sequences of 3’ and 5’ terminal sequences of genomic
segments of orthomyxovirus are partially complementary,

Discussion
The present study focussed on the quasispecies distribution found in the NCRs of mRNA/cRNA of each
genome segment of ISAV. Comparison of 3’ UTR
sequences of mRNA transcripts from the different segments revealed heterogeneity among the five different
clones of the same segment for all RNA segments. The
5’ and 3’ NCRs of the cRNA from the different segments were also variable; the NCRs of segment 5
cRNA were the least variable with all five clones showing identical sequence, whereas the 3’ NCR of segment
3 cRNA had the highest HI (0.8) of all NCRs of ISAV
cRNA, with all five clones having different sequences
(Table 5). In a previous report on ISAV terminal
sequences of segments 7 and 8 [23], two different sets
of sequences, with and without 5’-end heterogeneous
extensions were found; the heterogeneity was attributed to cap-stealing that is characteristic of influenza
virus mRNA synthesis [48], whereas the sequences
without heterogenous extensions were attributed to
viral cRNA. In the present study, we were not able to
obtain any sequences from the 5’ ends of viral mRNA
because our 5’ RACE protocol did not work with the
total RNA preparations, and the RNA ligations worked
only for viral cRNA. Therefore, the heterogeneity
demonstrated in the present study cannot be explained
by cap-stealing, as it consisted mostly of deletions in
the 5’ NCR sequences of the cRNA (Figures 4 and 5).
Moreover, the heterogeneity was also found in the 3’
NCR sequences of cRNA (Figures 4 and 5) and in 3’
UTR sequences of viral mRNA (Figure 2). It is our
considered opinion that this sequence variation in
terminal sequences of the same segment end is suggestive of intra-segment ISAV quasispecies. It is interesting that on one hand both 5’ and 3’ NCRs of segment
5 (F gene) cRNA showed no variation in the five
clones while on the other extreme all five clones in
each of the 3’ NCR of segment 3 (NP gene) cRNA,
and the 3’ UTR sequences of mRNA of segments 1, 3,
and 6 (PB1, NP, and HE genes, respectively) had different sequences.

performed on the cDNA template using segment specific primers. The amplified product was gel-purified, cloned in a plasmid and plasmid DNA
sequencing was performed.

The biological significance of quasispecies in the terminal NCR sequences of ISAV is not known at this time.
We speculate that the quasispecies detected may play an
important role in ISAV replication. For replication in
influenza virus, it is known that viral RNA dependent
RNA polymerase initiates the RNA synthesis on viral
RNA by binding to the panhandle structure formed as a
result of partial complementarity of 3’ and 5’ non-coding
sequences of viral RNA [23]. Therefore, any alteration in
the sequence of non-coding region may affect the complementarity of 3’ and 5’ non-coding sequences, thereby
affecting the formation of panhandle structure and viral
replication as evidenced in the present study in which
the deletion of nucleotides (A and G) from the 3’ non-

coding region of segment 6 (of ADL-ISAV-07) affected
the formation of panhandle structure (Figure 9). Moreover, quasispecies may also play a role at the level of
protein expression. Wang and Lee [10] observed an
alteration in the protein expression level as a result of
induction of mutation in the non-coding regions of PB1
and PA genes of Influenza A virus. On the basis of that
study, it is possible that any change in the sequence of
non-coding regions in ISAV may affect protein expression as well. The transcripts of ISAV were analyzed at
15°C since this is the optimal growth temperature for
ISAV. The transcription and replication of ISAV is
based on the influenza virus model system and the predicted secondary structures of ISAV segments appear to

be analogous to the panhandle structures for influenza
virus. Therefore, the stability of ISAV panhandle structures at 15°C was compared to that of the influenza
virus panhandle formation at 37°C (Figures 8 and 9).
We report for the first time a comprehensive unambiguous analysis of NCR sequences of all eight RNA
genome segments from two strains of ISAV belonging
to the two ISAV genotypes. The experimental design
used (Figure1), whereby the viral mRNA/cRNA was
from ISAV strain ADL-ISAV-07 of European genotype
and the vRNA was from ISAV strain NBISA01 of North
American genotype, such that the NCR sequences
obtained were complementary, allowed the simultaneous
identification and confirmation of the 3’ and 5’ NCR
sequences of the 8 RNA genome segments of both
ISAV genotypes. The terminal sequences of the 8 RNA
genome segments are highly conserved among the two
ISAV genotypes. The 3’ NCRs of each ISAV RNA gene
segment are of variable lengths and the orthomyxoviral
consensus sequence 5’-AGCAAAGA (in the message
sense 5’-3’) is present in all segments except for segment
5 at position 3 with a C®T mutation, segments 1, 4, 5,

and 7 at position 4 with A®T mutation, and segment 5
at position 7 with a G®A mutation. Therefore, consistent with other reports of the ISAV 5’ NCR sequences
[25-30], we have confirmed the identity of the ISAV
consensus 5’ end sequences (Figure 6). Therefore, the
first three nucleotides at the 3’ end of vRNA in all
members of Orthomyxoviridae are GCU-3’ (except in
ISAV segment 5 with ACU-3’).
However, a BLAST search [56] of the GenBank Database [32] revealed additional unique 5’ terminal
sequences present on ISAV RNA segments 2 [31], 3
[26], 5 [27], and 8 [57,58]. These sequences, which

range from 1 to 12 additional nucleotides at the 5’ ends
(Table 10), are probably due to sequencing mRNA or
circularized cRNA templates resulting in appearance of
heterogenous sequences at the 5’ ends. The 5’ NCRs in
the present study were also of variable lengths on the
different RNA segments, and were also characterized by
an orthomyxoviral consensus sequence CAT / A TTTTTACT-3’ (in the message sense 5’-3’) in all segments
except for segment 3 at position 4 with a T®A mutation, segments 3, 4, 5, and 7 at position 9 with T®A
mutation, segment 8 at position 10 with T®A mutation,
and segment 7 at position 11 with a C®G mutation. A

Sequence obtained using the RNA ligation method.
Heterogeneity index (HI) is calculated as: 1-(proportion of clones bearing majority of the sequence). The number preceding the parentheses indicates a sequence
while the number within the parentheses indicates the numbers of clones in which that sequence appear.

BLAST search [56] of the GenBank Database [32]
revealed that all ISAV 3’ terminal sequences reported to
date are incomplete (i.e., they lack the consensus
sequence) except for genome segments 6 [27,28] and 7
[23,33]. This is because most ISAV sequences reported
are of cDNA to mRNA in which the 3’ end sequences
are removed during polyadenylation of the mRNA transcripts [34]. The sequences missing at the 3’ ends of the
positive strand for different RNA segments reported in
the GenBank Database [32] ranged from 6 to 21 nucleotides (Table 10). In the present study, the 3’ sequences
of the mRNA transcripts of ADL-ISAV-07 terminated
13-18 nucleotides from the full 3’ terminus of cRNA,
continuing as a poly(A) tail, which corresponded with

the location of the polyadenylation signal (Figure 2).
Thus, this is the first report to unambiguously identify
the ISAV consensus 3’ end sequences (Figure 7). Therefore, the first three nucleotides at the 5’ end are 5’-AGU

(or 5’-TCA in the cDNA), with the putative polyadenylation signal 13-15 nucleotides downstream of the 5’
end terminus of the vRNA. This is also true for other
members of Orthomyxoviridae [8,15]. Thus the changes
detected in the quasispecies may affect the polyadenylation of RNA transcripts of segments 4 and 8 of ISAV
strain ADL-ISAV-07. Other features of the ISAV genome, like promoter sequences have not been reported
yet. However, by analogy with influenza virus, it is possible to annotate the location of promoters in ISAV. Various studies on influenza virus have reported that the
first 12 nucleotides at the 3’ end of non-coding regions
and the first 13 nucleotides at the 5’ end of non-coding
regions of all the viral RNA segments form the

Page 11 of 19

promoter responsible for replication and transcription
[10,55,59,60]. Based on the analogy, it appears that the
first 7 nucleotides at 3’ end of non-coding region and
the first 8 nucleotides at 5’ end of non-coding regions of
all the ISAV RNA segments may comprise the ISAV
promoter (Figure 10). Thus the changes detected in the
quasispecies may affect the promoter activity in all the
segments of ISAV (ADL-ISAV-07) except segment 5.
It is interesting that in the quasispecies study, all five
clones of the 3’ NCR of segment 5 cRNA of ADL-ISAV07 had identical sequence (HI = 0.0), and yet it was the
most divergent between the two ISAV genotypes at
77.2% sequence identity. This is even more divergent
than at the amino acid level [3]. Conversely, the 3’ NCR
sequence of segment 3 cRNA of ADL-ISAV-07 had a
heterogeneity index of 0.8 and yet it was 100% identical
between the two ISAV genotypes. Thus the 5’ NCR
sequences of segments 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7, and the 3’ NCR
sequences of segments 3 and 4 cRNA were 100% identical in the two genotypes. These identical sequences
were also present in ISAV strains of both genotypes for
sequence deposited in the GenBank database [32].
Clearly, the biological significance of ISAV quasispecies
warrants further study.

Conclusions
In conclusion, using sequence analysis of multiple clones
derived from one RT-PCR product for each mRNA/
cRNA transcript end for the 8 RNA genome segments,
we present evidence of intra-segment ISAV quasispecies,
with some RNA segments being more prone to genetic
changes in their transcripts. The 3’ NCR sequence of segment 5 was the least divergent within the viral population
but was the most divergent between the two ISAV genotypes. Conversely, the viral population of 3’ NCR
sequence of segment 3 cRNA transcripts was the most
heterogenous but the consensus sequence was identical
between the two ISAV genotypes. Moreover we report
for the first time the comprehensive unambiguous identification of the 5’ and 3’ terminal sequences of the 8 RNA
genome segments from two strains of ISAV representing
the two genotypes of ISAV. Because most ISAV
sequences are of cDNA to mRNA, they do not contain
the 3’ end sequences, which are removed during polyadenylation of the mRNA transcripts. We report for the first
time the ISAV consensus sequence CAT/ATTTTTACT3’ (in the message sense 5’-3’) in all segments of both
ISAV genotypes.
Methods
Viruses

ISAV strains NBISA01 of North American genotype,
and ADL-PM 3205 ISAV-07 of the European genotype
were used in this study. NBISA01 was propagated in
CHSE-214 cell line whereas ADL-PM 3205 ISAV-07
was propagated in the macrophage/dendritic like cell
line (TO cell line), and the lysates were harvested as
described [61,62].
RNA extraction

Total RNA was extracted from ISAV-infected TO cells,
and vRNA was extracted from purified virus by

treating the samples with 1.2 ml of TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen) for 10 minutes, and then adding 300 ul of
chloroform followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm
for 15 minutes. The aqueous phase was loaded on
RNeasy Mini Columns and subsequent steps were carried out as per the protocols of RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The extracted RNA was subsequently treated
with DNAse I to remove the contaminating DNA
using the RNase-free DNAse I (Qiagen). The purity of
RNA was examined using A260/280 ratio based on
spectrophotometer readings.
Amplification of 5’ and 3’ non-coding sequences of ISAV
genome

Attempts were made to use the rapid amplification of
cDNA ends (RACE) method to determine the 5’ and 3’
NCRs of the ISAV genome.
The 5’ RACE was performed using a commercially
available kit from Invitrogen. In this method, first strand
cDNA was synthesized from RNA with M-MLV enzyme
(Invitrogen) using the ISAV segment specific primers
(ssp1) (Table 2). The synthesized cDNA was purified to
remove excess nucleotides and primers. The purified
cDNA was polyadenylated with terminal deoxynucleotidyltraferase (TdT) followed by PCR amplification with
Abridged Anchor Primer, which is supplied with the 5’
RACE kit (Invitrogen), and ISAV segment specific primers (ssp2) (Table 7). The amplified products were gel
purified using the Q1A quick gel extraction kit (Qiagen)
and were used as templates for performing PCR using
the Universal Amplification Primer (UAP) and ISAV
segment specific primers (ssp2) (Table 7).
The 3’ RACE was performed using a commercially
available kit from Invitrogen. In this method, the viral
RNA was first polyadenylated by treating the RNA with
poly-A-polymerase (Ambion) at 37°C for an hour. The
viral RNA was purified using NucAway spin column

to plasmid DNA sequencing.
RNA ligation and RT-PCR

The 3’ and 5’ ends of ISAV RNA were ligated using T4
RNA Ligase (Invitrogen). A duplicate sample of viral
RNA was first treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) (Epicenter) at 37°C for 1 h. It was then purified using NucAway spin column (Ambion) prior to the
ligation reaction. RNA (14 ul) was ligated in a total

volume of 20 ul in 1 × X T4 RNA Ligase buffer, 40
units of RNase out (Invitrogen) and 40 units of T4 RNA
Ligase. The mixture was incubated at 37°C, followed by
heat inactivation at 65°C for 15 min. The cDNA was
synthesized from circularized RNA using the Superscript
III First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Subsequently the PCR was carried out in a final
volume of 50 ul containing 1X Expand HiFi reaction
buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 uM dNTPs, 2.5 U Expand
