<p>Gene expression profiles of five brain regions
Gene expression relationships of mouse strains from six inbred mouse strains suggest that many regulatory networks are highly specific

Background: Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping is used to find loci that are responsible
for the transcriptional activity of a particular gene. In recent eQTL studies, expression profiles were
derived from either homogenized whole brain or collections of large brain regions. However, the brain is
a very heterogeneous organ, and expression profiles of different brain regions vary significantly. Because
of the importance and potential power of eQTL studies in identifying regulatory networks, we analyzed
gene expression patterns in different brain regions from multiple inbred mouse strains and investigated the
implications for the design and analysis of eQTL studies.

information

Conclusion: Our results suggest that many regulatory networks are highly brain region specific and
indicate the importance of conducting eQTL mapping studies using data from brain regions or tissues that
are physiologically and phenotypically relevant to the trait of interest.

interactions

Results: Gene expression profiles of five brain regions in six inbred mouse strains were studied. Few
genes exhibited a significant strain-specific expression pattern, whereas a large number of genes exhibited
brain region-specific patterns. We constructed phylogenetic trees based on the expression relationships
between the strains and compared them with a DNA-level relationship tree. The trees based on the
expression of strain-specific genes were constant across brain regions and mirrored DNA-level variation.
However, the trees based on region-specific genes exhibited a different set of strain relationships,
depending on the brain region. An eQTL analysis showed enrichment of cis-acting regulators among strainspecific genes, whereas brain region-specific genes appear to be mainly regulated by trans-acting elements.

Background

Recent genome sequencing efforts have catalogued DNAlevel variation between different species, strains, and individuals. In addition, gene expression profiling data indicate that
there is considerable variation in expression patterns
between strains of inbred mice and individual humans, and
several recent articles have studied some of the underlying
regulatory mechanisms responsible for this variation [1-5].
The expression studies are based on mapping of so-called
'expression quantitative trait loci' (eQTL), in which gene
expression profiles are treated as quantitative traits, and
genome-wide association and linkage mapping are performed to localize regulatory elements that affect the expression of the corresponding differentially expressed genes. The
underlying logic is that if a regulatory element coincides with
the known location of the differentially expressed gene, then
it most likely represents a cis-acting regulatory element,
whereas a regulatory element identified at a different location
most likely represents a trans-acting regulatory element.
However, the relationship between DNA sequence differences and gene expression levels on a genomic scale, and how
these two types of variation influence the activities of genes
across different tissues has not been studied in detail.
We believe that inbred mouse strains offer an excellent model
to study the relationship between DNA-level variation and
variation in gene expression patterns, because the genealogy
and DNA-level variation across different strains are well
known. We investigated whether inbred strains that are
closely related have gene expression profiles that on average
resemble each other more than strains that are distantly
related. In addition, we were interested in localizing regulatory elements of genes with either strain- or brain region-specific expression patterns by eQTL analyses.

Results

We considered how global DNA-level variation correlates
with gene expression pattern variation across five brain
regions in six inbred mouse strains. The genealogy of these
strains is well known [6], and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data are publicly available [7,8]. We constructed
a DNA-level phylogenetic tree based on genetic similarity
across 12,473 SNPs [8] (Figure 1a). The derived relationships
correlate well with the known genealogies of the strains and
previously published DNA variation-based relationships
[9,10].

Indentification of genes with strain-specific or brain
region-specific expression
We carefully dissected five different brain regions (bed
nucleus of the stria terminalis [bnst], hippocampus, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray [pag], and pituitary gland) from
six commonly used inbred mouse strains (129S6/SvEvTac, A/
J, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, and FVB/NJ). Replicate
gene expression patterns were measured using the Affymetrix

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/2/R25

mouse genome 430 2.0 arrays, which contain 45,037 probe
sets and cover a significant portion of the mouse transcriptome. Next, we performed a multiple regression formulation
of an analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the different mouse
strains and brain regions, as well as their interactions, as the
independent variables, and using gene expression signal as
the dependent variable to identify genes that exhibited either
strain-specific or region-specific effects. We chose to use a
regression model because of the fact that we had an imbalance (61 observations) in our design.
A total of 2,235 probe sets (5.0%) exhibited a significant
strain-specific effect (P < 0.01; the strain effect was more significant than the brain region effect; false discovery rate q
value < 0.004). The q values were obtained using the
'smoother method' of Storey and Tibshirani [11]. However,
even using the more conservative Benjamini and Hochberg
[12] method produces q values of 0.02 for P values < 0.01.
Somewhat surprisingly, 19,813 probe sets (44.0%) exhibited a
brain region-specific expression pattern (P < 0.01; the regionspecific effect was more significant than the strain effect; q
value < 0.001).
In addition to the regression formulation that accounted for
an unbalanced sample design, a simple two-way ANOVA, in
which the outlying unbalanced sample (least correlated) was
removed, was conducted in order to determine the number of
probe sets that exhibited a significant interaction between
strain and brain region. This analysis yielded virtually identical results to those of the regression formulation in terms of F
statistics (the F statistics and P values of the regression formulation and two-way ANOVA are available for all probe sets
in Additional data file 1). The number of probe sets that exhibited a significant brain region and strain interaction (P < 0.01;
q value = 0.01) in the two-way ANOVA model was 7,415.
These data indicate that although there are significant differences in gene expression between different inbred strains, a
large proportion of genes exhibit region-specific expression
patterns and interactions between strain and brain region,
suggesting that multiple region-specific regulatory mechanisms control gene expression.

Correlation of DNA sequence variation and gene
expression level variation
In order to determine the extent to which DNA sequence variation correlates with gene expression level variation in different brain regions, we constructed phylogenetic trees of strain
relatedness using either strain-specific or region-specific
genes identified by the regression model (Figure 1). We averaged the (scaled) gene expression signals for the replicate
samples for each gene and calculated a Pearson correlation
coefficient for the signal intensities between all possible
strain combinations for each brain region. We then transformed these correlation coefficients into distances to construct phylogenetic trees (Figure 1). The tree based on the
expression levels of the strain-specific genes (Figure 1c) has

information

To test whether these correlations between the gene expression-based trees and the SNP tree are significant, we broke
down the expression trees by brain region and used Mantel's
matrix correspondence test. We compared the strain-specific

gene expression trees and the region-specific gene expression
trees with the SNP tree for each brain region separately. By
using the strain-specific genes, there was a significant correlation between the SNP tree and each of the strain-specific
expression trees (bnst: R = 0.727, P = 0.008; hippocampus: R
= 0.680, P = 0.002; hypothalamus: R = 0.529, P = 0.008;
pag: R = 0.715, P = 0.004; pituitary: R = 0.512, P = 0.023). By
contrast, there was no statistically significant correlation
between the SNP tree and any of the region-specific expression trees (bnst: R = 0.466, P = 0.180; hippocampus: R =
0.476, P = 0.195; hypothalamus: R = 0.370, P = 0.169; pag: R
= -0.072, P = 0.524; pituitary: R = 0.271, P = 0.135). The
strain-specific gene trees were more similar to the SNP tree
than the region-specific gene trees (paired t-test P = 0.006).
When the strain-specific expression trees where compared
with each other, all pair-wise comparisons (n = 10) were statistically significant (R > 0.48, P < 0.024). When the regionspecific expression trees where compared with each other,

branches that exhibit strain relationships that parallel those
based on the SNPs (Figure 1a). Within each strain, brainregion relationships follow the molecular architecture of the
brain [13] shown in Figure 1b. Likewise, the tree based on
region-specific genes (Figure 1d) has branches that show individual brain region clustering according to the molecular
architecture. However, the strain relatedness within each
brain region branch varies and exhibits a different set of
strain relationships depending on the brain region. Because
both the strain-specific and region-specific genes cluster in
brain regions according to the known molecular architecture
of the brain [13], it is not likely that the observed clustering
patterns are due to random noise.

only two comparisons out of ten were statistically significant
(bnst versus pituitary: R = 0.406, P = 0.04; and hippocampus
versus hypothalamus: R = 0.620, P = 0.025), which is consistent with our proposition that the strain-specific expression
trees resemble the SNP tree and each other, and that the
region-specific expression trees do not correlate with each
other, DNA-level variation, or known genealogy. In other
words, the known genetic differences (SNPs between strains)
have a low and insignificant correlation to brain region-specific differences, whereas the strain-specific differences
exhibit a high and significant correlation to genetic
differences.
These data suggest that because the relatedness of the strains
based on strain-specific genes correlate with the DNA-level
variation and known genealogy, the expression of strain-specific genes (that comprise only about 5% of all genes on the
array) is mostly regulated by cis-acting regulatory elements.
DNA variations in a cis-regulatory element are likely to affect
mainly the transcription of a single gene close to that regulatory element, and more dramatic gene expression differences
between strains are associated with cis-acting eQTLs (Schadt,
unpublished data). Therefore, a phylogenetic tree based on
SNPs and a tree based on genes with cis-acting regulators
should be similar.

Global eQTL analysis shows an enrichment of cis-acting
eQTLS among strain-specific genes
To assess this hypothesis we conducted an eQTL analysis on
gene expression data from the six inbred strains. Indeed, 48%
of the strain-specific probe sets with SNP markers within 4
megabases (Mb) had significant cis-acting eQTLs (P ≤ 0.001;
1,015 out of 2,115 probe sets [a subset of the original 2,235
strain-specific probe sets that had SNP markers located
within 4 Mb]), whereas only 10% of the region-specific probe
sets exhibited significant cis-acting eQTLs (1,940 of 18,868
region-specific genes with markers within 4 Mb).
Strain-specific SNPs within a probe sequence could cause differential hybridization and affect expression results, leading
to spurious associations and an artificial enrichment of
strain-specific cis-acting eQTLs. In order to control for strainspecific SNPs that could affect hybridization, we used an algorithm developed in our laboratory that takes advantage of the
fact that Affymetrix GeneChips use a series of oligonucleotides that span up to hundreds of bases of a given gene to
detect potential sequence variations between the strains
(Greenhall and coworkers, unpublished data; see Materials
and methods, below). These oligonucleotides (called probes)
yield distinct patterns of intensity for each gene. The probe
pairs are sensitive enough that appropriately positioned single base differences between the probe pair and the detected
RNA can significantly change the signal intensity, and thus
produce different patterns between slightly different
sequences [14].

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/2/R25

We compared the underlying patterns of signal intensity
between the strains to identify probe sets that may harbor
sequence differences. Using a Bonferroni corrected P < 0.01
(calculated from a two-tailed Student's t-test [unpaired, equal
variance]), 144 out of the 1015 strain-specific probe sets with
significant cis-acting eQTLs were predicted to harbor
sequence differences within the probe set that may affect
hybridization. Of the 1940 region-specific probe sets with significant cis-acting eQTLs, 167 were predicted to harbor
sequence differences. When we ignore all probe sets that are
predicted to harbor strain-specific sequence differences that
could adversely influence hybridization, 56% of the strainspecific probe sets with SNP markers within 4 Mb had significant cis-acting eQTLs (P ≤ 0.001; 901 out of 1611 probe sets),
whereas only 10% of region-specific probe sets exhibited significant cis-acting eQTLs (1,773 of 17,422 probe sets). Using a
less conservative P value threshold for the polymorphism
detection algorithm did not change the relative enrichment of
cis-acting eQTLs among strain-specific genes (see Additional
data file 2).
A caveat of the eQTL analysis is that the limited number of
strains leads to a high rate of type I errors. However, the likelihood that significant false-positive eQTLs will be located
within 4 Mb of the gene of interest, rather than anywhere in
the genome, is greatly reduced. Moreover, our eQTL analysis
should not be thought of as a traditional eQTL mapping study
because it was not focused on the effect of an individual gene
or marker, but rather on overall genomic trends or the trends
of large groups of genes. For a detailed discussion concerning
the determination of the false positive rate, see Materials and
methods (below). Our regression model analysis showed that
a large proportion of genes that are expressed in the brain are
brain region-specific, and the derived relationships of the
strains differed depending on the brain region, suggesting
mainly trans-acting regulators for these genes, at least in
these brain regions. Although the eQTL analysis showed a
larger number of potentially trans-acting eQTLs among the
brain region-specific genes (3023, as compared with 1358
trans-acting eQTLs among the strain-specific genes), it is difficult to demonstrate this trend definitively with the small
number of strains analyzed.

Certain genes have complicated expression patterns in
the brain
Our findings show that there is a large number of brain
region-specific genes, suggesting that many regulatory networks are highly brain region specific. Certain genes have
extremely complicated expression patterns whose variation is
dependent on both strain and brain region effects. For example, the relative expression levels for two genes that exhibit
significant strain and brain region variation, namely Penk
(which encodes preproenkephalin) and Foxp1 (which
encodes forkhead box P1), are shown in Figure 2 in a virtual
three-dimensional brain atlas. Both genes exhibit interesting
strain and region-specific expression patterns. In the hippoc-

information

By investigating DNA polymorphisms and gene expression
profiles of various brain regions in six inbred mouse strains,
we noticed an enrichment of cis-acting regulators among the
strain-specific genes, whereas the brain region-specific genes
seem to be mainly regulated by trans-acting elements. In
addition, our data suggest that different inbred mouse strains
have very different relative amounts of certain transcripts in
some brain regions, indicating that there are complex brain
region-specific regulatory networks. Our findings shed light
on regulatory mechanisms of gene expression in different tissues and strains on a genomic scale, and have important
implications for the design and analysis of eQTL mapping
studies. In order to identify meaningful regulatory networks,
it is important to obtain gene expression profiles from sufficiently small, anatomically refined tissues.

higher in the 129S6/SvEvTac strain than in the A/J strain.
However, in the bnst and in the pag, the expression level of
Penk is higher in the A/J strain than in the 129S6/SvEvTac
strain. Similarly, the expression level of Foxp1 is higher in the
129S6/SvEvTac hippocampus than in the A/J hippocampus,
but in all other regions studied Foxp1 expression level is
higher in A/J animals than in 129S6/SvEvTac animals.

the context of brain anatomy. A ratio of the signal intensities of (a) Penk
and (b) Foxp1 between 129S6/SvEvTac (129) and A/J (A) strains is shown

values are shown in the upper right corner of each panel for each brain
region separately, together with color coding that matches the color of
each brain region in the three-dimensional mouse brain atlas, shown from
four different angles. Note that the gene expression level of Penk in Hi and
Hyp is higher in the 129 strain than in the A strain, but in Pag and Bnst it is
higher in the A strain than in the 129 strain. Similarly, the expression level
of Foxp1 in Hi is higher in the 129 strain than in the A strain, whereas in
Hyp, Bnst, and Pag the expression level is higher in the A strain than in the
129 strain.

The large differences in gene expression patterns across the
strains depending on brain region indicate that it is essential
to conduct eQTL mapping using data from brain regions that
are physiologically and phenotypically relevant to the disease
or trait being investigated. Our results show that it is important to dissect a sufficiently small, reasonably homogeneous
anatomic regions for gene expression profiling studies in
order to avoid 'dilution' of strain-specific and region-specific
effects. If several brain regions are combined, then the
observed gene expression profiles will be a weighted average
of the expression profiles of the individual regions. If a gene
is expressed at measurable levels in multiple regions, then
there will be a decrease in sensitivity to a change in any one
region. If there are opposing gene expression patterns in multiple regions, then the measurement from a combined sample
could miss important changes or even yield misleading information about underlying regulatory mechanisms.

comment

We have shown that the extent of global DNA sequence variation does not directly determine the extent of gene expression variation between inbred mouse strains. Furthermore,
the strains that are genetically and genealogically most
closely related sometimes have significantly different expression patterns. Interestingly, we observed that the expression
of the strain-specific genes appear to be driven mainly by cisacting regulatory elements, whereas the brain region-specific
genes are mainly regulated by trans-acting regulators. It has
been shown that trans-acting regulators affect expression
levels of multiple genes [15], and that both cis-acting and
trans-acting loci regulate variation in the expression levels of
genes, although most act in trans [1]. The heritability estimates for gene expression regulation are relatively low
(median value 0.34) [3], at least based on expression data
from cell lines. Therefore, it is likely that the expression of the
majority of genes is influenced by environmental or nongenetic factors, including epigenetic mechanisms, such as
DNA methylation and histone acetylation.

Materials and methods
Animals
Seven-week-old male inbred mice were received from the
Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) (A/J, C3H/HeJ,
C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, and FVB/NJ) or from Taconic Farms
(Germantown, NY, USA) (129S6/SvEvTac). Animals were
singly housed for 1 week before dissections were conducted.
All animal procedures were performed according to protocols
approved by the Salk Institute for Biological Studies Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Tissue collection and RNA preparation for gene
expression analysis
All brain dissections were done between 11:00 and 17:00
hours on a petri dish filled with ice using a dissection microscope. The dissected brain regions for gene expression analysis included hypothalamus, hippocampus, pituitary gland,
periaqueductal gray (pag), and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (bnst). Hippocampus samples were directly frozen on
dry ice and stored at -80°C. The smaller brain structures were
collected in RNA Later buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) and
samples from two to five animals were pooled and stored at 80°C. At least two independent replicate samples for each
strain and brain region using independent animals were dissected. If samples were pooled, at least two independent
pools were collected. The extraction of total RNA from the tissues was performed using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), in accordance with the manufacturer's
instructions.

Microarray experiments
Gene expression analysis was done using mouse genome 430
2.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), which contain
about 45,000 probe sets. Labeling of samples, hybridization,
and scanning were performed as described elsewhere [13].
Two replicate samples from independent animals were prepared for each strain and each tissue (analysis of bnst for
C3H/HeJ was performed in triplicate).

Data analysis
Array results were analyzed using several different methods.
First, .cel files were generated using Affymetrix software,
imported into the TeraGenomics expression database, and
then processed within the TeraGenomics analysis system
(Information Management Consultants, Reston, VA, USA)
[13]. More detailed information on the statistical methods
and the TeraGenomics platform can be found in Additional
data file 3 and at the TeraGenomics home page [16].
Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the UPGMA option
of the MEGA3 software [17]. SNP trees were constructed
based on the fraction of allele differences across all loci
between strains. Several different metrics were tested using
this strategy resulted in a tree that correlated best with the
known genealogy of inbred strains. The SNP genotypes were
from the same mouse strains as the expression data, except

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/2/R25

for the 129 strain. We used genotypes from 129S1/SvImJ and
gene expression data from 129S6/SvEvTac substrain. We had
genotypes available from four different 129 substrains and all
of them clustered into a separate clade close to each other in
a phylogenetic tree [8]. We selected the 129S1/SvImJ genotype because this strain is genealogically closest to 129S6/
SvEvTac. Therefore, the analysis should not have suffered
from using a slightly different, but closely related 129 strain
for the two types of analyses.
Two-factor regression formulations of an ANOVA were performed using an in-house software program written in standard FORTRAN for Unix using the gene expression files of
each array from the absolute analysis of the TeraGenomics
analysis system. The results were refined and sorted in Excel.
Only genes that scored as 'Present' in one of the files were
included in the analysis. In order to test the statistical significance of strain, region, and locus effects on expression levels,
we used two-factor linear regression models. Note that we
had independent replicate observations on five mouse brain
regions across six mouse strains for a total of 61 observations
on the approximately 45,000 probe sets represented on the
microarray (the bnst for C3H/HeJ was performed in triplicate). Let yi,j,k be the expression value of the ith replicate (I =
1, 2 ...) on the jth strain (j = 1 ... 6) for the kth brain region (k
= 1 ... 5). A linear model for the expression values can be written as follows:
yi,j,k = b0 + bs(1)xi,j,k(s1) + bs(2)xi,j,k(s2) + bs(3)xi,j,k(s3) +
bs(4)xi,j,k(s4) + bs(5)xi,j,k(s5) + br(1)xi,j,k(r1) + br(2)xi,j,k(r2) +

⎡
⎤
br(3)xi,j,k(r3) + br(4)xi,j,k(r4) + ⎢ ∑ bs ,r (δ s ,r ) ⎥ + ei,j,k
⎢ s ,r
⎥
⎣
⎦
where b0 is an intercept term, bs(h) is the regression coefficient
associated with the effect of the hth strain, br(g) is the regression coefficient associated with the effect of the gth brain
region, and ei,j,k is an error term. The xi,j,k(sh) and xi,j,k(rg) are
indicator variables set to 1 if the ijkth observation is from
strain h and/or region g, respectively, and 0 otherwise. Note
that we test only five strain and four region terms because of
redundancy in adding the sixth strain and fifth region in the
model.
Tests of significance of the strain and region effects involve
the hypothesis that the relevant regression coefficient departs
from 0.0. Tests of more global hypotheses of any strain and/
or region effects can be constructed by fitting reduced models
that do not include the strain (or region) terms and comparing these reduced models with the 'full' model described
above. These global tests involved five and four degrees of
freedom for the strain and region effect tests, respectively. We
assessed the significance of the difference between the
reduced and full models using permutation tests assuming 99
data permutations (with lowest possible P = 0.01). Data were
permuted across brain region and strain to determine accu-

rate P values for the main effects of brain region and strain.
To obtain accurate P values for the interaction terms, the
residuals must be permuted, which was not done because of
increased computational time and complexity. Instead, the F
statistics from the resulting regression model were used to
calculate P values for the cumulative f distribution; these P
values were also calculated for the strain and brain region
effects and used in the false discovery rate calculations to calculate the q values.

thesis that similarity in global gene expression patterns do
not necessarily correlate with strain DNA sequence similarity,
and hence is not meant to unequivocally or definitively identify variations that influence gene expression. It is in this context that we consider what we would expect to observe for our
eQTL analyses if no relationship exists between mouse strain
and brain region gene expression and the genetic variations
the strains possess throughout the genome. To test the association of each locus to each probe set, we used the regression
model described above, using the P value associated with the
hypothesis that the regression coefficient, bl, was equal to 0 in
a one degree of freedom t-test (no permutation tests were
pursued). We make some simplifying assumptions in our calculations given the difficulty in accounting for correlations
between the expression levels of the genes and the haplotype
block patterns encompassing the SNPs we examined across
the genome.

Polymorphism prediction

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R25

information

Candidate genes harboring predicted polymorphisms were
identified using an algorithm developed by our laboratory
(Greenhall and coworkers, unpublished data). Briefly, the
algorithm works as follows. First, for the selected probe sets,
the individual hybridization intensity values are extracted
and the difference between the perfect match and the mismatch (PM-MM) intensities is calculated for each probe pair
for each sample, excluding probe sets from samples that do
not meet certain pattern quality measures. The PM-MM values for each of the probe sets for each sample are globally
scaled (by a factor derived from the standard deviation across
the multi-probe pattern obtained in each experiment) to compensate for gene expression differences. Next, the scaled values for each sample group are averaged across the strain, and
an average and a standard deviation are calculated for each
probe pair in a probe set. The appropriate degrees of freedom

interactions

We note that our analysis of cis-acting and trans-acting
eQTLs was simply meant to complement the single degree-offreedom similarity matrix-based Mantel tests of the hypo-

refereed research

eQTL analysis was performed using an in-house software
program written in standard FORTRAN for Unix in which an
F statistic from a regression model was used at each marker
loci to test for an association. A two-factor regression model
was used, similar to the previous analysis. Results were sorted
and analyzed in a separate in-house C++ program. A marker
was considered to be cis-acting if it was within 4 Mb of the
start or end position of the gene of interest. Windows of 5 Mb
and 2 Mb windows yielded similar results. The genomic start
and end positions of a gene corresponding to the probe set
was determined using the Entrez Gene IDs from the Affymetrix database, NetAffx [19]. Both the probe set positions and
the SNP marker positions were aligned to NCBI Build 34
(Additional data files 4 and 5).

We note that we tested 8,680 loci (ignoring monomorphic
and missing SNP information; see attached SNP data in Additional data file 4) for 22,048 probe sets in our eQTL analysis,
for a total of 191,376,640 tests of association. We set a P value
threshold of 0.001 to delineate loci worth considering as harboring cis-acting or trans-acting variations. We would thus
expect 191,376 of these tests to produce P < 0.001 by chance
alone if the expression values were independent of each other
as well as the relationships between the strains with respect to
regulatory variations in their genomes. We observed
3,225,220 associations with P < 0.001, which is much higher
than expected. For the analysis of cis-acting eQTLs we note
that we included SNPs within 4 Mb of each gene represented
by a probe set as being located near enough to the gene to
count as possibly cis-acting, and, on average, there were 29
SNPs within 4 Mb of each gene. We would expect that 640
tests (29 SNPs × 22,048 probe sets × 0.001 [P value cutoff])
would be needed to produce P < 0.001 by chance alone. We
observed 2,955 probe sets with P < 0.001 for SNPs within 4
Mb of the physical positions of the probe sets.

deposited research

Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated using Excel.
The formula used to transform correlations into distances is
√(2 × [1 - R]), where R is the correlation coefficient. Mantel's
matrix correspondence test was performed with 999 permutations and calculated using GenAlEx 6 [18].

reports

Note that, for the interaction terms, δs,r, the summation is
over all combinations of individual brain regions and strains,
such that the δs,r simply reflect the product of relevant strain
and brain region 0-1 dummy variables. This formulation of
interaction terms in regression models is standard in regression contexts. With our regression model, we could have
tested each individual regression coefficient in the model for
its deviation from 0.0 and hence been able to draw inferences
about which brain regions or strains were most likely to deviate from the others in terms of expression level. However,
although we included interaction terms in the full model, we
chose not to focus on them because of potential overfitting
and an insufficient number of observations. In order to identify interactions properly, we utilized a two-way ANOVA calculated using the 'anovan' function in Matlab, in which the
least correlated unbalanced sample was removed. To test
hypotheses on individual locus effects, we replaced the strain
terms in the full model with a single locus effect (regression
coefficient) term, bl, and an indicator variable, xi,j,k(l), set to 1
if observation i,j,k has a particular allele at locus l and 0
otherwise.

are calculated and the two-tailed Student's t-test (unpaired,
equal variance) is derived for each probe pair for each strain
comparison. The algorithm was written in C++ and runs on
standard UNIX machines. The algorithm has been previously
used and validated to identify sequence variation between
inbred mouse strains [20] and between human, chimpanzee,
and rhesus macaque [21]. The algorithm is in principle similar to two previously reported methods [14,22].
