Abstract
Background: Actin is a cytoskeletal protein which exerts a broad range of functions in almost all
eukaryotic cells. In higher vertebrates, six primary actin isoforms can be distinguished: alphaskeletal, alpha-cardiac, alpha-smooth muscle, gamma-smooth muscle, beta-cytoplasmic and gammacytoplasmic isoactin. Expression of these actin isoforms during vertebrate development is highly
regulated in a temporal and tissue-specific manner, but the mechanisms and the specific differences
are currently not well understood. All members of the actin multigene family are highly conserved,
suggesting that there is a high selective pressure on these proteins.
Results: We present here a model for the evolution of the genomic organization of alpha-skeletal
actin and by molecular modeling, illustrate the structural differences of actin proteins of different
phyla. We further describe and compare alpha-skeletal actin expression in two developmental
stages of five vertebrate species (mouse, chicken, snake, salamander and fish). Our findings confirm
that alpha-skeletal actin is expressed in skeletal muscle and in the heart of all five species. In
addition, we identify many novel non-muscular expression domains including several in the central
nervous system.
Conclusion: Our results show that the high sequence homology of alpha-skeletal actins is
reflected by similarities of their 3 dimensional protein structures, as well as by conserved gene
expression patterns during vertebrate development. Nonetheless, we find here important
differences in 3D structures, in gene architectures and identify novel expression domains for this
structural and functional important gene.

Background
The actin multigene family
Actin is a cytoskeletal protein that is ubiquitously
expressed in many eukaryotic cells. Examples for actin
functions include maintenance of the cytoskeleton, cell
motility and muscle contraction. Several studies have further shown the importance of actin in a number of cellular processes, e.g. gene transcription and chromosome

morphology [1], control of the cell cycle [2], modulation
of a variety of membrane responses [3,4], translation of
several mRNA species [5,6] and modulation of enzyme
activity and localization within the cell [7-11].
Six primary actin isoforms have been identified in higher
vertebrates, being alpha-skeletal (ACTA1), alpha-cardiac
(ACTC1), alpha-smooth muscle (ACTA2), gammaPage 1 of 12

smooth muscle (ACTG2), beta-cytoplasmic (ACTB) and
gamma-cytoplasmic isoactin (ACTG1) [12] (Additonal
file 2). Actins can be classified in three pairs: two isoforms
expressed in striated muscle (skeletal and cardiac tissue),
two isoforms from smooth muscle (alpha-smooth muscle
predominately in vascular tissue and γ-smooth muscle in
the gastrointestinal and genital tracts) and two cytoplasmic isoforms [13]. Later studies have reported additional
actin isoforms in higher vertebrates [14-16].
The evolution of the actin multigene family
Cytoplasmic actins in vertebrates resemble actins present
in various amoebas, yeast and slime molds [17-21]. Invertebrate muscle actins are more closely related to vertebrate
cytoplasmic actins than to vertebrate muscle actin isoforms [22]. Actin isoforms specific for striated muscle tissue first evolved in primitive chordates [22]. Urochordates
and lampreys still express an alpha-cardiac-like isoform in
their primitive muscles. At the level of early amphibians
or stem reptiles this gene probably duplicated, which
resulted in an alpha-skeletal and a modern alpha-cardiac
isoactin [22]. The smooth muscle isoactins are believed to
have evolved during later development of warm-blooded
vertebrates [23] and likely originated from an early skeletal muscle actin [22]. Altogether, over 30 different actins
have been characterized from various muscle sources,
some of them having a very specialized role [24].

The actin multigene family is highly conserved. The
sequences of alpha-skeletal and alpha-cardiac actin differ
by only four amino acids over a total of 375 residues in
cow [13,25]. This is among the highest conservation
found in vertebrate actins [26]. Skeletal alpha-actin differs
eight amino acids from the alpha-smooth muscle isoform
and six amino acids from the γ-smooth muscle isoform in
Bos taurus. In comparison to the non-muscle actin isoforms, 24 and 25 differences in the amino acid sequence
are found for γ- and β-cytoplasmic actin respectively [13].
These differences are mainly located at the amino terminus of the protein [13]. Being the site of most actinmyosin interactions, it has an important role in cytoarchitecture and other protein-protein interactions.
The high sequence conservation between the two striated
muscle isoactins is also apparent in their gene structures.
Skeletal alpha-actin and alpha-cardiac actin are interrupted by five introns on corresponding locations
[23,27,28]. Even non-coding regions show striking similarity between the two genes and between different species
[23,29]. Two large segments that constitute most of the 3'
untranslated regions (UTR) show a similarity of 92% and
85% between the human and the rat alpha-skeletal actin
gene [30]. On average, sequences of rat/human gene pairs
show only 37–45% similarity in the 3' UTR. Based on the
early separation of the two genes, this high similarity indi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/166

cates a high selective pressure to conserve the sequence.
These conserved UTR's may affect the stability, translational capacity and the intracellular location of the transcripts, thereby further regulating the expression of the
protein.
The expression of actin isoforms
The expression of the different actin isoforms is developmentally regulated in a temporal and tissue-specific manner. In general, the cytoplasmic actins are ubiquitously
expressed in all cell types and throughout development.
The other two pairs of actin isoforms have been shown to
be expressed in striated (cardiac and skeletal actin) and
smooth muscle (two isoforms of smooth muscle actin)
[13,31].

Earlier studies showed that the striated and smooth muscle pairs are coexpressed during development [32,33].
This coexpression is not very surprising, since there is also
a high conservation in the regulatory sequences of these
genes [34].
Cardiac alpha-actin, which is the main actin isoform in
the adult heart, has also been shown to be the predominant form in early muscle development (in mouse,
human and most cultured cell lines) [33,35,36]. It has
been hypothesized that this coordinated co-expression
occurs to facilitate rapid accumulation of these proteins
[37]. In later development the expression of alpha-cardiac
actin is downregulated and alpha-skeletal actin becomes
the dominant isoform in the adult tissue, accounting for
more than 95% of the total striated muscle actin isoforms
[30,37-39].
Skeletal alpha-actin is also expressed in the mammalian
heart tissue [30,40]. During the late stage of fetal development alpha-cardiac actin becomes the main isoform, but
alpha-skeletal actin might still make up for almost half of
the total striated muscle actin content [32]. Similar results
have been shown in the chicken heart [41]. In somite
development of the amphibian Xenopus laevis embryos
also both alpha-skeletal and alpha-cardiac actin increase
in content in a coordinate manner [42]. However, in
amphibians there appear to be at least three distinct isoforms expressed in striated muscle[43,44] and only one
isoform expressed in smooth muscle [22].
This developmental paradigm has been further complicated by studies which have demonstrated that alphasmooth muscle isoactin is also expressed during early cardiac and skeletal muscle development in a variety of
myofibroblast-like cells [34,45-48]. So far no significant
evidence has been found to answer the controversial question whether this co-expression reflects a truly regulated
expression or rather is a result from a persistent "leakage"

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/166

from the initial high expression during early myogenesis.
There might also be "leakage" because of partially
diverged regulatory elements, resulting in cross-responsiveness on cellular or environmental stimuli. Based on
the high sequence similarity and the absence of pathology
in a mutant mouse model that expresses high alpha-skeletal actin in the heart, it is hypothesized that at least these
two actin isoforms are functionally redundant [49]. The
function of these two actins is likely more related to their
differential regulation in space and time than to their protein coding information [49].
Although several studies in the past have elucidated the
specific expression pattern of alpha-skeletal actin in a
model organism, no comparison of different species has
been made so far. In this study we compare alpha-skeletal
actin expression of five vertebrate species, in at least two
distinct developmental. We identified here several novel
non-muscular expression domains of alpha-skeletal actin.
Furthermore, we compared the sequences, gene architectures and 3D protein models of several species to shed
light on the evolutionary history of alpha-skeletal actin.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis
The sequences of all known actins of selected vertebrate
species and of muscle-like actins of a number of other species, covering a broad range of evolutionary history, were
extracted from GenBank (Supplemental Table 1). For our
phylogenetic analysis, we selected alpha-skeletal actins in
several different species, or where that was not possible,
an isoform most similar to alpha-skeletal actin by direct
sequence comparison. A non-rooted tree is shown in Figure 1 and an additional phylogenetic analysis using yeast
actin 1 (ACT1) as an outgroup is shown in Supplemental
Figure 1. Invertebrate muscle actin genes cluster with
human cytoplasmic actins, as was also the case in previous
phylogenetic studies on actins [49-51]. The first muscle
actin is found in Deuterostomes, illustrated by the clustering of the sea urchin S. purpuratus with the other muscle
actins. Actins specific for striated muscle cells are first
expressed in early chordates, confirming findings in earlier studies [22]. The alpha-skeletal actins of vertebrates
group together, except for the alpha-skeletal actin of
zebrafish, which clusters with the actin of the urochordate
Ciona savignyi. In earlier studies it was already shown that
the real alpha-skeletal actins evolved in early amphibians
or stem reptiles, explaining why the zebrafish actin is not
found on the same branch as the other vertebrates [22].

Interestingly, the sequence of the urochordate C. savignyi
is closer related to the vertebrate alpha-skeletal actins than
the sequence of the branchiostoma B. belcheri. A possible
explanation might be that the used branchiostoma
sequence is not the expected alpha-skeletal actin,
although it was identified as the most homologues gene

extremely high conservation of the protein in a broad
range of species (Figure 1B). Most of the differences are

located in the N-terminus of the protein, as has already
been shown in a previous study [13]. The shading shows
the mode of conservation, the darker blocks being more
conserved. In detail black background, conserved in 100%
of sequences (8 of 8), dark grey background conserved in
more than 70% of sequences, light grey background conserved in more than 60% of sequences and white background below 60% of sequences.
We have identified here the intron-exon boundaries of the
alpha-skeletal actin genes in several vertebrates (Homo
sapiens, Mus musculus, Gallus gallus, Atractaspis microlepidota, Xenopus tropicalis, Danio rerio), chordates (Ciona
savignyi, Ciona intestinalis), nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans,Caenorhabditis briggsae), insects (Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura, Anopheles gambiae, Aedes
aegypti, Culex pipiens, Apis mellifera), plants (Arabidopsis
thaliana, Oryza sativa, Populus trichocarpa) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisia). We compare the genomic organization of these alpha-skeletal actin genes and derive an
evolutionary model for the development of their gene
architecture (Figure 2).
The yeast gene consists of one exon, which is also the case
for the studied insect actin genes. In plants and nematodes
the gene consists of four exons, but only the first exon
shares the same boundaries in these two groups. Surprisingly, the intron between the second and third exon in
plants, is located on the same site as the intron in the
Ciona species. The other exon boundaries differ from
plants and nematodes. The last exon in Ciona is split in
two separate exons in the vertebrates. The zebrafish gene
shows another split of the second exon in three separate
pieces. The gene architectures of the other vertebrate
alpha-skeletal actin genes are even more conserved. The
genes in human, mouse, chicken, snake and frog have the
same intron-exon boundaries, differing only in the length
of the untranslated regions.
In summary, we can show here that in plants, like Arabidopsis thaliana,Oryza sativa and Populus trichocarpa, 4 exons
were present. In the course of evolution some species like
the studied insect species and also yeast have lost all
introns within their alpha-skeletal actin gene. In the nematodes,Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae,
the second intron was lost and exon 2 and 3 fused. However this intron as seen in our evolutionary model in Figure 2 has been conserved from plants to higher chordates.
These results show that the genomic organization of the
alpha-skeletal actin differs significantly between species.
Molecular modeling
We modelled here the 3 dimensional protein structures of
19 different actins (see Supplemental Table 1) and show
the 6 actins for which structural differences were found

Comparison of the genomic architecture

scale) and the introns (not on scale). Colored lines were
added to indicate the boundaries of the exons. The asterisk
marks the intron that has been conserved from plants to
higher chordates, but has been lost in insects and nematodes.
We have identified the intron-exon boundaries of the alphaskeletal actin genes in several vertebrates (Homo sapiens, Mus
musculus, Gallus gallus, Atractaspis microlepidota, Xenopus tropicalis, Danio rerio), chordates (Ciona savignyi, Ciona intestinalis),
nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans, Caenorhabditis briggsae),
insects (Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura,
Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypti, Culex pipiens, Apis mellifera),
plants (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Populus trichocarpa)
and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisia). All insects show a single
exon and all vertebrates except the zebrafish (Danio rerio)
show the same exon/intron boundaries as depicted for
humans.

(Figure 3). The molecular models of all vertebrate species,
S. purpuratus, D. melanogaster and C. elegans do not show
a structural difference when compared to each other (data
not shown). Additionally, we have found no visible difference between the models of the six different human actins
(data not shown).
However, we found important structural differences
between the other species investigated (Figure 3). The
major changes between the other muscle actins in secondary structures are pointed out by arrows. These sites are
also mapped on the alignment of the primary protein
sequences (Figure 1B). The B. belcheri model shows an
additional coil in the alpha helix in subdomain 2 (yellow). This is also the case for yeast, which also shows a difference in the structure on the right in subdomain 1 [52].
In C. savignyi the beta sheets in the middle of the molecule
in subdomain 3 are a little shorter (green). In the A. thaliana model the secondary structures in subdomain 2 are
shorter (dark blue), whereas the alpha helix in subdomain
4 is longer (yellow-green). The structure in subdomain 1
[52] and the beta sheet in subdomain 3 (yellow) are also
longer. Besides, the A. thaliana protein seems to miss the

actin which could be related to them. Here, molecular
approaches (e.g. site-directed mutagenesis) or bioinformatic analysis of potential interactors for example, could
give better insights on the significance of our findings.

Not all differences in the protein model can easily be recognized in the amino acid sequence. The corresponding
regions in the alignment are highlighted by colored
arrows (Figure 1B). The ultimate configuration of the protein depends on several regions and their allosteric interactions, sometimes a change in the amino acid sequence
can have an effect on a distant part of the protein, where
the respective amino acid is actually not located. This
explains why some regions, which show differences in the
model, do not show clear differences in the alignment. At
the same time, the alignment shows less conserved
regions, which are not detectable as such in the 3D model.
The structural differences we describe here can point to
important functional differences or affect specific molecular interactions of actins. It is important to note, that the
structural models presented here, are based on predictions
and that the subtle changes in structure we observe here,
are not likely to have an influence on actins major structural functions e.g. filament assembly or myosin binding.
Further studies are necessary to delineate these structure/

Expression in mouse (Mus musculus)
In the early stage mouse embryo (E10.5) expression seems
to be present in several brain areas (Figure 4A). Also the
heart, branchial arches (maxillary, mandibular and hyoid
arch), lens, hind limb bud, forelimb bud, liver and
somites are clearly stained. The strongest staining in the
limb bud is located at the most distal part, the distal
progress zone and the apical ectodermal ridge (AER).

The mouse at stage E11.5 shows staining in the heart,
branchial arches, lens, hind limb bud, forelimb bud, liver
and somites (Figure 4B). In addition, the otic vesicle and
distinct parts of the brain (telencephalon, diencephalon,
mesencephalon, metencephalon and myelencephalon)
show staining.
Detailed pictures of the atrium are shown for the early
stage embryo (Figure 4E) and the late stage embryo (Figure 4F).

Details of the atrium are shown for the embryos of both
stages (Figure 4G, Figure 4H).
Expression in snake (Elaphe taeniura frisei)
The youngest snake embryo (24 hao) shows strong
expression in the proliferative cell layer (Figure 5A). Furthermore, various brain regions (telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon and metencephalon) and
cephalic musculature are stained. Expression in the heart,
branchial arches, nasal pituitary and somites is visible as
well. Within the heart the strongest staining is located in
the primary atrial septum.

In the older snake embryo (72 hao) the proliferative cell
layer, heart (again mainly in the ventricle), brain regions
(telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, metencephalon, myelencephalon), nasal pituitary and somites
show clear expression (Figure 5B).
Detailed pictures of the heart are shown for the two
embryos (Figure 5E, Figure 5F).
Expression in salamander (Triturus carnifex)
The youngest salamander embryo (st.26) only shows
staining in the somites (Figure 5C). In the older embryo
(st.32) (Figure 5D) there is also expression in the heart.
Pigmentation is visible throughout the embryo. This is
clearly visible in the detailed picture of the head and heart
region (Figure 5G).

are indicated by dark blue shading and the secondary structures at the C-terminus are colored red. The numbers indicate the subunits of the protein. White arrows point out the
main differences between the models. The sites of these differences are highlighted with corresponding coloring in Figure 1.
Expression in chicken (Gallus gallus)
In the early stage of the chicken embryo (HH20) the hind
limb bud and forelimb bud are strongly stained (Figure
4C). The heart, branchial arches (maxillary, mandibular
and hyoid arch), otic vesicle, nasal pituitary, lens, and
somites are also stained. In addition, parts of the brain
(telencephalon, mesencephalon and metencephalon)
show expression.

At the older stage of the chicken-embryo (HH25) there is
clear staining in the heart (stronger staining in the ventricle), branchial arches, otic vesicle, liver, forelimb bud and
hind limb bud (Figure 4D).

Expression in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
As early as the 4cell stage (Figure 6A), there is staining in
the blastomeres. In the 1 K stage the embryo shows
expression in the germinal plate (Figure 6B). At the shield
stage (Figure 6C) and the tail bud stage (Figure 6D) the
staining focuses at the area where the somites will
develop. At prim-6 (Figure 6F) there is clear expression at
the somites, at the lens and in the proliferative cell layer.
There is also some expression in the head region. A detail
from the head (Figure 6E) additionally shows staining in
the hindbrain, cerebellum, epiphysis and telencephalon.
At the prim-22 stage (Figure 1G, Figure 6H) the somites
are strongly stained. The lens and proliferative cell layer
are a bit weaker stained. Staining is also visible in the midbrain, hindbrain and heart. At the next stage, long-pec
(Figure 1I, Figure 1J) there is high expression in the
somites, heart, hindbrain, lens, proliferative cell layer,
branchial arches, cephalic musculature, midbrain, hindbrain and the midcerebral vein. The last stage, 4 dpf (Figure 1K) shows a strong staining, especially in the
branchial arches, jaw musculature, lens, midbrain, liver
and somites.

the somites. Except for the early stage salamander embryo

specifically strong in the branchial arches, which will give
rise to a number of facial muscles and muscles that are
associated with the larynx and pharynx. All current studies
in mouse or chicken have detected expression in the heart
as well but expression we show here in the zebrafish heart
has not been described before. Here, we also discover
alpha-skeletal actin expression in the liver of all species
except the salamander. Furthermore, staining in the eye,
otic vesicle, nasal pituitary and brain regions has not previously been described.
We can not entirely rule out that there was no crossreactivity of the probe with other isoactins. However, hybridization conditions were very stringent and the fact that most
other actins are expressed ubiquitously and that we do not
see ubiquitous staining, argues against this. Still, crossreactivity with cardiac actin is not ruled out by this argument but here other studies also have shown that alphaskeletal actin is weakly expressed in the vertebrate heart.

gives an overview of expression domains of alpha-skeletal
actin in several vertebrate species found in this study. In
addition we summarize in Table 1 the findings of other
studies on alpha-skeletal actin gene expression. In general,
staining is detected in regions which are bound to give rise
to skeletal muscle. This is illustrated by the strong staining
in the somites and limb buds. We also show here staining
in a number of muscles in the head and neck, which also
has been described by other studies in rodents and
zebrafish [53]. In addition we show that the expression is

In this study, we have compared the gene expression patterns of alpha-skeletal actin in five different vertebrate
species and describe several novel expression domains for
this functional and structural important gene. Because of
the high conservation of the actin multigene family, a single probe could be used for the in situ hybridization. This
proved to be a useful method when comparing expression
patterns of the alpha-skeletal actin gene in these vertebrate
species. An important question remains still, how the
expression patterns of alpha-skeletal actin and the other
actin isoforms are regulated. Here, results from experiments on differentiated, cultured cells have often differed
from in vivo studies [33]. Factors such as innervation,
growth factors and mitogens, oncogenes, cell density, hormones, mechanical and biological stress and cell-cell
interactions may all contribute to the regulation of this
multigene family [54-56].
Promoter regions of different actins have been extensively
analyzed. So far it is clear that interaction of multiple cisacting and trans-acting regulatory elements are involved
[57,58]. However, the sequences and factors that interact
with these regions and confer to positive and/or negative
transcriptional regulation are poorly understood. Additionally, a variety of post-transcriptional modifications
contribute to the regulation of actin protein expression
[59-61]. Future studies should shed more light on these
regulatory mechanisms and actin functions. Here, a comparative evolutionary analysis of regulatory elements
should help in unraveling some of the signaling pathways
and transcriptional networks responsible.

Conclusion
The phylogenetic analysis, the alignment, the comparison
of the genomic architecture and the 3D protein models we

model illustrates that the genomic organization of the
alpha-skeletal actin differs significantly between species.
Insects and yeast for example have lost all introns within
their alpha-skeletallike actin genes.

show here reveal extreme high conservation of alpha-skeletal actins. The high homology between higher vertebrate
actins and muscle-like actins in plant and yeast is striking
when looked at the evolutionary distance. Furthermore,
alpha-skeletal actin expression patterns show strong conservation in evolution and are very similar in all tested
vertebrate species. Interestingly, we find many novel
expression domains of alpha-skeletal actin including several in non-muscular tissues and organs.
Despite all observed similarities, we show here also
important structural and other differences between alphaskeletal actins of different species. Our evolutionary

Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Sequences of all known actins in human and one alphaskeletal actin isoform, or the closest found homologue in
several other species were taken from GenBank (see Additional file 1 for all accession numbers). In other vertebrate
species the alpha-skeletal actin was selected. The actins
from chordates, invertebrates, plant and yeast were
selected by using the sequence most similar to the alphaskeletal actin isoform. The sequences were manually
aligned with ClustalX [62] and subsequently processed
with Gblocks, which heuristically removes poorly conserved segments in the alignment in order to enhance the
phylogenetic signal [63]. Alignments were manually
refined in GeneDoc where necessary. However, the strong
conservation within the actin genes made this hardly necessary, except for the N-terminal start regions. Subsequently, the alignments were used to generate the
phylogenetic trees employing MrBayes [52] version 3.1.
Bayesian trees were generated with MrBayes, with amino
acid substitution set to mixed (hence reducing assumption prior to analysis). Rate variation across sites was
modeled with a four rate gamma distribution and invariant sites, while the MCMC search itself was continued for
1.000.000 generations, sampled every 100 generations,
and 2500 trees were discarded as burnin.

The sequences were also used to model the associated proteins with the automated comparative protein modeling
server, Swiss Model. A detailed description is given in one
of our previous studies [64].
Animal care and handling
Animals were handled in compliance with local animal
care regulations and standard protocols of the Netherlands. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) (Tuebingen line, AlB strain
(Albinos) were kept at 28°C in aquaria with day/night
light cycles (10 h dark versus 14 h light periods). The
developing embryos were kept in an incubator at constant
temperature of 28°C. When the required developmental
stage was reached, embryos were fixed in 4% PFA. We
used six developmental stages for zebrafish: 4cell, 1 K (3
hours post fertilization), shield (6 hpf), tail bud (9 hpf),
prim-6 (25 hpf), prim-22 (35 hpf), long-pec (48 hpf) and
4 days post fertilization (staging according to [65]). For
mouse (Mus musculus), chicken (Gallus gallus), snake (Elaphe taeniura friesei) and salamander (Triturus carnifex)
embryos two developmental stages were used for ISH. The
stages used were: E10.5 and E11.5 for mouse, HH20 and
HH25 for chicken, 24 hours after oviposition (hao) and
72 hao for snake (no official staging system is available for

HH20 and HH25 in chicken) and st.26 and st.32 for salamander (staging according to [66]). At least two specimen

All embryos were stored in 100% MeOH at -18°C for several days before the in situ hybridization was started.

In situ hybridization [7]
We used a full length probe based on the frog (Xenopus
tropicalis) alpha-skeletal actin gene [BC075427]. Based on
a number of pilot experiments, this probe proved to be
effective in locating alpha-skeletal actin in other vertebrate species as well. A sequence comparison of ACTA1,
ACTA2 and ACTC1 from different species to the Xenopus
laevis ACTA1 is shown in additional file 2.

The in situ hybridization procedure in zebrafish was
adapted from the Thisse protocol [67] and has been previously described [68]. For the in situ hybridization of the
other embryos the procedure was slightly adjusted.
Depending on the size of the embryo 10–20 μg/ml Proteinase K was used. After rinsing and refixation, the embryos
were prehybridized for 2–5 h at 70°C in hybridization
buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 1% SDS, 50 μg/ml
heparin, 500 μg/ml tRNA). With the snake embryos the
prehybridization and hybridization steps were accomplished at 67°C. After incubation in the hybridization
buffer, the embryos were washed twice in Solution I (50%
formamide, 2× SSC, 1% SDS) at 70°C, twice in Solution
II (50% formamide, 1× SSC) at 70°C and 3 times in PBST
at RT. The embryos were preabsorbed in 10% sheep serum
in PBST for 2 hours at room temperature and incubated
overnight at 4°C with a preabsorbed anti DIG antibody at
a 1/5000 dilution in the blocking. After staining of the
embryos, pictures were taken by stereomicroscopy.
