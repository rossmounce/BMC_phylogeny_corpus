Sucrose export from source organs, and its subsequent
distribution among differentiating organs in wood-forming stems and elsewhere depends on the activity of
sucrose transporters (SUTs). There are no comprehensive reports on SUT function in temperate tree species
valued for their lignocellulosic biomass. To begin to
address this gap, the SUT gene family was characterized
and functionally analyzed in transgenic P. tremula x
alba. The Populus SUT family features the three major
groups characteristic of other dicots. In general, functionally distinct SUTs fall into different phylogenetic groups.
Group-1 PtaSUT3 transcripts localize to leaf vascular
traces and stem developing xylem; Group-4 PtaSUT4 to
leaf spongy mesophyll, stem developing xylem, cambium
and phloem; Group-2 PtaSUT5/6 to all leaf cells, stem
developing xylem and phloem fibers. The SUT4 ortholog
of Populus differs from that of other model plants in
encoding a vacuolar transporter that is unusually well
expressed in source leaves compared to Group-1 and 2
SUT genes. SUT4-RNAi transgenic plants demonstrated
a shift of biomass allocation from stem to leaf in both
nitrogen (N)-replete and N-limited plants. In those
plants, sucrose exhibited a complex pattern of hyperaccumulation in exporting leaves and vascular tissues of
the stem, and decreased accrual in the shoot tip and sink
leaves. RNAi silencing of SUT4 reduced water uptake
during drought simulation without significantly affecting
overall shoot biomass accumulation.
