Abstract
Background: Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, is a globally distributed zoonotic pathogen that
continues to be a veterinary and human health problem in Central Asia. We used a database of anthrax outbreak
locations in Kazakhstan and a subset of genotyped isolates to model the geographic distribution and ecological
associations of B. anthracis in Kazakhstan. The aims of the study were to test the influence of soil variables on a
previous ecological niche based prediction of B. anthracis in Kazakhstan and to determine if a single sub-lineage of
B. anthracis occupies a unique ecological niche.
Results: The addition of soil variables to the previously developed ecological niche model did not appreciably alter
the limits of the predicted geographic or ecological distribution of B. anthracis in Kazakhstan. The A1.a experiment
predicted the sub-lineage to be present over a larger geographic area than did the outbreak based experiment
containing multiple lineages. Within the geographic area predicted to be suitable for B. anthracis by all ten best
subset models, the A1.a sub-lineage was associated with a wider range of ecological tolerances than the outbreaksoil experiment. Analysis of rule types showed that logit rules predominate in the outbreak-soil experiment and
range rules in the A1.a sub-lineage experiment. Random sub-setting of locality points suggests that models of B.
anthracis distribution may be sensitive to sample size.
Conclusions: Our analysis supports careful consideration of the taxonomic resolution of data used to create
ecological niche models. Further investigations into the environmental affinities of individual lineages and sublineages of B. anthracis will be useful in understanding the ecology of the disease at large and small scales. With
model based predictions serving as approximations of disease risk, these efforts will improve the efficacy of public
health interventions for anthrax prevention and control.

Background
Anthrax is a disease of wildlife, livestock and humans
that remains a public health problem throughout the
world. Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax,
is a soil-borne, spore-forming bacterium which persists
in soil for long periods of time under appropriate conditions [1]. Certain soil parameters, including pH, organic
content and calcium, may be associated with spore survival [1-5]. Anthrax outbreaks among livestock and
wildlife result from exposure to these spores and are
possibly influenced by climatic and physiological events
[6,7]. In endemic areas, human cases of anthrax primarily result from contact with infected livestock during

slaughter or butchering [8,9] and control of livestock
disease through vaccination and active surveillance of
livestock and wildlife is essential for preventing human
disease [10]. However, widespread active surveillance is
costly and vaccination of every animal is not feasible. It
is far more practical to focus these efforts on areas of
high risk. To identify these it is necessary to improve
our understanding of the ecology of B. anthracis
through which animal infection occurs.
The ecology of a pathogen such as B. anthracis can be
explored using similar tools as those used for species
distribution modelling and conservation planning. For
example, ecological niche modelling (ENM) has been
used to predict the potential ecological and geographic
distribution of pathogens based on outbreak locations
[10-14], presence of disease vectors [15-17] and disease

reservoirs [18]. The ecological niche of a pathogen, as
for other types of species, is conceptualized as the Ndimensional hypervolume of ecological parameters
within which the species can be maintained without
immigration [19,20]. Various approaches to ENM identify non-random associations between a species’ locality
data and environmental parameters. Ecological niche
modelling experiments of B. anthracis are particularly
useful considering the potential associations between
spore survival and ecological conditions [1,5]. Results
can be used as a proxy for disease risk and integrated
into focused surveillance strategies for wildlife and livestock in endemic areas and into vaccination strategies
that target at risk herds before and during outbreak
events [10].
Recently, studies of disease ecology have combined
molecular genotyping techniques and ecological niche
modelling to provide evidence that genetic lineages of a
pathogen can have different environmental associations
and potential geographic distributions [12,21]. In general
B. anthracis has relatively limited global diversity. However, multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) systems for B. anthracis can differentiate
strains into distinct lineages and sub-lineages [22-24].
Analyses of a global collection of B. anthracis isolates
suggests that the A lineage is globally distributed, while
other lineages (B and C) are geographically restricted.
These findings may be explained by adaptive differences,
some of which carry fitness costs that limit abundance
and distribution of certain lineages or sub-lineages
[3,24]. The ecological niche of B. anthracis has been
modelled in the United States and Kazakhstan using
locations of reported outbreaks [10,11,25,26]. A stated
limitation of these experiments was that the outbreak
data potentially included multiple strains of B. anthracis
[10,11]. If lineages of B. anthracis do exhibit niche specialization and unique geographic distributions, then it
is plausible that current outbreak based ecological niche
models are biased toward a dominant strain in a particular landscape. It would then follow that single lineage
models may better predict presence of the pathogen at
local scales and increase the value of public health measures [10].
Kazakhstan is situated in Central Asia, a region with
some of the highest reported human anthrax incidence
and mortality rates in the world [27,28]. The majority of
human anthrax cases in Kazakhstan are related to exposure to infected livestock or handling of products
derived from infected livestock [9]. In rural areas of
Kazakhstan, veterinary care and surveillance programs
are limited by the country’s large land mass and widely
distributed rural populations. Vaccination of livestock
occurs mainly in response to detected outbreaks. In
countries such as Kazakhstan, prioritizing areas for

vaccination and surveillance are necessary for disease
control. Our group recently created a multi-variate ecological niche model to characterize the broad environmental conditions that support B. anthracis across
Kazakhstan [11,26]. In a parallel effort, Aikimbayev et al.
used an eight marker MLVA typing system (MLVA-8)
to describe the diversity of B. anthracis within Kazakhstan from 88 archival strains [22,29].
In this study, we first expanded on the previously published outbreak based modelling experiment by adding
four soil variables (pH, calcium levels, organic content
and baseline water saturation) to the original set of
environmental variables. Despite literature suggesting a
strong relationship between soil characteristics such as
high calcium levels and alkaline pH and spore persistence [1,4,5], the influence of available soil variables on
B. anthracis ENM predictions has not been comparatively examined [10]. We next used these twelve environmental variables and the collection of MLVA-8
genotyped samples to create an A1.a sub-lineage specific
ecological niche model for Kazakhstan.

Results
Accuracy Metrics

Ecological niche modelling was performed using the
Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). Four
experiments were run (outbreak-soil, A1.a sub-lineage,
small southern outbreak and large southern outbreak)
and are summarized in Table 1. All modelling processes
reached convergence of accuracy (0.01) prior to reaching
the maximum iteration setting (= 1,000). The outbreaksoil model had an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of
0.7188 and was significantly different from a random
model. Total omission of the outbreak-soil model was
2.6% and average omission was 9.9%, indicating that
97.4% of the testing points were predicted by at least
one best subset model and 89.1% were predicted by all
models. The AUC of the A1.a sub-lineage model was
0.6964 and was also significantly different from a random model and had a total and average omission of 0
and 13.1, respectively. Both the large and small outbreak
models had AUCs significantly different than random.
Accuracy metrics for all models are shown in Table 2.
Predicted Distributions of B. anthracis

Locations used for input into GARP are shown in Figure
1. Based on areas of agreement of a minimum of six of
the best subset models, the outbreak-soil experiment
predicted B. anthracis across much of northern Kazakhstan and in a narrow band of the southeast. The interior
of the country, which is primarily arid, was not predicted to be suitable for the pathogen. The results are
similar to those of the experiment without the soil variables with respect to the geographic extent of areas of

six or more best subset model agreement (Figure 2).
The outbreak-soil experiment expanded two areas in the
north which had lower model agreement. The A1.a sublineage experiment predicts a more extensive geographic
distribution than that of the outbreak experiment,
including areas in the northern interior and western
portions of the country (Figure 3). The northern pockets
of less suitable geographic areas seen in the outbreaksoil experiment were predicted to be unsuitable based
on agreement of six or more best subset models. The
overall extents of the geographic predictions of the two
experiments were more similar in the south than in the
north. The large and small southern outbreak experiments both predicted similar geographic extents as the
outbreak-soil experiment (Figure 4). All three projected
experiments (A1.a sub-lineage, large southern outbreak
and small southern outbreak) were run ten additional
times using random external data splits. The subsets of
A1.a sub-lineage and small southern outbreak experiments showed greater degrees of spatial heterogeneity
than did the large southern outbreak experiment set.
(see Additional File 1: Random Subsets for illustration,
available as a PDF file, and Additional File 2: Accuracy
metrics for random subsets, available as a PDF file).
Each GARP model is composed of 50 if-then type rules
(logic, range, negated range and atomic) which predict the
presence or absence of the species for each pixel. Rule
types for the ten best subset models from the outbreak-

soil and A1.a sub-lineage experiments were extracted and
are summarized in Table 3. Just over half of the outbreaksoil experiment rules were logit and no atomic rules were
included, whereas range rules made up over 60% of the
A1.a sub-lineage experiment rule types and this experiment included four atomic rules in the best subsets.
Between 6 and 13 rules defined greater than 90% of areas
predicted to be suitable for B. anthracis for each of the
best subsets. Of the 95 rules which predicted the majority
of the landscape in the outbreak-soil experiment, the
majority (83%) were presence rules and of these 62% were
range rules. The A1.a sub-lineage experiment had 99 total
rules predict the majority of the landscape; all but one of
these was a presence rule and 73% of the presence rules
were range rules. The environmental tolerances described
by the dominant rules suggest that mean NDVI, altitude,
mean temperature, minimum soil calcium and minimum
soil organic content are limiting variables for B. anthracis
in Kazakhstan (Figure 5). Median minimum values of
mean NDVI, NDVI amplitude, annual precipitation, dry
month precipitation, wet month precipitation, mean temperature, altitude and soil organic content are significantly
different between the A1.a sub-lineage and the outbreaksoil experiment using the Wilcox-Mann-Whitney test at a
95% significance level. Median maximum values of NDVI
amplitude, mean temperature, dry month precipitation,
altitude, soil base saturation and soil organic content differ
between the two experiments.

full outbreak model. Green points indicate training data for input into GARP and yellow points indicate independent points used to evaluate
model accuracy. Shaded area indicates southern polygon used for creating projected models.

Values of the limiting variables were extracted from
areas of ten best subset model agreement and plotted in
two dimensional variable space. The A1.a sub-lineage
experiment showed a broader ecological envelope than
the outbreak-soil experiment based on areas of ten best
subset model agreement, despite the smaller geographic
area predicted by agreement of all ten models (Figure
6). The two A4 locations, which are distant from each
other geographically, are found within a narrow range of
mean NDVI and mean temperature, but occupy nearly
opposite ends of the range of precipitation values.
Finally, the A3.b location was associated with ecological
conditions towards the outer boundaries of the ecological envelope predicted by the outbreak-soil experiment.

Discussion
This study assesses the addition of soil variables to a
previously developed ecological niche model for Bacillus
anthracis and is the first known to model the ecological
and geographic distribution of a single sub-lineage of B.
anthracis. Inclusion of available soil variables into our

anthrax outbreak model resulted in subtle changes in
the likelihood of the pathogen in areas of northern
Kazakhstan, but did not substantially change the extent
of geographic predictions or results of rule set analyses
[26]. The areas predicted as less suitable by the outbreak-soil model correspond to regions of locally different values for all four soil variables (see Additional File
3: Soil Variables, available as a PDF document). However, it is not known whether these areas represent a
unique ecological region or if measurement in these
areas was affected by error or bias. The low minimum
soil calcium association found in the rule set analyses
contrasts with previous literature suggesting that B.
anthracis spore persistence is associated with high soil
calcium levels [3,30]. The results of our rule set analysis,
however, are not directly comparable to previous work
in that different units of measurement and sampling
techniques were used. In addition, the soils data available for this study had a relatively coarse resolution of 1
km and were further aggregated to 8 km to match other
climatic data for model development. As a result, fine

resolution relationships between soil and anthrax occurrences would likely be missed in this experiment.
Improved resolution of soil and outbreak data, such as
exact carcass locations, are likely necessary to characterize the role of soil parameters in promoting anthrax

spore persistence [3,31] and for better understanding
the spatio-temporal dynamics and ecology of local outbreaks [32].
The A1.a sub-lineage experiment predicted a more
extensive geographic area of anthrax presence than did

the northern and central portions of the country. The
median minimum values of most variables defined by
the dominant rule sets were significantly different.
When ecological values of limiting variables were
extracted from geographic areas of best subset

ecological envelope than the outbreak-soil data. This
finding illustrates that analysis of dominant rule sets
alone should be interpreted with some caution. The

summarize approximately only one-fifth (or fewer) of
the total number of rules generated by GARP in the ten
best subsets. The values extracted from predicted areas
on the landscape are derived from all 500 rules contained in the 10 best subsests and represent the spectrum of complex interactions between variables and the
landscape. Because geographic areas of model agreement
can be thought of as representative of all sub-sampled
regions or populations [33], the finding of a larger ecological envelope for the A1.a sub-lineage experiment
lends support to the hypothesis that the A1.a sub-

lineage of B. anthracis may have broad environmental
tolerances that influence its broad geographic distribution [3,24].
The A lineage is more widely distributed globally than
other subtypes, perhaps reflecting a greater level of fitness as compared to other lineages [24]. This finding
has been shown on a local scale as well. Isolates of the
A lineage in Kruger National Park, South Africa, as
defined by MLVA-8 typing, were more diffusely distributed and showed a distinctly different spatial cluster pattern than those of the B lineage. Furthermore, the B

Mullins et al. BMC Ecology 2011, 11:32
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/11/32

lineage isolates occupied a narrow range of available
ecological conditions within those occupied by the A
lineage isolates [3]. In the experiments reported here,
the A1.a sub-lineage locations were associated with
lower pH values than the outbreak locations and this
could provisionally support the findings from Kruger
National Park [3]. It follows that that a B. anthracis lineage and/or sub-lineage other than A1.a may predominate in the northern regions of Kazakhstan and is
driving the narrower geographic and ecological prediction of the outbreak-soil experiment. Genotyping of
additional isolates from northern Kazakhstan is necessary to evaluate this hypothesis. Locations of outbreaks
of the A4 lineage in geographical and ecological space
suggests that this genotype may also have a relatively
broad distribution, which is consistent with the A4 sublineage being found across the Middle East and China
[29,34]. Although we cannot make inferences regarding
the environmental affinities of the single A3.b isolate,
we note it is located on the far eastern border of
Kazakhstan in an area predicted to be unsuitable for
anthrax by the outbreak-soil experiment. The A3.b sublineage has been isolated from geographically limited
areas, most notably northern China and Texas, and the
presence of this genotype is likely a result of historical
trade routes [24,34,35].
The genetic diversity of B. anthracis isolates in southern Kazakhstan is not surprising given the location of
this area along the historic Silk Road [29], but this
diversity also implies that this region is supportive of
spore persistence. Associations between genotypes of B.
anthracis, environment, virulence or host species have
not yet been fully explored and it is unknown whether
genotype influences epidemiological characteristics of
outbreaks. Understanding these relationships will
improve our understanding of anthrax disease ecology,
help focus surveillance and efficiently direct proactive
vaccination. Furthermore, this knowledge can help distinguish between naturally occurring outbreaks, contamination and potential bioterrorism, and greatly enhance
epidemiological trace back (tracing outbreaks to source)
efforts during outbreaks.
Few studies using GARP have quantified and examined rule types. GARP begins creating rule sets by
choosing the first rule type at random and successful
rules are carried forward into subsequent rule sets.
Thus, the first rule type chosen at random will often
predominate in the final rule sets. Blackburn and Joyner
et. al. both presented summaries and distribution of the
dominant rule types predicting B. anthracis in the continental United States and Kazakhstan, respectively
[26,32]. Blackburn noted a predominance of range rules
among a total of 63 rules predicting greater than 90% of
the landscape [32]. Joyner et al divided Kazakhstan into

Page 10 of 14

northern and southern halves and modelled the two sections separately [11]. A greater percentage of range rules
described the northern half of the country, whereas logit
rules predominantly described the southern half of the
country. Here, logit rules dominated in the out-break
soil experiment and range rules in the A1.a sub-lineage
experiment. Further work is required to tease out
whether dominant rule types result from the stochastic
nature of GARP or are related to complex interactions
between the organism and environmental variables.
Additional future work should also explore how rule
sets and ecological values found over predicted areas of
the landscape can be used to enhance our understanding of the ecology of an organism.
Several authors have noted that ENM-based predictions of species with widespread distributions show
reduced model accuracy which can be improved by
dividing species or the range into sub-units [33,36-39].
One explanation for the apparent poor accuracy of
models of widespread species is the use of AUC. The
AUC is sensitive to the area predicted to be suitable for
a species relative to the total land area analyzed [33,40].
Other considerations include non-uniformity of presence locations (geographical bias), and biological factors such as local ecological adaptations and genetic
diversity [33,37-39]. For example, modelling of Francisella tularensis genotypes in the US yielded overlapping,
yet different, geographic predictions and ecological associations [12]. Interestingly, this difference was apparent
at intermediate, as opposed to coarse, phylogenetic
levels. Similarly, Fisher et. al. showed that three genotype categories of the broadly distributed pathogenic
fungus Penicillium marneffei correlated with environmental heterogeneity across Vietnam [21]. Using GARP,
the genotypes classes were predicted to occupy three
non-overlapping geographic areas. As a consequence of
B. anthracis being a widely distributed species, models
of anthrax outbreaks are subject to similar limitations in
accuracy. Genotype specific models may therefore have
improved accuracy and predictive power, and should be
explored at multiple phylogenetic levels.
It is worthwhile to evaluate modelling limitations
which could potentially explain differences between
experiments. Despite studies showing GARP to be
robust when predicting new landscapes [14,25,41], our
use of a projected modelling strategy may wrongly predict geographic and ecological distribution given the
large geographic area in question. However, projected
models created using southern outbreak points show
similar geographic predictions as the outbreak-soil
experiment, supporting that the broader geographic A1.
a sub-lineage prediction is not simply an artefact of the
modelling technique. That the large and small southern
outbreak experiments showed a lesser degree of model

Mullins et al. BMC Ecology 2011, 11:32
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/11/32

agreement than the outbreak-soil experiment and that
the large outbreak subsetting procedure had improved
spatial homogeneity over the small southern outbreaks
subsetting indicates that projected models may be sensitive to issues of sample size and clustering. Issues relating to sample size appear to be important in our study.
The predicted geographic distribution of B. anthracis
varied among the 10 random data splits for both the Al.
a sub-lineage and small southern outbreak experiments.
In contrast, the same random data splitting procedure
performed with the large southern outbreak and the
outbreak-soil experiments showed spatial homogeneity
among models [26]. Although Stockwell and Peterson
and Hernandez found that as few as 10 presence points
are adequate for accurate GARP models [36,39], additional work has shown that certain species or geographic
scenarios are more sensitive to sample size than others
and that model accuracy can be sensitive to both sample
size and extent of the species’ range [42]. Here, any
effect of sample size is likely exaggerated by projection
onto a large geographic area and the relatively limited
resolution the data [36,42].
Some additional limitations apply to our findings. The
A1.a sub-lineage isolate collection was derived from multiple species, including livestock and humans, and from
soil samples. The outbreak data, however, were derived
from livestock only. The impact of this on model comparisons is unknown since associations between host,
genotype and environment are as yet unexplored. We are
limiting our modelled area by political boundaries as
opposed to biogeographic limits. Finally, the genotyped
isolate collection is geographically biased towards the
southeast portion of Kazakhstan and spans a relatively
long period of time [29]. Sampling bias is common in
niche models using historical collections and can create
artificial patterns in the data, although GARP is arguably
less sensitive than other modelling algorithms to spatial
bias [10,37,43,44]. Future genotyping of additional isolates from under-sampled portions of the country, particularly the northern oblasts, will be essential to better
characterize the genetic diversity and ecology of anthrax
in Kazakhstan, allowing the construction of more refined
predictive models.

Conclusions
The inclusion of available soil variables resulted in
subtle changes in the predicted geographic distribution
of anthrax in Kazakhstan, but the experiment is limited
by the nature of available soil variables. Standardized
soil variables and finer resolution data will be essential
to characterizing the importance of soil parameters in B.
anthracis persistence. The A1.a sub-lineage experiment
showed a larger geographic and ecological distribution
than the outbreak based experiment. Understanding

genetic-environmental associations will be essential to
accurate modelling of anthrax for use in disease prevention and control in Kazakhstan

Methods
Anthrax occurrence data

Presence points for outbreak-based models were taken
from the database created by Joyner et.al. [26]. Briefly,
historical records were used to construct a database of
3,947 anthrax outbreaks reported in Kazakhstan between
1937 and 2006. The data were sequentially filtered to
create a dataset containing the latitude and longitude of
outbreaks in cattle, sheep and goats which occurred
between 1960 and 2000. This time period reflects the
implementation of mass vaccination and corresponds to
the averaged data from both the WorldClim and soils
data sets [45,46]. The final dataset contained 258 spatially unique points, meaning that only one outbreak
point occurred in each 8 km2 pixel. An 8 km2 resolution
was chosen because outbreaks were mapped to the nearest village and some outbreaks occurred greater than 1
km from the village coordinates. This data set is hereafter referred to as the full outbreak dataset.
A second dataset was constructed using outbreak isolates genotyped by Aikimbayev et.al. [29]. Isolates were
grouped into the A1.a (n = 78), A3.b (n = 6) and A4 (n
= 4) sub-lineages using unweighted pair group method
with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) cluster analysis and the
89 B. anthracis genotypes identified by Keim et.al. [22].
This was filtered to contain only spatially unique points
at a resolution of 8 km2 resulting in 42 spatially unique
points, of which 39 were A1.a, two were A4 and 1 was
A3 b. Locality data are mapped in Figure 1. Only the
A1.a sub-lineage had an adequate number of spatially
unique points for modelling. The A1.a locations were
geographically biased towards the south-eastern portion
of the country. To reduce the problem of largely
unsampled areas being considered as absence points, we
created a polygon encompassing southeast Kazakhstan
using latitude 48 N and 60 E as the northern and western boundaries, respectively, and the country’s political
boundaries in the south and east. The boundaries of this
southern polygon were derived from examination of the
locations of the A1.a isolates and from the different
northern and southern ecological associations noted by
Joyner [26]. The southern polygon was used to clip the
A1.a locality points in ArcMap and this set of southern
A1.a locations was used for the sub-lineage experiment.
The same procedure was used to create a southern outbreak dataset.
Environmental Data

We used six environmental coverages downloaded from
the WorldClim website http://www.worldclim.org[46].

Mullins et al. BMC Ecology 2011, 11:32
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/11/32

The WorldClim variables are calculated from interpolation of monthly temperature and precipitation measurements recorded at stations located worldwide between
1961 and 2000. Monthly values are transformed by
WorldClim into 19 bioclimatic variable grids that
describe annual trends, seasonality and potentially limiting ecological parameters such as temperature of the
coldest and warmest months. Two satellite-derived
environmental variables describing temperature and
vegetation measures were obtained from the Trypanosomiasis and Land Use in Africa (TALA) research group
(Oxford, United Kingdom) [47].
We added four soil variables to the set of eight environmental layers used in the previous study to test the
influence of soil parameters on the outbreak model. Soil
variables were derived from the Harmonized World Soil
Database and were available at 1 km2 resolution [45].
All coverages were re-sampled to 8 km2 and clipped to
the boundaries of Kazakhstan in ArcView 3.3. (Environmental Systems Research institute, Redlands, CA). An
identical set of coverages was clipped to the southern
polygon. The final set of coverages is given in Table 4.
Ecological Niche Modelling

This study used the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP) to perform the ecological niche modelling [48]. Models were developed in Desktop GARP
v.1.1.3, which gives the user the option to write out the
rule sets for each model. Briefly, GARP is a presence
only modelling technique that detects non-random associations between species localities and specific environmental variables. Through an iterative process,
relationships are expressed as a series of logic statements, or rules, of which there are four types: (1) logit based on logistic regression; (2) atomic - single value for

a given variable that predicts presence; (3) range - a
range of values of a given variable that predicts presence; and (4) negated range - a range of values outside
of which presence is predicted. Each individual GARP
model is a set of 50 rules that are randomly generated,
tested and modified. The user sets a maximum number
of models to be created in a single experiment. A best
subsets procedure within GARP then selects a set of
optimal models based on user defined omission and
commission criteria [48]. The algorithm is a two-step
process, where first relationships are defined in variable
space through a random walk and then applied to the
geographic landscape where those conditions are met
[25]. GARP therefore has the benefit of being able to
project rule sets onto the environmental layers of a different landscape and has been shown to be robust in
this application [25,41].
Model building and evaluation

To test the effect of soils on the outbreak experiment
we used the full outbreak dataset as locality points and
the twelve environmental variables described in Table 3.
The 258 spatially unique points were randomly divided
into an 85% (n = 218) training set used for model building and a 15% (n = 39) testing set for model evaluation.
The 32 southern A1.a points were divided into an 80%
(n = 26) training set and a 20% (n = 6) testing set in
order to maximize points available for testing [33,39,42].
The A1.a training set was input into GARP with the set
of environmental coverages clipped to the southern
polygon for model development. Rules from this southern A1.a experiment were projected onto the entire
landscape of Kazakhstan. In order to test the robustness
of the A1.a model projections given the relatively small
sample size and issues of transferability, two experiments using the southern outbreak data were performed. The first utilized all 142 southern outbreak
points and is referred to as the large southern outbreak
experiment. For the second, 32 points were randomly
selected from the southern outbreak dataset (small
southern outbreak experiment). For these experiments
an 85%/15% and 80%/20%, respectively, external data
split was performed and the experiments conducted as
for the sub-lineage. The four experiments are summarized in Table 4.
For all niche modelling experiments, we specified 200
models with a maximum of 1,000 iterations and a convergence limit of 0.01. The training data were input into
GARP with a 50% training/50% testing internal data partition. The best subset procedure selected the best 20
models under a 10% hard omission threshold and a 50%
commission threshold. The resulting ten best subset
models were imported in ArcGIS and summated using
the raster calculator function of the Spatial Analyst

Mullins et al. BMC Ecology 2011, 11:32
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/11/32

extension. This created a single cumulative raster file of
model agreement for B. anthracis presence ranging
from 0 (all models predict absence) to 10 (all models
predict presence). The more models that predict presence for a given pixel, the higher the likelihood that
the pixel can support B. anthracis.
Rule types from the ten best models of the outbreaksoil experiment and the A1.a sub-lineage experiment
were extracted with a python script (K.M. McNyset, US
NOAA) and summarized to illustrate the relative numbers of each rule type. Dominant rules, or the subset of
rules that together predict over 90% of the landscape,
for each model were identified. We extracted the minimum and maximum values of range rules using the
python script. When logit rules were identified, we
extracted the range of values across the pixels predicted
by that rule using the “Extract Values to Points” routine
of the Spatial Analyst extension in ArcMap. Median
minimum and maximum values for each variable were
calculated in SAS (SAS 9.2, Cary, N.C.) and plotted as a
bar graph. Differences in median and maximum values
between experiments were assessed using WilcoxonMann_Whitney test in SAS.
Predictive performance of the best subset models was
evaluated with an area under the curve (AUC) in a
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis using
the independent test data withheld from the original
datasets [40]. For the projected models, testing points
included presence points outside the southern polygon
in addition to points withheld from within the southern
polygon. Values of AUC, which range from 0.5 (no different from random) to 1 (a perfect model), are derived
from measures of sensitivity (absence of omission error)
and specificity (absence of commission error). The calculated value is compared to that of a random model
using a z-test. In addition, measures of omission and
commission were calculated using the summed ten best
subset models. Total and average omission values evaluate how well GARP predicts the presence of known
locality points not included in the model building data.
Total and average commission is the percent of pixels
predicted as presence by the summated model and the
average of this value for all ten best subset models,
respectively. Large variation between the two measures
of commission suggests substantial variation between
the proportions of the landscape predicted present by
each of the ten best subset models [33].
Environmental values of 5,000 randomly chosen points
from areas predicted by all 10 of the best subset models
were extracted using the “Extract Values to Points” routine of the Spatial Analyst extension in ArcMap. Values
of each environmental variable at each presence point
and at 5,000 random points representing the total available environmental space (background) were similarly

Page 13 of 14

extracted. Specific environmental values appearing to be
limiting factors for prediction of B. anthracis were chosen based on the rule set evaluation (Figure 5) and
visualized in 2-dimensional ecological space against the
background of available environmental conditions using
R 2.1.1 http://www.R-project.org.
