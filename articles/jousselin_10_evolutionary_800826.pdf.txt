Evolutionary lability of a complex life cycle in the
aphid genus Brachycaudus
Emmanuelle Jousselin*, Gwenaelle Genson, Armelle Coeur d’acier

Abstract
Background: Most aphid species complete their life cycle on the same set of host-plant species, but some
(heteroecious species) alternate between different hosts, migrating from primary (woody) to secondary
(herbaceous) host plants. The evolutionary processes behind the evolution of this complex life cycle have often
been debated. One widely accepted scenario is that heteroecy evolved from monoecy on woody host plants.
Several shifts towards monoecy on herbaceous plants have subsequently occurred and resulted in the radiation of
aphids. Host alternation would have persisted in some cases due to developmental constraints preventing aphids
from shifting their entire life cycle to herbaceous hosts (which are thought to be more favourable). According to
this scenario, if aphids lose their primary host during evolution they should not regain it. The genus Brachycaudus
includes species with all the types of life cycle (monoecy on woody plants, heteroecy, monoecy on herbs). We
used this genus to test hypotheses concerning the evolution of life cycles in aphids.
Results: Phylogenetic investigation and character reconstruction suggest that life cycle is evolutionary labile in the
genus. Though ancestral character states can be ambiguous depending on optimization methods, all analyses
suggest that transitions from monoecy on herbs towards heteroecy have occurred several times. Transitions from
heteroecy towards monoecy, are also likely. There have been many shifts in feeding behaviour but we found no
significant correlation between life cycle changes and changes in diet.
Conclusions: The transitions from monoecy on herbs towards heteroecy observed in this study go against a
widely accepted evolutionary scenario: aphids in the genus Brachycaudus seem to be able to recapture their
supposedly ancestral woody host. This suggests that the determinants of host alternation are probably not as
complicated as previously thought. Definitive proofs of the lability of life cycle in Brachycaudus will necessitate
investigation of these determinants. Life cycle changes, whether corresponding to the loss or acquisition of a
primary host, necessarily promote speciation, by inducing shifts of the reproductive phase on different plants. We
suggest that the evolutionary lability of life cycle may have driven speciation events in the Brachycaudus genus.

Background
Parasitic organisms, whether bacteria, viruses, fungi,
nematodes or phytophagous insects, sometimes make use
of a sequence of different hosts during their life cycle.
Such host alternation is so common among parasites that
many courses in parasitology are devoted largely to
descriptions of parasitic life cycle and the sequences of
host changes. The evolution of such complex life cycle is
puzzling in many ways. In particular, parasites displaying
host alternation may show extreme specificity and

adaptations for two very distantly related hosts with few
features in common [1]. Several questions have been
raised about the evolution of host alternation. Is host
alternation evolutionarily labile or is it a rare evolutionary
change in various phyla? Is it adaptive and, if so, what
advantages does it confer on parasites with this trait?
What effect does it have on parasite diversification? Do
complex life cycles favour the colonization of new ecological niches and enhance cladogenesis?
Such questions can be addressed in aphids (Hemiptera, Aphididae, sensu stricto [2]). Aphids and their closest relatives, the Phylloxeridae and Adelgidae, are the
only phytophagous insects, with cynipid wasps [3],
known sometimes to use two sets of host plants during

their life cycle. These species are described as “heteroecious” or as displaying “host alternation” [4]. Host alternation is found in about 10% of the 4500 described
aphid species, the other 90% of aphids using the same
group of host plants throughout their entire life cycle
(these species are described as monoecious). In most
heteroecious Aphididae species, the cycle follows a similar pattern: the eggs hatch and colonies develop parthenogenetically on their primary/winter hosts (mostly
woody hosts); the aphids then migrate to secondary/
summer hosts (mostly herbaceous plants) on which they
reproduce parthenogenetically; subsequent generations
then return to the primary hosts for sexual reproduction
and overwintering. In most cases the alternate sets of
hosts are not taxonomically related and have no obvious
ecological similarities [5]. However, life cycles involving
host alternation are thought to reflect the order in
which plant taxa were acquired as host plants by aphid
lineages. Monoecy on trees is assumed to be the ancestral state in the family [6-8], with host alternation being
acquired at the time of initial grass diversification (late
Cretaceous), followed in some cases by the loss of the
primary host tree species and monoecy on grasses
[9,10]. The evolution of the aphid life cycle, the selective
pressures driving it and its consequences for aphid
diversification have been a matter for lively debate over
many years.
Heteroecy is observed in different aphid subfamilies
and the means of returning to primary hosts depend on
the subfamily concerned, strongly suggesting that several
acquisitions of this trait have occurred in the Aphididae
[7,10,11]. The most recent phylogenetic study suggests a
minimum of two independent acquisitions of host alternation [12]. Multiple acquisitions of host alternation
have also been suggested in the aphid subfamily with
the largest number of species, the Aphidinae, as many
genera in this subfamily contain both heteroecious and
monoecious species [13,14]. It is difficult to infer the
exact number of gains and losses of heteroecy in aphids
based on current reconstructions: the phylogenies of
Aphididae, or even Aphidinae [15], are still largely unresolved, probably because aphids have undergone rapid
radiation [10,12]. The evolutionary forces driving the
evolution of this trait are also poorly understood. There
are two points of view concerning the evolution of host
alternation in aphids [7,8,16]. The first view suggests
that having two hosts is adaptive [4,17], as it allows
the optimal exploitation of the available plants. Numerous adaptive advantages have been proposed (nutrient
availability, enemy escape etc.) [7,8], but all arguments
boil down to the general idea that aphids use two sets
of hosts when this is optimal for their growth and
parthenogenetic reproduction. Another point of view is
that this trait results from developmental constraints

Page 2 of 15

affecting several aphid morphotypes [7,18]. According to
this hypothesis, the use of two hosts is not necessarily
advantageous and primary hosts are retained because of
strong phylogenetic constraints on the morph that
hatches from overwintering eggs in spring, the fundatrix.
This morph is highly adapted to the primary hosts, and
less able to switch hosts than other morphs. The oviposition preferences of the sexual morphs for the woody
host are also likely to be subject to evolutionary constraints. This would imply that the loss of the primary
host and the shift of the entire cycle to a new secondary
herbaceous host requires an escape from both these
constraints, entailing several major, simultaneous mutations [19]. This hypothesis, known as “the fundatrix specialisation hypothesis”, generates a straightforward
prediction: if aphids manage to lose their primary host
during evolution, thus escaping from the dead-end
resulting from fundatrix specialisation, then a return to
heteroecy should not occur [19]. Hence, monoecy on
herbaceous hosts, which occurs in several Aphidinae
genera, should always be a derived state. Finally, the
evolution of host alternation is also often described as
having played an important role in favouring the colonisation of new plant species and speciation in aphids.
Indeed, the acquisition of heteroecy may be followed by
a shift of all or part of the population to permanent
existence on some of the new secondary hosts and,
therefore, by speciation [10]. The species-rich genera of
the Aphidinae that are monoecious on herbaceous
plants are thought to have arisen through the loss of
their primary host, followed by extensive radiation on
their newly acquired herbaceous host [13,20].
In this study, we addressed some of the questions concerning the evolution of life cycles in aphids, by focusing
on the evolution of this trait in one genus of the Aphidinae subfamily: the genus Brachycaudus van der Goot,
1913. This genus has 43 species [2,21], 14 of which
always or sometimes spend some of their life cycle on
Prunus species [22]. There are about 5 heteroecious species associated with secondary host plants belonging to
the Asteraceae, Boraginaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Lamiaceae, Polygonaceae and Scrophulariaceae [20]. Other
species are monoecious, living either on Rosales or on
herbaceous hosts, some of which belong to the same
families as the secondary host plants of heteroecious
species [14] (see Additional file 1 for details on the biology of Brachycaudus species). Hence, this genus displays
all the types of life cycle: monoecy on a woody host,
host alternation between a woody host and herbaceous
hosts, and monoecy on herbaceous hosts. Some species
in the genus thus appear to have lost their primary
rosaceous hosts to become monoecious on more
recently acquired secondary herbaceous hosts (also
called secondary monoecy) [9,15]. We investigated this

hypothetical scenario through phylogenetic reconstruction of the genus and addressed several questions:
1) What is the ancestral life cycle state in this genus?
2) How many gains and losses of host alternation have
occurred in this genus and, once lost, has heteroecy ever
been regained? 3) What are the consequences of evolutionary changes in aphid life cycle for the association of
these insects with their host plants?
We expand on our previous phylogenetic studies of
the genus [23,24], by adding several extra species and
specimens to our sampling. We have also added a
nuclear DNA fragment, to improve phylogenetic resolution. Our previous studies showed that some of the species of the genus Brachycaudus had been ambiguously
defined. Some specimens identified as belonging to the
same species failed to cluster as a clade and formed
polytomies with specimens belonging to very closely
related species but defined as having a different life
cycle and/or host range. Our objective here was to infer
the evolutionary history of life cycle and host association. We therefore ensured that inferences concerning
the number of evolutionary transitions in these characters were as conservative as possible, by applying a
DNA-based species delimitation method to our dataset.
This made it possible to define species independently of
the ecological traits we wanted to study.

Results
Phylogenetic reconstructions

We obtained a well resolved phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1), in
which most of the nodes were supported by high ML
bootstrap and pp values. The phylogenetic relationships
obtained here were very similar to those reported previously [23,24], and the addition of a nuclear marker confirmed the previously reported phylogenetic relationships
between the species sampled. Two additional species
from Central Asia, Brachycaudus pilosus (Mordvilko,
1929) and Brachycaudus cerasicola (Mordvilko, 1929),
not included in previous reconstructions, clustered
together with relatively long branches as a sister group to
the species of the subgenus Acaudus. However, support
for this branch was poor, suggesting possible long branch
attraction [25].
Species delimitation

Our sampling initially comprised 29 recognised Brachycaudus species identified on the basis of classical
taxonomy and three unidentified specimens. For the
Brachycaudus ultrametric tree obtained with Multidivtime, the GMYC model was preferred over the null
model of uniform branching patterns (2ΔL = 19.67,
c2 test P << 0.0001). This species delimitation method
retrieved 27 phylogenetic species of Brachycaudus
(Fig. 2). Most species recognized by classical taxonomy

Page 3 of 15

were retrieved by our method. However, this method
also clustered several species together. B. lateralis
(Walker, 1848) and B. cardui (Linnaeus, 1758) specimens were grouped together as a single entity. This
suggests that B. lateralis and B. cardui do not form
the two species generally defined – one mostly anholocyclic (without a sexual phase) on Asteraceae and the
other alternating between Prunus and plants from several different families (mostly Asteraceae and Boraginaceae) – but instead form a single species displaying
host alternation between Prunus and several plant
families. B. lateralis is indeed sometimes treated as a
subspecies of B. cardui. All species of the subgenus
Appelia other than B. cerinthis also clustered together,
even if several specimens from central Asia were
included. Brachycaudus (Acaudus) spp. associated with
Caryophyllaceae, except B. divaricatae (Shaposhnikov,
1956) and B. klugkisti (Börner, 1942), also formed a
single genetic cluster. Specimens identified as B. lami
(Koch, 1854) and B. ballotae (Passerini, 1860) were
also identified as belonging to a single species. These
clustering patterns confirmed our previous findings,
based on less extensive specimen and species sampling
and fewer DNA markers [23]. The clusters obtained all
corresponded to groups of species in which species
identification can be difficult and specimens may be
assigned to species on the basis of host affiliation or
morphological characters subject to intraspecific variation. However, this method detected two clusters
within B. helichrysi (Kaltenbach, 1843) and two clusters among the Thuleaphis specimens collected in
Kazakhstan that we failed to identify. Two of the Thuleaphis specimens collected on Atraphaxis sp. formed
a phylogenetic cluster, and one specimen collected on
a Rheum sp. but morphologically different from B.
rumexicolens (Patch, 19717) appeared as a separate,
differentiated taxon. These two phylogenetic species
may correspond to the two new Thuleaphis species
reported by Kadyrbekov [26,27].
Character evolution

Ancestral state reconstruction by MP, ML and stochastic mapping are summarised in Fig. 3 and 4 and
Tables 1-2-3.
The use of different prior distributions for character
rates of evolution for stochastic mapping had no effect
on the results obtained. MP and stochastic mapping
both suggested that, based on our species sampling, the
most likely ancestral state in the genus Brachycaudus
was monoecy on herbaceous plants, regardless of
whether facultatively heteroecious species were considered to be heteroecious or monoecious on trees. For
ML reconstructions, a full model (using 6 transition
rates, one for each type of change) was preferred over a

facultative heteroecious species considered to be heteroecious; (b) life cycle evolution with facultative heteroecious species considered to be

with Caryophyllaceae, and at least one in the subgenus
Acaudus. MP reconstructions suggested that two additional life cycle transitions have occurred in the Acaudus subgenus, which were equally likely to be gains or
losses of host alternation. Ancestral states were equivocal at all nodes when the results of ML reconstructions
were summarised from the sampled 100 trees (Fig. 3).
However, the model setting transition rates from state
zero (monoecious on herbs) towards states 1 (heteroecious) and 2 (monoecious on trees) to zero, was significantly worse than a model without any constraint or a
model setting the reverse transitions to zero (Table 1).
Further, when character states at several nodes of interest (nodes clustering species with contrasted life cycle
states, e.g. species in the subgenus Appelia, species associated with Caryophyllaceae and a group of species in

the subgenus Acaudus) were constrained to state 1 (heteroecious), the likelihood of the reconstruction was significantly worse (more than 2 log units) than when the
same nodes were fixed to state 0 (monoecious on herbs)
(Table 1). These models and ancestral state assignments
comparisons all suggest that, given our dataset, transitions from monoecy on herbs towards heteroecy are
likely in this aphid genus. Stochastic mapping suggested
similar ancestral character states (Table 2) and a similar
total number of life cycle transitions to MP analysis
(around 9, Table 3). Like MP, SIMMAP optimisations
suggested that heteroecy has evolved from monoecy on
herbaceous plants on four or five occasions.
Dietary shifts were also numerous (five transitions
estimated by MP and five to seven transitions estimated by stochastic mapping, Table 3, Fig. 4). ML

the occurrence of several heteroecious species that
remained specialised on their secondary host plants.
Evolution of host-plant association

The mapping of host association on the phylogenetic
tree revealed that several monoecious species lived on
plants from the same family as the secondary hosts of
closely related heteroecious species (Fig. 5). This was
the case in the subgenus Thuleaphis, in which B. amygdalinus (Schouteden, 1905), which alternates between
Prunus amygdalinus (almond) and Polygonum spp.
(Polygonaceae), is closely related to B. rumexicolens,
which is monoecious on plants of the family Polygonaceae (Rumex spp.). Similarly, in the subgenus Brachycaudus, many of the secondary hosts of heteroecious
species and the host plants of monoecious species were
found to belong to either the Boraginaceae or Asteraceae. In Acaudus species associated with Caryophyllaceae, the only heteroecious species (B. divaricatae)
alternates between a Prunus species and various species
of Silene, which also act as hosts for monoecious species
of this subgenus.

investigation of character state transition suggested
that a single rate model was not significantly worse
than a two rate model (0.09 log unit difference). We
therefore used a single Mk1 model for ML character
reconstruction as implemented in Mesquite [28]. The
ancestral state in the genus was probably a specialist
diet (under all optimisation criteria). MP and ML optimisations suggested several acquisitions of a generalist
feeding diet on the secondary host-plant range: one in
the subgenus Brachycaudus and, potentially, several in
the subgenus Acaudus, although MP optimisations
classified most nodes as equivocal in the subgenus
Acaudus, indicating that acquisitions and losses were
equally parsimonious. SIMMAP results suggested that
transitions from a specialist feeding diet to a more
generalist feeding diet were more numerous than those
in the opposite direction (Table 3).
All monoecious species (except for B. bicolor) are
specialists, but the posterior predictive test for association between life cycle type and breadth of host range
yielded non-significant results (D = 0.19, p = 0.11).
The lack of statistical association was probably due to

Our study generated a well resolved phylogeny of the
aphid genus Brachycaudus. Character mapping revealed
the occurrence of multiple transitions in life cycle in
this genus during the course of its evolution. Our findings provide strong evidence for the potential evolutionary lability of complex life history traits, such as host
alternation. Against all expectations, MP and stochastic
mapping both suggested that monoecy on herbaceous
host could be the ancestral state in the genus and that
up to four (re)-acquisitions of the heteroecious life cycle
have occurred. ML optimizations yielded more ambiguities on ancestral character states, and did not allow a
precise estimation of the number and types of transitions, but they all favoured a scenario where losses of
monoecy on herbs and transitions towards heteroecy
have occurred. Character mapping methods are based
on prior distributions and models of evolution, the reliability of which remains unclear [29]. But the fact that all
optimisation criteria agree on reconstructions involving
several reversions towards heteroecy suggests that we
can have a high level of confidence in this scenario.
Artefacts such as the omission of some species or the
existence of asymmetrical diversification rates between
monoecious and heteroecious species could bias our
results [30,31]. However, available data on described
species that were missing from our reconstructions
(Additional file 1) indicate that most of them are probably monoecious on herbs; hence their addition should
not change our conclusions. Several studies suggest that

when a character change has en effect on speciation,
inferring transition rates for this character can lead to
erroneous conclusions [30]. In our case, monoecy on
herbs has been hypothesized to accelerate diversification
rates in aphids [32]. This could lead to a high

abundance of species that are monoecious on herbs and
bias estimation of life cycle transition rates. But this
should bias the results towards an overestimation of the
number of transitions towards monoecy on herbs.
Hence, taking into account biases such as missing

Different prior distributions for the rates of evolution were tested: we show results corresponding to the same priors than Table 2. A: facultative heteroecious

species or high diversification of monoecious species on
herbs should only confirm that heteroecy can be
acquired de novo. Concerning the root of the tree, it is
less certain that the actual ancestral state in the genus is
monoecy on herbs. Brachycaudus belongs to the tribe
Macrosiphini, and its closest relatives are often associated with hosts from the Rosaceae (e.g. Dysaphis spp.
are mostly associated with the genera Pyrus and Malus,

Myzus spp. are often associated with Prunus etc.) [15].
Many Aphidinae clearly have a close affinity with rosaceous hosts, and this affinity may be ancestral (as main
hosts or primary host for heteroecious species) in some
of the tribes of this subfamily [15]. It is therefore likely
that some species that have gone extinct over the
history of the genus Brachycaudus might have been
monoecious on a woody host (a Prunus or another

Rosaceous). We are thus not suggesting that species of
the genus Brachycaudus have captured, in an independent manner on several occasions, Prunus; our study
simply demonstrates that potential ancestral rosaceous
hosts can easily be recaptured once lost, as the sole host
or as primary host for the heteroecious life cycle.
Our results thus clearly contradict the “fundatrix specialisation” hypothesis, which predicts that, once lost, the
primary host cannot be recaptured. Moran, in her paper
supporting the “fundatrix specialisation” hypothesis [19],
rightly pointed out that heteroecious species include
some species for which there are differences between
populations in the use of secondary herbaceous hosts,
with some individuals remaining on primary woody hosts
and others alternating between two hosts. By contrast,
there have been no reports of variation in the use of the
primary host. The absence of “facultative use of the primary host” constitutes a strong argument in favour of the
fundatrix specialisation hypothesis, suggesting that host
alternation loss involves a loss of the primary host, but
not of the secondary host. However, this observation may
be biased. As soon as sexual morphs of an aphid species
are found on herbaceous hosts, it is generally assumed
that the aphid species concerned is monoecious on this
host plant and genetically differentiated from any morphologically similar aphids reproducing on a woody host.
The subgenus Appelia in the genus Brachycaudus has
been the subject of many taxonomic discussions and revisions [33]. It includes aphids identified as B. tragopogonis
that are supposedly monoecious on Tragopogon spp.,
aphids identified as B. schwartzi that are supposedly
monoecious on Prunus spp., and aphids identified as
B. prunicola that are reported as sometimes alternating
between various Prunus species and Tragopogon spp. or
monecious on various Prunus species (Additional file 1).
Even with the use of several variable DNA markers
(Buchnera intergenic regions), it was not possible to differentiate specimens into these species: this complex of
taxa ("subspecies” or “biotypes”) may therefore constitute
a case of a heteroecious species making facultative use of
the primary host for the sexual phase. This may be the
“evolutionary step” reported to be missing in Moran’s
study.
Considering that aphids are the only phytophagous
insects exhibiting host alternation, the lability of this
trait can be surprising. Furthermore, transitions towards
heteroecy necessitate changes in the ability to produce
certain morphs (heteroecious species must necessarily
produce winged males, while some of the monoecious
Brachycaudus produced unwinged males only [14]) as
well as changes in host preference for Prunus in several
morphs (winged males and gynoparae). This a priori
involves complex changes that are not likely to occur
repeatedly during the course of evolution. However

Page 10 of 15

aphid clones have the ability to produce alternative
morphs which is also very unusual among phytophagous
insects. Further, the developmental processes underlying
morph determination seem quite labile as for instance,
the production of winged and unwinged males is highly
variable across the phylogeny [34] and some species in
the Brachycaudus genus and many other aphids genera
produce both types of males [14]. Transcriptomic analyses actually suggest that alternative morphologies can
be determined by alternative gene expression [34]. This
ability to produce alternative morphs with the same
genetic material might actually facilitate evolutionary
changes in life cycles [35]. Concerning the use of rosaceous hosts in Brachycaudus, its lability is actually not
particularly surprising. Retention of the ability to use
former host plants may be quite common in phytophagous insects [36]. Transitions towards heteroecy simply
represent another example of reacquisition of ancestral
character states [37,38]. Finally, phylogenetic studies of
life cycle evolution in parasites have suggested that complex life cycles are evolutionary labile [39-41], and evolutionary research in the domain of parasitology has
largely focused on the selective advantage of using several hosts rather than on the constraints limiting this
trait [42,43]. Hence the lability of life cycle in aphids
is not that surprising when put into perspectives with
literature on life cycle evolution in other groups.
The alternative hypothesis to the “fundatrix specialisation hypothesis” is that heteroecy is advantageous. However, this raises a question already posed in a previous
study [16]: why would closely related species living in
similar environments have different life cycles? Furthermore, the presence of fewer host-alternating species in
the genus than of monoecious species, and the small
number of heteroecious aphids in general (only 10% of
all aphid species) are not consistent with the hypothesis
that host alternation is selectively advantageous, unless
this advantage applies to only a very small number of
environments. We suggest that the observed patterns of
life cycle evolution in the genus Brachycaudus, and possibly similar patterns in other genera of the Aphidinae,
probably result from a combination of both selection and
constraints on host plant choices. Studies of closely
related species with different life cycles should improve
our understanding of the balance between these forces.
These biological models could be used to study morphological changes in the fundatrix following the evolutionary loss of the primary host. Indeed, such an approach
would actually be the best way to test the fundatrix specialisation hypothesis [19]. The genetic determinants of
aphid morphs involved in life cycle variation (i.e. winged,
sexual morphs) have also been little studied, and may
actually involve very few genes [44] or genes that are
easily switched on and off [31], making the reacquisition

Jousselin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:295
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/295

of a woody host less unlikely than previously thought.
This could be investigated with experimental data in the
genus Brachycaudus, but the genomic information now
available for aphids could also be used [45]. Such studies
are necessary to give definitive proofs of the lability of life
cycle in the genus Brachycaudus.
Consequences of host alternation for host-plant
association and the diversification of aphids

Host-plant associations are highly diversified in the
genus Brachycaudus. Our phylogenetic tree revealed
two patterns of host-plant evolution: 1) several monoecious species were found to be associated with herbaceous host plants from the same family as the secondary
hosts of closely related heteroecious species; 2) many
monoecious species were found to be associated with
host plants unrelated to the heteroecious life cycle. For
example, Brachycaudus malvae, which is associated with
Malva spp., is closely related to heteroecious and monoecious species associated with plants of the Asteraceae.
The first of these patterns, when found in other genera
of Aphidinae, has been interpreted as an illustration of
speciation via loss of the heteroecious life cycle and the
shifting of all primary host generations onto some of the
secondary hosts of the original life cycle [13]. This scenario has been suggested for some species in the genus
Cryptomyzus [46]. For example, C. alboapicalis is monoecious on mints (Lamiaceae), whereas closely related species, such as C. galeopsidis, alternate between a woody
host (Ribes spp.) and mint [47]. C. alboapicalis is thought
to have differentiated from its sister species by losing the
primary woody host. Our study in the genus Brachycaudus suggests an additional diversification scenario,
in which re-acquisitions of heteroecy have probably
played a major role in speciation events. A shift in life
cycle, so long as it involves the loss or acquisition of the
primary (winter) host in a group of individuals of an
aphid species, necessarily results in the shifting of sexual
reproduction to a separate host plant and strong reproductive isolation from the population of origin. Hence,
the multiple acquisitions of heteroecy revealed by our
study have probably promoted the diversification of some
Brachycaudus species. Aphidinae, the aphid subfamily
with the largest number of species, includes many genera
displaying host alternation. Some genera, like the genus
Brachycaudus, include both monoecious and heteroecious species (e.g. Dysaphis, Cryptomyzus, Cavariella,
Metopolophium, Capitophorus). It would be interesting
to carry out phylogenetic investigations in these genera
to determine whether the acquisition or re-acquisition of
heteroecy has also occurred and could account for some
of the diversification events.
The second pattern, the use of host plants unrelated
to the heteroecious life cycle, is more difficult to explain.

Page 11 of 15

How did aphids capture these new hosts? We found no
significant correlation between transitions in diet and
changes in life cycle, but the secondary host-plant repertoire of heteroecious species is often larger than the
host-plant repertoire of monoecious species. This larger
host plant repertoire on secondary host plants is a common pattern in aphids [7], and may favour the capture
of new hosts [9,15]. The genus Brachycaudus may illustrate speciation via the acquisition of new, sometimes
distantly related hosts during the “summer” phase of the
heteroecious life cycle.

Conclusions
In conclusion, our results suggest that host alternation is
surprisingly labile in the aphid genus Brachycaudus. The
primary woody hosts can be lost and easily recaptured.
These results clearly go against “the fundatrix specialisation” hypothesis, suggesting that aphids in the genus
Brachycaudus and, possibly, other genera of the Macrosiphini tribe, seem to have escaped from the hypothetical dead end put forward by Moran [7]. Improvements
in our understanding of the selective forces behind the
evolution of host alternation in aphids will require elucidation of the genetic determinants of the fundatrix and
the sexual morphs and of the oviposition preferences of
sexual morphs and thorough ecological studies of closely
related species with different life cycles or natural populations of species described as facultatively heteroecious.
There are several good candidate species in the genus
Brachycaudus for comparative analyses of this type.
Methods
Sampling and phylogenetic reconstruction

The taxa used here were those used in a previous study
[23], with the addition of three species: Brachycaudus
sedi, Brachycaudus cerasicola and Brachycaudus pilosus,
the only representative of the subgenus Mordvilkomemor (sensu [2]). We also added several specimens from
various species used in our previous reconstructions. All
specimens were identified by AC. We studied 88 specimens from 30 of the 43 recognised species in the genus
and three specimens identified as B. (Thuleaphis) sp.
obtained from Kazakhstan (Central Asia) that we were
unable to identify, but which may belong to a new species described by Kadyrbekov [26,27] (collection details
are given in Additional file 2).
Sequences were obtained for these new taxa by the
same methods used in previous studies [23,24]. Six
DNA fragments were amplified and sequenced: two
mitochondrial DNA regions (COI and CytB), one aphid
nuclear DNA region (ITS), three Buchnera aphidicola
DNA fragments (Trpb and two intergenic regions, sbfdna and hupa-rpoc). A second nuclear DNA marker was
also added to complete the dataset, as the ITS fragment

Jousselin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:295
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/295

was poorly informative beyond the subgenus level. We
used primers developed in a previous study [48] on
Aphis gossypii Glover 1877 to amplify and sequence a
portion of an intergenic region in the sodium channel
para-type gene (hereafter referred to as the Aph marker). We have previously shown that: 1) aphid nuclear
DNA (ITS) and mitochondrial DNA phylogenetic results
are consistent [24]; 2) there is perfect cospeciation
between Buchnera aphidicola associated with Brachycaudus and their hosts, validating the use of Buchnera
DNA for reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships
of aphid species in the genus Brachycaudus [23]. We
therefore analysed a combined DNA dataset, corresponding to 4734 aligned bp after the exclusion of two
ambiguously aligned zones of about 200 bp each in
Buchnera intergenic fragments. All sequences have been
submitted to GenBank (accession numbers GU568382GU568672). Coding regions (the Cytb, COI, and Buchnera Trpb genes) were checked for frameshifts in the
coding frame with Mega 3 software [49].
Phylogenetic analyses were based on maximum likelihood (ML) analyses and Bayesian inference.
For ML reconstructions, the model of nucleotide substitution was selected in Model Test 3.7 [50]. The MP tree
with the highest Ln score was used to estimate the model
parameters (gamma shape, base frequencies, substitution
matrix). A ML heuristic search, using a starting tree
obtained by MP methods, was then conducted in PhyML
[51], using the selected model. Node support was assessed
with the bootstrap technique, with 500 replicates.
Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were conducted in
MrBayes 3.1.2 [52]. Sequence data were partitioned by
gene region, this partitioning strategy having been identified as the best fitting model with Bayes factors [23].
We used the GTR + I+ G model identified as the bestfit model for all DNA fragments. The parameters of the
model were treated as unknown variables with uniform
prior probabilities and were estimated during the analysis. They were allowed to vary across partitions. Two
replicate analyses were run for 5 million generations.
For each replicate, we ran one cold chain and three hot
chains of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, using
a random starting tree and sampling trees every 100
generations. The point of stationarity was determined as
the point at which the distribution of likelihoods
reached a plateau and trees prior to stationarity were
discarded (5000 trees). The remaining trees were used
to calculate 50% majority rule consensus trees. Posterior
probabilities (pp) were summarized accordingly.
Species phylogeny

We applied the method developed by Pons et al. [53],
which identifies genetic clusters representing independently evolving entities using a generalised mixed Yule

Page 12 of 15

model. This method statistically differentiates the shift
in the branching patterns of a phylogenetic tree, from
interspecific long branches to intraspecific short polytomous branches, using likelihood approaches [53]. It first
checks that the specimens do not all belong to a single
population obeying a single coalescent process. Under
this assumption, an optimal threshold is identified such
that nodes before this threshold are considered as species diversification events, whereas branches crossing
the threshold define clusters following a coalescent
process.
The GMYC model was run on an ultrametric tree
generated by Multidivtime analysis. The Multidivtime
analysis was run as previously explained [23], adding a
new partition to the dataset (Aph partition), together
with sequences for the new specimens. As described in
the manual [54], the parameters of the substitution
model used by Estbranches were estimated, for each
partition separately, with the baseml program of the
PAML package [55]. The output from baseml was then
used for the first step of the Multidistribute package:
paml2modelinf was run to convert these outputs into
data useable by Estbranches. This program produces
ML estimates of branch lengths within the optimal tree
topology estimated from the combined data (we used
the ML tree topology) and a variance-covariance matrix
for each locus. Multidivtime then makes use of these output files to estimate divergence times. We used the
default setting for Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses
(100,000 cycles in which the Markov chain was sampled
10,000 times every 100th cycle after burn in). Ultrametric
trees for species delimitation analysis were obtained by
arbitrarily assigning prior ages of 1.0 (SD = 1). Rtrate
(mean rate of molecular evolution at the ingroup root
node) was estimated by calculating the median branch
length from the root to ingroup tips.
Reconstruction of character evolution

Our Bayesian consensus tree was well resolved and well
supported, but we nonetheless accounted for phylogenetic uncertainty and branch length variation in character reconstruction by randomly selecting 100 trees from
the stabilised part of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. For this set of trees, we derived a set of “phylogenetic species” trees based on the results of the species
delimitation method, by picking (at random) one specimen for each putative species and pruning subsequent
specimens from the global tree with TreeEdit [56]. We
obtained 100 different “phylogenetic species phylograms”,
on which we mapped life cycle evolution and host range
breadth using several methods of optimization.
We treated “life cycle” as a three-state character: monoecious on herbaceous hosts (0), heteroecious (1), monoecious on woody hosts (2). We used the data on life cycle

Jousselin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:295
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/295

and host plant association summarised in previous studies
[22,57], using additional references to resolve ambiguities
(see Additional file 1 for a summary of ecological data for
each species in the genus). When species were identified
as facultatively heteroecious (some populations do not
alternate on different hosts, or there may have been confusion in the literature when identifying these species, see
Additional file 1), we conducted two analyses. In the first
analysis, these species were treated as heteroecious,
whereas in the second, they were treated as monoecious
(on woody hosts). When monoecious species and heteroecious species where lumped together in a single genetic
cluster by the species delimitation method, this “cluster”
was coded as “heteroecious”.
Host range breadth is a continuous character that is
difficult to define. Heteroecious Brachycaudus species
may be specialists on their primary host plants but generalists on their secondary host plants. In this analysis, for
heteroecious species, we consider this feature only for
secondary hosts. Specialists (0) were defined as species
feeding on a single plant species or a few plant species
belonging to one or two genera. Generalists (1) were
defined as species feeding on several host plants, from
more than two genera, even belonging to more than two
families, in some cases. When “taxonomic” species were
lumped together, the breadth of the host range of the
resulting “phylogenetic species” was re-estimated, taking
into account the host plant repertoire of all the species
clustered together.
Many different optimisation criteria and models are
used for reconstruction of the ancestral state of phenotypic characters, resulting in potentially very different conclusions [29]. We thus used several methods and
compared their results. Character reconstructions were
first achieved by maximum parsimony (MP) methods, as
implemented in Mesquite version 2.7.1 [28]. Maximum
likelihood (ML) reconstructions were also conducted
using the program BayesMultistate [58] incorporated in
the computer package BayesTraits. This method allows
testing hypotheses about transition rates and ancestral
character states using Likelihood Ratio tests. We first
tested the fit of several models of evolution for both characters. For life cycle, we first fitted a full model with six
parameters representing all possible changes between the
three character states and then a simplified model with a
single rate for all transitions. As our aim was to test some
of the predictions of the fundatrix specialisation hypothesis, we also fitted a model setting secondary gains of a
woody host (i.e. transition rates from monoecy on herbs
towards heteroecy and monoecy on woods) to 0. We compared this model to a model where reverse transitions
were set to 0. When comparing models, as they were generally not nested, we applied the general rule of thumb
that two log likelihood units constitutes a significant

Page 13 of 15

difference [3,59]. We then reconstructed ancestral states
for 12 nodes of interest, all of which were supported by pp
values >95%. Still aiming at testing hypotheses concerning
life cycle evolution, we compared the likelihood of the
reconstructions when several internal nodes were fixed to
state (0) monoecious on herbs (using the “fossil node”
command in Multistate) to the likelihood of the reconstructions when these same nodes were fixed to state (1)
heteroecious. For feeding diet evolution, we compared the
fit of a two rate model (asymmetric model) to the fit of a
single rate model (mk1) model and using the preferred
model, we reconstructed ancestral states for several nodes
of interest. Finally the Bayesian stochastic mapping
approach [60], implemented in the software SIMMAP
v.1.0 [61], was also used. In this analysis, we estimated the
posterior probabilities of character states for 12 nodes.
Random determinations of character histories consistent
with the character states observed at the tips of the tree
were used to estimate posterior probabilities for specific
ancestral state reconstruction. SIMMAP can use a symmetric beta prior distribution (bias parameter) for the
morphological state frequencies of binary characters and a
prior distribution for the overall transformation rate for all
characters. We explored the effect of different prior distributions on character reconstruction. For diet (a binary
character), we set the a parameter, describing the shape of
the distribution, at 1, resulting in a flat prior distribution, i.
e. the transition rates from one state to another are not a
priori considered as equal (the distribution was discretised
into 19 categories). For the overall rate of evolution for
both characters, we first tried a high rate of evolution,
assuming that characters could evolve rapidly: the mean
prior tree length E(T) was set to 10 and the SD to 1, by
setting a = 100 and b = 10. We then tried a lower prior
rate of evolution, with the mean prior tree length E(t) set
to 1.5 by setting a = 3 and b = 2 (the gamma distribution
was discretised into 50 categories). For each character
reconstruction, for each of the 100 trees, 50 stochastic
draws from the prior distributions of characters rates of
evolution were taken. Total tree lengths were rescaled to
one before including the morphology priors. We obtained
data for the number of transformations and transition
rates for each character, for each set of priors, using the
“simulate history” option in SIMMAP. For these simulations, we used 10 runs from the priors and 10 runs for
each tree and each character.
We assessed the association between life cycle state
and host range, using the posterior predictive test implemented in SIMMAP. The association test statistic, D,
measures the difference between expected and observed
frequencies of character states for two characters occurring together on a tree. We used the same set of priors
as above, with 10 runs from the priors and 10 runs for
each tree and each character.

Evolution of host-plant association

The objective here was not to reconstruct ancestral
states, but simply to find a convenient way to visualise
the evolution of host-plant association. In particular, we
wanted to determine whether monoecious species used
plants from the secondary host-plant range of closely
related heteroecious species. We therefore characterised
host-plant family for each species and mapped the hostplant family of monoecious species and the secondary
host-plant family of heteroecious species. The genus
includes two highly polyphagous species, Brachycaudus
cardui and Brachycaudus helichrysi, both of which associated mostly with Asteraceae and Boraginaceae. We
therefore assigned these species a character state for host
association, lumping these two plant families together.
The host-plant family association of Brachycaudus species had 13 states (i.e. Brachycaudus species were associated with 13 different plant families). We mapped the
evolution of host-plant association, using the parsimony
ancestral state reconstruction tool of Mesquite on the
chronogram obtained with Multidivtime.
Species for which no biological information had been
published (undescribed species) were discarded from the
analyses (the corresponding taxa were pruned from the
tree). Outgroup taxa were excluded from the ancestral
character reconstructions.
