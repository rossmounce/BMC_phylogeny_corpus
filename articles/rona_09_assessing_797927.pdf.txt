Abstract
Background: Anopheles (Kerteszia) cruzii was the most important vector of human malaria in
southern Brazil between 1930–1960. Nowadays it is still considered an important Plasmodium spp.
vector in southern and south-eastern Brazil, incriminated for oligosymptomatic malaria. Previous
studies based on the analysis of X chromosome banding patterns and inversion frequencies in An.
cruzii populations from these areas have suggested the occurrence of three sibling species. In
contrast, two genetically distinct groups among An. cruzii populations from south/south-east and
north-east Brazil have been revealed by isoenzyme analysis. Therefore, An. cruzii remains unclear.
Methods: In this study, a partial sequence of the timeless gene (~400 bp), a locus involved in the
control of circadian rhythms, was used as a molecular marker to assess the genetic differentiation
between An. cruzii populations from six geographically distinct areas of Brazil.
Results: The timeless gene revealed that An. cruzii from Itaparica Island, Bahia State (north-east
Brazil), constitutes a highly differentiated group compared with the other five populations from
south and south-east Brazil. In addition, significant genetic differences were also observed among
some of the latter populations.
Conclusion: Analysis of the genetic differentiation in the timeless gene among An. cruzii populations
from different areas of Brazil indicated that this malaria vector is a complex of at least two cryptic
species. The data also suggest that further work might support the occurrence of other siblings
within this complex in Brazil.

Background
Anopheles cruzii is one of the few mosquito species belonging to the subgenus Kerteszia. Immature stages of this species are found associated with water trapped in the

interfoliar space of plants from the Bromeliaceae family,
which are abundant in the Brazilian Atlantic forest [1-3].
Accordingly, the distribution of these bromeliad-breeding
mosquitoes is restricted to the Atlantic forest, which

stretches from the coast of Rio Grande do Sul State (southern Brazil) to Sergipe State (north-eastern Brazil) [4,5].

the occurrence of outbreaks or to lead control strategies,
especially in formerly endemic areas.

The adults are found in a variety of habitats, from sea level
in coastal areas to the mountains. Females are strongly
anthropophilic and preferably bite during the evening
[2,6,7], perhaps biting more than one host to complete
egg maturation, which is epidemiologically relevant for
malaria transmission [8-10].

Despite its epidemiological importance, there are only a
few population genetic studies of An. cruzii [18,21], and
its taxonomic status is unclear. Anopheles cruzii is polymorphic for chromosome rearrangements. Differences in
inversions frequencies, and X chromosome banding patterns from south-eastern and southern Brazil, have suggested the existence of three sibling species [21-24]. On
the other hand, isoenzymes indicated two genetically isolated groups, one from Bahia State (north-eastern Brazil),
and the other from south-eastern and southern Brazil (Rio
de Janeiro, São Paulo and Santa Catarina States) [25].
Finally, in a recent study based on sequence analysis of the
second Internal Transcribed Spacer of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS2), the authors found no conclusive evidence for sibling species among samples of An. cruzii from
south-eastern and southern Brazilian localities [26].

Between 1930 and 1960, An. cruzii together with Anopheles
bellator and Anopheles homunculus, which also belong to
Kerteszia, were considered the main vectors of malaria
when the disease was endemic in southern Brazil. Vector
control measures have significantly reduced or even interrupted malaria transmission in some areas, but eradication of the pathogen was not achieved and An. cruzii is still
responsible for several oligosymptomatic malaria cases in
southern and south-eastern Brazil.
The Amazon region is highly endemic for human malaria,
caused by Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum,
and imported cases are frequently reported in different
states due to emigration from this region [11,12]. However, several autochthonous cases were reported in a study
in Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil [12]. In the states
of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, as well as in the state of
Bahia, where An. cruzii and Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) spp.
are considered the main vectors of the disease, respectively [3,7,13,14], several imported and autochthonous
cases of malaria are reported every year in the Atlantic forest region [15]. Reinforcing the epidemiological importance of An. cruzii as a malaria vector in south-east Brazil,
another recent study in Espírito Santo State, including the
locality of Santa Teresa, suggested that this species is the
potential vector of recent autochthonous cases of malaria
in this state [16].
Anopheles cruzii is also a natural vector of simian malaria
in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo States [17]. Studies on
seasonal and vertical distribution of An. cruzii in coastal
São Paulo State demonstrated high vertical mobility from
ground level to tree tops, with significantly more activity
in the uppermost branch layer of the forest [18]. This
behaviour could be responsible for human infection by
simian Plasmodium species [19,20].
Epidemiological surveillance and the use of control measures are required to avoid the expansion or introduction
of malaria in areas where vector species are abundant and
susceptible humans are present. Thus, assessment of the
epidemiological status of such localities as well as knowledge concerning the biology, behaviour and the genetic
characteristics of the vector species are relevant to prevent

The activity and feeding rhythms of insect vectors are very
important to disease transmission. These patterns are controlled by endogenous circadian clocks, which are under
genetic control [27]. Furthermore, clock genes are also
involved in the control of mating rhythms that are potentially important in maintaining sexual isolation between
closely related species [28,29].
The circadian rhythms of malaria vectors belonging to the
subgenus Kerteszia were formerly studied by Pittendrigh
[30] and, recently, these rhythms were also studied in An.
cruzii [31]. The timeless gene is involved in the control of
activity rhythms in Drosophila [27], and controls differences in mating rhythms between closely related Drosophila species [28].
In the present study, a fragment of ~400 bp of the An.
cruzii timeless gene was used as a molecular marker to
assess intraspecific variability and genetic divergence
among six populations of An. cruzii captured in different
locations within the geographic distribution range of this
species in Brazil.

Methods
Mosquitoes
All mosquitoes used in this study were females captured at
the following localities along the Brazilian Atlantic forest:
Florianópolis, Santa Catarina State (SC) (27°31'S/
48°30'W), Cananéia and Juquitiba, São Paulo State (SP)
(25°01'S/47°55'W and 23°57'S/47°03'W), Itatiaia, Rio
de Janeiro State (RJ) (22°27'S/44°36'W), Santa Teresa,
Espírito Santo State (ES) (19°56'S/40°35'W) and Itaparica Island (Jaguaripe), Bahia State (BA) (13°05'S/
38°48'W) (Figure 1). All mosquitoes were primarily identified on the basis of their morphology according to Con-

soli and Lourenço-de-Oliveira [5]. A total of 67
individuals (12 from Florianópolis, 12 from Cananéia, 11
from Juquitiba, 12 from Itatiaia, 6 from Santa Teresa and
14 from Itaparica, Bahia) were used for molecular assays.
Isolation of the An. cruzii timeless gene sequence
To design specific primers for the An. cruzii timeless gene
sequence, genomic DNA was extracted from 10 females
according to Jowett [32]. Initially, a pair of degenerated
primers based on conserved regions of the TIMELESS proteins from Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae
named here 5'timdeg03 and 3'timdeg03 was used (Table
1; see also Figure 2) [33]. PCR was carried out with an
Eppendorf Mastercycler® thermocycler using the following
conditions: 15 cycles at 94°C for 60 s, 50°C (decreasing
1°C/cycle) for 90 s and 72°C for 60 s, following 20 cycles
of 94°C for 60 s, 50°C for 90 s and 72°C for 60 s. The
products obtained were then purified and cloned in either
Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen) or pMOS
Blue vector blunt-ended cloning kit (Amersham Biosciences). Sequencing of positive clones was carried out in
an ABI Prism 377 or ABI Prism 3730 DNA sequencer at
the Oswaldo Cruz Institute using the ABI Prism Big Dye
Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied
Biosystems). The identity of the cloned fragments was
determined by BlastX analysis using the GenBank [34]. To
enlarge the timeless gene fragment in An. cruzii, a specific
forward primer (5'darltim02a) based on a fragment of the
Anopheles darlingi timeless gene (Gentile & Peixoto, unpublished) was used in combination with the specific reverse
primer previously designed for An. cruzii (3'cruziitim03)
in a PCR that amplified a fragment of ~450 bp. This 450
bp fragment from the An. cruzii genome was then purified,
cloned and sequenced as above. After checking the
sequence identity, two new specific forward primers
named 5'cruziitim02 and 5'acbatim02a (Table 1 and Figure 2) were designed and in combination with the reverse
primer 3'cruziitim03 allowed the amplification of a ~400
bp fragment of the An. cruzii timeless gene.
Interpopulational analysis of the An. cruzii timeless gene
Females were processed individually and genomic DNA
was extracted as above [32]. PCR amplification was carTable 1: Sequence of primers used to amplify the timeless gene

ried out for 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 62°C for 60 s and
72°C for 90 s using the proofreading Pfu DNA polymerase
(Biotools) and primers 5'acbatim02a or 5'cruziitim02
and 3'cruziitim03 (Table 1). Negative controls (no DNA
added) were included in all amplification reactions and
pre- and post-PCR procedures did not share equipment or
reagents. After cloning the fragments obtained as above, at
least eight clones of each mosquito were sequenced and
two consensus sequences representing both alleles were
generated. When only one haplotype was observed
among the eight sequences the mosquito was considered
a homozygote. The probability that a heterozygote will be
mistakenly classified as a homozygote with this procedure
is less than 1%. Five mosquitoes were classified as
homozygotes in Itatiaia, none in Florianópolis and one in
each of the other four populations. The sequences
obtained in homozygote mosquitoes were duplicated
prior to analysis. However, the population genetics analysis was also carried out without duplicating the homozygote sequences and the results were very similar.
DNA sequence analysis
The timeless gene fragments were aligned using the GCG
package (Wisconsin Package Version 10.2, Genetics Computer Group) and ClustalX software [35]. Analyses of the
polymorphism and differentiation between populations
were performed using DNASP4.0 [36] and PROSEQ programs [37]. FST was calculated as described by Hudson et
al [38] and significance was evaluated by 1,000 random
permutations. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using
MEGA 4.0 [39] using the default parameters.

Results
Isolation of An. cruzii timeless gene fragment
Different PCR schemes were tested to amplify a fragment
of the An. cruzii timeless gene (see Methods). Figure 2
shows an alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence
encoded by this fragment obtained from An. cruzii compared to the TIMELESS protein of other insect species (D.
melanogaster, Aedes aegypti and An. gambiae). A fairly high
degree of inter-specific similarity is observed, but the
putative protein encoded by 5' end of this fragment is variable, presenting some amino acid changes among the
species compared. Figure 2 also shows the approximate
positions of the two introns that occur in this region of the
gene, as well as the location of the primers used to amplify
the fragment from An. cruzii used for the population
genetics analysis described below.
Molecular variation and divergence among An. cruzii
populations
The geographic distribution of the six Brazilian populations of An. cruzii used in this study is shown at Figure 1.
Initially, using the primers 5'cruziitim02 and
3'cruziitim03 (see Figure 2), a ~420 bp fragment of the

timeless gene was amplified in all An. cruzii populations
analyzed, with the exception of samples from Bahia State
(Itaparica Island), which revealed a ~400 bp amplification
product, indicating the existence of length variation
among the studied populations. The sample from Bahia,
however, displayed lower amplification in some cases
using these primers, and so a new internal forward primer
named 5'acbatim02a (Table 1) was designed based on the
initial sequences obtained. Using this new primer in conjunction with 3'cruziitim03, a ~410 bp fragment of time-

less gene was obtained for all An. cruzii populations from
south and south-east Brazil and a ~390 bp from Bahia.
A total of 24 sequences from Florianópolis, 24 from
Cananéia, 22 from Juquitiba, 24 from Itatiaia, 12 from
Santa Teresa and 28 from Itaparica (Bahia State) populations were obtained. The sequences were submitted to
GenBank (accession numbers: FJ408732 – FJ408865). A
full alignment of all sequences is shown in Additional file

within the two introns, which show a number of indels. A
few non-synonymous changes were also observed, causing seven amino acid differences among the sequences.

mutually exclusive categories of segregating sites observed
in each comparison, i.e. the number of polymorphisms
exclusive for each population (S1 and S2), the number of
shared polymorphisms (Ss) and the number of fixed differences (Sf) between populations are also included in
Table 3. These polymorphic and fixed sites include some
of the non-synonymous changes observed (see Table 4 for
a detailed description).

Table 2 shows the number of DNA sequences of each An.
cruzii population studied (n) and the number of polymorphic sites (S). The values in parentheses were calculated
using only coding regions of the timeless gene fragment.
Based on the sequences, two measures of nucleotide
diversity were calculated for each population: π, based on
the average number of pair-wise differences and θ, based
on the total number of mutations (Table 2). The population from Bahia was the least polymorphic, showing the
lowest values of θ and π, as well as the smaller number of
polymorphic sites (S). Table 2 also shows the results of
Tajima [40] and Fu & Li [41] tests of natural selection,
based on the total number of mutations of each population. In all cases, Tajima's D or Fu & Li's D and F statistics
were non-significant (P > 0.10) indicating no deviations
from neutrality.

The values using only coding regions (shown in parentheses in Table 3) show some differences compared with
those obtained with the whole sequence. Yet even using
the more conserved coding regions, the values of differentiation between the population from Bahia and all others
revealed a high number of fixed differences and only a few
shared polymorphisms. Among the southern and southeastern populations, there were shared polymorphisms
and no fixed differences, suggesting they belong to the
same or to very closely related species.
Divergence time between An. cruzii populations
The estimate of the time of divergence between An. cruzii
populations from Bahia and the others were calculated
using the Da value based on the third codon positions.
This estimate assumed that substitutions rates observed
between An. cruzii from Bahia State and the other populations originally from southern regions of Brazil are similar
to the estimated rates in the same fragment of the timeless
gene between closely related Drosophila persimilis and Drosophila pseudoobscura, species that diverged around 0.85
millions of years ago (MYA) (FlyBase Accession Numbers

Table 3 shows the pair-wise estimates of population differentiation (FST) between all An. cruzii populations. In all
cases the FST values were significant, except for the comparison between Juquitiba and Santa Teresa when the
coding regions of the timeless gene fragment were used.
Very high FST values were found between Bahia State and
the others (0.8353 – 0.8761). The average number of
nucleotide substitutions per site (Dxy) and the number of
net nucleotide substitutions per site between populations
(Da) are shown in Table 3. The distribution of the four

FBtr0185090 and FBtr0282161, respectively) [42]. The
divergence observed for the timeless gene between these
two Drosophila species based on the third codon positions
is 0.03030. Based on the Da value (0.05426), the estimated time of divergence between An. cruzii populations
from south and south-east Brazil and that from Bahia
State, is approximately 1.5 MYA.
Genealogy of the An. cruzii timeless sequences
Figure 3 shows a Neighbour-joining tree of the sequences
from all An. cruzii populations using the Kimura 2-parameter distance and the timeless gene sequences. The resulting tree showed no clear separation between the
sequences of the populations from Florianópolis,
Cananéia, Juquitiba, Itatiaia and Santa Teresa, but some
differentiation was evident since the sequences do not
appear at random in the tree, especially in the case of Itatiaia. The An. cruzii sequences from the Bahia population,
however, were clearly separated on an isolated branch.

Discussion
Zavortink [4] pointed out morphological differences in
the larval stage of populations of An. cruzii from Rio de
Janeiro and Santa Catarina States, suggesting that An.
cruzii could represent more than a single species. A moderately high FST value between Florianópolis (Santa Catarina State) and Itatiaia (Rio de Janeiro State) populations
was reported here. In addition, comparison of Itatiaia
with the other populations (excluding Bahia) revealed

even higher FST values, perhaps suggesting that this population is indeed in a process of differentiation and incipient speciation. Moreover, sequences from Itatiaia showed
some clustering in the Neighbour-joining tree (Figure 3).
Itatiaia was also the least polymorphic population of
south and south-east Brazil and showed the highest
number of homozygotes suggesting some inbreeding. It is
possible that this reflects a smaller effective size and the
relative isolation of this population, since its location in a
valley between two mountain chains (Serra do Mar and
Serra da Mantiqueira – Figure 1) might reduce gene flow
with other populations.
In a recent review, Ayala and Coluzzi [43] argue that many
siblings are outcomes of recent speciation processes associated with paracentric inversions, mostly involving the X
chromosome. Ramirez and Dessen [23,24], studying the
X chromosome banding patterns and inversion frequencies of distinct populations of An. cruzii from south and
south-east Brazil, showed that there are three X chromosomal forms (A, B and C), suggesting a process of incipient speciation acting on An. cruzii populations. Among
the localities analysed in this study, only Juquitiba and
Cananéia were also investigated by Ramirez and Dessen
[23,24]. They observed that in Juquitiba the majority of
mosquitoes had form A and the remainder had form C,
while in Cananéia form B predominated with the remainder having form A [23,24]. Although the differentiation in
the timeless gene between these two populations is not

high, the FST value is significant and does not contradict
the results of the chromosomal analysis. The relatively
low differentiation in timeless among most populations
from south and south-east Brazil might reflect introgression at this locus. It would be interesting to analyse the
same populations with an X-linked molecular marker to
see whether a higher level of differentiation is found.
Recently, Malafronte et al [26] compared sequences of
ITS2 (Internal Spacer Region 2) from several An. cruzii
populations from south and south-east Brazil. Although,
they found some differences between sequences from different localities, including Juquitiba and Cananéia, they
considered premature to conclude based on their results
that there are distinct sibling species in the areas they
investigated. Similar results were observed by Calado et al
[44] using PCR-RAPD and PCR-RFLP of the ITS2 region.

Very strong evidence was presented here that confirms the
existence of a different species in Bahia State, a finding
that supports a previous isoenzyme study [25]. The
extremely high FST values detected between this population and the other five populations studied, as well as the
higher number of fixed differences observed, show that
Bahia represents a different species. This population also
presented lower levels of variability than those from south
and south-east Brazil, possibly indicating a smaller population size or past founder effects. However, although the
isoenzyme heterozygosity reported for Bahia is lower than
Cananéia it is similar to that observed in Florianópolis
[25].
A very rough estimate suggests that the divergence
between the Bahia population and the more southern
populations of An. cruzii possibly occurred around 1.5

MYA, during the Pleistocene. Climate changes during this
period such as an intense precipitation decrease and more
arid conditions fragmented the Brazilian Atlantic forest
[45] creating refugia that played an important role in the
differentiation among populations of a number of forest
species, such as marmosets [46], tree frogs and many others [47]. Forest fragmentation has also been proposed to
explain differentiation among populations of the Atlantic
forest mosquito Sabethes albiprivus [48]. Since An. cruzii is
also a forest-obligate species, it is possible that the Bahia
and southern populations of this species complex suffered
fragmentation due a constriction of the forest. Although
Tajima's D and Fu & Li's D and F statistics were non-significant, they were negative in most cases and that is consistent with population expansion following the forest
recovery after the Pleistocene. Analysis of a number of
other molecular markers will allow more precise estimates
of the divergence time between the Bahia population and
those of south and south-east Brazil. It may also help in
determining whether further An. cruzii siblings exist in the
latter area.

Acknowledgements
Finally, although malaria cases are reported annually in
Bahia State, the main vector implicated in Plasmodium
spp. transmission in this area is An. darlingi and not An.
cruzii, the most important vector in the southern states.
This suggests that the differentiation observed within the
An. cruzii complex might also explain aspects of the vectorial capacity of these mosquitoes, however further studies
are needed to confirm or reject this hypothesis.

Conclusion
Analysis of the molecular polymorphism and genetic differentiation of the timeless gene among Brazilian populations of An. cruzii indicates that this malaria vector is a
complex of at least two cryptic species, one occurring in
the north-east (Bahia State) and another in south and
south-east Brazil. In addition, the data also suggest that
populations of the latter region might also constitute different incipient species and that further work might support the occurrence of other siblings within this complex
in Brazil.
