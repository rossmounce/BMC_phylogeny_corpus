The odds of duplicate gene persistence after
polyploidization
Frédéric JJ Chain1,2*, Jonathan Dushoff1 and Ben J Evans1

Abstract
Background: Gene duplication is an important biological phenomenon associated with genomic redundancy,
degeneration, specialization, innovation, and speciation. After duplication, both copies continue functioning when
natural selection favors duplicated protein function or expression, or when mutations make them functionally
distinct before one copy is silenced.
Results: Here we quantify the degree to which genetic parameters related to gene expression, molecular
evolution, and gene structure in a diploid frog - Silurana tropicalis - influence the odds of functional persistence of
orthologous duplicate genes in a closely related tetraploid species - Xenopus laevis. Using public databases and 454
pyrosequencing, we obtained genetic and expression data from S. tropicalis orthologs of 3,387 X. laevis paralogs
and 4,746 X. laevis singletons - the most comprehensive dataset for African clawed frogs yet analyzed. Using
logistic regression, we demonstrate that the most important predictors of the odds of duplicate gene persistence
in the tetraploid species are the total gene expression level and evenness of expression across tissues and
development in the diploid species. Slow protein evolution and information density (fewer exons, shorter introns)
in the diploid are also positively correlated with duplicate gene persistence in the tetraploid.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a combination of factors contribute to duplicate gene persistence
following whole genome duplication, but that the total expression level and evenness of expression across tissues
and through development before duplication are most important. We speculate that these parameters are useful
predictors of duplicate gene longevity after whole genome duplication in other taxa.

Background
Gene duplication is a fundamental genomic process that
occurs on a small scale via segmental duplication and
on a large scale via whole genome duplication (WGD).
Gene duplication triggers biological innovation (neofunctionalization; 1,), reduces pleiotropy by division of labor
(subfunctionalization; 2), contributes to reproductive
incompatibilities via divergent resolution [3], and generates redundancy [4]. More often than not, however, the
ultimate fate of duplicate genes is the loss of one copy,
usually within a few million years [5]. Persistence of duplicate genes occurs when natural selection favors duplicated
protein function or expression, or when modifications
soon after duplication distinguish the duplicates in some
way (for example by causing paralogous expression

domains to diverge). The targets of natural selection after
gene duplication can be broadly divided into those that
involve no change in function, gain of function, or loss of
function [6]. For example, both copies of a duplicated
gene may evade pseudogenization without changed function if having higher expression is advantageous, if disrupting the dosages of interacting duplicated proteins is
disadvantageous, or if segregation of functionally distinct
alleles that evolved prior to duplication is beneficial
[5,7-9]. Persistence of duplicates could also be triggered by
changes after duplication if advantageous mutations occur
in one or both paralogs, or if degenerative mutations make
the paralogs non-redundant [1,2,10,11]. Over time,
increased divergence between duplicate genes reduces the
chances of synfunctionalization, a phenomenon by which
one of the paralogs convergently evolves the function or
expression domain of the other, thereby re-establishing
redundancy and leading to the loss of one paralog [12].
A challenge in evolutionary biology, then, is to identify the

relative importance of different mechanisms for duplicate
gene retention, and also to understand what genetic factors prior to duplication portend a high probability of both
paralogs persisting as functional loci after duplication.
Various factors are correlated with the odds of duplicate
gene persistence, including how paralogs are generated (by
segmental duplication or WGD), the breadth and intensity
of expression, dosage sensitivity, interactions with other
proteins, the number of functional domains, and the rate
of evolution [13-23]. In the case of ohnologs - duplicate
genes generated by WGD, expression dosage is thought to
frequently drive functional persistence, suggesting that the
stoichiometry of expression among duplicated loci is
important [21,24-29]. However, many of these factors are
correlated with each other, making it challenging to tease
apart their relative impact. For example, genes with high
expression intensities or broad expression patterns tend to
evolve slowly [30-37] so it is not clear with which degree
each variable influences duplicate gene persistence after
factoring out the role of the other. Our focus here is to
disentangle and quantify the relative contributions of several variables to duplicate gene persistence after WGD.
Xenopus as a model to study duplicate genes

Whole genome duplication occurred in an ancestor of
African clawed frogs of the genus Xenopus ~ 21 - 41 million years ago, after divergence from ancestors of the
genus Silurana [6,38]. This essentially duplicated all loci in
the nuclear genome, generating ohnologs. Here we build
on previous studies of the molecular evolution and expression of duplicate genes in X. laevis (reviewed in 39) by
assembling and analyzing the most comprehensive dataset
yet from this species in terms of the number of genes and
the scope of genetic parameters. Using data from the
diploid species S. tropicalis, we use logistic regression to
evaluate the odds that the orthologous paralogs in the tetraploid species X. laevis both remain functional. Logistic
regression allows us to jointly quantify the relative impact
of multiple genetic variables from a diploid genome on the
odds of duplicate persistence in a tetraploid genome, while
factoring out statistical noise caused by post-WGD
changes in the tetraploid [40].

Methods
This study examines gene expression, molecular evolution,
and gene structure information of singleton genes in the
diploid species S. tropicalis that are orthologous either to a
pair of ohnologs in the tetraploid species X. laevis or to a
single-copy gene in X. laevis. We assume that all singlecopy genes in X. laevis were once part of a pair of ohnologs but that one copy has been lost due to post-WGD
pseudogenization. Our analyses therefore consist of two
gene sets: (1) gene triads, which include a pair of X. laevis
ohnologs and the corresponding S. tropicalis singleton

Page 2 of 7

ortholog, and (2) gene dyads, which include one X. laevis
singleton and the corresponding S. tropicalis singleton
ortholog.
Nucleotide sequences from 3,387 gene triads and 4,746
dyads were gathered from the NCBI UniGene databases
using tBLASTx and a reciprocal best hit approach. UniGenes are a set of non-redundant clusters of transcript
sequences that compose the expressed sequence tag (EST)
libraries. In a gene triad, the two X. laevis UniGenes were
reciprocal best hits within the X. laevis UniGenes, and
they both returned the same S. tropicalis UniGene as the
top hit. In a dyad, each putative X. laevis singleton has a
single unique reciprocal top hit with S. tropicalis. UniGenes that had more than two X. laevis genes or more
than one S. tropicalis gene with reciprocal best hits were
excluded. To test whether our putative singletons were
indeed singletons, we tried to amplify the other ohnolog of
17 X. laevis singletons using PCR primers designed to
amplify both the X. laevis singleton and the S. tropicalis
ortholog [41]; in all cases only one gene copy was amplified in X. laevis. Triads and dyads were aligned using
MUSCLE [42], and Perl scripts were used to predict the
beginning and end of coding regions by looking for the
longest open reading frame in either direction. Overlapping alignments shorter than 201 nucleotides were discarded along with 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions and
indels.
Non-normalized EST libraries were obtained from NCBI
(dbEST Library IDs: 10829, 10830, 10895, 10896, 20954,
20886, 21298, 20560, 20561, 20562, 20892, 20891, 20911,

9909, 9665, 9908, 14603). We classified and combined
718,484 S. tropicalis ESTs (from a total of 1,271,375) into
14 distinct adult tissues and 4 embryological stages: brain,
bone, eye, heart, kidney, liver, lung, thymus, pancreas,
skin, spleen, fat body, ovary, testis, egg, gastrula stage,
neurula stage, and embryo stage 62. Each library consists
of at least 3,900 transcripts (on average 39,915) and each
individual UniGene has its own set of unique ESTs. We
used the proportion of transcripts of each gene divided by
the number of transcripts in a given EST library as an estimate of its expression level to control for the different
sizes of the EST libraries. For twenty-three outlier genes
with high expression, we truncated the expression level to
a value of 1% of the respective EST library to prevent
these outliers from dominating the results. Of the set of
genes for which sequence data were available, a total of
3,298 triads and 4,426 dyads also had expression data (at
least one S. tropicalis EST read in at least one EST
database).

Expression summary statistics

To characterize expression patterns in the diploid species
S. tropicalis, three non-independent summary statistics
were calculated: total expression (T), expression intensity
(I), and expression evenness (E). Total expression T is
simply the expression level (the proportion of total EST
reads of a gene in a given EST library, Li) summed across
all EST libraries (T = Σ L i ). Genes that are evenly
expressed at moderate levels in many tissues have similar
T to genes that are highly expressed in only a few tissues.
We therefore introduced a measure of “intensity”. Intensity is the mean expression level as seen by a gene, rather
than by a tissue. Thus, we expect a gene that is highly
expressed in only a few tissues to have a moderate total
expression, but a high level of intensity. We calculate
intensity as a weighted average of expression levels,
where the expression levels themselves are the weights:
I = Σ Li2 /Σ Li.
Although T and I capture the desired information
about gene expression levels and distribution, we added a
measure of evenness to give our linear model more flexibility. We define the evenness E as T/I; this is a logical
measure of the “effective” number of tissues in which a
gene is expressed, and we consider this analogous to how
broadly a gene is expressed. E is equal to (Σ Ei)2 /Σ Ei2,
and is therefore Simpson’s diversity (equivalent to 1/
Simpson’s index). E therefore measures how evenly distributed gene expression is across different tissues. A
gene with relatively even distribution across tissues will
have an elevated E (will be broadly expressed), irrespective of the total expression level. T was calculated for
8,133 genes. For 409 genes that had no EST reads, T was
zero, E was undefined and set as missing, and I was undefined but set to zero since it must approach zero as
expression levels approach zero.
Molecular evolution

We used 454 pyrosequencing of cDNA from Pipa carvalhoi and Hymenochirus curtipes to generate outgroup
sequences for analysis of molecular evolution in Silurana
and Xenopus (following the same protocol as in [43]).
Sequences were assembled using gsAssembler and
gsMapper (454/Roche) and the resulting contigs aligned
to the triads and dyads using Perl scripts, BLAST and
MUSCLE. This effort recovered sequences from portions
of 2,157 genes from P. carvalhoi or H. curtipes that were
used to root a phylogeny with sequences from S. tropicalis and either one ortholog or both ohnologs of X. laevis.
New sequences from the outgroup species have been
deposited in the Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly database (JP285961 - JP288098, JP297711 - JP297788).
We calculated rates of nonsynonymous (dN) and
synonymous (dS) substitutions per site, and the dN/dS
rate ratio of the S. tropicalis lineage. These statistics

Page 3 of 7

were calculated with the codeml program in the PAML
package version 3.15 [44] using a maximum likelihood
model that individually estimates each type of substitution rate for each branch. Sixty-five values of dN/dS
were undefined due to a dS of zero. To cope with this,
we instead used an adjusted dN/dS in our analysis,
defined as dN/(dS+0.02). We made this adjustment a
priori (looking only at dS values) and performed it on
all genes for which we had sequence data. By choosing
adjusted dN/dS as our measure of the relative strength
of selection in our model, we are simply choosing a different proxy for this underlying effect so that we are
able to make use of more of our data.
Gene structure

Using JGI annotations for S. tropicalis EST data, we collected statistics on gene structure for 6,075 genes. These
statistics relate to content and packaging of information;
for each gene we scored the number of exons, the length
of the protein-coding region, the total length of introns
and the amino acid diversity (Shannon Index).
Logistic regression, missing data and confidence intervals

Logistic regression is a generalized linear model used for
binomial regression, providing a useful statistical framework with which to explore the impact of continuous and
potentially non-independent variables on a binary outcome (here, whether or not both copies of a duplicate
gene persist after WGD). Logistic regression was recently
employed to identify predictors of paralog retention originating from both WGD and tandem duplications in Populus [45]. Whereas that study used genetic variables taken
from the tetraploid species, we used the logistic regression
to test the association between genetic variables measured
in a diploid and the persistence of orthologous ohnologs
in a tetraploid. Our goal was not to make a predictive
model, but to use the linear model as a tool to study associations and make inferences about evolutionary mechanisms. This analysis was performed using R [46].
We divided each of our variables by its standard deviation; thus the regression coefficients are proportional to
the overall estimated importance of an approximation of
the relative influence that each variable has on the outcome - the odds of persisting as a duplicate gene. Some
of our variables have missing data. To make possible a
single analysis that jointly considered all of the data, we
substituted each missing value with the grand mean of
that variable. Variables were not re-normalized after substitution because this would affect the variance and
inferred importance of the variable in the logistic regression. This substitution allows us to jointly consider all
available data in one analysis. Because this replacement
affects the standard regression assumption, we report Pvalues based on a permutation test of the model. For

each variable, we fitted the model 2000 times - once with
the original data, and 1999 times with the focal variable
replaced by a random permutation of itself. The twotailed permutation P-value is twice the proportion of
these fits (including the original) whose coefficients for
the focal variable are greater (respectively, less than) or
equal to a positive (negative) coefficient from the original
fit. Since we conservatively count the original fit, our
two-tailed P-value from 2000 tests cannot be less than
0.001. The permutation P-values are similar to the standard P-values from the logistic regression (not shown)
and in fact give exactly the same pattern of significance.
An analysis including the 2,021 genes without missing
data was also performed and does not change our overall
conclusions: one variable is no longer significant (number
of exons) and another is now significant (amino acid
diversity). The direction of the correlation of our significant variables does not change, and the relative strength
of the strongest predictors (total expression, evenness of
expression, dN and dS) remains the same.

Gene Expression

Total expression (T) is the strongest predictor of duplicate
gene functional persistence after WGD out of the parameters we considered. Expression evenness (E) is the second strongest predictor. These correlations are of
significantly larger magnitude than all or most of the other
parameters. This indicates that genes with high overall
expression and even distribution across tissues and developmental stages tend to persist as duplicates following
WGD. A third expression summary statistic (I) does not
have a significant effect on the odds of persistence in our
full model; since our three expression statistics are not
independent, this does not mean intensity is not important, only that whatever effect intensity has is captured
better by using T than I as a predictor in a linear model.
Molecular Evolution

Two out of three non-independent variables related to
molecular evolution are also significantly associated with
persistence. The rate of nonsynonymous (dN) and
synonymous (dS) substitutions are significantly negatively correlated, indicating that genes evolving slowly
before WGD at both the protein level and overall, are
more likely to persist after WGD. Selective constraint
(dN/dS), however, does not have a significant effect on
duplicate gene persistence when combined with our
other variables.

Variables include expression summary statistics Total (T), Intensity (I), and
Evenness (E), the rate of nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS)
subsitutions per site, the ratio of dN/dS after adjusting dS (dNdS_adj), the
number of exons (No.Exons), the total protein-coding length in nucleotides
(Protein Length), the total intron length (Intron Length) and the amino acid
diversity (AA Diversity). See Methods for description of these variables. The
coefficient column represents the change in the log odds of duplicate gene
retention per unit increase in the predictor variable. A positive (respectively,
negative) coefficient indicates a positive (negative) correlation between that
variable in the diploid species S. tropicalis and the probability that a duplicate
is retained in the tetraploid species X. laevis. Significant values of P < 0.01 are
indicated with an asterisk.

Gene Structure

Two out of four variables related to the information content and packaging of genes are also significantly associated with paralog persistence. Genes with fewer exons
(thus fewer introns) and shorter total intron length are
more likely to be retained after WGD in X. laevis. Under
the scenario that the number of exons and intron length
reflect how “efficiently” information is packaged in a
gene, there is a positive association between efficient
information packaging in S. tropicalis (fewer exons and
shorter introns) and ohnolog retention in X. laevis. This
also suggests that genes with a smaller mutational target
are more likely to persist. The coefficients of the number
of exons and the total intron length are both significantly
lower in magnitude than T and E and also lower than dN
and dS. The total protein length and the amino acid
diversity, however, did not have significant correlations
in this analysis.

Discussion
We used logistic regression to test the relative impact of
expression and evolution of genes from a diploid species,
S. tropicalis, on the odds of functional persistence of
duplicate genes generated by WGD in a tetraploid species, X. laevis. Our analysis employed EST databases and
new molecular sequences from closely related outgroup
species generated with next-generation sequencing of
cDNA. We found that genes that are highly and broadly
expressed, slowly evolving, and with more streamlined
information packaging are preferentially retained as
duplicates after WGD. Total level and evenness of
expression have the largest impact of these parameters.
Higher and broader gene expression, both positively
correlated with ohnolog retention, implies greater dosage
sensitivity and pleiotropy, respectively [27,36,47-49]. The
preferential retention of duplicate genes with these characteristics - stronger dosage constraints and more diverse
interactions - supports the idea that expression dosage
balance is important after WGD, and is consistent with
other recent findings [13,24-27,45,50]. In addition,
broader gene expression reduces the likelihood of duplicate gene loss through synfunctionalization [12]. The
prediction that breadth is related to the level of pleiotropy could be further tested with protein interaction
information, which is currently lacking for Xenopus.
Having higher and broader gene expression also allows
more opportunities for partitioning paralogous expression
patterns by subfunctionalization [2,51]. Here we did not
test for evidence of expression subfunctionalization or
neofunctionalization because comprehensive expression
profiles in a closely related outgroup species are not available. But when one considers protein structure, higher
information content in terms of longer genes and more
exons could facilitate subfunctionalization, for instance
because of a larger mutational target. In yeast, retained
duplicates have longer proteins and more functional
domains than singletons [52]. In contrast, we find that
fewer exons and shorter intron length are more likely to
be retained following WGD, after taking into consideration the effect of expression and molecular evolutionary
rates. These findings suggest that subfunctionalized
regions are generally not parceled by exons in X. laevis, or
that protein subfunctionalization is subtle in this species.
It has been suggested that slowly evolving proteins may
be preferentially subfunctionalized after WGD because
they accumulate fewer substitutions over time than faster
evolving genes, thus retaining their interchangeability for
longer periods, and providing more opportunities for
subfunctionalization to occur [23]. This is despite the
observation that paralogs are often found to have higher
evolutionary rates than singletons [53,54]. Our findings
do not directly address this proposal, but we find that

Page 5 of 7

slower evolving genes (genes with lower dN and dS in S.
tropicalis) were preferentially retained after WGD, which
supports the expectations of Sémon and Wolfe [23].
Thus, in addition to supporting mechanisms based
on dosage balance and pleiotropy, our results are also
consistent with mechanisms for duplicate gene retention that involve regulatory subfunctionalization. The
observation that gene expression has a major impact
on the odds of functional persistence of ohnologs may
be in part due to the greater mutational opportunities
at the regulatory level compared with the protein-coding region. Once initial retention is achieved, for example through dosage balance or subfunctionalization,
this may subsequently decrease constraints in different
parts of the gene and thus allow further modifications
to occur for long-term duplicate gene persistence
[55,56].
Caveats exist in our interpretation of these data and
results. We used genetic data from the most closely related
diploid species available for comparison, which are not
necessarily the same as the state of these genes in the
diploid ancestor of the tetraploid species. However, we are
only assuming that diploid characters are correlated with
the ancestral state, and we argue that our interpretations
are reasonable under the assumption that the relative rates
of molecular evolution and expression between genes have
generally remained similar since speciation (e.g. that
broadly expressed genes in the extant diploid were also
broadly expressed in the ancestral diploid). It is also possible that some duplicates were misidentified as singletons
due to lacking data from one ohnolog or extensive divergence between ohnologs. We suspect that the proportion
of misclassified singletons is small based on congruence
between our database of triads and previous studies
[23,43,57,58]. Because WGD in clawed frogs is probably
the result of allopolyploidization (reviewed in [39]), these
ohnologs presumably diverged to some degree in the
diploid ancestral species before their contact in the tetraploid species. We suspect this does not have a large impact
on our designation of dyads and triads, however our findings might thus be less representative of duplicate gene
persistence in autopolyploids. It is also possible that segmental duplication occurred in some S. tropicalis loci,
adding noise to our analysis. Again, we speculate that this
would have a negligible impact on our overall conclusions
and note that, using the UniGene sequence database, the
X. laevis genes were always better BLAST hits for S. tropicalis sequences than any other S. tropicalis genes. We also
expect the dataset of S. tropicalis orthologs to be quite
comprehensive because a complete genome sequence is
available for this species [59]. Additionally, our molecular
data from dyads and triads could be biased towards slowly
evolving genes with discernable homology to outgroup

Chain et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:599
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/599

sequences from P. carvalhoi and H. curtipes. Whether or
not this is the case is difficult to know without more complete data from the outgroup species. Another concern is
that cloning biases and small EST sample size could
impact expression estimates for some loci. While this is
possible, it seems doubtful that this would substantially
affect the magnitude of the correlation coefficients.

Conclusions
We used logistic regression to evaluate the contributions
of correlated genetic parameters in a diploid species on
the odds of whether an ohnolog is retained in a closely
related tetraploid species. Our results suggest that several parameters have a significant influence on the odds
of duplicate persistence after taking other parameters
into account, and that total expression and evenness of
expression are most important. These findings are
broadly consistent with retention mechanisms involving
dosage balance and subfunctionalization. To further dissect apart the role of these retention mechanisms, one
could examine patterns of expression and evolution of
duplicate genes relative to an ortholog in an outgroup
species. For example, studies of regulatory subfunctionalization in the tetraploid could determine whether the
expression domain inferred for an ancestral gene are
divided amongst the duplicate genes in the tetraploid
[23,60,61]. A challenge in this type of study is the
assessment of the ancestral expression state, because all
orthologs have evolved since diverging from the most
recent common ancestor. A possible alternative is to
investigate protein interactions for reduced and partitioned pleiotropy among duplicates, but confirmation of
subfunctionalization would also require inference of
ancestral interactions.
