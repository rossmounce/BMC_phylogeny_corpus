Expanding whole exome resequencing into nonhuman primates
Eric J Vallender

Abstract
Background: Complete exome resequencing has the power to greatly expand our understanding of non-human
primate genomes. This includes both a better appreciation of the variation that exists in non-human primate
model species, but also an improved annotation of their genomes. By developing an understanding of the
variation between individuals, non-human primate models of human disease can be better developed. This effort is
hindered largely by the lack of comprehensive information on specific non-human primate genetic variation and
the costs of generating these data. If the tools that have been developed in humans for complete exome
resequencing can be applied to closely related non-human primate species, then these difficulties can be
circumvented.
Results: Using a human whole exome enrichment technique, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque samples were
captured alongside a human sample and sequenced using standard next-generation methodologies. The results
from the three species were then compared for efficacy. The chimpanzee sample showed similar coverage levels
and distributions following exome capture based on the human genome as the human sample. The rhesus
macaque sample showed significant coverage in protein-coding sequence but significantly less in untranslated
regions. Both chimpanzee and rhesus macaque showed significant numbers of frameshift mutations compared to
self-genomes and suggest a need for further annotation.
Conclusions: Current whole exome resequencing technologies can successfully be used to identify coding-region
variation in non-human primates extending into old world monkeys. In addition to identifying variation, whole
exome resequencing can aid in better annotation of non-human primate genomes.

Background
The role of genetic variation in establishing individual
differences is well-established. HapMap [1], the Human
Genome Diversity Project [2], and most recently the
1,000 Genomes project [3] have all sought to catalog
and classify human variation between populations.
Human genetic variation is understood to underlie
many diseases and exploited to map genetic causes. In
model organisms, genetic variation between rodent
strains has been commonly used for quantitative trait
loci mapping [4]. More recently, the genetic variation
between dog breeds has been used to map the genes
associated with phenotypic traits [5]. Yet these
approaches remain underutilized with regard to nonhuman primates. A large reason for this is the costs that

Hill Drive, Southborough, MA 01772, USA

had been associated with elucidation of polymorphism.
The historical importance of rodents in biomedical
research coupled with the clonal nature of the strains
allowed for significant meaningful genetic data to be
gathered from a relatively small population. The relatively lesser importance of the canine model in biomedical research was overcome more recently by lower
sequencing costs and again an ability to focus on breeds
as ‘type-specimens’.
As biomedical research moves into the post-genomic
era it is clear that genetic variation in model organisms
will only gain in importance. A genomic understanding
of variation has led to a re-emergence of the canine
model [6]. The importance of genetic variation in nonhuman primates is beginning to be realized also, particularly in models of infectious disease and behavioral
disorders. Genetic variation in the rhesus macaque has
been shown to affect viral replication in an HIV model

[7,8] and to affect susceptibility to malarial parasites [9].
In studies of behavioral disorders and drug addiction,
genetic variation in rhesus macaques has been identified
that explains between-individual variance in alcohol
consumption [10] and a corresponding response to
treatment [11,12], while genetic variation at the tumor
necrosis factor promoter region has been identified in
vervet monkey models of obesity [13]. Studies such as
these not only offer the hope of elucidating the genetic
factors underlying human disease, but also are important in the development of truly translational models.
Just as animal models of obesity or alcoholism are most
valid if their molecular etiologies parallel the underlying
human causes, variation affecting the response to pharmaceutical treatment or vaccine efficacy must be appreciated to make sense of study results. So far, however,
these studies of polymorphism in non-human primates
have remained focused on specific candidate genes.
Our ability to incorporate genetic information into our
animal studies is not at issue; rather, the limiting factor
has been the difficulty of obtaining genetic data. Resequencing of individual loci has been possible but can be
costly. Recently, new technologies, such as complete
exome resequencing, have emerged that promise to
greatly expand our ability to quickly and practically
identify large amounts of polymorphism. As has generally been the case with genomic technologies, exome
resequencing began with human studies [14]. Studies in
human have already been able to leverage this relatively
inexpensive technology to identify novel allele variants
associated with disease that have previously eluded
researchers [15-17] and it has quickly been applied to
numerous diseases and promises to help elucidate many
more. This method has already been extended to the
Neandertal [18], and if it can be applied to non-human
primates, this same technology may offer the opportunity to recapitulate a ‘Primate HapMap’ at a significantly
reduced cost and on a relatively short time scale.
A side benefit to a survey of polymorphism in a species is a much greater depth of genomic coverage for
that region. In humans this advantage has been relatively subtle. Because of the primacy and importance of
the human genome and institutional focus on it, it is
very high quality; resequencing surveys show differences
between individuals and populations but generally do
not impact our basic understanding and interpretation
of the genome. Non-human primate genomes, on the
other hand, have been sequenced to a much lower
depth of coverage and generally have been subjected to
reduced scrutiny. It has been established that there is an
apparent excess of pseudogenes in the chimpanzee genome [19,20] and that annotation errors abound [19,21].
As depth of coverage increases these errors will be ameliorated. While ideally this would entail a complete

resequencing of the entire genome, much of the most
important parts of the genome, certainly those that we
currently best understand, can be sequenced at depth
using a complete exome approach. It is noteworthy that
these comparative approaches have also been successful
in improving annotation of the dog genome [22].
Exomic resequencing of non-human primates thus
offers significant advantages. The existing non-human
primate genomes can be better understood and annotated and tools can be developed that will allow for the
incorporation of genetic variation into our primate models of human disease. These in turn allow for a greater
translational efficacy and a more refined use of nonhuman primate animal models. Here we take the first
steps towards realizing the promise of this approach,
demonstrating its feasibility using existing resources and
defining the parameters in which it can be successful.
These studies also shed light on the existing non-human
primate genomes and offer the beginnings of efforts to
refine them.

Results and discussion
Exomic coverage following enrichment

The SureSelect Human All Exon Kit, 38 Mb, from Agilent Technologies was used for target enrichment of a
male human (Homo sapiens), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), and rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). The 38
Mb SureSelect kit was designed on the hg18 human
genome and included the purported complete human
exome as deduced from the NCBI Consensus CDS database as well as an assortment of microRNAs and noncoding RNAs. Human DNA was from a Mbuti pygmy,
chosen to capture maximum within-species diversity
from the human genome and presumably the SureSelect
probes. The chimpanzee and rhesus macaque (of Indian
descent) represented individuals unrelated to those used
in the assembly of the genomes of their respective species. The enriched exomes were then sequenced on an
Illumina GAII using one lane each with a 72-bp pairedend protocol.
In order to assess the overall completeness of the
exome capture, each species read was aligned to the
human genome (Table 1). Read depth for each species
was consistent, with over 60% of targeted regions having
over 20 sample reads. For human and chimpanzee, 95%
of regions had over 5 sample reads, while for rhesus
macaque 95% of regions had more than 2 reads. As
expected, high exonic coverage, defined by confidently
mapped sample reads to the entirety of the exon, was
observed for human while decreasing slightly for chimpanzee and more considerably for rhesus macaque.
However, when analysis was restricted to protein-coding
regions of the exome only, excluding untranslated
regions, the rhesus coverage improved dramatically and

plaguing the Y chromosome comes from its repetitive
nature, with pseudogenes and closely related gene
families abounding [24]. This in turn results in difficulty
in assigning reads unambiguously to appropriate positions, a problem in all Y chromosome sequencing
efforts. The final effect driving the Y chromosome difficulties and the main effect driving in the X chromosome
lack of coverage is simply the smaller effective coverage
levels. Each of the autosomes offer twice the starting
material as the sex chromosomes and sequencing was
not sufficient to achieve saturation.

In addition to the differences in coverage in the
untranslated regions compared to protein-coding
regions or in the Y chromosome compared to autosomes, divergence may also play a more general role in
the ability of hybridization-based target enrichment
approaches to extend across species. For each exon the
coverage in human was plotted against the coverage of
chimpanzee or rhesus macaque sample reads against the
human genome (Figure 1). By treating the chimpanzee
and rhesus macaque sample reads simply as extremely
divergent but representative of the same genomes, it
allowed for a visualization of the effects of divergence
on relative levels of coverage. In comparing the chimpanzee to the human it is apparent that there is very little systematic bias in species coverage; almost as many
exons show greater coverage in the chimpanzee as in
human and at similar levels (Figure 1a,c). In essence, the
lack of coverage observed in chimpanzee was no greater
than that seen in humans. Coverage in both human and
chimpanzee are instead almost entirely bounded by read
depth. The rhesus macaque on the other hand shows a
loss of coverage due to divergence in addition to that
resulting from read depth (Figure 1b,d). Unlike the
chimpanzee, the vast majority of exons showing a difference in coverage between the rhesus and human sample
reads show a bias towards rhesus deficits. This suggests
that divergence levels between rhesus and human are
beginning to approach the limits for cross-species
hybridization.
This becomes clearer when coverage levels are plotted
against exonic identity to human (Figure 2). In the
chimpanzee, it is evident that there is little to no correlation between divergence and coverage (Figure 2a,c).
The coverage levels are dominated by stochastic processes at the levels of nucleotide identity (largely greater
than 97%) seen between chimpanzee and human. In
rhesus, however, a clear trend is observed (Figure 2b,d).
The greater the levels of divergence, the less likely that
coverage was observed. As divergence levels become
greater than 5% (identity less than 95%), coverage levels
begin to fall off fairly rapidly. It should be noted,

both human and chimpanzee coverage incrementally
improved (Table 1; Additional file 1). Given that
untranslated regions are known to be more divergent
between species than protein-coding regions and that
the enrichment system operates on homology, this
observation is expected. Further, when the coding exons
were transliterated to the chimpanzee and rhesus genomes and the sample reads aligned with self-genomes,
all species showed approximately 95% of the exome
with complete coverage (Table 1), though it must be
noted that for both the chimpanzee and rhesus macaque, species-specific true exons would be lost as would
legitimate exons for which current genomic sequence is
unavailable.
Using the self-self alignments, coverage was compared
to chromosomal location (Additional file 2). Across all
three species a pattern emerged wherein the Y chromosome showed significant failures. The X chromosome
also showed a greater percentage of exons without coverage than any autosome, though the difference was
much less marked. Three factors appeared to have contributed to these effects, though in different proportions.
Firstly, divergence between species is different between
the sex chromosomes and autosomes, largely a result of
male-driven mutation [23]. Just as untranslated regions
showed less coverage, the Y chromosome should be less
likely to work in cross-species homology-based
approaches. This, however, does not account for the X
chromosome nor the significant failure of the approach
in the human sample reads. Rather, the main problem

however, that even at these levels there remain significant numbers of exons that show complete coverage.
Species with greater divergence, notably new world
monkeys, are likely to suffer significantly while the other
ape species are likely to show near complete coverage.
Coverage was also compared using other metrics,
including exon length, percent coding, and GC content.
None of these factors appeared to play a role in speciesspecific coverage rates (data not shown). While not
observed in these data sets, it does not seem unlikely
that, in situations of greater divergence, one or more of
these factors may play a major role. It is important to
note that the findings here are confined to an exomic
capture strategy; they are not necessarily directly applicable to other regions. Cross-species capture of regions
of low complexity including, for example, repeats or

CpG islands, are likely to be more greatly influenced by
these factors.
Identification and comparison of within-species variation

The primary goal of whole exome resequencing is the
identification of polymorphism. The success of this
approach in humans is beginning to be felt already. At
the same time, it will be particularly useful in outbred
model organisms, especially non-human primates. This
basic conceit motivated these studies. Using the self-self
genomic alignments, it was possible to identify variation
in the individuals compared to the reference genomes
(Table 2). For the most part, results were as expected
and painted a picture of a successful approach. Total
numbers of synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs
were consistent with previous estimates. The larger

levels of polymorphism observed in rhesus macaques is
consistent with a larger effective population size. Similarly, ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphism and rates of pseudogenization via nonsense
mutations are roughly consistent with expected values
accounting for the effects of selection and genetic drift.
Notable here in particular is the ratio of heterozygous
nonsense mutations to homozygous mutations, less than
5% in human and chimpanzee and 10% in rhesus macaque. This represents, of course, not just standard expectations of genotypic frequency patterns, but also a likely
deleterious effect of homozygous pseudogenization in
many genes.
These conventionally expected results are in contrast
to frameshift mutations following an insertion or deletion. The number of human frameshift mutations and
their ratio of homozygosity to heterozygosity, while
higher than that seen in nonsense mutations, are still
generally comparable. This is confirmed when insertions

and deletions in multiples of three, resulting in the gain
or loss of amino acids but not frameshifts, are considered. In both chimpanzee and rhesus macaque, however,
we see approximately equal numbers of homozygous
and heterozygous frameshifts. This is in contrast to the
amino acid gain and loss numbers, which remain similar
to the human values. These data suggest an excess of
homozygous frameshift mutations in chimpanzee and
rhesus macaque.
The most straightforward explanation for this is that
these frameshifts do not occur in isolation and that
their action in combination ‘corrects’ the gene. This
could arise either biologically or, more likely, as the
result of local misalignments. To assess this, frameshift
mutations, as well as stop gains and losses from SNPs,
were gathered into genes. While there are some examples of these appearing in combination, by and large
these are unique events that do not appear ‘corrected’ in
their genomes. While biological formally possible, a

more parsimonious explanation for these large differences may be errors in the genome or otherwise poor or
incomplete annotations.
Inferred divergence between species and comparison to
existing genomes

The human genome is, naturally, the most complete and
high quality, in terms of both sequence confidence and
annotation, of the mammalian genomes. In order to test
whether the frameshifts observed when the chimpanzee
and rhesus sample reads were aligned against self-genomes were truly biologically representative or artifactual
results from genomic deficiencies, the chimpanzee and
rhesus macaque next generation sample reads were
aligned to the human genome (hg18). Also faux next
generation sequencing (NGS) reads were created from
the chimpanzee (panTro2) and rhesus (rheMac2)

genome assemblies and aligned to the human genome.
A summary of the observed nucleotide level variation
can be found in Table 3.
The first, and most obvious, observation from these
data is that there remain some issues in assembly. The
chimpanzee and rhesus faux-NGS reads from genomes
are effectively haploid and yet autosomal ‘heterozygous’
mutations exist. Notable here is that these assembly
errors are heavily biased towards insertions/deletions,
where they represent nearly 50% of the total insertion/
deletion events, compared to SNP or multi-nucleotide
polymorphism (MNP) events, where they represent less
than 1.5%. The effect of these ‘heterozygous’ variations,
however, does not alter the most important finding, but
rather just suggests that, if anything, it is conservative.
That primary finding is that the chimpanzee and rhesus genomes still contain numerous incorrect insertion/

deletion differences. Comparing top-line data, the chimpanzee sample reads showed 114 homozygous frameshift
deletions and 85 homozygous frameshift insertions when
aligned to the chimpanzee genome. When aligned to the
human genome these numbers were remarkably similar,
147 and 104, respectively. The most parsimonious explanation would hold that the differences between the sample reads and each of the two genomes largely overlap
and represent mildly deleterious mutations, part of this
individual’s genetic load. However, when the chimpanzee genomic sequence is aligned to the human genomic
sequence the corresponding values are 550 and 242 and
when the variants are compared there is little overlap.
What seems to be happening is that when the chimpanzee sample reads are aligned to the human genome,
more-or-less ‘real’ insertion/deletion events are being

identified. These include both polymorphisms unique to
the specific chimpanzee sequenced as well as true divergence events between the species. However, most of the
differences between the chimpanzee sequence reads and
the chimpanzee genome, rather than representing true
polymorphisms like SNP and MNP variation, though
undoubtedly some of these do exist, instead represent
errors in genomic annotation. These two sources of
error - true frameshift mutational events and errors in
chimpanzee genomic annotation - are combined in the
comparison between the chimpanzee genome and the
human genome, though the numbers are slightly higher
due to incomplete coverage in the chimpanzee sequence
reads.
Applying a similar analysis to the rhesus macaque
generates similar findings, though to a lesser degree.

There appear to be more true homozygous insertion
and deletion frameshifts in rhesus compared to human 337 and 190, respectively - but this is unexpected given
the phylogenetic relationship between the three species.
The number of apparently false insertion/deletion frameshifts - 169 and 128, respectively - are roughly similar
to that seen in chimpanzee. Further, the total differences
observed between the rhesus genome and the human
genome, 504 and 281, are very similar to the total number of differences between the chimpanzee genome and
human genome and leave fewer insertion/deletion
events unaccounted for. It is perhaps notable as well
that we would expect the rhesus genome to have an
overall poorer alignment to the human genome - resulting from both biologically ‘true’ and methodological
effects - because of the increased divergence. Indeed this
is what we observe in the initial coverage comparisons.
Two other observations from these data are worth
noting. First, this pattern does not appear to extend to
stop codon gains or losses resulting from SNPs or
MNPs. Most observed differences between the chimpanzee or rhesus macaque genomes and the human genomes are also observed in the newly sequenced samples.
Second, these errors are not insignificant. In the rhesus
macaque seemingly false frameshifts affect 200 genes; in
chimpanzee this may be the lower bound, with perhaps
another 200 frameshifted genes between the chimpanzee
and human genomes unaccounted for.

Conclusions
As initially conceived, this project focused on the relative utility of human complete exome capture technologies to determine variation in protein coding regions
within non-human primate populations. In this it is largely successful. Coverage of the chimpanzee is nearly
identical to that seen in humans, with no species-specific bias seemingly occurring. With the exception of
chimpanzee-specific duplications, it can be reasonably
asserted that complete coverage can be gained by these
approaches. For rhesus macaque, the percent coverage
declines somewhat, but nevertheless coverage between
80 and 95% should be reasonable. As expected, efficacy
is directly correlated with divergence and those regions
showing least conservation between species are the least
likely to be covered.
Based on the correlation between divergence and coverage, the cutoff for capture without bias, as seen in the
chimpanzee, seems to be around 96% similarity. From
this we should be able to interpolate that this method
will be equally efficacious for gorilla and orangutan as it
is for chimpanzee. The lesser apes, gibbons and siamangs, will show some loss of coverage and may be
strongly affected by the major genomic reorganization
events that appear to have taken place within the lineage

[25]. While most old world monkeys, notably baboons
(Papio sp.) and vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops),
should show coverage similar to rhesus macaques, new
world monkeys likely will not be particularly amenable
to this approach save for particularly highly conserved
regions. Nevertheless, these results suggest that the
development of these methods can be applied to future
studies aimed at cataloging variation in numerous biomedically important non-human primate species.
At the same time, an important secondary use of these
data is to validate and deepen our current non-human
primate genomes. On this front, it has also proven
extremely useful. Anecdotal evidence has suggested that
there are errors in the chimpanzee and rhesus macaque
genomes resulting in poor or incorrect annotations.
Most notably this has caused many genes in the chimpanzee and rhesus genomes to be annotated as pseudogenes when they are fully intact and assumedly
functional. Here we are able to identify significant numbers of situations in which the chimpanzee or rhesus
sample reads look like the human genome while the
chimpanzee and rhesus genomes harbor a frameshift.
The two samples presented here, one chimpanzee and
one rhesus macaque, by themselves are not going to fix
the annotation of their species genomes; rather, they
serve only as an initial suggestion that not all may be
well. Falsely identified polymorphisms will require many
more individuals to be conclusively called. In fact, there
is little evidence contained in this study that there is any
pervasive difference. It is also important to note that
many of the worst offenders in annotation problems are
the result of the addition of exons to genes that are not
present in humans. While the resequencing of the
human exome in another species may add exonic
sequences that are currently absent from other genomes,
it will not comment on the validity of these newly introduced exons. Indeed, while this approach will generally
be useful for conserved genes, those with recent paralogs will be missed entirely.
Yet despite its limitations, it is important to recognize
the utility of this approach. This methodology allows for
the rapid and relatively inexpensive capture of significant amounts of genetic information, both for species
with known genomes as well as for other, closely related
species without complete sequence. It allows for the
identification of polymorphism in rhesus macaques that
can be used to refine their use in translational studies
and to approach non-human primate genetic modeling
of human disease in a unique fashion. Finally, it begins
to further our understandings of the chimpanzee and
rhesus macaque genomes and will easily add depth of
coverage to the coding regions in the genomes, work
that can be easily extended to the impending gorilla,
orangutan, baboon, and vervet monkey genomes.

Whole exome resequencing is an important new tool
in the geneticist’s arsenal and one that is not reserved
for human genetic work. Indeed, where it is likely to see
some of its greatest utility is in species for which polymorphism has been largely overlooked. The fact that
tools developed for humans can be applied with reasonable confidence to non-human primates augurs well for
these species and their development as true genetic
translational models.

Materials and methods
Genomic DNA samples

Human (NA10495) and chimpanzee (NS03641) genomic
DNA was obtained from the Coriell Cell Repository.
The human DNA, line JK1033, was from an adult male
Mbuti pygmy living in the Ituri forest of northern Zaire
made available through the NIGMS Human Genetics
Cell Repository. The chimpanzee DNA was from ‘Juan’,
a 32 year old male housed at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center. Genomic DNA from an adult
male rhesus macaque of Indian descent housed at the
New England National Primate Research Center was
obtained from the NEPRC Primate Genetics Core [26].
In brief, approximately 8 ml of venous blood was collected in and EDTA-Vacutainer tube during a routine
physical. Genomic DNA was then isolated and purified
using the Flexigene kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).
Exome capture and sequencing

The SureSelect Human All Exon Kit, 38 Mb (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to capture the exomes from each of the three species using
the manufacturer’s protocols; 10 μg of genomic DNA
from each species was used. Library preparation was
performed using the NEBNext Sample Preparation Kit
(New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) using primer
and adaptor oligonucleotides from Illumina. Samples
were quality control tested using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and SYBR Green-based quantitative PCR assays.
All samples were sequenced on an Illumina Genome
Analyzer II using a 72-bp paired-read protocol. Exome
capture, library preparation and next generation sequencing were performed according to the manufacturer’s
protocols in the Biopolymers Facility, Department of
Genetics, at Harvard Medical School. Sequence reads
have been submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read
Archive (SRA038332).
Data analysis

Initial data analysis, including alignment to genome,
coverage analysis, and nucleotide-level variation analysis,
used DNAnexus (Palo Alto, CA, USA). Sequencing
reads from all three species were aligned to the human
genome build hg18/NCBI36.1. Track files containing the

genomic regions enriched in the SureSelect Human All
Exon Kit, 38 Mb were provided by Agilent Technologies. Chimpanzee sequencing reads were also mapped to
the CGSC2.1/panTro2 chimpanzee genome assembly.
Rhesus macaque sequencing reads were also mapped to
the MGSC1.0/rheMac2 rhesus genome assembly. The
genomic exome regions from human (hg18) were converted to chimpanzee (panTro2) and rhesus (rheMac2)
using the liftOver program available from the UCSC
[27]. Faux-NGS reads were generated using a 72-bp sliding window with a 1-bp step. The faux-NGS chimpanzee and rhesus genomes were then aligned to the
human genome (hg18) in the same manner as the true
NGS reads. Separately, the Bowtie package [28] was also
used to align sample reads to genomes without significantly different results.

Additional file 1: Additional Figure 1 - exonic coverage across
species. Percent coverage of coding exons are binned and presented as
a histogram. (a-c) Coverage percentages are based on alignments
between human (a), chimpanzee (b), and rhesus macaque (c) and the
human genome (hg18) with gene sequences defined by RefSeq
annotations.
Additional file 2: Additional Figure 2 - chromosomal distribution of
coverage failure. Percent of coding exons without any coverage by
chromosomal position. Y chromosome exons are consistently and
substantially more likely to show no coverage compared to autosomal
exons. X chromosome exons are also more likely to show no coverage
though to a lesser extent. Both trends hold across species.
