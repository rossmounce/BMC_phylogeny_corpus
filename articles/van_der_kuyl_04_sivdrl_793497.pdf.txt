Abstract
A pol-fragment of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that is highly related to SIVdrl-pol from drill
monkeys (Mandrillus leucophaeus) was detected in two mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) from
Amsterdam Zoo. These captivity-born mandrills had never been in contact with drill monkeys, and
were unlikely to be hybrids. Their mitochondrial haplotype suggested that they descended from
founder animals in Cameroon or northern Gabon, close to the habitat of the drill. SIVdrl has once
before been found in a wild-caught mandrill from the same region, indicating that mandrills are
naturally infected with a SIVdrl-like virus. This suggests that mandrills are the first primate species
to be infected with three strains of SIV: SIVmnd1, SIVmnd2, and SIVdrl.

Findings
To date over 30 strains of simian immunodeficiency virus
(SIV) have been isolated from African primate species and
sequenced [1]. Mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) are quite
exceptional among African monkeys in that they harbour
two distinct SIV strains, designated SIVmnd1 and
SIVmnd2, with a separate geographic distribution [2,3]
(see also Figure 1A). SIV infections are mostly non-pathogenic in their natural hosts. SIVmnd1, despite high virus
levels in chronically infected mandrills, has only a small
effect on the T-cell counts, and primary infection does not
induce clinical symptoms [4,5]. However, two cases of
immunodeficiency were reported in mandrills after longterm (>18 years) SIV infection [6]. In 2003, a 20-year old
male captive mandrill (mandrill CAS) housed at Artis Zoo
(Amsterdam, The Netherlands), suffering from heart fail-

ure and poor general condition, was found to be positive
for serum SIV antibodies. Inspection of the other three
mandrills of his group, a ten-year old female (mandrill
REB) and their offspring (mandrills RAF, 3 years old and
HAB, 2 months old), showed that the female and one of
the offspring (HAB) were also SIV antibody-positive.
Both EDTA-plasma and PBMC (isolated with the OptiPrep system (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway)) was obtained
from the animals for further analysis. Our goal was to
investigate whether the monkeys were virus carriers, and
which strain of SIV they harboured. To detect both
SIVmnd1 and SIVmnd2, we designed two nested primers
sets based on published pol gene sequences that amplify
an RT fragment of 282 nucleotides (Table 1). Nucleic
acids were isolated from PBMC by a procedure using silica

with the 3'primer and AMV-RT (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). PCR amplifications were performed
using the following protocol: denaturation for 5 min at
95°C and amplification for 35 cycles (first PCR) or 25
cycles (second PCR) of 1 min at 95°C, 1 min at 55°C, and
2 min at 72°C, followed by an extension of 10 min at

(Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif.). Sequencing of at least four

clones per sample was done with the Bigdye Terminator
Cycle Sequencing kit and an ABI 377 automated
sequencer (both from ABI, Foster City, Calif.), using M13

monkeys were M. sphinx [9,10]. In addition, the cytochrome B sequences were indistinguishable from the
recently described northern mandrill haplotype (Figure
1B) [10], suggesting that the captive animals descended
from founders originating from a locale north of the
Ogooué River (see Figure 1A). SIV-pol fragments could be
amplified from PBMC of both adult mandrills CAS and
REB with the primer set specific for SIVmnd2, but not with
SIVmnd1 specific primers. However, analysis of the
cloned fragments showed that these were 96–97% identical to SIVdrl-1FAO (GenBank acc. no. AY159321) isolated
from a drill monkey (Mandrillus leucophaeus), with a lower
sequence identity to SIVmnd2 (± 85% to GenBank acc.
no. AF367411), and to SIVmnd1 (<64% to GenBank acc.
no. M27470). Although SIVmnd2 and SIVdrl are more
closely related to each other than the two SIVmnd strains,
SIVdrl has several mismatches with the PCR primers
designed for detection of SIVmnd2. This could explain
why one seropositive animal was tested as PCR-negative.
Therefore, we designed a new primer set that amplifies the
same gene fragment based on the SIVdrl sequence (Table
1). Reanalysis of the mandrill PBMC samples with this
drill-specific primer set again resulted in only two positive
samples from the two adult animals: mandrills CAS and
REB. Sequence analysis confirmed the high similarity to
SIVdrl-1FAO (97%), and a lower similarity to SIVmnd2
(87%). SIV pol fragments from both mandrills were 98–
99% similar to each other. Clones obtained from a single
animal with the two primer sets were not identical to each
other (98–99% identity), suggesting that each PCR amplified a subset of the virus population (Figure 1C).
Mandrills presently inhabit Cameroon, Gabon, and the
southwestern part of the Republic of Congo. Two mito-

chondrial haplotypes are described in this species, separated by the Ogooué River in Gabon [10]. Interestingly,
the distribution of mandrill SIV strains follows approximately the same geographic distribution, with SIVmnd1
being present in the southern part of the mandrill range,
and SIVmnd2 in the northern part. Drill monkeys are
found in Nigeria and Cameroon separated from the mandrill territory by the Sanaga River (Figure 1A). Mandrills
and drills are currently believed to be non-sympatric, but
it is not unlikely that the situation was different in the
past.
SIVmnd2 and SIVdrl are closely related, and both are
equidistant from SIVmnd1. SIVmnd2 is found in northern mandrills, which are closest to the current drill habitat. A wild-caught mandrill from south Cameroon was
found to harbour a SIVdrl virus strain [3,11], suggestive of
cross-species transmission [11]. Multiple cross-species
transmissions are now believed to obscure the evolution
and distribution of SIV strains in African primate species
[1]. SIV cross-species transmissions are ongoing, and African green monkey strains have recently been detected in
patas monkeys and baboons [1,12,13], species that are
found in close proximity to each other.
All four mandrills examined here were born in captivity.
Male CAS was born in 1983 at the now closed Wassenaar
Zoo (The Netherlands), and moved to Artis Zoo in 1986.
The female, REB, was born in Budapest Zoo (Hungary),
and moved to Artis Zoo when she was 5 years old. Their
offspring, RAF and HAB, were both born in Amsterdam.
Exposure to drills during their lifetime is unlikely as none
of the zoos kept drills (M. leucophaeus) at any time. Drills
are rare in European zoos, and only the zoos of Nikolaev

(Ukraine) and Saarbruecken (Germany) reported keeping
both drills and mandrills in a 1992 survey [14]. So, it is
improbable that the Artis mandrills acquired SIVdrl from
a recent contact with captive drills. Another way of acquiring a drill SIV strain could be if one of the monkeys was
actually a hybrid between a drill and a mandrill. Hybridisation between different species of Cercopithecinae is possible, and offspring is sometimes fertile depending upon
the exact species. The genus Mandrillus cannot hybridise in
the wild, as the habitats of the two species do not overlap,
but it does so in captivity. The morphologic differences
between female drills and mandrills are less obvious than
those between males and are mainly noticeable in the colouration of the muzzle and the size of the animal. A single
hybrid M. sphinx × M. leucophaeus has been reported from
Vienna Zoo, Austria, in a 1992 survey [14], and two
hybrid M. leucophaeus × M. sphinx were described from a
Wildlife Rescue Centre in Cameroon [15]. Mitochondrial
sequencing as performed in this study cannot alone be
used to resolve hybridisation, as it only characterises the
mother lineage. The male mandrill is, however, unlikely
to be a hybrid as its description fits exactly that of a male
mandrill. The female was also listed in the Artis Zoo database records as a non-hybrid. She was registered with the
European studbook programme (ESB) for mandrills
supervised by the Budapest Zoo, Hungary, and was born
from registered mandrill parents.

differences separate the consensus pol-sequence from the
SIVdrl reference sequence (Figure 1D). However, to gain a
deeper insight into the characteristics and evolution of
this virus strain, a full-length sequence, or at least additional sequences of the gag or env regions, would be
required. Only then could it be determined whether the
virus carried by the captive mandrills is really SIVdrl or a
novel recombinant virus. Several recombinant SIVs have
been described in naturally infected primate species (see:
[1]). Unfortunately, further sequence analysis is difficult
due to shortage of material as the monkeys were euthanized soon after the SIV antibody test results became
known.

coordination.

Acknowledgements
Because SIVdrl was also found in a wild-caught Cameroonian mandrill [3,11], it is plausible that a SIVdrl-like virus
is naturally present in mandrills, making them the only
primate species that is naturally infected with three strains
of SIV. The presence of SIVdrl in one of the two adult captive mandrills occurred probably through transmission
from a wild ancestor, and this animal probably infected
the other mandrill once joined in Artis Zoo. Sexual and
mother-to-child transmission of SIV in mandrills have
been reported to be rare [16,17]. Here, in offspring born
to a SIV-positive mother SIV could not be detected. The
persistence of maternal antibodies could explain why the
2-month old young tested seropositive, although there is
a possibility of the animal having a viral copy number
below the detection limit of the PCR assay. Transmission
of SIV between mandrills and drills could have taken
place either by biting or sexual contacts. SIVmnd1 is
mainly transmitted between males during aggressive contacts [17], and might also be transmitted when fighting off
other receptive primates species. Sexual transmission
could have occurred during interbreeding. Each of these
possibilities requires an overlap of habitats, which could
have existed in the past.
If we assume that SIVdrl(Artis) left Africa at least ten years
ago (when the female was born in captivity), its genome
conservation is remarkable: only 2 conserved amino acid
