Abstract
Background: Retrotransposons have been known to involve in the remodeling and evolution of
host genome. These reverse transcribing elements, which show a complex evolutionary pathway
with diverse intermediate forms, have been comprehensively analyzed from a wide range of host
genomes, while the information remains limited to only a few species in the phylum
Platyhelminthes.
Results: A LTR retrotransposon and its homologs with a strong phylogenetic affinity toward CsRn1
of Clonorchis sinensis were isolated from a trematode parasite Paragonimus westermani via a
degenerate PCR method and from an insect species Anopheles gambiae by in silico analysis of the
whole mosquito genome, respectively. These elements, designated PwRn1 and AgCR-1 – AgCR-14
conserved unique features including a t-RNATrp primer binding site and the unusual CHCC
signature of Gag proteins. Their flanking LTRs displayed >97% nucleotide identities and thus, these
elements were likely to have expanded recently in the trematode and insect genomes. They
evolved heterogeneous expression strategies: a single fused ORF, two separate ORFs with an
identical reading frame and two ORFs overlapped by -1 frameshifting. Phylogenetic analyses
suggested that the elements with the separate ORFs had evolved from an ancestral form(s) with
the overlapped ORFs. The mobile potential of PwRn1 was likely to be maintained differentially in
association with the karyotype of host genomes, as was examined by the presence/absence of
intergenomic polymorphism and mRNA transcripts.
Conclusion: Our results on the structural diversity of CsRn1-like elements can provide a
molecular tool to dissect a more detailed evolutionary episode of LTR retrotransposons. The
PwRn1-associated genomic polymorphism, which is substantial in diploids, will also be informative
in addressing genomic diversification following inter-/intra-specific hybridization in P. westermani
populations.

Background
Retrotransposons, which comprise a major portion of
eukaryotic genomes, replicate progeny copies into new
genomic loci via reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate [1]. As intragenomic parasites, retrotransposons
have been known as a potent causative agent involved in
various harmful biological processes such as insertional
mutagenesis [2] and ectopic recombination [3]. Conversely, cumulative data have evidenced that these elements play significant roles in the formation and
maintenance of host chromosomes [4]. The sporadic
expansion of retrotransposons can also introduce
genomic/phenotypic variants, which lead to speciation in
the long evolutionary terms [5,6]. Retrotransposons are
subdivided into two large categories, long-terminal-repeat
(LTR) and non-LTR retrotransposons, according to overall
structures, and the elements with LTR seem to be the most
abundant type in invertebrates. The LTR retrotransposons
include multiple groups, as have been distinguished by
comparing their own gene products [7,8].
In addition to the typical LTR retrotransposons, multiple
elements with unusual structural features have recently
been isolated from various genomes, such as CsRn1 of
Clonorchis sinensis [9], Xena of Takifugu rubripes [10], Gmr1
of Gadus morhua [11] and Saci-2 of Schistosoma mansoni
[12]. The CsRn1 and Saci-2 elements were found to
encode Gag with unique motifs of CHCC and CCCH,
respectively, instead of the conventional CCHC. Gmr1
produced a Pol protein, in which the functional protein
domains lie in an order identical to those of Ty1/copia elements (protease [PR]-integrase [IN]-reverse transcriptase
[RT]-RNase H [RH]). Retrotransposons of the most
ancient Xena group had a single open reading frame
(ORF) containing a RT domain but lacking any other
enzymatic domain. Taken together, these facts have suggested that the category and evolutionary episode of the
diverse reverse-transcribing elements are more complex
than currently understood.
Paragonimus westermani is a hermaphroditic, digenetic
trematode that lives as adult in the lungs of carnivorous
mammals. This parasite causes pulmonary and cerebral
diseases in humans and is one of the most medically
important flukes. The natural populations of P. westermani in northeast Asian countries have three different levels
of polyploidy in their genomic contents, i.e., di-, tri- and
tetrapolyploidy, displaying variations in morphology,
allozyme patterns, and nucleotide sequences of ribosomal
and mitochondrial DNAs [13]. The Paragonimus genome
contains retrotransposons, which belong to various retrotransposon groups including the CsRn1 clade [14]. CsRn1like retrotransposons have been detected largely in trematodes and insects [9,12,15]. With the unique Gag motif
and amino acid conservation, members of the clade

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/482

showed heterogeneity in their coding profiles. Furthermore, Boudicca and Saci-3 of S. mansoni contain a third
ORF resembling envelope protein (ENV) of errantivirus
and retrovirus [12,16].
The genomic distribution of CsRn1-like elements have
been well described in C. sinensis and S. mansoni, with
their unique structural features [9,12,16]. Nevertheless,
molecular information on this distinctive clade is highly
limited to address their evolutionary episodes. In this
study, we isolated a novel CsRn1-like LTR retrotransposon
in the P. westermani genome and analyzed its intra- and
inter-genomic distribution patterns among the parasite
populations with different karyotes. Differential replication activity of the Paragonimus element was examined by
detecting the presence or absence of mRNA transcripts
and intergenomic polymorphism introduced by the element. The molecular characters of multiple retrotransposons homologous to the element were also analyzed
from the genomes of an African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, which had recently been released [17], and a
fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, in order to gain more
detailed information on the invertebrate-specific CsRn1
clade. The heterogeneous expression strategies were found
to be substantial within the unique clade, and the possible
evolutionary relationships between elements with distinctive coding profiles were shown by phylogenetic analyses.

Results
Isolation of CsRn1-like retrotransposons from P.
westermani and A. gambiae
Using the previously described degenerate primers, retrotransposon-related sequences had been isolated in P. westermani [14]. These sequences represented various LTR
retrotransposons belonging to the multiple clades of
Metavirus (Ty3/gypsy group) including the CsRn1 clade, of
which members seemed to expand uniquely in lower animal taxa such as Insecta and Trematoda [9,12]. One clone
(Pw-D-13 [GenBank:BZ715464]) showing the highest
sequence identity with CsRn1 was used as a probe in the
screening of the genomic DNA library of the parasite. As
shown in Figure 1, the full-unit LTR retrotransposon
encompassing the probe sequence was determined and
named PwRn1 (P. westermani Retrotransposon1) by comparing sequences of two positive clones (λPw-13-1 [GenBank:AY237161] and λPw-13-2 [GenBank:AY237162]).
The PwRn1 copy in λPw-13-2 was 5,400-bp long and was
bound by direct repeats of 4 bp (5'-GGCG-3') known as
target site duplication (TSD). The internal sequence was
corrupted by several stop codons introduced by indels
and/or base substitutions, although its flanking 5'- and 3'LTRs had an identical size (381 bp) and a high degree of
sequence identity (99.7%). The internal coding regions
were further retrieved from different PwRn1 copies (35
copies [GenBank:EU622539 – EU622573], Avg. diver-

Figure 6).

gence = 0.051 ± 0.002) (Figure 1A). The coding profile of
PwRn1 was predicted with one of these sequences
(PwRn1-Int-29 [GenBank:EU622567]), which contained
the longest ORF of 3,585 bp encoding a single 1194-aa
polypeptide. The corrupted nucleotides in the 5'- and 3'upstream regions of the ORF were corrected by comparing
them with the equivalent regions in a consensus sequence
determined from the 35 sequences. The gag-pol boundary
region was further confirmed by sequencing the corresponding cDNAs (Figure 1B).

The genomic sequences of A. gambiae in the GenBank
database were examined by using the amino acid
sequence of CsRn1 Gag protein as a query (TBLASTN algorithm). The nucleotide sequences of matching entries
were analyzed via a series of BLASTN searches to determine the full-unit retrotransposons encompassing each of
the gag sequences. The integrity and identity of the elements were verified by detecting a TSD pair at the boundary regions, and by comparing lengths and nucleotide
sequences of their LTRs, respectively. These procedures
isolated a total of 14 CsRn1-like retrotransposons from
the mosquito genome, which were designated AgCR-1 –

AgCR-14 (A. gambiae CsRn1-like Retrotransposon) (Table
1). The complete sequences were used as a BLAST query to
retrieve additional copy sequences from the genome. The
overall structures and coding profiles were predicted, as
described above (Figure 2). One-half of the AgCR elements were found to be identical to the CsRn1-clade
members previously reported [15] (Table 1). CsRn1-like
elements could not be retrieved from the genomic
sequences of D. melanogaster, other than the retrotransposon on AE003787 [9], named DmCR-1 in this study.
Functional motifs and structural features of PwRn1 and
AgCRs
TSD detected in all of the CsRn1-like elements were found
to be 4 bp, although there seemed to be no specific or
preferential nucleotide in selecting the insertional targets
among copies of each element and among the AgCR types
(Table 1). The short inverted repeats of 3 bp, found at
both ends of LTR in most retrotransposons (5'-TGT...ACA3') [18], were slightly modified either to 5'-TGT...AAA-3'
or to 5'-TGT...ATA-3' (Additional file 1). The LTR pairs
flanking each of the AgCR elements displayed >97%
nucleotide identities, suggestive of their recent expansion
in the mosquito genome [19]. The putative primer-binding site of these elements for the synthesis of the first
cDNA strand (5'-TGGTGAG/CCCCGT/A-3') was complementary to the nucleotides at the 3'-end of bovine tRNATrp. An additional priming site (polypurine tract) for
the synthesis of the second cDNA strand was also found
in the direct upstream region of 3'-LTR.

The internal regions of these elements contained ORFs
with different expression strategies for their autonomous
retrointegration. PwRn1 had an ORF similar to that of
CsRn1, in which the gag and pol genes were fused together
in a single frame (Figure 1). Of the 14 AgCR elements analyzed, nine elements utilized two ORFs overlapped by -1
frameshifting to encode the Gag and Pol proteins, while
the other six elements contained two ORFs with an identical reading frame, which were intervened by a short
nucleotide sequence ranging from 60 to 165 bp (Figure
2). The amino acid sequences of Gag proteins in retrotransposons generally diverge very rapidly so that they display a low level of sequence identity to one another,
except
for
the
functional
Cys-His
signature
(CX2CX4HX4C; CCHC) [20]. The proteins, however,
showed a high degree of amino acid conservation over
their entire lengths in these CsRn1-like retrotransposons.
They had the unique CHCC signature (CX2HX9CX3C) in
the C-terminal regions, while it was imperfect in 3 elements, AgCR-5, -7 and -9. The α-helix-rich secondary
structures of the Gag proteins were similar to those of the
other Ty3/gypsy-like LTR retrotransposons (Additional file
2). The enzymatic domains contained in the Pol proteins
were also well conserved with the conventional motifs/
signatures: DT/SG tripeptide of PR, F/YXDD tetrapeptide
of RT, DAS tripeptide of RH, and HHCC and DDE signatures of IN (data not shown). A series of LTR retrotransposons have an additional motif in the C-terminal region
of IN, which is implicated in non-specific binding to the
target site and/or to LTR via the best-conserved GPY/F residues [21,22]. This motif could also be detected in the cor-

responding proteins of PwRn1 and AgCRs with the
exceptions of AgCR-7 and -14. Neither the chromatin
organization modifier domain (chromodomain) nor
ENV-like protein was detected in these elements.
Phylogenetic analysis of CsRn1-like retrotransposons
We obtained an alignment of Pol proteins from a total of
48 elements including the 15 elements isolated in this
study. Amino acid positions for the three functional
domains (RT, RH and IN; 510 aa) were concatenated and
used in a phylogenetic analysis with the quartet-puzzling
maximum likelihood method. The representative elements belonging to the previous eight clades of Ty3/gypsylike LTR retrotransposons [22], as well as those of CsRn1
clade [9,12], were selected for the analysis. As shown in
Figure 3, each of the sequences was well separated into the
corresponding clades with significant quartet puzzling frequencies. The PwRn1 and AgCRs were categorized into the

tightly conserved CsRn1 clade with a high level of quartet
puzzling support (91%), as was predicted by the similarities in the primary structures of the Gag and Pol proteins.
PwRn1 formed a subclade with its trematode neighbors
(supporting value, 80%). The AgCR elements were further
segregated into four distinct clusters and those with separated ORFs were monophyletically distributed in the tree,
even though the supporting value was relatively low
(53%; the elements were marked with †). Saci-2 of S. mansoni, which encodes an unusual Gag protein with the
CCCH motif [12], occupied a unique phylogenetic position. Another tree based on the Gag sequences of CsRn1like elements showed a topology similar to that of the Pol
tree (boxed tree in Figure 3), while the phylogenetic relationships especially among the Anopheles elements with
different expression strategies could be resolved more evidently with the rapidly evolving Gag sequences. The tree
proposed that Anopheles elements with the separated ORFs

have evolved from an ancient form(s) with two overlapped ORFs (91% support).
Genomic distribution and mobile potential of PwRn1
The copy number of PwRn1 was estimated over 1,000 per
haploid Paragonimus genome via dot blotting (Figure 4A).
A Southern blot analysis showed that these PwRn1 copies
are interspersed throughout the genome, rather than
being tandemly arrayed or being clustered at limited loci

(Figure 4B). However, the blotting could not distinguish
the distribution patterns of PwRn1 between diploid and
triploid genomes, mainly due to the high copy number
and resulting smeared hybridization signals. For a more
detailed comparison of PwRn1-occupied loci, IRAP analyses were conducted with the individual genomic DNAs
and PwRn1 LTR-specific primers (Figure 5). Numerous
bands were amplified from genomic loci intervened
between two copies of PwRn1. The patterns were found to

be homogeneous among the triploid individuals and
almost all of the triploid markers were detected in at least
one of the diploid genomes, especially with the Korean
origin (see the bands marked with white circles in Figure
5). Conversely, polymorphic markers were substantially
observed among the diploid genomes at intra- and interpopulation levels. Analyses of more parasite individuals
(up to 15) showed similar results (data not shown). Given
the fact that the sporadic replication of an active retro-

transposon introduces intergenomic polymorphism [23],
this observation may reflect a differentially preserved
mobile potential of PwRn1 depending on the karyotype of
its host genome; the element has maintained the ability to
produce progeny copies in diploids, whereas it has ceased
to retrointegrate into new genomic loci in the triploid
populations. In accordance with this suggestion, mRNA
transcripts of the element were detected in a diploid population, but not in a triploid one (Figure 6). The intra-

genomic expansion of retrotransposons initiates by transcribing their mRNAs using host RNA polymerase. By
adapting to this unique replication mode, host defense
mechanisms have diversely evolved by focusing on the
protection of transcription and/or destruction of mRNA
transcripts, including chromatin modification and RNA
interference. Therefore, PwRn1 was likely to be suppressed
at the initial transcription stage in the triploid population,
although no relevant mechanism could be addressed in
this study.

Discussion
Since the first detection of LTR retrotransposons with an
unusual capsid protein in a trematode and insect species
[9,24], a series of similar elements have been isolated
from genomes of the other trematodes and insects. They
share unique properties such as PBS for t-RNATrp, 4 bp of
TSD and tight amino acid conservation in the encoded
proteins. The most conspicuous feature, nevertheless, can

be found in the amino acid sequences of Gag proteins. In
general, the first ORF contained in various retrotransposons diverge rapidly so that they display low levels of
sequence identity to one another, except for the active
Cys-His motif (CX2CX4HX4C) [20]. However, the proteins
of CsRn1-like elements have been known to conserve a
novel sequence motif of CX2HX9CX3C (CHCC), instead
of the conventional CCHC motif. These facts have suggested that members of this clade are originated from an
intermediate form of reverse-transcribing elements, which
have emerged in the common ancestor of the monophylyl
ecdysozoan and lophotrochozoan animals. Retrotransposons characterized from the lung fluke and mosquito
possessed all of these features and thus, further supported
the notion that these elements are selectively expanded in
the lower animal taxa.

(VLP), which is thought to be an important intermediate
in retrotransposition [25]. The origin and functional relevance of Gag found in the CsRn1-like elements could not
be properly addressed, because neither cellular nor the
other retrotransposon-related protein was detected during
homolog searches based on the BLAST algorithm and
Hidden Markov models. Considering the well-conserved,
α-helix-rich secondary structure (Additional file 2) and
the active replication of these elements including CsRn1
[26], the proteins seem to have nucleic acid-binding
capacity to form VLPs. Malik and Eickbush [7] have proposed the chimeric origin of LTR retrotransposons and
retroviruses, between a preexisting element and non-LTR
element/host gene. This may reflect the genetic flexibility
endogenous in the mobile elements to generate novel
functional/structural variants. A gag gene equipped in the
preexisting element is likely to have been substituted by a
presently unidentified host gene with the unusual motif
during the evolutionary start point of CsRn1-like elements.
Different expression strategies were observed among the
CsRn1-like elements (Figure 1 and 2; see also [15]). A single primary transcript is responsible for the production of
multiple retrotransposon proteins, which are essential for
the autonomous replication of the corresponding ele-

ment, and is subjected to ribosomal frameshifting to
maintain a proper ratio between the Gag and Pol proteins
[27]. Genetic events including insertion/deletion of single
nucleotide around the frameshifting region are occasionally attributable to the generation of retrotransposons
with a single fused ORF. The Gag and Pol proteins are produced by proteolytic cleavage of a single translation product in the cases of single-ORF variants [28,29]. The variant
form will replace the previous one in the host genome, via
the highly efficient VLP formation [29]. The structural variation was not detected with the multiple PwRn1 copies
retrieved by PCR. The ancient copies with two overlapped
ORFs might have decayed in the Paragonimus genome,
mainly due to the low propagation rate. Otherwise, diagnostic base substitutions in priming regions of the variant
copies might lead to a failure in the amplification of the
corresponding DNA segments.
Retrotransposons generally show very low retrotransposition and excision rates, and their expansion is largely
restricted to germ cells and/or an early developmental
stage [18]. These elements, however, become unstable
under specific circumstances and can rapidly expand in
the host genomes by increasing their replication frequency. The mobile potential of PwRn1 seemed to be differentially preserved among P. westermani populations;

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:482

the element maintained its activity in diploids, while a
majority of the activity had been suppressed in triploid
individuals (Figures 5 and 6). In association with the origin of the triploid worms, an allopolyploidic hybridization occurred in ancestral diploids at the intra- or
interspecies level has been suggested as a relevant
genomic event ([13] and references therein). IRAP markers shared in the diploid and triploid worms are likely to
represent genomic loci flanked by PwRn1 copies in the
putative ancestral diploids, and may provide further
genomic evidence supporting the proposed mechanism.
Together with biotic/abiotic stresses such as aridity [30],
polyploidization can boost the mobile potential of various retrotransposons [31,32]. Therefore, it was unexpected to find that PwRn1 is less active in triploid
genomes. Host genome surveillance for retrotransposons
is likely to be reinforced in association with an increase in
genomic dosage [33]. Alternatively, PwRn1 itself would
give a feedback effect as a mechanism to compensate for
the amplified copy number, following the hybridization
process. Phylogenetic and comparative analyses with the
multiple PwRn1 copy sequences will be informative to
elucidate the evolutionary status/mode of the element
among the Paragonimus populations with different polyploidy.
There have been various reports on the comparison of P.
westermani genomes to address the issue regarding the origin of polyploid genomes (reviewed in [13]). Molecular
data such as the nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial
and ribosomal DNAs dichotomized the genomes into the
northeast (China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan) and south
(the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia) Asian groups,
but failed in establishing more detailed relationships
among the northeast populations with different polyploidy [34]. The retrointegration of retrotransposons is an
irreversible event and the integration site is randomly
selected [35,36]. These characteristics of mobile elements
are particularly suitable for the comparative population
studies at the intra- and interspecies levels [37,38]. In this
study, we provided molecular evidence demonstrating
genomic conservation and/or diversification between
Korean diploids and triploids by analyzing intergenomic
distributions of PwRn1 (Figure 5). The data suggests that
IRAP and locus-specific typing of active retrotransposons
can be an informative genetic marker in exploring the
flow of haplotypes among P. westermani populations, and
in elucidating the controversial hypotheses on the origin
of the triploid populations. In plants, transposable elements are believed to be reactivated very early following
polyploid formation and thus contribute to genetic diversity in the polyploidy species [41]. However, understanding on the role of these elements in polyploidy evolution
is just beginning to emerge. The polyploid genomes are
less common in animals than in plants. Our results on the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/482

suppressed mobile activity of PwRn1 in the triploid Paragonimus genomes can boost research to examine the evolutionary impacts of retrotransposons in polyploid
animal genomes.

Conclusion
With the completion of genome projects from numerous
eukaryotic organisms, comprehensive studies on the
mobile genetic elements have been conducted with the
whole genomic sequences. These studies have broadened
our knowledge on the dynamics and impacts of retrotransposons in the host genomes. Despite the rapid accumulation of data, however, only limited information is
currently available from a few species in the wide phylum
Platyhelminthes. It is apparent that these invertebrate animal genomes contain diverse retrotransposons and that
these elements are actively involved in the remodeling
and diversification of their host genomes. Our results on
the CsRn1-like elements of P. westermani and A. gambiae,
especially in association with the diversified expression
strategies, can make a significant step toward a better
understanding of evolutionary episode within the unique
CsRn1 clade of LTR retrotransposons, which is specifically
expanded in the lower animal taxa. The differentially preserved mobile potential of PwRn1 and resulting genomic
polymorphism in diploid individuals will also be helpful
in designing a comparative genomic study with the northeast Asian populations of P. westermani.

Methods
Parasite
Experimental dogs were orally challenged with the metacercariae of P. westermani, which were collected from naturally infected crayfish in endemic areas of Korea
(Haenam, 2n; Bogil-do and Youngam, 3n) and China
(Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, 2n) [39]. Five months after
the infections, adult worms of the parasite were harvested
from the dogs' lungs. The worms were washed five times
with physiological saline at 4°C and used for the extraction of DNA and RNA with the Wizard DNA Purification
Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and TriZol reagents
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturers' instructions. Materials from diploid worms
(Haenam, Korea) were commonly used in this study; otherwise the sources were specifically indicated. The use of
animals was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of
Korea Food and Drug Administration (protocol number
NIH-05-09).
Isolation of a CsRn1-like retrotransposon from P.
westermani
The retrotransposon-related sequences were retrieved via
a degenerate PCR method from the P. westermani genome,
as described previously [14]. Of the sequences obtained, a
clone (Pw-D-13), that showed a significant degree of

Page 10 of 13

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:482

sequence identity with CsRn1 was selected for further
characterization. Genomic DNA library of the parasite
constructed using the lambda FIX II vector system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA. USA) was screened with the DNA probe
according to the standard procedure of plaque-lift hybridization. The inserts of two positive clones were amplified
by long-range PCR using primers designed from the vector
regions (5'-CTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGTCG-3' and
5'-CCCTCACTAAAGGGAGTCGACTCG-3') and LA Taq
polymerase, under the standard cycle condition (Takara,
Shiga, Japan). The amplified products were digested with
Kpn I and Xho I, and were cloned into pBluescript II SK(-)
phagemid (Stratagene) for sequencing. The nucleotide
sequences were automatically determined with the ABI
PRISM 377 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA) and the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Reaction Kit (Perkin Elmer Corporation, Foster City,
CA, USA). To ensure the accuracy of the reactions, nucleotide sequences from both strands were determined. Contig sequences were obtained by overlapping the sequence
information. These contigs were then compared with one
another to determine the full-unit of a retrotransposon
encompassing the Pw-D-13 clone, which was designated
P. westermani retrotransposon 1 (PwRn1).
In silico identification of insect retrotransposons
homologous to CsRn1
Whole genomic sequences of A. gambiae and D. melanogaster deposited in the GenBank were surveyed by
BLAST algorithms using the amino acid sequences of
CsRn1 Gag protein, which showed a unique Cys motif [9],
as a query. The hits showing amino acid positive values
greater than 45% throughout the whole query sequence
were subject to further analyses to determine the full-units
of retrotransposons encompassing each of the gag genes.
Multiple scaffold sequences were compared with one
another and then, a common genetic element contained
within them was isolated. The terminal repeats flanking a
protein-encoding internal region were determined by analyzing the sequences with bl2seq at National Center for
Biotechnology
Information
(NCBI,
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and further verified by recognizing the duplicated target sequences from the direct
upstream and downstream regions of the elements. BLAST
searches with the entire nucleotide sequences of the elements were followed to confirm their integrity and to
retrieve additional copy sequences from the identical
databases. The coding profiles and conserved protein
domains were predicted using ORF Finder at NCBI and
InterProScan programs at European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan),
respectively. The homology patterns were also determined
by a series of BLAST searches against the non-redundant
genomic/protein databases of the GenBank.

Southern and dot-blot hybridization of PwRn1
Genomic DNAs isolated from P. westermani adult worms
(5 μg per each) were digested with restriction enzymes,
Acs I, Sac I and Sfu I. After being separated on a 0.8% agarose gel, the restricted DNA fragments were transferred
onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) by capillary action in 10
× SSC. The blots were hybridized with the Pw-D-13 probe
enzymatically labeled with the ECL Direct Labeling Kit
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The labeling, hybridizing, and signal detection conditions were determined
under the manufacturer's instructions. For stringency
washing, the membrane was washed twice in 0.1 × SSC
containing 6 M urea and 0.4% SDS at 42°C for 20 min,
and twice in 2 × SSC at room temperature for 5 min.

Various amounts of the Pw-D-13 DNA fragment were
blotted onto a nylon membrane, according to the standard procedure of dot-blot hybridization. The membrane
was hybridized with the genomic probe of P. westermani,
which was prepared by sonicating the genomic DNA into
small DNA fragments between 0.5 and 2 kb. For a singlecopy control, a portion of the Paragonimus cysteine protease gene [GenBank:U70537], with a size of approximately 700 bp, was amplified from the parasite genome
by PCR using a gene-specific primer pair (5'-TCAGTTGTCTTGTTGTCGTGG-3' and 5'-TGCCTGTTTCTCCTCATTCTTG-3') and blotted onto the membrane. Probe
labeling and hybridizing conditions were identical to
those for Southern blot hybridization. The intensities of
signals were measured using the LAS-1000plus system
(FUJIFILM, Tokyo, Japan) and compared with those of the
control gene.
Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR)
Total RNAs were extracted from the diploid and triploid
adult worms (10 worms per each) and treated with the
RNase-free DNase (GIBCO BRL, Rockvile, MD, USA).
Reverse transcription and following amplification of
PwRn1 transcripts were carried out with the total RNAs
and retrotransposon-specific primers, using RNA PCR Kit
(AMV) (Ver. 2.1; Takara) under the manufacturer's
instructions. The primers used were as follows: 5'-AGAGAGATGTGGCTACAGCG-3' and 5'-GTTTAAGTCGTGGACCTCAG-3'
for
gag;
5'GCAGGTTGACACCAGACAAG-3'
and
5'-ATCGGTTAACGGTCGGATAC-3' for rt; 5'-GTCGATGCAATCCGTTGGAC-3' and 5'-CCAGTGCACCCTACGACCTG-3' for in;
5'-GGCCATGTACGTTGCTATCC-3' and 5'-CAGAGAGAACAGTGTTGGCG-3' for β-actin gene. The absence of
any contaminating DNA was confirmed by preparing
reactions without reverse transcriptase during the first
round of cDNA synthesis and the β-actin gene was
selected for a house-keeping gene control. The reaction
products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis.

Inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP)
Primers were designed to match the 5'- and 3'-ends of a
consensus PwRn1 LTR sequence in the outward directions, respectively (LTR-5R, 5'-AGGCAGGCCAGTGAAATCT-3'
and
LTR-3F,
5'CGACTTAGTGCAACGAGCAC-3'). Genomic DNAs were
individually extracted from diploid and triploid worms.
The IRAP PCR was performed with reaction mixtures containing 20 ng of the genomic DNA, 1 μM of each primer,
0.2 mM of each dNTP precursors, 1.6 mM of MgCl2, and
1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Takara) in 2 mM Tris-HCl
buffer (pH 8.0). PCR cycling parameters were as follows:
4 min at 94°C; 35 cycles of 40 sec at 96°C, 40 sec at 56°C,
and 2 min at 72°C; 10 min at 72°C. The PCR products
were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels
(NuSieve 3:1 agarose; Cambrex Bio Science, Rockland,
ME, USA) and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide.
Phylogenetic analysis
Pol protein sequences of LTR retrotransposons were
aligned with ClustalX and optimized with GeneDoc programs. The regions corresponding to each of the RT, RH
and IN domain sequences were selected from the alignment, in order to increase the analytical resolution, compared to that obtained by using RT sequences alone
[22,40]. The resulting concatenates comprising approximately 510 amino acid positions were adopted in a phylogenetic analysis for the construction of maximum
likelihood tree using the quartet method implemented in
TREE-PUZZLE (Ver. 5.2). The analytical options were as
follows: JTT model for substitution, estimation of invariant site proportion from the input data, 1,000 puzzling
steps assuming rate heterogeneity with eight gamma categories (the gamma distribution parameter alpha was estimated from the data set). Indels between pairs of
sequences were regarded as missing data. Tree construction was performed by the neighbor-joining method. Gag
sequences of the CsRn1-clade members were similarly
examined by the phylogenetic approach. The phylogenetic trees were displayed by the TreeView program.
