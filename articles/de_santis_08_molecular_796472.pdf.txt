Abstract
Background: Myostatin (MSTN) is a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily
that negatively regulates growth of skeletal muscle tissue. The gene encoding for the MSTN peptide
is a consolidate candidate for the enhancement of productivity in terrestrial livestock. This gene
potentially represents an important target for growth improvement of cultured finfish.
Results: Here we report molecular characterization, tissue expression and sequence variability of
the barramundi (Lates calcarifer) MSTN-1 gene. The barramundi MSTN-1 was encoded by three
exons 379, 371 and 381 bp in length and translated into a 376-amino acid peptide. Intron 1 and 2
were 412 and 819 bp in length and presented typical GT...AG splicing sites. The upstream region
contained cis-regulatory elements such as TATA-box and E-boxes. A first assessment of sequence
variability suggested that higher mutation rates are found in the 5' flanking region with several SNP's
present in this species. A putative micro RNA target site has also been observed in the 3'UTR
(untranslated region) and is highly conserved across teleost fish. The deduced amino acid sequence
was conserved across vertebrates and exhibited characteristic conserved putative functional
residues including a cleavage motif of proteolysis (RXXR), nine cysteines and two glycosilation sites.
A qualitative analysis of the barramundi MSTN-1 expression pattern revealed that, in adult fish,
transcripts are differentially expressed in various tissues other than skeletal muscles including gill,
heart, kidney, intestine, liver, spleen, eye, gonad and brain.
Conclusion: Our findings provide valuable insights such as sequence variation and genomic
information which will aid the further investigation of the barramundi MSTN-1 gene in association
with growth. The finding for the first time in finfish MSTN of a miRNA target site in the 3'UTR
provides an opportunity for the identification of regulatory mutations on the expression of this
gene.

Background
The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily
encompasses a number of peptides, such as inhibins and
activins, which share a similar structure and a relatively

conserved amino acid sequence. Transforming growth factors are involved in important biological functions,
including cell growth and differentiation [1]. Myostatin
(MSTN), formerly known as growth differentiation factorPage 1 of 15

8, is a member of the TGF-β superfamily recently isolated
from murine muscle tissue by McPherron et al. [2]. The
biological activity model proposed for MSTN is experimentally supported by gene inactivation and revealed a
negative correlation between MSTN expression and
growth/number of muscle fibres [2]. The lack of evident
non-specific defects in null-MSTN mice suggests that
mammalian MSTN physiological functions are essentially
confined to skeletal muscle. To corroborate this hypothesis, the MSTN gene is found expressed almost exclusively
in skeletal muscle and heart of higher vertebrates [2,3].
Alternatively, piscine MSTN transcripts have been ubiquitously detected in tissues such as muscle, gill, brain, kidney and gonad, highlighting that in lower vertebrates
MSTN is possibly involved in several developmental and
physiological functions [4,5]. However, MSTN activity has
been successfully inhibited in model fish species via N-terminal pro-peptide over-expression, morpholino, or double strand RNA interference, resulting in some degree of
hypertrophic and/or hyperplasic muscle mass increase.
This suggests that regulation of skeletal growth has
remained the principal developmental role of MSTN
across all vertebrates [6-8].
The MSTN gene has been cloned and characterized in a
large number of high value commercial fish species such
as atlantic salmon [9], shi drum [10], rainbow trout [11],
gilthead sea bream [12], white bass [13], Mozambique
tilapia [13], catfish spp. [14-16], European sea bass [17],
striped bass [18], white perch [18], orange spotted
grouper [19], Japanese sea perch [20] and croceine croaker
[21]. In fish, this gene consists of three exons and two
introns. Exon 1, encoding for the N-terminal signal
sequence for secretion, contains the highest inter-specific
variability, while exons 2 and 3 are highly conserved
across species and are translated into the pro-peptide and
C-terminal bioactive dimer [15,21]. Alternative forms of
MSTN have been independently isolated in zebrafish, gilthead sea bream, fugu and salmonid spp. [9,11,22,23].
Different rates of identity shared between alternative
MSTN isoforms suggests that at least two events of duplication occurred in finfish. A first event, which separated
MSTN-1 and MSTN-2, occurred early during teleost evolution, while a second event, likely due to tetraploidization,
occurred in salmonids (MSTN1a-2a; MSTN1b-2b) [24].
According to Rodgers et al. (2007), the new nomenclature
proposed for the MSTN gene family has been adopted in
this study.
The desire to select fast growing strains for the rapid
improvement of livestock production in selective breeding programs has encouraged the identification of genes
with a putative role in the enhancement of growth. Several
authors have attempted to establish a quantitative correlation between production trait variability and genetic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/82

markers. For example, a single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) occurring at intron 3 of the chicken growth hormone gene was associated with a 16.8% enhancement of
body weight [25], and the "long allele" of a microsatellite
described at the cattle growth hormone receptor promoter
corresponded to a 6.9% production improvement compared to the "short allele" [26]. Therefore, targeting the
improvement of a trait under quantitative genetic control
with a single-gene approach (marker assisted selection)
ensures more predictable and consistent outcomes compared to widely used traditional breeding techniques,
reflecting an increasing demand for additional genes to be
characterized in commercial animal production species.
Because of the unquestionable involvement of MSTN in
differentiation and proliferation of muscle fibres, MSTN
gene is considered a candidate for livestock growth
improvement. However, while several authors have studied phenotypic implications of naturally occurring mutations in terrestrial livestock [27-31], only a few studies
have described polymorphisms in the piscine MSTN gene.
Maccatrozzo et al. [10] detected variation in a Simple
Sequence Repeat (SSR) present at the 3'UTR of shi drum
(Umbrina cirrosa), whereas Kocabas et al. [15] described
several synonymous and non-synonymous mutations in
the catfish MSTN gene, including a length polymorphism
of a CAG-microsatellite present at exon 1. Surprisingly,
neither microsatellites in non-coding regions (probable
source of variation in traits under quantitative genetic
control such as growth [32]), nor variation at the exons
have been investigated in association with growth traits in
finfish thus far.
Barramundi (Lates calcarifer) is a high-value aquaculture
fish endemic and widely farmed in south-east Asia and
Australia and with increasing aquaculture interest in
Europe and North America [33,34]. On account of the
increasing worldwide aquaculture importance of this species, a growing number of farmers have expressed interest
in maximising production through selective breeding.
Ongoing experiments carried out in our research group
have revealed extremely large size variability in F1 hatchery juveniles grown under identical conditions (SmithKeune et al., unpublished data). The possibility that a certain amount of the observed variability might be
explained by means of additive effects at the MSTN gene
encouraged us to commence this investigation. The aims
of this study, therefore, were to characterize the MSTN-1
gene in barramundi and to understand the gene's tissuespecific expression pattern. The project also aimed to
identify possible regions of sequence variability among
barramundi individuals that could be tested for their correlation with phenotypic growth in future studies.

showed that nucleotide sequence produced significant
alignments (above 90%) with MSTN-1 gene sequences in
Genbank, displaying extremely high identity with most
perciformes. Within the gene sequence, higher rates of

exons 2 and 3.

The translated amino acid sequence (376 aa) was used as
a query for a BLASTP search, showing significant similarities with most vertebrate MSTN genes, including chicken
and human (Fig. 3). Protein alignment between species
representative of various classes of vertebrates showed
that the amino acid sequence obtained in the current
study coded for a protein with homologous structure to
that observed in other vertebrate MSTN containing a propeptide domain (residues 41–258) and a bioactive
domain (residues 282–376). One putative conserved proteolytic RXXR motif for the releasing of the mature peptide (matching with RARR, residues 264–267) was
identified along with two putative conserved glycosyla-

Sequence characterization and analysis
PCR amplifications from barramundi tissues resulted in
six fragments of the following sizes: 925 bp (Myo-pro/
Myo-L8), 384 bp (Myo-up1/Jcu-R), 765 bp (Myo-up2/
Myo-L1), 1068 bp (Myo-up3/Myo-L3), 749 bp (Myoup5/Myo-L5) and 831 bp (Myo-up8/Myo-utr). The relative position of each primer is shown in Fig. 1. The whole
consensus sequence (4484 bp) (Fig. 2), including 5' and
3' flanking region, was obtained by merging overlapping
PCR fragments and has been deposited in Genbank [35]
(accession number EF672685). Gene structure of the
putative barramundi MSTN-1 gene (LcMSTN-1) was
deduced by cross-comparing gDNA consensus sequence,
the entire cDNA sequence from a single clone and the gilthead sea bream MSTN-1 gene [12]. Three exons were
shown to be encoded by this gene in barramundi. Exon 1,
exon 2 and exon 3 were 379, 371, 381 bp in length,
whereas the enclosed introns were 412 and 810 bp,
respectively. Distinctive sites were recognized: i) a typical
start codon (ATG) in exon 1; ii) a stop codon (TGA) in
exon 3; iii) distinctive splicing sites (GT...AG) at the exonintron boundaries; iv) a putative TATA box 137 bp
upstream from the ATG start codon (28 bp upstream the
putative start transcription site); v) two putative E-boxes
(CANNTG motif), 811 and 398 bp upstream from the

tion sites (N) in the propeptide domain (residues 73 and
223) (Fig. 2). Finally, as for all vertebrate MSTN proteins,
13 conserved cysteines were found, nine of which were in
the bioactive domain, a characteristic shared by all the
TGF-β superfamily.
Characterization of micro RNA target sites
Micro RNA (miRNA) target site analyses carried out on the
barramundi 3'UTR genomic sequence revealed one putative site interacting with dre-let-7a, dre-let-7b and dre-let7c, members of the let-7 miRNA family originally isolated
in zebrafish (Fig. 4) [36]. A similar analysis of target sites
in other teleost species indicated that all perciform MSTN1 putatively interact with some members of the let-7
miRNA family. In particular, interaction of dre-let-7c was
common to most species, with the only exception being
gilthead seabream (data not shown). Atlantic salmon also
displayed (with weak support value) a putative target site
for dre-let-7d in a different 3'UTR region than the perciform counterpart, whereas no sites of interaction were
found in zebrafish. An alignment of putative perciform

interaction sites highlights 100% identity in the sequence
complementary to the 5' critical region of the let-7 family
(known as "seed") (5'-UGAGGUAG-3') (Fig. 5).
Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic analyses of the MSTN gene and related
sequences indicates that LcMSTN-1 clusters with high support (100%) with that of Nile perch MSTN-1 gene in the
perciform clade. Phylogeny of MSTN coding regions
shows a clear separation between teleost orders (siluriformes, salmoniformes, perciformes) and the second
MSTN isoform, which are all grouped together with
extremely high support (Fig. 6). The resulting tree also
suggests that the sequence isolated in this study is the
LcMSTN-1 isoform. The overall bootstrap values are reasonably high providing strong statistical support for the
main structure of the tree, which is also supported by the
known phylogenies of the represented species. However,
the perciform branch was not fully resolved based purely
on phylogeny of MSTN coding regions. Increased resolution of perciformes MSTN-1 evolutionary relationships

kidney and liver (Fig. 8). The amplification products were
identical in length and of the expected size. Cloning and
sequencing the resulting 265 bp bands revealed that the
fragments belonged to the LcMSTN-1 coding region. Transcripts were widely represented in each analyzed tissue by
bands of variable intensities, suggesting that a possible
differential expression pattern might occur among tissues.
After 30 cycles, LcMSTN-1 transcripts were clearly visible
in muscle and eye, intermediately detected in liver and
kidney and weakly observed in brain, spleen and intestine. However, after 35 cycles, LcMSTN-1 transcripts were
present in each tissue with very weak intensity in gills and
heart. Amplification of RT control reactions showed no
amplification products (data not shown).

sylation sites have also been demonstrated to be actively
involved in the regulation of TGF-β superfamily bioactivity [38,39]. Finally, the RXXR motif (matching with RARR
in LcMSTN-1) identified at residues 264–267 represents
the putative cleavage site to release the processed mature
peptide. The putative functional and structural roles associated with the above mentioned sites are corroborated by
the extremely high identity maintained throughout the
evolution of vertebrates.
With regard to the nucleotide sequence, LcMSTN-1 shares
high similarity with most known perciform MSTN-1, particularly in the coding region. The 5' flanking region contains putative regulatory sites including a TATA box,
located 28 bp upstream of the transcription starting point,
and two E-boxes. The TATA box surrounding sequence (±
30 bp) is highly conserved across teleost species, sharing
in this region 100% identity with other available sequence
from perciformes. The E-box 1 is also found conserved in
the same group of species that share the identical TATA
box region. E-boxes have been shown to interact with the
helix-loop-helix proteins of myogenic regulatory factors
enhancing the expression of the MSTN gene in vertebrates, therefore representing interesting target sites for
the screening of regulatory mutations [40].

Discussion
In the present investigation we isolated and characterized
the MSTN-1 gene from barramundi. The LcMSTN-1 contains three exons and two introns, as for all known vertebrate MSTN, and encodes for a 376 amino acid long
peptide. Like other members of the TGF-β superfamily,
MSTN is synthesized as a precursor peptide, which
includes an N-terminal signal sequence, pro-peptide and
bioactive domain [2]. Results of the BLASTP query show
that LcMSTN-1 protein structure is consistent with that
previously reported by other authors [15,20]. In accordance with past studies, the peptide sequence is highly conserved in the C-terminal bioactive domain, where nine
cysteine residues are present [1,2,20]. The nine conserved
cysteines are involved in the formation of interchain
disulphide-bonds, essential for the dimerization of the
two MSTN subunits [37]. Two putative glycosylation sites
were also identified in the pro-peptide domain. GlycoMarker

A first screening of sequences from different Australian
populations highlights that LcMSTN-1 is variable in the 5'
flanking region, where four SNPs have been identified.
These point mutations, however, did not appear to result
in changes in putative functional sites. A lack of major
polymorphisms in the coding region suggests that functional or loss-of-function mutations might be rarer in fish

than in higher vertebrates [28,31]. However, the number
of individuals targeted in this study did not provide
enough elements for robust conclusions. As wild fish are
continuously utilized in hatcheries for the production of
barramundi larvae, it is essential in future studies to
screen a larger number of individuals/populations and
understand the spatial genetic variability of LcMSTN-1. A
better understanding of LcMSTN-1 variability will allow
selection of appropriate brood-stocks in an experimental
MSTN-based selective breeding program. Finally, it is
notable that repeated motifs of significant length were not
found in non-coding regions. In particular, from sequence
alignment emerges that intron 2 contains a (CA)n-SSR
(Simple Sequence Repeat) which is observed to be
extremely conserved across perciformes and salmonids,
once again suggesting a possible functional role (i.e. gene
expression regulation [32]). In barramundi the CA-microsatellite is reduced to five repeated units.
The central finding of this study is the identification of a
miRNA target in the 3'UTR. MiRNA are small non-coding
RNA (~22 nucleotide) that can actively regulate the
expression of several genes at the post-transcriptional
level by physical interaction with complementary mRNA
sequences [41]. Sites presenting perfect complementarity
at position 2–8 of the 5' end of the miRNA are likely to be
targeted by the miRNA itself [42], but sites with one mismatch in the target sequence have also been considered as
seeds [43]. Herein, a site located in the 3'UTR of LcMSTN1 and highly conserved across perciformes represents a
putative target for the let-7 miRNA family. To support this
finding, members of the let-7 family have been predicted,
via evolutionary conservation, to interfere with the TGF-β
signalling pathway [43]. To highlight the importance of
gene expression regulation at the post-transcriptional
level, a recent study has described a polymorphism in the
3'UTR of the sheep MSTN gene that generates an illegitimate new target site for two miRNAs [44]. This point
mutation was statistically associated with an increased
hypertrophy of muscle fibres, therefore defining a new
class of regulatory mutations. The homologous site of
interaction, herein described for the first time in finfish,
represents a possible valuable target for the identification
of fast growing haplotypes. Further, miRNAs may also
play a pivotal developmental role inhibiting the translation of MSTN in lower vertebrates in a tissue-specific manner.
It has been well established that the piscine MSTN gene
evolved subject to different events of duplication and in
some cases tissue-specific differential expression of
MSTN-1 and MSTN-2 was detected [9,11,22,23,45]. Loss
of physiological function might have evolved in parallel
to MSTN duplication events as, for example, in the case of
salmonids where different MSTN isoforms are specifically

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/82

expressed in distinct tissues [9,11,45]. However, it is possible that miRNAs have a crucial role in regulating the
expression of piscine MSTN genes. The latter hypothesis is
strongly supported by miRNA differential expression
detected in teleost fishes [46] and might also explain the
loss of the miRNA target site observed in salmonids compared to the sister clade of perciformes. Therefore, it
would be useful in future studies to target the miRNA
pathway as a source of variation for the identification of
fast growing mutants and the improvement of finfish productivity. In fact, although mutations occurring at MSTN
miRNA target sites have been shown to affect muscularity
in higher vertebrates [44], the post-transcriptional regulatory pathway has not been targeted in finfish to date.
The phylogeny of the MSTN gene has been widely
assessed by previous authors and is largely consistent with
the current study [12,20,21,47]. However, former investigations have been carried out on protein sequence of a
limited number of species [12,21]. Thanks to recent intensive submissions of piscine MSTN genes to public databases, we present the first attempt to assess the utility of
MSTN introns as a phylogenetic nuclear marker. In
accordance with the tree presented by Ye et al. [20], phylogeny of coding regions was unable to produce a fully
resolved perciform clade. On the contrary, when coding
regions were analyzed in conjunction with introns a better
picture of perciformes evolutionary relationships
emerged. In particular, largemouth sea bass, Japanese sea
perch and orange spotted grouper were clustered together,
with high bootstrap values supporting the monophyly of
this clade. The resolution within the perciformes using the
complete MSTN-1 gene is consistent with that of Smith et
al [48] based on 4036 bp of mitochondrial and nuclear
sequence, demonstrating that MSTN also provides strong
phylogenetic signal and has utility as a marker for future
broader piscine phylogeny studies.
The principal biological activity of MSTN is to negatively
regulate growth of muscle fibres [2]. The suppression of
hyperplasic and hypertrophic growth of somites triggered
by MSTN has been experimentally demonstrated in vertebrates, where the inactivation of protein synthesis leads to
an extraordinary increase of muscle mass both in fish and
mammals [2,6]. However, in mammals MSTN physiological activity seems to be restricted to skeletal muscle and
cardiomyocytes and major loss-of-function natural mutations have been identified, causing giant phenotypes
without any other detectable side effects [3,28,49]. On the
contrary, previous investigations are contrasting with
regard to MSTN expression in spleen, kidney, liver and
intestine of teleost fishes. In particular, tissues that
showed no MSTN transcript detection included kidney in
Japanese sea perch [20], spleen in croceine croaker [21],
gonad, liver and spleen in gilthead seabream [12] and adi-

pose tissue, liver, spleen, intestine and kidney in shi drum
[10]. In the present study, MSTN transcripts were
expressed at some level in each target tissue examined.
However, in gills and heart the expression was so weak
that 35 amplification cycles were needed to visualize a
PCR product. These results do demonstrate, however, that
in adult barramundi at least, MSTN is widely expressed in
many tissues at the same time.
Although one aim of the present investigation was simply
to determine the qualitative tissue-specific expression of
the MSTN gene and quantitative conclusion without verification from quantitative PCR might be hazardous, it was
clearly evident that LcMSTN-1 transcripts were more
highly expressed in barramundi skeletal muscle than in
other tissues. This is a similar finding to other fish studies
where MSTN expression has been shown to be highest in
skeletal muscle, and sometimes, one or other tissues like
brain, eye or liver [9,10,16,20]. Unlike many other studies, however, we observed some level of simultaneous
LcMSTN-1 expression in skeletal muscle, eye, gill, heart,
brain, muscle, gonad, intestine, spleen, kidney and liver.
The fact that LcMSTN-1 transcripts were not found to be
simultaneously expressed in such a wide range of nonmuscle tissues in other fish might have depended on several factors including methodology (i.e. number of amplification cycles – in tissues where the transcripts are very
weak a difference of five cycles is significant), tissue preservation (RNA degrades relatively quickly) or age effects
on expression (MSTN expression intensity is significantly
correlated with developmental stages [15]).

Conclusion
The LcMSTN-1 gene was successfully isolated and characterized. The gene displays high sequence identity and
equal organization both with other teleost fish and mammalian counterparts. Putative functional sites have been
recognized in LcMSTN-1, either in the translated protein
and nucleotide sequence. LcMSTN-1 transcripts are ubiquitously expressed in several tissues with greater intensity
in skeletal muscles. The high similarity observed across
teleost, mammalian and avian species indicates that the
main biological function of MSTN (muscle growth suppressor) has been evolutionary conserved to some extent,
although some physiological activities might have been
lost/acquired during the evolution of vertebrates. However, the successful association between MSTN gene variation and growth traits observed in higher vertebrates
corroborates the importance that the MSTN gene might
have for the improvement of aquaculture finfish production and encourages further investigations. Furthermore, a
putative miRNA site of interaction identified in this study
and localized in the 3'UTR suggests a possible new direction to be undertaken for the improvement of finfish productivity.

Methods
Sample collection
Three one-year-old barramundi were collected from a
local barramundi farm. Fish were euthanized by diluting
1 ml clove oil per litre of water. Brain, muscle, liver, intestine, heart, eye, spleen, gills, gonads, and kidney were dissected, immediately preserved in liquid nitrogen and
subsequently stored at -80°C until further processing. Fin
clips were also removed and preserved in 100% ethanol.
Furthermore, fin clips from seven wild-caught barramundi were collected from seven separated Australian
locations (Ashburton River (Western Australia – WA), De
Grey River (WA), Roebuck Bay (WA), Ord River (WA),
Daly River (Northern Territory), Gulf of Carpentaria
(Queensland – QLD), Boyle River (QLD)) to provide an
opportunity for maximum levels of genetic variability and
preserved in 100% ethanol.
Cloning and characterization of the MSTN gene
Total genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from barramundi fin clips by digestion in CTAB buffer with 20 mg/
ml proteinase K for 1 hour at 60°C, followed by a phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol purification protocol
[50]. Genomic DNA was quantified by comparison to
DNA concentration standards after 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis using the ImageJ 1.33 software package
(Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, MA) and
re-suspended in ddH2O to a concentration of 10 ng/μl.

Twelve specific oligonucleotides were designed based on
conserved regions of known MSTN-1 sequences in perciformes (Table 1). Four pairs of primers, Myo-up1/Jcu-R,
Myo-up2/Myo-L1, Myo-up3/Myo-L3, Myo-up5/Myo-L5
were designed. For the amplification of 5' and 3' UTRs
(untranslated regions) two pairs of primers, Myo-pro/
Myo-L8 and Myo-up8/Myo-utr (Table 1), were designed.
PCR reactions were carried out in a final volume of 50 μl
using the following final concentration of reagents: 1 × of
10× PCR buffer (Qiagen), 2 mM of MgCl2, 0.4 mM of
dNTP mix, 0.4 μM of each primer, 0.75 units of Taq
polymerase (Qiagen) and 10–20 ng of gDNA. The amplification cycle, performed in a MJ research thermocycler,
consisted of 2 min pre-denaturation at 94°C followed by
32 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 45 sec, annealing at
specific temperature (Table 1) for 45 sec and elongation at
72°C for 1 min, followed by 10 min final extension at
72°C. The PCR fragments of expected size obtained from
these amplifications were separated on 1.5% agarose gels,
purified and cloned into a pGEM-T Easy Vector System
(Promega, Madison, WI). Clones containing the insert of
expected size were isolated and sequenced in both directions using T7 and SP6 universal primers. Fragment
sequences were analysed and spliced in to a single consensus sequence using Sequencher version 4.2 (GeneCode
Corp) and visually analysed for polymorphisms. In addi-

tion, the whole cDNA was sequenced in both directions
from three single clones and compared to the gDNA
sequence as a control.
Genomic sequence: nucleotide analysis
The resulting LcMSTN-1 consensus nucleotide and amino
acid sequences were first compared with those available
from the Genbank public database using BLASTN and
BLASTP, respectively [51]. The intron-exon boundaries
were deduced by alignment with cDNA sequence amplified using the Myo-up1/Myo-L3 and Myo-up3/Myo-L5
primer pairs (Table 1). Translated amino acid sequences
were aligned for analysis of putative conserved functional
residues by ClustalW using MEGA 3.1 [52]. Putative fulltranscripts sequences, starting and stop codon and other
functional sites where deduced by comparison with
known MSTN sequences.
Micro RNA target sites identification
To find potential miRNA target sites, a further analysis of
non-coding regions was carried out using the miRanda
software package [53], using default settings and SHUFFLE mode ON (1000 random shuffled analysis). The
entire collection of Danio rerio miRNA available from a
public non-coding RNA database [52,54-56] was used as
a query and run against LcMSTN-1 3'UTR. Output parameters considered for the scope of this investigation were: i)
score; ii) energy and iii) z-value (index of rudimental statistical test for the reliability of results) [53]. Threshold
score and energy were set at 100 and -19 kcal/mol respectively. MiRNA showing a putative interaction with LcMSTN-1 3'UTR were then tested on representative teleosts
species using default thresholds and parameters. Finally,
presumed target sites of interactions were visually confirmed by screening sequence site conservation between
relatively close species.

Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis of evolutionary relationship
between LcMSTN-1 and other vertebrates was performed
using two optimality criteria. Firstly, a maximum parsimony analysis with tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR)
branch-swapping and gaps treated as missing characters
was undertaken in PAUP version 4.08 [57]. Secondly, a
neighbour-joining (NJ) tree was constructed using the
Jukes-Cantor model of sequence evolution in MEGA 3.1
[52]. Support for both types of trees was obtained by
bootstrapping data (1000 replicates). Sequences were
rooted using Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Gallus gallus
as outgroups.
Expression analysis: RNA extraction, complementary DNA
synthesis and Reverse Transcriptase PCR
Total RNA was extracted from preserved barramundi tissues with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RNA
quality and DNA contamination were verified by 1.5%
agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA concentration and purity
was checked on a spectrophotometer using 230/260 and
260/280 nm wavelengths. Nucleic acid samples were
diluted in ddH2O to a concentration of 100 ng/μl. First
strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized
from the same amount of total RNA (1 μg) for each sample using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase enzyme
(SS-III) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A mixture of (T)25 oligos and random hexamers were used as primers for the
reverse transcriptase reaction. A further reaction was carried out without the SS-III (-RT) enzyme as a control. 2 μl
of the resulting cDNA and -RT control were used as templates for the RT-PCR. RT-PCR reactions were prepared in
a final volume of 25 μl with primers Myo-up3 and MyoL3, designed to encompass intron 2 in order to eliminate
potential positive results due to genomic contamination.
Concentrations of reagents were maintained consistent
with the ones previously used for gDNA amplifications.

To confirm the specificity of the amplification, fragments
