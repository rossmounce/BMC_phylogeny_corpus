Abstract
Background: Plastid replacements through secondary endosymbioses include massive transfer of genes from the
endosymbiont to the host nucleus and require a new targeting system to enable transport of the plastid-targeted
proteins across 3-4 plastid membranes. The dinoflagellates are the only eukaryotic lineage that has been shown to
have undergone several plastid replacement events, and this group is thus highly relevant for studying the
processes involved in plastid evolution. In this study, we analyzed the phylogenetic origin and N-terminal
extensions of plastid-targeted proteins from Lepidodinium chlorophorum, a member of the only dinoflagellate
genus that harbors a green secondary plastid rather than the red algal-derived, peridinin-containing plastid usually
found in photosynthetic dinoflagellates.
Results: We sequenced 4,746 randomly picked clones from a L. chlorophorum cDNA library. 22 of the assembled
genes were identified as genes encoding proteins functioning in plastids. Some of these were of green algal
origin. This confirms that genes have been transferred from the plastid to the host nucleus of L. chlorophorum and
indicates that the plastid is fully integrated as an organelle in the host. Other nuclear-encoded plastid-targeted
protein genes, however, are clearly not of green algal origin, but have been derived from a number of different
algal groups, including dinoflagellates, streptophytes, heterokonts, and red algae. The characteristics of N-terminal
plastid-targeting peptides of all of these genes are substantially different from those found in peridinin-containing
dinoflagellates and green algae.
Conclusions: L. chlorophorum expresses plastid-targeted proteins with a range of different origins, which probably
arose through endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). The N-terminal extension of
the genes is different from the extensions found in green alga and other dinoflagellates (peridinin- and
haptophyte plastids). These modifications have likely enabled the mosaic proteome of L. chlorophorum.

Background
Establishment of the plastid by endosymbiosis of a cyanobacterium was a key event in the evolutionary history
of eukaryotes. An ancient primary endosymbiosis gave
rise to photosynthethic organelles in members of the
Viridiplantae, rhodophytes (red algae) and glaucophytes
[1-5]. Such primary plastids (bound by two membranes)
were subsequently spread to other protist lineages
through a series of eukaryote-eukaryote secondary and

tertiary endosymbiotic events, resulting in a large diversity of photosynthetic lineages [6,7].
Both red and green algae have been involved in secondary endosymbioses. The exact number of secondary
endosymbiotic events involving red algae remains controversial [8-12], with theories ranging from a single
uptake in the common ancestor of all algal lineages harboring secondary plastids derived from a red alga (the
chromalveolate hypothesis) to serial independent
uptakes of red algal plastids or transfer of red algaderived plastids between algal groups [4,8,13,14]. Green
plastids of secondary origin are known to be found in
three distinct algal lineages: the chlorarachniophytes, the

photosynthetic euglenids and in the dinoflagellate genus
Lepidodinium. The chlorarachniophytes are marine
phototrophic amoeboflagellates belonging to the lineage
Cercozoa within the eukaryote ‘supergroup’ Rhizaria
[15-17], while the euglenids are the only photosynthetic
lineage in the ‘supergroup’ Excavata [18-20]. The dinoflagellate genus Lepidodinium contains a secondary
chlorophyll a and b containing plastid derived from a
green alga [21-24]. The distant evolutionary relationships between the chlorarachniophyte, euglenid and
dinoflagellate host lineages indicate that their plastids
originate from three distinct endoymbiotic events
[7,18,25,26].
One of the main processes during plastid establishment is massive transfer of genes from the endosymbiont to the host nucleus, and the invention of protein
trafficking machineries that involve protein synthesis in
the host cytoplasm and direction of proteins to the plastids [27,28]. Consequently, the plastids themselves
encode only a minor fraction of the genes necessary for
proper plastid function. In phototrophic organisms harboring primary plastids, these proteins are targeted back
to the plastid by a transit peptide that directs the proteins across the double membrane [29]. In algae with
secondary and tertiary plastids, proteins need (i) to have
the N-terminal bipartite presequences that code for a
signal peptide that directs the protein to the host endomembrane system and a transit peptide to lead the protein to the plastid, and (ii) to be transported across 3-4
membrane layers resulting from the establishment of
the organelle [5,30].
Intriguingly, several algal lineages, such as the red
algae Cyanidioschyzon merolae, the land plant Arabidopsis thaliana, various chromalveolates and the chlorarachniophyte Bigelowiella natans, seem to have nucleusencoded plastid-targeted protein genes originating from
phylogenetically divergent algae [15,31-36]. The plastid
proteomes of such organisms are therefore not acquired
only from their current plastids, but may also include
proteins originating from other sources.
Dinoflagellates are unique among eukaryotic lineages
in having undergone several plastid replacement events
[37-41], and are therefore a key source of insights into
the process of transformation of an endosymbiotic alga
into an organelle. The most canonical dinoflagellate
plastid type contains chlorophyll c and the pigment peridinin and is likely the ancestral plastid of the group
[9,42]. However, in several dinoflagellate lineages the
peridinin-containing plastid has been lost, giving rise to
a range of heterotrophic species, or has been replaced
by plastids acquired from other algal groups (i.e. haptophytes, heterokonts, cryptomonads, and green algae).
The level of plastid integration varies among dinoflagellates, ranging from fully integrated permanent plastid

Page 2 of 11

replacements such as the tertiary haptophyte-derived
plastids found in Karenia and Karlodinium species [31]
to less integrated plastids (i.e. permanent plastids that
have not been degenerated) or temporary associations
[39,41]. Lepidodinium is the only dinoflagellate genus
that has replaced the red alga-derived peridinin-containing plastid by a green plastid [21,37], and thus represents a model for studying events occurring in the
process of plastid replacement. In this context, an
important issue is to understand how protein-targeting
signals of pre-existing proteins from the original plastid
have adapted to the green plastid environment. Furthermore, another key question concerns the evolutionary
origins of plastid-targeted protein genes in the host genome in Lepidodinium. In fact, the plastid-targeted
GAPDH gene in L. chlorophorum was recently shown to
be of haptophyte origin [24], demonstrating that plastidtargeted genes in this species may originate from
sources other than the original peridinin-containing
plastid or the current green algal plastid.
We addressed these questions by investigating the
nuclear-encoded plastid proteome of L. chlorophorum.
We present 22 plastid-targeted genes identified in a
cDNA library. The complete N-terminal extensions
were obtained by 5’- RACE experiments of 20 of the
22 plastid-targeted genes. Phylogenetic analyses of the
plastid-targeted protein genes reveal a mosaic plastid
proteome in L. chlorophorum; many of the L. chlorophorum sequences showed apparent affinities to homologs from green algae, haptophytes, heterokonts, and
peridinin-containing dinoflagellates. The N-terminal
presequences (likely associated with plastid targeting)
of L. chlorophorum differ from those of other dinoflagellates in having relatively low levels of serine and
threonine residues, a high level of acidic residues and
possibly an abnormally long hydrophilic region near
the N-terminal end.

Results
Plastid-targeted proteins in L. chlorophorum

4,746 clones from the L. chlorophorum cDNA-library
were sequenced from the 5’-end, and 22 plastid-targeted
protein genes were identified (Table 1). These correspond to a wide range of plastid-associated processes,
and include components of photosystem II (PsbO, PsbP,
PsbR), the gamma subunit of ATP synthase, ferredoxin
B, ferredoxin NADP reductase, the small subunit of
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
carboxylase/oxygenase
(RuBisCO), RuBisCO activase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, phosphoribulokinase and several isoforms of light
harvesting proteins. In addition, three genes encoding
enzymes involved in the non-mevalonate isopentyl disphosphate (isoprenoid biosynethesis) pathway were
identified.

The plastid-targeted genes have several evolutionary
origins

Phylogenies of all identified plastid-targeted proteins
were inferred including sequences from members of as
many major photosynthetic lineages as possible. Both
Maximum likelihood, Bayesian analyses and distance
methods were applied, resulting in qualitatively similar
results. In five phylogenies - PsbO, PsbP, PsbR,
RuBisCO activase and plastid lipid associated protein
kinase (PAP kinase) - the L. chlorophorum homologs
were unambiguously related to those of green algae and
land plants (see Fig. 1 and Table 1). In the PsbO phylogeny (Fig. 1A), the L. chlorophorum sequence clustered
within green algae and landplants, and was differentiated
from red algal sequences with the maximum bootstrap
support. PsbP, PsbR, RuBisCO activase and PAP kinase
encode plastid proteins found exclusively (or almost
exclusively) in green algae and land plants: (Fig. 1B-E)
[43]. We also found genes possibly originating from the
ancient peridinin plastid exemplified by the phylogenies
of ferredoxin NADP reductase (Fig. 2B) and 1-deoxy-Dxylolose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (Fig. 2A) where
L. chlorophorum formed strongly supported clades with
the peridinin-containing dinoflagellates (95% and 100%
bootstrap supports). In the phylogeny of 4-disphophocytidyl 2C methyl-D erythriol kinase, L. chlorophorum

branched with K. veneficum with high support (95%)
(Fig. 2C and Table 1). In this tree, the two dinoflagellates grouped with heterokonts to the exclusion of haptophytes, even though the plastid in K. veneficum is of
haptophyte origin indicating that both K. veneficum and
L. chlorophorum either still utilize the homolog from
the peridinin-containing plastids or that they both
recruited this gene from the same or very closely related
organisms.
Some of the other phylogenies strongly indicated that
L. chlorophorum also harbors plastid-targeted protein
genes that originate from sources other than green algae
and the peridinin-containing dinoflagellate plastid. The
phylogeny of RuBisCO small subunit (RbcS, Fig. 3A)
shows that the L. chlorophorum homolog clusters with
streptophytes with 81% bootstrap support; this origin is
further supported by the presence of a streptophyte-specific insertion in the L. chlorophorum gene (Fig. 3C). In
phylogenies of phosphoribulokinase (PRK, Fig. 3B) and
csp41 (Fig. 2D), the L. chlorophorum homolog clustered
with those of heterokonts. For csp41, this phylogenetic
affinity was supported by 100% bootstrap support. The
position of L. chlorophorum in the PRK phylogeny, however, is without significant statistical support, but the L.
chlorophorum homolog bears a heterokont-specific
insertion strongly indicating affinity to the homologs of

heterokonts (Fig. 3D). A sequence identical to that of
the previously reported plastid-targeted GAPDH gene
was identified. This gene has previously been shown to
be of haptophyte origin [24]. In four cases (fructose 1,6
bisphosphate, chloroplast stability factor hcf 136, transketolase and ATP synthase gamma, see Additional file 1
Figure S1 and Table 1), the L. chlorophorum homologs
were excluded from those of green algae with high support, but their precise positions among red-algal derived
homologs are unclear. In four of the phylogenies (Sedoheptulose bisphosphatase, 3,8 divinyl-protochlorophyllide, DnaJ and Ferredoxin B), the position of the L.
chlorphorum gene-homolog remained unresolved due to
insufficient taxon sampling and/or phylogenetic information (Additional file 2 Figure S2 and Table 1). Several
isoforms of Chlorophyll a/b binding protein and Chlorophyll a/c binding proteins were also identified (Table 1).

peptide cleavage sites of these proteins as reasonable
estimates for investigating the transit peptide characteristics. A logoplot based on the putative cleavage sites
estimated using SignalP-HMM is shown in Additional
file 4 Figure S4 - illustrating that no conserved sequence
motif was found. Additional file 5 Figure S5 displays the
distribution of amino acids in the estimated transit peptides and compares the distribution in transit peptides
of various eukaryotic lineages [47]. The putative L.
chlorophorum transit peptides have lower levels of serine
and threonine residues compared to those of green
algae, while the proportion of acidic residues is
increased compared to most other transit peptides. Conserved cleavage site sequences and stop membrane
anchors (STMAs) were not detected in the estimated
transit peptides.

Discussion
The N-terminal extensions (presequences) of L.
chlorophorum are different from those found in other
dinoflagellates and green algae

Based on the results of 5’ RACE, the putative N-terminal presequences of 20 of the 22 plastid-targeted protein genes were identified. The dinoflagellate-specific
spliced leader sequence [44] was detected in the 5’-end
of all sequences, confirming that the entire 5’-end had
been retrieved. High S-score values of neural networks
implemented in the program SignalP 3.0 (SignalP-NN)
[45] were obtained in all of the N-terminal extensions,
indicating the presence of a signal peptide and therefore
of a secretory pathway (Additional file 3 Figure S3,
hydrophobicity plots). The transit peptide cleavage sites
were also estimated using SignalP. Only three of the
sequences (csp41, dvr1 and psbO) gave the definite cleavage sites of signal peptides when estimating with both
SignalP-NN and hidden Markov models, also implemented in SignalP 3.0 (SignalP-HMM). In the remaining
sequences, the two programs (SignalP-NN and SignalPHMM) often inferred different positions of the cleavage
site and the statistical significance of the estimated sites
was rather low in several cases. This may be caused by
an abnormally long hydrophilic region at the beginning
of the N-terminal extension. Such a hydrophilic region
has not previously been detected in dinoflagellates, but a
similar feature has been reported from the early diverging alveolate Perkinsus [46]. After removing the hydrophilic region of N-terminal extensions of plastidtargeted proteins other than csp41, dvr1 and psbO, the
probability for the cleavage sites was increased with SignalP (Fig. S3), but still remained relatively low. Although
the precise cleavage positions of the 17 plastid-targeted
proteins could not be conclusively determined in this
study, it is likely that the signal peptides are cut off after
targeting plastid ER, and we consider the putative transit

L. chlorophorum contains a true plastid with a
phylogenetically hybrid plastid proteome

The genus Lepidodinium is the only known dinoflagellate lineage that possesses a secondary plastid of green
algal origin rather than the red algal derived peridinincontaining plastid found in most photosynthetic dinoflagellates [22-24,37]. The green L. chlorophorum plastid is
maintained for years in laboratory cultures. This,
together with the identified plastid-targeted genes of
probable green algal origin encoded by the nucleus of L.
chlorophorum presented in this study, strongly indicates
that the green algal plastid is a permanent and fully
integrated organelle. Among the transferred plastid-targeted genes are genes characteristic of the green
lineages, such as RuBisCO activase and components of
the photosynthetic pathway (psbR, psbP), which have
never previously been detected in dinoflagellates. All
L. chlorophorum plastid-targeted proteins have been
extended by a signal peptide to transport the protein
across the additional membranes resulting from the secondary endosymbiosis, and are thus likely functional
and transported to the organelle, demonstrating that the
plastid is indeed stable and dependent on the host. This
means that full plastid replacement events have
occurred on at least two occasions among dinoflagellates
(Lepidodinium and Karlodinium/Karenia) [9,23,24,38].
In addition to genes originating from the current
green plastid, we also identified putative plastid-targeted
genes (with N-terminal extensions) that clustered with
genes from the peridinin plastid in phylogenetic trees,
implying that proteins from the ancient endosymbiont
are still functional and now targeted to the new plastid.
This shows that nuclear-encoded plastid-targeted protein genes can be retained even though the plastid itself
is replaced, providing further support for the view that a
plastid replacement event does not necessarily lead to

Minge et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:191
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/191

loss of all characters from the previous plastid as earlier
predicted [31,48,49]. The retention of “old” genes in the
new plastid proteome mirrors the results of studies of
the transcriptome of K. veneficum and K. brevis, which
harbor tertiary haptophyte-derived plastids [31,33].
Together, these results show that combining genes
transferred via endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) from
the new plastid and recycled genes from the ancient
endosymbiont is a general trait among dinoflagellate
lineages that have undergone repeated uptake and loss
of plastids. This supports that the ancient plastid plays a
role in the replacement process and likely facilitates
integration of the new plastid [4].
It is unclear whether the original peridinin plastid of
L. chlorophorum was replaced while still photosynthetically functional, or if the new plastid was established
after the lineage had lost its ability to photosynthesize
or lost its plastids altogether. In K. veneficum, the apparent lack of peridinin-plastid derived photosynthesis
genes suggests that its ancestor was heterotrophic when
the new haptophyte plastid was acquired, and that the
relic plastid was retained at that time for anabolic purposes [31]. In contrast, identification of the ancient
dinoflagellate form of ferredoxin NADP reductase (an
iron-sulfur protein involved in several photosynthetic
reactions) in L. chlorophorum implies that the green
plastid was engulfed either while the host was still
photosynthetic, or very soon after its ability to photosynthesize was lost.
Horizontal or endosymbiotic gene transfer?

The retention of nuclear-encoded genes from the peridinin-containing plastid in the L. chlorophorum plastid
proteome is analogous with the situation in K. veneficum and K. brevis [31,33]. However, the L. chlorophorum nucleus also contains plastid-targeted genes of
other origins, including streptophytes, heterokonts and
haptophytes, indicating that this lineage may be substantially affected by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). While
HGT is well known in prokaryotes and have been identified in other dinoflagellate lineages [50], the significant
impact of gene transfers in eukaryotic evolutionary history has only recently been recognized [51,52]. Another
plastid proteome that seems to be heavily affected by
HGT is the chlorarachniophyte B. natans, in which
about 20% of the plastid-targeted genes originate from
sources other than its current green algal plastid [15].
The high degree of ‘foreign’ genes in B. natans has been
suggested to be a result of horizontal transfer associated
with the mixotrophic mode of nutrition of this organism
[15]. The analogous pattern of horizontally transferred
genes in dinoflagellates might also be due to this type of
life style [53]. Recently, a distinct footprint of a green
algal lineage (the prasinophytes) was revealed in major

Page 8 of 11

chromalveolate lineages, suggesting that a cryptic endosymbiont was present in the their ancestor [34]. If this
theory is correct, at least 3 plastids (green, red, green)
have been involved in shaping the plastid proteome of
L. chlorophorum. Additionally, the high amount of foreign genes observed in L. chlorophorum and B. natans
may reflect an ever more complex evolutionary history
where genes were acquired via gene transfers from a
series of cryptic endosymbionts. However, whether the
L. chlorophorum genes originating from other sources
than the known plastids were supplied by additional
endosymbionts (EGT) or from prey (HGT) is difficult to
infer without a larger dataset, and remains unclear.
Import systems in mixed chloroplast proteomes

The green plastid in L. chlorophorum has changed environment from being a primary plastid with two surrounding membranes in green alga to becoming a
secondary plastid in dinoflagellates with four enveloping
membranes. Accordingly, we found that the presequences of the plastid-targeted proteins in L. chlorophorum are different from those usually observed in
green algae (see Additional file 5 Figure S5).
Green algal targeting-transit peptides have elevated
levels of hydroxylated Ser and Thr residues, a net positive charge due to depletion of acidic residues, and elevated levels of Ala [47]. However, in L. chlorophorum,
the transit peptides of plastid-targeted proteins are
depleted of Ser and Thr residues relative to those of
green algae. The N-terminal extension of plastid-targeted proteins from peridinin-containing dinoflagellates
comprises a FVA/SP-motif and two classes of sequences
are recognized, of which class I contains an additional
hydrophobic region that functions as a stop transfer
membrane anchor (STMA) downstream of the transit
peptide region (probably involved in a transportation
pathway through the Golgi apparatus), while class II is
deprived of a transmembrane region [54]. We did not
observe the conserved FVAP motif common in dinoflagellates with peridinin-containing plastids (this is, however, somewhat uncertain due to the difficulties in
estimating the cleavage sites). STMAs were not observed
and the levels of acidic residues were higher than those
found in other transit peptides (except for K. veneficum).
The putative change of transit peptide characteristics is
also seen in K. veneficum, whose transit signals are different from those of peridinin-containing plastids and
those of haptophyte plastids [31]. It is interesting to
note that both dinoflagellate lineages with replaced plastids most likely use a new type of transit peptide rather
than recycling the transit peptide from the ancestral
condition or the endosymbiont. These modifications
may have been driven by the co-existence of two divergent plastids after the uptake of a new plastid, which

Minge et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:191
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/191

required a way to discriminate between the plastid genes
[31]. Accordingly, it is intriguing to speculate that modification of N-terminal presequences is related to the
mosaic plastid proteomes which have co-evolved and
adapted to the trafficking machinery of the host [55].

Conclusions
In this study, we investigated the evolutionary origin of
the plastid-targeted proteins of L. chlorophorum and
analyzed their N-terminal presequences that are likely
associated with plastid targeting. The plastid proteome
of L. chlorophorum is a mixture of proteins with different phylogenetic origins. This hybrid proteome is seemingly shaped by the current plastid, the previous
peridinin-type plastid and by horizontally transferred
genes from various algal lineages. However, additional
cryptic endosymbioses involving additional algal groups
(streptophytes, heterokonts, haptophytes) cannot be
ruled as the causes of phylogentic proteome mosaics.
The L. chlorophorum transit peptides differ from the
transit peptides found in green algae or other dinoflagellates. The characteristics of the altered transit peptides
found in L. chlorophorum as well as Karenia/Karlodinium are likely to have played an important role for
shaping the mosaic plastid proteome of these species.
Methods
Culturing, library construction, cDNA-sequencing and 5’
RACE

The monoclonal L. chlorophorum strain RCC1488 (Roscoff Culture Collection: http://www.sb-roscoff.fr/Phyto/
RCC) was cultured in K/2(-Tris,-Si) medium [56] at 17°C
with illumination provided by daylight neon tubes at an
intensity of 150 μE.m2.s1 and a photoperiod of 14L:10 D.
Pre-cultures were treated for 24 hours with a range of
concentrations of Provasoli antibiotic mixture (Sigma
Aldrich) and sub-cultured regularly over a 3-week period
in order to minimize bacterial contamination. Two 10
liter cultures were harvested in mid to late exponential
growth phase by centrifugation (5 min at 6,000 rpm) in
sterile 1 liter polycarbonate centrifuge flasks (Nalgene).
Cell concentrates were immediately flash frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80°C pending analysis.
RNA was isolated and a non-normalized, directional,
cDNA library was constructed in the plasmid vector
pAGEN-1 by Agencourt Bioscience Corp. (Beverly, MA,
USA). 4,746 randomly picked clones were 5’-end
sequenced, and subsequently quality checked and
assembled to contigs using a Phred/Phrap pipeline at
the open-access Bioportal service at University of Oslo
http://www.bioportal.uio.no. BLASTx analyses http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST and gene annotation of L.
chlorophorum singletons and contigs were performed
using Blast2GO [57].

Page 9 of 11

The 5’-ends of the cDNA sequences were amplified by
performing rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE),
using the GeneRacer kit with SuperScript III RT (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) using specific primers and a
nested PCR approach. The products were subsequently
cloned using the TOPO-TA cloning kit for sequencing
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA).
Identification of plastid targeted sequences

Plastid targeted sequences among singletons and contigs
were identified according to their phylogenetic relationship to other plastid homologs, participation in plastidlocated processes, and/or possession of plastid-targeted
sequence comprising a signal peptide and a transit peptide [15]. Searches for possible signal peptides and their
cleavage sites were estimated using SignalP (http://www.
cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP[45]. Logoplots were constructed using WebLogo http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/
logo.cgi, while transmembrane helices were identified
using TMHMM server v.2.0 http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM and the hydrophobicity profile of Kyte
and Doolittle [58].
Alignment construction and phylogenetic analyses

Amino-acid sequence alignments were created by downloading homologous sequences from the nonredundant
(NCBInr) and EST (NCBIest) databases in GenBank for
each putative plastid-targeted gene detected in L. chlorophorum. We aimed to include taxa from all main photosynthetic eukaryotic lineages in each alignment. The
sequences were initially aligned using MAFFT [59], and
subsequently edited manually in MacClade [60].
Ambiguously aligned characters were detected by eye
and removed manually. Maximum likelihood trees were
inferred using RAxML [61]. Trees were identified with
100 separate heuristic searches from random starting
trees, while bootstrap analyses involved 100 pseudoreplicates and one heuristic search for each replication with
the same substitution model as the initial search. Bayesian analyses were performed using MrBayes v.3.1.2
[62,63] Trees were generated from two runs with one
heated and three cold chains in the MCMC, using a
random starting tree and 2,000,000 generations. Tree
sampling were done every 100 generations. Burn-in
trees were set according to the assessment of the likelihood plots and the convergence diagnostics implemented in MrBayes, and the consensus of the sampled trees
were used to calculate the posterior probabilities. The
best fitting evolutionary model for each alignment
according to the AIC (for ML) and BIC (for Bayesian)
was applied (i.e. WAG, RtRev or CtRev;. estimated by
Prottest v.2.4 [64]).
Accession numbers for the sequences used in the
alignments are shown in Additional file 6 Table S1.
