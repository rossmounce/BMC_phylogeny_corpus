Abstract
Background: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is a critical component
of interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma signaling. Although seven isoforms of STAT proteins
have been reported from mammals, limited information is available for the STAT genes in fish. We
isolated complementary DNA with high similarity to mammalian STAT1 from the olive flounder,
Paralichthys olivaceus.
Results: A DNA fragment containing the conserved SH2 domain was amplified by RT-PCR using
degenerate primers designed based on the highly conserved sequences in the SH2 domains of the
zebrafish and mammalian STAT1. The complete cDNA sequence was obtained by 5' and 3' RACE.
The flounder STAT1 transcript consisted of 2,909 bp that encoded a polypeptide of 749 amino
acids. The overall similarity between flounder STAT1 and other STATs was very high, with the
highest amino acid sequence identity to snakehead (89%). Phylogenetic analyses reveal that
flounder STAT1 is in the same monophyletic group with snakehead STAT1. Quantitative real time
RT-PCR and in situ hybridization revealed that STAT1 was expressed in almost all examined organs
and tissues, with high expression in gill, spleen, kidney, and heart. The accumulation of STAT1
mRNA in different developmental stages, as determined by real time RT-PCR, increased with
development.
Conclusion: Recent cloning of various cytokine genes and the STAT1 gene of olive flounder here
suggest that fish also use the highly specialized JAK-STAT pathway for cytokine signaling.
Identification of other STAT genes will elucidate in detail the signal transduction system in this fish.

Background
Cellular responses to internal and external signals are
mediated by the expression of specific genes or sets of
genes, which are regulated by specific transcriptional fac-

tors [1]. Therefore, the entry of transcription factors into
the nucleus is critical to their role in gene expression. Signals from cytokines and growth factors are transduced
into the nucleus by the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transPage 1 of 9

ducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling
pathway [2-6]. JAK-STAT signaling is also involved in the
regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, survival,
motility, and apoptosis in different organs [7].
The binding of signal molecules to their receptors initiates
activation of JAKs, which increases their tyrosine kinase
activity [4,8]. The activated JAKs phosphorylate tyrosine
residues on the receptor, which turns into a binding site
for proteins that contain phosphotyrosine-binding Src
homology 2 (SH2) domains such as STATs [9]. The STATs
bound to the phosphorylated receptor are then tyrosinephosphorylated by JAKs. These phosphorylated STATs act
as docking sites for other STATs, which results in dimerization. Activated STAT dimers accumulate in the nucleus,
bind to consensus DNA-recognition motifs in the promoter regions of cytokine-inducible genes, and activate
transcription of these genes [4,10]. STATs are also activated by non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as v-Src and
receptor tyrosine kinases such as growth factor receptors
[11,12].
There are seven distinct STATs in mammals (STAT1, 2, 3,
4, 5a, 5b, and 6) that participate in JAK-STAT signal transduction with different JAKs (JAK1, 2, 3, and Tyk2). STAT1,
2, 4, and 6 are expressed mainly in specific cell types and
participate predominantly in host defense mechanisms;
STAT1 is critical for interferon (IFN) function and innate
immunity [13-15]. For example, STAT1 is selectively stimulated by IFN-gamma which has antiviral, immunoregulatory, and anti-tumor properties [14-16]. In mice lacking
STAT1, all physiological functions associated with IFNs
are absent, leading to a remarkable sensitivity to viral
infections and other pathological agents [14,15]. This
important physiological activity of STAT1 is expected to
be conserved in fishes. Indeed, ectopic expression of the
zebrafish STAT1 rescues IFN-induced signaling in a
STAT1-deficient human cell line, indicating that the IFN/
STAT1-dependent signaling pathway in mammals might
be functionally and structurally conserved in fishes [17].
In support of this, hirame rhabdovirus (HRV)-infected
olive flounder have leukocytes with upregulated levels of
mRNA for the components of the IFN/STAT1-dependent
signaling pathway, such as interferon-inducible 56 K protein (IFI56), CEF-10, and STAT3 [18].
Recently, flounder interleukin-8, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta,
and type-1 cytokine receptors were cloned and characterized [19,20], which suggest the presence of STAT genes in
this fish. In addition, a number of cytokines and growth
factors have been cloned, and their activities have been
successfully detected in rainbow trout and carp [21].
However, limited information is available on STAT1 in
edible fishes, despite recent efforts to understand IFNmediated anti-viral activity in fish. In this study, we

present for the first time the cloning and expression analysis of a olive flounder STAT1.

Results and Discussion
Amplification of the SH2 Domain
The STAT1 molecule can be divided into seven functional
domains: an N-domain responsible for dimer-dimer
interactions, a coiled-coil domain responsible for proteinprotein interactions, a DNA-binding domain, a linker
domain implicated in transcription, an SH2 domain
responsible for receptor binding and dimerization, a tyrosine phosphorylation site, and a transcriptional activation
domain [22]. Among these seven domains, the SH2
domain shows the highest amino acid sequence similarity
between various species and between STAT families. For
example, the STAT1 SH2 domains of human and
zebrafish show 82% identity.

This structural conservation of the STAT SH2 domain in
different species prompted us to clone STAT1 from P. olivaceus. First we constructed three degenerative PCR primers that represent three highly conserved peptide
sequences within the SH2 domains of zebrafish and
human STAT1, and conducted degenerative PCR reactions. The strategy for degenerative PCR used in the experiments is depicted in Fig. 1C. PCR product of 800 bp and
450 bp were obtained from first round and second round
PCR reaction, respectively. As a control, parallel PCR
experiments were conducted with zebrafish cDNA, and
we obtained a similar result, a ~450-bp PCR product, with
the same primers used for flounder (data not shown).
These results strongly suggest that the 800-bp PCR product encodes a partial sequence of flounder STAT1.
To confirm that the nested PCR product is flounder
STAT1, we cloned and sequenced the PCR product. The
cloned cDNA was 461 bp and contained sequences that
perfectly matched with the primers.
Complete Sequence of the Flounder STAT1
The complete cDNA of the flounder STAT1 gene was compiled by overlapping the sequences of the cloned cDNA
and the 5'-RACE and 3'-RACE PCR products. The flounder
STAT1 transcript consisted of 2,909 bp, which translated
into a 749-amino acid (aa) open reading frame (ORF)
that included an 103-bp 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR)
and a 556-bp 3'-UTR. The assembled full-length cDNA
sequence was entered in GenBank under accession
number EF491182. The flounder STAT1 protein is the
same size as that of zebrafish (749 aa), similar to that of
rainbow trout (754 aa), and larger than that of crucian
carp (718 aa), which is missing 39 aa at the C-terminal
end. The flounder STAT1 protein contains the conserved
domains of STAT proteins; the N-terminal domain (1–
136), coiled-coiled domain (137–313), DNA binding

domain (314–483), a linker (484–573), SH2 domain
(574–679), and the transcriptional activation domain
(680–749). The deduced flounder sequence contains a
conserved tyrosine phosphorylation site (Y697) in the Cterminal activation domain. In addition, it contains the E422E- and -V451VV- residues that are involved in DNA
binding activity [23], -P719MSP for serine phosphorylation [24], and the arginine residue (R599) that is required
for SH2 phosphotyrosine binding [25].
The amino acid sequence of the putative flounder STAT1
was compared to known STATs from different species
(Fig. 2). The overall similarity between the flounder
STAT1 and other STATs was very high; snakehead STAT1
showed the highest identity (89%) and similarity (93%)
at the amino acid level. Crucian carp STAT1 showed the
lowest 61% identity and 77% similarity (Table 1). Figure
3 shows the phylogenetic tree based on amino acid
sequence similarity. Flounder STAT1 belonged to the
same monophyletic group as snakehead STAT1 (Fig. 3).
Zebrafish STAT1 and human STAT1 were also included in

the same monophyletic group. These results strongly indicate that the cloned DNA in this study indeed encodes the
ortholog of flounder STAT1. We also note that the flounder STAT1 SH2 domain has been well conserved, and that
it should play similar roles regulating STAT1 activity. As
mentioned previously, zebrafish STAT1 can compensate
for human STAT1 in inducing IFN-mediated signaling
pathways in STAT1-deficient human cell lines [17].
Because zebrafish and flounder STAT1 have very high similarity (Table 1), we expect that flounder STAT1 also plays
important roles in IFN-mediated immune activity in
flounder.
Northern Blot Analysis of Flounder STAT1 Genes
We examined the mRNA expression of flounder STAT1 by
Northern blot analyses. As a control, zebrafish total RNA
was analyzed using zebrafish STAT3 cDNA as a probe. As
shown in Fig. 4A, we detected bands of approximately 2.5
and 3 kb. According to a previous report, the former corresponds to STAT3 and the latter to STAT1 in zebrafish
[17]. Cross-reactivity of STAT3 with STAT1 mRNA is possible because the probe was derived from a 465-bp PCR
fragment from the conserved SH2 domain, which has
64.7% nucleotide sequence identity between STAT1 and
STAT3 [17]. Similarly, we examined STAT1 expression in
flounder and observed a single ~3-kb message, which is
almost the same size as the zebrafish STAT1 [17]. Considering the high sequence similarity in the SH2 domain of
zebrafish STAT1 and STAT3, we expected see an mRNA
band for STAT3 but did not detect another band (Fig. 4B).
Although seven STAT genes have been identified in mammals [3], only STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 have been identified in zebrafish [17,26], STAT1 in rainbow trout and
crucian carp [27], and STAT5 in pufferfish [28]. In
zebrafish, only cDNA clones containing STAT3 were
detected using a probe derived from STAT1. The presence
of different forms of STAT genes in other fish but failure
in the detection of STAT3 with the conserved SH2 domain
probe in flounder suggests the possibility of finding more
STAT genes in flounder with low nucleotide sequence similarity.
Expression of Flounder STAT1 in Different Tissues and
Developmental Stages
Some STATs, including STAT3, are expressed in early
stages of development, and null mutants for STAT3 in
mice are embryonic lethal [29]. In contrast, STAT1 in vertebrates is dispensable for normal development [14].
Early expression of mouse STAT1 has been detected only
in endothelial cells of decidual vasculature and decidual
cells, which indicates maternal expression of this gene
[30]. Similarly, zebrafish STAT1 gene expression was not
detected by in situ hybridization before 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) [17]. As shown in Fig. 5A, flounder STAT1
expression could be detected in all developmental stages,

increased in accordance with development. Increased
mouse STAT1 expression has been observed from postnatal day 0 to adulthood in the cerebellum and cerebral cor-

tex. In our experiment, total RNA was extracted from
fertilized eggs and later developmental stages. Therefore,
the site of STAT1 expression could not be determined and
needs to be further characterized.

domain-specific probe.

There are many reports of STAT1 expression in different
tissues or cells of vertebrates, but studies of expression of
fish STAT proteins in different tissues are limited. Sung et
al. [28] observed the same expression of STAT5 in different tissues. We analyzed the expression of flounder STAT1
mRNA using quantitative real time RT-PCR and in situ
hybridization. As shown in Fig. 5B, flounder STAT1 was
expressed in all tested tissues. However, there was a difference in expression level; expression was low in the liver,
skin, and muscle, whereas it was high in the gill, spleen
and kidney. This was further confirmed by in situ hybridization, which showed high expression of STAT1 mRNA
in the gill, spleen and kidney (Fig. 6). The tissues probed
with SH2 domain probe showed blue appearance and
there was no "hot spot" of STAT1 expression in these tissues, and STAT1 expression was detected in most cells in
these tissues.
STAT1 is involved in signaling pathways initiated by both
IFN-α/β and IFN-γ, which are important to innate antiviral responses and adaptive cell-mediated immune
responses, respectively. In both, STAT1 is in an inactivated
latent form in the cytoplasm and is activated by binding
of IFNs to their receptors. Therefore, basal expression of
STAT1 is necessary for a prompt response to a signal. For
example, higher basal expression of STAT1 and STAT2 in

cardiac myocytes results in higher antiviral protection
[31]. The gill is the front line of defense when fish encounter foreign substances, including pathogenic microorganisms. Therefore, high expression of STAT1 is necessary for
prompt and efficient innate immune responses. Similarly,
spleen and kidney play important roles in the adaptive
immune response of fish [32], and high expression of
STAT1 can be expected. Our results indicate that flounder
STAT1 is expressed throughout development and that tissue with high STAT1 expression are involved in defense
against pathogens.

Conclusion
Flounder is one of the main edible fishes in Asia and is
also one of the most lucrative fishes in marine culture.
However, many problems hamper the mass production of
flounder through high-density culture. In particular, frequent mass mortality induced by viral and bacterial infections causes serious damage to the flounder industry.
Therefore, biological research on the immune system of
flounder is highly important, not only for academic purposes but also for commercial and industrial purposes.
We cloned flounder STAT1 and found that the SH2

may use the highly specialized JAK-STAT pathway for
cytokine signaling. Further identification of IFN and isoforms of STAT proteins will provide more detail about the
signaling and immune responses of this economically
important fish.

Methods
Cloning of STAT1 cDNA in flounder
A cDNA fragment encoding the partial sequence of STAT1
was obtained by PCR from the brain tissues of olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus. A forward degenerate oligonucleotide
(STAT5'-1)
5'-TT(T/C)GTIGTIGA(A/G)(A/
C)GICA(A/G)CC-3' and a reverse degenerate primer
(STAT3') 5'-GA(A/G)AAIC(T/G)IA(A/G)IA(A/G)(A/G)AA
IGT-3' were used for first-round PCR. These primers represent two short amino acid sequences (FVVERQP and SFRLLFT) that are highly conserved in the SH2 domains of
zebrafish and mammalian STAT1 (Fig. 1). Total RNA was
extracted from 100 mg of flounder brain tissue. Using this
RNA as a template, cDNA was synthesized using Moloney

murine leukemia virus (MMLV)-reverse transcriptase and
subsequently used as the template for the first-round PCR.
The PCR product was subsequently amplified by nested
degenerative PCR. For this second-round PCR, 5'-TCICTICCIGTIGTIGTIAT-3' (STAT5'-2) was used as a 5' degenerate primer in combination with the STAT3' primer. The
successfully amplified cDNA fragment was cloned into a
pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced.
The full-length of flounder STAT1 was obtained using
rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) with a SMART
RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech) following the
manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (1 μg) obtained
from liver was used for cDNA synthesis. The gene-specific
STAT1 primers STAT1-5RACE (5'-GCAGCTGACAGACGTTAGAGATCAC-3') and STAT1-3RACE (5'-CTGAGTGACAAGTGTCCCGGCAC-3') were used in the RACE of
the 5' and 3' ends, respectively. The 5' and 3' cDNA fragments obtained from RACE were cloned and sequenced as
described above.

Northern Blot Analysis
Total RNA was isolated from flounder brain and zebrafish
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA samples were resolved in
1% agarose/formaldehyde gels, blotted onto Hybond-N
membranes
(Amersham),
and
hybridized
in
ExpressHybTM hybridization solution (Clontech). The
membranes were probed with 32P-labeled zebrafish
STAT3 cDNA or the flounder STAT1 cDNA fragment.
Hybridized probes were washed in 0.1% SDS/0.1 SSC at
65°C and visualized by autoradiography.
Structural Analysis of Flounder STAT1
The flounder STAT1 SH2 domain was identified using the
TBLASTN algorithm on the BLAST server at the NCBI databank. Multiple sequence alignments were done with the
CLUSTAL W algorithm in the BCM Search Launcher, and
further adjusted by GeneDoc. A phylogenetic tree of the
aligned sequences was constructed using the neighborjoining algorithm within MEGA (version 3.0). The accession numbers of the sequences used in the alignments and
phylogenetic tree were: olive flounder STAT1 (EF491182),
snakehead STAT1 (EF079868), green puffer STAT1 and
STAT3 (AF307105, AF307106), rainbow trout STAT1 and
STAT3 (U60331, U60333), zebrafish STAT1 and STAT3

Rad). The flounder GAPDH gene was used as a housekeeping reference gene to normalize expression levels
between the samples. All the data of triplicate experiments
were expressed as relative to GAPDH, which was used to
normalize for any difference in reverse transcriptase efficiency. Fold change in the relative gene expression to control was determined by the standard 2-ΔΔCt method of
Giulietti et al. [33].
Localization of STAT1 mRNA by In Situ Hybridization
(ISH)
The flounder STAT1 amplified with specific primers,
STAT1-RT-F and STAT1-RT-R, was used to synthesize digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled cRNA probes. The DIG-labeled
cRNA probes were synthesized using a DIG RNA labeling
kit (Roche). The kidney, spleen, intestine, and gill of a
healthy olive flounder were fixed in neutral buffered formalin, dehydrated, impregnated, and embedded in paraffin. After deparaffination and rehydration, 4- to 5-μm
thick sections were washed for 5 min in 100% ethanol at
room temperature and pretreated with Proteinase K (10
μg/ml) for 30 min at 37°C. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed in DIG Easy Hyb (Roche) solution. A hybridization mix was prepared by adding one
volume of hybridization buffer to one volume of antisense and sense probe, giving a final concentration of at
least 50 ng/μl of probe. The slides were washed with DIG
wash and block buffer (Roche), and the signal was
detected using the DIG Luminescent Detection Kit
(Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The
sections were counterstained with Bismarck Brown Y
before observation.

Authors' contributions
Expression Studies using quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from healthy adult P. olivaceus
(0.5 kg in body weight), muscle, liver, intestine, stomach,
kidney, skin, fin, spleen, gill, eye, and heart, or from
flounder at different developmental stages using Trizol
(Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed
using the Advantage RT-for-PCR Kit (BD Biosciences). The
level of STAT1 expression was detected by RT-PCR using
specific primers (STAT1-RT-F: 5'-GATCTCTAACGTCTGTCAGCTG-3' and STAT1-RT-R: 5'-GAGGTCCAGGAT
TCCTTCGATC-3'). As a positive control, GAPDH was
amplified using the appropriate sense (GAPDH-RT-F: 5'TCCCATGTTCGTCATGGGCGTGA-3') and antisense
(GAPDH-RT-R: 5'-ATTGAGCTCAGGGATGACCTTG-3')
primers.

E–MP, JSS and J–HK carried out 5' and 3' RACE, in situ
hybridization, sequence alignment, real time PCR and
drafted the manuscript. GK participated in 3' RACE and
sequence analysis. JC carried out the cloning of the SH2
domain and southern blot analysis. T–JC participated in
its design and coordination and helped to draft the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
