Abstract
Background: Polymorphisms in chemokine (C-C motif) receptors 2 and 5 genes (CCR2 and CCR5) have been
associated with HIV-1 infection and disease progression. We investigated the impact of CCR2-CCR5 haplotypes on
HIV-1 viral load (VL) and heterosexual transmission in an African cohort. Between 1995 and 2006, cohabiting
Zambian couples discordant for HIV-1 (index seropositive and HIV-1 exposed seronegative {HESN}) were monitored
prospectively to determine the role of host genetic factors in HIV-1 control and heterosexual transmission.
Genotyping for eight CCR2 and CCR5 variants resolved nine previously recognized haplotypes. By regression and
survival analytic techniques, controlling for non-genetic factors, we estimated the effects of these haplotypic
variants on a) index partner VL, b) seroconverter VL, c) HIV-1 transmission by index partners, d) HIV-1 acquisition by
HESN partners.
Results: Among 567 couples, 240 virologically linked transmission events had occurred through 2006. HHF*2
homozygosity was associated with significantly lower VL in seroconverters (mean beta = -0.58, log10 P = 0.027) and
the HHD/HHE diplotype was associated with significantly higher VL in the seroconverters (mean beta = 0.54, log10
P = 0.014) adjusted for age and gender in multivariable model. HHD/HHE was associated with more rapid
acquisition of infection by the HESNs (HR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.20-3.43, P = 0.008), after adjustments for index partner
VL and the presence of genital ulcer or inflammation in either partner in Cox multivariable models. The HHD/HHE
effect was stronger in exposed females (HR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.14-3.95, P = 0.018).
Conclusions: Among Zambian discordant couples, HIV-1 coreceptor gene haplotypes and diplotypes appear to
modulate HIV-1 VL in seroconverters and alter the rate of HIV-1 acquisition by HESNs. These associations replicate
or resemble findings reported in other African and European populations.

Background
Sub-Saharan Africa is home to about 10% of the world’s
population but bears nearly 64% of all HIV-1 infections
[1], with most HIV-1 transmission occurring heterosexually. In Zambia, about one in five cohabiting couples involves an HIV-1 seropositive (index) and a
seronegative (exposed) partner; these serodiscordant
couples are at high risk of heterosexual transmission,
with an estimated rate of eight transmission events per
100 person-years of follow-up [2].

The rate of within-couple heterosexual HIV-1 transmission is highly variable, and a number of viral, host
and environmental factors may modify transmission
(infectiousness), acquisition (susceptibility) or both [3].
Donor HIV-1 viral load (VL), age, sex, history of sexually transmitted infection (STI), unprotected sex, and
possible HIV-1 subtype are among the major factors
implicated [4,5]. In southern Africa, unusual biological
features of the predominant C subtype of HIV-1 [5] and
absence of the human CC chemokine receptor 5 gene
(CCR5) 32-bp deletion (Δ32) as a resistance factor may
contribute to relatively high transmission rate.
The recognition that Caucasians who are homozygous
for CCR5-Δ32 are highly resistant to HIV-1 infection

was a landmark finding in research on HIV-1 transmission [6-9]. It stimulated a concerted effort to elucidate
the impact of other genetic variations in CCR5 and the
adjacent gene CCR2 on HIV-1 transmission and disease
progression [10-12]. Research on the association of
these variants with transmission has been largely crosssectional or retrospective; the few prospective studies
have focused on vertical (mother-to-child) transmission
[13] and on HIV-1 exposed seronegatives (HESNs), in
part because of the difficulty in enrolling and following
HIV-1-discordant couples.
In Zambia, thousands of cohabiting and HIV-1 discordant couples have been offered voluntary counseling
and testing (VCT) services since 1995 [2], and some of
them have been followed for more than 10 years [14].
Despite counseling and behavioral interventions, the
rate of HIV-1 transmission among these couples has
remained high [15]. This circumstance permitted us to
investigate the association of polymorphism in CCR2
and CCR5 with heterosexual transmission of phylogenetically related [16] HIV-1 within discordant partners.
The major published studies [11,13,17-20] examining
the effects of CCR2 and CCR5 SNPs/haplotypes/diplotypes on HIV-1 infection or disease progression have
shown a wide spectrum of effects in various populations
(See Additional File 1; Table S1). We systematically
tested hypotheses on these as well as other markers that
occurred frequently enough in our population to permit
meaningful inferences, especially in confirmation of earlier findings.

Results
General characteristics of Zambian couples with linked
HIV-1 viruses

During the study period 567 couples were eligible for
analysis. Linked transmission occurred in 240 of the
567; (Table 1). nearly all (> 95%) of the HIV-1
sequences from these transmission pairs corresponded
to viral subtype C (HIV-1C) [16]. Male-to-female transmission accounted for nearly three-fifths of the incident
infections (Table 1). The younger age of exposed
women and, to a lesser extent, exposed men was associated with seroconversion. Certain non-genetic characteristics of the partners were also independently
associated with increased transmission: genital ulcers or
genital inflammation in any partner (HR = 3.62, 95% CI:
2.65-4.93, P < 0.0001) and high VL in the index partner
(HR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.32-1.91, P < 0.0001). These factors were retained in subsequent models that tested the
impact of genetic markers.
Distribution of CCR2-CCR5 haplotypes in Zambian couples

Eight CCR2-CCR5 haplotypes were observed in the frequency distribution shown in Table 2. Nearly 50% of all

Page 2 of 9

haplotypes were HHA or HHF*2. Haplotype HHB was
rarely seen, and the Δ32-containing haplotype HHG*2
was not observed at all. The most common genotypes
(diplotypes) were HHA/HHF*2, HHA/HHD, HHA/
HHA, HHA/HHE, HHD/HHF*2, and HHE/HHF*2 (See
Additional File 2; Table S2). The overall distribution of
CCR2-CCR5 haplotypes did not conform to HWE
(Table 2). After stratification of the cohort into transmission and nontransmission index partners, seroconverters, and exposed uninfected partners, the haplotype
distribution deviated significantly from HWE in all three
seropositive groups, but not in the HESNs.
CCR2-CCR5 determinants of VL

Although HHA and HHC have previously shown protective effects in the form of associations with lower VL
in a mixed population [21], we did not observe such an
effect on VL in Zambians with either haplotype overall
or with any specific diplotypes containing either of
them.
In prior studies, HHF*2 has shown somewhat inconsistent associations with VL and disease control
[11,17,19,20,22,23]. In our Zambian study population
HHF*2 showed a weak association with lower VL in
both index partners (b = -0.21, log10 P = 0.024) and seroconverters (b = -0.10, log 10 P = 0.089). When the
index partners and seroconverters were stratified by
HHF*2 genotype, a stronger association in the latter
group was largely attributable to HHF*2 homozygosity
(b = -0.70, log10 P = 0.007) (Table 3).
Both HHD and HHE have been associated with higher
VL in several studies [11,13,18,24,25]. In our Zambian
cohort, dominant models, including each haplotype plus
non-genetic factors analyzed by GLM, indicated that
HHD was associated with higher VL (b = 0.24, log10 P =
0.021) in the seroconverters, but a modest effect in the
opposite direction was observed in index partners. HHE
showed a trend toward association with higher VL in
index partners and a similar non-significant association
with higher VL in seroconverters adjusted for age and
gender (Table 3). Because this pattern of association
could be explained by combinations of haplotypes carried, we explored the effect of diplotypes further.
Among all diplotypes of frequency > 0.05, HHD/HHE
showed the strongest association with higher VL (b =
0.49, log10 P = 0.02)
We next constructed a multivariable model with all
the haplotypes and diplotypes that showed a trend
toward association (log10 P < 0.10) with higher or lower
VL in either index partners or seroconverters to test
their independent influences on VL (Table 3). In this
model, by including uninformative diplotypes (HHD/
HHF*2 and HHE/HHF*2) in the reference group, each
diplotype implicated could be tested independently of

the others. In the index partners, HHE/X shows a strong
association with higher VL. In seroconverters the HHD/
HHE and HHF*2/HHF*2 diplotypes remained significantly and independently associated with VL after controlling for individual haplotype effects (Table 3).
CCR2-CCR5 determinants of transmission from index
partners and of seroconversion in HESNs

The few studies that have attempted to assess the role
of the receptor polymorphism in transmission and

susceptibility have shown rather diverse associations of
common CCR5 haplotypes, without any discernible pattern (See Additional File 1, Table S1). No SNP or haplotype carried by Zambian index partners was significantly
associated with transmission (data not shown). In the
survival analysis, HESNs with the HHD/HHE diplotypes
showed significantly more rapid seroconversion than
HESNs with other haplotypes (Table 4 and Figure 1a)
after adjustments for index partner VL and the presence
of genital ulcer or inflammation in either partner.

Although HHF*2 did not show statistically significant
association with faster HIV-1 acquisition, we assigned it
to a separate stratum in the Kaplan-Meier plot because
aggregating it in the reference group would have given
the appearance of a weaker HHD/HHE effect (Multivariable Cox model HR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.20-3.43, P =
0.008). Stratification by gender revealed a stronger
impact of HHD/HHE on HESN women than men
(Table 4 and Figure 1b) (Multivariable Cox model HR =
2.1, 95% CI = 1.14-3.95, P = 0.018).

Discussion
Many investigations into genetic determinants of HIV/
AIDS have evaluated the effects of Δ32, selected SNPs,
and haplotypes across CCR2-CCR5 on disease progression in a variety of infected populations. Studies of these
markers as determinants of acquisition have usually
been conducted in pairs of mothers and infants or in
exposed men of European ancestry whose male sexual
contacts are largely unknown [13,17,25-27]. Our relatively large prospective study of heterosexual discordant

Figure 1 Association of two CCR2-CCR5 diplotype (HHD/HHE and HHF*2) with time to HIV-1 acquisition among initially seronegative
partners of HIV-1 discordant Zambian couples. Analysis was based on 567 initially seronegative HESNs (panel a) or 295 seronegative female
HESNs only (panel b). Vertical lines on each Kaplan-Meier curve represent subjects censored at the last follow up visit (before December 2006).

African couples has produced further evidence for involvement of variants in these genes in both control and
occurrence of HIV-1 infection.
HHE was associated with slightly higher VL than was
seen with other haplotypes, a finding consistent with
observations in a number of other studies on different
ethnic groups and various modes of transmission
[11,17,28,29]. Further confirmation of the effect of HHE
highlights its potential impact on clinical HIV-1 disease
control in diverse populations, in contrast to that of the
protective Δ32 variant whose distribution is confined to
individuals of European ancestry. We detected an association of homozygous HHF*2 (containing CCR2-64I)
with lower VL in recent seroconverters but found less
certain effects of heterozygous HHF*2. This finding is
consistent with previous reports [11,17,19,20,22].
Although an early meta-analysis persuasively documented modest protection by the 64I allele against progression of HIV-1 subtype B infection [22], results in
subsequent studies have been less consistent–showing
association with slow progression either among Europeans, but not African-Americans [19,20] or among
African-Americans but not Europeans [23,29]. For
populations with subtype C infection, however, no previous study is available as a basis for comparison.
As for the influence of CCR2-CCR5 alleles or haplotypes on transmission and acquisition of infection, the
highly significant deviation of the distribution of haplotypes from HWE among the index, but not the exposed
partners, was strong evidence of a selective effect, and
the differential deviation of the seroconverters, but not
the persistently seronegatives, corroborated the difference. Neither chance nor systematic selection of couples
into the study cohort by their CCR2-CCR5 profile

unrelated to infection seems as plausible an explanation
as the direct effect on acquisition of HIV-1 infection
proposed here.
No CCR2-CCR5 variant carried by index partners was
associated with an appreciable difference in transmission–not even the diplotype HHD/HHE associated with
a statistically significant higher mean VL. This relative
deviation in level of viremia was apparently not equivalent to the larger deviation conferred by index partner
HLA-B*57, a genetic marker associated with a significantly lower transmission rate in this population [14].
Such differential impact of the different genetic markers
may reflect a threshold effect by which a deviation of
VL greater than a certain level overrides any genetic
influence, but the number of subjects in our cohort was
insufficient to assess that possibility.
We observed a trend toward an increased rate of acquisition among the exposed partners carrying HHF*2. In
another African population (Cameroon), the frequency of
CCR2-64I (HHF*2) was higher in the HIV-1 seropositives
(most likely of mixed viral subtype) than in the seronegatives [30]. However, we remain skeptical about the
importance of these findings for several reasons. First,
the association and its significance in Zambians diminished in the multivariable analysis. Second, previous evidence for a role of HHF*2 in occurrence of infection is
sparse, and there is no other report from a prospective
study. Third, considerable uncertainty remains about the
functional relevance of the HHF*2 polymorphism and
CCR2 itself to HIV-1 infection [31]. Further population
studies alone are unlikely to clarify more precisely the
true nature of this genetic contribution.
More rapid HIV-1 acquisition among exposed seronegatives occurred in association with the HHD/HHE

Malhotra et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:22
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/22

diplotype, and the association was stronger in exposed
women than men. An association with this diplotype
has not been reported before, most likely because the
single SNP allele that distinguishes HHD from other
haplotypes is only frequent enough in persons of African
ancestry. The relatively higher frequency (7%) of HHD/
HHE in our population than in Caucasians or other
smaller groups of Africans may have facilitated detection
of its effect. Associations with higher risk of mother-tochild transmission have been reported for HHD in Africans [32] and with homozygous HHD in African Americans [33]. HHE has also been reported to be detrimental
for HIV infection as well as disease progression, but
HHD/HHE has not been studied previously as a diplotype. Although our findings do not constitute exact
replication of previous work, they appear to indicate
consistent effects of the two haplotypes across populations with different viral subtypes.
The effects of HHD/HHE appeared stronger in maleto-female transmission. Differences in VL among the
donor groups did not explain this difference according
to direction of transmission. Nor did the difference
arise from any obvious difference in age or sexual
exposure of the two groups. For each subgroup stratified by gender, the number of seronegative subjects
carrying these genotypes (diplotypes) was relatively
small. Analysis based on larger samples will be necessary to reach a reliable conclusion about such genderspecific associations.
One feature of our study worth noting is the advantage of survival analysis of time to transmission/acquisition in detecting relationships that may be weaker in the
cross-sectional or case-control approach often used to
assess genetic influences on HIV-1 infection. Survival
methods may be more sensitive in capturing timedependent genetic effects on infection just as they have
been in the analysis of disease progression.
We did not adjust statistically for the number of
genetic polymorphisms tested. Rather we have emphasized those nominally significant associations with
CCR2-CCR5 variants that have previously been implicated in HIV/AIDS and de-emphasized those whose
involvement was less predictable from earlier studies.
The previously documented HHE association with
higher VL [11,17,28,29] provided ample rationale for
interpreting our results as confirmatory without treating
all haplotypes as equally likely to be involved. The
impact of HHD/HHE on seroconversion was predicted
somewhat less directly by earlier work associating HHD
with a higher frequency of neonatal infection [33]. An
even more important reason why these relationships
cannot be readily dismissed as chance findings is that
they were observed in the context of significant deviations from HWE of the haplotype distributions in each

Page 6 of 9

of the seropositive groups but not the seronegative
group.
A consistent effect of the frequent HHE with higher
VL in subtype C HIV-1-infected Africans as well as subtype B-infected Europeans and a stronger effect of
HHD/HHE could have further ramifications. Since the
response to antiretroviral treatment in Europeans may
be modified by (Δ32) [34-36] and perhaps by other
receptor variants [37,38], investigators in African settings should consider whether similar studies of CCR2CCR5 polymorphism might provide epidemiologically or
clinically useful prognostic information.

Conclusions
In summary, our analysis of CCR2-CCR5 haplotypes
consisting of common combinations of SNP alleles
spanning those two genes has confirmed a previously
reported association of haplotype HHF*2 with favorable
response to HIV-1 infection; and our longitudinal analysis of seroconversion in HESN African heterosexual
partners has detected probable contributions by the
HHD/HHE diplotype to acquisition of infection
[11,17,39]. Further insight into these relationships will
be gained from studies of correlation between gene variation and gene function, as well as investigation of
other representative and informative populations of
infected and uninfected Africans.
Methods
Study population

Our study population comprised HIV-1 serodiscordant,
cohabiting heterosexual couples enrolled in the ZambiaEmory HIV Research Project between 1995 and 2006.
The procedures for screening, recruitment, counseling,
follow-up visits and laboratory testing have been
described elsewhere [15,40]. All couples whose HESN
partner acquired virologically linked HIV-1 from the
index partner during follow-up were included in this
study. For closer comparability to the transmitters, nontransmission couples were selected from a large number
based on self-reported behavioral or clinical measures of
unprotected sex. Virologically linked HIV-1 transmission
was defined as identity between viruses from index and
seroconverting partners, according to phylogenetic analysis of sub-genomic sequences of gag, env (gp120 and
gp41), and long terminal repeat regions [16,40]. Participant characteristics have previously been thoroughly
examined as potential risk factors for transmission in
this cohort [15,16,40,41]. Risk factors considered here
include index partner (donor) viral load (VL), age of
each partner, and genital ulceration/inflammation in
each partner. The study population consisted of 567
couples with: a) adequate data and biologic material for
both partners, b) observation of nontransmission

Malhotra et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:22
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/22

couples for at least nine months, c) intra-couple virologic linkage when transmission occurred, and d) none of
the partners on anti-retroviral treatment.
Non-genetic factors

VL was quantified as the number of HIV-1 RNA copies
per ml of plasma using Roche Amplicor 1.0 assay (Roche
diagnostic Systems Inc., Branchburg, NJ) in a laboratory
certified by the virology quality assurance program of the
AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG). The lower detection
limit was 400 copies/mL of plasma. For this work, VL
was transformed to log 10 and treated as a continuous
variable. Previous analyses [40] indicated that index partners with a medium number of HIV-1 RNA copies/mL
(104-105, log10 = 4-5) or a high number of copies/mL (>
105, log10 > 5) were more likely to transmit the virus than
those with a low number (< 104, log10 < 4).
Genotyping

Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood and buffy
coats using the QIAamp blood kit and protocols recommended by the manufacturer (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia,
CA). PCR-based typing differentiated the dimorphic variants at eight sites–one in CCR2 (the SNP encoding V64I–
rs1799864) and seven in CCR5 [six SNPs in or adjacent to
the cis-regulatory or promoter region (A29G–rs2856758,
G303A–rs1799987,
T627C–rs1799988,
C630T–
rs41469351, A676G–rs1800023 and C927T–rs1800024)]
and the 32-bp deletion (Δ32–rs333). CCR5 haplotypes
were typed by a combination of two methods: a PCR typing scheme and a TaqMan SNP typing scheme. The PCR
typing scheme used 12 combinations of sequence-specific
primers (SSP) plus four additional SSP reactions in conjunction with T627C-specific primers to define the A29G
variant as described for previous work [11,13,17-20]. Combination of variants at the eight sites form nine relatively
frequent CCR2-CCR5 haplotypes (HHA-HHE, HHF*1,
HHF*2, HHG*1 and HHG*2) according to the nomenclature of the Tri-Service HIV-1 Natural History Study (TSS)
[42]. HHF*2 is the only haplotype carrying the V64I mutation. A TaqMan genotyping assay was used to confirm the
PCR-based SNP typing and assign CCR5 haplotypes for
126 individuals. TaqMan assays were performed using
customized TaqMan probes for 7 SNP sites; SNP alleles
were assigned after real-time PCR using the ABI 7500 Fast
System (Applied Biosystems) according to procedures
recommended by the manufacturer.
Statistical analysis

Non-genetic factors (VL, age, gender, genital ulcer, genital inflammation, circumcision, and presence of sperm)
were compared between seroconverting and non-seroconverting exposed partners using c2 and t-tests. HardyWeinberg equilibrium (HWE) for each SNP and CCR

Page 7 of 9

haplotype distribution was assessed using SAS Genetics
(see below). HWE was calculated for the entire cohort
and for four separate partner groups: transmission index,
nontransmission index, seroconverting, and exposed
uninfected partners. Associations of frequent haplotypes/
genotypes with HIV-1 VL among the index partners and
seroconverters were tested using general linear model
(GLM) statistics with adjustment for age and gender.
For analysis of time-to-infection (transmission and
acquisition), follow-up time for each couple was measured from the date of their enrollment into the cohort
to 1) the date of HIV-1 infection (first seropositive visit)
of the initially uninfected exposed partner or 2) the most
recent seronegative visit prior to administrative censoring
date (December 31, 2006). Time-to-infection was displayed in Kaplan-Meier plots, and comparisons between
genetically distinctive groups were evaluated with Wilcoxon and log-rank tests. These plots illustrate differences in transmission associated with specific genetic
markers; they do not reflect transmission rates in the
entire prospectively observed discordant couple population. The overall annual HIV-1 seroincidence (7-8/100
PY) represents a one-half to two-thirds reduction in
transmission following joint testing and counseling.
Statistical analysis of genetic variants of CCR2 and
CCR5 consisted of testing hypotheses derived from earlier work on acquisition or progression of infection (See
Additional File 1; Table S1) followed by systematic
search for novel associations in our study population.
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were
used to control for non-genetic covariates. We estimated
the hazard ratios (HR), its 95% confidence interval (CI),
and the corresponding two-sided P-values. For hypotheses on genetic markers consistent with previously
reported associations, statistical testing was performed
without correction for multiple comparisons. All statistical analyses were done using SAS® 9.2 including SAS/
Genetics™ (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
