Abstract
Background: Quorum sensing is a process of bacterial cell-to-cell communication involving the
production and detection of extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers. Recently, it has
been proposed that autoinducer-2 (AI-2), a furanosyl borate diester derived from the recycling of
S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH) to homocysteine, serves as a universal signal for interspecies
communication.
Results: In this study, 138 completed genomes were examined for the genes involved in the
synthesis and detection of AI-2. Except for some symbionts and parasites, all organisms have a
pathway to recycle SAH, either using a two-step enzymatic conversion by the Pfs and LuxS enzymes
or a one-step conversion using SAH-hydrolase (SahH). 51 organisms including most Gamma-, Beta, and Epsilonproteobacteria, and Firmicutes possess the Pfs-LuxS pathway, while Archaea, Eukarya,
Alphaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria prefer the SahH pathway. In all 138
organisms, only the three Vibrio strains had strong, bidirectional matches to the periplasmic AI-2
binding protein LuxP and the central signal relay protein LuxU. The initial two-component sensor
kinase protein LuxQ, and the terminal response regulator luxO are found in most Proteobacteria,
as well as in some Firmicutes, often in several copies.
Conclusions: The genomic analysis indicates that the LuxS enzyme required for AI-2 synthesis is
widespread in bacteria, while the periplasmic binding protein LuxP is only present in Vibrio strains.
Thus, other organisms may either use components different from the AI-2 signal transduction
system of Vibrio strains to sense the signal of AI-2, or they do not have such a quorum sensing
system at all.

Background
Quorum sensing through small signal molecules called
autoinducers is an important process for the regulation of
population density dependent cellular processes in bacte-

ria, including the production of antibiotics and virulence
factors, conjugation, transformation, swarming behaviour
and biofilm formation [1,2]. Recently it was discovered
that two different density dependent signal transduction

cascades are present in Vibrio which converge to trigger
luminescence in V. harveyi [3] and expression of virulence
factors in V. cholerae [4,5]. Two chemically different
autoinducers are involved in this regulation. While
autoinducer-1 is an acylated homoserine lactone (AHL)
(N-butanoyl-homoserine lactone) in V. harveyi, the structure of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) has been determined in a
complex with the sensor protein LuxP [6] and shown to be
a furanosyl-borate-diester. It is synthesized in two enzymatic steps (by the Pfs enzyme and the LuxS enzyme)
from S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH), resulting in 4,5dihydroxy 2,3 pentanedione (DPD) which undergoes
spontaneous cyclization and is then complexed with
borate to form AI-2 (Fig. 1).
The LuxS enzyme responsible for the last enzymatic step
of AI-2 synthesis is present in a wide phylogenetic range of
bacterial genera and AI-2 produced by heterologous

organisms triggers luminescence in the V. harveyi reporter
strains [7,8]. Thus it was hypothesized that AI-2 might be
a universal signal molecule. In addition, a large fraction of
E. coli genes is transcribed differently with culture supernatants containing AI-2 compared to culture supernatants
from luxS- mutants [9,10]. Recently it could be shown that
the expression of important genes of the virulence islands
in E. coli serotype O157:H7 (EHEC) is controlled by a
LuxS dependent molecule, which was later shown to be
not AI-2 but AI-3 whose structure is not known yet and
which does not activate the V. harveyi bioreporter strain
[11]. It is also produced by the gut microflora. Moreover,
the host hormone epinephrine activates virulence gene
transcription through the same signalling pathway as AI3, resulting in cross-talk between host and bacterium [11].
Knock-out mutants for luxS have been investigated for
modifications of infectious phenotypes in some of the

currently sequenced pathogens. In V. cholerae [4,5], Streptococcus pyogenes [12,13], Streptococcus pneumoniae [14],
Neisseeria meningitidis [15] and Clostridiuim perfringens
[16] luxS- mutants showed severe defects in the expression
of virulence factors. In some other pathogens luxSmutants showed none or very subtle changes in virulence
related traits (e.g. Borrelia burgdorferi, [17]; Porphyromonas
gingivalis, [18]; Shigella flexneri, [19]). In Salmonella typhimurium AI-2 controls the expression of an ABC transporter which is responsible for the back transport of AI-2
into the cell, presumably to conserve metabolic energy or
to interfere with quorum sensing mechanisms of the gut
microflora [20].
The signal detection system for AI-2 from Vibrio strains is
well experimentally proven [4] (Fig. 2). In V. harveyi it is
composed of a soluble periplasmic AI-2 binding protein
LuxP, and a phosphorelay cascade resulting in density
dependent activation of the lux operon (Fig. 2). The first
step in this cascade is formed by the hybrid sensor kinase
LuxQ, which contains both a N-terminal periplasmic
membrane bound sensory domain and a C-terminal
intracellular response regulator domain [21]. The signal is
then transferred to the phosphorelay protein LuxU [22].
This phosphotransferase receives phosphorylation signals
both from LuxQ and from LuxN, the parallel, homoserine
lactone based quorum sensing circuit of Vibrio strains. It
phosporylates the final response regulator, LuxO, which
belongs to a large, highly conserved family of sigma54
dependent transcriptional regulators. LuxO has three conserved domains, e.g. the response regulator domain, the
sigma54 activation domain, and a HTH (helix turn helix)
motif for direct DNA binding [23]. At low cell density and

in the absence of autoinducers, LuxQ autophosphorylates. The signal is transferred from its conserved aspartate residue to the histidine residue of LuxU, which
phorphorylates the aspartate residue of the response regulator LuxO. In its phosphorylated (activated) form, and
together with sigma54, LuxO activates the expression of
small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs). The complexes of these
sRNAs and the sRNA chaperone protein Hfq destabilize
the mRNA of the quorum-sensing master regulator LuxR,
resulting in the indirect repression of the lux operon transcription [24]. At high cell density, AI-2 present in the
periplasmic space binds to the protein LuxP, which converts LuxQ from kinase to phosphatase. This reverses the
flow of phosphate through the pathway, from LuxO to
LuxU and then to LuxQ. In this case, sRNAs are not
expressed. Without destabilization of the sRNA-Hfq complex, LuxR is translated and consequentially the transcription of the Lux operon is switched on.
The LuxS enzyme responsible for the last enzymatic step
of AI-2 synthesis has at the same time an important function in the activated methyl cycle of the cell, since it is necessary for recycling of the toxic intermediate SAH [25].
Two pathways are known to be able to degrade and recycle
SAH (Fig. 1). One pathway is composed of two successive
enzymatic reactions catalysed by LuxS and Pfs. This pathway produces adenine, homocysteine and DPD which can
be complexed with borate and converted to AI-2 by two
non-enzymatic spontaneous reactions. The other pathway
contains only one enzymatic step catalysed by SAH hydrolase (SahH) and produces adenosine and homocysteine.
There is no AI-2 production through this pathway.
Homocysteine can be further recycled to methionine by

MetE or MetH and then activated to SAM by SAM
synthetase.
Despite intensive research on AI-2 in the last years the
available data do in many cases not allow to clearly separate the metabolic function of the LuxS gene product from
its possible signalling activity in interspecies communication. Winzer and his colleagues [25,26] analysed the available genomes (by April 2003) for the presence of LuxS
and related genes and critically reviewed the available
experimental data with respect to the potential signalling
function of AI-2. The emphases of these studies were on
the genes pfs, luxS and sahH. A large-scale and more
detailed comparative genomic analysis of other genes
involved in the AI-2 related metabolic and signal transduction pathways is missing. Therefore, we present here a
comprehensive investigation of the phylogenetic distribution of all the genes involved in the synthesis of AI-2, the
detoxification of SAH, as well as the signalling cascade
necessary for the detection of AI-2 by analysing 138 completely sequenced genomes from the KEGG database [42]
and the EMBL database [43]. While LuxS is the enzyme
necessary for AI-2 production, it is not required for AI-2
signal transduction. Theoretically, an organism may not
be able to produce AI-2 but have the ability to detect the
presence of coexisting or competing bacterial species by
sensing the environmental concentration of AI-2. This is
the case in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [27]. Therefore, not
only the LuxS-containing organisms but also all other
sequenced genomes have been analysed for the existence
of the AI-2 signal transduction cascade.

Results
Metabolic pathways involved in SAH degradation and
recycling
SahH and Pfs/LuxS are alternative pathways for recycling of SAH
The distribution of the orthologs of the proteins involved
in AI-2 production, SAH degradation and recycling, and
AI-2 signalling is listed in Supplementary Table s1 and s2
[additional file 1 and 2]. As shown in Supplementary
Table s1 [additional file 1], 80% of the 138 completely
sequenced genomes have at least one pathway to degrade
SAH. 51 organisms have only the two-step pathway using
Pfs and LuxS, while 60 have only the one-step pathway
using SahH (Fig. 1). The remaining one-fifth having neither pathway mainly belong to symbionts, intracellular
parasites, Mollicutes or Chlamydiates. They probably rely
on their host to recycle the toxic intermediate. With the
exception of Bifidobacterium longum NCCC2705 and
Escherichia blattae, no organism has both the sahH and
luxS gene. Interestingly, each organism has only a single
copy of the highly conserved luxS gene. These results are
consistent with the studies of Winzer and his colleagues
[26].

Phylogenetic distribution of SAH detoxification pathways
The presence of either a one-step or a two-step detoxification pathway for SAH follows a phylogenetic pattern.
Eukarya and Archaea use exclusively the one-step pathway
to degrade SAH, while Bacteria use either the one-step or
the two-step pathway depending on their phylogenetic
position (Fig. 3). The two-step Pfs/LuxS pathway is consistenly present in all Firmicutes and absent in Actinobacteria (with the exception of Bifidobacterium longum).
Within the Proteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria clearly
use the one-step detoxification pathway, while there is a
dividing line going across the Betaproteobacteria and the
Gammaproteobacteria. For the Betaproteobacteria, the
pathogen Neisseria meningitidis uses the two step pathway,
while Ralstonia solanacearum and Nitrosomonas europaea
use the one-step pathway. With the exception of the Xanthomonadales and Pseudomonadales, all Gammaproteobacteria presently sequenced use the Pfs/LuxS pathway.

Only one or two representatives have been sequenced
from other microbial phyla, so it is premature to generalize these findings. However, presently the Pfs/LuxS pathway has been found in Borrelia burgdorferi (Spirochaetes)
and Deinococcus radiodurans R1 (Deinococcus-Thermus),
while the organisms from other sequenced phyla (Chlorobia, Bacteroidetes, Aquificae, Thermotogae) use the SahH
pathway. The second sequenced strain from the phylum
Spirochates, Leptospira interrogans, uses the SahH pathway.
These results are also consistent with the analysis of
Winzer et al. [26].
Exploring the ERGO database [44] containing approximately 400 genomes, of which appr. 200 are microbial
genomes, resulted in a consistent conclusion on the distribution pattern of SAH hydrolase or Pfs/LuxS degradation
pathways (data not shown).
Phylogeny of LuxS
The sequences of LuxS orthologs were aligned and a phylogenetic tree was built from the alignment. There are
clearly three bigger branches in the phylogenetic tree (Fig.
4). The first contains most Gram negatives, i.e. Gammaand Betaproteobacteria. The second brach is comprised
mainly of Lactobacillales, but contains some other groups
as well. Interestingly, the LuxS ortholog from Bifidobacterium longum, which is the only species of Actinobacteria
having LuxS, and which at the same time has the SahH
pathway for recycling of SAH, is most closely related to
that of the phylogenetically only distantly related Lactobacillus plantarum. Both bacteria share the same habitat,
being commensals of the healthy human gut. There
would have been ample opportunities for B. longum to
acquire luxS by horizontal gene transfer from Lactobacillus.
The Lactobacillus branch also contains a small subcluster
with luxS from Borrelia burgdorferi, a Spirochete, which is

most similar to luxS from Clostridium acetobutylicum. The
third branch is dominated by Bacillales. Interestingly, it
also includes two of three sequenced Epsilonproteobacteria, namely two strains of Helicobacter pylori. However, the
closely related Campylobacter jejuni forms a separate,
deeply branching lineage. These data confirm those of
Lerat & Moran [28]. Small differences can be attributed to
the treeing methods used, e.g. the position of Campylobacter jejuni luxS and the fact that γ-Proteobacterial LuxS
genes were monophyletic in our analysis, but comprised
two different branches in their tree. In addition, we
included luxS sequences from Enterococcus faecalis and
Deinococcus radiodurans. The robustness of the tree topology is caused by the high degree of conservation of luxS
and strongly supports the resulting conclusions regarding
gene transfer for some species.
Transformation of homocysteine to methionine
To complete the metabolic cycle of SAH, the common
product homocysteine of the two degradative pathways is
converted to methionine by a homocysteine methyltransferase (MetE, 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate–
homocysteine methyltransferase or MetH, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate–homocysteine methyltransferase), then to
SAM by SAM synthetase (MetK). SAH is one of the products of SAM-dependent transmethylases. The distribution
of MetE, MetH and MetK was analysed in a similar way to
LuxS (Supplementary Table s1 [additional file 1]). As a
general rule, bacteria that have one of the two pathways to
degrade SAH are also able to recycle homocysteine to
methionine and to synthesize SAM. This conclusion again
supports the importance of the degradation and recycling
of SAH. As the only few exceptions, the strains Helicobacter
pylori, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis lack
MetE/MetH but have MetK. The overview of such enzymes
in Eukarya and Archaea is more complicated probably
because of their incomplete identification by searching
homologues to proteins with known functions or because
of the existence of other unknown pathways or enzymes
in these organisms.
Signal transduction pathway of AI-2
Reciprocal best hit strategy
The reciprocal best-hit orthologs of the signal transduction cascade (LuxP, LuxQ, LuxU and LuxO) from Vibrio
for the sequenced genomes are listed in Supplementary
Table s1 and s2 [additional file 1 and 2]. Unlike the broad
distribution of LuxS, the orthologs of the AI-2 binding
protein LuxP and the regulator LuxU were found exclusively in Vibrio strains. And only Vibrio strains have both
the orthologs for the hybrid sensor kinase LuxQ and the
two component response regulator LuxO. In addition, five
other orthologs of LuxQ were found using the reciprocal
best hit strategy, namely in Brucella melitensis, Brucella suis,
Streptococcus agalactiae (two different strains), and in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/36

Methanosarcina mazei. For the two component response
regulator LuxO, four additional orthologs were found in
Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus plantarum and Thermotoga maritima. Given the complexity of the proteins involved and the limited number of
sequences presently available, it is not possible to draw
consistent conclusions from this finding at this point.
Unidirectional best hit search
However, if not the reciprocal best-hit strategy but the unidirectional best-hit search was applied, 28 organisms were
found to have homologues to LuxP. The LuxP homologues of 25 of these organisms were more similar to Dribose binding proteins of Vibrio strains than to the AI-2
binding protein LuxP. We reconstructed the 3D models of
LuxP proteins from different Vibrio strains by applying the
method of SwissModel. All these LuxP proteins have similar 3D structures as expected from the high similarity of
their sequences (data not shown). The three-dimensional
structure of LuxP is very similar to that of D-ribose-binding proteins [6]. Because of the structural similarity
between the ligands (AI-2 and D-ribose), and the structural similarity between the binding proteins, the question has to remain open whether the detected LuxPhomologues in the non-Vibrio organisms are actually
functional AI-2 binding proteins.

104 organisms were found to have homologues both for
the hybrid sensor kinase LuxQ, and the two-component
response regulator LuxO. Most organisms had several
homologous genes for these two-component systems, so
that altogether 315 genes were found for LuxQ and 340
for LuxO. This was caused by the fact that several domains
of the sensor and regulator components of signal transduction systems are highly conserved. We were not able to
identify the unique binding domain from the sensor protein LuxQ specific for the detection of the AI-2 signal.

Discussion
Reciprocal or unidirectional best hit
The reciprocal best hit strategy of sequence similarity comparisons was used here to distinguish orthologous from
paralogous genes. Orthologs are genes in different species
that evolved from a common ancestral gene by speciation.
Paralogs are genes originating from duplication events
within a genome. Orthologs tend to retain the same function in the course of evolution, whereas paralogs often
evolve new functions [29]. The reciprocal best hit strategy
is known to be a better method than the unidirectional
best hit method to distinguish orthologs from paralogs
[29]. Here, this was especially significant for the identification of components of the AI-2 signal transduction system. The number of identified orthologs for LuxO and
LuxQ decreases from over 300 down to 7 and 8 by applying the reciprocal best hit strategy. The resulting orthologs

Page 7 of 11

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:36

for LuxO and LuxQ are close to the number of identified
LuxP and LuxU, confirming that the reciprocal best hit
strategy significantly filtered out the potential paralogs.
However, it should be noted that in most cases the functions of these paralogs are not experimentally characterized and cannot be deduced by bioinformatics methods.
Because of the high conservation among these regulatory
components, it is hard to exclude the possibility that some
of them may serve as alternative sensors for detecting the
AI-2. On the other hand, the unidirectional best hits for
the studied metabolic enzymes were basically the same as
the reciprocal best hits, suggesting that the metabolic
enzymes for the activated methyl cycle were seldom duplicated during the course of evolution.
Distribution of LuxS
The presence of either of two possible SAH degradation
pathways in most living cells indicates their importance in
the central cell metabolism. Both Archaea and Eukarya
use exclusively a one-step detoxification pathway for SAH,
indicating that this may be the ancient type of metabolism. The distribution of the two-step Pfs/LuxS pathway
for detoxification of SAH within the domain Bacteria
appears to be phylogenetically conserved. Since the currently sequenced genomes are biased towards pathogens,
it remains to be seen if a similar phylogenetic pattern will
also be found in non pathogenic bacteria from soils, sediments and marine environments. Previous studies
[25,26] came to similar conclusions with respect to the
presence of luxS. Our data strengthen the phylogenetic
aspect of this distribution.

Interestingly, a unique species from the genomes in the
KEGG database, namely Bifidobacterium longum
NCC2705, possesses both pathways. This species is a key
commensal of the healthy human gastrointestinal tract
and vagina. The double pathways may be helpful to recycle and use methionine more economically or to accomplish its dependence on H2S or methanethiol for
methionine biosynthesis [30]. Another non-pathogenic
species, Escherichia blattae, was also identified to have
both pathways (Göttingen Genomics Laboratory, unpublished). However, their physiological roles in this species
have still to be clarified.
The phylogenetic tree of LuxS does not in all cases correspond to the 16S rRNA based microbial phylogeny. Thus,
horizontal gene transfer might have resulted in the acquisition of LuxS genes e.g. in Bifidobacterium longum, Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium acetobutylicum and Borrelia
burgdorferi, with the insect or mammalian gut serving as a
melting pot of species.

Production of AI-2
In most of the microbial genera other than Vibrio spp. having a LuxS enzyme the production of AI-2 has been demonstrated using the Vibrio harveyi reporter strain BB170
(reviewed by Winzer et al. [26]; otherwise citation is
given); e.g. for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacillus anthracis [31]; Borrelia burgdorferi, Campylobacter jejuni,
Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori,
Lactobacillus [32], Neisseria meningitides, Porphyromonas
gingivalis, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella
flexneri, Staphylococcus [27], Streptococcus, Pasteurellaceae,
periodontal pathogens [33] and rumen bacteria [34].
However, only in V. harveyi BB170 it was clearly shown
that the active compound was a furanosyl-borate-diester.
In E. coli serotype O157, Sperandino et al. [11,35-38],
showed that the transcription of essential virulence factors
coded on the LEE genomic island was triggered by an as
yet unknown compound termed autoinducer-3 (AI-3)
which depends on the presence of the luxS gene and did
not elicit luminescence in V. harveyi BB170. Thus, purification of culture supernatants used for detecting AI-2
activity would be required to show that the active fraction
is indeed a furanosyl-borate-diester. Conversely, the "real"
universal signal might be a different, presently unknown
compound produced by a different cyclization product of
DPD or by an enzymatic step downstream of LuxS.
Detection of AI-2
Our data clearly show that the signal transduction cascade
for AI-2 is restricted to Vibrio species. This is consistent
with the results of experimental studies published so far.
No alternative signal transduction cascade for AI-2 has
been experimentally identified in any of the strains studied, with the exception of Salmonella typhimurium [20,39].
Thus, there is no proof that these organisms actually
respond to AI-2 in a quorum sensing related manner.
However, the large diversity of two-component systems
present in these organisms, for which in many cases the
specific signals are not known, makes it quite possible that
one of them might be devoted to the detection of AI-2 or
another LuxS dependent compound. In Salmonella typhimurium, an ABC transporter with high homology to
ribose transporters, which is however not homologous to
LuxP, has been identified whose expression requires the
presence of AI-2 and whose function is to transport it back
into the cell [20,39]. No AI-2 induced genes other than
this transporter have been found, indicating that in this
organism AI-2 may not serve as a quorum sensing signal
or the appropriate cultivation conditions for the expression of its activity were not met. Orthologs of the S. typhimurium lsr genes were found in most Enterobacteriales, as
well as in Sinorhizobium meliloti and some Bacillus sp. (see
Supplementary Table s3 [additional file 3]).

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:36

However, if AI-2 is indeed a universal signal molecule, it
may be useful for bacteria to detect it even if they do not
produce it themselves. This was shown to be actually the
case in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which does not contain the
luxS gene [27]. Here, the promoters of 21 well characterized virulence associated genes were cloned into promoterless luxCDABE reporter plasmids and light induction was
tested in the presence of AI-2 synthesized enzymatically
from SAH or by co-culture with a luxS containing clinical
isolate of Streptotoccus sp. (strain CF004). The fact that six of
these virulence gene promoters were upregulated both by
AI-2 and coculture with CF004 suggests a specific effect of
AI-2 on the transcription of virulence associated genes in
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although the signalling cascade
within the cell is presently unknown.

Conclusions
The presence of luxS in many phylogenetic groups within
the domain Bacteria indicates that these bacteria, while
recycling SAH in a two-step enzymatic process, at the
same time produce a compound able to stimulate luminescence in a V. harveyi reporter strain which is most probably a furanosyl-borate-diester. The detection cascade, if
any, for this compound in the producing organisms must
be different from that in Vibrio strains and is presently not
known. The diversity of physiological effects observed in
luxS- mutants can either be interpreted as the result of a
defect in a global quorum sensing regulatory mechanism,
which may also be caused by a LuxS dependend compound other than AI-2, or as the result of a defect in the
central methyl cycle of the cell. Thus, although there are
intriguing indications for a LuxS dependent universal signal molecule in Bacteria, direct proof regarding the chemical nature of the compound and its signalling mechanism
in non Vibrio organisms is presently missing.

Methods
Databases
The protein sequences of 138 sequenced genomes were
downloaded from KEGG (Status June 2003) and reformatted as local blast databases. The non-redundant protein database of NCBI (nr) [45] and the KEGG Sequence
Similarity Database (SSDB) [46] were explored through
their online services.
Preparation of the queries
To achieve a more complete finding of the proteins functionally similar to the proteins related to either the metabolic pathway (LuxS, Pfs, SahH) or the signal transduction
pathway (LuxP, LuxO, LuxQ, LuxU) of autoinducter-2, the
NCBI protein database was at first searched with the relevant functional terms such as "AI-2 production" or "LuxS".
A phylogenic tree was constructed based on the alignment
of the relevant matches by using the component AlignX of
the bioinformatic software suite "Vector NTI Advance"

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/36

(InforMax, United States). From each branch of the tree, one
protein (mainly the protein of which the function was manually curated, for example, by SWISSPROT) was selected. All
of them were put together into a file as a blast query to represent a function. It is not necessary for the members of this
function to be similar to each other in sequence level. This
facilitates the finding of evolutionarily far-related proteins
by blast search. The protein sequences of MetK, MetE and
MetH from E. coli K12 and LsrR, -A, -B, -C, -D, -E, -F and G
from Salmonella typhimurium [39] were used alone as query.
Blast search
The queries were used to search for their respective orthologs
from the local KEGG genome databases by applying the
reciprocal best hit strategy [40] with a blastp cutoff E-value
1E-4. In the reciprocal best hit strategy, protein i from genome
A is orthologous to protein j from genome B only under the
conditions that j is the best hit when i is queried in database
B and reciprocally i is also the best hit when j is queried in
database A [40]. A Visual Basic script was programmed to
realize this strategy automatically. All identified orthologs
were submitted for further analysis. The NCBI non-redundant protein database nr was searched using the normal onedirection blastp with a cutoff E-value 1E-4. The hits were
manually checked to confirm that they had the same functional annotation as the query.
Phylogenetic tree construction
The phylogenetic tree for the orthologs was built with the
neighbour-joining (NJ) method [41] using Vector NTI
Advance (InforMax, United States) after the sequences
had been aligned.
