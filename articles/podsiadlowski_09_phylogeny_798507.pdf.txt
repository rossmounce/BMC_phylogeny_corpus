Abstract
Background: The new animal phylogeny established several taxa which were not identified by
morphological analyses, most prominently the Ecdysozoa (arthropods, roundworms, priapulids and
others) and Lophotrochozoa (molluscs, annelids, brachiopods and others). Lophotrochozoan
interrelationships are under discussion, e.g. regarding the position of Nemertea (ribbon worms),
which were discussed to be sister group to e.g. Mollusca, Brachiozoa or Platyhelminthes.
Mitochondrial genomes contributed well with sequence data and gene order characters to the
deep metazoan phylogeny debate.
Results: In this study we present the first complete mitochondrial genome record for a member
of the Nemertea, Lineus viridis. Except two trnP and trnT, all genes are located on the same strand.
While gene order is most similar to that of the brachiopod Terebratulina retusa, sequence based
analyses of mitochondrial genes place nemerteans close to molluscs, phoronids and entoprocts
without clear preference for one of these taxa as sister group.
Conclusion: Almost all recent analyses with large datasets show good support for a taxon
comprising Annelida, Mollusca, Brachiopoda, Phoronida and Nemertea. But the relationships
among these taxa vary between different studies. The analysis of gene order differences gives
evidence for a multiple independent occurrence of a large inversion in the mitochondrial genome
of Lophotrochozoa and a re-inversion of the same part in gastropods. We hypothesize that some
regions of the genome have a higher chance for intramolecular recombination than others and gene
order data have to be analysed carefully to detect convergent rearrangement events.

Background
Starting about 25 years ago molecular phylogenetic
approaches established a new system of animal taxonomy

[1,2]. Bilateria are split into three major subtaxa, the traditional Deuterostomia and two recently established
groups, which were founded initially by molecular eviPage 1 of 14

dence: the Ecdysozoa (combining arthropods with
nemathelminth taxa like nematodes, priapulids etc.) and
the Lophotrochozoa (comprising the taxa formerly combined in Spiralia, except Arthropoda, but additionaly
including the lophophorate taxa Brachiopoda, Phoronida
and Ectoprocta). Despite controversy about the specific
position of some taxa, these three major groups now seem
to be well established and are frequently recovered in
analyses of different molecular datasets like ribosomal
RNAs [3-6], mitochondrial genomes [7-9] and EST datasets [10-13].
The lophotrochozoan taxon Nemertea (ribbon worms)
comprises about 1150 free-living species, most of which
inhabit marine environments, but a few species also occur
in freshwater and even in terrestrial habitats [14]. Morphological characters like the acoelomate organisation,
the architecture of the nervous system, the sense organs
and the protonephridial excretory structures were arguments for the traditional placement of Nemertea close to
the Platyhelminthes (reviewed in [15]), while a trochophora-like larva with a prototroch gives some evidence for
an inclusion into Trochozoa [16]. Special features like the
closed circulatory system (in an acoelomat body cavity!)
and the retractable proboscis, serving for prey catching,
are apomorphies which clearly support monophyly of the
Nemertea [17].
Nemerteans are among the first acoelomates to be
brought together with coelomates, providing the ground
for the 'new view' of animal phylogeny [18]. Meanwhile
further molecular analyses came up with diverse hypotheses for their phylogenetic position. Depending on datasets
and methods used for phylogenetic inference the propsed
sister group of Nemertea was Platyzoa [19], Mollusca
[13,20,21], Molluca + Annelida (= Neotrochozoa)
[22,23]. Recent approaches with large datasets from EST
libraries added another hypothesis: in the phylogenetic
analyses of Dunn et al. [12] and Helmkampf et al. [24]
Nemertea cluster with Brachiopoda and Phoronida.
Animal mitochondrial genomes provide a large set of
orthologous sequence data which are often used in phylogenetic analyses from population to phylum level. In
addition to sequence information several other features
are used to support phylogenetic hypotheses, e.g. gene
order rearrangements, derived secondary structure of
rRNAs and tRNAs, changes in genetic code (for a review
see [25]). Mitochondrial gene order data had an early
impact on formation of the Lophotrochozoa hypothesis:
Stechmann and Schlegel [26] demonstrated a highly similar gene order when comparing the brachiopod Terebratulina retusa and the mollusc Katharina tunicata, giving a
strong argument in favour of the Lophotrochozoa
hypothesis. The main difference between the two species

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/364

is one big inversion covering about half of the entire
genome. Gene order of the partial mitochondrial genome
from the nemertean Cephalothrix rufifrons is not much different from that of Katharina and Terebratulina [20].
In this study we present the first complete mitochondrial
genome record for a member of the Nemertea, Lineus
viridis. We use mitochondrial gene order and sequence
data to evaluate the phylogenetic position of Nemertea.
Furthermore, we discuss mitochondrial gene order data
among Lophotrochozoa and conclude that specific inversions may have occurred independently in different taxa,
probably providing a rare example of homoplasious
change of gene order.

Results and Discussion
General features of the mitochondrial genome of Lineus
viridis
All 37 genes usually present in bilaterian animals are
found in the mitochondrial genome of L. viridis (GenBank
accession number FJ839919). All protein-coding and
ribosomal RNA genes, as well as all but two tRNA genes
(trnP, trnT) are found on the same strand, therefore
defined as plus-strand (Table 1, Figure 1). This preference
of one strand is also found in other lophotrochozoan taxa
(Annelida,
Brachiopoda,
Acanthocephala,
Platyhelminthes) [27], as well as in Tunicata [28]. The size of
the genome (15388 bp) is well in the range of other
lophotrochozoans [27]. The complete genome has an AT
content of 65.8%, which is not significantly different from
other Lophotrochozoa like Lumbricus terrestris (62%,
[29]), Katharina tunicata (69%, [30]) or Terebratulina
retusa (57%, [26]). Plus-strand shows a strong GC-skew
(0.306) and AT-skew (-0.352), as the nucleotide composition is clearly biased towards G and T (A: 21.3%, C:
11.9%, G: 22.4%, T: 44.4%).

A total of 676 non-coding nucleotides is found in the mt
genome, comprising about 4.4% of the complete
sequence. The major non-coding region is found between
nad3 and trnS(SGN)/nad2, and has a slightly higher AT
content (68.8%) than the remaining genome. Other
lophotrochozoans with a similar gene order as Lineus
(including the nemertean Cephalothrix rufifrons, [20]) do
not have a non-coding sequence at that position. Near the
3'-end there is a 67 bp segment having the potential of
forming a stem-loop structure. Figure 1 shows this structure and flanking sequences in minus-strand annotation,
to show the flanking regions with putative signal
sequences similar to that described from arthropod control regions [31,32]. The second-largest non-coding part is
found between trnL(UUR) and nad1 (98 bp), which has a
higher AT content than other parts of the genome
(74.5%). Other non-coding regions >10 bp are found
between atp6 and trnC (24 bp), trnY and trnP (12 bp),

Figure map of the mitochondrial genome of Lineus viridis and stem-loop structure of the control region
Circular1
Circular map of the mitochondrial genome of Lineus viridis and stem-loop structure of the control region. tRNA
genes are represented by their corresponding amino acid one letter abbreviation. Except trnT and trnP all genes are on the
same strand and are oriented (5'-3') in clockwise manner. Numbers (+/-) depict noncoding nucleotides between genes or overlapping nucleotides, respectively. The stem-loop structure is annotated minus-strand like, to show signal sequences (boxed)
similar to that found in arthropod control region. The depicted region correspondes to c14260 – c14150 of the GenBank
record.

trnG and cox3 (14 bp), trnA and trnF (11 bp) and trnR and
trnN (27 bp). Between nad4 and trnH there seems to be an
overlap of 10 nucleotides.
Protein-coding genes and rRNAs
All protein-coding genes use exclusively ATG as start
codon, while stop codon TAA (5×) and TAG (4×) are used
almost equally often (Table 1). Four genes have incomplete stop codons (TA-, T-), a feature often found in animal mitochondrial genomes. Incomplete stop codons are
probably subject to post-transcriptional polyadenylation
[33]. All protein-coding genes are encoded on the plusstrand and show a positive GC-skew, ranging from 0.236
in cox1 to 0.505 in nad4L. There is a trend for higher GCskew in usually less conserved sequences like nad3, nad4,
nad5, compared to more conserved genes like cox1-3, cob.
The two ribosomal RNA genes (16S, 12S) are similar in

length to those from other lophotrochozoan taxa, and as
in many bilaterians, both are separated by trnV.
Transfer RNAs
The set of 22 tRNA genes typical for Bilateria were found
in the mitochondrial genome of Lineus viridis (Figure 2).
21 of them can be folded into the typical cloverleaf secondary structure. The cloverleaf structure of tRNASer(AGN) misses the DHU-arm, which is missing in most
metazoan species, and is probably lost early in animal
evolution [34]. A few mismatches are found in the acceptor stem of tRNA-His, tRNA-Lys, tRNA-Leu(UUR), and
tRNA-Phe, as well as in the anticodon stem of tRNA-Glu
and tRNA-Leu(CUN).

Mitochondrial gene order in Lophotrochozoa
Gene order is not conserved in Nemertea, as the partial mt
genome of Cephalothrix rufifrons [20] and the complete mt
genome of Lineus viridis presented here differ in the position of nad6 and five tRNA genes (Figure 3). We assume
that Cephalothrix shows the more derived condition
among Nemertea, as the adjacency of nad6 and cob is very
common in lophotrochozoan and also arthropod mitochondrial genomes. Therefore the condition nad1-nad6cob, as observed in Lineus is likely the plesiomorphic state
in Nemertea. As well the relative positions of most of the
tRNA genes are conserved in Lineus and other nonnemertean taxa. The only exception is trnF, which is in a
derived position in Lineus and in the ancestral position in
Cephalothrix. Lineus is a member of the Heteronemertea,

while Cephalothrix is a member of the Palaeonemertea, a
group which is thought to be the sister group to the
remaining Nemertea [35] and which has many ancestral
characters compared to other Nemertea. It is another
example of the fact that a taxon showing ancestral states
for many characters may as well show derived states in
other character complexes.
Gene order of Lineus viridis is very similar to that of some
other lophotrochozoan taxa. Most of the differences
between lophotrochozoan taxa concern translocations of
tRNA genes, which seem to be more "mobile" than the
larger genes [32,36]. Analysis of relative positions of tRNA
genes yielded no phylogenetic informative character (data
not shown), so we focused on the relative positions of the

Mitochondrial gene order of Nemertea and selected lophotrochozoan species. Colour coded genes show different
positions from that seen in Lineus viridis, according to transpositions (green) or inversions (yellow, orange). The yellow inversion is a potential synapomorphy. tRNA genes are abbreviated by their amino acids (one letter code). Upper genes are plusstrand encoded, lower genes are minus-strand encoded. Gene orders according to the following references: Cephalothrix

protein-coding and rRNA genes. Their gene order is identical in Lineus, the brachiopod Terebratulina retusa [26],
and some gastropods, e.g. Conus textile [37], Ilyanassa obsoleta [38], Thais clavigera (GenBank NC_010090), and
Lophiotoma cerithiformis [39]. Turbeville and Smith [20]
also analysed mitochondrial gene order of a partial
genome of the nemertean Cephalothrix rufifrons. Their gene
adjacency analyses clustered Cephalothrix with molluscs,
preferentially Haliotis, but the brachiopod Terebratulina
was missing in their analyses. Other molluscs like the gastropod Haliotis rubra [40], the polyplacophoran Katharina
tunicata [26] and the cephalopod Octopus vulgaris [41]
show a similar gene order, but distinguished by a large
inversion of about half the mt genome (Figure 3). The segment spanning from trnF to trnE (adjacent to the control
region) is found in opposite direction than the remainder
of the genome. Due to the broader distribution among
Mollusca (Polyplacophora, Gastropoda, Cephalopoda) it
is most parsimonious to assume the gene order of Katharina and Octopus (= with inversion) to be ancient within
molluscs and to interpret gene order in the gastropods
Conus, Ilyanassa and Thais to be secondarily re-inverted
(other molluscs like Scaphopoda and Bivalvia show
strongly derived gene orders compared to the mentioned
species). Besides molluscs a similar inversion is seen in
the mt genome of Phoronis psammophila [42] and, secondarily complicated by another inversion, in the Entoprocts
Loxosomella and Loxocorone [43]. This inversion may be a
synapomorphy of Phoronida + Entoprocta + Mollusca.
However, there is no good support from sequence based
analyses for a clade combining exclusively these three taxa
(see below). Furthermore, an inversion similar to that
described for Lophotrochozoa is found in Ecdysozoa,
comparing arthropod and priapulid gene order [8]. Thus
there is also reason to suspect some parts of the genome
to be more often involved in rearrangements than others.
In particular the mitochondrial control region may represent a region with "predetermined breaking points" in the
mitochondrial genome, as there is non-coding sequence
and no functional gene will be disrupted by a breakpoint.
Besides its position the second breaking point cannot be
further characterized by now. As there is a re-inversion in
some gastropods, we cannot exclude that this inversion
took place independently two or three times in Phoronida, Mollusca and Entoprocta. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to assume that the basal condition in Bilateria or at
least Lophotrochozoa is to have all genes on the same
strand – this is actually seen in Brachiopoda, Annelida,
Platyhelminthes and Acanthocephalans.
Phylogenetic analysis (of mitochondrial amino acid
sequences)
For phylogenetic analyses concatenated amino acid alignments from twelve mitochondrial protein-coding genes
(all but the short and less conserved atp8) were built and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/364

analyzed by maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.
For a preliminary analysis a taxon set of 104 metazoan
species was chosen. Seven species from Porifera and Cnidaria served as outgroup for rooting the Bilaterian tree.
This large taxon set was analysed with a maximum likelihood approach (RAxML) and the best topology was tested
by bootstrapping (Figure 4). Bilateria is split into three
large clades: (1) Deuterostomia + Xenoturbella, (2)
Arthropoda + Onychophora + Priapulida, (3) Lophotrochozoa with some long-branching taxa from other groups,
prominently Nematoda. While many other molecular
datasets favour Ecdysozoa hypothesis, thus a position of
Nematoda with Arthropoda and Priapulida, our result
seems to be artificial due to long-branch attraction. In our
analysis Nematoda, Platyhelminthes, Syndermata and
some subtaxa of Mollusca have the longest branches of all
taxa and cluster together. Molluscan polyphyly is another
strange effect of this problem. In the large dataset
Nemertea are found to be sister group to short-branched
taxa of Mollusca (a polyplacophoran, two gastropods and
two cephalopods), with a bootstrap support of 88%.
Other gastropod species and Bivalvia are found near the
long-branching taxa of Nematoda, Syndermata and Platyhelmithes. Basal splits among Lophotrochozoa do not
exceed moderate support in bootstrap analysis.
For more sophisticated analyses we used a smaller dataset
of 26 lophotrochozoan species and four outgroup members from Deuterostomia and Ecdysozoa. We omitted
Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, Syndermata and some of the
molluscan taxa with long branches. As well we did not use
sequences from Chaetognatha, due to their uncertain relation to Lophotrochozoa and we ignored sequences from
the molluscs Albinaria, Aplysia, Biomphalaria, which did
not cluster with the other molluscs in the first analysis.
The best tree obtained by RAxML with mtRev+G+I (Figure
5) found the two nemertean species as sister group to the
polyplacophoran mollusc Katharina tunicata, but without
bootstrap support exceeding 50%. Thus, Mollusca again
are not monophyletic under these parameters. The best
tree from Treefinder analysis (Figure 6) with a model specified for lophotrochozoan taxa (mtZoa+G+I [44]) has a
different topology, with Entoprocta being sister group to
Nemertea, with moderate support from resampling analysis (edge support by LR-ELW: 88%). The five molluscan
species form a monophylum with 91% edge support and
are sister to the nemertean/entoprocta clade (LR-ELW:
66%). Phoronis is sister to that assemblage. The rest of the
tree is similar to the RAxML tree. The best tree from Treefinder analysis with the mtRev+G+I (topology not shown,
LR-ELW in Figure 6) model differs from that with
mtZoa+G+I only in the position of Myzostoma as sister
group to Ectoprocta. Here, support from LR-ELW for the
Nemertea+Entoprocta relationship is 78%. The best tree
of a Bayesian analysis (mtRev+G+I, topology not shown,

Best tree
Best tree from maximum likelihood analysis (Treefinder, mtZoa+G+I) with the 30 taxa dataset (concatenated
amino acid alignments). Numbers next to nodes reflect edge support percentage (= LR-ELW) from Treefinder with
mtZoa+G+I model (left or upper number), edge support percentage from Treefinder with mtRev+G+I model (middle number)
and Bayesian posterior probability (BPP, mtRev+G+I, right or lower number). In the best tree of Treefinder with mtRev+G+I
model Myzostoma clustered with Ectoprocta (edge support: 51%). The best tree from Bayesian analysis favoured another
topology: Nemertea are sister group to Phoronida+Entoprocta (BPP: 1.0) and Myzostoma clustered with Ectoprocta (BPP:
1.0). Thick lines for clades indicate a combination of edge support above 85% and BPP above 0.95. Scale bar depicts substitutions per site. For complete species names and GenBank accession numbers see Additional file 1. Asterisks indicate taxa with
incomplete mt genome records.
BPP in Figure 6) of the same dataset resulted in a taxon
combining Entoprocta and Phoronis as sister group to
Nemertea (BPP: 1.0). Here, Mollusca is monophyletic
(BPP: 0.96), while Myzostoma clustered with Ectoprocta
(BPP: 1.0) instead of annelids as in the shown trees. The
remaining tree topology is the same as in the TreefindermtZoa analysis. All four analyses favour a clade combining Phoronida, Entoprocta, Nemertea and Mollusca
(RAxML/mtRev: 87%, Treefinder/mtZoa: 98%, Treefinder/mtRev: 98%, MrBayes/mtRev: 1.0). AU test of the
RAxML analyses with constrained trees (Table 2) rejects
the hypotheses of sister group relationships
Nemertea+Annelida or Nemertea+Brachiopoda. Mollusca, Phoronida and Entoprocta cannot be excluded as
possible sister groups to Nemertea according to that test.
Dunn et al. [12], analysing a large EST dataset, found
Entoprocta as sister group to the remaining taxa Mollusca,
Annelida, Phoronida, Brachiopoda and Nemertea.
Nemerteans are found to be sister group to Brachiopoda
in one of their analyses, and sister group to a clade combining Brachiopoda and Phoronida in the second analysis
(with a slightly reduced taxon set). The latter assemblage
found support in some of their parameter settings. Here,
Annelida sensu lato were the sister group of Nemertea,
Brachiopoda and Phoronida, but only with moderate support. Struck & Fisse [13] found good support for Mollusca+Nemertea in Bayesian analyses of an amino acid
alignment derived from EST data, while ML analyses were

rather indifferent between Annelida and Mollusca as sister
group to Nemertea. But these analyses did not include
phoronid and brachiopod species. A partial mitochondrial genome of another nemertean species, Cephalothrix
rufifrons, was previously published [20]. The corresponding phylogenetic analyses favoured an affinity to molluscs, which appeared paraphyletic in that study.

Conclusion
Phylogenetic analyses of available mitochondrial
sequence data (concatenated amino acid sequences) do
not clearly resolve lophotrochozoan interrelationships,
but favour a clade combining Nemertea, Mollusca, Phoronida and Entoprocta on one hand, Brachiopoda, Ectoprocta, Annelida, Sipuncula and Myzostomida on the
other. Recent large analyses of EST datasets with similar
taxon sampling came to other results. Mitochondrial gene
order is very similar in Nemertea, some brachiopods and
some molluscs, suggesting a shared ground pattern at least
for a lophotrochozoan subtaxon. Phoronid and entoproct
gene order is easily derivable from this ground pattern,
while gene order of annelids and ectoprocts seems to be
strongly derived, also in comparison to gene order of outgroup taxa from Ecdysozoa and Deuterostomia. In conclusion, none of the recent molecular based studies
(mitochondrial genomes, EST approaches) found support
for a relationship between Nemertea and Platyhelmithes,
but the sister group to Nemertea remains an open question with more evidence for the candidates Mollusca,
Phoronida, Entoprocta, Brachiopoda and less evidence
for Annelida.

Methods
Animal samples and DNA extraction
Specimen of Lineus viridis were sampled on the island Sylt
and fixed in 99.8% ethanol. DNA extraction was done
with DNeasy Blood and Tissue kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturers protocol for animal
tissue.
PCR and sequencing
Several standard PCR primer sets were tested to yield fragments of mitochondrial genes. Amplification was success-

ful with the following primers: cox1: LCO-1490, 5'-GGT
CAA CAA ATC ATA AAG ATA TTG G-3'; HCO-2198, 5'TAA ACT TCA GGG TGA CCA AAA AAT CA-3' [45]; 16S:
16SarL, 5'-CGC CTG TTT AAC AAA AAC AT-3'; 16SbrH, 5'CCG GTC TGA ACT CAG ATC ACG T-3' [46]. All PCRs
were performed on Eppendorf Mastercycler and Mastercycler gradient. In these short-range PCR experiments
Eppendorf 5-prime-Taq kit (Eppendorf, Germany) was
used in 50 μl volumes (5 μl buffer; 1 μl dNTP mix, 10 μM;
0.25 μl Taq polymerase; 1 μl DNA, 40.75 μl water, 1 μl
primer mix, 10 μM each). PCR products were purified
using the Nucleospin kit (Macherey & Nagel). PCR conditions were: initial denaturation (94°C, 1 min), 40 cycles
of denaturation (94°C, 30 sec), annealing (50°C, 30 sec),
and elongation (68°C, 1 min), followed by a final elongation step (68°C, 1 min). These PCR products were
sequenced using the Beckman-Coulter CEQ 8000
machine and DTCS kit (Beckman-Coulter) following the
manufacturers protocol, except for using 10 μl volumes
instead of 20 μl for the sequencing reaction.
These initial sequences along with mitochondrial
sequences from an EST library generated by one of the
authors [13,46] were used to design long-range PCR primers covering the complete mitochondrial genome of
Lineus viridis. PCR was successfully performed with the
primer sets Lv-cox1r (5'-CCA GTA CCA ACC AAA CCA
GAC C-3')/Lv-16Sf (5'-AAA AGA TTG CGA CCT CGA TGT
T-3) and Lv-16Sf (5'-AAA AGA TTG CGA CCT CGA TGT3')/Lv-cox1r (5'-CCA GTA CCA ACC AAA CCA GAC C-3').
Long-range PCR was done with Takara LA Taq kit (Takara,
distributed in Germany by MoBiTec) in 50 μl Volumes
(34.5 μl water; 5 μl PCR buffer; 8 μl dNTP mix; 0.5 μl LA
Taq; 1 μl primer-mix, 20 μM; 1 μl DNA). PCR conditions
were: initial denaturation (94°C, 1 min), 40 cycles of
denaturation (94°C, 30 sec), annealing (55°C, 1 min),
and elongation (65°C, 12 min), followed by a final elongation step (65°C, 10 min). Long-range PCR products
were purified using the Nucleospin kit (Macherey &
Nagel) and subsequently used for a shotgun cloning
approach (done in commission by Max Planck Institute of
Molecular Genetics, Berlin).
Sequence assemblage and annotation
Sequences were assembled using Bioedit [47]. Detection
and annotation of tRNA genes was done making use of
ARWEN [48] and tRNA scan SE [49]. Protein-coding and
rRNA genes were firstly identified by BLAST search, then
gene boundaries were detected in comparison with alignments of several lophotrochozoan taxa. Nucleotide composition was computed using Bioedit and GC- and ATskew was determined by using the formulation of Perna
and Kocher [50].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/364

Phylogenetic analysis
For phylogenetic analysis a concatenated dataset of mitochondrial amino acid alignments from 12 genes was built.
The gene atp8 was excluded from the analysis, due to the
fact that it is missing from many genomes (nematodes,
platyhelminthes, chaetognaths), and that it is the smallest
and least conserved of the protein-coding genes. Sequence
data from 104 species, most of them with complete mt
genome entries were retrieved from GenBank, for accession numbers see Additional file 1. Alignments were done
with ClustalW [51] as implemented in Bioedit [47]. For
the large dataset non-conserved sites were excluded from
likelihood analyses making use of the Gblocks software
[52], with the following parameter settings: minimum
number of sequences for a conserved position: 55; minimum number of sequences for a flanking position: 55;
maximum number of contiguous nonconserved positions: 8; minimum length of a block: 10; allowed gap
positions: with half. In this case 2294 amino acid sites (=
49%) were recovered from the original dataset of 4654
amino acids. For maximum likelihood analysis, we used
RAxML 7.0.4 [53,54] as offered on the CIPRES web portal.
We choose mtRev+G+I, because mtRev was the only
model derived from mitochondrial data available on this
platform. We performed a search for the best tree and 100
bootstrap replicates. For more sophisticated analyses we
chose a smaller dataset focussed on Lophotrochozoa (26
species) and using four species of Ecdysozoa and Deuterostomia representing the outgroup to Lophotrochozoa.
Due to the better conservation among the alignments we
used the complete alignments of twelve protein-coding
genes and built a concatenated alignment with a final
length of 3820 amino acids.

We used this smaller dataset to test different models in
maximum likelihood analysis (mtRev, mtZoa), run a
Bayesian analysis and performed hypothesis testing of
alternative topologies. With the smaller dataset a partitioned model optimization was done in that we partitioned the dataset according to the 12 genes. Besides
RAxML with mtRev+G+I (100 bootstrap runs) we used
Treefinder v. Oct 2008 [55] to perform a maximum likelihood analysis with mtRev+G+I and the self implemented
mtZoa+G+I model (each with LR-ELW, 1000 replications). The mtZoa model is optimzed for amino acid
alignments from lophotrochozoan taxa [44]. In all likelihood analyses, models were the same for each partition
but optimized in an unlinked manner between the partitions. In addition a Bayesian analysis was performed with
MrBayes 3.1.2 [56]. 1,000,000 generations of two times
four parallel chains were run, by sampling one tree out of
thousand. According to the log likelihood plots 200 trees
were discarded as burnin. Model settings were mtRev+G+I
(unpartitioned due to time limitations). Hypothesis testing was done by computing best trees and per site likeli-

hoods with RAxML (mtRev+G+I) for a set of constrained
trees. Per site likelihoods were used to perform the AU-test
[57], by making use of CONSEL 0.1j [58].
