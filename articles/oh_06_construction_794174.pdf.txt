Abstract
Background: To infer the tree of life requires knowledge of the common characteristics of each
species descended from a common ancestor as the measuring criteria and a method to calculate
the distance between the resulting values of each measure. Conventional phylogenetic analysis
based on genomic sequences provides information about the genetic relationships between
different organisms. In contrast, comparative analysis of metabolic pathways in different organisms
can yield insights into their functional relationships under different physiological conditions.
However, evaluating the similarities or differences between metabolic networks is a
computationally challenging problem, and systematic methods of doing this are desirable. Here we
introduce a graph-kernel method for computing the similarity between metabolic networks in
polynomial time, and use it to profile metabolic pathways and to construct phylogenetic trees.
Results: To compare the structures of metabolic networks in organisms, we adopted the
exponential graph kernel, which is a kernel-based approach with a labeled graph that includes a label
matrix and an adjacency matrix. To construct the phylogenetic trees, we used an unweighted pairgroup method with arithmetic mean, i.e., a hierarchical clustering algorithm. We applied the kernelbased network profiling method in a comparative analysis of nine carbohydrate metabolic networks
from 81 biological species encompassing Archaea, Eukaryota, and Eubacteria. The resulting
phylogenetic hierarchies generally support the tripartite scheme of three domains rather than the
two domains of prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
Conclusion: By combining the kernel machines with metabolic information, the method infers the
context of biosphere development that covers physiological events required for adaptation by
genetic reconstruction. The results show that one may obtain a global view of the tree of life by
comparing the metabolic pathway structures using meta-level information rather than sequence
information. This method may yield further information about biological evolution, such as the
history of horizontal transfer of each gene, by studying the detailed structure of the phylogenetic
tree constructed by the kernel-based method.

Background
The availability of pathway databases such as Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), What is there?
(WIT3), PathDB, and MetaCyc opens up various new possibilities for comparative analysis. In particular, information about metabolic pathways in different organisms
yields important information about their evolution and
offers a complementary approach to phylogenetic analysis. Here we present a comparative metabolomic
approach to constructing phylogenetic trees that uses
physiological functions of the organisms by computing
the structural similarity of metabolic networks. The consideration of metabolic components complements the
conventional approaches to phylogeny based on genome
sequences. Recognizing the similarities and differences in
metabolic functions between species may provide insights
into other applications in biotechnology, ecology, and
evolutionary studies. Several researchers have attempted
to rebuild evolutionary history by comparing ribosomal
RNA sequences [1], by phylogenomics [2], or by comparing whole genomes to overcome the limitations of the
gene-sequence analyses [3-5].
Several recent studies have extended conventional phylogenetic analysis to incorporate metabolic pathway information. Forst and Schulten [6,7] presented one of the
earliest approaches to extend the conventional sequence
comparison and phylogenetic analysis of individual
enzymes to metabolic networks. They also presented a
method to calculate distances between metabolic networks based on sequence information of the biomolecules involved and information about the corresponding
reaction networks. Dandekar et al. (1999) combined strategies in a systematic comparison of the enzymes and corresponding sequence information of the glycolytic
pathway [8]. Other approaches involving the reconstructed phylogenies from gene-order data have been
based on simulating genome evolution [9], and studying
the genome evolution resulting from the metabolic adaptation of the organism to the surrounding environment.
Liao et al. (2002) presented a method to group organisms
by comparing the profiles of metabolic pathways, where
the profiling was based simply on binary attributes (e.g.,

by denoting the presence or absence of pathways in the
organisms) [10].
Whereas the previous approaches incorporated information about the additional metabolic pathways, systematic
methods to calculate the similarities between metabolic
networks are lacking or contain gaps in some of the biological assumptions. In this paper, we introduce the concept of graph kernels to calculate the similarities between
two different network structures. The graph kernel-based
approach can compute more efficiently the similarity of
two graph structures by the kernel function that can
extract important features from the graph. Our approach
contrasts with that of Forst and Schulten [6,7] in that the
graph kernel calculates the distance based on the network
level instead of on its sequence information on the biomolecules involved.
In their comparative analysis of metabolic pathways, Heymans and Singh [11] showed that phylogenetic trees
could be made from the graph similarities of metabolic
networks. They applied a distance measure between metabolic graphs of the glycolytic pathway and the citric acid
cycle from 16 organisms. However, some of their data on
phylogenetic inference did not correspond entirely with
the conventional taxonomy and did not provide a global
view of the specialization of species according to the scale
of analyzed species and metabolic pathways.
Several more recent attempts have reconstructed genome
trees using different formalisms such as gene ordering
[12,13], measuring gene contents [3,14], comparing
sequence similarities [15,16], comparing proteome
strings [17], and phylogenomics [18,19]. All are based on
the principle of genome sequences, but none has applied
the concepts of effectible physiology to the phylogenetic
analyses. We report on our comparative results and discuss our findings.

Results and discussion
We chose nine pathways of carbohydrate metabolism and
81 species to perform a comparative analysis of metabolic
networks that satisfied the most abundant dataset from
KEGG (Table 1, 2 and 3). Our sample comprised 13 species of Archaea, eight species of Eukaryota, and 60 species
of Eubacteria. The central pathways of metabolism
include the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways,
and the citric acid cycle, which generate biological energy
and form the metabolic precursors essential for almost all
living cells. To validate the data, we investigated the distribution of each enzyme in the nine pathways. Several
enzymes appear at a high frequency in all species, and this
frequency decreases rather exponentially as the value of xaxis increases (Figure 1), a phenomenon we observed in
all pathways studied. Because the characteristics of the

The phylogeny took two directions: conventional taxonomy that focused on the morphological and physiological
features to classify species, and a numerical taxonomy that
stressed the historical changes in biological sequences.
Phylogenies based on the ribosomal RNA molecules led
to the proposal of a new tripartite scheme of three
domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya [20]. Although
each approach is feasible on its own, it cannot provide a
holistic view of the organism. Current phylogenetic studies indicate that horizontal gene transfer may have played
a vital role in the evolution of major lineages [21]. Lake
and Moore [22] also noted the pitfalls of comparative
genomics based on molecular sequences. Our kernelbased method provides an alternative to the inference of
an evolutionary scenario and allows for a higher-level
comparison of the phylogenetic trees by measuring the
distances between pathways using metabolic network
data to infer an evolutionary scenario.

Consistency with conventional taxonomy
Figure 2 compares the phylogenetic tree constructed by
the kernel method using (a) metabolic networks, and (b)
by the sequence-based analysis of phosphoglycerate
kinase and phosphopyruvate hydratase. The overall tree
structure appears to be consistent with the current classification of the three domains, Eubacteria, Archaea, and
Eukaryota (Figure 3). In the domain of Archaea, methanogens such as Methanosarcina, Methanococcus, and Methanobacterium are clustered in the early branch of Pyrococcus.
Five thermophiles are also clustered in the same branch
with a halophile, Halobacterium. The structure of collective
carbohydrate pathways from Arabidopsis thaliana has the
smallest distance from yeasts (Figure 2). As shown in Figure 2(a), the kernel-based method branches at the levels
of family (Enterobacteriaceae), order (Bacillales), and class

domain of Archaea corresponded largely to that of conventional taxonomy http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/Taxon

In Eukaryota, only the mouse deviated from the taxonomy consensus. Typically, the domain of Archaea always
formed a single cluster in every case in our experiments,
suggesting that the domain of Archaea has peculiar characteristics, at least in the carbohydrate metabolic networks. We conclude that the metabolic structure in
Archaea is distinct from that of the other two domains.

parison of the information-transfer pathways and pathway-level organization between two domains [23],
whereas eukaryotic metabolic enzymes are primarily of
bacterial origin [24].
Inferring hidden order by network clustering
The conventional sequence-based analysis passes over or
does not embrace the discordant evolution of each species
or the horizontal gene transfer [25]. Our method can cope
with this limitation by taking into account the structural
features of individual metabolic networks. The disagreement between the molecular sequence data of operational
genes and the rRNA tree suggests that different genes have
different evolutionary histories [26,27]. To address this
problem, Li studied the mitochondrial genomes in relation to the problem of whole-genome phylogeny, where
evolutionary events, such as genetic rearrangements that
include gene transfer from the exterior, make genome
alignments difficult [28].

To compare the kernel-based comparative analysis of metabolic networks to the sequence-based phylogenetic analysis, we analyzed two enzyme sequences that participate
in carbohydrate metabolism in all 81 species together
using a multiple sequence alignment (Figure 2(b)). In the
resulting phylogenetic tree, Archaea and Eukaryota are
clustered at each terminal; however, short-distance neighboring node members belong to fairly distant taxonomic
groups. The overall structure of the tree eventually
becomes remote from not only that of the kernel-based
method (Figure 2(a)), but also from that of current taxonomy (Figure 3). Although the phylogenetic tree constructed from the multiple alignment of two enzyme
sequences shows a few unusual characteristics, our
approach provides a good solution. The cluster mainly
comprised archaeal species including the bacterial members Chlamydia and Chlamydophila, and had long branches
at the root of the tree. Three eubacterial members (Ana,
Tel, and Syn) are more closely related to Eukaryota than

Eubacteria. Moreover, eubacterial groups are separated
over the topology, and the Eukaryota are inserted between
them (Figure 2(b)).
This result shows an example of the sequence-based phylogenetic approach when we intend to perform phylogenetic analyses for as many species as possible. The
sequence-based phylogenetic analysis can fail to precisely
represent evolutionary history without an analysis using a
set of whole sequences. Unfortunately, analyses using
whole sequences require massive computing power and
are highly complex. A sequence-based phylogenetic analysis can still be limited to cover a number of species,
although alternative approaches exist. However, our
method can easily solve this problem by utilizing given
resources. In order to measure the quality of our constructed trees, we compared the phylogenetic tree based
on our graph kernel method with that of Heymans and
Singh [11] in terms of their similarity to conventional taxonomy. We used a software tool, 'Cousins' [31], which
compares two alternative phylogenetic trees based on
common cousin pairs in the trees. The comparison by
cousin pairs is said to more focus on local similarity
between two trees because it evaluates the similarity based
on a cousin pair within a certain degree. Table 4 shows the
similarity score of our kernel-based method in comparison with [11] for the glycolysis pathways of 65 organisms.
Our method shows a better result in terms of the similarity score with the conventional NCBI taxonomy.
In this paper, we intended to present a meta-level analysis
of biological systems to construct a unitary phylogenetic
tree that could be used to interpret the context of biological evolution. Our results suggest that the phylogenetic
analysis with submetabolic network information might
also allow us to infer horizontal or lateral gene transfer.
Our results also support the tripartite scheme of the three
domains, Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota [20].
Comparing the pathogenic bacterial genomes by focusing
on the pathways of bacterial and eukaryotic aminoacyltRNA synthesis showed that this pathway is uniquely
prokaryotic/archaeal and that it is found widely among
the pathogenic bacteria. This suggests that members of
this pathway can be used as targets for novel antimicrobial
drugs [32]. Metabolic analysis of pathogenic organisms
may play a critical role in the selective treatment or pre-

Biological classification, taxonomy, and systematics are
the profound themes in biology. Using phylogeny in evolutionary classification implies functional and morphological innovation, adaptive range, parallelism, and
convergence. We have used a method based on the graph
kernel to compare information on each metabolic network including cardinality, distance, and topology relating to metabolic networks as a type of undirected graph.
Our results showed that our approach has potential in the
macroscopic analysis of phylogenetic relationships
among organisms in relation to horizontal gene transfer.
To obtain information about each causal mechanism in
the context of a similar phenotype, one should first analyze the phenomena at the level of a protein network. The
analysis of a metabolic network is an example of this type
of analysis. Biological entities that interact with the environment and eventually influence adaptation are a function of the activity of proteins and other bioactive
molecules rather than gene order or genetic history.
The overall structure of the phylogenetic tree constructed
from our experiments supports the tripartite scheme of
the three domains Archaea, Eubacteria, and Eukaryota as
described in an early report of Woese et al. [20]. The structures of metabolic pathway deduced from Archaea are
more similar to those from Eukaryota than to those from
Eubacteria. This agrees with the rooted universal tree of
life [33,34] and the tree of life [35,36]. The metabolic network structures of organisms reflect their functional relationship with the environment, and the similarity might
provide a measure of the organism's physiological functions. The trajectory of an organism's adaptation can be
explained using the structure of its metabolic contents.
Our approach can be extended to more organisms and
applied to other types of biomolecular interactions, such
as physical protein interactions in regulatory networks, to
provide a basis for understanding the functional relationships between biological networks in different organisms.

Methods
We attempt to cluster organisms by comparing sets of
metabolic pathways. Our basic assumption is that different species exhibit overlapping components of metabolic
pathways. To construct phylogenetic trees, the features of
the organism-specific pathways are automatically
extracted by considering the reference pathway. Here, the
features represent the connection information between
two enzymes. Figure 4 summarizes the procedure for the
phylogenetic clustering of organisms by metabolic pathways using four steps:

- Step 1: Build the enzyme-enzyme relation lists.
- Step 2: Convert the lists to graph structures.
- Step 3: Compute similarity by graph kernels.
- Step 4: Build the phylogenetic trees.
We evaluated this method using known experimental data
on a collection of nine metabolic pathways from 81 representative organisms. Figure 5 shows the simple concept
used to compute the distance between two metabolic networks. The resulting phylogenetic trees were cross-compared for consistency with existing methods to analyze
phylogenies. The next section describes the datasets collected and the preparation methods, followed by the definition of graph kernels and their use in comparing and
clustering metabolic networks for phylogenetic analysis.
Data preparation
Dataset
We chose the KEGG database [37] as the resource for previous phylogenetic analysis. KEGG provides both an
online map of pathways and the ability to focus on metabolic reactions in specific organisms. Each reaction may
be uni- or bidirectional.
Representation of organisms
Let O = {O1,..., ON} be a set of N organisms and P = {P1,...,

pathway contains all known alternatives of reaction paths.
The set of organism-specific pathways is defined as P' =
â²
â²
{ P1 ,..., PM }, which contains organism-specific reactions.
If we define a set of enzyme-enzyme relations as R =
{r1,...,rK}, then a subset of R constitutes Pj or Pjâ² (1 â¤ j â¤
M). Here, rk (1 â¤ k â¤ K) is a pair of enzymes {eu, ev}, which
means that eu directly connects with ev. The specific organism Oi (1 â¤ i â¤ N) contains a set of pathways P, defined as
P'(Oi) and including a subset of R for the specific organism, R'(Oi).
Enzyme-enzyme relation lists of organisms
The pathways provided in KEGG are visualized on manually drawn pathway maps or XML-based graphics. To construct enzyme-enzyme relation lists, we used information
about chemical compounds and chemical reactions contained in the LIGAND database [38]. The LIGAND database provides detailed molecular information about one
type of the generalized protein-protein interaction,
namely, the enzyme-enzyme relation. LIGAND is a composite database of ENZYME and COMPOUND. The
ENZYME section contains information about enzymatic
reactions and enzyme molecules, and the COMPOUND
section contains more than 6,000 chemical compounds.
The enzyme-enzyme relationship can be extracted from
information about enzymes contained in the COMPOUND entries. We automatically extracted information

Data analysis
Metabolic networks as labeled graphs
Our approach to estimate the distance between two metabolic networks is based on the graph comparison. Using
the relation list of enzymes, the metabolic network of

each organism is represented by a labeled graph Î = ( ï ,
ï , f), where ï is a vertex set and ï is an edge set. f is a
vertex-labeling function f: ï â ï , where ï = {ál} is a
set of possible labels for vertices.
For an organism Oi, each vertex v â ï i corresponds to an

with 1 â¤ l â¤ | ï |, 1 â¤ a â¤ | ï i|. This means that Li(l, a) is
1 only when the label of vertex va is ál. Since we represent
a metabolic pathway in such a way that every vertex

the presence or absence of vertices (enzymes) but does not
consider the structure of the graph, such that the successive enzymes or reaction steps cannot be considered when
comparing metabolic networks. To capture the structure

reached from a vertex by a subsequent traverse.

where Î² (â¥ 0) is a real-valued parameter and its value is
chosen by performing many tries. When Î² = 0, it recovers
the simple common vertex-counting measure since
exp(0H) = I, the | ï | Ã | ï | identity matrix. Each element Hn(a, b) of the matrix Hn in Equation (5) represents
the number of walks of length n (admitting cycles) from
va to vb, and allows the representation of the global structure of a graph.
Substituting Equation (5) into Equation (4), we can
decompose the kernel function k(Îi, Îj) into two meaningful parts, k(Îi, Îj) = k1(Îi, Îj) + k2(Îi, Îj), where

The kernel function k1 contributes by considering walks of
the same length in both graphs, and k2 can take into
account the insertion or deletion of vertices in the graph
[39]. As the number of movements in a graph increases,
the significance of walks of length n decreases by

Eventually, the exponential matrix eÎ²H can be interpreted
as the product of a continuous process H, from which the
identity matrix expands gradually to the matrix of the global structure of Î [40].
The exponential graph kernel requires the exponentiation
of square matrices Hs. This can be performed by matrix
diagonalization, with time complexity of about O(| ï i|3)
for Hi thus Îi. [39]. The time complexity of the elementwise product of two matrices in k(Îi, Îj) is O(max (| ï i|2,
| ï j|2)). With N graphs, finally, the total time complexity
for constructing the kernel matrix K = {kij} (1 â¤ i, j â¤ N) is
O(NV3 + N2V2) where V = maxi | ï i|.

then the distance metric is simplified as

d(Îi , Î j ) =

( 10 )

To summarize, metabolic networks constructed from reference pathways of N organisms were first converted to
labeled undirected graphs. Each graph Îi (1 â¤ i â¤ N) was
then represented by two matrices: the vertex-label matrix
Li and the adjacency matrix Hi. Using these two matrices,
we can take into account only the local structure (the
direct connectivities between enzymes in pathways) of
networks. To compare networks in terms of their global
structure, we adopted a kernel-based method, which we
named the exponential graph kernel. Finally, the distance
matrix acquired from the kernel function was fed into a
hierarchical clustering algorithm to construct the phylogenetic trees.
Constructing phylogenetic trees
The distance between two organisms was calculated by
comparing their metabolic networks using the measures
mentioned earlier. To construct a phylogenetic tree, we
used an unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic
mean (UPGMA) [41,42], a hierarchical agglomerative
clustering algorithm. Given N organisms, the algorithm
starts by initializing N clusters, each of which contains
exactly one distinct organism, and proceeds by iteratively
merging the two nearest clusters until only one cluster
(called the root of the tree) remains. The dendrogram
derived from UPGMA is a binary tree, which we consider
may represent a binary phylogenetic tree.
