Abstract
Background: Synonymous codon usage varies widely between genomes, and also between genes
within genomes. Although there is now a large body of data on variations in codon usage, it is still
not clear if the observed patterns reflect the effects of positive Darwinian selection acting at the
level of translational efficiency or whether these patterns are due simply to the effects of mutational
bias. In this study, we have included both intra-genomic and inter-genomic comparisons of codon
usage. This allows us to distinguish more efficiently between the effects of nucleotide bias and
translational selection.
Results: We show that there is an extreme degree of heterogeneity in codon usage patterns
within the rice genome, and that this heterogeneity is highly correlated with differences in
nucleotide content (particularly GC content) between the genes. In contrast to the situation
observed within the rice genome, Arabidopsis genes show relatively little variation in both codon
usage and nucleotide content. By exploiting a combination of intra-genomic and inter-genomic
comparisons, we provide evidence that the differences in codon usage among the rice genes reflect
a relatively rapid evolutionary increase in the GC content of some rice genes. We also noted that
the degree of codon bias was negatively correlated with gene length.
Conclusion: Our results show that mutational bias can cause a dramatic evolutionary divergence
in codon usage patterns within a period of approximately two hundred million years.
The heterogeneity of codon usage patterns within the rice genome can be explained by a balance
between genome-wide mutational biases and negative selection against these biased mutations. The
strength of the negative selection is proportional to the length of the coding sequences. Our results
indicate that the large variations in synonymous codon usage are not related to selection acting on
the translational efficiency of synonymous codons.

Background
Synonymous codon usage patterns can vary significantly
among genomes [1,2]. In addition, one can also observe

differences in synonymous codon usage among different
genes within a single genome (e.g., [3,4]). For prokaryotes
and unicellular eukaryotes such as yeast, the variation in

codon usage within a genome is thought to be due to natural selection acting to optimize protein production [5-7].
Specifically, the most highly expressed genes use codons
that are complementary to the most abundant tRNA anticodons (e.g., [8,9]). For multicellular eukaryotes, such as
Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, there is
also some evidence that codon bias might be caused by
selection for translational efficiency [10,11]. For the
majority of multicellular organisms, however, it has been
difficult to explain codon usage variation within a
genome in terms of natural selection. Instead, the codon
usage in mammalian genes appears to be correlated with
the GC content of the chromosomal region that contains
the genes [12]. This correlation has generally been interpreted as meaning that the codon usage of mammalian
genes reflects mutational bias, but a recent report [13] suggests that high GC content increases mRNA levels in
mammalian cells. This would mean that selection for gene
high expression is the primary factor determining the
codon usage bias in this case. Thus, although the correlation between codon usage and nucleotide bias is well documented, the question of whether the nucleotide bias is a
cause or a consequence of the biased codon usage remains
a matter of debate.

dal distribution of GC content among the 14,005 rice
genes, which is consistent with previous reports
[15,17,23]. In contrast to this, the Arabidopsis genes are
characterized by a unimodal distribution with a relatively
low average value for GC content. In the Figure, the vertical line at 60% GC indicates the point at which we separated the rice genes into two classes: High GC genes and
Low GC genes. The average GC content of these two
classes, along with the average for all Arabidopsis genes is
shown in Table 1. From the Table, we can see that the GC
content of the Arabidopsis genes (44.5%) is comparable to
that of the Low GC rice genes (50.1%).

In this study, we examined the patterns of synonymous
codon usage that are seen in the genomes of angiosperm
plants. It is already known that monocot plant genomes
have a higher average GC content than dicot genomes,
and that this difference is reflected in an average difference
in codon usage between monocots and dicots [14,15].
Here, we focused on the heterogeneity in synonymous
codon usage within the rice genome. In particular, we
looked for intra-genomic correlations between codon
usage and nucleotide bias, and we compared the results
found for the rice genes with the results for their
homologs in the Arabidopsis genome. All of the previous
studies of codon usage have focused on either: (i) the
comparison of genes within a single genome (typically, a
comparison of highly expressed genes and lowly
expressed genes); or (ii) differences between genomes,
such as differences in codon usage between prokaryotes
and eukaryotes, or between thermophiles and mesophiles. Here, we have combined a study of contrasting
patterns of codon usage within a genome (rice) with a
comparison of homologous gene sequences between two
genomes (rice and Arabidopsis). This "factorial" design
allows for a number of unique controls in the interpretation of the data.

We also wished to investigate the possible clustering of
GC-rich genes within the rice genome. To do this, we took
a sample of two rice chromosomes and plotted the GC
content at the third codon positions (GC3) against the
position of the genes along the chromosome. For comparison, we did the same analysis for the GC3 content of Arabidopsis genes along the chromosome. The results (see
[33]) show that genes with varying levels of nucleotide
composition are interspersed along the chromosome.

Results
Nucleotide content of rice and Arabidopsis genes
The nucleotide content of rice and Arabidopsis coding
sequences (expressed as percent GC) is summarized in
Figure 1. The Figure shows that there is a distinctly bimo-

Table 1 also presents the data for the third positions of
codons only. In this case, we see the same trends as for all
of the codon positions, but the differences are much
greater. For instance, the GC content of the third codon
positions of the High GC rice genes (80.4%) is almost
twice the values for the Arabidopsis genes (42.8%). Given
that variations in codon usage will affect the third codon
position primarily, this result leads us to expect significant
differences in codon usage between the two classes of rice
genes. We investigated this using Correspondence Analysis (see below).

Correspondence analysis
Correspondence analysis [21] was used to explore the variation in Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU).
Since there are a total of 59 synonymous codons (61 sense
codons, less the unique methionine and tryptophan
codons), this analysis partitions the variation along 59
orthogonal axes, with 41 degrees of freedom. The first axis
is the one that captures most of the variation in codon
usage, with each subsequent axis explaining a diminishing amount of the variance. In contrast to other types of
variance component analysis, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), correspondence analysis has the
advantage of allowing one to not only show the distribution of genes in the multidimensional space, but also to
show the corresponding distribution of synonymous
codons (as shown in Figures 2A and 2B). Correspondence
Analysis is primarily designed for use with data tables containing counts, e.g., numbers of synonymous codons,
whereas PCA is a general method of data reduction that is
more suitable for continuous measurement data. Perriere

and Thioulouse [22] have provided a critical review of the
use of Correspondence Analysis for studies of codon
usage.
Figure 2 shows a correspondence analysis of the synonymous codon usage (RSCU) among the rice genes. The origin in Figure 2A represents the average RSCU for all genes,
with respect to the first two axes. The distance between
genes on this plot is a reflection of their dissimilarity in

RSCU, with respect to the two axes. In this case, the two
axes account for 36.9% and 6.9% of the variation in the
data, respectively. The third axis accounts for approximately 3% of the variation and the remaining axes for
even smaller amounts of the variance each. Thus the first
axis reflects the primary factor that explains the differences
in codon usage among the rice genes. From Figure 2A, we
can see that the rice High GC genes (colored red in the Figure) and Low GC genes (colored blue) separate along this

primary axis. The corresponding distribution of synonymous codons (see Figure 2B) shows the separation of C/
G-ending codons and A/U-ending codons along this same
axis. This indicates that the variations in synonymous
codon usage among the rice genes are based on the nucleotide content of the genes. The separation of genes on the
second axis appears to be largely due to frequency differences in C-ending and G-ending codons among the GC
rich genes (see right side of Fig. 2B).
Although the color coding in Figure 2A suggests a general
relationship between the nucleotide content of genes and
their position on the first axis of the correspondence analysis, it does not give us any statistical measure of this relationship. To do this, we calculated the correlation
between the GC content of individual rice genes and their
location on the primary axis of the Correspondence Analysis. The results were highly significant (R = 0.96, p <
0.00001), indicating that the variations in codon usage
are strongly correlated with the nucleotide content (i.e.,
GC content) of the genes.
Effective number of codons
We further investigated the relationship between nucleotide content and codon usage by calculating the effective
number of codons for each of the rice genes. The effective
number of codons [20] is a measure of the evenness of
codon usage among the 61 sense codons. At one extreme
is all codons are used equally frequently (given the
observed frequencies of amino acids) the effective
number of codons is 61. If, at the other extreme, a single
codon only is used for each amino acid, then the effective
number of codons is reduced to 20. In most cases, the
observed number falls somewhere between these
extremes. Figure 3 shows the relationship between the
effective number of codons (Nc) and the GC content at
the third position of each gene (GC3). This Figure also
contains a reference line (GCref) showing the expected
position of genes whose codon usage is constrained solely
by the nucleotide composition at the third codon position
[20]. From the Figure, it can be seen that the observed
value of Nc tracks the reference line quite closely. This
indicates that the nucleotide composition at the third
codon position is a major determinant of the effective
number of codons. A polynomial line, to the power of 2,
that regresses Nc on GC3s (not shown in the figure) fits
the data very well (R2 = 0.82, p < 0.00001). Essentially, the
effective number of codons decreases as the GC content
increases.
Homologous gene pairs
Although the preceding results clearly establish a strong
correlation between nucleotide content and codon usage
within the rice genome, they do not tell us which of the
two is the causal factor. In an effort to understand the bio-

logical basis of these differences in codon usage and
nucleotide content within the rice genome, we compared
these rice genes with their homologs in Arabidopsis. We
used a BLAST search to identify 7,160 pairs of homologous genes in rice and Arabidopsis (see Methods).
We first calculated the GC content of the homologous
gene pairs. Among these gene pairs, we found that the GC
content of the Arabidopsis homologs remains unimodal, as
is shown for the full set Arabidopsis genes in Figure 1,
whereas the content of the rice homologs remains bimodal, again as shown in Figure 1 for the complete rice data
set. Thus, the overall differences between the genomes
that are seen in Figure 1 cannot be due to differences in
gene content between the two species because they are
still present in the homologous gene set.
We then computed relative synonymous codon usage values for the homologous genes and performed a new correspondence analysis. The results are shown in Figure 4.
Here we see that the High GC and Low GC rice genes (now
defined within the homologous set) again separate along
the first axis of the analysis, whereas all of the Arabidopsis
genes are clustered on the left side of the plot. In other
words, the use of homologous genes does not alter the
result that we observed in Figure 2. Furthermore, all of the
Arabidopsis genes have generally similar patterns of codon
usage, regardless of whether they are homologs of High
GC or Low GC rice genes. This suggests that the divergence
in codon usage patterns among rice genes has occurred
since the evolutionary divergence of the dicots and monocots approximately 200 million years (My) ago, i.e., over
a relatively short evolutionary time.
Although our results suggest that the GC content of the
High GC rice genes has increased significantly since the
divergence of the monocots and dicots, there remains the
formal possibility that, instead, the Arabidopsis genes have
recently converged toward a common, lower GC content.
To distinguish between these possibilities, we extracted 92
homologous sequences from the genome of Pinus taeda,
and we used these as an out-group to infer the direction of
the change. Whereas the High GC rice genes have an average GC content of 66.6 (SE 0.08) and their Arabidopsis
homologs have an average GC content of 46.0 (SE 0.07),
the average GC content of the P. taeda homologs is 45.2
(SE 0.04). Thus we can infer that the ancestral condition
was similar to that currently seen in Arabidopsis.
Correlation of gene length with GC content
Gene length has previously been shown to be negatively
correlated with codon usage in C. elegans, Drosophila and
Arabidopsis [25]. We tested to see whether the same relationship holds true for rice genes. We compared the average gene lengths of the two groups of rice genes (High GC

and Low GC), as defined in Figure 1. Not only did we find
that the High GC genes were shorter, as suggested by previous studies in other species, but the magnitude of this
length difference was surprisingly large and highly significant (p < 0.0001). Specifically, the average length of the
Low GC coding sequences (1417 +/- 13 bp) is approximately 500 bp larger than the average for the High GC
genes (921 +/- 9 bp). Although there is a wide range of
individual gene lengths within each class, this highly significant average difference suggests that the length of the
rice genes was a significant factor in the evolutionary
increase in GC content.

Discussion
Our survey of codon usage patterns among rice genes
shows that there is a wide, multimodal distribution
within this genome, in contrast to the much narrower,
unimodal distribution of codon usage patterns seen
among Arabidopsis genes. Our analysis of homologous
gene pairs between the two species demonstrates that
these contrasting patterns of codon usage cannot be
explained by simple differences in gene content between
the two genomes. The most parsimonious explanation is
that, since the evolutionary divergence of the monocot
and dicot plants approximately 200 My ago, there has

been a general trend to increase the GC content of the coding sequences within the rice lineage. This increase, however, has occurred in only a subset of the genes. This
heterogeneity in nucleotide content is correlated with a
large difference in codon usage patterns among the rice
genes. A previous study has noted a similar effect of GC
content on codon usage in another monocot, Zea mays
[14], and in the Gramineae in general [15].
This demonstration of a strong correlation between the
nucleotide composition at the third codon positions
(GC3) and codon usage suggests that the variation in
codon usage among genes may be due to a mutational
bias at the DNA level rather than natural selection acting
at the level of mRNA translation. This correlation does
not, by itself, prove that the cause is at the DNA level,
however. Some inferences about the primary causes can
be made by comparing the results seen in rice and Arabidopsis. If the large differences in codon usage among rice

genes were primarily linked to broad functional classes
[26], we would expect to see a parallel pattern among the
Arabidopsis homologs – but this is not the case when we
compare homologous gene pairs between the two species.
Specifically, the Arabidopsis homologs do not fit into these
two classes based on GC content. Moreover, previous
studies have provided evidence that codon bias in Arabidopsis is correlated with gene expression levels rather than
with variations in nucleotide content [27]. These seemingly contradictory results can be reconciled if the patterns
of codon usage in both rice and Arabidopsis are affected
equally by weak translational selection. In the latter case,
the absence of strong mutational bias facilitates the detection of the effects of translational selection [27] but, in the
rice genome, this translational effect is swamped by the
much larger effect of nucleotide bias. This view is consistent with recent findings [7,28] that the relative strength of
translational selection can vary widely among genomes.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7(Suppl 1):S6

The question of translational selection versus mutational
bias can be approached in a number of other ways. For
instance, if codon bias is due to positive selective pressures then we would expect those genes with higher codon
bias to have lower rates of synonymous substitution [29].
Such a negative correlation has been observed in bacteria
[30], Drosophila [31] and yeast [29]. In contrast to these
results, when we compare rice genes with their Arabidopsis
homologs, we find instead that there is a positive correlation between codon bias and the rate of synonymous substitution. Specifically, there is a higher rate of
synonymous substitutions between the High GC rice
genes and their Arabidopsis homologs than between the
Low GC rice genes and their homologs. In order to quantify this relationship between codon bias and divergence
rate, we chose a sample of 895 Arabidopsis genes from
chromosome 4 that had homologs in the rice genome. For
each of the 895 rice homologs, we measured the effective
number of codons (Nc) and calculated the rate of synonymous substitution (dS). We observed a significant negative correlation (R = -0.27, p < 0.00001). Since the value
of Nc is inversely proportional to the level of codon bias,
this means that there is a highly significant positive correlation between codon bias and divergence rate in this case.
This provides further support for the view that the bias is
not due to positive selection for translational efficiency in
this case.
Yet another way to distinguish between the effects of
mutational bias and translational selection is to compare
the nucleotide contents of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites. For instance, if the high GC content at the
third codon position of some rice genes were due to translational selection, we would not expect to see any correlation between synonymous and nonsynonymous sites.
However, in a previous study [17] we did find correlated
patterns of variation in the GC content of non-synonymous sites among rice genes. Finally, the fact that the
highly expressed ribosomal protein genes are distributed
throughout the entire range of GC contents (see Fig. 3)
indicates that the codon bias is not correlated with gene
expression level. In summary, it appears that the codon
usage of the High GC rice genes is determined primarily
by nucleotide bias.
Although we have several lines of evidence that the variations in codon usage are due to the underlying variations
in nucleotide content, we still need to explain why some
rice genes have become extremely GC-rich while others
remain relatively GC-neutral. We found that there is a
strong negative correlation between the length of rice
genes and their nucleotide content. The reasons why
longer genes are more resistant to increases in GC content
remain to be elucidated, but one possibility is that the
longer genes provide a larger mutational target at the

sequence level and that, consequently, they are subject to
more purifying selection that counteracts the mutational
changes that result in the increased GC content in shorter
genes [32]. Another possibility is that the transcription of
AT rich genes is, in general, more efficient than that of GC
rich genes and this efficiency difference would be more
important for longer genes. But if this were the case, we
would expect the same forces to be at work among the
Arabidopsis homologs where we observe the same length
difference, but without the associated difference in GC
content.
In summary, the simple observation of large differences in
codon usage among rice genes might lead us to speculate
on functional differences between genes as a basis for the
variations in codon usage and GC content. The comparison with homologous sequences from Arabidopsis, however, has allowed us to "cross-check" such a prediction
and has lead us instead to the conclusion that most of the
variation in codon usage among rice genes is not due to
positive selection acting on synonymous codon positions.
Rather, it is due to a balance between a directional mutational bias, counterbalanced by negative selection acting
at all nucleotide positions.

Methods
Coding sequence data
14005 rice coding sequences that are longer than 75
codons were obtained from Gramene database [16] and
the EMBL as previously described [17]. For the A. thaliana
coding sequences we used the file containing 25,625 Arabidopsis coding sequences (all greater than 75 codons) that
we obtained previously [17]. The homologous sequences
from Pinus taeda (Loblolly pine) were extracted, using
BLASTN searches with a cutoff Expect value of 1e-20, from
the dataset of 14,198 P. taeda sequences in the NCBI Unigene database [34].
Identification of homologous sequences and computing
synonymous substitution rates
Homologous pairs between O. sativa and A. thaliana were
identified by performing BLASTP searches [18] of the rice
protein sequences against Arabidopsis sequences with a
cutoff Expect value of 1e-20. When a rice protein has more
than one Arabidopsis protein hit, the pair having the lowest
Expect value was retained. Using this method, we identified 7,160 homologous gene pairs between the two species, of which 895 gene pairs are rice genes homologous
to Arabidopsis chromosome 4 genes. In order to see the
relationship between codon bias and the evolutionary
rate, we used the method of Yang and Nielsen [19] to calculate the synonymous rates for the 895 gene pairs.

Statistical analyses
Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) is the observed
frequency of a codon divided by the frequency expected if
all synonyms for that amino acid were used equally. An
RSCU value close to 1.0 indicates a lack of codon bias. The
RSCU was computed for each gene. The RSCU values were
then analyzed using correspondence analysis (see below).

The effective number of codons (Nc) is a commonly used
measurement to quantify codon usage bias of a gene [20].
The Nc takes a value between 20, when only one synonymous codon is used for each amino acid, and 61, when all
codons are uniformly used. Lower Nc values indicate
stronger bias. Since Nc is constrained by G+C content of
the gene, it is often plotted against GC3s (the frequency of
G+C at the third synonymous codon positions) of the
gene to investigate patterns of codon usage [20].
Correspondence analysis [21], was used to explore the
variation in the 59 RSCU values for each of the 61 sense
codons, other than the unique methionine and tryptophan codons. This multivariate statistical method creates a series of orthogonal axes to identify trends that
explain the data variation, with each subsequent axis
explaining a decreasing amount of the variation. The
method, as implemented in CodonW version 1.4 [2], was
used in this study. Correspondence analysis assigns ordination for each gene and codon on these axes, and the
ordination of the genes and codons can be superimposed.
Since the first two axes capture a larger fraction of the variance of the data than any of the other axes, genes and
codons were plotted on these two axes only.
