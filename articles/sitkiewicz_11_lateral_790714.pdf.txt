Lateral gene transfer of streptococcal ICE element
RD2 (region of difference 2) encoding secreted
proteins

Abstract
Background: The genome of serotype M28 group A Streptococcus (GAS) strain MGAS6180 contains a novel
genetic element named Region of Difference 2 (RD2) that encodes seven putative secreted extracellular proteins.
RD2 is present in all serotype M28 strains and strains of several other GAS serotypes associated with female
urogenital infections. We show here that the GAS RD2 element is present in strain MGAS6180 both as an
integrative chromosomal form and a circular extrachromosomal element. RD2-like regions were identified in
publicly available genome sequences of strains representing three of the five major group B streptococcal
serotypes causing human disease. Ten RD2-encoded proteins have significant similarity to proteins involved in
conjugative transfer of Streptococcus thermophilus integrative chromosomal elements (ICEs).
Results: We transferred RD2 from GAS strain MGAS6180 (serotype M28) to serotype M1 and M4 GAS strains by
filter mating. The copy number of the RD2 element was rapidly and significantly increased following treatment of
strain MGAS6180 with mitomycin C, a DNA damaging agent. Using a PCR-based method, we also identified RD2like regions in multiple group C and G strains of Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp.equisimilis cultured from invasive
human infections.
Conclusions: Taken together, the data indicate that the RD2 element has disseminated by lateral gene transfer to
genetically diverse strains of human-pathogenic streptococci.

Background
We sequenced the genome of a strain (MGAS6180) of
serotype M28 group A Streptococcus [1], a human-specific pathogen that is non-randomly associated with neonatal female urogenital infections [2]. The genome of
strain MGAS6180 has a novel 37-kb element designated
RD2 (Region of Difference 2) [1]. RD2 is one of seven
elements integrated into the chromosome of this strain
(4 phages, 3 ICE and ICE related elements) [1,3]. Subsequently we demonstrated that all serotype M28 strains
studied contained RD2 integrated at the same chromosomal site [1,3]. RD2 encodes seven secreted extracellular proteins that are expressed in human infections. One

of these proteins (M28_Spy1336) is also known as the
R28 protein, and has been previously studied in GAS
and group B Streptococcus (GBS) [4-7]. The R28 protein
has been implicated in virulence based on its ability to
mediate binding of GBS to human vaginal epithelial
cells [6]. Protein M28_Spy1325 was recently studied
extensively and shown to be a member of the antigen I/
II family of proteins originally described in oral streptococcal species. M28_Spy1325 binds to salivary agglutinin, a 340-kDa protein abundantly found in human
saliva. Zhang et al. [8] recently demonstrated that
immunization of mice with recombinant purified
M28_Spy1325 confers protection against invasive infection. Thus, two proteins encoded by RD2 likely contribute to host-pathogen interactions.
Several lines of evidence suggest that RD2 in GAS was
acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). First, the
RD2 element is integrated into a tRNA-threonine gene
and flanked by 16bp imperfect direct repeats ATTC(C/

T)CGGTGGTGGCA [1,3]. The chromosomal location
of RD2 is identical in the majority of RD2-positive
strains suggesting a conserved mode of integration [1].
Second, the G+C content of RD2 (35%) is significantly
lower than the average GAS genome (38%) and contains
different di-nucleotide content and codon usage [1,3].
An RD2-like element also has been identified in the
genome of a serotype M2 GAS strain [3]. The RD2 element in this strain is virtually identical at the nucleotide
level to RD2 present in M28 strains. However, the genome sequence of strain MGAS6180 (M28) and
MGAS10270 (M2) are otherwise quite divergent from
one another. Based on single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNPs), the average SNP difference between genomes is
about 137 per 1 kb (total of 14096 SNPs), while only 8
nucleotide differences are found within 37 kb RD2
region [3,9]. The differences in SNP frequency within
chromosome and RD2 region strongly suggests that the
RD2 element in these strains has had a very different
evolutionary history compared to the core chromosome,
and was acquired via horizontal transfer [3].
The primary goal of the experiments described herein
was to test the hypothesis that the RD2 element was laterally transferable in vitro under laboratory conditions,
and we found that this was the case. Moreover, we identified an RD2-like element in multiple strains of Lancefield group C and G streptococci, indicating that this
genetic element is more phylogenetically widespread
than previously appreciated.

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth

Streptococcal strains of serotypes A, C, and G (Additional File 1, Table S1) were cultured routinely at 37°C
in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 on Trypticase soy agar II
plates containing 5% sheep blood (Becton Dickinson,
Franklin Lakes, NJ) or in liquid Todd Hewitt medium
supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract (THY medium).
Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations:
spectinomycin, 150 μg/ml; erythromycin, 1 μg/ml; and
kżanamycin, 400 μg/ml.
Isolation of total DNA from streptococci

DNA was isolated from cultures grown overnight in
THY medium using a modified phenol-chloroform procedure [10]. Briefly, 5 to 35 ml of overnight THY cultures were pelleted by centrifugation and suspended in
TE, pH 7.5. Bacteria were treated with mutanolysin (500
U/ml) and lysozyme (2 mg/ml) (Sigma Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) with occasional mixing for 1 h at 37°C, followed by 2% wt/vol SDS (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA), and
proteinase K (0.2 mg/ml) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) for 1 h at 37°C. DNA was extracted with phenol:
chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, precipitated with two

volumes of ice-cold ethanol, washed with 70% ice-cold
ethanol, and suspended in TE, pH 8.0 buffer containing
0.2 mg/ml RNase A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
DNA amplification by PCR

Primers used in PCR reactions are listed in Table 1 and
Additional File 2 (Table S2). PCR was used to investigate the presence and organization of the RD2 element
in streptococcal strains. The PCR primers #1-#4 detect
a chromosomal and extrachromosomal circular form,
and tile across the entire RD2. Confirmation of RD2
presence by tailing and detection of genes encoding
extra-chromosomal proteins was performed as described
previously [1,2]
Construction of isogenic mutant strain MGAS6180Δ13251326spcR

Allelic replacement was used to construct an isogenic
mutant strain in which two contiguous genes
(M28_Spy1325 and M28_Spy1326) encoded by RD2
were deleted and replaced by spectinomycin resistance
cassette [11]. Upstream and downstream regions flanking the two-gene segment were cloned in pTOPO plasmid (Invitrogen) with spectinomycin resistance cassette
between them. The gel purified PCR product encompassing both flanks with the spectinomycin cassette was
electroporated into cells of strain MGAS6180 made
competent as described before [12]. The resulting isogenic strain was confirmed to be the correct construct
by PCR analysis, DNA sequencing, and Southern hybridization. Successful inactivation of the Spy1325 and
Spy1326 genes also was confirmed by quantitative realtime PCR and Western immunoblot analysis. Detailed
strain construction is presented as Additional File 3 and
the confirmation of the proper construction as Additional File 4 (Figure S1).
Filter mating

Filter mating procedure was performed according to
modified method described previously [13]. The
MGAS6180Δ1325-1326spcR strain was used as a donor
of the RD2 element in filter mating experiments. Strains
MGAS2221ΔcovRS (M1, kanamycin resistance, RD2neg;
P. Sumby unpublished), and MGAS10750 (M4 serotype,
natural erythromycin resistance, RD2neg; [9]) were used
as recipient strains. Overnight donor and recipient cultures (750 μl of each) were mixed and collected on the
surface of a 0,45 μm pore size sterile nitrocellulose filter
(Millipore). The filter was transferred to the surface of
TSA plate without antibiotics and incubated for 3 h, 6
h, or 16 h. After the incubation, the filter was washed
with sterile PBS and the bacteria collected in the wash
fluid were plated on THY agar plates with appropriate
antibiotics. Randomly selected colonies resistant to both

antibiotics were screened by PCR for the size of emm
gene amplicon that is characteristic for M28 or M4 type
and presence of RD2 region genes.
Induction of genetic elements with mitomycin C and
hydrogen peroxide

Genetic elements were induced by treating bacterial cultures with mitomycin C as described previously [14].
Briefly, 750 ml of pre-warmed THY medium was inoculated with an overnight culture of MGAS 6180 (1:50 dilution) and grown until the OD reached 0.15 (early log
phase). The culture was divided into three aliquots, and
one aliquot was treated with mitomycin C (Sigma, final
concentration 0.2 μg/ml), second with hydrogen peroxide
(final concentration 0,5 mM) and one aliquot was left
untreated as a control sample. The concentration of
mitomycin C and hydrogen peroxide used for induction

of mobile genetic elements was tested for the ability to
induce mobile elements and inhibit growth (Additional
File 3). The concentrations used in the experiment were
sufficient to induce mobile elements in MGAS6180 and
were above the minimal inhibitory concentration (Additional File 5, Figure S2). Samples (35 ml) collected at 1 h,
2 h, and 3 h intervals and after overnight incubation and
were used for total DNA isolation as described above.
Quantitative analysis of changes in gene copy number

Total DNA isolated from control GAS or cells treated
with mitomycin C or hydrogen peroxide was used as a
template in quantitative PCR (Taqman) reactions.
Diluted DNA was amplified in multiplex reactions. The
primers used amplified the chromosomal gene proS
(internal calibrator [15]) and the target test gene of
interest. Gene copy number was presented as the

Sitkiewicz et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:65

difference in amplified copies between control gene proS
and the gene of interest (2 ΔCt ) at each experimental
condition. The increase in copy number between start
(T0, sample collected immediately prior splitting the
cultures and the induction) and time point of interest
(T exp ; e.g. 1 h after the induction) was calculated
according to the equation 2ΔCt TExp/2ΔCt T0.

Results
Comparative analysis of RD2 gene content and
organization in GAS and GBS

Sequences homologous to RD2 were initially reported to
be present in strains of serotype III and V Group B Streptococcus (GBS) [1]. By analyzing the available GBS genomic sequences a number of sequences homologous to
RD2 can be identified (Figure 1) [16,17]. The RD2 region
in GAS is integrated into gene encoding tRNA for threonine, while elements found in GBS genomes carrying
RD2 gene homologs are integrated into gene encoding
tRNA for threonine as in GAS, but also tRNA for lysine
[17]. Interestingly, the organization of RD2 like element
in GBS is strain dependent. In case of strains 515 and
COH1, almost the entire element is organized as in
MGAS6180 with the exception of rib and its regulator
(homologs of M28_Spy1336 and M28_Spy1337), whereas
in other strains only fragments homologous to RD2 are
detected. The regions in S. agalactiae genomes homologous to genes M28_Spy1303- M28_Spy1325 are located
in majority of analyzed GBS strains within single chromosomal location, while genes M28_Spy1326M28_Spy1337 are located in other chromosomal location
or locations (Figure 1 and Additional File 6, Table S3).
RD2 encodes a putative conjugation module

Based on DNA sequence analysis, RD2 does not appear to
encode genes involved in replication as a circular plasmid.

Page 5 of 12

GAS is not considered to be naturally transformable
under standard laboratory growth conditions, suggesting
that other mechanisms must be used to transfer RD2related genes between cells. DNA sequence analysis identified a putative transfer module encoded by RD2 with similarity to the ICESt1 and ICESt3 conjugation modules
present in Streptococcus thermophilus (Figure 2) [18].
Thus, we hypothesized that RD2 uses a conjugation-like
mechanism to transfer from donor to recipient strains. To
test this hypothesis, we performed filter mating using
donor strain MGAS6180Δ1325-1326spcR, which contains
a spectinomycin resistance cassette integrated into the
chromosomal copy of RD2. The recipient strain used was
strain MGAS10750, a type emm4 organism that is naturally resistant to erythromycin. After filter mating of strain
MGAS6180Δ1325-1326spcR and strain MGAS10750 for 3
h, 6 h, and 16 h, we obtained 1, 3, and 202 colonies,
respectively (transfer frequency ~10-6 of transconjugants
per donor cell), which were resistant to both antibiotics
(spectinomycin 150 μg/ml and erythromycin 1 μg/ml).
Eight putative transconjugant colonies were tested for the
presence of the RD2 element and characterized for the
emm gene sequence. In group A Streptococcus, emm gene
is highly polymorphic in sequence and encodes for major
surface protein M that is responsible for GAS serotype.
Amplification of hyper-variable region of emm gene with
primers CDCemm1 and CDCemm2 yields products that
differ in size depending on the M serotype [19]. RD2 positive transconjugants were first screened based on the emm
amplicon size (data not shown), and the amplified product
was sequenced to confirm that transconjugants belong to
M4 serotype, the same as the recipient. Successful transfer
of the RD2 element from the emm28 strain to the emm4
strain was confirmed by PCR tiling across the entire RD2
element (Figure 3). Moreover, based on amplification of
the junction region between RD2 and the chromosome,

the RD2 element in the transconjugate was integrated at
the same locus as in the donor emm28 strain (Figure 3).
Based on analysis of 43 colonies resistant to both spectinomycin and kanamycin, similar results were obtained using
strain serotype M1 strain as the recipient strain
(MGAS2221ΔcovRS, resistant to kanamycin).
RD2 is present in multiple, likely extrachromosomal,
copies in GAS

Many gene transfer processes, including conjugation,
require circular form of the transferred molecule or that
more than one copy of the element exists during at least
one point in the transfer cycle [20-22]. Therefore, we
tested the hypothesis that multiple copies of the RD2 are
present in the bacterial cell. PCR primers were used that
allow detection of a circular form of RD2, and permit
assessment of the orientation of chromosomal integration

of multiple copies of RD2 (Figure 4A). Primers #1 and #4
recognize chromosomal sequences, whereas primers #2
and #3 recognize RD2 element sequences. Depending on
the direction and/or arrangement of multiple copies of
RD2 (i.e., head-to-head, tail-to-tail, head-to-tail), the different primer combinations would yield distinct amplicons.
Based on the genome sequence of strain MGAS6180 [1]
primer pairs #1-#2 and #3-#4 would amplify the junction
region between the chromosome and RD2 on the left and
right flank, respectively (positive control reactions). Using
total DNA isolated from an overnight culture of
MGAS6180 as template, PCR analysis yielded products
amplified with primers #1-#2 and #3-#4, as expected.
However, we also observed that primers #2 and #3 amplified a product, a result suggesting the presence of either
multiple integrated copies of RD2 or a circular form of
RD2 (Figure 4B). Next, we analyzed nine other GAS
strains of multiple M protein serotypes using primers #2#3 to determine if this was a general phenomenon.
Regardless of emm type, all RD2-positive strains yielded
an amplicon with the primer #2-#3 combination whereas
RD2-negative organism did not (Figure 4C). Further, DNA
sequence analysis revealed that all PCR amplicons generated with primers #2-#3 contained the sequence
CGGTGGTGGCA, corresponding to a junction between
the left and right flanking regions of RD2 (Figure 4).
To further investigate the putative presence of multiple extrachromosomal copies of RD2 in GAS cells, we
performed quantitative real time PCR using total DNA
isolated from MGAS6180 strain. Performed analysis
revealed that RD2 is present in 6-9 copies per chromosome (Figure 5B, see below). Also, the amplification of
chromosomal junction (primers #1+#4) suggests that
RD2 can be excised from the site of integration.
Taken together, these results indicate that a circular
form of RD2 is present in strain MGAS6180.

form involved in DNA transfer. DNA damaging factors
as ultraviolet light, hydrogen peroxide, or mitomycin C
can induce mobilization of genetic elements such as
prophages or pathogenic islands as part of a response to
DNA damage or oxidative stress [23]. To test hypothesis
that RD2 was induced/excised by DNA damage and

oxidative stress, we examined induction of RD2 and five
other integrative elements present in the genome of
strain MGAS 6180 by mitomycin C and hydrogen peroxide treatment.
In the absence of mitomycin C, no significant increase
in target gene copy number of any of tested element

occurred, even after overnight incubation (Figure 5B),
and the copy number of the element remained constant.
However, RD2 copy number increased by 1 h, 2 h, 3 h,
and 16 h-post mitomycin C treatment (Figure 5D). Of
note, we also detected increases in the copy number of
genes encoded by several other integrative elements present in the genome of strain MGAS6180. For example,
all three tested prophages were induced. In the most
dramatic case of prophage 6180.2 (encoding SpeK, a
superantigen, and SlaA, a secreted phospholipase A 2
virulence factor) we observed a increase in relative copy
number over 700 times compared with the pre-induction level (Additional File 7, Figure S3). Consistent with
phage induction, mitomycin C treatment resulted in a
rapid decrease in optical density of the culture, presumably corresponding to cell lysis (Figure 5A).
Treatment with hydrogen peroxide did not increase
RD2 copy number (Figure 5C), however we observed
induction of phages such as 6180.1 and 6180.2 (Additional File 7 Figure S3).
An RD2-like element is present in group C and G
Streptococcus strains

Inasmuch as genome sequence information (Figure 1)
and filter-mating data presented herein suggested that
RD2 or an RD2-like element can spread between streptococcal species and multiple serotypes, we tested the

hypothesis that the RD2 element has a phylogenetic distribution broader than GAS and GBS. To test the
hypothesis, we screened 20 group C (GCS) and G
(GGS) streptococci causing human infections by PCR
for the presence of seven RD2 genes encoding putative
extracellular secreted proteins. The primers and conditions we used were based on the sequence of RD2
found in GAS strain MGAS6180, and have been used
previously to study the distribution of RD2 in GAS
strains [1]. Because specific primers were used, this PCR
analysis tests for the presence of genes with high homology to the RD2 element in GAS. The majority of the 20
GCS and GGS strains tested have homologs of RD2 element genes (Table 2A). DNA sequencing of all PCR
products confirmed that the amplified gene fragments
were homologues of RD2 element genes (data not
shown). To test the hypothesis that the amplified genes
were organized in an RD2-like genetic element, we used
PCR primers described previously to tile across the
entire RD2 element found in GAS strains [1]. The
results (Table 2B) show that two GGS strains had an
intact RD2 element, and one GCS strain had large segments of an intact RD2. The analysis also revealed a
similar organization to RD2 in MGAS6180, as amplicons
of the same size were generated (data not shown). Missing products of tiling PCR of GCS encompass homologs
of M28_Spy1325 and M28_Spy1326 (fragments 9-10)

which genes detected in single PCR reactions
(Table 2A). The failure to amplify PCR products corresponding to the junction sites between the chromosome
and RD2 suggests that the element is located in a different chromosomal location than in GAS. However, we
cannot rule out the possibility that DNA sequence
divergence at the primer pairing site was responsible for
the lack of amplification of the target amplicon.

Discussion and Conclusions
Analysis of multiple genomes of GAS shows that about
10% of the genome can be attributed to genetic material
acquired horizontal gene transfer [3]. Multiple mobile
genetic elements as prophages, ICE elements and
ancient pathogenicity islands are part of GAS metagenome [3,24]. Lack of detected natural transformation of

GAS, despite proposed mechanism mediated via
quorum sensing mechanism, [25] stresses the importance of transduction and conjugation processes in
HGT.
Since late 1970s multiple authors were studying plasmid conjugal transfer between various streptococcal species [26-28]. Later, based on sequence analyses and
experimental rationale, horizontal transfer of genes/
regions between GAS and GGS was implied [29-31].
Finally, recent publications report conjugative transfer of
ICE elements in human and animal isolates of GAS,
GBS, GGS, GCS and Streptococcus uberis [32,33].
Our work demonstrates that genetic element RD2
from GAS strain MGAS6180 (serotype M28) can be
horizontally transferred in the laboratory to other GAS
strains by filter mating. The transfer frequency is

Sitkiewicz et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:65
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/65

comparable with inter-species transfer of ICESt3 [34].
However, we cannot exclude that the transfer frequency
was influenced by the inactivation of M28_Spy13251326 genes. The genes encode putative extracellular
proteins and can act as aggregation factors, in particular,
M28_Spy1325 has homology to enterococcal conjugative
plasmid pAM373 aggregation factor [35]. However,
because we used filter mating technique that can at
least partially circumvent the need of aggregation factor
in the conjugation process, the lack of M28_Spy13251326 genes does not have to affect transfer frequency
during filter mating.
Presented study provides experimental support for
the idea that the presence of RD2 in GAS strains of
very diverse phylogenetic backgrounds that have not
shared a recent common ancestor have acquired this
element by lateral gene flow occurring in nature. Our
results also show that RD2-like regions are present in
multiple Lancefield group C and group G strains, additional evidence for horizontal dissemination of RD2 in
natural populations of streptococci. Of note, the detection of an RD2-like element in group B [16], C and G
streptococci (this work) is consistent with early reports
of the production of the R28 antigen in these organisms [5,36].
We believe that RD2 has spread and been maintained in genetically diverse organisms in part because
proteins encoded by this genetic element confer a survival advantage to the recipient organism. RD2
encodes at least seven proteins that are secreted into
the extracellular environment, including several likely
to participate in host-pathogen interactions such as
cell adhesion. It is plausible that at least two of these
proteins confer a survival premium. The best characterized is protein R28 encoded by M28_Spy1336. The
RD2 protein has been shown to promote adhesion of
GAS to human epithelial cells grown in vitro and confer protective immunity in a mouse model of invasive
disease, together providing evidence that the R28 protein is a virulence factor [5,6]. Another RD2 encoded
gene involved in virulence is M28_Spy1325. The protein is a member of the antigen I/II family of adhesions made by oral streptococci. It is made in vivo
during invasive GAS infection, and binds GP340, a
heavily glycosylated protein present in human saliva
[8]. Similar to the R28 protein, immunization with
recombinant purified M28_Spy1325 protect mice from
experimental invasive infection, and the protein is
made during human invasive infections [1,8].
Although far less is known about the other secreted
extracellular proteins made by RD2, serologic analysis
indicates that M28_Spy1306, M28_Spy1326 and
M28_Spy1332 also are made during human invasive
infections [1].

Page 10 of 12

Although our work did not define the exact molecular
mechanism(s) mediating horizontal gene transfer of RD2,
the structure of the element and its transfer by filter mating point toward conjugation as a key process. Parts of
RD2 share substantial homology with ICESt1 [37] and
ICESt3 [38] conjugative elements from S. thermophilus.
ICESt1 and ICESt3 elements have homology in sequence
and organization with conjugative transposon Tn916 from
Enterococcus faecalis [39]. Interestingly, a large intergenic
region between M28_Spy1321 and M28_SpyM28_Spy1322
ORFs contains multiple palindromic sequences and might
function as origin of transfer (oriT) as the equivalent
region of Tn916 has been shown [40] or has been suggested to function as such [18].
We note that the copy number of RD2 increased
rapidly and substantially following treatment of strain
MGAS6180 with mitomycin C, a DNA damaging agent
known to induce the SOS response and stimulate horizontal transfer of ICEs [23,41-43].
Interestingly, Ubeda et al. have reported that other
factors as antibiotic treatment can mediate SOS
response in staphylococci and promote horizontal
dissemination of pathogenicity island-encoded virulence
factor genes [44]. The postulated mechanism of SOSinduced induction and transfer of ICESt1/3 elements
involves autoproteolysis of cI type repressor Arp1
[23,45]. As the RD2 element encodes multiple cI type
repressors [1] it is plausible that the mechanism of RD2
induction is mediated by SOS-induced proteolysis or
autoproteolysis of one of the RD2 cI regulators. The
induction of RD2 was not observed after treatment with
hydrogen peroxide i.e. in the condition of oxidative
stress that is known to induce phages [46-48]. That suggests rather LexA dependent mechanism induced by
DNA damage.
In conclusion, RD2 is a medium host range mobile
element that is shared between multiple unrelated serotypes of GAS and other pathogenic streptococcal species. As a consequence of several extracellular secreted
proteins encoded by RD2, the element may confer a
selective advantage on organisms that acquire this element by horizontal gene transfer.
