Abstract
West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen whose geographic spread and incidence in humans,
horses and birds has increased significantly in recent years. WNV has long been considered a mild pathogen
causing self-limiting outbreaks. This notion has changed as WNV is causing large epidemics with a high impact on
human and animal health. This has been particularly noteworthy since its introduction into North America in 1999.
There, native bird species have been shown to be highly susceptible to WNV infection and disease with high
mortalities. For this reason, the effect of WNV infection in North American bird species has been thoroughly
studied by means of experimental inoculations in controlled trials. To a lesser extent, European wild birds have
been shown to be affected clinically by WNV infection. Yet experimental studies on European wild bird species are
lacking. The red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) is a gallinaceous bird indigenous to the Iberian Peninsula, widely
distributed in South Western Europe. It plays a key role in the Mediterranean ecosystem and constitutes an
economically important game species. As such it is raised intensively in outdoor facilities. In this work, red-legged
partridges were experimentally infected with two recent WNV isolates from the Western Mediterranean area:
Morocco/2003 and Spain/2007. All inoculated birds became viremic and showed clinical disease, with mortality
rates of 70% and 30%, respectively. These results show that Western Mediterranean WNV variants can be
pathogenic for some European bird species, such as the red-legged partridge.
Introduction
West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic arthropod-borne
virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. Its natural cycle involves multiple species of birds
as amplifying hosts and a wide range of mosquitoes as
vectors. Horses and humans are susceptible to WNV disease but generally are not competent amplifying hosts. In
the last fifteen years WNV has expanded its geographic
range dramatically, and is now considered the most widespread arbovirus in the world [1-3]. In parallel, significant
changes have been observed in its epidemiology, virulence and range of host species affected. While originally

WNV was considered a pathogen of little importance,
causing mild disease in humans and horses during sporadic, self-limiting outbreaks; this notion is now changing
as WNV is causing large epidemics with thousands of
human and veterinary cases with associated morbidity
and mortality. Large-scale WNV epidemics have taken
place since its introduction in North America in 1999,
although vaccination of horses has mitigated the effect of
this epizooty in this continent. In Europe, where this disease was disregarded for decades, significant changes
have occurred, with an apparent increase in the number
of outbreaks. Although enhancement of surveillance for
this disease in Europe could in part explain this increase,
nevertheless, newly observed patterns such as the raising
degree of human involvement and an upsurge of pathogenicity for wild birds [4] might mean that the situation

with regard to this disease in Europe is in fact changing.
In particular, wild bird affection has been observed only
recently in a number of cases, caused either by WNV
lineages already circulating in Europe [5-8] or by newly
introduced lineages [5,9].
One of the hallmarks of WNV epidemiology in North
America is that native wild birds are largely affected, in
contrast with the low impact of associated disease in wild
birds in the Old World [3]. It remains unclear whether
this difference is due to the intrinsic pathogenicity of the
different viruses found in each continent, or, alternatively,
to the differing susceptibility of Palearctic vs. Nearctic bird
species to WNV infection. However, while the effects of
WNV infection on North American bird species have
been intensively studied and described in a number of
reports [10-15]), experimental studies on indigenous wild
birds are lacking for European birds and WNV strains.
The red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) is a gallinaceous bird native to the Iberian Peninsula, widely distributed in South Western Europe, and has been introduced
to southern England and the Canary Islands [16]. The
species plays a key role in Spanish Mediterranean ecosystems and together with the European rabbit (Oryctolagus
cuniculus) constitutes a staple prey for a number of
endangered predators, including the Spanish Imperial
eagle (Aquila adalberti) and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus). Also, it is one of the most important small game
species in Central and Southern Spain, where hunting,
apart from agriculture, is the most important source of
income [17]. Due to the decline of natural populations of
this species in most of its distribution range, partridges
are raised intensively in outdoor operations and released
for hunting purposes and for restocking natural populations [18]. The susceptibility of this species to WNV
infection is unknown. However, a recent study reported
an outbreak of clinical disease in North America caused
by WNV infection in Chukar partridges (Alectoris chukar) [19], a species closely related to the red-legged partridge. These data prompted us to investigate the effects
of WNV infection in European red-legged partridges. For
that purpose we selected two Western Mediterranean
strains of WNV: Morocco/2003 and Spain/2007, isolated
in the region corresponding to the natural geographic
range of red-legged partridges. Both strains are highly
related phylogenetically [20]. The present study describes
the course of an experimental infection of red-legged
partridges with the two Western Mediterranean West
Nile virus strains selected. The occurrence of direct contact transmission was also assessed.

Materials and methods
Viruses and virus preparations

The viruses used in this study were WNV Spain/2007
(strain GE-1b/B, GenBank acc. n°: FJ766331) [20] and

Page 2 of 8

WNV Morocco/2003 (strain 04.05, GenBank acc. n°:
AY701413) [21]. These two strains are highly related
phylogenetically, differing in 13 amino acid positions
throughout the complete genome (3433 amino acid residues), one of them located at the NS3249. This site has
been involved in genetic modulation of WNV pathogenicity, using American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos)
as avian model of WNV disease [22]. For preparation of
inocula, WNV Spain/2007 was cultivated in BSR cells
(clone of BHK-21 cell line) and WNV strain Morocco/
2003 was cultivated in Vero cells. Both strains were
titrated by plaque assays in Vero cells as previously
described [23]. Virus titers are given in pfu (plaqueforming units) per mL. WNV Spain/2007 and Morocco/
2003 strains of low passage number (3 and 5 cell culture
passages, respectively) were used for inoculations. Complete nucleotide sequences of both viruses were analyzed
prior to inoculation to ascertain that the viruses inoculated had nucleotide sequences identical to those available in GenBank.
Experimental inoculations in red-legged partridges

Recently hatched red-legged partridge chicks (n = 36)
were obtained from a commercial breeder and raised in
the experimental farm of the Instituto de Investigación
en Recursos Cinegéticos (IREC) until they were six
weeks of age. Prior to the experiment, all individuals
were tested serologically (using a commercially available
competition ELISA as described below) and virologically
(by real-time RT-PCR as described below) to ensure
that exposure to WNV had not occurred. The partridges
were transported to the biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities in the CISA and randomly assigned to experimental
groups, that were housed in wire mesh cages with
absorbent floor that was changed daily. The birds were
provided with a commercial diet for game birds and
water ad libitum throughout the experiment. After five
days for acclimatization, two groups composed of
10 red-legged partridges each were inoculated subcutaneously (104 pfu/individual) with either WNV Spain/
2007 or WNV Morocco/2003 diluted in up to 0.1 mL in
Dulbecco’s Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM) (supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin
and 100 μg/mL streptomycin). All partridges were in
their seventh week of age when they were inoculated. Both
groups were kept in separate cages (120 × 40 × 40 cm).
Two groups of three non-inoculated partridges (contact
groups) were kept in the same cages as inoculated individuals. One additional group of partridges (n = 10) was
sham-inoculated with an equivalent volume of DMEM
and kept in a separate cage, as an environmental control.
The experiment was performed in the CISA BSL-3 animal
facilities, following biosafety, animal welfare and ethical
rules applicable in the EU.

Clinical follow-up and collection of samples

Disease symptoms were observed daily for up to 10 days
post-inoculation (dpi). To follow the viremia course,
blood samples were collected daily during the same period from the cutaneous ulnar vein at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 dpi
in half of the individuals, and at days 2, 4, 6, 8 and
10 dpi in the other half (that is, alternating individuals
in order to reduce animal manipulation and thus reduce
unnecessary stress). A second blood sample (0.1-0.2 mL/
individual) was taken likewise in dry tubes and allowed
to clot at 37°C for 1 h, followed by incubation at 4°C
overnight, in order to obtain serum for antibody detection techniques (ELISA and/or virus-neutralization
tests). Similarly, oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were
taken 1 day before inoculation (i.e., -1) from all individuals, and at 4, 6, 10 and 14 dpi in half of the individuals of each group of inoculated partridges, and 3, 5, 7
and 14 dpi in the other half. Blood samples were collected directly in sterile polypropylene tubes filled with
0.9 mL BA-1 diluent (Hanks M-199 salts, 0.05 M Tris,
pH 7.6, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.35 g/L of sodium
bicarbonate, 100 units/mL of penicillin, 100 μg/mL of
streptomycin, 1 μg/mL of amphotericin B) and stored at
-70°C until analysis. Swab samples were placed in sterile
polypropylene tubes filled with 1 mL of Hank’s balanced
solution containing 10% glycerol, 200 U/mL penicillin,
200 μg/mL strepctomycin, 100 U/mL polymixin B sulphate, 250 μg/mL gentamicin and 50 U/mL nystatin and
also stored at -70°C until analysis. Contact partridges
were sampled (both for blood and cloacal/oropharyngeal
swab) at days -1, 6, and 10 dpi. Following death, partridges were collected and necropsied within < 18 h.
Two individuals of each contact group were euthanized
humanely by intravenous injection of embutramide (T61 ®,
Intervet - Schering-Plough, Madrid, Spain) on day
10 dpi and submitted for full necropsy. During
necropsy, care was taken to avoid cross-contamination
of tissues by use of single use scalpels and forceps.
After the 10 day period, additional serum samples for
the detection of specific antibodies against WNV in
surviving partridges were collected on 12, 14, and
20 dpi, in inoculation, contact and control groups.
Viremia and WNV genome detection assays

Viremia was measured in blood (collected in BA-1 diluent) by standard plaque-formation assays as described
[23] while viral genome load was measured in blood
(collected in BA-1 diluent) by semiquantitative real-time
RT-PCR, using a previously described method [24] with
slight modifications, using an internal control. Briefly,
nucleic acids were extracted from BA-1-diluted blood
samples (0.1 mL) using Biosprint-15 automated extraction (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA), and 4 μL (4% of

Page 3 of 8

total eluate) of each extract, in 25 μL final volume, was
subjected to real-time RT-PCR amplification using the
QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN) and following
manufacturer’s instructions. The mix included primers
(WNV-LCV-F1: 5’-GTGATCCATGTAAGCCCTCAGAA-3’ and WNV-LCV-R1: 5’-GTCTGACATTGGGC
TTTGAAGTTA-3’) at 0.4 μM final concentration, and a
FAM-labelled TaqMan-MGB probe (WN-LCV-S1:
5’FAM-AGGACCCCACATGTT-3’-MGB) at 0.25 μM
final concentration, specific for detection of lineage
1 WNV, as well as primers (ACT F 1005-1029: 5’-CAGCACAATGAAGATCAAGATCATC-3’, and ACT R
1135-1114: 5’-CG GACTCATCGTACTCCTG CTT-3’)
and JOE-labelled TaqMan probe (ACT P 1081-1105:
5’JOE-TCGCTGTCCACCTTCCAGCAGATGT-BBQ)
for detection of an internal control (b-actin) as
described [25] in order to control for the presence and
integrity of RNA isolated from each preparation. Amplification conditions consisted of a first reverse-transcription step at 50°C for 30 min, followed by 15 min at
95°C (“hot start”) and 45 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 1
min at 60°C. Tissues, oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs
were examined for the presence of viral genome using
the same RNA extraction method and real-time RTPCR described above, but following a preparation step
consisting of homogenization for 2 min at 30 cycles/s in
90% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using a Tissuelyser
homogenizer, QIAGEN, followed by clarification at 850
× g 10 min. in the case of tissues, and elution for 3 h at
4°C in 1 mL BA-1 diluent (see above), followed by clarification at 9500 × g 5 min, in the case of oropharyngeal
and cloacal swabs.
Antibody detection assays

Serum antibodies to WNV were detected by a commercially available competition ELISA suitable for measurement of antibodies to WNV in serum of wild birds
following manufacturer’s instructions (ID Screen ©
West Nile Competition, IdVet, Montpellier, France).
Virus-neutralizing antibody titers were measured by a
micro-virus neutralization test as described [26]. Positive
neutralization was considered for each inoculated well
when complete absence of CPE was observed in the cell
monolayer.
Statistical analysis

Comparison of survival rates between groups of partridges inoculated with Morocco/2003 and Spain/2007
WNV strains was carried out by using the GehanBreslow-Wilcoxon method [27]. Viremia and genome
load data between groups of partridges inoculated with
Morocco/2003 and Spain/2007 WNV strains were
compared using Student’s t test for independent groups.

Results
Both WNV strains assayed were pathogenic for redlegged partridges. All inoculated partridges showed clinical signs (e.g. loss of appetite, ruffled feathers, paralysis,
and unresponsiveness), yet those infected with
Morocco/2003 were more severely affected than those
infected with Spain/2007. Firstly, the onset of symptoms
began one day earlier (4 vs. 5 dpi) in partridges inoculated with Morocco/2003 than in those inoculated with
Spain/2007. Secondly, mortality was higher (70% vs.
30%) and started earlier (5 vs. 6 dpi) with Morocco/
2003 than with Spain/2007 (Figure 1). The differences
observed in survival rates over time between both
groups of inoculated partridges were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Clinical signs and mortality ceased by
9 dpi in both inoculated groups. Viral genome was
detectable from 1 to 7 dpi (Figure 2a) in both inoculations. Viremia was detectable between 1 and 6 dpi for
Spain/2007 and slightly longer (up to 7 dpi) for
Morocco/2003. Peak viremia titers, and peak viral genome
loads were found at 3 dpi for both isolates. Mean peak viremia was higher after inoculation with Morocco/2003
(10 7.2 pfu/mL) than with Spain/2007 (10 6.9 pfu/mL)
(Figure 2b), similarly to what occurred with viral genome
loads (Figure 2a) although in both cases the differences
between both groups were not statistically significant
(p > 0.05). All surviving partridges developed WNVneutralizing antibodies (NtAb) (Figure 3), which were
observed at 10 dpi or later. In inoculated partridges, specific antibodies to WNV as revealed by competitive ELISA
were observed slightly earlier (6 dpi) than NtAb (Figure 3).
Oral and cloacal virus shedding was observed between
3 and 7 dpi for both viruses. Virus shedding was more consistently found in oropharyngeal than in cloacal swabs for
both strains, particularly in early stages (3 dpi, Figure 4).

* Contact (non-inoculated cage-mate) controls gave negative results upon
necropsy at 10 dpi in all tissues analyzed by real-time RT-PCR.

strain (black bars) or WNV Morocco/2003 strain (white bars).
Error bars represent standard deviation of the means. Over the bars,
numbers of positive/examined swab samples are indicated.

Post-mortem examination of lethally infected partridges
revealed systemic infection, as the virus was detected in
the brain, heart, spleen and liver by means of real time
RT-PCR (Table 1). Upon necropsy, infected partridges
were in poor body condition. Gross lesions were similar in
both WNV-inoculated groups, and were characterized
mainly by ascites, diffuse pallor of the myocardium,
enlarged liver and petechia on the renal surface, injected
blood vessels in the intestinal tract, and, in three birds,
congestion of superficial cerebral vessels.
The virus was not detectable in blood of noninoculated contact partridges during the whole course of
the experiment, and, furthermore, these partridges did
not seroconvert, as assessed either by competition
ELISA or by virus-neutralization test (data not shown),
further supporting the absence of infection. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs from these contact partridges
also remained negative until they were euthanized for
tissue examination. Brain, heart, spleen and liver samples examined from these birds resulted negative for
WNV genome by real-time RT-PCR at 10 dpi (Table 1).

Discussion
The results of this work demonstrated that the
red-legged partridge is susceptible to WNV disease, and
provides further evidence that some European wild bird
species can be clinically affected by WNV. This concept
is supported by recent reports describing field WNV
cases in different wild bird species in Europe. While previous work reported three types of European eagles
(golden eagle -Aquila chrysaetos-, Spanish imperial eagle
-Aquila adalberti- and Bonnelli’s eagle -Hieraaetus
fasciatus-) clinically affected by WNV in Spain [6,7], the
disease was also described in goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), sparrow hawks (Accipiter nisus) and geese (Anser
anser) in Hungary [5], sparrow hawks in Austria [9], and
house sparrows (Passer domesticus) and magpies (Pica
pica) in the Camargue region of France [8]. Just prior to
the arrival of WNV to North America in 1999, migrating
storks and domestic geese were adversely affected by
WNV infection in Israel [28]. Subsequent experimental
studies on domestic geese conducted in Israel confirmed
their susceptibility to WNV disease [29]. Nevertheless, to
our knowledge, the present study is the first reporting an
experimental infection with WNV in a European wild
bird showing symptoms of disease.
In addition, our results demonstrate experimentally
that at least some Euro-Mediterranean WNV strains are
pathogenic in an indigenous wild bird species. Previous
results showed that one of the strains used in this
experiment (Morocco/2003) was as pathogenic for mice
as the NY99 prototype strain [20]. Thus, the apparently
limited wild bird morbidity caused by WNV in Europe,
as compared to the high virulence for WNV in wild

Sotelo et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:11
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/11

birds in North America, demands an explanation
accounting for the fact, reflected in this work, that at
least some Euro-Mediterranean WNV strains are highly
pathogenic for certain indigenous wild birds such as the
red-legged partridge. In the European context the apparently mild consequences of WNV disease for wild birds
would likely arise from the difficulties inherent to the
surveillance of mortality events in the affected wild bird
species rather than from low pathogenicity of local
WNV strains, or from low susceptibility of indigenous
wild birds.
In this work, contact partridges did not show disease
symptoms, and remained negative both for virus detection in blood and/or tissues, as well as for WNV-specific
antibodies. Thus, direct WNV transmission did not
occur in the experimental conditions used in this assay,
despite close interaction between inoculated and noninoculated partridges. While contact transmission has
been demonstrated for certain avian species [29], evidence of this is lacking for other wild bird species. For
instance, in an exhaustive study evaluating WNV transmission dynamics in 25 different avian species, contact
(cage-mate) transmission was observed in only four species (Blue Jays, Black-billed Magpies, American Crows
and Ring-billed Gulls). Interestingly, contact transmission was not observed in the two species of Galliformes
evaluated (Japanese Quail and Northern Bobwhite) [10].
In a different study addressing long-term immunity in
House Sparrows as important amplifying hosts for
WNV, contact transmission was not observed in this
species [14]. Viral shedding by the oral and faecal routes
occurred in all the inoculated partridges monitored, so
the absence of contact transmission in this model needs
further investigation, in particular if this finding is attributable to the avian model, or to the viral isolates used.
New animal models of WNV infection are of interest
not only for virulence studies but also for antiviral and
vaccine development [30]. This work demonstrates that
the red-legged partridge constitutes a suitable avian
model of WNV infection, since this bird species is not
only susceptible to infection and disease but is also easy
to obtain, can be raised in captivity, and is relatively easy
to handle. In addition, our data demonstrate that the redlegged partridge could act as amplifying host for WNV,
as shown by the maximum viremia levels attained during
the experiment (approximately 10 7.0 pfu/mL blood),
clearly above the established threshold level of infectious
viremia, estimated at 105.0 pfu/mL of blood [10].
The red-legged partridge is indigenous to the Mediterranean region, where it constitutes a key prey species for
many predators. Those predators feeding on infected
partridges or carrion eaters feeding on their carcasses
could be at risk of infection since non-vectored transmission of WNV through ingested infected food has

Page 6 of 8

been documented [10,31,32]. In Spain, some endangered
species such as the Golden eagle, the Bonnelli’s eagle
and the Spanish Imperial eagle prey regularly on redlegged partridges and have been shown to be susceptible
to WNV-associated disease [6,7]. Thus the occurrence
of WNV outbreaks in red-legged partridges could
potentially constitute a risk for the conservation of these
endangered species.
The red-legged partridge also represents an important
small game species being intensively raised in open air
facilities and released into the wild for restocking and
hunting purposes. The species also exists in the South of
the UK and the Canary Islands, where there is concern
about the introduction and spread of WNV. A closely
related partridge species (Chukar partridge) is also susceptible to WNV-associated disease in North America, where
farms raising these wild birds have suffered outbreaks of
the disease [19]. Besides their economic importance, partridge farms could play a relevant role for public health
since in case of a hypothetical WNV outbreak, and provided the presence of suitable mosquito species with a
broad host spectrum, farmed red-legged partridges could
potentially act as the reservoir for accidental transmission
of WNV into humans and horses. Suitable mosquito vectors as Culex pipiens are abundant in the red-legged partridges’ natural habitat as well as in the farms
(unpublished observation). Thus, in surveillance programs,
WNV disease should be considered as a potential hazard
for farms producing red-legged partridges. This is of particular importance bearing in mind that eventually these
captive-raised partridges are to be released into the wild.
In the experimental work described here, the viral
strains (Morocco/2003, and Spain/2007) used to inoculate differed in 13 out of 3433 amino acid residues
(99.62% amino acid identity), one of them being NS3249.
This site appears to play a role in the genetic modulation of pathogenicity for wild birds, as substitution of
threonine (T) by proline (P) in a moderately pathogenic
WNV strain (Ken98) resulted in an increase in virulence
for American crows, whereas, the opposite change
(P249T) resulted in a decrease in virulence for the
highly pathogenic NY99 strain in the same hosts [22].
This site is occupied by T in Morocco/2003, and by
P in Spain/2007. We showed recently in a mouse model
that Morocco/2003 is more pathogenic than Spain/2007
[20]. Here we confirm and extend this observation to a
wild bird species. This suggests that a proline residue in
position 249 of the NS3 protein is not sufficient to
enhance virulence for any given WNV strain. Possibly,
other residues that differ between both strains are also
playing a role in the observed pathogenicity, and could
have produced apparent discrepancies with previous studies using infectious clones in American crows [22,33].
The NS3 249 -P genotype has arisen recently in the

Sotelo et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:11
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/11

Western Mediterranean region. This WNV genotype has
been involved in recent outbreaks in northeastern Italy
[34], in which WNV strains have been similar to those
used in the present study [20]. An assessment of the
pathogenicity of these recent Italian isolates would provide further insight into the epidemiology of the NS3249
genotype in the Western Mediterranean area.
The pathogenicity of the Spanish WNV isolate was
less than that of another Western Mediterranean strain,
i.e., Morocco/2003, not only in a mouse model, but also
in the red-legged partridge. This finding could explain
why this disease has remained essentially silent in Spain
to date, and provide a possible mechanism accounting
for the occurrence of sporadic WNV outbreaks interspersed by silent WNV circulation in some regions such
as the Western Mediterranean. Small genetic changes in
the virus genome (T249P at NS3, or others), could substantially reduce the pathogenicity of circulating viruses,
and vice-versa. However, other factors not linked to the
virus, but to host susceptibility and vectors, could also
contribute to this epidemiological pattern, the relative
importance of which merits further investigations.
