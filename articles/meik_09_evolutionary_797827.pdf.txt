Abstract
Background: The rattlesnake rattling system is an evolutionary novelty that includes anatomical,
behavioral, and physiological modifications of the generalized pitviper tail. One such modification,
the formation of a bony clublike style at the terminal region of the caudal vertebrae, has not
previously been examined in a phylogenetic context. Here we used skeletal material, cleared and
stained preparations, and radiographs of whole preserved specimens to examine interspecific
variation in style morphology among 34 rattlesnake species.
Results: Evolutionary Principal Components Analysis revealed an inverse relationship between
caudal segmental counts and style size, supporting the hypothesis that bone from caudal vertebral
elements was reallocated to style formation during the evolution of this structure. Most of the basal
rattlesnake species have small styles consisting of few compacted vertebral elements; however,
early in the rattlesnake radiation there appears to have been two independent transitions to
relatively large, pronged styles consisting of multiple coalesced vertebrae (once in Sistrurus
catenatus, and once in Crotalus following the divergence of the Mexican long-tailed rattlesnakes). In
terms of style shape, the two most divergent species, C. catalinensis and C. ericsmithi, provide insight
into the possible relationship between style and rattle matrix morphology and lineage-specific
evolutionary strategies for retaining rattle segments.
Conclusion: The considerable interspecific variation in rattle morphology appears to correspond
to variation in the bony style. We hypothesize that style morphology evolves indirectly as an
integrated module responding to adaptive evolution on matrix morphology.

Background
The rattlesnake rattle is a complex aposematic sound-producing structure, composed of keratinous, multilobed,
interlocking segments that is presumed to have evolved
once [1,2] and as an integrated anatomical, physiological,
and behavioral system is a key innovation uniting a
diverse radiation of venomous New World pitvipers (genera Crotalus and Sistrurus). Aside from early embryonic
and ontogenetic descriptions [e.g., [3-6]] very little is
known of the development of the rattle system. Most

recent studies have focused on physiological and auditory
elements of the rattle [e.g., [7-9]]; the genetic basis of morphological development remains unknown. The site of
actual rattle segment formation is the end-body, the living
basal rattle segment that includes the style, the matrix
(i.e., fibrous connective tissue that forms the rattle segment mold), and epithelial tissues. Although the term
'matrix' has often been used in reference to the entire
structure that secretes the rattle producing keratins [10],
we herein use 'matrix' in reference to the soft tissues of this

structure, and 'style' in reference to the fused caudal vertebrae embedded within the matrix. Rattle segment formation is tied to pulses of matrix tissue growth and
resorption during the ecdysis cycle, and ontogenetic
changes in size and morphology of the matrix influence
rattle morphology. Considerable interspecific variation
exists in the overall size and form of the rattle; some rattlesnake species have tiny, scarcely audible rattles, while
others have proportionately large, loud rattles [10,11].
This variation likely involves other system components as
well and these integrated elements may collectively provide an ideal opportunity to study the evolution of a structural novelty in a vertebrate taxon.
Here we evaluate morphology and evolution of an anatomical component of the rattlesnake rattle system, the
bony clublike style, or shaker, at the terminus of the caudal vertebrae. The rattle style is comprised of a combination of fused and modified caudal vertebrae and further
exostosis of bone [6,10]. It provides a point of insertion
for the powerful tailshaker muscles [6], and presumably
provides stability for the motion-dynamic rattle [12], as
well as potentially influences the morphology of the endbody. In general structure, the style of an adult rattlesnake
is vaguely arrowhead-shaped, with proximal notches, and
two distally projecting prongs that extend into the distal
lobe of the matrix. Observations of style development
suggest that the style includes the coalescence of 8–12 of
the terminal vertebrae [6]; however, the precise number is
difficult to determine due to the fusion of vertebrae and
accretion of extravertebral osseous tissue. Studies of
matrix morphology in insular populations of rattlesnakes
that have undergone vestigilization of the rattle suggest
that morphology of the grooves and lobes of the external
matrix surface is vital for the retention of interlocking,
sound-producing segments in adult rattlesnakes [13]; thus
the relationship between matrix and style morphology
may provide insight into the evolution and morphological integration of rattle system components.
Zimmerman and Pope [6] documented differences in timing and degree of development of the style between Crotalus atrox, C. adamanteus, and Sistrurus catenatus,
providing evidence that heterochronic changes in strength
and modulation of genetic pathways involved in style formation may be linked to evolutionary changes in the rattlesnake rattle. Furthermore, style formation appears to
occur late in prenatal development, as well as postnatally,
and the structure likely continues to accrue osseous tissue
into adulthood [6]. Klauber [10], in reference to interspecific differences previously noted by Zimmerman and
Pope [6], suggested that the style might be a potentially
informative character in deciphering rattlesnake relationships. Although he did not present detailed data,
Brattstrom [14], in his landmark study of pitviper osteol-

ogy, did not find consistent differences or similarities
among species of rattlesnakes. Recently, Savitzky and
Moon [12] examined vertebral variation along the length
of the rattlesnake tail in C. atrox and related it to functioning of the various shaker muscles in maintaining structural stability during high frequency contractions. The
gross morphology of the rattlesnake style has been
described elsewhere [e.g., [4,6]]; our purpose is to explore
general transformations and interspecific variation in
morphology of the style in a phylogenetic context.

Methods
We obtained digital radiographs from 34 species of rattlesnakes (1–9 specimens per species) using ethanol-preserved adult specimens (specimens examined are listed in
Additional file 1, following abbreviations as in Leviton et
al [15]). The vast majority of species from all major groups
of rattlesnakes were sampled. Our sampling also included
all three species of apparently rare long-tailed rattlesnakes
from western Mexico (Crotalus stejnegeri, C. lannomi, and
C. ericsmithi), which are collectively known from fewer
than fifteen specimens. We imported radiographs into
ImageJ 1.34s [16] and obtained eight linear measurements for each style (to nearest 0.01 mm). As homologous landmarks were ambiguous, we selected
standardized measurements that were reproducible for
most species (Fig. 1). A few species (e.g., Sistrurus miliarius,
C. stejnegeri, etc.) did not exhibit certain typical style features (such as distal prongs, etc.); when such features were
not present, we considered the measurement to be negligible (0.01 mm) for analytical purposes. In addition to
style measurements, we collected data on snout-vent
length (SVL), tail length, height and width of the exposed
end-body lobe (i.e., basal rattle segment), and subcaudal
scale counts. For quantitative analysis (see below), we
included data only from specimens from which radiographs were obtained; however, we augmented our qualitative comparisons of style morphology by examining
skeletal preparations. To clarify style structure in a basal
rattlesnake, we also cleared and stained the tail of a large
adult S. miliarius following the procedure in Cohn and
Tickle [17]. The radiographs from this species did not
show the typical arrowhead form of the style, but rather
appeared to consist of few close-set, vertebral elements
that were only slightly enlarged in the dorsal-ventral axis.
We examined interspecific variation in style morphology
using Evolutionary Principal Components Analysis
(EPCA). In cross-species comparisons, EPCA has an
advantage over standard PCA in that EPCA extracts axes
that maximize evolutionary change rather than ordinating
static variation. In this variant of PCA, ancestral states are
first reconstructed using squared-change parsimony and
then eigenanalysis is performed on vectors of evolutionary change along each branch [18]. Thus, by incorporating

phylogenetic information, EPCA is potentially able to
reduce non-independence of cross-species data sets due to
similarity through common descent. Prior to inclusion in
EPCA, we log10-transformed all linear measurements and
then regressed these variables against log10-transformed
SVL and included the size-adjusted residuals in the analysis. We omitted SVL from the analysis and standardized all
remaining variables (i.e., performed eigenanalysis on data
extracted from the correlation matrix). Because tail length

and subcaudal scale count are strongly influenced by sexual dimorphism we included only males in the EPCA
(males were selected because they outnumber females in
natural history collections, and thus we had more species
represented by only males than by only females).
We assembled a composite phylogeny for the taxa
included in the EPCA using published studies of rattlesnake systematics [19-22] (Fig. 2), and set branch lengths
equal to one. When nodal support was high (Pp > 0.95)
we used the topology of Castoe and Parkinson [20] from
their mixed model Bayesian analysis as the main basis for
branching relationships; otherwise we used the preferred
topology of Murphy et al. [19] as inferred using maximum
parsimony. For our analysis we included the Mexican
long-tailed rattlesnakes as the first clade diverging from
within Crotalus [10,14,23-25], but recognize that these
species, as well as C. polystictus and C. cerastes, remain
incertae sedis. For purposes of visualization and discussion, we placed rattlesnakes into five groups based on our
phylogenetic estimate (Fig. 2). We performed EPCA using
the Rhetenor module [18] of Mesquite [26].
In addition to EPCA of radiograph measurements, we collated data on maximal ventral scale counts and maximal
subcaudal scale counts (segmental counts) for males of all
New World pitvipers, including rattlesnakes, to examine
the association of dorsal (precloacal) and caudal vertebrae
among species (data from [27]). There is a general 1:1 correlation between segmental scale counts and vertebral elements in snakes [28,29], and we confirmed this
relationship for caudal vertebrae and subcaudal counts in
rattlesnakes using radiograph data from selected individuals (excluding vertebrae coalesced into the style). Our
objective was to examine the extent of separation (if any)
between rattlesnakes and other species of New World pitvipers in the bivariate morphospace between dorsal and
caudal vertebrae. Assuming that terminal vertebral elements in a generalized pitviper tail were reallocated to
style formation after somitogenesis, providing a structural
mechanism for the shortening of the rattlesnake tail and
integration of the tail and rattle, the distribution of rattlesnake species in morphospace may inform whether certain aspects of style morphology preceded the coalescence
of multiple vertebral elements into the style.

Results
We interpreted the first two component axes extracted
from the EPCA, which accounted for 75.5% and 10.4% of
the total variation in the dataset, respectively. The first axis
was structured primarily by the inverse relationship
between style size and relative tail length/subcaudal scale
count, with all eight style measurements loading positively on this axis (Table 1). This pattern likely reflects the
general incorporation of additional caudal vertebral ele-

ments during the evolutionary increase in style size. The
second EPCA axis reflected interspecific differences in
style morphology, with style measurements pertaining to
the distal third to half of the style contributing greater to

variation in this axis (style measurements 5, 6, and 7
loaded negligibly on this axis). Style measurements 1, 2,
and 8 were positively associated with EPC Axis 2, while
style measurements 3 and 4 were negatively associated

with this axis (Table 1). Thus we interpret the main spectrum of interspecific differences in style shape to reflect a
continuum from relatively longer styles with deeper
prongs, wider gaps between prongs (i.e., greater angle),
more attenuated prongs, and greater constriction (or
notching) near the juncture with the prongs and the anterior body of the style, to relatively shorter styles with shallow, but broad, prongs (or, in the extreme condition,
prongs absent), and less constriction at the juncture of the
prongs and the anterior style body (see Fig. 1).

sally, respectively. Crotalus catalinensis, which does not
usually retain rattle segments in life, has a blunt, triangular-shaped style without distinctive prongs or mid-style
notching (Fig. 1). From radiographs, it appeared that Sistrurus miliarius, C. lannomi, and C. stejnegeri have similar
tiny, amorphous styles. We further examined this apparent condition using a cleared and stained tail preparation
of a large adult S. miliarius (Fig. 4). The preparation
revealed the coalescence of relatively few (approximately
2–4) terminal vertebrae and the absence of prongs or distinct mid-style notching. The style of S. miliarius did
exhibit similar bone porosity, texture, and structure to
styles of more derived rattlesnake species as well as the
degeneration of precise vertebral morphology (e.g., an
absence of distinctive patterning or regularly repeated vertebral elements such as spines or processes). In contrast to
its congener, S. catenatus has a relatively large, pronged
style.
There is a general evolutionary association between the
number of precloacal and caudal vertebrae in snakes;
however, there are various instances across the phylogenetic diversity of this group where this pattern is contradicted [30]. In New World pitvipers, there is a positive
relationship between number of precloacal and caudal

vertebrae; however, rattlesnakes are notably distinct in
that with few exceptions they appear to possess relatively
fewer caudal vertebrae than expected when compared to
number of precloacal vertebrae (Fig. 5). Assuming that
this dissociation is based on fusion of vertebrae and does
not reflect an actual reduction in caudal vertebrae, the pattern further suggests the possibility that proportionately
more vertebral elements are coalesced into the style in rattlesnake species with higher precloacal vertebral counts.
This may be related to the observation that larger rattlesnake species tend to have correspondingly larger rattles.
Three species (Sistrurus miliarius, Crotalus ericsmithi, and C.
stejnegeri), which likely represent very early branching
events within rattlesnakes, did not deviate from the generalized pitviper pattern of positive association between
precloacal and caudal vertebrae counts.

Discussion
Inferences regarding the evolution of the rattlesnake style
necessarily require a robust hypothesis of rattlesnake relationships. Unfortunately, the rattlesnake phylogeny
remains somewhat poorly resolved, despite initial analyses based on mitochondrial DNA sequence data [19,20].
Of particular interest are the three enigmatic long-tailed
rattlesnake species from the Pacific versant of Mexico.
These species are collectively known from fewer than fifteen specimens and have yet to be included in a formal
phylogenetic analysis. The long-tailed rattlesnakes have
generally been considered to represent an early divergence
within Crotalus on the basis of putatively primitive character states, and they share additional color pattern and
scalation features that may be found to be synapamorphic. Campbell and Flores-Villela [25] recognized that tail
length and rattle size were not independent characters and
further suggested that the proportionately long tail in
these species may represent a plesiomorphic trait, and
thus would be of no utility in resolving relationships
based on parsimony. Although we agree with these
authors regarding tail length in the general context of
snake evolution, the phylogenetic position of rattlesnakes
as nested within New World pitvipers, which are longtailed when compared to rattlesnakes, suggests that the
relatively shorter tail of rattlesnakes may be a secondarily
derived condition.
Our study provides further insight into the question of
whether the long-tailed condition is ancestral in rattlesnakes. Assuming subcaudal counts are a reasonable surrogate for tail length [29], the majority of rattlesnake
species have considerably shorter tails than other New
World pitvipers (Fig. 5). The process of tail shortening in
rattlesnakes is likely a function of the relative contribution
of caudal vertebral elements fused into the bony style (as
opposed to evolutionary decrease in number of caudal
segments); thus tail length is inversely related to rattle

size. Since vertebral fusion comprises part of the rattle system, which is inarguably derived in rattlesnakes, the shorttailed condition is also derived in this group. However, we
recognize that we cannot extend this argument to deciphering relationships within rattlesnakes, as reversals
towards the longer-tailed condition are possible.
Combined evidence from EPCA and segmental regional
association suggest a possible sequence of morphological
transitions during style evolution. Largest magnitude differences in style morphology among rattlesnake species
were in size-corrected measurements from the distal half
of the style, which likely correspond to aspects of matrix
morphology. Size-corrected measurements from the proximal half of the style (including style width in the transverse plane) were conserved across species, perhaps
reflecting a general lack of evolutionary variation in
tailshaker muscle attachment sites. The style of Sistrurus

miliarius, a basal rattlesnake species, is notable in that it
comprises very few caudal vertebral elements, and lacks
mid-style notching and distal prongs (Fig. 4). The style
does show foramina and minimal proximal flaring; but
otherwise consists of vertebrae that lack precise patterning
in the form of processes and spines. This reduced style
morphology is shared with C. stejengeri and C. lannomi.
Crotalus ericsmithi is similar in that very few vertebral elements comprise the style; however, this species is distinctive in having tiny distal prongs that form a broad angle.
The substantial overlap around axis means in ordination
space of the C. triseriatus Group, C. intermedius Group, C.
cerastes, C. polystictus, and the derived species implies that
the derived morphology of large, globose, pronged styles
comprised of multiple caudal vertebrae evolved relatively
early in the rattlesnake radiation, and we propose that variation around this mean represents evolutionary refinements of the optimized style morphology. The most

parsimonious scenario based on our phylogenetic placement of the Mexican long-tailed rattlesnakes as the earliest
divergence within Crotalus, and the positive association of
precloacal and caudal vertebrae in the nearest pitviper
outgroups, suggests parallel evolution of the derived style
morphology in S. catenatus, which also possesses a correspondingly large rattle when compared to S. miliarius.
Intriguingly, in the evolutionary history of rattlesnakes
there appears to have been a contemporaneous apparent
dissociation in the number of precloacal and caudal vertebrae (Fig. 5), which we interpret as an increase in the
number of vertebral elements incorporated into the style,
and an optimized refinement in style morphology
towards the morphospace cloud occupied by the vast
majority of extant species (Fig. 3). Assuming our phylogenetic estimate is correct regarding the placement of the
Mexican long-tailed rattlesnakes, this event happened
subsequent to both the divergence of Sistrurus and the
basal split within Crotalus. Based on the pattern of species
ordination, we suggest that the ability to retain functional
rattle segments is correlated with both the size and morphology of the style (and by extension the rattle matrix).
Crotalus ericsmithi, which presumably diverged along with
the remaining long-tailed rattlesnakes before the rapid
increase in vertebral element incorporation into the style,
has an exceptionally diminutive rattle string. We hypothesize that the divergent style morphology in this species
represents an alternative evolutionary path towards rattle
segment retention that led to the adjustment of morphology of the prongs rather than an increase in rattle size.
Within the derived rattlesnake group, Crotalus catalinensis
has the most divergent style. This is notable in that C. catalinensis is also the only species examined that has evolutionarily lost the retention of interlocking rattle segments.
The style of this species is reduced and blunt, and does not
have distinctive distal prongs (Fig. 1). In comparisons of
various populations of insular rattleless populations and
their mainland derivatives, Rabatsky [13] found consistent differences in the morphology of the end-body matrix
associated with the loss of rattle strings. Our results support the idea that morphological vestigilization extends to
the bony style as well.
Although it is evident that style morphology is associated
with rattle, and more specifically rattle matrix morphology, we are currently unable to distinguish between
potential scenarios regarding the evolutionary integration
of these two components. It is possible that selection acts
disproportionately on matrix morphology to retain rattle
segments, and that style morphology evolves through
pleiotropic effects of gene regulatory programs involved
in the secretion of keratin, patterning, or growth and
resorption of the surrounding matrix tissues. In contrast,
the style may have been the target of stronger selective

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/35

forces as the style provides an anatomical link between the
rattle-forming matrix tissues and the tailshaker muscles
that drive the high-frequency oscillations of the rattle.
Alternatively, style and matrix may evolve independently
under differing selective regimes.
Without additional data we favor the hypothesis that
matrix morphology (as opposed to style morphology) is a
direct target of selection for the following reasons: (1)
although independent evolution and subsequent integration of components is possible, it is less parsimonious
than assuming that anatomical elements of the rattle system evolved in an incremental modular fashion; (2) rapid
tail vibration is a plesiomorphic trait in rattlesnakes [7],
thus derived tailshaker muscles likely represent a refinement of the rattle system not a prerequisite, negating the
necessary link between tailshaker musculature and the rattle itself; (3) matrix morphology is both more precise than
style morphology and more directly influences rattle segment form; and (4) the rattle is the phenotypic component of the system that most directly interfaces with the
putative selective force (i.e., defense against predation).
Further phylogenetic analysis of other components of the
rattle system, and the analysis of gene expression patterns
and interactions between the preemptive rattle system
components may partially test the hypothesis presented
here that style morphology evolves indirectly as an integrated module with the developmental patterning of the
keratin-secreting matrix tissues.

Conclusion
The evolution of the rattlesnake style is characterized by
two independent transitions from small styles composed
of few coalesced vertebral elements to large, globose styles
composed of many caudal vertebrae. General morphological correlates of style and rattle morphology suggest that
size and shape of the style are related to rattle morphology
and the retention of rattle segments; however, as the rattle
is an integrated system, we do not suggest that selection
on style morphology predominately drives evolution of
rattle morphology. Many authors have speculated on the
evolutionary context of the origin of the rattle system [e.g.,
[7,31,32]], but as phylogenetic relationships become
resolved a more rigorous comparative approach to this
question can be attained by examining the sequence of
evolution of the various rattle system components, both
individually and in concert.
