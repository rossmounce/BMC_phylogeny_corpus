Abstract
Background: The iconic Pilbara in northwestern Australia is an ancient geological and biophysical
region that is an important zone of biodiversity, endemism and refugia. It also is overlain by some
of the oldest erosion surfaces on Earth, but very little is known about the patterns of biotic
diversity within the Pilbara or how they relate to the landscape. We combined phylogenetic and
spatial-autocorrelation genetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA data on populations of the gekkotan
lizard Lucasium stenodactylum within the Pilbara with geological, distributional and habitat data to
test the hypothesis that ancient surface geology predicts current clade-habitat associations in
saxicoline animals.
Results: This is the first detailed phylogenetic examination of a vertebrate organism across the
Pilbara region. Our phylogeny provides strong support for a deep and ancient phylogenetic split
within L. stenodactylum that distinguishes populations within the Pilbara region from those outside
the Pilbara. Within the Pilbara region itself, our phylogeny has identified five major clades whose
distribution closely matches different surface geologies of this ancient landscape. Each clade shows
strong affinities with particular terrain types and topographic regions, which are directly related to
different geological bedrock.
Conclusion: Together our phylogenetic, distributional, geological and habitat data provide a clear
example of ecological diversification across an ancient and heterogeneous landscape. Our favoured
hypothesis is that ancestors of the Pilbara lineages radiated into the region at the onset of aridity
in Australia approximately 5 mya and locally adapted to the various ancient and highly stable terrain
types and the micro-habitats derived from them. In terms of specimen recovery and analysis, we
are only beginning to reconstruct the biotic history of this ancient landscape. Our results show the
geological history and the habitats derived from them will form an important part of this emerging
story.

Background
The Pilbara in northwestern Australia is an ancient geological and biophysical region (Fig. 1) that has repeatedly
been identified as an important zone of biological diversity, endemism and past refugia based on congruent biogeographic patterns of both fauna and flora [1-3]. Our
understanding of the biotic history of the region is still in
its infancy (reviewed in [4]), but the geology of the Pilbara
region is well understood [5] and may serve as an important predictor of biological diversity.

The Pilbara is underlain by sedimentary and igneous rocks
ranging up to 3.72 billion years (Ga) in age, and overlain
by some of the most ancient erosion surfaces on Earth [6].
The Pilbara Craton in the northeastern portion of the
region has two parts; Archaean (3.72 to 2.85 Ga) granites
and metamorphosed volcanic rocks ("greenstones") in
the north, and, stratigraphically overlying these rocks in
the south, is a group of basinally-deposited, younger
(2.77 to 2.40 Ga) Archaean to Proterozoic iron-rich sedi-

mentary rocks now exposed in the Hamersley Range (Fig.
2) [7]. Much younger terrains underlain by unmetamorphosed sedimentary rock types surround the Pilbara Craton. The present Pilbara land surfaces are characterized by
a long history of tectonic stability and extremely slow rates
of erosion [8]. Unlike the east coast of Australia where
ongoing uplift commenced 80 million years ago (Ma) [9],
the Pilbara has not been tectonically active since the Late
Jurassic (160 Ma) when a continental sliver rifted away
from the Pilbara region of northern Australia [10].
The Pilbara Craton displays remarkable topographic heterogeneity compared to the coastal plains of the southern
Carnarvon and valley plains of the Ashburton regions, or
the undulating dunes of the sandy deserts to the east.
Major physiographic features of the Pilbara include the
plateaus and ranges of the Hamersley and Chichester, and
the heavily excised gorges of the Fortescue River as well as
a number of other major river systems that traverse the Pilbara including the Ashburton, the De Grey and the Shaw.

Only two previous studies, both on invertebrates, have
evaluated phylogenetic structure of organisms that span
the Pilbara and surrounding regions [11,12]. Both have
demonstrated that geological structures and complexity
are fundamental predictors of phylogenetic structure for
subterranean fauna, but there have been no similarly
detailed studies of vertebrate animals that span the Pilbara.
Lucasium stenodactylum is a diplodactylid gecko with a
large geographic range that includes the Pilbara region,
and is part of a gekkotan radiation of Gondwanan origin
[13,14]. We have detailed elsewhere the broader-level

molecular systematics and biogeography of the speciesgroup to which L. stenodactylum belongs, and identified an
ancient split between populations distributed in the
broader Pilbara region and those outside the Pilbara [4].
We are currently assessing the taxonomic status of the Pilbara populations. Here we consider L. stenodactylum populations within the Pilbara based on much larger and
more detailed sampling, with particular reference to testing the hypothesis that ancient surface geology, and the
habitats they determine, predicts phylogenetic structure in
these rock dependent animals.

Methods
Tissue samples were obtained for 169 Lucasium stenodactylum, of which 121 were from the Pilbara region (Table 1:
See Additional file 1). These animals represent nearly all
the L. stenodactylum specimens in tissue collections held
by the Western Australian Museum (WAM), and given the
current availability of specimens, exploit the maximum
possible geographical sampling from the species' range.
Samples from outside the Pilbara are limited in the central
and northern inland parts of Australia and are considered
elsewhere [4]. For all individuals a 1200-base pair (bp)
region of the mitochondrial genome was sequenced that
included the entire mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase
subunit 2 (ND2) gene and the flanking transfer RNA
(tRNA) genes tRNAMet (partial), and tRNATrp (entire),
tRNAAla (entire) and tRNAAsn (partial). Details of primers
and lab protocols are outlined elsewhere [4]. Lucasium
squarrosum and L. wombeyi were used as outgroups for all
analyses [4]. Therefore, we used unweighted parsimony
and Bayesian approaches to analyze the data. Heuristic
parsimony analyses were implemented with the computer
program PAUP*4.0b10. We used TBR branch swapping
and ran the parsimony analysis five times from random
starting points to make sure overall tree space was well
searched. Bayesian analyses were run with the computer
program MrBayes v3.1.2. We ran analyses on the full data
set as one unit and also partitioned the data into four
components: non-coding tRNA and first, second and third
codons. For both sets of analyses we allowed all parameters to be estimated from the data during the runs and
used the default value of four Markov chains per run. We
ran the full analyses five times to make sure overall treespace was well sampled and to avoid getting trapped in
local optima. We ran each analysis for a total of 2,000,000
generations and sampled the chain every 100 generations,
resulting in 40,000 sampled trees. Log-likelihood values
reached a plateau after approximately 100,000 generations for both sets of analyses (1,000 sampled trees), so
we discarded the first 5,000 trees as the burn-in and used
the last 35,000 trees to estimate Bayesian posterior probabilities. We used the results of 10,000 "fast" unweighted
non-parametric parsimony bootstrap replicates and Bayesian posterior probabilities to assess branch support.
We also used two complementary approaches to examine
fine-scale genetic patterns across and within the Pilbara
clades using GenAlEx 6.0 [15]. We used Mantel tests of
matrix correspondence following the methods of Smouse
et al. [16] to test for isolation by distance by comparing
the pairwise geographic and total genetic distance matrices across all samples, and within clades, with tests of significance by 9,999 permutations. We also used a powerful
micro-spatial autocorrelation technique developed by
Smouse and Peakall [17] that uses pairwise geographic
and genetic distance matrices to dissect out positive

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/152

genetic correlation at various geographic size classes (see
[18] for review; [19-21]). A significant departure from the
null hypothesis of no structure (r = 0) is obtained when a
positive r value falls outside of the 95% confidence interval and this is interpreted as the size of the "genetic neighbourhood" based on the data at hand. We used the
combined spatial autocorrelation analysis across the five
clades to provide an overall estimate of genetic neighbourhood size. We used a distance class of 10 km and
evaluated 150 size classes, giving an evaluation over 150
km of space.
For all 121 individuals from the Pilbara Region, we assembled a distributional data set based on latitude and longitude for mapping with ArcGIS Desktop (ESRI). Shapefiles
were created for each identified Pilbara clade from our
phylogeny and viewed in ArcMap. Distributions were
then overlain on to the Geological Regions Dataset
obtained from Geoscience Australia [22]. This dataset was
derived from the 1978 BMR 1:2,500,000 Geological Map
of Australia and includes metadata such as the age, landform and stratigraphy of different geographical regions
within the Australian continent. The distributions of the
major Pilbara clades also were examined with respect to
the land types on which they occur, based on a recent
inventory and condition survey of the Pilbara that takes
into account landforms, soils, vegetation and drainage
patterns [23]. These terrain types relate fundamentally to
the basement geology.

Results and Discussion
After the exclusion of unalignable regions in the tRNAs,
the edited alignment comprised 1142 characters and of
these 610 (53%) were variable and parsimony informative. We used ModelTest [24] to compare model parameter estimates with those generated for the Bayesian
analyses in Mr. Bayes. Both the hierarchical likelihood
ratio tests and the Akaike information criterion in ModelTest supported TrN+I+G model as the best-fit substitution
model for the combined data set and gave a -lnL =
7334.9434. The estimated parameters were as follows:
nucleotide frequencies A = 0.3422, C = 0.3387, G =
0.0734, T = 0.2457; substitution rates A↔C 1.000, A↔G
32.4198, A↔T 1.000, C↔G 1.000, C↔T 14.7978, G↔T
1.0000; proportion of invariant sites = 0.4750; gamma
shape parameter = 0.1.1596. The Bayesian analyses produced parameter estimates that were very similar to those
produced by ModelTest (not shown).
Unweighted parsimony analyses and both unpartitioned
and partitioned Bayesian analyses produced very similar
topologies. Figure 2a shows one of 100 most parsimonious trees saved during the unweighted parsimony analysis. Parsimony bootstrap support values and
unpartitioned Bayesian posterior probabilities are shown

for major branches only, but the results of our parsimony
bootstrap and unpartitioned Bayesian analyses with
details of each individual sample are shown in Additional
File

and
Additional
File
3PepperEtAlBayesian (results for the partitioned Bayesian
analyses were virtually identical to the unpartitioned and
are not shown).
The ND2+tRNA data set shows strong support for the
deep and old phylogenetic split between populations in
the Pilbara region (Clade A, bootstrap value 100, posterior probability 100) and non-Pilbara populations (Clade
B, bootstrap value 100, posterior probability 100), in
agreement with what we found based on a reduced
number of samples, but additional genes [4]. This result is
consistent with the stark geological contrast between the
ancient and exposed surface landscape and topography in
the Pilbara Craton relative to the surrounding dunefields
of the desert regions. For example, the Archaean to Proterozoic igneous (granites and greenstones) and sedimentary
rocks (ironstones and cherts) form rugged outcrops at the
surface in the Pilbara, and are elevated compared with surrounding regions. The lower-lying area to the south and
east of the Pilbara Craton is generally overlain by much
younger sedimentary rocks of Proterozoic to Cainozoic
age that have given rise to sandplains and dunefields [25].
The ND2+tRNA data set also identified five major clades
within the Pilbara endemic L. stenodactylum Clade A, with
generally high bootstrap values and posterior probabilities (Clade A1 bootstrap value = 98, posterior probability
= 100; Clade A2 bootstrap value = 94, posterior probability = 100; Clade A3 bootstrap value = 90, posterior probability = 100; Clade A4 bootstrap value = 100, posterior
probability = 100; Clade A5 has a high bootstrap value of
93 but the clade was not monophyletic in the Bayesian
analysis). Uncorrected genetic divergence between clades
ranged from 3.89% between A3 and A4 to 5.80% between
A2 and A5, and maximum uncorrected divergence within
each clade were as follows, A1: 1.49%, A2: 3.16%, A3:
1.75%, A4: 1.12%, A5: 1.67%. Our genetic data suggests
that the present-day lineages within the Pilbara are relatively young with inter-clade divergences dating to
approximately 3 – 4.5 mya and maximum intra-clade
divergences dating to 0.8 – 2.4 mya using a standard but
simplistic reptile 1.3%/my mtDNA clock [26]. Non-Pilbara Clade B exhibits deep genetic structure but this is not
the focus of this paper (see [4]).
Our phylogeny demonstrates that clade distributions are
remarkably correlated with geological (Figure 2b) and
topographic (Figure 2c) domains at both a large geographic scale (craton versus non-craton) and also at the
level of fine intra-craton provinciality. Clades A1, A3, A4
and A5 are predominantly restricted to the rugged Pilbara

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/152

Craton whereas Clade A2 is mostly confined to the lowerlying non-craton, for example the Carnarvon Sand Plains
west of the Craton. However, it is notable while Clade A2
extends eastwards of the 200 m contour from the Sand
Plains, this Clade does not extend onto the Craton at an
identical elevation (Figure 2c); the additional distributional controlling factor may be the contrast in exposed
rock types and their associated habitats. Within the Pilbara Craton, Clade A1 is restricted to the Hamersley Plateau and other upland regions in the ArchaeanProterozoic ironstone units in the south of the Craton.
Clade A5 is restricted to the sandy Abydos plain developed upon the Archean granite unit in the north of the
Craton and is bound to the east by the distinctive Gorge
Fold Ranges, a series of parallel, razor-back fold ridges, rising up to 80 m above the surrounding terrain [27] (Figure
2c). Clade A4 also is found in the far easternmost part of
this granite unit, but appears to be associated with the
ridges of the Gorge Fold Ranges. Although Clade A3 is distributed throughout both the Archaean-Proterozoic ironstone and the Archean granite unit in the eastern portion
of the Craton, this clade is absent from the ranges and
occupies the lowlands in the eastern part of the Craton,
extending its distribution up the Fortescue Valley. The
only clade found outside the Pilbara Craton is Clade A2,
which is almost exclusively associated with much younger
sandstone units that dominate the low-lying Carnarvon
Sand Plains along the northwestern Australian coastline.
A small number of individuals from this clade are found
within the Pilbara Craton on the Burrup Peninsula, but
these individuals are geographically connected to the rest
of the clade by the low-lying sandplains that stretch along
the coast. A number of major rivers traverse the Pilbara,
but the distribution of clades suggests these generally dry
riverbeds are not current barriers to dispersal in these animals.
Each clade exhibits a strong preference for a particular terrain type, each of which are related directly to underlying
geological structure. For example, Clades A1 and A3 are
associated with stony lower slopes and plains, while
Clade A2 is associated with sandplains, dunes and clay
pans. Clade A4 also prefers stony lower slopes and plains
while Clade A5 is distributed between sandplains, dunes
and claypans and stony lower slopes and plains. A Mantel
test across all five clades showed evidence of isolation by
distance in the genetic data (Mantel, Rxy = 0.470, P =
0.010). Strong isolation by distance also was detected in
four of the five individual clades (A1: Rxy = 0.141, P =
0.030; A2: Rxy = 0.702, P = 0.010; A3: Rxy = 0.468, P =
0.010; A5: Rxy = 0.625, P = 0.010), the exception being
clade A4, which has too few samples to do a meaningful
test. The combined spatial autocorrelation analysis
showed a significantly positive r value at all distance
classes less than 90 km (Figure 3), which demonstrates

Conclusion
Together our phylogenetic, distributional, geological and
habitat data provide a textbook example of ecological
diversification across an ancient and heterogeneous landscape. Basement geology and superimposed topography
have determined the varied micro-habitats available
across the Pilbara. Each of the different types of habitats
occupied by these lizards will experience quite different
temperature and humidity regimes, each of which should
contribute strongly to distribution of clades. While there
are a variety of possible explanations, our favoured
hypothesis is that ancestors of the Pilbara lineages radiated into the region at the onset of aridity in Australia
approximately 5 mya and locally adapted to these ancient
and highly stable terrain types and the micro-habitats
derived from them. Our results are broadly consistent
with patterns revealed by recent detailed phylogenetic
work on subterranean diving beetles [11] and amphipods
[12] in the Pilbara region. The Pilbara is well known as
important an important area for refugia with high levels
of endemism in a variety of plants and animals [1-3], but
we are only just now beginning to reconstruct the biotic
history of this ancient and complex landscape. The geological history and the habitats and micro-environments
derived from geological formations will form an important part of this emerging story.
