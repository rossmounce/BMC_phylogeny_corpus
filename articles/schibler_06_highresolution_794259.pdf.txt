Abstract
Background: Comparative mapping provides new insights into the evolutionary history of
genomes. In particular, recent studies in mammals have suggested a role for segmental duplication
in genome evolution. In some species such as Drosophila or maize, transposable elements (TEs)
have been shown to be involved in chromosomal rearrangements. In this work, we have explored
the presence of interspersed repeats in regions of chromosomal rearrangements, using an updated
high-resolution integrated comparative map among cattle, man and mouse.
Results: The bovine, human and mouse comparative autosomal map has been constructed using
data from bovine genetic and physical maps and from FISH-mapping studies. We confirm most
previous results but also reveal some discrepancies. A total of 211 conserved segments have been
identified between cattle and man, of which 33 are new segments and 72 correspond to extended,
previously known segments. The resulting map covers 91% and 90% of the human and bovine
genomes, respectively. Analysis of breakpoint regions revealed a high density of species-specific
interspersed repeats in the human and mouse genomes.
Conclusion: Analysis of the breakpoint regions has revealed specific repeat density patterns,
suggesting that TEs may have played a significant role in chromosome evolution and genome
plasticity. However, we cannot rule out that repeats and breakpoints accumulate independently in
the few same regions where modifications are better tolerated. Likewise, we cannot ascertain
whether increased TE density is the cause or the consequence of chromosome rearrangements.
Nevertheless, the identification of high density repeat clusters combined with a well-documented
repeat phylogeny should highlight probable breakpoints, and permit their precise dating. Combining
new statistical models taking the present information into account should help reconstruct
ancestral karyotypes.

Background
Comparative mapping represents a major approach in
providing new insights into dynamics of genome evolution. Since the pioneer studies that showed linkage conservation among genomes [1,2], genome comparisons
have been carried out in about 30 mammalian species [3].
Although Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) and
painting analyses have contributed significantly to the
identification of conserved syntenies among species [4],
the number of ordered gene maps is still too small to draw
fully meaningful inferences on chromosomal evolution.
In cattle and goats, we had previously reported [5] a high
level of intra-chromosomal rearrangements and the existence of preferential breakpoints over the whole genome,
which have been confirmed by Radiation Hybrid (RH)
mapping data [6-19]. Recently, two high-resolution
human-bovine comparative maps have been reported,
based on data from the human sequence and bovine RH
panels [6,7]. These studies have improved the genomewide comparative coverage by ~20% between man and
cattle and identified 195 and 161 segments with conserved gene order, respectively. The availability of whole
genome sequences for man, mouse and rat and in draft
format for eight other mammalian species has made it
possible to evaluate the rates of chromosomal evolution
and to detect segmental duplication in most of the primate-specific breakpoint regions [8]. In addition, Evertsvan der Wind et al [9] have analyzed the evolution of centromere and telomere positions and the gene content
within evolutionary breakpoint regions in cattle versus
man.
Here, we have explored the relationships between chromosomal rearrangements and the density of interspersed
repeats, since these represent a prevalent feature of mammalian genomes. Indeed, all mammalian genomes
present essentially the same four classes of transposable
elements (TEs): autonomous long interspersed nucleotide
elements (LINEs), LINE-dependent RNA-derived short
interspersed nucleotide elements (SINEs), retrovirus-like
elements with long terminal repeats (LTRs such as endogenous retroviruses ERVs and MaLRs) and DNA transposons (see [10-13] for review). The age and history of
these repeats have been inferred from phylogenic analyses
(for review see [14,15]), suggesting that most mammalian
TEs are related and thus can be divided into lineage-specific repeats (inserted after the divergence of the studied
species) and ancestral repeats (already present in a common ancestor). Moreover, TEs can undergo broad bursts
of amplification in a lineage specific way, potentially leading to speciation as suggested in Primates [16].
In order to carry out this study, first we have produced an
updated version of the bovine physical map constructed
in our laboratory [17], and have used it to extend and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/194

refine the bovine comparative map with man and mouse.
This has led to a high resolution comparative map integrated with the most recent bovine genetic map [18] and
FISH data [19]. Second, based on this comparative map,
we have identified and examined the intervals between
segments of conserved gene order (evolutionary breakpoint regions) among the cattle, human and mouse
genomes. We have found that these breakpoint regions
are enriched in lineage specific repeats: Alu repeats in man
and SINEs in mouse. Since previous studies have suggested that TEs could be involved in chromosomal rearrangements, we propose that the increased density of TEs
and especially SINEs in evolutionary breakpoint regions
has a role in mammalian chromosome evolution and we
discuss the recent findings of Murphy et al [8] on the
implication of segmental duplication.

Results
Updated bovine physical map
Our first autosomal bovine physical map reported in
2004 [17] comprised 6615 contigs of which 747 were
anchored to the cattle genome. In the present work, we
have anchored 350 additional contigs by PCR-screening
of 400 new well-distributed microsatellites. Moreover, we
have produced 53,550 BAC end sequences (BES) from
26,935 INRA BAC clones in collaboration with the Genoscope and collected 28,468 BES from the CHORI-240
library via Genbank. BLAST analyses of these BES produced 38,469 valid hits, of which 27,676 correspond to
known or predicted human genes and 10,793 are located
outside genes. BLAST statistics are similar in all cases, i.e.
88% mean identity percentage, 1.6 10-07 mean e-value
and 190 bp mean homology size. As a result, 9,323 INRA
and 4,318 CHORI-240 bovine clones have been anchored
to the human sequence.

To date, the updated version of our physical map comprises 5,081 contigs ranging from 150 kb to 5.5 Mb in size
(600 kb on average). Among these, 860 are anchored to
the bovine genome by 1,763 markers, 3,444 to the human
sequence and 774 to the genome of both species. These
774 contigs comprise 1121 bovine markers and 2,127 hits
on the human genome. Data are available through the cattle webFPC [20] or the BovMap database [21].
An integrated high-resolution comparative autosomal map
for cattle
To construct this comparative autosomal map, first we
used the 774 contigs anchored to both the bovine and
human genomes. Then, we added 598 FISH localizations
(131 microsatellites and 467 genes from [19], 213 of
which are also mapped to the contigs). Since contigs contain several BES, they are anchored to human genome
with 4290 positive BLASTs. Although the Btau 2.0 whole
genome assembly was released in the course of this work,

it was not used to draw meaningful conclusions for the
following reasons: (1) blasting large marker sets, which
had not been used to build Btau 2.0 assembly, showed
that it contained partial and sometimes erroneous data
(markers detected in more than one scaffold or at several
positions in the same scaffold and markers from different
bovine chromosomes present in the same scaffolds) and
(2) since the Btau 2.0 scaffolds were built based mainly on
syntenic relations with the human genome, there may be
a bias towards a reduced number of rearrangements
between these two species. Thus, the current bovine
assembly should be exploited with care and we only used
it to anchor 1519 additional microsatellites to the human
sequence.
As a result, our comparative map comprises 2721 loci
anchored to both the bovine and human genomes [see
additional file 1 and additional file 2].
According to the bovine genetic map, our physical map
covers 90% of the bovine autosomes and only BTA21 has
a coverage below 80%. Bovine orthologous regions have
been identified for about 91% of the human autosomes,
leaving 166 human segments (~2 Mb on average) without
comparative mapping information.
Our results reveal 68 conserved synteny segments
between bovine and human autosomes, in good agreement with previous studies [6,19]. If gene order is taken
into account, we identify 211 segments, of which 198
include at least two markers. Thus, our work has extended
or refined 72 known segments with conserved gene order
and identified 33 new segments. Only nine previously
reported segments based on single FISH localizations
have not been confirmed or remain inaccurate in the
present study (gene names and cytogenetic locations indicated in red in additional file 1: PPCB, NAB1, BMPR1B,
TXK, GM2A, GALT, PIGR, PIM1, ACPP).
Analysis of evolutionary breakpoints
Evolutionary breakpoint regions between two species are
defined as the interval between two segments of conserved gene order. They are classified into four types,
based on their likely origin (see Material and Methods and
Figure 1). Repeat densities have been computed for each
class of repeats and type of breakpoints and compared to
the densities along the human or mouse chromosomes.
Repeat densities were not computed along the bovine
genome because of flaws in the bovine genome sequence.
Indeed, bovine scaffolds are in general smaller than the
corresponding BAC contig lengths and contain many
large gaps. Scaffolds contain only one third to one half of
the sequence of the corresponding genomic region. This is
consistent with assembly statistics describing that ~34%
of the bovine genome are covered by anchored scaffolds.

Moreover, typical errors in draft genome sequences
include misassemblies of repeated sequences, collapses of
repeated regions, making such sequences difficult to use
for repeat content analysis.
The one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, based on the
repeat density, showed an increased density of several
interspersed sequences in certain regions. P-values are
given in Figure 2 and Figure 3 [see also Additional file 3].
We have detected a highly significant increased density of
SINE Alu repeats in the human sequences corresponding
to HSA and MMU breakpoints but not to the BTA breakpoints (see Figure 4 for an example). A Principal Components Analysis (Figure 5) suggests that most of the HSA
breakpoints are enriched in various repeats: three HSA
breakpoints contain only a high density of ancient Alu
repeats, four only a high density of young Alu repeats and
four display an elevated frequency in L1 repeats (L1MB3,
L1MB7 and L1MC5).
The same analysis performed on MMU breakpoints shows
a strong correlation between all repeat densities (data not
shown). Analysis of the mouse sequences reveals an
increased density of some rodent specific SINEs B1, B2, B4
and ID in MMU breakpoints, whereas the BTA and HSA
breakpoints do not show any difference with the whole
mouse genome. Moreover, 23 MMU breakpoints are
enriched only in ERV-L (MT2A, MT2B B or RMER10) or
ERV-K RMER17C. Five of these MMU breakpoints also
delineate breakpoint regions in rat, suggesting that they
occurred in the Mus lineage.
Human sequences of 28 BTA breakpoints display an Alu
repeat content typical of HSA breakpoints, with an
increase mainly in the oldest Alu repeats (FRAM, FLAM,
AluJ, AluSx). Likewise, a repeat content typical from MMU
breakpoints is also observed in the orthologous mouse
sequences.
Moreover, a search for centromeric or telomeric satellites
in the human sequence has shown that 24 breakpoint
regions contain at least two satellite repeats. About 71% of
these breakpoints involve two different chromosomes
and may thus be considered as interchromosomal breakpoint regions, whereas 29% may be intrachromosomal
breakpoint regions [see additional file 3]. Although not
statistically significant, satellites may be slightly over-represented in interchromosomal breakpoints. About 11%
and 4% of interchromosomal and intrachromosomal
breakpoint regions contain satellite repeats, respectively.

Principle of the classification of breakpoints. Classification of breakpoints is exemplified by real data. Chromosomes for
each species are drawn as colored boxes, with chromosome numbers indicated in the boxes. Positions along the genome (base
pairs or cM) are written on the right. Breaks in boxes and * indicate evolutionary breakpoints. Genomes are drawn aligned
along the human and mouse sequences. a) The breakpoint occurs solely in the bovine genome, in both genome alignments. This
situation is classified as a BTA breakpoint. b) The breakpoint involves two mouse chromosome segments based on the human
alignment. When aligned on the mouse genome, these segments define breakpoints in both human and bovine genomes. This
situation is classified as a MMU breakpoint. c) The breakpoint involves both the bovine and the mouse genomes based on the
human alignment. When aligned along the mouse genome, these regions define breakpoints only in the human genome. This
situation is classified as a HSA breakpoint. d) The breakpoint involves either telomeres or centromeres. This situation is classified as TeloCentro. e) The breakpoint is classified in a different way according to the human and mouse alignments. This situation is classified as a breakpoint Reuse.

Results of the one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
in the human sequence. P-values for the "greater"
hypothesis are shown for each class of breakpoints and for
repeats with significant results. Highly significant p-values are
indicated with a light grey background.

Conversely, human sequences spanning regions of BTA
breakpoints do not reveal any enrichment in Alu repeats,
which suggests that they may be associated with repeats
having different insertional characteristics. Bovine lineage
specific SINEs or LINEs Bov-tA, Bov-A2 or Bov-B could be
good candidates for such repeats and this hypothesis
should be assessed after completion of the bovine whole
genome sequence.
Moreover, 28 BTA breakpoints show a typical HSA and
MMU repeat content in the corresponding human and
mouse sequences. If we assume that Rodents diverged
from a Primate-Artiodactyl clade, about 50% of the
human rearrangements should have also occurred independently in mice, suggesting a very high frequency of
convergent evolution. If one rejects this hypothesis, then
Artiodactyls may be more distant from human than are
rodents. Thus, this analysis of the repeat content in evolutionary breakpoint regions supports the recent hypothesis
that Artiodactyls diverged from a Primate-Rodent clade
[22-24].

Discussion
Discrepancies between different bovine comparative maps
The autosomal comparative map reported here is in good
agreement with previous studies based either on FISH or
RH mapping of genes. Most discrepancies are due to differences between framework maps, especially in that
reported in 2004 by Everts-van der Wind et al, which was
built with a low resolution RH5000 panel and a reduced
number of backbone microsatellites. Erroneous identification of orthologous sequences may also introduce some
errors in all studies and contribute to the observed discrepancies. Moreover nine cattle FISH localizations have
been found to be inconsistent, probably due to false
orthologous gene pairs or mapping errors.
Breakpoint regions display a high density of lineage
specific repeats
We have shown an association between the density of
interspersed repeats and the evolutionary breakpoints in
the human and mouse genomes. Interestingly, the repeat
increase in these regions concerns only repeats having
spread after the divergence of these species. Moreover, for
a given species, only breakpoint regions having occurred
within this species are enriched in repeats and more surprisingly, in species specific repeats, except for MMU
breakpoints that appear to be Alu rich in the human
sequence. This latter result agrees with the strong correlation observed between the local SINE density in mouse
and the Alu density in orthologous loci in man [15]. Common biological factors governing the insertion and/or

Since evolutionary breakpoints appear to be enriched in
specific interspersed repeats, widespread activity of TEs
could be involved in genome evolution. Indeed, they provide material for DNA mispairing and thus can lead to
genomic instability and rearrangements. A key role of TEs
in intrachromosomal rearrangements (large deletions,
translocations, inversions) has been evidenced in Drosophila [25-31], Mosquito [32-34], Man [32-34] and
Maize [35]. Likewise, in human tumors, the high density
of repetitive DNA in a given region provides hot spots for
homologous recombination and mediates translocation
processes [36].
Moreover, Alu mispairing could have generated many segmental duplications [37,38] that are found in most primate-specific breakpoint regions, suggesting their role in
chromosomal rearrangements [8,39-41].
However, it is possible that repeats and breakpoints accumulate independently but in the same region where modifications are better tolerated. High repeat densities could
also be a consequence of breakpoints as suggested by
Dobigny et al [42] i.e. major regulation pathway of repatterned genomes could be transiently inefficient, thus
resulting in conditions suitable for TE amplification.
An overall model of genome evolution
Genomes may evolve cyclically under the influence of
three main factors: transposon normal activity, bursts of

Examples of increased TE density. The figure presents the comparative bovine/human/mouse map for a segment of
HSA10. a) Alu density is increased in the human genome in the vicinity of an HSA breakpoint. b) Alu density is increased in the
mouse genome, in the vicinity of a MMU breakpoint. c) No repeat density increase is observed in the human or mouse genome
in the vicinity of a BTA breakpoint region. d) Alu density is increased in both human and mouse genomes in a MMU breakpoint,
probably due to the strong correlation observed between the local SINE density in mouse and the Alu density in orthologous
loci in man.

transposon activity and dynamics of centromeres and telomeres.
(i) Normal transposon activity may be responsible for
most small intrachromosomal rearrangements (small
duplications, deletions or inversions... for review, see
[43]).
(ii) Bursts of transposon activity result in a dramatic
increase of the local repeat density and thus, may induce
large intrachromosomal rearrangements directly or indirectly by segmental duplications. For example, Alu repeats
and rodent SINEs could have given rise to most of the
intrachromosomal rearrangements during a middle term
period (80–50 Million years (Myr)), while during a more
recent period (4–10 Myr), ERVs could have caused at least
18 rearrangements in the ancestor of the Muridae and five
in the mouse.
(iii) Chromosome fusions or fissions may have produced
most interchromosomal rearrangements, as suggested by
the proportion of interchromosomal breakpoints con-

taining centromeric and telomeric satellites (present
study) and by early cytogenetic analyses [44]. Likewise, a
recent study has revealed a clustering of centromere and
telomere sequences at the site of evolutionary breakages
[8]. Telomeres may have mediated or enhanced these rearrangements, as demonstrated for subtelomeres [45]. It has
been shown that centromeres can be repositioned or created de novo and thus they could be involved in stabilizing
interchromosomal rearrangements.
This model agrees both with the random breakage and the
'fragile breakage' models proposed by Nadeau [2] and
Pevzner [46,47], respectively. On the one hand, rearrangements may occur in repeat-rich regions that are roughly
randomly distributed along the genome, even if SINEs are
preferentially located in GC-rich regions whereas LINEs
are essentially present in AT-rich regions. On the other
hand, the high density of repeats could promote both hot
spots of chromosomal evolution [48] and segmental
duplications, in accordance with the fragile breakpoint
model. Moreover, the mammalian genome tolerates
insertion and accumulation of repeats only in a limited

number of regions as indicated by the clustering of some
repeats in orthologous regions from different species.
Repeat families may have sequentially gathered in the
same regions, potentially leading to successive rearrangements. Such regions may thus appear as 'fragile' and could
explain that nearly 20% of the breakpoints are reused during mammalian evolution [8]. In addition, some regions
could be involved in evolutionary breakpoints in one species and could lead to disease in another, as suggested by
the close relationship between evolutionary breakpoints
and neoplasia-associated human chromosome sites [5].

Conclusion
In this paper, we report a high-resolution integrated
bovine comparative map with man and mouse based on
microsatellites, INRA bovine contigs, BAC End sequencing and previous FISH data. This comparative physical
map should be useful for the assembly of the bovine
whole genome sequence.
Moreover, it has allowed us to analyze the DNA content
in breakpoint regions to reveal specific repeat density patterns. Thus, 'junk DNA' may have played a significant role

in chromosome evolution and genome plasticity. Periodic
phases of intrachromosomal rearrangements (due to
interspersed repeats), followed by interchromosomal
rearrangements (providing new opportunities for later
intrachromosomal recombinations) could be the driving
force of genome evolution. Interestingly, amplification of
TEs has been described as a response to stress factors
either of environmental origin or genomic nature (see
[49] for review). In our model, TE mediated chromosome
evolution, leading to new gene regulations and expressions, could thus represent an inventive mechanism to
speed up fitness to new environmental conditions, leading to speciation.
However, more studies are required to ascertain whether
increased TE density is the cause or the consequence of
chromosome rearrangements. Moreover, we cannot rule
out that repeats and breakpoints accumulate independently in the few same regions where modifications are better tolerated. Nevertheless, high density repeat clusters
combined with a well-documented repeat phylogeny
should highlight probable breakpoints, and permit their
precise dating. New statistical models of evolution should
be developed, taking into account not only the parsimony
principle but also the present information in order to help
reconstruct ancestral karyotypes.

Methods
Anchoring the physical map
The INRA bovine BAC library was screened by PCR using
published microsatellite primer pairs (see BovMap database [21]) as previously described [17].

In collaboration with the Genoscope, we produced
53,550 BES from 26,935 INRA BAC clones and we collected another 28,468 BES from the CHORI-240 library
via Genbank. Similarities with the human sequence
(NCBI built 35) were searched for by BLASTN after repeatmasking ([50]) We used an expectation value E of 10-5 as
the significance threshold for comparisons, since this
value was shown to provide 95% accuracy in identifying
orthologs [51]. Coordinates in the human sequence were
then obtained for each retained hit using GoldenPath
[52]. After localizing microsatellites in the bovine scaffolds by BLASTN analysis, the position of the bovine scaffolds on the human sequence were determined using
BLASTN with parameters set to optimize detection of distant homologies (Ensembl BLASTView: W9, M1, N-1, Q2,
R1).
Segment identification and integration of FISH and
bibliographic data
After aligning the contigs along the bovine genome using
the Ihara and USDA97 linkage maps [18,53], microsatel-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/194

lite BLAST results and FISH-mapping data were integrated
into this framework map.
The boundaries of conserved segments between the
bovine and human genomes were defined according to a
parsimonious interpretation. Discrepancies in microsatellite and FISH-mapped gene locations between backbone
maps were resolved by choosing the location that minimized rearrangements between the bovine and the
human genomes.
Searching for particular sequence features in breakpoint
regions
Evolutionary breakpoint regions between two species
were defined as the interval between two segments of conserved gene order. As illustrated in the left part of Figure 1,
breakpoint regions were classified into four categories,
based on the human alignment:

- BTA breakpoints, having probably taken place in the
bovine lineage, when a perfect co-linearity is observed
between human and mouse maps, but not with the
bovine map. (Figure 1a: the breakpoint region is identified only in cattle).
- MMU breakpoints, having probably taken place in the
mouse lineage, when a perfect co-linearity is observed
between human and bovine maps, but not with the
mouse map (Figure 1b: the breakpoint region is detected
only in mouse).
- HSA breakpoints, having probably taken place in the
human lineage, when no co-linearity is observed among
human, mouse or bovine maps. (Figure 1c: the breakpoint region is identified both in cattle and mouse).
- TeloCentro, when either telomeres or centromeres are
involved in the breakpoint (Figure 1d).
The same classification was also performed based on the
mouse alignment (right part of Figure 1). When identical
breakpoint regions fell into different categories according
to the human or mouse alignments (Figure 1e), they were
discarded from the global analysis because they could represent regions of breakpoint reuse. Breakpoints involving
centromeres or telomeres were likewise discarded because
these regions may be poorly represented in the genome
assemblies and rearrangements may have been mediated
by centromeres or telomeres, independently of the repeats
we wanted to analyze.
Human and mouse chromosome masked sequences
(chromFaMasked.zip) and repeat annotations (chromOut.zip) were downloaded from UCSC [54].

The density (number of repeat per Mb of DNA) of each
class of repeats was computed for each kind of breakpoint
region. Likewise, densities were also computed along each
chromosome in sliding windows of different sizes (0.5, 1,
2, 3, 4 and 5 Mb). The proportion of densities, in these
sliding windows, greater than the density in each repeat
region was then computed for each class of repeats. These
calculations were performed using sliding widows of a
size range similar to the breakpoint region size.
Enrichment was tested by applying the one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to these proportions (distribution
under the null-hypothesis is uniform on [0,1]) and using
the R software.
Classification results, positions on human and mouse
sequences, repeat densities and proportions of frequencies are available as supplementary data (break_supp).
