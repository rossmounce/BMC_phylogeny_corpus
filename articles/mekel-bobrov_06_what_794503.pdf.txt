Abstract
In 1970, Karl Pribram took on the immense challenge of asking the question, what makes us human?
Nearly four decades later, the most significant finding has been the undeniable realization of how
incredibly subtle and fine-scaled the unique biological features of our species must be. The recent
explosion in the availability of large-scale sequence data, however, and the consequent emergence
of comparative genomics, are rapidly transforming the study of human evolution. The field of
comparative genomics is allowing us to reach unparalleled resolution, reframing our questions in
reference to DNA sequence – the very unit that evolution operates on. But like any reductionist
approach, it comes at a price. Comparative genomics may provide the necessary resolution for
identifying rare DNA sequence differences in a vast sea of conservation, but ultimately we will have
to face the challenge of figuring out how DNA sequence divergence translates into phenotypic
divergence. Our goal here is to provide a brief outline of the major findings made in the study of
human brain evolution since the Pribram lecture, focusing specifically on the field of comparative
genomics. We then discuss the broader implications of these findings and the future challenges that
are in store.

Background
In his seminal lecture in 1970, Karl Pribram asked the
question, what makes us human? Nearly four decades of
research has accumulated since, and major technical
advances have been made, but our newly-gained perspective affords us little more than the realization of how
exceedingly subtle and fine-scaled the unique biological
features of our species must be. This is nowhere more evident than in studies of the human brain. Our evolutionary
history has generated a vast repertoire of behavioral oddities, which to most stand out as entirely unique and
remarkably divergent from other species, and to many is
an obvious testament to our singular position in nature.

Faced by our great lack of discernibly unique biological
features, however, just how this evolutionary feat was
achieved is anything but obvious.
Traditionally, studies of brain evolution have focused on
comparative neuroanatomy. By the time of Darwin's Origin of Species in 1859, anatomical variation among species
had been the subject of contentious debate for several decades [1]. Mirroring the philosophical rift of the early 19th
century, biologists of the time were divided between the
rationalists' functional taxonomy and a structural morphology based on generalized archetypes. Darwinian evolution provided a theoretical framework that accounted

for both form and function, by bringing together heredity
and adaptation under the single umbrella of natural selection [2]. Championed by the studies of Thomas Huxley,
Darwinian theory quickly came to dominate interpretations of comparative neural anatomy, and the field of evolutionary neurobiology was born. Advances in
microscopy around the turn of the century propelled the
field forward, providing key insights into interspecies variation in the structural compartmentalization of the brain.
As progress in histological techniques continued through
most of the twentieth century, studies in comparative neural anatomy generated invaluable data on variation in
both cellular organization and subcellular neuronal components. Thus, the study of brain evolution, from its
inception, has been entrenched in the tradition of comparative anatomy.
Comparative anatomy on its own, however, has relatively
limited resolution, unable to distinguish between many
neuronal subtypes or identify small-scale structural variation. In 1970, when Pribram was calling for a biological
definition of the uniquely human cognitive process of
transforming experience into meaning, the life sciences
were on the verge of a revolution. With major technological advances ushering in the molecular era of biology, the
study of brain evolution has been integrating new highresolution approaches. New data on gene expression,
allowing finer classification of neuronal subtypes and histogenic fields, have revealed detailed homologies among
various subdivisions of the vertebrate brain [3-5]. The
advent of targeted mutagenesis, gene knockdown, and
transgenic technologies in a wide range of model organisms has begun to elucidate the complex interplay
between evolutionary conservation and the emergence of
novel functions [6]. Perhaps most importantly, after a
century of fission between evolutionary biology and
embryology, advances in developmental genetics have
sparked a renewed interest in the role of ontogeny in phylogenetic change. More nuanced than Haeckel's biogenic
law of ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny, the new evolutionary developmental biology views development as the
substrate of evolutionary change [7]. Thus, the study of
brain evolution today is markedly different from its predecessor four decades ago. This transformation marks a true
paradigm shift; the very concepts of conservation and
divergence now redefined in the context of molecular phenotypes and developmental processes.
Whereas the overall field of evolutionary neurobiology
has undergone a major transformation over the past few
decades, the study of human brain evolution has
remained largely unchanged. This discrepancy is due to
the technical and ethical limitations inherent to any study
of human subjects. This observation is underscored by the
tremendous focus still placed in studies of human brain

http://www.j-biomed-discovery.com/content/1/1/18

evolution on broad issues of scaling and allometry [8]. A
major challenge, therefore, is to find alternative
approaches for enhancing our resolution of interspecies
variation.
One such approach is the field of comparative genomics.
The last decade has seen an explosion in the availability of
large-scale sequence data for both human and nonhuman
species. The first publication of the human genome in
2001 heralded the long-awaited arrival of the genomic
era, and with many other genome projects either completed or underway, the newly emergent field of comparative genomics has rapidly become a major staple of
evolutionary analysis. This new approach affords us
unparalleled resolution, as the study of molecular divergence, by definition, gets at the most fundamental level of
evolutionary change. Though still in its infancy, the field
of comparative genomics has already made important
progress in probing the genetic basis of what makes us
human. Our goals here are to provide a brief outline of
these findings; to discuss their broader implications for
the study of human brain evolution; and ultimately, we
hope, to demonstrate the utility of this approach in narrowing the gap between human and nonhuman evolutionary neurobiology.
Comparative genomics and the unique features of the
human genome
The first publication of the human genome in 2001 [9]
marked a turning point in the study of human biology. It
was only with the availability of large-scale sequence data
from other vertebrate species, however, that we could
begin a comparative approach, to identify those features
of our genome, which potentially underlie the unique
human phenotype. Studies in comparative genomics, on
several taxonomic levels, have made great strides in identifying the important features of our lineage, shared by virtue of being vertebrates, mammals, primates,
anthropoids, etc' [10-13]. But the recent genome publication of our closest living relative, the chimpanzee [14],
coupled with large-scale data from various outgroup species, now allows us for the first time to identify the features of our genome that are truly unique to our species,
and are, as such, the building blocks of the distinct human
phenotype.

Comparisons of the human and chimpanzee genomes
have identified 35 million single nucleotide substitutions,
roughly a 1.23% single nucleotide divergence [14]. After
removing the portion of substitutions showing intraspecies polymorphism, the human-chimp single nucleotide
divergence is estimated at roughly 1%. As had been previously observed at specific loci [15], however, insertion
and deletions (indels) are major contributors to the
human-chimpanzee divergence. Roughly 90 Mb in total,

Journal of Biomedical Discovery and Collaboration 2006, 1:18

indels raise the overall human-chimpanzee divergence to
approximately 4%, significantly higher than most previous estimates [16,17]. Curiously, the human insertions do
not appear to be randomly distributed across the genome,
but rather clustered together on a subset of chromosomes.
Whether this positional bias has some functional significance, or is strictly the result of their evolutionary history,
remains to be seen. Nonetheless, in regards to proteincoding sequences, the human-chimpanzee divergence is
less than 1%, with the average protein differing by only
two amino acids.
The human and chimpanzee genomes show structural differences as well, ranging in scale from local events to largescale chromosomal alterations. Sequence inversions
between humans and chimpanzees are estimated at over
1500 events, ranging in size from 23 bp to as large as 62
Mb [18]. Cheng et al. identified 296 regions in the human
genome showing significant copy number increases in
humans compared to chimpanzees. These segmental
duplications span 7.2 Mb and are preferentially located in
pericentromeric regions and on chromosomes 5 and 15
[19]. Identifying segmental duplications, though long
thought to be a key mechanism for generating evolutionary novelty [20], poses a serious technical challenge, since
the method used to generate the chimpanzee draft
sequence has considerable difficulty in distinguishing
between highly similar sequences [21]. To address this
problem, Locke et al. developed an array-based comparative genomic hybridization method; using an array of
2,460 human bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs),
they demonstrated the utility of this approach in identifying deletions and duplications that cannot be resolved by
whole-genome shotgun sequencing [22]. Wilson et al.
subsequently adopted this approach, using a wholegenome human BAC array. They identified 63 chromosomal segments showing increased copy number in
humans relative to chimpanzees, ranging in size from
0.65 to 1.3 Mb, and spanning almost 200 genes [23].
Alternatively, cDNA arrays have also been used. Using this
approach, Fortna et al. identified 1,005 genes showing
variation in copy number among hominoid lineages, and
found that copy number expansions were most pronounced in humans, with 134 genes showing increased
copy number and only six showing copy number decrease
[24]. Finally, repetitive elements such as LINEs (long
interspersed elements) and SINEs (short interspersed elements) can spread and expand throughout the genome by
reverse transcription, resulting in potentially important
modifications to either coding or regulatory sequences
[25]. Comparison of repetitive elements between humans
and chimpanzees has shown that Alu elements, the most
common type of SINEs in humans [26], have expanded in
the human genome to a frequency three times higher than
that of chimpanzees [14].

Genomic comparisons with our closest living relative is a
necessary first step towards identifying human-specific
genomic features, but the addition of informative outgroup species is essential for narrowing down these differences to those that are uniquely human, rather than
uniquely chimpanzee. The choice of outgroup species,
however, is not always straightforward, as it can have considerable impact on one's findings. In a comparison of
7,645 orthologous genes between humans and chimpanzees, Clark et al. used the mouse as the outgroup species
[27]. The long divergence time between rodents and primates introduced considerable error in inferring the
ancestral states between the human and chimpanzee
sequences, particularly at rapidly evolving sites. Consequently, in their choice of an outgroup, Yu et al. used a primate species instead, finding that in human-chimpanzee
comparisons, the macaque monkey performed much better than the mouse [28]. Thus, as additional primate
genome sequences become available, our power to detect
human-specific genomic features will demonstrably
increase. Genome sequences of other great apes may
prove particularly important, since changes in humans,
which are absent in other hominids, are likely to be central to "what makes us human".
Beyond a catalog of genomic features: searching for
adaptive evolution
Comparative genomics is allowing us to assemble a catalog of genomic features unique to our species. Such a catalog, however, is not a description of the genetic basis of
the human phenotype, as many of the genomic features
identified may bear little functional relevance for understanding the human condition. How do we identify the
subset of functionally important features? The most
prominent approach has been to search for loci in the
genome that show evidence of adaptive evolution [29].
Given that a history of adaptive evolution, by definition,
indicates that a human-specific change in the genome has
had functional implications, putatively adaptive loci are
the strongest candidates for understanding the genetic
basis of the human phenotype.

Several different signatures of adaptive evolution in the
genome have been used to identify putatively adaptive
loci. For protein-coding sequences, a powerful approach
has been to compare the frequency of amino acid-changing, or nonsynonymous, substitutions at a locus (Ka), to
the frequency of synonymous substitutions (Ks). Since
most nonsynonymous substitutions are deleterious [30]
whereas synonymous substitutions are generally neutral,
the latter are much more likely to become common or
fixed in a population, and Ka is expected to be much
smaller than Ks. Nonsynonymous substitutions that confer an adaptive advantage, however, may rise very rapidly
in frequency. Thus, a high Ka/Ks ratio at a locus is a poten-

tial signature of adaptive evolution [31]. This approach
has been very successful in identifying the specific classes
of genes in humans that are most strongly implicated in
adaptive evolution. In a study of 7,645 orthologous genes
between human and chimpanzee, analysis of Ka/Ks ratios
found that genes subject to adaptive evolution in the
human lineage are mainly involved in olfaction and
nuclear transport [27]. More recently, analysis of 13,731
human-chimpanzee orthologs expanded this functional
categorization to genes involved in sensory perception,
immune response, apoptosis, and spermatogenesis [32].
Although genes expressed in the brain tend to be highly
conserved, Dorus et al. showed that, nonetheless, this
class of genes shows higher Ka/Ks ratios in humans than in
other primate lineages, including the chimpanzee [33],
and Yu et al. identified a subset of 47 genes, expressed in
the brain, that show a particularly strong signature of
adaptive evolution [28].

synonymous to nonsynonymous substitutions between
and within species. Under neutrality, these two ratios are
expected to be equal, as interspecies divergence and
intraspecies polymorphism are both linearly related to the
neutral mutation rate. The McDonald-Kreitman tests look
for an excess of nonsynonymous substitutions between
species, relative to that found within a species. In a comparison of interspecies divergence to intraspecies polymorphism between human and macaque, Fay et al.
estimated an accumulation of up to 1 adaptive substitution every 200 years since the divergence between humans
and old world monkeys [41]. In a large-scale study of over
11,000 loci in humans and chimpanzees, Bustamante et
al. identified 304 genes showing signatures of adaptive
evolution [42]. Similar to Nielsen et al.'s Ka/Ks study, their
findings also showed an overrepresentation of genes
involved in immune response, gametogenesis, apoptosis,
and sensory perception.

Although this approach can be very powerful, high rates
of nonsynonymous substitutions may also result from a
relaxation in selective constraint [34]. The stringent
requirement of Ka/Ks > 1 overcomes this problem, as
relaxed constraint will not elevate Ka beyond Ks. The detection power is then greatly reduced, however, since adaptive evolution at specific sites in a gene and along specific
lineages, may be swamped by the effects of purifying
selection across the gene as a whole and across most of the
phylogeny. Consequently, several methods have been
developed to estimate Ka/Ks ratios, either for individual
portions of the gene or for individual lineages. For genes
with well-defined functional domains, estimates can be
made for each domain separately [35]. A gene may also be
partitioned randomly into a set of windows, for which
independent estimates are calculated [36]. Alternatively,
site-specific methods have also been developed; these
methods estimate the substitution rates of each individual
site by using Maximum Likelihood (ML) models of a variable Ka/Ks ratio [37]. To estimate Ka/Ks ratios for individual lineages, one approach has been to infer the ancestral
sequence by parsimony to allow pairwise comparison
with each lineage separately [38]. Alternatively, branchspecific ML models have been developed, in which the Ka/
Ks ratio is allowed to vary across individual branches in a
phylogeny [39]. All of these methods increase our power
to detect loci subject to adaptive evolution, either at a limited number of sites or across short evolutionary distances, while maintaining the stringency of Ka/Ks > 1.
Recently, ML methods have also been developed for combining the site-specific and branch-specific models, to
help detect episodes of adaptive evolution occurring at
specific sites in a gene and along individual lineages [40].

Other methods have been developed, based exclusively
on intraspecies polymorphism, using reduced genetic
diversity, high-frequency derived alleles, differentiation
between populations, and high-frequency young haplotypes, as signatures of adaptive evolution in the very
recent history of the species [43]. Though beyond the
scope of this paper, it should be noted that polymorphism-based approaches are providing important complements
to
comparative
genomic
methods.
Development of genome-wide datasets of human variation, such as the HapMap project [44] and the more
restricted Seattle SNP database [45], will allow further
implementation of population genetic approaches to the
study of human evolution on a genomic scale.

A second approach for identifying signatures of adaptive
evolution in coding sequences is to compare the ratios of

For evolutionary analysis of gene duplications, far fewer
analytical tools are available. Large interspecies differences in the sizes of gene families are often attributed to
adaptive evolution [46]; this has been based mostly, however, on qualitative assumptions regarding the magnitude
and frequency of the duplication events expected to persist in the population through neutral stochastic processes. The difficulty in assessing the significance of species
differences in gene family size stems primarily from our
lack of testable null models, making probabilistic statements impossible. Recently, Hahn et al. have demonstrated the utility of the stochastic birth-death process for
modeling gene family evolution [47]. This model is based
on continuous-time Markov processes, where states represent the current size of a population (gene copy number)
and state transitions are defined by birth and death rates
(the frequency of gene duplication and deletion events).
Thus, specific hypotheses can be tested against a null
model of random gene birth and death. Processes such as
natural selection are predicted to violate the null birthdeath model, causing extreme expansions or contractions

in gene family size. This approach, though potentially
very powerful, requires whole genome sequences of several closely related species, to test whether a gene family is
evenly diffused across a phylogeny. Consequently, Hahn
et al. used five closely related yeast species to demonstrate
the utility of this approach, but its application to human
evolution awaits the availability of additional primate
whole genome sequences.
Over the past decade we've come to appreciate the potential functional importance of many noncoding sequences.
Evolutionary analysis, however, is complicated by the difficulty in identifying functionally active noncoding elements. Because of the short divergence time between
humans and chimpanzees, long-range conservation is not
a good indicator of functional constraint. Several methods
have recently shown great promise in moving the field forward. Heissig et al. compared the transcriptional activity
of twelve promoters between humans and chimpanzees.
Using a promoter assay in cell culture, seven of the twelve
promoters were found to differ significantly between the
two species, demonstrating the potential importance of
promoter sequences in human evolution [48]. Searching
for conservation between distantly related mammals and
amniotes to identify potentially functional noncoding
elements, Bush and Lahn found that many putative regulatory elements showed strong selective constraint
between humans and chimpanzees [49]. Using a similar
approach, Pollard et al. identified regions of the human
genome showing lineage-specific acceleration. Of these,
the most dramatic acceleration was found in a novel RNA
gene that is expressed specifically in Cajal-Retzius neurons
of the developing human neocortex, during cortical neuron specification and migration [50]. Donaldson and
Göttgens used the consensus sequences of transcription
factor binding sites to identify putative regulatory elements that are conserved between mouse and chimpanzee, but different in humans [51]. Their results showed
that a significant proportion of human-chimpanzee
sequence differences lie in these putative regulatory elements, suggesting that changes in transcriptional regulation has played an important role in shaping the human
phenotype.
From genotype to phenotype
The use of comparative genomics to answer what makes
us human is inherently a reductionist approach. By breaking down the organism into a collection of nucleotide
sequences, we can more easily ask what it is about our
own sequence that makes us unique as a species. This
approach is attractive, since evolution first and foremost
acts at the level of DNA sequence. But the selective regime
is imposed on the entire organism (or even more broadly
on kin groups or populations), so the reductionist
approach is a good starting point, but what we really want

http://www.j-biomed-discovery.com/content/1/1/18

to understand is how it relates to constructing the human
phenotype. Several approaches have been used to try and
bridge the gap between genotype and phenotype, but as
we'll discuss at the end, this challenge remains the biggest
hurdle to overcome.
The use of human disease data in conjunction with comparative genomics has been a useful approach in taking
the first step towards understanding the potential phenotypic consequences of an evolutionary change. The transcription factor FOXP2 has been implicated in the
cognitive process underlying speech and language [52].
Evolutionary analysis of FOXP2 identified two humanspecific amino acid changes, and showed that this gene
has been subject to strong adaptive evolution in humans
since the divergence between humans and chimpanzees
[53]. This has led to the hypothesis that the evolution of
FOXP2 may have contributed to the emergence of human
language. ASPM and Microcephalin are two of six loci associated with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly, a
developmental defect in which the overall architecture of
the brain is preserved, but its volume is reduced three-fold
to the size of the early hominid brain [54]. Both genes
contain several human-specific amino acid changes, and a
number of studies have identified strong signatures of
adaptive evolution at these loci along the human lineage
[55-58]. Given the atavistic phenotype of primary microcephaly, it has been suggested that these genes may have
played a role in human encephalization.
An alternative approach has been to look at a gene's function based on model systems. Similar to ASPM and Microcephalin, the function of the neuropeptide PACAP in
regulating cortical neural progenitor proliferation, and
the identification of a highly accelerated evolutionary rate
in humans, has suggested a role in human encephalization [59]. Unlike the primary microcephaly genes, however, the evolutionary study of PACAP was prompted by
data from experiments in cell culture [60] and rat embryos
[61], rather than human disease. For the myosin heavy
chain gene MYH16, mutational analysis in the mouse
[62], and its expression pattern in the masticatory muscles
of the macaque monkey [63], prompted an investigation
into the potential role of this gene in the evolution of
human cranial muscle fibers. Comparative sequence analysis of MYH16 revealed a human-specific loss-of-function
mutation, dating back about 2.4 million years. This has
suggested a possible mechanism for the masticatory gracilization of the genus Homo during the Pleistocene [63].
Finally, in order to analyze the functional significance of
evolutionary changes in regulatory elements, gene expression profiles have been studied extensively. Most studies
to date have used microarray analysis, and the primary
focus has been on gene expression in the brain [64-66].

These studies have generally arrived at two important conclusions: First, gene expression in the brain has been significantly upregulated during human evolution; and
second, relatively few genes expressed in the brain show
significant divergence between human and chimpanzee,
compared to genes expressed in other tissues. A potential
complication in these studies, however, is the spurious
variation that is associated with analyses of tissue samples
from a relatively small number of individuals. Variations
in gene expression between individuals within a species,
as well as between different cell types within a tissue sample, are potentially problematic. Consequently, Karaman
et al. took an alternative approach, comparing patterns of
gene expression between humans and African great apes
in fibroblast cell lines, rather than tissue samples. Similar
to other studies, their findings also revealed species-specific gene expression profiles. Some of the functional categories overrepresented included genes involved in the
extracellular matrix, metabolic pathways, signal transduction, stress response, inherited overgrowth, and neurological disorders [67]. Alternatively, Popesco et al. used
Western blotting and immunofluorescence to study gene
expression profiles in human tissues, following a genomewide survey of gene duplications, in which they found
that the most striking human-specific amplification has
been in DUF1220 protein domains [68]. These domains
were shown to be highly expressed in regions of the brain
associated with higher cognitive function, and to have a
neuron-specific expression pattern in the brain.
Future prospects
Prompted by the technological and theoretical advances
of the molecular era, the use of comparative genomics in
the study of human brain evolution marks a true paradigm shift. This reductionist approach is allowing us to
reach unparalleled resolution, reframing our question in
reference to the very unit that evolution itself operates on.
A major limitation of the traditional approach, centered
primarily on comparative neural anatomy, has been that
important evolutionary changes are often difficult to
detect on the phenotypic level, given the immense complexity of a systems-wide phenotype. Thus, the subtle,
fine-scale anatomical differences between the human and
chimpanzee brains, which undoubtedly belie our significant behavioral differences, are almost entirely obscured
by the overwhelming similarity between them. Comparative genomics circumvents this problem, tackling the evolutionary novelty itself before it joins the massive network
of interdependent phenotypes, each no longer separable
from the rest.

But this approach is not without a price. Comparative
genomics may provide the necessary resolution for identifying DNA sequence differences between humans and
other species, but like any reductionist approach, ulti-

http://www.j-biomed-discovery.com/content/1/1/18

mately we'll need to figure out how all the individual
pieces fit together. In other words, how do we connect our
findings with concrete phenotypes relevant to the human
condition? Current efforts have mostly borrowed from the
wealth of information coming out of genetic studies of
human disease, mutational analysis of model organisms,
and gene expression profiles. These approaches, though
an essential starting point, can never be fully informative.
Relying on indirect inference, rather than experimental
validation, they still don't address the functional consequences of the specific evolutionary changes.
A true "bottoms-up" approach will require that we take
our findings from comparative genomics back to the laboratory. In vitro assays, and ultimately the introduction of
human transgenes into suitable model organisms, will be
essential for us to begin connecting evolutionary genotypic modifications to their resultant phenotypic consequences. This necessity poses a major challenge for a field
like comparative genomics, which inherently defines itself
by its high-throughput capabilities. Comparative genomics is in its infancy, and already we face an increasingly
narrower bottleneck, with continuous influx of data from
one end and only single-gene approaches on the other.
The next major challenge, therefore, will be to develop
high-throughout methods for functional analysis of comparative genomic data. Only then will we be able to begin
assembling a picture of how the varied multitude of
human-specific features all fit together in a unified system. This is clearly a daunting task. But if, like Karl Pribram, we dare ask the age-old question that has
preoccupied human imagination for millennia, then it
will come as no surprise that the answer is not easy to
come by.
