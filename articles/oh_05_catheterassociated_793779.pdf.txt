Abstract
Background: Rapidly growing mycobacteria is recognized as one of the causative agents of
catheter-related infections, especially in immunocompromised hosts. To date, however,
Mycobacterium senegalense, which was known as the principal pathogen of bovine farcy, has not
been reported in human infection.
Case presentation: We describe the first case of human infection by M. senegalense, which has
caused catheter-related bloodstream infection in a cancer patient in Korea. The microorganism
was identified by the 16S rRNA gene, rpoB, and 16S-23S rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer
(ITS) sequence analyses.
Conclusion: Our first report of catheter-associated bacteremia caused by M. senegalense suggests
the zoonotic nature of this species and indicates the expansion of mycobacterial species relating to
human infection. M. senegalense should be considered as one of the causes of human infections in
the clinical practice.

Background
Mycobacterium senegalense was originally described by
Chamoiseau in 1973 as a subspecies of Mycobacterium farcinogenes [1]. However, it was later recognized as a distinct
species closely related to M. fortuitum [2]. M. senegalense is
known as the principal pathogen of bovine farcy, which is
a chronic disease of skin and superficial lymphatics of cattle in East and Central Africa [3]. Unlike other rapidly

growing mycobacteria, human infection by M. senegalense
has not been reported to date. Here we report the first case
of central venous catheter (CVC) infection caused by M.
senegalense.

Case presentation
A 49-year-old woman with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
was admitted to the hospital because of fever for several

hours. The patient had been treated for lymphoma since 3
months ago. Five days before admission, the patient was
treated with the third cycle of CHOP plus rituximab (RCHOP). She had no history of travel or contact with animals including cows or their products. Physical examination revealed high fever of 39.8°C. The patient had a
subclavian cuffed-CVC(Hickman catheter) on the right
side with no evidence of the inflammation at the exit site.
Laboratory data and chest radiograph were within normal
limits. Three sets of blood samples for cultures were
drawn through CVC lines (2 sets) and a peripheral vein (1
set), respectively. The patient was treated empirically with
vancomycin (1 g every 12 h intravenously). On the second
hospital day, all 3 sets of blood cultures grew gram-positive, acid-fast bacilli. The cultures from the CVC became
positive more than 2 hours earlier than that from a
peripheral vein. Non-pigmented and pinpoint-shaped
colonies were observed on blood or chocolate agar plate
after 3 days of incubation at 37°C. It did not grow well on
McConkey agar plate. As it grows, the color of the colonies
becomes pale-yellow. Vancomycin was replaced by imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg every 6 h intravenously) and
amikacin (375 mg every 12 h intravenously). On the sixth
hospital day, the CVC was removed because of persistent
fever. After removal of CVC, the patient became afebrile
and the repeated blood cultures became negative. In vitro
susceptibility test was performed by broth microdilution
test as described by the National Committee for Clinical
Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) guidelines [4]. The result
of in vitro susceptibility test was shown in Table 1. The
isolates were susceptible to most antimicrobial agents
tested except vancomycin. The patient was further treated
with oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg every 12 hours) and doxycycline (100 mg every 12 hours) for 4 weeks. She had

Conventional automated methods in the clinical microbiology laboratory such as VITEK 2 system (bioMérieux,
Hazelwood, Mo.) failed to identify this isolate to a given
species. Thus, this isolate ("SMC-7485"), was subjected to
the 16S rRNA gene, rpoB, and 16S-23S rRNA gene internal
transcribe spacer (ITS) sequence analyses for bacterial
identification. Genomic DNA was extracted by using the
G-Spin Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (iNtRON, Seoul,
Korea). DNA amplification of 16S rRNA gene, rpoB, and
ITS were performed by using primer sets 16S-F3 (5'-CAG
GCC TAA CAC ATG CAA GT-3')/16S-R3 (5'-GGG CGG
WGT GTA CAA GGC-3'), MF (5'-CGA CCA CTT CGG CAA
CCG-3')/MR (5'-TCG ATC GGG CAC ATC CGG-3'), and
ITS-F (TTG TAC ACA CCG CCC GTC A-3')/ITS-R (5'-TCT
CGA TGC CCG GCA TCC ACC-3') [5-7], respectively.
Template DNA (ca. 50 ng) and 20 pmol of each primer
were added to a PCR mixture tube (AccuPower PCR
PreMix; Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea) containing 1 unit of Taq
DNA polymerase, each deoxynucleoside triphosphate at a
concentration of 250 µM, 10 mM Tric-HCl (pH 8.3), 10
mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and gel loading dye [8]. The
reaction mixture was then subjected to 35 cycles for
amplification. Each cycle consisted of 30 sec at 95°C for
denaturation, 30 sec at 60°C, and 1 min at 72°C for
extension, followed by final extension at 72°C for 5 min.
Amplified PCR product was purified for sequencing using
PCR purification kit (CoreOne, Seoul, Korea). The purified PCR product was sequenced directly using the same
primers of PCR amplification at both directions. Sequence
editing and analyses were performed with the EditSeq and
MegAlign programs in DNASTAR (Windows version
3.12e; Madison, Wis.). Determined sequence was compared with public database, GenBank, with the BLASTn
and
program
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast,
sequences showing high similarity were retrieved for further analysis.
16S rRNA gene sequence (1,393 bp) of the strain SMC7485 showed 100% similarities with those of Mycobacterium senegalense ATCC 35796 [GenBank: AF480596] and
Mycobacterium farcinogenes ATCC 35753 [GenBank:
AF055333]. It also showed very high similarities (99.5% –
99.7%) with those of Mycobacterium porcinum, Mycobacterium housetonense, Mycobacterium neworleansense, Mycobacterium
boenickei,
Mycobacterium
septicum,
and
Mycobacterium fortuitum. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis
suggested that the strain SMC-7485 belong to M. senegalense or M. farcinogenes of M. fortuitum group. However,
more decisive identification could not be available due to
no divergence of 16S rRNA gene sequence between two
species [9].

Phylogenetic relationships of SMC-7485 and other Mycobacterium species based on ITS sequences, which were retrieved from
GenBank database. This tree was generated by the neighbor-joining method. Mycobacterium vaccae DSM 43292 was used as an
outlier. Numbers at branching nodes are percentages of 1,000 bootstrap replications. Only values greater than 50% are shown.
In this tree, M. senegalense strains are separated into two subgroups.

To clarify identification of the strain SMC-7485, we analyzed rpoB and ITS sequences. rpoB gene sequence (301
bp) of SMC-7485 showed that it was the closest to M. senegalense ATCC 35796 [GenBank: AF057483], i.e. 99.7%
similarity. The species showing the next highest similarities were M. porcinum, Mycobacterium wolinskyi, Mycobacterium goodii, and M. septicum (96.9% – 99.0%). On the
other hand, rpoB gene sequence of M. farcinogenes DSM
43637 [GenBank: AY544910] was diverged from that of
SMC-7485 (94.7% similarity). ITS sequence (327 bp)
analysis also suggested that the strain SMC-7485
belonged to M. senegalense. The strain SMC-7485 showed
an identical ITS sequence with S. senegalense MF-417
[GenBank: AY684051]. In addition, ITS sequence of SMC7485 showed the similarities of more than 90% with
those of several M. senegalense strains deposited in GenBank database. Although ITS sequences of some M. senegalense strains such as ATCC 35796 and NCTC 10956
showed low similarities (80.9%) with that of SMC-7485,
they were clearly differentiated from M. farcinogenes and
other Mycobacterium species (Fig. 1). Based on 16S rRNA

gene, rpoB gene, and ITS sequences, we could identify
SMC-7485 as M. senegalense.
The nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA gene, rpoB, and
ITS of the strain SMC-7485 have been deposited in the
GenBank database under accession numbers DQ145802
to DQ145804.

Discussion
Rapidly growing mycobacteria such as the M. fortuitum
group, the M. chelonae/abscessus group, and the M. smegmatis group are capable of thriving in even the most hostile environments [10]. Due to their ubiquitous capability,
human infections by the rapidly growing mycobacteria
have been identified with increasing frequency worldwide. Especially, rapidly growing mycobacteria are being
recognized as one of the significant pathogens of catheterrelated infections in immunocompromised hosts. Among
rapidly growing mycobacteria, the M. fortuitum group is
the most common mycobacterial pathogen for this clinical condition [10,11].

The M. fortuitum group included M. fortuitum, M. peregrinum, M. mucogenicum, M. senegalense, M. mageritense, and
several newly described species such as M. septicum, M.
houstonense, M. boenickei, M. neworleansense, and M. brisbanense [12]. Of these, M. senegalense was originally
described by Chamoiseau in 1973 as a subspecies of M.
farcinogenes. Although M. farcinogenes and M. senegalense
have identical 16S rRNA gene sequences, M. senegalense
could be identified as a different species based on differences in growth rate, chemical activity and DNA homology [1,6,13,14]. While most species of M. fortuitum group
have been reported to be responsible for various human
diseases, human infection by M. senegalense has not been
described to date [3,10,12]. Instead, it causes the chronic
infectious disease of zebu cattle known as bovine farcy,
endemic to East and Central Africa [3,9]. Moreover, M.
senegalense, which was originally found in Africa, has
never been described elsewhere [3,10].

regimen has yet to be defined for catheter-related infection by these mycobacteria. In our experience, oral antibiotic therapy subsequent to a short course of intravenous
antibiotics seemed to be effective and safe. Although it
was not possible to determine the optimal duration of
antibiotic therapy in our case, this episode was successfully treated with short-term (approximately 5 weeks)
antibiotic therapy. Further studies will be required to confirm these findings.

Conclusion
In this paper, we firstly reported catheter-associated bacteremia by M. senegalense. This case suggested that M. senegalense can cause human infections. This pathogen
should be included in the list of nontuberculous mycobacteria causing human infections.

List of abbreviations
CVC – central venous catheter

In this report, we have first documented the CVC infection
caused by M. senegalense. Because conventional automated methods failed to identify it at the species level, we
tried to sequence 16S rRNA gene, rpoB gene, and ITS
region. By 16S rRNA gene, rpoB gene, and ITS sequence
analyses, we concluded that an agent of CVC infection in
our patient was M. senegalense. rpoB gene and ITS
sequences could differentiate M. senegalense from M. farcinogenes clearly as in previous reports [6,14]. Moreover,
ITS sequence analysis indicated that M. senegalense might
consist of at least two heterogeneous groups (Fig. 1).
There is possibility that M. senegalense isolate related to
human infection has been misidentified as different species because it is difficult to identify nontuberculous
mycobacteria (NTM) at the species level [9,16]. However,
the strain SMC-7485 is the first described M. senegalense
isolate, which is associated with human infection and is
found outside Africa, to our knowledge.
In most cases with mycobacterial infection of CVC, the
line should be removed for successful control of infection
[17]. In this study, the patient failed to respond to an initial regimen of imipenem and amikacin, to which the isolate was susceptible. Persistent infection was controlled
after removal of catheter, which emphasized the importance of catheter removal. Because of differences in susceptibilities among species and even within species, rapid
identification and subsequent susceptibility testing are
essential for selection of appropriate antibiotic agent(s)
against rapidly growing mycobacteria [18]. In this study,
the strain SMC-7485 was susceptible to amikacin, cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, doxycycline, and imipenem. Because of the high frequency of relapse and
resistance, combination therapy with multiple antibiotics
is usually recommended for serious infections by rapidly
growing mycobacteria. However, the optimal antibiotic
