Abstract
Background: Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are transcription factors that play a crucial role in response to
hypoxic stress in living organisms. The HIF pathway is activated by changes in cellular oxygen levels and has
significant impacts on the regulation of gene expression patterns in cancer cells. Identifying functional conservation
across species and discovering conserved regulatory motifs can facilitate the selection of reference species for
empirical tests. This paper describes a cross-species functional pathway mapping strategy based on evidence of
homologous relationships that employs matrix-based searching techniques for identifying transcription factorbinding sites on all retrieved HIF target genes.
Results: HIF-related orthologous and paralogous genes were mapped onto the conserved pathways to indicate
functional conservation across species. Quantitatively measured HIF pathways are depicted in order to illustrate the
extent of functional conservation. The results show that in spite of the evolutionary process of speciation, distantly
related species may exhibit functional conservation owing to conservative pathways. The novel terms OrthRate and
ParaRate are proposed to quantitatively indicate the flexibility of a homologous pathway and reveal the alternative
regulation of functional genes.
Conclusion: The developed functional pathway mapping strategy provides a bioinformatics approach for
constructing biological pathways by highlighting the homologous relationships between various model species.
The mapped HIF pathways were quantitatively illustrated and evaluated by statistically analyzing their conserved
transcription factor-binding elements.

Background
It is a challenge for aerobic life to maintain oxygen
homoeostasis due to environmental changes and energy
demands. In all metazoans hypoxia-inducible factors
(HIFs) are transcription factors (TFs) that play a central
role in adaptive processes in hypoxic cellular environments [1,2]. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric protein composed

hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) [3].
HIF-1a contains 4 functional domains including a basichelix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain for DNA binding [4,5],
a PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS) domain for dimerization, an
oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain for targeting proteosomes, and transactivation domains (NTAD and C-TAD) for transcriptional activation. HIF-1b
contains bHLH, PAS, and TADs. Under hypoxic conditions, accumulated HIF-1a translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and dimerizes with HIF-1b via the

bHLH and PAS domains to form the HIF-1 complex.
HIF-1a may recruit transcription co-activator P300/CBP
and bind to a hypoxia response element (HRE) in the
regulatory regions of hypoxia-inducible genes, thus mediating transcriptional activation. The consensus HRE
motif is a cis-regulatory element with a core segment of
5′RCGTG3′ (where R is A or G) [6] that governs the
transcription of HIF-responsive target genes in the
hypoxia-signaling pathway such as those encoding proteins involved in oxygen transport, iron metabolism, glucose transport, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion,
and metastasis [7,8]. Interestingly, the overexpression of
HIF-1a and activation of HIF pathways are observed in
tumor cells due to lack of HIF-a ubiquitination and
degradation in cancer patients. Hence, the inhibition of
HIF-1 expression or activity is an alternative strategy in
new cancer therapies [9].
A metabolic pathway represents a sequence of chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes; most metabolic
pathways retain the same functions in all growth stages
of living cells. A signal transduction pathway starts with
a signal to a receptor and ends with a change in cell
behavior [10]. Hence, signal transduction pathways are
implicated in different stages of dynamic transitions of a
network in living cells. Both metabolic and signal transduction pathways are important components of physiology and are regulated by diverse mechanisms [11]. The
HIF pathway is identified as a signal transduction pathway triggered due to low oxygen supply [12,13]. The
classical representation of a biological pathway provides
various associations among genes and proteins as well
as system-level insight to discover functional information through molecular interaction. During the last decade, an increasing number of pathway datasets has been
established in order to correlate functional interactions
within a network and elucidate regulatory mechanisms.
Hence, biological pathway analysis may facilitate the
design and development of biological experiments.
Based on the evolutionary conservation of genomes of
related organisms, the construction of a phylogeny,
known as phylogenomics, can be carried out. Accordingly, the validity of phylogenetic analysis provides evolutionary relationships among species [14]. Furthermore,
phylogenetic inferences can facilitate the understanding
of species derivation and the delineation of homologous
genes [15]. Random mutations accumulated over the
course of many generations may evolve homologous
genes that comprise 2 major categories: orthologous and
paralogous genes. The former evolves directly from an
ancestral gene through speciation events to daughter
species, and the latter diverges after gene duplication
events within a single species. Most orthologous genes
retain similar functions during the course of evolution,
while paralogous genes may gain new functions. The

history of orthologous genes reflects the development
track of diversified species [16]. Hence, functional divergence studies based on cross-species gene comparison
may facilitate the prediction of protein functions and
identification of horizontal gene transfer events [17].
Here, a methodology for mapping specific biological
pathways across several model species and discovering
conserved TF-binding motifs from related homologous
genes is established for conserved pathway analysis.
When a partial subset of the constructed pathway of the
target species disappears, it is possible to efficiently
replace the empty nodes by retrieving corresponding
paralogous genes possessing similar biological functions
[18].
To evaluate the importance of retrieved orthologous
and paralogous genes within the mapped functional HIF
pathways, a conventional strategy of searching conserved
transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) by matrixbased search on all retrieved HIF target genes was performed. For a selected homologous gene set, the
TRANSFAC database containing a comprehensive set of
TF-binding specificities summarized as position-specific
scoring matrices (PSSMs) was adopted to identify conserved motifs for transcriptional activities [19,20]. All
identified TFBSs from the retrieved homologous genes
within a functional pathway among various species are
statistically analyzed and ranked in priority order
according to the total number of species possessing
common motifs.

Results
Mapping HIF pathways among various species

Based on the evidence of evolutionary conservation in
genetic sequences and functions, it is reasonable to
assume that the functional pathways of a given species
could be mapped by cross-species inference. Orthologous
relationships among various species and paralogous
properties within an individual species were compared
using public data for Homo sapiens (HSA), Mus musculus
(MMU), Gallus gallus (GGA), Danio rerio (DRE), Xenopus tropicalis (XTR), and Ciona intestinalis (CIN).
Orthologous relationships show the conservation of
genes in a strong sense, which not only holds reservation
in species evolution but also reflects the importance of
functional pathways. Using human renal cell carcinoma
(KEGG pathway: hsa05211) as an example while focusing
on the HIF subpathway shown in Figure 1, a total of 14
genes are displayed in the rectangular boxes, which are
correlated with the HIF transcriptional complex and
respond to changes in cellular oxygen levels. It is also
reported that when the HIF system is activated, HIF
binds to the consensus HRE motifs present in the oxygen-regulated regions of HIF target genes such as Glut1,
VEGF, TGF-b, PDGF-b, and TGF-a. The total number

Figure 1 A mapped HIF functional pathway with zebrafish as the query species and humans as the reference species is shown. The initial HIF
pathway was acquired from the KEGG database, and the mapped functional pathway between zebrafish and humans was constructed on the
basis of the homologous relationship. The novel parameters OrthRate and ParaRate are proposed for indicating the degree of functional
conservation across species regarding a specific biological function. Higher ParaRates are shown within rectangular boxes with darker
backgrounds. The rectangular boxes with white background represent no orthologous relationship at the compared node between 2 species.

of orthologous and paralogous genes within HIF pathways in various species as well as the OrthRate and ParaRate parameters in comparison to H. sapiens were
accessed and calculated. Table 1 shows that the number
of orthologous genes (OrthNum) of HSA, MMU, GGA,
and DRE possess almost equivalent numbers of genes in
the HIF functional pathway. In contrast, both XTR and
CIN apparently possess less orthologous genes than the
other 4 species. This result implies that HSA, MMU,
GGA, and DRE might possess more similar mechanisms
to maintain HIF function than XTR and CIN. Hence,
functional similarity between 2 species can be easily
determined by the OrthRate index (defined in Methods)

The first column, Phylogeny, shows the evolutionary distance from HSA to the
other 5 model species. OrthNum represents the total number of genes
involved within the subpathway of HIF responses, and OrthRate represents
the functional conservation of the HIF pathway between 2 species (with HSA
as the reference species). ParaNum shows the total number of paralogous
genes involved within the subpathway of HIF responses, and ParaRate
represents the relative possibility of gene replacement within the HIF
functional pathway between 2 species (with HSA as the reference species).

by using 1 species as the reference model species. Based
on the high functional similarities shown in the mapped
biological pathways and OrthRate analysis between 2 species, the comparison strategy provides a tip for suggesting
suitable model organism candidates for subsequent in
vitro or in vivo experimental designs. In addition, a
mapped subpathway with genes maintaining biological
functions was constructed according to the characteristics of paralogous gene distribution. A biological network
with higher flexibility enhances survival rates when
patients with cancers are receiving clinical drug therapy,
which involves the activation of novel pathways to maintain normal physiological functions. Hence, the ParaRate
(defined in Methods) is applied to manifest the flexibility
and substitutional possibilities for target genes. From the
first column in Table 1, the phylogenetic distance relationship shows that DRE possesses a longer evolutionary
distance to HSA than XTR. Interestingly, DRE has a
higher ParaRate compared to XTR, suggesting a stronger
functional conservation of HIF pathways despite the evolutionary process of speciation. Quantitative evaluation of
the OrthRate and ParaRate parameters with respect to
HIF pathways among HSA and other model species are
not thoroughly consistent with the phylogenetic relationships. Therefore, based on the assumptions of functional
conservation for highly homologous genes across species,
we suggest that a quick analysis of mapped functional
pathways among various model species should be performed prior to biological experiments. Cross-species
functional analysis provides a good starting point to assist
model species selection and recommends accurate novel
paralogous genes in a flexible and alternative route for
further investigation.

Identification of HRE motifs in HIF target genes

Based on the retrieved HIF pathway of HSA from
KEGG (hsa05211), the HIF target genes (Glut1, VEGF,
TGF-b, PDGF-b, and TGF-a) and their corresponding
paralogous genes from other species were collected.
According to previous reports, functional HRE motifs
appearing within promoter regions of HIF target genes
were analyzed [6], and HREs within homologous genes
were identified using PSSM alignment. The exact core
segment and bilateral tolerant segments of HREs were
obtained and formulated as a novel matrix for motif
searching and evaluation. The newly created HRE transcription factor was named “V$HIF_STKE_2005” and
used for the identification of conserved TFBSs. The V

$HIF_STKE_2005 HRE patterns found in homologous
genes of vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFA_B, KEGG: Orthology K05448) from various species
(HSA: 3, MMU: 3, GGA: 1, DRE: 1, and CIN: 1) are
shown in Table 2. Only the top 3 matched HRE motifs
containing exactly matched core segments with corresponding locations are displayed in detail. The results
show that all the orthologous genes concerning the
VEGF node in the HIF pathways contain the important
TFBS for V$HIF_STKR_2005. Furthermore, all retrieved
paralogous genes indeed possess HRE motifs; these
paralogous genes might be considered as alternative HIF
target genes for DNA binding within the HIF functional
pathway. It should be noted that there might be many

The locations of HRE motifs were detected within the HIF orthologous genes for 6 model species (the PSSM pattern of V$HIF_STKR_2005 and the core segment

orthologous gene set of KEGG: Orthology K05448 (VEGFA_B); only the first 3 detected HREs are shown here. The Ensembl gene IDs are shown on the top of each

genes possessing similar HRE motif patterns. However,
genes lacking orthologous or paralogous relationships
were excluded in this study.
Paralogous and orthologous gene relationships between
2 species

The proposed methodology provides a new paradigm for
investigating functional diversification through mapped
biological pathways. A gene exhibits different biological
functions when it participates in different functional
pathways. In the example in Figure 1, each node in the
HIF pathway denotes the proportional number of paralogous genes and the orthologous property between the
reference species (HSA) and the query species (DRE).
Black background squares indicate that DRE might possess greater flexibility and the possibility of gene substitution than HSA. Gray background squares indicate
equivalent numbers of paralogous genes, while white
squares indicate that DRE does not possess any correlated orthologous gene in this pathway. When a specific
biological pathway is selected for a particular organism,
a mapped functional pathway based on the orthologous
relationship between the query and reference species is
constructed; each node in the pathway is displayed with
different shades of gray according to the ParaRate
values. Hence, the constructed pathways enhance the
visualization effects of the homology and functional conservation between 2 species. Although the biological
pathways predicted in silico under hypothetical assumptions may not be accurate, the mapped functional pathways based on cross-species comparison indeed provide
clues for explaining functional conservation and alternative solutions. At present, the functional pathway mapping analysis only focuses on 6 selected model species;
more model species will be gradually included for comprehensive analyses. In summary, the proposed methods
can systematically discover orthology at the level of biological pathways and not merely with individual genes.
In addition to genes, functional pathways are also conserved in general evolutionary processes. Analyzing the
conserved pathways through cross-species comparison
may help biologists to discover and distinguish the
diversity of functional pathways. The comparison results
may serve as a powerful tool for understanding physiological mechanisms in order to suggest better model
species for subsequent in vitro or in vivo experimental
designs.
Conserved transcription factor analysis for orthologous
and paralogous genes

To further verify the functional conservation of retrieved
homologous genes from various species, conserved
TFBSs in the promoter regions of homologous gene sets
were identified. The TRANSFAC library version 10.3

Page 5 of 9

was adopted for ordinary TFBS analysis. More than 800
TF-binding specificities (585 for vertebrate species) are
summarized as PSSMs for TFBS findings. Users can
select corresponding TF-binding motif patterns or
define customized PSSM patterns to verify common
transcription elements. Two examples of HIF orthologous and paralogous gene sets compared to randomly
selected gene sets are shown in Tables 3 and 4. For
comparison, 3 known HIF-related TFBSs from TRANSFAC and 1 customized V$HIF_STKE_2005 pattern were
assigned to identify the conservation status of the target
gene set. In the upper half of Table 3, orthologous
genes were obtained from 6 model species at the
“VEGF” node within the HIF pathway (KEGG: Orthology K05448). Each cell in the table shows the numbers
of TFBSs retrieved by setting 3 different cut-off values:
0.85, 0.80, and 0.75. For example, the V$AHRHIF_Q6
motif for HSA is 5/5/29, indicating that the numbers of
V$AHRHIF_Q6 motifs identified within the promoter
region of the VEGF gene of HSA are 5, 5, and 29 by setting cut-off values of 0.85, 0.80, and 0.75, respectively. In
lower half of Table 3, a gene set without an orthologous
relationship was randomly selected from 6 species. The
rightmost columns of Table 3 reveal that when cut-off
values are low, the numbers of identified HIF TFBSs
and conserved species both increase. It should be noted
that the orthologous gene set possessed a greater number of conserved transcription elements than a randomly
selected gene set, even when the cut-off value was as
low as 0.75. In Table 4, the functional conservation of a
paralogous gene set was also evaluated by comparing
the number of conserved TF-binding motifs for both
the paralogous gene set and a randomly selected gene
set from an identical species. The paralogous gene set
was obtained from the VEGF node within the HIF pathway of DRE, and the assigned PSSM patterns were the
same as those of the previous example in Table 3. It is
also noticeable that the number of identified conserved
HIF TFBSs from the paralogous gene set is also greater
than that of the randomly selected gene set. The results
of both illustrated examples are consistent with the
assumptions that homologous genes possess greater
functional similarities. The identification of conserved
TFBSs regarding a specific biological pathway can be
further applied for determining functional conservation
among various species.

Discussion
To understand the mechanism behind hypoxia signal
transduction, the HIF pathway from KEGG was initially
extracted and analyzed. By calculating a newly defined
ParaRate, the proposed methodology can discover alternative solutions that may possess high possibilities of
replacing original genes at each node within a pathway

Comparison of TFBS conservation of the HIF orthologous gene set and a randomly selected gene set with 3 different cut-off values. (Upper half) The orthologous
genes were obtained from 6 model species at the “VEGF” node within the HIF pathway (KEGG: Orthology K05448). These genes include ENSG00000119630 (HSA),
ENSMUSG00000004791 (MMU), ENSGALG00000010290 (GGA), ENSCING00000014020 (CIN), ENSDARG00000034700 (DRE), and ENSXETG00000016375 (XTR). Three
HIF-related TFBSs selected from the TRANSFAC library (V$HIF1_Q3, V$HIF1_Q5, and V$AHRHIF1_Q6) and 1 customized HRE motif (V$HIF_STKE_2005) were
employed for scanning through all of the selected genes. Each cell in the table represents the numbers of retrieved TFBSs using 3 different cut-off values of 0.85,
0.80, and 0.75. For example, the V$AHRHIF_Q6 for HSA is 5/5/29, which represents the total number of V$AHRHIF_Q6 motifs that can be identified within the
promoter region of the Homo sapiens VEGF gene by setting cut-off values at 0.85, 0.80, and 0.75. (Lower half) A set of genes without an orthologous relationship,
randomly selected from 6 species. These genes include ENSG00000001460 (HSA), ENSMUSG00000073489 (MMU), ENSGALG00000000002 (GGA),
ENSCING00000002344 (CIN), ENSDARG00000000086 (DRE), and ENSXETG00000016375 (XTR). Regarding the HIF function, most of the orthologous genes from
various species indeed contain HIF TFBSs; however, they are sparsely distributed within the randomly selected genes. The rightmost columns also reflect the fact
that the total number of species possessing identical HIF TFBSs is relatively higher within the orthologous gene set, since they are expected to retain HIF
functional characteristics through the evolutionary process of speciation. HSA, H. sapiens; MMU, M. musculus; GGA, G. gallus; DRE, D. rerio; XTR, X. tropicalis; CIN, C.

Comparison of TFBS conservation of the HIF paralogous gene set and a randomly selected gene set from the zebrafish (DTR) with 3 different cut-off values.
(Upper half) The paralogous genes were obtained from the “VEGF” node within the HIF pathway. These genes include ENSDARG00000034700 (KEGG: dre30682),
ENSDARG00000069640 (KEGG: dre403049), and ENSDARG00000056624 (KEGG: dre678512). The selected HIF TFBS patterns are the same as those in Table 3. Each
cell in the table represents the number of retrieved TFBSs using 3 different cut-off values of 0.85, 0.80, and 0.75. For example, the V$AHRHIF_Q6 for the first DTR
gene (ENSDARG00000034700) is 3/3/21 which represents the total number of V$AHRHIF_Q6 motifs can be identified within the promoter region (2,000 base
pairs) of the Danio rerio VEGF gene by setting cut-off values of 0.85, 0.80, and 0.75. (Lower half) A set of genes without a paralogous relationship, randomly
selected from zebrafish. These genes include ENSDARG00000040535 (G1), ENSDARG00000068465 (G2), and ENSDARG00000010610 (G3). Regarding the HIF
function, most of the paralogous genes from a given node in the HIF functional pathway contain the corresponding HIF TFBSs but appeared less frequently in
the randomly selected genes. The rightmost columns also reflect the tendency that the total number of gene possessing identical HIF TFBSs is relatively higher
within the paralogous gene set since they might retain HIF functional characteristics through the evolutionary process of gene duplication.

without losing biological function. According to the
obtained OrthRate percentages, the system derives similar gene clusters through cross-species comparison and
predicts the functional pathway for the query species.
Comparing paralogous genes obtained from a set of target genes facilitates the discovery of probable substitute
genes with respect to a specific biological pathway.
Accordingly, it is possible to construct a novel functional subpathway with respect to these identified alternative selections. When studying a functional pathway,
combinatorial regulation by transcription factors and
genes need to be analyzed and discussed simultaneously
based on an assumption that the genes within the same
pathway can be controlled by common regulators.
Hence, a set of genes from the mapped functional pathway can be verified by focusing on the identification of
common transcription factor-binding motifs.

Conclusion
We propose a strategy for mapping functional pathways
among various species that allows the retrieved orthologous and paralogous genes to be further verified by
identifying common TF-binding motifs. Six model species including H. sapiens (HSA), M. musculus (MMU),
G. gallus (GGA), D. rerio (DRE), X. tropicalis (XTR),
and C. intestinalis (CIN) were used for cross-species
comparison. The novel terms OrthRate and ParaRate of
the mapped functional pathways were defined to quantitatively indicate the conservation and flexibility of
homologous pathways. These calculated values can be
applied to enhance the alternative selection of functional
genes. To verify the gene replaceability within the
inferred pathway through in silico analysis, a conventional strategy was executed by searching for TFBSs on
all retrieved homologous genes. Here, the TRANSFAC
database was adopted for discovering all conserved transcription elements based on the summarized PSSMs.
From the cross-species analysis of mapped HIF pathways, 4 species (HSA, MMU, GGA, and DRE) possess
highly similar mechanisms for maintaining HIF function
compared to XTR and CIN. Furthermore, the corresponding TFBS analyses were evaluated with consistent
performance.
Methods
The initial pathway information was acquired from
KEGG, a knowledge database for the systematic analysis
of gene functions, to link genomic information with
higher-order functional information [21,22]. Each map
or pathway in KEGG was categorized into an existing
taxonomy according to its function, and each pathway
was supplemented with a set of orthologously grouped
tables for cross-species information with respect to conserved pathways. The orthologous table summarizes

Page 7 of 9

functional correlations in the pathway, physical correlations in genomes, and evolutionary relationships among
species. It provides useful information as a reference
dataset for functional annotations. Using the HIF pathway as an example, if the user enters the keywords
“hypoxia-inducible factor” into the main interface of
KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html), the
system responds with only 1 entry: map05211. In addition to the searched pathways, users can adopt orthologous information from the KEGG and/or Ensembl
databases. In particular, orthologous genes identified in
KEGG are not only obtained by evaluating sequence
similarity, but also by determining if all constituent
members are verified within a functional group, such as
a conserved subpathway or a molecular complex. The
variations of derived datasets from these 2 resources
provide hints for possible modifications of an accurate
pathway.
Quantitative measurement of functional pathways

To compare the expression level of orthologous gene
clusters in pathways against others by utilizing a quantitative measure, it is necessary to represent those associated genes as mathematical objects and provide
measurable indices for effective representation. Here, we
define 2 types of homologous rate, OrthRate and ParaRate, which can quantitatively suggest alternative functional genes. OrthRate is defined as the total number of
corresponding orthologous genes within a specified
pathway from the query species divided by the total
number of associated genes within the identical pathway
from the reference species. OrthRate indicates the proportional percentage of corresponding genes within
cross-species biological pathways. ParaRate is similarly
defined as the total number of corresponding paralogous
genes within a specified pathway from the query species
divided by the total number of associated genes within
the identical pathway from the reference species. ParaRate is considered as a replacement ratio of duplicated
genes with respect to a specified biological function.
According to statistical results, the system can be
expected to retrieve possible missing subpathways
within an individual species and predict extra direct
and/or indirect pathways within each species. To
demonstrate the functional conservation and alternative
selection of genes among various species, 6 remote
model species including C. intestinalis (CIN), X. tropicalis (XTR), G. gallus (GGA), M. musculus (MMU), D.
rerio (DRE), and H. sapiens (HSA) were initially considered for orthologous analysis in this study. Users are
required to define both the query and reference species
in advance. The quantitative measurement of functional
pathways can then be obtained by taking the total number of homologous genes within the pathway of the

Chuang et al. BMC Systems Biology 2011, 5(Suppl 1):S3
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/5/S1/S3

reference species as the denominator and the total number of homologous genes of the query species as the
numerator. In this study, both the numbers of orthologous and paralogous genes were obtained from the
KEGG database.
Identification of HRE motifs

To demonstrate the validity of in silico pathways in the
biological sense, the existence of TFBSs within HIF target genes were considered as the verification criterion.
HIFs bind target genes at the functional hypoxia
response elements (HREs). An overview of the known
target genes of HIF reveals that the length of a HRE is
nearly 18 base pairs. The mandatory core HRE sequence
is “CGTG”—the minimal DNA motif required for interaction with HIFs. The appearance frequency of HREs
located within the flanking sequence is randomly distributed as reported previously [6]. To perform alignment and identify whether the HREs are located within
the paralogous genes, we created a position-specific
scoring matrix (PSSM) to extract all HRE candidates
from retrieved HIF target genes. The PSSM matching
mechanism scans through a DNA sequence with a fixed
length and identifies the most probable motifs according
to the calculated scores and sum of position-specific
scores for each symbol in the verified substring [23,24].
The score value of each substring was obtained by summarizing the corresponding scores of PSSM to the jth
substring S j within the DNA sequence, and the value
was calculated as T j =

∑

N
i =1

PSi ,t , where i represents

the position in the substring, Si is the nucleotide symbol
at position i in the substring, and pk,i is the score values
in row k, column i of the PSSM matrix of a specific TFbinding pattern P. The PSSM profile of the HRE patterns for HIF target genes was generated according to
the published paper by R. H. Wenger et al. [6] and was
called the pattern matrix of V$HIF_STKE_2005. The
HRE motif searching mechanism allowed us to verify
the functional conservation of HIF responses within the
retrieved homologous gene set.
Identification of common transcription factors

The identification of common TFBSs is an in silico analysis for ensuring that the target genes possess identical
biological functions [25] under the assumption that a
homologous gene set within the same pathway can be
controlled by common regulators. Therefore, we
employed the TRANSFAC database for identifying the
common TFBSs of a specified HIF target gene set. The
TRANSFAC library version 10.3 is a comprehensive set
of more than 800 TF-binding specificities (585 for vertebrate species), which was adopted and summarized as

Page 8 of 9

PSSMs to search transcription elements. The default
PSSM cut-off value of each TF-binding pattern is set as
0.85 for examining all substrings from the selected candidate genes; the common TFBSs identified for all
selected homologous genes are displayed in priority
order according to the appearance pervasiveness and
frequency among the defined gene set. In the developed
system for conserved TFBS analysis, users are allowed
to select limited TFBSs through keyword filtering functions, and the selected PSSM can be from either the
TRANSFAC library or user defined matrices. In particular, 3 HIF-related PSSM matrices, including V$HIF_Q3,
V$HIF_Q5, and V$AHRHIF_Q6, were assigned along
with the customized factor V$HIF_STKE_2005 for analyzing the orthologous and paralogous gene sets within
the HIF pathway.
