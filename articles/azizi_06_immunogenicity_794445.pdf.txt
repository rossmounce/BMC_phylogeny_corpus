Abstract
Background: One of the major obstacles in the design of an effective vaccine against HIV-1 is the
hypervariability of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. Most HIV-1 vaccine candidates have utilized
envelope glycoprotein from a single virus isolate, but to date, none of them elicited broadly reactive
humoral immunity. Herein, we hypothesised that a cocktail of HIV-1 gp120 proteins containing
multiple epitopes may increase the breadth of immune responses against HIV-1. We compared and
evaluated the immunogenicity of HIV-1 vaccines containing either gp120 protein alone or in
combinations of four or fourteen gp120s from different primary HIV-1 isolates in immunized
hamsters.
Results: We amplified and characterized 14 different gp120s from primary subtype B isolates with
both syncytium and non-syncytium inducing properties, and expressed the proteins in Chinese
Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines. Purified proteins were used either alone or in combinations of
four or fourteen different gp120s to vaccinate golden hamsters. The polyvalent vaccine showed
higher antibody titers to HIV-1 subtype B isolates MN and SF162 compared to the groups that
received one or four gp120 proteins. However, the polyvalent vaccine was not able to show higher
neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 primary isolates. Interestingly, the polyvalent vaccine
group had the highest proliferative immune responses and showed a substantial proportion of
cross-subtype CD4 reactivity to HIV-1 subtypes B, C, and A/E
Conclusion: Although the polyvalent approach achieved only a modest increase in the breadth of
humoral and cellular immunity, the qualitative change in the vaccine (14 vs. 1 gp120) resulted in a
quantitative improvement in vaccine-induced immunity.

Background
HIV-1 gp120 is a major target for neutralizing antibodies
(Nabs) and for this reason it is an important HIV immu-

nogen to include in vaccine formulations [1-3]. However,
the diversity of gp120 has proven to be a significant challenge to HIV-1 vaccine development. The structure of

gp120 contains variable loops (V1-V5) which likely hide
critical conserved epitope sites favoured by the Nabs. Furthermore, the crystallography structure of gp120 indicates
that the protein is covered by carbohydrates which facilitates viral escape from Nabs [4,5]. Genetic variability in
HIV-gp120 between groups M, N and O also affect the
induction of Nabs [6,7]. These factors complicate the
design of an effective candidate vaccine against HIV.
Previous vaccine studies focus on single HIV immunogens
and although some of these studies show an increase in
CD4/CD8+T cell immune responses, the immunogens
used were not able to induce potent Nabs that mediate
sterilizing immunity [8,9]. The question remains: "can a
single immunogen induce a broad immune response
against a diverse virus like HIV". To address this, several
studies have been performed. A single and double recombinant HIV-1 gp120 protein has been used as a candidate
immunogen in a phase III clinical vaccine trial. However,
this vaccination was not effective to protect against HIV
infection [10-12]. This lack of vaccine efficacy may be due
to HIV diversity. While some single immunogens neutralize a few T-cell line adapted (TCLA) HIV-1 strains, none of
the animal model or clinical studies demonstrated a
broadly cross-reactive immunity against HIV-1 primary
isolates [13]. Some studies demonstrated neutralizing
antibody responses against HIV-1 primary isolates, however no measure of cross-reactivity was obtained as the
strains of HIV virus used in the Nab assay, contained the
same HIV-1 gp120 as that used for vaccination.
HIV-1 subtype B is widely distributed throughout the
world and is the most common subtype in North America
and Europe [14,15]. Herein, we hypothesised that immunization with several (fourteen) different wild type HIV-1
gp120 subtype B proteins would increase the breadth of
specific antiviral immune responses. Fourteen wild type
HIV-1 gp120 subtypes B were amplified, cloned and the
recombinant gp120 proteins were expressed in mammalian cell lines. Golden hamsters were immunized with
equivalent amounts of 1 vs. 4 vs. 14 distinct gp120 proteins and humoral (antibody binding and neutralization)
and cellular (T helper cells) responses to HIV-1 subtypes
B, C and A/E were analyzed. Although this polyvalent
approach achieved only a modest increase in the breadth
of humoral and cellular immunity; the qualitative change
in the vaccine (14 vs. 1 gp120, same amount of total antigen) resulted in a quantitative improvement in vaccineinduced immunity.

Results
Characterization and expression of HIV-1 gp120s
Total RNA was purified from syncytium and non-syncytium inducing co-cultures of 14 HIV-1 patients (Table 1).
Amplification products corresponding to the full length of

gp120 (1.6 kb) containing constant and hypervariable
regions were generated by RT-PCR. The genes were completely sequenced and identified as subtype B. The V3
amino acid sequence of the amplified gp120s was compared with V3 subtypes B, C and A/E, point mutations as
well as insertion and deletion mutations were detected
(Fig 1). In addition, the phylogenetic relations between
the 14 different gp120 sequences and HIV subtypes B, C
and A/E were revealed and genetic diversity between
clones was identified (Fig 2). Due to the limited number
of nucleotides in the V3 region, the algorithm is applied
to a longitudinal data set of the C2-V5 regions of HIV-1
gp120s using Neighbor Tree-Maker in the FASTA format.
By this approach, epidemiological linkage was established
between the HIV-1 gp120 clones and HIV-1 subtypes B, C
and A/E. Most of the HIV-1 gp120 sequences were clustered from the HIV-1 subtype B isolate MN. This isolate
was epidemiologically linked to the subtype A/E isolate
93TH975. The results revealed no particular homology
between gp120 clones and HIV-1 subtype C isolate
96ZM651. Each gp120 variant was cloned into the pEF6myc-His vector for the expression and purification of
recombinant gp120 proteins in vitro. Stable CHO cell lines
transfected with the gp120 constructs selected for using
blasticidine resistance and recombinant gp120 proteins
were purified by metal affinity chromatography. The
expression of all recombinant HIV-1 gp120 proteins has
been determined by western blotting (Fig 3).
Immunization schedule
Four groups of hamsters were immunized with different
vaccine formulations as indicated in Table 2. In the first
group (A), hamsters were immunized with MPL adjuvant
alone. In the second group (B), hamsters were immunized
with 100 µg of the recombinant gp120 protein purified
from patient number 001 plus adjuvant. Hamsters in the

third group (C) were immunized with a mixture of proteins purified from patients #001 to #004 (25 µg of each
recombinant gp120 protein) and adjuvant. The polyvalent group (D) immunized with a cocktail of all 14 proteins (~7 µg of each recombinant gp120 protein).
Hamsters were immunized subcutaneously (S.C.) on
weeks 0, 4, and 8. Animals were rested for 8 weeks and
then boosted at week 16 with the same combination of
gp120 proteins. Antibody titers were determined two
weeks after each immunization.
The polyvalent candidate vaccine induces higher antibody
titers against HIV-1 subtype B than other subtypes
In order to measure antibody titers against various HIV-1
gp120 proteins, plasma from immunized hamsters was
collected two weeks after each immunization and analyzed by ELISA. The plates were coated with HIV-1 gp120
subtypes B (MN and SF162), C (96ZM651), and A/E
(93TH975) overnight at 4°C followed by incubation with
serially diluted plasma and developed as described in the
Materials and Method section. The first two immunizations elicited a low level of antibody response to gp120
proteins (data not shown). However, after the third
immunization, antibodies were detectable in all groups
immunized with gp120. As expected the control group

did not produce an antibody response. The highest level
of antibody titer was observed in hamsters that were
immunized with 14 recombinant gp120 proteins. In contrast, the control group (adjuvant alone) did not develop
detectable levels of specific antibody responses. Eight
weeks after the third immunization, animals were vaccinated again with respective recombinant gp120 proteins.
Results similar to the third immunization were observed
against gp120 subtypes between the groups. The polyvalent vaccine group induced higher levels of anti-gp120 titers to MN and SF162 (subtypes B) than the subtypes C
and A/E (Fig 4). These results demonstrate that the polyvalent vaccine induces a higher antibody response to subtype B than the single gp120 candidate vaccine.
Measurement of neutralizing antibody responses in
immunized hamsters
Two weeks after the fourth immunization, sera were collected and Nabs to HIV-1 strains were tested. Unlike many
research studies, to detect the real breadth and strength of
candidate vaccines, we used different HIV-1 strains, to
assay for Nabs, from those, which were used in immunization. Since some background was observed in the prebleed samples, the Nab responses were compared with
SVA-MLV (murine retrovirus Env-pseudovirus) as a back-

ground control for non-specific activity. The group of
hamsters that received all 14 gp120 proteins showed
higher Nabs titres to the HIV-1 MN strain than the single
gp120 (p < 0.05), however, similar Nabs titres were
observed in the group immunized with a combination of
four gp120 proteins (Fig 5). Sera from immunized hamsters were further tested against other primary HIV-1 isolates but none of the sera were able to show significant
neutralization.
The polyvalent gp120 vaccine induced higher T cell
proliferation in immunized hamsters
The proliferation of CD4+T cells plays an important role
in both humoral and cellular immune responses by
expansion of antigen-stimulated B and CD8+T cells,
respectively. A high proliferative immune response was
observed to the gp120 protein isolated from patient #001
in all groups with the exception of the control group (data
not shown). However, to assess and measure the strength
of the candidate vaccines, splenocytes from immunized
hamsters were further stimulated with HIV-1 gp120

strains and subtypes that were not included in the vaccine
components. Splenocytes were cultured in the presence of
HIV-1 gp120 proteins. Two days after stimulation, [3H]
thymidine was added and sixteen hours later, cells were
harvested and thymidine incorporation was measured.
The groups B and C showed a relatively similar proliferative immune response. Interestingly, the group of hamsters that was immunized with all 14 gp120 proteins
showed the highest lymphocyte proliferative immune
response (Fig 6) to subtypes B (MN and SF162), C
(96ZM651) and A/E (93TH975), supporting the crosssubtype activity of Th immune responses.

Discussions and Conclusion
The antigenic variation of HIV-1 gp120 is a major obstacle
for the development of an effective vaccine [16-18]. Nabs
are mainly directed against the V3 region of gp120 which
plays an important function in the binding of virus to
either CCR5 or CXCR4 [19]. However, antigenic hypervariability of V1-V5 regions especially V3 assists the virus in
escaping neutralization [20-24]. Interestingly, a single

mutation in the V3 region, could change R5 virus into an
X4 virus [25,26].
It has been shown that mono-or bi-valent HIV-1 envelope
vaccines are poorly immunogenic and induce a limited
breadth of reactivity. Although Nabs have been shown to
control some laboratory-adapted strains, these results
cannot easily be extended to primary clinical HIV-1 isolates. In addition, induced Nabs from single HIV-1 envelope studies lacked cross-subtype neutralizing activity and
could not neutralize other strains of HIV except the strain
contained in the vaccine preparation [27-30]. In an interesting study, Zhan et al., showed that cocktail of 50 HIV1 envelope in the context of DNA vector, recombinant
vaccinia vector and recombinant proteins is able to induce
both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in
immunized macaques. Vaccinated macaques showed
lower virus titers and higher amount of CD4+T cells compared to unvaccinated animals after challenge with
SHIV89.6P. In addition, four out of six vaccinated
macaques survived 44 week after the virus challenge, suggesting that a multi-envelope vaccine may be an effective
approach to control HIV-1 infection [33].
To increase the breadth of the immune response against
HIV-1 strains, ten HIV-1 strains that had a non-syncytiuminducing phenotype and four that had a syncytium-inducing phenotype were selected from a bank of clinical isolates. Although 14 gp120 proteins may not maximize the
immune response and may not represent all subtype B
isolates; these results my provide clues regarding the

capacity of heterologous HIV-1 subtype strains to induce
antiviral immune responses that recognize other HIV-1
subtypes. The multivalent approach to increase the breath
of the immune response against heterologous strains
within a subtype could provide for enhanced vaccine protection within a geographic region.
Sequence analysis from the structure of gp120s revealed
that despite vivid antigenic differences between R5 and X4
isolates, the structure of their gp120 core is similar. The
sequences of the HIV-1 strains were analyzed by multiple
sequences ClustalW alignment program and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Neighbor Tree-Maker.
The evolutionary history of the cohort gp120 clones was
compared to other HIV-1 strains from the same HIV-1
subtype or different subtype. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that all gp120 clones were derived from subtype B.
Gp120 proteins were expressed in the CHO cells to produce a glycosylation pattern similar to the one observed in
the native structural form of gp120 found on the virus

envelope. Gp120 proteins were poorly expressed in transiently transfected CHO cells. To solve this problem, stable CHO cell lines were created. The production of gp120
proteins were increased more than 20-fold in the stable
cell lines, allowing for efficient protein purification.
It may be possible that a cocktail of HIV-1 gp120 proteins
containing multiple epitopes will be able to maximize the
breadth of immune response against HIV-1 compared to
a single immunogen. In a recent study, several macaques
were primed by DNA encoding gp120 from subtypes A, B,
and C and boosted with recombinant gp120 proteins.
Although strong cell-mediated immune responses were
induced, a potent neutralizing antibody response was not

detected in animals [32]. So far, limited polyvalent vaccine studies have been performed and none have measured immune responses against diverse HIV strains. On
the other hand, an effective HIV vaccine may have to deal
with not only multiple subtypes but with many strains in
each subtype. It is interesting to note that the surface envelope in each HIV subtype has featured differences. For
instance, HIV-1 subtype C has enormous genetic differences compared with the recombinant subtypes A/C. The
question arises whether HIV-1 immunogens from one
subtype will be effective against other subtype. Leandersson et al., showed T-cell reactivity between gp160 immunogen subtype B with other subtypes in HIV individuals
[33]. However, they did not detect the neutralizing cross-

reactivity between HIV-1 subtypes. Another concern in a
polyvalent vaccine approach is that there are no studies
regarding the synergistic or antagonistic effects of gp120
genes. It is possible that protein components in a polyvalent vaccine cocktail interact and compete with each other
and consequently may inhibit or downgrade the response
to some proteins.
Due to high background in mice sera, we were not able to
measure the neutralizing antibody responses in our previous vaccine studies, thus, golden hamsters were considered for measurement of the efficacy of humoral immune
responses. CD8+T cell immune response was not studied
due to non-existent labelled antibodies to hamster CD3
and CD8. In order to analyze the binding antibody titre,
plasma from immunized hamsters was collected and HIV1 gp120 subtypes B (MN, SF162), C (96ZM651) and A/E
(93TH975) were analyzed separately by ELISA. Group D,
which received all fourteen proteins, showed higher mean
IgG antibody titer to HIV-1 subtype B isolates MN and
SF162 in comparison to groups B and C. While results
from binding assays do not predict neutralization serotypes, they suggest that antigenic subtypes may be related,
but not identical, to the genetic subtypes. Theoretically, an
augmented number and amount of envelope proteins
may enhance the control of viremia following HIV-1
infection through a number of immunologic mechanisms, including increasing the functional activity of B

In this study, the candidate vaccines were able to neutralize only the HIV-1 strain MN and not any other HIV-1
subtypes. Interestingly, the immunized group with fourteen-gp120 proteins subtype B induced a response similar
to the group that received four gp120 proteins. Therefore,
it will be useful to evaluate the immunogenicity of each
gp120 and interaction with any other gp120 protein in a
non-human primate model. These results are similar to a
previously published polyvalent study where the neutralization was restricted to the virus strains used for vaccination and the polyvalent vaccine was not able to neutralize
any primary HIV-1 isolates [34]. Lack of cross reactivity
between Nab results were also consistent to a recent study
by Cavacini et al., demonstrating no quantified cross-subtype antibody reactivity and neutralization between subtype B sera against subtype C HIV virus [35]. In another
study, Wang et al. showed that a polyvalent HIV-1 envelope protein approach is not able to induce neutralizing
antibody responses against HIV-1. However, a polyvalent
HIV-1 envelope approach in the context of DNA priming
followed by protein boosting may be able to neutralize
some of HIV-1 strains from different subtypes [36].
HIV-1 patients are faced with low number of CD4+Th
cells in different stages of disease. An inverse correlation
between gag-specific Th cells and HIV-1 RNA plasma virus
load has been shown. The strongest gag specific proliferative responses were associated with lower viral load, while
a high viral load was observed with weak response to gag
stimulation [37]. Here, lymphocyte proliferation assay
was tested to determine activation of lymphocytes after
encountering with HIV-1 gp120 proteins from different
subtypes. A relatively high proliferative immune response
was determined to subtypes B, C and A/E in the group of
hamster that immunized with fourteen gp120 proteins
subtype B. This group developed stimulation indices four
fold or more above baseline against all subtypes. These
results were in consistent with Currier JR et al. that
showed a comprehensive cross-subtype reactivity of cellmediated immune responses between individuals with
different HIV-1 subtypes [38]. In summary, the polyvalent
gp120 candidate vaccine derived from subtype B was not
able to neutralize primary HIV-1 isolates. However, a substantial proportion of cross-subtype CD4 reactivity was
observed between the polyvalent group with HIV-1 subtypes B, C, and A/E.

T-cell proliferation results in hamsters immunized with the candidate HIV-1 gp120 vaccines
T-cell proliferation results in hamsters immunized with the candidate HIV-1 gp120 vaccines. Splenocytes were cultured and
stimulated with 10 µg/ml proteins of (6A): HIV-1 gp120 subtype B (MN strain), (6B): HIV-1 gp120 subtype B (SF162 strain),
(6C): HIV-1 gp120 subtype C (96ZM651 strain), and (6D): HIV-1 gp120 subtype A/E (93TH975 strain). Two days later, 3H-thymidine was added and after 18 h the incorporated radioactivity was measured in harvested splenocytes. The stimulation index
(SI) ± S.E. is shown for each group. Symbol * indicates a significant difference between group D with groups B and C (p ≤ 0.05).

ipation in the study. Briefly, isolation of virus was performed by placing 2–4 × 106 peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM: Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS: Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY), 2 Mm Glutamine (Sigma) and 50 µg/
ml gentamicine (Sigma) with an equal number of phytohemagglutinin (PHA: Sigma) stimulated donor cells. The
cells were incubated at 37°C containing 5% CO2 and 20
IU/ml Interleukin-2 (IL-2: R&D systems, Minneapolis,
MN) was added to increase the growth of these cells. Cocultures were maintained for up to 4 weeks with periodic
media changes. 2 × 106 freshly stimulated donor cells were
added every 10 days to sustain HIV replication. Viruses
were measured in the supernatant by HIV p24 antigen kit
(DuPont, Wilmington, DE).
Amplification and cloning of HIV-1 gp120 genes into pEF6myc-His vectors
Total RNA was purified using RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON) from syncytium and non-syncytium inducing HIV-1 subtype B co-cultures. The encoding

gp120 sequences (1.6 kb) were amplified by RT-PCR. The
amplicons were purified using the QIAquick gel extraction
kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON) and cloned into the PCR
2.1 TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON). After
plasmid digestion, the 1.6 kb band corresponding to the
gp120 genes were sub-cloned into the pEF6-myc-His vectors (Invitrogen) which is designed for the over-production of recombinant proteins in mammalian cell lines. In
this system, recombinant proteins may be purified by
affinity chromatography using the c-myc epitope or poly
histidine (6 × His) metal-binding tags. The expression
constructs were confirmed and characterized by restriction enzymes and nucleotide sequence analysis.
Characterization of amplified gp120s
All fourteen HIV-1 gp120-V3 regions were aligned using
"ClustalW" which is a multiple sequence alignment program for DNA or proteins [39,40]. At the end, the
sequences were also manually adjusted. The phylogenetic
tree was constructed by the Neighbor Tree-Maker in HIV
sequence database. The program converts sequences
alignment to the FASTA format.

Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) culture
CHO cells were grown at 37°C, 5% CO2 in IMDM
(Sigma) supplemented with 10% FCS (Life Technologies), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml gentamicin
(Sigma).
Expression of recombinant proteins
CHO cells were transfected with pEF6-myc-His vectors
expressing HIV-1 gp120 structural genes. Stable cell lines
were established by using blasticidine-supplemented
medium. Cells were harvested, sonicated and lysed in lysis
buffer (25 mM Tris base, 2.5 mM Mercaptoethanol, 1%
Triton-X100 and a cocktail of protease inhibitors).
Recombinant viral proteins were purified with the TALON
metal resin kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as per manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant proteins were confirmed by western blotting and Immunofluorecence
antibody staining as previously described [41-43].
Animal experiments
Six-week old golden hamsters were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Hamsters were maintained in accordance with laboratory standard procedures
and were housed in Animal Care in the Faculty of Medicine at University of Ottawa. A total of 100 µg recombinant protein in 0.2 mg of Monophosphoryl lipid A
(MPL: Corixa, Hamilton, MT) was injected per animal.
Groups of four hamsters were immunized four times subcutaneously (S.C.) in three different sites with one month
interval between each immunization. Fourteen days after
the last boost, the hamsters were sacrificed and their
spleens and blood were collected for further testing or
long-term storage in cryopreservation medium.
Antibody measurement
96-well ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4°C with
gp120 proteins clade B (MN, SF162), C (96ZM651) and
A/E (93TH975) obtained from the AIDS Research and
Reference Reagent Program, National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The plates were washed
with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and then blocked
for 1 h with 1% BSA in PBS. Following a second wash with
PBS/0.05% Tween 20, the plates were incubated for 2 h at
37°C with serially diluted sera. The plates were washed
and incubated for 2 h with peroxidase-conjugated affinitypurified rabbit anti-hamster secondary antibody (BioRad). After washing, color was developed with O-phenylendiamine dihydrochloride (OPD: Sigma, St. Louise,
MO). The color reaction was stopped with 1 N HCl and
absorbance was read at 490 nm with an ELISA plate reader
(Bio-Rad).
Neutralizing antibody assay
Neutralization was measured as a function of reduction in
luciferase reporter gene expression after a single round of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/7/25

infection in TZM-bl cells. TZM-bl cells were obtained from
the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program,
as contributed by John Kappes and Xiaoyun Wu. Briefly,
200 TCID50 of virus was incubated with serial 3-fold dilutions of serum sample in triplicate in a total volume of
150 µl for 1 hr at 37°C in 96-well flat-bottom culture
plates. Freshly trypsinized TZM-bl cells (10,000 cells in
100 µl of growth medium containing 75 µg/ml DEAE dextran) were added to each well. Indinavir was added at a
final concentration of 1 µM to prevent virus replicaton in
the case of HIV-1 MN. One set of control wells received
cells + virus (virus control) and another set received cells
only (background control). After a 48 hour incubation,
100 µl of cells was transferred to 96-well black solid plates
(Corning Costar, Rochester, NY) for measurement of
luminescence using Bright Glo substrate solution as
described by the supplier (Promega, Madison WI). An
assay stock of HIV-1 MN was prepared in H9 cells. Assays
stocks of Env-pseudotyped viruses were prepared by tranfection in 293T cells. All virus stocks were made cell-free
by 0.45-micron filtration and were stored at -70°C until
use.
Lymphocyte proliferation assay
The assay was performed by [3H] thymidine incorporation as previously described [44]. Briefly, splenocytes
from immunized hamsters were resuspended at 2 × 106
cells/ml in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, 50 µM β-mercaptoethanol and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. A
100 µl aliquot containing 2 × 105 cells was added to each
well of a 96 well plate. The gp120 protein subtypes B, C
and A/E (100 µl at 20 µg/ml) were added to each well in
triplicate. As a positive control, cells were also stimulated
with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin
(PMA/ION: Sigma). After 48 h of culture, 1 µCi [3H] thymidine (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) was added to
each well. Following 16 h of incubation, cells were harvested onto glass fibre filtermats and thymidine incorporation was measured with a Microbeta beta counter
(Wallac, Turku, Finland).
