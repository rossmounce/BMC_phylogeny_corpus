Molecular epidemiology of chikungunya strains
in Singapore in 2008
Kim-Yoong Puong*, Kwai-Peng Chan
From 16th International Symposium on HIV and Emerging Infectious Diseases
Marseille, France. 24-26 March 2010
Background
Strain characterization and genotyping of chikungunya
virus (CHIKV) using sequencing for epidemiological
study.
Methods
Blood samples were inoculated into A. albopictus C6/36
cells and Vero cells. Positive cultures for CHIKV were
confirmed by RT-PCR targeting the gene that codes for
CHIKV viral envelope protein E2. Viral RNA was
extracted from the supernatant of viral infected Vero
cells using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). RTPCR was performed using a one-step RT-PCR kit
(SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase, Invitrogen). Primers 9648F,
10403R, 10145F, 11158R, 10959F and 11690R were used
to amplify and sequence the E1 gene. DNA fragments
were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and sequenced using the same primers. The
sequences obtained were aligned using ClustalX programme. The phylogenetic tree was constructed based
on the 1,044-nt region within the E1 gene from codons
91-438 by neighbor-joining method with Phylip, Version
3.5 and the statistical significance estimated by bootstrap
analysis using 1,000 pseudoreplicate data sets.
Results
Three CHIKV strains were successfully isolated. These
samples were all collected in August 08. The molecular
epidemiological study revealed that all viruses were
related to East, Central, and South Africa (ECSA) phylogroup. All isolates had alanine replaced by valine at aa
residue 226 (A226V) of the E1 gene. Besides the nonsynonymous mutation, these isolates possessed 2 nucleotide mutations, C300T and A363G of the E1 gene. One

of the isolates showed another synonymous mutations
at nucleotide position 1030 (A1030G) of the E1 gene.

Discussion
Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the circulating chikungunya strains in Singapore in August 08 belong to
the genogroup ECSA, which has caused large CHIKV
outbreaks in several countries worldwide and beyond the
African continent, like in the Indian Ocean Islands and
India during 2005-2006. C300T, A363G and C677T
(A226V) found in all CHIKV isolates in Singapore were
also identified in CHIKV strains isolated in Malaysia
from April to December 2008. Notably, C300T was
unique to CHIKV strains isolated in Malaysia. Our study
suggests that the concurrent chikungunya outbreaks in
Singapore and Malaysia, where two countries are of close
geographical proximity, were interconnected.
