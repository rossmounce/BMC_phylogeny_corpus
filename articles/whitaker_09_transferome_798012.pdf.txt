Abstract
Background: Metabolic networks are responsible for many essential cellular processes, and
exhibit a high level of evolutionary conservation from bacteria to eukaryotes. If genes encoding
metabolic enzymes are horizontally transferred and are advantageous, they are likely to become
fixed. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has played a key role in prokaryotic evolution and its
importance in eukaryotes is increasingly evident. High levels of endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT)
accompanied the establishment of plastids and mitochondria, and more recent events have allowed
further acquisition of bacterial genes. Here, we present the first comprehensive multi-species
analysis of E/HGT of genes encoding metabolic enzymes from bacteria to unicellular eukaryotes.
Results: The phylogenetic trees of 2,257 metabolic enzymes were used to make E/HGT assertions
in ten groups of unicellular eukaryotes, revealing the sources and metabolic processes of the
transferred genes. Analyses revealed a preference for enzymes encoded by genes gained through
horizontal and endosymbiotic transfers to be connected in the metabolic network. Enrichment in
particular functional classes was particularly revealing: alongside plastid related processes and
carbohydrate metabolism, this highlighted a number of pathways in eukaryotic parasites that are
rich in enzymes encoded by transferred genes, and potentially key to pathogenicity. The plant
parasites Phytophthora were discovered to have a potential pathway for lipopolysaccharide
biosynthesis of E/HGT origin not seen before in eukaryotes outside the Plantae.
Conclusions: The number of enzymes encoded by genes gained through E/HGT has been
established, providing insight into functional gain during the evolution of unicellular eukaryotes. In
eukaryotic parasites, genes encoding enzymes that have been gained through horizontal transfer
may be attractive drug targets if they are part of processes not present in the host, or are
significantly diverged from equivalent host enzymes.

Background

Cellular metabolism is the network of chemical reactions that
organisms use to convert input molecules into the molecules

and energy they need to live and grow. Core metabolic processes and their enzyme catalysts are often conserved among
the different kingdoms of life, which has allowed many spe-

cies' metabolic networks to be automatically reconstructed
from their genome sequences by the identification of
homologs [1-5]. In addition to core metabolic processes,
peripheral processes allow species to adapt to different environments - for example, metabolism of a rare sugar. This
adaptation can be driven by the gain of genes encoding
enzymes through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) [6], and this
process has for some time been seen as an important aspect
of prokaryotic evolution [7-9]. But as more eukaryotic
genome sequences have become available, it has become clear
that HGT has also occurred in the evolutionary histories of
the eukaryotes [10].
HGT is likely to have had a more important influence upon
the evolution of unicellular eukaryotes because there is no
separate germline in which the transferred genes need to be
fixed. Sources of HGT in eukaryotes include viruses, absorption from the environment, phagocytosis and endosymbiosis.
HGT that accompanies endosymbiosis, termed endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT), was important in establishing the
eukaryotic organelles: the mitochondria and plastids. In
addition to the primary endosymbiosis events that established plastids as eukaryotic organelles, multiple endosymbioses have occurred in unicellular eukaryotes [11,12]. An
important example is the event, or events, that gave rise to the
chromalveolates, in which a heterotrophic eukaryote gained a
plastid through endocytosis of a plastid-containing red alga
[13]. This brought together five genomes in one cell - two
nuclear, two mitochondrial and one plastid - and with them
came the opportunity for large scale EGT [14,15]. A further
potential source of EGT in eukaryotes is from Chlamydia and
may have occurred during the establishment of the primary
plastid [16,17].
Among the unicellular eukaryotes are some important human
and agricultural parasites, and consequently many have had
their genomes sequenced, making comparative analysis of
HGT possible within this group. Analysis of HGT in eukaryotic parasites offers interesting insights into their evolution. It
is also of practical significance: horizontally transferred genes
are often bacterial in origin, and thus more divergent from the
host's eukaryotic equivalents than parasite genes of purely
eukaryotic origin. They are therefore potentially good drug
targets [18], owing to the increased likelihood of the discovery
of parasite-specific inhibitors.
Methods of detecting HGTs from sequence data can be split
into four categories: codon-based approaches that identify
genes with a codon usage differing from the other genes in the
genome [19,20]; BLAST-based approaches that identify
sequences with high-scoring similarities to sequences from
taxonomically distant species [21]; gene distribution-based
approaches that compare the species that posses a gene to the
accepted species phylogeny, allowing unusual patterns of
gene possession that could be explained by HGT to be identified [6]; and phylogenetic approaches that construct phyloge-

netic trees and identify clades that differ from the expected
organismal phylogeny [22,23]. Of the different methods of
HGT detection, phylogenetic approaches offer the most
power when studying HGT in eukaryotes. BLAST-based
approaches have been shown to be misleading as the top
BLAST hit is not always the closest evolutionary neighbor
[24]; codon-based approaches are ineffective for ancient HGT
events, such as EGTs, as over time sequences change to match
the new genomic environment [25]; and gene distribution
approaches rely strongly on good taxon sampling and the
completeness of genome sequences.
Identification of all the HGTs in species' genomes allows the
establishment and comparison of their transferomes (that is,
all of the genes that the species has gained through HGT).
Genes encoding metabolic enzymes are more likely to be
involved in effective HGT from bacteria to eukaryotes than
other classes of gene, because metabolic processes are more
similar than, for instance, processes of genetic information
processing [26,27]. There are several examples of the genes
that encode metabolic enzymes being acquired through HGT
in unicellular eukaryotes [14,28-31]. Metabolic enzymes can
be positioned within well-defined biological processes and
pathways, allowing the analysis of more detailed functional
properties of the transferred genes that encode them, such as
network connectivity. To investigate the extent of the horizontal transfer of genes that encode metabolic enzymes in
unicellular eukaryotes, the metabolic evolution resource
metaTIGER [32] was used. metaTIGER is particularly suited
to this task because it contains 2,257 maximum-likelihood
phylogenetic trees (with bootstrap analysis), each including
sequences from up to 121 eukaryotes and 404 prokaryotes
predicted to code for enzymes with specific Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers and located within reference metabolic
networks. Furthermore, metaTIGER incorporates the program PHAT [22], a high-throughput tree searching program,
which allows trees depicting HGT events to be easily identified. The high-quality trees and search tools provided by
metaTIGER provide the foundation upon which this study is
based.

Results and discussion
Levels of horizontal gene transfer in unicellular
eukaryotes
To investigate the extent of HGT in unicellular eukaryotes,
the metaTIGER phylogenetic tree database was searched for
potential HGTs in the following groups of eukaryotes: Plasmodium, Theileria, Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium, Leishmania, Trypanosoma, Phytophthora, diatoms, Ostreococcus
and Saccharomyces. The species were considered in groups,
each containing more than one species' genome sequence
(groups are genera, with the exception of diatoms, which consist of two closely related genera, and Toxoplasma, which
consists of two strains of the same species). Analysis was
restricted to groups with more than one genome sequenced to

prevent potential bacterial contamination in a single genome
from influencing the results. Saccharomyces was included as
a reference genus of non-parasitic, single-celled eukaryotic
species believed to have never possessed a plastid-like
organelle. Diatoms and Ostreococcus are photosynthetic and
non-parasitic, while the remainder are important parasitic
pathogens, including Apicomplexa (Plasmodium, Theileria,
Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium) and Trypanasomatids
(Leishmania, Trypanosoma). The Apicomplexa, together
with Phytophthora and the diatoms, lie within the eukaryotic
supergroup of chromalveolates, believed to have gained a
plastid by secondary endosymbiosis in the past, which is now
lost in some cases. Detailed lists of the species used are
included in Additional data file 1.
We refer to all putative gene transfers of plant, cyanobacterial
and chlamydial origin as potential EGTs, while putative
transfers of all other origins are referred to as HGTs. This is
based on accepting the simplest explanation of events for
gene acquisition; however, it should be made clear that phylogenetic trees only indicate a likely taxonomic source of genes
and not the route through which they were acquired. Putative
non-endosymbiotic transfers are split into two classes: 'recent
HGTs', when the eukaryotic group being considered is the
only genus of eukaryotes present in the clade upon which the
prediction is based; and 'ancient HGTs', which occurred prior
to the divergence of the genera concerned from eukaryotes in
the same phylum - they are found when eukaryotes belonging
to the same phylum are present in the clade upon which the
prediction is based. Further details of gene transfer predic-

tion can be found in Additional data file 1. Extensive EGT is
known to have occurred between alpha-proteobacteria and
the ancestor of the eukaryotes during the establishment of the
mitochondria. Since this EGT is commonly believed to have
occurred prior to the divergence of the eukaryotes being considered in this study [33], the transferred genes may be universal to them all and, therefore, difficult to identify as being
of alpha-proteobacterial origin. For these reasons EGT of
alpha-proteobacterial origin was not considered in this study.
When searching for trees depicting high-confidence HGT
events, only clades with bootstrap support of 70% or above
were considered (this has been shown to correspond to a high
probability that the clade is correct [34]). We also retained
lists of potential HGT events with less than 70% bootstrap
support as a lower-confidence set. The trees resulting from
the HGT searches were checked manually to ensure convincing evidence of E/HGT. The use of species groups containing
more than one genome sequence, clades with bootstrap support of â¥ 70%, and the manual checking ensured that the
high-confidence HGT assertions are as reliable as possible.
Unless otherwise stated, results in this paper refer to the
high-confidence E/HGT assertions. We consider these results
to be an underestimate of the true level of EGT and HGT,
since in some cases of E/HGT the sequences concerned will
contain insufficient phylogenetic signal to assert this unambiguously [35]. Full details of the tree selection statements
employed are contained in Additional data file 1. Figure 1
shows the overall levels of high-confidence E/HGT events in
each species group, while a detailed listing of enzymes

timates, but supports their use in larger scale analyses in
order to avoid the effects of potential false positive assertions.

As expected, no EGTs were found in Saccharomyces, while
the number of predicted EGTs was greatest in two photosynthetic groups, Ostreococcus and the diatoms. The non-photosynthetic chromalveolates Toxoplasma, Theileria and
Plasmodium, which have retained their plastids for non-photosynthetic metabolic processes, as well as Cryptosporidium
and Phytophthora, which have lost their plastids, all have 45% of their enzymes originating from EGT and 2-3% of their
enzymes originating from other HGTs. These transferred
genes may represent viable drug targets, particularly if not
found in the host genome. The trypanosomatids, Trypanosoma and Leishmania, are thought to have once possessed a
plastid gained through secondary endosymbiosis [36]; however, only 1% of the enzymes found in their genomes were
predicted as being EGTs potentially from this source. The
high number of HGT genes encoding enzymes, 5-7% of all
enzymes found, in thetrypanosomatids suggests that there
are many potential drug targets of bacterial origin in these
parasites (see below for further discussion). The EGTs that
remain in species that have lost their plastid show that some
EGTs have functions outside of the plastid, as observed in
previous studies [14,15,37].

Horizontal gene transfers in the trypanosomatids that
are potential drug targets

To our knowledge there have been no previous studies examining E/HGT in multiple species, with regard to the entire
metabolic capacity, and performed on this scale. There have
been studies of single species [14,28,30,38], and a study
examining four apicomplexan species [39]. To assess our
results, we compared them to previous work that looked at E/
HGT in Cryptosporidium parvum [14]. This previous study
found a total of 31 genes as potential HGTs, of which 20 were
enzymes with specific EC numbers and can be compared to
this work. Our results for Cryptosporidium comprise 12 highconfidence E/HGT predictions and another 21 lower-confidence predictions. Five of the high-confidence predictions
made by this study were also made by the previous study. The
predictions made by the previous study that were not highconfidence predictions in this study (n = 15): lacked the levels
of bootstrap support needed to be considered high-confidence; did not appear to be HGTs based on evidence from our
trees, which we attribute to the greater taxonomic coverage of
available sequences in this later study; were very divergent
genes (for example, genes in singleton OrthoMCL groups
[40]) that were not assigned to specific EC numbers by the
stringent criteria used in metaTIGER and, therefore, their
sequences were not selected to be used in the metaTIGER
phylogenetic trees; or, were not predicted as being present in
both Cryptosporidium species. This comparison shows that
assertions of HGT within eukaryotic genomes depend on confidence thresholds, and are subject to change as the taxonomic coverage of available sequences increases. It illustrates
that our high-confidence predictions are likely to be underes-

There is a great need for drug development against trypanosomatids. The large transferome identified in trypanosomes
suggests a plethora of potential targets for drug development.
This is exemplified by the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase
(4.1.1.1), whose gene is predicted to have been gained by horizontal transfer in Leishmania. Pyruvate decarboxylase has
already been shown to be an effective drug target in Leishmania tropica as it serves as the target of the drug omeprazole
[41,42]. Three new potential drug targets from the list of
enzymes whose genes are predicted as having been horizontally acquired are: isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase
(IPI; 5.3.3.2), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH; 1.1.1.42) and
pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (PCR; 1.5.1.2).
IPI is used to convert isopentenyl diphosphate to dimethylallyl diphosphate in steroid biosynthesis, which is, in turn, used
in the biosynthesis of farnesyl diphosphate. Blocking of a later
step in the production of farnesyl diphosphate, through
blocking farnesyl diphosphate synthase, has been shown to be
effective in killing T. cruzi in vitro [43] and in vivo [44].
Humans have two copies of this IPI while T. cruzi has only
one. The T. cruzi enzyme exhibits 28% identity with the 46
amino acids in the most highly conserved region of the
enzyme when aligned with the human enzymes, suggesting
that parasite-specific inhibitors could be developed.
Both humans and L. major have a mitochondrial and a cytoplasmic copy of the enzyme IDH. Mitochondrial IDH functions in the TCA cycle whereas the cytoplasmic enzyme is
involved in regulating oxidative stress. The gene encoding the
cytoplasmic copy of IDH was predicted as being a HGT in
Leishmania. The enzyme is between 19% and 20% identical
to the human ortholog when the most highly conserved
region is aligned, suggesting that parasite-specific inhibitors
could be developed. Cytoplasmic IDH is important in protection from oxidative stress in rats by supplying NADPH for the
reduction of glutathione [45]. Leishmania do not use glutathione to protect themselves from oxidative stress but instead
use other thiols, such as trypanothione [46,47], which also
rely upon NADPH for their reduction. This suggests that targeting of Leishmania's cytoplasmic IDH may increase its susceptibility to oxidative stress, which is one mechanism by
which the host immune system combats these parasites.
PCR is the final enzyme in a pathway for the conversion of
proline to glutamate, and is predicted to be the sole proline
biosynthetic pathway in T. cruzi. There are two copies of the
gene encoding T. cruzi PCR, which are 99% identical and are
HGTs. Humans have six copies of this enzyme that are
between 38% and 45% identical to the T. cruzi enzymes, suggesting that parasite-specific inhibitors could be developed.

Double gene transfers
Three examples were observed where two genes encoding the
same enzyme have been acquired from different sources
within the same group of organisms: beta-ketoacyl-acyl-carrier-protein synthase I (2.3.1.41) in Ostreococcus, 2,4dienoyl-CoA reductase (1.3.1.34) in the diatoms, and glucokinase (2.7.1.2) in Phytophthora. Beta-ketoacyl-acyl-carrierprotein synthase I in Ostreococcus was gained from cyanobacteria and Chlamydia and is involved in the plastid process
of fatty acid biosynthesis, which explains its acquisition
through EGT. 2,4-Dienoyl-CoA reductase in the diatoms was
gained from both plants and gamma-proteobacteria and is
needed if a cis-alpha-4 bond is present during beta oxidation,
when Acyl-CoA molecules are broken down in mitochondria
to generate Acetyl-CoA, which enters the Krebs cycle. Glucokinase in Phytophthora was gained from both plants and
bacteroidales and is found in the KEGG pathways 'glycolysis/
gluconeogenesis', 'galactose metabolism' and 'starch and
sucrose metabolism'. It is possible that the glucokinases of
different origins are optimal in different pathways. The gain
and then retention of genes of multiple origins is an unusual
observation within our results and there is no clear explanation for this. It is possible that the different copies could function in different pathways or locations within the cell;
however, it could just be by chance that these multi-copy
genes were gained from different origins, and then maintained, within these species.

Chlamydia and endosymbiotic gene transfer
Recently, it has been suggested that a chlamydial endosymbiont facilitated the establishment of the primary plastid [16,17]
in plants. To investigate this, the number of enzymes of
chlamydial origin in Ostreococcus was examined (Table 1).
Three enzymes of chlamydial origin were identified in Ostreococcus. In the diatoms, Toxoplasma, Theileria and Plasmodium, examples of EGTs from both plant and Chlamydia
were found; these may represent enzymes whose genes were
transferred from Chlamydia into plants and then transferred
into the ancestor(s) of the chromalveolates. The EGTs of

Volume 10, Issue 4, Article R36

chlamydial origin support the idea that chlamydial endosymbiosis facilitated the establishment of the primary plastid.
Two EGTs of chlamydial origin but not plant origin, which
encode nitric-oxide synthase in Phytophthora and HMB-PP
reductase in the four apicomplexans, were considered more
likely to represent HGT than EGT. The gain of the HMB-PP
reductase-encoding gene through horizontal transfer has
been identified before [32] and seems to represent an orthologous replacement of an endosymbiotically transferred gene
within the apicomplexan lineage.

Gene transfer and metabolic network connectivity
The idea that genes of related function might be co-transferred was investigated. To examine this, the number of connections (that is, metabolic network adjacency relationships
corresponding to enzymes that catalyze consecutive steps in a
pathway) between enzymes whose genes were acquired via
horizontal transfer within the predicted metabolic network of
each organism group was considered. This was done by calculating the average number of connections between enzymes
whose genes had been acquired through horizontal transfer,
and comparing this to the distribution of connection numbers
between the same number of enzymes chosen at random from
the group metabolic network. This randomization test was
used to assess statistical significance (Additional data file 3).
The degree of network connectivity between enzymes
encoded by genes gained through EGT in the chromalveolates
and Ostreococcus was found to be significantly greater than
random, as would be expected since many chromalveolates
and Ostreococcus still possess plastids containing complete
plastid-specific pathways of endosymbiotically acquired
genes. However, Cryptosporidium and Phytophthora, which
have now lost their plastids, also show levels of connectivity
between enzymes encoded by genes gained through EGT that
are significantly greater than random. This shows that pathways, or at least pairs of connected enzymes that have functions outside the plastid, have been transferred during
endosymbiosis.

The number of EGTs of each putative origin is given for each species group; for example, for a gene's origin to be predicted as plant and
cyanobacteria it must lie in a clade containing species of both these groups. The origins of the genes encoding the enzymes were predicted by using
the metaTIGER tree searches (see text). Numbers refer to high-confidence predictions (clades with bootstrap values of 70 or above). Cyanobacteria
and Chlamydia are abbreviated to cyano and chlamy, respectively. EGTs of cyanobacterial and plant, or chlamydial and plant origin represent bacterial
EGTs into plants that have then been endosymbiotically transferred from plant into their new host - for example, during secondary endosymbiosis.

The number of connections between enzymes encoded by
genes acquired from bacteria was not found to be significantly
greater than random in any species group. However, in Leishmania and Ostreococcus, where HGT is at the highest level,
the network connectivity is approximately three times greater
than the random value (with P-values of 0.065 and 0.054,
respectively), suggesting a weak tendency towards the gain of
genes whose protein products are connected within the metabolic network. It is possible that more statistically significant
connectivity is masked to some extent by our requirement for
high-confidence HGT assertions.

Gene transfer and network complexity
Previous work on HGT between prokaryotes from a network
perspective has determined that genes encoding proteins
involved in complex systems are less likely to be transferred
than those that are not [48]. In particular, this work found
that 'informational genes' (those encoding proteins in transcription, translation, and related processes) were less likely
to be transferred than 'operational genes' (for example,
house-keeping genes). Since the analysis of E/HGT presented
in this study focuses on metabolic enzymes, most of which are
'operational genes', it is not possible to investigate if this
hypothesis holds true in eukaryotes. However, related work
has considered HGT in the evolution of the Escherichia coli
metabolic network, and found that genes that encode
enzymes located at the periphery of the network are more
likely to be gained through HGT than those in the center of
the network [6]. To investigate if a similar trend was present
in the E/HGTs predicted in this study, the average number of
connections between an enzyme and other enzymes (within
the metabolic network) was compared between E/HGTs and
ancestral genes. Our analysis found no link between the
number of connections and the origin of a gene encoding an
enzyme (results not shown). The lack of observed difference
might be due to the large number of parasites included in this
study, which generally evolve through reductive evolution or
gain-of-function for parasitism. Also, the E/HGT events
being examined in this study are very ancient in comparison
to the HGT events by which prokaryotes continually adapt
their metabolic networks to their environment [49-51] and,
therefore, have had more time to become more fully incorporated into the metabolic network.

Enrichment analyses
Enrichment analysis was carried out to investigate if the
genes encoding enzymes from particular functional categories are more likely to have been acquired through HGT. The
functional categories considered were enzymes in the same
KEGG map group (representing broad metabolic categories
of KEGG maps), KEGG map (a smaller category of interconnected metabolic pathways) or KEGG module (representing
defined pathways within KEGG maps); enzymes matching in
EC number up to levels 1, 2 or 3; and enzymes using the same
co-factors. For each functional category, the proportion of
genes within each category resulting from E/HGT was com-

Volume 10, Issue 4, Article R36

Whitaker et al. R36.6

pared with the proportion of E/HGTs over all categories and
statistical significance was assigned using the hypergeometric
distribution (although some of the functional groups contain
very few enzymes, rendering statistical significance unlikely).
EGTs and HGTs were considered separately for each of the
groups of species. The results of enrichment using the EC
number levels and co-factors found very few significant
results, suggesting that there is no underlying trend for
enzymes with particular molecular functions to be transferred. The statistically significant results of the KEGG map
group, KEGG map and KEGG module enrichment analysis
are presented in Table 2. Additionally, the complete results of
all five types of analysis are available in Additional data files
4 and 5.
The KEGG map group 'lipid metabolism' (Table 2) is significantly enriched with EGTs in Ostreococcus, Plasmodium and
Toxoplasma. Additionally, the diatoms and Theileria have
near significant enrichment for 'lipid metabolism' with
enrichment scores of 1.526 and 3.488, respectively. An
enrichment of EGTs in 'lipid metabolism' is found in all the
species groups that still possess a plastid. This enrichment of
EGTs is a result of aspects of 'lipid metabolism', such as the
non-mevalonate isoprenoid biosynthesis and type II fatty
acid biosynthesis pathways, which occur within the plastid.
Accordingly, some of these processes are also significantly
enriched at the more detailed KEGG map and KEGG module
levels. An interesting consequence of Plasmodium having
retained many EGTs in 'lipid metabolism' is that its plastid
(which has now lost all photosynthetic activity) must be
retained for the parasite's survival [52-55].
The KEGG map group 'metabolism of cofactors and vitamins'
is enriched with EGTs in the photosynthetic alga, the diatoms
and Ostreococcus. The enrichment in this KEGG map group
is mainly due to enrichment in the KEGG map 'porphyrin and
chlorophyll metabolism'. Additionally, Ostreococcus was significantly enriched with enzymes in the KEGG map 'carbon
fixation'. Again, genes originating from EGT enrich a section
of plastid metabolism; however, this time they are involved in
photosynthesis. The KEGG module 'heme biosynthesis,
glutamate = > protoheme/siroheme' was found to be
enriched with EGTs in the diatoms and Ostreococcus. This
module contains a pathway that is common to eukaryotes and
prokaryotes and is used to produce heme from L-glutamate.
It has previously been shown that diatoms and plants have a
common origin of this pathway, which mainly originates from
EGT, but with some genes originating from mitochondrial
EGT and others being ancestral [56]. Our high-confidence
results agree with the previous analysis in all but one case
where the endosymbiotic transfer of the gene encoding
hydroxymethylbilane synthase (2.5.1.61) into the diatoms
was omitted owing to insufficient bootstrap support (57%).
These results show the successful identification of enrichment in pathways involved in photosynthesis, plastid-related

Significant over-representation of E/HGTs in biological pathways is shown on the following levels: Map group, KEGG map group; Map, KEGG map;
Module, KEGG module. 'Total enzymes' is the number of enzymes in the species group within the defined category; 'EGT' and 'HGT' are counts of
the number of transferred enzymes in the category followed in parentheses by the over-representation statistic for E/HGTs in that category (the
proportion of E/HGTs for the category divided by the proportion of E/HGTs over all categories). Only statistically significant over-representation is
shown and is indicated by asterisks (95% level) and dagger symbols (99% level). Significantly enriched pathways are not listed if the pathways
contained only one E/HGT. The pathways are grouped by the KEGG map group they belong to in the following order: 'lipid metabolism',
'carbohydrate metabolism', 'energy metabolism', 'amino acid metabolism' and 'metabolism of other amino acids', 'metabolism of cofactors and
vitamins', 'glycan biosynthesis and metabolism', 'xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism' and 'amino-tRNA biosynthesis'. Abbreviations used in the
pathway names: AA, amino acids; bsyn, biosynthesis; met, metabolism.

lipid metabolism and heme biosynthesis with EGTs, indicating that despite the conservative nature of the high-confidence EGT predictions, well-supported underlying patterns
of gene transfer can be identified.

also present in large amounts in the cytoplasm of Phytophora, where it is used as the principal storage polysaccharide used in sporulation, germination and infection [57].

The KEGG map group of 'carbohydrate metabolism' is
enriched with EGTs in Cryptosporidium, Phytophthora,
Plasmodium and Theileria. In particular, Phytophthora and
Plasmodium are enriched with glycolytic enzymes; Phytophthora is enriched with enzymes involved in 'starch and
sucrose metabolism', and Cryptosporidium and Plasmodium
are enriched with enzymes involved in 'pyruvate metabolism'.
Two important enzymes that feature in several KEGG maps,
and in particular glycolysis, are pyruvate kinase and glucose6-phosphate isomerase, and both their genes are predicted to
have been acquired through endosymbiotic transfer in six
organism groups. It is likely these were present prior to the
secondary endosymbiosis event, suggesting these EGTs are
examples of ortholog displacements. The enrichment of the
KEGG map 'starch and sucrose metabolism' in Phytophthora
is partly due to an enzyme involved in glucan metabolism and
two enzymes involved in trehalose metabolism, which are discussed in detail below.

Further functionally interesting endosymbiotic transfers into
Phytophthora from within the KEGG map 'starch and sucrose
metabolism' are two genes that encode the enzymes trehalose-6P synthetase (2.4.1.15) and trehalase (3.2.1.28). These
are involved in trehalose metabolism; additionally, a third
gene encoding a trehalose enzyme, trehalose-phosphatase
(3.1.3.12), also appears to have been endosymbiotically
acquired following manual inspection of its phylogenetic tree
but was not in our high-confidence prediction list. Together
these three enzymes form a reversible pathway that produces
trehalose from UDP-glucose. Trehalose is a non-reducing disaccharide that is found in animals, fungi, plants and bacteria.
It acts as a store of polysaccharide, but also provides resistance to a number of environmental stresses [36], including
dehydration, extreme temperatures and damage by oxygen
radicals. Stress resistance is highly relevant to Phytophthora
during long periods of dormancy in soil, and while under
attack by plant defense mechanisms, including damaging free
radicals.

The enzyme 1-3-beta-glucan synthase (2.4.1.34), which produces 1-3-beta-glucan from UDP-glucose, was found to be
endosymbiotically transferred into Phytophthora. Additionally, Phytophthora possess the enzyme 1-3-beta-glucosidase
(3.2.1.58), which is responsible for breaking down 1-3-betaglucan. Phytophthora use 1-3-beta-glucan for two essential
functions: it is the most abundant polysaccharide in the Phytophthora cell wall, where it protects the cell from the plant's
defense response and environmental stresses [57]; and it is

A recent review of Leishmania metabolism [58] suggested a
bacterial origin of several enzymes that had been important to
the parasite's metabolic adaptation. One of these enzymes is
xylose kinase (2.7.1.17), which is part of the pathway 'pentose
and glucuronate interconversion'. Our analysis predicted the
gene encoding xylose kinase to have been horizontally transferred into Leishmania. Furthermore, another two genes,
encoding enzymes from the same pathway, xylulose reductase (1.1.19) and ribulokinase (2.7.1.16), were also predicted as

Genome Biology 2009,

being gained through horizontal transfer, enriching the pathway 'pentose and glucuronate interconversion'. Inspection of
the trees indicates that these enzymes originated from enterobacteria. With these enzymes and other less pathway-specific
enzymes, a biochemical pathway can be reconstructed for
Leishmania that produces ribulose-5P from xylose or ribulose (Figure 2). The ribulose-5P is used for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis and glycolysis. Xylose may serve as a
nutritional component for Leishmania during its vector
stages as xylose is likely to be part of the diet of the sandfly.
The genes encoding three enzymes involved in heme biosynthesis, coproporphyrinogen-III oxidase (1.3.3.3) (high-confidence), protoporphyrinogen oxidase (1.3.3.4) (highconfidence) and ferrochelatase (4.99.1.1) (low-confidence),
are suggested to have originated from HGT in Leishmania.
This resulted in an enrichment of HGTs in the Leishmania
'heme biosynthesis, glutamate = > protoheme/siroheme'
KEGG module. Inspection of the trees containing the two
high-confidence predictions suggests the enzymes were
acquired from gamma-proteobacteria. The enzymes are likely
to form a pathway allowing the biosynthesis of heme from

porphyrin precursors; however, it is unclear at which life
stage the pathway is operational [58].
The KEGG map 'glutamate metabolism' is enriched with three
HGTs in Leishmania. One of these enzymes is glutathionylspermidine synthase (6.3.1.8), which produces mono-glutathionyl spermidine and is important in redox control in
Leishmania [47]. A second enzyme, trypanothione synthase
(6.3.1.9), is also important in redox control, and is encoded by
a gene that is predicted to have been horizontally acquired in
both Leishmania and the Trypanosoma. Trypanothione synthase is thought to have evolved from, and in some cases to
have replaced, glutathionylspermidine synthase, which is
now present as a pseudogene in Leishmania major, although
it may still remain active in other trypanosomatids [59]. The
resistance to oxidative stress that the products of these
enzymes provide is very important to the pathogenicity of
both the Leishmania and Trypanosoma. Manual inspection
of the trees of glutathionylspermidine synthase and trypanothione synthase places the trypanosomatids in a clade that is
separate and very divergent from the bacteria that comprise
the rest of the tree. This suggests that rather than having been
acquired via horizontal transfer, the genes encoding these
enzymes may be ancestral genes that have only been retained
in these basally diverging eukaryotes.
The pathway group 'glycan biosynthesis' in Phytophthora
was enriched with HGTs as a result of two HGTs present
within the KEGG pathway 'lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis'. Additionally, a third enzyme in this pathway was identified as being encoded by a gene gained during
endosymbiotic transfer. As LPS is an important virulence factor in pathogenic bacteria that has not previously been
reported as being present in Phytophthora or any other
eukaryotes outside the Plantae, further investigations of this
pathway were carried out. Manual inspection of the phylogenetic trees of the two other enzymes that present in the
metaTIGER 'LPS biosynthesis' pathway suggests that these
enzymes might also have been acquired via gene transfers,
although with low-confidence. As only 5 of the 30 enzymes in
the KEGG 'LPS biosynthesis' pathway have EC numbers and
enzyme models (that is, PRIAM profiles) and are therefore
able to be detected by the SHARKhunt software, profiles for
all 30 of the enzymes in the KEGG 'LPS biosynthesis' pathway
were made (see Materials and methods for details). Searching
the Phytophthora genomes with the 30 enzyme profiles identified 11 enzymes that are present in both genomes with E-values <10-10 (see Additional data file 6 for full results).

Together these 11 enzymes carry out 13 of the 17 reactions
(Figure 3) that are needed to form KDO2-lipid(A) and ADP-Lgylcero-D-manno-heptose. In Gram-negative bacteria these
compounds form the minimal core structure of LPS [60,61].
The outer parts of LPS are more varied and hence the
enzymes that catalyze their formation are likely to have
diverged more than enzymes involved in the synthesis of the

Conclusions

The metabolic evolution resource metaTIGER has successfully been used to construct a high-confidence dataset of
enzymes whose genes are predicted to have been acquired
through HGT in ten groups of unicellular eukaryotes. This
collection of high-confidence predictions has allowed the
transferomes of metabolic genes belonging to these organisms to be compared, providing new insight into their evolutionary histories. As expected, genes encoding enzymes
involved in plastid metabolism were identified as EGTs, but
more interestingly, other unexpected examples were identified. The unexpected examples of transfers included genes
encoding enzymes that form previously unreported pathways
in medically and agriculturally important pathogens. The
gain of these pathways, via HGT, may have been an essential
evolutionary step in their adaptation to a parasitic lifestyle. If
the enzymes' functions are essential, then they could provide
targets for future drug development. It is important to note,
however, that genome sequencing in general has been biased
towards pathogenic organisms, and the finding of E/HGT in
pathogenicity-related pathways may reflect this.

LPS core or may not be present in Phytophthora. In plant
pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, LPS is important for virulence as it reduces bacterial membrane permeability and
sensitivity to antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides [62-64].
Additionally, it may play a role in attachment to plant surfaces [60,65,66]. Given that Phytophora is also a plant pathogen and will also have to cope with attacks from plant hosts,
it is possible that its LPS may have a similar protective or
attachment function.

During putative HGT prediction very stringent selection criteria were used. This means the results presented can be
treated with confidence. However, it also means that the levels of HGT presented here are likely to be a conservative estimate of the actual levels of HGT that may have occurred. This
is unavoidable as the sequences of many enzymes do not contain strong enough phylogenetic signal for reliable phylogenetic reconstruction. One possible cause of this, which has
been recently highlighted, is horizontal transfer involving
only parts of genes [67]. A greater understanding of species'
transferomes would be gained if this work was expanded to
incorporate genes of all functions. However, such work may
encounter problems when the genes being considered are less
functionally conserved than enzymes, making true ortholog
identification much more difficult.

Materials and methods
Prediction of HGT enzymes
The transferred enzymes were predicted by using the metaTIGER web site [32]. metaTIGER is a metabolic evolution
resource that contains the predicted metabolic capabilities of
121 eukaryotes. These were predicted with the program
SHARKhunt [1], a high-throughput genome metabolic annotation program based on enzyme sequence profile searches.
The enzyme profiles are based upon alignment of the amino
acid sequences of conserved regions of genes of known function (EC number). These are used to search genomes using a
combination of two sensitive bioinformatics techniques, PSIBLAST and hidden Markov models, which means distant
homologs can be detected in highly diverged organisms. Also
incorporated into the metaTIGER site are 2,257 maximumlikelihood phylogenetic trees, which also include sequences
from 404 prokaryotes. The trees only include sequence

matches to enzyme profiles with E-values <10-30. If there is
more than one sequence from a particular genome with an Evalue <10-30, only the sequence with the lowest hit is included
in the tree. These selection criteria aim to exclude paralogous
genes as far as possible, and to ensure that trees are made
only from orthologous sequences with specific EC numbers.
The sequences were aligned using MUSCLE [68] and the
trees were produced using the maximum-likelihood method
PhyML [69]. Each of the trees was bootstrapped for 100 replicates allowing the confidence of putative E/HGT clades to be
assessed. The phylogenetic analysis program PHAT [22] is
incorporated into the site and was used in this study to identify the putative HGT events. Details of the PHAT selection
statements that were used in HGT identification are given in
Additional data file 1. All the predictions made were checked
by inspection of the phylogenetic tree.

Connectivity analysis
To investigate the degree of connectivity between the putative
E/HGT, a predicted metabolic network for each of the species
groups being considered is required. This was obtained from
the KEGG reference metabolic network (constructed by parsing all the enzyme binary relations from the KEGG KGML
files [3,70]) and retaining only those network connections
involving enzymes predicted to be present in the species. This
network was then used to find the average number of connections between the transferred enzymes. To assess statistical
significance, the random distribution of enzyme connectivity
was obtained from 10,000 random samples of the same
number of enzymes from the network. To compare the
number of connections (within the metabolic network)
between enzymes gained through E/HGT and ancestral
enzymes the average number of connections was calculated
for each type within each species in the metabolic network.

Enrichment analyses
To investigate if the genes encoding enzymes of particular
biological or molecular functions are more prone to HGT,
enrichment analyses were carried out within enzyme functional groups. These functional groups were based on the first
three levels of the EC hierarchy, the use of particular co-factors and the division of the KEGG metabolic network into
map groups, maps and modules. KEGG maps gather a
number of interconnected and related metabolic pathways,
map groups are sets of related maps, and KEGG modules are
a set of defined pathways with each map. Within each functional group of enzymes, the proportion of HGTs was compared with the proportion of HGTs over all groups to identify
enrichment (HGTs in the pathway/Total enzymes in pathway)/(Total HGTs in species group/Total enzymes in species
group). Statistical significance was assessed using the hypergeometric distribution.

Further investigation of lipopolysaccharide
biosynthesis in Phytophthora
A number of enzymes in the KEGG 'LPS biosynthesis' pathway are not represented by sequence profiles in the SHARKhunt/PRIAM resources because they do not yet have EC
numbers. For these cases, all protein sequences for each of
the KEGG ortholog groups in the 'LPS biosynthesis' pathway
were obtained from KEGG [3]. For each of the KEGG ortholog
groups sequence profiles were made using SHARKmodel [1]
and these were used to search the genomes of P. sojae and P.
ramorum.
