Abstract
Background: Crohn's disease (CD) is a high morbidity chronic inflammatory disorder of unknown
aetiology. Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) has been recently implicated in the origin and
perpetuation of CD. Because bacterial biofilms in the gut mucosa are suspected to play a role in
CD and biofilm formation is a feature of certain pathogenic E. coli strains, we compared the biofilm
formation capacity of 27 AIEC and 38 non-AIEC strains isolated from the intestinal mucosa. Biofilm
formation capacity was then contrasted with the AIEC phenotype, the serotype, the phylotype, and
the presence of virulence genes.
Results: Specific biofilm formation (SBF) indices were higher amongst AIEC than non-AIEC strains
(P = 0.012). In addition, 65.4% of moderate to strong biofilms producers were AIEC, whereas
74.4% of weak biofilm producers were non-AIEC (P = 0.002). These data indicate that AIEC strains
were more efficient biofilm producers than non-AIEC strains. Moreover, adhesion (P = 0.009) and
invasion (P = 0.003) indices correlated positively with higher SBF indices. Additionally, motility
(100%, P < 0.001), H1 type flagellin (53.8%, P < 0.001), serogroups O83 (19.2%, P = 0.008) and O22
(26.9%, P = 0.001), the presence of virulence genes such as sfa/focDE (38.5%, P = 0.003) and ibeA
(26.9%, P = 0.017), and B2 phylotype (80.8%, P < 0.001) were frequent characteristics amongst
biofilm producers.
Conclusion: The principal contribution of the present work is the finding that biofilm formation
capacity is a novel, complementary pathogenic feature of the recently described AIEC pathovar.
Characterization of AIEC specific genetic determinants, and the regulatory pathways, involved in
biofilm formation will likely bring new insights into AIEC pathogenesis.

Background
Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic-relapsing inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) that can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract. The incidence rate varies from 1 to 20 cases per
105 people per year and is still rising in some countries [1].
Although the aetiology of CD remains elusive to date, it is
widely accepted that several factors are involved in the
onset or perpetuation of the disease. These factors include
genetic and immunologic features that confer host susceptibility, and external or environmental factors such as
microorganisms and lifestyle [2,3]. Environmental factors
play an important role because there is a low concordance
between identical twins, both for CD and ulcerative colitis
(UC) [4]. The involvement of microbes in the onset or
perpetuation of inflammation has been extensively studied [5-10]. To date, some pathogens have been proposed
as causative agents. In particular, adherent-invasive E. coli
(AIEC) is increasing in relevance because it has been
reported to be more prevalent in CD patients than in controls in several countries (France [11], United Kingdom
[12], USA [13,14], and Spain [15]). AIEC strains have the
ability to adhere to and to invade intestinal epithelial cells
in vitro as well as to survive and replicate within macrophages without inducing host-cell death and promoting
tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α release. No unique genetic
sequences have been described for AIEC, nor have specific
genes of diarrhoeagenic pathovars been detected yet for
AIEC, but they do carry many virulence-associated genes
characteristic of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC)
[13,15,16]. For that reason, AIEC pathovar has been speculated to be closely related to ExPEC pathovar.
In a previous work, we observed that some CD patients
showed a high diversity of AIEC subtypes associated to
their intestinal mucosa [15]. In a given patient, we could
detect up to 8 different clones as assessed by pulsed field
gel electrophoresis. On the other hand, AIEC abundance,
richness and diversity were lower in non-IBD controls. We
hypothesized that the higher diversification of clones
could be explained by a long-term colonization of AIEC in
CD. Biofilm formation can be a way to persistently colonize the intestinal mucosa [17], as has been reported for
commensal microbiota in healthy subjects [18]. Moreover, for certain organisms such as the species belonging to
the uropathogenic E. coli pathovar (UPEC) - which form
intracellular biofilms [19] - and to the enteroaggregative
pathogenic E. coli pathovar (EAEC) - which form thick
biofilms that adhere to the apical side of enterocytes [20], active biofilm formation is feature of their pathogenesis.
For that reason, the primarily aim of this work was to
determine the biofilm formation capacity of AIEC strains
and non-AIEC strains, both isolated from the intestinal
mucosa.
We herein report a new phenotypic feature of the recently
described AIEC pathovar which is the ability to form bio-

films in vitro. In addition, we illustrate those seropathotypes and phylotypes more frequently found amongst
biofilm producers.

Results
AIEC strains are stronger biofilm producers than non-AIEC
strains isolated from the intestinal mucosa
The present study involved a collection of 65 E. coli
strains, 27 of which (41.5%) were classified as AIEC by
their ability to adhere to and invade intestinal epithelial
cells, and to survive and replicate within macrophages, as
previously described [11] (Table 1).

Within the category of weak biofilm producers, 74.4% of
strains were non-AIEC, whereas 65.4% of moderate to
strong biofilm producers were AIEC (P = 0.002). Amongst
these AIEC strains, 22.2% were strong biofilm producers,
and 40.7% were moderate biofilm producers (Table 2).
Similar results were obtained when SBF index values were
compared. As shown in Figure 1, the mean SBF index was
higher in AIEC strains than in non-AIEC (SBFAIEC = 0.65 ±
0.53; SBFNON-AIEC = 0.36 ± 0.36; P = 0.012).
Interestingly, higher adhesion indices from both AIEC
and non-AIEC strains correlated with higher SBF indices
(P = 0.009). Moreover, the correlation was even stronger
between the invasion and biofilm formation capacities of
AIEC strains (P = 0.003). No correlation was observed
with the ability of AIEC strains to survive and replicate
within macrophages (Figure 2).
Nonmotile strains were unable to form biofilms and,
amongst motile strains, those with H1 flagellar type
showed the highest biofilm formation indices
An additional factor that was associated with biofilm formation was the motility of the strains. Regardless of adhesion and invasion abilities, motile strains showed higher
SBF indices than nonmotile strains (SBFMOTILE= 0.61 ±
0.48, SBFNONMOTILE = 0.14 ± 0.13; P < 0.001). All strains
producing moderate-strong biofilms were motile,
whereas strains classified as weak biofilm producers were
heterogeneous in their motility capacities. In concordance, the isogenic mutant LF82-ΔfliC which is nonmotile,
non-flagellated and express only few type 1 pili, did not
display the ability to form biofilms (SBF = 0,393 ± 0,084)
in contrast to LF82 wild type (SBF = 1.641 ± 0.326).

Moreover, SBF indices were specifically higher for the H1
serotype as shown in Figure 3. All H1 serotypes were moderate-strong biofilm producers. In contrast, only 12 out of
33 (36.4%) of strains with other H types were classified
within this category (Table 3).
To determine whether motility and AIEC-like phenotype
were intrinsically related factors, the frequency of motile
and nonmotile strains within AIEC and non-AIEC strains

Distribution of virulence-associated genes and
phylogroups within biofilm producers
Of the 65 E. coli strains used in this study, 45 (69.2%) harboured more than two virulence-associated genes in addition to fimH; thus, these strains are considered an
extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli according to the definition of Johnson et al [21]. Virulence-associated gene distribution was similar between biofilm producers
(moderate-strong) and non-biofilm producers (weak),
with the exception of adherence factor sfa/focDE (S or F1C
fimbriae) and the invasion-associated gene ibeA (Table 4),
which were more prevalent in biofilm-forming strains (P
= 0.003 and P = 0.017, respectively).

was calculated. Although the majority of AIEC strains
were motile (81.5%), no significant differences were
observed in comparison to non-AIEC strains (65.8%).
Moreover, no interaction among these factors was
detected by applying a factorial ANOVA. Therefore, motility and adherence/invasion capacity were independent
factors associated with biofilm formation.

Although the E. coli collection studied was mainly composed of B2 (52.3%) and D (20%) phylotypes, significant
differences were observed between the two categories of
biofilm producers. As shown in Table 4, the B2 phylogroup was more frequent in moderate-strong biofilm
forming strains (80.8% vs. 34.2%; P < 0.001), whereas A
and D phylogroups were more frequent within weak biofilm producers.

Discussion

Serogroups associated with higher biofilm producing
abilities
As shown in Figure 4, O83, followed by O22, showed the
highest mean SBF indices. Regardless the AIEC phenotype
and origin of the strains (intestinal or extraintestinal and
non-IBD or CD associated), all the strains of O22 and
O83 serogroup were found to be moderate-strong biofilm
producers.

In this work, we describe the biofilm formation capacity
of a recently described pathovar, adherent-invasive E. coli
(AIEC), which is associated with Crohn's disease. The
main result was that AIEC strains have stronger biofilm
formation abilities than other E. coli strains isolated from
the intestinal mucosa (non-AIEC). The latter share genotypic and phenotypic traits with AIEC [15] but lack the
properties described for the pathovar: (i) adhesion to and
invasion of intestinal epithelial cells in vitro, (ii) survival
and replication capacity within macrophages without
causing host-cell death, and (iii) induction of TNF-α
release [11]. We also analyzed the relationship between
biofilm formation, AIEC phenotype, serotype, and phylogroup, and the presence of virulence-associated genes.

Other serogroups with mean SBF that fell into the 'moderate' category were: O2, O6, O14, O18, O25, O159, and
O166. However, some strains that were unable to form
biofilms were detected amongst these serogroups. For
some serogroups such as O2 and O14 those strains classified as weak biofilm producers were particularly those
nonmotile O2/O14 strains. In turn, strains with weak to
strong biofilm formation abilities amongst the O6 strains
belonged to a certain serotype (O6:H31) and this serotype
was not present amongst the categories 'moderate' or
'strong' biofilm producers. Nevertheless, very few strains

As observed by other authors [22,23], motility was a crucial factor for biofilm formation because none of the nonmotile strains were able to form biofilms (Table 3). This
observation was further supported by the experiments
performed with the isogenic mutant LF82-ΔfliC. Moreover, all 14 strains with H1 flagellar antigen were moderatestrong biofilm producers, in contrast to 46.2% of motile
non-H1 types. Therefore, H1 flagellar antigen conferred,
either directly or indirectly, an advantageous trait to form
biofilms. Although motility was a necessary requirement
for biofilm formation, it was not sufficient; 21 out of 47

strain PP16) and two non-AIEC strains (ECG-009 (isolated from two different CD patients) and ECG-043 (isolated from one non-IBD control) [15].
Some associations between biofilm-formation potential
and some virulence-associated genes have been already
described [24,26-32]. In agreement with previous studies
[25], the adhesin-coding gene sfa/focDE was more frequently detected amongst biofilm producers. In addition,
the gene ibeA, required for invasion in meningitis/sepsisassociated E. coli (MNEC) [33,34], was more prevalent
amongst strong biofilm producers. Interestingly, ibeA, in
conjunction with fimH and fimAvMT78, are virulence factors present in AIEC strain LF82 [16,35].
Phylogenetic analyses have shown that E. coli strains fall
into four main phylogenetic groups (A, B1, B2, and D)
and that virulent ExPEC strains mainly belong to group B2
and, to a lesser extent, group D, whereas most commensal
strains belong to group A [33,36]. Although B2 was the
most abundant phylotype within the E. coli collection, B2
phylotypes were significantly more prevalent amongst
moderate-strong biofilm producers than weak biofilm
producers (P < 0.001), which were enriched in A and D
phylotypes (P = 0.052 and P = 0.006 respectively). Of
note, B2+D phylotypes are also more prevalent amongst
E. coli strains from patients with CD or ulcerative colitis
than in non-IBD controls [37].
The positive correlation between the levels of adhesion
and invasion and the higher SBF indices lead to postulate
that the machinery implicated to achieve the "AIEC phenotype" could share some factors necessary for biofilm
formation, such as type 1 pili and flagella. Another possibility is that both processes could be related to a coordinated expression, for instance, by the EnvZ/OmpR
regulatory system. Rohlion et al [38] recently proposed a
model in which OmpC, a porin regulated by EnvZ/

strains with O6:H1, O6:H5 and O6:HNT serotypes were 'moderate' or 'strong' biofilm producers. 4: Nonmotile ECG-054
(O14:H-) was 'weak' biofilm producer (W). 5: Three strains were 'moderate' (O22:H1) and 4 strains 'strong' (O22:H1,
O22:H7, and O22:H18) biofilm producers. 6: AIEC08 (O25:H4) was classified as 'weak' biofilm producer.

OmpR, has been implicated in the adherence-invasiveness of AIEC, and this system is also known to play an
important role in biofilm formation [39]. The biofilm formation could also be dependent on the cyclic di-GMP
concentration which was recently reported to regulate the
expression of type 1 pili and flagella in AIEC reference
strain LF82 [40].
Biofilms in the human gut are thought to play an agonistic
role with the host [18], being necessary to achieve an
homeostatic situation and appropriate gut physiology.
Nevertheless, previous studies have highlighted the
increased biofilm formation in patients with CD with
respect to control subjects [41]. Moreover, the composition of the mucosa-associated microbiota is altered with
respect to that of non-IBD controls [42]. It is widely
accepted that the intestinal microbiota is essential to elicit
the inflammation; however, the specific role of intestinal
biofilms in CD is still uncertain. Changes in the composition and abundance of mucosa-associated biofilms have
been proposed either to play a role in the onset or perpetuation of CD [41,43-45] or to be a consequence of the
defective immune regulation in CD patients [18,46,47].
Because we have analyzed the biofilm formation capacity
of a collection of AIEC and non-AIEC strains using an in
vitro method we can deduce that the ability of AIEC to
form biofilms is irrespective of host factors. However, in
vivo experiments would give interesting insights into the
pathogenesis of AIEC in CD. Biofilm formation of AIEC in

human gut, if confirmed, would confer to the pathovar an
advantage for colonization of the intestine. Consequently,
given the pathogenic behavior of AIEC, a more stable colonization would increase their probability of invading the
intestinal epithelium and further trigger mucosal inflammation and, possibly, granuloma formation. In this sense,
and speculatively, biofilm formation could contribute to
AIEC pathogenesis.

Conclusion
A novel phenotypic trait of AIEC pathovar was described
in this work. Biofilm production ability of AIEC strains
could be an additional trait involved in their pathogenesis. Further investigations to detect AIEC specific genetic
determinants involved in biofilm formation and to analyze the genetic regulatory processes are essential to fully
understand AIEC pathogenesis and elucidate a possible
role of AIEC in CD.

Methods
Bacterial strains
Amongst the collection of 65 E. coli strains, sixty-one
(93.8%) were isolated from human intestinal mucosa in
previous studies [15,48]. In particular, 35 strains (16 of
them were AIEC) came from CD patients, one (which
belonged to AIEC pathovar) came from a patient suffering
from ulcerative colitis, and 25 (of which 6 were AIEC)
came from non-IBD controls. Also included were four
additional AIEC strains that came from patients with

LF82 and the isogenic mutant LF82-ΔfliC were used as
controls. Relevant characteristics of the strains that were
known prior to this study are compiled in Table 1.
All procedures were approved by the ethics committee of
clinical investigation of the Hospital Josep Trueta of
Girona in compliance with the Helsinki declaration.

Biofilm formation assay
Biofilm formation assays were performed using a previously described method [26] with some modifications
[25]. Strains were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani broth
with 5 g l-1 of glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) at
35.5°C, then 1/100 dilutions were made in M63 minimal
medium (US Biological, Swampscott, USA) supplemented with 8 g l-1 (0.8%) glucose. Then, 130-μl aliquots
were placed in wells of non-cell-treated polystyrene

microtiter plates (Greiner Bio-one, Stuttgart, Germany)
and incubated overnight at 30°C without shaking. Afterwards, growth optical densities (OD) were read at 630
nm; then the wells were washed once, adhered bacteria
were stained with 1% crystal violet solubilised in ethanol,
and ODs read at 570 nm. Biofilm measurements were calculated using the formula SBF = (AB-CW)/G, in which SBF
is the specific biofilm formation, AB is the OD570 nm of the
attached and stained bacteria, CW is the OD570 nm of the
stained control wells containing only bacteria-free
medium (to eliminate unspecific or abiotic OD values),
and G is the OD630 nm of cell growth in broth [51,52]. For
each assay, 16 wells per strain were analyzed, and the
assays were performed in triplicate, which resulted in a
total of 48 wells per each tested strain and control. The
degree of biofilm production was classified in three categories: weak (SBF ≤ 0.5), moderate (0.5 > SBF ≤ 1), and
strong (SBF > 1).
Adhesion and invasion assays in epithelial cells Intestine407
The epithelial cell line Intestine-407 was used for adhesion and invasion assays (ATCC accession number CCL6™). Cell culture was performed as described previously
[48]. To quantify adhesion and invasion properties, a gentamicin protection assay were performed as previously
described [48]. Briefly, 24-well plates containing 4×105
cells/well incubated for 20 hours were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Duplicated plates, for adhesion
and invasion assays were incubated for 3 hours at 37°C.
For bacterial adhesion assays, cell monolayers were
washed 5 times with PBS and lysed with 1% Triton X-100.
Adhered bacteria were quantified by plating them in
nutrient agar. Plating was performed in a maximum
period of 30 minutes to avoid bacterial lysis by Triton X100. Adherence ability (I_ADH) was determined as the
mean number of bacteria per cell. For bacterial invasion
assays, monolayers were washed twice with PBS after 3
hours of infection, and fresh cell culture medium containing 100 μg ml-1 of gentamicin was added for 1 hour to kill
extracellular bacteria. After cell lysis with 1% Triton X100, the number of intracellular bacteria was also determined by plating. All assays were performed in triplicate.
The invasive ability was expressed as the percentage of
intracellular E. coli compared with the initial inoculum,
taken as 100%: I_INV (%) = (intracellular bacteria/4×106
bacteria inoculated) × 100.
Survival and replication in macrophages J774
The macrophage-like J774A.1 cell line (ATCC accession
number TIB-67™) was used as a model for E. coli survival
and replication assays. Cell culture was performed as
described previously [53]. E. coli isolates with known
adherence and invasion properties were then checked for
their capability to survive and replicate inside macro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/202

phages as previously described [11]. Macrophages were
seeded at 2×105 cells per well in two 24-well plates and
incubated for 20 hours. Once overnight medium was
removed and fresh medium was added, bacteria were
seeded at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Centrifugation
at 900 rpm for 10 minutes, plus an additional incubation
at 37°C for 10 minutes, was performed to assist the internalization of bacteria within macrophages. Non-phagocytosed bacteria were killed with gentamicin (20 μg ml-1),
and intracellular bacteria were quantified as for invasion
assays after 1 and 24 hours of infection. All assays were
performed in triplicate. Results were expressed as the
mean percentage of the number of bacteria recovered after
1 and 24 h post-infection compared with the initial inoculum, taken as 100%: I_REPL (%) = (cfu ml-1 at 24 h/cfu
ml-1 at 1 h)× 100. Those strains with I_INV > 0.1 and
I_REPL > 100% were classified as AIEC in this study.
Serotyping
Determination of O and H antigens was carried out using
the method previously described by Guinée et al. [54].
Strains which failed to achieve motility on semisolid
medium were considered nonmotile and designated H-.
Phylotyping and virulence genotyping by PCR
Determination of the major E. coli phylogenetic group (A,
B1, B2, and D) was performed as previously described by
Clermont et al [36].

Virulence gene carriage was analyzed as described elsewhere [25,55] using primers specific for 11 genes that
encode extraintestinal virulence factors characteristic of
ExPEC. These included six adhesins (pyelonephritis-associated pili (papC), S and F1C fimbriae (sfa/focDE), afimbrial Dr-binding adhesins (afa/draBC), type 1 fimbriae
(fimH), and type 1 variant of avian pathogenic E. coli
strain MT78 (fimAvMT78)); three toxins (hlyA, cnf1, and
cdtB); and one aerobactin gene (iucD). They also included
two protectin/invasion-encoding genes that corresponded
to K1 kps variant (neuC) and brain microvascular endothelial cell invasion gene (ibeA). Specific genes for diarrhoeagenic E. coli pathovars were also screened (stx1, stx2, eae,
bfpA, ipaH, pCDV432, eltA, and est).
Statistical analyses
Quantitative parameters, such as SBF, adhesion, and invasion indices were compared by one-way ANOVA. In cases
for which the interaction between several factors was of
interest, a factorial ANOVA was applied. Correlation
between quantitative variables was assessed by Pearson
correlation coefficient. Fisher's exact test (small contingency tables) or Pearson's X2 tests (frequencies higher
than five within cells) were used to measure the significance of frequency values.
