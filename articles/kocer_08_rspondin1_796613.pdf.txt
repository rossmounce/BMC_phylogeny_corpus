Abstract
Background: Up to now, two loci have been involved in XX sex-reversal in mammals following
loss-of-function mutations, PIS (Polled Intersex Syndrome) in goats and R-spondin1 (RSPO1) in
humans. Here, we analyze the possible interaction between these two factors during goat gonad
development. Furthermore, since functional redundancy between different R-spondins may
influence gonad development, we also studied the expression patterns of RSPO2, 3 and 4.
Results: Similarly to the mouse, RSPO1 shows a sex-dimorphic expression pattern during goat
gonad development with higher levels in the ovaries. Interestingly, the PIS mutation does not seem
to influence its level of expression. Moreover, using an RSPO1 specific antibody, the RSPO1 protein
was localized in the cortical area of early differentiating ovaries (36 and 40 dpc). This cortical area
contains the majority of germ cell that are surrounded by FOXL2 negative somatic cells. At latter
stages (50 and 60 dpc) RSPO1 protein remains specifically localized on the germ cell membranes.
Interestingly, a time-specific relocation of RSPO1 on the germ cell membrane was noticed, moving
from a uniform distribution at 40 dpc to a punctuated staining before and during meiosis (50 and
60 dpc respectively). Interestingly, also RSPO2 and RSPO4 show a sex-dimorphic expression pattern
with higher levels in the ovaries. Although RSPO4 was found to be faintly and belatedly expressed,
the expression of RSPO2 increases at the crucial 36 dpc stage, as does that of FOXL2. Importantly,
RSPO2 expression appears dramatically decreased in XX PIS-/- gonads at all three tested stages (36,
40 and 50 dpc).
Conclusion: During goat ovarian development, the pattern of expression of RSPO1 is in
agreement with its possible anti-testis function but is not influenced by the PIS mutation. Moreover,
our data suggest that RSPO1 may be associated with germ cell development and meiosis.
Interestingly, another RSPO gene, RSPO2 shows a sex-dimorphic pattern of expression that is
dramatically influenced by the PIS mutation.

Background
In most mammals, gonad differentiation depends on the
presence or absence of the SRY gene, the sex-determining
region of Y chromosome [1]. SRY encodes an HMG
domain protein that is sufficient to switch on the testisdifferentiating pathway [2-4]. Following SRY expression,
specifically in the future supporting cells of the XY bipotential gonad, SOX9 remains up-regulated and Sertoli cell
differentiation occurs [5]. The crucial role of SOX9 in testis differentiation has been demonstrated by gain and loss
of function mutations in mice [6-9]. Acting with the transcription factor SOX9 is the diffusible growth factor FGF9
shown to be involved in SOX9 expressional maintenance,
XY-specific cell migration from the mesonephros into the
gonad and germ cell survival in the fetal testis [10-12].
In the XX female counterpart, the repression of the testisdifferentiating pathway seems to be part of the molecular
events leading to ovarian differentiation. Indeed, in
human and domestic animals, XX male phenotypes can
result from homozygous mutations in anti-testis genes
specifically expressed in ovaries [13]. In mouse, the
secreted protein Wnt4 antagonizes the testis specific genes
Sox9/Fgf9, behaving as an anti-testis molecule [10].
Although some male features appear in XX Wnt4-/- mice,
such as a testis-specific coelomic vessel and testosterone
production, XX sex-reversal is not completely achieved
[14,15]. Up to now, two loci have been proved to be associated with complete XX sex-reversal, PIS in goat [16] and
more recently, RSPO1 in human [17].
In goat, the PIS (Polled Intersex Syndrome) mutation
gives rise to an absence of horns in heterozygous and
homozygous animals of both sexes (dominant trait) and
to a female-to-male sex-reversal in XX homozygous animals (recessive trait) [18]. Testis differentiation in XX PIS/- animals occurs very precociously during fetal life (SOX9
and AMH up-regulation occur between 36 and 40 dpc),
with a ~4 days delay compared to XY males and affects primarily the supporting cells of the gonads [19]. In normal
XY gonads, SOX9 and AMH up-regulation occur between
34 and 36 dpc. During this period, FOXL2 and CYP19
transcriptions begin to be detectable in normal XX gonads
[19]. From a genetic point of view, this goat syndrome is
due to an autosomal deletion of 11.7 kb localized on goat
chromosome 1 [16,20]. This deletion encompasses elements enhancing the ovarian transcription of at least three
genes: FOXL2 encoding a transcription factor, PFOXic and
PISRT1, two non-coding RNAs [21,22]. All these genes are
expressed from the first stage of ovarian differentiation to
adulthood in normal XX PIS+/+ and PIS+/- gonads. Their
expression is lost in XX PIS-/- sex-reversed gonads [16,22].
Interestingly, XX Foxl2-/- mice show an early disruption of
folliculogenesis that recapitulates a phenotype of Premature Ovarian Failure (POF) also encountered in XX BPES

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/36

type I patients (Blepharophimosis Ptosis Epicanthus
inversus Syndrome, MIM#110100) carrying a heterozygous mutation of the FOXL2 gene [23-26]. The phenotype discrepancy of the ovarian FOXL2/Foxl2 loss of
function mutations between goat and mouse can be either
due to the complexity of the goat PIS mutation that affects
other genes than FOXL2 or to species-specific differences
in the ovarian differentiating pathway.
More recently in human, homozygous mutations of the Rspondin1 gene (RSPO1) have been shown to be responsible for XX sex-reversal associated with skin defects, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis (PPK) and predisposition to
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) [17]. R-spondin1 is a
member of a recently identified small gene family of
secreted molecules potentially acting via the FZD/LRP
receptors (Frizzled/LDL receptor-related protein); a pathway previously described for the WNT secreted factors
[27,28]. Binding to these FZD/LRP receptors induces betacatenin accumulation in the cytoplasm and eventually its
nuclear translocation where it is engaged in gene activation through its association with T-cell factor (TCF) transcription factors [29].
In this study, the expression profiles of the four R-spondin
members was determined during the development of goat
gonads. Their expression was also assessed in XX sexreversed PIS-/- gonads at different developmental stages.
Surprisingly, expression of RSPO2 seems more sensitive
than that of RSPO1 to PIS sex-reversal. Moreover, using a
RSPO1-specific antibody [30], we show that goat RSPO1
is localized in the cortical part of the developing ovary
where most of the germ cells lies.

Results
Goat RSPO1 cDNA characterization and phylogenic
conservation
The entire open reading frame of goat RSPO1 cDNA [GenBank: EF486267] has been isolated by RT-PCR with primers (Spondin-ATG1bis and Spondin-TAG) derived from
regions of the bovine sequence that are highly conserved
in human. In order to determine the initiation start site
and the promoter used in the female gonad, 5'-RACE
experiments were carried out on 45 dpc goat ovaries
mRNA. A unique initiation site has been found 349 bp
upstream of the conserved ATG initiator codon (Fig. 1a).
This initiation start site lies just downstream of a 10-bp
polyG-tail that is present in goat genomic DNA [GenBank:
EF486271] and no transcript 5' to this polyG-tail were
detected despite several attempts. Thus, surprisingly, the
goat ovarian transcript does not use the conserved AG
acceptor splicing site, located 303 bp upstream of the ATG
as observed in bovine (n = 2) and human (n = 2) (Fig. 1a).
Consequently, in 45 dpc goat ovaries the first exon of the
RSPO1 gene includes the ATG initiator codon, whereas in

human and bovine, the exon encompassing the first
codon can be exon2, 3 or 4, depending on the number of
RSPO1 untranslated 5' exons (Fig. 1a). In conclusion, the
precise location of the promoter of the RSPO1 gene
appears to be variable due to the potential existence of different tissue-specific promoting regions [see Additional
file 1].
In order to confirm that the goat RSPO1 cDNA sequence
corresponds to the correct R-spondin gene, a phylogenetic
tree was built with several sequences of the R-spondin family belonging to different mammalian species. The NJ tree
built with the four R-spondin genes, belonging to seven
mammalian species, is depicted in Fig. 1b. As expected,
the goat RSPO1 sequence characterized in this work,
belongs to the RSPO1 cluster, being more closely related
with the bovine sequence.
The sequence of the PCR products obtained for the three
other R-spondin genes have been determined and compared with the bovine and human genomes to ascertain
their affiliation [GenBank: EF486268, EF486269,
EF486270, for RSPO2, 3 and 4, respectively].
R-Spondin gene expression in normal goat gonad
development
R-spondin gene expression profiles were determined during goat gonad development by RT-PCR with specific
primers (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Interestingly, both RSPO1
and RSPO2 show a female-specific expressional profile
from the crucial 36 dpc stage to adulthood, as observed for
FOXL2. However, some slight differences exist between
RSPO1 and RSPO2 gene regulation. Firstly, each gene
reaches its higher level of expression at different developmental stages, before germ cell meiosis (55 dpc) for
RSPO1 and at the time of follicle formation for RSPO2
(from 70 dpc until before birth). Secondly, in contrast to
what observed in mice, our data suggest that RSPO1 is
also expressed in both male and female mesonephroi [see
Additional files 1 and 2].

RSPO3 is similarly expressed in XX and XY gonads while
RSPO4 was faintly expressed from 50 to 90 dpc, with a
female-specific sex-dimorphic pattern.
R-Spondin gene expression in XX sex-reversed goat
gonads
In order to understand if the PIS mutation affects the pattern of expression of RSPO1 or of the other R-spondin
genes during gonadal differentiation, the expression profiles of the four R-spondin genes were determined in sexreversed versus normal gonads. We have previously
shown that the crucial stages in the goat sex-reversal
pathology are between 36 and 40 dpc [19]. Briefly, at 36
dpc, even if no sex-reversal defect can be noticed by histol-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/36

ogy on XX PIS-/- gonads, a dramatic decrease of CYP19
gene expression is detectable. CYP19 has been identified
as a direct ovarian-specific target of FOXL2 [31]. At 40 dpc,
SOX9 and AMH expressions have increased and masculinization is clearly detectable by histology [19].
Interestingly, even if RSPO1 expression seems to be
slightly decreased in XX PIS-/- gonads at 36 dpc, its level of
expression in XX sex-reversed gonads remains comparable
to that seen in normal female at 40 dpc (Fig. 3). In contrast, RSPO2 expression appears to be significantly lower
in XX sex-reversed gonads compared to XX normal ovaries
at all three tested stages (36, 40 and 50 dpc). Indeed,
RSPO2 mRNA levels are similar to those detected in XY
control male testes (Fig. 3). Interestingly, at 50 dpc, a faint
but higher mRNA levels of RSPO1 and RSPO2 can be
detected in sex-reversed gonads from XX male with genital
ambiguities (N°450) as compared to those of fully masculinized XX or XY males. Although 50% of XX PIS-/- sexreversed gonad develops as testes inducing complete masculinization of the external genitalia, the remaining 50%
develops as ovo-testis associated with external genital
ambiguities [19,32,33]. It is thus tempting to speculate
that the remaining detectable RSPO1 and RSPO2 expression comes from the ovarian part of these hermaphrodite
XX PIS-/- gonads.
As described above, RSPO3 appears to be ubiquitously
expressed and not affected by the PIS mutation. At 50 dpc,
RSPO4 begins to be very faintly expressed specifically in
normal ovaries, but not in XX sex-reversed or XY testes
(Fig. 3).
Immunodetection of RSPO1 protein in transfected COS7
cells
RSPO1 transcript analysis revealed that goat mRNA contains two possible starting codons (ATG1 and ATG15) that
may produce proteins with or without a signal peptide,
respectively. In order to establish the stability and cellular
sub-localization of the two putative proteins, we produced two constructs, one containing both potential initiation codons (ATG1 and ATG15), and the other retaining
only the ATG15 (Fig. 4a). In order to evaluate the specificity of anti-hRSPO1 (Nu-206) antibody (provided by Dr
K-A Kim) in goat, both immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed on COS7 cells transfected (or
not) with RSPO1 cDNA constructs (Fig. 4).

Nu-206 anti-hRSPO1 antibody appeared to be highly specific since no signal was detected in non-transfected cells
(Fig. 4b, 4c). Double immunofluorescence studies were
carried out for RSPO1 and PDI (Protein Disulphide Isomerase), an abundant soluble resident protein of the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [34]. As expected, the fulllength protein RSPO1-ATG1 was localized both in the ER

first ATG codon was missing (RSPO1-ATG15) the resulting
protein was detected in the nucleus, highlighting the efficiency of the putative nuclear localization signal (Fig. 4b).
By Western blot analyses, a 25 kDa protein was detected
as expected on protein extracts of COS7 cell transfected
with the full-lenght RSPO1 cDNA (Fig. 4c). Bands of
higher molecular mass were also visible suggesting posttranslational modifications of the protein. Moreover, the
RSPO1-ATG1 protein was detected in the culture medium
when heparin is added, and the secreted form corre-

sponds to the most post-translationally modified one
(highest molecular mass).
Ovarian localization of RSPO1 at different developmental
stages
To obtain highlight on the function of RSPO1 during goat
ovarian development, we studied its cellular and sub-cellular localization at three critical stages of gonad development, 36, 40 and 50 dpc, and compared with those of
FOXL2 and c-Kit. At the earliest 36–40 dpc stages, RSPO1
was found to be mainly localized in the cortical area of the

female gonads (illustrated at 40 dpc, Fig. 5a). At these
stages, FOXL2 positive cells were mainly localized in the
ovarian sub-cortical region. Interestingly, the cortical
RSPO1 positive area contains the majority of the germ
cells that express c-Kit; but RSPO1 appears localized
around both somatic and germinal cells (Fig 5a). Sub-cellular localization of RSPO1 was within the cell membrane, resembling those of c-Kit. At 50 dpc, the strongest
RSPO1 specific signal was found around the germ cells,
that are easily recognizable by their round and voluminous nuclei (Fig 5b). Double immunofluorescence experiments carried out for RSPO1 and c-Kit confirm the
localization of both proteins on germ cell membranes
(Fig. 6a). Moreover, in situ hybridization performed on 45
dpc ovaries shows that both somatic and germinal cells
expressed the RSPO1 gene (Fig 6b). Intriguingly, at the 50
dpc stage, RSPO1 protein shows a punctuated staining
that is not visible at the 40 dpc stage (Fig. 5 and Fig. 7).
Interestingly at the 50 dpc stage, RSPO1 staining appears
quite similar to those obtained with anti-WNT4 and antiβ-catenin specific antibodies (Fig. 6c). On another hand,
no RSPO1 staining has been observed on male gonads of
the same stages, but epithelial cells of the mesonephros
has been found positively stained [see Additional file 2].
RSPO1 localization in XX sex-reversed gonads at 50 dpc
In order to get a better understanding of the different levels of RSPO1 expression between XX male with ambiguities (N°450) and XX male without ambiguity (N°454)
noticed in RT-PCR experiments, RSPO1 protein localization was analyzed on gonadal sections of both fetuses (Fig

7a,7b). AMH and c-Kit detections clearly show that testis
from the "pure" XX male is more developed than those of
the XX male with ambiguities; seminiferous tubules are
more differentiated and delineated and there are more cKit positive Leydig cells in testis of 454 compared with
those of 450 (Fig 7a). Interestingly, RSPO1 staining specifically remains on isolated germ cell (N°454) or on germ
cell colonies (N°450) located in the cortical region, outside the testicular sub-cortical area. Accordingly with the
differences noticed on RSPO1 mRNA levels, the number
of germ cell colonies located outside the seminiferous
tubules is clearly increased in the 450 gonad as compared
with the 454 one (Fig. 7a). On these germ cell colonies,
the punctuated RSPO1 staining remains evident and
clearer than in ovaries where the cellular density is higher.
Using confocal microscopy, the punctuated staining
appears as patches located on the germ cell membranes,
with many small patches and one or two big patches (~1
µm) per cell (Fig. 7b). A similar RSPO1 punctuated staining was observed on germ cells lying in the cortical part of
normal ovaries, before (50 dpc) and during (60 dpc) meiosis (Fig. 5b and Fig. 7c).

Discussion
RSPO1 protein structure
An intriguing structural feature of all R-Spondin proteins
is to display an N-terminal signal peptide and a conserved
C-terminal putative nuclear localization signal. Thus,
although these proteins have been reported to function as
secreted molecules acting on receptors located across the
cell membranes [28,29], they might also localize in the

RT-PCR3expression analyses of R-spondin genes in XX PIS-/- sex-reversed goat gonads
RT-PCR expression analyses of R-spondin genes in XX PIS-/- sex-reversed goat gonads. Expression profiles of
FOXL2 and the four R-spondin genes were determined at 3 developmental stages (36, 40 and 50 dpc) in XX sex-reversed
gonads (XX Males) in comparison with normal males and females ones. GAPDH was used as control. The name of the amplified gene and the number of PCR cycles done is given on the left margin. Samples are from individual fetuses (identified by their

the C-terminal basic domain is not a nuclear localization
signal but plays a functional role in the secreted proteins,
or that R-spondin isoforms lacking the N-terminal signal
peptide do exist and play a role in the nucleus. Interestingly, a minor isoform, coding for a protein lacking the
signal peptide has been reported in humans but not in
mice [17]. Here we show that the goat RSPO1 transcript
presents an in frame ATG codon located fifteen amino
acids downstream of the initiator codon. Remarkably,
human RSPO2, 3, 4 genes also present a second putative
initiator codon at positions 16 or 17, and these second
ATG are conserved in different mammals (mouse, rat,
cow, dog and monkeys).

In order to establish the stability and cellular sub-localization of both putative proteins, we produced and analyzed
by cell transfection two constructs with or without the signal peptide. The ATG1 construct encodes a secreted RSPO1
protein associated with the cell surface, probably and as
previously described by other by binding heparin sulfate
proteoglycans on the plasma membrane and extracellular
matrix [28,36]. Indeed, we detected goat RSPO1 in the
culture medium of transfected COS7 cells only after
heparin addition (Fig. 4c). By contrast, the goat RSPO1
protein translated from the second putative initiator
codon (ATG15) is found in the nucleus of transfected
COS7 cells (Fig. 4b), as previously shown for a mouse
FLAG-tagged Rspo1 protein [37]. According to this feature, the synthesis of R-spondin proteins without a signal
peptide located in the nucleus cannot be excluded. Either
these putative isoforms could arise from a translational

event that uses the second initiator codon, or from differential splicing events as described for the human RSPO1
gene [17]. Nevertheless, a role of these R-spondin proteins
within the nuclear compartment remains to be demonstrated in vivo. Indeed, in our present studies on goat
gonads, RSPO1 protein was never detected in the nucleus.
RSPO1 is not downstream of FOXL2 in ovarian
differentiation
Homozygous mutations of RSPO1 have been found to be
responsible for an XX sex-reversed phenotype in human
[17]. The only other reported loss-of-function mutation
leading to XX sex-reversal in mammals is the PIS mutation
in goat. The PIS regulatory mutation leads to a transcriptional silencing of at least three genes in goat ovaries,
FOXL2, PFOXic and PISRT1 [16,22]. FOXL2 is the unique
classical PIS-regulated gene and encodes for a transcription factor responsible for BPES in heterozygous mutated
patients (Blepharophimosis Ptosis Epicanthus inversus
Syndrome, MIM#110100) [25]. Intriguingly, both
RSPO1, FOXL2 and PIS mutations are also associated with
failure of epithelium differentiation at different specific
position, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis in RSPO1-/patients, eyelids malformation in FOXL2+/- patients and
hornless in PIS-/- goats. Another common feature is the
absence of obvious testicular phenotype in XY
homozygous mutants [16,17,21].

The major objective of this study was to establish if the PIS
mutation influence the pattern of expression of RSPO1
during ovarian differentiation. By using both RT-PCR and
immuno fluorescence, we have shown that transcription
of RSPO1 is not regulated by FOXL2 or other PIS-regulated genes. RSPO1 expression is not affected at 40 dpc
when masculinization occurs in XX sex-reversed gonads.
In addition, RSPO1 positive cells are located in the ovarian cortex, a region where FOXL2 is not expressed at 40
dpc. It is thus possible that either FOXL2 and RSPO1
belong to two different ovarian pathways, or that FOXL2
expression is regulated by RSPO1. Mouse carrying null
mutations for Rspo1 will probably clarify this last point,
but until now, as no eyelids phenotype has been shown in
human RSPO1-/- patients, it seems improbable that
RSPO1 regulates FOXL2. Consequently, the RSPO1 antitestis action is likely to be independent from the FOXL2
one, suggesting that different anti-testes genes act in different cell types to ensure proper ovarian differentiation
and maintenance. Ottolenghi and collaborators have
recently exposed this theoretical view [38], reinforced by
the present study and by their recent results on mice carrying null alleles for both Foxl2 and Wnt4 genes [39].
Relationships between RSPO1 and the WNT genes
It has been proposed that R-spondins may synergize with
the WNT proteins, both acting through the β-catenin

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/36

pathway [29]. Among the WNT family, WNT4 has been
shown to be an important factor for gonad differentiation
[14,40,41]. Interestingly in our model, RSPO1 and WNT4
expressional profiles are similar. Their levels of expression
are not decreased in 40 dpc XX PIS-/- gonads, and remain
detectable in sex-reversed gonads of XX male with ambiguities compared to those of XX male without ambiguity,
at 50 or 56 dpc [19]. Moreover, WNT4 protein distribution
on goat gonads appeared highly similar to that of RSPO1,
being present in the cortical area in early 36–40 dpc stages
(not shown), and mainly associated with the germ cell
membranes at the 50 dpc stage (Fig. 6c). Although these
two genes seem to belong to the same anti-testis pathway,
their molecular mechanisms of action could be slightly
different. Indeed, a recent study on HEK-293 cells demonstrated that Rspo1 regulates Wnt signaling by acting on the
co-receptor LRP6 levels on the cell surface [42]. Accordingly, no relocation of WNT4 protein has been observed
at the germ cell surface (Fig 6c).
RSPO2 is a candidate gene for ovarian differentiation
Interestingly, we found that another R-spondin gene,
RSPO2 has a female specific sex-dimorphic expression
pattern and that its expression is affected in XX PIS-/gonads. RSPO2 expression level decreases as early as 36
dpc and remains low at 40 and 50 dpc, a situation highly
similar to that observed for the CYP19 gene previously
shown to be a direct target of FOXL2 in goat and tilapia
[19,31,43]. These results suggest that RSPO2 could represent a direct target of FOXL2 in early developing goat ovaries. Although RSPO2 ovarian localization and RSPO2
promoter studies are needed to assess a putative direct
transcriptional activation of RSPO2 by FOXL2, RSPO2 can
be considered as a good candidate gene for premature
ovarian failure and XX sex-reversal in human.

Conclusion
The present study brings evidences that RSPO1 could have
a role correlated with germ cell differentiation and maintenance before and during meiosis. If the first ovarian differentiation failure occurs on the germ cell lineage in
human XX RSPO1-/- sex-reversed patients, the physiopathology of this disease will be clearly different from those
observed in XX PIS-/- sex-reversed goats, for which the primary defect has been localized on supporting cells [19].
By contrast, XX sex-reversal in pigs seems to be linked to a
failure of the germ cell maintenance [44] and could result
from a mutational event in a gene belonging to the R-spondin or WNT pathways. Conclusively, it becomes now
more evident that different somatic cellular types exist in
early differentiating goat ovaries and that different antitestis pathways should be active in these different cell
types in order to ensure proper ovarian differentiation.

Methods
Animals
Procedures for handling animals were conducted in compliance with the guidelines for Care and Use of Agricultural Animals in Agricultural Research and Teaching
(authorization no. 78-34). All goat fetuses were obtained
from horned pregnant females, following hormonal treatments as previously described [19]. Sex-reversed XX males
were obtained by crossing two heterozygous polled parents, then testing the absence of the PIS region by PCR as
previously described [16]. Day 0 post-coïtum corresponds
to the day of mating. The genetic sex of all fetuses was
determined by PCR amplification of SRY and ZFY/ZFX
genes, on liver genomic DNA [19]. For each fetus, one
gonad was frozen in liquid nitrogen for expressional analyses; the other one was fixed for immuno-histological
studies.
RT-PCR
RNA extraction, DNase treatment, and cDNA synthesis
were conducted as previously described [16]. One-twentieth (1 µl, corresponding to 0.25 µg of reverse transcribed
total RNA) of each RT mix was amplified in 25 µl of PCR
reaction by using 0.25 U of Taq polymerase (TaKaRa), 200
µM of each dNTP, and 150 nM of each primer. PCR conditions and primer sequences are given in Table 1. After
amplification, 10 µl of each sample were separated by
electrophoresis on agarose-TBE gels. All RT-PCR experiments have been done in triplicate.
Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'RACE)
To determine the RSPO1 transcriptional start site, four 5'
RACE experiments were carried out, each on 5 µg of
DNase-treated total RNA purified from 45 or 50 dpc goat
ovaries (2 samples per developmental stage). Reverse
transcription of RSPO1 specific RNA was done by using
the primer Spondin-2 (Table 1). Reverse transcription
assays, then PCR amplifications were performed by using
the 5'RACE System from GibcoBRL, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, two rounds of PCR using
nested primers were carried out. The first round of PCR
was done with Spondin-3, the second round with either
Spondin-6 or Spondin-5 (Table 1). PCR products
obtained after the second round of PCR and showing a
106 bp difference in size (which is the length present
between the 2 primers used, Spondin-6 and Spondin-5)
were cloned. Then, at least 3 independent clones per PCR
product were sequenced.
Genbank accession numbers
All the sequencing was done by MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg
– Germany). Genomic DNA sequences are derived from
goat BAC sub-clones. R-spondin cDNAs were obtained
after PCR, then cloned in pGEMR-T Easy vector from
Promega. All sequences can be found in Genbank with the

EF486269 (RSPO3 mRNA, partial), EF486270 (RSPO4
mRNA, partial), EF486271 (RSPO1 gene, 5' sequence).
Phylogenetic analysis
Goat RSPO1 ORF sequence attained in the present study
was compared with the four R-spondin genes from seven
mammalian species (Human, Chimpanzee, Rhesus monkey, Cow, Dog, Mouse and Rat) available on NCBI and
Ensembl databases. Sequences comparison and alignment were performed using ClustalW [45] implemented
in BioEdit 7.0.5 [46]. Accession numbers are given below.
Genetic distances were calculated according to Tamura 3parameter substitution model with heterogeneous pattern
among lineages and uniform rates among sites [47]. A
Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree was built from the genetic distances matrix [48]. Consistency of each node was estimated by bootstrap test after 5000 replicates. Genetic
distances and phylogenetic analysis were conducted using
MEGA 3.1 [49].

Plasmids construction, COS7 cell culture conditions and
transfection assays
Two different goat RSPO1 cDNAs were obtained after RTPCR on a 50 dpc ovary with primers (SpondinATG1bis or
SpondinATG2 and SpondinTGA). Both, (pSG5-ATG1,
pSG5-ATG15), were inserted in the pSG5 vector (Stratagene). COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified
Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (Eurobio,
Courtaboeuf, France) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated foetal calf serum, penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml) and L-glutamine (300 µg/ml), in a 5%
CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. For transfection, 2 × 105 cells
were seeded in 60 mm diameter petri dishes and trans-

fected the following day using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche),
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Before transfection, the medium was changed by the serum free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12
medium added with soluble heparin (50 µg/ml, Sigma H1027). The amount of transfected DNA was 4 µg for either
expression vectors (pSG5-ATG1, pSG5-ATG15). Seventytwo hours after transfection, cells were harvested by scraping in 1 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pelleted by
centrifugation and rapidly frozen at -80°C until use. The
culture mediums were recovered and concentrated with a
VIVASPIN 6 ml Concentrator (VIVASCIENCE).
Cytosolic and nuclear protein extracts
The cell pellets were recovered in extraction buffer (20
mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, and
10% glycerol) containing protease and phosphatase
inhibitors. Cell lysis was performed by adding Nonidet P40 (IGEGAL CA-630) at a final concentration of 0.5% (v/
v) to the cell suspensions. After homogenization and a
brief incubation at 4°C for 5 min, the mixtures were gently layered onto 6 ml separation buffer A (10 mM HEPES
(pH 7.7), 25 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA (pH 8),
containing 1 M sucrose). After centrifugation (15 min. at
3500 RPM) the supernatant fraction containing cytosolic
protein extract was recovered. The pellet containing
nuclear protein extract were resuspended in buffer B (20
mM HEPES (pH 7.7), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 25%
glycerol), then cleared by addition of 4 M NaCl (1/10
final volume), mixed gently on a rotating wheel (30 min.
at 4°C), and centrifugated (30 min. at 12,000 rpm).
Finally supernatants containing nuclear extracts were frozen at -80°C until use. Proteins were quantified with a
BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Chemical Co., Bezons,
France) according to the manufacturer's protocol with
BSA as standard.
Western Blot
Forty µg of protein extracts (cytosolic, nuclear or culture
medium) were boiled in Laemmli buffer and subjected to
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).
Proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, GE Healthcare). Membranes were
blocked (1 h at room temperature) in PBS with 10% powdered milk, 0.3% Tween 20, then incubated with a primary antibody anti-RSPO1 (1/5000, overnight at 4°C)
[30]. After 3 washes in PBS, 0.3% Tween 20, membranes
were incubated with the secondary antibody anti-rabbit
coupled to peroxidase (1/6000, 40 min. at room temperature; Jackson Immunoresearch Lab.). After 4 washes, the
targeted proteins were revealed by peroxidase activity and
detected by chemiluminescent (SuperSignal West Pico,
PIERCE).

Immuno-fluorescence on COS7 cells
COS7 cells were grown on glass coverslips, then fixed in
the culture petri dishes with 4% paraformaldehyde in
phosphate saline buffer (PBS) for 10 min. After 4 washes
in PBS, samples were incubated 30 min. with NH4Cl (50
mM) in PBS, then permeabilized with 0.5% saponine, 1%
BSA in PBS for 1 h. Samples were incubated overnight at
4°C with the RSPO1 (1/300) and PDI (1/200) primary
antibodies [30,34]. After 3 washes in PBS, samples were
incubated with the secondary antibodies, anti-rabbit IgG
coupled with FITC (1/200, Vector) and anti-mouse IgG
coupled with TRITC (1/400, Jackson Immunoresearch
lab.) for 45 min at room temperature. Samples were
washed in PBS and mounted in Vectashield mounting
medium with DAPI (VECTOR). Cells were observed with
a Leica DMRB epifluorescence microscope. Acquisition
was performed using a DP50 CCD camera (Olympus).
Immuno-fluorescence on goat ovarian sections
Freshly dissected gonads were fixed 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4°C. After washes in PBS with increasing
concentrations of sucrose (0, 12%, 15%, and 18%), tissue
specimens were embedded in Jung Tissue Freezing
Medium (Leica Instruments) and frozen at -80°C. Cryosections (7 µm thick) were obtained and stored at -80°C.
After thawing, sections were washed 10 min. in PBS, and
quenched in 50 mM NH4Cl for 30 min. in PBS, then
blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (1% BSA, 0.5% Saponine in PBS). Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C
with the primary antibodies anti-RSPO1 (1/300) [30];
anti-c-Kit (1/100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FOXL2
(1/500) [50], anti-AMH (1/50) [51], anti-WNT4 (1/500;
M-70, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti β-catenin (1/
1000) [52] diluted in fresh blocking buffer. After 3
washes, sections were incubated for 45 min. at room temperature with the secondary antibody anti-rabbit IgG coupled with FITC (1/200, VECTOR), then washed 3 times
and mounted. For RSPO1/c-Kit double-staining,
immuno-detection were done sequentially with an incubation step of 1 h in blocking buffer added with 10% goat
serum between each staining. The RSPO1 staining was
done first and revealed with anti-rabbit IgG coupled with
FITC (1/200, VECTOR). The c-Kit staining was revealed
with anti-rabbit IgG coupled with TRITC (1/200, Jackson
Immunoresearch lab.). Slides were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (VECTOR) or with
propidium iodide (VECTOR) and observed with a Leica
DMRB epifluorescence microscope coupled to a DP50
CCD camera (Olympus). Confocal microscopy was performed with a LSM510 equiped with a HRm Axiocam
CCD camera (Carl Zeiss, Germany).
In situ hybridization
Two cDNA fragments located in the 3'-untranslated
region of RSPO1 mRNA were obtained by RT-PCR on goat

Riboprobes were generated by transcription in the presence of digoxygenin-labeled deoxy-UTP and the appropriate SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase. Then, in situ hybridization
was performed as previously described [31].

RSPO1 immuno-detection on a male gonad and on mesonephros. The
data show that RSPO1 is not detected on a 50 dpc male gonad, and that
a specific RSPO1 staining is visible on different epithelial cells of a 50 dpc
male mesonephros.
