Abstract
Background: Gibberellins (GA) are plant hormones that can regulate germination, elongation
growth, and sex determination. They ubiquitously occur in seed plants. The discovery of gibberellin
receptors, together with advances in understanding the function of key components of GA
signalling in Arabidopsis and rice, reveal a fairly short GA signal transduction route. The pathway
essentially consists of GID1 gibberellin receptors that interact with F-box proteins, which in turn
regulate degradation of downstream DELLA proteins, suppressors of GA-controlled responses.
Results: Arabidopsis sequences of the gibberellin signalling compounds were used to screen
databases from a variety of plants, including protists, for homologues, providing indications for the
degree of conservation of the pathway. The pathway as such appears completely absent in protists,
the moss Physcomitrella patens shares only a limited homology with the Arabidopsis proteins, thus
lacking essential characteristics of the classical GA signalling pathway, while the lycophyte Selaginella
moellendorffii contains a possible ortholog for each component. The occurrence of classical GA
responses can as yet not be linked with the presence of homologues of the signalling pathway.
Alignments and display in neighbour joining trees of the GA signalling components confirm the
close relationship of gymnosperms, monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants, as suggested
from previous studies.
Conclusion: Homologues of the GA-signalling pathway were mainly found in vascular plants. The
GA signalling system may have its evolutionary molecular onset in Physcomitrella patens, where GAs
at higher concentrations affect gravitropism and elongation growth.

Background
Gibberellins (GAs) are a large family of hormones that are
important for a vast array of responses throughout the life
cycle of plants. They mainly stimulate germination, cause

cell expansion, and regulate flowering time. Due to their
high economical relevance, the effects of GAs on cell elongation are subject to intense scientific studies. The green
revolution was based on selection for dwarfism in rice and

wheat cultivars. Recently it was shown that these dwarfing
genes interfere with either the production or the action of
GAs [1]. Chemical interference with GA biosynthesis is
often used to limit the growth of plants, including trees
[2]. GAs were first isolated from Gibberella (Fusarium)
fujikuroi [3]. This fungus causes extreme extension growth
in rice, named bakanae or "foolish" rice, which hence is
far more susceptible to lodging.
Apart from Gibberella, other fungi (Phaeospheria, Aphaceloma sp.) and various bacteria [4] are able to synthesize
GAs. GAs were consequently found in many plant species
and are widespread over photosynthesizing organisms.
GA-like substances were detected in unicellular and multicellular algae [5-7], in lichens and mosses [8], and in
ferns [4] But most of all, they are widely accepted as general growth controlling hormones in seed plants [4].
Presence of GAs in an organism does not necessarily mean
that it is responsive to these compounds. For instance,
Gibberella itself does not react to exogenous GA [3].
Depending on the species of unicellular algae, GA can
slightly increase the biomass [9]. The effects of GAs on
elongation growth of unicellular algae are either very
small or absent in most species [10]. However, growth
increases were reported for the multicellular alga Porphyra
in the diploid, filamentous sporophyte conchocelis phase
and, in combination with auxin, in stolons of Ulva lactuca
[10,11].
While ABA, auxin, and cytokinin induce specific developmental alterations in mosses like Physcomitrella patens, no
such effects have been reported for GA-application
[12,13]. However, some older reports do exist, that GAapplication on specific moss species may slightly enhance
growth rates [14,15]. In addition GA-application may
interfere with gravitropism in the mosses Ceratodon purpureus [16] and Pottia intermedia [17]. In fact, to date gibberellins have not been identified in mosses, and it was
proposed that the hormonal signalling pathway developed later in land plant evolution [13]. However, as such
pathways do not appear completely de novo, precursors
from which GA may have been evolved should be present
in mosses. Ent-kaurene is the key intermediate in the biosynthesis of gibberellins. Recently, it was shown, that P.
patens produces as a secondary metabolite such a tetracyclic diterpene as a volatile compound in huge amounts
[18], and possesses a bifunctional ent-kaurene synthase
[19].
To our knowledge, no reports are available for GA regulated growth in ferns. In contrast, their stimulatory effect
on elongation and germination has been extensively documented for seed plants, such as conifers [20,21] and
angiosperms, both mono- and dicotyledonous plants.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/65

Sex determination is another known GA effect. In species
as Chara, GA promote antheridia (male sex organ) formation [22]. Likewise, they serve as promoters for antheridia
formation in some ferns [23,24]. Interestingly, in many
eudicotyledonous plants as well, GAs promote male
flower development [25]. By contrast, in the monocot
maize, they promote female flower formation [26].
It is speculated that the GA signalling pathway, which ultimately leads to germination and elongation growth in
seed plants, consists of a limited number of factors (figure
1A). Recently, GA receptors of rice (GID1) and Arabidopsis
have been discovered [27,28]. The receptors are able to
interact, in a GA dependent way, with the DELLA proteins
[27,28]; the interactions solely depends on the presence of
the DELLA-domain in the DELLA protein [29]. DELLA
proteins (such as RGA in Arabidopsis) are inhibitors of
GA responses, which are broken down in the presence of
GAs, hence promoting germination and elongation
growth [30]. This degradation is mediated by an E3 ligase,
that is specified by an F-box protein (such as SLY1 in Arabidopsis or GID2 in rice) [31-33]. Thus the GA signalling
pathway essentially consists of three interacting players.
Over the last few years, three plant genomes have been
entirely sequenced [34-36] and a lot of effort is made to
unravel the gene pool of "genomically more complex"
plants by expressed sequenced tag (EST) sequencing and
assembly. With the variety of open access EST and genome
sequence databases, it becomes possible to perform comparative genomics and molecular phylogenetic analysis
on a large number of species at a time (plantGDB, [37]).
Based on the aforementioned tools, we investigated the
conservation of the GA pathway formed by GID1, SLY1
and DELLA proteins from algae and plants throughout the
plant kingdom, using reference species for different major
plant groups (Figure 1B). Existing orthologues were
retrieved from various higher plants, but are missing from
Physcomitrella patens (Pp). The presence of the GA signalling pathway could thus be linked exclusively with vascular plants.

Results
The gibberellin receptors
The GA receptors (GID1) belong to the large family of
hormone sensitive lipases and have homologues throughout the plant kingdom, since they are related in sequence
to various carboxylesterases [38]. Moreover, the predicted
3D structure of these proteins is similar. However, the GA
receptors contain various regions, which distinguish them
from their carboxylesterase relatives [28,38]. Amino acid
Arg265 is typically present, while the His340 residue from
the catalytic site of the esterases is missing in GID1 proteins.

A) Current model for GA signalling. GA is bound to the GID1 GA receptor and which stimulates the interaction with the
DELLA transcription factor. The F-box protein SLY1/GID2 connects the DELLA transcription factors to an SCF-E3 ubiquitin
ligase. Ubiquitin is transferred from an E2 onto the DELLA target protein. The ensemble of these events causes subsequent
rapid degradation by the 26S proteasome. B) Simplified overview of plant evolution based on the hyperbolic tree presented at

When performing TBLASTN searches, no homologues (E
< e-10) were found in Cyanidioschyzon merolae (belonging
to the phylum Rhodophyta, red algae), nor in
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (belonging to the phylum
Chlorophyta, amongst the green algae). In the moss Physcomitrella patens (Pp), the closest homologue to the Arabidopsis GA receptors misses the Arg265, it has a Leu instead
(Figure 2). This Arg is especially important for gibberellin
binding, as proteins carrying the gid1-2 mutation, where
this residue is changed into a Thr, are unable to bind gibberellins in vitro [27]. Furthermore, the N and C-terminal
end of the Physcomitrella protein diverge from the GID1
proteins. The protein encoded by AT5G23530 also lacks
Arg265, which is unique in the GA receptors, but retains
the His340 from the catalytic site of the esterases, which is
replaced by an Ile or Leu in the GA receptors and a Trp in
the Pp homologue. These data support the idea that the
closest homologue in Pp is part of the large carboxylesterase-like gene family, but lacks features essential for full
gibberellin signalling and features conserved in esterases.
The seedless vascular plant Selaginella moellendorffii
(belonging to the phylum of Lycopodiophyta) has a protein that appears a genuine GA receptor orthologue. It has
an overall good aligment (47% similarity) and in contrast
to the protein from Pp, it contains the Arg265 residue. It
also has a conserved Ile in position 340 instead of a His,
typical for known GA receptors.
From the analysis of a limited EST set (~8000) of the fern
Adianthum capillus veneris (phylum Pteridophyta, order
Polypodiales), we concluded that it has related carboxylesterases, all with the conserved His340 necessary for
esterase activity. Yet the EST collection is too small to
firmly exclude the existence of genuine GA receptor orthologues.
In seed plants, including gymnosperms and angiosperms,
GID1 orthologues are widely present. A clear separation
between monocots and eudicots is visible in a NeighbourJoining (N-J) tree (Figure 3). Interestingly, the pine homologue falls within the various sequences from dicots, suggesting a high conservation for this protein among higher
plants. On the whole, the ClustalW alignment based N-J
tree of the GA receptors shows a relation that is highly
reminiscent of the evolutionary schemes generally
accepted today [39], with the overall most related plants
clustering together.
The SLEEPY homologues
No (E < 1e-4) homologues to the F-box protein SLY1 were
found in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, nor Cyanidioschyzon
merolae using TBlastX.

A reciprocal blast yielding three other Arabidopsis proteins
(At3g44326, At2g27310, At2g36090 with BLASTP scores
of 71, 56, and 55 respectively) closer related to the Pp
homologue of SLY1 (997094760 in Figure 4) than SLY1
itself (BLASTP score 54), indicates that SLY1 orthologues
are not present in Pp. In fact, the highest homology with
SLY1, within the Pp protein, occurs in the F-box region.
This region is necessary for interactions with the Skp1
partner within the SCF-complex, and does not confer substrate specificity. The latter is usually achieved by the Cterminal part [40]. The C-terminal part of the Pp homologue is highly divergent from the rice and Arabidopsis FBox proteins GID2 and SLY1 (Figure 4). The GGF (AA
positions 120â160 in Figure 4) and LSL motives, conserved in the GID2 and SLY1 [31,41], in the Pp homologue, have lower and almost no homology with the GA
related F-box proteins. It is therefore questionable and
rather unlikely that the Pp protein could recognize a
DELLA protein as a substrate.
From Selaginella, a protein could be retrieved with homology to the SLY1 over its whole length, including a leucine rich box at the C-terminal end (Figure 4). A reciprocal
blast indicates that the protein can be considered as an
orthologue of those of higher plants (similarity 51%).
The EST database from the fern Ceratopteris only yielded
an F-box protein with a divergent C-terminal end (data
not shown). F-box proteins are thus present in ferns, but
SLY1 orthologues remain to be discovered.
Similarly to the GA receptors, in gymnosperms and
angiosperms, SLY1 orthologues are widely present. However, F-box proteins are a very divergent family of
polypeptides. The eudicot SLY1 orthologues form a cluster in a N-J tree (Figure 5), while the monocots are
grouped with the gymnosperms. There is a distinct group
containing Sorghum, sugarcane and many conifer
sequences. In this group of sequences, the evolutionary
distance to SLY1 is larger than that to the Pp homologue.
A second monocot-gymnosperm cluster groups with the
closest SLY1 homologue in Arabidopsis, SNEEZY (SNE),
and its homologues (Figure 5; [42]). Overexpression of
SNE in Arabidopsis can take over GA signalling events, but
a clear involvement in GA signalling in natural conditions
has not been found.
DELLA related transcription factors
DELLA proteins belong to the GRAS (GAI, RGA, SCARECROW) protein family, specific to plants [43]. The cDNA
sequence of RGA1 of Arabidopsis was used in a TBLASTX
screen for homologues in other species.

turally important in the Arabidopsis DELLA protein RGL2
and that render RGL2 susceptible to GA mediated degradation (Figure 6; [44]).
In contrast, Selaginella contains a clear RGA1 orthologue.
The protein (Figure 6) was reconstructed from the
genomic sequence, since the matching ESTs do not cover
the N-terminal part, possibly due to absence of that part
in the EST library. Parts of the sequence from the genomic
reconstruction, may represent introns, although the EST
that covers the C-terminal part (from position 340
onward in Figure 6) has the same sequence as the
genomic.
From a limited EST set (~6000) of the fern Ceratopteris
richardii, we only found a scarecrow-like gene
(AY974159) as closest homologue to RGA1. However, as
for SLY1, considering the small size of the EST collection
we cannot exclude the existence of DELLA orthologues in
ferns.
Although no complete DELLA protein sequence could be
retrieved from the available contigs and ESTs of pine,
overlapping homologous fragments from two different
proteins suggest the existence of genuine orthologues (e.g.
similarity of Pt TC59241-59240 with Ath RGA1 is 46%).
In gymnosperms as well as angiosperms, DELLA orthologues are present in various species (Figure 7). Similarly
to the situation of the GA receptors and the F-box proteins, the monocots are more closely related with the gymnosperms and/or Selaginella, than the eudicots.
It is noteworthy that there are more ESTs with homology
to DELLA coding sequences; however, these lack the Nterminal part spanning the DELLA domain (see Additional file 1). This may be either due to a lack of the 5'end
of the coding sequence within the available EST collections or simply because some proteins contain only homology to the C-terminal part [45].
Effect of exogenous GA treatment on Physcomitrella
growth
Since GAs are potent growth stimulating hormones in vascular plants, and Physcomitrella has at least a protein that
is closely related to gibberellin receptors, the question is
prompted whether or not Physcomitrella can respond to
gibberellins. Treatment with 10, 100, 500 and 1000 Î¼M of
GA3 did not influence general growth of protonemata
(comprised of chloronemata and caulonemata; [46])
under normal light conditions. However, when grown in
the dark in upright position, the controls as well as plants
treated with 10 Î¼M GA developed elongated caulonemata
growing positively gravitropic. At relatively high GA3 concentrations of 100 Î¼M and more caulonema formation
was strongly retarded and growth orientation was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/65

changed (Figure 8). While untreated protonemata grow
vertically, GA3 treated ones grew in various direction
showing angles divergent from the vertical, suggesting a
defect in gravitropism (Figure 8K). This response is reminiscent of the effect of high concentrations of gibberellin
(500 Î¼M) that affect gravitropism in protonemata of
another moss, Ceratodon purpureus [16].

Discussion
Where on an evolutionary scale did the GA signalling
pathway arise?
A central node in evolutionary plant research may be the
investigation of mosses for which Pp stands model
[47,48]. GAs are present in various moss species [8]. At
present no data on GA content of Physcomitrella are available, but homologues to key enzymes (genes GA1-GA5 of
Arabidopsis) of the GA biosynthetic pathway were found
(data not shown). Although Physcomitrella has homologues to all three GA signalling components, it is questionable whether they are true orthologues. It is therefore
likely that gibberellin signalling does not function in
mosses as in vascular plants. Divergence from SLY1 of the
F-box protein sequence outside of the F-box, and absence
of homology to the "DELLA" region in the closest relative
of RGA1, may indicate the existence of other recognition
motives between the DELLA-like transcription factor and
the SLY1/GID2-like F-box protein. In addition, the
DELLA-like protein of Physcomitrella may not be functioning as a GA-regulated repressor of GA response as it is stable upon GA treatment when expressed in Arabidopsis
[13]. It could rather play a regulatory role in plant development, being stable upon GA treatment, similarly to the
SLR-like GRAS proteins of rice [45]. Furthermore, since
"genuine" GA responses in Physcomitrella, e.g. stimulation
of growth, are missing, this class of hormones might be
less effective in mosses. However, exogenous gibberellins
are effective in stimulating growth of seta from the liverwort Pellia epiphylla, suggesting the existence of gibberellin
signalling earlier in evolution [49].

In conclusion, mosses may have lost the capacity of effective GA signalling or use an alternative system to that of
vascular plants to pass on the signal. Whether this
involves the homologues to the vascular plant pathway is
not known. In the future, it may be interesting to study
Chara, an even more primitive embryophyte than Physcomitrella, which was reported to be GA-responsive [22].
The lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii has clear orthologues for all components of the GA pathway and is to our
present knowledge the most primitive species to possess a
full-potentially functional â GA signalling pathway; however, phenotypic responses still need to be discovered
[13]. Hence, as suggested in earlier studies by its apical
growth that is restricted to the sporophyte, the presence of

vascular tissue, the formation of roots and leaves, and
even by its genome sequences [50,51], Selaginella is
closely related to seed plants. This is confirmed at the level
of the molecular components of GA signalling.
GA signalling in non vascular plants?
In recent years, no convincing effect of GA on elongation
growth in non vascular plants has been reported. Early
publications on GA effects on plants should be read with
care, as purity of the compounds used in the treatments
was often not that obvious [52], due to lack of modern
analytical techniques. Moreover, some of the analyses
were done in the presence of high concentrations of other
hormones such as auxins or cytokinins [11]. Since in the
last two decades, no true hormonal (at concentrations
lower than 10 Î¼M GA) effect in other organisms than vascular plants has been reported, it is tempting to speculate
that GA signalling has arisen with the occurrence of vascular plants (hypothesis 1 in Figure 9).

If the effects shown in those early studies are indeed true
GA effects, then it may be that mosses and other clades
lost their capacity to respond to GAs (hypothesis 2 in Figure 9). It is however also possible that non-vascular plants
have adopted other mechanisms than those operating in
vascular plants to pass on the GA signal, eventually serving for other, yet to be discovered, responses. Assuming
that GA signalling as we know it is typical for vascular
plants, and that non-vascular species have other compounds and an other mechanism to trigger GA-like
responses, a parallel with the evolution of GA biosynthesis may exist. The fungus Gibberella has a totally different
enzyme set to synthesize GAs than plants [3]. It has therefore been proposed that the synthesis of GAs is a case of
convergent evolution in fungi and plants, involving paralogues rather than orthologues.
In ferns, we found homologues to members of the carboxylesterase and scarecrow-like gene families, to which
respectively the GA receptors and the DELLA transcription
factors belong. Considering the presence of GA responses
in ferns [4] and the limited number of EST sequences
available, it can be reasonably assumed that in the future,
orthologues to GA signalling components will be found.
Gibberellin as sex determinant
Apart from a possible role in elongation, it is interesting
that in non-seed plants as ferns and even Chara, and in
some eudicotyledonous plants, male organs are promoted
by GAs [23,25]. At this moment it is not known whether
the same receptor, F-box, and DELLA components are
involved both in elongation growth and in sex determination. The first function of GAs may have been the stimulation of male gametophyte function. It is therefore possible
that GA signalling arose as a sex determinant in the first

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/65

place. The GA receptors were first implemented as part of
the carboxylesterase family, showing homology to
PrMC3. Intriguingly, PrMC3 was originally isolated from
and shown to be expressed specifically in male cones of
Pinus radiata [53]. Future molecular physiological
research is necessary to unravel the importance of this
family of carboxylesterases in plants and the reason why
some of their members are present especially in (male)
reproductive organs.

Conclusion
The gibberellin signalling pathway as it is known for Arabidopsis and rice is well conserved in lycophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms, which reflects a wide spreading
among land plants known to date. However, except perhaps for the receptor, the pathway components seem to be
missing in the moss Physcomitrella, which indicates that
bryophytes may have the evolutionary onset to respond
efficiently to gibberellins, which yields other responses
(e.g. gravitropism) than in vascular plants. No nuclear EST
or genome sequences are available from other non vascular plants and protists such as Charales, nor from multicellular algae, and only limited in ferns. But, a large amount
of EST collections and BAC clones of a variety of organisms is awaiting sequencing (CUGI, Clemson, SC). As
more genomes will have been sequenced, a more complete picture of the phylogeny of GA signalling will be
drawn.

Methods
Sequence retrieval
Arabidopsis cDNA sequences from the GID1b, SLY1, and
RGA genes were taken from the TAIR website. These
sequences were used to search for homologues by tBlastx
with default parameters against the unigene collection of
Tigr, the citrus HarvEST database (Wanamaker and Close,
University of California), the Cosmoss transcriptome and
genome (with an eight times sequencing coverage) databases (Stefan Rensing, University Freiburg, Germany), the
PHYSCOBASE database [54], the Selaginella databases at
Purdue University [55], the Cyanidioschyzon merolae database of Tokyo University [56], the loblolly pine ESTs from
the CCGB of the University of Minnesota, the Cycas EST
collection from the New York Botanical Garden and the
sequenced EST collection of Adiantum capillis veneris,
Marchantia polymorpha, Welwitschia mirabilis, Ceratopteris
richardii, Mesostigma viridae gathered at plantGDB. Tables
with reference numbers can be found in supplemental
data (see Additional files 1, 2, 3).
Reconstruction of protein sequences
Retrieved ESTs from Selaginella moellendorffii were used to
scan the Sellaginella genome for homologous sequences.
5' and 3' ends were taken to virtually walk over the chromosomes and isolate clones covering about 10 kbp

Occurrence of the GA signalling pathway in the plant kingdom. Hypothesis 1: The GA signalling pathway of vascular plants
arose after the separation of the Bryophytes. Hypothesis 2: The GA signalling pathway originated earlier than the branching of
mosses from the ancestral line, but was lost in unicellular algae and evolved differently in mosses. Dots indicate possible point
of appearance of GA signalling. X-marks indicate points of loss of GA signalling.

around the original EST (which is homologous to the Arabidopsis sequence). For the Physcomitrella patens F-box protein, the same approach was used. For the the DELLA
homologue, the Arabidopsis protein sequences were
directly used to scan the genome traces of the Cosmoss

dbase (Stefan Rensing, University Freiburg). The retrieved
clones (see Additional files 4, 5, 6) were submitted to a
PHRAP process to yield contigs. From these contigs, proteins were derived by doing an in silico translation [57].
The Pp F-box protein homologue and DELLA homologue

translated as a single exon from the Cosmoss database. A
Pp receptor homologue had a predicted intron between
R157 and R158 (Figure 2). The predicted intron was left
out in the reconstructed protein and was 2 bp out of frame
at the 3'end. For the aligment in Figure 2, the sequence of
Physcobase contig 12981 was used. In silico translation
was also applied to the ESTs from pine. Open reading
frames were detected and checked for homology with the
original Arabidopsis proteins in a BlastP.

Authors' contributions
FV and DVDS conceived the study. FV retrieved the
sequences and performed the alignment assays. ACF
helped in the assembly of sequences and reconstruction of
contigs. GW performed the physiological tests on Physcomitrella patens. FV wrote the manuscript together with
RR and DVDS. All authors read and approved the final
manuscript.

Additional material
Alignments
Protein alignments were performed using ClustalW algorithms included in the VectorNTI package (Invitrogen).
Multiple alignments of coding sequences and ESTs were
done on line, using ClustalW at [58] (Kyoto University
Bioinformatics Center) using default parameters and
choosing the PHYLIP output. Neigbour-Joining trees were
generated at [58]. Various control runs were done using
IUB (at [58]), Dialign in the Panta rhei package [59]; University of Bielefeld, Germany) and MAVID [60] alignment
protocols. All controls yielded similar results. Similarity
values were calculated with VectorNTI software (Invitrogen).
Gibberellin treatments of Physcomitrella
Physcomitrella patens (Hedw.) B.S.G. was cultured in liquid
and solid Knop medium as described earlier [61]. GA3 was
purchased by Duchefa (Haarlem, The Netherlands) and a
0.25 M stock solution was prepared in EtOH. For the treatments 5 Î¼l of freshly subcultured moss protonema in liquid culture with a dry weight of 100 mg/l were placed on
Knop plates containing 0, 10, 100, 500 and 1000 Î¼M GA3
or control plates containing the corresponding amount of
EtOH. After one week of growth at normal conditions
(25Â°C, 16 h light with 55 Î¼mol/sm2, 8 h darkness) the
plates were covered with aluminium foil and put upright
for 7 days. For documentation the plants were photographed.
