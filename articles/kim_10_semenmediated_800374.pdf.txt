Abstract
Background: HIV-1 is usually transmitted in the presence of semen. We have shown that semen boosts HIV-1 infection
and contains fragments of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) forming amyloid aggregates termed SEVI (semen-derived
enhancer of viral infection) that promote virion attachment to target cells. Despite its importance for the global spread
of HIV-1, however, the effect of semen on virus infection is controversial.
Results: Here, we established methods allowing the meaningful analysis of semen by minimizing its cytotoxic effects
and partly recapitulating the conditions encountered during sexual HIV-1 transmission. We show that semen rapidly
and effectively enhances the infectivity of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV. This enhancement occurs independently of the viral
genotype and coreceptor tropism as well as the virus producer and target cell type. Semen-mediated enhancement of
HIV-1 infection was also observed under acidic pH conditions and in the presence of vaginal fluid. We further show that
the potency of semen in boosting HIV-1 infection is donor dependent and correlates with the levels of SEVI.
Conclusions: Our results show that semen strongly enhances the infectivity of HIV-1 and other primate lentiviruses
and that SEVI contributes to this effect. Thus, SEVI may play an important role in the sexual transmission of HIV-1 and
addition of SEVI inhibitors to microbicides may improve their efficacy.
Background
Since its introduction into the human population in the
first half of the 20th century by zoonotic transmission of
simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) found in chimpanzees [1], HIV-1 has caused one of the most devastating pandemics of modern times. To date, HIV-1 has
infected more than 60 million people and caused about
25 million deaths [2]. In 2008 alone, there were 2.7 million new HIV-1 infections and 2.0 million AIDS-related
fatalities. The great majority of all HIV-1 transmissions
results from unprotected sexual intercourse. Despite the
rapid spread of HIV-1, the estimated rate of transmission
per sexual intercourse is surprisingly low: male to female
virus transmission occurs about once in every 1,00010,000 unprotected vaginal act [3,4]. Receptive anal inter* Correspondence: frank.kirchhoff@uni-ulm.de, jan.muench@uni-ulm.de

course carries an approximately 10-fold higher risk [5].
Furthermore, the rate of transmission is affected by the
viral load in the donor and thus high during acute HIV-1
infection [6]. Furthermore, inflammation and lesions in
the mucosal barrier resulting from other sexually transmitted diseases increase the risk of transmission [7].
Nonetheless, the dose of HIV-1 transmitted during sexual
intercourse is usually subinfectious and clearly limiting
viral spread [8].
Genital exposure to semen (SE) contaminated with
HIV-1 accounts for most transmissions worldwide [9].
Thus, SE represents the major vector for the dissemination of HIV-1. Several intrinsic properties of SE might
affect the efficiency of HIV-1 transmission, such as neutralization of the acidic pH of the vaginal fluid [10], stimulation of inflammatory cytokines [11], and induction of
leukocyte infiltration of the cervical mucosa and migration of Langerhans cells [12,13]. All these effects may pro-

mote HIV-1 transmission by indirect mechanisms. It is
less clear, however, whether SE directly affects the infectiousness of HIV in male genital fluid. For example, it has
been reported that seminal plasma (SE-P) contains factors preventing the capture and transmission of HIV-1 to
CD4+ T cells by DC-SIGN expressed on dendritic cells
[14]. Another study reported that SE-P contains cationic
polypeptides that inhibit HIV-1 infection [15]. On the
other hand, spermatozoa themselves may capture HIV-1
through heparan sulfate and efficiently transmit the virus
to dendritic cells [16].
We have previously shown that fragments of the abundant semen protein prostatic acidic phosphatase (PAP)
form amyloid structures that capture HIV-1 virions and
promote their attachment to target cells [17]. Strikingly,
these amyloid aggregates, termed Semen-derived
Enhancer of Virus Infection (SEVI), enhance the infectious titer of HIV-1 by several orders of magnitude at a
low multiplicity of infection [17]. The structure of
PAP248-286 (numbers refering to the amino acid position in PAP), the predominant enhancing PAP fragment
detected in semen, has recently been solved and its has
been confirmed that this peptide is highly amyloidogenic
[18,19]. The mechanism underlying SEVI-mediated
enhancement of HIV-1 infection most likely involves
nucleation-dependent formation of amyloid aggregates
and a direct interaction of positively charged surfaces of
SEVI with negatively charged membranes [17,20,21].
SEVI seems to promote virion attachment and subsequent infection by allowing the virus to overcome the
electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged
viral and cellular membranes. Notably, SEVI and SE also
boost the infectiousness of XMRV (xenotropic murine
leukemia virus-related virus), a novel γ-retrovirus that
may be associated with prostate cancer and chronic
fatigue syndrome [22] and SEVI increases the efficiency
of retroviral transductions [23].
The ability of SE and SEVI to promote HIV-1 infection
has been confirmed in several studies [17,20,22,24,25].
Furthermore, the first inhibitors of SE- and SEVI-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection have been reported
[24,25] and may lead to new approaches to prevent HIV-1
transmission. Despite its possible importance in the
transmissions of HIV/AIDS, however, the enhancing
effect of SE on HIV-1 infection remains poorly defined
and controversial. One reason is the lack of standardized
methods addressing the high cytotoxicity of SE in in vitro
culture systems. Here, we thus established methodologies
allowing the meaningful analysis of SE by minimizing its
cytotoxic effects. The results show that SE rapidly and
effectively enhances HIV-1 infection independently of the
viral strain and/or the virus producer or target cell type.
Altogether, our data further support an important role of
SEVI in SE-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection
and thus in the transmission of HIV/AIDS.

Results
Semen boosts HIV-1 infection under non-cytotoxic
conditions

It is long known that the intrinsic cytotoxicity of SE complicates its meaningful analysis in cell culture [17,26].
Thus, we first established experimental conditions circumventing this problem. Specifically, we reduced the
final concentrations of SE in cell culture by pre-incubating SE with the HIV-1 virions (rather than the target cells)
and adding small volumes (usually 20 μl) of these HIV/SE
mixtures and serial dilutions thereof, to comparatively
large (typically 280 μl) TZM-bl cell cultures (Figure 1A).
In some aspects this approach resembles sexual transmission of HIV, where virus-containing SE is diluted by the
female genital fluid present in the vaginal tract, which has
a relatively large surface area of about 100 cm2 [27]. To
further reduce cytotoxicity we removed the SE containing
medium after 2 hours and cultured the cells in fresh
medium containing gentamicin (to prevent bacterial outgrowth) until HIV-1 infection was assessed 2 to 3 days
later. Under these conditions pre-treatment of virions
with 90% (v/v) SE enhanced HIV-1 infection up to 40-fold
compared to the untreated control (Figure 1B). In contrast, PBS-treated HIV-1 was more infectious than SEtreated virus when the inoculum was left on the target
cells (Figure 1B) because final concentrations of SE as low
as 1% were cytotoxic (Figure 1C). Thus, the cytotoxicity
of SE may mask enhancing effects and produce misleading results, but can be overcome by reducing the concentration of SE and exposure time.
Further experiments showed that even SE concentrations as low as 0.4% during virion treatment markedly
enhance HIV-1 infection (Figure 1D). Exposure to relatively high doses of SE-treated HIV-1 caused massive
cytopathic effects (examples shown in Additional file 1
Figure S1). Under these conditions the detectable levels
of LTR-driven reporter gene activity saturated or even
declined due to over-infection and virus-mediated cell
killing. Thus, HIV-1 infection rates and the effects of SE
can only be faithfully determined at a relatively low multiplicity of infection. Notably, SE also enhanced infection
when the HIV/SE inoculum was not removed if the size
of the target cell cultures was increased to further minimize cytotoxic effects (Additional file 1 Figure S2). The
ability of SE to promote HIV-1 infection was not affected
by gentamicin and did not require a serum cofactor
(Additional file 1 Figure S3). Furthermore, treatment with
SE alone did not induce LTR-dependent reporter gene
expression (data not shown).
SE enhances HIV-1 infection rapidly and at different pH
conditions

SE is composed of secretions from different sources,
including the epididymis (~5% v/v of the fluid), seminal
vesicles (60%), prostate (20-30%), and bulbourethral

glands. The origin of seminal HIV-1 particles is still
unclear [28] but they are at least in part produced within
the male genital tract [29-31]. Thus, virions may be
exposed to enhancing factor(s) in SE, such as fragments
of PAP produced by the prostate gland, an organ productively infected by HIV/SIV [30,31], just immediately prior
to their deposition in the genital tract. To assess how rapidly SE enhances the infectiousness of HIV-1, we mixed
virus stocks with various concentrations of SE and used
these cocktails to infect TZM-bl indicator cells after different incubation periods. We found that SE enhances
HIV-1 infection, even when the HIV/SE solution was
added to the cells immediately after mixing (Figure 2A).
The highest levels of HIV-1 infection were usually measured after treatment with 10% SE because 50% SE (corresponding to 3.3% in the cell culture) frequently caused
cytotoxic effects (Figure 2A and data not shown). To
assess whether the effect of SE on HIV-1 infection
depends on the duration of target cell exposure, we
infected TZM-bl cells with untreated or SE-treated HIV1 and removed the inoculum after different incubation
periods. We found that the efficiency of HIV-1 infection
was low during the earliest time points and increased
with longer exposure times (Figure 2B). This was
expected because virus entry may take several hours, and
unbound or loosely attached HIV-1 virions are removed
during the washing step. Importantly, SE promoted HIV1 infection at all time points analyzed. However, the effect
was most pronounced (up to 40-fold) between 1 and 4
hours of virus exposure (Figure 2B). Shorter time periods
resulted in inefficient viral infection and longer incubation increased cytotoxic effects.

Next, we examined the effect of different pH conditions
on SE-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection. This
may be relevant for sexual transmission of HIV-1 because
the pH in the viral environment prior to, during and after
sexual intercourse may change from about 8.0 in SE to
about 4.2 in the female genital fluid [10]. Unexpectedly,
HIV-1 infection was moderately increased at an acidic pH
in target cell cultures (Figure 2C), whereas the pH of the
virus stock had no significant effect on the efficiency of
HIV-1 infection (Figure 2D). Importantly, SE boosted
virus infection under pH conditions ranging from 5.5 to
8.0 and in the presence of pooled cervical lavage fluid
(CLF) (Figure 2E). More extreme pH conditions or
increased CLF concentrations could not be analyzed, as
they were toxic to the cells.
Stability of the enhancing activity in SE

To assess the stability of the enhancing activity in SE, we
incubated aliquots of pooled SE for three days at 37°C and
tested its effect on HIV infection. We found that incubation of SE for 6 hours at 37°C reduced its enhancing activity by about 50% (Additional file 1 Figure S4A). Some
residual activity was even detectable at 3 days of incubation (Additional file 1 Figure S4A). After sexual intercourse, elevated levels of the SE marker PAP, the
precursor of SEVI, can be detected in the vagina for about
24 hours [32]. Thus, amyloidogenic PAP fragments may
be generated over a period of several days. Notably, 10%
SE was most effective in infectivity enhancement for the
first 6 hours, whereas 50% SE showed higher activity at
later time points. This indicates that the enhancing and
cytotoxic factors in SE are slowly degraded. Furthermore,
both activities were eliminated by heating (data not

particles was also enhanced up to 20-fold by treatment
with 90% SE (Additional file 1 Figure S5C and S5D).
Unexpectedly, CEMx-M7 cells infected with SE- or SE-Ftreated virions also displayed about 2- to 3-fold increased
levels of mean GFP expression compared to those
infected with PBS-treated virus (Additional file 1 Figure
S5B and S5D).
Next, we investigated whether the enhancing effect of
SE on HIV-1 infection is also observed in primary human
cells. To address this, we generated virus stocks of wildtype X4 HIV-1 NL4-3 and twenty V3 Envelope recombinants thereof with differential coreceptor tropism [33].
These viruses were exposed to PBS or to 10% (v/v) SE for
5 min prior to infection. A total of 20 μl of these virus
stocks was then used to infect 280 μl PBMC cultures.
After 3 days, the cell-free PBMC culture supernatants
were used to infect TZM-bl cells (experimental outline
shown in Figure 3B). To determine the effect of SE on
PBMC infection and release of HIV-1 we analyzed virus
production at an early time point to avoid a bias due to
multiple rounds of viral replication. Strikingly, treatment
with SE resulted in 5- to 137-fold (average 36.1 ± 32.7fold, n = 21) enhancement of infectious virus in the
supernatant of the PBMC cultures (Figure 3B). Effective
enhancement was observed for the 16 R5 viruses as well
as for the three X4 and two dual tropic HIV-1 recombinants, suggesting that SE-mediated enhancement is inde-

proteins. Most importantly, these data show that SE
maintains some enhancing activity for several days at
body temperature.
SE generally enhances primate lentiviral infection

All of the results described above were obtained using
adherent TZM-bl cells allowing easy removal of the SE
inoculum. To assess the effect of SE on HIV-1 infection in
T cells, we exposed CEMx-M7 cells to SE- and SE-Ftreated CXCR4(X4)- and CCR5(R5)-tropic HIV-1 strains.
Examination by fluorescence microscopy and flow
cytometry confirmed that treatment of HIV-1 virions
with 10% SE and SE-F increased the number of GFP+
infected cells up to 17-fold (Figure 3A and Additional file
1 Figure S5A and S5B). Prior to their deposition in the
genital tract, HIV-1 virions are exposed to undiluted SE.
Thus, it is noteworthy that the infectiousness of HIV-1

cells. Shown are average infection rates of TZM-bl cell ± SD (n = 3) measured 2 days after virus exposure. X4 virus is color-coded red; R5 virus,

pendent of the viral coreceptor tropism. To further
examine whether SE might generally enhance primate
lentiviral infection, we analyzed its effect on a large number of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV strains and found that SE
enhanced their infectiousness by 10- to 25-fold (Additional file 1 Figure S6 and data not shown).
SE-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection is
independent of the virus producer and target cell type

To assess the possible relevance of SE for sexual virus
transmission, we next examined its effect on HIV-1
founder viruses, which are most likely the ones transmitted during sexual intercourse [34]. We found that SEVI
and pooled SE enhance the infectiousness of HIV-1 particles pseudotyped with envelope glycoproteins derived
from 25 different transmitted/founder viruses [34] in single round infection assays by 5- to 48 fold (Figure 4A).
Notably, the magnitudes of infectivity enhancement by
SEVI and SE correlated significantly (p = 0.0006) (Figure
4B). To further examine the effect of SE on viral particles
generated by the relevant producer cells in vivo we harvested HIV-1 from ex vivo infected testis tissue [29,31].
We found that SE clearly increases the infectiousness of
testis-derived R5- and X4-tropic HIV-1 strains (Figure
4C). Further experiments using luciferase reporter
viruses showed that SE also promotes HIV-1 infection of
primary T cells and macrophages, the relevant target cells
of HIV-1 in vivo (Figure 4D and 4E). Finally, we examined
whether SE also affects HIV-1 infection in trans. Our
results showed that SE increases the transmission of R5tropic HIV-1 from non-permissive CaSki human cervical
epithelial carcinoma cells to susceptible T cells about 80fold (Figure 4F). Typically, the strongest enhancing effects
of SE were observed with low doses of freshly produced
highly infectious HIV-1 virions, irrespective of the virus
strain and producer or target cell type.
Exploring controversies on the effect of SE on HIV-1
infection

Our result that SE enhances HIV-1 infection seems to be
contradictory to previous studies reporting that seminal
plasma (SE-P) impairs the capture and transmission of
HIV-1 by DC-SIGN [14] and inhibits virus infection [15].
To determine the effect of SE and SE-P on HIV-1 transmission by DC-SIGN we used B-THP-1-DC-SIGN and
CEM-M7 cells. As expected [14], expression of DC-SIGN
strongly enhanced transmission of HIV-1 to CEM-M7
indicator cells (Figure 5). In agreement with previous
results [14], pre-treatment of cells with SE, SE-F and SE-P
potently inhibited DC-SIGN-mediated transmission of
HIV-1 (Figure 5). In contrast, SEVI amplified infection of
T cells by HIV-1 particles bound to DC-SIGN-expressing
dendritic or B-THP-1 cells even further [[17], data not

Figure 4 SE enhances founder HIV infection and boosts HIV infection independently of the viral producer and target cell type. (A)
Effect of SE on HIV particles carrying gp120/41 from founder viruses.
Pseudotyped HIV-1 particles were generated by transient transfection
of 293T cells with an env-defective HIV-1 NL4-3 backbone and plasmids
expressing the Env proteins previously described (34). Virions were
treated with medium, 10 μg/ml SEVI or 10% SE and used to infect TZMbl cells. The inoculum was removed after 2 hrs and infection rates were
determined 2 dpi. Shown are the average levels of triplicate TZM-bl cell
infections ± SD. (B) Correlation between the magnitudes of SEVI and
SE-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 pseudotype infection shown in
Fig 4A. N-fold enhanced infection rates were calculated by dividing infection rates obtained in the presence of SEVI or SE by those of mocktreated virus infection. (C) SE enhances infection of testis derived HIV1. X4 tropic HIV-1 IIIb and R5 tropic SF162 were harvested from infected
testis tissue, treated with indicated concentrations of SE and used to
infect TZM-bl cells. (D, E) SE enhances the infectiousness of HIV-1 for
PBMCs and macrophages. Stocks of an R5-tropic HIV-1 NL4-3 V3 variant
(92TH04.12) containing the luciferase reporter gene in place of nef
were generated by transient transfection of 293T cells. Virus stocks
were treated with the indicated concentrations of SE and used to infect PBMC (D) and macrophages (E). Similar results were obtained using various primary HIV-1 strains. (F) SE favours in trans-infection of T
cells by viral particles bound to epithelial cells. CaSki cells derived from
an epithelial cervical carcinoma were exposed to HIV-1 treated with SE

bars indicate n-fold enhancement relative to the infectivity measured
using PBS/medium-treated virus stocks.

shown]. Thus, SEVI generally facilitates HIV-1 infection,
whereas SE also contains a specific inhibitor that overcomes the enhancing effect of SEVI in the case of DCSIGN-mediated virus transmission.
Next, we evaluated results of Martellini and coworkers
suggesting that SE-P may inhibit HIV-1 [15]. In this study,
the target cells and not the HIV-1 virions were treated
with SE-P. To assess the effect of SE on the susceptibility
of target cells to HIV-1 infection, we used a flow cytome-

try-based HIV-1 virion-fusion assay [35]. This system
allows to directly measure virion fusion with the target
cells and minimizes cytotoxic effects because the cells are
only exposed to SE for short time periods. Primary endometrial CD4+ T cells were either PBS-treated or treated
with SE, washed, exposed to HIV-1 NL4-3 BlaM-Vpr virions for 4 hours and loaded with CCF2/AM dye. In agreement with published data [20,24], treatment with 10% SE
enhanced the susceptibility of the cells to HIV-1 infection
by 5-fold (Additional file 1 Figure S7). This effect is lower
than that observed in HIV-1 infection assays because the
fusion assay requires higher viral doses. Nonetheless, our
data show that treatment with SE enhances rather than
reduces the susceptibility of cells to HIV-1 infection. To
elucidate why Martellini and coworkers obtained different results, we repeated the experiments following their
protocols (Figure 6A). In agreement with their findings,
treatment of the TZM-bl indicator cells with SE-P and SE
and subsequent infection with HIV-1 resulted in reduced
levels of Tat-driven reporter gene activity suggesting inhibition of virus infection (Figure 6B). At one day postinfection (the time point examined in the previous study)
cytotoxic effects were observed at about 4-fold higher
concentrations of SE-P and SE compared to those
required to inhibit virus infection (Figure 6C, upper). At 3
days post-infection cytotoxic effects become more apparent (Figure 6C, lower) and the metabolic activity of the
cells correlated significantly with the Tat-driven reporter
gene activities (Figure 6D). Thus, a decreased metabolic
activity of the target cells rather than a specific anti-HIV
activity of SE-P or SE may account for the reduced levels
of Tat-driven reporter gene activity in this assay. Efficient
viral gene expression is dependent on the "fitness" of the
cells and is highly sensitive to cytotoxic or cytostatic
effects and experimental conditions just at the threshold
of cytotoxicity may yield misleading results.

SE-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection is donordependent and correlates with the levels of PAP248-286/
SEVI

All experiments described above were performed with
pooled semen obtained from more than 20 individual
donors. To assess whether the enhancing activity may be
donor-dependent, we collected and analyzed SE samples
from 14 different individuals. All SE samples were
allowed to liquefy for 30 min and subsequently kept frozen until further use. Notably, they were processed and
tested together for their ability to promote HIV-1 infection. We found that all SE samples enhanced HIV-1 infection, albeit with strikingly different efficiencies ranging
from 2- to about 50-fold (Figure 7A). Thus, in addition to
the viral load and other factors, the potency of SE in
enhancing the infectiousness of HIV-1 particles may also
affect the rates of virus transmission. Notably, fresh liquefied ejaculates enhanced HIV-1 infection about as effectively as SE samples that had undergone a freeze/thaw
cycle (data not shown). Thus, the presence of living spermatozoa capturing virions by heparan sulfate [16] or
other cells did not interfere with SE-mediated enhancement of HIV infection.
To assess a possible role of SEVI in the differential
capacity of these SE samples to enhance HIV-1 infection,
we generated specific antibodies by immunizing rabbits
and guinea pigs with amyloidogenic PAP248-286. Both
immune sera (but not the pre-immune sera) reacted with
monomeric PAP248-286 and with SEVI amyloid, but not
with shorter PAP fragments (e.g. PAP248-261), a peptide
containing the reverse amino acid sequence of PAP248286 (termed "IVES"), or with full-length PAP (Figure 7B

and 7C, and data not shown). Importantly, the sera also
recognized SEVI spiked into SE (Figure 7D) and allowed
to establish a semi-quantitative indirect "SEVI ELISA".
The potency of the 14 SE samples described above in
enhancing HIV-1 infection correlated significantly with
their reactivity to the anti-SEVI sera (Figure 7E). This
finding was confirmed with a large number of SE samples
from both Germany and the US (data not shown). Notably, centrifugation of SE-F through a 100-kDa-pore-size
filter removed the entire virus enhancing activity and the
reactivity to anti-SEVI antiserum (Additional file 1 Figures S4B and S4C). Thus, the enhancing factor in SE has a
molecular weight of > 100 kDa, which is in agreement
with the large size of amyloid aggregates. Altogether,
these data are further evidence that SEVI contributes to
SE-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, they emphasize the importance of using pooled SE
samples for a valid analysis of SE-mediated enhancement
of HIV-1 infection because the activity of individual samples varies substantially.

Discussion
SE is the main vector for the spread of the AIDS pandemic [9] and contains cell-free HIV-1 virions, even in
individuals receiving HAART [36,37]. It is well estab-

lished that the levels of infectious virus transmitted during sexual intercourse are a major determinant of the rate
of HIV-1 transmission [6,38]. Nonetheless, strikingly little is known about the effect of SE on the infectiousness
of HIV-1. Our results suggest that the ability of SE to
boost HIV-1 infection may have been missed because its
meaningful analysis is not without complications. We
show that the confounding effects of cytotoxic factors in
SE can largely be overcome by (i) pre-treating the virus
rather than the cells; (ii) using a small volume of SEtreated virus stocks to infect a large target cell culture and
(iii) removing the HIV/SE inoculum after a few hours.
While the analysis of SE for enhancement of HIV-1 infection requires some optimization, these conditions actually partly recapitulate those encountered during sexual
transmission of HIV-1. Other treatments commonly used
to examine SE, such as pre-incubation of target cell, heat
treatment and infection with high concentrations of
freeze-thawed viral inoculums, all reduce the ability of SE
to enhance HIV-1 infection, or may even misleadingly
suggest that it is inhibitory.
The newly established experimental conditions allowed
to demonstrate that SE promotes HIV-1 infection independently of the viral geno- and phenotype or the viral
producer and target cell type. Importantly, our analyses
included HIV-1 founder viruses as well as the primary
cell types relevant for virus production and infection in
vivo (Figure 4A). The enhancing effect of SE was relatively
stable (Additional file 1 Figure S4) and observed over a
broad range of pH conditions as well as in the presence of
vaginal fluid (Figure 2C-E). Our finding that SE increases
the infectiousness of HIV-1 almost instantaneously (Figure 2A) suggests that it may also affect the rate of femaleto-male virus transmission, particularly if mixtures of
HIV-1 containing vaginal fluid and semen become stuck
under the foreskin. Notably, the observed effects most
likely underestimate the potency of SE in boosting HIV-1
infection because its cytotoxicity precluded the analysis
of high SE concentrations or long cellular exposure times.
Our previous screening of a highly complex protein/
peptide library from pooled SE identified only enhancing
amyloidogenic peptides, but no inhibitors of HIV [17].
However, we also confirmed findings of Sabatte and
coworkers [14] showing that pretreatment of DC-SIGN
expressing cells with SE inhibits the transmission of HIV1 to CD4+ target cells. This inhibitor could not be
detected in our screening approach because its molecular
mass exceeds the cut-off size used for the generation of
the SE-derived peptide/protein library and because we
examined effects on CD4/coreceptor-mediated HIV-1
infection and not on the interaction of the virus with DCSIGN. The evidence that HIV-1 does not effectively bind
to DC-SIGN in the presence of SE argues against a major
role of this C-type lectin in sexual transmission of HIV-1.

However, it is conceivable that a potent attachment factor
like SEVI may allow HIV-1 to bypass the requirement for
cellular attachment factors. In agreement with this possibility, SEVI and SE drastically enhance HIV-1 infection of
T cells both directly and in trans by epithelial cells (Figure
4) [17]. Thus, amyloid aggregates in SE may help the virus
at the earliest stage of infection, when it is most vulnerable to elimination [8], by promoting both virion binding
to protrusions of DCs extending to the luminal surface
and by enhancing virus infection of CD4+ target cells that
become accessible through physical breaks in the epithelial barrier.
We have previously shown that the small precipitate
obtained after centrifugation of SE-P contains HIV
enhancing activity and a high quantity of amyloidogenic
PAP248-286 [17]. Here, we show that the potency of individual SE samples in enhancing HIV-1 infection correlates with levels of SEVI (Figure 7E). This result further
supports that SEVI contributes to the enhancing effect of
SE on HIV-1 infection. Additional experiments are
required to fully elucidate the underlying mechanism.
However, all data are consistent with the possibility that
amyloid aggregates bind to both the virions and the cells,
thereby allowing them to overcome the repulsion
between their negatively charged membrane surfaces
[20]. Relatively small amyloid aggregates like oligomers or
filaments with sizes in the lower nanometer range may
account for the bulk of the enhancing activity because
large fibrils (> 0.1 micrometer) are not detectable in SE
[17]. Indeed, it has been suggested that small fibrils are
particularly active in enhancing HIV-1 infection [39].
We found that every SE sample that liquefied and thus
could be analyzed enhanced HIV-1 infection. However,
our results also showed that the potency of SE in enhancing the infectiousness of HIV-1 virions varies between
different donors. It has been previously shown that some
HIV-1-infected individuals transmit the virus more efficiently than others [40,41]. Based on the evidence that a
small subset of infected people may be responsible for a
disproportionately high number of HIV-1 transmission, it
has been suggested that "super-spreaders" may play a significant role in the spread of the AIDS pandemic [42].
Our findings suggest that in addition to the viral load
present in the genital fluid, the differential potency of SE
to enhance the infectiousness of HIV-1 virions may play a
relevant role in the rate of virus transmission occurring
after unprotected sexual intercourse.
Although our data are highly suggestive, the importance of SE and SEVI for the spread of HIV-1 in vivo
remains elusive. Previous studies in the SIV/macaque
model yielded somewhat contradictory data. Neildez and
colleagues observed that treating a low dose of
SIVmac251 with SE-P increased vaginal transmission
rates [43], whereas others failed to detect significant

Page 8 of 12

effects of SE or SE-P on SIV transmission [44]. However,
the latter may be due to the fact that the animal numbers
were low and the experimental conditions did not reflect
the in vivo situation, e.g., (i) the virus doses used were
several orders of magnitude higher than those usually
transferred during sexual intercourse; (ii) frozen virus
stocks that may contain a relatively high proportion of
defective particles were used for infection and (iii) frozen
SE-P was administered into the vagina prior to the inoculation with SIV. We found that SE and SEVI efficiently
promote SIV infection in vitro and we are planning to
perform low-dose vaginal challenge studies in the SIV/
macaque model [45] to assess the effect of SE on virus
transmission in vivo.
Although SE may strongly enhance the infectiousness
of HIV, the rate of sexual virus transmission per unprotected vaginal intercourse is low. It is conceivable that
even an effective attachment factor will not allow the
virus to penetrate an intact mucosal surface. Further
experimentation is necessary, but it is tempting to speculate that amyloid aggregates in SE increase the stickiness
of HIV-1 virions, thereby increasing the chances of the
virus attaching to and infecting target cells that may
become accessible through microlesions or local inflammation. SE itself may play a role in the recruitment of target cells to the site of primary virus exposure by
stimulating inflammatory cytokines that may induce
transient infiltration of the cervical mucosa by leucocytes
and the migration of Langerhans cells [2,13,46].
The fact that SE enhances the infectiousness of HIV-1
may have important implications for the development of
preventive vaccines and microbicides. It is still not fully
understood whether HIV-1 transmission by sexual intercourse usually results from cell-free or cell-associated
virus. However, a recent study analyzing the origin of
HIV-1 strains among men who have sex with men provided phylogenetic evidence that seminal plasma virus is
the source [47]. Thus, it is conceivable that blocking SE's
ability to enhance HIV-1 infection may reduce virus
transmission and the first inhibitors of SEVI have already
been identified [24,25,48]. SE-mediated enhancement of
HIV-1 infection may also affect the antiviral potency of
antibodies, microbicides and antiretroviral agents. In
fact, recent studies suggest that seminal plasma reduces
the sensitivity of HIV-1 to inhibition by microbicides
[49,50], which may explain why clinical trials have thus
far generally failed [51].

Conclusions
SE efficiently enhances HIV-1 infection independently of
the virus strain and producer or target cell type. The magnitude of enhancement is donor-dependent and correlates with the levels of SEVI. The enhancing effect of SE
on HIV-1 infection should be considered in the develop-

ment of preventive agents and the inhibition of this host
enhancing activity may help to reduce the rates of sexual
transmission of HIV/AIDS.

Methods
SE and SE-F

Semen samples were collected from healthy individuals
with informed consent. Individual SE samples were
obtained from the "Kinderwunschzentrum" (Goettingen,
Germany) or the UCSF Fertility Clinic (San Francisco,
USA). Pooled SE was generated from SE samples derived
from > 20 individual donors. All ejaculates were allowed
to liquefy for 30 min and SE samples were stored in 1 ml
aliquots at -20°C. SE-F represents the cell free supernatant of SE pelleted for 5 min at 10000 rpm. In all experiments, aliquots were rapidly defrosted, analyzed
immediately and the remainder discarded.
HIV-1 variants and virus stocks

Virus stocks of NL4-3-derived V3 recombinants [29],
HIV-1 NL4-3_R5_G-Luc (encoding the secretable
Gaussia princeps luciferase in place of nef), HIV-1 virions
pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins from different transmitted/founder viruses [34], HIV-2 ROD10
(kindly provided by K. Strebel), HIV-2 7312 (kindly provided by G. Shaw and B.H. Hahn), HIV-1 SG3.1, BRU/
LAI and YU2 (obtained through the NIH AIDS Research
and Reference Reagent Program) and SIVmac239 were
generated by transient transfection of 293T cells as
described [17]. After overnight incubation, the transfection mixture was replaced by 2 ml DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FCS, and the cells were cultured for
36 hours. Subsequently, the culture supernatant was centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000 rpm to remove cell debris. The
resulting virus stock was analyzed by p24 antigen ELISA.
Virus stocks were either used immediately or stored in
aliquots at -80°C. Testis-derived virus was obtained at day
14 post-infection of testis explants infected with HIV-1
SF162 and IIIB as described [29].
Cell culture

TZM-bl cells (obtained through the NIH ARRRP from
Dr. John C. Kappes, Dr. Xiaoyun Wu and Tranzyme, Inc.)
and CEMxM7 cells (kindly provided by N. Landau) were
cultured as previously described [17]. Human PBMC
were obtained by ficoll density centrifugation and CD14CD4+ cells were isolated by magnetic bead separation
(Miltenyi). 5 × 105 cells were seeded in RPMI medium
(10% FCS, Pen/Strep, Glu,) in 96-well round-bottom
plates and pre-treated with SE for one hour.
Effect of SE on HIV-1 infection of TZM-bl cells

Standard testing of the effect of SE on HIV infection was
performed using adherent TZM-bl reporter cells. Typically, 1 × 104 cells were seeded in microtiter plates in a

Page 9 of 12

volume of 280 μl medium (DMEM supplemented with
10% FCS, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin and 50 μg/mL gentamicin). The following day, frozen
SE samples were thawed, briefly vortexed, diluted in Dulbecco's PBS (1×) or medium, and mixed 1/1 (v/v) with
virus stocks. In most experiments, SE was serially diluted
5-fold resulting in 100%, 20%, 4% and 0.8% solutions.
Subsequently, 40 μl of these dilutions were transferred to
U-bottom microtiter plates and mixed with 40 μl of undiluted, 10-fold and 100-fold diluted virus stocks (corresponding to 2.0, 0.2 and 0.02 ng p24 antigen); referred to
as "virion treatment". Dilutions of the virus stock were
used to avoid over-infection of the target cells in the presence of SE. The concentrations of SE during virion treatment were thus 50%, 10%, 2%, 0.4% and 0%. After 1 to 5
min incubation at RT, the HIV/SE mixtures were resuspended twice, and 20 μl thereof were used to infect 280 μl
TZM-bl cells (70% confluent) resulting in a 15-fold dilution of SE and thus final SE concentrations in the cell culture of 3.3%, 0.66%, 0.13%, 0.03% and 0%. Final SE
concentrations > 0.1% were cytotoxic when left on the
cells for longer time periods. To avoid this, the HIV/SE
inoculum was removed after 2 hrs of incubation at 37°C
and the cells were further cultivated in 200 μl fresh
DMEM (supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics).
Even under these conditions, concentrations of ≥3.3% SE
reduced the viability of the cells. Infection was monitored
daily by light microscopy and infection rates were determined upon occurrence of virus induced cytopathic
effects, or after a maximum of 3 days. Infection rates of
TZM-bl were determined using the one-step Tropix GalScreen Kit (Applied Biosystems) as recommended by the
manufacturer. β-galactosidase activities were determined
using the Orion microplate luminometer (Berthold). All
values represent reporter gene activities (relative light
units per second; RLU/s) derived from triplicate infections minus background activities derived from uninfected cells. To analyze the effect of SE on HIV infection
under conditions approximating the in vivo situation, 20
μl of virus stocks were mixed with 180 μl SE (corresponding to 90% SE during virion incubation). Subsequently, 2fold serial dilutions in PBS or medium were generated
and 20 μl aliquots thereof were used to infect 280 μl
TZM-bl cell cultures. The HIV/SE inoculum was
removed 2 hrs later and infection rates were determined
as described above.
Effect of SE on HIV infection of PBMCs, macrophages and
CEMx-M7 cells

PBMC were isolated and cultivated as described [17].
Virus stocks were treated with 10% SE or PBS, and 20 μl
of the HIV/SE mixtures were added to 280 μl PBMCs
(total of 2 × 105 cells), resulting in a final SE concentration
of 0.66%. After 3 hrs, the cells were transferred to V-

shaped microtiter plates and pelleted at 1,000 rpm for 5
min. Supernatants were removed and cells resuspended
in 200 μl fresh medium. At 3 days post-infection, 100 μl of
the PBMC supernatants were used to infect 100 μl TZMbl cell cultures (1 × 104 cells). Two days later, infection
rates were determined as described above. To monitor
the effect of SE on HIV infection by fluorescence microscopy, a total of 2 × 105 CEMx174 M7 cells containing the
GFP reporter gene under the control of the HIV-1 promoter were seeded in 280 μl medium and infected with
20 μl of 10% SE-treated HIV-1. After 2 hrs cells were pelleted and resuspended in fresh medium. Aliquots of the
cultures were analyzed by UV microscopy 3 days later.
Macrophages were generated by treating buffy coatderived monocytes for 3 days with GMCSF (10 ng/ml)
followed by MCSF (2 ng/ml) for another 3 days. Cells
were then seeded at a density of 20,000 cells/well in 280 μl
RPMI containing MCSF and infected with SE-treated or
mock-treated HIV-1 NL4-3_R5_G-Luc. Two hrs later, the
cells were washed to remove Gaussia luciferase introduced by the virus stock and 250 μl fresh medium was
added. At 3 days post-infection, 40 μl of the culture
supernatant and 40 μl of the washing control were analyzed for Gaussia luciferase activity using the GaussiaJuice Kit (P.J.K) as recommended by the manufacturer.
Luciferase activities were determined using the Orion
microplate luminometer (Berthold). Reporter activities in
all controls were <1,000 RLU/s.
Effect of SE on HIV transmission from CaSki cells to T cells

10,000 CaSki cells (ATCC #CRL-1550), an epithelial cervical carcinoma cell line, were seeded in 280 μl medium
and infected the next day with 20 μl of SE- or mocktreated HIV. After 3 hrs, the inoculum was removed and
CaSki cells were co-cultivated with 5 × 104 CEMx-M7
cells in 200 μl medium. Three days later, luciferase activities in cellular lysates were determined using the
luciferase assay system (Promega).
Cell Viability

The effect of SE on metabolic activity of cells was analyzed using the MTT assay under experimental conditions corresponding to those used in the respective
infection assays. After 3 days of incubation, 20 μl of a 5
mg/ml MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide, Sigma #M2003) solution was added
to cells. After 3 hrs, the cell-free supernatant was discarded, formazan crystals were dissolved in 100 μl
DMSO-ethanol (1:1) and OD was detected at 490/650
nM. In some experiments cytotoxic effects of SE were
further analyzed using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent
Cell Viability Assay (Promega, #G7571) as recommended
by the manufacturer.

Effect of SE on DC-SIGN-mediated trans-HIV infection

Seminal plasma (SE-P) was prepared by centrifugation of
pooled SE for 30 min at 1,000 g. The supernatant was
passed through 0.22-μm-pore-size filters. 20 μl SE or SEP and 5-fold dilutions thereof were added to 160 μl THP1 or THP-DC-SIGN cells (2 × 105) or medium only. After
30 min incubation at 37°C, 20 μl R5 HIV-1 (undiluted, 10, 100- and 1,000-fold diluted) was added and incubated
for another 30 min. Thereafter, cells were transferred into
96-well V-shape plates, pelleted by centrifugation,
washed two times in PBS to remove unbound virus and
resuspended in 100 μl medium. Subsequently, 100 μl
CEMx-M7 cells (1 × 105) were added. After 3 days of cocultivation, 150 μl of the cultures were pelleted, and
luciferase activities in the cell lysates were detected using
Promega's luciferase assay kit as recommended by the
manufacturer.
HIV-1 infection of cells pretreated with SE or SE-P

The experiment was performed essentially as described
[15] except that virus stocks containing normalized quantities (0.5 ng of p24 antigen) of an R5 tropic HIV-1 NL4-3
variant were used and that infection rates and metabolic
activities were measured not only after 1 but also after 3
days post-infection. SE-P was generated by pelleting SE
for 30 min at 1,500 g [15]. TZM-bl cells (6 × 104) were
seeded the day before infection. The next day 50 μl of
serial dilutions of SE and SE-P were added and cells were
infected with 50 μl virus stocks containing 0.5 ng p24.
One and three days later, infection rates and cellular ATP
levels as indicator of metabolic activity were determined
using the Promega luciferase assay kit or CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay. We also examined the
ATP levels of SE and SE-P themselves in the absence of
cells under the same experimental conditions.
SEVI ELISA

96 well EIA/RIA plates (Corning Incorporated) were
coated with 100 μl dilutions of antigen or 100-fold dilutions of cell free SE-F in PBS over night at 4°C. The next
day, plates were rinsed twice in wash buffer (imidazolebuffered Saline with Tween 20; KPL), blocked for 2 hrs
with 100 μl 1 × Roti®-Block solution (Roth) and rinsed
again 5 times. Thereafter, 100 μl of 50-fold dilutions of
pre-immune sera or antisera derived from SEVI amyloid
immunized New Zealand White female rabbits (d28;
Pocono Rabbit Farms) or guinea pigs (S3; IPF-Pharmaceuticals) were added, and then plates were incubated for
1 hr and rinsed 5 times. Finally, 100 μl of 10,000 fold dilutions of HRP-coupled anti-rabbit (PerkinElmer) or antiguinea-pig antibodies (Abcam) were added, samples were
incubated for 30 min, washed 5 times, and incubated with
100 μl HRP substrate (SureBlue™, KPL). Reactions were

500 μl SE-F was filtered through a Microcon YM-100
Centrifugal Filter Unit (Millipore, #42424). The retentate
and filtrate were used immediately in the standard TZMbl infection assay.
Effect of different pH conditions

To assess whether the pH of the target cell culture affects
SE-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection, we
replaced the TZM-bl culture medium by 280 μl DMEM
adjusted to various pH values with acetic acid, HCl or
NaOH, just prior to infection. At 2 hrs after infection, this
medium was replaced by standard DMEM. To examine
whether the pH value of the virus stock impacts the
enhancing effect of SE, virus stocks were diluted 10-fold
in DMEM adjusted to different pH values and subsequently treated with SE and analyzed in infection assays
as described above.
Effect of SEVI on HIV pseudotype infection

PAP248-286 obtained from VIRO Pharmaceuticals
GmbH & Co KG (Hannover, Germany) was dissolved in
PBS (10 mg/ml), and 200 μl aliquots were agitated at
1,300 rpm overnight at 37°C in 1.5 ml microtubes using a
thermomixer. SEVI amyloid formation was verified by
staining with CongoRed and Thioflavin T as described
[17]. 40 μl of virus stocks were treated with 40 μl of a 20
μg/ml SEVI dilution or 20% SE or medium for 5 min, and
20 μl of mixtures were used to infect TZM-bl cells. Infection rates were determined 3 days post-infection as
described above.
HIV-1 Virion-Fusion

This flow cytometry-based HIV-1 virion-fusion assay was
conducted as previously described [17,20]. This assay is
based on the incorporation of beta-lactamase-Vpr (BlaMVpr) chimeric proteins into HIV-1 virions and their subsequent delivery into target cells loaded with the CCF2
fluorescent dye by virion fusion. In infected cells, BlaM
cleaves CCF2 and changes the fluorescence from green to
blue, thereby allowing detection of fusion by flow cytometric analysis.
