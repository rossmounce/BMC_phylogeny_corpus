During the last decades, whole chains of dengue epidemics emerged in the South Pacific region. In contrast
with the situation in hyper endemic continental countries and in the Caribbean, the epidemiology of dengue
in the South Pacific islands Countries (SPICs) is characterized by the non-persistent co-circulation of multiple
serotypes and the long-term predominance, with local
re-emergences, of a single genotype. Local specificities
in the epidemiological profile of dengue can also been
observed between the SPICs, probably related to differences in the geographical situation, the eco-biological
context (climate, endemic mosquito species), the demography and the population flew. In the present study, by
focusing on the past DEN3 1989-96 and the recent
DEN1 2001-10 and DEN4 2007-10 circulation periods, we
addressed the question of the circulation of dengue
viruses between the French Pacific Territories and
the impact of the “local context” on viral genetic evolution. Hundreds of viral strains collected during both
epidemic and endemic periods in French Polynesia (FP),
New Caledonia (NC) and Wallis & Futuna (WF) were
sequenced on the complete E gene. The phylogenetic analysis corroborates the previous observations on the predominant circulation of a single genotype. Within each
serotype/genotype, the viral strains collected in the SPICs
formed a “Pacific clade”. Within this clade, the strains
from the French Pacific Territories formed a unique lineage during the early epidemic/endemic circulation periods
but diverged in distinct lineages when the virus reemerged. By analyzing the in time/in space fixations of
genetic mutations on the E gene, we observed that some
mutations are shared by the French Pacific Territories but
differ from the other SPICs. Moreover, although the

majority of the mutations acquired in FP are also found
on NC and WF strains, some seem to be specific to the
Territory. Our results support the hypothesis of an impact
of both the regional and local contexts on the genetic evolution of dengue viruses.
