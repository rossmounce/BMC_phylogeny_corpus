Abstract
Background: Alignments of homologous DNA sequences are crucial for comparative genomics
and phylogenetic analysis. However, multiple alignment represents a computationally difficult
problem. For protein-coding DNA sequences, it is more advantageous in terms of both speed and
accuracy to align the amino-acid sequences specified by the DNA sequences rather than the DNA
sequences themselves. Many implementations making use of this concept of "translated alignments"
are incomplete in the sense that they require the user to manually translate the DNA sequences
and to perform the amino-acid alignment. As such, they are not well suited to large-scale
automated alignments of large and/or numerous DNA data sets.
Results: transAlign is an open-source Perl script that aligns protein-coding DNA sequences via
their amino-acid translations to take advantage of the superior multiple-alignment capabilities and
speed of an amino-acid alignment. It operates by translating each DNA sequence into its
corresponding amino-acid sequence, passing the entire matrix to ClustalW for alignment, and then
back-translating the resulting amino-acid alignment to derive the aligned DNA sequences. In the
translation step, transAlign determines the optimal orientation and reading frame for each DNA
sequence according to the desired genetic code. It also checks for apparent frame shifts in the DNA
sequences and can handle frame-shifted sequences in one of three ways (delete, align as amino acids
regardless, or profile align as DNA). As a set of comparative benchmarks derived from six proteincoding genes for mammals shows, the strategy implemented in transAlign always improves the
speed and usually the apparent accuracy of the alignment of protein-coding DNA sequences.
Conclusion: transAlign represents one of few full and cross-platform implementations of the
concept of translated alignments. Both the advantages accruing from performing a translated
alignment and the suite of user-definable options available in the program mean that transAlign is
ideally suited for large-scale automated alignments of very large and/or very numerous proteincoding DNA data sets. However, the good performance offered by the program also translates to
the alignment of any set of protein-coding sequences. transAlign, including the source code, is freely
available at http://www.tierzucht.tum.de/Bininda-Emonds/ (under "Programs").

Background
Alignments of homologous DNA sequences are crucial for

comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis [1]. The
most accurate multiple alignment tool arguably remains

the human eye. However, the increasing amount of
sequence data and the increasing scope of projects using
these data mean that an automated alignment procedure
is often necessary at some point to achieve the final
alignment.
For protein-coding DNA sequences, alignments obtained
from the amino-acid residues specified by the DNA
sequences will often be superior to those obtained directly
from the DNA for several reasons (see also [2]). First and
foremost, aligning the amino-acid residues preserves the
codon structure of the coding sequence, thereby avoiding
the introduction of any frame shifts through the alignment process. Second, because amino acids are more conserved evolutionarily than DNA, and possibly because the
amino-acid alphabet is larger than the DNA one and
therefore less likely to become saturated with convergent
substitutions over longer timeframes, it is often easier to
align amino-acid sequences between more distantly
related organisms. Third, unlike for nucleotide data, the
transition matrices that exist for amino-acid data (e.g.,
BLOSUM [3], GONNET [4], or PAM [5]) are empirically
derived and thus perhaps more "biologically realistic".
The many different possible models of nucleotide evolution (see [6]) and the fact that different genes evolve
according to different models makes the likelihood of
obtaining an equivalent, global nucleotide transition
matrix small. Finally, because the translated amino-acid
sequence is one-third as long as the original DNA
sequence, the alignment procedure will be faster. Based
purely on the differences in sequence length, the speedup
would be on the order of a factor of nine, given that the
Smith-Waterman [7] algorithm for the pairwise alignment
of sequences that underlies many multiple-alignment
programs runs in O(n2), where n = length of the sequence
(i.e., is proportional to the product of the lengths of the
sequences). However, other considerations, including the
speed of the different scoring routines that could be
implemented for DNA versus amino-acid data or the
memory usage and general implementation of the system,
will also be important determinants of the final relative
speed increase.
One limitation to aligning amino-acid residues is that the
redundancy of the genetic code, whereby up to six sets of
nucleotide triplets can specify the same amino acid,
means that it is not possible to back-translate an aminoacid sequence without recourse to the corresponding
DNA sequence. Numerous programs exist to back-translate aligned amino-acid sequences – for example, the standalone version of RevTrans [2] and mrtrans [8] – but most
require both the aligned sequences and the corresponding, unaligned DNA sequences as input. As such, the
investigator must determine the proper translation frame
for each sequence and perform the amino-acid alignment

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/156

beforehand, which does not lend itself to the automated
alignment of large numbers of DNA sequences.
The server version of RevTrans [9] goes a step further by
optionally taking DNA sequences as input, virtually translating them into their respective amino-acid sequences,
aligning the latter using DIALIGN2 [10], and then backtranslating to achieve the DNA alignment. Altogether, this
strategy makes use of the superior and faster alignments
produced by amino-acid data, while retaining the greater
information content of the DNA sequences for future
analyses. Similar functionality is also built directly into
DIALIGN2. However, the RevTrans server is limited to
only 75 DNA sequences and does not perform any preprocessing of them. As such, is not well-suited to the automated alignment of large numbers of sequences. Both
RevTrans and DIALIGN2 also make use of only the BLOSUM transition matrix. LAGAN and Multi-LAGAN [11]
also offer the possibility of "translated alignments" (via
the translated anchoring option), but both programs are
geared more toward the alignment of long, genomic
sequences.
Building on these solutions, transAlign (for translated
alignments) provides the same basic functionality as the
RevTrans server, but with no constraints on the number of
input sequences (beyond the memory of the user's computer) and a wider selection of amino-acid transition
matrices. More importantly, transAlign also offers a suite
of user-defined options (described below) for manipulating either the raw sequence data or the aligned sequences.
The most of important of these options relate to DNA
sequences that do not translate into "clean" amino-acid
sequences and thus could impact negatively on the
amino-acid alignment. Together with it being a standalone program, these features make transAlign suitable
for both individual data sets and as part of a pipeline for
the automated alignment of large numbers of sequences
downloaded directly from any of the sequence databases.

Implementation
transAlign can automatically read DNA sequences in any
of four formats: fasta, nexus [12], classic [13] or
"extended" [14] PHYLIP, and Se-Al [15]. It can also write
the final alignment in any of these same formats. (Conversion to or from additional formats can be accomplished
through other programs such as readSeq [16] or sreformat, part of the HMMER package [17].) Some basic filtering of the DNA sequences is also implemented, including
the stripping of gaps (either all gaps or only those flanking
a sequence) and deleting sequences with more than a
user-defined percentage of ambiguous nucleotides (i.e.,
Ns).

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:156

After initial processing of the DNA sequences, transAlign
will determine the optimal translation for each sequence
according to any of the genetic codes listed by the NCBI
[18]. It is also possible for Se-Al formatted data to have
different genetic codes specified for each sequence. As far
as possible, transAlign translates codons containing
ambiguous nucleotides (but not explicit gaps). The optimal translation is held to be that yielding the fewest stop
codons excluding the terminal codon. By default, only the
three reading frames for the input orientation are examined; however, it is possible to examine the complemented,
reversed,
and
reverse-complemented
orientations as well. For equally optimal orientations,
transAlign favours the one perturbing the original DNA
sequence the least: in order, 1) the orientation as input,
followed by the second and third reading frames in that
orientation, and then the respective reading frames in
each of the 2) complementary, 3) reverse, and 4) reversecomplementary orientations.
transAlign then passes the translated sequences to ClustalW [19,20] for alignment (according to any of the BLOSUM, GONNET or PAM protein weighting matrices) and
back-translates the resulting aligned residue sequences
into aligned DNA sequences. ClustalW was chosen
because it is perhaps the best known and most widely
used multiple-alignment program. It also offers the largest
choice of amino-acid transition matrices (BLOSUM,
GONNET, and PAM) and the ability to do profile alignments (see below). However, slight modifications to the
transAlign code would allow the use any suitable multiple-alignment program that accepts protein sequence data
as input (e.g., DIALIGN2 with its Clustal-like output in
particular). Regardless of the alignment program used, it
is expected that increases in both speed and accuracy compared to aligning the sequences as DNA would still occur
given the many advantages for aligning protein-coding
DNA sequences as amino acids (see above).
An option is also provided to automatically delete any
poorly aligning sequences as determined by the initial
pairwise alignments performed by ClustalW. This feature
is intended largely to remove problematic sequences from
alignment pipelines, where it is difficult to (manually)
improve the global alignment afterwards. For each
sequence, the mean of its pairwise alignment scores is
compared to that between all the remaining sequences
according to a one-tailed two-sample t-test corrected for
multiple comparisons. As such, the procedure is most
effective at identifying isolated problematic sequences,
which might derive from the inclusion of a potential paralog or simply a misidentified sequence. Families of such
sequences (e.g., if the data set contains numerous copies
of each of the paralogs from a gene family) are less likely
to be detected.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/156

Because ClustalW ignores ambiguous amino acids and
stop codons (neither being present in the amino-acid
transition matrices), transAlign translates them initially as
gaps to permit back-translation. This procedure is unproblematic unless the ambiguous residue or stop codon is
adjacent to a gap inferred by the alignment procedure,
where it could be placed at either the start or end of the
gap. For ambiguous residues arising from incomplete
codons, transAlign determines the more optimal of the
two placements based on the concordance of the missing
nucleotide(s) with the gap. However, all such instances
should still be examined and, if necessary, corrected for
on an individual basis during the manual inspection that
follows any automated alignment procedure.
Obviously, the use of transAlign is restricted to coding
DNA sequences only and should not be used for non-coding DNA, whether for genes such as 18S rDNA (=
MTRNR2; [21]); flanking UTR, regulatory, or intronic
regions of genes; or microsatellite sequences. The procedure is also adversely affected by frame shifts (e.g., from
sequencing errors). Therefore, transAlign will minimally
issue a warning for each sequence that contains more than
a user-specified threshold of stop codons (excluding the
terminal codon) in the optimal orientation. This threshold can either be an absolute number of stop codons
(default) or a percentage of stop codons in the remaining
sequence after the first stop codon is encountered.
Although this procedure is generally robust, it is less likely
to detect frame shifts that occur near either end of a given
sequence because of the reduced probability of an erroneous stop codon arising in the few remaining resides.
Three global solutions for any frame-shifted sequences are
implemented in transAlign: 1) deletion, 2) alignment
using the translated sequences regardless (with the associated errors), or 3) subsequent profile alignment as DNA to
the aligned set of non-frame-shifted sequences (default).
The latter option is the slowest of the three, but allows all
sequences to be aligned as robustly as possible. Moreover,
even a partial profile alignment will always be faster than
aligning all sequences as DNA (Figure 1), regardless of the
actual speedup inherent to aligning the shorter aminoacid sequences. However, performance will drop off
quickly as the proportion of frame-shifted sequences in
the data set increases. For instance, assuming a speedup of
9x for aligning amino acids compared to DNA (which, as
mentioned, is the value expected based only on length
considerations), the overall time saving will only be about
2x if frame-shifted sequences comprise 25% of all
sequences (see Figure 1). Finally, to facilitate the manual
inspection of the dataset, transAlign will also attempt to
infer putative locations for frame-shifting indels based on
a comparison of gaps between the amino-acid aligned and
DNA profile-aligned sequences.

Theoretical gain in speed from performing a translated alignment. The figure reveals there is always a performance advantage in
aligning any given proportion of the protein-coding DNA sequences in a data set via their amino-acid translations with the
remaining DNA sequences subsequently profile-aligned to them. The curve as shown is based on the assumption that the
translated alignment is 9x faster, on average, than the respective DNA alignment; other values produce nearly identical curves
of different scales.

As mentioned above, transAlign will output the aligned
DNA sequences in any or all of fasta, nexus, (classic or
extended) PHYLIP, or Se-Al formats. By default, the
sequences are output in alphabetical order according to
their name. However, it is also possible to output them to
match their order in the original input file or as they were
output from the ClustalW alignment. The latter option is
particularly useful at identifying "families" of similar
sequences or those sequences that were profile-aligned to
facilitate any manual correction of the global alignment.
transAlign is written in Perl and is open source. It will run
on any operating system with a Perl interpreter and is
command-line driven. However, it also features a userinteractive mode where the user is prompted to set all the
relevant variables. It requires that a remotely-callable version of ClustalW is present either in the global path or in
a user-specified one. Again, however, slight modifications

to the code would allow the use any suitable multiplealignment program.

Results and discussion
To test the potential performance advantages offered by a
translated alignment of protein-coding DNA sequences,
six mammalian coding genes were each aligned either
directly using ClustalW (default parameters) or via their
amino-acid translations using transAlign (genetic code
specified, otherwise default parameters). All alignments
used ClustalW v1.83 on an 800-MHz dual-processor Macintosh G4 running OS 10.3.5. The qualities of the respective alignments were judged relative to a manual
alignment of the same data set, each of which was completed for other purposes prior to transAlign being written. As such, the manual alignments represent reasonable,
independent reference points. Quality was quantified by
calculating the opposite of the Hamming distance (i.e.,

Table 1: Benchmark data for the comparative performance of a translated alignment. Six mammalian protein-coding genes were
aligned either as DNA (using ClustalW; default parameters) or via their translations as amino acids (using transAlign; genetic code
specified, otherwise default parameters). All analyses used ClustalW v1.83 on an 800-MHz dual-processor Macintosh G4 running OS
10.3.5. The alignment score is taken relative to the corresponding sequence from a manually aligned data set and is the opposite of the
Hamming distance (i.e., matching bases score +1, mismatches score +0). The alignment score was calculated for each individual
sequence and then averaged over all sequences in each data set. Gene symbols follow the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee
(HGNC; [21]).

between the same sequence in the test alignment and the
manually produced one. These values were then averaged
for each data set to essentially reveal how many nucleotides, on average, were correctly aligned.
The benchmark data (Table 1) show that transAlign
indeed delivers alignments of often superior quality compared to a DNA alignment of the same data set, but always
with a significant savings in time. In particular, the speedup was usually 7x or greater, and approximately the theoretical 9x for the three cases where a profile alignment
was not performed. The only exception was for RBP3,
where the many sequences that were identified as having
possible frame shifts (61 of the 484 in the data set) necessitated an extensive DNA profile alignment. Even so, the
overall speedup for this data set remained greater than 3x,
in line with theoretical expectations based on the proportion of frame-shifted sequences (see Figure 1). In all cases,
accuracy was either comparable to or significantly
exceeded that of a DNA alignment. For MTCYB, the largest
data set examined, the improvement in the alignment
score was substantial (~2x), with the translated alignment
requiring only 1.6 days as compared to over two weeks for
the DNA sequence data.
It should be kept in mind that these benchmarks serve
largely to point out the performance advantages inherent
to performing a translated alignment. Other multiplealignment programs that are faster than ClustalW do exist.
But, the same advantages would also apply to these pro-

Conclusion
The principle underlying transAlign – that of aligning protein-coding DNA via its amino-acid translation – is not
novel, having been suggested at least since the initial
release of mrtrans (circa 1993). However, together with
LAGAN, Multi-LAGAN, DIALIGN2, and the RevTrans
server, transAlign represents one of the few complete
implementations of the principle, with most of the
remaining methods requiring the user to manually translate the DNA sequences and perform the amino-acid
alignment. However, transAlign, in addition to being
cross-platform, also includes a diverse suite of user-definable options relating to the processing of the DNA
sequence data, its alignment as amino-acid data, and subsequent back-translation into aligned DNA data. In particular, transAlign uniquely offers different options to
process sequences that do not translate into clean aminoacid sequences and, as such, may disrupt the alignment
procedure. All these options mean that transAlign is well
suited for the large-scale automated alignment of very
large and/or very numerous data sets. As the benchmark
studies show, the use of translated alignments provides
alignments of at least comparable and often improved
quality compared to a DNA alignment and always with a
significant savings in time.
