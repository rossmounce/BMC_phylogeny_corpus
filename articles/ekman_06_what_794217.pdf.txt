Abstract
Background: Most proteins interact with only a few other proteins while a small number of
proteins (hubs) have many interaction partners. Hub proteins and non-hub proteins differ in several
respects; however, understanding is not complete about what properties characterize the hubs and
set them apart from proteins of low connectivity. Therefore, we have investigated what
differentiates hubs from non-hubs and static hubs (party hubs) from dynamic hubs (date hubs) in
the protein-protein interaction network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

deposited research

Results: The many interactions of hub proteins can only partly be explained by bindings to similar
proteins or domains. It is evident that domain repeats, which are associated with binding, are
enriched in hubs. Moreover, there is an over representation of multi-domain proteins and long
proteins among the hubs. In addition, there are clear differences between party hubs and date hubs.
Fewer of the party hubs contain long disordered regions compared to date hubs, indicating that
these regions are important for flexible binding but less so for static interactions. Furthermore,
party hubs interact to a large extent with each other, supporting the idea of party hubs as the cores
of highly clustered functional modules. In addition, hub proteins, and in particular party hubs, are
more often ancient. Finally, the more recent paralogs of party hubs are underrepresented.

proteins has been characterized, the topology of the network
and its evolution can be investigated. There are approximately 16,000 to 40,000 interactions between the approximately 6,000 proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [5,6].
The identified protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) of
S. cerevisiae shows a power-law connectivity distribution [7].
A distribution with these characteristics indicates that a few
proteins are highly connected (hubs) while most proteins in
the network interact with only a few proteins. However, since
the coverage of the real PPIN is low, it has been questioned
whether the topology of the PPIN can currently be correctly
identified [8]. Even if the exact nature of the degree-distribution of the PPIN has not been correctly determined, it is clear
that some highly connected proteins are characterized by certain properties. For instance, the hubs are about three times
more likely to be essential to S. cerevisiae compared to their
non-hub counterparts [7]. It is conceivable that hub proteins
could be particularly interesting drug targets, for instance in
cancer research [9], where hub proteins that are highly
expressed in diseased tissues may be targeted.
The hubs of the PPIN of S. cerevisiae have been shown to
evolve slowly, which may be because larger portions of the
lengths of these proteins are directly involved in their interactions [10,11]. In contrast, other studies indicate that the proposed negative correlation between evolutionary rate and
connectivity is only due to a small fraction of proteins with
high numbers of interactions that evolve slower than most
proteins in the yeast network [12]. The difference between
some of these studies seems to be due to the nature of the data
sets. When complexes identified with mass spectrometry
based methods are included in the analysis, the relationship
between connectivity and evolutionary rate is clear [13].
Based on expression profiles it is possible to distinguish two
different hub types in the PPIN of S. cerevisiae; static hubs
(party hubs) and dynamic hubs (date hubs) [14]. The party
hubs are found in static complexes where they interact with
most of their partners at the same time, while the date hubs
bind their interaction partners at different times and/or locations. Party hubs are thought to be the central parts of functional complexes while date hubs act as the organizing
connectors between these semi-autonomous modules. Thus,
date hubs appear to be more important than party hubs for
the topology of the network [14]. Further, while there is no
substantial difference between the proportion of essential
proteins among the party and date hubs, perturbation of the
latter leads to sensitization of the genome to further perturbations [14]. In addition, the phylogenetic distribution is
broader for party hubs compared to date hubs [15].
Here, we seek to identify whether additional functional, evolutionary or structural properties distinguish hubs from nonhubs and date hubs from party hubs.

Results and discussion

We used the computationally verified core data set [16] from
the database of interacting proteins (DIP) [17] to build a representation of the PPIN of S. cerevisiae. The data set consists
of 2,640 protein nodes and 6,600 interaction edges. In addition to DIP, we performed all the studies described herein on
the filtered yeast interactome (FYI) data set used by Han et al.
[14].
The connectivity (k) of a protein is defined as the number of
proteins with which it interacts. To study the characteristics
of the hubs in the yeast interaction network, we have divided
the proteins into three groups based on their connectivities.
This yields 519 highly connected proteins (hubs; k ≥ 8), 577
intermediately connected proteins (4 ≤ k ≤ 7) and 4,792 nonhubs (NH; k ≤ 3). The hubs were further classified as static
party hubs (PHs) or dynamic date hubs (DHs), where party
hubs are believed to interact with most of their partners at the
same time while date hubs interact with their partners at different times and/or locations. The classification was based on
the expression profiles of the hubs, as described by Han et al.
[14].
Naturally, the hub sets in DIP and FYI do not overlap perfectly. There are hubs in DIP that cannot be classified as hubs
in FYI due to low connectivities in that data set, and conversely, FYI hubs whose connectivities fall under the hub
threshold in DIP. Furthermore, the coexpression analysis
gives slightly different party hub and date hub classifications
as the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) values in the DIP
set on average are lower than in the FYI set (Figure 1). After
adjustment of the cutoffs, most of the FYI party hubs also
qualify as party hubs in the DIP network and the FYI date
hubs as DIP date hubs (Figure 2). The resulting number of
proteins in each category in the respective data sets and their
average connectivities can be found in Table 1. Unless otherwise stated, the results derived from the two data sets were
qualitatively similar. It should be noted, however, that the
number of interactions in the DIP set is substantially larger,
resulting in larger separation between the connectivity
groups.
The reason why some proteins interact with a multitude of
proteins and others interact with only a few is not well understood. Clearly, the connectivity of a protein is related to its
function [18]. We found, using KOG [19] functional classification, that high connectivity is often associated with proteins
involved in 'Information storage and processing' (transcription in particular) and 'Cellular processes and signaling'.
Among the non-hubs, on the other hand, there are many proteins that participate in metabolism (Figure 3), and as
expected, proteins with poorly characterized functions frequently have few or no interactors. However, it is important
to bear in mind that there are numerous possible sources of
bias in the PPIN data that may affect these results. For
instance, since conserved proteins may be particularly

of ancient domains and few yeast specific domains compared
to date hubs.
In conclusion, the phylogenetic distribution of orthologs and
the domain content imply that hubs, particularly party hubs,
often are older than non-hubs. The non-hub group seems to
be a mixture of proteins of recent origin and ancient proteins,
whose low connectivity is probably related to the large fraction of proteins with metabolic functions. These results are
consistent with the finding that connectivity is related to protein age, although the oldest proteins are not necessarily the
most highly connected [18].

Duplicability of hub proteins

Hub assignment

(PHs) in the two data sets; DIP and FYI. In FYI there are 108 PHs and 91
DHs (middle circle), of which 23 DHs and 20 PHs have connectivities
below the hub threshold (k < 8) in DIP. Most of the FYI PHs (66) were
confirmed as PHs in the DIP set, while 22 fell below the PCC cutoff (see
Materials and methods). Furthermore, while most of the FYI DHs retained
their DH status using DIP, a small fraction of the FYI DHs (6) were
classified as PHs. Finally, 234 and 129 previously unclassified hubs were
assigned as DHs and PHs in DIP.

interesting for scientific studies, there could be some experimental bias for these interactions while there is a possible
bias against yeast-specific interactions [20] and interactions
involving membrane proteins.

The phylogenetic distribution of hub proteins
A recent study showed that party hubs are found in more
eukaryotic species than date hubs [15]. Here, we analyze the
phylogenetic distribution, as an estimate of age, of the proteins belonging to the different connectivity groups. Our
study shows that a larger fraction of the hub proteins, and
particularly party hubs, have eukaryotic orthologs compared
to the non-hubs (Table 2). Furthermore, party hubs more
often have orthologs in prokaryotes than do date hubs.
The domain contents of the proteins may provide further
clues about protein age [21]. Therefore, we assigned Pfam
[22] domains to all proteins and studied the phylogenetic distribution of the domains. The domains were classified as
ancient (found in eukaryotes and prokaryotes), eukaryote
specific, yeast specific or orphan (no homologs) (Figure 4).
Consistent with the results from the ortholog analysis, the
fraction of orphan and yeast specific domains in hubs is
smaller than for non-hubs. There are further differences
between the hub types; the party hubs have a higher fraction

The protein-protein interaction network is susceptible to targeted attacks on the hubs of the network [7,23]. Since hub
proteins are pivotal for the robustness of the protein-protein
network, it is conceivable that the S. cerevisiae genome may
contain more genetically redundant duplicates of the hubs
compared to other proteins. On the other hand, gene duplications may cause an imbalance in the concentration of the
components of protein-protein complexes that might be deleterious [24,25]. The first mechanism predicts that the hubs
should have a higher fraction of paralogs than other proteins.
In contrast, the latter mechanism, which is sometimes
referred to as dosage sensitivity, predicts the opposite.
We found that the fraction of hubs that have paralogs, that is,
duplicated proteins, is only slightly higher than for non-hubs
in the DIP set, while no significant difference is noted in the
FYI set. The small difference is in agreement with a recent
study [26]. In addition, we investigated the distribution of
recent paralogs between connectivity groups. S. cerevisiae
specific paralogs from the orthologous groups of KOG are
likely to be recent paralogs that evolved after the split
between S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe,
which occurred 330 to 420 million years ago. We here refer to
these paralogs as inparalogs [27]. Our results show that fewer
party hubs have inparalogs than other proteins (Figure 5),
which suggests that dosage sensitivity may be more important for the recent paralogs of party hubs than for the older
paralogs.
The ancestor of S. cerevisiae experienced a whole genome
duplication (WGD) event roughly 100 million years ago after
the divergence of Saccharomyces from Kluyveromyces [28].
Therefore, paralogous pairs of proteins pertaining to the
WGD event comprise a subset of the inparalog group. Single
gene duplications may result in a concentration imbalance of
the components of protein-protein complexes [24,25]. A similar concentration imbalance does not arise immediately subsequent to a WGD event but could occur later if the duplicate
genes are lost independently. Therefore, it might be expected
that the paralogs originating from this event, the ohnologs
[29], could be retained in the genome, as in the case of the
ribosomal genes [25]. There is a total of 551 pairs of retained

Figure 4
Protein age
Protein age. The age of a protein is here estimated from the age of its
domains. Domains may be found in: eukaryotes and prokaryotes
(Ancient); eukaryotes (Euk); or yeast. Domains and proteins that lack
homologs are called orphan domains (ODs) and orphan proteins (OPs).
The age of a single domain protein is equal to the age of its composing
domain, whereas each domain family represented in a multi-domain
protein contributes equally to its age classification. Furthermore, each
protein contributes equally to the age of its connectivity group. Hence, a
two-domain protein may be half ancient and half eukaryotic. The figure
shows fractions of proteins, that is, party hubs (PHs), date hubs (DHs) and
non-hubs (NHs) in each age class in DIP and FYI.

After the duplication, both copies may retain the same set of
interaction partners, or interactions could be lost and new
partners gained. In accordance with a previous study [30],
there is only a negligible correlation in connectivity (Cc =
0.05) between paralogs. Here, we studied proteins with one
single paralog only, since the relationship between proteins in
larger families is harder to establish. However, the paralogs of
hubs are more likely to be hubs themselves (45%) compared
to non-hubs (4%), which supports the redundancy theory.
Naturally, there is, in some cases, a sizable overlap between
the interactions of hubs and their paralogs. It is possible that
the paralogs of hub proteins provide distributed robustness,
which is likely to be important for mutational robustness [31],
to the PPIN, by sharing some of the functionality of the hubs.
Alternatively, these are pairs of proteins from recent duplications where overlapping interactions have not yet been lost.
In conclusion, we observe a smaller fraction of recent party
hub duplicates in S. cerevisiae compared to the fraction of
recent duplicates for other proteins. Further studies are
needed to determine the cause of this observation but it may
be the result of a relative increase in dosage sensitivity for
party hubs.

The impact of domain content, repeats and disordered
regions on connectivity
One reason for the higher complexity of eukaryotes compared
to prokaryotes is the increased number of domain combinations found in eukaryotes, where, for example, binding
domains have been added to existing catalytic proteins
[21,32]. The idea that multi-domain proteins can bind many
different proteins is intuitively appealing. Indeed, a large
fraction of the proteins in the network contain multiple
domains. Moreover, our results show that the proportion of
multi-domain proteins in hubs is larger than the correspond-

ohnologs (paralogs resulting from the whole genome duplication). In DIP,
the fraction of party hub inparalogs is small, approximately 0.2 compared
to approximately 0.4 for the other connectivity groups (P value <10-5), and
so is the fraction of ohnologs for party hubs compared to the other

5;

Many repeating domains have binding functions. The WD40
repeat, for example, functions in the formation of a multiprotein complex in transcription regulation and cell-cycle
control [33]. Therefore, it may be expected that proteins with
domain repeats are associated with high connectivities. Consistently, hub proteins contain an increased fraction of proteins that contain domain repeats compared to non-hubs (P
value <10-5; Figure 6). The difference persists after exclusion
of the two most common repeating domains in this data set,
WD40 and HEAT, and is hence not attributed to a single
domain family. In addition, we found a similar difference
between hubs and non-hubs in the interaction network of
Drosophila melanogaster (data not shown). The results do
not seem to be caused by elevated fractions of repeat proteins
in certain highly connected functional classes, since they persist in all four classes (data not shown). While the intermediately connected (IC) proteins display characteristics that fall
in-between those of the hub and non-hub groups, it is noteworthy that the domain repeats in the IC group are nearly as
scarce as among the non-hubs.
Disordered regions, that is, regions that lack a clear structure,
have been suggested to be important for flexible or rapidly
reversible binding, but may also serve as linkers between
domains [34-36]. These regions are found extensively in proteins pertaining to functional classes associated with high
connectivities, such as transcription, cell cycle control and
signaling [18,34]. In contrast, proteins involved in metabolism rarely contain disorder [37]. The binding flexibility may
result in higher connectivities for proteins containing such
regions [38]. Indeed, we found that hubs contain long disordered regions (≥ 40 residues) more often than non-hub proteins (Figure 6), and the difference is larger for longer

In conclusion, hubs are more often multi-domain proteins
compared to non-hubs and they frequently contain repeated
domains. Furthermore, date hubs contain more disordered
regions than party hubs, which suggests that disordered
regions are particularly important for the flexible binding of
date hubs.

The interaction partners of hub proteins
Hubs, by definition, bind to a large number of proteins.
According to a previous study, proteins with high connectivities bind to proteins of low connectivity [39], and they often
bind to proteins that originate from the same period in evolution [40]. In addition, proteins that interact often belong to
the same functional category [20]. Clearly, the nature of the
interactions in which the party hubs are involved may be different from that of the date hub interactions, since, for

information

It is possible that long disordered regions are predicted more
frequently in longer proteins. To test if the over representation of long disordered regions in date hubs was in fact an
artifact of the longer average length of the proteins in this
group, we created a subset consisting of 3,218 non-hubs with
a similar length distribution to that of the hubs. The fraction
of proteins with long disordered regions increased slightly (to
41%) but was still significantly lower than the fraction in date
hubs. Therefore, disorder seems to be a genuine characteristic of date hubs. Naturally, many short proteins were
removed, and the fraction of multi-domain proteins
increased in the length-normalized subset of non-hubs so
that the fraction become similar to the hub set. In contrast,

the lower fraction of proteins with repeated domains among
non-hubs remained.

is only among the date hubs that long disordered regions are
significantly enriched (P value <10-5), which is even more
pronounced in the FYI data set (Figure 6d).

example, the latter interactions are more likely to be transient. In the previous section we showed that date hubs have
a larger proportion of long disordered regions compared to
party hubs, which indicates that the disordered regions may
be important for flexible binding. To further elucidate the difference between the interaction properties of party hubs and
date hubs, we have studied their respective clustering coefficients and interaction partners.

tions can be explained by interactions with paralogs. A looser
definition of homology is the sharing of a domain family. A
domain that is recurring in all neighbor proteins could also
provide a necessary binding site; however, binding may
sometimes be mediated by short linear motifs [42]. Here, we
refer to the domain shared by the largest number of the neighboring proteins as the most frequently shared domain
(MFSD).

It is notable that party hubs often interact with each other
(Figure 7). Consistently, party hubs have neighbors that often
interact, as seen by the higher clustering coefficient for party
hubs (0.27) than for date hubs (0.18) (P value <10-5; Figure
8). Our data suggest that the previously observed small
number of connections between highly connected proteins
[39] is restricted to a limited number of interactions between
date hubs and party hubs, which might translate into a small
number of connection paths between the functional modules
represented by the party hubs.

There are examples of proteins that interact only with proteins containing the MFSD and other flexible proteins that
interact with more than 30 different proteins where only a
few of the interactors share a domain (Additional file 2).
Some domain families are more likely to be shared by a large
number of the neighbors. The most frequent MFSDs are Pkinase and WD40, which are the MFSDs for more than 50 hubs
each. Certainly, there is a recurrence of domain families in the
interacting proteins of most hubs; on average, however, only
one fourth of the interacting proteins share the MFSD, both
in party hubs and date hubs, which is still more than expected
in a random network (0.11, P value <<10-5). Furthermore, in
as many as 23% of the hubs, the MFSD in the interactors is
shared with the hub, a feature almost twice as frequent in
party hubs as in date hubs. Such same-domain-interactions
(SDIs) are found between proteins containing, for example,
Pkinase, LSM, proteasome and AAA domains, and, among all
the interaction pairs in the PPIN, 7.6% of the interactions are
SDIs, which is more than expected in a randomized network
(1.2%, P value <10-5). Thus, the party hubs often contain the
domains that are most common among their interaction partners. This is, at least partly, due to the fact that some complexes consist of several paralogous sequences.

Further, we wanted to investigate how specialized the hubs
are in their binding. In other words, are these highly connected proteins hubs because they interact with many similar
proteins, or because they are able to interact with many different partners with diverse domain compositions? If hubs
gained interactions through duplication of their neighbors,
many neighbors would be paralogs. This has been found in
some complexes, which consist of paralogous sequences [41],
for example, the Septin ring. However, interactions are often
lost by one of the paralogs soon after duplication [30]. Consistently, in our data set there is an average of approximately
1.2 sequences from each paralogous family in the hub-interacting proteins, that is, only a small fraction of the interac-

[16,17] downloaded in March 2005. A second PPI data set was
also used, the FYI from Han et al., which contains 1,379
proteins with 2,493 interactions [14]. The PPI data for D. melanogaster was downloaded from the DIP in January 2005.

Neighbors of proteins of low connectivity (white nodes), party hubs (green nodes) and date hubs (yellow nodes); an example. a) Non-hub protein PGM1
(YKL127W, large node) is the metabolic enzyme phosphoglucomutase, which consists of four well characterized domains associated with
phosphoglucomutase activity. PGM1 is only connected to two other proteins, which are not hubs. b) Party hub protein CDC16 (YKL022C, large node) is
an essential protein and is part of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). It contains six tetratricopeptide domains, one additional Pfam-A domain, two
Pfam-B domains and three orphan domains (blue rectangles). CDC16 interacts with party hubs, date hubs as well as two IC and NH proteins. c) Date hub
protein NUP1 (YOR098C, large node) is a nuclear pore complex protein of diverse function which contains three Pfam-B domains, two orphan domains
and one long disordered region (dashed). It interacts with other date hubs, party hubs and several non hub proteins. The network figures were drawn
using BioLayout[52].

The connectivity (k) of a protein node is defined as the
number of proteins it is connected to, including possible selfinteractions. The proteins were grouped according to their
connectivities in the core interaction network. Hubs are
defined in DIP as proteins with eight or more interactions
while proteins with less than four interactions are named
non-hubs and the rest are intermediately connected. For simplicity, the results for the latter group are not described here.
Unless otherwise stated, the results for this group are, as
expected, in-between those of the hub and non-hub groups.
The number of proteins and the average connectivities for the
respective groups are found in Table 1. Hubs in FYI are
proteins with k ≥ 6 [14], whereas non-hubs have k ≤ 1. We
chose to use different cutoffs for non-hubs in order to include
similar numbers of proteins in this group in both data sets.

deposited research

An important question is what leads to the high connectivity
of hub proteins? Perhaps surprisingly, our findings show that
domain recurrence among hub interaction partners can only
explain some of the interactions in the network and,
furthermore, hubs do not interact particularly often with paralogous groups of proteins. It is quite likely that the interaction data sets contain at least some indirect interactions, that
is, interactions mediated through a third protein. In particular, interaction data sets derived from TAP data could be rich
in such interactions. Nevertheless, we found that some properties are common among the hub proteins of the S. cerevisiae protein-protein interaction network. There is an
enrichment of multi-domain proteins among the hub proteins compared to non-hub proteins, and they are, on average, longer. Moreover, repeated domains are clearly overrepresented in hub proteins. The presence of repeated
domains and multiple domains in hubs may partly explain
their high connectivities.

Materials and methods

reports

We found that the duplicability of hub proteins is similar to
that of other proteins. However, very few static hub (party
hub) paralogs originate from relatively recent duplications.
We hypothesize that the number of retained party hub duplicates has decreased relative to the duplicates of non-hubs
during the evolution of S. cerevisiae. Although there may be
other explanations, it is possible that the dosage sensitivity of
party hubs has increased in comparison to other proteins
through evolution.

Finally, there are properties that differentiate the party hubs
from the dynamic hubs (date hubs). For instance, the party
hubs self-interact to a greater extent than date hubs. In addition, party hubs interact with proteins with which they share
domains more often than date hubs, whereas date hubs contain more long disordered regions. Our findings suggest that
while repeats and multiple domains promote protein-protein
interactions in general, disordered regions are of particular
importance for the flexible interactions of date hubs.

Conclusion

Ekman et al. R45.9

comment

However, our results indicate that hubs do not interact particularly often with paralogous groups of proteins. Neither can
recurrence of domains in interaction partners explain much
of the interactions in the network. Furthermore, we noted
that multi-domain hub proteins have somewhat more diverse
binding partners than single domain hubs. The partner flexibility also seems to be higher in proteins with disordered
regions or domain repeats (data not shown). In conclusion,
the high connectivity of hub proteins in the S. cerevisiae PPIN
can, to some extent, be explained by disorder, domain
repeats, several binding sites, interactions with and between
homologous proteins as well as proteins consisting of
domains associated with many diverse binding partners, such
as kinases.

Protein age was estimated from the domain contents.
Domains were assigned to 21 species, 7 from each kingdom
(for species see Ekman et al. [21]). The domains were then
grouped into those present in: eukaryotes and prokaryotes;

Z scores were calculated in the following manner to estimate
the statistical significance of our results. For example, to
determine the significance of the distribution of inparalogs
between party hubs and other proteins, the connectivity
classes were randomized and the number of inparalogs in the
two classes was calculated. This process was iterated 10,000
times and the average and standard deviation from the randomizations were used to calculate the Z score:
Z = ( n - r )/stdev(r)
where n is the real number of inparalogs in a connectivity
class k and r is the result from the randomized network. In a
similar manner, the Z scores for the distribution of ohnologs,
clustering coefficients, proteins with repeats and proteins
containing disorder were calculated.

Domains from Pfam-A [22] were assigned to each sequence in
the yeast genome with HMMER-2.0 [48], using a cutoff of
0.1. Repeating domains, defined as two adjacent domains
from the same family, are often not recognized at this threshold; therefore, the threshold for including an additional
domain from the same family was set to 10. Pfam-B domains
were then assigned to sequences and regions lacking Pfam-A
domains. The number of domains in proteins was determined
according to a procedure presented elsewhere [21] as the sum
of the number of Pfam-A and Pfam-B domains and unassigned regions longer than 100 residues (orphan domains).
The yeast protein sequences were collected from the Saccharomyces Genome Database [49]. Only verified open reading
frames were included. Finally, disorder was predicted with
Disopred2 [34] at a 5% expected rate of false positives.

refereed research

Domain assignment

Clusters of orthologous groups (COG) [50] and KOG [19],
were used to define orthologs in prokaryotes and eukaryotes,
respectively. Functional categories given by KOG were used
as the functional classification of the proteins. KOG, complemented by two-species groups (TWOGs) and lineage-specific
extensions (LSEs), was also used to find inparalogs [27]. All S.
cerevisiae sequences in the same KOG, TWOG or LSE were
considered inparalogs unless they had completely different
domain architectures. We retrieved 551 pairs of paralogs that
originate from the whole genome duplication of S. cerevisiae
(ohnologs) from the Yeast Gene Order Browser [29] and these
were also included in the inparalog set. Paralogous sequences
were retrieved using a Blastp [51] all-against-all search. Paralogs were defined as sequences with an e-value below 10-5 and
an alignment covering more than 40% of the longest of the
compared sequences. Proteins of at least two domains and
identical Pfam-A or Pfam-A+B domain architectures were
also considered paralogous if their lengths did not differ by
more than 30% of the longer sequence. The fractions of proteins with paralogs were calculated as the number of proteins
that have paralogs, that is, that are not singletons, divided by
the number of proteins. Hence, if a hub is paralogous to a protein that is also a hub, both of them will be counted as proteins
with paralogs.

deposited research

For a node N with n neighbors there are ((n) × (n - 1))/2 possible undirected edges between the n neighbor nodes. The
clustering coefficient is the actual number of edges between
the neighbors n of N divided by the number of possible edges
between the nodes.

Clustering coefficient

eukaryotes only; S. cerevisiae and/or S. pombe (yeast); and
no species (orphans). Proteins with no domain assignments
were considered orphan proteins. To avoid bias toward
repeating domains, each domain family represented in the
protein contributed equally to the age class of the protein,
that is, repeating domains were only counted once. Furthermore, each protein lends an equal contribution to the age of
the connectivity group, irrespective of domain number.
Hence, a five domain protein consisting of four ancient
domains A and one eukaryotic domain B is half ancient and
half eukaryotic.

The difference between the hub classifications derived from
the DIP and FYI datasets is shown in Figure 2. A number of
ribosomal hub proteins were excluded from the FYI classification [14]. As the connectivity of these proteins in the DIP set
was below the hub cutoff, this was not necessary here.

Ekman et al. R45.11

comment

romone treatment [45], sporulation [46] and unfolded protein responses [47]) were normalized with Z score
normalization using the original log2 fold change values. The
average PCC between each hub and its interaction partners
was calculated for the five conditions and for the combined
set of all conditions. Party hubs are defined as proteins that
show high average PCC with their interaction partners. In the
FYI set there was a bimodal distribution of the average PCC
values, which was used to distinguish party hubs from date
hubs. However, we found no clear bimodal distribution in the
DIP set and, in addition, the average PCC values were
generally lower in the DIP set than in the FYI set (Figure 1).
Therefore, we used lower thresholds for separating date and
party hubs in the DIP set. To maximize the overlap between
the hub classifications in FYI and DIP, the threshold was set
to 0.4 for all conditions, except for the combined set and
stress response (0.35) as well as cell cycle (0.3). Clearly, the
choice of thresholds is somewhat arbitrary. However, increasing or decreasing the threshold by 0.1 has only minor effects
on the results.

In the case of the Z score calculation for the MFSD, the connections in the protein interaction network were shuffled and
the domain compositions were retained. The result from the
real network was compared to the result from the randomized
network by calculating the Z score as above where n is the
average proportion of proteins with the most common
domain in the real network for a certain connectivity class k
and r is the same number for the randomized networks. In a
similar manner, the Z scores for the same-domain-interactions were calculated for the party hub and date hub groups.
The P value was then derived from the Z score assuming a
normal distribution.
