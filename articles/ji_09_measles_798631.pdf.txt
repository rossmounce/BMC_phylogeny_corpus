Abstract
Measles morbidity and mortality decreased significantly after measles vaccine was introduced into
China in 1965. From 1995 to 2004, average annual measles incidence decreased to 5.6 cases per
100,000 population following the establishment of a national two-dose regimen. Molecular
characterization of wild-type measles viruses demonstrated that genotype H1 was endemic and
widely distributed throughout the country in China during 1995-2004. A total of 124,865 cases and
55 deaths were reported from the National Notifiable Diseases Reporting System (NNDRS) in
2005, which represented a 69.05% increase compared with 2004. Over 16,000 serum samples
obtained from 914 measles outbreaks and the measles IgM positive rate was 81%. 213 wild-type
measles viruses were isolated from 18 of 31 provinces in China during 2005, and all of the isolates
belonged to genotype H1. The ranges of the nucleotide sequence and predicted amino acid
sequence homologies of the 213 genotype H1 strains were 93.4%-100% and 90.0%-100%,
respectively. H1-associated cases and outbreaks caused the measles resurgence in China in 2005.
H1 genotype has the most inner variation within genotype, it could be divided into 2 clusters, and
cluster 1 viruses were predominant in China throughout 2005.

Background
Countries in the Western Pacific Region of the World
Health Organization (WHO) have identified 2012 as the
target year to eliminate measles [1]. Measles continues to
be a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality
in developing countries and an outbreak threat in the
majority of countries, despite the availability of an effective vaccine for 40 years [2,3].
Measles virus (MeV) is a monotype virus, but genetic variability exists among wild type strains [4]. Actually, 23
genotypes (A, B1-B3, C1-C2, D1-D10, E, F, G1-G3 and
H1-H2) have been recognized circulating in different
parts of the world by WHO, however five of which (B1,
D1, E, F, and G1) were considered inactive since they have
not been detected in the past 15 years [5,6]. Molecular epidemiologic studies can help to measure the transmission
pathways of MeV and to clarify epidemiological links during outbreaks. Virological surveillance can also help to
measure the success of measles vaccination programs by
documenting the interruption of transmission of the
endemic viral genotype(s) [7,8].
Measles morbidity and mortality decreased distinctly after
measles vaccine was introduced into China in 1965. From
1995 to 2004, the average annual measles incidence
decreased to 5.6 cases per 100,000 population following
the establishment of a national two-dose regimen. However, the introduction of multiple outbreaks and sporadic
measles cases into highly mobile communities and the
accumulation of susceptible adults caused a massive
spread of measles throughout China during 2005. Following standard surveillance protocols (cite WHO lab manual) serum samples and throat swabs were obtained from
the suspected measles cases in 18 of 31 provinces. Measles
IgM detection was used to confirm the outbreaks as being
due to measles and virus isolations were performed to
allow genetic characterization of the circulating strains of
MeV.

Results
Epidemiology
In 2005, China experienced a large measles epidemic. A
total of 124,865 cases with 55 fatalities cases were
reported by NNDRS. In 14 of 31 provinces the measles
incidence was >10/100,000 (Figure 1, 2). Totally, there
were 914 measles outbreaks with onset in 2005 and these
occurred in all 31 provinces in China. Thirty-seven percent of the cases were in the "floating populations", which
are defined as persons who do not have a permanent residence card for the place in which they reside, and the proportion was over 50% in some developed provinces and
big cities. The age distribution of measles changed in
2005. Compared to 2004, the measles cases in those <1
and ≥ 15 years old increased, especially in well-developed

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/135

provinces such as Zhejiang, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai
(Figure 3). Although the age-specific incidence of measles
cases reported nationally was highest under 12 months,
the proportion of measles cases among those aged 0-14
year-old decreased by 85% compared to 2004. In all,
approximately 20% of measles cases occurred in infants
under 12 months in 2005. The peak of incidence of measles occurred in the early spring.
IgM detection
In 2005, 16,017 serum samples from 914 measles outbreaks throughout China were detected for IgM. The positive rate of measles IgM was 81% and 872 of 914 measles
outbreaks were confirmed serologically.
Molecular characterization
Two hundred and thirteen wild-type measles viruses were
isolated from 18 of 31 provinces in China during 2005
(Table 1). Phylogenetic analysis compared the sequences
of the nucleotides coding for the carboxy terminal 150
amino acids of the N protein to the sequences of the WHO
reference strains[6,9,10] (Figure 4). The clustering of
MeVs in China within the genotype H1 was supported by
a significant bootstrap value (500 replicates) 97% (Figure
4). Genotype H1 which was the indigenous strain in
China was still the predominant circulating genotype in
2005. According to the reports about measles virus circulating in 1993-2004[11,12], H1 genotype has the greatest
intra-genotype variation among all genotypes. Subsequent studies divided genotype H1 into 2 clusters,
Cluster1, Cluster2 [11-15]. The phylogenetic tree showed
that the sequences of genotype H1 viruses formed two
major clusters (Figure 4). The amount of nucleotide variation between the two clusters was 6.6% in 2005. The
phylogenetic analysis of the wild-type measles virus from
China and the neighboring countries (South Korea, Japan,
and Vietnam) showed that (Figure 5), with the exception
of 13 sequences from Shandong, Zhejiang and Hebei
provinces assigned to Cluster2, the remaining strains were
members of Cluster1. Cluster1 represented the predominant lineage of endemic measles viruses in the measles
outbreak in China in 2005. The Cluster2 was detected in
only 3 provinces in 2005.

The ranges of the nucleotide sequence and predicted
amino acid sequence homologies of the 213 genotype H1
strains were 93.4%-100% and 90.0%-100%, respectively.
The homology of nucleotide and amino acid sequences
were 84.7%-92.5% and 88.0%-92.5% respectively, when
compared with that of the S191, which measles vaccine
strain was used in China from 1965 to 2005.
The MV strains isolated from Japan, MVi/Tokyo.JPN/
20.00 and MVi/Fuji.JPN/21.02, also have the identical
sequence with Chinese endemic measles strains. Thus, the

A and B variant of cluster 1(Figure 5) caused outbreak or/
and sporadic cases in China during 1998-2005 and Japan
in 2000 and 2002 [16-18]. Within the Cluster1 group,
there was 3.3% nucleotide variation in the N gene
between Chinese viruses and wiled-type measles viruses
isolated in Japan and Korea during 2000 to 2002. H1 genotype, as an imported genotype, was also sporadically
detected in Europe in 2005, sequence analysis confirmed
suspected sources of importation [19]. In China, all major
measles epidemics were associated with genotype Cluster
1 in 2005.

Discussion
In China, measles has been classified a class B reportable
disease since 1950. A two-dose measles vaccination program was introduced into China from 1986, with the first
dose of vaccine administered to children at 8 months and
the second dose at 7 years of age. After the vaccination
plan was established, measles morbidity and mortality

decreased distinctly. The current National Measles Surveillance Plan divides the provinces into national control
groups. The overall incidence of measles was <8/10,000
population during 1995-2004. Provinces in Group A having an average measles incidence <6/100,000 population
are developed areas and have elimination and outbreak
prevention goal. Whereas, Group B (>6/100,000) provinces belong to developing areas and have a measles accelerating control goal [12].
In 2005, 5 of 31 provinces reported a measles incidence of
<5/100,000. Many well-developed provinces on the east
coast, that previously had low incidence rates, reported
high measles incidence in 2005. The 37 percent of measles
cases was happened in the floating population and the
proportion was over 50% in some developed provinces
and big cities. Floating people would be target group to
induce measles outbreak in the cities. The age-specific
incidence of measles cases was highest under 12 months

and declined with increasing age from 1995-2005. However, the incidence increased in infants <1 year old, adolescents and adults >15 years old, compared to 1995 to
2004. Although the developed provinces had different
incidence rates, there were no major differences in the age
distribution of cases. Furthermore, the change of the measles vaccine regimen, in which the second dose was
administered to children at 18-24 months from 2005,
could have attributed to the change in age distribution. In
2005, there were two provinces with lower incidence,
Guizhou and Xinjiang, which were performed by Highquality supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in
2004.
Genetic analysis of wild-type measles viruses has provided
an increasingly comprehensive picture of the worldwide
distribution of MV genotypes [5]. In China, the initial
sequencing of measles viruses was identified as a new
clade H in 1998 [13,15].
In comparison with the molecular characterization of
MeVs in China during 1993-2004, there was no change in

genotypes in China, 2005. Gentype H1 viruses continued
to circulate and were associated with imported cases in
other countries [12,17,19,20]. The major neutralization
sites and N-glycosylation sites in the hemagglutinin were
not changed in the more recent genotype H1 viruses compared to those isolates [15]. More importantly, post-vaccination serum from individual receiving the Chinese
vaccine strain, S-191, neutralized the Edmonston strain to
titers that were 2-5-fold higher than the wild-type strains
isolated in 1993, 1994, 1999 and 2002 (unpublished
data) Therefore, the amino acid mutation in the H protein
of the Chinese viruses did not appear to the result in loss
of mayor neutralization epitopes by cross antibody
induced following vaccination. Genetic analysis of wildtype measles isolates after the measles outbreak throughout China in 2005 indicated H1 still is the predominant
genotype at present. Sequence analysis did not detect suspected sources of importation in China. Moreover, spread
and prolonged circulation of similar strains has continued
to cause a high number of measles cases throughout
China for 13 years. As a consequence, to achieve measles
elimination by 2012, measles surveillance and control
need to be further optimized, and specific emphasis must
be given to the vaccination of hard-to-reach populations.

Conclusion
This study reported that the measles resurgence was
caused by co-criculationg of cluster1 and cluster2 subgenotypes measles virus in China, 2005. The baseline data of

virological surveillance can help to the development of
improved measles control programs in China. Therefore,
to eliminate measles from the Western Pacific Region by
2012, the goal set by WHO, strengthening virological surveillance capacity is crucial for monitoring the progress in
measles elimination.

Materials and methods
Epidemiology data source
Numbers and descriptive information of measles cases
and deaths in this report were from National Notifiable
Diseases Reporting System of China CDC (NNDRS).
Specimens collection and Virus isolation
Urine, throat swab and blood samples were collected
from patients who had acute, febrile maculopapular rash
from different provinces in China. All clinical samples
were collected within five days of rash onset and transported in accordance with standard protocols[21]. Isolation of MeV was performed using the Vero/hSLAM cell
line and the cells were harvested when the cytopathic
effect (CPE) was visible over at least 50-75% of the cell
layer[6].
Serological testing
Commercial Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay
(ELISA) tests were used to detect measles IgM antibody of
outbreak cases through Chinese Measles Laboratory Network.
RNA Extraction and RT-PCR
RNA was extracted from 250 μl of infected cell lysate using
a Trizol reagent, followed by the manufacturer's instructions. For all virus isolates, RT-PCR amplification was performed using previously described primers to amplify a
600 bp fragment in the N gene which included the 450 bp
fragment recommended for genotyping [12]. PCR products were purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit
(QIAGEN).
Sequence analysis
Sequences of the PCR products were derived by automated sequencing and the BigDye terminator v2.0 chemistry according to the manufacturer's protocol in both
sense and antisense strands by an automated ABI PRISM™
3100 DNA Sequencer (Perkin Elmer), Sequence proof
reading and editing was conducted with Sequencer™
(Gene Codes Corporation). Sequence data were analyzed
by using version 7.0 of Bioedit and phylogenetic analyses
were performed using Bioedit and Mega4 [22]. The
robustness of the groupings was assessed using boorstrap
resampling of 500 replicates and the trees were visualized
with Mega programs. A total of 127 representative nucleotide sequences data were deposited in GenBank under
accession numbers: FJ602549-FJ602674.
