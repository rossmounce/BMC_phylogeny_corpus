Structural and functional studies of STAT1 from
Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)
Astrid Skjesol1, Tom Hansen1, Cheng-Yin Shi1,2, Hanna L Thim1, Jorunn B Jørgensen1*

Abstract
Background: Type I and type II interferons (IFNs) exert their effects mainly through the JAK/STAT pathway, which
is presently best described in mammals. STAT1 is involved in signaling pathways induced by both types of IFNs. It
has a domain-like structure including an amino-terminus that stabilizes interaction between STAT dimers in a
promoter-binding situation, a coiled coil domain facilitating interactions to other proteins, a central DNA-binding
domain, a SH2 domain responsible for dimerization of phosphorylated STATs and conserved phosphorylation sites
within the carboxy terminus. The latter is also the transcriptional activation domain.
Results: A salmon (Salmo salar) STAT1 homologue, named ssSTAT1a, has been identified and was shown to be
ubiquitously expressed in various cells and tissues. The ssSTAT1a had a domain-like structure with functional motifs
that are similar to higher vertebrates. Endogenous STAT1 was shown to be phosphorylated at tyrosine residues
both in salmon leukocytes and in TO cells treated with recombinant type I and type II IFNs. Also ectopically
expressed ssSTAT1 was phosphorylated in salmon cells upon in vitro stimulation by the IFNs, confirming that the
cloned gene was recognized by upstream tyrosine kinases. Treatment with IFNs led to nuclear translocation of
STAT1 within one hour. The ability of salmon STAT1 to dimerize was also shown.
Conclusions: The structural and functional properties of salmon STAT1 resemble the properties of mammalian
STAT1.

Background
Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines that play a major role in
host defense against viral pathogens [1,2]. Mammalian
type I IFNs (IFNa/b) are produced by many cell types
and confer antiviral activities on them, while type II IFN
(IFNg) is produced mainly by T lymphocytes and natural
killer cells when stimulated by macrophage derived
cytokines. IFNg elicits broad effects, particularly on cells
of the immune system. The transmission of both type I
IFNs and IFNg signals are dependent on the activation
of the transcription factor STAT1 (signal transducer and
activator of transcription). STAT family proteins are critical to the action of most cytokines and growth factors,
as they are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that
directly activate signaling pathways upon being phosphorylated [3-5].
The activation of STAT is encompassed as part of
evolutionary conserved pathways by which signals can

be transduced from the membrane to the nucleus
rapidly. The classical view is that type I IFN (IFNa/b)
signals through STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers, while
IFNg signals through STAT1 homodimers [6,7]. The
binding of secreted type I IFNs to the two subunit
receptor (IFNAR1/IFNAR2) results in activation of the
Janus-activated kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2
(TYK2), which are associated with the cytoplasmic tail
of IFNAR1/2. The signal is cascaded further by tyrosine
phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 [3,8,9]. The
STATs heterodimerize and together with interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) form a complex named ISGF3.
This complex enters the nucleus where it associates
with specific promoter elements (termed the IFN-stimulated response element or ISRE) to activate the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) [9]. IFNg
signals through an IFNg-specific receptor (IFNGR1/
IFNGR2) to JAK1 and JAK2 resulting in tyrosine phosporylation and homodimerization of STAT1 [10].
STAT1 homodimers enter the nucleus and bind the
IFNg-activation site (GAS) which is present in the

promoter of certain ISGs [3,11]. However, in addition to
the phosphotyrosine SH2 domain interactions of the
active forms of STATs, unphosphorylated STATs can
form dimers of a different conformation through their
N-terminal domain [12]. Also, STAT1 can be found in
both the cytoplasm and the nucleus without cytokine
stimulation of cells [13].
Facilitated nuclear translocation of such large complexes requires the nuclear pore complex [5,14]. STAT1
and STAT2 do not contain classical nuclear localization
signals (NLS) which is normally necessary to be recognized by the importin receptor, but dimerization of
STATs results in conformational changes that establish
NLS activity [13,15,16]. After activation of their target
genes, STATs are dephosphorylated, released from the
DNA and shuttled back to the cytoplasm [12,17,18].
Consistent with the importance of this pathway in mediating the actions of IFNs, mice with no STAT1 have no
innate response to either bacterial or viral infections as
a result of dysfunctional IFN signaling [19]. Moreover, a
number of viruses have the capacity to block the activation of STAT1 by IFN to evade the defense from the
host immune system [20].
Recently, significant progress has been made in identifying and characterizing fish genes related to the IFN
system, including several type I IFN genes [21-23], IFNg
[24-28] and antiviral genes [23]. Far less is known about
the factors that are involved in IFN-signaling in fish,
including the JAK-STAT pathway, although STAT1
homologs have been cloned from several fish species
[29-31]. Additionally, a STAT2 gene was recently identified in salmon [32], and TYK2 and JAK1 have been
cloned from green pufferfish (Tetraodon fluviatilis)
[33,34].
In the present work we describe the identification and
characterization of a STAT1 gene from Atlantic salmon.
To get insight into the role of STAT1 in response to
cytokines and viruses in salmon we have studied the
expression and activation of STAT1 in primary leukocyte cultures and in different salmonid cell-lines upon
type I and type II IFN treatment and viral infections.
The ability of STAT1 to be phosphorylated and to
translocate to the nucleus is critical for its role as a
transcription factor. By employing a salmon STAT1
antibody the localization of STAT1 in different cells in
response to IFN-treatment were studied. Furthermore,
STAT1 phosphorylation was detected using a phosphotyrosine specific antibody after treatment with the same
stimulants. Such studies have not been performed in
any teleost species earlier. Both IFN-a1 and IFNg treatment led to tyrosine phosphorylation and STAT1 was
also shown to be translocated to the nucleus after stimulation with IFN-a1 and IFNg. We also show, using

two different in vitro methods, that salmon STAT1 is
able to form dimers.

Results
Cloning of STAT1

With primers derived from a rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) STAT1 sequence we obtained a 2.3 kB
DNA fragment by PCR using cDNA from salmon ovaries and HK. Sequencing of the cloned fragment revealed
a 2 274 base pairs long open reading frame which translated into an amino acid sequence with strong homology
to the rainbow trout STAT1 sequence (97.6% identity,
98.8% similarity). This salmon sequence was 3 amino
acids longer than the rainbow trout sequence, and had a
predicted molecular mass of 87.5 kDa. While preparing
this manuscript two other STAT1 sequences from
Atlantic salmon were submitted to the GenBank database (accession numbers EU016199[31] and BT045567).
These two sequences shared 96.3% and 98.3% identity,
respectively, to our clone. Our sequence was named
ssSTAT1a (GenBank accession number GQ325309).
The major differences found between the three salmon
sequences were located in the C-terminal end (Figure
1), where EU016199 has two single nucleotide deletions
when compared to ssSTAT1a (T missing in position
2190, and T missing in position 2201), which leads to
frame shifts and subsequently a premature stop. In
BT045567 is found an insertion of 39 nucleotides (13
amino acids) in the C-terminus when compared to
ssSTAT1a (Figure 1). PCR primers were designed in an
attempt to pick up, and to distinguish between the
ssSTAT1/EU016199 and BT045567 variants. The primer
pair (rtSTAT1fw + ssSTATgap rev, Table 1) would
detect only the BT045567 variant and give a PCR product of 72 nucleotides. However, using this strategy we
were unable to amplify the BT045567 variant in cDNA
from both stimulated and unstimulated salmon leukocytes (results not shown).
The amino acid sequence of ssSTAT1a was compared
to known STAT1 sequences from other species (Additional file 1, Supplemental Table S1) and revealed high
homology, also with human and rat STAT1 (>60% identity, >80% similarity). The non-salmonid teleost species
that was found to share the highest homology to salmon
STAT1 was snakehead (Channa argus) STAT1 (80.1%
identity, 90.4% similarity), whereas crucian carp (Carassius auratus) had the lowest identity of the compared
species (58.4% identity, 75.7% similarity). In the presented phylogenetic tree ssSTAT1a is located in the
same clade as other piscine STAT1 sequences when
high bootstrap values were applied (Figure 2).
The amino acid sequence of the ssSTAT1a clone contained several prototypic features and conserved

domains crucial for STAT1 functions (Figure 1). In the
most C-terminal part of the sequence, the transcriptional activation domain (TAD), a conserved serine
phosphorylation site was found in position 719 (homologous to serine 727 in human STAT1). This phosphorylation site is known to be crucial for the activation of
transcription [35]. A conserved tyrosine residue was
located in position 695 (701 in human). Phosphorylation
of this tyrosine residue is crucial for activating the
STAT molecule and thereby enabling it to interact with
the phosphotyrosine binding pocket located in the Src
homology 2 (SH2) domain of other STAT molecules
[36]. An analysis of this conserved domain (using NCBI
CDD [37]) revealed that a phosphotyrosine binding

Tissue distribution of STAT1 mRNA

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was undertaken to
examine expression of STAT1 mRNA in different salmon tissues. A uniform distribution of ssSTAT1a
mRNA was observed in all tissues tested, including head
kidney, spleen, heart, gills and intestines, derived from
10 unvaccinated and healthy salmon controls (Figure 3).

pocket was located in SH2 of ssSTAT1a, where all four
of the residues composing this feature was present,
which of the conserved arginine at position 597 is
believed to be the most crucial for forming H-bonds
with phosphate oxygens of the phosphotyrosine side
chain [38]. In addition residues important for DNAbinding (DNAB), nuclear import (NLS) and export
(NES) [15,39-41] were found to be conserved between
mammalian and teleost STAT1. Residues crucial for
these functions are marked with asterisks in Figure 1.

Induction and expression of STAT1 protein in salmon
primary cells

For detection of STAT1 protein in salmon cells, a custom
made peptide antibody was applied for Western blotting.
Primary cells from salmon were subjected to Western
blotting upon stimulation with both type I and type II
IFN (Figure 4). In unstimulated adherent HK leukocytes
(mostly monocytes and macrophages) (Figure 4A) the
STAT1 protein was barely detectable, while the STAT1
levels were increased upon both IFN-a1 and IFNg stimulation, showing maximum levels at 96 h post stimulation.
Individual variations among the fish tested were

observed, as exemplified in Figure 4, where increased
STAT1 levels upon stimulation were induced earlier in
Fish 2 compared to Fish 1. In splenocytes (mostly lymphocytes) (Figure 4B) a more even STAT1 expression
pattern was seen when comparing non-treated cells with
the stimulated cells, indicating that STAT1 expression
levels in splenocytes were less affected by IFN treatment,

but with a slight up-regulation after IFNg stimulation.
Mx protein was detected on the same membranes after
stripping and reprobing with an Mx antibody. For HK
leukocytes the relative increase in Mx expression
occurred earlier than the increase in STAT1 expression,
while the splenocytes showed a constitutive Mx expression which paralleled the STAT1 expression.

were tested.

Transcription levels of salmon STAT1 mRNA in salmon
HK leukocytes

To determine whether the increase in STAT1 protein
expression upon type I and type II IFN treatment of HK
leukocytes were induced at transcriptional levels, the
amount of mRNA was measured at various times after
stimulation, by real-time RT-PCR. A representative
experiment is shown in Figure 5. Both types of IFNs
induced STAT1 expression levels slightly above unstimulated cells. In cells isolated from three fish, IFN-a1
caused an average increase in transcription of STAT1
ranging from a 2-fold induction at 4 h through nearly
10-fold induction at 12 h and then a small decline at
24 h (9-fold induction). The levels of STAT1 transcripts
after stimulation with IFNg did barely change relative to
the unstimulated control at the time points investigated,
with a peak at 3-fold increase at 12 h (Figure 5A). To
verify the activity of the IFNs used, the levels of Mx
transcripts were recorded in the same samples. At 24 h
the Mx transcripts were induced to a level 90 times
above the unstimulated cells when IFN-a1 was added to
the cells, whereas the IFNg-induced transcription was
11-fold increased at the same time point (Figure 5B).
STAT1 protein expression levels in TO and CHSE-214
cells upon IFN-treatment and viral infections

Two salmonid cell-lines, TO and CHSE-214 cells,
known to be permissive for several viruses, were tested
for expression of STAT1 protein upon stimulation with
different cytokines or virus. In unstimulated CHSE-214
cells expression of STAT1 protein was barely detectable,

while a modest induction upon IFN-a1 or IFNg stimulation was found (Figure 6A). Infection with IPNV at
MOI of 4 for 12, 24 or 48 h, did not increase protein
expression above the level of uninfected cells (Figure
6B). Also infections with Norwegian field isolates of
highly virulent IPNV strains showed the same results
(results not shown). Also induced STAT1 levels were
found in TO cells after 24 h of exposure to IFN-a1 or
IFNg. However, neither infection with IPNV (for 12, 24
and 48 h) nor ISAV (for 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h)
increased STAT1 expression. Mx protein was, however,
induced after 24 h and 48 h of ISAV infection.
Subcellular localization of STAT1

The subcellular localization of STAT1 after type I and II
IFN stimulation in salmon primary leukocytes and salmonid cell-lines was examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. For this purpose cells were seeded on
coverslips and stimulated for 1 h and 4 h with 10 U/ml
IFN-a1 and 200 ng/ml of IFNg. The cells were then
fixed and immunostained for STAT1 as described in the
Methods section. In all cell types studied, STAT1 (red
dye) localized exclusively to the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells (Figure 7A, B and 7C). In primary cells from
Atlantic salmon HK, a relocalization of STAT1 from the
cytoplasm to the nucleus took place after stimulation
with IFNg for 1 h and STAT1 was still retained in the
nuclei at 4 h (Figure 7A), although individual variations
in the kinetics occurred among the 3 fish studied. In
TO cells the response to IFNg seemed more transient
than in the primary cells. At 1 h after IFNg stimulation,

some of the nuclei in the TO cells had already been
stained with STAT1 and after 4 h STAT1 had relocated
to the cytoplasm (Figure 7B). CHSE-214 cells did not
respond to IFNg with STAT1 translocation at the time
points studied (Figure 7C). Relocalization of STAT1
after IFN-a1 stimulation was not observed by microscopy in any of the cell types at the time points chosen
in this study. As a consequence of the inability of
detecting STAT1 in the nucleus by immunostaining and
confocal laser scanning microscopy following IFN-a1 stimulation, nuclear extracts of IFN-a1 stimulated TO cells
were examined for the presence of STAT1 (Figure 8).
STAT1 was detected in both cytoplasmic and nuclear

extracts from cells stimulated with IFN-a1 for 45 or 90
min or IFNg for 45 min, but also, to a lesser extent, in
unstimulated cells. As a control for the separation of the
cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, an antibody directed
against a strictly lysosomal protein, Cathepsin D (CatD)
was used as a control for cytoplasmic localization [42].
Salmon STAT1 is phosphorylated upon IFN treatment

Tyrosine phosphorylation is a key step in STAT1
mediated IFN-signal transduction. To address whether
the conserved tyrosine residue found in the salmon
STAT1 sequence is phosphorylated upon stimulation,
an antibody specific to phosphorylated tyrosine was

used. IFNg-stimulated primary leukocytes were harvested and the STAT1 antibody applied in order to
immunoprecipitate STAT1 molecules. The pulled-down
material was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western
blotting, and the membrane incubated with a tyrosine
phospho-specific antibody. By IFNg-stimulation phosphorylated STAT1 was detected in adherent HK cells
and splenocytes after both 1 h and 3 h (Figure 9A),
although cells from different individuals responded differently to this treatment (results not shown). Similarly,
STAT1 was phosphorylated upon stimulation with IFN-

a1 at the same time-points (Figure 9A). Phosphorylation
of STAT1 was also confirmed in TO cells (Figure 9B).
A time-course study in these cells showed that with
IFNg treatment STAT1 was phosphorylated already after
5 min and peaked at 15 min, while in IFN-a1 treated
cells a weak band was detected at 5 min, increased at
15 min and then remained relatively constant up to
60 min. After 120 min phosphorylation was regressing
for both types of IFN. Phosphorylated ectopically
expressed ssSTAT1a was detected after 30 min by the
tyrosine phospho-specific antibody (Figure 9C). This

(C) were separated using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic

to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. STAT1 was detected in both N

STAT1 is known to form homodimers upon phosporylation [10]. However, dimerization of unphosphorylated
STAT1 in the cytoplasm is also reported [43] By
employing the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system we were
able to demonstrate a strong salmon STAT1-STAT1
interaction (Table 2). Interacting proteins were assessed
by the ability of growth on complete medium deficient
in histidine (TDO) or histidine and adenine (QDO).
Growth was recorded at day 4, when the positive control expressing p53 fused to Gal4DBD and SV40 T-antigen fused to Gal4AD showed massive growth on QDO
(++++). The specificity of the interaction was tested
with negative controls, and confirmed negative (no
growth on TDO nor QDO) by co-expressing the
Gal4 AD -ssSTAT1a fusion protein both with Gal4 DBD
alone and with Gal4 DBD fused to the human LaminC
protein, which is known to be a non-interacting protein
[44,45].

were transfected with a GFP-ssSTAT1a construct. After 48 h, the cells were treated with IFNg (200 ng/ml) for 30 min, or left untreated. Cells were
lysed and GFP-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with a-GFP. Phosphorylated GFP-STAT1 was detected by immunoblotting using antiphosphotyrosine antibody (upper panel). The total amount of immunoprecipitated GFP-STAT1 was detected with a-GFP antibody (lower panel).

A co-IP analysis of over-expressed ssSTAT1a and
ssSTAT1a-GFP fusion constructs in HEK-293 cells verified the ssSTAT1a-ssSTAT1a interaction further. The
Western blot in Figure 10 was probed with a-STAT1
and showed expression of both ssSTAT1a and
ssSTAT1a-GFP in the lysate (lane 1, ~ 85 kDa and ~
110 kDa respectively). ssSTAT1a was co-precipitated
along with ssSTAT1a-GFP when the GFP antibody was
applied for the IP (lane 2) and a-STAT1 precipitated
both ssSTAT1a and ssSTAT1a-GFP (lane 3). As a negative control ssSTAT1a was co-transfected with the
pEXP-GFP vector. The GFP antibody did not precipitate
ssSTAT1a (lane 5) whereas a-STAT1 did (lane 6).

Discussion
IFN induced immune responses in which STATs are
required are among the best understood signaling systems in mammals. Although a number of proteins
involved in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway have been
cloned from fish, less is known about their function and
whether the signaling resembles mammalian systems.
We have here cloned a cDNA that corresponds to the
salmon STAT1 gene. A clustalW alignment confirmed
that the cloned sequence was a STAT1 homolog sharing
extensive amino acid identity with other salmon STAT1
isoforms and trout STAT1 (Table 1 and Figure 1). The
2 274 nucleotides open reading frame of the cloned
cDNA has a structural arrangement of functional motifs
that is similar to mammalian STAT1 suggesting that the
salmon cDNA encode a functional protein.
So far STAT1 has been found in multiple fish species, including pufferfish, zebrafish (Danio rerio), rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon and Japanese flounder
(Paralichthys olivaceus). Previous expression data,
along with data presented here has revealed that piscine STAT1 is widely expressed in many tissues
[30,31,46-49]. However, data concerning functional
activity in lower vertebrates, such as STAT1 phosporylation and cellular localization upon stimulation of
cells, is scarce. The presented data demonstrates for
the first time that a teleost STAT1 protein is being

Figure 10 Co-IP analyses of the ssSTAT1a - ssSTAT1a interaction. ssSTAT1a was co-expressed with GFP-ssSTAT1a or pEXP-GFP (negative
control) in HEK-293 cells and the lysed cells subjected to IP with a STAT1 antibody (a-STAT1) or a GFP antibody (a-GFP). Samples were analyzed
along with the total cell lysate (sup) by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot using a-STAT1.

activated by IFNs. Salmon STAT1 was shown to be
tyrosine phosphorylated upon IFN-a1 and IFNg stimulation of leukocytes, and additionally in TO cells. Also,
relocalization of STAT1 into the nucleus of leukocytes
and TO cells was observed following IFNg stimulation.
Our data show a more evident response for IFNg than
for IFN-a1 when studying nuclear translocation of
STAT1 by microscopy. This was also consistent with
the levels of phosphorylated STAT1 observed upon the
different IFN-stimulations where IFNg consistently
gave higher levels compared to IFN-a1. STAT1 is
believed to be involved in both type I and type II IFN
signaling and their distinct responses could be due to
unequal concentrations or activity of the cytokines
used, or be dependent on differences in the kinetics of
forming the complexes that enter the nuclei. We also
showed that ssSTAT1a is able to form homodimers
which is thought to be a prerequisite for entering the
nucleus due to lack of a functional nuclear localization
signal in its monomeric form [16]. In unstimulated
cells STAT proteins can exist as stable unphosphorylated dimers or monomers which are also shuttled
over the nuclear membrane [50-52] and are able to
regulate gene expression in unconventional manners
[5], consistent with the observed presence of STAT1 in
nuclear extracts of unstimulated cells.
The TO cell line is derived from salmon HK and it
consists of heterogeneous cell types [53]. The CHSE-214
cells are embryo cells derived from Chinook salmon
(Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) [54]. Both these cell lines
are widely used as experimental systems to study
immune responses in salmon [47,55-60]. According to
our results, the expression of STAT1 protein seems to

be up-regulated upon type I and type II IFN treatment
in both the cell lines and also in primary HK leukocytes.
While the presented Western data are not quantitative,
we provide qPCR data showing that type I IFN induce
STAT1 expression in HK leukocytes to a greater extent
(10-fold) than type II IFN (3-fold), and also by different
kinetics, where the response to type II IFN peaked at an
earlier time-point. Unlike the HK leukocytes, the splenocytes, which are mostly lymphoid-like cells, did not
show increased abundance of STAT1 upon IFN-stimulation. The up-regulation of salmon STAT1 transcripts
after IFN-a1 stimulation of TO cells is reported by
others [31,47], additionally the type I IFN inducer poly
(I:C) has been shown to induce STAT1 mRNA expression in RTG-cells [48].
Following encounter with viral pathogens, CHSE-214
and TO cells did not seem to boost the levels of
STAT1 protein, but stayed relatively constant. Mx-protein was induced 24-48 h after infection with ISAV,
but did not respond to IPNV infection, which is in
compliance with results reported earlier [57,61,62].
The uniform expression patterns in salmon tissues and
in different cell-types treated in various ways indicate
that it is likely that STATs are present in the cytoplasm in most resting tissues, alert and ready to be
activated upon cellular receptor signaling. The signal
transduction and activation of ISGs may lead to a feedback loop that amplifies IFN-responses and induces
STAT1 in a secondary manner, STAT1 itself being an
ISG. This is shown in human cells-lines where IFNginduced IRF-1 in concert with CREB binding protein
acts as key up-regulator of STAT1 mRNA transcription by binding to a combined IRF-E/GAS element in

Skjesol et al. BMC Immunology 2010, 11:17
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/11/17

the STAT1 promoter [63]. Mutual regulation of
STAT1 and IRF-1 indicates an intracellular amplifying
circuit in response to IFN.
The STAT1 complexes formed in response to type I
IFN in salmonid cells are presumably, like in mammals,
distinct from those formed in response to type II IFN.
Masking of the epitope for the STAT1 antibody after
responding to IFN1a is a plausible explanation to the
inability to detect nuclear STAT1 by confocal microscopy examination upon IFN-a1 stimulation. Under the
denaturing conditions of SDS-PAGE and Western blotting STAT1 was detected in the nucleus of TO cells
after treatment with IFN-a1. Also a small portion of
STAT1 was detected in nuclear extracts of unstimulated
cells, which is consistent with observations of STAT1 as
a constitutive transcriptional regulator in mammalian
systems [13,64,65]. Unlike TO cells and primary leukocytes, no relocalization of STAT1 from the cytoplasm to
the nucleus was found upon IFNg treatment of CHSE214 cells. This could be due to the apparent low levels
of endogenously expressed STAT1 protein in these cells.
However, the expression levels were evaluated by Western blotting and the low detectable levels may be due
to a lower affinity of the STAT1 antibody to Chinook
salmon STAT1. Nevertheless, the levels of STAT1 in
CHSE-214 were induced by both types of IFN, but considerably later (24 h, Figure 6) than the time points used
for the confocal microscopy examination. No nuclear
extracts were made in order to examine STAT1 expression in these cells. The presence of the IFN receptors
(IFNAR and IFNGR) in the different cell-lines is also
uncertain although a putative IFNg-receptor was
recently identified in rainbow trout [66]. The differences
in response endorse the assumption that there are distinct proteins involved in signaling from type I and type
II IFNs. The presence of a STAT2 gene in salmon was
recently reported [32], and the first teleost importin
alpha gene was recently cloned from red seabream
(Pagrus major) [67], both findings adding to the
assumption that IFN signaling in fish resembles that of
mammals.
Unlike the (most common) action of human IFNg
[24,68], IFNg in salmonids up-regulates Mx expression
[55,69]. This might be a consequence of indirect stimulation, as fish IFNg can activate type I IFN [69] (and
own unpublished data). Interestingly, recombinant IFNg
activates an ISRE-containing reporter-construct in a
dose dependent manner whereas constructs containing
only GAS elements give no response to either type of
IFNs as shown by Castro et al. [70]. This finding suggests that cross-talk between IFN signaling pathways
occurs in fish. Overlapping effects of type I and II IFNs
are also described in mammals [71,72] In the absence of
exogenously administered IFNs, over-expression of

Page 11 of 17

ssSTAT1a by transfection in TO cells activated the Mxpromoter at a very moderate level (Additional file 2,
Supplemental Figure S1). Furthermore over-expression
of ssSTAT1a gave no additionally increased Mx-promoter activity upon type I or II IFN supplement. This is
probably due to lack of stoichiometric balance of factors
that activate, or interact with, the over-expressed
STAT1 molecules. Similar results are observed in mammalian cells with a slightly different IFNg-responsive
reporter [13].
Naturally occurring truncated forms of STATs can act
as competitors of functional STATs and inhibit transcriptional activation [73]. The ssSTAT1a gene differs
from two other salmon STAT1s published in GenBank.
The presence of more than one STAT1 isotype in salmon implies distinct functions for the different STAT1s,
possibly at the level of transcription activation as the
main differences are located in the TAD. The presented
ssSTAT1a is longer than EU016199 (ssSTAT1) [31]
while shorter than BT045567. Our attempt to detect
both ssSTAT1a and BT045567 transcripts in salmon
primary cells failed, and only ssSTAT1a was detected
independent of the type of treatment the cells were subjected to. Other cell-types, signals or cellular conditions
might favor BT045567 expression.

Conclusions
We have cloned a salmon STAT1 isoform possessing
conserved structural domains. Expressional and functional studies of this gene suggest that salmon use the
specialized JAK/STAT pathway for cytokine signaling as
STAT1 is tyrosine phosphorylated and translocates to
the nucleus upon IFN stimulation. Further details
related to JAK/STAT signaling and viral infections of
this economically important fish needs to be elucidated.
The ability of IPNV to impair STAT1 activation/phosphorylation is currently being examined, and the interacting ability of activated STAT1 needs to be addressed.
Methods
Fish

For in vitro cell-culture studies non-vaccinated Atlantic
salmon, Salmo salar L., strain Aquagen standard (Aquagen, Kyrksæterøra, Norway), 500-1000 g, was obtained
from Tromsø Aquaculture Research Station (Tromsø,
Norway). The fish were kept at 6 to 12°C in tanks supplied with running filtered sea water, and were fed
according to appetite on commercial, dry food.
For tissues expression studies, non-vaccinated Atlantic
salmon (~30 g), were obtained from SalmoBreed (Norway). The fish were kept in 150 l fresh water at 10 to
13°C, with an oxygen saturation >65% and were fed
according to appetite on commercial, dry food. The fish
were negative for the presence of infectious pancreatic

necrosis virus and salmon alphavirus when screened by
qPCR prior to the experiment.
The experiment was approved by the National Committee of Ethics as required by Norwegian law. Proper
anaesthetics have been used and the number of fish was
kept as low as possible to still get statistically significant
results.
Cell cultures and virus

Atlantic salmon head kidney (HK) or spleen leukocytes
were isolated as described by Jørgensen et al. [74]. The
density of the leukocyte suspensions was adjusted to 7 ×
106 cells/ml. One ml of HK leukocytes was plated per
well in 24-well plates in L-15 medium with 5% FBS,
whereas one ml splenocytes were plated in RPMI-1640
with 5% FBS. After approximately 24 h of incubation at
14°C, the cells were washed with culture medium prior
to stimulation.
Chinook salmon embryo cells (CHSE-214) [54] were
grown as monolayers at 20°C, 5.0% CO2 in Eagle minimal essential medium with GlutaMAX (EMEM+GlutaMAX, Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 μg/ml
streptomycin, 60 μg/ml penicillin, 1% non essential
amino acids and 8% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Euroclone). For infection experiments and Western analyses
CHSE-214 cells were seeded into 24-well plates (2 ×
10 5 cells/well) and grown to 80% confluence prior to
infection.
TO cells originating from Atlantic salmon head kidney
[53] were grown as monolayers at 20°C, 5.0% CO 2 in
Eagle minimal essential medium with GlutaMAX
(EMEM+GlutaMAX, Invitrogen) supplemented with 100
μg/ml streptomycin, 60 μg/ml penicillin, 1% non essential amino acids and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Euroclone).
HEK-293 cells (GP-293; Clontech) were maintained at
37°C, 5.0% CO2 in EMEM supplemented with 100 μg/
ml streptomycin, 60 μg/ml penicillin, 4 mM L-glutamine
and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) of the N1
strain, serotype Sp, was used in this study. The experiments were performed with a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 4 infectious particles in CHSE-214 or TO
cells. After absorption of the virus for 3-4 h in serum
free culture medium, the medium containing virus was
carefully removed from the cells. The infection was then
carried out at 17.5°C in the presence of 2% FBS and
cells harvested at different time points. Propagation and
titration of virus was performed as described in Pedersen et al [75].
Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) of the Norwegian reference strain Glesvaer 2/90 [76] (isolate ISAV4,
hemagglutinin GenBank accession number AF220607)
was kindly provided by Dr. B. Annexing, National

Page 12 of 17

veterinary institute, Oslo, Norway, and used to infect
TO cells at a MOI of 4. The infection was carried out at
17.5°C in the presence of EMEM with 2% FBS and the
cells harvested at different time points.
Stimulation of cells

Recombinant Atlantic salmon IFN-a1 (previously named
IFN-a1) was produced in HEK293 cells as described
elsewhere [77]. The salmon IFN-a1 used in this study
had a titer of 24 237 U/ml as estimated by the formula
given by Renault et al.[78]. IFN-a1 was administered to
the cells at a concentration of 10 U/mol in EMEM containing 2% FBS. Two hundred Ngami of recombinant
rainbow trout IFNg [24] were used for stimulation of
the cells.
Cloning of STAT1 and plasmid constructs

Specific primers for amplifying the salmon STAT1 gene
were made based on the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
mykiss) STAT1 sequence with the GenBank accession
number U60331. The primers are listed in Table 1. The
primers were Gateway compatible allowing the PCR
fragment to be inserted into pENTR/D-TOPO vector
(Invitrogen). A 2.3 kB fragment was amplified by Pfu
DNA polymerase (Stratagene) using mixed cDNA from
salmon ovary and HK obtained as described earlier [79].
Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing using the
BigDye chemistry and a 3100 Gene Analyzer (Applied
Biosciences). For transfection in cells, inserts were
further transferred to the Gateway compatible eukaryotic expression vectors pDEST12.2 (Invitrogen), pDESTGFP or pDEST-Myc (both provided by Dr. T. Lamark,
University of Tromsø) by Gateway recombination using
LR clonase II enzyme mix (Invitrogen) following manufacturer’s instructions. For yeast two-hybrid analysis
modified Clontech vectors (pGADT7 and pGBKT7)
were used. The vectors (kindly provided by Dr. O. M.
Seternes, University of Tromsø) were made Gateway
compatible by insertion of the Gateway polylinker
region as described [80] and are named pDESTGal4AD
and pDESTGal4 DBD respectively. Recombination into
pGal4DBD required an intermediate cloning step into the
pDONR207 vector (Invitrogen). Control plasmids
pTD1-1, pGBKT7-53 and pGBKT7-Lam were purchased
from Clontech.

(NP_998934), cow (NP_001071368), and chicken
(NP_001012932). In addition other STATs (STAT2,
STAT3, STAT4, STAT5 and STAT6 from some of
these species were included in the analysis done by
BioEdit and ClustalW version 1.81. A phylogenetic tree
of STAT1 proteins was constructed using the neighborjoining algorithm in clustalW. Bootstrap values were set
to 1000.
Real-time RT-PCR quantification

Total RNA was extracted from head kidney leukocytes
using RNeasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen) or from salmon
organs using TRIzol® (Invitrogen). RNA (300 ng in a
20 μl reaction) was reverse transcribed using TaqMan®
Reverse Transcription Reagents (Applied Biosystems).
A volume of 2 μl of cDNA (6.25 ng of reverse-transcribed RNA) per 25 μl PCR reaction was used with
primers for ssSTAT1 (ssSTAT1fw and ssSTAT1rev,
see table 1) together with an ssSTAT1 probe (5’6FAM-ACCACCAAGGAATGTTC-3’). While 6.25 pg
of reverse-transcribed RNA per 25 μl PCR reaction
was used to estimate 18S rRNA levels. The expression
of mRNA was measured in an ABI Prism 7500 FAST
Cycler (Applied Biosystems) using custom TaqMan®
assays designed by Applied Biosystems and FAST PCR
mastermix (Applied Biosystems). The amplification
profile was 95°C for 20 s followed by 40 cycles of 95°C
for 3 s and 60°C for 30 s. All cDNA samples were performed in triplicates. The expression was normalized
against EF1AB and presented as relative expression
compared to the non-treated control sample. Relative
expression was calculated using the Pfaffl’s mathematical model [81]. The expression profiles from non-treated control fish organ samples were presented as
expression of STAT1/EF1AB.
Two-hybrid analysis

Both rich and selective yeast growth media were made
from commercially available powders (Clontech). Yeast
cells were grown at 30°C for 2 - 4 days. Plasmid constructs based on the pGal4DBD vector or the pGal4AD
vector were transformed using Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II kit (Zymo Research) into competent yeast
cells of strains S. cerevisiae Y187 (MATa) or PJ69-2A
(MATa) by selecting for growth on medium lacking leucin or tryptophan, respectively. At least ten of each
transformants carrying STAT1 were mated to each
other. Ten diploid yeast cells from the mating were plated and scored for growth on a triple drop out medium
(TDO) lacking leucin, tryptophan and histidine or a
quadruple drop out medium (QDO) lacking leucin, tryptophan, histidine and adenine. Growth on TDO plates
indicates a weak interaction, whereas growth on QDO

Page 13 of 17

plates indicates a stronger interaction. SV40 T-antigen
(pTD1-1) and p53 (pGBKT7-53) served as positive controls, LaminC (pGBKT7-Lam) and empty vectors as
negative controls.
Transfection

For transfection, HEK-293, CHSE-214 or TO cells
were seeded into 24-well plates with a density of 2 ×
105 cells/well for HEK293 and CHSE-214, and 1 × 105
cells/well for TO, while in 6-well plates the densities
were 1 × 10 6 or 5 × 10 5 cells/well, respectively. The
cells were transfected the next day at 80 - 90% confluence. Transfection of the HEK-293 and CHSE-214
cells was performed by using the Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For each well, a total of 0.8 μg of
plasmid DNA was incubated with 2 μl Lipofectamine
2000 in 100 μl serum-free EMEM for 20 min at room
temperature before added to the cells. Three hours
post transfection, FBS was added to a total concentration of 2%. For transfection of the TO cells the transfection reagent FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science)
was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A
total of 0.6 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed with 1.25 μl
FuGENE HD in 50 μl EMEM and incubated 15 min
before added to the cells with medium containing 2%
FBS.
Luciferase assay

TO cells transiently transfected with a Mx-promoterluciferase construct [82] were lysed in 50 μl 1× passive
lysis buffer (PLB), from the Dual-Luciferase Reporter
Assay System (Promega). 100 μl of luciferase assay buffer II (LAR II) was predispensed in a luminometer
plate (96 wells) and 20 μl of the lysate added (according to the manufacturer’s protocol). The firefly luciferase activity [83] was measured in a Luminoscan RT
luminometer (Labsystems OY), before 100 μl of Stop&Glo reagent was added and Renilla luciferase activity
recorded for estimation of transfection efficiency (LAF/
LAR). All samples for the luciferase assay were set up
in triplicate and the results given as relative light units
(RLU).
Nuclear extraction

NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents
(Thermo scientific) was used to extract nuclear and
cytoplasmic proteins from 2 × 106 TO cells pr. reaction
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Gel electrophoresis, Western blotting and antibodies

Cells were lysed in 50 μl sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
sample buffer (160 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 10%

Skjesol et al. BMC Immunology 2010, 11:17
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/11/17

b-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.1% bromophenol blue), transferred from the culture well into a
microcentrifuge tube and boiled for 5 min. Then, typically 15-20 μl of the samples were loaded in each well
of a precast 4-12% gradient NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris gel
and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) with MES buffer and Western blotting
using the Invitrogen NuPAGE system. Gel electrophoresis, blotting, blocking and antibody incubation were
performed as described by the manufacturer. A polyclonal antibody against STAT1 (a-STAT1) was custom
made from a C-terminal peptide retrieved from the salmon STAT1 sequence: RSVAPVFQCWTGPKE. The
peptide was cross-linked by BSA to glutaraldehyde and
two rabbits were injected with antigen every 14 days.
The terminal bleed of the rabbits took place after day
68 (5 injections). The antiserum was antigen-purified
and reactivity against the peptide was confirmed by dot
blot analysis against the peptide. The specificity of the
antiserum was checked by transfection and expression
of a STAT1-GFP fusion construct in different cell-types
and the results are presented as supplementary data
(Additional file 3, supplemental Figure S2). A dilution of
1:2000 of the anti-STAT1 antibody (a-STAT1) was
found to be appropriate for Western blotting. A polyclonal Mx antibody (a-Mx, 1:1000 dilution) [84] was
applied as primary antibody for detection of Mx protein,
and a GFP antibody (1:10000 dilution) (Abcam) for
detection of GFP-tagged proteins. An actin antibody
(1:1000 dilution) produced in rabbit (Sigma) was used as
loading control in most Western blots and an antibody
directed towards cod Cathepsin D (1:2000 dilution) [42]
was used as a cytoplasmic marker. Goat anti-rabbitHorseradish Peroxidase (HRP) antibody or goat antimouse-HRP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
diluted 1:25000 were used as secondary antibodies.
Detection was performed by using SuperSignal West
Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce Biotechnology
Inc.). Stripping of the membranes was performed in 0.2
M NaOH for 10 min followed by washing, blocking and
new antibody incubation.
Immunoprecipitation (IP) of STAT1

TO cells or Atlantic salmon spleen and HK leukocytes
were stimulated with IFN-a1 or IFNg for 1 and 3 h
before washed two times with ice-cold PBS and harvested in buffer A (20 mM Tris-acetate, pH 7.0; 0.27 M
sucrose; 1 mM EDTA; 1 mM EGTA; 1 mM orthovanadate; 10 mM b-glycerophosphate; 50 mM sodium fluoride; 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate; 1% [vol/vol] Triton
X-100; 0.1% [vol/vol] 2-mercaptoethanol) and ‘Complete’ protease inhibitor cocktail (one tablet/50 ml,
Roche). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4°C for

Page 14 of 17

15 min at 18000 × g. Lysates were then subjected to IP
by incubating for 1 h at 4°C with aSTAT1 (1:100),
before addition of 10 μl protein A-agarose (50% slurry
pre-equilibrated in buffer A) and incubation at 4°C for
1 h. The immunoprecipitated material was washed four
times in ice-cold buffer A with 0.5 M NaCl and resuspended in 40 μl 2× LDS-sample buffer. STAT1 was
detected by the tyrosine phospho-specific antibody 4G10
Anti-Phosphotyrosine (Millipore) after SDS-PAGE and
Western blotting.
Co-IP analyses

HEK-293 cells co-transfected with the eukaryotic
expression vectors pEXP12.2-STAT1 and pEXP-GFPSTAT1 or pEXP12.2-STAT1 and pEXP-GFP were
washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested in HA-lysis buffer (50 mM
Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM
EGTA, 1% Triton X-100 ) with a protease inhibitor
cocktail added (Complete EDTA-free, Roche). Cell
lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min and cleared by
centrifugation for 15 min at 18000 × g in a microcentrifuge. Lysates were then subjected to IP with either aSTAT1 or a-GFP together with pre-blocked Protein
A/G PLUS-Agarose beads (Santa Cruz biotechnology).
The agarose beads were then washed four times with
HA-lysis buffer, and all traces of buffer removed with a
pipette tip before elution in 50 μl 2× SDS sample buffer.
Eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blotting and antibody detection.
Immunofluorescence microscopy

To examine localization of STAT1 in cells, primary cells
from salmon HK were seeded on 14 mm coverslips.
Non-adherent cells were washed away 1 day after seeding, and adherent monocyte/macrophages were stimulated with recombinant IFNs as described above. The
cells were rinsed with 1× PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), before fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min
at room temperature. Cells were washed three times
with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for
15 min, before blocked for 30 min with 7.5% FBS in
PBS. The cells were then incubated with the primary
antibody (a-STAT1) at a 1:500 dilution in PBS 7.5%
FBS for 1 h washed three times with PBS and incubated
with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor
546 at a 1:2000 dilution (Invitrogen) for 45 min away
from light. Cells were washed and stained with DAPI
(4’,6’-diamidino-2-phenylindole, 1:300, Invitrogen) and
mounted on slides with an antifade mounting medium.
Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed
using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope with LAS
AF software.

ssSTAT1a in TO cells does not increase the induction of the Mxpromoter significantly over IFN-induced levels. TO cells were
transiently co-transfected with a Mx promoter-luciferase reporter
construct and ssSTAT1a or an empty expression vector. Forty-eight hours
after transfection, the cells were left untreated or stimulated with IFN-a1
(10 U/mL) and IFNg (200 ng/ml) for 4, 6 and 8 h prior to measurement
of luciferase activity. The relative luciferase activity was normalized
against Renilla luciferase activity. Each bar represents the average of
triplicate determinations from a representative experiment that was
repeated two times with similar results. Error bars indicate standard
deviation.
Additional file 3: Supplemental Figure S2. The specificity of the
STAT1 peptide antibody was checked by transfection and expression
of a GFP-ssSTAT1a fusion construct in different cell-types followed by
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. GFP-ssSTAT1a was expressed and
recognized by the STAT1 antibody and a GFP antibody in HEK-293 cells
and CHSE-214 cells, whereas in TO cells the level of transfected GFPssSTAT1a was undetectable while endogenous expression of STAT1 was
detected in these cells. Actin was used as a loading control. Arrowheads
indicate unspecific bands cross-reacting to the GFP antibody.
