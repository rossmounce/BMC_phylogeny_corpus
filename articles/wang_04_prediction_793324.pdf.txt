Conclusions: We identified new plant miRNAs conserved between Arabidopsis and O. sativa and
report a wide range of transcripts as potential miRNA targets. Because MPSS data are generated
from polyadenylated RNA molecules, our results suggest that at least some miRNA precursors are
polyadenylated at certain stages. The broad range of putative miRNA targets indicates that miRNAs
participate in the regulation of a variety of biological processes.

interactions

Results: Our prediction covered 63% of known Arabidopsis miRNAs and identified 83 new
miRNAs. Evidence for the expression of 25 predicted miRNAs came from northern blots, their
presence in the Arabidopsis Small RNA Project database, and massively parallel signature sequencing
(MPSS) data. Putative targets functionally conserved between Arabidopsis and O. sativa were
identified for most newly identified miRNAs. Independent microarray data showed that the
expression levels of some mRNA targets anti-correlated with the accumulation pattern of their
corresponding regulatory miRNAs. The cleavage of three target mRNAs by miRNA binding was
validated in 5' RACE experiments.

Background: A class of eukaryotic non-coding RNAs termed microRNAs (miRNAs) interact with
target mRNAs by sequence complementarity to regulate their expression. The low abundance of
some miRNAs and their time- and tissue-specific expression patterns make experimental miRNA
identification difficult. We present here a computational method for genome-wide prediction of
Arabidopsis thaliana microRNAs and their target mRNAs. This method uses characteristic features
of known plant miRNAs as criteria to search for miRNAs conserved between Arabidopsis and Oryza
sativa. Extensive sequence complementarity between miRNAs and their target mRNAs is used to
predict miRNA-regulated Arabidopsis transcripts.

Background

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNA molecules with
important regulatory functions in eukaryotic gene expression. The majority of known mature miRNAs are about 21-23
nucleotides long and have been found in a wide range of
eukaryotes, from Arabidopsis thaliana and Caenorhabditis
elegans to mouse and human (reviewed in [1]). Over 300
miRNAs have been identified in different organisms to date,
primarily through cloning and sequencing of short RNA molecules [2-16]. Experimental miRNA identification is technically challenging and incomplete for the following reasons:
miRNAs tend to have highly constrained tissue- and timespecific expression patterns; degradation products from
mRNAs and other endogenous non-coding RNAs coexist with
miRNAs and are sometimes dominant in small RNA molecule
samples extracted from cells. Several groups have attempted
to screen for new Arabidopsis miRNAs by sequencing small
RNA molecules, but only 19 unique Arabidopsis miRNAs
have been found so far [12,13,15-17].
While intensive research has unmasked several aspects of
miRNA function, less is known about the regulation of
miRNA transcription and precursor processing. A recent
study shows a 116 base-pair (bp) temporal regulatory element
located approximately 1,200 bases upstream of C. elegans let7 is sufficient for its specific expression at different developmental stages [18]. For some animal miRNAs, longer transcripts have been shown to exist in the nucleus before they are
processed into shorter miRNA precursors [19]. Expressed
sequence tag (EST) searches indicate that some human and
mouse miRNAs are co-transcribed along with their upstream
and downstream neighboring genes [20]. Most known animal
miRNA precursors are approximately 70 nucleotides long,
whereas the lengths of plant miRNA precursor vary widely,
some extending up to 300 nucleotides [5,8,9,14,16]. As short
mature miRNAs are generated from hairpin-structured precursors by an RNase III-like enzyme termed Dicer (reviewed
in [21,22]), evidence for miRNA expression based on the
presence of longer precursor RNAs is likely to be found in
genome-wide expression databases.
Most known miRNAs are conserved in related species
[5,8,9,14-16]. Strong sequence conservation in the mature
miRNA and long hairpin structures in miRNA precursors
make genome-wide computational searches for miRNAs feasible. A variety of computational methods have been applied
to several animal genomes, including Drosophila melanogaster, C. elegans and humans [4,10,11,23]. In each case, a
subset of computationally predicted miRNA genes was validated by northern blot hybridizations or PCR.
A known function of miRNAs is to downregulate the translation of target mRNAs through base-pairing to the target
mRNA [21,24,25]. In animals, miRNAs tend to bind to the 3'
untranslated region (3' UTR) of their target transcripts to
repress translation. The pairing between miRNAs and their

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/9/R65

target mRNAs usually includes short bulges and/or mismatches [26-28]. In contrast, in all known cases, plant miRNAs bind to the protein-coding region of their target mRNAs
with three or fewer mismatches and induce target mRNA degradation [12,15,17,29] or repress mRNA translation [30,31].
Several groups have developed computational methods to
predict miRNA targets in Arabidopsis, Drosophila and
humans [29,32-35].
In the work reported here, we defined and applied a computational method to predict A. thaliana miRNAs and their target mRNAs. Focusing on sequences that are conserved in
both A. thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice), we predicted 95
Arabidopsis miRNAs, including 12 of 19 known miRNAs and
83 new candidates. Northern blot hybridizations specific for
18 randomly selected miRNA candidates detected the expression of 12 miRNAs. The sequences of another eight predicted
miRNAs were found in the public Arabidopsis Small RNA
Project (ASRP) database [36]. We also found massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) evidence for 14 known Arabidopsis miRNAs and 16 predicted ones. For 77 of the 83
predicted miRNAs we found putative target transcripts that
were functionally conserved between Arabidopsis and O.
sativa, with a signal-to-noise ratio of 4.1 to 1. Finally, we find
supporting evidence for miRNA regulation of some mRNA
targets using available genome-wide microarray data. The
authentication of three predicted miRNA targets was validated by identification of the corresponding cleaved mRNA
products.

Results
Prediction of Arabidopsis miRNAs
To predict new miRNAs by computational methods, we
defined sequence and structure properties that differentiate
known Arabidopsis miRNA sequences from random genomic
sequence, and used these properties as constraints to screen
intergenic regions in the A. thaliana genome sequences for
candidate miRNAs.
Besides the well known hairpin secondary structure of
miRNA precursors, the 19 unique known Arabidopsis miRNAs collected in Rfam [37] were evaluated for the following
computable sequence properties: G+C content in mature
miRNA sequences, hairpin-loop length in their precursor
RNA structures, number and distribution of mismatches in
the hairpin stem region containing the mature miRNA
sequence, and phylogenetic conservation of mature miRNA
sequences in the O. sativa genome. Sequences of all 19 known
Arabidopsis miRNAs had a G+C content ranging from 38% to
70%. For 15 of the 19 miRNAs, the predicted secondary structure of their precursors, or at least one precursor if a miRNA
has multiple genomic loci, had a hairpin-loop length ranging
from 20 to 75 nucleotides. In the hairpin structures formed by
miRNA precursors, all miRNAs were found in the stem region
of the hairpin, and had at least 75% sequence

The term 'terminal mismatches' in the formula above refers to
consecutive mismatches among the beginning and/or ending
nucleotides of a mature miRNA sequence. The term 'bulge'
refers to a series of mismatched nucleotides. Because the
sequences of most known miRNAs start with a U, a U-start
preference was used in the formula above by penalizing nonU-start sequences. The sequence with the lowest miRNAscore
from a series of overlapping 21-mers was selected as the final
miRNA candidate.

information

The first step was to search for potential hairpin structures in
the Arabidopsis intergenic sequences. As most known Arabidopsis miRNAs are around 21 nucleotides long, we used a 21nucleotide query window to search each intergenic region for

miRNAscore = number of mismatches + (2 × number of nucleotides in terminal mismatches) + (number of nucleotides in
internal bulges/number of internal bulges) + 1 if the miRNA
sequence does not start with U.

interactions

complementarity to their counterparts. Fifteen of 19 miRNAs
were conserved with at least 90% sequence identity in the O.
sativa genome. Thus, constraints of G+C content between 38
and 70%, a loop length between 20 and 75 nucleotides, and a
minimum of 90% sequence identity in O. sativa were used to
predict Arabidopsis miRNA.

In cases where two or more overlapping 21-mer miRNA candidates from the same precursor were collected in the final
miRNA candidate set, each miRNA candidate was scored
using the following formula:

refereed research

95 miRNA candidates, 95 hairpins
(12 known, 83 new)

deposited research

237 miRNA candidates, 155 hairpins
(12 known miRNAs)

The second step was to parse miRNA candidates according to
their nucleotide composition and sequence conservation. A
filter of G+C content between 38 and 70% was applied to all
21-mers obtained from the above step, followed by a requirement for more than 90% sequence identity in the O. sativa
genome. The secondary structures of the resulting candidates
were evaluated by mfold [38]. Only 21-mers whose Arabidopsis precursor and corresponding rice ortholog precursor both
had putative stem-loop structures as their lowest free energy
form reported by mfold were retained. Because some noncoding RNA genes were not included in the current Arabidopsis gene annotation, orthologs of known non-coding RNA
genes other than miRNAs were subsequently removed by
aligning the 21-mers to non-coding RNAs collected in Rfam
with BLASTN (version 2.2.6) [37]. The 21-mers that passed
all sequence and structure filters above were considered as
final miRNA candidates. A summary of the prediction algorithm is shown in Figure 1.

potential miRNA precursors as follows: for each successive
21-nucleotide query subsequence, if a 21-nucleotide pairing
subsequence with more than 75% sequence complementarity
was found downstream within a given distance (hairpin-loop
length), the entire sequence from the beginning of the query
subsequence to the end of the complement pairing subsequence with a 20-nucleotide extension at each side was
extracted and marked as a possible hairpin sequence (see
Materials and methods for details). The minimum and maximum hairpin-loop lengths used in this prediction were 20
and 75 nucleotides. Each 21-nucleotide query subsequence
and its downstream complementary subsequence were considered as 'potential 21-mer miRNA candidates' (referred to
as '21-mers'). If a series of overlapping forward query
sequences and their corresponding downstream pairing
sequences were all identified from the same hairpin structure,
each of them was initially considered as an individual 21-mer.

Wang et al.

In total, we predicted 95 miRNA candidates in the Arabidopsis genome, including 12 known Arabidopsis miRNAs and 83
new candidates. The former group corresponds to 63% of
known Arabidopsis miRNAs to date (12 of 19). The remaining
seven known miRNAs not included in the current prediction
were filtered out as a result of their lower sequence conservation in the rice genome or longer loop length in their secondary structure, as outlined in Figure 1. Because of the
complementarity between the two DNA strands of a given
genome region, theoretically there should be two sequence
possibilities for a predicted miRNA: the predicted sequence
itself or, alternatively, its reverse complementary sequence
located on the opposite strand of the genome. In many cases,
however, owing to G::U pairing in RNA structure prediction,
the complementary sequence of a miRNA precursor did not
always exhibit a hairpin structure as its lowest energy folding
form because the complement of a G::U pair, that is, C::A,
altered the secondary structure. Thus, we were able to identify the coding strand of most predicted miRNA candidates
through secondary structure evaluation. Furthermore, as
described in the following sections, the sequences/partial
sequences of some miRNA candidates or their precursors
could be found in the Arabidopsis MPSS data used. As most
MPSS data probably represent the expression of their associated miRNAs, we were able to use them to predict the miRNA
coding strand. The coding strand of miRNA candidates that
were contained in the ASRP database was determined according to cloned RNA sequences (see below for details). The complete list of predicted miRNAs is shown in Additional data file
1.

Experimental validation of predicted miRNAs
To gain support for the expression of the predicted miRNAs,
northern blot hybridizations were carried out using RNA
samples from different tissues selected to cover a spectrum of
potential miRNA expression patterns. Using strand-specific
oligonucleotide probes, positive signals of expression were
detected for 14 out of 18 miRNA candidates tested. The
results for all newly identified miRNAs are shown in Figure 2a
and 2b. Oligonucleotide probes against the antisense strand
of different miRNA candidates were used as negative controls, and none produced any signal, as shown for miR417 in
Figure 2b. Note that an extended exposure time was needed
to detect expression of most miRNAs (indicated by a number
in days in parentheses in Figure 2), suggesting that their
abundance is significantly lower than that of other known
miRNAs (that is, miR158 and miR159a in Figure 2c, and data
not shown). In this analysis we also included 10 21-mers that

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/9/R65

were rejected by our miRNA prediction criteria as negative
controls to evaluate the specificity of northern blot hybridization; as expected none of them produced a positive signal. The
secondary structures of a few selected northern blot hybridization-positive miRNA candidates are shown in Figure 3. A
full list of the secondary structures of predicted precursors of
Arabidopsis miRNA candidates and their rice orthologs is
available in Additional data file 2.
Among the 14 miRNAs that produced positive signals in the
northern blot hybridizations, two are close paralogs of known
miRNAs; miR169b is a paralog of miR169 and miR171b is a
paralog of miR170. Because it is impossible to distinguish
closely related sequences by northern blot hybridization, we
were unable to rule out the possibility that signals detected by
probes for miR169b and miR171b were contributed by their
known miRNA paralogs. However, as miR169b was also identified in the ASRP database (see next section), we were able to
conclude that miR169b was a real miRNA. Thus, 12 candidates validated by northern blot hybridization should be
annotated as bona fide miRNAs (see Table 1 for a summary).

Cloning evidence for predicted miRNAs
An ASRP database has recently been made publicly available
[36]. Sequences in the ASRP database were collected by cloning small RNA molecules with similar size to miRNAs and
siRNAs [39]. To check whether any of our predicted miRNAs
can be identified by a standard RNA cloning method, we compared the 83 predicted miRNA candidates with all sequences
in the ASRP database. Eight newly predicted miRNA candidates were found in the ASRP database (Figure 4). Among
them, five were identical to one or more cloned RNA molecules, indicating that we had correctly predicted the 5' and 3'
ends and the actual length of these miRNA candidates. For
the other three candidates, our predicted sequences were
either shorter than, or a few nucleotides shifted from, their
corresponding clones in the ASRP database. The exact
sequences of these three miRNA candidates were then corrected according to the corresponding sequences in the ASRP
database. The expression of miR169b and miR172b* was also
detected by northern blot hybridization (Figure 2a). Although
miR169h was present in the ASRP database, it could not be
detected by northern blot hybridization (see Additional data
file 1). According to the current miRNA annotation criteria
[22], these eight predicted miRNA candidates with corresponding cloned sequences in the ASRP database should be
annotated as bona fide miRNAs.

To further validate the predicted miRNA molecules, we took
advantage of available Arabidopsis massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) data. The MPSS sequencing technology identifies unique 17-nucleotide sequences present in

cDNA molecules originated from polyadenylated RNA
extracted from a cell sample. By inserting cDNA molecules
into a cloning vector containing distinct 32-mer oligonucleotide tags, the MPSS technology ensures that each cDNA molecule is ligated to a unique tag and that more than 99% of the
total cDNAs are represented after the cloning step. Tagged

To explore the relationship of predicted miRNAs to known

interactions

We then assessed the presence of MPSS signature sequences
for the 83 predicted miRNAs. Using the approach described
above, 23 MPSS signature sequences corresponding to the
flanking sequences of 16 predicted miRNAs were found (see
Additional data file 1). All 23 MPSS signature sequences were
present in both the public and our own MPSS datasets, and
mapped uniquely to the miRNA flanking sequence. The
expression of nine miRNA candidates supported by MPSS
data was also tested by northern blot hybridization, with eight
of them producing a positive signal. Another three miRNAs
with MPSS data were found in the ASRP database (see previous section and Additional data file 1). These results indicate
that MPSS data indeed represent the expression of predicted
miRNAs.

refereed research

To assess the degree to which MPSS data could be used to
support predicted miRNAs, we inspected the 19 known Arabidopsis miRNAs for unique representation in public Arabidopsis MPSS datasets and in our own MPSS datasets derived
from a variety of tissues and conditions (see Materials and
methods for details) [42-44]. We compared the intergenic
genomic sequence flanking the 19 known Arabidopsis miRNAs with the MPSS data. We found 30 MPSS signature
sequences that were identical to subsequences within the
flanking 500-bp sequences either upstream or downstream of
14 known miRNAs (see Additional data file 3). All 30 MPSS
sequences were reported in both the public and private MPSS
datasets. They occurred upstream, downstream or partially
overlapping with known mature miRNAs. Despite the highly
repetitive nature of the Arabidopsis genome, 28 of the 30
MPSS signatures mapped uniquely to only one miRNA locus,
with no matches elsewhere in the genome. Two genomic loci
were found for each of the two exceptional MPSS signatures
MPSS78528 and MPSS28409. For MPSS78528, the
associated miRNA mir162 appeared twice in the Arabidopsis
genome (upstream of At5g08180 and upstream of

At5g23060) and the MPSS sequence mapped exactly to those
regions. For MPSS28409, its second genomic match was on
the opposite strand of an intron in gene At3g04740, which
was very unlikely to be a source for MPSS sequences because
samples for MPSS were prepared from mRNA or other type of
polyadenylated RNA molecules, in which introns should have
been processed. Thus, the MPSS data accurately reflected the
expression of 14 known Arabidopsis miRNAs from a total of
19, indicating that it can be used as a source of indirect experimental support for the expression of predicted miRNAs.

deposited research

cDNAs are then amplified by PCR and hybridized to
microbeads that have been precoated with multiple copies of
unique anti-tags complementary to one type of 32-nucleotide
tag. The expression level of a particular transcript is
measured by counting the number of distinct microbeads that
contain the same 17-nucleotide cDNA sequence. The MPSS
technology does not require prior knowledge of a gene's
sequence and thus can identify novel or rarely expressed
genes. For a complete description, see [40,41].

miRNAs exhibited high sequence similarity to one or more

clusters (Figure 5). We could not find convincing evidence
that Arabidopsis and animal miRNAs are related, as clustering of these required the insertion of multiple gaps in the

prediction, making it feasible to identify plant miRNA targets
[12,15,16]. We developed a computational method based on
the Smith-Waterman nucleotide-alignment algorithm to predict mRNA targets for the 83 newly identified miRNA candidates reported in this paper (see Materials and methods for
details). Focusing on miRNA complementary sites that were
conserved in both Arabidopsis and O. sativa, our method was
able to identify 94% of previously confirmed or predicted
mRNA targets for known conserved Arabidopsis miRNAs.
Applying the method to the 83 predicted Arabidopsis miRNA
candidates and their O. sativa orthologs, we predicted 371
conserved mRNA targets for 77 predicted Arabidopsis miRNAs, with an average of 4.8 targets per miRNA. The signal-tonoise ratio of the miRNA targets prediction was 4.1:1 when
using randomly permuted sequences with the same nucleotide composition to miRNA sequences as negative controls
that went through the same target prediction process. A complete list of these predicted target mRNAs and their pairings
with miRNA sequences is available in Additional data file 4.

information

We have developed and applied a computational method to
predict 95 Arabidopsis miRNAs, which include 12 known
ones and 83 new sequences. All 83 new miRNAs are conserved with more than 90% identity across the Arabidopsis
and rice genomes. The expression of 19 new miRNAs was confirmed by northern blot hybridization or found in a publicly
available database of small RNA sequences. MPSS data support was also found for 14 known and 16 predicted Arabidopsis miRNAs. Of the 16 miRNAs, 10 were confirmed by
northern blot hybridization or by their presence in the ASRP
database, and six have MPSS data only. In total, we have
found direct or indirect experimental evidence for 25 predicted miRNAs. We expect more evidence to be found for
other predicted miRNAs as independent experimental data,

interactions

We analyzed the expression patterns of potential targets to
look for indications that they were under miRNA regulation.
Twelve of the 14 miRNAs confirmed by northern blot hybridization showed an increased accumulation in flower tissue
compared to the other tissues tested (Figure 2), suggesting a
role for miRNAs in regulating flower-specific events. In a

deposited research

Consistent with previous reports [29], a large proportion of
predicted targets encoded proteins with transcription regulatory activity, corresponding to 50% of total targets with GO
annotation (129/254). One interesting phenomenon was that
most transcription regulators in the miRNA target set were
plant specific, such as MYB, AP2, NAC, GRAS, SBP and
WRKY family transcription factors (Table 3). For example,
the miRNA target set included 10 plant specific NAC-domaincontaining transcription factors, corresponding to 9% of total
NAC-domain-containing transcription factors encoded by the
A. thaliana genome. In contrast, 139 genes encoding a general transcription factor bHLH were found in the A. thaliana
genome, but only three were putative miRNA targets.

Target mRNA fragments resulting from miRNA-guided
cleavage are characterized by having a 5' phosphate group,
and cleavage occurs near the middle of the base-pairing interaction region with the miRNA molecule. Using a modified
RNA ligase-mediated 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'
RACE) protocol, we were able to detect and clone the
At3g26810 mRNA fragment corresponding precisely to the
predicted product of miRNA processing (Figure 6). Two other
genes, At3g62980 (TIR1) and At1g12820, share extensive
sequence homology with At3g26810 and were also predicted
to be targets of miR393a. Consistent with this, we also identified the corresponding RNA fragments derived from miRNA
cleavage by 5' RACE (data not shown). We were not able to
identify other targets from flower RNA samples using a similar approach. The microarray data used in this tissue comparison experiment includes around 7,400 genes only (about a
quarter of the entire Arabidopsis genome). Thus, we expect
the expression profile of more mRNA targets to be determined as more whole-genome tissue comparison data is
available.

reports

Of the 371 predicted miRNA targets, 10 were potential targets
of two independent miRNAs, one (At3g54460 mRNA) was a
potential target of three different miRNAs (At1g60020_5_14,
At3g27883_1009, At5g62160_613_rc), and the rest were targets of a single miRNA. We assessed the biological functions
of all predicted miRNA targets using gene ontology (GO) [45].
GO terms for 254 targets were found in the molecular function class. Molecular functions of the putative miRNA targets
included transcription regulator activity, catalytic activity,
nucleic acid binding, and so on, as summarized in Table 2. As
some proteins were classified in more than one molecular
function category, the total number of targets listed in different function categories in Table 2 exceeds the number of targets with GO function assignment.

search of Arabidopsis microarray gene expression data available from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR)
[46], we found the expression profile for 11 predicted mRNA
targets that can base-pair nearly perfectly with five confirmed
flower-abundant miRNAs. We hypothesized that expression
levels of these targets in flower tissue could be decreased as
compared to whole plant RNA samples as a result of mRNA
cleavage induced by miRNA regulation. Accordingly, a
reduced expression level (more than 1.25-fold decrement)
was found for eight genes in total flower mRNA compared to
total whole plant mRNA, with another three whose expression was almost unchanged (Table 4). A t-test on the
possibility of decreased expression between transcripts listed
in Table 4 and in the entire microarray data resulted in a pvalue of 0.04, indicating that the decreased expression
observed for predicted miRNA targets is significantly different from the general expression pattern of the entire microarray data.

the 83 predicted miRNAs, eight have strong sequence similarity with known plant miRNAs. The prediction results and
supporting experimental evidence are summarized in Table 5.
Additional data file 1 summarizes the corresponding evidence
for known miRNAs and contains additional detailed information for each new candidate. Potential functionally conserved
mRNA targets were found for 77 predicted miRNAs.

Assessment of miRNA prediction
The prediction method developed in this study uses computable sequence and structure properties that characterize the

majority of the known Arabidopsis miRNA genes to constrain
the miRNA search space. Parameters used in the prediction
were selected to minimize false positives while maximizing
true positives. Thus, seven known miRNAs (37%) were
missed using our selected parameters. However, relaxing the
loop length range to include all known miRNAs increased the
number of candidate hairpins from around 180,000 to
around 337,000 (a 53% increase). As the method requires
stringent miRNA sequence conservation between Arabidopsis and O. sativa, miRNAs with little or no sequence conservation in other genomes will be overlooked by this method.
Given the current knowledge of miRNAs, it is difficult to

information

We attained a 67% success rate of northern blot hybridization
on all tested miRNA candidates, demonstrating the expression of 12 miRNAs from a total of 18 tested candidates. Failure to detect miRNA candidates by northern blot
hybridization could be due to the limited number of sample
tissues tested, as specific miRNAs may be expressed only
under particular conditions (stimuli and/or developmental
stages) or in specific cell types. For instance, further analysis

We made an intriguing discovery by identifying known Arabidopsis miRNAs and their approximate precursor sequences
in MPSS polyadenylated transcript datasets. All but two
MPSS sequences reported here uniquely map to the mature
miRNA sequence or to the flanking sequence 500 nucleotides
upstream or downstream (see Results). The MPSS sequence
locations and orientations indicate that they are not transcripts derived from surrounding annotated genes. All but
one tested miRNA candidates with MPSS evidence produced
positive signals in northern blot hybridizations. As MPSS
cDNA libraries are generated using polyadenylated RNA molecules [40,41,43,44], the presence of 14 known Arabidopsis
miRNAs from a total of 19 in these datasets strongly indicates
that at least some, if not all, plant miRNAs have a polyadenylated precursor form at some stage of their biogenesis.

here is not specific for Arabidopsis and can be applied to
other pairs of related genomes as well.

of miR169g* (shown in Figure 2a) indicated a higher accumulation in mature siliques than in the seedling stage (J.L.R. and
N-H.C., unpublished work). This can only be determined by
detailed study of individual miRNAs, which is not possible in
a general screening such as the one presented here. Alternatively, the expression level of certain miRNAs may fall below
the detection limit of our assay conditions. Consistent with
this idea, in all cases the confirmed miRNAs were detected
only after an extended period of autoradiography (2-3 days),
as compared with known miRNAs that were more easily
detected (see Figure 2 and data not shown). The low abundance of the newly identified miRNAs is in agreement with
the limited number of miRNAs identified to date using the
established cloning strategies.

Wang et al.

Predicted miRNAs detected by both northern blot hybridization and MPSS have consistent tissue-specific expression profiles under both methods. This supports the notion that the
MPSS data reflect miRNA expression patterns. The public
MPSS datasets are accessible only through an online interface
that allows direct query of 17-nucleotide MPSS sequences.
Direct comparison of the public sequences and predicted
miRNAs was not possible. Thus, we were limited in our analysis to inquire whether a private MPSS sequence was also in
the public MPSS dataset. Consequently, only MPSS
sequences that appeared in the private set alone or in both
sets were available to support miRNA prediction. The public
MPSS dataset has 120-fold more signature sequences (more
than 12 million additional tags) than our private MPSS dataset (approximately 94,000 tags total). Thus, we expect far
more MPSS evidence for expression of the predicted miRNAs
to be found in the public MPSS datasets when the public
MPSS data are available to be compared locally.

Target mRNAs for predicted miRNAs
We used phylogenetic conservation as a constraint on miRNA
target mRNA prediction: only transcripts that had at least one
O. sativa functional ortholog among the top 500 rice miRNA
targets were considered as potential miRNA target genes.
Because all miRNA candidates reported here are highly conserved in rice, it is expected that their mRNA targets should
also be conserved. Transcripts encoding proteins with ambiguous annotations, such as those for hypothetical proteins,
expressed proteins and putative proteins, are not included in
the target prediction because of the difficulty in identifying
their orthologs in the O. sativa genome. Thus, the absence of
predicted mRNA targets for the minority of the miRNAs may
be due to the unfinished annotation of the O. sativa genome
or to the divergence of target mRNA sequences that may preclude its identification.
Gaps and mismatches are commonly seen in known animal
miRNA::mRNA base-pairing interactions and, as a result,
miRNA binding represses the translation of their targets [1].
Although in most known cases plant miRNAs tend to pair
nearly perfectly with their target mRNAs and induce mRNA
cleavage [12,15,17,29], recent evidence has shown that plant
miRNAs can also repress target mRNA translation in a way
similar to that of animal miRNAs [1,30,31]. To further explore
the function of Arabidopsis miRNAs in target mRNA
translation repression, in this prediction we allowed gaps and
mismatches in the putative Arabidopsis miRNA::mRNA
pairs. The free energy of 90% of the predicted miRNA::mRNA
pairs is lower than the average free energy of known animal
miRNA::mRNA pairs (∆G = -14 kcal/mol) [32], indicating
that the predicted miRNA::mRNA pairs are potentially stable
at the energy level if similar interactions are present in plants
(see Additional data file 4).
Our prediction of target mRNAs for the new 83 miRNA candidates reveals that a broad functional range of genes may be

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/9/R65

regulated by miRNAs (Table 4 and Additional data file 4). As
in previous findings, the predicted miRNA targets were
enriched for transcription factors [29]. Our prediction also
included transcripts encoding proteins with transcription
regulator activity, catalytic activity, signal transducer activity
and translation regulator activity. This result is consistent
with recent findings in animal miRNA targets, and suggests a
broader role for miRNA regulation in plant gene expression
[29,32-35].
We took advantage of available microarray data to assess the
relative expression levels of potential mRNA targets in tissues
in which their miRNAs were expressed. For mRNA targets of
several newly identified miRNAs, we found reduced expression levels in RNA samples from flowers compared to the
whole plant. Accordingly, we identified the cleavage product
of At3g26810 mRNA, and those of another two homologous
genes, At1g12820 and TIR1 (At3g62980), to confirm them as
targets of the same miRNA (miR393a). These genes encode Fbox proteins, and TIR1 in particular is involved in auxinmediated protein degradation [47]. Interestingly, F-box proteins are another group over-represented among the target
mRNAs (48 out of 254, or 19%), while there are around 700
F-box proteins encoded in the Arabidopsis genome (2.1%)
[48]. Remarkably, these are the first confirmed plant miRNA
targets that are not transcription factors, with the exception
of DCL1 and AGO1. The identity and expression pattern of a
target mRNA can help identify the specific expression profile
of its corresponding miRNA. Tissues with low mRNA expression levels should be checked carefully for miRNA expression.
Currently, this kind of search is limited by the availability of
genome-wide and tissue-/time-specific microarray data. As
such data accumulate, their analysis will enrich our
understanding of the different biological processes regulated
by microRNAs.

Materials and methods
Computational prediction of Arabidopsis miRNAs
The Arabidopsis genome version 3 and the O. sativa genome
released by The Institute for Genome Research (TIGR) on 22
July 2002 [49] and 24 January 2003 [50], respectively, were
used for the present study. Intergenic regions of both the A.
thaliana and the O. sativa genomes were extracted according
to the annotations provided by TIGR. A scanning algorithm
implemented in the Perl programming language was used to
search for possible hairpin structures within each intergenic
sequence in A. thaliana. The method inspects each successive
21-nucleotide query window in each intergenic region, with
two nucleotide increments, and searches for downstream
complementary sequences with up to 25% mismatches. We
restricted the distance from the last base of the forward query
sequence and the first base of the downstream complementary pairing sequence to a minimum of 10 nucleotides and a
maximum of 150 nucleotides (loop length). For each 21nucleotide query, the loop length was increased one

information

Predicted miRNAs were compared to known Arabidopsis
miRNAs using the MEME motif-searching software and
Smith-Waterman gapped local alignment to identify
homologs of known miRNAs. Pairs of aligned sequences were
grouped by transitive closure, and multiple alignments were
generated with ClustalW [52-54]. The multiple alignment
output was manually curated.

interactions

To obtain genomic regions corresponding to miRNA precursors, we extracted 500 nucleotides upstream and downstream of every genomic locus of all known and predicted
Arabidopsis miRNAs. If an intergenic region encoding a
miRNA had fewer than 500 nucleotides on either side of the
miRNA locus, sequences were extracted up to the neighboring gene.

Tissue comparison (reference vs flower) microarray data used
for target gene validation were downloaded from TAIR [46].
mRNA samples from whole plants and flowers were used as
reference and sample probes in the microarray hybridization.

Finding MPSS evidence for miRNA candidates

miRNA target gene prediction was performed by aligning
miRNA sequences with target mRNA sequences using the
TimeLogic implementation of the Smith-Waterman nucleotide-alignment algorithm. Sequences of known and predicted Arabidopsis miRNAs and their O. sativa orthologs
were used as query datasets. mRNA sequences of the Arabidopsis and O. sativa annotated genes were used as target
datasets. Gaps were allowed in the pairing of miRNA and
their target mRNAs. Mismatches were preferred over gaps by
assigning higher penalties to gaps in the alignment algorithm.
Consecutive gaps were preferred over scattered individual
gaps by assigning higher penalties to gap opening than to gap
extension. The top 500 putative hits from Arabidopsis
miRNA target list and their O. sativa ortholog target list were
compared. For each mRNA hit of an Arabidopsis miRNA, if a
rice ortholog from the same gene family was also found
among the top 500 rice miRNA hits, the Arabidopsis mRNA
hit was selected as a putative miRNA target.

deposited research

Two-day-old seedlings, 4-week-old adult plants, root-regenerated calluses and mixed-stage flowers of A. thaliana (Col-0)
were used to extract total RNA using the trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Samples of 20 µg total RNA were resolved in a 15%
polyacrylamide/1x TBE/8 M urea gel and blotted to a zetaprobe membrane (BioRad). DNA oligonucleotides with the
exact complementary sequence to candidate miRNAs were
end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase
(New England Biolabs) to generate high specific activity
probes. Hybridization was carried out using the ULTRAHybOligo solution according to the manufacturer's directions
(Ambion), and signals were detected by autoradiography.

immature flowers, 14-day-old leaves, 14-day-old roots and
24- to 48-h post-fertilization siliques [42].

A G+C-content filter and a loop-length filter were applied to
the 312,236 hairpin structures obtained. Only hairpins with a
loop length between 20 and 75 nucleotides and 21-mer
sequences with a G+C-content between 38 and 70% were
analyzed further. The remaining 21-mer sequence pairs were
aligned with rice intergenic regions using BLASTN (version
2.2.6) to identify homologous sequences in O. sativa intergenic regions with 90% or higher sequence identity. The secondary structure of Arabidopsis miRNA candidate
precursors and their rice precursor orthologs was evaluated
using mfold [38]. Only 21-mers whose Arabidopsis precursor
and rice ortholog precursor both had a hairpin-like folding as
their lowest energy states were considered as miRNA candidates. A sequence alignment search against non-coding RNAs
collected in Rfam [51] using BLASTN (version 2.2.6) was
applied to identify and remove homologs of non-coding RNAs
other than miRNAs. The remaining 95 sequences were
retained as our final miRNA dataset.

'pairing sequences'. For each query sequence, the downstream complementary sequence with the fewest mismatches
was saved as the pair sequence for the query. Insertions and
deletions were allowed in the alignment and were counted as
mismatches. Sequences from the start of a qualified querying
sequence to the end of its downstream complementary pairing sequence were considered as a potential miRNA
precursor with putative hairpin structure. Twenty extra
nucleotides were extracted from the genome at each end of a
potential miRNA precursor for the purpose of structure check
using mfold [38].
