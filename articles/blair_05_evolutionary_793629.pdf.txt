Abstract
Background: Gene duplication and gene loss during the evolution of eukaryotes have hindered
attempts to estimate phylogenies and divergence times of species. Although current methods that
identify clusters of orthologous genes in complete genomes have helped to investigate gene
function and gene content, they have not been optimized for evolutionary sequence analyses
requiring strict orthology and complete gene matrices. Here we adopt a relatively simple and fast
genome comparison approach designed to assemble orthologs for evolutionary analysis. Our
approach identifies single-copy genes representing only species divergences (panorthologs) in
order to minimize potential errors caused by gene duplication. We apply this approach to complete
sets of proteins from published eukaryote genomes specifically for phylogeny and time estimation.
Results: Despite the conservative criterion used, 753 panorthologs (proteins) were identified for
evolutionary analysis with four genomes, resulting in a single alignment of 287,000 amino acids.
With this data set, we estimate that the divergence between deuterostomes and arthropods took
place in the Precambrian, approximately 400 million years before the first appearance of animals in
the fossil record. Additional analyses were performed with seven, 12, and 15 eukaryote genomes
resulting in similar divergence time estimates and phylogenies.
Conclusion: Our results with available eukaryote genomes agree with previous results using
conventional methods of sequence data assembly from genomes. They show that large sequence
data sets can be generated relatively quickly and efficiently for evolutionary analyses of complete
genomes.

Background
The use of complete genomes for phylogenetic analysis
has greatly improved our understanding of prokaryote
evolution [1-3]. However, until recently, relatively few
complete genome sequences were available for such analyses in eukaryotes. As this improves, there will be a greater
demand on methodology for evolutionary analysis of
complete genomes. Previous whole-genome studies of
eukaryotes have focused on gene and gene family pres-

ence-absence [4-7], lineage-specific gene loss [8,9], insertion-deletion markers and introns [6,10,11], and other
non-sequence based information. While these approaches
have their advantages, previous studies have not used
complete genome sequences (nucleotides and/or amino
acids) for reconstructing evolutionary relationships. At
the same time, the complexity of eukaryote genomes, with
numerous gene duplications and losses in different lineages, has created a challenge for sequence-based

as panorthologs, in reference to their presumed "complete"
orthology, in contrast to synorthologs, which contain a mixture of species divergences and gene duplication events. In
other words, panorthologs are those genes (or clusters of
sequences) that contain only species divergences and do
not contain in-paralogs, out-paralogs, or co-orthologs
[15]. On the other hand, synorthologs are those genes (or
clusters of sequences) that contain species divergences
and any combination of paralogy (in-paralogs and outparalogs). While the use of panorthologs is conservative
and reduces the number of usable genes or proteins, it
also lowers the probability that errors will be made in confusing a species divergence with a gene duplication event.
Because the ability to identify orthologs is diminished in
analyses of small to moderate numbers of species or
genomes, such a conservative method is appropriate in
those cases. This conservative approach has been used to
identify the number of shared, unduplicated proteins in
Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where it was determined that such proteins perform primarily anabolic
rather than catabolic functions [16].
We compare our phylogenetic results and divergence time
estimates for an analysis of seventeen published eukaryote
genomes to a previous study that assembled nuclear protein sequence data in a more conventional manner from
public databases [17]. While the phylogenetic relationships between the organisms included in this study are
not controversial, with the exception of the position of
nematodes [18], this general approach will prove useful as
more genomes, including those with questionable phylogenetic affinity, are sequenced. In addition, this approach
facilitates the estimation of divergence times between
organisms with numerous molecular clock methods.

Results
phylogeny estimation. Here, we outline a conservative
approach designed to utilize the wealth of evolutionary
information present in complete genome sequences by
identifying orthologs in multiple eukaryotes for the purpose of evolutionary analysis.
Methods for the identification of clusters of orthologs and
lineage-specific paralogs have proven useful for classifying
gene function and identifying cases where genes have
been differentially lost or duplicated in different lineages
[12-14]. However, such assemblages of data contain a
mixture of orthologs, paralogs, and missing data as a
result of gene loss, and are not generally suitable for largescale phylogenetic sequence analysis of organismal evolution. Our approach for comparing multiple genome
sequences involves the identification of single-copy
orthologs across a number of genomes for evolutionary
analysis (Figure 1). We refer to such strict (1:1) orthologs

The number of orthologous clusters per pairwise comparison and the percentage of those clusters showing panorthology are presented in Table 1. On average, pairwise
orthologous clusters contained approximately 60.3%
panorthologs; exceptions include comparisons between
fungi, including Encephalitozoon (average 89% panorthology), and all comparisons with Arabidopsis (average
34.6% panorthology). Comparisons within metazoans
averaged 54.7% panorthology, with Mus and Rattus showing the highest number of shared transcripts (16,413
orthologous clusters; 79.2% panorthology) as expected
due to their recent evolutionary divergence. Previous analyses showed approximately 12,400 panorthologs between
Mus and Rattus [19]. Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae,
who diverged roughly 100 Ma [20], also shared a large
number of transcripts (12,416 orthologous clusters;
84.4% panorthology), which is similar to a previous estimate of 12,155 panorthologs [21]. The number of

orthologous clusters between Drosophila and Anopheles
found here (7072, 61.3% panorthology) is also similar to
a previous estimate of approximately 6130 panorthologs
[22]. Pairwise comparisons with the smallest genome, the
Guillardia nucleomorph, averaged ~176 orthologous clusters, but the percentage of panorthologs varied greatly,

The intersection of nine metazoan genomes resulted in a
large number of shared genes. Among the nine genomes,
285 panorthologs were found, totaling 97,581 amino
acids. The neighbor-joining tree of that concatenation is
shown in Figure 2; all nodes in this tree received 100%
bootstrap support. The intersection of all seventeen
eukaryote genomes included in this study resulted in three
shared genes (t-complex protein delta subunit, proteasome beta type-1 subunit, and Nip7p biogenesis factor)
and orthology was confirmed manually. The reconstructed trees for the three genes showed long-branch
attraction errors associated with the intracellular parasite
Encephalitozoon and the Guillardia nucleomorph (data not
shown). This was expected because both have highly
reduced genomes and high rates of substitution across
many genes as a result of their current or ancestral parasitic and symbiotic lifestyles [23,24]. For this reason, the
intersection of the remaining fifteen genomes was determined, resulting in ten panorthologs. The intersection of
genomes from twelve multicellular eukaryotes resulted in
63 panorthologs. The functional classifications of the
panorthologs found here are similar to those identified in
previous studies [14], with the most frequently represented functions being transcription, translation, replication and repair, and RNA processing. The phylogenetic
trees reconstructed from the concatenated datasets both
showed the expected relationships (Figure 3a and 3b)
[17]. All nodes in these trees received very high bootstrap
support, with only one node showing less than 95% boot-

branch observed in Plasmodium (Figure 3a) may be the
result of both the long evolutionary separation from the
other eukaryotes included in this study, and the high (AT) composition of the genome [25] leading to biased
amino acid compositions among proteins [26].

Phylogenetic trees were also reconstructed for each panortholog to test for congruence with well-supported phylogenies from the concatenated data (see Additional file
1). We found that in most cases, the consensus values calculated from individual trees agree with the high bootstrap support of the concatenated analysis. Two

Takifugu, Drosophila, and Anopheles; Arabidopsis as outgroup) and the intersection of four genomes (Homo, Takifugu, and Drosophila; Arabidopsis as outgroup). The seven
genome intersection contained 380 panorthologs
(132,190 amino acids; Figure 4a), and yielded a vertebrate-arthropod divergence time of 955 Ma. The four
genome intersection contained 753 panorthologs
(287,000 amino acids; Figure 4b) and yielded a vertebrate-arthropod divergence time of ~1100 Ma. Although
this last estimate was derived from more than five times
the data previously used, the divergence time is remarkably consistent with previous large-scale studies [17], and
suggests that bilaterian animals originated hundreds of
millions of years before the first fossil evidence of their
existence in the Cambrian (~520 Ma). With the exception
of the maximum fossil-based time estimate used in the
tetrapod-actinopterygian fish calibration, the other fossil
constraints used here are minimums, and therefore the
resulting time estimates are minimums [34]. The agreement between our results and those of previous studies
using different methods of data assembly suggests that
our genome intersection approach is correctly assembling
orthologs. Younger time estimates of the vertebratearthropod divergence have been obtained in some studies
[35-37]. However, those results are problematic because
they also contain estimates which are inconsistent (too
young) with undisputed aspects of the fossil record, such
as the oldest red algae (1200 Ma), green algae (1000 Ma),
and stramenopiles (1000 Ma) [38-40]. Possible reasons
for their inconsistency are discussed elsewhere [41].

Discussion
exceptions were the low consensus values for the accepted
close relationship between animals and fungi and the
contested position of nematodes. Both taxa showed
slightly longer branch lengths, and long-branch attraction
artifacts [27] may be affecting the individual datasets,
causing low consensus values. Also, recent empirical [28]
and simulation [29] studies suggest that results from
multigene analyses are more accurate when a tree is
derived from a concatenated dataset of individual genes
rather than a consensus of trees from multiple analyses.
Divergence times were estimated for both the 15-genome
and 12-genome datasets (Table 2). Results were consistent
with previous studies [17,30-33], showing an early
divergence between plants, animals, and fungi (animals/
fungi vs. plants ~1670 Ma, animals vs. fungi ~1400 Ma),
and a Precambrian origin for animals (~900–1100 Ma).
To specifically address the deuterostome-arthropod divergence within animals, two additional datasets were
assembled to maximize the number of proteins analyzed:
the intersection of seven genomes (Homo, Mus, Rattus,

The complete genome sequence of an organism is essentially the maximum amount of discrete, genetically
encoded information available for evolutionary analyses.
However, orthology determination has been a major
obstacle in the analysis of complete genomes, especially
in eukaryotes where considerable gene duplication and
loss has created additional complexity. Our approach for
evolutionary analysis of complete eukaryote genome
sequences is both simple and fast compared with the conventional method of gene-by-gene orthology determination using similarity searches in the public databases. The
results of this approach applied to a subset of the available
eukaryote genomes show agreement with previous results
using conventional (non-genomic) approaches. In addition, the relatively high consensus values for most nodes
indicate general agreement in tree topology among individual panorthologs.
The relatively low number of common genes in our intersections of 12–17 genomes is a combination of using panorthologs and including distantly related species. Genes
are more likely to duplicate over long periods of evolutionary time, as in the time elapsed since plants separated

from animals (~1600 Ma) [17,32]. Therefore, a better
approach with such distantly related species (e.g., all
eukaryotes), and those groups with high levels of gene
duplication and gene loss (e.g., nematodes), would be to
relax the orthology criterion and include synorthologs. In
that case, a representative or consensus sequence may be
chosen from among in-paralogs. On the other hand, the
implementation used here (panorthologs) should yield
many genes in analyses of genomes from closely related
species (e.g., within mammals), even if large numbers of
species are used.
The use of sequence data for comparative genomics and
phylogenetics has several advantages over the use of
datasets based on the presence and absence or position of
genes, introns and insertions. Sequence data can provide
a larger number of characters for analysis, yielding hundreds of thousands of amino acid sites and more than a
million nucleotide sites in some cases. Also, statistical
models of sequence change are better known than those
for non-sequence based data. Finally, the assembly of
sequence data from complete genomes of multiple organisms not only facilitates phylogenetic and divergence time
analyses, but a diversity of other comparative evolutionary analyses requiring sequence information [42,43].

Conclusion
Unlike previous studies of complete eukaryote genomes,
here we have used a fast, conservative approach to assemble orthologous clusters of proteins for phylogenetic analysis and divergence time estimation. Our results are
similar to previous studies that used conventional
(slower) gene-by-gene data mining. We find that complete genome sequences support the close evolutionary
relationship between animals and fungi, and also that
molecular divergences between animals occurred approximately 400 million years before the Cambrian Explosion
of fossils. Our approach will be further tested as more
eukaryote genomes are sequenced.

Methods
Multigenome intersection approach for evolutionary
analysis (MIA): Reciprocal BLAST [44] searches of
genomes versus themselves and versus all other genomes
included in the analysis were used to generate lists of pairwise similarity scores for each transcript. These scores were
then used to generate orthologous clusters of proteins by
first determining the "primary" ortholog pair through
reciprocal best hits, then adding lineage-specific paralogs
(in-paralogs) as implemented in INPARANOID [45]. The
settings used here (sequence overlap cut-off 50%, group
overlap cut-off 50%, in-paralog confidence cut-off 5%)
were considered optimal in the sense that all closely
related lineage-specific paralogs (and alternative transcripts) will be placed in the same pairwise cluster, mini-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/53

mizing the probability that the same gene will be
represented in more than one cluster. In-paralogs are
added to clusters if they are more similar to one member
of the primary ortholog pair than the two primary
orthologs are to each other [45].
Only pairwise ortholog clusters can be obtained using
INPARANOID. For phylogenetic analysis, ortholog sets
for a larger number of genomes (at least four) must be
constructed. Therefore, we combined the pairwise
ortholog clusters from groups of species using a relational
database. The intersection between ortholog clusters was
determined by iteratively comparing sequence identification tags and reducing the intersected clusters at each
round to exclude clusters that represent relationships
other than panorthology. For example, consider genomes
A, B and C. First, ortholog clusters are determined for each
pairwise genome comparison, which results in clusters: AB, B-C and A-C. Intersection of sets A-B and B-C is
obtained by searching for common sequences of genome
B in the two sets and merging the two sets accordingly into
an ortholog cluster set of A-B-C. This combined set is
reduced to include only clusters with panorthology
relationships, i.e. only clusters with one sequence for each
of the genomes A, B and C are retained. Further, the combined cluster A-B-C is compared with the pairwise cluster
A-C based on common sequence tags for genome C. Any
cluster from the combined A-B-C set that does not agree
with the sequence grouping of genomes A and C is
removed. This last step serves as an important check for
orthology in each iteration of the intersection procedure,
and is similar to the construction of three-member COGs
(clusters of orthologous groups) [46]. The steps described
above were performed iteratively in order to add more
species to the ortholog clusters. Any number of genomes
can be intersected (tested up to seventeen here), and an
outgroup can be treated as part of the intersection or
added separately by using a pairwise comparison to one of
the in-group taxa. All programming was written in Perl.
Analysis of Eukaryote Genomes: Complete protein transcripts were obtained for the following eukaryote
genomes [three letter abbreviation]: Homo sapiens [Hsa]
(version 34b.2) [16,47,48]; Mus musculus [Mmu] (version
32.2) [48,49]; Rattus norvegicus [Rno] (version 3b.1)
[19,48]; Takifugu rubripes [Tru] (version 3.0) [50,51];
Ciona intestionalis [Cin] (version 1.0) [51,52]; Drosophila
melanogaster [Dme] (version 3.1) [53,54]; Anopheles gambiae [Aga] (version 2a.2) [48,55]; Caenorhabditis elegans
[Cel] (version 120) [56,57]; Caenorhabditis briggsae [Cbr]
(version 25) [21,57]; Saccharomyces cerevisiae [Sce]
[58,59]; Neurospora crassa [Ncr] (version 3) [60,61]; Ashbya gossypii [Ago] (version 1.0) [62,63]; Encephalitozoon

lardia theta nucleomorph [Gtn] [23,64]; and Plasmodium
falciparum 3D7 [Pfa] (version 4.1) [25,69]. Some genome
transcripts were given unique sequence identifiers to
avoid redundancy when sequence tags are truncated. The
intersection of these seventeen genomes was determined
as described above.
Each panortholog was aligned [70] and individual datasets were concatenated. Both individual panorthologs and
concatenations were analyzed using maximum likelihood
[71] to determine alpha parameters for the gamma rateheterogeneity correction. Phylogenetic trees of concatenated datasets were reconstructed using neighbor-joining
(Poisson + gamma correction model) with bootstrapping
(2000 replicates) [72] and maximum likelihood (JTT +
gamma correction model) with 1000 puzzling steps [73].
Phylogenetic trees of individual datasets were reconstructed using maximum likelihood (Poisson + gamma
correction model) [71] and a consensus tree was derived
[74]. Consensus values (i.e. the proportion of trees recovering a specific node) were calculated for each dataset.

Divergence times were estimated for concatenated datasets using Bayesian inference (JTT model) [75] as
described previously [17]. The following fossil dates were
used as minimum constraints: Mus-Rattus 12 Ma [76], primate-rodent 65 Ma [77], tetrapod-actinopterygian fish
425 Ma (lower bound) and 495 Ma (upper bound) [78],
vertebrate-urochordate 520 Ma [79], Drosophila-Anopheles
250 Ma [80], chordate-arthropod 545 Ma [77], green
algae/plants-red algae 1200 Ma [40].
