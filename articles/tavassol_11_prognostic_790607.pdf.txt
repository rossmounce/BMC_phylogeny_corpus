Abstract
Backround: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is characterized by an aggressive growth pattern, local
invasiveness, and spread to cervical lymph nodes. Overall survival rates have not improved, primarily due to
locoregional tumor recurrences and distant metastasis. To date, no trustworthy or clinically applicable marker of
tumor aggressiveness has been identified for OSCC. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) play a role in tumor antigenicity.
This study aimed to investigate the expression and prognostic significance of highly stress-inducible HSP70 in
OSCC.
Methods: Immunohistochemical staining for HSP70 was performed on surgical specimens obtained from 61
patients with OSCC. Light microscopy and analysis 3.1® (Soft Imaging System, Münster, Germany), an image
processing and analysis program, were used for evaluating HSP70 expression. The tumor region was defined as the
region of interest (ROI) and HSP70-positive staining was analyzed.
Results: Immunoreactivity for HSP70 was positive in tumor cells of 38 of all patients (63.3%). Positive
immunoreactivity of tumor cells could be detected in 17 of 28 patients with T2 tumors (60.7%) Prognostic
significance of HSP70 expression in tumor cells was detected in patients with T2 tumors (p = 0.009).
Conclusions: The survival of patients suffering from T2 tumors with positive HSP70 expression was 8 times higher
than that for patients with negative HSP70 expression, suggesting that T1-T2 tumors of OSCC with low expression
of HSP70 require more radical treatment.

Background
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a frequently
occurring cancer in the head and neck region, is characterized by an aggressive growth pattern, local invasiveness, and spread to cervical lymph nodes. Patient
outcome depends on the conventional prognostic factors
used in clinical practice. Advances in surgical and nonsurgical treatments have led to increased local tumor
control in recent years. However, overall survival rates
have not improved because of the prevalence of locoregional tumor recurrence and distant metastasis.
Although there is general agreement that tumor infiltration of the resection margin is one of the most relevant
predictive factors for the development of a local recurrent carcinoma, the presence of tumor-free margins

does not guarantee against recurrence because carcinoma can develop following discontinued expansion of
tumor cells in the vicinity [1,2]. To improve survival
periods of these patients, molecular and histological
markers must be identified to target tumors with a high
likelihood of metastatic spread. To date, no reliable or
clinically applicable marker of tumor aggressiveness has
been identified for OSCC. Different markers/marker
complexes have been identified as active in tumor suppression or antitumor defense and display potential as
prognostic factors. Furthermore, molecular biology
investigations of resection margins have shown that
detection of mutant p53 genes is linked with increased
incidence of recurrent tumors. The p53 molecule is a
53-kD polypeptide. It acts as a transcription factor that
controls the cell cycle by either arresting cells in the G1
phase through activation of the p21 gene or triggering
apoptosis by activating genes. Another more recent
approach to oral carcinogenesis focuses on the escape of

malignant cells from apoptotic signals. Extensive
research has been carried out on p53 in this respect,
and there is broad evidence for its role in the manifestation of oral carcinoma. However, published data indicates that p53 alone is not particularly valuable in
predicting prognosis. Additional markers of apoptosis
such as Fas, Fas ligand (FasL), and Bax, as well as antiapoptotic molecules such as bcl2/BAG-1, are reported
to be relevant to prognosis in a smaller number of publications. All of these have shown a significant correlation with prognosis, but it is difficult to draw
conclusions on the prognostic validity of these markers
on the basis of the present data [3-5].
Another approach in predicting prognosis in cancer is
expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs). HSPs are
found in all organisms and all cell types. They are the
most phylogenetically conserved proteins known with
respect to both structure and function [6]. Usually,
HSPs are expressed at low levels, and under normal
physiological conditions, many members of the HSP
family are involved in protein synthesis. When a cell is
stressed, oligomeric complexes disassemble and polypeptides unfold. Under these conditions, the role of
HSPs is to reverse such changes and, if refolding
becomes impossible, to potentially speed up the removal
of such denatured proteins. Expression of HSPs is
induced even under nonstress conditions, including
those of the cell cycle, development, and differentiation
[7,8]. During carcinogenesis, HSPs have been reported
to alter their expression levels, showing either an
increase or a decrease [9,10]). HSP70 expression in colorectal carcinoma and breast carcinoma has been significantly correlated with low differentiation and poor
prognosis [11,12], whereas in renal cell carcinoma it has
been reported to be associated with good prognosis [13].
Five main families of HSPs are known: low molecular
weight, HSP65, HSP70, HSP90, and HSP100. Over the
last few years, HSPs have also been shown to play a role
in the antigenicity of tumors. Expression of HSPs on the
surface of tumor cells, instead of their normal intracellular location, suggests they play a role in inducing an
immune response against cancer. In a chemically
induced mouse sarcoma, Ullrich et al. identified a
tumor-specific transplantation antigen that appears to
be an HSP, which is expressed on the cell surface and
induces protective immunity [14]. Furthermore, a protein related to the HSP70 family has been shown to be
immunogenic in oncogene-transformed rat fibroblasts
[15], and HSP70 derived from MethA sarcoma (but not
from normal tissue) has been demonstrated to be
immunogenic, not in itself but in association with
tumor peptides. The prognostic significance of HSP70
in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma has been
reported [16]. The aim of the present study was to

investigate the expression of highly stress-inducible
HSP70 in OSCC and its use in predicting prognosis.

Methods
Patients

Surgical specimens were obtained from 61 patients (49
men and 12 women) with OSCC who underwent potentially curative surgery at the Department of Oral and
Maxillofacial Surgery, Hanover Medical School, Hanover, Germany, between 1996 and 2001. Tumor stage
and disease grade were classified according to the fifth
edition of the TNM classification of the International
Union Against Cancer (UICC). None of the patients had
received irradiation or chemotherapy prior to surgery or
had distant metastases at the time of surgery. Patients
who underwent no curative surgery and/or inadequate
follow-up were not included in the study.
Immunohistochemistry

Serial 3-mm sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated,
washed and, treated with a solution of 2% horse
serum, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma Corporation, Steinheim, Germany), and 0.1% sodium acid in
150 mmol/l phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2)
for 15 min to block nonspecific antibody-binding. A
polyclonal rabbit anti-HSP70 antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA), specific to HSP from Escherichia coli,
which shares more than 48% sequence homology with
mammalian HSP70 was the first layer. The optimal
dilution of anti-HSP antibody (1:250) was determined
by titration. The selected sections were incubated with
this antibody for 120 min at room temperature (RT).
The second layer, a biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
immunoglobulin (Oncogene, San Diego, CA USA)
diluted 1:200 in PBS was incubated for 30 min at RT.
The third layer was an avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex (Dako) diluted 1:50 in PBS. Incubation
was, as before, 30 min at RT. Sections were washed for
10 min in 2 changes of PBS between each layer. The
color reaction was developed with a solution consisting
of 0.05% 3,30-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride
(Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), 0.03% nickel chloride
(Sigma), and 0.01% hydrogen peroxide in 48 mmol/l
Tris-HCL, pH 7.6 (Sigma). Counterstaining was carried
out with Mayer’s hematoxylin [6].
Evaluation of HSP70 Expression

Light microscopy and analysis 3.1® (Soft Imaging System, Münster, Germany), an image processing and analysis program, were used for evaluating HSP70
expression. The tumor region was defined as the region
of interest (ROI) and HSP70-positive staining was analyzed. When 20% or more of the tumor cells in a given
specimen were positively stained, the sample was graded

Tavassol et al. Head & Neck Oncology 2011, 3:10

as HSP70 positive; it was graded negative when fewer
than 20% of the tumor cells were stained [16].
Evaluation of Clinicopathological Parameters

Histological evaluation was performed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. TNM-classification was applied
with regard to the clinical stage, depth of tumor invasion, lymph node status, and histological typing using
the World Health Organization classification.
Statistical analysis

The statistical significance of the data was analyzed
using the chi-square test. Patients’ postoperative status
was assessed on December 31, 2008. No patient with
incomplete follow-up was included in the evaluation.
The cumulative survival rate was calculated by the
Kaplan-Meier method [17], and statistical significance
was analyzed by the log-rank test. To confirm the statistical significance of HSP70 expression as a prognostic
indicator, multivariate analysis was performed using the
Cox proportional-hazards regression model [18].

Results
Clinical and pathological features

Of the 61 patients, 49 were men and 12 women. The age
of the patients ranged from 35 to 60 years with a mean
age of 50.7 years. T2 tumors were present in 28 patients,
T3 tumors in 3 patients, and T4 tumors in 30 patients.
Lymph node metastases were found in 25 patients.
Clinicopathological findings and survival

There was no statistical influence on prognosis of grading, T- stadium, age, and sex of the patients. Presence
of positive lymph nodes (N+) was identified as a prognostic factor with significant influence in univariate and
multivariate analysis, as well in all patients suffering
from T2 tumors (Table 1, Figure 1A, and Figure 1B).
The mortality risk of these patients is 13 times than that
of patients with negative nodes.

significance of HSP70 expression in tumor cells could be
detected in patients suffering from T2 tumors. Figure 3
shows cumulative survival curves for patients with T2
tumors with positive and negative HSP70 expression
(Table 1 and Figure 3).
The survival of patients suffering from T2 tumors with
positive HSP70 expression was 8 times higher than that
for patients with negative HSP70 expression.

Discussion
Many studies in cell biology have addressed the roles of
HSPs as molecular chaperones, including protein folding
and unfolding, translocation, and prevention of inappropriate protein aggregation [7,19]. These findings show
an association between HSPs and cell proliferation and the
prevention of apoptosis [20]. While HSP expression has
been recognized as a factor of prognostic value in certain
tumors, the data are limited and the results often contradictory. For example, inducible HSP72 has been shown to
be a negative prognostic factor for disease-free survival
(DFS) in patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer
[21], whereas other authors have shown that HSP72

positively correlates with estrogen receptors and inversely
with expression of mutant p53 [22]. Santarosa et al.
demonstrated prognostic implications of expression of
HSP70 in patients suffering from renal cancer [23].
Although some evidence indicates that HSPs are involved
in various aspects of cell transformation and immune
response against cancer [24], their biological role and its
implications for the clinical course in cancer patients are
not clear. In OSCC, the number of positive nodes, macroscopic extracapsular spread, and tumor infiltration of the
resection margins have been described as significant prognostic factors [1,2]. Studies concerning HSP70 as a prognostic factor in esophageal carcinoma suggest that
reduction of HSP70 expression is significantly correlated
with poor prognosis [16,25]. Although several studies have
been performed to elucidate the relationship between
HSPs and tumors in various organs, to our knowledge,
there are comparatively few reports related to OSCC.
Sugarman et al. reported that HSP70 expression is not a
definitive marker of oral malignancy or malignant potential [26]. In terms of prognostic significance, Ito et al.
examined 24 specimens of patients suffering from OSCC.
Although HSP immunohistochemistry revealed changes in
HSP expression during tumorigenesis of squamous epithelium of the tongue, there was no correlation between HSP
staining and survival period, stage, lymph node metastasis,
histological grade, or p53 immunostaining [27]. These
results are in line with those of Gandour-Edwards et al,
who found that HSPs were expressed in normal upper
respiratory tract squamous mucosa, and their role in carcinoma thus remains unclear. None of the markers (p53,

Tavassol et al. Head & Neck Oncology 2011, 3:10
http://www.headandneckoncology.org/content/3/1/10

HSP27, or HSP70) demonstrated prognostic significance
for 5-year survival. We confirm the previously identified
association of cervical lymph node metastases with
decreased survival [5].
The results of the previously published data are not in
line with the findings of the present study. In this study,
we demonstrated that for patients suffering from T2tumors, positive expression of HSP70 results in a significantly lower mortality risk compared with patients with
negative expression. The main difference regarding the
study design may be that, in contrast to previous studies, our patient population was divided according to
tumor stages in the different T-stadium of the tumor.
The purpose of this division was to analyze the prognostic significance of each T-stadium separately. Considering the entire patient group, our findings would suggest
the same result: HSP70 has no prognostic implications
for our patients. Also in the seperated T3- and T4tumors, HSP 70 did not show any prognostic significance. Only after focusing on patients suffering from
T2-tumors could a significant difference be detected.
The survival of patients suffering from T2 tumors with
positive HSP70 expression was 8 times higher than that
for patients with negative HSP70 expression.

Conclusions
The results of our study suggests that expression of
HSP70 affects survival only in the early stage of the disease and that HSP70 membrane expression, in particular, is a target for natural killer cells [28]. Therefore in
T2-tumors, the increased level of HSP70 may result in
an extended tumor control by the natural killer cells. By
implication, T1-T2 tumors of OSCC with low expression of Hsp70 could require more radical treatment.
