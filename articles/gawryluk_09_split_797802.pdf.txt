Abstract
Background: Analyses based on phylogenetic and ultrastructural data have suggested that
euglenids (such as Euglena gracilis), trypanosomatids and diplonemids are members of a
monophyletic lineage termed Euglenozoa. However, many uncertainties are associated with
phylogenetic reconstructions for ancient and rapidly evolving groups; thus, rare genomic characters
become increasingly important in reinforcing inferred phylogenetic relationships.
Findings: We discovered that the iron-sulfur subunit (SdhB) of mitochondrial succinate
dehydrogenase is encoded by a split and rearranged nuclear gene in Euglena gracilis and
trypanosomatids, an example of a rare genomic character. The two subgenic modules are
transcribed independently and the resulting mRNAs appear to be independently translated, with
the two protein products imported into mitochondria, based on the presence of predicted
mitochondrial targeting peptides. Although the inferred protein sequences are in general very
divergent from those of other organisms, all of the required iron-sulfur cluster-coordinating
residues are present. Moreover, the discontinuity in the euglenozoan SdhB sequence occurs
between the two domains of a typical, covalently continuous SdhB, consistent with the inference
that the euglenozoan 'half' proteins are functional.
Conclusion: The discovery of this unique molecular marker provides evidence for the monophyly
of Euglenozoa that is independent of evolutionary models. Our results pose questions about the
origin and timing of this novel gene arrangement and the structure and function of euglenozoan
SdhB.

Background
Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, Complex II) is a membrane-anchored protein complex of the mitochondrial
and bacterial electron transport chain that catalyzes the
oxidation of succinate to fumarate, and that reduces FAD
to FADH2 in the process (although it is capable of the
reverse reaction under favorable conditions). High-resolution crystal structures of Complex II from bacterial (E. coli;
[1]), avian (chicken; [2]) and mammalian (pig; [3])

sources demonstrate that it is a heterotetramer consisting
of the succinate-oxidizing, matrix-associated, flavoprotein
subunit (SdhA), an electron transfer iron-sulfur subunit
(SdhB) and two hydrophobic membrane anchors (SdhC
and SdhD) that provide the binding site for ubiquinone
and are required for integration of the complex into the
inner mitochondrial membrane. SdhA-D are nucleusencoded in a wide variety of eukaryotes, including mammals, whereas SdhB-D are specified by the gene-rich mitoPage 1 of 7

chondrial genomes of certain protists such as red algae
and jakobid flagellates [4]. SdhA invariably appears to be
nucleus-encoded.
Euglena gracilis is a free-living, flagellated eukaryotic
microbe that contains a plastid likely acquired through
the engulfment of a green alga [5]. A monophyletic
'Euglenozoa' clade comprising Euglena (and related euglenids) along with two aplastidic lineages, the kinetoplastids (encompassing trypanosomatids and bodonids)
and the predominantly free-living diplonemids, has been
postulated principally on the basis of shared ultrastructural features, including disc-shaped mitochondrial cristae and flagellar paraxonemal rods [6]. Phylogenetic
reconstructions based on small subunit ribosomal RNA
(SSU rRNA; [7]) and protein [8] sequences established
that these physiologically and ecologically disparate taxa
likely comprise a (potentially early-branching) monophyletic group. However, the well-documented effects of
rapid rates of sequence change, along with the acquisition
of a secondary endosymbiont [5] (evidenced by the presence in Euglena of a plastid with three surrounding membranes) and possible ephemeral, cryptic endosymbioses
[9], have complicated reconstructions of Euglena's evolutionary history. In particular, the transfer of endosymbiont-derived genes to the nucleus has, in effect, yielded a
mosaic nuclear genome displaying characteristics of all
constituent sources [10]. Moreover, the internal branching patterns within Euglenozoa are still not completely
resolved [11], although phylogenies based on conserved
protein genes seem to be consistent in placing euglenids
at the base of Euglenozoa, with diplonemids and kinetoplastids forming a later diverging sister group [9].
Here we report that in E. gracilis, the nucleus-encoded
sdhB gene is split into two independently transcribed (and
presumably independently translated) subgenic modules
whose products correspond to the N-terminal and C-terminal halves (referred to here as SdhB-n and SdhB-c,
respectively) of a typical SdhB protein. Moreover, in various trypanosome species, we have identified separate
genes encoding predicted proteins corresponding to
SdhB-n and SdhB-c. The splitting of sdhB in Euglena and
trypanosomatids is an example of a unique molecular
character that specifically unites these two phylogenetic
groups and raises interesting questions about the evolution and function of euglenozoan SdhB.

Results and discussion
Relatively few genomic data are available for Euglena. Neither nuclear nor mitochondrial genome sequencing
projects are currently being undertaken, and only three
mitochondrion-encoded protein-coding genes (cox1, cox2
and nad6) have been identified thus far [[12,13], GenBank:AF156178]. Nevertheless, the construction and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/2/16

sequencing of EST libraries generated from mature
mRNAs is being exploited to better understand the biochemistry and evolution of this organism. The conserved
24-nucleotide 5' spliced leader (SL) sequence characteristic of Euglena nucleus-encoded mRNAs [14] confers a specific advantage in that its presence in an EST confirms that
the translated sequence encompasses the complete N-terminus of the corresponding protein. This information is
important in predicting the subcellular localization of a
given protein product, as the signals required for targeting
proteins to various subcellular compartments, including
mitochondria, are frequently located at protein N-termini.
Analysis of Euglena gracilis EST data demonstrates that
SdhB is expressed as separate N- and C-terminal units. The
EST clusters from Euglena are considered to be complete,
as those representing both sdhB-n and sdhB-c each contains at least 10 of the 3'-most nucleotides ('TTTTTTTTCG') of the conserved SL sequence at the 5' end (Figures
1A,B), an ATG initiation codon a few nucleotides further
downstream, and a stop codon near the 3' end of the EST
sequence. Moreover, the presence of an SL in Euglena ESTs
demonstrates that sdhB-n and sdhB-c are nucleus-encoded
in this protist, as mitochondrial transcripts are not known
to contain spliced leaders. In total, we identified 8 and 4
ESTs corresponding, respectively, to Euglena sdhB-n and
sdhB-c. Nearly complete sdhB-n and sdhB-c ESTs were also
found for the related species, Euglena (Astasia) longa.
SdhB-n and SdhB-c protein sequences from E. gracilis and
E. longa are 93% and 91% identical, respectively.
Although the E. longa ESTs lack the SL and the sequence
corresponding to the extreme N-termini of the two proteins, these ESTs provide further evidence that the sdhB
modules are transcribed separately in the nucleus of
euglenids. Similarly, SdhB sequences inferred from the
genome sequences of several trypanosome species indicate that SdhB is also expressed as two separate pieces in
these organisms (see Figure 2 for partial protein alignments and additional files 1 and 2 for more extensive
alignments). In fact, the two SdhB pieces are encoded on
separate chromosomes in the nuclear genomes of
trypanosomatids: in T. brucei, sdhB-n is on chromosome 8
while sdhB-c is on chromosome 9, whereas in L. major,
sdhB-n is on chromosome 23 and sdhB-c is on chromosome 15. The fragmented nature of sdhB in trypanosomatids was evidently not previously noted, as the relevant
coding regions in both T. brucei and L. major are annotated
simply as 'succinate dehydrogenase subunits' or 'hypothetical proteins'. BLAST searches did not retrieve any sdhB
transcripts from the limited diplonemid EST libraries
available in TBestDB http://amoebidia.bcm.umon
treal.ca/pepdb/searches/login.php?bye=true, including
those of D. papillatum, D. ambulator and Rhyncopus; moreover, no mitochondrion-encoded sdhB gene was identi-

over, the N-terminal sequences of SdhB-n and SdhB-c,
which are rich in Arg, Ser and hydrophobic residues,
closely resemble a consensus E. gracilis mTP profile generated from an alignment of 107 predicted mitochondriontargeted proteins (Figure 1C). That both SdhB-n and
SdhB-c contain predicted mTPs is strong evidence that
Euglena imports both of these separate proteins independently into mitochondria, where they presumably
form a heterodimer that effects the role of the classical,
covalently continuous SdhB. In trypanosomatids, only
SdhB-n is confidently predicted to possess a mTP. The significance of this observation is unclear, although it is possible that SdhB-c is only imported into mitochondria
under certain developmental or physiological conditions,
or that the protein is imported in a fashion that does not
require a cleavable mTP [18].

fied during sequencing of the mitochondrial genome of
Diplonema papillatum [15]. Nevertheless, parsimony considerations argue that SdhB is nucleus-encoded and bipartite in diplonemids as well, given phylogenetic evidence
indicating that diplonemids and trypanosomatids [8] or
diplonemids and euglenids [7] are sister groups. Exhaustive searches of available genomic and EST data did not
turn up evidence of this split SdhB gene arrangement anywhere outside Euglenozoa.
Both of the deduced Euglena SdhB pieces (Figure 3) are
predicted to contain mitochondrial targeting peptides
(mTPs). TargetP [16] predicts a mitochondrial localization for SdhB-n and SdhB-c with 91.5% and 96.1% confidence, respectively, whereas the confidence levels with
MitoProtII [17] are 99.8% and 95.7%, respectively. More-

The discovery of split genes encoding proteins that function within mitochondria is not without precedent. For
instance, cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 (Cox2) in the
green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Polytomella sp.
[19] and in several apicomplexan parasites [20] and dinoflagellates [21] is a nucleus-encoded heterodimer specified by two separate subgenic modules. In
Chlamydomonas, the N-terminal portion of Cox2 has been
shown to contain a cleavable N-terminal mTP, whereas
the C-terminal unit does not [19]. This situation parallels
that reported here for trypanosome SdhB-c, which does
not appear to contain a canonical cleavable mTP. In the
case of chlamydomonad algae, it has been proposed that
a 20-amino acid C-terminal extension in Cox2a (the Nterminal unit) and a 42-amino acid N-terminal extension
in Cox2b might facilitate the functional interaction of
these two subunits [19]. In the absence of biochemical
evidence confirming the length of the mitochondrial targeting peptide, it is not possible to determine unequivocally whether or not trypanosome SdhB-c has an Nterminal extension. On the other hand, SdhB-n from
Euglena does possess a C-terminal extension of ~35 amino
acids, whereas the corresponding trypanosome SdhB-n Cterminal extension is ~105 residues long. Sequence alignments do not indicate any significant similarity between
the Euglena and trypanosome extensions. As proposed for
Cox2 in chlamydomonads, these extensions might allow
the dimerization of SdhB-n and SdhB-c in euglenozoans,
although bioinformatic analysis does not suggest the presence of obvious protein-protein interaction domains.
From a structural perspective, the split in the SdhB
sequence in Euglena and trypanosomatids occurs in a
region that might be particularly tolerant of such disruption (Figure 3). SdhB contains three iron-sulfur (Fe-S)
centers, arranged in a linear chain, that function to transport electrons from SdhA to the membrane-integrated
subunits [1]. SdhB from E. coli is organized into two

Organization of protein domains in typical SdhB proteins versus SdhB-n and SdhB-c from Euglena and

domains that are present in the C-terminal half of SdhB.
domains: an N-terminal domain containing a [2Fe-2S]
cluster that forms a fold similar to plant-type ferredoxins
and a C-terminal domain that houses the [3Fe-4S] and
[4Fe-4S] clusters with a fold similar to bacterial ferredoxins [22]. SdhB-n from Euglena contains a predicted Fer2
domain whereas SdhB-c is predicted to contain two Fer4
domains, indicating that the break between Euglena SdhBn and SdhB-c occurs in a region corresponding to the junction between the two E. coli domains. Moreover, protein
alignments demonstrate that all of the Cys residues
required for co-ordination of the three Fe-S clusters in E.
coli SdhB are accounted for when both SdhB-n and SdhBc from Euglenozoa are considered. These observations
lend further support to the notion that these separate protein halves are functional, as rearrangement occurring
within protein domains and/or loss of Fe-S cluster ligands
would likely not be tolerated.
Notably, the amino acid sequences of SdhB-n and SdhB-c
from Euglenozoa are exceptionally divergent in comparison with SdhB characterized to date in any other organism. In fact, many of the otherwise universally (or nearly
universally) conserved residues have been substituted
with different ones in Euglenozoa. For instance, a universally conserved Arg (R56 in E. coli) is Cys in SdhB-n of
both Euglena and trypanosomatids (Figure 2A, a). Conversely, the conserved Cys corresponding to C154 in E.
coli is Ser in Euglena and trypanosome SdhB-c (Figure 2B,
b), as well as in SdhB from the unrelated malaria parasite,

Plasmodium falciparum. The nearby Ser-Thr-Ser motif
present in all other SdhB sequences examined here (corresponding to E. coli residues 156â158; Figure 2B, c) is ThrAla-Ala in Euglena. Although E. coli C154 is not directly
responsible for coordinating Fe-S clusters in SdhB, the
crystal structure suggests that it contributes a hydrogen
bond to the thiol group, important in stabilizing the [4Fe4S] cluster ligand C152 [1]. It is thought that this H-bond
maintains a higher midpoint potential in the [4Fe-4S]
cluster. Interestingly, Cheng et al. [23] found a direct relationship between the midpoint potential of the [4Fe-4S]
cluster and the turnover rates of succinate dehydrogenase,
whereas Hudson et al. [24] found the inverse for the Fe-S
subunit of E. coli fumarate reductase (Frd; an homologous
enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of fumarate to succinate). Thus, the presence of C154 may favor the in vivo
oxidation of succinate to fumarate, as opposed to the
reverse reaction [23]. E. coli FrdB, which has a lower [4Fe4S] cluster midpoint potential than does E. coli SdhB, has
a Leu residue instead of the E. coli C154 equivalent (Figure
2B, b) and a Tyr-Ala-Ala motif (Thr-Ala-Ala in Euglena)
instead of Ser-Thr-Ser (Figure 2B, c). Thus, there exist
some interesting parallels between the euglenozoan SdhB
and E. coli FrdB sequences, although phylogenetic analyses (see additional file 3: SdhB phylogenetic tree) clearly
demonstrate that SdhB-n and SdhB-c are SdhB (and not
FrdB) homologs. Moreover, it is quite possible that the Ser
in euglenozoan SdhB-c contributes a stabilizing hydrogen
bond to the [4Fe-4S] cluster (equivalent to the function of
C154 of E. coli) whereas Leu in FrdB could not. Taken
together, the euglenozoan SdhB structure and sequence
are intriguing, and emphasize the need for biochemical
investigations to fully understand the function and structure of these split proteins.

Methods
Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from E. gracilis strain Z
were prepared as described in [25]. ESTs encoding Euglena
SdhB were identified by a tBLASTn [26] search of the taxonomically broad EST database (TBestDB; [27]) and GenBank, using SdhB from Reclinomonas americana
(gi:11466549) as query. Consensus EST sequences specifying SdhB-n and SdhB-c were translated and the inferred
protein sequences were subsequently used to query the
non-redundant protein sequence database at NCBI (using
BLASTp) along with the non-human, non-mouse EST
database (est_others) and TBestDB (using tBLASTn).
Database accession numbers are given in additional file 4.
The programs TargetP [16] and MitoProt II [17] were used
to assess the probability of mitochondrial localization for
Euglena and trypanosome SdhB-n and SdhB-c. When
using TargetP for Euglena proteins, we selected the 'Plant'
organism group in order to include the possibility of plastid-targeting, whereas we selected the 'Animal' organism
group for trypanosomatids, as the latter do not contain

plastids. MitoProt II contains no option for assessing plastid localization. The consensus E. gracilis mTP profile was
generated using LogoBar-0.9.12 [28] from a de-gapped
alignment of the 30-most N-terminal residues from 107
predicted E. gracilis mitochondrion-targeted proteins.

Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of concatenated SdhB-n and
SdhB-c proteins. This maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree reconstruction demonstrates that the euglenozoan SdhB-n and SdhB-c proteins are
orthologs of mitochondrial SdhB (as opposed to FrdB). Euglenozoan
SdhB-n and SdhB-c protein sequences were concatenated and aligned
with SdhB and FrdB sequences from other eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
The alignments were edited and PHYML was used to reconstruct the phylogeny. The WAG amino acid substitution model was used, with no invariable sites, 8 substitution rate categories and an estimated distribution
parameter. Nonparametric bootstrap analyses (100) were performed.

Conserved domains were identified by searching the Pfam
and SMART databases at the SMART server [29], using E.
gracilis SdhB-n and SdhB-c as queries. Protein alignments
were constructed using Muscle v3.6 [30] with default
parameters and edited with the BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor. The editing function was used to remove
gaps from the non-homologous euglenozoan protein
extensions. However, regions corresponding to likely
mTPs were left unedited. In the alignment, shading of a
given column reflects a minimum of 60% identity.
