Abstract
Background: Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes severe respiratory disease in infants. Airway epithelial
cells are the principle targets of RSV infection. However, the mechanisms by which it causes disease are poorly
understood. Most RSV pathogenesis data are derived using laboratory-adapted prototypic strains. We hypothesized
that such strains may be poorly representative of recent clinical isolates in terms of virus/host interactions in
primary human bronchial epithelial cells (PBECs).
Methods: To address this hypothesis, we isolated three RSV strains from infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis and
compared them with the prototypic RSV A2 in terms of cytopathology, virus growth kinetics and chemokine
secretion in infected PBEC monolayers.
Results: RSV A2 rapidly obliterated the PBECs, whereas the clinical isolates caused much less cytopathology.
Concomitantly, RSV A2 also grew faster and to higher titers in PBECs. Furthermore, dramatically increased secretion
of IP-10 and RANTES was evident following A2 infection compared with the clinical isolates.
Conclusions: The prototypic RSV strain A2 is poorly representative of recent clinical isolates in terms of
cytopathogenicity, viral growth kinetics and pro-inflammatory responses induced following infection of PBEC
monolayers. Thus, the choice of RSV strain may have important implications for future RSV pathogenesis studies.

Introduction
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is one of the
leading causes of infant hospitalization. Virtually all children are infected by the age of two [1]. Due to an
incomplete immunization following primary infection
[2], re-infections occur throughout life. RSV is also
increasingly recognized as a cause of severe illness in
adults and especially the elderly [3]. Moreover, the
impact of RSV infections is probably underestimated, as
early-life infections are associated with the development
of recurrent wheeze (asthma) and allergy during childhood [4,5]. Although RSV was first described in 1956
[6], there is still no effective vaccine or specific therapies
and treatment is essentially supportive.

Based primarily on G gene variability, RSV strains are
divided into subgroups A or B [7]. Many RSV infection
experiments employ the A2 strain as the prototype [8].
However, since RSV A2 has been extensively passaged
in vitro it is likely to have adapted to continuous cell
lines and, therefore, might not be representative of
recent clinical RSV isolates either genotypically or phenotypically. Moreover, RSV pathogenicity is often investigated in animal models, such as mice, ferrets or cotton
rats, which are semi-permissive for RSV infection, and
in continuous cells lines in vitro, which may not be
representative of primary bronchial epithelial cells invivo. As airway epithelial cells are the principle targets
of RSV infection and infants/young children are the
most recognizable population affected by severe RSV
disease, we hypothesized that an RSV infection model
based on primary paediatric bronchial epithelial cells

would provide a relevant alternative to more established
in vitro models.
In the present study, therefore, we investigated RSV
infection using primary paediatric bronchial epithelial
cells (PBECs), derived from non-bronchoscopic brushings of children undergoing elective surgery [9]. To
address the question of whether the prototypic RSV A2
is representative of recent clinical isolates, we isolated 3
viruses, designated RSV BT2a, BT3a and BT4a, from
infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis, compared all
viruses genetically by sequencing their G genes, and
phenotypically by determining the consequences of
PBEC infection with each strain on both the cells and
the viruses. For most experiments, the clinical isolates
were passaged 3 times in HEp-2 cells to limit genetic
adaptation to in vitro conditions.
Surprisingly, we found that the prototypic A2 strain
infected PBECs more efficiently than the 3 clinical isolates and induced dramatic cytopathic effects (CPE),
whereas the clinical isolates caused limited CPE. Substantial differences in PBEC infectivity, virus growth kinetics
and chemokine secretions, such as interferon-inducible
protein 10 (IP-10/CXCL10), regulated upon activation,
normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES/CCL5),
interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8 (CXCL8), were also
observed.
These findings indicate that the use of RSV A2 in
host-pathogen interaction studies might not be representative of recent RSV clinical isolates in terms of virus
growth kinetics, CPE and chemokine induction. They
suggest that the choice of RSV strain for further studies
should be carefully considered, as recent RSV clinical
isolates might reflect more accurately RSV pathogenesis
in humans.

Materials and methods

Primary pediatric bronchial epithelial cells (PBECs)

Cell line and viruses

PBECS were obtained from children (1-11 years) undergoing elective surgery at the Royal Belfast Hospital for
Sick Children. Children were well and displayed no signs
of respiratory viral infection and were clinically free of
viral infections for at least one month prior to surgery.
Non-bronchoscopic bronchial brushings were performed
as previously described [9]. Before inclusion, all samples
were confirmed negative for a panel of 12 respiratory
viruses using a multiplex virus reverse transcriptase (RT)PCR strip, as previously described [10]. The cells were
seeded in collagen-coated (Purecol ® , Inamed) 10 cm 2
flasks (NUNC) using Airway Epithelial Cell Basal Medium
(C-21260) supplemented with Supplement Pack/Airway
Epithelial Growth Medium (C-39160) (Promocell medium) (Promocell) at 37°C in 5% CO2. Once confluent the
cells were passaged into a collagen-coated (Bovine collagen Purecol, INAMED Biomaterials) 75 cm2 flask and
expanded at 37°C in 5% CO2 until confluent.

HEp-2 cells (kindly supplied by Ralph Tripp, University
of Georgia) were cultured in DMEM Glutamax (GIBCO,
UK) and 10% FCS supplemented with 50 μg/mL Gentamicin. RSV A2 was kindly supplied by Geraldine Taylor
(Institute for Animal Health, UK). The clinical isolates,
designated RSV BT2a, BT3a, BT4a, were isolated from
infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis in the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children, following parental consent. Briefly, nasal aspirates were added to virus
transport medium (DMEM, 25 mM HEPES, 50 μg/ml
gentamicin, 0.22 M sucrose, 30 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml
fungizone), thoroughly vortexed, sonicated for 10 mins
in an ultrasonic water bath (Crest) and centrifugated at
440 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatants were aliquoted
and either snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or used
directly to inoculate HEp-2 cells, as described below.
The identity of each isolate was confirmed by a

Virus culture and growth curves

RSV BT2a, BT3a, BT4a and RSV A2 were cultured in
HEp-2 cells as previously described [11], except that
DMEM was the medium of choice. To minimize adaptation to HEp-2 cells, RSV BT2a, BT3a and BT4a stocks
used for most experiments were derived from three passages in HEp-2 cells, including the initial isolation,
before being used to infect the PBECs. Alternatively, to
study the consequences of adaptation to HEp-2 cells, a
stock of RSV BT2a was generated by passaging 14 times
in HEp-2 cells. RSV titers in virus stocks and biological
samples were determined as previously described [11],
except that DMEM was the medium of choice for virus
dilution and infection. Virus titers were calculated by
the method of Kärber [12] and reported as log10 tissue
culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50)/mL.
RSV G gene sequencing

Total viral RNA was extracted from passage 3 virus stocks
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and the G gene of each
isolate was amplified in a one-step RT-PCR reaction using
RSV G-specific primers (Fw: ACCTCAACATCTCACCATGC; Rev: AGAGTGAGACTGCAGCAAGG) (One
step RT-PCR Kit, Quigen). Amplicons were cloned into
pXL-TOPO plasmids using the pXL-TOPO cloning kit
(Invitrogen) and sequenced using M13 forward and
reverse primers, using a Big Dye Terminator v3.1 cycle
sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Use of all kits followed the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequence analyses
were performed using Clone Manager suite (Sci Ed Central) and DNA Star Lasergene 8 software (DNASTAR Inc).

PBEC infection

Expanded PBECs were seeded onto 24 well collagen
coated plates (5 × 104 cells/well) in Promocell medium
24 h before infection. RSV A2, BT2a, BT3a and BT4a
stocks were diluted in serum-free DMEM to generate multiplicities of infection (MOI) of 0.1 and 5 in 200 μL, which
was applied per well for 2 h at 37°C, 5% CO2. For uninfected controls, 200 μL of serum-free DMEM was added/
well. Cells infected at MOI 0.1 or 5 were cultured for
96 and 72 h post-infection (hpi), respectively, in 500 μL of
culture medium. Infected wells were monitored microscopically for cytopathic effects (CPE) (NIKON ECLIPSE
TE-2000 U), while others were fixed for immunofluorescence. Medium (250 μL) was collected at 2 hpi and every
24 hpi for cytokine/chemokine measurements. Cells were
scraped into the remaining 250 μL medium, harvested,
sonicated, centrifuged at 250 × g for 15 min, snap frozen
and stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent virus titration.
Immunofluoresence

PBECs were rinsed 3 x with 500 μL PBS. Paraformaldehyde (4% v/v) was added/well (500 μL) for 20 min and the
PBS washings were repeated. Cells were permeabilised
with PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 (v/v) (SIGMA) for 2 h at RT
and blocked with 10% non-immune normal goat serum
(Zymed, USA) for 30 min. The cultures were stained for
RSV F protein (mouse MAb clone 133-1H conjugated
with ALEXA 488, Chemicon). Briefly, 200 μL antibody
were added to the PBECs for 1 h at 37°C and the cultures
were washed 3 x with 500 μL PBS for 15 min at RT.
Nuclei were stained using DAPI-mounting medium (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories). Fluorescence was detected
by confocal laser scanning microscopy (TCS SP5 Leica).

Results
Subgroup and genotype analyses of the RSV clinical
isolates

The standardized multiplex viral RT-PCR strip [10] indicated that all clinical isolates belonged to RSV subgroup A.
This was confirmed by G gene sequencing. Alignments of
BT2a, BT3a and BT4a G protein sequences from amino
acid 212 to the end of the sequence, along with representatives from each subgroup A and B genotypes, using Clustal
2.0 software determined that the clinical isolates belonged
to genotypes GA5 (BT2a and BT4a) and GA2 (BT3a)
(Figure 1). In contrast, the prototypic A2 strain belongs to
genotype GA1.
RSV A2 induced more cytopathic effects (CPE) in PBECs
than the 3 clinical isolates

To determine the cytopathic consequence of infection
on PBECs, duplicate wells from the same donor were
infected with RSV A2, BT2a, BT3a, BT4a (n = 5 donors)
(MOI = 0.1 or 5) or mock-infected (n = 2 donors) and
monitored every 24 h thereafter by phase contrast

Cytokine/Chemokine titrations

Supernatant samples were thawed and analyzed for cytokine/chemokine concentrations using a custom Bio-Plex
assay (Bio-Rad, USA) targeting RANTES, IP-10, IL-6, IL-8
(CXCL8), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)
and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), using a
Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad).
Statistical analysis

All chemokine titration data were analyzed with repeated
measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test correction
for multiple comparisons using Graphpad Prism ® 5.0.
Statistical analyses of growth curves were analyzed with
area-under-the-curve measurements followed by a student’s paired t-test. Values are presented as the mean ±
SE. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.
Ethics

This study was approved by The Office for Research
Ethics Committees Northern Ireland (ORECNI). All

(from aa 212 to the end) was undertaken with Clustal 2.0 software.
Sequences were aligned with 9 reference sequences of the
subgroup A, including 7 genotypes and the A2 and Long strains.
Subgroup B was represented by sequences representative of 5
genotypes. The phylogenic tree was designed using the maximum
parsimony algorithm and was drawn with Mega 4.0 software using
PHYLIP method. The tree was rooted between subgroups A and B.

microscopy. At MOI = 0.1, RSV A2 infection was characterized by large syncytia formation, cell rounding and
extensive monolayer disruption over time (Figure 2). In
contrast, RSV BT2a and, to a lesser extent, BT3a infection resulted in some cell rounding and limited monolayer disruption. However, there was no evidence of
syncytium formation in these cells. Interestingly, RSV
BT4a-infected PBECs and mock-infected controls were
indistinguishable in terms of CPE. Similar data were
obtained following infection at MOI = 5, albeit, where
evident, the CPE induction was faster compared to the
CPE induction following infection at MOI = 0.1 (data
not shown).

clinical isolates (p < 0.05), with the exception of BT4a at
MOI 5. Average RSV A2 titers peaked at 5.25 and 5.70
log10 TCID50/ml for MOIs of 0.1 and 5, respectively. In
comparison, peak average titers for RSV BT2a, BT3a
and BT4a after infection were 4.20, 3.80 and 3.25 log10
TCID 50 /ml at MOI = 0.1, respectively, and 5.00, 4.75
and 3.45 log 10 TCID 50 /ml at MOI = 5, respectively.
These relatively high titers, especially for BT2a and
BT3a at MOI = 5, were unexpected and inconsistent
with the observed CPE and infectivity data for each of
these viruses.

Differential infectivity between RSV A2 and the clinical
isolates

As a prototypic strain, RSV A2 is likely to have been
passaged many times in vitro in continuous cell monolayers and adapted to these conditions. To address
whether multiple passaging in vitro might explain the
differential growth kinetics between RSV A2 and the
clinical isolates, RSV BT2a was blindly passaged 14
times in HEp-2 cells. The resultant virus stock (BT2a
P.14) was infected onto PBEC cultures (n = 3), in parallel with the passage 3 stock (BT2a P.3) and RSV A2,
each at an MOI of 0.1. Samples were harvested at 2, 24,
48, 72 and 96 hpi and virus titers determined (Figure 5).
As expected, area-under-the-curves were significantly
higher for A2 compared to the BT2a P.3 (p = 0.0122).
However, there were no significant differences between
the growth curves of BT2a P.3 and P.14 stocks (p =
0.2768). Therefore, serial passaging of the RSV clinical
isolate, at least to passage 14, is unlikely to explain the
differential growth kinetics and, by extension, the cytopathogenesis of the prototypic RSV A2 strain and the
clinical isolates.

To determine whether the differential CPE between RSV
A2 and the clinical isolates was due to their respective
capacities to infect PBECs, infected monolayers (MOI =
0.1) were stained for RSV F protein expression. Representative en-face micrographs are presented in Figure 3.
Consistent with the CPE data, most cells were positive
for RSV F protein by 72 hpi with RSV A2, indicating
extensive infection and efficient virus propagation. In
contrast, but also consistent with the CPE data, few cells
were infected with the RSV clinical isolates, with BT2a
and BT4a the most and least infectious, respectively.
RSV A2 and the clinical isolates have differential growth
kinetics in PBECs

To address the relative growth kinetics of each virus,
PBEC monolayers (n = 5) were inoculated with each
RSV strain at MOIs of 0.1 and 5 to establish multistep
and one-step growth curves, respectively. Samples were
harvested at several time points post-infection, beginning at 2 h. As expected, RSV A2 grew faster and to
higher titers following infection at both MOIs than the
clinical isolates (Figure 4), while area-under-the-curves
were also significantly higher for A2 compared to the

isolate infection on their expression, supernatants
from RSV-infected (MOI = 0.1) (n = 6) and control
cultures (n = 2) were screened for a number of analytes at
24, 72 and 96 hpi. The analytes were chosen because they

were either previously associated with RSV disease or had
biological properties consistent with RSV pathogenesis
[13-17]. Interestingly, there was a trend towards increased
concentrations of RANTES, IP-10, IL-6, and IL-8 over time
post-infection, irrespective of the virus strain used, compared to mock-infected controls (Figure 6). At 24 hpi with
any RSV strain, there was no evidence of upregulation of
any analyte. By 72 hpi, mean IP-10, IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations were increased, irrespective of the RSV strains
used, although these increases were not statistically significant. By 96 hpi, however, IP-10, in particular, and RANTES
were highly upregulated in supernatants from RSV A2infected cultures compared to both mock- and RSV clinical
isolate-infected cultures. While mean IP-10 and RANTES
concentrations at 96 hpi in supernatants from cultures
infected with the clinical isolates were increased relative to
mock-infected cultures, this did not reach significance.

Discussion
Our work sought to address whether the prototypic RSV
strain A2 was representative of recent RSV clinical isolates
in terms of cytopathogenesis, infectivity, virus growth
kinetics, and pro-inflammatory immune responses. As
human airway epithelial cells are the primary targets of
RSV infection in vivo, we addressed our hypothesis using
PBEC monolayers. Our data provided convincing evidence
that the prototypic A2 strain demonstrated more cytopathogenicity than the clinical isolates in relation to each
parameter tested and, consequently, is poorly representative of them under the experimental conditions outlined.
The mechanisms responsible for this differential cytopathogenicity remain to be elucidated and are the subject
of ongoing research.
As a prototypic strain, RSV A2 has been extensively
passaged in vitro in continuous cell lines, such as HEp2. In contrast, the clinical isolates have not. RSV A2
would therefore be expected to be better adapted to
replication in HEp-2 cells than the clinical isolates.
Indeed, virus stock titers generated in HEp-2 cells were
invariably higher for RSV A2 than for the clinical isolates (data not shown). In contrast, because of their low
passage in vitro, we expected the clinical isolates to be
better adapted than RSV A2 to the PBEC cultures. Consequently, the fact that RSV A2 infected these cells
more efficiently and caused considerably more CPE than
the recent clinical isolates was unexpected.
The different growth curve slopes between RSV A2 and
the clinical isolates, particularly at early time points, are
consistent with differential receptor usage between these
viruses. Numerous studies have identified heparan sulfate
(HS) as essential for RSV entry into continuous cell lines
[18-24]. Indeed, HS is found on several different mammalian cell lines and on undifferentiated/monolayer
PBECs [25,26]. Efficient infectivity of RSV A2 in our
PBEC model is consistent with these reports. In contrast,
HS appears to be only present on basal cells in bronchial
tissues or in well-differentiated (WD) PBECs, but is not
found on apical cells [26,27]. As RSV infection is
restricted to apical cells in vivo and in WD-PBECs
[28-32], HS is unlikely to function as an RSV receptor in
vivo. By extension, use of HS as a receptor for RSV is
likely to be an in vitro artifact, to which the clinical isolates have not, or only poorly, adapted in limited passages
on HEp-2 cells. Indeed, a relatively low binding affinity to
HS might explain the limited infectivity of the clinical
isolates in our PBEC model. Experiments are ongoing to
address receptor usage, including heparinase treatment
of PBEC cultures prior to infection.
It was possible that multiple passaging of RSV A2 in
monolayer cells resulted in cell adaptation, thereby
explaining the differential infectivity between A2 and
the clinical isolates. However, our data did not support

Page 7 of 9

this hypothesis, as multiple passaging of RSV BT2a on
HEp-2 cells did not substantially alter its phenotype in
terms of growth kinetics. It is important to point out,
however, that RSV BT2a was passaged blindly. Thus,
there was no intentional selection for any phenotypic
traits, such as plaque size, that might be expected to
alter the virus’ characteristics. Alternatively, passaging
RSV BT2a 14 times might be insufficient to induce or
detect altered phenotypes.
The mean concentrations of IP-10 induced following
RSV A2 infection of PBECs were remarkably similar to
those reported in intubated children with RSV bronchiolitis [16]. Mean IP-10 induction following infection with
the clinical isolates was considerably lower than with A2
but was elevated, although not significantly, in most
individuals compared to mock-infected controls. These
data indicate that bronchial epithelial cells are a source
of IP-10 following RSV infection and suggest that it may
be implicated in RSV pathogenesis. Like IP-10, the levels
of RANTES secretion following PBEC infection were
clearly RSV strain-dependent. The induction of high
RANTES levels following RSV A2 infection of PBECs is
consistent with previous studies in vitro in monolayers
[13,14,33]. Elevated RANTES levels were also reported
in infants hospitalized with RSV infections [13,16,34].
However, the limited RANTES secretion following
PBEC infection with the RSV clinical isolates contrasts
with these in vitro and in vivo data. Our data suggest
that the efficiency with which the RSV strains infect and
replicate in PBECs dictates the level of secretion of
RANTES. Alternatively, if the clinical isolates are considered more representative of RSV infection in humans
than RSV A2, our data may be reconciled by the possibility that bronchial epithelial cells are not the principle
source of RANTES in RSV-infected individuals.
IL-8 is a potent neutrophil chemoattractant that was
previously shown to be secreted following RSV infection
in vitro [13-15]. In our model, there was a general trend
towards increased IL-8 secretion following PBEC infection, irrespective of the virus strain used. However, high
IL-8 secretions from mock infected PBECs rendered
these increases non-significant in most cases. The high
IL-8 expression in mock-infected cultures is consistent
with studies in monolayers derived from nasal explants
[13] or primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells
[35]. The reasons for elevated IL-8 expression in these
primary cultures are not clear. Interestingly, Chang et al
demonstrated a dose effect of all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA) on IL-8 expression [35]. However, relative to
cultures grown in the absence of ATRA, there was no
increased IL-8 stimulation evident at doses similar to
those used in our PBEC growth medium.
Like IL-8, there were strong trends towards increased
IL-6 and TRAIL secretion in RSV-infected PBECs.

Villenave et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:43
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/43

However, considerable variability among individuals prevented these responses reaching significance. Similarly,
there was little or no evidence of RSV strain-dependence on the secretion of these analytes. These data
contrast with previous reports in which RSV infection of
monolayers resulted in increased IL-6 expression
[13,14,33], while work by Bem et al suggested that
TRAIL might contribute to lung epithelial injury in children with severe RSV infection [17]. Like TRAIL, VEGF
is a cytokine associated with RSV or rhinovirus infection
in airway bronchial cells grown in monolayer [36] and
has been detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from children hospitalized with severe RSV infection [37]. However, unlike TRAIL and IL-6, in our model, VEGF was
secreted at similar levels in both infected and uninfected
PBEC cultures. Thus, conclusions regarding a role for
IL-6, TRAIL and VEGF in RSV pathogenesis are not
possible from the current study.
In conclusion, our data highlight the dramatic cytopathic differences between 3 recent clinical isolates and
a prototypic RSV strain in a PBEC infection model.
They thereby emphasize the fact that RSV A2 is not
necessarily representative of these isolates. Consequently, our findings suggest that the choice of RSV
strain may have important implications for future studies on RSV pathogenesis and our understanding of the
molecular mechanisms thereof.

Authors’ contributions
RV generated most of the data for the manuscript and co-wrote the paper.
DOD developed the PBEC monolayer model of RSV infection, recruited
patients and collected clinical samples, isolated and performed the initial
characterization of the clinical RSV strains. ST recruited patients and collected
clinical samples. OT was responsible for the molecular characterization of
some of the RSV clinical isolates. GS and LHG co-designed and conceived
the study and helped with data analyses. JPM supervised the clinical and
bronchial sampling aspects of the study and the study feasibility. PVC input
to study design and was responsible for the screening of all patients for viral
infections. MDS co-designed and conceived the study, obtained research
ethics and institutional governance permission, designed and co-supervised
the clinical aspects of the study, and helped with data analyses. UFP codesigned, conceived and coordinated the study, and co-wrote the paper. All
authors read and approved the final manuscript.
