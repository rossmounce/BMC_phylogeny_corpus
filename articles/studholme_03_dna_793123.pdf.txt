Abstract
Background: The transition metal molybdenum is essential for life. Escherichia coli imports this
metal into the cell in the form of molybdate ions, which are taken up via an ABC transport system.
In E. coli and other Proteobacteria molybdenum metabolism and homeostasis are regulated by the
molybdate-responsive transcription factor ModE.
Results: Orthologues of ModE are widespread amongst diverse prokaryotes, but not ubiquitous.
We identified probable ModE-binding sites upstream of genes implicated in molybdenum
metabolism in green sulphur bacteria and methanogenic Archaea as well as in Proteobacteria. We
also present evidence of horizontal transfer of nitrogen fixation genes between green sulphur
bacteria and methanogenic Archaea.
Conclusions: Whereas most of the archaeal helix-turn-helix-containing transcription factors
belong to families that are Archaea-specific, ModE is unusual in that it is found in both Archaea and
Bacteria. Moreover, its cognate upstream DNA recognition sequence is also conserved between
Archaea and Bacteria, despite the fundamental differences in their core transcription machinery.
ModE is the third example of a transcriptional regulator with a binding signal that is conserved in
Bacteria and Archaea.

Background
The transition metal molybdenum is essential for life on
earth. It is at the catalytic centre of over 30 enzymes, which
are involved in the nitrogen, carbon, and sulphur cycles
[1]. Molybdenum is found in the nitrogenase complex,
which fixes dinitrogen gas, and in nitrate reductase, which
reduces nitrate to nitrite. Other molybdo-proteins include
xanthine oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, formate dehydrogenase, sulphite oxidase, nitrite reductase, DMSO reductase,
pyridoxal dehydrogenase, xanthine dehydrogenase, and
pyrogallol transhydrolase.

Molybdenum is available to organisms in the form of the
tetraoxyanion molybdate, which is transported into
Escherichia coli cells by an ABC-type transport system
encoded by the modABCD operon [2]. A ModE-molybdate
complex binds specific DNA target sequences and thus
represses or activates transcription of several operons in
response to molybdate concentration. The ModE protein
from E. coli consists of two domains [3]. At the N terminus
is the DNA-binding domain (Pfam accession PF02573,
HTH_9) containing a winged helix-turn-helix (HTH)
motif. At the C-terminal end is the molybdate-binding

domain (Pfam accession PF03459, TOBE), which consists
of two sub-domains of OB-folds with exchanging C-terminal strands. In E. coli, ModE bound to molybdate has been
shown to contribute to the regulation of modABCD [4],
napFDAGHBC [5], moaABCDE [6], and dmsABC operons
[7]. These operons encode proteins involved in molybdenum homeostasis and metabolism.
Homologues of ModE are known in γ-Proteobacteria (e.g.
E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae) and α-Proteobacteria (e.g.
Rhodobacter capsulatus). Now that over 100 complete
genome sequences are available, we wished to discover
whether this regulatory system is found more widely in
organisms other than Proteobacteria and whether we
could gain any insights into the evolution of the molybdenum regulon.

Results and Discussion
Taxonomic distribution of ModE homologues and protein
domain organisation of their sequences
Probable orthologues of the molybdenum-responsive regulator ModE were found in several Proteobacteria as well
as in the green sulphur bacterium Chlorobium tepidum.
Sequence analysis using Pfam [9] revealed that these proteins contained the HTH_9 domain at the N terminus and
two TOBE sub-domains at the C terminus (Figure 2A). In
most cases, only a single ModE homologue was found in
each complete genome sequence. However, in the α-proteobacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus, there are two ModE
homologues. One is associated with molybdate transport
genes in the operon modEABC, whilst the second homologue is encoded by modE2, located upstream of vnfA2, the
gene encoding one of two homologues of the nitrogenase
regulatory protein, VnfA. The methanogenic Archaea
Methanosarcina mazei and M. acetivorans each encode a
protein that resembles ModE, but has only one rather
than two C-terminal TOBE sub-domains (Figure 2B). No
orthologues of ModE were found in the complete genome
sequences from other lineages, such as the Gram-positive
Bacteria and Cyanobacteria.

Several other Bacteria and Archaea encode proteins that
contain the HTH_9 domain characteristic of ModE, but
completely lack a molybdate-binding TOBE domain.
Examples include Q9RBF7, Q8XXM1 (RSC2092), and
Q8ZZY3 (PAE0019) from Alcaligenes eutropha, Ralstonia
solanacearum, and Pyrobaculum aerophilum respectively. In
these proteins, rather than a TOBE domain, there is a
domain at the C terminus that is homologous to the
SBP_bac_1 family (Pfam accession PF01547). Members
of this family [8] bind diverse solutes such as sugars, peptides, and inorganic ions. In Alcaligenes eutropha, Q9RBF7
(FdsR) has been shown to regulate the fdsGBACD operon,
which encodes the soluble NAD+ linked formate dehydrogenase molybdo-enzyme [10]. Based on similarity

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/3/24

between the C-terminal domain of FdsR and a domain of
formate dehydrogenase, Oh and Bowien [10] proposed
that this C-terminal domain binds formate, thus modulating DNA-binding activity.
In Bacteria and Archaea, transcriptional regulators containing a HTH exhibit a position-function correlation
such that repressors and dual function repressors/activators tend to have the HTH-containing domain at the N terminus whilst activators tend to have the HTH at the C
terminus [11,12]. ModE can act as both a repressor and an
activator. Consistent with this, ModE and the other proteins described above, the HTH_9 domain occurs at the N
terminus. In contrast to this arrangement, Q9PMF6
(Cj1507c) from Campylobacter jejuni has an HTH_9
domain at the N terminus (Figure 2D). This suggests that
it might be a transcriptional activator rather than a repressor. Intriguingly the Cj1507c ORF overlaps fdhD encoding
the molybdo-enzyme formate dehydrogenase (Cj1508c),
strongly suggesting a functional link between this regulatory protein and molybdenum metabolism.
Interestingly several Bacteria and Archaea encode proteins
that consist of just the HTH_9 domain, and lack any recognisable molybdate- or other solute-binding domains
(Figure 2E). Examples are found in several Archaea and
also in Salmonella typhimurium and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. These proteins would certainly not be functional for
binding molybdate, but the HTH domain is probably
capable of binding DNA and perhaps forming multimeric
protein complexes.
Conservation of DNA-recognition elements in ModE
homologues
The HTH_9 domain of ModE is responsible for its
sequence-specific DNA-binding activity. According to the
model proposed by Hall et al. [3] based on the threedimensional crystal structure of ModE, nine amino acid
residues in the HTH directly interact with the target DNA
and have a role in sequence-recognition: Ser35, Gln36,
Lys39, Ser44, Tyr45, Lys46, Ser47, Trp49, and Asp50
(numbering as in [3]). Interestingly, most of these residues were moderately conserved, even between phylogenetically distant organisms (see alignment in Figure 1).
This suggested that the cognate target sequences recognised by these proteins might also be conserved. Therefore
we decided to investigate the occurrence of potential
ModE-binding sites in a range of prokaryotic genome
sequences.
Identification of ModE-binding sites in genomic DNA
sequence
The consensus ModE-recognition sequence has dyad symmetry and can be approximately represented as
atCGcTATATAN6TATATAaCGat [5]. As a first step to fully

Alignment of the helix-turn-helix (HTH) domains homologous to the molybdenum-responsive transcriptional regulator ModE.
Amino acid residues predicted to directly interact with the target DNA are marked with asterisks (*). The alignment was taken
from the Pfam database http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/.

characterising the set of target sequences for this family of
transcription factors, we constructed an alignment (Figure
3) of several known and probable ModE-binding sites
from γ-Proteobacteria, also illustrated as a sequence logo
in Figure 4. Using a position-dependent weight matrix
derived from this alignment (Figure 5), we scanned the
protein-coding and non-coding regions of a range of complete genomes to find matches to the canonical ModEbinding DNA sequence motif. The results of these
searches are summarised in Tables 1 [see Additional File
3], 2, and 3. It is important to remember that the mere
presence of DNA sequence similarity to a consensus is not
sufficient to demonstrate a biologically significant protein-binding site; in other words this approach of scanning DNA sequence against a weight matrix model will
inevitably yield some false-positives. For example, several
high-scoring matches were found within protein-coding
regions in most of the genomes that we examined; these
intragenic sites are unlikely to be functional regulatory
sites. Furthermore, many of the intergenic matches fell
upstream of genes not obviously involved in molybde-

num metabolism and therefore probably not subject to
regulation by ModE.
However, notwithstanding the occurrence of some falsepositives, we are confident that our method had some discriminatory value in identifying bona fide ModE-binding
sites because of the high proportion of the matches that
did fall upstream of molybdenum-linked genes. Despite
the importance of molybdenum-dependent processes, relatively few bacterial genes are directly involved in molybdenum metabolism: certainly no more than a few percent
of the genome. Nevertheless, a disproportionately high
number of our identified matches were located
immediately upstream of genes implicated in molybdenum metabolism. For example in E. coli K12, we found a
total of 26 high-scoring matches to the ModE-binding
consensus (Table 3). Of these 26 sites, 17 occurred in noncoding DNA. Five of these 17 sites were located upstream
of genes or operons associated with molybdenum metabolism or molybdo-enzymes (Table 1 [see Additional File
3]). In some cases, these ratios were more impressive: for
example in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Bradyrhizobium

japonicum, Chlorobium tepidum, Mesorhizobium loti and Ralstonia solanacearum, at least 50% of the intergenic matches
were located immediately upstream of molybdenumassociated genes (Table 3). The frequent occurrence of
these ModE operator-like sequences upstream of molybdenum-associated genes is consistent with their being biologically significant rather than mere coincidence.
As expected, we found good matches to the proposed consensus ModE binding sequence immediately upstream of
genes implicated in molybdenum metabolism in the γproteobacterial genomes. For example, high-scoring sites
were detected upstream of homologues of modA, moeA,
dmsA, and napF in E. coli and Salmonella species, which
correspond to ModE-binding sites. Additional good candidate sites were found upstream of yecK in both E. coli

We observed some differences in the repertoires of predicted ModE-binding sites between the closely related
strains of enteric bacteria (E. coli, Yersinia pestis, Shigella
flexneri, and Salmonella enterica). There appears to be a
core ModE-dependent regulon consisting of the dmsABC,
moaABCDE, modABCD and napFDAGHBC operons, the
only exception being that there is no apparent ModE
binding site associated with dmsABC in Y. pestis. Additionally, yecK also has a putative upstream ModE binding site
in E. coli and S. flexneri; yecK appears to be absent from S.
enterica and Y. pestis. Furthermore, in S. enterica a second
dms operon also has sites, whilst Y. pestis has additional
sites upstream of pflA and narP. These differences in the
predicted ModE-dependent regulon between closely
related species suggest some evolutionary plasticity in the
regulon. We also observed clear differences between the
close relatives Haemophilus influenzae and H. ducreyi, the
latter lacking a ModE homologue and lacking conserved
ModE operator-like sites upstream of its mod operon.
Our data show that probable ModE-binding sites were
found upstream of modA homologues not only in enteric
bacteria and H. influenzae as has been previously established, but also in A. tumefaciens, Helicobacter hepaticus, M.
loti, Pasteurella multocida, several Pseudomonas strains, R.
solanacearum and Shewanellla oneidensis. This indicates
that ModE-dependent regulation of the molybdate ABC
transporter is widespread amongst proteobacteria.
Interestingly, we found strong potential ModE-binding
sites upstream of modA (involved in molybdate transport)
and napA (encoding a molybdenum-containing nitrate
reductase) in the ε-proteobacterium Helicobacter hepaticus
(but not in its close relatives H. pylori and Campylobacter
jejuni). The complete genome sequence of H. hepaticus
does not encode a full-length ModE homologue; it does
encode a 135 amino acid protein (HH0653), consisting of
a single HTH_9 domain, which is therefore probably able
to specifically bind to the identified sites. However, since
it lacks a molybdate-binding TOBE domain, it cannot
directly use molybdenum availability to modulate DNAbinding activity. Interestingly, a potential ModE-binding
site is also observed upstream of HH0158, predicted to
encode a molydenum-containing periplasmic nitrate
reductase in H. hepaticus.
A similar scenario is observed in Agrobacterium tumefaciens. A ModE-binding site is found upstream of modA but
A. tumefaciens has no full-length ModE homologue, only
a 131 amino acid protein (ATU2654, Q8UCD4)

consisting of a HTH_9 domain. It is possible that the
ModE-dependent regulatory system is in a process of
degeneration in these organisms. However, it is equally
possible that these proteins are functional and that DNAbinding is modulated by protein-protein interaction with
some unknown factor or factors.
Strikingly, we also found a good candidate ModE-binding
sites associated with molybdenum metabolism in some
more distantly related organisms. One striking example
was a site upstream of an open reading frame (CT1544)
annotated as a probable periplasmic molybdenum-binding protein component of a molybdenum ABC transporter complex in the green sulphur bacterium C. tepidum
[14]. This suggested that the full-length orthologue of
ModE (CT1543, Q8KC82) functions in regulation of
molybdenum transport in C. tepidum in a similar manner
to ModE in E. coli.
The genome of C. tepidum [14] has at least three loci that
contain genes implicated in molybdenum homeostasis
and metabolism. The first of these loci includes a mod
transport system and genes involved in synthesis of the
molybdopterin genes cofactor, moaCBmoeEmobBAmoaA.
A second includes CT1765, encoding a homologue of the
ModG molybindin of Azotobacter vinelandii that binds

molybdate. CT1765 has been misleadingly annotated as a
molybdopterin-binding protein, as have most other
molybdate-binding proteins in the public databases. It is
probably involved in molybdate homeostasis. The third
locus includes moaCB, moeE, mobBA, moaA and the nif
genes that encode nitrogenase. Structural genes for the
nitrogenase system in C. tepidum most closely resemble
those of the Archaea rather than those of other nitrogenfixing bacteria [14]. This raises the question of horizontal
transfer between Bacteria and Archaea. However, a strong
candidate σ54-dependent promoter is located upstream of
C. tepidum nifH [15], which encodes the nitrogenase. σ54dependent transcription of nitrogenase genes is common
among Proteobacteria, but σ54 is not found in Archaea.
Taken together, the σ54-dependent promoter and the
ModE binding site centred just upstream of CT1544 suggest that the regulation of nitrogenase in C. tepidum shares
much in common with that in Proteobacteria such as A.
vinelandii. Does this tell us anything about the direction of
horizontal transfer of nitrogen-fixation genes between
Archaea and green sulphur bacteria? If the green sulphur
bacteria acquired nitrogen-fixing genes from an archaeon,
then this would imply that the recruitment of σ54 to the
regulation of nitrogen fixation has occurred at least twice
independently. The alternative, and more likely, scenario

is that the Archaea acquired nitrogen-fixation genes from
a relative of the green sulphur bacteria.
Even more striking was our finding that good candidate
ModE-binding sites occur immediately upstream of several genes implicated in molybdenum metabolism in the
methanogenic Archaea (Table 2). For example, we found
high-scoring matches to ModE-binding sites in Meth-

anosarcina acetivorans upstream of modA and fmdE, which
encodes a molybdenum-containing hydrogenase. We also
found sites upstream of vnfH and nifI1, implicated in
nitrogen-fixation. MA1213 (vnfH) is annotated as an ironcontaining nitrogenase, VnfH [16]. However, examination of this sequence suggests that it is more likely to be a
molybdenum-containing nitrogenase [17]. The predicted
ModE-binding site upstream of fmdE is also conserved in

Methanosarcina mazei. Therefore it is possible that the
ModE-like proteins Q8PWN4 and Q8TTZ2 from Methanosarcina mazei and Methanosarcina acetivorans respectively are functional for molybdate-responsive regulation
of these molybdo-enzymes.

Methods

Conclusions

Domain architectures were inferred from protein
sequences using Pfam [9] release 10.0.

Transcriptional regulation of molybdo-enzymes, and
genes involved in molybdenum metabolism and homeostasis, is performed by the molybdate-responsive transcription factor ModE in E. coli and related Proteobacteria. We
found that homologues of ModE are also found in the
green sulphur bacterium C. tepidum, and in methanogenic
Archaea. Moreover, we found that its cognate DNA recognition element is also highly conserved even between Bacteria and Archaea. As far as we are aware this is only the
third report of a regulatory DNA element whose sequence
appears to be conserved in bacteria and Archaea. The
other two examples are the regulator of biotin metabolism, BirA [18], and the metal dependent regulator
MDR1/DtxR [24].
Although the basal transcription apparatus in Archaea is
similar to eukaryotic RNAPII rather than to bacterial
RNAP, the emerging view is that Archaea use a varied repertoire of regulatory mechanisms that includes both
eukaryal and bacterial paradigms (e.g. [19-22]). Archaea
contain large numbers of HTH-containing domains,
which are more similar to bacterial HTH domains rather
than to eukaryotic proteins [23]. However, most of the
Archaeal HTH-containing proteins form Archaea-specific
families [23] and so the archaeal and bacterial HTH
domains may share very ancient common origins [11].
The high-affinity molybdate transport system, which has
a small size and simple organisation, may have a very
ancient origin. The fact that the ModE regulon is
conserved across large phylogenetic distances also suggests an ancient common origin followed by loss in multiple lineages rather than multiple transfer events. This

may be further supported by the observation of partially
degenerated ModE regulatory systems in bacteria such as
A. tumefaciens and H. hepaticus.

Matches to ModE-binding sites were identified in noncoding regions of complete genome sequences using a
standard position-specific weight matrix scoring
approach. A frequency matrix was generated from the
alignment of known binding site sequences using the
make_matrix.pl script [see Additional File 2]. This matrix
contained the relative frequencies of each base being
found at each position in the alignment (see Figure 5).
The matrix can be considered to be a statistical model of
the DNA sequence motif. Another way of visualising the
DNA sequence motif is as a sequence logo [25] as in Figure 4.
Matches to this DNA motif were detected in a genome
sequence by the following method. The entire genome
sequence was scanned such that every window of 28 bases
was assigned a score using the matrix and the promscan.pl
script [see Additional File 1]. This score, known as the
Kullback-Leibler distance, reflects the theoretical binding
energy of the DNA protein interaction [26] and is calculated using the formula in Figure 6. The maximum possible score for a window, i.e. that given by a perfect match
to the consensus, differs slightly from genome to genome
according to percentage G+C content. Therefore, all scores
were normalised such that 100 is the highest possible
score for a 28 base window, and the scores were rounded
to the nearest integer. Incidentally, we would expect a site
scoring 100 only once in about 7.2 × 1016 bases of random
DNA sequence (assuming 50 G+C content), so it is
perhaps not surprising that no sites were found to have a
score of 100.

Table 3: Frequencies of matches to the ModE-binding consensus in several complete genomes. The number of sites scoring greater than
75 for similarity to the ModE-binding consensus was counted for each of the complete genome sequences. Note that the consensus
sequence is a nearly palindromic, so only sites on on one strand were counted. Matches were designated intragenic if the center of the
28 base site was located within a protein-coding region and intergenic otherwise.
