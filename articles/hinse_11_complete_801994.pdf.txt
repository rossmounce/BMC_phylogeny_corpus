Abstract
Background: Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is an important causative agent of infectious endocarditis,
while the pathogenicity of this species is widely unclear. To gain insight into the pathomechanisms and the
underlying genetic elements for lateral gene transfer, we sequenced the entire genome of this pathogen.
Results: We sequenced the whole genome of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strain ATCC BAA-2069, consisting of
a 2,356,444 bp circular DNA molecule with a G+C-content of 37.65% and a novel 20,765 bp plasmid designated as
pSGG1. Bioinformatic analysis predicted 2,309 ORFs and the presence of 80 tRNAs and 21 rRNAs in the
chromosome. Furthermore, 21 ORFs were detected on the plasmid pSGG1, including tetracycline resistance genes
telL and tet(O/W/32/O). Screening of 41 S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates revealed one plasmid (pSGG2)
homologous to pSGG1. We further predicted 21 surface proteins containing the cell wall-sorting motif LPxTG,
which were shown to play a functional role in the adhesion of bacteria to host cells. In addition, we performed a
whole genome comparison to the recently sequenced S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strain UCN34, revealing
significant differences.
Conclusions: The analysis of the whole genome sequence of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus promotes
understanding of genetic factors concerning the pathogenesis and adhesion to ECM of this pathogen. For the first
time we detected the presence of the mobilizable pSGG1 plasmid, which may play a functional role in lateral gene
transfer and promote a selective advantage due to a tetracycline resistance.

Background
Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (formerly
known as S. bovis biotype I) is a gram-positive bacterium belonging to the Lancefield Group D streptococci.
Over the last ten years, the classification of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus has been revised several times
[1-4]. S. bovis was previously divided into three biotypes,
designated as biotype I, biotype II/1, and biotype II/2.
The majority of isolates associated with human endocarditis have been assigned to biotype I, which was recently
reclassified as Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus [5]. Furthermore, S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is

a common member of the microflora and appears in
approximately 2.5 to 15% of the gastrointestinal tract of
healthy human [6,7]. It is an opportunistic human
pathogen which can cause several bacterial infections,
including septicemia and endocarditis. Over the last few
years, the percentage of cases of endocarditis caused by
group D streptococci has significantly increased [8-10].
Recently, Russel et al. estimated that S. gallolyticus
subsp. gallolyticus is the causative agent in 24% of streptococcal endocarditis cases [11]. In addition, several studies present strong correlations between appearance of
colon neoplasms and S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus
infection [7,12], while the underlying pathomechanisms
are still unknown. Sillanpää et al. suggest that premalignant and malignant lesions in the intestinal tract could
facilitate translocation of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus through the disrupted mucosal barrier and provide

access to blood circulation [13]. Furthermore, studies
have suggested a linkage between inflammation by S.
bovis and colon carcinogenesis [14]. In addition, a variety of animal infections, such as mastitis, septicemia in
poultry, lactic acidosis and infections of various ruminant animals are caused by S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus [15-17]. However, the exact pathomechanisms of S.
gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus or S. bovis infections
remain unclear.
S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus shares its environment with numerous other potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as S. agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis or
others. This implies the possibility of horizontal gene
transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes or genomic
islands, e.g. phage-related clusters, by transposons, plasmids or phages, within the human gut or the animal
rumen [18]. Several studies have reported the occurrence of competence-stimulating peptides in S. bovis
[19]. These factors facilitate the acquisition of novel
genes, resistance islands or virulence-associated regions
[20], in particular when several species coexist within
biofilms [21]. Recently we were able to show the capability of biofilm formation on polystyrene surfaces for
S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus [22]. Nevertheless, most
of the mechanisms of transfer and insertion are poorly
understood [23,24].
In vitro studies have demonstrated the adhesion and
invasion of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus to extracellular matrix proteins [22,25], virulence associated proteins [13,26,27], as well as EA.hy926 or HUVEC cells
[22]. Furthermore, studies have addressed biosynthesis
of capsular polysaccharides [28] and fimbriae-like structures on the bacterial surface in S. gallolyticus subsp.
gallolyticus [29]. It has been demonstrated that S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus has 11 cell wall-anchored proteins with “microbial surface component recognizing
matrix molecules” (MSCRAMM) characteristics, including a collagen-binding adhesin and proteins with similarities to pilus subunits [13].
Recently, Rusinok et al. published the first whole genome sequence of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strain
UCN34 and analyzed the main metabolic and cell surface features, particularly with regard to adaptation to
the rumen and the virulence association of polysaccharide capsule, glucan mucopolysaccharides, different types
of pili and collagen binding proteins [30].
Here we present the whole genome sequence of a not
described, considerably divergent S. gallolyticus subsp.
gallolyticus strain. The strain under study was the tetracycline resistant strain ATCC BAA-2069, isolated from
a patient with infectious endocarditis. We demonstrate
the occurrence of a previously undescribed plasmid
(pSGG1) which carries genes for tetracycline resistance
(tetL, tet(O/W/32/O)) and reveals strong sequence

similarities to plasmids and chromosomes from several
ruminal and gastrointestinal bacteria, indicating that
pSGG1 may act as a native carrier for horizontal gene
transfer.

Results
General genome properties

The whole genome sequence of S. gallolyticus subsp.
gallolyticus was determined by pyrosequencing using the
454 GS FLX Titanium technique (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany) and, after assembly of the 454 reads, remaining gaps were closed by PCR and conventional Sanger
sequencing. The genome contains a 2,356,444 bp circular DNA molecule with a G+C-content of 37.65% and a
previously undescribed 20,765 bp plasmid designated as
pSGG1. Mapping of gene set was performed against S.
gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus genome UCN34 (GenBank Acc. No.: FN597254) [30]. Bioinformatic analysis
predicted 2,309 open reading frames (ORFs), the presence of 80 tRNAs and 21 rRNAs in the chromosome,
as well as 21 ORFs on the plasmid pSGG1.
The size of the BAA-2069 circular chromosome
(2,356,444 bp) exceeds the average of other previously
published streptococcal genomes by 12% (mean: 2.1 mb;
n = 15) (Table 1, Figure 1). Direct comparison shows
that only the S. sanguinis SK36 genome is larger
(2,388,435 bp), and the G+C-content is 1.7% lower than
average (range from 35.3 to 43.4%; n = 15). Altogether
2,309 ORFs were automatically annotated, which is 10%
higher than the average of all complete sequenced Streptococcus genomes (2,107 ORFs). In direct comparison to
the S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus genome UCN34,
the BAA-2069 genome is 5.5 kb larger (2,356,444 to
2,350,911 bp), has 70 fewer CDS (2,309 to 2,239) and
contains the 20,765 bp plasmid pSGG1.
The sequences and annotations of chromosome and
plasmid have been deposited at the NCBI GenBank
(Acc. No. FR824043, FR824044).
Comparative genomics

In a direct comparison of genome BAA-2069 to UCN34,
we noted various ORFs and regions inserted or deleted
scattered along the genomes; nonetheless the majority
of genetic information is shared by both strains. The
BAA-2069 genome contains 2040 (87%) ORFs which are
predicted to be common in BAA-2069 and UCN34. The
arrangement of genetic information is very similar overall, based on alignment of the genomes and the synteny
plot (Figure 2, Additional file 1: Figure S1). The comparison of the BAA-2069 genome with UCN34 showed
about 224 kb (9.5%) of unmatched genetic information.
In the UCN34 genome, 199 (9%) unique genes are present, the BAA-2069 genome contains 269 (12%) unique
or weak similar genes. There are numerous strain-

of 13 local collinear blocs (LCB) (Figure 2). No significant inversions or displacements of large regions
between the S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus genomes
of BAA-2069 and UCN34 were obvious. Regions with

specific regions with functional genes originated by
genetic evolution or lateral gene transfer (LGT). Due to
the high number of genomic differences, we focused on
genes and regions relating to putative virulence-associated functions or genes affected by habitant adaptation. All unique genes and corresponding islands

Figure 2 Whole genome alignment of the two strains of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. Representation of 13 local collinear blocks (LCB)
between chromosomal sequences of the S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus BAA-2069 and UCN34 was generated by MAUVE 2.3.1 software [31]
with a minimum weight of 355. Sequence of BAA-2069 (top) is the reference against UCN34. The connecting lines between blocks indicate the
location of each block in the two genomes. Each colored block represents a homologous region without rearrangements, although white areas
within blocks are strain-specific.

low similarity to the corresponding genome occur frequently and their distribution is almost random,
although the region from base 2,117,000 bp to the end
of the genome seems to be more conserved.
Virulence factors

The BAA-2069 genome contains a 34 kb unique insertion comprising 35 ORFs (SGGBAA2069_c20310c20660), including the putative major cell surface adhesin pac. This gene is a major colonization factor in S.
mutants [32] and may play a similar role in BAA-2069,
in addition, it has a 84% similarity to a gene in UCN34
(Gallo_1675). Almost identical to this region is another
30 kb large section in the BAA-2069 genome
(SGGBAA2069_c13640-c13980). Both described genetic
islands could be functionally virulence-associated, comprising several proteins for cell adhesion and other virulence-determining factors.
In addition, we found a unique 23 kb genetic island in
the BAA-2069 genome, coding for bacteriocin-associated
genes (SGGBAA2069_c00810-c00960). This region contains genes for lanthionine biosynthesis and for a bacteriocin/lanthionine exporter orthologous to genes
described in S. mutants and S. ratti. Lanthionine is a
lantibiotic (bacteriocin), a unique class of peptide antibiotic substances [33]. Conducting an agar overlay
experiment, we revealed an inhibited growth of Lactococcus lactis, resulting in a zone of clearing around
BAA-2069 (data not shown).
Three genes (SGGBAA2069_ c05730, c12530, c17410)
are partly homologue to hemolysin A, hemolysin III and
an undefined hemolysin-like protein, although group D
streptococci are usually non-hemolytic or eventually display weak alpha hemolysis. Moreover, BAA-2069 does

show alpha-hemolysis on Schaedler Agar with 5% sheep
blood.
The polysaccharide capsule coding region, contains 12
genes (cpsA - cpsM/SGGBAA2069_c09190 - c09300).
The genes are located in a 13.5 kb region and are identical to the UCN34 genome.
Comparison of surface proteins

We predicted 21 proteins with C-terminal LPxTG motif
by in silico analysis. Additionally, we found orthologous
or similar genes to all the proteins with MSCRAMMS
characteristics described by Sillanpää et al. regarding the
S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus TX20005 genome
(”Sbs” genes) and to genes mentioned by Rusinok et al.
regarding the UCN34 genome ("Gallo_"-genes) [13,30].
All genes with the LPxTG motif and their best hits in
related genomes are listed in Table 2.
Within the analysis, we found three proteins containing the LPxTG motif carried by genomic islands specific
to strain BAA-2069. The gene SGGBAA2069_c13880
and its paralog SGGBAA2069_c20560 have only very
weak similarities to Gallo_1675 and code for a putative
major cell surface adhesin (pac). The gene
SGGBAA2069_c13900
and
its
paralog
SGGBAA2069_c20580 have cell anchor characteristics
but no similarities to functional genes. Furthermore, the
unique protein SGGBAA2069_c22120 comprising the
LPxTG motif is another gene with putative function in
virulence.
Protective elements

In comparison to S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus
UCN34, the BAA-2069 holds two more restriction
enzyme genes. The type III enzyme SthIR
(SGGBAA2069_c10290) is located on a 9.9 kb unique

on a 9.7 kb region (SGGBAA2069-c22460 - c22570).
Mentionable regions missing in BAA-2069, but present in the UCN-34 genome, are a 46 kb phage-associated region containing a putative phage-associated cell

of a 36 bp consensus sequence. Another 5.6 kb CRISPR

was conducted. The analysis revealed a core genome
consisting of 1118 genes common to all three species,
whereas S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus BAA-2069 has
804 unique genes (Figure 3). Furthermore, we included
three Enterococcus faecalis genomes (V583, OG1RF and
62 [34-36]). Comparison analysis revealed a set of 825
common genes, including a putative hemolysin A gene
(SGGBAA2069_c05730), a fibronectin/fibrinogen binding protein (SGGBAA2069_c08170) and a sortase A
gene (SGGBAA2069_c11150) which could have a possible conserved role in virulence (Additional file 4: Table
S3). A complete list of common or unique ORFs in
comparison to BAA-2069, considering all known Streptococcus genomes, is shown in Additional file 5: Table
S4. Furthermore, a taxonomic analysis based on alignment of core genomes was performed (Figure 4). The
calculation includes the total number of coding
sequences common to all analyzed species [37]. The
revealing phylogenetic tree indicates a huge genomic
diversity between S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus and
related whole genome sequenced species.

insertion sequence IS1216 elements and a putative resolvase and a relaxase gene were identified. The relaxase
gene has similarities to plasmid pTet35 from Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni 81-176, which suggests its
classification of the conjugative transfer system in clade
MOBP4. Although, it is more likely that it belongs to the
MOBV cluster, which is still ancestrally related to MOBP
[38]. The replication is probably regulated by one of
four putative rep elements, belonging to rep_1 superfamily (SGGBAA-2069_p00100) and rep_3 superfamily
(SGGBAA-2069_p00020, p00140, p00200). The repA
(SGGBAA-2069_p00140) element has 78% sequence
identity to that of the cryptic plasmid pSBO1 isolated
from S. equinus [39]. However, we were not able to
determine the functional rep gene by in silico analysis.
The plasmid pSGG1 seems to be incapable of conjugal
self-transfer since it encodes no tra protein and only a
putative resolvase, although it was not tested experimentally. Moreover, a mobilization region orthologous to a
mob gene in Streptococcus ferrus was found
(SGGBAA2069_p00200), which is a necessary feature

for transmissible plasmids and therefore promotes the
ability for LGT transfer in presence of a helper conjugative plasmid. Five ORFs were assigned to encode proteins with unknown functions and no significant
sequence similarities to previously described genes exist
in these cases (Figure 5). The analysis of sequence identity to other plasmids or genomes reveals a mosaic-like
structure representing a high number of similarities with
common habitants of the rumen or the gastrointestinal
tract, including different streptococcal species as well as
Enterococcus and others. In particular, the tetracycline
resistance genes, which are very common among streptococci, are partly identical among many different plasmids and species, although no similarities in
arrangement of resistance genes were observed. To evaluate the distribution of pSGG1 among strains of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus with different origin (animal,
strain collections and human samples), we screened 41
strains by Southern blot hybridization analysis with a
digoxygenin nick-labeled probe of pSGG1 (Figure 6).
We identified and isolated a plasmid (pSGG2) mainly

patient with infectious endocarditis. The restriction fragment analysis of pSGG2 revealed a partially different
pattern in comparison to pSGG1, indicating sequence
variation between both plasmids (Additional file 6:

Figure. S2). In further experiments we sequenced the
pSGG2 plasmid and revealed only differences in noncoding regions (data not shown).
In order to analyze whether the frequency and phenotype of tetracycline resistance of strain BAA-2069 is
coincident with the presence of pSGG1, we screened 41

S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strains for presence of
tetL and mob genes by PCR. Additionally, we performed
a tetracycline susceptibility test. The epidemiological
cut-off for the WT of related streptococci is ≤ 1 μg/mL
http://eucast.org. About 42% of strains were growthinhibited by a tetracycline concentration between 0.5-1
μg/mL, and 95% of strains tested were unable to grow
at concentrations higher than 256 μg/mL. The two
strains which showed a tetracycline MIC value of 512
μg/mL carrying the pSGG plasmid, and only these were
screened positively for tetL and mob genes (Additional
file 7: Figure. S3).

Discussion
The present study describes the full genome sequence of
S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus BAA-2069 and the
comparison to related genomes in order to evaluate possible virulence-associated characteristics of this species.
Previous publications have shown a significant diversity
in adhesion and invasion potential for binding to
endothelial host cells, as well as binding to ECM proteins in vitro [22]. Other studies have shown that virulence gene profiles are associated with disease [40].
Therefore genomic comparison analysis provides the
basis for understanding pathogenicity.
Within whole genome comparison analysis the “pangenome” includes a core genome containing genes present in all strains of one species. This is complemented
by an individual set of genes unique to a strain or not
shared by all strains. With the growing number of
sequenced strains, the increasing size of the pan-genome
is evidence of the genomic diversity between different
isolates of a distinct species. Tettelin et al. have shown
that in the case of Streptococcus agalactiae the core genome of eight strains comprises about 80% of genes of
any single genome, and exploration of data reveals that
the gene reservoir is immense [41], whereas in the case
of Bacillus anthracis the number of strain-specific genes
after addition of the fourth strain was zero [42]. The
number of strain-specific regions in the two analyzed S.
gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strains is, in contrast to S.
agalactiae strains (average 7.27%, maximum ~10%),
about 3.5% higher. This could be taken as a hint that,
with the increasing number of sequenced strains, the
pan-genome of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is far
larger by proportion. However, these data are preliminary, pending the sequencing of further S. gallolyticus
subsp. gallolyticus strains.
In a direct comparison to the recently sequenced
strain UCN34 [30], surprisingly many unique genes with
putative virulence associated characteristics are present
in each strain, which could be an indication that the
pathogenicity of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is very
diverse. The majority of exclusive sequences found in

Page 9 of 13

the UCN34 genome are located in three large regions
representing 111 kb of sequence information (53%),
whereas the three largest unique regions in BAA-2069
constitute only 87 kb (39%) of strain-specific sequence
and mostly consist of smaller regions. However, the tendency of virulence factors to be located within genomic
islands may lead to a higher ratio of exchangeability of
such genes in comparison to other regions [43]. Furthermore, additional restriction enzymes in BAA-2069 may
have a function in protection against viral DNA and
heritable CRISPR elements are able to mediate immunity against phages and be transmitted to other organisms by genetic transformation events [44].
Surface proteins and in particular proteins belonging
to “microbial surface component recognizing matrix
molecules” (MSCRAMM) were shown to play a functional role in the pathogenesis of all bacteria. Of specific
interest is a group of proteins containing the C-terminal
cell wall-sorting motif LPxTG, which serves as a recognition site for the membrane-associated sortase. After
sortase-mediated cleavage of the protein, the polypeptide
is covalently bound to the peptidoglycan of bacterial cell
surface and can therefore promote the first step in bacterial adherence [45,46]. Three of the 21 predicted
LPxTG motif genes are unique for BAA-2069 and
further studies are required to evaluate their contribution to pathogenicity.
In silico analysis of genome data strongly indicated the
presence of a multi-copy plasmid. The purification of
plasmid DNA and further analysis of sequence data confirmed these hints and showed a localization of tetracycline resistance genes. Analysis of plasmid distribution
shows only two mainly homologous plasmids in 41
strains overall. Therefore, the incidence of the pSGG
plasmids among S. gallolyticus isolates does not seem to
be widespread. The mosaic tetracycline resistance gene
tet(O/W/32/O) is usually chromosomally located and
mediates resistance by ribosome protection. It has been
shown that the mosaic tet(O/W) genes have a higher
level of resistance than the original genes [47]. This
could be verified by our experimental data, showing the
strains carrying the pSGG plasmid have the highest
resistance levels. The tetL gene is generally found on
plasmids and coding for a tetracycline efflux protein
[48]. In contrast to the BAA-2069 strain, the tetracycline
resistance of strain UCN34, mediated by tetL and tetM,
was located on the chromosome and adjacent to putative plasmid and transposon Tn916-associated genes
[30]. This indicates a strong dependence between high
tetracycline resistance mediated by tetL and the occurrence of plasmids of the pSGG family.
Because of antibiotic treatment, gastrointestinal tract
and rumen are well-known reservoirs of mobilizable
antibiotic resistance genes [49]. Furthermore, the

Hinse et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:400
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/400

transfer of antibiotic resistance across several species
and genera between commensal bacteria is well known,
and habitants with a dense population and, in particular,
the ability to form biofilms, are optimal for genetic
transfer [50]. Especially because, S. gallolyticus subsp.
gallolyticus is a commensal and facultative pathogen of
animals, the intensive tetracycline treatments in animal
husbandry, causes a general advantage regarding evolutionary fitness for pathogenic and natural habitants of
the intestinal tract to accommodate resistance genes by
LGT [51,52]. Although the plasmid pSGG1 is incapable
of conjugal self-transfer, it is mobilizable by a helper
conjugative plasmid. These findings suggest that it may
play a functional role in LGT between different streptococcal groups and further related species. However, the
detection of only two plasmids out of 41 strains is so far
not evidence of LGT, but further screening of a huge
variety of strains in combination with epidemiological
studies should help to evaluate the role of pSGG
plasmids.

Conclusion
This study presented the analysis and comparison of the
whole genome sequence of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strain BAA-2069, a causative agent of infective
endocarditis. The results promote identification of
genetic factors concerning the pathogenesis and adhesion to ECM. Novel candidate genes were detected
probably contributing to the pathogenicity. The comparison to S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strain UCN34
revealed significant differences concerning virulence factors, surface proteins and protective elements.
Furthermore, we detected for the first time the presence of the pSGG1 plasmid, containing 21 ORFs
including mosaic tetracycline resistance genes and may
play a functional role in lateral gene transfer.
Methods
Bacterial strains, growth conditions, nucleic acid
extraction

The S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strain was isolated
in 2003 at the Herz- und Diabeteszentrum NordrheinWestfalen from a blood culture from a 68-year-old
woman with aortic heart valve endocarditis and deposited at the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Manassas, USA) (BAA-2069). Strain BAA-2069 was confirmed by isolation of the same strain by lesion smear
test of aortic heart valve and detection in valve excision
material by culture and PCR. The strain was selected
because it had been defined as virulent during earlier
tests [22] and shows phenotypic resistance against oxacillin, tobramycin, co-trimoxazole, colistin, metronidazole and tetracycline and intermediate resistance against
gentamycin (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) 8

μg/mL). Isolate 010672 with plasmid pSGG2 was isolated in 2001 at the Herz- und Diabeteszentrum Nordrhein-Westfalen from a blood culture from a 62-year-old
man with infectious endocarditis with no obvious connection to the origin of strain BAA-2069. For genomic
DNA isolation, cells were grown for 12 h in Brain Heart
Infusion Broth (BHI) (Oxoid, Hampshire, United Kingdom) at 37°C, 200 rpm. DNA extraction was performed
by the Hopwood alkaline lysis method [53].
Genome sequencing, assembly and gap closure

DNA sequencing was performed using 454 Life Science
pyrosequencing technology [54], GS-FLX Titanium produced 455,842 reads of average 329 bp. The reads were
assembled using Newbler V2.3, resulting in 38 contigs
with 31 contigs larger than 500 bp. The large contigs
obtained with 64.9× coverage served as the basis for the
gap closure. Gap closure was performed by custom primer walking with long range PCR (using Phusion polymerase, New England Biolabs, Frankfurt (Main),
Germany) and subsequent Sanger sequencing, resulting
in 62 reads in total (IIT Biotech, Bielefeld, Germany).
Long repeat structures (copies of the rrn operon and
two repeats of 17.4 and 5 kbp respectively) were
resolved by introducing fake reads based on the consensus sequence.
Genome annotation

Curation and annotation of the genome were performed
using the genome annotation system GenDB 2.4 [55].
Prediction of coding sequences (CDS) was accomplished
using Critica [56], Glimmer [57] and Reganor [58]. All
predicted ORFs were automatically submitted to similarity searches against nr, Swissprot, KEGG, InterPro, Pfam
and TIGRfam databases. Putative signal peptides, transmembrane helices and nucleic acid binding domains
were predicted using SignalP [59], TMHMM [60] and
Helix-Turn-Helix [61], respectively. The automatic
annotation of each CDS was manually checked and corrected according to the most congruent tool results.
Genome analysis

S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus BAA-2069 gene content
was compared to S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus

then calculates BLASTP score ratio values (SRV). Paralogous genes might be discarded during the analysis. For

each comparison, SRV distribution was fitted with
binominal or bibeta distribution with a self written R
script, and a cutoff was determined at the point where
the probability of belonging to one or other peak is
equal. Accordingly, a general cutoff of 0.21 was used to
retrieve the core genes and singletons. LPxTG-related
proteins were searched by screening for [LYF]P[TSA]
[GANS] motif and using of an LPxTG Hidden Marcov
Model for sortase substrates created by Boekhorst et al.
[46].

accordance with standard protocols. The probe was prepared by nick translation DIG labeling of pSGG1 referring to DIG DNA Labeling Kit (Roche Diagnostics,
Mannheim, Germany) [62]. Furthermore all strains were
screened for the presence of tetL gene by PCR using the
whole genome sequence derived primer tet_f (5’GCTATGGGAGAAGGTATCG-3’) and tet_r (5’GAGACAAACCCTGCTACTG-3’), or mob_f (5’AAGCTGTACTTGGCTCTC-3’) and mob_r (5’CAGTGGCAGAACTATCTC-3’) respectively, by standard methods.

Comparison of whole chromosome sequences

Comparison of whole chromosome sequences was performed by MAUVE software using local collinear blocs
(LCB). An LCB is defined as a collinear (consistent) set
of multi-MUMs (exact match subsequences shared by
all the considered chromosomes that appear once in
each chromosome and are bordered on both sides by
mismatched nucleotides). The weight (the sum of the
lengths of the included multi-MUMs) of an LCB serves
as a measure of confidence that it is a true orthologous
region instead of a random match and is set to 355.
Therefore, the ORFs or sequences between the LCBs
and any regions with low similarity (shown as white in
LCB) are classified as strain-specific regions.

Nucleotide sequence accession number

Whole genome sequence of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus was deposited at GenBank (Acc. no. FR824043).
Sequence of the novel designated plasmid pSGG1 was
deposited with accession no. FR824044.
Tetracycline susceptibility testing

For each strain, 200 μL BHI broth (Oxoid, Cambridge,
UK) supplemented with indicated tetracycline concentration were inoculated with 1 μL of overnight culture
of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strains and cultivated
in 96 well plates at 37°C. After 16 h incubation, OD 600
was measured and growth was determined as OD 600 >
0.2. The assay was performed in triplicate.

Calculation of phylogenetic tree

For calculation of phylogenetic tree, EDGAR was used
[49]. In detail this means that, for this project comprising 25 genomes 300 core genes (orthology-cutoff 35%
Score Ratio Value) of these genomes are computed. In a
next step alignments of the core genes are generated
using MUSCLE, non-matching parts of the alignment
are masked by GBLOCKS and subsequently removed.
The remaining parts of all alignments are concatenated
to one huge alignment. Based on this alignment, a distance matrix is calculated using the Kimura algorithm,
which is used as input for the neighbor joining method
(both algorithms realized in the PHYLIP package). This
leads to a phylogenetic tree, represented in newick
format.
GC skew analysis

The GC skew measures the excess of Gs by calculating
the difference between the number of Gs and Cs (G-C)
in a sliding window of 1000 nucleotides. The skews
were cumulated to obtain the cumulative GC skew that
represents the sum of the GC skews from the first to
the ith window.
Plasmid screening

Screening of 41 different S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strains for presence of pSGG1 plasmid or homologs
was performed by Southern-hybridization analysis in
