Abstract
Background: A robust bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based physical map is essential for many aspects of
genomics research, including an understanding of chromosome evolution, high-resolution genome mapping,
marker-assisted breeding, positional cloning of genes, and quantitative trait analysis. To facilitate turkey genetics
research and better understand avian genome evolution, a BAC-based integrated physical, genetic, and
comparative map was developed for this important agricultural species.
Results: The turkey genome physical map was constructed based on 74,013 BAC fingerprints (11.9 × coverage) from
two independent libraries, and it was integrated with the turkey genetic map and chicken genome sequence using
over 41,400 BAC assignments identified by 3,499 overgo hybridization probes along with > 43,000 BAC end
sequences. The physical-comparative map consists of 74 BAC contigs, with an average contig size of 13.6 Mb. All but
four of the turkey chromosomes were spanned on this map by three or fewer contigs, with 14 chromosomes
spanned by a single contig and nine chromosomes spanned by two contigs. This map predicts 20 to 27 major
rearrangements distinguishing turkey and chicken chromosomes, despite up to 40 million years of separate evolution
between the two species. These data elucidate the chromosomal evolutionary pattern within the Phasianidae that
led to the modern turkey and chicken karyotypes. The predominant rearrangement mode involves intrachromosomal inversions, and there is a clear bias for these to result in centromere locations at or near telomeres in
turkey chromosomes, in comparison to interstitial centromeres in the orthologous chicken chromosomes.
Conclusion: The BAC-based turkey-chicken comparative map provides novel insights into the evolution of avian
genomes, a framework for assembly of turkey whole genome shotgun sequencing data, and tools for enhanced
genetic improvement of these important agricultural and model species.

Background
Turkey, Meleagris gallopavo (MGA), is second to chicken
(Gallus gallus, GGA) as an agriculturally important avian
species in the U.S. and globally [1]. Phylogenetic analyses
suggest that the last common ancestor to the turkey and

chicken lived between 20 and 40 million years ago [2,3].
Genetic analysis and the requisite tools for modern
turkey breeding have hitherto focused on developing a
genetic linkage map with limited physical information.
Turkey genome research has lagged behind and, to some
extent, depended upon our understanding of the chicken
genome. Karyotype analysis demonstrated that the chromosomes of turkey are substantially similar to those of
chicken [reviewed in 4]. Turkey has a diploid chromosome number of 80, as opposed to 78 for chicken. Most
chicken chromosomes appear to correspond to single
orthologous turkey chromosomes, except for GGA2,

orthologous to MGA3 and MGA6, and GGA4, orthologous to MGA4 and MGA9, probably due to centric
fission events in the turkey lineage [4]. The availability of
the complete chicken genome sequence and its associated resources [5] provided the opportunity to analyze
the turkey genome and its evolutionary relatedness to
that of the chicken in much greater depth.
An important step towards the comprehensive analysis
of a large genome is the generation of high-quality, wellanchored physical maps [6-9]. Such maps have been
widely used to effectively integrate genomic tools for highresolution genome mapping, marker-assisted breeding,
positional cloning of genes, and quantitative trait locus
(QTL) detection [10,11]. Simultaneously, physical maps
provide desirable platforms for whole genome sequencing
and assembly [12-15] and large-scale comparative genomics. Various strategies for creating such maps have been
employed, but the use of multiple independent data
sources is desirable for cross-checking alignments and
minimizing errors. Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
fingerprints and BAC-end sequences (BES) together with
genetic maps and cytogenetic analysis provide an efficient
strategy for building robust whole-genome physical maps
for large genomes. For example, Gregory et al. [8] produced a detailed comparative physical map of the mouse
and human genomes by combining BAC-end sequencing
with a whole-genome BAC contig map created using BAC
fingerprints, revealing a high level of local colinearity
between these two genomes. Fujiyama et al. [16] constructed a clone-based comparative map of the human
and chimpanzee genomes using paired chimpanzee BES
aligned with the human genome sequence. Larkin et al.
[17] built a cattle-human comparative map using cattle
BES and the human genome sequence. Roberto et al. [18]
reported a refined gibbon genome comparative map with
respect to the human genome by combining BES and
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Wei et
al. [19] generated a sequence-ready physical map of maize
and aligned it to the genome of rice, revealing its complex
evolutionary history. Gu et al. [20] constructed a BACbased physical map of Brachypodium distachyon and compared it with the rice and wheat genomes, providing an
important resource for the completion of the Brachypodium genome sequence and grass comparative genomics.
Turkey has a genome size similar to that of the chicken
at 1,100 million base pairs (Mb) per haploid (1C) genome
[5]. To develop tools essential for continued genetic
improvement of this species, DNA marker-based genetic
maps have been developed and aligned with those of the
chicken [21-26]. Recently, multi-platform next-generation whole genome shotgun sequencing of the domestic
turkey has been carried out [13], and that sequence was
assembled, in part, using a preliminary version of the
map that we describe below. However, further advances,

such as the development of DNA markers for fine mapping in a region of interest, isolation of clones containing
a gene and/or QTL by positional cloning, finished quality
whole genome sequence assembly, and large-scale comparative genomics analyses with other Galliformes genomes, require the powerful infrastructure derived from a
detailed physical comparative BAC map.
Here, we report a genome-wide BAC-based physical
and comparative map of the turkey genome, integrated
using an average of one sequence-tagged site per 25
kilobase pairs (kb). Alignment of the turkey physical
map with the chicken genome sequence identified 20 to
27 major chromosome rearrangement events that
occurred during the separate evolution of the turkey
and chicken genomes, most of which were shown to be
inversions. These results suggest that genomes within
the Phasianidae have remained remarkably stable
throughout their history and reveal interesting trends in
the evolution of avian chromosomes.

Results and discussion
Turkey BAC contig physical map

A total of 85,208 clones were fingerprinted for physical
map assembly, randomly selected from two large-insert
turkey BAC libraries, CHORI-260 and TKNMI (see
Methods), the latter of which was generated in this study.
These clones together cover the turkey haploid genome
by about 13.7-fold, with 8.1- and 5.6-fold coverage from
CHORI-260 and TKNMI, respectively (Table 1). Furthermore, we sequenced 43,238 BAC ends randomly selected
from the two BAC libraries and hybridized the libraries
with over 3,500 overgo probes designed from turkey BES,
microsatellite markers and genes, chicken genes, and
other regions of the chicken genome demonstrating high
evolutionary conservation to facilitate map construction
and comparative genomics.
We assembled the turkey physical map from BAC fingerprints, BES and hybridization results independently
using two approaches. In the first approach, contigs

were assembled automatically using FingerPrinted Contigs (FPC) version 9.3 [27] and then edited, verified and
extended as follows. Only those BACs with fingerprints
of 16 or more bands were selected for contig construction. As a result, a total of 74,013 BACs, covering the
turkey haploid genome 11.9-fold, were validated for map
assembly. Every FPC contig was manually checked for
potential chimeric contigs based on BAC fingerprint
patterns. All questionable contigs were split and reassembled at a higher stringency using cutoff values ranging from 1e-11 to 1e-09 (FPC DQer function). Then, to
identify potential junctions between contigs, the entire
fingerprint database was searched for matches to terminal clone fingerprints of every contig using the end to
end function of FPC with cutoff values ranging from 1e20 to 1e-07. Contigs were merged only if terminal
clones shared 10 or more bands and their overall fingerprint patterns supported the merge. Next, 2,551 DNA
markers assigned to 15,683 BACs by overgo hybridization (Methods) were incorporated into the physical map
contigs. Contigs were merged using cutoff values
between 1e-08 and 1e-04 if they shared markers and
their terminal overlapping band patterns supported the
merge. Then we incorporated 28,385 BES including
11,829 mate-pairs into the physical map. Finally, without
any further merges, singletons were added if there were
overlaps with one or more clones in a contig using cutoff values between 1e-20 and 1e-05.
The map assembly strategies described above reduced
the total number of contigs in the turkey physical map to
720 from 8,870, containing a total of 55,192 clones,
whereas the remaining 18,821 clones remained as singletons. Each contig contains 2 to 955 clones with an average
of 77 clones per contig. The contigs span from 78 to
26,130 kb, with an average physical length of 2,317 kb
(Table 2). The 720 contigs consisted of 575,144 consensus
bands, estimated to span approximately 1,668 Mb. See
Additional file 1: Table S1 for a list of the contigs of the
turkey physical map. Table 2 summarizes characteristics
of the resultant turkey BAC contig map. We aligned the
physical map contigs to the chicken genome sequence
(Methods). Of the 720 contigs, 516 (71.7%) spanning 1,609
Mb or 96.4% of the total physical length of the turkey physical map could be aligned to the chicken genome
sequence, based on the hybridization of 2,551 unique
probes to 15,683 BACs and the BLASTN alignment of
28,385 turkey BES as anchors.
The largest contig in the map consisted of 955 BAC
clones, spanning more than 26 Mb in physical length. The
average BAC contig size of the map is > 2 Mb with the
N50 contig size being > 7.8 Mb. Coverage by BACs
assembled into the map was 11.9-fold (Table 2). According
to our previous studies [28-34], this coverage is expected to
generate a high-quality physical map. Moreover, since the

Page 3 of 17

source clones for the map were selected from two BAC
libraries constructed with different restriction enzymes
(EcoRI and MboI), the resultant map is expected to have
enhanced actual genome coverage [10]. The 720 contigs of
the turkey physical map collectively span approximately
1,668 Mb in physical length, larger than the estimated
1,100-Mb turkey genome size by approximately 50%. The
excess in total physical length is expected because FPC will
not merge all truly overlapping contigs. These overlaps
exist between contigs for which there are too few common
restriction fragments to allow for a statistically significant
merge, given the stringent criteria employed to minimize
false positive overlaps.
BES-based turkey-chicken BAC map

Based on the high frequency at which turkey BES were
uniquely aligned to the chicken sequence assembly (Methods) and the availability of extensive data from overgo
hybridization (with orthologous placements on the
chicken sequence), we also generated a turkey BAC physical map using an alternative approach. Contigs were first
assembled by BES alignment to the chicken genome and
then merged using terminal overgo hybridization to a
common BAC or common placement of terminal BACs in
a single fingerprint contig. This approach provided a
unique most likely orthologous alignment for 44,493 turkey BACs along the framework chicken sequence (Additional file 2: Table S2). Initial contigs were assembled from
overlapping BAC clones, each of which was placed by two
consistent alignments (a BES mate pair or one BES and
one overgo hybridization), followed by merging the resultant contigs based on fingerprint contigs that were
assembled independently of the BES data.
This second approach resulted in a comparative physical
BAC map between turkey and chicken, consisting of only
74 turkey contigs (Table 3 and Additional file 3: Table S3).
The comparative map spans 1,004 Mb of the chicken
sequence, with an average contig size of 13.6 Mb, a N50
contig size of 30.9 Mb and a N90 contig size of 9.2 Mb.
All but four of the mapped turkey chromosomes were
spanned on this map by three or fewer contigs, with 14
chromosomes spanned by a single contig and nine chromosomes spanned by two contigs. Not surprisingly, the
turkey Z chromosome is less contiguous, consisting of 11
contigs, due to the fact that females (ZW) were used for
both the turkey BAC libraries and the chicken sequence
assembly. The arrangement and number of contigs in our
turkey Z map did not change when we used the more
complete chicken Z sequence of Bellott et al. [35] rather
than the WUGSC2.1/galGal3 assembly (Additional file 4:
Table S4), although the sizes of contigs with internal
repeats can change. Our MGA18, MGA27 and MGA30
maps also are likely to be incomplete due to partial and/or
uncertain coverage of the orthologous chromosomes

Comparison of mapping approaches

The two BAC contig map building approaches described
above employed identical or overlapping data sets but
differed in the order in which those data were used. The
first approach built the initial physical map using FPC
with BAC fingerprints only, followed by incorporating
DNA overgo probe results (including linkage map markers) and BES alignments, whereas the second approach
began by aligning turkey BACs into contigs along the
chicken genome sequence based on consistent BES mate
pair alignment or BES plus overgo hybridization alignment, followed by contig merging using fingerprint contig data and further hybridization or FISH analysis. This
approach took advantage of the expected high level of
homology between the chicken and turkey genomes, as
confirmed by the very high rate of matching turkey BES
to unique orthologous sites in the chicken genome.
Given that the chicken sequence itself is estimated to be
only about 95% complete [5], it is remarkable that about
90% of the turkey BES mapped to it (and over 90% of
these to unique locations). With the rapid reduction in
BES sequencing costs, the second approach is attractive
in situations where a highly orthologous reference
sequence already exists. It risks making false alignments
between the test (turkey) and reference (chicken) genomes, but, in general, it more accurately aligns individual
BACs within a given contig, is less sensitive to collapsing
contigs due to repetitive fingerprints, and avoids false
negative overlaps. When additional data (fingerprint

maps, overgo hybridization, FISH) are employed to
insure consistency, the likelihood of incorrectly aligning
genomes (i.e., “chickenizing the turkey genome”) appears
to be low. In our hands, the second approach decreased
the contig number by about an order of magnitude (74
vs. 720). However, this gain in power is somewhat misleading, as in the second approach we performed several
rounds of gap-targeted overgo hybridizations to merge
contigs, whereas the first approach did not employ iterative gap-filling experiments. It is noteworthy that in our
map we were able to place some turkey genome segments that are orthologous to unplaced chicken sequence
contigs and to place turkey sequence orthologous to an
unplaced chicken linkage group on MGA27 (Additional
file 5: Figure S1). Thus, our turkey-chicken comparative
map provides information of value towards improving
the current chicken sequence assembly.
Chromosome evolution differentiating the turkey and
chicken genomes

Our comparative map predicts 20 to 27 major rearrangements (those involving ~100 kb or more) between the turkey and chicken genomes, mostly inversions (Table 3,
Additional files 3 and 5). This result suggests a very high
level of stability within Phasianid genomes. The uncertainty in the number of predicted inversions derives in
part from the fact that for two chromosomes (MGA12/
GGA10 and MGA25/GGA23) the maps are consistent
with either two sequential inversions or simultaneous loss/
inactivation of an internal centromere and gain/activation
of a telomeric centromere. In addition, we were not able
to completely resolve a complex alignment pattern of

*Pattern can be explained by two sequential inversions or centromere replacement
**There may be additional small rearrangements

GGA12p to MGA14 that appears to involve at least one
large segmental duplication (in turkey) and uncertainty in
the respective centromere locations, which may result
from one to four inversions. Below, the turkey-chicken
chromosome alignment is described on a chromosomeby-chromosome basis.
MGA1/GGA1

Despite being by far the longest chromosomes in turkey
and chicken, MGA1 and GGA1 are almost completely
co-linear. Small differences are observed in the SEMA3
gene cluster (9.71-10.05 Mb in WUGSC2.1/galGal3
found at 74.594 Mb in MGA1), and in the EPHA gene

cluster at around 94 Mb (Additional file 3: Table S3)
that may be due to errors in the chicken sequence, segmental duplication differences or possible unequal
recombination. There is also a small segment of ribosomal RNA-encoding DNA (rDNA) within the chicken
sequence at 104.45-104.85 Mb that is missing in turkey
and seems likely to be an assembly error in chicken.
Small inversions (at 75.87-75.93 Mb and at 172.82 Mb
within WUGSC2.1/galGal3) may also be assembly errors
or true rearrangements. Finally, there are two small segments of about 50 and 5 kb at 125.9 Mb and 156.6 Mb,
respectively, on MGA1 whose nearest homologues in

Zhang et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:447

chicken are on GGA4 (Additional file 5: Figure S1). It
seems most likely that these do not represent true translocations but rather were paralogous duplications in the
last common ancestor of chicken and turkey, of which
chicken inherited one and turkey the other copy or segments that moved due to transposable elements. Both
GGA4 segments contain fairly long CR1 retrotransposon
sequences.
MGA2/GGA3

Two inversions differentiate these orthologues. First, the
entire GGA3p arm is inverted, and there is also an
inversion of the 5.6 to 11.6 Mb segment (Figure 1). The
p-arm inversion is supported by 7 BACs whose BES
mate pairs span the rearrangement and 17 BACs that
hybridize to both RTN4 and 105G04T, that flank the
breakpoint in turkey, but are separated by 2.45 Mb on
GGA3 (Additional file 4: Table S4). The internal inversion is supported by 6 turkey BACs whose BES span the
breakpoint and 10 BACs that hybridize to flanking markers in turkey that are separated by 7.5 Mb in chicken.
Both rearrangements were confirmed by FISH mapping
(Figure 2). The WUGSC2.1/galGal3 sequence assembly

MGA2

MGA3/GGA2q

These two chromosomes differ by an inversion at the p
terminus of MGA3 (centromere adjacent on GGA2q,
53.8-56.56 Mb, Additional file 5: Figure S1). In addition,
it appears the WUGSC2.1/galGal3 sequence may have
misplaced short segments at 54.3 Mb and 54.4 Mb
(within the CNTNAP gene cluster).
MGA4/GGA4q

Other than the two small GGA4 sequence segments
found on MGA1 as described above and an apparent
small duplication of a segment at 35.16 Mb, these two
chromosome arms are co-linear.
MGA5/GGA5

Based on the genetic map, it appears that the p-arm of
MGA5 is inverted relative to GGA5 (Figure 3). Our data
do not rule out the possibility that the centromere on
MGA5 also became telomeric as part of this inversion;
however, the turkey karyotype [4] clearly shows a visible

a single contig with little or no observable p-arm.

Figure 1 Turkey chromosome 2 (MGA2) rearrangements. Chromosome segments are shaded to indicate relative directionality: inversion 1,
green and yellow; inversion 2, blue and brown. Arrows (red, inversion 1; blue, inversion 2) connect the inverted segment edges. Constrictions
indicate the likely centromere locations. Selected overgo probe marker hybridizations from those supporting the rearrangements are shown. BES
mate pairs whose spacing and strandedness support the two proposed rearrangements are listed. Inversion 1 is supported by markers RNT4 and
105G04T as well as 7 paired-end BES matches (Additional file 4: Table S4). Inversion 2 is supported by markers 100P13S and 103G13S, together
with 6 paired-end BES spanning the breakpoint. DNA markers 02G07S and OTOR are located at the breakpoint of inversion 2 as landmarks.

p-arm on MGA5. There is also a small inversion of the p
terminal 0.4 Mb of GGA5p (which is now centromere
proximal on MGA5).
MGA6/GGA2p

Some or all of the p terminal 0.27 Mb of GGA2p
appears to map internal to MGA22 (orthologous to
GGA20). While this might be due to a translocation, it
seems more likely to be an assembly error due to a zinc
finger gene family at around 0.3 Mb. Otherwise, MGA6
and GGA2p are completely co-linear. Note that technically, the sequence coordinates of MGA6 should be
reversed relative to those of GGA2p since its centromere is now at the distal (high coordinate) end due to
the centric fission that generated this chromosome [4].
MGA7/GGA7

These orthologues appear to be co-linear except for
another p-arm inversion that places the MGA7 centromere near the p terminus (Figure 3). This result is unexpected since MGA7 has a cytogenetically distinguishable
p-arm [4]. It is possible that the MGA7 centromere is
located at the 10.65 Mb contig gap (Additional file 3:
Table S3), although we did not observe multiple repetitive BES in this region as is usually the case adjacent to
centromeres. Another possibility is that the MGA7p-arm
is mainly repetitive DNA not found in the GGA sequence
assembly or that one of the unassembled chicken microchromosomes is fused to the GGA7 sequence to form
MGA7p. (Given their respective chromosome numbers
and the two known fission events in turkey vs. chicken,
there should be at least one fusion of a microchromosome to another chromosome in turkey [4].)
MGA8/GGA6
Figure 2 FISH to pachytene chromosomes of turkey and chicken
illustrating the MGA2/GGA3 inversions. Co-hybridization with
CHORI-260 107N20 (red, WUGSC2.1/galGal3 BES coordinates 128288325088) and 090K24 (green, 2711577-2958331) to turkey pachytene
chromosomes gives overlapping signals (A) displayed by color-coded
arrowheads, whereas with chicken pachytene chromosomes (B),
107N20 is telomere-adjacent and separated from 090K24 by about 2.5
Mb, as would be expected from the chicken sequence BES alignments.
This is consistent with the p-arm inversion on MGA2 relative to GGA3
(Figure 1). Additional FISH with the TM1 centromere probe
(unpublished observation) confirms that the MGA2 centromere is
telomere-adjacent. Co-hybridization with CHORI-260 095D05 (red,
WUGSC2.1/galGal3 BES coordinates 5361781-5538321) and 110E18
(green, 5654670-13311876) to turkey pachytene chromosomes (C)
gives distinct, well-separated signals, whereas with chicken pachytene
chromosomes (D), the 110E18 signal (green arrowheads) is split, as
expected from its inconsistently spaced BES alignment, with one signal
adjacent to the 095D05 hybridization (red arrowhead) and the other
signal internal on MGA2. The p-arm of MGA2 (A, C) and GGA3 (B, D) is
oriented toward the top of each image. These results support
inversion of the turkey segment orthologous to the 5.6-11.6 Mb
portion of GGA3, as shown in Figure 1. The chicken sequence
coordinates of the BACs used as probes are indicated alongside the
GGA3 bivalents shown in B and D. Scale bar = 1 μm.

A complex series of rearranged segments are found at the
centromeric termini of these two orthologues. Most of
these have been confirmed by FISH hybridization (unpublished observations). Although it is impossible to discern
the exact order of events without detailed mapping of
other Phasianid genomes, it is feasible to explain the various changes by a series of 4 consecutive inversions, each
of which had different end points, leading to 8 genome
segments whose orientations now differ between the two
orthologues (Additional file 5: Figure S1).
MGA9/GGA4p

These two orthologues appear to be completely co-linear. As with MGA6, the coordinates for MGA9 should
technically be reversed, as the centromere is presumed
to remain at the distal (high coordinate) end due to the
likely centric fission that generated this chromosome [4].
MGA10/GGA8

The p-arm inversion that is the major distinguishing feature of these two orthologues was known from karyotype
studies and confirmed by Griffin et al. [39]. As we noted
previously [13], the end points of this inversion are consistent with it being due to unequal recombination

Figure 3 Turkey chromosome p-arm inversions identified in MGA5, MGA7, MGA10 and MGA13. Relevant chromosome segments are
shaded. Large segments are banded to indicate directionality, also shown by colored arrows flanking enlargements. Centromeres are shown by
constrictions. A. MGA5. MGA5p is inverted with respect to GGA5p with an additional small inversion of fragment 2 (yellow). Centromere location in
MGA5p is tentative (see Results and discussion). B. MGA7. GGA7p is inverted with respect to MGA7 (fragment 1, direction indicated by blue arrow)
with movement of the centromere to a telomeric site in MGA7. C. MGA10. GGA8p is inverted with respect to MGA10 with movement of the
centromere to a telomeric site in MGA10. In addition, fragment 3 (yellow) is also inverted (such that its direction is now the same in both species),
and we place a turkey genome segment (fragment 1, red) orthologous to a 340 kb fragment from GGA8_random at a telomere-adjacent location
on MGA10. D. MGA13. GGA11p is inverted with respect to MGA13 with movement of the centromere to at or near the telomere in MGA13.

between the two amylase gene paralogues described by
Benkel et al. [40]. There is also a ~1.4 Mb segment (Figure 3) within this region that has inverted again such that
its direction is now the same in both species. Finally, we
have placed orthologous sequence to that found in
chr8_random in the chicken sequence assembly at the
distal terminus of MGA10, presumably adjacent to the
centromere on this telocentric chromosome (Additional
file 5: Figure S1).
MGA11/GGA9

These two telocentric orthologues differ only by an
inversion at the centromeric end, about 3 Mb in length
(Additional file 5: Figure S1).

MGA12/GGA10

These two orthologues are co-linear, but the MGA12
centromere is now at the distal end, whereas it is
about 1.9 Mb internal in GGA10. Several turkey BES
mate pairs span the location of the chicken centromere
on GGA10 (Additional file 4: Table S4). FISH mapping
(unpublished observations) confirms the correct placement of the GGA10 centromere in the sequence
assembly but its absence at this site in MGA12. This
could be due to two consecutive inversions or to centromere translocation, e.g., replacement of centromere
function at the telomere and loss of the interstitial
centromere.

MGA13/GGA11

The inversion of the GGA11 p-arm leading to MGA13
being telocentric (Figure 3) and its confirmation by
FISH have been described previously [41].
MGA14/GGA12

As with MGA8/GGA6, there is a complex set of rearrangements at or near the p terminus of this pair. This
includes an apparent segmental duplication of a small
region containing the RNF123 gene that appears in three
separate locations in our map. The interstitial centromere
in GGA6 has moved closer to the chromosome terminus.
FISH resolution was not adequate to determine whether
the MGA14 centromere was terminal or between Contig14-1 and 14-2 (Additional file 3: Table S3).
MGA15/GGA13

This pair is mostly co-linear except for a small (0.3 Mb)
inversion near 8.2 Mb and a possible very small inversion
or rearrangement near the centromere. The latter region
is problematic in both our map and the chicken sequence
due to being the site of the protocadherin gene cluster.
MGA16/GGA14

This pair contains a single internal inversion of about
0.7 Mb around 14.4 Mb that has been confirmed by
FISH mapping (Figure 4).
MGA17-19/GGA15-17

No rearrangements were detected between any of these
three pairs of orthologues. However, both the sequence
assembly and our map are incomplete for the very small,
rDNA-containing, MGA18 and GGA16. See Reed et al.
[37] for a more complete description of MGA18.
MGA20/GGA18

As described previously [13], these two chromosomes
are distinguished by a large inversion that terminates in
oppositely transcribed NME gene paralogues, consistent
with it being due to unequal recombination.
MGA21-26, 28, 29/GGA19-24, 26, 27

To the best of our resolution, these eight orthologous pairs
are co-linear. As noted above, we find the telomeric ~0.27
Mb assembled in WUGSC2.1/galGal3 on GGA2p to be
located on MGA22 (near the 9.3 Mb coordinate of
GGA20). We also were able to position the segment
assembled as GGA22_random at ~2.8 Mb on MGA24.
Finally, our map shows that the MGA25 centromere cannot be at the orthologous location to that predicted for
GGA23 (~1.9 Mb). It remains possible that the MGA25
centromere is close to 3.1 Mb, the break between the two
contigs in our map (Additional file 3: Table S3), but we
did not observe the pattern of repetitive BES in this region
that is typically found near centromeres. Thus, it seems
more likely that MGA25 is telocentric (Additional file 5:
Figure S1).

libraries, as well as in sequence libraries. Gordon et al. [36]
showed that the WUGSC2.1/galGal3 chicken sequence
assembly was rather inaccurate for GGA28, and we believe
the same to be true for GGA25. In general, our map of
MGA30 agrees with the Gordon et al. [36] GGA28
sequence, although the map is complicated by an apparent
duplication of at least one small segment. We were able to
place the turkey orthologous sequence to GGA28_random
in our map of MGA30, and we also placed the orthologous turkey sequence to linkage group chrE22C19W28_E50C23 within MGA27. It remains uncertain, but it
seems likely that these two unplaced sequences are in
similar, if not identical, locations in the chicken genome.
The poor coverage of these two chromosome pairs and
MGA18/GGA16 also applies to the remaining chicken
and turkey microchromosomes and, for this reason, they
are not assembled in the chicken sequence nor can they
be assigned in our comparative map.
MGAZ/GGAZ

The birds used for both the chicken sequence and turkey
libraries were female (ZW). Therefore, the sex chromosome
maps rely on half the coverage of that for autosomes.
Furthermore, Bellott et al. [35] showed that the GGAZq
terminus is rich in segmental duplications and poorly
assembled in the WUGSC2.1/galGal3 chicken sequence, so
this area is difficult to align in our map. The repeats at
about 71.5-72.1 Mb in WUGSC2.1/galGal3 and about 81.0
Mb in Bellott et al. [35] are in a location consistent with the
block of Z heterochromatin present in the Phasianidae but
not other land fowl [4]. Also, Shang et al. [42] showed that
the centromere is incorrectly located in the WUGSC2.1/
galGal3 GGAZ assembly. Our map agrees with their centromere location. The major difference between the two Z
chromosomes is a large (~19 Mb) inversion on the second
arm (the chicken Z is almost exactly metacentric, complicating definition of a p- and q-arm) extending from about
44 to 63 Mb, using the WUGSC2.1/galGal3 coordinates.
This has been confirmed by FISH mapping (Figure 5).
There is also a repetitive region near 30.0 Mb that is possibly mis-assembled or contains one or two very short inversions, as well as small segments from chrUn_random and
chrZ_random in the sequence, and a segment (ContigZ-7,
Additional file 3: Table S3) adjacent to the centromere that
may be misplaced in the chicken sequence or may have
moved in turkey.
MGAW/GGAW

Due to its highly repetitive nature, the GGAW sequence
is almost entirely unassembled, and no attempt was
made to align it with MGAW.

MGA27/GGA25 and MGA30/GGA28

in assembling the turkey genome sequence [13] and
aligning it on turkey autosomes (our Z map was too preliminary to use at that time). This is particularly important for the rapidly expanding set of genomes, like that of
the turkey, that are shotgun sequenced solely by “nextgeneration” methodologies that tend to give shorter

sequence contig and scaffold lengths. On the other hand,
high quality BAC physical/comparative maps provide an
even more critical tool for those genome sequences generated by BAC sequencing of minimal tile paths with
either Sanger-based or pooled next generation sequencing technologies [43,44]. While we did not use the

Figure 5 FISH analysis of MGAZ/GGAZ illustrates a large Z chromosome inversion. CHORI-260 BACs 096G02 (green, WUGSC2.1/galGal3
coordinates 39290768-39535155) and 103I04 (red, 59681476-59892200) nearly co-localize on a metaphase turkey chromosome with the MGAZ
centromere (A), but are well-separated on opposite arms on GGAZ (B), as would be expected from their chicken sequence coordinates. Shang et
al. [42] located the GGAZ centromere at 42.2-42.5 Mb. (C) CHORI-260 BAC 099I24 (green, WUGSC2.1/galGal3 coordinates 64731310-64992979)
labels the central portion of the second MGAZ arm (the two arms are of nearly identical length), as would be predicted based on the GGAZ
sequence of Bellott et al. [35]. However, CHORI-260 098I08 (red, WUGSC2.1/galGal3 coordinates 49538900-49816462) nearly co-localizes with
099I24. These results are consistent with an inversion between the two Z chromosomes spanning at least 49-60 Mb. Overgo hybridization and
BES alignment suggest a single ~19 Mb inversion from about 43.9 Mb to 62.8 Mb. Arrows point to the centromere for each chromosome. Scale

turkey sequence assembly to improve the turkey BAC
contig map in order to avoid conclusions based on circular reasoning, there are a small number of the remaining
contig gaps that could now be merged based on turkey
sequence scaffold or contig data (Additional file 3: Table
S3). Such gaps most likely derive from short regions
where there was little or no BAC coverage, despite the
use of the two large-insert libraries. Although genetic
maps [25,26] also provide long range data that were used
to align the turkey sequence scaffolds along chromosomes, their resolution is limited by marker density and/
or linkage disequilibrium, and, in our experience, they
are less accurate than a comparative map based on dense
alignment of BACs using BES and/or overgo hybridization, along with BAC fingerprint contigs.

Conclusions
The turkey-chicken BAC map leads to several general
conclusions. First, it confirms observations that avian
genomes (at least those within the Phasianidae) show a
very high level of stability [45,46]. Despite as much as 40
million years of separate evolution since their last common ancestor, there may be as few as 20 and likely no
more than 27 substantive (> 100 kb) rearrangements
separating the two genomes (Table 3), not including
those microchromosomes and the W chromosome that
have yet to be accurately assembled in either species. Second, those rearrangements that are observed appear to be

almost totally due to intra-chromosomal inversions.
Although we observed a few instances of possible translocation events, based on their size, it appears that these
are much more likely to be due to transposable element
action, chicken sequence mis-assembly or duplicated
sequences in the last common ancestral genome that
were differentially inherited by chicken and turkey. We
find no evidence in our map to support the two interchromosomal rearrangements proposed by Aslam et al.
[26] based on turkey single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) mapping nor can we confirm very many of their
proposed 57 intra-chromosomal rearrangements, other
than the inversions between MGA10/GGA8 and
MGA20/GGA18 that we described previously [13].
Although the reasons for this discrepancy are uncertain,
examination of the rearranged SNP loci suggests that several occur in duplicated sequences or within, or adjacent
to, transposable elements. This would be consistent with
movement of small sequence segments via transposition
or differential inheritance of paralogous duplications that
were present in the last common ancestral genome.
Although the reasons for the predominance of inversion
events are uncertain, it is noteworthy that at least two
appear to arise from unequal recombination between
duplicated genes arranged in inverted order on the same
chromosome (MGA10, amylase and MGA20, NME
genes). It therefore seems possible that some of the

Zhang et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:447
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/447

others are due to unequal recombination between CR1
elements or other repetitive sequences.
These results strongly support the surprising conclusion that there is a clear trend in turkey towards telocentric chromosomes, i.e., centromeres directly adjacent
to the telomere. Figures 1, 2 and 3, and Additional file 5:
Figure S1 show that interstitial centromeres of chicken
chromosomes are located proximal to telomeres in their
turkey orthologues for MGA2, MGA7, MGA10, MGA12,
and MGA13 and possibly in MGA14 and MGA25. In
addition, the two centric fission events involving GGA2
and GGA4 [4,46] that produce MGA3, MGA4, MGA6
and MGA9 all result in telocentric turkey chromosomes.
Indeed, the only clearly metacentric chromosomes in turkey are MGA1 and the sex chromosomes, MGAZ and
MGAW. MGA5 may have a small p-arm, and MGA7
clearly has a p-arm visible in the karyotype [4]. However,
we were unable to map any sequence orthologous to the
chicken genome to MGA7p. The reason, if any, for this
trend away from interstitial centromeres in turkey is
unclear. Based solely on karyotype data [4], it would
appear that a predominance of telocentric chromosomes
is mostly a derived trait within turkey and closely-related
pheasants, but cytogenetics alone cannot distinguish several of the rearrangements we have documented, so
further comparative mapping would be required to
clearly delineate this trend in Phasianid evolution.
The comparative BAC contig map, along with other
genomic resources previously developed in the species,
provides the foundation necessary for many areas of
advanced genomics research in turkey, chicken and other
Galliformes species. For the turkey, as for other agricultural animal and crop species, a primary area of interest is
trait (often QTL) analysis based on linkage maps, increasingly derived using high density SNP arrays. The BACbased physical map provides an essential resource for
additional molecular analysis of trait loci and for positional
cloning.

Methods
Source BAC libraries

A new turkey BAC library, TKNMI, was constructed for
this study with DNA from the same female turkey
employed for the CHORI-260 BAC library and for genome
sequencing [13] using methods described previously
[47,48]. TKNMI is based on insertion of MboI partial
digest fragments into the pECBAC1 vector and contains
46,080 clones. Analysis of 100 random clones showed an
average insert size of 160 kb (Additional file 6: Figure S2),
and TKNMI thus provides 6.7-fold coverage of the turkey
haploid genome. Fewer than 5% of TKNMI clones contain
no inserts. The TKNMI library was used in combination
with the pre-existing CHORI-260 library (EcoRI inserts
into pTARBAC2.1, average insert size of ~190 kb [13]) for

Page 12 of 17

map development. A total of 85,208 turkey BAC clones
were randomly selected from the two BAC libraries for
map construction, covering the haploid turkey genome
about 13.7-fold. The CHORI-260 BAC library is publicly
available through the Children’s Hospital of Oakland
Research Institute BACPAC Resources Center [49].
TKNMI is publicly available through the Laboratory for
Plant Genomics and GENEfinder Genomic Resources at
Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas [50].
BAC DNA preparation and fingerprinting

Our previous studies demonstrated that BAC fingerprints
generated with different restriction enzyme combinations
result in different quality physical maps [33]. Therefore,
we first tested twenty-four 3-, 4- and 5-enzyme combinations of BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, XbaI, XhoI, and HaeIII on
96 BACs randomly selected from the TKNMI library.
Only the ends produced by BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, XbaI
or XhoI digestion were labeled (using NED-ddATP or
HEX-ddATP, see below). HaeIII digests the labeled fragments to sizes that allow separation on a capillary sequencer. Criteria employed were that there is no partial
digestion, no star activity, an average of 35-70 bands per
clone and a relatively even size distribution of the bands in
a window ranging from 35 - 500 base pair (bp). The
enzyme combination of BamHI/EcoRI/HaeIII was selected
for generation of BAC fingerprints for the turkey BAC
libraries. Turkey BAC clones arrayed in 384-well microtiter dishes were inoculated into 96-deep well plates containing 1.0 ml TB (Terrific Broth, [51]) medium with
appropriate antibiotics using a 96-pin replicator (BOEKEL,
Feasterville, PA, USA). The 96-deep well plates were covered with air-permeable seals (Excel Scientific, Wrightwood, CA, USA) and incubated in an orbital shaker at 300
rpm, 37°C for 18-22 h. Overnight cultures were centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 min in a Beckman bench-top centrifuge to harvest cells. BAC DNA was isolated using a
modified alkaline lysis method [51], dissolved in 15 μl TE
(10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) with 8
U/ml RNaseA, 320 U/ml RNase T1 (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) and stored at -20°C before use.
DNA was digested and end-labeled in a reaction containing 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1.0
mM dithiothreitol, pH 8.0, 1.0 mM dNTP, 1.0 μg/μl BSA,
1 U each of BamHI, EcoRI, and HaeIII (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), 0.3 U Taq FS and 6.0 μM HEXddATP or NED-ddATP. The reaction was incubated at
37°C for 2 h, followed by further incubation at 65°C for 45
min. DNAs labeled with different fluorescent dyes (HEXddATP or NED-ddATP) were combined, pelleted, washed,
dried and dissolved in a mixture of 9.8 μl of Hi-Di formamide and 0.2 μl of the internal GeneScan-500 Rox size
standard (Applied Biosystems). DNA was denatured at
95°C for 3 min, cooled on ice and then subjected to

Zhang et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:447
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/447

analysis on an ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) using the default GeneScan module. A total of
85,208 turkey BAC clones were randomly selected from
the two BAC libraries and fingerprinted for physical map
construction. BAC fingerprint fragment sizes were determined using the ABI Data Collection program (Applied
Biosystems). ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer data were processed using the software package ABI-ExportTabularData
[52] and SeqDisplayer (unpublished). Data were transformed using an automatic algorithm by SeqDisplyer into
“bands” files. Several quality checks were applied to the
fingerprints, with sample-empty wells being removed, fingerprints with fewer than 15 band peaks removed, background peaks identified and removed, off-scale bands with
peak heights greater than 6,000 removed, and vector band
peaks removed. Only the bands falling between 35 and
500 bp were used.
BAC contig physical map assembly

Fingerprints of 74,013 (87%) clones were validated and
used for physical map assembly, corresponding to
approximately 11.9-fold coverage of the turkey genome.
Clones had an average of 53.9 restriction fragment bands
in the window of 35 - 500 bases, with a range from 15 to
320 bands per clone. According to our previous studies
[33,34], 11.9-fold genome coverage should suffice for
assembly of a high-quality genome-wide physical map of
the turkey genome. FingerPrinted Contig (FPC) version
9.3 [27] was used to assemble the turkey contig map
from the BAC fingerprints. Two parameters, tolerance
and cutoff, are crucial to the quality of contig assembly.
Tolerance, the window size in which two restriction fragments are considered as equivalent, was set initially by
determining the average 95% confidence interval for the
mean size deviation for each of four pECBAC1 vector
fragments. In addition, tolerances of 4 - 10 were tested
using the entire fingerprint dataset to determine the
parameters suitable for contig assembly. On the basis of
these results, a tolerance of 7 was finally selected. Cutoff
values (probability threshold that fingerprint bands
match by coincidence) of 1e-20 - 1e-02 were tested using
the entire fingerprint dataset, and the resultant numbers
of contigs, singletons, and questionable-clones (Q-clones)
were analyzed. At higher stringencies (1e-20 to 1e-10),
chimeric contigs were split and Q-clones were reduced,
but the number of singletons increased drastically (Additional file 7: Figure S3). At lower stringencies (1e-05 - 1e02), a smaller total number of contigs and larger contigs
were obtained, but a larger number of clones fell into the
Q-clone category. The relationship among the three factors is shown in Figure S3 (Additional file 7), from which
it is apparent that a cutoff value of approximately 1e-08
to 1e-06 resulted in reasonably low numbers for all three

outputs, suggesting a high quality contig assembly. On
the basis of these results, a tolerance of 7 and cutoff of
1e-08 were ultimately selected for initial contig assembly.
The initial build of the turkey physical map resulted in
the generation of 8,870 automatic contigs, prior to incorporation of any BES or DNA marker results.
BAC end sequencing

BAC DNA was isolated and purified as described above.
ABI (Applied Biosystems) BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle
Sequencing Kit reactions contained: 6 μl BAC DNA (100 150 ng/μl), 1 μl standard T7 or SP6 sequencing primer
(4 pmol), 1 μl BigDye cycle sequencing-ready reaction
mix, and 2 μl of ABI 5 × sequencing buffer. Thermal
cycling (ABI GeneAmp PCR System 9700, Applied Biosystems) was performed at 96°C for 4 min, followed by
99 cycles of 96°C for 30 s, 56°C for 10 s, 60°C for 4 min;
and then 60°C for 7 min, and 4 °C for storage. Reaction
products were purified by precipitation in 4 μl of 1.5 mM
sodium acetate in 70% ethanol, followed by washing in
200 μl of 70% ethanol. The samples were then loaded on
an ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer. BAC-end sequences were
trimmed with Phred software [53,54] using Q ≥ 20 as a
cutoff. Repeats were masked by RepeatMasker software
[55]. A total of 43,224 BAC ends were sequenced from
both CHORI-260 (21,738) and TKNMI (21,486). After
vector trimming and quality assessment, 36,941 BES were
deposited in Genbank [Genbank: ER942218-ER962259
and FI503157-FI520055] (Additional file 8: Table S5).
Overgo hybridization probe design and library screening

High-density turkey BAC DNA filters were prepared from
the CHORI-260 (73,728 arrayed BACs) and TKNMI
(36,864 arrayed BACs) libraries as described previously
[56]. The libraries were screened with approximately 4,000
overgo probes by pooled overgo hybridization [57];
CHORI-260 was screened with all the probes, but TKNMI
only with a subset of the probes. The overgo probes were
designed from turkey BES, microsatellite markers and
genes, chicken genes and other regions of the chicken genome demonstrating high evolutionary conservation, and a
small number of zebra finch EST sequences as described
previously [57]. All overgo hybridization probes were
tested in advance using BLAT for a unique alignment with
WUGSC2.1/galGal3 (Additional file 9: Table S6). In a few
cases, overgo probes matching two closely linked duplicated chicken sequences were employed. Overgo labeling
and hybridization were performed as described previously
using a redundant 4-dimensional pooling strategy with
216 probes per screen [57-59]. Overgo hybridization
resulted in 41,423 BAC assignments to 3,499 successful
overgo probes (Additional file 9: Table S6). In early stages
of this work, overgo locations were sampled broadly across

the genome, whereas later screens were specifically
designed to resolve possible rearrangement locations and
gaps in the comparative map.

to containing excessive levels of highly repetitive
sequences (often near likely centromeres or telomeres).

Map integration

Comparative mapping of turkey BES to the chicken May
2006 (WUGSC2.1/galGal3) genome sequence assemblies
[5] was done using NCBI-BLAST [60], requiring matches
of 90% or more for at least 50 bp. An expectation value
of 1e-05 was used as the significance threshold for comparison of turkey BES with the chicken genome sequence
assembly. Alternatively, BES were aligned to WUGSC2.1/
galGal3 using BLAT [61] with initial parameters of minScore = 200 and minIdentity = 70. Respectively, 91% and
87% of BES from CHORI-260 and TKNMI mapped to
the chicken genome. Of those matches, 91 - 92% mapped
to a unique location. Of those BACs for which both ends
mapped to unique locations, 96 - 97% mapped “consistently”, i.e., BES mapped to sites 10-400 kb apart and on
opposite strands in the chicken genome assembly. BES
that mapped to chicken chrUn_random were treated as
having failed to match. All BACs for which both BES
mapped uniquely but to inconsistent locations and BACs
for which one or both BES mapped to multiple locations
were examined manually. In many cases, a single consistent map location could be identified among the multiple
BLAT BES hits that allowed consistent alignment of both
turkey BES or resolved a situation identified as inconsistent by the batch alignment. Most of the remaining
inconsistent BES paired matches identified sites of rearrangements between the turkey and chicken genomes as
confirmed by multiple BAC alignments, overgo hybridization and/or FISH analysis (Additional file 4: Table S4).
Cytogenetic analysis

Turkey and chicken chromosome harvests were prepared
from turkey embryo fibroblast and chicken embryo fibroblast cultures for mitotic metaphase cells and from adult
male gonads for meiotic pachytene stage cells; the latter
was in order to have extended chromosomes for improved
resolution of BAC probe order. The procedures for chromosome harvest, slide preparation, probe labeling, hybridization, and image capture were as described previously
[37,62-65]. BAC clones spanning or near putative chromosome rearrangements as predicted from BES and/or
overgo hybridization analysis were utilized in multi-color
FISH experiments. In each experiment, two to four probes
were hybridized, in some cases to both chicken and turkey
preparations (in the same experiment). The process was
iterative in investigating rearrangements predicted from
BES alignments, in that confirmed BACs were then partnered with new test-BACs to resolve questions of order.
Some test BACs were found to be unsuitable due to widespread hybridization to multiple locations, presumably due

Additional file 1: Table S1. Turkey BAC physical map contig summary.
Turkey physical map contigs are listed with coverage statistics and
corresponding chicken chromosome alignment.
Additional file 2: Table S2. Turkey BACs that aligned to the chicken
sequence. Turkey BACs are either from CHORI-260 (prefix = CH260-) or
TKNMI (prefix = 78TKNMI-) libraries. Turkey BACs sorted by BAC library
and well number are listed with the method of alignment and their
most likely ortholgous alignment with the WUGSC2.1/galGal3 sequence
assembly by chromosome, start coordinate and range. Turkey BACs were
aligned either by overgo hybridization (magenta) or by BES alignment.
For the latter, if both BES aligned consistently and uniquely, the row is
green. If only one BES was available or could be aligned, the row is blue
and the span of the BAC was arbitrarily estimated at 200 kb for CHORI260 or 150 kb for TKNMI BACs. If two BES were available but one had
repetitive matches, the row is tan. If a likely repetitive match was found
manually that was consistent with the other unique BES match, then
that was chosen as the second BES coordinate; otherwise size was
arbitrarily estimated as above. If both BES had unique but inconsistent
matches, the row is yellow. In some cases BACs were placed by both
hybridization and BES alignment, as shown in two separate rows.
Additional file 3: Table S3. Turkey-chicken comparative map contigs
and coordinates. Turkey BAC contigs are listed in sequence along turkey
chromosomes. Contigs are divided into subcontigs (e.g., 1-2.1, 1-2.2, etc.)
due to internal rearrangements or duplications with respect to the
chicken genome that have been merged by independent overgo
hybridization and/or BAC fingerprint contig data (Additional file 4: Table
S4). Start and end coordinates of the orthologous WUGSC2.1/galGal3
chicken sequence are given for all subcontigs (columns D and E). Total
lengths are listed only for full contigs (column F). Additional notes
clarifying subcontig orientation and arrangement or explaining gaps are
provided (columns G and H). As indicated, some gaps between adjacent
contigs are spanned by turkey shotgun sequence scaffolds [13], but we
have not merged contigs on that basis herein.
Additional file 4: Table S4. Comparative map alignments of turkey
BACs to the chicken genome. Turkey BACs are arranged according to
their orthologous chicken sequence coordinates (WUGSC2.1/galGal3). See
Table S2 legend (Additional file 2: Table S2) for explanation of BAC
names and row shading. Contig gaps or rearrangement breakpoints are
indicated in unshaded rows, as noted. Column B lists the corresponding
contig number for selected BACs in the final (Oct. 2010) BAC FPC
physical map assembly (N/A = either no fingerprint available or singleton
BAC). Column C lists contig numbers for CHORI-260 BACs only in an
earlier (March 2008) FPC assembly (nf = no fingerprint available; si =
singleton BAC). Column D lists the computer-estimated BES alignment
outcome (sometimes corrected later by manual annotation) or the
respective overgo hybridization probe used (magenta rows). Columns E
and F list the chicken chromosome and start coordinate, respectively, of
the most likely orthologous location (sometimes as corrected by manual
annotation); whereas columns G and H list the initial chicken
chromosome and range of alignment coordinates, respectively. For BACs
identified by hybridization (magenta) only the estimated orthologous
coordinates of the probe (~ 40 bp) are shown; the BAC extends in both
directions from this site for unknown distances. Columns I provides
information on other probes that hybridize to the BAC, other
miscellaneous information or, in relevant cases, the corresponding
alignments in the Gordon et al. [36] sequence of GGA28 or the Bellott et
al. [35] sequence of GGAZ.

comparative map. Turkey chromosome segments are depicted by
arbitrarily colored arrows (as per Additional file 3: Table S3). Arrow

segments are not to scale. Centromeres, gray-filled circles, are to scale
using the arbitrary sizes chosen in WUGSC2.1/galGal3 (1.5 Mb for GGA110 and GGAZ; otherwise 0.5 Mb). Regions of one or more local
rearrangement are boxed. (A) MGA1-7, MGA9 and MGAZ. Gray arrows
indicate small segments on GGA4 found on MGA1 likely due to
transposon movement or GGA assembly errors. The GGA3 and GGAZ
centromeres are placed according to [38] and [42], respectively. Asterisks
indicate: green, a small fragment of rDNA sequence at 104.45 Mb on
GGA1 not in turkey; blue, turkey orthology to the telomeric 0.3 Mb of
GGA2p in WUGSC2.1/galGal3 is found at 9.3Mb on MGA22; magenta, a
few very small possible inversions and a segment of GGA chrZ_random
and of chrUn_random near 30.0Mb on MGAZ; and red, a very small
segment at 42.47 Mb of uncertain location and orientation. (B) MGA8
and MGA10-22. (C) MGA23-30. Possible rearrangements between MGA27/
GGA25 and MGA30/GGA28 are uncertain due to incomplete chicken
sequence assemblies.

Column G lists marker sequence type (BES, turkey EST, chicken genome,
etc.). Column H lists hybridizing BACs, with those from TKNMI beginning
with “T"; all others are CHORI-260 BACs. The quality of the assignment is
estimated at three confidence levels, P = probable, T = tentative, and W =
weak. Approximately, P indicates a clear signal on 4 of 4 appropriate
overgo pools, T generally indicates either one (of four) fainter or smeared
signals and W usually indicates only 3 of 4 dimensions being positive, all
hybridizations being faint or some other concern. Unshaded rows indicate
overgos made using turkey sequence sources, those shaded in yellow
indicate overgos designed from chicken sequences, and those shaded
blue indicate overgos designed from zebra finch sequences.
