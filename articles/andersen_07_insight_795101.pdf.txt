Abstract
Background: The salivary glands of hematophagous animals contain a complex cocktail that
interferes with the host hemostasis and inflammation pathways, thus increasing feeding success.
Fleas represent a relatively recent group of insects that evolved hematophagy independently of
other insect orders.
Results: Analysis of the salivary transcriptome of the flea Xenopsylla cheopis, the vector of human
plague, indicates that gene duplication events have led to a large expansion of a family of acidic
phosphatases that are probably inactive, and to the expansion of the FS family of peptides that are
unique to fleas. Several other unique polypeptides were also uncovered. Additionally, an apyrasecoding transcript of the CD39 family appears as the candidate for the salivary nucleotide
hydrolysing activity in X.cheopis, the first time this family of proteins is found in any arthropod
salivary transcriptome.
Conclusion: Analysis of the salivary transcriptome of the flea X. cheopis revealed the unique
pathways taken in the evolution of the salivary cocktail of fleas. Gene duplication events appear as
an important driving force in the creation of salivary cocktails of blood feeding arthropods, as was
observed with ticks and mosquitoes. Only five other flea salivary sequences exist at this time at
NCBI, all from the cat flea C. felis. This work accordingly represents the only relatively extensive
sialome description of any flea species. Sialotranscriptomes of additional flea genera will reveal the
extent that these novel polypeptide families are common throughout the Siphonaptera.

Background
The blood-feeding habit evolved independently in many
arthropod orders or even within insect families [1].
Although most orders containing hematophagous insects
already existed in the Carboniferous period, fleas probably arose in the early Cretaceous, about 120 million years
ago [2], but are thought to have expanded relatively
recently, in the past 50 million years, where they spread
simultaneously with mammals and birds [3]. For comparison, the Culicidae provided a common ancestor for
anopheline and culicine mosquitoes over 150 million
years ago [4], or 100 million years before the spread of
fleas.
In their peculiar adaptation to blood feeding, arthropods
had to prevent hemostasis and inflammatory mechanisms
in the host, because these could disrupt the flow of blood
or alert the host defense behavior. Therefore, arthropods
evolved a salivary cocktail that prevents blood clotting
and platelet aggregation, induces vasodilatation, and
additionally modulates the immune and inflammatory
responses. A large diversity of salivary pharmacologically
active molecules is produced by both unrelated and
related hematophagous insects. For example, in the Hemiptera, the salivary vasodilatation induced by the bed bug
Cimex lectularius and kissing bug Rhodnius prolixus are both
a result of nitric oxide, but they are carried out by completely different NO-carrying molecules; a lipocalin in the
case of Rhodnius [5,6], and a modified inositol phosphatase in the case of Cimex [7,8]. In Diptera, the salivary
anticlotting mechanisms also differ between anophelines
and culicines, where a unique antithrombin molecule
named anophelin is found in the Anopheles [9,10], and a
serpin inhibitor of factor Xa occurs in Aedes aegypti [11].
The enzyme apyrase (ATP-diphosphohydrolase, catalysing the hydrolysis of both ATP and ADP to AMP) is ubiquitously found in the saliva of bloodsucking arthropods,
where it destroys the inducer of platelet aggregation, ADP
and the proinflammatory mediator ATP, released by damaged cells [12]; however, two very different protein families have been recruited to serve this function in insect
saliva. In mosquitoes [13,14] and kissing bugs [15,16], 5'
nucleotidase family members serve this function, while
calcium-dependent Cimex apyrase family members are
found in the bed bug [17] and sand flies [18]. It is clear
that a convergent evolutionary scenario accounts for the
diversity of pharmacologically active salivary components
of hematophagous insects, generating a large diversity of
novel compounds.
Four species of fleas are known to have salivary apyrase
activity, but their enzymatic protein family is unknown
[19,20], while Xenopsylla cheopis (Rots) and Xenopsylla astia
were shown to have salivary anticlotting activity [21].
Hydrolysis of the lipidic agonist platelet activating factor

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/102

(PAF) was also reported for the cat flea, but its molecular
nature is unknown [22]. Other studies on flea saliva
emphasize its allergenic role in human and veterinary
medicine [23,24], including the molecular characterization of several antigens [25,26]. The paucity of salivary
molecular information in fleas is indicated by the presence of only five proteins deposited in GenBank belonging to Siphonaptera and having the keyword 'salivary' (as
in December 6, 2006), all belonging to the cat flea Ctenocephalides felis.
Despite great progress in the last 20 years in the identification of salivary pharmacologically active compounds,
recent salivary transcriptome analysis of different bloodsucking arthropods is revealing a large number of putative
secreted polypeptides for which the modes of action are
unknown, including many novel protein families, some
of which appear to be genus specific [27,28]. In the mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae and Ae.aegypti, over 70 salivary
proteins have been identified; however, the function of
fewer than 20 of these has been identified [28,29]. Given
the phylogenetic distance between fleas and other bloodsucking arthropods, this work attempts to fill a gap in the
knowledge of the salivary repertoire of hematophagous
animals by providing insight into the sialome of the
human vector of plague, X.cheopis. In this work, several
transcripts coding for novel protein and peptide families
are described and their translation into polypeptides confirmed. This work expands our knowledge in the salivary
diversity of bloodsucking animals and, at the same time,
it increases and maps our ignorance on the potential pharmacologic role of these novel protein families. To the
extent that immune responses to flea saliva can control
plague or rickettsial diseases for which fleas are vectors–as
is the case of some other arthropodborne diseases [3032]–this study also provides a platform of potential candidate antigens for future studies.

Results and discussion
cDNA library characteristics
A total of 944 clones were sequenced and used to assemble a database [see additional file 1] that yielded 245 clusters of related sequences, 171 of which contained only
one expressed sequence tag (EST). The consensus
sequence of each cluster is named either a contig (deriving
from two or more sequences) or a singleton (deriving
from a single sequence). For simplicity sake, this paper
uses 'cluster' to denote sequences deriving both from consensus sequences and from singletons. The 245 clusters
were compared using the program BlastX, BlastN, or
RPSBLAST [33] to the nonredundant protein database of
the National Center of Biological Information (NCBI), to
a gene ontology database [34], to the conserved domains
database of the NCBI [35], and to a customprepared sub-

set of the NCBI nucleotide database containing either
mitochondrial or rRNA sequences.
Because the libraries used are unidirectional, the threeframe translations of the dataset were also derived, and
open reading frames (ORF) starting with a methionine
and longer than 40 amino acid (AA) residues were submitted to SignalP server [36] to help identify putative
secreted proteins. The EST assembly, BLAST, and signal
peptide results were loaded into an Excel spreadsheet for
manual annotation.
Four categories of expressed genes derived from the manual annotation of the contigs (Table 1). The putatively
secreted (S) category contained 34% of the clusters and
75% of the sequences, with an average number of 8.4
sequences per cluster. The housekeeping (H) category had
43% and 17% of the clusters and sequences, respectively,
and an average of 1.5 sequences per cluster. Twenty two
percent of the clusters, containing 8.4% of all sequences,
were classified as unknown (U), because no functional
assignment could be made. Similar to the Hgroup, this
category also had an average of 1.5 sequences per cluster.
A good proportion of these transcripts could derive from
3/ or 5/ untranslated regions of genes of the above two categories, as was recently indicated for a sialotranscriptome
of An.gambiae [29]. A possible transposable element originated 21 singletons representing either active transposition or, more likely, expression of transposable element
regulatory transcripts in X.cheopis.
Housekeeping (H) genes
The 106 clusters (comprising 157 EST) attributed to
Hgenes expressed in the salivary glands of X. cheopis were
further characterized into 13 subgroups according to function (Table 2). Not surprisingly for an organ specialized in
secreting polypeptides, the two larger sets were associated
with protein synthesis machinery (82 EST in 44 clusters)
and energy metabolism (15 clusters containing 19 EST), a
pattern also observed in other sialotranscriptomes [3739]. We have also included in the H category a group of
12 EST that grouped into eight clusters, representing conserved proteins of unknown function, presumably associated with cellular metabolism. The fourth most abundant

group, attributed to the protein modification function, is
of interest due to the specialized function of the salivary
glands. This group, comprising five clusters, includes a
chaperone protein and enzymes that are associated with
disulfide bridge formation. Several transporters were also
identified, including those coding for two subunits of the
VATPase complex, which has been shown to be necessary
for mosquito salivation [40,41]. Transcripts coding for
VATPases are a common finding in mosquito sialomes
[37,39,42-44]. The complete list of all 106 gene clusters,
along with further information about each, is given in
additional file 2.
Possibly secreted (S) class of expressed genes
Inspection of additional file 1 indicates the expression of
several expanded gene families, including a family encoding proteins producing a match to KOG3720, indicative
of lysosomal and prostatic acid phosphatases. This family
alone is responsible for 35 clusters comprised of 268
sequences, or over 25% of the salivary library. Mucins are
also represented, as well as an expansion of a peptide family unique to fleas that is related to the cat flea antigen
annotated as FSH precursor (gi¦1575479). Several other
novel peptide families, described in greater detail below,
were also observed.
Preliminary characterisation of the salivary proteome of
X. cheopis
To obtain information on protein expression in the salivary glands of X. cheopis, salivary gland homogenates
(SGH) of approximately 100 pairs of glands were separated by SDS-PAGE. The stained protein bands were
excised from the gel and submitted to tryptic digestion followed by MS/MS identification. Note that the electropherogram is dominated by two broad bands in the
molecular mass range of 40–43 kDa (Figure 1). Only five
slices of the gel shown in Figure 1 yielded useful information by being assigned to predicted sequences from our
clusterized database and to fulllength sequences disclosed
in this work. These results are summarized in Figure 1. To
explore the expression of lower molecular mass polypeptides that were not represented in the SDS-PAGE experiment, we filtered 51 μg of homogenized salivary glands
through a 30-kDa cutoff filter and submitted this filtrate

this filtrate was digested with trypsin prior to LC-MS/MS
analysis. The low molecular weight (MW) filtrate yielded
22 additional matches with secreted proteins, as indicated
in the supplemental Tables S1 and S2. The description of
the identified proteins are embedded in the following
manuscript sections.
Analysis of the adult female Xenopsylla cheopis
sialotranscriptome
Several clusters of sequences coding for housekeeping and
putative secreted polypeptides indicated in additional file
1 are abundant and complete enough to extract consensus
sequences of novel sequences. Additionally, we have performed primer extension studies in several clones to
obtain full-or near full-length sequences of products of
interest. A total of 76 novel sequences, 48 of which code
for putative secreted proteins, are grouped together in
additional file 2.

Following is a detailed description of the full-length transcripts found in the salivary glands of adult X. cheopis:
Putative salivary secreted proteins for which a protein family is known
Enzymes
Phosphatase family
Acid phosphatases catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphate
monoesters and, in some cases, phosphoryl transfer
between a phosphoester and alcohols [45]. These proteins
are widely distributed in animal and plants, occurring in
three different types. One type has a relatively small MW
(18–20 kDa) and is found in mammalian liver, a second
type has a higher MW (45–60 kDa), such as the enzymes
of wheat germ, lysosomes and prostate. The third type are
the purple acid phosphatases, which contain a binuclear
iron center [46]. As listed in additional file 2, eight full-

length transcripts coding for mature proteins ranging
from 36–45 kDa all having a basic (> 8.5) pI were identified in this study. We also report two truncated (at the 5'
end) members of this family. All transcripts of this class
produce similar matches to lysosomal/prostatic acid
phosphatases in the NR and GO databases, as well as to
KOG3720 indicative of lysosomal and prostatic phosphatases. Except for one of the truncated members, several
peptides were identified for each protein originating from
the major band at 40 kDa reported in Figure 1. Edman
degradation of the same band also revealed a strong signal
for the proteins annotated as phos, phos1 and phos 1A.
Alignment of the flea salivary phosphatase sequences with
the vertebrates human, rat and chicken members, as well
as with the venom phosphatase of the bee, a fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and a beetle (Triboleum castaneum)
shows that, except for the first arginyl residue, all flea
sequences do not have the conserved catalytic site residues
as determined by crystal analysis of the human and rat
sequences (shown in red color over yellow background in
Figure 2) [46,47]. Remarkably absent is the histidyl residue located in the conserved motif RHGDR found in all
non-flea sequences. This residue is known to be essential
for catalysis, forming a phosphorylated intermediate during the reaction. All these active site residues experimentally determined for vertebrate enzymes are conserved in
the fly, beetle and bee enzymes, indicating that fleas probably co-opted the acid phosphatase fold for a non-phosphatase function. Indeed, only a few other AA are
conserved across the alignment shown in Figure 2, including the last three cysteines, a region of double aromatic
AAs, and another region of double glycines, among others. Phylograms of the alignments show three distinct
clades (Figure 3). Clade I has all non-flea enzymes, where
three sub-families are found, the vertebrate subfamily

acid phosphatases), or four such enzymes in the human
genome [49].

(with six cysteines, four of which are involved in disulphide bonds) [46], the bee venom enzyme (with only
three cysteines), and the fly and beetle enzymes (with five
and seven cys residues, respectively). Clade II has eight of
the ten flea sequences (with seven cysteines), and contains
the flea sequences with the most conservation to the nonflea members, while clade III has the two most divergent
flea sequences (with five and three cysteines). The odd
number of cysteines in all invertebrate sequences indicate
the possibility of reactive sulfhydryl groups in all
enzymes, including those vertebrate enzymes where two
of the six cysteines are not involved in disulphide bridges.
It is apparent that fleas achieved a unique expansion of
acid phosphatases, at least nine members of which were
identified in the salivary glands using MS/MS. In contrast,
only three genes are found for this class of enzymes in the
An. gambiae proteome (by querying AnoXcel at the anobase site [48]) for the KOG motif lysosomal and prostatic

The real substrate of acid prostatic/lysosomal phosphatases (where the enzyme can achieve 1 mg/ml in
semen) [50] is not known, but it has been suggested that
it can act as a protein tyrosine phosphate phosphatase and
affect cell growth when the enzyme occurs intracellularly
[51,52]. Extracellular protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is known to affect many aspects of cellular
signaling [53,54], and is involved in platelet aggregation
[55-57]. The conserved basic nature of all flea salivary
phosphatases points to interaction with a negatively
charged target. Although the active center of acid phosphatases appear quite open, accepting a diversity of small
substrates, it is possible that the large size of the enzyme
confers some degree of selectivity to the larger phosphorylated protein substrates. This selectivity is analogous to
the large serine proteases that are involved in vertebrate
blood clotting or invertebrate prophenoloxidase activation, which accepts many different small substrates but
are quite specific for their protein substrates. Accordingly,
it is possible that binding some host phosphorylated protein substrate has been the target of flea salivary phosphatases. Perhaps loss of the enzymatic activity kept the
substrate permanently blocked by an inactive interaction,
resulting in a more advantageous complete receptor
blockage. On the other hand, loss of enzymatic function
would require larger amounts of the protein to interact
stoichiometrically with the target host protein, which
might have been the reason for large protein expression
and gene duplication observed, where gene duplication
immediately confers the benefit of increased transcription. With time, gene duplicates may diverge to different
targets, and/or to avoid immune detection by hosts. It is
also possible that this phosphatase family may have
evolved to chelate polyphosphates released by platelets
that recently have been shown to have important hemostatic functions [58]. These considerations should help to
identify the function of the flea salivary phosphatases.
Esterase
Additional file 2 reports two mRNA sequences coding for
esterases, both similar to many insect proteins annotated
as carboxylesterases. The XC-184 translation product of
211 aa is similar to the aminoterminal region of carboxylesterases with sizes varying between 530 and 560 aa [59].
The full polyadenylated transcript has clear polyadenylation sites and cannot transcribe for the larger homolog.
Unless the EST is an artifact, it appears that flea saliva
codes for a truncated version of a carboxylesterase
enzyme. On the other hand, evidence for expression of
the full-length esterase, consistent with a protein product
of ~ 60 kDa, was obtained by the MS/MS experiments
from gel slices 15 and 16 shown in Figure 1. Another este-

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:102

rase is coded by Cluster-136, a truncated mRNA coding
for the carboxy terminus of a different carboxylesterase.
Because we did not obtain the 5' region of this mRNA, we
cannot verify whether the protein product has a signal
peptide indicative of secretion. These mRNA sequences
are included in the putative secreted category due to the
possibility these enzymes may function as PAF hydrolases, as was found with an esterase salivary activity of the
cat flea [22]. Esterases have been also reported in the salivary glands and saliva of both male and female adult Ae.
aegypti mosquitoes [60], but their natural substrate is
unknown.
Apyrase
Five transcripts coding for a homolog of an apyrase member of the CD39 family is the first finding of this type of
gene expressed in the salivary glands of any hematophagous arthropod to date [Additional file 1]. The consensus
sequences shown in additional file 1 indicates the EST are
truncated and match the 3' region of homologous

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/102

sequences, accounting for approximately 50% of the
enzyme. This relatively abundant gene product may
account for the salivary apyrase of this flea species.
Because this activity was never described in X. cheopis, we
investigated whether its SGH could hydrolyze adenosine
nucleotides. Figure 4 indicates, as found for most salivary
homogenates of bloodsucking arthropods, that X.cheopis
has indeed a divalent cation dependent salivary apyrase
activity, that can be activated by either Ca++ or Mg++. This
result is consistent with a CD39 or a 5'-nucleotidase family member, who functions with either divalent cation,
but is not consistent with the Cimex apyrase type found in
bed bugs and sand flies, which are strictly Ca++ dependent.
Protocols involving rapid amplification of cDNA ends
(RACE) were used to obtain the 5' region of the truncated
putative apyrase transcripts, yielding the full-length
sequence coding for XC-APY, shown in additional file 2.
When XC-APY was compared with eight members of the
human CD39 family, plus the soluble potato apyrase
sequence, the four conserved regions of the enzyme fam-

Phylogram of human, rat, chicken, beetle (Triboleum castaneum), fly (Drosophila melanogaster), bee and flea

the NCBI accession number. The numbers in the phylogram indicates the percentage of concordance in 10,000 bootstraps.
The bar at the bottom indicates 20% amino acid distance.

ily are clearly found [61] (Figure 5 – boxed regions).
Except for two human enzymes that are secreted, the
remaining human sequences are membrane bound by
two membrane anchors, one in each of the carboxy- or
aminoterminal regions of the protein, indicated by the
bars above the alignments in Figure 5, and by the predominance of aliphatic AA (shown in turquoise color in Figure
5). These hydrophobic regions coincide with membrane
helices predicted by the TMHMM server, and can be seen
in additional file 3[61]. These carboxyterminal helices are
missing in the two secreted human enzymes [62,63], on
the soluble potato apyrase, and in the flea apyrase (Figure
5). The flea apyrase also contains a clear signal peptide
indicative of secretion, supporting the hypothesis that XC-

apy is responsible for the salivary apyrase of X.cheopis.
Mass spectrometry experiments located this enzyme
within bands 19 and 20 of the gel shown in Figure 1, consistent with a MW of 45-50 kDa, and matching the predicted mass of the mature secreted enzyme of 46.9 kDa.
To the extent that XC-apy is responsible for the observed
salivary apyrase activity of X.cheopis, this will be the first
description of a hematophagous arthropod to have coopted this protein family for this particular activity.
Adenosine deaminase
Three transcripts code for truncated versions of the
enzyme adenosine deaminase [Additional file 1], for
which both transcripts and enzymatic activity were dem-

onstrated in mosquito and sand fly salivary glands
[64,65]. This salivary activity may help to convert mast
cell degranulating adenosine into inosine [66].
Mucins
Three full-length transcripts with signal peptides indicative of secretion code for peptides of mature MW ranging
from 5.5–13 kDa and having 6–12 putative galactosylation sites. They produce no similarity matches to any
known proteins. Two of these products appear to result
from a gene duplication event. Peptides with a high
number of predicted galactosylation sites are regularly
found in other hematophagous insect's sialotranscriptomes. These proteins may help to lubricate the insect
food canal. Evidence for translation of XC-61 was found
in bands 39 and 40 in the gel experiment of Figure 1, and
also in the low MW filtrate. Expression of XC99 was indicated by a peptide match in the digested low MW filtrate.
Antimicrobial peptide
The full-length sequence for an antimicrobial peptide
(AMP) of the defensin family is presented in additional
file 2. Antimicrobial peptides are a regular finding in
sialotranscriptomes of hematophagous insects and ticks.
These peptides, when ingested with the blood meal, help
control bacterial growth in the gut and may also protect
their host-feeding lesions from infection.
Antigen 5 family
This protein family is widely found in the venom of
vespids [67], in the salivary glands of many blood-sucking
insects [37,44,68], and also as a multi-gene family in most
animal genomes such as in Drosophila [69]. These proteins
belong to the larger family of cysteine-rich extracellular
proteins (CRISP) ubiquitously found in animals and
plants [70]. Most proteins have no known function. We
here report a salivary member of the antigen 5 family
found in X. cheopis. Alignment and phylogenetic analysis
of insect members of this family indicates, as expected,
that X. cheopis salivary antigen 5 protein clusters with a
related salivary protein from the cat flea (not shown).
Putative salivary secreted proteins belonging to novel polypeptide
families
FS or antigen1 family
The sialotranscriptome of X. cheopis revealed transcripts
coding for several peptides with similarity to a previously
described antigen of the cat flea named FS-H precursor, as
well as two other cat flea larger proteins named FS-I and
antigen 1 precursors. When the newly discovered peptide
sequences were compared with the whole transcriptome
database (using the tool BlastP with the low complexity
filter off) other related sequences were found, thus creating a group of 15 related products that have in common
solely the presence of eight cysteine residues (Figure 6A),

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/102

the presence of signal peptides indicative of secretion, and
a mature molecular mass varying from 6.3 to 9.2 kDa.
The phylogram (Figure 6B) shows two unrelated groups
of sequences, with strong bootstrap support for the relationship among several sequence pairs, including one pair
consisting of one cat flea and one rat flea sequence. However, the roots of the several clades have weak bootstrap
support indicating that these sequences either originated
from unrelated genes, or more likely, they originated from
gene duplication events with fast divergence from the
ancestral gene. The programs hmmbuild and hmmcalibrate of the hmmer package (version 2.0) [71] were used
to make a hidden Markov model from the alignment
shown in Figure 6A (excluded of the first 20 AA containing most of the signal peptide region). The program
hmmsearch from the same package was used to scan the
NCBI nonredundant protein database with the flea
sequences described here added. Only flea sequences were
retrieved at a significant probability level (< 1e-7). Two
additional sequences were retrieved at much lower significance levels, one being also a flea sequence, and one
plant peptide (Figure 7). When the plant peptide was
compared with the NR database (using BlastP) several
defensinlike molecules from Arabidopsis and Helianthus
were retrieved.
Plant and insect defensins as well as the scorpion toxins
show a high degree of structural conservation despite considerable divergence of sequence [72]. These peptides
adopt a cysteine-stabilized-αβ fold containing a three
stranded β-sheet and a single α-helix [72,73]. The cysteine
sequence motif C...CXXXC...GXC...CXC is conserved in
this group, where X is any amino acid and ... is a variable
interval of AA [72]. The six cysteine residues contained in
the motif form three disulfide bonds, and a fourth
disulfide bond is often present, but its position is variable.
Sequence alignments of FS family of flea salivary peptides
with insect/plant defensins reveal only low overall identity. However, the three disulfide bond cysteine sequence
motif characteristic of defensins and scorpion toxins is
present (Figure 8), making it likely that these peptides
belong to the cysteine stabilized αβ fold group. Insect type
defensins are antimicrobial molecules important for protection against bacteria and fungi [74], while scorpion
toxins are neurotoxic molecules that impair the functions
of sodium and potassium channels [75]. Based on this
similarity, possible functions of this group of peptides
could include, but not be limited to, controlling microbial
growth or analgesic function.
The digested or undigested 30 kDa filtered SGH provided
for MS/MS identification of 11 of the 15 peptides reported
in additional file 2, while the front of the gel shown in Figure 1 allowed for identification of two peptides, also iden-

Methods section).
Other novel peptides
Fifteen other polypeptides are described in additional file
2, all containing a signal peptide indicative of secretion,
and without significant matches to other proteins in the
NR database, except for the peptide named Cluster-149
that is weakly similar to low complexity bacterial proteins.
Two of these peptides appear to be splice variants (XC-42
and XC-43) or products of recent gene duplication. Two
other peptides (XC-3 and XC-56) share significant homology in their signal peptides, but not so much in their
mature peptide sequences. Except for Cluster-149 that
codes for a mature protein of 19.3 kDa, all other peptides
have a predicted weight smaller than 7.8 kDa, six of which
are less than five kDa. XC-105, coding for a mature peptide of 3.9 kDa has a weak SMART match to calcitonin or
calcitonin gene related peptides, the last one being a
potent vasodilator [76]. XC-56 is weakly similar to HIV

gp160 and to patented peptides with inhibitory activity
towards the viral protein binding to the CCR5 receptor.
Cluster-113 peptide has a cysteine scaffold found in the
cysteine rich region of tick salivary metalloproteases, suggestive of an interaction with extracellular matrix elements. XC-2 has sequence homology to patented
decapeptides similar to peptide hormone receptors, and
to small sequence regions of these receptors. XC-68 has
the cysteine scaffold of arthropod defensins, including the
C-X-C carboxyterminus where X is a hydrophobic AA (Ile
in this case). Mass spectrometry experiments indicated in
additional file 2 produced evidence for expression of 9 of
the 15 polypeptides.
Housekeeping proteins
Additional file 2 describes 28 full-length sequences coding for 20 proteins involved in protein synthesis (mostly
ribosomal proteins), two that are part of the proteasome
machinery, one involved in protein modification, one
cytoskeletal protein, one involved in energy metabolism

and two that are uncharacterised, conserved proteins.
These sequences can help in phylogenetic studies and as
controls in future studies with X.cheopis.

Conclusion
Analysis of the salivary transcriptome of the flea X. cheopis
revealed the unique pathways taken in the evolution of
the salivary cocktail of fleas. Gene duplication events led
to large expansions of a family of probably inactive acidic

phosphatases, never found before in any other bloodsucking arthropod, and to the FS family of peptides
unique to fleas. Additionally, over a dozen unique peptides were found. An apyrase-coding transcript of the CD39 family appears as the candidate for the salivary nucleotide hydrolyzing activity in X. cheopis. If this is confirmed,
this will be the first arthropod to have recruited this gene
family for its salivary apyrase activity. Only five other flea
salivary sequences exist at this time at NCBI, all from the

relatively extensive sialome description of any flea species.
Sialotranscriptomes of additional flea genera will reveal
the extent that these novel polypeptide families are common throughout the Siphonaptera.

Methods
Fleas
Intact salivary gland pairs were collected from adult
female X. cheopis fleas. Individual fleas (anesthetized by
chilling on ice) were dissected in 10 μl of PBS on a glass
microscope slide on the stage of a dissecting stereomicroscope. By grasping the dorsal half of the flea above the
forelegs with forceps, pressing down on the abdomen just
posterior to the midgut with a bent dissecting needle, and
pulling, the two pairs of salivary glands and the midgut
would usually remain attached to the head and be pulled
free of the rest of the body. The common lateral salivary
ducts were cut to release each pair, which were then
hooked with a dissecting pin and placed in PBS at 4°C.

Pools of 40 pairs of glands in 20 μl PBS were frozen at
70°C. Glands used for apyrase assays were dissected and
stored in 10 mM TrisHCl and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4
rather than PBS.
Salivary gland isolation and library construction
X. cheopis salivary gland mRNA was isolated from 200 salivary gland pairs from adult fleas using the Micro-FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, SanDiego, CA). The
PCR-based cDNA library was made following the instructions for the SMART cDNA library construction kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). This system utilizes
oligoribonucleotide (SMART IV) to attach an identical
sequence at the 5' end of each reverse-transcribed cDNA
strand. This sequence is then utilized in subsequent PCR
reactions and restriction digests.

First strand synthesis was carried out using PowerScript
reverse transcriptase at 42°C for 1 hr in the presence of the
SMART IV and CDS III (3') primers. Second strand synthe-

sis was performed by a long distance (LD) PCR-based protocol, using Advantage™ Taq Polymerase (Clontech) mix
in the presence of the 5' PCR primer and the CDS III (3')
primer. The cDNA synthesis procedure resulted in the creation of SfiI A &B restriction enzyme sites at the ends of
the PCR products that are used for cloning into the phage
vector. The PCR conditions were: 95°C for 20 sec; 24
cycles of 95°C for 5 sec., 68°C for 6 min. A small portion
of the cDNA obtained by PCR was analysed on a 1.1%
agarose gel to check for the quality and range of cDNA
synthesised. Double stranded cDNA was immediately
treated with proteinase K (0.8 μg/ml) at 45°C for 20 min
and the enzyme was removed by ultrafiltration though a
Microcon (Amicon) YM100 centrifugal filter device. The
cleaned, doublestranded cDNA was then digested with
SfiI at 50°C for 2 hrs, followed by size fractionation on a
ChromaSpin-400 column (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The
profile of the fractions was checked on a 1.1% agarose gel
and fractions containing cDNAs of more than 400 bp
were pooled and concentrated using a Microcon YM100.
The cDNA mixture was ligated into the λ TriplEx2 vector
(Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and the resulting ligation mixture was packaged using the GigaPack® III Plus packaging
extract (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The packaged library was plated by
infecting log phase XL1 Blue E. coli cells (Clontech, Palo
Alto, CA). The percentage of recombinant clones was
determined by performing a blue-white selection screening on LB/MgSO4 plates containing X-gal/IPTG. Recom-

binants were also determined by PCR, using vector
primers (5' λ TriplEx2 Sequencing Primer and 3' λ
TriplEx2 Sequencing) flanking the inserted cDNA and visualising the products on a 1.1% agarose/EtBr gel.
Sequencing of the X. cheopis cDNA library
The X. cheopis salivary gland cDNA library was plated on
LB/MgSO4 plates containing X-gal/IPTG, to an average of
250 plaques per 150 mm Petri plate. Recombinant
(white) plaques were randomly selected and transferred
to 96-well MICROTEST™ U Bottom plates (BD BioSciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ), containing 100 μl of SM
buffer [0.1 M NaCl; 0.01 M MgSO4; 7H2 O; 0.035 M
TrisHCl (pH 7.5); 0.01% gelatin] per well. The plates were
covered and placed on a gyrating shaker for 30 min at
room temperature. The phage suspension was either
immediately used for PCR or stored at 4°C for future use.

To amplify the cDNA using a PCR reaction, four microliters of the phage sample was used as a template. The primers were sequences from the λ TriplEx2 vector and named
pTEx2 5 seq (5'TCC GAG ATC TGG ACG AGC 3') and
pTEx2 3 LD (5' ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG CGA ATT
GGC 3'), positioned at the 5' end and the 3' end of the
cDNA insert, respectively. The reaction was carried out in
96 well flexible PCR plates (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh,
PA) using the TaKaRa EX Taq polymerase (TAKARA Mirus
Bio, Madison, WI), on a Perkin Elmer GeneAmp® PCR system 9700 (Perkin Elmer Corp., Foster City, CA). The PCR
conditions were: one hold of 95°C for 3 min; 25 cycles of

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:102

95°C for 1 min, 61°C for 30 sec; 72°C for 2 min. The
amplified products were analysed on a 1.5% Agarose/EtBr
gel. 1100 cDNA library clones were PCR amplified and the
ones showing single band were selected for sequencing.
Approximately 200–250 ng of each PCR product was
transferred to Thermo-Fast 96-well PCR plates (ABgene
Corp., Epsom, Surray, UK) and frozen at 20°C, before
cycle sequencing using an ABI3730 XL machine.
Bioinformatic tools and procedures used
Expressed sequence tags (EST) were trimmed of primer
and vector sequences, clusterized, and compared with
other databases as described [44]. The BLAST tool [77],
CAP3 assembler [78], ClustalW [79], and Treeview software [80] were used to compare, assemble, and align
sequences and to visualise alignments. For functional
annotation of the transcripts we used the tool BlastX [33]
to compare the nucleotide sequences to the NR protein
database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and to the Gene Ontology (GO) database[34]. The tool RPSBlast [33] was used to search for
conserved protein domains in the Pfam [81], SMART [82],
Kog [83] and Conserved Domains Databases (CDD) [35].
We have also compared the transcripts with other subsets
of mitochondrial and rRNA nucleotide sequences downloaded from NCBI, and to several organism proteomes
downloaded from NCBI (yeast), Flybase (Drosophila melanogaster), or ENSEMBL (An. gambiae). Segments of the
three-frame translations of the EST (because the libraries
were unidirectional we did not use six-frame translations), starting with a methionine found in the first 100
predicted AA, or to the predicted protein translation in the
case of complete coding sequences, were submitted to the
SignalP server [36] to help identify translation products
that could be secreted. O-glycosylation sites on the proteins were predicted with the program NetOGlyc ([84].
Functional annotation of the transcripts was based on all
the comparisons above. Following inspection of all these
results, transcripts were classified as either Secretory (S),
Housekeeping (H) or of Unknown (U) function, with further subdivisions based on function and/or protein families. Phylogenetic analysis and statistical Neighbor Joining
(NJ) bootstrap tests of the phylogenies were done with the
Mega package [85].
Gel electrophoresis studies
Flea salivary proteins representing approximately 100
gland pairs were resolved by one-dimensional (1D)
sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(4–12% gradient gels) and visualised with Coomassie
blue staining (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Excised gel bands
were destained using 50% acetonitrile in 25 mM
NH4HCO3, pH 8.4 and vacuum dried. Trypsin (20 μg/mL
in 25 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.4) was added and the mixture
was incubated on ice for one hr. The supernatant was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/102

removed and the gel bands were covered with 25 mM
NH4HCO3, pH 8.4. After overnight incubation at 37°C,
the tryptic peptides were extracted using 70% acetonitrile,
5% formic acid, and the peptide solution was lyophilised
and desalted using ZipTips (Millipore, Bedford, MA).
Low MW fractionation of flea salivary proteins
A low molecular protein sample was prepared by resuspending 51 μg of total flea protein salivary homogenate
into 2 mL of 100 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.4, containing 10%
acetonitrile. Low MW proteins were obtained by centrifugal ultrafiltration using Centriplus 30 kDa ultrafilters
(Millipore, Billerica, MA) spun at 750 × g at 4°C. The low
MW filtrate was lyophilised and resuspended in 50 μL of
25 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.4, and half of the solution was
digested with trypsin (enzyme:protein ratio of 1:50) for
16 h at 37°C. The undigested and digested samples were
desalted using C18 ZipTips (Millipore, Bedford, MA),
lyophilised to dryness and resuspended in 14 μL 0.1%
TFA for subsequent nanoRPLCMS/MS analysis.
Nanoflow reversedphase liquid chromatography tandem
mass spectrometry (nanoRPLCMS/MS)
The tryptic peptides were analyzed using nanoRPLCMS/
MS. A 75 μm i.d. × 360 μm o.d. × 10 cm long fused silica
capillary column (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ)
was packed with 3 μm, 300 Å pore size C-18 silica bonded
stationary RP particles (Vydac, Hysperia, CA). The column
was connected to an Agilent 1100 nanoLC system (Agilent
Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) that was coupled online
with a linear iontrap (LIT) mass spectrometer (LTQ, ThermoElectron, San Jose, CA). The peptides were separated
using a gradient consisting of mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in water) and B was (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). The peptide samples were injected and gradient
elution was performed under the following conditions:
2% B at 500 nL/min in 30 min; a linear increase of 2–42%
B at 250 nL/min in 110 min; 42–98% in 30 min including
the first 15 min at 250 nL/min and then 15 min at 500 nL/
min; 98% at 500 nL/min for 10 min. The LIT-MS was
operated in a datadependent tandem MS (MS/MS) mode
in which the five most abundant peptide molecular ions
in every MS scan were selected for collision induced dissociation (CID) using a normalized collision energy of 35%.
Dynamic exclusion was applied to minimize repeated
selection of previously analyzed peptides. The capillary
temperature and electrospray voltage were set to 160°C
and 1.5 kV, respectively. Tandem MS spectra from the
nanoRPLCMS/MS analyses were searched against a protein fasta database derived from the flea salivary gland,
using SEQUEST operating on an 18 node Beowulf cluster.
For a peptide to be considered legitimately identified, it
had to achieve stringent charge state and proteolytic cleavage-dependent cross correlation (Xcorr) and a minimum
correlation (ΔCn) score of 0.08.
