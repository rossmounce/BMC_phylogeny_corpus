Abstract
Background: Laribacter hongkongensis is associated with community-acquired gastroenteritis and traveler’s
diarrhea. In this study, we performed an in-depth annotation of the genes and pathways of the general
metabolism of L. hongkongensis and correlated them with its phenotypic characteristics.
Results: The L. hongkongensis genome possesses the pentose phosphate and gluconeogenesis pathways and
tricarboxylic acid and glyoxylate cycles, but incomplete Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas and Entner-Doudoroff pathways,
in agreement with its asaccharolytic phenotype. It contains enzymes for biosynthesis and b-oxidation of saturated
fatty acids, biosynthesis of all 20 universal amino acids and selenocysteine, the latter not observed in Neisseria
gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis and Chromobacterium violaceum. The genome contains a variety of
dehydrogenases, enabling it to utilize different substrates as electron donors. It encodes three terminal cytochrome
oxidases for respiration using oxygen as the electron acceptor under aerobic and microaerophilic conditions and
four reductases for respiration with alternative electron acceptors under anaerobic conditions. The presence of
complete tetrathionate reductase operon may confer survival advantage in mammalian host in association with
diarrhea. The genome contains CDSs for incorporating sulfur and nitrogen by sulfate assimilation, ammonia
assimilation and nitrate reduction. The existence of both glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase/
glutamate synthase pathways suggests an importance of ammonia metabolism in the living environments that it
may encounter.
Conclusions: The L. hongkongensis genome possesses a variety of genes and pathways for carbohydrate, amino
acid and lipid metabolism, respiratory chain and sulfur and nitrogen metabolism. These allow the bacterium to
utilize various substrates for energy production and survive in different environmental niches.

Background
In 2001, Laribacter hongkongensis, a novel genus and
species that belongs to the Neisseriaceae family of bsubclass of the Proteobacteria, was discovered from the
blood and empyema pus of a patient with underlying
alcoholic cirrhosis [1]. Subsequently, it was observed
that L. hongkongensis was associated with freshwater fish
borne community-acquired gastroenteritis and traveler’s
diarrhea in human [2-6]. In addition to its capability of
living under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and
in the intestines of human, a variety of freshwater fish
and frogs, it can also survive and replicate as a free living bacterium in water obtained from drinking water

reservoirs [6-10]. Despite its capability of survival in
diverse environmental conditions, it does not metabolize
any sugar tested [1,3,4,11].
In this article, we present an overview of the general
metabolism of L. hongkongensis based on the information obtained from its genome analysis. The metabolic
pathways of L. hongkongensis were also compared to
those of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis,
Chromobacterium violaceum, Escherichia coli and Campylobacter jejuni. N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis and C.
violaceum are the other three bacterial species in the
Neisseriaceae family of b-Proteobacteria with complete
genome sequences available [12-15]. N. gonorrhoeae and
N. meningitidis are strict aerobes that have stringent
growth requirements and humans are their only known
reservoir and host [16]. Conversely, C. violaceum is

facultative anaerobic, highly versatile in its metabolism,
and can be found abundantly in multiple ecosystems,
including water and soil; and in tropical and subtropical
regions [17]. E. coli is the prototype Gram-negative bacterium with its metabolic pathways dissected in the
greatest detail. C. jejuni is another Gram-negative, Sshaped, motile, asaccharolytic bacillus associated with
gastroenteritis [18].

Results and discussion
The general metabolism discussed in this context mainly
focuses on coding sequences (CDSs) that were classified
into Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) functional
categories of group C (energy production and conversion), G (carbohydrate transport and metabolism), E
(amino acid transport and metabolism), I (lipid transport and metabolism) and P (inorganic ion transport
and metabolism). Overall, the number of CDSs that
were classified into these COGs was 191, 92, 253, 85
and 155 respectively in L. hongkongensis genome. These
numbers are higher than those in N. gonorrhoeae and N.
meningitidis genomes (113, 61, 146, 44 and 96 CDSs
respectively and 120, 67, 156, 52 and 96 CDSs respectively) but lower than those in C. violaceum genome
(208, 203, 423, 139 and 226 CDSs respectively). This
large number of genes in C. violaceum genome is in line
with its ability to survive in a wide range of environments, whereas the relatively smaller number of genes
in the genomes of N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis
reflects their fastidious growth requirements and limited
host ranges. Phylogenetic relationship of L. hongkongensis and other bacteria that are included for comparative
analysis in this study based on 16S rRNA gene shows
that L. hongkongensis is most similar to C. violaceum
within the Neisseriaceae family with complete genome
sequences available (Figure 1). This taxonomic closeness
is also reflected in its gene contents, in which L. hongkongensis shares the highest percentage of CDSs with

Page 2 of 17

C. violaceum (64.1%) compared with other bacteria
(Table 1).
Figure 2 illustrates the deduced central metabolism of
L. hongkongensis from the genomic data. The reconstructed metabolic pathways reconciled the results of
previous physiological and biochemical studies in light
of the metabolic capacity of this strain and showed
remarkable ability to adapt to diverse environment.
Comparison with other Neisseriaceae bacteria, prototype
E. coli and C. jejuni brings to light the unique capabilities of L. hongkongensis. Utilization of compounds as
carbon and energy sources was more restricted than in
C. violaceum, but more extended than N. meningitidis
and N. gonorrhoeae.
Carbohydrate metabolism

In most bacteria, glucose is metabolized through Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway, a pathway that is
also highly conserved in eukaryotes and archaea. Apart
from EMP pathway, some prokaryotes adopt EntnerDoudoroff (ED) pathway for sugar metabolism by priming of 6-carbon sugars and subsequent cleavage into
two 3-carbon intermediates by aldolase enzymes [19].
While some bacteria, such as E. coli and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, have genes for both EMP and ED pathways,
others contain only either one of them, or each pathway
is dedicated for the metabolism of specific 6-carbon
sugar [19]. In L. hongkongensis, both pathways were
incomplete with regards to the predicted genes present
in the genome (Figure 2). The absence of hexokinase, 6phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, which are key
enzymes of EMP pathway, suggested that the bacterium
cannot catabolize glucose through EMP pathway, in
agreement with its asaccharolytic phenotype. Similar
observations are found in other asaccharolytic bacteria
such as C. jejuni, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica, in which the
genes encoding glucokinase and 6-phosphofructokinase

are also absent from their genomes [15,20]. For N.
gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis, although they both
metabolize a variety of sugars, their genomes do not
contain 6-phosphofructokinase gene. Instead, they use
ED pathway for metabolizing the 6-carbon sugars
[12,21]. In the genome of L. hongkongensis, the gene
that encodes one (2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate
aldolase), but not the other (6-phosphogluconate dehydratase), of the two key enzymes of ED pathway is present, suggesting an incomplete pathway exists for
metabolizing 6-carbon sugars through this pathway.
With the inability to utilize exogenous carbohydrates, it
is thus expected that gluconeogenesis would be essential
to generate 6-carbon intermediates required for other
biosynthetic pathways in L. hongkongensis, and the presence of complete gluconeogenic genes is coherent with
this prediction (Figure 2).
In line with the asaccharolytic nature of L. hongkongensis and C. jejuni, both genomes do not contain genes
that encode a complete phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent, sugar transporting phosphotransferase system
(PTS), one of the major carbohydrate transport systems
in bacteria. The genome of L. hongkongensis contains
genes that encode enzyme I, phosphocarrier protein
HPr, HPr kinase/phosphorylase HPrK, enzyme IIANtr
and enzyme IIA fru , whereas none of the genes that
encode any of the components of PTS is present in the
genome of C. jejuni [15]. Similar to L. hongkongensis, N.
meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae also contain cytoplasmic PTS protein homologues including EI, NPr (a variant of HPr) and HPrK together with incomplete
enzyme II homologues although they were both saccharolytic. The presence of other sugar permeases in their
genome suggests that sugars are probably transported
through other pathways. In the genomes of C. violaceum
and E. coli, genes encoding complete PTS protein
homologues (enzyme I and HPr) and multiple types of
enzyme II permeases are present, compatible with their
ability to use a large number of sugars [13,14]. In general, enzyme I and HPr are energy coupling proteins of
the system while complete enzyme II complexes, PTS
permeases, consist of IIA, IIB and IIC domains (as well
as IID domain in the family of mannose). Instead of carbohydrate transport, some enzymes may be involved in
regulation [22]. The presence of enzyme IIA Ntr and
enzyme IIAfru in L. hongkongensis suggested that they
are probably needed for the regulation of other biochemical pathways rather than sugar transport.
Genes encoding enzymes of both non-oxidative and
oxidative branches of pentose phosphate pathway
(PPP) and TCA cycle can be found in the genome of
L. hongkongensis, C. violaceum and E. coli, whereas C.
jejuni lacks the oxidative branch of PPP [11-15].
Although genes that encode enzymes for PPP and

Page 4 of 17

most of TCA cycle are present in the genomes of N.
meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae, the gene for malate
dehydrogenase is absent from both genomes. The presence of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent
malate:quinine oxidoreductase may substitute for the
reaction catalyzed by malate dehydrogenase by oxidizing malate to oxaloacetate, yet experimental analysis
awaits to confirm such prediction [21]. When carbon
sources are metabolized to acetyl-coenzyme A (acetylCoA) instead of pyruvate or phosphoenolpyruvate,
TCA cycle intermediates cannot be replenished
through anaplerotic reactions. A complete pathway for
glyoxylate cycle found in L. hongkongensis provides a
simple and efficient strategy for it to convert acetylCoA into anaplerotic and gluconeogenic compounds
and enables it to grow with C-2 compounds as the
sole carbon source. With glyoxylate pathway, gluconeogenesis, non-oxidative PPP and anaplerotic reactions, L. hongkongensis will therefore be able to
generate different intermediates required for biosynthetic metabolism. The presence of critical anaplerotic
enzymes, including phosphoenolpyruvate synthase and
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, which convert pyruvate and oxaloacetate respectively to phosphoenolpyruvate, together with malate oxidoreductase in L.
hongkongensis reflects its potential to grow on carbon
sources such as malate (Table 2). Malate, together with
succinate and fumarate, are C 4 -dicarboxylates. They
are intermediates in TCA cycle that can be utilized by
bacteria such as E. coli, B. subtilus and many Rhizobium spp. as nonfermentable carbon and/or energy
sources under aerobic or anaerobic conditions [23]. A
number of C 4 -dicarboxylates can be found in nature
such as fermentation products (e.g. succinate) and
complexing agents (e.g. oxalate and malate) [24]. The
presence of several C4-dicarboxylates transporters reinforces the prediction of using C4-dicarboxylates as carbon sources in L. hongkongensis. This is in line with
our experiments on minimal medium for L. hongkongensis which showed that L-malate can be used as sole
carbon source [11].
Amino acid metabolism

Similar to E. coli and C. jejuni, but not N. gonorrhoeae,
N. meningitidis and C. violaceum, the genome of L. hongkongensis contains enzymes for biosynthesis of all 20
universally found amino acids and also selenocysteine.
Selenocysteine (Sec) is an amino acid present in many
species in three domains of life [25,26]. It is encoded by
opal codon (UGA), of which selenoprotein mRNA carries a selenocysteine insertion sequence element immediately downstream to the selenocysteine-encoding UGA
codon [27]. Biosynthesis and incorporation of selenocysteine requires four genes, including selA (encoding Sec

synthase), selB (encoding Sec-specific elongation factor),
selC (encoding tRNASec) and selD (encoding selenophosphate synthetase), whereas ybbB (encoding tRNA 2selenouridine synthase) is needed for utilization. All the
genes required for biosynthesis and incorporation of
selenocysteine are present in the genomes of about 20%
of bacteria with complete genome sequence available,
with a majority in Proteobacteria and Firmicutes [28].
While L. hongkongensis is predicted to synthesize selenocysteine, such ability is not found in C. violaceum, N.
gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis which also belong to bProteobacteria. Although the reason for the selective
presence of selenocysteine in some organisms remains
unknown, it is usually present in the active sites of proteins with redox functions [27]. From the genomic data,
it is predicted that only the most commonly found selenoprotein, alpha subunit of formate dehydrogenase
encoded by fdoG, is present in L. hongkongensis using a
selenoprotein prediction software bSECISearch [28,29].
Similar to C. jejuni, the genome of L. hongkongensis
contains a number of proteases, peptidases and transporters for degradation and transport of proteins or
peptides into oligopeptides or amino acids. The amino
acids can then be degraded intracellularly by various
enzymes (Table 3). These amino acids can be used as
carbon and nitrogen source for the bacterium. The products of the reactions can enter central metabolic pathways including TCA cycle and gluconeogenesis pathway,
and can be used for anabolic and catabolic purposes
(Figure 2 and Table 3).
As predicted from the genomic sequence, several
genes involved in the biosynthesis (amino-acid acetyltransferase gene argA: LHK_02338, LHK_02366; acetylglutamate kinase gene argB: LHK_02337, LHK_02829)
and catabolism (whole operon of arginine deiminase
arcB/A/C/D: LHK_02727-LHK_02734) of arginine are
duplicated in L. hongkongensis, suggesting the importance of arginine metabolism in the bacterium.
Previously, we have shown that the two isoenzymes of

N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase (NAGK) encoded by duplicated copies of argB, NAGK-20 and NAGK-37, which
catalyze the key reaction in the 8-step arginine biosynthesis, gave differential expression pattern in a comparative proteomic study of L. hongkongensis growing at 37°
C (human body temperature) and 20°C (freshwater habitat temperature) [11]. With NAGK-20 showing a higher
expression at 20°C and NAKG-37 showing a higher
expression at 37°C, kinetic analysis revealed that NAGK20 also had a lower optimal temperature for enzymatic
activities and was inhibited by arginine whereas NAGK37 had a higher enzymatic activity with a higher optimal
temperature and was insensitive to arginine inhibition
[11]. These observations suggest the two isoenzymes are
involved in temperature adaptation. Further investigation into the functions of duplicated genes in the metabolic pathway of arginine should yield fruitful insights
into the lifestyle of L. hongkongensis.
Lipid metabolism

Fatty acids are synthesized via repeated cycles of condensation, dehydration and reduction of carbon-carbon
bonds. While the majority of bacterial membranes are
composed of saturated fatty acids, presence of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) can increase the fluidity of the
membrane [30,31]. Similar to the genomes of the other
five bacteria, the genome of L. hongkongensis contains
all the enzymes for biosynthesis of saturated fatty acids
(Table 4). As for UFA biosynthesis, there are two
known sets of enzymes that operate by different
mechanisms: aerobic route and anaerobic route [32]. In
the aerobic route, UFAs are formed by the oxidation of
saturated fatty acids catalyzed by acyl-ACP oxidase
(fatty acid desaturase). In the anaerobic route, trans
double bond is introduced to the acyl chain of
ß-hydroxy-decanoyl-ACP and isomerized to cis-3-decenoyl-ACP by bifunctional 3-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP dehydratase/isomerase (FabA) (encoded by fabA), followed
by 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I (FabB) (encoded by fabB)

route, fabA-fabB is generally restricted to genomes of aand g-Proteobacteria. Therefore, it is not surprising that
the genomes of L. hongkongensis, N. gonorrhoeae, N.
meningitidis and C. violaceum and that of C. jejuni (εProteobacteria) do not contain fabA-fabB. Alternative
pathways for anaerobic UFA biosynthesis in the absence
of fadA and fadB have been reported in other bacteria

which catalyzes the elongation of cis-3-decenoyl-ACP to
form UFAs. This pathway is well-studied in E. coli
[32,33]. The presence of either mechanism is sufficient
for the biosynthesis of UFA. Unlike C. violaceum, which
has the genes for the aerobic UFA biosynthetic pathway,
the genome of L. hongkongensis does not contain the
gene that encodes desaturase. As for the anaerobic

such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, in which a trans-2 to cis-3-decenoyl-ACP isomerase (FabM) can introduce a cis double bond into the
growing acyl chain in the former and the presence of
homologues of FabZ and FabF that can function as
FabA and FabB in the latter [34,35]. Other options such
as dual functions of FabF involved in saturated fatty
acid biosynthesis as FabF and UFA biosynthesis as FabB
has also been reported in Clostridium acetobutylicium
and Lactococcus lactis [36,37]. While L. hongkongensis
contains neither of the alternative fabA, fabB and fabM
genes in its genome, whether its FabF has dual function
is yet to be determined. This phenomenon has also
been observed in the genomes of N. gonorrhoeae and N.
meningitidis. It has been suggested that there may be
uncharacterized enzymes and pathways for unsaturated
fatty acid biosynthesis in these bacteria [38]. Analysis of
membrane phospholipids in L. hongkongensis will reveal
the types of unsaturated fatty acids that it possesses and
help to delineate the possible biosynthetic pathway.
In addition, the presence of two homologues of cyclopropane fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthases (LHK_01324
and LHK_03103) (CFA synthase) suggested the possibility for L. hongkongensis to synthesize cyclopropane fatty
acid. Cyclopropane fatty acids are found in the bacterial
membrane and are believed to be involved in acid resistance in E. coli and in association with virulence and
persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in host
[39,40].
For the catabolism of fatty acids, genes that encode
complete set of enzymes for b-oxidation pathway of
saturated fatty acids are present in the genome of L.
hongkongensis (Table 4). This suggests that L. hongkongensis may utilize these fatty acids as an energy source.
The product of b-oxidation of saturated fatty acids,
acetyl-CoA, will enter TCA cycle. On the other hand,
similar to N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis and C. jejuni,
the genome of L. hongkongensis does not contain any of
the two genes that encode enzymes for catabolism of
unsaturated fatty acids (Table 4).
Respiratory chain

The constituents of the respiratory chain of L. hongkongensis dissected under aerobic and anaerobic growth
conditions revealed the metabolic potential to obtain
energy from various sources. The primary function of
respiratory chain of bacteria is to produce ATP through
the transport of electrons from various electron donors,
usually intermediates of metabolic pathways linked by
quinones or ubiquinones, to various electron acceptors.
The proton gradient generated between the cytoplasm
and periplasm is then dissipated for ATP synthesis by
F1F0 ATP synthase, which is predicted to be present in
the genomes of L. hongkongensis and the other 5 species

compared in this context [32]. The genome of L. hongkongensis contains a plethora of dehydrogenases,
including NADH dehydrogenase I, Rnf type electron
transport complex, succinate dehydrogenase, formate
dehydrogenase, proline dehydrogenase, electron-transferring flavoprotein dehydrogenase, and D-amino acid
dehydrogenase (Table 5). A variety of substrates as electron donors, such as NADH, succinate, formate, proline,
acyl-CoA and D-amino acids appears to be utilized. The
Rnf type electron transport complex was found in the
genomes of L. hongkongensis and E. coli, but not those
of N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, C. violaceum and C.
jejuni. The complex was first discovered in Rhodobacter
capsulatus in 1993 [41]. Although its role is not fully
established, it was proposed to be an alternative enzyme
to NADH dehydrogenase for utilizing NADH as the
electron donor and had been found in many bacteria
[42-44].
As for the final step of the respiratory chain, L. hongkongensis genome encodes three terminal cytochrome
oxidases, namely type aa3 oxidase (a haem-copper oxidase), type cbb3 oxidase (another haem-copper oxidase)
and type bd oxidase (a quinol oxidase). These three
cytochrome oxidases are responsible for carrying out
respiration using oxygen as the electron acceptor under
aerobic conditions (type aa 3 oxidase) and conditions
with reduced oxygen tension (type cbb3 and type bd oxidases) (Table 5). Among the three cytochrome oxidases,
type cbb3oxidase is the most ancient one and is present
in almost all Proteobacteria except anaerobic δ-Proteobacteria [45]. It is characterized by the high affinity for
oxygen which is needed in microaerobic environment.
In addition to cytochrome oxidases, L. hongkongensis
genome also encodes a number of reductases [fumarate
reductase, nitrate reductase, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)
reductase and tetrathionate reductase], which allow the
bacterium to carry out respiration with several alternative electron acceptors to oxygen (fumarate, nitrate,
DMSO and tetrathionate) under anaerobic conditions
(Table 5). The presence of versatile reductases may give
clues to the living habitats of the bacterium where alternative electron acceptors can be found in that environment. The presence of DMSO reductase and
tetrathionate reductase is of particular interest. DMSO
is abundant in aquatic environments which can be produced from the photochemical oxidation of dimethyl
sulfide (DMS) and also from eukaryotic microplankton
[46,47]. It may reflect the environment where L. hongkongensis is found. As for tetrathionate reductase, the
presence of a complete ttr gene cluster suggested that
tetrathionate can be used as an electron acceptor during
anaerobic reduction of tetrathionate to thiosulfate. Notably, L. hongkongensis is the only bacterium that contains
the ttr operon among the family Neisseriaceae members

a
Two types of NADH dehydrogenases (NDH) can function in the respiratory complex I in bacteria. Type I NDH is a proton pumping NADH:ubiquinone
oxidoreductase that transfer electron from NADH to ubiquinone for generation of electrochemical proton gradient [75]. Type II NDH is a monomeric enzyme in
which NADH oxidation is not coupled to proton pumping [76].
b
The gene cluster that encodes NADH dehydrogenase I in most bacteria are consisted of 14 different genes. C. jejuni contains 12 of the 14 genes in which nuoE
and nuoF are absent [15].
c
The basic gene components for periplasmic Nap type nitrate reductase to be regarded as functional are napABCD [68]. C. violaceum contains only napA.

with complete genome sequences available (LHK_01476LHK_01478). Unlike the genes for carbohydrate, lipid
and amino acid metabolism and those of the respiratory
chain which are phylogenetically most related to other
members of the Neisseriaceae, these three genes are
most similar to their homologues in Thiobacillus denitrificans ATCC 25259 and Aromatoleum aromaticum
EbN1 which were both b-Proteobacteria (Figure 3, 4
and 5) [48,49]. The ability to respire tetrathionate is the
characteristics of certain genera of Enterobacteriaceae
including Salmonella, Citrobacter, Yersinia and Proteus
[50]. It was recently reported that tetrathionate respiration provided growth benefit to S. Typhimurium in the
lumen of inflamed intestine over other commensals/
microbiota inhabited in the gut [51]. Previously, only
the source of thiosulfate, but not tetrathionate, was
known in mammalian hosts. Toxic hydrogen sulphide
gas produced by colonic bacteria in the intestine is
detoxified by colonic muscosa into thiosulfates, thus a
large quantity is present in the intestinal lumen [52,53].

It is now established that thiosulfate can be converted
to tetrathionate upon reaction with reactive oxygen species that are generated during inflammation [51]. The
presence of complete ttr gene cluster in L. hongkongensis
genome suggests that it may confer survival advantage
in mammalian host in association with diarrhea. On the
other hand, the source of tetrathionate in nature is not
clear, but it seems likely to occur in bacterial communities that include sulfate-reducing bacteria as it has
been detected in humid soils that support growth of
such bacteria [50].
Sulfur metabolism

Sulfur is a constituent of amino acids cysteine and
methionine, and also found in various coenzymes and
other metabolites. The major form of inorganic sulfur in
nature, sulfate, is usually incorporated into bacteria as
organic compound through the pathway of sulfate
assimilation. With the ability to synthesize L-cysteine
and L-methionine, L. hongkongensis is expected to

undergo sulfate assimilation with reduction of inorganic
sulfate to sulfide and enter L-cysteine and L-methionine
biosynthetic pathways. There are two pathways for
intracellular sulfate to be reduced to sulfite and further
to sulfide in bacteria, which differ in the form of activated sulfate as input (Figure 6A). The first pathway,
commonly but not exclusively found in enteric bacteria
such as E. coli and traditionally assumed to be used by
the majority of bacteria, converts adenosine 5’-adenylylsulfate (APS) to 3’-phosphoadenylylsulfate (PAPS) via
adenylylsulfate kinase CysC, where PAPS is eventually
reduced to sulfite by PAPS reductase [54]. On the other
hand, the second pathway which was originally

identified in plants and subsequently found in other
bacterial taxa including P. aeruginosa, other members of
a-, b- and g-Proteobacteria and M. tuberculosis, reduces
APS to sulfite directly by APS reductase [55,56]. Bacterial PAPS reductase and APS reductase are highly homologous and the major difference is the presence of
conserved two-cysteine motifs in APS reductase [55-57].
Phylogenetic analysis showed that APS reductase from
plant and many bacteria such as Pseudomonas, Rhizobium (Sinorhizobium) and M. tuberculosis clustered
together [55]. The enzyme is also assumed to be typical
in b-Proteobacteria as phylogenetic analysis of the gene
components suggests that homologues of APS reductase

with the characteristic two-cysteine motifs are prevalently found in this group of bacteria [55]. The characteristic two-cysteine motifs, CCXXRKXXPL and
SXGCXXCT, are found in the C termini of all APS
reductases, but not in PAPS reductases [56]. The twocysteine residues are reported to be involved for the
binding to the iron-sulfur cluster in plant, P. aeruginosa
and M. tuberculosis, which contribute to the difference
in substrate specificity [58,59]. However, as this pathway
has not been well characterized among b-Proteobacteria,
the role of APS reductase in sulfate assimilation is
uncertain in these bacterial taxa. As PAPS reductase has

absolute substrate requirement, the product of the APS
kinase, PAPS, is essential for E. coli to assimilate sulfate
[54]. While the genomes of C. violaceum and E. coli are
predicted to contain homologues of sulfate adenylyltransferase, APS kinase, PAPS reductase and sulfite
reductase, which can encode for a complete sulfate
assimilation pathway via PAPS, L. hongkongensis and N.
meningitidis seem to utilize the other pathway. Sequence
analysis revealed that L. hongkongensis and N. meningitidis contain homologues of APS reductase with the characteristic two-cysteine motifs, and the absence of APS
kinase homologue in the genomes suggested that the

reduction of sulfate to sulfite in these bacteria may not
involve PAPS intermediates (Figure 6B and Table 6).
Although the predicted PAPS reductase in C. violaceum
also has the characteristic two-cysteine motifs of APS
reductase (Figure 6B), it remains uncertain whether this
protein catalyzes PAPS or APS.
Nitrogen metabolism

Nitrogen is an essential component in organisms that
constitutes vital biomolecules such as protein and
nucleic acids. Bacteria can utilize different kinds of
nitrogen compounds, including inorganic compounds
such as ammonia, urea and nitrate; and organic complex

compounds such as amino acids and nucleosides, as
sources of cellular nitrogen. There are two general pathways found widely in bacteria for ammonia assimilation.
After transport across the cytoplasmic membrane into
the bacterial cell, ammonia can be incorporated into
glutamate or glutamine by glutamate dehydrogenase
(GDH) or glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase (GS/
GOGAT) pathway [32]. The two pathways differ according to the level of nitrogen present in the environment.
When nitrogen concentration is high, ammonia assimilation via GDH is preferred as no ATP is consumed
when glutamate is produced from oxoglutarate and
ammonium. However, when nitrogen concentration is

Figure 6 Sulfate assimilation in L. hongkongensis HLHK9. (A) Sulfate assimilation pathways in bacteria. Two pathways exist in bacteria which
differ in the form of sulfate being activated. In one pathway that was once assumed to be the only one, APS is converted to PAPS by APS
kinase and subsequently reduced to sulfite by PAPS reductase (green arrow). In the other pathway, APS is directly reduced to sulfite by APS
reductase (orange arrow). Homologues of genes found in L. hongkongensis HLHK9 were specified with gene numbers in blue. APS, adenosine 5’adenylylsulfate; PAPS, 3’-phosphoadenylylsulfate. (B) Multiple sequence alignment of predicted APS reductase in L. hongkongensis with other

a
Bacterial PAPS reductase and APS reductase are highly homologous and both of their gene designation are cysH which may represent a PAPS reductase or APS
reductase [58].
b
Predicted amino acid sequences encoded by cysH (CV_3574) in C. violaceum has the characteristic two-cysteine motifs of APS reductase and the presence of
cysC suggests an ambiguity (represent by “?”) in the identity of CV_3574 as PAPS or APS reductase.

low, which is the case in most natural environment,
ammonia is assimilated through GS/GOGAT pathway.
L-glutamine is produced from L-glutamic acid and
ammonia by GS in utilizing ATP and two molecules of
L-glutamic acid are subsequently synthesized from Lglutamine and oxoglutarate by GOGAT because GDH
has a lower affinity for ammonia. Similar to E. coli, L.
hongkongensis has genes that participated in GDH and
GS/GOGAT pathways, including gdhA that encodes
NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase, gltB/gltD
that encode glutamate synthase and glnA that encodes
glutamine synthetase (Table 7). On the other hand, the
genomes of C. violaceum and C. jejuni contain only
genes in GS/GOGAT pathway whereas those of N.
meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae contain solely genes of
GS pathway. The ability of L. hongkongensis to utilize
nitrogen is quite diverse. The existence of both pathways in L. hongkongnesis suggests an importance of
ammonia metabolism in the living environments that it
may encounter. Ammonia can be found in natural
environment such as natural water and being the form
of excretory waste in fish, where L. hongkongensis had
been reported to be isolated from [6,10,60].
In addition to its presence in the natural environment,
ammonia can also be provided by alternative nitrogen
sources such as urea. Urea can be hydrolyzed to ammonia and carbon dioxide by urease, in which a complete
urease gene cluster is found in L. hongkongensis and
none in N. meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae, C. violaceum,
E. coli and C. jejuni (Table 7). Ammonia formed in this

process not only can provide nutrient nitrogen, but may
also help L. hongkongensis to resist acid shock during its
transit through the highly acidic environment of stomach by raising pH. With alternative way to metabolize
different nitrogen source such as from urea, L. hongkongensis can gain some survival advantages under nitrogen-limited conditions. The dual role in acid resistance
and nitrogen metabolism of urease was evident in bacteria such as Streptococcus salivarius, Helicboacter pylori
and Yersinia enterocolitica [61-63]. Investigation into
the roles of urease in L. hongkongensis can provide
insights towards the interplay of both functions and
understanding about its survival strategy. Urea can be
found in various environments in which L. hongkongensis can be found, including natural water and human
host, where urea is present in a range of concentration
in different parts ranging from saliva, stomach, blood to
urine [64-67].
Alternatively, nitrate is another common form of
nitrogen compounds found in the environment. By
reducing nitrate, the majority of bacteria can incorporate
nitrogen into building blocks, produce energy for cellular processes or dissipate excess energy by respiration
[68]. There are three types of bacterial nitrate reductases
which are classified according to their localizations and
functions, namely the assimilatory (Nas type), membrane-bound (Nar-type) and periplasmic (Nap-type), of
which the Nas type is used for incorporating nitrate into
building blocks [68,69]. In the assimilatory pathway,
nitrate is first converted to nitrite by assimilatory nitrate

reductase and then to ammonium by nitrite reductase
such that it can be incorporated into cell materials.
Absence of the genes that encode Nas type nitrate
reductase and nitrite reductase in L. hongkongensis genome suggested that no assimilatory pathway is present.
For the respiratory pathway which mainly involved Nar
and Nap type, while E. coli contains both types of
nitrate reductases, L. hongkongensis and C. jejuni contain
only periplasmic nitrate reductase whereas C. violaceum
contains the membrane-bound type (Table 7). Even
though C. violaceum contains napA that belongs to Nap
system, the absence of other gene components suggested
that this pathway is incomplete and probably non-functional. On the other hand, no homologues of nitrate
reductases are found in N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae. The membrane-bound nitrate reductase,
encoded by NarGHI operon, can be found in many
nitrate-respiring and denitrifying bacteria and functions
as the generator of proton motive force by coupling
nitrate reduction in respiration. In contrast to Nar, the
function of Nap is much diverse and appears to differ
among bacteria. Apart from its involvement in anaerobic
respiration in bacteria such as E. coli, it can have other
physiological roles such as participating in redox balancing for optimal bacterial growth under certain physiological conditions and aerobic denitrification switch
from aerobic respiration to denitrification or scavenges
nitrate in some pathogenic bacteria [68]. The gene composition and ordering of nap gene cluster shows heterogenicity amongst different bacteria, with napD and
napA as the only genes that are always found in the
cluster [68]. In L. hongkongensis, it is predicted that nap
operon contains 7 genes, napFDAGHBC, with the same
gene composition and order as in E. coli. The ability for

nitrate reduction in L. hongkongensis suggested that Nap
type nitrate reductase is functional [1,3,11]. Apart from
the above pathways, an absence of nitric oxide reductase
in L. hongkongensis suggested that dissimilatory pathway
for the production of dinitrogen is not operational.

Conclusions
The L. hongkongensis genome possesses a variety of
genes and pathways for carbohydrate, amino acid and
lipid metabolism, respiratory chain and sulfur and nitrogen metabolism. These allow the bacterium to utilize
various substrates for energy production and survive in
different environmental niches.
Methods
CDSs identified in the L. hongkongensis genome were
annotated as described in our previous publication and
classified functionally according to the COG methodology [11]. Annotated genes were mapped to pathways
according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database and MetaCyc to help identify
metabolic pathways, and refined with thorough literature
mining and experimental data [70,71]. When “gap”
exists in the metabolic pathways, reciprocal-best-hit
search was adopted to identify orthologues using experimentally verified protein sequence as query. CDSs
belonging to metabolism-related COG clusters (C, G, E,
I, and P) were selected for further examination and
review. Other CDSs of potential interest were identified
by keyword search using the names of common amino
acids, carbohydrates, nucleotides, coenzymes, lipids,
inorganic ions and metabolites. Manual annotation and
analysis of the assigned function was performed by
sequence similarity search using BLAST against the

Curreem et al. Cell & Bioscience 2011, 1:16

NCBI nr database, and assisted by conserved domain
search (CD-search), identification of signature sequence
motifs and sequence analysis using InterProScan. Localization patterns were predicted using PSORTb where
appropriate [72]. Comparison of CDSs belonging to
metabolism-related COG clusters among L. hongkongensis HLHK9, C. violaceum ATCC 12472, N. meningitidis
MC58, N. gonorrhoeae FA 1090, E. coli K12 MG1655
and C. jejuni NCTC 11168 was performed using KEGG
database, MetaCyc and Integrated Microbial Genomes
(IMG) database [73]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method with MEGA
4.0 using Kimura’s two-parameter correction for 16S
rRNA gene and Poisson correction for tetrathionate
reductase [74]. 1553 nucleotide positions of 16S rRNA
gene, and 1026, 233 and 389 amino acid positions of
ttrA, ttrB and ttrC genes encoded proteins respectively
were included in the analysis.
