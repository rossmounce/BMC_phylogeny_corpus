Abstract
Background: Mitochondrial genomes provide a rich source of molecular variation of proven and widespread utility
in molecular ecology, population genetics and evolutionary biology. The tapeworm genus Taenia includes a
diversity of tapeworm parasites of significant human and veterinary importance. Here we add complete sequences
of the mt genomes of T. multiceps, T. hydatigena and T. pisiformis, to a data set of 4 published mtDNAs in the
same genus. Seven complete mt genomes of Taenia species are used to compare and contrast variation within
and between genomes in the genus, to estimate a phylogeny for the genus, and to develop novel molecular
markers as part of an extended mitochondrial toolkit.
Results: The complete circular mtDNAs of T. multiceps, T. hydatigena and T. pisiformis were 13,693, 13,492 and
13,387 bp in size respectively, comprising the usual complement of flatworm genes. Start and stop codons of
protein coding genes included those found commonly amongst other platyhelminth mt genomes, but the much
rarer initiation codon GTT was inferred for the gene atp6 in T. pisiformis. Phylogenetic analysis of mtDNAs offered
novel estimates of the interrelationships of Taenia. Sliding window analyses showed nad6, nad5, atp6, nad3 and
nad2 are amongst the most variable of genes per unit length, with the highest peaks in nucleotide diversity found
in nad5. New primer pairs capable of amplifying fragments of variable DNA in nad1, rrnS and nad5 genes were
designed in silico and tested as possible alternatives to existing mitochondrial markers for Taenia.
Conclusions: With the availability of complete mtDNAs of 7 Taenia species, we have shown that analysis of amino
acids provides a robust estimate of phylogeny for the genus that differs markedly from morphological estimates or
those using partial genes; with implications for understanding the evolutionary radiation of important Taenia. Full
alignment of the nucleotides of Taenia mtDNAs and sliding window analysis suggests numerous alternative gene
regions are likely to capture greater nucleotide variation than those currently pursued as molecular markers. New
PCR primers developed from a comparative mitogenomic analysis of Taenia species, extend the use of
mitochondrial markers for molecular ecology, population genetics and diagnostics.

Background
Tapeworms of the genus Taenia (Linnaeus, 1758)
include parasites of mammals that use carnivores as
definitive hosts, and herbivores (or omnivores) as intermediate hosts. Humans may be infected by both adult
and larval forms (of various species), causing taeniosis
or cysticercosis respectively. As with all species of tapeworm, transmission from host to host follows a trophic
pathway via ingestion. However, species of Taenia are
unique amongst the Cestoda in requiring two obligate
mammalian hosts for transmission and life cycle completion; egg to herbivore, herbivore to carnivore, the
cestode matures in the carnivore and releases fertilized
eggs [1]. Taenia also enters humans trophically, through
the inadvertent consumption of eggs or larval stages
present in undercooked meat. Human Taenia species
include T. saginata Goeze, 1782, T. asiatica Eom &
Rim, 1993, and T. solium Linnaeus, 1758, with the following zoonotic species also found in humans: T. taeniaeformis (Batsch, 1786), T. crassiceps (Zeder, 1800),
T. multiceps Leske, 1780, and T. serialis (Gervais, 1847).
Species of Taenia cause significant health problems and
considerable socio-economic losses when infecting
humans and livestock [2]; human neurocysticercosis is
the most common helminth infection of the central nervous system and has considerable societal impact in
endemic areas [3-5]. The genus is widespread globally,
with hotspots of prevalence in humans related to diet,
social conditions, cultural practices and poverty. In the
wild prevalence is dictated by specific predator-prey
interactions, and there is little doubt their influence on
host ecology is significant [6,7].
Historically, as an old genus, Taenia (Cestoda, Taeniidae) has become somewhat of a ‘catch-all’ taxon for
tapeworm systematics, with upwards of 70 nominal species having been attributed to Taenia. Species circumscription based on morphology has been, and remains,
problematic. Approximately 42 valid species and 3 subspecies are recognized currently [1], circumscribed predominantly on the basis of adult morphology; other
names persist and largely arise from descriptions of larval stages or the use of some of the many synonyms
[6,8-10]. There are conflicting estimates of phylogeny
from morphology and various molecular markers, thus
preventing a full understanding of the evolutionary history with their hosts through space and time. Taenia is
one of only two genera in the Taeniidae. The other
genus in the family, Echinococcus, is also of importance
as it causes morbidity in humans and livestock [11-13].
As a result of their importance, species of these two
genera have been studied extensively, but relatively little
is understood about their biology in the context of
molecular ecology, epidemiology or control. Much of

Page 2 of 13

this comes from an inability to quickly, or accurately,
diagnose species or to track populations. In many endemic areas diseases caused by human Taenia are often
categorized as ‘neglected tropical diseases’ [5].
As is widely recognized for many parasites, knowledge
of life cycles, mechanisms and dynamics of transmission
and infection, all form the basis for effective control
strategies [12,14-16]. Molecular tools are increasingly
used to develop these areas of knowledge, and here we
take a comparative mitogenomic approach to evaluate
mitochondrial (mt) DNAs as a source of new molecular
markers.
Mitochondrial genes are amongst the most popular
markers for molecular-based approaches to ecology,
population genetics and evolutionary biology and have
been popular targets for molecular-based methods of
species identification [17-19]. Multiplex PCR approaches
to diagnose mixed infections of Taenia are also being
developed and are targeted for PCR-RFLP analysis using
mt cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) and cytb
[20,21]. Certain genes and gene regions have become
popular choices as representative mitochondrial markers, because they are bordered by regions of sequence
conservation (e.g. cox1) and ‘universal’ (or at least
broadly conserved) PCR primer sets can be readily
designed. This is also the case for helminths, where mt
gene fragments have been used routinely for population
genetics, ecology and diagnostics [22,23]. More recently,
the ability to readily characterize complete helminth
mtDNAs, by means of long PCR and a variety of
sequencing techniques [24,25], has prompted an assessment of entire genomes as a source for phylogenetic
analysis [26-29], and their comparison to reveal variation within and between genes in order to develop novel
(or optimise existing) molecular markers [30,31]. Mitochondrial genomes of bilaterian animals are short, circular DNA molecules typically 14-16 kb in length, without
introns and with short intergenic regions. Gene content
is highly conserved with typically 12 protein coding
genes in Platyhelminthes (they lack the gene for ATP
synthase subunit 8, atp8), two ribosomal subunits and
22 tRNAs. Mitochondrial gene rearrangement is not
uncommon in flatworms, occurring within the genus
Schistosoma [32,33], in some monogeneans [27] and
appears to be different in at least some turbellarians
[34]. Evidence suggests that gene order is otherwise generally conserved in tapeworms (Cestoda) and flukes
(Trematoda) [35].
Complete mtDNAs offer variation over multiple levels
of organization, from gene content and gene order to
variation in amino acids and nucleotides, offering opportunities to resolve both recent and ancient divergence
events. Here we characterize the complete mt genomes

of T. multiceps Leske, 1780, T. hydatigena Pallas, 1766 and
T. pisiformis (Bloch, 1780), each of intrinsic interest. Coenurosis is a debilitating disease caused by the metacestode
(larval forms) of T. multiceps and is common in sheep and
other herbivores. Humans may also be infected with the
metacestode occasionally [36]; infections occur when eggs
are ingested via the fecal-oral route of transmission. Infective eggs hatch, and the liberated oncospheres cross the
membrane of the small intestine and migrate within the
body, typically ending up in the central nervous system,
mesentery and visceral organs [37,38]. Within the host’s
tissues, the oncospheres mature into coenuri or cysticerci
causing the metacestodiasis. Amongst carnivores, each of
these 3 species is cosmopolitan in canines and T. hydatigena and T. pisiformis are also found in felines. In China,
sheep are the most common hosts for metacestodes of
T. multiceps and T. hydatigena, and lagomorphs are the
most common hosts of T. pisiformis tapeworms; their distribution across China and surrounding countries is extensive [39-41]. Each of the species characterized here is
found globally, and mixed infections with other taeniids
are common. For accurate diagnosis, there is a need to
identify individual species from mixed infections of tapeworms whether in intermediate or definitive hosts. Differentiating adult worms using morphology alone requires
taxonomic expertise, but to differentiate amongst mixed
populations of eggs and larvae requires molecular techniques [42]. Once developed, molecular techniques can be
readily applied to portions of adult worms, larvae, eggs
and environmental samples and should aid in accurate,
rapid identification.
Among the genus Taenia, complete mt genome
sequences are already available for T. asiatica, T. saginata, T. solium and T. crassiceps [32,43,44]. We use these
sequences with the new data to achieve three goals.
Firstly, we evaluate the potential for complete mt genomes in estimating the phylogeny of the genus and
revealing its evolutionary history. Taenia is a species-rich
genus with a widespread distribution but there are conflicting estimates of phylogeny from morphology and various molecular markers. Secondly, we use comparative
mitogenomics to highlight regions of nucleotide variation
amongst Taenia species to investigate whether mitochondrial gene fragments currently used as molecular
markers offer the best regions for characterization,
whether for species recognition or other molecular-based
applications. Third, we take an in silico approach to
developing PCR primer pairs designed to amplify short
fragments of mtDNAs for all species (for which entire mt
genomes have been characterized), with a view to providing primers that will work for all Taenia species capturing high levels of variation in mtDNAs, and we test some
of these primers to demonstrate their efficacy.

Results and Discussion
General features of the mt genome of 3 Taenia species

The mtDNAs of cestodes are similar to those of other
eumetazoans with respect to length, gene composition,
and the structures of their tRNA and rRNA molecules
[32,43,44]. The complete mtDNA sequences of T. multiceps, T. hydatigena and T. pisiformis were 13,693 bp,
13,492 bp and 13,387 bp in length, respectively, of
which T. pisiformis mtDNA sequence is the smallest
among the Platyhelminthes studied to date (Table 1).
Yap et al. [45] reported that restriction mapping of the
T. hydatigena mt genome suggested it to be 17.6 kb, but
no published complete mt genomes sequences from taeniids have been more than 15 kb in length. The size of
T. pisiformis mtDNA in this study is also among the
smallest reported for metazoans; only 5 other metazoan
mtDNAs are known to be smaller [35]. In general, gene
size, organization, codon use and nucleotide content are
very similar amongst the newly sequenced Taenia species and those already characterized.
Each of the 3 mtDNAs contained 36 genes lacking
ATP synthase subunit 8 gene (atp8), of which 12 were
protein-coding genes (atp6, cytochrome c oxidase subunits 1, 2 and 3 [cox1-cox3], cytochrome b [cytb] and
nicotinamide dehydrogenase subunits 1-6 [nad1-nad6]
and 4L [nad4L]), 22 were tRNA genes (two coding for
leucine, and two coding for serine) and the small [rrnS]
and large [rrnL] subunits of rRNA, as found in other
Platyhelminthes [46]. The mt gene arrangements of
these 3 cestodes are identical to that of other taeniids
and only slightly different from that of Hymenolepis
diminuta by the reversal in order of trnS2 and trnL1
[32,47].
All genes are transcribed in the same direction. Some
genes overlap in the mtDNAs, which is also true for
other flatworm species. The 3′-end of nad4L overlaps
with the 5′-end of nad4 as observed in all flatworms;
length of overlaps is the same (34 bp) in all Taenia
species [48,49]. However, in the published annotations
of E. multilocularis (NC_000928) and T. solium
(NC_004022), nad4L and nad4 do not overlap, which
needs to be revised according to our alignment; in these
cases nad4L ends on legitimate stop codons before
nad4 begins [43,50] and there are no indications from
our alignment that they are incorrect. Additional gene
overlaps were observed between 3′-end of cox1 and the
5′-end of trnT (15 bp), between trnQ and trnF, and trnF
and trnM (1-5 bp). A full list of inferred gene boundaries and lengths are given in Table 1.
As with other flatworm mtDNAs, the nucleotide compositions of the new sequences are biased toward T and
A, with T being the most favored nucleotide and C the
least favored [46]. AT-richness in T. multiceps is 71.3%

Start and stop codons for protein-coding genes as well as lengths of their predicted amino acid sequences and tRNA gene anticodons (starting from trnG). SNR
and LNR refer to short and long non-coding regions respectively.

(24.4% A, 46.9% T, 20.3% G and 8.4% C), in T. hydatigena is 70.9% (24.9% A, 46.0% T, 20.3% G and 8.8% C) the lowest for any taeniid studied to date - and in T.
pisiformis 73.2% (27.7% A, 45.5% T, 18.0% G and 8.8%
C), shown in Additional file 1. AT-bias in Taenia species is higher than amongst Echinococcus species, but
not unusual amongst cestodes [49]. Amongst protein
coding genes AT-content varies from 68.2 to 74.7%.
Amongst Taenia species cytochrome c oxidase genes

tend to have lower, or the lowest, AT-content [32,43]
and long (LNR) and short non-coding regions (SNR)
tend to have the highest AT-content (73.5-82.1%).
Flatworms employ an unusual mitochondrial code for
translating codons into amino acids [51,52]. GTG is
being proposed as an alternative initiation codon to
ATG in nad3 and cox3 genes of T. hydatigena, in cox3
of T. pisiformis and in nad2 and nad6 genes of T. multiceps. We also infer an even more unusual start codon,

Jia et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:447
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/447

GTT, in atp6 of T. pisiformis; this has been suggested
for cox1 of E. granulosus (G4 strain, AF346403) [15] and
H. diminuta (NC_002767) [47]. To avoid potential
sequencing errors, we confirmed GTT as a start codon
in T. pisiformis by sequencing the region (doublestranded) five times using PCR products directly and
cloned recombinant plasmids from two isolates of
T. pisiformis cysticerci. Two abbreviated stop codons
were also found in mt protein-coding genes nad3 and
cox3 of T. pisiformis, as found in nad3 and cox3 of
Diphyllobothrium latum, D. nihonkaiense [49,53,54] and
Spirometra erinaceieuropaei (GenBank NC_011037),
shown in Additional file 2.
Structure of tRNAs

Using ARWEN [55] nearly all 22 tRNAs, with the conventional secondary structures, were found for each mt
genome. Remaining tRNAs were identified using alignment and inferred secondary structures (Additional file
3). Mitochondrial tRNA genes were 55-74 bp long, and
the predicted secondary structures of 18 of these had
typical clover-leaf shapes with paired dihydrouridine
(DHU) arms. The trnC, trnR and two trnS tRNAs contained a predicted secondary structure with the TΨC
arm and loop but lacked the DHU arm and loop, as
found in some other platyhelminth mtDNAs [15,54].
Anticodons in all 22 tRNAs for all Taenia species are
conserved without mutations. The first two nucleotides
preceding the anticodons are almost always thymidine,
the first nucleotide following the anticodons is usually
adenosine or guanosine, and the second is guanosine.
Structure of SNR and LNR

The non-coding regions of the mt genomes of T. multiceps, T. hydatigena and T. pisiformis comprised 2 major
regions: a short non-coding region (SNR) or NR1 (73,
64 and 67 nucleotides, respectively) and a long non-coding region (LNR) or NR2 (176, 135 and 64 nucleotides,
respectively). Among published taeniid mtDNAs the
LNR of T. pisiformis is the shortest. SNR and LNR were
located between trnY and trnL1 (UCN), and nad5 and
trnG, respectively.
In the LNR regions of T. multiceps and T. hydatigena
mt genomes and the NR2 of T. pisiformis mt genome,
there were sets of short inverted repeats (Additional file
4). One could be folded into a hairpin structure characterized by 4 to 6 consecutive G_C or inconsecutive base
pairs at the upside of the stem. Although the SNR and
NR1 were short, there was at least one inverted
sequence in these regions. A significantly stable potential secondary structure containing a stem-loop could be
folded using SNR or NR1. Similar inverted sequences
and stem-loop secondary or hairpin structure are also
found in these two regions of other taeniid mt genomes

Page 5 of 13

[43,50]. Besides LNR of T. multiceps mt genome, one
inverted repeat sequence (5′-ATATATATACGGGGGCCCCGTATATATAT-3′) was displayed in LNR of T.
asiatica, T. saginata, T. solium and T. crassiceps mt genomes, and another similar inverted sequence (5′-ATATATAGAGAGAGGGG-CCCCTCTCTCTATATAT-3′)
appeared also in NR2 of T. pisiformis mtDNA. Stable
hairpin structures, such as those identified in the LNR
and the SNR of taeniid mtDNAs [43,47], likely contain
the origins of replication and transcription [56].
Phylogeny of Taenia

Using a variety of shared characteristics including those
defining adult morphology (particularly the organization
of male and female reproductive organs) and larval
structure, Hoberg et al. [6] compiled 27 characters for
30 species of Taenia. Parsimony analysis found 4 equally
parsimonious trees, and the consensus tree has since
been used to infer patterns of intermediate and definitive host association [1]. Inferred switching between carnivore definitive hosts led Hoberg [1] to conclude that
ecological shifts have been greatly responsible for the
patterns of radiation in Taenia. This study highlighted
the likely role of climatological and ecological perturbation in influencing host-parasite associations in the
genus. The morphology-based phylogeny has not been
supported by partial molecular data sets from subsets of
taxa, but establishing a reliable phylogeny for the genus
clearly has important consequences.
Early attempts to infer molecular phylogenies of Taenia have been hampered by the availability of different
species, and the application of relatively crude models of
molecular evolution. Nevertheless, two studies provide
perspective in assessing estimates from new complete
mtDNA and the morphological data. De Queiroz and
Alkire [57] compiled available partial cox1 data and partial nuclear large subunit (28S) rDNA data to infer a
phylogeny including 11 species of Taenia. Lavikainen
et al. [58] sampled multiple isolates of 9 Taenia species
for partial cox1 and partial nad1 genes; this built on
data collected by Gasser et al. [59]. In each of these studies, all the species for which complete mtDNAs are
now available were included, thus allowing direct comparison of phylogenetic estimates of 7 species of Taenia.
Alignment of all protein-coding genes of Taenia
mtDNAs and outgroups provided 3,324 unambiguously
aligned amino acids available for phylogenetic analysis,
of which 1679 were variable and 1,009 parsimony-informative. Alignment of all nucleotides provided 11,393
unambiguously aligned sites, of which 9,378 were variable and 5,901 parsimony-informative. To avoid potential problems of saturation, only coding positions that
were shown to be unsaturated were included in the
nucleotide analysis; leaving 7,655 unambiguously aligned

Figure 1 Phylogenetic estimates of the interrelationships of 7 Taenia species for which complete mtDNAs are available, based on: a.
Bayesian analysis of all alignable amino acids of protein coding genes from complete mtDNAs, b. Bayesian analysis of all alignable,
unsaturated nucleotides from complete mtDNAs (8 partitions; see text), c. cladistic analysis of morphology [6], d. maximum likelihood
and parsimony analysis of partial cox1 and partial nuclear 28S rDNA [57], and e. maximum likelihood analysis of partial cox1 and
partial nad1 [58]. Scale bars in a. and b. indicate number of substitutions per site; c, d and e are drawn as cladograms with equal branch

sites of which 3,680 were variable and 2,365 parsimonyinformative. Bayesian analysis yielded phylogenies with
maximal nodal support throughout the amino acid (Figure 1a), and nucleotide (Figure 1b) estimates. The interrelationships of Taenia based on complete mtDNAs
were different between estimates from amino acids and
nucleotides, and previously estimated phylogenies based
on either morphology (Figure 1c) or molecular data
(Figure 1d and 1e). Consistent among all phylogenetic
estimates is the sister group status between T. asiatica
and T. saginata, as expected, since these species are
known to be very closely related [44]; recent evidence
has demonstrated on-going hybridization between these
species [60]. Molecular estimates from complete

mtDNAs, partial mt and nuclear gene fragments consistently reveal T. multiceps as most closely related to
T. saginata + T. asiatica. The placement of T. multiceps
in this clade suggests a common intermediate host of
members of the Suidae (pig family). Additional taxon
sampling is required to further test the inferences of
intermediate and definitive host switching in the genus
made by Hoberg [1]. Beyond this clade, no two molecular estimates are identical with respect to the remaining
species. The interrelationships of T. hydatigena, T. crassiceps and T. pisiformis in the mtDNA analysis are different from one another, but together they clearly form
a clade (united by each using members of the Canidae
as definitive hosts), in contrast to previous estimates.

Jia et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:447
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/447

It is noteworthy that the nodal support in previous studies, using only small fragments of DNA, was generally
very poor throughout the estimated phylogenies (not
shown), in contrast to the very robust support offered
by complete mtDNA amino acid analysis. Although
additional evidence is required to resolve the interrelationships of the T. crassiceps, T. hydatigena and T. pisiformis
clade, the analysis of amino acids suggests additional
mtDNAs of Taenia species can be incorporated readily to
provide a wider estimate of taeniid phylogeny.
Further studies are required to elucidate the source(s)
of incongruence between the amino acid and nucleotide
estimates, but it may be the result of added homoplasy
from the ribosomal genes, tRNA genes and non-coding
regions included in the analysis. Whether the more
sophisticated Bayesian model (mtZoa) used for the
amino acid analysis has provided a more accurate estimate of interrelationships of Taenia, which requires
further testing, additional sampling of nuclear genes,
such as complete 18S and complete 28S rDNA [61],
may be useful in providing 3 independent estimates
(morphology, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA) of phylogeny. Parsimony mapping of morphological characters
detailed by Hoberg et al. [6] onto the mtDNA amino
acid phylogeny, using only the 7 Taenia species common to both studies, suggests 3 morphological characters might support nodes in the novel topology in
Figure 1a; these included characters 11 (localization of
the metacestode in the intermediate host), 19 (route of
the vas deferens) and 20 (number of layers in the testes).
However, a full assessment of the morphological data
set, by means of an independent molecular-based phylogeny is premature without additional sampling of Taenia species.
Nucleotide variation within and between Taenia mtDNAs

Sliding window analysis of the nucleotide alignment of all
available Taenia mtDNAs provided an indication of
nucleotide diversity (π) within and between mitochondrial genes (Figure 2). The plot readily shows the high
degree of nucleotide variation within and between genes
amongst the aligned Taenia genomes for any given window of 300 bp (π ranges from 0.094 to 0.333), and the
possibility that hitherto untested regions of mtDNAs may
be of utility. GenBank holds relatively few mitochondrial
markers for a few species of Taenia, used variously for
population genetics and diagnostics, but include partial
fragments of cox1, cytb [60,62], nad1 [63], rrnS and atp6
(unpublished data available on GenBank). Sliding window
analysis (and computation of number of variable positions per unit length of gene), indicates that genes with
high sequence variability included nad6 (0.517), nad5
(0.517), atp6 (0.490), nad3 (0.480) and nad2 (0.479).
Genes with the lowest sequence variability (per unit

Page 7 of 13

length) include cox1 (0.296), cox2 (0.323) and rrnS
(0.330). Sequence variability within genes appears to be
highest, with notable peaks and troughs of π, in cox1,
rrnS and nad5. A plot of the number of phylogenetically
informative sites in the same alignment, and using the
same sliding window parameters, revealed a very close
correlation between sequence variability and phylogenetically informative sites (Figure 2), allowing π to be used as
a readily available proxy for phylogenetic signal; DnaSP
[64] calculates π easily, but the plot of phylogenetically
informative positions is more tedious. Nucleotide variability within species tends to reflect the same pattern
observed amongst closely related species (e.g. within a
genus; Littlewood, unpublished). Combined, these results
suggest alternative gene regions are worthy of consideration in developing new genetic markers for phylogenetics,
population genetics and diagnostics. Current mt genes
used as targets for multiplexed PCR-RFLP based
approaches to diagnostics [20,21,65] include cox1 and
cytb; cox1 is also a chosen target for a novel loopmediated isothermal amplification method of diagnosis
[66]. Although relatively easy to amplify routinely, cox1 is
amongst the slowest evolving, and least variable of genes
available in the entire mtDNA suggesting that more reliable, or at least more informative, markers should be
considered for future work, especially diagnostics involving mixed infections or other Taenia species.
In silico prediction of novel mitochondrial markers for
Taenia species

PriFi [67] was used to predict primer pairs capable of
amplifying 500-800 bp lengths of any Taenia mtDNA.
This length was chosen since amplicons of ~650 bp are
amenable to a diversity of qualitative and quantitative
analyses (e.g. restriction digests, sequencing). As with
many algorithms developed for primer design, changing
search and filtering parameters can yield primers of variable quality. Figure 2 illustrates the positions of all primers found with one particular setting, chosen to
minimize nucleotide degeneracy whilst maximizing
inclusiveness across Taenia species. Three primer pairs
were selected for their high score (meeting or exceeding
most of the primer selection criteria), and were found in
nad1, rrnS and nad5, genes of medium to high nucleotide diversity, but likely exceeding the variability offered
by popular gene regions such as cox1 and cytb. Primer
pairs were: A (nad1) forward 5′-CARTTTCGTAAGGGBCCWAAWAAGGT, reverse 5′-CCAATTTCYTGAAGTTAACAGCATCA; B (rrnS) forward 5′- AGGGGATAGGRCACAGTGCCAGCATCTGCGG, reverse 5′- AATTCATTTAAAGTTACCTTGTTACGACTTACCTC; C
(nad5) forward 5′- TATATGAGTTAGTTTTAAGCATTAATTATGG, reverse 5′- GGAAAHCTAGCACTCTTDGTAA. Primers A, B and C yield fragments of

Taenia mitochondrial DNA approximately 871, 558 and
670 bp respectively and capture 241, 146 and 326 variable positions in the total alignment of the Taenia
mtDNAs; equivalent to 14.1% of the overall variable
nucleotide positions (n = 5,770). Efficacy of the 3 primer
pairs herein designed was tested with PCR method. As
expected, the 3 target PCR amplification bands were
observed for the genus Taenia (Figure 3).

Conclusions
Taenia species are important socio-economic parasites
because they have a significant impact on human,
domestic and wild animal health. Complete mtDNAs of
Taenia provide an example of the extremely economic
and compact organization of flatworm mtDNAs. Analysis of amino acids of mtDNAs provides a well-supported
phylogeny for Taenia species, at odds with estimates
from morphology; T. multiceps is more closely related
to T. saginata and T. asiatica than to T. solium, and
that T. hydatigena, T. crassiceps and T. pisiformis form
a monophyletic group. Additional mitochondrial

markers for the study of Taenia highlighted by this
study include those for which high nucleotide variability
has been identified (nad6, nad5, atp6, nad3 and nad2).
In silico analysis of all available mtDNAs of Taenia, suggested new primers capable of capturing higher levels of
mitochondrial nucleotide diversity than those currently
used for diagnosis or molecular ecology. These data
have implications for molecular diagnostic methods, epidemiological investigations and systematic studies of
taeniid parasites.

Methods
Parasites and DNA extraction

Single tapeworms each of T. multiceps and T. pisiformis
tapeworm were collected for DNA extraction and
sequencing. T. multiceps was collected from a dog
infected experimentally with Coenurus cerebralis from
naturally infected sheep (Gansu Provincial Huangcheng
Wool Sheep Breeding Farm). A single cysticercus of
T. pisiformis was isolated from a naturally infected rabbit (at a slaughterhouse in Shandong Province) in our

using nine pairs of oligonucleotide primers (Additional
file 5), designed according to the conserved regions
from published complete mtDNA sequences of taeniid
cestodes. All PCR reactions comprised ~20-40 ng of the
genomic DNA in a 50 μl reaction containing 1.5 U Taq
polymerase, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH9, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM
MgCl2, 200 μM of each dNTP. PCR amplifications each
proceeded with 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 52°C for 45
s, 72°C for 2 to 4 min depending on product length.
The amplicons were then cloned into the pGEM-T Easy
vector (Promega Co., Winsconsin, USA). At least 3
clones from each amplicon were double-stranded
sequenced.

laboratory, and a cyst of the same species was collected
from a rabbit in Henan Province. One T. hydatigena
cyst was collected from the abdominal cavity of a sheep
at a slaughterhouse in Qinghai Province. Other adult
worms, T. asiatica, T. saginata and T. solium from
patients were also used for genomic DNA extraction.
Fragments from the tapeworms and a protoscolex from
the cyst were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Genomic DNA was isolated using Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Puregene ®
DNA Purification System, Gentra Systems, Minneapolis,
Minnesota, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Amplification of mtDNA fragments

The total length of the mt genome was amplified in 9
overlapping fragments using EX TaqTM polymerases
with 3′-5′ exonuclease proofreading activity (Takara Biotechnology Co. Ltd, Dalian, China) using total genomic
DNA purified from a single cyst or worm as the template. The overlapping fragments of T. multiceps,
T. hydatigena and T. pisiformis mtDNAs were amplified

All sequencing was performed using terminator-based
cycle sequencing with BigDye chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) on an ABI 3730 or 373
DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) at Shanghai Sangon or Takara Biotechnology Co. Amplicons were
sequenced to completion by primer walking. Chromatograms were visualized using reports were analyzed using
Chromas 2.33 software http://www.technelysium.com.au,
and sequences were assembled using CUGI’s New CAP3
Server online (The Clemson University Genomics Institute, from http://www.genome.clemson.edu/) [68].
Sequence data were analyzed with the SeqMan and
MegAlign programs, and the consensus sequence of
each amplicon was used as the final sequence (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA).
Nucleotide sequences identified in this study have
been submitted to GenBank, and the accession numbers
for T. multiceps, T. hytigena and T. pisiformis mtDNAs
are GQ228818, GQ228819 and GU569096, respectively.
The published mtDNA sequences for other Cestoda
used in this study include: T. solium (NC_004022),
T. saginata (NC_009938), T. asiatica (NC_004826),
T. crassiceps (NC_002547), Echinococcus multilocularis
(NC_000928), E. oligarthrus (NC_000928) and Hymenolepis diminuta (NC_002767).
Prediction of protein-coding genes

The protein-coding regions were identified using BLAST
searches, ORF finder of DNAStar and comparisons with
other sequences of Platyhelminthes available in the GenBank database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/.
Genetic codes were based on translation table nine and
those in cestodes [49,52].
Prediction of tRNAs and genes for rrnL and rrnS

Putative tRNA genes were identified using the software
ARWEN http://130.235.46.10/ARWEN/[55], combined
with visual inspection of aligned mtDNAs and tRNA
genes. Genes for rrnL and rrnS were identified from

Jia et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:447
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/447

sequence similarities to the published cestode mitochondrial rRNA genes [43]. Putative stem-loop structures of
non-coding mitochondrial regions (LNR and SNR) were
inferred using the program RNAstructure v. 4.6) [69,70].
Mitochondrial gene arrangement

Mitochondrial gene arrangements were compared by eye
for gene adjacencies in all pairwise combinations for
T. multiceps, T. hydatigena and T. pisiformis according
to T. solium, T. saginata, T. asiatica, T. crassiceps and
E. multilocularis.
Alignment and phylogenetic analysis

Two other taeniids, early divergent members of Echinococcus, E. multilocularis and E. oligarthus [48], and
Hymenolepis diminuta were selected as suitable outgroups. Nucleotides of all Taenia mtDNAs and outgroups were aligned initially by eye, in frame where
appropriate for protein-coding genes, using MacClade
[71]. Amino acids translations were inferred using the
flatworm mitochondrial code (Table nine, GenBank
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.
cgi?mode=c#SG9) [52], exported and handled in a separate MacClade file. Nucleotide and amino acid alignments consisted of 11,983 and 3404 positions
respectively, and each were exported to the Gblocks server http://molevol.cmima.csic.es/castresana/Gblocks_server.html) running Gblocks 0.91 b [72] under default
parameters, to remove poorly aligned positions. Gblocks
removed 4.9% (n = 590 nucleotides) and 2.3% (n = 80
amino acids) of the nucleotide and amino acid alignments respectively. For the nucleotide data set, individual genes were first scrutinized to see whether they
were overly saturated. Using Xia et al.’s test [73], as
implemented in Dambe[74], individual genes were tested
using all sites, and for each protein-coding gene 1st, 2nd
and 3rd positions were checked individually. The following 8 gene partitions passed the test and were included
in the phylogenetic analysis ( 1,2 indicates sites 1 + 2
included only, otherwise all sites included): cox3, cytb,
nad4 1,2 , nad2, nad1 1,2 , cox1, cox2 1,2 and nad5. Both
ribosomal RNA genes, atp6, nad3, nad4L and nad6
were significantly saturated and were excluded. The 8
unstaurated gene partitions provided a total of 7,655
nucleotides available for phylogenetic analysis.
Bayesian analyses of the nucleotide and amino acid
analyses were each carried out using MrBayes, v.3.1.2
[75]. Following the recommendations of Rota-Stabelli et
al. [76], for the amino acid data set the mtZoa model
was applied (settings were rates = gamma, ngammacat =
5, aamodel = fixed (rtrev) ); two chains (temp = 0.2)
were run for 5,000,000 generations and sampled every
1,000 generations. Using the unsaturated gene partitions
only, Modeltest 3.7maxX [77] was used to estimate a

Page 10 of 13

suitable model for nucleotide substitution; this was
equivalent to GTR+I+G and settings were nst = 6, rates
= invgamma, ngammacat = 4. Four chains (temp = 0.2)
were run for 5,000,000 generations and sampled every
1,000 generations. For each analysis convergence was
assessed using Tracer v 1.4 [78], with a discarded burnin period of 5,000 trees. Posterior probabilities provided
evidence of nodal support. All trees were rooted against
Hymenolepis diminuta.
The morphological data set of Hoberg et al. [6] was
incorporated into a MacClade [71] file for each of the 7
Taenia species studied here, to enable character mapping onto alternative tree topologies offered by alternative data sets. Only unambiguous changes were traced
to determine whether novel tree topologies from molecular data were supported by morphological characters.
Sliding window analysis of nucleotide variation

The complete alignment of nucleotides of the 7 Taenia
mtDNAs was used to effect sliding window analyses
using DnaSP v.5 [64]. A sliding window of 300 bp and
steps of 10 bp was used to estimate nucleotide diversity
(π) for the entire alignment. Nucleotide diversity for the
entire alignments was plotted against midpoint positions
of each window, and gene boundaries indicated. PAUP*
v. 4.0b10 [79] was used to determine the position of
phylogenetically informative positions under the principle of parsimony, and the sum of these sites was calculated using a sliding window approach with the same
parameters (window size = 300 bp; step size = 10 bp)
and plotted on the same graph.
Design of novel mitochondrial markers for Taenia and their
applications in PCR

Using the same complete nucleotide alignment of
mtDNAs, but with outgroups and deletions common to
all taxa removed, novel PCR primers were sought using
PriFi [67]. This software looks for primer pairs that fit
given criteria, with the added benefit of being designed
on the basis of all taxa in the alignment. PriFi only
accepts relatively short alignments and so 4,000 bp segments of the complete alignment were subjected to analysis; each segment overlapped the next by 1,000 bp and
a segment including both ends of the linear alignment
(to complete the mtDNA circle) was also analyzed. Settings differed from default parameters as follows: minimum melting temperature = 45.0°C, critical melting
temperature = 55.0°C, minimum number of 3′-end
matches = 3, optimal primer length interval = (22, 35
bp), optimal PCR product length interval = (400, 500,
800, 1,000 bp), minimum product length = 350 bp, conservation window length = 50 bp.
All PCR reactions comprised ~20-40 ng of the genomic DNA in a 50 μl reaction containing 1.25 U Taq

Jia et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:447
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/447

polymerase, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH9, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM
MgCl2, 200 μM of each dNTP, and 0.2 μM each primer.
PCR amplifications each proceeded with 35 cycles of
94°C for 1 min 30 s, 52~57°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min.
Primer pairs were: A for nad1, B for rrnS and C for
nad5.
