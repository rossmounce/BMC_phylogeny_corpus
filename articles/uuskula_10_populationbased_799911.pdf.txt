Abstract
Background: Effective prophylactic vaccines are available against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and
18 which are licensed for routine use among young women. Monitoring is needed to demonstrate protection
against cervical cancer, to verify duration of protection, and assess replacement frequency of non-vaccine types
among vaccinated cohorts.
Methods: Data from a population-based study were used to assess the type-specific prevalence of HPV in a nonvaccinated population in Estonia: 845 self-administered surveys and self-collected vaginal swabs were distributed,
346 were collected by mail and tested for HPV DNA from female participants 18-35 years of age.
Results: The overall HPV prevalence (weighted estimate to account for the sampling method) in the study
population (unvaccinated women aged 18-35) was calculated to be 38% (95% CI 31-45%), with estimated
prevalences of high- and low-risk HPV types 21% (95% CI 16-26%), and 10% (95% CI 7-14%), respectively. Of the
high-risk HPV types, HPV 16 was detected most frequently (6.4%; 95% CI 4.0-9.8%) followed by HPV 53 (4.3%; 95%
CI 2.3-7.2%) and HPV 66 (2.8%; 95% CI 1.3-5.2%).
Conclusions: We observed a high prevalence of total and high-risk type HPV in an Eastern European country. The
most common high-risk HPV types detected were HPV 16, 53, and 66.

Background
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is thought to be the most
common sexually transmitted infection in the world [1].
Genital HPV types are categorized according to their
epidemiological association with cervical cancer. Infections with low-risk types, such as HPV types 6 and 11,
can cause benign or low grade changes in cervical cells,
genital warts, and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.
High-risk HPV types can cause cervical, anal, and other
genital cancers. High-risk HPV types are detected in
99% of cervical cancers, and worldwide approximately
70% of cervical cancers are due to HPV types 16 and 18
[2]. Many developed countries have licensed vaccines
that are highly effective against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and
18 for prophylactic use among young females [3]. With
widespread use of the vaccine, decreases in the

prevalence of HPV types covered by the vaccine would
be expected [4]. Close monitoring is needed to demonstrate protection against cervical cancer, to verify duration of protection, and assess the replacement frequency
of non-vaccine types among vaccinated cohorts, and
potential barriers to vaccination coverage [5,6]. However, before a vaccination program is undertaken, baseline HPV disease burden must be assessed to gauge the
efficacy of the program and the vaccine itself. To date,
there are limited data on the prevalence of HPV among
women living in eastern European countries. We have
therefore studied the pre-vaccine prevalence of different
types of HPV in Estonia.

Methods
Sample

An age-stratified (18-20, 21-25, 26-30, 31-35) random
sample of 845 women aged 18-35 years was derived
from the Estonian Population Registry list for Tartu city
(the second largest city in the country) and county

residents (from a total of 22,904 women aged 18-35).
The Estonian Population Registry is an electronic database containing personal data about people residing in
Estonia.
Study procedures

Data collection was conducted from September 2005 to
May 2006. Each participant was mailed a package containing a specimen collection kit (a cotton swab for
vaginal swabbing on a plastic handle packed in an individual reclosable plastic sleeve; Eurotubo ® Collection
swab, Deltalab, S.L.I., Barcelona, Spain), collection
instructions and an informed consent form attached to
a 35-item questionnaire requesting socio-demographic
characteristics, sexual behaviour, and health care utilization data. For specimen collection, participants were
instructed to wash their hands before opening the swab,
to hold the swab by the end of the handle, to insert the
foam swab into the vagina as if inserting a tampon, to
gently turn the swab during a count of 10, and to
replace the swab in the plastic sleeve, avoiding contact
with the external genitalia.
Self-collected specimens (vaginal swabs) were mailed
directly to the laboratory, in pre-stamped, pre-addressed
envelopes. The swabs were transported in a dry state.
Earlier studies have documented good performance of
NAAT assays for the detection of HPV (and other genital pathogens) using self-obtained vaginal swabs shipped
in a dry state to a laboratory [7-10]. Samples were tested
in the ISO 15 189 accredited diagnostics laboratory of
Quattromed HTI Laboratories Ltd. Study procedures
complied with local regulations regarding mailing of
biological materials. (Detailed description of the study
design is provided elsewhere [11].)
Laboratory methods
Specimen processing and DNA isolation

The vaginal swabs were held for up to three days at 4°C
prior to DNA extraction. Material from swab specimens
was suspended in PBS and collected by centrifugation at
16,060G for 20 minutes. The supernatant was discarded
and the pellet was resolved in PBS. DNA was extracted
using the High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Amplification of the human b-globin gene was performed to confirm the integrity of the DNA in the samples [12].

genotyped by restriction fragment length polymorphism
analysis as described in Mejer et al. [14] The HPV genotypes were classified using the systems proposed by
Dunne EF et al. and Munos et al. [4,15] The following
HPV types were classified as high-risk: 16, 18, 31, 33,
35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 73, 82 including probable high-risk types 26, 53, 66. Types 6, 11, 40, 42, 43,
44, 54, 61, 70, 72, 81 and 89 were classified as low-risk.
Statistical analysis

The HPV prevalence was calculated from the number of
positive cases divided by the number of tested specimens. Weighted estimates of population prevalence
were computed to adjust for the stratified sampling utilized in the study. Correlates of HPV prevalence were
explored using the chi-square test for proportions, and
multiple logistic regression analysis to assess confounding and interaction between variables. Factors with p <
0.05 in bivariate analysis were entered in a multivariate
comparison. A conceptual framework approach was
used for the multivariable analysis [16]. All analyses
were performed with statistical software R (version 2.2.1
for Windows).
Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Review
Board of the University of Tartu and the Institutional
Review Board of the State University of New York at
Albany. The study followed data protection legislation
requirements from the Estonian Data Protection Inspectorate. Study participants received no financial incentive
for participation.

Results
Study sample and socio-demographic characteristics

Study invitations reached 86% (723/845) of the targeted
sample but 122 individuals could not be reached
because the packet was undeliverable (e.g., moved,
wrong address). These subjects were excluded from the
analysis.
Women who returned the questionnaire or self-collected a vaginal sample (n = 346) were compared with
those who did not (n = 377) using population registry
data. There was no statistically significance difference in
response proportion according to age, residency or ethnicity (data not shown) [11].
Respondents ranged in age from 18 to 35 years (mean
26.9, SD 5.5). Two out of three participants were either
married (23%) or living with a sexual partner (41%).

HPV genotyping

Human papillomaviruses were detected by single-round
PCR using the degenerated oligo primers MY09/11 and
HMB01 as described by Gravitt et al. [13] using an
Eppendorf Mastercycler (Hamburg, Germany). The PCR
products were detected by ethidium bromide-stained
agarose gel electrophoresis. All positive results were

HPV DNA Prevalence Overall and by Age

Of the 326 adequate specimens available for HPV DNA
testing, 37% (95% CI 31-44%) were positive for any HPV
DNA. After weighting for the source population distribution, the prevalence estimate was 38% (95% CI 3145%) (Table 1). While the overall HPV prevalence was

Factors Associated With HPV DNA Detection

Detection of HPV DNA was significantly correlated in
the bivariate analysis with age, and sexual behaviour
(ever having sex, young age at debut, and higher number of sexual partners within the last 12 months). However, HPV DNA was detected in 6% of females who
reported never having had sex. The final multivariate
model demonstrated that age (> 26, OR = 0.4, 95% CI
0.2-0.9), age above 18 years at first sexual intercourse
(OR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.8), and increasing numbers of
sexual partners in the last 12 months (OR = 2.5, 95% CI
1.4-4.5) were independently associated with HPV DNA
detection (Table 3).

Discussion
Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in
women worldwide. It is the sixth most frequent cancer
among Estonian women of all ages, and the second

most frequent cancer among young Estonian women
(aged between 15 and 44 years) [17]. The availability of
effective HPV vaccines has prompted a discussion about
their use within public health vaccine programs. Geographical data on the HPV type distribution for women
with cervical cancers as well as among women in the
general population are essential for estimating the
impact of cervical screening and vaccination programs
[18]. Several recent studies have documented pre-vaccination HPV prevalence [4,19-23] varying according to
the study design (sampling), study cohorts (clinic based,
population based) and time period. These studies have
typically used cervical samples obtained during a gynecological examination in the context of routine screening. In countries where cervical cancer screening is not
widely implemented, such studies may not represent the

general population and a non-invasive method acceptable to a representative sample of women is needed. One
such option is the self-obtained vaginal sample. Several
studies have documented that self-sampling has similar
sensitivity to physician-obtained sampling to detect HPV
DNA, suggesting that it is a viable screening option and
may be a suitable alternative method for studies on
HPV transmission and vaccine trials [24,25]. Studies utilizing HPV DNA testing of asymptomatic women in the
general population estimate the prevalence of HPV
infection to be in the range of 2-44% [26]. Self-collected
vaginal samples likely pick up a mixture of cervical and
vaginal cells. Previous analyses have established that
genotypes within phylogenetic species tend to be similar
with respect to the anatomic site of infection [27,28].
Studies comparing HPV detection in paired cervical and
vaginal specimens have shown that the carcinogenic
HPV types (alpha9 phylogenetic species, i.e. HPV 16)
have a similar affinity for vaginal and cervical epithelium
(resulting in similar recorded prevalences for any carcinogenic HPV type in vaginal and cervical specimens)
[28], but non-carcinogenic HPV types of the alpha3/
alpha15 (i.e. HPV 61) phylogenetic species may have a
stronger affinity for vaginal epithelium [28].
Consistent with published data, we found that HPV 16
was the most prevalent HPV type (6.4%). We found a
relatively low HPV 18 prevalence. In the light of studies
documenting similar prevalence of any high-risk HPV in
paired cervical and vaginal specimens this finding is of
importance [28,29], and we would expect to see a low
prevalence of HPV 18 in cervical samples from the same
population. A low prevalence of HPV 18 among women
from post-Soviet countries has been documented in
other studies [30]. HPV 6 and 11 (alpha10 phylogenetic
species) are relatively rarely isolated from vaginal/cervical specimens (HPV 6 < 1.5% and HPV 11 < 0.5% from
cervical and vaginal specimens in Castle et al 2007 [29];
HPV 6 < 2% and HPV 11 < 0.5% from cervical specimens in Butsch Kovacic et al 2006 [31]; and HPV 6
from vaginal specimens either physician or patient-collected < 3.5% in Moscicki et al [32]), findings that are
similar to those in our study.
Based on the most recent studies (Table 4) we surmise
that Estonia represents a typical eastern European country with higher HPV and high-risk HPV prevalences
than those reported from neighboring countries with

well-developed population-based cervical cancer screening programs (i.e. Finland, Sweden, Denmark).
The overall HPV prevalence in our study population
was high with the highest overall HPV prevalence
among those aged 21-25 years (and the highest prevalence of high-risk HPV occurring in the 18-20 year age
group) and declining with age. It is well known that
sexually active young adults are most at risk for acquiring HPV. Beside young age, predictors of HPV infection
included younger age at first sexual intercourse and
higher number of sexual partners in the 12 months
before the study. Our results are also in line with existing information on HPV epidemiology [26,33,34].
Our study has several limitations. This study was not
originally designed to assess HPV prevalence, thus we
do not have data on cervical cytology from participating
women. The degree to which the study is representative
of the general population may be affected by the low
response rate and selection factors associated with
response. It is very probable that non-responders and
women who were not reachable are at higher risk of
exposure to HPV. However, in our study, the probability
of not responding was not related to ethnicity, residency
or age, despite the correlation between young age and
infection. Also, we were unable to include preadolescent
women as this would have been ethically unjustifiable
and impractical from a logistical standpoint. While it is
reasonable to assume that the prevalence estimates from
this study are somewhat inflated due to selective participation, the estimate is probably better than that based
on traditional clinic-based findings which are not representative in Estonia.

Conclusion
Several factors affecting cervical cancer control are
changing, including a better understanding of the natural history of HPV, reliable assays for detecting highrisk HPV infections, and the availability of effective preventive vaccines. However, there are important differences in the relevant policy questions for different
settings. Local data including information on HPV (type
specific) prevalence is needed for modeling in a decision
analytic framework to identify those factors most likely
to influence outcomes, provide insight into the costeffectiveness of different strategies, and assist in early
decision-making when weighed against equity, public
