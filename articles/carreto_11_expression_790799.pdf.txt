Expression variability of co-regulated genes
differentiates Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains

Abstract
Background: Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker’s yeast) is found in diverse ecological niches and is characterized by
high adaptive potential under challenging environments. In spite of recent advances on the study of yeast
genome diversity, little is known about the underlying gene expression plasticity. In order to shed new light onto
this biological question, we have compared transcriptome profiles of five environmental isolates, clinical and
laboratorial strains at different time points of fermentation in synthetic must medium, during exponential and
stationary growth phases.
Results: Our data unveiled diversity in both intensity and timing of gene expression. Genes involved in glucose
metabolism and in the stress response elicited during fermentation were among the most variable. This gene
expression diversity increased at the onset of stationary phase (diauxic shift). Environmental isolates showed lower
average transcript abundance of genes involved in the stress response, assimilation of nitrogen and vitamins, and
sulphur metabolism, than other strains. Nitrogen metabolism genes showed significant variation in expression
among the environmental isolates.
Conclusions: Wild type yeast strains respond differentially to the stress imposed by nutrient depletion, ethanol
accumulation and cell density increase, during fermentation of glucose in synthetic must medium. Our results
support previous data showing that gene expression variability is a source of phenotypic diversity among closely
related organisms.

Background
Saccharomyces cerevisiae exists in diverse ecological
niches across the globe and can be found in natural
habitats associated with fruits, trees and insect guts
[1-5], and is also being used by humans for millennia
for brewing, bread and wine production. Recently, wild
type strains have been isolated from infections of immunocompromised individuals [6], raising concerns about
their virulence potential. Large scale genome comparisons [7,8] have demonstrated that the genetic diversity
among strains is high and involves single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions (indels),
gene copy number and gene content variation. The
occurrence of independent adaptation events, together
with its domestication and dispersion associated to
bread, beer and wine production [9], have been

proposed to explain the variability observed among wild
type strains. Interestingly, clinical strains belong to unrelated phylogenetic lineages, raising the hypothesis that
pathogenic traits are ubiquitous in yeast.
Genome expression plasticity is important in yeast for
adaptation to new environments. Genes whose expression is associated to phenotypic variability - such as
those encoding proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis and transport, sulphur and nitrogen assimilation, and protein degradation [10-12] - are strongly
regulated under environmental stress [13,14], with
implications for fitness under environmentally dynamic
conditions. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) (see references
[15-24]) can explain inter-strain phenotypic diversity
arising from subtle alterations in gene sequences, in particular if they alter gene expression [23,25-28]. QTLs
may even be responsible for stochastic “noise” in gene
expression which increases phenotypic variability in an
unpredictable manner [29]. However, the role of gene

expression variability in evolution and cell biology is still
poorly understood.
DNA microarrays enable the analysis of global patterns
of gene expression and allow for identification of gene
expression variability. However, few studies have so far
focused on the comparative analysis of gene expression
patterns among wild type yeast strains. Furthermore,
comparative gene expression studies have been carried
out in exponentially growing cultures [10-12,30-32] and
studies concerning gene expression diversity upon entry
or during stationary phase [33] are still scarce. An important caveat of stationary phase is the low transcription
and translational rates [34-36] which complicate comparative transcriptome analysis. However, quiescence is
likely the most common metabolic state in nature [33]
and it is essential for yeast survival and evolutionary processes. Therefore, comparative transcriptomics studies of
quiescent cells are needed to understand adaptation
potential in environmental settings.
In a previous study, we have characterized the genome
variability of 16 yeast strains of laboratory, commercial,
environmental and clinical origin, using comparative
genome hybridization on array (aCGH) [37]. The data
showed that Ty element copy number differentiated
environmental and commercial strains from other types
of strains, whereas sub-telomeric instability was associated with clinical and laboratorial strains. Our data
corroborated others results showing that those genome
rearrangements are important sources of genetic diversity among natural populations of yeast [38-40]. Our
study also highlighted variability in copy number of
genes involved in amino acid and sugar metabolism,
among others, which are relevant for environmental
adaptation. The molecular mechanisms responsible for
gene copy number alterations are not yet clear, but such
alterations should affect transcript abundance and may
explain, at least in part, gene expression differences
between strains [41].
In the present study, we have used five yeast strains
isolated from different environmental biotopes, one clinical and one laboratorial reference strain (S288C), to
investigate transcriptome variability in yeast. Transcriptome profiles were obtained at different growth time
points of exponential, diauxic shift and stationary phase
states. Since environmental strains were isolated from
vineyards, fermentation in synthetic wine must was chosen for this study. Under these conditions, yeast cells
have to cope with multiple stresses, including high
osmotic pressure, low pH, nutrient deprivation, starvation and high ethanol concentration. Since changes in
nutritional, environmental and physiological conditions
trigger highly coordinated transcriptional reprogramming of master regulatory pathways [42], our study
takes advantage of these changes in gene expression to

evaluate for the first time variability among strains in a
continuously changing environment.
We have identified variable genes and metabolic pathways affected by gene expression variability and we
demonstrate that metabolic reprogramming at the transition between fermentation and respiration enhances
variability in gene expression. Our data indicates that
metabolic transitions expose variability and are important time points to study gene expression noise and for
phenotypic differentiation of yeast strains. Environmental isolates associated to wine fermentation showed
lower levels of expression of genes involved in the
responses to stress and nutrient depletion, in particular
during late stages of fermentation, suggesting that they
are better adapted to the stress imposed by this particular environmental condition.

Results
Characterization of yeast strains

In this study, we have used two S.cerevisiae strains isolated from vineyards of the Bairrada wine region in Portugal, (06L3FF02 and 06L6FF20), three commercial wine
strains (AEB Fermol Rouge, Lalvin EC-1118 and Lalvin
ICV D254), a strain isolated from a patient suffering
from opportunistic fungal infections (J940047) plus the
laboratory strain S288C. Fermentation in synthetic wine
must occurred with similar exponential growth rate
(doubling time of 3.3 ± 0.1 hours) and comparable final
biomass and ethanol concentrations (approximately 10%
(p/v) for all strains (Figure 1). The environmental and
commercial strains reached maximum ethanol concentration after 96 h of fermentation, while the clinical and
laboratorial strains took ~170 h. The fermentation profiles of the environmental and commercial strains were
identical and therefore averaged (Figure 1A). Strain
J940047 had a slightly delayed fermentation onset which
did not affect the profile (Figure 1B). All fermentation
stages were delayed in strain S288C relative to the wildtype strains (Figure 1C) but all strains showed similar
cell viability (90-100%) throughout the monitored fermentation time (170 hours). The viability decline in stationary phase was strain-dependent and strain Lalvin
EC-1118 lost its capacity to form colony forming units
earlier than the other strains, after 10 days of fermentation (Additional file 1).
The mRNA samples for transcriptome profiling were
collected at six time points, representing the beginning
of fermentation (T1, after one cell division post-inoculation, allowing for the initial lag period and the doubling
of the OD 600 of the culture), mid-exponential growth
(T2; OD 600 ~0.5), growth stage transition (T3, maximum rate of CO2 production) and during early, intermediate and late stationary phase (T4, T5 and T6,
respectively) (Figure 1). Ethanol concentration was ~7%

Transcriptome profiles

We used oligonucleotide (70 mer) DNA microarrays targeting the ORFeome sequences of the laboratory strain
S288C for comparative transcriptome analysis. With these
arrays, the putative divergence of the genomic sequence of
the investigated strains relatively to that of S288C [7,8]

should not originate hybridization biases, since it is below
the limit for unspecific target detection with probes of this
length [43]. A common reference sample was obtained
from strain S288C grown to mid-exponential phase in the
same growth conditions and was used for co-hybridization
with all samples. As expected from the reduction in transcription that occurs in yeast stationary phase [44], total
RNA extracts obtained from samples T4, T5 and T6 produced lower amount of cDNA, compromising the labelling
of the samples for microarrays and raising questions about
the representativeness of the data obtained from eventual
pooling of the cDNA synthesis reactions. To overcome
this problem, mRNA enriched samples were used to
synthesize cDNA for microarray analysis and in vitro
synthesized RNA was added in equal quantities to each
sample (spiked in controls) for data normalization, as
described elsewhere [44], to allow the comparison of samples from different growth stages on the same microarray.
Hierarchical clustering of the relative transcript abundance profiles revealed common trends in global gene
expression at each of the fermentation stages (Figure 2).
Profiles from exponential growth time points (T1 and
T2) were very distinct from those obtained at later fermentation stages, irrespective of the strain (Figure 2B).
The profiles obtained for the clinical J940047 and the
laboratorial S288C strains were distinct from those of
the wine related strains throughout fermentation. In
fact, transcriptional profiles of the clinical strain J940047
grouped at marginal positions from the clusters formed
by winemaking strains at T1/T2, T3/T4/T5 and T6
while profiles obtained for strain S288C grouped apart
in a single cluster corresponding to several fermentation
time points (T3/T4/T5/T6) and two separate positions
(T1 and T2). Transcriptional responses of the commercial strains AEB Fermol Rouge and Lalvin ICV D254
were very similar at time points T2, T3 and T5 and a
similar tendency was observed for environmental strains
isolated from the Bairrada region (06L3FF02 and
06L3FF20), which had similar profiles at time points T2
and T6. Strains Lalvin EC-1118 and J940047 had similar
expression profiles at the metabolic transition and in
early stationary phase (T3 and T4 time points, respectively) while strains 06L3FF02, 06L3FF20 and S288C
had similar transcriptome profiles at T4 and T5 (Figure
2B). The separation of the profiles obtained at T6 for
the environmental and commercial strains was due to
the sharp decrease in relative transcript abundance of
many genes in these strains.
Common gene expression trends were observed
among the investigated strains. Growth arrest (T3) coincided with a strong induction of genes involved in glycolysis, thiamine biosynthesis and ergosterol uptake,
together with genes coding for the PAU/TIR family of
cell wall proteins, in agreement with previous reports

Figure 2 Transcriptome profiles of yeast strains. A) Hierarchical clustering (Pearson correlation) of the relative transcript abundance profiles
(log2 scale) of the yeast strains at different fermentation stages (see text for details) indicates similarities and differences in gene expression
regulation along the fermentation process. B) Gene clusters highlight differences in the transcriptome profiles of cells in exponential growth (T1
and T2) and in stationary phase (T3 -T6). The gene expression profiles of strain S288C (Grey bar) were distinct form those of the other strains in
all growth stages. The transcriptome profiles of strain J940047 were similar to those of the environmental and commercial strains but
constituted, nevertheless, a distinct branch in the sub-groups defined by exponential growth profiles (Red bar), early stationary phase profiles
(Blue bar) and late stationary phase profiles (Green bar). Thirteen groups of highly correlated gene co-expression patterns were identified by
hierarchical clustering (see results section) and some of these clusters are highlighted in Panel A. Some of the enriched GO terms are indicated
next to each cluster.

[42,45,46]. At this stage, the fermentation stress
response was induced and heat shock proteins (HSP78,
HSP26 and HSP30), together with proteins involved in
cell wall organization and biogenesis, glucose uptake,
iron homeostasis and vacuolar polyamine transport,
among others, were up-regulated [47]. The decreased
expression of many genes involved in cell cycle progression and nutrient response was also common to all
strains throughout culture progression [34-36].
Differential expression of co-regulated genes

Hierarchical clustering of gene expression profiles across
samples revealed 13 clusters with highly correlated gene
expression patterns (Figure 2A). The averaged expression profiles of each cluster highlighted differences
between strains (Additional file 2). Strains J940047 and
S288C were distinguished from the environmental and
commercial strains by the averaged profile of many of
these clusters, particularly at the time point T6. These
differences could be related to differences in the transcriptomic response due to slower fermentation rate,
indicating deficient adaptation to these growth conditions. As a result of a fermentation delay, strains
J940047 and S288C did not show the general repression
in transcription at T6 which was characteristic of the
environmental and commercial strains. Enrichment analysis of function and transcription factor binding sites of
genes listed in each cluster pointed to cellular functions
and metabolic pathways that distinguished the strains.
The most relevant results are summarized in Table 1.

The expression of 2891 genes grouped in cluster I
(Figure 2A) corresponded to increased biomass production. The main functional categories of the genes
included in this cluster were RNA processing, vesiclemediated transport, and organization/biogenesis of organelles and cytoskeleton. No statistically significant
enrichment for transcription factor binding sites was
found due to the wide representation of cellular functions in this dataset. On other hand, many of the genes
grouped in cluster II (Figure 2A) were annotated to
amino acid utilization, carbohydrate metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and other processes related to
energy reserve metabolism. This cluster was enriched in
genes whose expression is controlled by Msn2p and
Msn4p transcription factors through the STRE cis-elements present in stress genes [13,14], including fermentation stress response genes [47]. The transcriptional
response to changes in carbon source utilization and
hypoxia was also represented in cluster II, since it was
enriched in genes with binding sites for Adr1p and
Sut1p transcription factors (Table 1). These genes were
repressed at T6 in the environmental and commercial
strains but strains J940047 and S288C maintained the
expression levels reached in the T4-T5 time points.
The expression profile of genes represented in cluster
III (Figure 2A) decreased gradually throughout fermentation in all strains. These genes are regulated by the
transcription factors Sfp1p, Rap1p and Azf1p which
control the expression of protein synthesis factors.
Many of the cluster III genes are also annotated to cell

expression levels of these genes from T3 throughout T6.
Relatively elevated transcription levels were observed in
strain J940047 at T5 and T6.
Environmental and commercial strains differed markedly from J940047 and S288C in the expression of genes
belonging to cluster VIII. Genes involved in flocculation,
cell wall organization/biogenesis, transport and cell division (Figure 3), together with many Ty element ORFs,
showed higher expression levels in strains J940047 and
S288C relative to the environmental and commercial
strains regardless of the fermentation time point. In a
previous study [37], we identified gene copy number variation in the genomes of these strains which included
some of the genes present in cluster VIII, namely SEO1
and RSC30 genes (see Additional file 3 for details on relative genome hybridization pattern). Meanwhile, cluster X
grouped the expression profiles of genes that could be
used to distinguish strain S288C from the other strains
throughout the fermentation process. Most of the 79
genes of this cluster corresponded to non annotated
ORFs while annotated ORFs were linked to sexual reproduction (Table 1), Ty elements and included the ASP3
tandem genes which are copy number depleted in the
other strains relatively to strain S288C [37].

expressed in all strains during early stationary phase

similar regulation in all strains. However, MUP1 and
CYS3 (involved in sulphur amino acid transport and
metabolism) showed a different behaviour from the general pattern of decreased expression, as 06L6FF20, Lalvin ICV D254 and J940047 strains up-regulated these
genes at T3 and T4 and down-regulated them at T5.
Cluster V (Figure 2A) included genes involved in the
transition from fermentative to oxidative metabolism,
and many of them are regulated by Adr1p, a transcription factor responsible for induction of glucose
repressed genes [48]. Removal of glucose repression was
supported by the expression profiles of SNF1 which is
required for transcription of glucose-repressed genes,
JEN1 which is a lactate transporter gene repressed in
the presence of glucose, and CAT8 which codes for a
transcription factor that regulates the expression of a
variety of genes under non-fermentative growth conditions. Other genes included in cluster V are involved in
sugar transport (MAL31 and HXT5), multidrug resistance (AZR1, PDR10, YOR1 and CRS5), methionine
transport and biosynthesis (MUP3, STR3 and MET32)
and proline transport (PUT4) (Table 1). This is in agreement with previous studies showing that methionine
and proline are important for tolerance to different
stress factors [49-51]. All strains maintained high

Figure 3 Gene expression variability distinguishes yeast strains. Expression of genes involved in flocculation, transport and cell division

(FLO5 and FLO9), transport (SEO1 and SUL1), cell wall organization and biogenesis (EXG2) and meiosis (RME1 and CEP3) genes. All strains upregulated these genes at the transition from exponential to stationary phase, but the increase in expression was more pronounced in the case
of strains J940047 and S288C. Only the genes with annotated functions are depicted in the heat map, for comparison.

Differential gene expression among yeast strains

The global transcriptome profiling data (Figure 2)
showed that the gene expression profiles of strains
J940047 and S288C were distinct from the others. To
further characterize such differences, a significance analysis (SAM) was performed, considering strains J940047
and S288C as a group and the environmental and commercial strains as another group. Strains J940047 and
S288C had relatively higher expression of many genes
(Figure 4), which was consistent throughout fermentation, and this trend affected in particular annotated
ORFs at T6 and non-annotated ORFs at T3. Ty element
ORFs were differentially expressed throughout
fermentation.
Enrichment of transcription factor binding sites of the
differentially expressed ORFs was used to identify the
main functional differences between the two groups of
strains at each fermentation stage. At T1, genes involved
in the stress response, DNA damage and hypoxia
showed lower expression in the environmental and commercial strains, as indicated by the enrichment of this
dataset for genes with binding sites for Msn2p/Msn4p,
Rph1p and Sut1p transcription factors, respectively. The
same strains showed, in general, lower expression of
genes required for the utilization of poor nitrogen
sources, ethanol, glycerol and fatty acids, as supported
by the enrichment of the same dataset for promoter
regions responsive to Adr1p and Dal82p. The same was
observed for genes controlled by Mcm1p, (regulation of
pheromone response). At T2 (exponential growth),
strains J940047 and S288C had higher expression of

(T4 and T5) (Figure 2A). Many of these genes are
involved in stress resistance and are frequently located
(~45%) in sub-telomeric regions [52]. The negative regulator of the nitrogen catabolite repression DAL80 was
found in this cluster (Table 1) and its expression was
most variable at T3 among the strains (results not
shown). Many of the genes included in cluster XIII are
responsive to anaerobiosis and were enriched in Mot3p
and Nrg1p transcription factor binding sites (Table 1).
Genes required for iron homeostasis and pleiotropic
drug resistance were also represented in this cluster, as
were genes with promoter binding sites for Aft2p and
Cin5p, which regulate resistance to oxidative stress
(Table 1).
Still noteworthy was the behavior of a group of 36
genes that shared a common trend in expression regulation, although with a relatively low correlation coefficient (< 0.657). Many of these genes were MET genes
located in sub-telomeric regions. Their relative expression peaked in early stationary phase in all strains but
was higher, on average, in strain J940047 when compared to the other strains.

Figure 4 The higher expression levels of many genes
distinguishes S288C and J940047 from the environmental

strains J940047 and S288C when compared to the environmental
(06L3FF02, 06L6FF20) and commercial (AEB Fermol Rouge, Lalvin
ICV D254 and Lalvin EC-1118) strains. These differences were
observed throughout fermentation, being particularly evident at the
end (T6), and impacted stress response genes, as well as genes
annotated to metabolic pathways relevant for fermentation
progression. Many of the differentially expressed genes were
hypothetical or corresponded to Ty elements, as is indicated by
colour coded bars.

genes involved in thiamin and vitamin B6 biosynthesis.
This pattern was also observed for several genes
involved in oxidative phosphorylation and in the homeostasis of TCA cycle precursors, such as succinate
(SDH2 and SDH3) and NAD (BNA1, BNA5, and TNA1).
In stationary phase, in particular at T4, strains
J940047 and S288C displayed higher expression of genes
controlled by the transcriptional regulators of methionine biosynthesis Cbf1p and Met31p. Concomitantly,
many genes involved in sulphur amino acid biosynthesis
[53] also had higher expression intensity in these strains.
At T5, no functional enrichment was found for the
group of differentially expressed genes, while genes with
higher expression in strains J940047 and S288C at T6
were enriched in promoter binding sites for Rap1p and
Sfp1p, which regulate ribosome biogenesis in response
to nutrients and stress. This general transcription
repression involved ~2000 genes and constituted a
shared regulatory response of environmental and commercial strains to the changed environmental conditions
at the end of fermentation.

EC-1118 showed a strong expression of OPT2 at T2
while other strains achieved maximum expression values
during late fermentation stages (T3 or T4). Interestingly,
environmental and commercial strains could also be distinguished by differential expression of allantoin and
urea catabolism genes, namely DUR1,2 (Figure 5), DAL7
and DUR3 (not shown).

SAM analysis identified a small group of 14 genes
whose expression intensity was higher in environmental
and commercial strains, in particular during early stationary phase (T4). Expression of PRY3 genes, encoding
a cell wall homologue of plant PR-1 proteins was
strongly induced in these strains and was repressed in
strains J940047 and S288C from T3 to T6 (Figure 5).
The majority of the genes belonging to this group are
involved in alternative nitrogen source utilization. For
example, DIP5 and GAP1 genes encode amino acid
transporters, and SFA1, ARG1, CAR1 and PUT1 genes
are involved in amino acid metabolism (Figure 5). The
plasma membrane oligopeptide transporter gene OPT2
also showed expression variability between the groups of
environmental and commercial strains. Strain Lalvin

Figure 5 Response to nitrogen depletion differentiates winemaking strains. Differential expression analysis revealed that 14 genes at T4
had higher expression levels in the environmental (06L3FF02, 06L6FF20) and commercial (AEB Fermol Rouge, Lalvin ICV D254, and Lalvin
EC1118) strains than in J940047 and S288C strains. Most of these genes are required for utilization of poor nitrogen sources, indicating
differences between the strains in the response to nitrogen depletion. The panels depict the relative transcript abundance of some of these
genes in each strain.

Figure 6 Variability in gene expression is enhanced at the

Variability in gene expression was compared from T1 to T6
fermentation time points, considering the average deviation from
the mean expression value as a measure of amplitude of gene
expression. Panel A shows the distribution of the average deviation
values for all strains and Panel B represents the same distribution for
the environmental (06L3FF02, 06L6FF20) and commercial (AEB

fermentation (Figure 6B). Variability was biased towards
TATA box genes (Additional file 4), in agreement with
what was reported by Basehoar and colleagues [54], who
showed that TATA box containing genes comprise
approximately 20% of the yeast ORFeome and are highly
regulated in response to stress. Our results reinforce the
hypothesis that this promoter element is an important
generator of expression diversity under environmental
pressure.

Among the genes with highest expression variability,
namely those with an average deviation from the mean
of the relative transcript abundance above 1.5 (see
inserts in graphs of Figure 6A and 6B), were many
genes whose transcription is relevant for fermentation
progress (Figure 7). For example, ARO9 and ARO10
genes that code for proteins involved in the metabolism
of aromatic amino acids and production of fusel oils via
the Ehrlich pathway, showed the highest expression
variability at T1 and T2. Also CYS3 and several MET
genes, whose products are involved in the production of
sulphur containing volatile compounds, were most variable at T3. The expression of ALD5 (conversion of pyruvate to acetate) and EXG2 (production of volatile
glycosides) distinguished the yeast strains at T6. Expression of ENA1 and ENA2 (involved in the response to
osmotic stress) was highly variable irrespective of the
fermentation stage and this variability was due to their
elevated expression in strain J940047 relative to the
other strains. The expression of MAL13 (maltose fermentation) was divergent during stationary phase
among the environmental and commercial strains. The
transcription levels of COX1, FIT2 and its homologue
FIT3, were most variable from T2 to T6, suggesting differences in redox homeostasis among the yeast strains
from early stages of fermentation. The COX1 gene
showed the highest relative transcript abundance in
strain J940047 and the FIT2 and FIT3 homologues had
lower expression in strain 06L3FF02.
The cellular functions affected by gene expression
variability were identified by functional enrichment analysis performed on a ranked list of genes [55], considering the average deviation from the mean of the relative
transcript abundance calculated for each gene as the
ranking criterion. Genes involved in transposition were
highly variable during all fermentation time points, most
probably due to the high variability in Ty copy number
among yeast strains [37,56,57]. Genes annotated to disaccharide and pyridoxine metabolism, vitamin B6 biosynthesis and aspartate family amino acid metabolic
process also had highly variable transcript abundance
throughout fermentation.
Top variance in gene expression was associated with
the specific metabolic requirements of the corresponding growth phase (Additional file 5). For instance, genes
involved in rRNA modification and processing were the
most variable at T1, while genes annotated to mitochondrial transport and to metabolism of intermediate metabolites of the TCA cycle were the most variable at T2.
Both T1 and T2 stages had high variability in the
expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, transport of ions and glucose, and in regulation of
nucleotide metabolism. In particular, T3 revealed high
expression variability of genes involved in the

Figure 7 The expression of aromatic compound synthesis genes is highly variable. Highly variable genes were identified at several
fermentation stages, with particular incidence for genes required for the production of fusel alcohols and other aromatic compounds. Examples
of this were ARO9 and ARO10 genes whose products are part of the Ehrlich pathway, CYS3 and several MET genes involved in the production of
sulphur containing volatile compounds and EXG2, which is required for the production of volatile glycosides. Their relative transcript levels and

cycloheximide and fatty acid metabolism. Expression of
genes involved in thiamine and steroid biosynthesis,
together with genes related to amino acid metabolism
and transport, differentiated the yeast strains during stationary phase.
In order to identify possible sources of gene expression variability, the transcript profiling data was crosschecked with comparative genome on array (aCGH)
data, obtained in our laboratory in a previous study [37].
Among the genes that were copy number depleted in
the environmental and commercial strains relatively to
strains J940047 and S288C (Additional file 3) were the

top variable genes FLO5, FLO9, PLC1, RSC30 and SEO1.
The relative transcript abundance of these genes was
also comparatively lower in the environmental and commercial strains when compared to strains J940047 and
S288C (Figure 3). We further investigated the correlation between gene expression and gene load in the T2
and T4 fermentation time points by calculating the relative transcript abundance for every strain relatively to
that of strain S288C. Several correlations (Additional file
6) were dependent on the fermentative time point (T2:
MAL13 and MAL33; T4: ENA5, PLC1, SEC23 and
SPT7). A correlation between gene load and gene

expression both at T2 and T4 was identified only for
AGC1 and HSF1. Interestingly, these genes, together
with SPT7 and SEC23, were amplified in strain J940047
relative to the other strains (Additional file 3).

Discussion
Differences in fermentation profiles among yeast strains

This comparative transcriptomics study of S. cerevisiae
strains isolated from Portuguese vineyards, (06L3FF02
and 06L6FF20), commercial wine strains (AEB Fermol
Rouge, Lalvin EC-1118 and Lalvin ICV D254), a clinical
isolate (J940047) and the laboratory strain S288C
showed important mRNA content variability among
them. All strains were able to complete fermentation
and yielded similar biomass and ~ 10% (p/v) of ethanol
concentration. However, winemaking strains had short
latency time and completed fermentation earlier (~ 4
days). No differences in growth profile were observed
between the group of commercial strains and environmental strains isolated from vineyards. This is in agreement with recent data showing that winemaking strains
form a homogeneous group with similar behaviour
under winemaking conditions, irrespective of their geographical origin [7-9]. Nevertheless, several studies
showed significant phenotypic variation among winemaking strains [30,58] and, in spite of the similarity in
fermentation profile, the commercial strains Lalvin ICV
D254 and AEB Fermol Rouge could be differentiated
from the other wine related strains on the basis of their
transcriptomic profiles (Figure 2B) throughout fermentation (T2, T3 and T5).
The clinical (J940047) and laboratorial (S288C)
strains fermented slower than the wine making strains.
The global hierarchical clustering of transcriptomic
profiles obtained for all strains and time points confirmed that strain S288C was more dissimilar, while
the clinical strain J940047 was more similar to wine
related strains (Figure 2B), suggesting that the latter
may have originated from wine strains. A recent analysis of genome-wide patterns of nucleotide polymorphisms showed that clinical strains do not derive from a
common ancestor and that European clinical strains
are closely related to wine strains, which is in agreement with our data [7,8]. Conversely, strain S288C was
obtained in the 1950’s through genetic crosses and
88% of its gene pool originated from strain EM93
which was initially isolated from a rotten fig [59].
Therefore, the cultivation of strain S288C over decades
under laboratory conditions may have altered its fermentative performance and ethanol resistance. This is
supported by a recent study showing that S288C is
particularly sensitive to ethanol when compared to
other 52 S. cerevisiae strains isolated from a variety of
biotopes [30].

The transition from fermentation to respiration
differentiated yeast strains

The entry into stationary phase was accompanied by
increased transcription of numerous genes (clusters II
and V of Figure 2), coinciding with the shift from fermentative to oxidative metabolism [60]. Among the
genes whose expression was reprogrammed were many
genes that are controlled by the transcription factor
Adr1p, which regulates genes that are under glucose
catabolite repression [61]. The relief of glucose catabolite repression under similar conditions of high sugar
concentrations has been linked to nitrogen depletion
which occurs during must fermentation [42,62]. The
ability to ferment and respire simultaneously is known
as the Crabtree effect and is characteristic of the yeast
species that underwent whole-genome duplication [63].
However, environmental and commercial strains showed
smaller amplitude in the up-regulation of oxidative
phosphorylation and TCA cycle genes at the metabolic
shift (stage T3) relative to the other strains and this cannot be solely attributed to differences in glucose concentration during the respective fermentations as the
metabolic flux partitioning between fermentative and
oxidative metabolism is associated with the demand for
NADPH rather than to the need of carbon precursors
[64]. Respiratory metabolism, together with the fermentative stress response, was more up-regulated in strains
J940047 and S288C than in the environmental and commercial strains, highlighting the importance of anaplerotic reactions for the cellular management of multiple
stress factors.
Expression of nitrogen metabolism genes was highly
variable

Nitrogen metabolism reorientation occurs upon depletion of assimilable nitrogen and was observed at stages
T4-T6, corresponding to growth arrest. The amplitude
and the timing of gene expression related to nitrogen catabolite repression were particularly diverse among the
environmental and commercial strains. CAR1 gene (coding for an arginase) and PUT1 gene (whose product is a
proline oxidase) exemplify this trend (Figure 5), among
many others included as part of clusters II and XII (Figure 2). The tight regulation of these genes is of paramount importance for the fermentation progress and
outcome [45], in particular if one considers that arginine
and proline are the most abundant nitrogen sources in
grapes [65]. On another hand, strain S288C had the lowest expression levels for PUT1, as proline was among the
least-preferred nitrogen sources in strains with S288C
background [66]. The different utilization kinetics of
these and other amino acids are tightly linked with the
sensorial properties of wine because amino acids are
important precursors of volatile compounds [67,68].

Carreto et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:201
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/201

Therefore, differences in the expression of these genes in
winemaking strains throughout fermentation may be one
of the reasons for divergent aroma profiles of wines
obtained with distinct S. cerevisiae strains.
The expression of OPT2 (Figure 5), encoding a membrane peptide permease [69], was strongly up-regulated
in stationary phase in the environmental and commercial strains. Each wine strain showed a characteristic
expression profile of OPT2 in both timing and amplitude of expression. This indicates important variability
in the capacity of strains to survive in environmental
conditions which require the utilization of small peptides as nutrients [70]. A similar situation was observed
for DUR1,2 (Figure 5), which indicates considerable
inter-strain variation in urea degradation to CO2 and
NH3 as an additional resource for assimilable nitrogen.
In fact, differences in the transcriptional level of regulators of nitrogen catabolite repression such as DAL80
and GAT1 were registered during growth arrest (T3),
although without statistical significance. The reciprocal
negative feedback mechanism controlled by those two
genes [71] regulates the expression of amino acid and
ammonium permeases and of some proteases involved
in protein degradation. The high relative expression
levels of those regulators towards the end of fermentation in strain J940047 (results not shown) highlights an
enhanced response to long term depletion of assimilable
nitrogen. Diversity in the expression of amino acid permeases and in oligopeptide uptake via OPT2 were previously identified among natural isolates of wine yeast
from Tuscan vineyards [11].
Particularly interesting was the higher relative expression of SFA1 in the winemaking strains, both from
environmental and commercial origin, throughout stationary phase (Figure 5). In yeast, glutathione-dependent
formaldehyde dehydrogenase activity of the protein
encoded by this gene plays an important role in the last
step of fusel alcohol production via the Ehrlich pathway
[72]. While these compounds are responsible for flavour
and aroma of yeast-fermented foods and beverages, they
are also involved in the induction of filamentous growth
in S. cerevisiae and biofilm formation in the pathogens
Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis [72]. In the
environmental and commercial strains, the expression
profile of SFA1 was similar to that of PRY3 (Figure 5)
which is involved in cell wall biogenesis [73]. Therefore,
the expression levels of these two genes may be linked
since Pry3p expression is up-regulated in response to
organic solvents [74].
The origin of gene expression diversity

Yeasts have the ability to regulate gene expression when
challenged by pleiotropic stress conditions, such as
those imposed by fermentation of high sugar and low

Page 12 of 17

nitrogen substrates. Gene expression divergence among
closely related strains in response to stress may be due
to genomic diversity [25,75], namely by the accumulation of polymorphisms in cis- and trans-acting regulatory factors [76,77], together with epigenetic factors
[78]. Small variations in gene content, even among yeast
strains with close phylogeny [30], may also alter gene
expression when regulatory genes are affected, while the
expression of genes of exogenous origin [79] may even
confer or complement phenotypes that allow for survival
under specific stressful environments.
The expression of genes involved in various aspects of
nitrogen and amino acid metabolism was highly variable
among the studied strains. Variability in expression of
amino acid metabolism genes supports previous comparative transcriptome analysis of yeast isolated from a
wider range of biotopes [10,11,30], but the mechanisms
responsible for gene expression variability among phylogeneticaly related strains is not understood. Genome
polymorphisms [26] explain part of that variability, however many environmental stress responsive genes,
namely amino acid metabolism genes [14], may be
under “noisy” expression control. Indeed, stress response
genes often possess TATA boxes in their promoter
regions [54] and the sensitivity of gene expression to
mutations increases both with increasing trans-mutational target size and the presence of the TATA box
[80]. The TATA box is associated with high gene
expression variance in yeast and many other organisms
[81], and our study showed that gene expression variability was correlated with the TATA box in a strain
independent manner, supporting previous findings [30].
This association between the TATA box and gene
expression variability has been attributed to a higher
rate of regulatory divergence for genes with this cis-element, either in response to selection [81] or mutation
accumulation [80]. But, genes with the TATA box show
high variability in expression even in cultures of the
same strain [77,82] grown in different media conditions,
supporting that the expression of these genes is also
responsive to environmental or genetic perturbation
[30]. In other words, the TATA box is a potential generator of phenotypic diversity under environmental
selection within an isogenic population.
Retrotransposon activity is another mechanism by
which phenotypes can evolve in yeast. Ty element mobility has been associated to genome divergence between
yeast strains and species [76,83] and insertion of these
elements result frequently in chromosomal rearrangements and gene duplications [38]. The relative abundance of Ty elements in the genome is related to the
genetic background of the strains [37,56,57] and yeast
strains differ in their relative expression. Previous studies
[12,30] differentiated strain S288C from other strains

Carreto et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:201
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/201

relatively to expression of Ty genes, showing good correlation between expression intensity and relative Ty copy
number [30]. Our data support that correlation, since Ty
transcription levels, which were higher in S288C and
J940047 strains relative to commercial and environmental isolates throughout fermentation, were correlated to
increased Ty abundance [37]. Interestingly, the higher
expression of Ty elements coincided with higher levels of
expression of stress responsive genes in strains S288C
and J940047, raising the hypothesis of a cause-effect relationship between these two variables.
Positive correlations between gene expression level
and gene load were only found for few genes with annotated functions (Supplementary Figure S5). However,
differences in the expression of some of these genes
may have a direct impact in the transcription levels of
many others, thus contributing to the general variability
in expression observed among the investigated strains.
For example, expression differences in HSF1, PLC1 and
SEC23 were correlated with putative gene load differences (Additional file 6); the products of these genes
have direct impact on many cellular processes. Hsf1p is
a transcription factor that controls the expression of
hundreds of genes involved in protein folding, detoxification, energy generation, carbohydrate metabolism and
cell wall organization [84] and is part of a global molecular response to diverse stress stimuli linked to protein
misfolding [85]. The PLC1 gene product regulates nutrient sensing, filamentous growth, PKA-mediated stress
response [86,87], cellular processes that may have a
direct impact on yeast pathogenicity [88,89], while
SEC23 plays a role in the yeast secretory pathway [90]
and influences protein secretion and the protein pool at
the yeast-environment interface. Copy number variations in PLC1 and SEC23 may be common among yeast
strains, since both are sub-telomeric and are, therefore,
subjected to the instability of these genomic regions
[40]. Also interesting was the SPT7gene whose expression levels were higher in strains with putatively
increased gene load. The product of this gene is a subunit of the SAGA complex which is a transcription activator of RNA polymerase II-dependent genes [91]. The
Spt7p load determines the stoichiometry of the SAGA
complex due to its involvement in proper complex
assembly and control of other core subunits [92]. Since
transcription activation of TATA box-containing genes
occurs preferentially by the SAGA complex rather than
TFIID [54], transcription of this gene should affect a
huge variety of cellular functions due to broad functional distribution of the TATA promoter element.

Conclusions
The present study shows that gene expression is variable
among wild-type yeast strains. Such variability is

Page 13 of 17

observed throughout the spectrum of metabolic changes
endured by yeast during glucose fermentation. The
variability in expression levels of many genes impacted
key aspects of yeast metabolism and can be seen as a
potential generator of phenotypic diversity in yeast
populations. Differences in gene expression during fermentation affected co-regulated genes and distinguished
yeast strains. This indicates that gene expression
changes in response to environmental challenges are not
only a function of the intensity of the challenge, but are
also determined by the genetic background of the strain.
Therefore, a wider characterization of the variability of
cellular responses and its connection to genomic traits
is necessary to understand the plasticity and adaptability
potential of natural yeast populations.
Differences between strains were enhanced at the
beginning of fermentation, where the wine making
strains had lower expression of stress- regulated genes,
and during early stationary phase, when the expression
of genes involved in the utilization of poor nitrogen
sources was higher in the wine making strains. Interestingly, the clinical and the laboratorial strains showed
higher expression of many non-annotated ORFs when
ethanol production reached its maximum rate (T3).
These observations suggest that winemaking strains
cope better with stress-imposing environmental conditions and are able to manage limiting nutrients, namely
nitrogen, in a more efficient and resourceful way. The
regulation of expression of genes involved in nitrogen
metabolism was one of the major sources of the diversity encountered among the winemaking strains while
gene load differences, particularly those affecting key
regulator genes, such as HSF1 and SPT7, were an
important source of the diversity among all strains.

Methods
Yeast strains and culture conditions

Environmental strains were isolated from vineyards of
the Bairrada wine region, Portugal, while commercial
wine strains were kindly provided by Adega Cooperativa
da Bairrada, Cantanhede-Portugal. The clinical isolate
was a kind gift of Prof. Mick Tuite from the University
of Kent, Canterbury, UK. Strain S288C is maintained as
part of our laboratory’s yeast culture collection. Details
of the strains used in this study can be found elsewhere
[37].
Fermentations were carried out at 24°C, using the culture medium MS300, commonly used as synthetic grape
must [93]. Semi-anaerobic fermentations were carried
out in 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks filled with 550 ml of
culture media and fitted with a Teflon stopper pierced
with a syringe needle for gas exchange. Fermentations
were inoculated to an initial OD600 of ~0.025 with the
appropriate volume of overnight pre-cultures grown in

Carreto et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:201

the same culture medium. Homogenization of the cultures was carried out by magnetic stirring (500 rpm).
CO2 production was determined by measuring culture
weight loss during fermentation. The ethanol concentration was estimated from CO2 mass production using the
equation E(g/l) = 1.011 mCO2 (g/l) + 2.7, as previously
described [42]. Cells were harvested at the time points
indicated in Figure 1 by centrifugation (3000 g, 3 min,
at room temperature).
RNA isolation and sample labelling

mRNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and labelling were carried out as described elsewhere [44]. Briefly, total RNA
was isolated using hot phenol extraction. For hybridization quality control and normalization of the microarrays, mixtures of ten in vitro synthesised RNAs were
added from appropriately diluted mixtures to 500 μg of
total RNA in the case of T2 samples or to 1000 μg of
total RNA in T1, T3, T4, T5 and T6 samples. Different
amounts of total RNA were used for mRNA enrichment
to account for differences in the relative amount of
poly-A transcripts in total RNA extracts. mRNA enrichment of the samples was performed using Oligotex
beads following the manufacturer’s instructions for
batch purifications (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis was carried out using 3 μg of mRNA enriched samples in the
presence of 2-aminoallyl-dUTP. Samples were purified
using Microcon-30 (Millipore) columns prior to coupling to Cy3 and Cy5 fluorofores. Before hybridization,
free dyes were removed using Chromaspin-30 (Clontech) columns and the efficiency of cDNA synthesis and
dye incorporation was measured by spectrophotometry
(NanoDrop). Samples with a degree of labelling (labelled
nucleotides per 100 nucleotides) outside the range of 5.0
± 1.2 were not considered for hybridization.
Microarray production

In-house spotted DNA-microarrays were prepared using
6388 oligonucleotide sequences (70 mer) targeting the
complete ORFeome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(OPERON Yeast AROS v1.1 collection, Qiagen). Probes
were spotted twice on CodeLink activated slides (GE
Healthcare) according to the slide manufacturer’s
instructions, using a MicroGrid Compact II spotter
(GenomicSolutions) equipped with 48-quill pins (Microspot2500). A set of 70 mer probes, designed from
Escherichia coli genome sequence with less than 70%
homology to S. cerevisiae genome, was also included in
the microarray. These probes were used to detect the
spiked-in control RNA added to the total RNA sample
in order to monitor labelling and hybridization quality.
The array design and spotting protocol were deposited
in ArrayExpress database under the accession code
number A-MEXP-1185.

Hybridization

Hybridizations were carried out as previously described
[44], using a common reference design with dye-swap
replicates. Total RNA obtained from strain S288C grown
to mid exponential growth phase in MS300 medium was
used as the reference sample. Four self-self hybridizations
were performed using the common reference sample for
control of experimental background. The raw data and
the pre-processed data from a total of 88 hybridizations
were submitted to the ArrayExpress Database and can be
accessed using the code E-MTAB-112.
Image acquisition and data processing

Images of the microarray hybridizations were acquired
using the Agilent G2565AA microarray scanner and the
fluorescence intensities were obtained with QuantArray
v3.0 software (PerkinElmer). Pre-processing of the data
was performed using the Biometric Research Branch
(BRB)-ArrayTools v3.4.0 software. Manually flagged bad
spots were eliminated and the local background was
subtracted prior to averaging of replicate features on the
array. Log2 intensity ratios (M values) were normalized
using as reference the signal of five different control
RNAs spiked in equal amounts to the samples co-hybridized in each array. The concentration of the spiked
RNA controls was chosen so that log 2 (Cy5*Cy3) ½ )
values (A values) would be distributed between 5 and
15. The log2 intensity ratios of the spiked-in controls
were forced to a median value of zero and all data
points were adjusted accordingly. Following data normalization, each pair of dye swap experiments was averaged to obtain the log2 intensity ratios representing the
relative transcript abundance for each monitored ORF.
Statistical analysis and functional annotation of the data

Hierarchical clustering of the normalised and dye-swap
averaged samples was performed using Pearson correlation (average linkage) TM4 Microarray Software Suite
(MeV) 4.3 [94]. Clustering of genes was carried out
using CLICK, a clustering algorithm implemented in
EXpression Analyzer and DisplayER (EXPANDER) 4.0.2
[95], which does not require prior assumptions on the
structure or the number of clusters to be found. Thirteen highly correlated clusters of the expression profiles
were obtained with an average homogeneity above
0,884.
Significance analysis was performed using Significance
Analysis for Microarrays (SAM) [96] also implemented
in MeV. Comparison of strains 06L3FF02, 06L6FF20,
AEB Fermol Rouge, Lalvin ICV D254 and Lalvin EC1118, against the non-wine related strains J940047 and
S288C, at all fermentation stages tested was carried out
with the two-class unpaired SAM test, allowing a maximum False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 8.7% (90%

Carreto et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:201

confidence), in the case of T4 samples. The same test
was performed for the comparison of the laboratorial
strain S288C against the other strains with a FDR (90%
confidence) between 2.4% (T1 samples) and 1.5% (T6
samples).
The Saccharomyces Genome Database [55] was used
for functional interpretation of the data. Enrichment of
Gene Ontology term or transcription factor binding site
was performed using TANGO and PRIMA algorithms,
respectively, implemented in EXPANDER 4.0.2 software,
using a p-value threshold of 0.05 (Bonferroni correction
was used in PRIMA analysis). Gene set enrichment analysis on a ranked list of genes was performed using the
FatiScan web tool implemented in Babelomics 3.1, using
a two-tailed Fisher exact t-test with adjusted p-value
cut-off of 0.05. The genes in the analyzed lists were
ordered from the highest to the lowest average deviation
from the mean of the relative transcript abundance
value calculated across samples.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Cell viability. Cell viability during fermentation was
compared for Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains Lalvin EC-1118, 06L3FF02,
J940047 and S288C.
Additional file 2: Co-expression cluster line graphs. Gene coexpression was investigated for strains 06L3FF02, 06L6FF20, AEB Fermol
Rouge, Lalvin ICV D254, Lalvin EC-1118, J940047 and S288C from the
measurements of relative transcript abundance during fermentation.
Graphs represent the average relative transcript abundance (log2 ratio)
determined for groups of genes having highly correlated expression
profiles across samples.
Additional file 3: Relevant aCGH data. Summary of gene copy number
differences observed between the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains
included in this study. Relative gene copy number values (fold change
relatively to strain S288C) were obtained by comparative genome
hybridization on array (Carreto et al. 2008. BMC Genomics 9: 524). Only
genes relevant for discussion in the present manuscript were
represented.
Additional file 4: Variability in TATA box genes. Variability in gene
expression was biased towards TATA box genes. The graphics show the
frequency of TATA box genes as a function of gene expression variability.
The average deviation from the mean of the relative gene expression
value was taken as a measure of expression variability. Panel A was
obtained considering all the investigated strains while Panel B represents
the distribution obtained for the environmental and commercial strains.
Additional file 5: GO Biological Process enrichment in top variable
genes. Results obtained from a Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment
analysis performed to determine the over-representation of Biological
Processes among the top variable genes (FatiScan). The list of genes was
ranked according to the average deviation from the mean relative
expression measured among the yeast strains studied.
Additional file 6: Correlation between gene expression and aCGH.
Correlation between relative transcript abundance and putative
differences in gene load was found for some genes. The relative
transcript abundance values determined for each strain relatively to
those of strain S288C were plotted against the relative gene copy
number differences for the same strains. The analysis was performed
using the datasets from T2 (Panel A) and T4 (Panel B) stages of
fermentation.
