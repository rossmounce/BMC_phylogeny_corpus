Abstract
Background: Sequencing of cDNA libraries for the development of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) as well as for
the discovery of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) has been a common method of developing microsatellites or SSRbased markers. In this research, our objective was to further sequence and develop common bean microsatellites
from leaf and root cDNA libraries derived from the Andean gene pool accession G19833 and the Mesoamerican
gene pool accession DOR364, mapping parents of a commonly used reference map. The root libraries were made
from high and low phosphorus treated plants.
Results: A total of 3,123 EST sequences from leaf and root cDNA libraries were screened and used for direct
simple sequence repeat discovery. From these EST sequences we found 184 microsatellites; the majority containing
tri-nucleotide motifs, many of which were GC rich (ACC, AGC and AGG in particular). Di-nucleotide motif
microsatellites were about half as common as the tri-nucleotide motif microsatellites but most of these were
AGn microsatellites with a moderate number of ATn microsatellites in root ESTs followed by few ACn and no
GCn microsatellites. Out of the 184 new SSR loci, 120 new microsatellite markers were developed in the BMc (Bean
Microsatellites from cDNAs) series and these were evaluated for their capacity to distinguish bean diversity in a
germplasm panel of 18 genotypes. We developed a database with images of the microsatellites and their
polymorphism information content (PIC), which averaged 0.310 for polymorphic markers.
Conclusions: The present study produced information about microsatellite frequency in root and leaf tissues of
two important genotypes for common bean genomics: namely G19833, the Andean genotype selected for whole
genome shotgun sequencing from race Peru, and DOR364 a race Mesoamerica subgroup 2 genotype that is a
small-red seeded, released variety in Central America. Both race Peru and Mesoamerica subgroup 2 (small red
beans) have been understudied in comparison to race Nueva Granada and Mesoamerica subgroup 1 (black beans)
both with regards to gene expression and as sources of markers. However, we found few differences between SSR
type and frequency between the G19833 leaf and DOR364 root tissue-derived ESTs. Overall, our work adds to the
analysis of microsatellite frequency evaluation for common bean and provides a new set of 120 BMc markers
which combined with the 248 previously developed BMc markers brings the total in this series to 368 markers.
Once we include BMd markers, which are derived from GenBank sequences, the current total of gene-based
markers from our laboratory surpasses 500 markers. These markers are basic for studies of the transcriptome of
common bean and can form anchor points for genetic mapping studies in the future.

Background
Genic microsatellites are those microsatellites based on
simple sequence repeats (SSRs) found within, or closely
associated with, gene sequences from a given genome [1].
These SSRs tend to be more conserved and of different
motifs than SSRs located in other non-gene containing
regions of the genome, which are often referred to as
genomic microsatellites simply to distinguish them from
genic microsatellites [2]; although both gene and nongene derived microsatellites are obviously part of the
overall genome. Simple sequence repeats are defined as
small stretches of repeated DNA, usually of two to six
nucleotides, tandemly repeated and located in a given
pattern between segments of non-repeated DNA [3]. In
practice, remnant repeats can be found on either side of
a stretch of SSR and in some occasions different motifs
are combined together or either motif is interrupted [4].
This differentiates microsatellites into compound or simple microsatellites in the first case, and perfect and
imperfect microsatellites in the latter case [5].
Common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L., is an important
food legume, basic to the diet of the poor in tropical
regions of the world, and a major source of income for
small farmers there. Genic microsatellites have been limited in number for this crop. This is perhaps due to two
main reasons: 1) a lack of funding has precluded large
scale expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing or even
the sufficient construction of many cDNA libraries for the
crop and 2) those ESTs and cDNA libraries that exist have
not been extensively screened for gene-based SSRs with
the exception of the work of Blair et al. [6] and Hanai
et al. [7,8]. Yet, common bean is essential for micronutrient nutrition and is adaptable to marginal areas for smallscale farm agriculture despite problems of low phosphorus
soils or other abiotic constraints [9,10] and a range of diseases and pests [11]. Therefore a more complete toolbox
of molecular tools for this crop is needed especially in the
case of gene-based markers which can be based on SSRs
polymorphisms as will be discussed here.
In our efforts to accumulate a larger set of genic SSRs,
we previously constructed a leaf based cDNA library from
Andean genotype G19833 [12] and used a hybridization
approach to discover SSRs of various di-nucleotide and trinucleotide motifs and develop microsatellites from this
library in the BMc (Bean microsatellites from cDNAs) series [6]. We have also recently developed two additional
root based cDNA libraries under high and low phosphorus
conditions from the Mesoamerican genotype DOR364, the
other parent of the mapping population of Blair et al. [2]
and sequenced ESTs from the libraries to discover new
SSRs.
The EST sequencing of these libraries is used in this
research as the basis for determining the frequency of

Page 2 of 10

SSR sequences in root expressed genes as opposed to
leaf expressed genes and for adding to the BMc series of
microsatellites through an in silico approach to microsatellite discovery as described by Varshney et al. [13] for
some species of cereals. EST-SSRs are more common in
cereals than they are in legumes [14-16].
Apart from our efforts, currently there are approximately 70,000 other EST sequences from common bean
including collections from Ramirez et al. [17], Melotto
et al. [18] and Thibivilliers et al. [19] along with small
groups of GenBank entries and a wish-list of further EST
efforts [9]. However most of these libraries have not been
screened nor compared for SSR markers. The Melotto
et al. [18] libraries from anthracnose infected common
bean leaves which contain together approximately 4,000
unigenes has been screened for microsatellites, yielding a
set of 140 EST-based SSRs for Hanai et al. [7,8], although
many of these have been used for genetic mapping rather
than for germplasm characterization.
The objective of this research was to evaluate the frequency of microsatellites in sequences from different leaf
and root EST libraries made in our laboratory, comparing
the types of microsatellites from each source tissue. From
there we developed the most promising microsatellite loci
as gene-based SSR markers that we added to the BMc series of markers [6]. To validate these BMc markers we
compared their ability to detect polymorphism in a standard germplasm panel of 18 mapping parent genotypes,
which included Mesoamerican, Andean, wild and cultivated accessions that were useful for determining polymorphism information content of the different groups of
markers. A final objective was to determine whether any
difference in the ability to uncover polymorphism existed
between the newly developed BMc markers found in the
random EST sequencing versus BMc markers developed
by our previous hybridization-based approach.

Methods
cDNA library and EST sequencing

Three cDNA libraries were searched for microsatellite
containing sequences. These libraries were based on
1) mRNA from leaf and stem tissues as described in Blair
et al. [12] and Ramirez et al. [17] for the genotype
G19833; 2) a library that was made in the pBS-SKII vector from mRNAs of hydroponically grown DOR364 roots
which were produced under low phosphorus (LP) conditions and 3) a final library also made in the pBS-SKII vector from mRNAs of hydroponically grown DOR364 roots
but which were from a high phosphorus (HP) treatment.
In total, 1308 ESTs were sequenced from the G19833
leaf and stem tissue library: 540 sequences (GenBank
entry BQ481427-BQ481965) from Blair et al. [12] and
768 sequences (HS089176-HS089943) sequenced for

Blair et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:50
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/50

this study. Meanwhile, a total of 1815 ESTs were
sequenced from the DOR364 root tissue libraries: these
being 862 from the HP library (GenBank entries,
HS103978-HS104836) and 953 from the LP library
(GenBank entries, HS103028-HS103977). Clones from
all cDNA libraries were sequenced from the 5’end using
BigDye chemistry (Applied Biosystems by Life Technologies; Carlsbad, CA) and di-deoxy-based Sanger sequencing reactions at the Clemson University Genomics
Institute (CUGI). All EST sequences were screened for
microsatellites to be assigned to the BMc series as
described in Blair et al. [6] and with the methods given
below.
SSR identification, primer design and microsatellite
amplification

SSRs were identified by screening the EST collections with
SSR Locator [20] with the default option of 1 to 6 nucleotide repeats. Primers were designed using Primer3 [21]
with the following conditions: optimum primer length of
20 nucleotides (nt, minimum 18 nt - maximum 26 nt),
optimum melting temperature of 50°C (min. 45°C - max.
55°C), an optimum product size of 125 base-pairs (bp,
min. 100 bp - max. 350 bp) and an optimum G/C content
of 50% (min. 45%- max. 55%). New markers were submitted as STS entries to GenBank and are listed in the
Additional file 1 (Table S1).
PCR reaction conditions for all newly designed BMc
markers and for the 248 BMc markers from Blair et al.
[6] are as follows: 30 ng of genomic DNA, 0.16 μM of
mixed forward and reverse primers, 1X Buffer (10 mM
de Tris-HCl pH 8.2, 50 mM KCl, Triton 0.1%, BSA
1mg/ml), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs and 1 U Taq
polymerase in 12 μL reaction volumes. Amplification
conditions were based on those described in Blair et al.
[6,22] with 35 cycles and 47°C annealing temperature.
PCR reaction products were run on PTC-200 thermal
cyclers (MJR, Bio-Rad Laboratories; Hercules, CA) and
then denatured at 94°C and run on 4% polyacrylamide
gels (5M urea, 0.5X TBE) in metal backed Owl T-Rex
vertical S3S gel units (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;
Waltham, MA) at constant 120 W. Silver staining was
performed as described in Blair et al. [22,23].
Germplasm survey

The set of genotypes used for the polymorphism survey in
this study was based on a germplasm panel of 18 genotypes described in Blair et al. [22] as panel I. Both the
DOR364 genotype, a Mesoamerican gene pool advanced
line from the International Center for Tropical Agriculture
(CIAT), and the G19833 genotype, an Andean gene pool
Peruvian landrace in the FAO collection at CIAT were
obtained from the gene bank in the Genetic Resources
Unit (GRU), and used in a polymorphism survey since

Page 3 of 10

these were the sources of the EST libraries we screened
for microsatellite loci. Along with these two genotypes the
germplasm survey included nine more domesticated
Mesoamerican accessions and varieties (G3513, G4825,
G11360, G11350, G14519, G21212, BAT477, BAT881 and
DOR390), four other domesticated Andean accessions or
varieties (G21078, G21657, G21242, Radical Cerinza) and
three wild accessions (G19892, G24390 and G24404)
representing Andean, Mesoamerican and Colombian wild
sub-populations) which were also provided by the GRU.
DNA extraction consisted in a CTAB based mini-prep
procedure as described in Afanador et al. [24] using bulk
leaf tissue from four greenhouse grown plants per genotype or line. Since the accessions were from lines separated by seed color and maintained at the gene bank, or
from advanced lines from the CIAT collection, we
assumed homozygosity for all the germplasm but noted
any double banding that could indicate a heterozygote or
heterogeneous mixture from the four plants. Although
beans are a highly inbreeding species (95 to 99%) some
outcrossing occurs occasionally so there can be some
within accession or intra-population variation and this
would be observable in any lanes containing more than
one band, representing more than one allele in seeds of
the accession.
Data analysis

Allele sizes were estimated for the survey panel and
mapping gels based on comparison with 10 and 25 bp
molecular weight ladders that were distributed twice on
each silver stained gel. A neighbor-joining (NJ) dendogram was constructed with the proportion of shared
alleles coefficient and matrix of alleles and genotypes for
the survey panel with the software programs Darwin
[25]. Polymorphism information content (PIC) was calculated for each marker with Powermarker [26].

Results
Comparisons of EST-SSR repeat types and marker
development

Among the SSR motifs identified (Table 1), trinucleotides were the most common with 99 out of 184
found (53.8%) while di-nucleotide repeats were the second most common with 57 out of 184 found (30.9%).
Meanwhile, only a few tetra-nucleotide (23) and penta-or
hexa-nucleotide (5) SSRs were observed. Across all the
EST sequencing sets the percentage of ESTs containing
SSRs varied from 3.5 to 11.9% with the highest number
found in the first sequencing of the leaf library and the
least in the second sequencing of the leaf library which
may have been due to sampling differences. The numbers
of SSRs per ESTs in the two root libraries were similar,
with 5.4% for the HP library and 4.8% for the LP library.
When comparing the leaf versus root tissues we found

that 6.9% of the leaf ESTs had SSRs while 5.1% of the
root ESTs had SSRs so the values were similar overall.
More tetra-nucleotide SSRs were found in leaf ESTs than
in root ESTs while the number of di-nucleotide SSRs in
relationship to the number of ESTs sequenced was similar in the two EST collections. Similar numbers of trinucleotides were found in ESTs from each type of tissue.
When comparing the specific motifs for SSRs found in
each set of ESTs (Table 2) we observed similar frequencies of specific types of motifs among the di-nucleotides
but different frequencies of specific types of motifs
among the tri-nucleotides. Overall among the di-nucleotides AG/CT/GA/TC microsatellites were much more
common than other types of di-nucleotide motifs with
41 out of 57 of these SSRs (71.9%). The next most common was the AT/TA microsatellites with 12 out of 57
of these SSRs (21.1%) while no CG/GC microsatellites
were found. Only four AC/GT/CA/TG microsatellites
were found constituting only 7.0% of the total

di-nucleotide repeat motif SSRs identified. Among the
tri-nucleotide SSRs, AAG/AGA/GAA/TTC/TCT/CTT
was the most common motif with 23% of the total followed by AGG/GAG/GGA/TCC/CTC/CCT with 16%.
The CGC and ATA-rich microsatellites were the least
common with all others being intermediate.
In the effort to develop additional cDNA-derived
microsatellites, we added 120 new BMc (bean microsatellites from cDNAs series) markers to the 248 previously
developed BMc markers [6]. Among the microsatellites,
the first seventeen (BMc1 to BMc17) were developed
from leaf cDNAs in the library described in [6,12] and as
shown in the Additional file 1 (Table S1). A second set of
leaf cDNA derived microsatellites from our second EST
sequencing effort in this library were designated as
BMc18 to BMc27. Meanwhile, 47 microsatellite markers
(BMc28 to BMc74 plus BMc77 to BMc109 except
BMc55 and BMc59) were developed from the HP root
library and 46 other microsatellite markers (BMc55,

No. of BMc markers

BMc59, BMc75, BMc76 and BMc78 to BMc108 as well as
BMc110 to BMc120) were developed from the LP root
cDNA libraries. In summary the largest number of new
cDNA derived microsatellites were found in the root
libraries (93 out of the 120) compared to the leaf library
(27 out of the 120).
Among the newly developed markers 50 were based
on di-nucleotide repeats, 66 on tri-nucleotide repeats
and 4 on tetra-, penta- or hexa-nucleotide repeats which
we generally avoided for primer design (Table 3). The
new markers produced expected product sizes from as
small as 80 to as large as 298, although the majority
were designed to be small PCR amplicons to avoid the
possibility of including exons. The average number of
repeats in the BMc markers (including both compound
and simple SSRs) was 6.8 repeats per microsatellite but
this varied from an average of 9.1 for di-nucleotide
motifs to 5.3 for tri-nucleotide motifs and 4.3 repeats
for other tetra, penta or hexa-repeat based motifs.
The highest repeat numbers were found for BMc70 (31
repeats) and BMc58 (26 repeats) as well as BMc30 and
BMc33 (23 repeats, each); all of which were based on dinucleotide motifs; the first and last two based on GAn
with the second based on CAn. Surprisingly, there were
few long ATn microsatellites, with the exception of BMc3
(26 repeats), but this may be due to the genic nature of
the microsatellites developed. The distribution of repeat
sizes among the BMc markers was skewed generally to
the smaller number of repeats; the reader is reminded
that the minimum number of repeats for di-nucleotides
was five and for tri-nucleotides was four while for all
other types it was three (Figure 1). Interestingly, a small
group of di-nucleotide microsatellites with large numbers
of repeats were found to the right of the graph and greater
skewing of di-nucleotide compared to tri-nucleotide
microsatellites was found towards the left of the graph.
When comparing the source tissue for the BMc markers, the ratio of di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotide markers
was similar for root and leaf derived microsatellites

different colors show the number of BMc markers from dinucleotide, tri-nucleotide and other (tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide) categories with different numbers of repeats.

(Table 3). These ratios held true for the proportion of
markers that had problems of non-amplification (16 out
of 120) or that were multi-copy (6 out of 120). The markers showing multiple monomorphic banding were
BMc30, BMc58, BMc60, BMc70, BMc92, and BMc96.
The ratio of simple to compound SSRs was 102 to 18
among the new BMc markers, 85% and 15% of the total
number of markers, respectively. Among the compound
repeats many were just due to an interruption of the
same repeat (7 out of 18). Therefore the percentage of
truly compound repeats was even lower (11 out of 120)
corresponding to 9.2% and the vast majority were simple,
perfect motif SSRs. Amplification strength was similar
for SSRs of different motifs and repeat lengths (Figure 2).
Genetic diversity detected

As described above, out of the 120 new BMc markers a
total of 98 microsatellites amplified well in the survey
panel and these were used for polymorphism survey for
the germplasm panel and diversity analysis. In this final
set of 98 functional markers, 59 (60.2%) were

average PIC value of the new polymorphic BMc markers
was 0.310 and ranged from 0.099 for the least polymorphic markers to 0.657 for the most polymorphic
marker (BMc70).
Polymorphism comparison of the di-nucleotide and
tri-nucleotide markers showed that they had similar
average PIC values (0.131 and 0.125, respectively) when
considering both monomorphic and polymorphic microsatellites together. A similar situation was observed
when considering only polymorphic microsatellites,
where di- and tri-nucleotide based markers again had
similar PIC values (0.322 and 0.301, respectively). None
of the tetra-, penta- or hexa-nucleotide repeat-based
markers was polymorphic.
Polymorphic markers were in similar proportion (38%
in each case) for the BMc markers from leaf ESTs (8
out of 21 functioning markers) and for the BMc markers
from root ESTs (30 out of 77 functioning markers).
Interestingly some polymorphic root-derived BMc markers (BMc30, BMc40, BMc58, BMc60 and BMc70)
showed monomorphic background bands suggesting
they were members of gene families with different
degrees of diversity in different homologs.
A set of five microsatellites (BMc17, BMc36, BMc44,
BMc61 and BMc68) was only polymorphic in the wild
accessions but not in the cultivated accessions or varieties. These markers had relatively low PIC values of
0.099 to 0.157. From the 368 current BMc markers,

including the 248 from the previous study of Blair et al.
[6] and the 120 described here, a total of 209 (56.8%) of
the BMc markers yielded monomorphic results while
159 (43.2%) produced polymorphic results in the germplasm survey.
The average PIC value of the full set 368 BMc microsatellites was calculated to be 0.291, while for all those that
were polymorphic the PIC value was 0.424. When the
diversity analysis with the newly-developed, cDNA-derived
markers BMc1 to BMc120 was undertaken (Figure 3a) we
found that the Andean and Mesoamerican gene pools
represented the main axis of the neighbor joining tree
upon which two of the wild accessions then showed a
divergence from the cultivated genotypes. The Argentinean accession G19892 grouped within the Andean genepool, while the highly diverse Colombian (G24404) and
Mexican (G24390) accessions were near the division of
the two gene pools. These results agree with the neighbor
joining analysis of Blair et al. [6] who evaluated the markers BMc121 to BMc368 (Figure 3b).
When the results of the phylogeny analysis of the newly
developed makers were combined with the previous markers from Blair et al. [6] an even clearer picture of the
associations emerged (Figure 3c). Although all dendrograms showed very highly supported nodes for the
separation of the two main gene pools and the two wild
accessions; in the combined analysis, we found very high
bootstrap values (ranging from 90 to 100%) based on the
strength of the total set of markers evaluated.

Discussion
The major achievements of this research were 1) to evaluate microsatellite frequency in three cDNA libraries
from root and leaf tissues with one of the root libraries
developed for the abiotic stress of low phosphorus and
2) to create additional genic microsatellite markers based
on low-level sequencing of these EST libraries to use in a
polymorphism survey both to understand common bean
genetic diversity and to understand the differences in various microsatellite types from different sources and their
ability to uncover bean diversity. The creation of new
genic microsatellites is especially pressing as only about
230 [2,7,8,27,28] had been reported before we started our
work on the design of BMc microsatellite markers.
In total we have now designed 368 genic microsatellites
in the BMc series between the efforts of this study and
the previous work of Blair et al. [6]; all BMc markers
were designed from cDNA libraries made from different
tissues of the mapping population parents used by Blair
et al. [12,23]. In addition, with this study we have created
BMc markers from two different genotypes including
G19833 and DOR364 and from leaf tissue and root tissues subjected to low or high phosphorus conditions.
The advantage of having markers developed from

sequences of both genotypes resides is the fact that the
Andean G19833 is being used for whole-genome shotgun
sequencing and the Mesoamerican DOR364 provides a
commercially useful tropical, small red seeded counterpart to the Andean genotype and to black beans which
have been better studied in terms of agronomy as well as
EST development [17].
In addition, both marker types from both genotype
sources are useful for evaluation in the reference map
based on DOR364 × G19833 studied by Blair et al. [2,23]
which is linked both the UC-Davis [29] and Univ. of Florida [30] genetic maps. In terms of the practical use of the
microsatellites, the PCR amplification strength was similar for SSRs of different motifs and repeat lengths, which
may be typical of gene-derived microsatellites and distinct from genomic microsatellites as first suggested by
Blair et al. [22].
In our previous study of cDNA derived microsatellites
[6] we found that uniformly strong PCR products were
obtained with the specific primer sets around the SSR
loci in cDNA sequences. In comparison, amplification
with non-gene based microsatellites is prone to some
pitfalls as discussed by Blair et al. [23] for AT-rich
microsatellites and Blair et al. [31] for hybridization

Blair et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:50

derived genomic microsatellites. Differences between
genic and different kinds of genomic microsatellites
have been observed for other marker sets as well
[7,32,33]. Although the SSR and EST sequencing effort
from most of these projects has been small it is useful
to have added their sequences to GenBank to compare
in the future to larger EST collections from Ramirez
et al. [17], Melotto et al. [18] and Thibivilliers et al. [19]
as well as future genomic sequences for common bean
or related species. Furthermore the possible role of
microsatellites as promoters or gene expression enhancers especially in root genes where many AGn microsatellites were found could be studied.
In terms of other di-nucleotide motifs, the lack of GC
microsatellites has been observed before within the bean
genome [6,31], while AT-rich microsatellites were not
expected to be found in genic sequences neither as dinucleotides nor tri-nucleotides such as those studied by
Blair et al. [23]. There were only a few ACn based microsatellites which was surprising given that enrichment for
this motif has yielded about the same number of markers
as enrichment with AG n or GA n based probes [7,34].
Among the tri-nucleotide motifs it appears that AAG
(23), ACC (12), AGC (12), AGG (16) and ATC (12)
microsatellites are the most common and this may have
to do with their frequency in triplet codon use for amino
acid incorporation into polypeptides. Additionally, open
reading frames are known to have a higher GC percentage than non-translated regions [35] which might favor
tri-nucleotide motifs such as ACC, AGC and AGG. Compared to the results of Blair et al. [6,31] the ratio of trinucleotide to di-nucleotide motifs was fairly high (99
versus 57 in total). Perhaps this was due to a majority
being located in the open reading frame rather than in
untranslated regions of the original mRNA transcripts
represented by the cDNA sequences.
In the second step of this study, we analyzed the potential of two different groups of BMc markers, one from
cDNA clone sequencing (120 BMc markers) and one
from cDNA hybridization with SSR motifs (248 BMc
markers developed from 497 positive cDNA clones) to be
used in phylogeny analysis. The full group of markers,
therefore, included a total of 368 BMc microsatellites all
evaluated against the same germplasm survey from Blair
et al. [6]. In that evaluation, genetic diversity was reliably
predicted by both types of cDNA based BMc microsatellites. Both sets of markers were useful in separating the
Andean and Mesoamerican genepool and accurately placing the wild accessions within each genepool. Two wild
accessions (Colombian and Mexican) were separated
from the cultivated accessions. Similar results were found
with the same diversity panel in Blair et al. [6].

In summary, cDNA derived markers seem to be very
useful for diversity analysis due to the fact that they are
derived from genic sequences that are conserved and are
highly transferable between different accessions of beans.
They were critical in recent studies of diversity in both
dry and snap bean cultivars of Phaseolus vulgaris [36,37].
Therefore, in the future we plan to analyze the frequency
of gene-based microsatellites in larger collections of ESTs
such as those of Ramirez et al. [17] or Thibivilliers et al.
[19] which surpass the numbers of ESTs evaluated in the
libraries we used here. It will be interesting to see if SSR
frequency is similar or different for the multiple libraries
used by the first of these authors or the larger set of
ESTs from a single rust-infected leaf library evaluated by
the second research group. One lesson from this microsatellite evaluation is that it is important to test new markers for consistent patterns of genetic diversity detection.
We also plan to test the gene-derived markers in related
Phaseolus species.

Conclusions
In terms of the evaluation of genetic diversity we found
that genic microsatellites from both EST sequencing
and hybridization based approaches performed equally
well in distinguishing Andean and Mesoamerican genepools and the Argentinean, Colombian and Mexican
wild beans as separate accessions. Therefore, these
markers can be used for diversity analysis and for
breeding especially in crosses between wild and cultivated beans or between genepools. We expect that
next generation sequencing will make the discovery of
new transcriptome-based SSRs even easier than the
two approaches used so far. Nonetheless, the utility of
cDNA derived microsatellites for diversity analysis is
well established and is perhaps best explained due to
their conservation and slower rate of evolution than
genomic microsatellites. In summary, gene-based or
‘genic’ microsatellites appear to be especially useful for
genetic analysis of common bean and it would be ideal
to have a larger set of these markers for functional
diversity analysis and perhaps association mapping
once they are genetically mapped which will be the
subject of a separate manuscript to define the regions
of the genome that are part of the transcriptome.
Finally, these gene-based markers may be the keys to
selection of specific traits as they represent expressed
genes some of which are likely to have multiple functional alleles with diverse phenotypes as a result. Simple sequence repeats in promoter regions have
sometimes been found to be important in controlling
gene expression and this may be the case for some of
the genic markers discovered in this study as well.
