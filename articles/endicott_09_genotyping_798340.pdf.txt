Abstract
Background: Progress in the field of human ancient DNA studies has been severely restricted due
to the myriad sources of potential contamination, and because of the pronounced difficulty in
identifying authentic results. Improving the robustness of human aDNA results is a necessary prerequisite to vigorously testing hypotheses about human evolution in Europe, including possible
admixture with Neanderthals. This study approaches the problem of distinguishing between
authentic and contaminating sequences from common European mtDNA haplogroups by applying
a multiplexed Single-Base-Extension assay, containing both control and coding region sites, to DNA
extracted from the Tyrolean Iceman.
Results: The multiplex assay developed for this study was able to confirm that the Iceman's
mtDNA belongs to a new European mtDNA clade with a very limited distribution amongst modern
data sets. Controlled contamination experiments show that the correct results are returned by the
multiplex assay even in the presence of substantial amounts of exogenous DNA. The overall level
of discrimination achieved by targeting both control and coding region polymorphisms in a single
reaction provides a methodology capable of dealing with most cases of homoplasy prevalent in
European haplogroups.
Conclusion: The new genotyping results for the Iceman confirm the extreme fallibility of human
aDNA studies in general, even when authenticated by independent replication. The sensitivity and
accuracy of the multiplex Single-Base-Extension methodology forms part of an emerging suite of
alternative techniques for the accurate retrieval of ancient DNA sequences from both anatomically
modern humans and Neanderthals. The contamination of laboratories remains a pressing concern
in aDNA studies, both in the pre and post-PCR environments, and the adoption of a forensic style
assessment of a priori risks would significantly improve the credibility of results.

Background
It is often hoped that the fields of ancient DNA (aDNA)
and population genetics will converge to provide novel
insights into human prehistory, but there have been very
few convincing aDNA studies conducted on human
remains, due to the difficulty of differentiating between
authentic results and contaminating DNA [1-4]. This
problem is particularly acute when the putative endogenous sequences are similar to possible contaminants,
and for this reason the most credible research has been
restricted to the investigation of remains with highly distinctive, individual or population-specific, genetic signatures, e.g. [5-8]. Consequently, a number of high-profile
human aDNA studies have been questioned on the
grounds of insufficient proof of authenticity [1,9-12].
Traditionally, the molecular tool for the identification of
both endogenous human DNA and potential contaminant sequences has been the comparatively high levels of
polymorphism found in the first and second hypervariable sections (HVS1, HVS2) of the mitochondrial
(mtDNA) control region. The rapid rate of evolution in
this short stretch of the molecule increases the likelihood
of encountering multiple distinctive single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in single overlapping polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) products. However, in practice, the
utility of the control region for this purpose is often compromised by elevated levels of homoplasy, where identical sequences can be shared between different haplotypes.
This has lead to an increasing use of hierarchical coding
region SNPs to better discriminate between separate haplotypes with identical HVS1 sequences [13]. Whilst this is
relatively unproblematic for modern DNA samples, in the
case of ancient samples, such as the Iceman, the production of control and coding region sequences in separate
PCRs makes it difficult to unequivocally rule out contamination as the source of individual results [12,14,15]. So,
paradoxically, the most credible examples of this
approach are those where the control region motif is
already distinctive in its own right, and the provision of a
single additional SNP often provides no significant additional resolution, as with the five Amerindian mtDNA
haplogroups, e.g. [16,17].
The most critical factor affecting the accurate genotyping
of mtDNA data comprised of both SNPs and control
region sequences is the reliability of interpreting unlinked
PCR products. These may be subject to sporadic contamination and differential amplification of endogenous and
contaminant DNA. One way to address this issue for SNPs
is to simultaneously characterise multiple polymorphic
sites in a two-stage multiplex reaction using a linear Single-Base-Extension (SBE) mini-sequencing reaction [1822]. These can overcome many of the problems inherent
in providing phylogenetic resolution for human aDNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/29

samples and, in principle, may be able to differentiate
between endogenous DNA and a possible contaminant
from the same mtDNA haplogroup. Here, we extend this
principle to genotype both control region polymorphisms
and hierarchical coding regions SNPs within a single multiplexed SBE reaction (K-plex). This is used to obtain a
detailed genotype of the Tyrolean Iceman's mtDNA using
three separate extracts made from samples of bone and
faecal material. The robustness of the results are explored
through controlled contamination experiments using SBE
reactions and quantitative PCR, and by providing an evaluation of the a priori possibility of obtaining an identical
genotype from contaminants originating within the laboratory. The discussion includes a detailed reanalysis of the
original study of the Iceman's mtDNA [14] and the conclusions serve to highlight the problems of achieving
authentic results from European aDNA samples in general, and the fallibility of independent replication, in particular.

Results
Cloned Sequences
The results from initial PCR amplification and direct
sequencing of the three new DNA extracts are reported in
Figure 1 and Table 1 and characterise the Iceman's diagnostic control region polymorphisms. The first hyper-variable section (HVS1) between nucleotide positions (nps)
16040 and 16401, revealed three consistent polymorphisms (16224C-16311C-16362C), relative to the revised
Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) [23,24], in all
clones from all samples (see additional file 1 showing
clones covering the key sites nps 16311 and 16362 from
all three extracts). There were no positive results obtained
from the corresponding extraction blanks and negative
controls used in each amplification. The results suggest
that the mtDNA belongs to K1* by virtue of matching the
revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) [24] at nps
497 (K1a), 498 (K1c) and 5913 (K1b), whilst being
derived at nps 1189 and 10398 (both K1). Importantly,
the presence of the transition at np 8137 is unique within
contemporary hg K [13], and the mutation at np 16362
was not reported in the original study of the Iceman's
mtDNA [14].
K1 SBE multiplex
Due to the difficulty inherent in proving that results
matching the reference sequence at nps 497, 498 and
5913 were not due to contamination [12], a multiplex
SBE assay (K1-plex) was designed to test for these three
HVS1 polymorphisms (16224C-16311C-16362C), plus
nine hierarchical SNPs from both the control and coding
regions. The multiplex results revealed transitions at nps
1189, 1811, 9698, 10398 and 14167 (Table 2), indicating
membership of the human mtDNA sub-haplogroup K1
[13], as previously suggested by [15,25]. In addition,

PCR results for the three extracts of the Iceman's DNA (HB49, HB50, BPE1). The results place the Iceman's
mtDNA into a new (undefined) phylogenetic position (K1*) whilst also reporting the transitions at nps 8137 and 16362. Human
mtDNA mutations are scored relative to the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) [23,24], so the Tyrolean Iceman's
mtDNA is 'ancestral' at the three positions (C497T, G5913A, 498delC) that define K1a, K1b, and K1c. The sites tested in, 1
[14], 2 [15] and 3this study, are shown to compare the phylogenetic discrimination achieved. Critically, the 16362C polymorphism was not reported in the original study [14] and not tested for in [15]. A recent study [25] explored the entire mtDNA
genome of the Iceman by singleplex PCR and has reported all of the polymorphisms listed in Table 1.

In this table alleles derived from the revised reference sequence (rCRS) are shown in bold and with gray background. The consensus (Con.) is given above the Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS)
[23,24] in the last but one row. The alleles 263G, 1189C, 1811G, 9055A, 9698C, 14167T, 16224C and 16311C are typical of haplogroup (hg) K1, lying within macro-haplogroup R of the human mtDNA
genealogy [13]. The Iceman's mtDNA is further characterised by 8137T (so far unique within hg K) and 16362C. The last two columns (P1, P2) give the 5 prime position of each primer used for the
amplification, full details of which are in additional file 4.

because the Iceman's sequence matches the rCRS at nps
497, 498, and 5913 (diagnostic of K1a, K1c, and K1b,
respectively), we can extend previous suggestions that the
Iceman's genotype does not belong to any of the three
known clades of K1, and should be referred to a new
(undefined) paraphyletic clade, of K1 [25] (Figure 1). A
transition at np 8137, previously discovered by singleplex
assay of the Iceman's mtDNA, was confirmed by the multiplex SBE results, and is currently unique within hg K
[13]. All multiplex results were cross-checked by cloned
single-plex PCR results to investigate the potential for
false positives in the SBE reaction. The allelic state of each
of the 11 SNPs matched the multiplex results (details of
all singleplexes are given in Table 1).
Crucially, the actual SBE traces (Figure 2) show that the
results originated from a single effective population of
DNA templates because there were no additional alleles at
any of the sites tested. The use of multiplexed SBE also
ensured that those hg K1 diagnostic sites matching the
rCRS (nps 497, 498, 5913) were not a result of contamination, or sample mix-up, because all were typed concurrently in a single assay, together with other SNPs
(16362C, 8137T) diagnostic of the Iceman's mtDNA.
Real-time PCR quantification (see additional file 2) indicated that the multiplex assay was initiated with the equivalent of ~36,000 molecules of mtDNA capable of
amplifying 60 bp and that inhibition was not detected.
This effective copy number is consistent with the absence
of repetitive damage motifs amongst the clones and the
lack of allelic drop-out in the SBE results [26].
Contamination controls
To further test the potential effect of contamination on the
results, a second K1 multiplex assay was performed with
the addition of various quantities of a second DNA extract
(hg J) to imitate the role of modern contaminant. This
produced clearly observable double peaks (representing
different alleles at the same site) across a large range of
dilutions (Figure 3), confirming the presence of two populations of templates. The lowest quantity of contaminant
detected by the multiplex assay was measured by real-time

quantitative PCR to be equivalent to ~4% of the total
starting copy number. As the proportion of the contaminant increases, so do the secondary peaks, but even at levels of ~20% it is still possible to unambiguously
distinguish the two separate populations of templates.
This result strongly supports the conclusion from the
cloned HVS1 sequences (Figure S1) that the same single
endogenous population of templates is represented in the
three extracts of the Iceman's DNA.
We also typed the mtDNA of all workers involved in the
study, from the removal of the samples from the mummy
in Italy to the extraction of the DNA in Oxford and no
individual had mtDNA belonging to hg K. Although positive results from extraction blanks and PCR negative controls did not occur during the present study, a human
contaminant was identified amongst earlier work conducted in the Oxford isolation facility. This was from a
modern source of hg K mtDNA with the control region
motif 16224C-16311C (i.e. without 16362C) and was
eliminated by modification to laboratory protocols
regarding common consumables (see Methods).
This hg K contaminant, together with all aDNA extracts
with putative European mtDNA prepared in the isolation
facility, is listed in additional file 3 but these sequences
include no examples of hg K with 16362C. Therefore, at
the time that the research into the Iceman's mtDNA was
conducted, the probability of obtaining a matching hg K
contaminant in the Henry Wellcome Ancient Biomolecules Centre appears to have been extremely low.

Discussion
The significance and authenticity of the transition
T16362C
Revisiting the mtDNA of the Tyrolean Iceman has raised
the issue of how to differentiate between conflicting but
highly similar sets of aDNA results, in this case from independent studies of the same individual [[14,15,25], this
study]. Although each study obtained hg K mtDNA in
their PCR products, only two reported the 16362C polymorphism [[25], this study]. Therefore, there would

For the sake of consistency with Table 1, alleles read from the forward DNA strand, relative to the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS)
[23,24], unlike Figures 2 and 3 that show the state according to the actual strand targeted by the SBE assay. These results are identical to the cloned
singleplex results shown in Table 1, demonstrating consistent genotyping of the Iceman by different methods. As all these results were obtained in a
single multiplex reaction, credibility is given to those reactions returning the rCRS. Such results in a singleplex scenario could be explained by
contamination of an individual assay by any non hg K mtDNA source.

and eight additional phylogenetically informative SNPs. The SBE results are differentiated by a combination of the alleles and their electrophoretic mobility, determined by the length of the primers (see Table S4). All alleles are called relative to
the strand of origin targeted in the SBE reaction; those from the reverse strand should be complemented to be consistent with
the rCRS (see Table S2). Positions 5913 and 498 (the smaller peak of the two) have coalesced slightly due to departures from
the predicted electrophoretic mobility of the SBE primers. Minor peaks to the left and immediately adjacent of some SNP positions represent background noise, due to variation in length of some SBE primers and can be ignored. There is some background noise evident on the A system but only the peak at the 16362 position is in the correct position to represent
contamination (see Fig. 3).

appear to be multiple sources of hg K mtDNA templates
involved because of this difference in the control region
motifs. It is important to note that this single base change
(T>C) cannot derive from post-mortem damage to the
mtDNA molecule because this results in C>T changes
only, from the deamination of cytosine to uracil, which is
read as a thymine, and appears as a G>A on the opposite
strand [27]. Therefore, an erroneous T>C transition could
only derive from an artefact of PCR, but the chances of
this occurring in multiple amplifications from our three
samples, and for the same artefact becoming fixed in every
PCR product, appear to be remote. The lack of variation at
all the sites we tested, both in cloned sequences and SBE
assays, is only consistent with the presence of a single
population of mtDNA templates from all three extracts
with the control region motif of 16224C-16311C16362C, for which the a priori probability of these deriving from a common contaminant, either of the laboratory
or the sampling procedure, has been demonstrated to be
extremely low.

Phylogenetic evidence of authenticity
The likelihood of the current results representing the
endogenous DNA of the Iceman is substantially increased
by the haplotype falling outside of K1a/K1b/K1c, combined with the unique hg K transition C8137T, matching
the results of [25]. A Genbank search reveals two contemporary coding region genomes (SO44 from [28] and Oc05
from [29]) that can be securely assigned to the same paraphyletic K1* position as the Iceman and which share three
coding region polymorphisms (see Figure 4). Only one, a
Dutch sample (SO44 from [28]) has a published control
region sequence, but this also displays the T16362C transition. We propose that these two genomes define a new
clade K1d defined by the coding region motif of 4856C5592G-8901G. This finding provides some support for
the proposal of a single European paraphyletic clade of
mtDNA hg K1 defined by the 16362C polymorphism
[25]. However, the use of a single mutational hotspot (i.e.
np 16362, which occurs at least eight times on the hg K
background alone) for this purpose is usually discouraged
[30]. If all these genomes belong to a single clade, then

Results of the contamination assay showing the G/A system from three different multiplex SBE reactions
(MP1, MP2, MP3), initiated with the Iceman's DNA mixed with three different amounts of an hg J contaminant. Because the contaminant has ancestral alleles at nps 16224, 16311 and 16362, this causes additional peaks to appear in
the A system (highlighted). The small peak to the left of 16362A in each case is background noise (i.e. not due to primer length
variation which would produce multiple peaks of varying size, see the G system in Figure 2. This does not interfere with the
base calling because it is outside the range of either the 00497 or 16362 SBE primers. The sensitivity of this method is demonstrated by its ability to detect the second population of templates (hg J) at the level of ~4%; even at levels of ~20% contamination, the results for the Iceman's mtDNA are unambiguous and unaffected by the contaminant. The ability to test multiple sites
in a single reaction, in the presence of contaminants, without the need to clone individual PCR products, represents a significant advantage of the SBE methodology.

convention suggests that it should be named K1d, following the cladistic rules for the hierarchical ordering of haplogroups and sub-haplogroups formalised by [31].
The perils of contamination
The difference between the conclusions of the original
study and the current consensus of the Iceman's mtDNA
control region might appear to be trivial. Yet the implications are actually of the utmost importance and warrant a
detailed reanalysis of the original data. This is because the
absence of the 16362C allele amongst the results of Handt
et al [14], suggests that they genotyped a different hg K
individual. Reanalysis of the original data reveals the presence of at least two populations of templates (Figure 5a).
One of these is a variant of human mtDNA hg J (defined
by the motif 16069T-16126C-16390A) [21,32], whilst the

other observable haplotype (16093C-16224C-16311C) is
a common occurrence within hg K [13].
Appropriate Molecular Behaviour
The published consensus sequence excluded the transition detected at np 16093 on the basis that it did not feature in the 100 bp product [14]. This short sequence was
argued to have been more likely to represent the endogenous DNA on the basis of appropriate molecular behaviour [14]. This concept predicts that the shortest
amplification product, in the presence of modern contaminants, is more likely to represent the endogenous DNA
[33,34] (but see also [35]). As we have demonstrated that
the mtDNA of our Iceman extracts does not contain the
16093C allele, it is conceivable that the 100 bp product of
Handt et al. [14] did originate from DNA endogenous to
the sample. Support for, or against, this conclusion can be

sought from the clones for sequences including np 16362.
It was recently suggested that the lack of the 16362C allele
amongst the Handt et al. sequences may partly be attributable to the production of chimeras amongst these longer
amplicons [25]. The obvious mixture of alleles at nps
16093, 16311 and 16390 (clones 1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 16, 17,
19–21, and 24–26; Figure 5a) demonstrate that either
these sites were subject to post-mortem damage or hg K
mtDNA templates were involved in 'jumping PCR' events
with contaminants [36]. Yet, of all the clones covering the
upper portion of the control region sequence (1–17, and
28–34), none contain the key transition at np 16362. This
suggests that the extraction actually contained a different
source of hg K mtDNA to the single mtDNA sequence
recovered in [25] and the present study.
The fallibility of independent replication
Given the absence of 16093C and 16362C amongst the
replication results of Handt et al., the only plausible conclusion is that these derived from a second, entirely different, hg K source. These results, combined with a unique
haplotype in [25] and the present study, strongly suggests
that both laboratories in the original study suffered from
hg K contamination. The mtDNA profiles of the staff in
the primary laboratory of the first study were not provided
[14]; although a subsequent publication of the replicated
results [37] disclosed that a member of the secondary laboratory staff was hg K (16224C-16311C), substantially
increasing the likelihood for contamination occurring. It
is important to note that the independent replication step,
in this case, did not technically fail. Instead, the analysis
did not manage to distinguish between these two nonidentical sources of hg K mtDNA, neither of which appear
to have derived from the Iceman. The fallibility of the
original, independently replicated, study emphasizes why
unlinked singleplex PCR results may not be sufficient
proof of authenticity. This is particularly problematic

changes that can arise as a product of post-mortem modifications to DNA templates [25].
Recommendations for future human aDNA research
Criteria of authenticity
We suggest that any contamination risk assessment in
human aDNA research would be improved through the
incorporation of an analysis of the a priori probability that
the extract will be contaminated. Human aDNA studies
are now routinely providing genetic characterisation of
individuals who have been involved in the manipulation
of a sample, e.g. [17]. For an accurate evaluation of the
true risk, in a way that would satisfy common international standards in forensic science, it is also necessary to
supply data on false positives and other previous amplification of similar genotypes from the laboratories con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/29

cerned. The presence of hg K mtDNA amongst the
common reagents of the laboratory in the present study
confirms how consumables can be a source of contamination [38], with obvious implications for the efficacy of
independent replication. The findings of the present study
provide clear evidence why, as with any scientific investigation, all reasonable efforts to falsify human aDNA
results should be made, even when controls such as independent replication are known to be fallible under certain
circumstances [39]. This is clearly the case for human
aDNA research carried out on European remains in European laboratories.
Identifying DNA haplotypes using multiple SNPs
The use of the K1-plex demonstrates the potential power
of discrimination achievable by linking control and coding region sites in a single SBE multiplex. Although the
fortuitous circumstances of a unique maternal lineage
cannot be expected in the majority of human aDNA studies, this kind of multiplexed approach should in many situations be able to identify where DNA templates from
two or more discrete individuals are present. So, the
standards applied here should not be taken as a reference
for other research using human DNA extracts that fall
squarely into more mainstream situations. Nevertheless,
the linking of all loci in one multiplex SBE reaction can
still improve the security of interpretation, whilst assisting
in the identification of possible contamination events and
helping to conserve irreplaceable aDNA extracts.

Conclusion
This study has highlighted the potential fallibility of the
interpretation of human aDNA results, and the need for a
forensic style assessment of risks associated with the production of data. Independent replication remains a core
component of authentication strategies for human aDNA
studies, and it is paramount that this test is applied critically to function properly. More stringent controls are
required to move the field forward, both a priori and a posteriori, for the production and interpretation of data; in
particular, the disclosure of all possible sources of contamination in aDNA studies using generic hominin primers. In PCR-based studies, this data should include genetic
profiles of the workers involved for whichever target loci
are being investigated.
The use of multiplex SBE assays offer one solution for
authenticating human aDNA results and screening novel
genome data. In the present study the K1 multiplex accurately genotyped the Iceman's mtDNA and has independently confirmed it belongs to a novel lineage of mtDNA
hg K. A novel aspect of this approach is the ability to link
SNPs from both the control and coding regions of the
mtDNA genome in a single reaction, reducing the possibility of contamination affecting the results. In a control-

Phylogenetic tree of the main branches of human mtDNA hg K1 showing the western European paraphyletic
lineages falling outside of K1a, K1b and K1c. All mutations are transitions unless indicated by a letter. Dotted lines indicate samples for which replicated whole genome data is not available; SNPs denoted in bold are those tested in the K1 multiplex; the tree is rooted in African hg L3. All lineages with 16362C are grouped by parsimony into a single potential European
paraphyletic clade. The clade of K1d is defined by three coding region mutations shared between SO44 and Oc5 from [29].
Together with a single example of K1* from Iran [13] (not shown), these represent the sum total of hg K1 mtDNA lineages
currently known to fall outside of K1a\K1b\K1c, amongst a worldwide survey of over 1000 haplogroup K samples (1Howell et
al., 2003 [28]; 2this study; 3 Genbank direct submission).

control region sequences from [14] (the nucleotide positions are listed in the top row, whilst the first column refers to the
number of each clone). There are two clearly identifiable European mtDNA haplotypes belonging to hg K (16093C-16224C16311C, clones 1–11 and potentially 19–43), and hg J (16069T-16126C-16390A, clones 12–16). The absence of both 16093C
and 16126C from the shortest (100 bp) amplification product (clones 44–55) indicates the presence of at least three populations of templates. Positions of template switching ('jumping PCR') are indicated by brown highlighting, and evident by the
replacement of the expected mutation either by the rCRS (no letter), or a polymorphism from a different template. Critically,
there are no examples of the 16362C polymorphism in any templates covering this position. (b) Results from the independent
replication [37] which were only indirectly sequenced (not cloned), identifying just the two control region transitions basal to

Methods
Two samples of bone removed from the ileum, and one of
faecal matter from the rectum were digested in temporally
separated extractions (4 ml total volume) by a previously
published protocol [22]. One extraction blank was produced for each sample, and PCRs also included negative
controls.
The specialist Ancient Biomolecules Centre (ABC) at
Oxford was used to extract DNA, and set up PCR reactions. The ABC is physically isolated, subject to stringent
anti-contamination procedures, equipped with positive
air pressure and UV lighting, and has a DNA laboratory
and equipment (glove box, instruments, full body suits,
protective masks, etc.) dedicated solely to ancient human
specimens. The thermal cycling reactions and subsequent
downstream work took place in a separate laboratory
located in the Department of Zoology.
Initial singleplex PCRs on the control region were conducted with primers listed in additional file 4 and cloned
by previously published protocols [22]. Several hierarchical SNPs from the human mtDNA phylogeny together
with haplogroup K specific SNPs were identified [13,40]
using additional singleplex PCR primers designed to be
compatible under multiplex PCR conditions [26].
The three control region SNPs, located in the singleplex
PCRs, were combined with key SNPs from major clades of
the hg K phylogeny, to form the K1 multiplex. A selection
of higher order hierarchical SNPs from the human phylogeny were also included to check the consistency of
results across additional loci [13,40]. This integration of
all diagnostic sites into a single assay reduces the range of
explanations required when results do not conform to

expectations because the possibility of sample mix up is
eliminated.
The initial multiplex PCR was performed using 2 μl of
DNA extract in a 25 μl reaction volume using primers
listed in additional file 5 by a previously published protocol [22]. SBE reactions were performed in a total volume
of 5 μl with 0.5 μl purified PCR product, 2.5 μl SNaPshot™
reaction mix (AB) and 0.5 μl SBE primer mix (SBE primers
listed in additional file 6). Negative controls were
included in both stages of the assay to assess the potential
for contamination.
Automated allele calls were made using macros constructed in Genotyper 3.7 (AB). Primer concentrations
were adjusted to give balanced amounts of products and
peak heights, concentrating on the SBE reaction [19]. All
primers were synthesized and reverse-phase HPLC purified by Biomers.net GmbH (Ulm, Germany). A detailed
protocol for the optimization of SBE multiplexes is available elsewhere [26].
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was conducted on the HB50
aDNA bone extract and a modern DNA sample (belonging to the mitochondrial hg J) in 25 μl reaction volumes,
using SYBR Green PCR master-mix (AB), 300 nM humanspecific primers, synthesized template standards (see
additional file 7) and an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of
95°C for 15 sec, and 60°C for 60 sec). All samples were
run in triplicate with two 1:4 serial dilutions. The standards were also run in triplicate with 1:9 dilutions ranging
from 106-102 copies per μl. The adjusted R2 value of all
assays performed was equal to a minimum of 99%, and
PCR efficiency, in each case, was calculated with the for[

Once the effective copy number of the modern DNA was
known, a range of dilutions were run against the HB50
extract in a relative quantification, using the same primers
and conditions, until the reported copy number of both
the ancient and modern extracts were equivalent. The
multiplex contamination experiments were then performed using successive serial dilutions of the hg J contaminant mixed with constant quantities of the aDNA
extract to seed the multiplex PCR. This procedure provides
a detailed measure of the sensitivity of the SBE methodology for identifying and estimating the amount of contamination present in an aDNA extract through the
incorporation of additional peaks at segregating sites.
All contamination experiments, thermal cycling reactions
and downstream work took place in a separate laboratory
located in the Department of Zoology. All relevant personnel in this study had their mtDNA typed. The two
researchers who took the samples from the Iceman have
mtDNA matching hg H and hg J1b. All aDNA work in
Oxford (extractions, singleplex and multiplex PCRs) were
carried out by PE, who is hg H.
