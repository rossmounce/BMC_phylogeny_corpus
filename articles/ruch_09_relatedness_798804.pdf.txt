Abstract
Background: Cooperative hunting and foraging in spiders is rare and prone to cheating such that
the actions of selfish individuals negatively affect the whole group. The resulting social dilemma may
be mitigated by kin selection since related individuals lose indirect fitness benefits by acting selfishly.
Indeed, cooperation with genetic kin reduces the disadvantages of within-group competition in the
subsocial spider Stegodyphus lineatus, supporting the hypothesis that high relatedness is an
important pre-adaptation in the transition to sociality in spiders. In this study we examined the
consequences of group size and relatedness on cooperative feeding in the subsocial spider S.
tentoriicola, a species suggested to be at the transition to permanent sociality.
Results: We formed groups of 3 and 6 spiders that were either siblings or non-siblings. We found
that increasing group size negatively affected feeding efficiency but that these negative effects were
reduced in sib-groups. Sib groups were more likely to feed cooperatively and all group members
grew more homogenously than groups of unrelated spiders. The measured differences did not
translate into differential growth or mortality during the experimental period of 8 weeks.
Conclusion: The combination of our results with those from previous studies indicates that the
conflict between individual interests and group interests may be reduced by nepotism and that the
latter promote the maintenance of the social community.

Background
A so-called 'tragedy of the commons' [1] arises when
groups of animals or humans exploit a common resource
and the selfish actions of individuals negatively affect
group performance [2]. The extent of negative effects can
range from a small reduction of benefits up to a point
where the effects are detrimental to all members of the
group. Examples include the formation of fruiting bodies
in microbes [3], slime moulds [4], and the overexploita-

tion of public goods, such as the environment [5] and the
global climate by humans [6].
Social spiders create a common good if they communally
hunt a large prey item that they digest as a group [7].
Cooperative hunting and foraging is rare in spiders and if
it occurs, it is restricted to family groups [8-10]. Genetic

ically social Stegodyphus lineatus spiders, supporting the
view that kin selection is an important force in the evolution of sociality in these spiders [7]. The finding that cooperating with genetic kin reduces the disadvantages of
within-group competition provides support for the
hypothesis that high relatedness is a crucial step in the
transition to sociality in spiders [10], as controversially
discussed for the eusocial insects [11-13]. Genetic analyses have shown that permanent social spider colonies can
be described as clones, with no or little genetic variation
within and no gene flow among colonies [14-16]. This
pattern arises because all permanently social spider species regularly inbreed [10]. Regular inbreeding is an evolutionary paradox because it removes all advantages
associated with sexual reproduction and recombination
[17] while the risks and costs [18] are largely retained.
These costs of sex may be diminished through a primary
sex ratio shift towards females, which is another convergent trait of all social spiders [10,19]. Strong benefits of
genetic similarity may offset at least part of the costs. In
the genus Stegodyphus, three species are social, and the
remaining 14 species are periodically social [20,21]. The
behaviour and ecology of only one of the periodically
social species, S. lineatus, has been studied yet [22-24]. A
recent molecular phylogeny suggests that S. lineatus is separated from the other species [20] and supports that the
latter form three subgroups around the permanently
social species that evolved independently within the
genus [21]. To gain insights about evolutionary pathways
towards sociality and inbreeding, the study of social species and their subsocial closely related sister species may
be a particularly fruitful approach.
S. tentoriicola is sister to the social S. dumicola [20,21] and
unpublished observations suggest that its social juvenile
phase is extended in comparison to S. lineatus [10]. A field
study revealed that rates of polyandry - female mating
with multiple sires - are lower than in the congener S. lineatus which indicates that relatedness within broods is relatively increased [25]. This implies that sibling groups
meet the expectations for high genetic similarity required
to evolve cooperation [12]. Here we investigated whether
genetic relatedness reduces the tragedy of the commons in
S. tentoriicola. We compared cooperation during group
feeding in genetically similar and dissimilar groups of
juveniles from S. tentoriicola, using a protocol previously
applied to S. lineatus [7]. In S. lineatus, Schneider and
Bilde [7] showed that genetic similarity and not familiarity among groups members carried benefits of cooperation. It is a parsimonious assumption that similar
mechanisms apply in S. tentoriicola and that familiarity
does not play a role. We tested the effect of group size on
benefits of kin cooperation by comparing feeding efficiency and growth of groups of two different sizes with
singly feeding spiders. We ask whether the size of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/257

group per se and the size of the feeding group (the members actually participating in the feeding event) play a role
in determining feeding efficiency, and we examine how
relatedness interacts with the dynamics of cooperation
and competition by investigating the performance of the
group in terms of feeding efficiency, growth and mortality. This study design allows us to assess the generality of
previous findings on the existence of a social dilemma in
communally feeding spiders, and on the role of nepotism
for the resolution of this dilemma. This has implications
for understanding the evolution of sociality in spiders.

Results
Effect of group size on feeding, growth and mortality
Generally, not all group members fed when a single prey
item was introduced into their web. Hence, in groups of 6
spiders, on average three spiders shared a prey (3.3 ± 0.21
spiders feeding, n = 20), while in groups of 3 spiders
mostly two or one spider fed (mean ± SD: 1.6 ± 0.16 spiders feeding, n = 22, One-factorial test: χ2 = 19.76, DF = 1,
p ≤ 0.0001). Below, we will refer to small (total group size
= 3) and large foraging groups (total group size = 6),
respectively.

Within a feeding period of two hours, prey items lost
weight and this weight loss was an increasing function of
the number of spiders that fed on it: large groups extracted
14.79 ± 7.55 mg (n = 20) from a fly; small groups
extracted 11.98 ± 6.90 mg (n = 22); single spiders
extracted 6.69 ± 4.13 mg (n = 11) (Kruskal-Wallis-Anova:
χ2 = 26.26, DF = 2, p ≤ 0.0001, Tukey-Kramer HSD, p ≤
0.05, significant difference across all groups [large groups,
small groups, single spiders]). The values are means over
the repeated trials per group.
Even though large groups extracted more than small
groups or singles, the mean per capita induced weight loss
decreased with increasing groups size: single spiders
extracted the most out of the prey (9.95 ± 0.85 mg, n = 11)
and large groups the least (three: 7.22 ± 0.73 mg, n = 22,
six: 5.10 ± 0.32 mg, n = 20) (Kruskal-Wallis-Anova: χ2 =
23.13, DF = 2, p ≤ 0.001, Tukey-Kramer HSD, p ≤ 0.05,
significant difference across all groups [large groups, small
groups, single spiders]). However, this difference did not
translate into significantly different growth (relative mass
increase over observation period of 8 weeks, single: 0.35 ±
0.05, n = 10, three: 0.28 ± 0.02, n = 19, six: 0.32 ± 0.17, n
= 19, Kruskal-Wallis-Anova: χ2 = 1.88, DF = 2, p = 0.39).
We included trial number as random factor into a general
linear mixed model (GLMM) and tested the influences of
total group size as well as feeding group size on feeding
efficiency (Table 1). Interestingly, the significant effect of
total group size arises from a significantly higher feeding
efficiency in small groups as compared to singles and large
groups (Tukey-Kramer HSD, p ≤ 0.05). The reason for this

likely is the frequent feeding of single individuals as well
as the advantage in hunting time that may balance out disadvantages in feeding efficiency as long as groups are very
small.
Mortality was significantly lower in single spiders than in
groups (single: 7.7 ± 7.7%, n = 13, three: 9.1 ± 5.5%, n =
22, six = 13.3 ± 5.2%, n = 20, Kruskal-Wallis-Anova: χ2 =
6.1, DF = 2, p = 0.047, Tukey-Kramer HSD, p ≤ 0.05, no
significant differences between the groups).
Effect of genetic relatedness on feeding, growth and
mortality
The influence of relatedness on feeding performance was
analysed separately for the two different group sizes
(small and large). In this analysis, feeding events of single
individuals were excluded.
Small groups
Only the number of feeding animals per trial explained a
significant proportion of the mass extracted from a prey
item in small groups (Table 2). The larger the feeding
group, the more mass did the fly lose. Relatedness and
trial number and their interaction were not significant.
The number of spiders that participated in prey-sharing
did not differ between sib and non-sib groups (One-factorial-test: non-sibs: 1.57 ± 0.23 spiders (n = 10), sibs: 1.71
± 0.23 spiders (n = 12), χ2 = 0.27, Z = -0.49, DF = 1, p =
0.6). Mass increase of the spiders over the experimental
period did not differ between treatments (Table 4A).
Within-group mortality was not influenced by treatment
(One-factorial-test: non-sibs: 16.67 ± 11.39%, n = 10,
sibs: 2.78 ± 2.78%, n = 12, χ2 = 0.78, DF = 1, p = 0.37).

Large groups
Large groups extracted more from a prey item when they
were sibs rather than non-sibs. A GLMM showed that,
apart from trial number and the size of the feeding group,
relatedness had a significant effect on feeding efficiency
(Table 4). The significant interaction between trial
number and treatment resulted from a stronger increase in
the mass extracted over sequential trials in the sib groups
than in the non-sib groups (Figure 1).

Sib groups fed in consistently larger numbers than nonsib groups (Figure 2) and a GLMM on the size of the feeding group revealed a significant treatment effect (F1,97 =
5.65, p = 0.02) in addition to a significant positive effect
of trial number (random effect t = 4.51, p = 0.0001). The
model explained 22% of the variation in the size of the
feeding group.
Relative mass increase of spiders did not differ significantly between treatments (Table 3B) although the final
mass of sib groups was significantly higher than in nonsib groups. However, sib groups started with a slightly
although not significantly higher mass (Table 3B).
Spiders in the sib treatment grew more homogeneously
than spiders in groups with non-sibs (CV Table 3B): Coefficients of variation in body weights of spiders within
groups (CVbm) already differed at the start of the experiment (Table 3B) so that we included CVbm at the start as a
covariate into the model. An ANCOVA on CVbm of groups
of both sizes at the end of the experiment revealed that
independent of the CVbm at the beginning of the experimental period, the CVbm in groups of non-sibs at the end
of the experiment was significantly higher than in sib
groups and significantly higher in large groups than in
small groups (Table 5).
Treatment had no influence on within-group mortality
(One-factorial test: non-sibs: 11.67 ± 4.34%, n = 10, sibs:
15.00 ± 9.76%, n = 10, χ2 = 0.21, DF = 1, p = 0.63).

Discussion
We experimentally investigated feeding efficiency, growth
and mortality in groups of different sizes in the subsocial
spider S. tentoriicola and found that relatedness reduced
the negative effects of feeding competition in large groups.
Feeding competition is a consequence of communal hunting and feeding, and is typical of social spiders [26], as of
group living animals in general [27]. While competition is
an inevitable cost of group living, cooperation among kin
may negate this cost [7]. Here, this effect was apparent
when groups were large, indicating a dynamic cost-benefit
relationship between competition and cooperation
shaped by the degree of competition (group size) and
genetic composition of the group [27].

In S. tentoriicola, increased group size had a strong negative effect on feeding efficiency of individuals. Even
though large groups extracted more prey mass than small
groups or single spiders, individuals within large groups
did not grow better. On the contrary, the per capita
extracted prey mass decreased with increasing group size:
single spiders fed significantly more efficiently than
groups of three and six spiders. Thus, group feeding
imposes a cost. Our results are consistent with the finding
that feeding in a group reduces prey mass taken out per
unit time in social Stegodyphus mimosarum [22]. These
results indicate that communal feeding in spiders generally involves a social dilemma.
Spiders have to compete over digestive investment

tive enzymes into the prey and suck the liquidized content
out of the exoskeleton [28]. Digestive enzymes are costly
to produce [29] and hence, some spiders may benefit by
consuming food digested by enzymes of a conspecific
without providing investment themselves. Individuals
should then hold back their enzymes and invest smaller
portions that will not digest more than the donor itself
can ingest. This process will reduce the speed of prey
digestion in relation to the number of feeders. The more
individuals occupy feeding positions on the prey carcass
the more likely can neighbouring spiders benefit from the
investment of others. With increasing group size cheating
by holding back investment into digestive liquids should
increase in frequency. This may explain the effect of group
size found in our study and in a previous study on social
S. mimosarum [30]. This resembles a classical dilemma
termed tragedy of the commons because selfishness negatively affects the performance of the group but cannot be
easily given up by individuals [2]. Feeding among kin may
provide a solution to the tragedy of the commons through
benefits of kin cooperation as seen here. The benefit of
relatedness in this study was only large enough to be
detected when three or more spiders regularly fed

In contrast to the observations on S. lineatus, sibling
groups showed a larger feeding group size than non-sibling groups. In communally feeding spiders, dominant
(large) individuals may be able to monopolize prey, while
subordinate (small) individuals consistently succumb
[26] which may lead to an unbalanced growth of the
group and mortality due to starvation among the smaller
individuals [8]. In our study, large groups of sibs shared
prey with more conspecifics than non-sibs and sibs grew
in a more homogeneous manner, resulting in a lower
coefficient of variation at the end of the experiment. In
non-sib groups, few individuals gained much weight
while others hardly grew.

together. Hence, the effect of relatedness may be increasingly relevant in balancing competitive costs above a certain level of competition [31]. The relevance of such a
compensation of costs of feeding competition is apparent
from an experiment with social spider colonies that produced relatively more reproductive females if lipid rich
prey was supplemented [32].
The result that relatedness reduces the negative effects of
competition is consistent with previous findings in a
related species [7]. Groups consisting of siblings had a
higher feeding efficiency, suggesting a reduced inclination
to cheat or an increased motivation to invest in the digestive process at the risk of the participation of other feeders.
We did not employ a cross-fostering design in this study
and hence have no experimental confirmation that
genetic similarity and not familiarity is responsible for the
observed effects. However, it is a parsimonious assumption that related species do not differ in such major traits.

ANCOVA: One outlier had to be removed to achieve a normal
distribution of the residuals (whole model, r2 = 0.33, F3,34 = 5.47, p =
0.004). Inclusion of the outlier removes the significance of the factor
"initial number of spiders" but does not change qualitative results of
the other factors.

Despite the larger feeding group sizes, sib groups still performed better in feeding efficiency compared with nonsib groups in terms of more successful extraction of prey
mass. However, the more successful extraction of prey
mass did not result in higher growth rates, as found in S.
lineatus [7]. Perhaps such a difference would have become
apparent had our study run over a longer time period.
This may also explain why - unlike in S. lineatus [7] where
a marginally significant reduced mortality in sib groups
was found - mortality did not differ between treatments in
this study and was generally very low, although single
individuals survived better than individuals in groups. We
did not observe cannibalism which was found in S. lineatus under starvation [31].
Stegodyphus spiders represent one of the few study systems
of the evolution of cooperation with convincing empirical
evidence for genuine kin discrimination as opposed to
nest-mate recognition [7,33]. Here we further corroborate
the potential for kin discrimination in spiders, as our
observations suggests that kin recognition is involved in
producing the differences in cooperative feeding [7,8]. Kin
recognition could affect higher motivation to invest and
share costly enzymes in S. tentoriicola, whereas non-sibs
may save digestive enzymes rather than sharing them.
Alternatively, differences in feeding efficiency might be
attributable to a higher compatibility of digestive enzymes
among siblings compared to non-siblings. However, this
hypothesis does not account for the increased inclination
to forage communally of siblings obvious from the consistently larger feeding groups among siblings. After
matriphagy, S. tentoriicola-spiderlings live, hunt and feed
communally over an extended period which is reported to
be longer than in S. lineatus. The latter species does not
show the same behaviour and sib and non-sib groups did
not show different feeding group sizes [7].

Conclusion
Stronger cooperation within broods might promote prolonged associations of juveniles in S. tentoriicola and may
underlie the loss of pre-mating dispersal apparent in the

Page 5 of 7

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:257

permanent social spiders [34], especially when the costs
of dispersal are high [35]. Once pre-mating dispersal is
lost it leads to an inbreeding mating system [10]. Through
increasing within-group relatedness inbreeding might in
turn favour the evolution of further kin-selected cooperative traits [36], thus generating a positive feedback that
might culminate in the evolution of permanent group living or eusociality [7,37].

Methods
Study animals
Stegodyphus tentoriicola (Purcell, 1904) is an eresid spider
distributed in South Africa [21]. It is a semelparous species, i.e. females invest all resources in a single clutch, a
trait likely common to all species of the genus [38].
Female spiders care for their brood and feed the spiderlings via regurgitation before they are finally consumed by
their offspring (matriphagy) [39]. The spiderlings cooperate in foraging and web building even after their mother
has died [8].

The spiders used in the experiment are offspring of
females that were collected in April 2008 from their natural habitat near Cradock (South Africa, 32°10' S 25° 37'
E). They hatched between April and May 2008. The
hatched juveniles and their mothers were left inside their
natal nests and were kept in plastic containers in the laboratory. Temperature ranged between 20° - 28°C and a
ventilator provided airflow.
After matriphagy, in June 2008, spiderlings of eight
clutches were randomly assigned to four treatments in a 2
× 2 factorial design, with the following group compositions: (i) 3 sibs (n = 12); (ii) 6 sibs (n = 10); (iii) 3 nonsibs (n = 10); or (iv) 6 non-sibs (N = 11). All individuals
in non-sib groups were derived from different mothers.
Spiderlings were weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg by using
an electronic balance and placed into Petri dishes (5.5
cm) either in groups of three (n = 22) or six (n = 21) animals. In addition, we separated 13 spiderlings which were
placed individually into Petri dishes.
As soon as the spiderlings had produced silk in their Petri
dishes, the feeding experiment began. A CO2-anesthetized
Calliphora fly was weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg and put
into the Petri dish. After the first spiderling attacked the
fly, we determined the number of feeding spiderlings
every 15 minutes for two hours (9 checks). When the prey
was not attacked within 30 minutes, the trial was interrupted and the group was not used until the next feeding
interval. Therefore, sample sizes can differ depending on
the factors analysed. After two hours, the fly was removed
and weighed again. It is important to note that the fly was
only to a small part digested after this period. Hence single spiders did not benefit from having a whole fly while

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/257

the others got only a part. For each group, we calculated
the mean extracted prey mass in relation to the mean
number of feeding spiderlings (mean over the 9 checks).
In all treatments the time between feeding trials was the
same (one week, except for the interrupted trials). Additionally, the spiderlings were fed once a week with one
Drosophila per capita, i.e. all spiders had the same amount
of food available. All spiderlings were weighed again at
the end of the experiment. Data analyses were performed
with JMP 7. For the analyses of feeding efficiency related
to size of the feeding group, we excluded all incidences
where only a single spider had fed. We used non-parametric rank based tests (Wilcoxon test) or one-factorial test
based on a χ2 distribution when the assumptions for parametric tests were not met. We computed general mixed
models (GLMM) using restricted maximal likelihood
(REML) with trial number as random factor. JMP 7 does
not compute F-values but t-values for random factors.

Authors' contributions
JMS and TB conceived and designed the experiments. JR
and LH conducted the experiments. JR and JMS analysed
the data and wrote the ms.
