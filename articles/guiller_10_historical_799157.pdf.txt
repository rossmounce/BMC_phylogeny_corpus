Historical biogeography of the land snail Cornu
aspersum: a new scenario inferred from haplotype
distribution in the Western Mediterranean basin
Annie Guiller1*, Luc Madec2

Abstract
Background: Despite its key location between the rest of the continent and Europe, research on the
phylogeography of north African species remains very limited compared to European and North American taxa.
The Mediterranean land mollusc Cornu aspersum (= Helix aspersa) is part of the few species widely sampled in
north Africa for biogeographical analysis. It then provides an excellent biological model to understand
phylogeographical patterns across the Mediterranean basin, and to evaluate hypotheses of population
differentiation. We investigated here the phylogeography of this land snail to reassess the evolutionary scenario we
previously considered for explaining its scattered distribution in the western Mediterranean, and to help to resolve
the question of the direction of its range expansion (from north Africa to Europe or vice versa). By analysing
simultaneously individuals from 73 sites sampled in its putative native range, the present work provides the first
broad-scale screening of mitochondrial variation (cyt b and 16S rRNA genes) of C. aspersum.
Results: Phylogeographical structure mirrored previous patterns inferred from anatomy and nuclear data, since all
haplotypes could be ascribed to a B (West) or a C (East) lineage. Alternative migration models tested confirmed
that C. aspersum most likely spread from north Africa to Europe. In addition to Kabylia in Algeria, which would
have been successively a centre of dispersal and a zone of secondary contacts, we identified an area in Galicia
where genetically distinct west and east type populations would have regained contact.
Conclusions: Vicariant and dispersal processes are reviewed and discussed in the light of signatures left in the
geographical distribution of the genetic variation. In referring to Mediterranean taxa which show similar
phylogeographical patterns, we proposed a parsimonious scenario to account for the “east-west” genetic splitting
and the northward expansion of the western (B) clade which roughly involves (i) the dispersal of ancestral (eastern)
types through Oligocene terranes in the Western Mediterranean (ii) the Tell Atlas orogenesis as gene flow barrier
between future west and east populations, (iii) the impact of recurrent climatic fluctuations from mid-Pliocene to
the last ice age, (iv) the loss of the eastern lineage during Pleistocene northwards expansion phases.

Background
The aim of phylogeography is to explain the spatial distribution of genetic lineages within species and highlight
the most influential historical factors explaining their
distribution [1]. Hypotheses commonly advanced in phylogeography are inherent to dispersal and vicariant
events, inferences about which being usually based on
estimates of genetic diversity, divergence time and
demographic history [2]. Inferences on demographic

processes have especially become a central challenge in
phylogeography and the recent development of analytical tools based on coalescent theory is very helpful for
investigating the demographic history of populations.
From information provided by phylogenetic trees and
the signature in the pattern of DNA substitutions left in
the case of historical change in population size, it is possible to identify the demographic process which has
occurred and estimate related parameters [3,4] The
wealth of literature dealing with phylogeography and
demography in many invertebrate and vertebrate species
emphasizes the importance of combining both lineage

and population components to reveal biogeographical
histories. Moreover, the comparison of phylogeographic
structures across co-distributed taxa allows to find concordant partitions and to infer common historical factors of divergence and colonization. Then, in North
America (for review see [5]) as in Europe [6], various
species have been studied to determine the climatic and
geological effects on phylogeographic patterns and
population structures. More precisely in Europe, the
Mediterranean basin characterized by an exceptional
level of biodiversity and a complex geological history
[7], has been the subject of intensive studies carrying
out on genetic diversity and phylogeography. Nevertheless, most of these studies provide insights into the evolutionary history of southern European species. Despite
its key location between the rest of the continent and
Europe, only a few cases concern the north African territory. In addition, investigations including Algerian data
sets are relatively rare, and main historical process influencing the differentiation is generally found in Quaternary climatic oscillations, meaning that few studies imply
events which occurred over times much longer than the
last glacial period.
Amongst the few species widely sampled in north
Africa (i.e. throughout the northern territory from western Morocco to eastern Tunisia) for studying historical
processes influencing their current distribution, the land
mollusc Cornu aspersum (= syn. Helix aspersa) provides
an excellent biological model to understand phylogeographic patterns across north Africa and surrounding
regions of the Western Mediterreanean basin, and evaluate hypotheses leading to population differentiation.
This land snail, formerly known as Helix aspersa Müller,
1774, is originated from Mediterranean countries. It
comprises a set of north African endemic forms and
subspecies that were described at the beginning of the
20th century on the basis of shell characteristics [8]. The
most common one, C. a. aspersum (syn. H. a. aspersa),
has become very abundant in all man-disturbed habitats
in regions with a Mediterranean, temperate and even
subtropical climate. To reconstruct the biogeographical
history of this invasive form in the western Mediterranean, variation in spatial patterns of shell, genital and
molecular characters was previously estimated by investigating more than hundred of populations representative of the aspersum range (western Mediterranean and
European coastlines) (Fig 1). Almost all samples were
examined for allozyme and morphometric variation
[9-14] whereas only north African populations were analysed using part of the mitochondrial large subunit (16S
rRNA) gene [15]. Whatever the set of populations and/
or markers used, the combination of all different types
of data leads to a clear pattern in geographical structure.
Indeed, (i) two anatomically and biochemically divergent

Page 2 of 20

groups of populations (West vs East) between which the
separation occurs in Kabylia (Algeria) is invariably
observed throughout the north African coastal region;
(ii) almost all European populations clustered with western north African ones, with smaller genetic distances
than those between western and eastern north Africa
(Fig 2), [9,10].
Two competing biogeographical scenarios based on
opposite directions of dispersal were considered to
explain the spatial pattern of variation in C. aspersum
and especially to determine processes responsible for
genetic isolation in the eastern part of north Africa (Fig
2) [10]. Both were based on Pliocene geological events
and Quaternary cold periods, but colonization routes
taken by the species involved migrations either from
north Africa to Europe or from western Europe to north
Africa, with likely secondary contacts in the Kabylian
area. The doubtful direction of species expansion results
from discrepancies of spatial structure between allozyme
and partial mitochondrial data, and from an inconstant
pattern of gene diversity. The previous scenario we proposed [9,14], implying a northwards progression of the
species (model 1, Fig 2), fits well with published reports
that place the origin of C. aspersum in north Africa [8].
However, mitochondrial gene diversity estimated in
north Africa does not corroborate the northward colonization hypothesis [15]. The value of nucleotide diversity,
twice as weak in the east (clade C) as in the west (clade
B) north African mtDNA lineages, together with unresolved relationships between eastern populations, is
rather consistent with southward dispersal either via
Tyrrhenian/Aegean routes or the Strait of Gibraltar
(model 2, Fig 2) [15]. Whilst in the first scenario we
ascribed the lower diversity in east to the occurrence of
transitory and prolonged bottlenecks inherent in successive migrations that populations experienced from Kabylia to Tunisia, this may also simply indicate a more
recent divergence within the eastern region.
These two hypotheses were evaluated here by studying
the phylogeography and the demographic history of C.
aspersum over all European and African populations
sampled. Since parameters relevant to fluctuating population size on the evolutionary time scale were never
taken into account in previous phylogeographical studies
of the species, we hoped that their estimation would
help to shed more light upon the scenario we previously
considered to account for the scattered distribution of
C. aspersum [9,10]. The aim of this work is to assess the
geographic patterns of mtDNA diversity in order (i) to
improve our understanding of the species range expansion and infer the dispersal direction, (ii) to elucidate
the role of the Kabylian area suspected until now to be
a suture zone in Algeria. Without ruling out the fact
that demographic processes and selective sweeps can

lead to convergent genetic signatures when only one
genetic marker is analysed, we hope that demographic
estimates will allow to reinforce one of the hypotheses
relating to the sense of dispersion in western Mediterranean, as well as that concerning the likely contact zone
in Kabylia. Recent demographic expansion in the western lineage, combined with low nucleotide diversity,
should favour a south-north dispersal, whilst a recent
colonization from northern locations to the south
should indicate demographic stability and high molecular diversity indices within the western lineage (Fig 2).

the overall haplotype diversity was high (0.98 ± 0.01)
(Table 1). Sequences from the 16S rRNA were obtained
for 128 C. aspersum individuals. They had a length of
377 bp. The total number of mutations was 123. The
nucleotide diversity was high (0.057 ± 0.028) covering
89 polymorphic sites of which 61 were parsimony informative. A total of 75 haplotypes (excluding sites with
gaps and missing data) were identified, producing a high
overall haplotypic diversity (0.98 ± 0.01) since 56 of
them were unique (Table 1).

rRNA (g1 = -0.109, p < 0.01) was also indicative of a
highly significant structure. The hypothesis of homogeneous rate within alignment of 16S and cyt b genes

respectively was not rejected by the molecular clock
tests. The likelihoods with no molecular clock enforced
were not significantly better than those with enforced
molecular clock (cyt b: 2ΔlogL = 15.8, d.f. = 60, p = 1;
16S, 2ΔlogL = 64.3, d.f. = 72, p = 0.73). For both genes,
the RRT detected no significant heterogeneity between
the defined lineages. Calculation of divergence time
from phylogenies was then justified.
The topology of the cyt b trees obtained by ML and
BI approaches revealed two strongly supported monophyletic groups B and C (Fig 3). In one group (C clade),
sequences of all eastern populations of north Africa
(from east Kakylia to Tunisia) clustered with Corsican
and Croatian samples defining the C2 lineage. Neither
haplotypes from the Croatian localities nor those from
the Tunisian ones turned out to form monophyletic
sub-groups in accordance with expectations of geographical positions. Sequences of both western Algerian
samples A1 and A2 were also included in the C group
but form a paraphyletic lineage (C1) in which four
sequences from Galicia in Spain were also included. The
topology of the sister group (B clade) was shallow and
there were few significant genealogical branches of samples corresponding to sampling locality. Except individuals originating mostly from the Kabylian zone in
Algeria (A 10-13 and A25; lineage Z1 and Z2) and most
French ones that were monophyletic (lineage B2), individuals from western north Africa (from west Kabylia to
Morocco), Spain, Crete and Sardinia were scattered
throughout the B group.
The 16S RNA tree’s topologies yielded identical
grouping of individuals as Cyt b, with the emergence of
both B and C clades (Fig 4). ML and BI topologies were
different mainly in the position of two lineages which
clustered nine individuals from populations in Kabylia,
Morocco, Crete and Turkey. These two clades, which
were the most basal on the ML tree (tree not shown),
formed two sister clades within the B lineage on the BI
tree. Sequences from sampling locations not analysed
for cyt b were scattered throughout the trees. Italian
and Portuguese individuals were included in the C
group whereas sequences from Greece, England and
newly analysed French populations clustered within the
B lineage.
For both genes, the haplotype network corroborated
the existence of two main phylogroups, B and C (Fig 5,
network not shown for 16S). Geographical discontinuities within both haplogroups were also confirmed with
the Croatian and Corsican haplotypes linked to the
Numidian (east Algeria) ones in C, and the Sardinian
and Crete haplotypes widespread through the B lineage.
Interestingly on the cyt b network is the position of
both B and C haplogroups each side of C. a. maxima
haplotype. For the C haplogroup, Tunisian, eastern

Page 5 of 20

Algerian and all C2 haplotypes would emerge from individuals originating from western Algeria (A 1 and A 2
populations). Moreover, Spanish haplotypes from E9 and
E 13 should also originate from this western Algerian
area. For the B haplogroup, both distinct B1 and B2
lineages seem to have originated and diverged independently from the Kabylian area in Algeria. In these two B
sub-clades, the network was also indicative of a more
recent population expansion in which several localizated
lineages were connected by short branches to the most
common haplotype that occurred in French or Spanish
populations. A high level of mitochondrial diversity both
within and among lineages clearly appears from the
examination of both the 16S and cyt b networks. The
nucleotide diversity θπ was higher in B than in C lineage
(Table 1). However, this variability became much lower
in B than in C when the Z sequences are removed from
the B clade (θπcytb = 6.8 ± 3.6; θπ16S = 11.5 ± 5.8; θπ(cytb
+16S) = 12.9 ± 6.7). As suggested by the short branches
in B subclades, the magnitude of change was lower in
B1 and B2 for cyt b than in Ba and Bb for 16S.
Pattern of migration

For both genes analysed separately, results of AIC values
comparing four migration models support an asymmetric model of migration from north African to European populations of the B lineage (Fig 2). The model 1
(MAE) had an AIC value of 6.0 and 5.9 for cyt b and
16S respectively, whilst values of the MEA (model 2)
were 730.3 for cyt b and 14 92.1 for 16S.
Demographic analyses

We used haplogroups based on both genes to estimate
demographic parameters to test for demographic events.
Regarding the cyt b gene, a model of constant size could
not be rejected for most haplogroups, except for clades
B1 and B2 (both Fu’s test and R 2 ; Table 1). Fu’s test
only was significant for clade C2. These results were
confirmed by the observed mismatch distributions
which closely matched those expected under a model of
sudden expansion for these three haplogroups (Fig 6a, b,
c). Fu’s and/or R2 tests performed with 16S sequences of
the B clade (in the whole population and in Ba and Bb
haplogroups) also rejected the null hypothesis of constant size (Table 1). As suggested by the bimodal pattern
of mismatch distribution in B (results not showed), the
presence of two subgroups Ba and Bb may explain the
non-significant R2 in group B. By contrast, the unimodal
distribution of pairwise differences among haplotypes in
Ba and Bb haplogroups perfectly fitted the distribution
predicted by the sudden expansion model (Fig 6d, e).
Populations of the C clade may also have experienced
demographic expansion (Fig 6f) (Table 1).
Historical demographic reconstructions (BSPs) of the
B and C clades are shown in fig. 6. According to cyt b
plots, after a phase of constant population size, the B

haplogroup appeared to have experienced demographic
expansions, one around 5.3 × 10 -3 (between 0.53 and
0.13 Myr with 0.5% and 2% respectively) and one more
discrete around 0.37 × 10-3 (between 37 000 and 9 300
years with 0.5% and 2% respectively) time units (Fig 7a).
A somewhat similar trend was observed for the 16S
gene, for which a faster population growth would have
occurred at around 6.4 × 10-3 time units (between 0.64
and 0.16 Myr with 0.5% and 2% respectively) (Fig 7c).
For the C lineage, both cyt b and 16S plots revealed a
prolonged phase of demographic stability followed by a
recent expansion, starting at around 1.5 × 10-3 for cyt b
(between 0.15 Myr and 38 000 years with 0.5% and 2%
respectively) and 2 × 10-3 time units (between 0.2 Myr
and 50 000 years with 0.5% and 2% respectively) for 16S
(Fig 7b, d). Estimates of TMRCA (and 95% HPD) based
on the coalescent theory showed congruent values for
16S and cyt b genes (Table 2). According to fossil
records and previous estimates based upon allozyme

data, likely time values would correspond to divergence
rates ranging from 0.5 to 2% per Myr. Assuming this
rate divergence range, the most recent common ancestor of all C. aspersum would have lived between 6.1
(4.8-7.6) and 1.1 (0.7-1.5) Myr ago. After excluding the
basal Z sequences on the BI tree for 16S, the split into
the B and the C clades would have occurred between
4.2 (3.5-5.1) and 1.1 (0.9-1.3) Myr ago. The split
between B subclades would have taken place around 3.2
(2.3-4.3) and 0.8 (0.5-1.1) Myr ago, while the most
recent common ancestor of all C individuals would have
lived between 2.6 (1.9-3.3) and 0.6 (0.4-0.9) Myr ago.

Discussion
Our results based on 16S and cyt b mtDNA variation
showed phylogenetic relationships among C. aspersum
haplotypes consistent with inferences based on anatomy,
nuclear (allozyme) and mitochondrial data previously
analysed [9,11,12,15]. The split into two haplogroups is

supported since haplotypes of populations newly investigated compared to the previous mtDNA study [15] scattered either in the B or in the C lineage without really
forming a new one. In a wider sense of the nomenclature inferred from these previous works, these B and C
lineages were named “west” and “east” respectively,
although the origin of some samples is not always in
accordance with this spatial identification. Indeed, both
lineages can include haplotypes originating from geographically distant populations. These discrepancies
between genetic and geography are suggestive of a relatively intricate phylogeographical history of C. aspersum.
As we previously showed, the genetic structuring of
populations does not seem to be simply a function of
dispersal [10]. Beyond vicariance involving Tertiary tectonic events and Pleistocene glaciations, migration due
to human actions needs to be mentioned to account for
the current distribution of the species outside north
Africa. However, the relative role of each process seems
to vary greatly from one region to another. Before assessing the contribution of each of the different processes
and refining the evolutionary scenario for the emergence
of the two distinct lineages, we will recapitulate the
main results by focusing particularly on contrasting
zones of the distribution area that appear to be major
historical entities.
The key areas detected

The tricky question of the dispersal scenario of the species can be solved by the genetic information provided
by the northern part of the species range and preliminary outcomes of northward versus southward migration
models tested. Within this wide area represented by

western sublineages (i.e. B2 for cyt b, and Bb for 16S),
four points can argue in favour of a northward movement: the better support of an asymmetric dispersal
model towards a north Africa to Europe migration
(model 1, Fig 2), the very low nucleotide diversity
obtained, the star-like structure of the haplotypes network, the presence of Algerian individuals scattered in
all subclades knowing that such splitting concerns
exclusively Algerian samples. Although not specific to
these sublineages, recent demographic expansions registered in B2 and Bb strengthen this dispersal direction
that could have possibly started from Algiers area
(represented by A4, A5, A6 populations). Expansion time
estimates are purely speculative since no calibration
point is available. However, values inferred from divergence rates fitting with previous allozyme estimates (see
below), i.e. from 1 to 5% per Myr, would suggest that
expansions highlighted by historical demographic reconstructions would have occurred twice. The first would
have happened during one of the Pleistocene interglacial
periods (i.e. from around 700 000 years ago), and the
second at mid-Holocene after the maximum extent of
the ice sheets during the last glaciation (between 37 000
and 7 400 years ago).
One area in Algeria seems to have played a central
role in the dispersal of the species. Both genes showed
that the Kabylies (represented by samples A10-A14 and
A25) would have constituted a significant centre for dispersal and differentiation (model 1, Fig 2). However,
phylogenies display an unstable position of Kabylian
sequences. They occupy a basal position within the western lineage except on the ML 16S tree where they form

Guiller and Madec BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:18
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/18

a sister group of the remaining individuals of C. aspersum. The population of Djemila (A14) is an exception
since the cyt b haplotype of this sample lies within an
eastern subclade that also includes haplotypes of neighbouring populations (A 15 , A 16 , A 17 ). Therefore, the
Kabylies could possibly be the ancestral range of either
C. aspersum or of the western lineage only. A difficulty
in distinguishing between these two hypotheses stems
from genetic exchanges that could have then occurred
between western and eastern populations, leading to disruption in genetic structuring (model 2, Fig 2). The pattern of allele distribution at 13 polymorphic allozyme
loci in intermediate Algerian populations ranging from
Azzefoun (A12, Great Kaylia) to El Hedaick (A16, Skikda)
reflects the possibility that peripheral populations of
both East and West North-Africa would have regained
contact after having been isolated. As previously suspected with the occurrence of eastern typical allozymes
found in Djemila [16], introgressive hybridization
between snails of the mixed population could also
explain the presence of one C (east) typical cyt b haplotype in Djemila. The derived position of this haplotype
diverging from A 16 would moreover support the
assumption of horizontal transfer of the mitochondrial
genome through hybridization. One might suppose that
both C (east) and B (west) haplotypes coexist in that
population but quite obviously, more individuals from
Djemila and surrounding sites need to be analysed to
refine the gene diversity and reinforce the gene
exchanges assumption between lineages in contact. Evidence in favour of this contact model is the west-east
clinal decrease in a pair of genital organ lengths, i.e. the
bursa tract diverticulum and the flagellum [14]. Suspected hybridizing populations and especially those
from Djemila (A14), El Ancer (A15) and El Hedaick (A16)
have medium-sized organs compared with eastern and
western ones. Therefore, whether the Kabylies is a dispersal centre or not, it is likely a zone where genetically
distinct individuals from east versus west met and
mated, resulting in at least some offspring of mixed
ancestry. It is worth noting that other individuals
sampled outside the Kabylies join this putative dispersal
centre, especially snails from Morocco, Crete and
Turkey.
The C clade equivalent to the eastern lineage we previously defined from anatomy, shell and molecular features covers here a larger geographical range. In
addition to original samples from eastern north Africa,
western Algeria (A1 and A2) and Italy [9-11,15], samples
more distant geographically join this clade. These are
isolated specimens from Corsica, Croatia (Istria) and the
western coast of Iberia (Cape Finisterre and Muxia in
Galicia, coastal sites in Portugal). Although there is no
clear evidence to explain this grouping, we can

Page 11 of 20

nevertheless point out that all populations of this lineage
are outside the zone defined by the -1°C January isotherm during the last glacial maximum (LGM), i.e.
about 18 000 BP [17,18]. Contrary to populations of the
B lineage that might have expanded northwards after
glacial episodes from either southern differentiation centres or after introductions, populations of the C clade
would have been limited in their post-last glacial maximum dispersal.
The biogeographical scenario reconsidered: new insights
into haplotype distribution in north Africa and Europe

Cornu aspersum is a typically anthropochorous species
which is nowadays widespread throughout the world in
many zones with climates differing from the original
Mediterranean one. Its presence is reported on the
American continents, as well as in Australia and in Asia.
Therefore, the first explanation for resemblances
between populations located on either side of the Mediterranean could be passive transport due to human
activities. Transfers might have started as nearly as the
Neolithic revolution (around 8 500 BP; [9,12]) and
nowadays they continue occurring in giving rise in some
cases to catastrophic destruction of habitats. Such manmade dispersal is however insufficient to explain the
genetic pattern of variation obtained. Signatures left in
the geographical distribution and the genetic diversity of
extant populations indicated differences in spatial patterning between north Africa and Europe that could not
be interpreted as a result of human-assisted dispersal
alone. While a real pattern of regional differentiation
exists for African samples [12], a lack of genetic structure due to a great admixture of populations is detected
in northern parts of the species range [10]. Hence, European individuals of the same population might originate from distinct native populations more or less
differentiated genetically. Different waves of dispersion
could explain marked genetic divergence estimates
among the homogeneous groups of populations we
defined using spatial contiguity constraint (see [10] for
details). For the B lineage, northern and eastern Spanish
areas like French ones should have been twice colonized
by recurrent individuals coming from native populations
of the same region. By contrast, snails from south and
west Iberia that exhibit genetic similarities with north
African individuals would have originated from more
highly differentiated sources, probably Europe and north
Africa. The Galician populations of Cape Finisterre (E9)
and Muxia (E13) mirror such findings with an extremely
frequently recorded level of mitochondrial diversity. The
co-occurrence within a given population of both B and
C specific haplotypes contributes to extreme divergences
(for cytb: θ π (E9) = 13.8 and θ π (E13) = 6.9; for 16S: θ π
(E13) = 11.8 and θπ (E9) = 0.5 with only eastern types present in E9) that consequently leads to discord between

Guiller and Madec BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:18
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/18

gene and population trees. This intermixing of distinct
haplotypes is questionable since it occurs only in one
part of the species range which moreover is peripheral
and not expected to be the differentiation centre of C.
aspersum. The overall differentiation between these
sympatric divergent haplotypes involves two likely
sources of variation: (i) divergence which already existed
within the common ancestral populations; (ii) divergent
haplotypes originating from previously isolated lineages
[19]. These components of variation imply underlying
debatable mechanisms such as incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms due to recently divergent populations or recent migration events between
allopatric populations [20,21]. Incomplete lineage sorting
from an ancestral polymorphic gene pool could possibly
be the cause of the mitochondrial polyphyly detected in
E9 and E13. The high gene diversity observed overall C.
aspersum sequences compared to the number of individuals analysed prevents reliable differentiation between
shared (ancestral) and specific (derived) haplotypes.
However, a distinction could be proposed using their
position on networks. Then, eastern haplotypes for both
genes would be specific to E9 and E13 whereas western
mitotypes would be either specific to each population or
shared by other samples more or less distant geographically (Iberian and French samples). For East types only,
the absence of ancestral mitotype could correspond to
the “allotypy” pattern of the intermediate polyphyly progression described by Omland et al. [22] and documented by other studies [23-25]. Intermixing of Iberian and
East North-African haplotypes should then indicate that
they would not be completely sorted. In that case,
nuclear genes having about four times the effective
population size of mitochondria, would however fail to
locate populations which are reciprocally monophyletic
[26]. Although E9 and E13 are clearly distinct genetically
from most other Iberian samples belonging to the same
B clade, nuclear variation is effectively consistent with
monophyly of both populations with no intermixing of
typical alleles of B (west) versus C (east) lineages. Allozyme data indicated few common alleles shared only
with western north African populations, especially M1,
M2, A1 and A2 [9], and assignment tests performed on
microsatellite genotypes clustered almost all individuals
of both samples (92 of 95 individuals analysed) within a
single cluster rather than distinct ones [27]. Other arguments such (i) the occurrence of close western types of
both Iberian populations in very remote geographical
regions, (ii) the great genetic divergence estimated
between the aforementioned intermixed B and C haplotypes, (iii) the geographical location of populations having non-monophyletic haplotypes, tend to argue against
this hypothesis of incomplete sorting in promoting secondary contacts between previously isolated lineages.

Page 12 of 20

The pattern of morphometric distinctiveness between
western and eastern typical populations also supports
such hypothesis of migration between divergent populations. Only explanations based on secondary contacts
between snails of the B and C lineages could clarify the
morphometric heterogeneity in space and time registered in Galician populations, in which adult snails exhibit B or C shell and genital features according to
sampling dates (1991 and 2004 for E9, 2004 for E13) and
location. Comparison with the morphometric profile of
snails originating from populations of the suspected
contact zone in Kabylia may provide insights into the
process responsible for the variation observed in Galicia.
As mentioned above, snails from Djemila (A14), which
can be considered as the most representative of the
intermediate zone [16], have genitalia of an intermediate
size, which is about average for the species [13,28]. Such
an intermediate pattern of covariation between shell and
genital organs should imply mechanism leading to an
eventual precopulatory isolation between snails from the
eastern and western lineages. More than a simple coexistence of two distinct morphotypes within a population,
the intermediate size of diverticulum of snails from
Cape Finisterre could reflect the evolution of premating
reproductive isolation among lineages recently in contact...The contradictory genetic signature of mitochondrial versus nuclear loci may support this scenario in
which horizontal transfer of distinct haplotypes would
occur through introgressive hybridization between both
lineages where reproductive barriers are incomplete.
The mitotypes characterizing southern and western
populations of the peninsula strengthen the putative
contact zone inferred in that area since Portuguese samples (P2, P3, P7) showed C types only, whereas northern
Iberian populations (E10, E14-17) have B types. An extensive sampling of this western part of Iberia is however
imperative to corroborate this conclusion.
Inferring secondary contacts between genetically distinct west (B) and east (C) populations in Kabylia as in
Galicia assumes that originally the species has undergone a strong genetic splitting. Time estimates based on
present mitochondrial results (between 4 and 1 Myr) do
not refute previous allozyme assessments (Nei’s genetic
distance between west and east subdivisions is between
0.25 and 0.18, leading to time estimates ranging from
3.1 to 1.8 Myr; [9,29]), and are both consistent with
mid-Pliocene/Pleistocene break-up events. Except for
global climate changes of the past 4 Myr including the
end of the early warm period (5-3 Myr) and significant
intensification of northern hemisphere glaciation around
2.75 Myr ago [30-32], there is no clear evidence of a
past biogeographic event at the time of the shift which
occurred in C. aspersum. However, in the expectation of
an investigation that would compare the

Guiller and Madec BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:18
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/18

phylogeographic structures of Mediterranean taxa showing similar geographic and genetic splits (work in progress), we already offer a non-exhaustive synopsis of
biogeographical studies of north African populations to
infer historical factors that could explain the deep
genetic break observed in Algeria ([18,33-62]; Table 3).
The oldest event involved in the differentiation process
relates to the tectonic evolution of the western Mediterranean region [31,32]. Several plant and animal taxa
showing genetic shift geographically consistent with the
fragmentation of those microplates would have then
undergone differentiation through such a vicariant event
[33-36,38]. Whether or not due to the plate tectonics of
the region, the Tell Atlas and Atlas mountains uplifted
between 13 and 11 Myr ago [63] from which two areas
of endemism have been delimited in north Africa [64],
the end of the Messinian salinity crisis leading to the
opening of the Strait of Gibraltar 5.3 Myr ago, and the
emergence of continental islands formed by successive
marine floodings could have formed major significant
biogeographical barriers in the westernmost area of the
basin (Talbe 3). As for other taxa such as the newt P.
nebulosus [43], the salamander Salamandra algira [49]
and the land snail Turodella sulcata ss versus Turodella
sp [50,51], the formation of the Moulouya River basin in
Morocco and the fossil island called the “Edough Peninsula” in eastern Algeria (around 4.2 Myr ago), could
effectively be responsible for genetic isolation of the species. Based on similarities in estimated divergence time
(around 2 Myr) and spatial barrier (the Kabylies)
between distinct lineages, it is tempting to think that
Pliocene climatic fluctuations would have also contributed to the east-west subdivision of Crocidura russula in
north Africa [55]. As we suggested previously [9], Pleistocene climatic changes involving the formation of glacial refuges would have afterward strengthened the split
between both B and C lineages. Of north African
refuges described in the past, two are located in the
west and are separated by the Atlas Mountains in Morocco, while two others are in the Algerian-Tunisian Tell
area [65,66]. However, the climatic fluctuations occurring in Europe during the Pleistocene would not have
greatly affected the northern part of Africa (Frizon de
Lamotte, comm. pers.). In spite of a large proximity
between Europe and Africa, the glacial episode would
really have had only minor effects on flora and fauna in
north Africa [67]. Consequently, a scenario involving
successive retreats and advances of snails into and from
matorral formations described as potential refuges in
the Kabylies and Tunisia during the last pleniglacial [9]
must be regarded as tentative. The vegetation map
reconstruction presented recently by Ray and Adams
[68] indicates three main vegetation types at the LGM
in north Africa: (i) a tropical woodland lying between

Page 13 of 20

the Algerian coastline and the Tell, (ii) a tropical semidesert spreading from east north Africa (Tunisia)
towards the southwestern Moroccan coast and corresponding to the Atlas domains, (ii) a tropical grassland
south of the Rif and corresponding to the Moroccan
Meseta. This vegetational pattern, showing a clear shift
between deciduous woody vegetation in west and sparse
(rocky) vegetation in east, fits better the west-east pattern of genetic variation with Kabylia at the intersection.
Ecological constraint due to climatic changes would
have then reinforced the B-C split occurred long before.
Finally, Pliocene and Pleistocene climatic fluctuations
should have influenced the distribution and the evolution of C. aspersum in north Africa. However, signatures
left provide insufficient information to infer precisely the
modes and timing of the genetic B-C split. The influence of Quaternary climatic changes is more evident in
Iberia, where the occurrence of both B and C lineages
can be explained by the persistence of several separate
refugia throughout the Pleistocene Ice Ages. Recent parallel phylogeographical patterns support the idea that
the Iberian Peninsula comprised a “refugia-within-refugia” rather than a single survival area [69]. Amongst the
seven putative terrestrial refugia suggested by these
authors (Fig 1), the Betic range and Picos de Europa
coincide quite strikingly with the tectonic hypothesis
proposed and the spatial genetic pattern inferred from
allozymes and/or the haplotype distribution in C. aspersum. It seems reasonable to assume that each lineage
previously differentiated evolved in isolated refugia during glacial periods, such as near the Betic range for the
C clade and in the Picos de Europa area for the B lineage. Range expansion during favourable climatic conditions, that is, from the Günz-Mindel stage for B and the
Mindel-Riss stage for C, would lead to the contact zone
observed in Galicia. Moreover, the occurrence of C haplotypes in the Betic area would agree with the geological
scenario based on microplate drift from Oligocene, since
the Betic with the Rif Cordillera formed a continuous
orogenic belt together with the Kabylies blocks, the
Balearic Islands, Calabria, Corsica and Sardinia [31].
However, haplotypes identified in Sardinia and Balearic
Islands do not support this scenario but sampling is
extremely poor in these areas as in Corsica. For the Tyrrhenian region, populations collected very recently in
Sicily but not yet analysed should indicate close relationships with C haplotypes, especially Tunisian ones.
Beyond geological assumption of a land connection
between Europe and Africa in the continuity of the
Maghrebides at the level of the present Sicilian canal
until late the Pliocene (2 Myr; [31]), allozyme and morphometric features indicate similarities between southernmost Italian samples analysed and eastern north
African populations [9,14]. An alternative assumption of

secondary contacts versus a differentiation centre in the
southern Italian Peninsula could equally lead to resemblance between those peri-Tyrrhenian populations.
Although we are very short of sequences from these
areas, the derived position from eastern African haplotypes of the unique Italian 16S type would rather favour
the hypothesis that Italy would have become a contact
zone between African and European populations. Morover, as mentioned above, the most likely north African
origin of Mediterranean species supports this scenario.

Conclusion
While keeping in mind the role of anthropogenic pathways in the spread of the species, time estimates and
genetic discontinuities lead to suggest that Pliocene and
Pleistocene climatic changes would have played a significant role in shaping variation in north Africa. However,
the distribution of haplotypes compared to the presentday position of blocks drifted in the western Mediterranean basin during the Tertiary could not rule out the
hypothesis referring to much an older vicariance process
to account for the whole biogeographical pattern of C.
aspersum. Contrary to the tectonic scenario we previously proposed [9], the circum-Mediterranean range of
typical eastern types would favour dispersal through
plate migration of an eastern ancestor rather than a
western one. Subsequent orogenic events such as the
Tell Atlas building that may have impeded gene
exchange between populations on the two sides of the
mountain chain, combined with climatic fluctuations
from mid-Pliocene to the last ice age, could thus explain
the east-west subdivision in north Africa. The time to
the most recent common ancestor estimated for C.
aspersum, as for each of the B (west) and C (east)
lineages, supports this parsimonious scenario. The intermediate position of Kabylia, as regards both geography
and genetics, would explain unstable phylogenetic relationships of haplotypes of this area. This main region,
recently recognised with Numidia and Kroumiria as a
hotspot of biodiversity in the Mediterranean basin [70],
would have been first a centre of dispersal and then of
secondary contact between isolated lineages (models 1
and 2, Fig 2). The retreat of populations into the
Edough Peninsula, that seems to have served as refugia
for many species during Pliocene marine transgression,
could have accentuated the genetic cleavage between the
B and C entities. Subsequent population expansion
towards the east when floods ended could partially
explain the low nuclear (allozyme) and mitochondrial
variability characterizing especially Tunisian samples
[9,15]. Transitory and prolonged bottlenecks inherent to
successive migrations that likely continued until the
LGM would moreover be compatible with demographic
expansion observed in that easternmost north African

Page 15 of 20

region. Also, northward expansions with climatic
improvements since the Mindel-Riss interglacial stage
would indicate a loss of the eastern lineage during
expansion phases. Whatever the range of C. aspersum,
the typical eastern populations seem to have been limited in their dispersal after the LGM.
To resume, the different steps of the scenario inferred
involve a northward colonization of the western lineage
that would have diverged form eastern ancestral type.
Most data support the migration model 1, which however needs to be refined in considering the dual role of
the Kabylia (Fig 2). In relation to vicariant and dispersal
events that could have played a role in the colonization
process of both lineages, discrepancies in the success of
northward expansion could also reflect variation in
adaptive potential of populations among B and C
lineages. The extinction probability of populations in
changing environments being higher in small than in
large populations, one might imagine that typical eastern
populations experienced severe and prolonged bottlenecks. As well as demographic studies, efforts should be
made to research other possible causes of variation in
the colonization process between both lineages. Moreover, this biogeographic scenario should be evaluated (i)
by searching for concordant phylogeographic patterns of
codistributed species to indicate the influence of common historical factors, (ii) by analysing populations with
more extensive sampling, especially in the two putative
contact zones identified (Kabylia and Galicia) as in
southern Italian Peninsula, and (iii) in incorporating
calibration points different from the dubious shell fossils
recorded as C. aspersum.

Methods
Samples

Most individuals analysed here originated from populations previously sampled for anatomical and biochemical
surveys [9,12,14,16,71]; other populations were sampled
specifically for the current analysis. Overall, 73 localities
were considered, 66 and 49 for 16S rRNA and cyt b
genes respectively (Fig 1). Individuals of the subspecies
maxima coming from a snail farm in Brittany (France)
were also analysed and used as outgroups in phylogenetic and network-based analyses. Sample site characteristics and haplotype codes are given as additional file 1.
DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing

The protocol followed here has been described in [15].
Briefly, total genomic DNA was obtained from foot and
mantle muscles of either fresh or frozen material stored
since previous investigations. Protein extracts of liver or
muscle were used when foot and mantle were not available. We used either the CTAB, or the chelex extraction
protocols for both frozen and fresh material [15]. We
amplified fragments of approximately 380 and 560 bp

Guiller and Madec BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:18
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/18

for the 16S rRNA and cyt b mitochondrial genes respectively. The 16S fragment was amplified using primers
16S-1 (5’-TGACTGTGCAAAGGTAGC-3’) and 16S2
(5’-CTGGCTTACGCCGGTCTG-3’) [72]. The cyt b
region was amplified using Cytb1 (5’-TTATTGAGGCGCTACGGTTAT-3’) and Cytb2 (5’-GCAAGCGAAATATAAGGTTCT-3’) primers. Amplification of
template DNA was carried out in a volume of 25 μl
consisting of 10 mM Tris-HCl (ph 9.0), 50 mM KCl, 1.5
mM MgCl2, 200 μm of each dNTP, stabilizers including
BSA, 1.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Ready to Go®,
Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.), 0.20 μm of each primer
and 50 ng of DNA. The PCR conditions were for 16S
rRNA, an initial denaturation step of 94°C (5 min), followed by 35 cycles of 94°C (30 s), 50°C (30 s), 72°C (40
s) and a final extension phase at 72°C for 3 min; for cyt
b, an initial denaturation step of 94°C (5 min), followed
by 35 cycles of 94°C (40 s), 50°C (40 s), 72°C (1 min)
and a final extension phase at 72°C for 5 min. Doublestrand sequences were obtained by direct manual
sequencing of the PCR products using the Sequenase
v.2 PCR product sequencing kit (Amersham), or using
an automated sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems 310
Genetic Analyser, UMR 6553; plate-forme de séquençage et génotypage OUEST-genopole®).
Sequence analysis

Mitochondrial sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW, v1.7 [73]. For the 16S RNA region, they were
manually adjusted, based on the secondary structure of
the large ribosomal subunit of C. nemoralis [74]. The
sequences were submitted to GenBank (Additional file
1). Analyses of sequence polymorphism were carried out
using DNASP v4.10.9 [75] and ARLEQUIN v3.1 [76].
Phylogenetic analysis

The degree of phylogenetic signal was first evaluated in
both gene data sets by performing the left-skewness (g1)
test using 10 000 randomly generated trees under the
maximum likelihood criterion, as implemented in
PAUP* v4.0b10 [77]. For inferring phylogenetic relationships among individuals, we used maximum likelihood
(ML) and bayesian-based inference (BI) methods. The
best fit model of nucleotide substitutions was selected
prior to ML and BI analyses using the Akaike Information Criterion. The software MrAIC v1.4.2 [78] was
used to evaluate the fit of the data to 24 different models of nucleotide substitutions. For both genes, the
resulting best fit model was HKY, with two different
rates for transitions and transversions, unequal base frequencies, a parameter for invariable sites (I) and a
gamma distribution parameter that describes rate variation across variable sites (Γ). This model of nucleotide
substitution was incorporated in PHYML V2.4.4[79] and
in MRBAYES v3.1.1-p1 [80] for ML and BI analyses
respectively. For ML analysis, the robustness of

Page 16 of 20

inferences was assessed by bootstrap resampling using
1000 repetitions. For Bayesian analysis, the posterior
probabilities of trees and parameters were approximated
with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Metropolis coupling. For each gene, we ran two independent
MCMC analyses with four chains each and a temperature set to 0.2. Each chain was run for 2 000 000 cycles
with trees sampled every 100 generations. Posterior
probabilities were obtained from the 50% majority rules
consensus of trees sampled after discarding the trees
saved before chains reached apparent stationarity (i.e. a
‘burn-in period” of 50 000 generations for 16S rRNA, 52
000 for cyt b). Due to low divergence among individuals
and possible persistence of ancestral nodes along with
descendants, network-based approaches are better suited
for intraspecific phylogeny than tree-based algorithms
[81]. Consequently for both mtDNA regions, the median
joining algorithm implemented in Network v4.2.0.1 software [82] was also used with default settings for constructing networks (weight = 10 and ε = 0). Due to the
high gene diversity in both mtDNA regions, each data
set was first reduced using the star contraction option
which identifies and contracts any starlike phylogenetic
cluster into one ancestral type. Median networks that
contained all possible equally short trees were simplified
by running the maximum parsimony (MP) calculation
option to eliminate superfluous nodes and links.
Before evaluating divergence-time estimates between
lineages, we checked whether sequences were evolving
at a uniform rate along all branches in a phylogeny. We
first performed a molecular-clock likelihood-ratio test
(LRT) [83] by comparing the likelihood scores (lnL1 and
lnL2) of the same tree constructed under alternative
molecular clock assumptions (relaxed versus enforced
molecular clock). The statistic Δ = 2(lnL1-lnL2) can be
compared with a c2 distribution with (n-2) degrees of
freedom (where n is the number of haplotypes). Secondly we conducted a relative rate test (RRT; [84]) as
implemented in RRTree [85] for assessing variation in
substitution rates between lineages relative to the outgroup C. a. maxima. For the RRT, p values were corrected using the Bonferroni method to account for
multiple pairwise comparisons when more than two
lineages were identified.
Pattern of migration

Alternate hypotheses of migration were tested by estimating historic migration rates between north Africa
and European populations. We compared models
employing asymmetric versus symmetric migration rates
between European and north African clusters of populations for both genes separately. Because of the small
number of European populations in the C (East) haplogroup, estimates were however restricted to the B
(West) haplogroup with the Z sequences removed. We

Guiller and Madec BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:18
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/18

used the program MIGRATE-n v. 3.0 [86] to obtain
maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of theta (θ = Nμ)
and Nm (effective number of migrants per generation).
We obtained MLEs for four models of migration
between both regions (bidirectional rates with asymmetric MNA-E ≠ ME-NA or symmetric MNA-E = M E-NA
rates; unidirectional rates with MNA-E = 0 or ME-NA =
0). We used likelihood ratio tests and the Akaike Information Criterion to choose the model best supported by
the data (smaller values of AIC indicating better fit).
The program was run with 15 short chains with an
increment of 50 and 2000 trees recorded, followed by 3
long chains of 25 000 000 generations each, from which
50 000 trees were sampled after a burnin-period of
5000. We also optimized all models in specifying Ti/Tv
ratio (2.56 for cyt b and 1.51 for 16S) and gamma distribution shape parameter (a = 0.75 for both genes) from
empirical estimates in PAUP* 4.0b [77].
Demographic analyses

The demographic history of populations was inferred
using tests of population growth. Fu’s Fs [87] and
Ramos-Onsins & Rozas’ R 2 [88] are among the most
powerful statistics to detect demographic expansions;
they were estimated using DNASP v4.10.9 [75] and
ARLEQUIN v3.1 [76], and their significances were
assessed using 1000 coalescent simulated resamplings.
We also performed mismatch distribution analyses to
evaluate possible historical events of population growth
and decline [89]. Indeed, populations that have experienced a rapid expansion in the recent past show unimodal distributions, while those at demographic
equilibrium have multimodal distributions. Mismatch
distributions were computed for each haplogroup and
compared to the expected distributions obtained under
a model of sudden expansion.
An approach based on coalescent theory was also used
to estimate the demographic history of lineages within
C. aspersum. Under a coalescent model, it is possible to
infer population parameters from genetic sequence data
such as mutation rates and divergence time estimates
which themselves provide information about effective
population sizes through time. We chose the Bayesian
Skyline Plot (BSP, [90]) model for inferring past population dynamics. The BSP has the advantage over commonly-used demographic models and skyline plot
methods [91] of being independent of a prespecified
parametric model of demographic history, and its parameters are directly estimated from sequences, thus limiting the error inherent in phylogenetic reconstruction.
The BSP model used MCMC sampling procedures to
estimate credibility intervals of the demographic parameters. Parameters were estimated with the software
BEAST v1.4.2 [92]. After an optimization step during
which parameters of the prior function were changed at

Page 17 of 20

each run to reach optimum performance and achieve a
reasonable effective sampling size (ESS, number of independent samples of the posterior distribution that the
trace is equivalent to) of parameters of interest, we carried out two independent runs of 20 million generations
each. Samples of trees and parameters were recorded
every 1000 steps. Visualization and diagnosis analysis of
each independent BEAST run were done using TRACER
v1 [93]. This program leads to redefine the burn-in period (set by default to 10% of the MCMC chain length)
and check the convergence of the independent chains.
The analysis was repeated after splitting the data into a
B versus C haplogroup, motivated by earlier results. To
provide estimates of time to the most common ancestor
(TMCRA) of C. aspersum populations, along with the
TMCRAs of the B and C lineages (see Results), divergence dates were computed using BEAST. Estimates
were based on published mutation rates for land snails.
Evolutionary rates at mtDNA genes have been estimated
in a few terrestrial gastropods though not in C. aspersum. Evidence from Pliocene shell fossils (5.3-1.8 Myr)
from several sites around the Mediterranean (Oran,
Sicile, Nice; [8]) indicates that C. aspersum was already
quite widespread in the late Tertiary. However such fossil records, even if shell specimens were assigned to C.
aspersum species with sufficient confidence, do not
allow to go down at the subspecies level (aspersa or
maxima) even less down to mtDNA lineage within
aspersa. Information from the fossil record, inadequate
for calibrating a molecular clock, can only indicate the
minimum age of C. aspersum. Estimates in gastropods,
intraspecific published estimates vary greatly for 16S
rRNA [94-96], as for protein-encoding mitochondrial
genes [97-99]. Without more information, we used and
tested a range of calibrated rates of change from 0.03 to
5% for cyt b excluding the third codon position, and
from 0.5 to 10% for 16S rRNA, to calculate a rough estimate of the timing of divergence events. In all cases we
used an HKY model of nucleotide substitution. Results
were compared with the estimated times based on allozyme evolution (0.08-0.10 DNei/Myr; [32]) which we
published previously [9].
