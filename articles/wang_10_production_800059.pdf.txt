Abstract
Background: The effects of enterolignans, e.g., enterodiol (END) and particularly its oxidation product,
enterolactone (ENL), on prevention of hormone-dependent diseases, such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases,
hyperlipemia, breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer and menopausal syndrome, have attracted much
attention. To date, the main way to obtain END and ENL is chemical synthesis, which is expensive and inevitably
leads to environmental pollution. To explore a more economic and eco-friendly production method, we explored
biotransformation of enterolignans from precursors contained in defatted flaxseeds by human intestinal bacteria.
Results: We cultured fecal specimens from healthy young adults in media containing defatted flaxseeds and
detected END from the culture supernatant. Following selection through successive subcultures of the fecal
microbiota with defatted flaxseeds as the only carbon source, we obtained a bacterial consortium, designated as
END-49, which contained the smallest number of bacterial types still capable of metabolizing defatted flaxseeds to
produce END. Based on analysis with pulsed field gel electrophoresis, END-49 was found to consist of five
genomically distinct bacterial lineages, designated Group I-V, with Group I strains dominating the culture. None of
the individual Group I-V strains produced END, demonstrating that the biotransformation of substrates in defatted
flaxseeds into END is a joint work by different members of the END-49 bacterial consortium. Interestingly, Group I
strains produced secoisolariciresinol, an important intermediate of END production; 16S rRNA analysis of one Group
I strain established its close relatedness with Klebsiella. Genomic analysis is under way to identify all members in
END-49 involved in the biotransformation and the actual pathway leading to END-production.
Conclusion: Biotransformation is a very economic, efficient and environmentally friendly way of mass-producing
enterodiol from defatted flaxseeds.

Background
Early in the 1980s, enterodiol (END) and enterolactone
(ENL) were first detected in the serum, urine and bile of
humans and several animals [1,2]. They were classified
as phytoestrogens due to their origins from plants and
their estrogenic as well as antiestrogenic activities in
humans. Epidemiologic and pharmacologic studies have
shown that END and particularly its oxidation product

ENL have preventive effects on osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, hyperlipemia, breast cancer, colon cancer,
prostate cancer and menopausal syndrome [3-7]. Unlike
other plant-derived lignans, they are also known as
mammalian lignan or enterolignan, because they are
mainly found in mammals. Numerous studies have indicated that END and ENL can be produced from several
plants, such as flaxseed, by bacteria in the intestinal
tract of humans and animals. Thompson et al. tested 68
common plant foods and found that flaxseed flour and
its defatted meal produced the highest yield of END and
ENL in vitro, up to 800 times higher than that from
others [8].

Flaxseed is the dried seed of Linum usitatissimum L.,
which is widely distributed in northern China, with an
annual output of 420,000 tons (ranking fourth in the
world). The important precursors of END and ENL
synthesis include secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG),
secoisolariciresinol (SECO), matairesinol (MAT), lariciresinol (LCS) and pinoresinol (PRS) [9-11]. Among these
precursors, SDG is the most abundant lignan in flaxseed, with a content of around 6.1-13.3 mg g-1 (dry matter) in whole flaxseeds, and 11.7-24.1 mg g -1 (dry
matter) in the defatted flour [12].
Although de novo synthesis of END and ENL has been
reported [13], the processes of synthesis are very complex and expensive, requiring more than ten major
steps. More importantly, the reagents used in the reactions for the synthesis include LiAlH4, MeOH and several other chemicals, which are toxic and harmful to the
environment. Therefore, biotransformation of precursors
in plants to END or ENL is highly desirable.
Biotransformation of SDG to END and ENL by human
intestinal bacteria has been extensively studied, the pathway consisting of glycoside hydrolysis, demethylation,
and dehydroxylation of SDG and its intermediates [9].
Bacteria that can produce END and ENL on plant lignans
under strictly anaerobic conditions have been isolated
from human feces [14-23] (Fig. 1). However, sufficient
yields for marketing scale production of END and ENL
by these microbes have not been achieved, largely due to
the difficulty to create and maintain the strictly anaerobic
culture conditions under which the bacteria can grow
and conduct the biotransformation.
In China, flaxseeds are mainly used as oil crop. The
defatted waste, though a rich source of lignans, is mostly
used as animal feed. To establish a method for producing enterolignans from defatted flaxseeds by bacterial
biotransformation, we screened human fecal samples
and obtained cultures that can efficiently produce END.
After 49 rounds of selection by successive subcultures of
human fecal bacterial microbiota in media containing
defatted flaxseeds as the only carbon source, we
obtained a group of mixed bacteria that could metabolize flaxseeds to produce END under both anaerobic
and aerobic culture conditions. In this paper, we report
the method and discuss its potential applications for
large scale production of enterolignans.

Results
Determining culture media for bacterial production of
END from defatted flaxseeds

To select the human intestinal bacteria that could efficiently metabolize flaxseed lignans to produce END
without the need of strictly anaerobic culture conditions,
we compared three types of culture media (A, B, C; see
components in Methods).

Page 2 of 9

When the cultures were terminated, END could be
detected in media A and B, but not C, with the yield of
END in medium B being considerably higher than that
in medium A (Fig. 2). These results indicated that a
nitrogen source (NH4Cl in this study, present in B but
not in C) was necessary to support the bacteria that
could transform flaxseed lignans into END. Based on
these results, we chose medium B for bacterial cultures.
Optimization of culture conditions for large-scale
production of END

For large-scale production of END, we increased the
volume of medium B from 3 ml to 2 liter with 40 g
defatted flaxseeds in 4 liter Erlenmeyer flasks. In one of
the Erlenmeyer flasks, 50 ml liquid paraffin was added
on top of the culture medium; in another Erlenmeyer
flask, no liquid paraffin was added, for comparison of
effects of anaerobic vs aerobic culture conditions on
END production. The culture was continued at 37°C for
6 days and then terminated for analysis of END production. Interestingly, cultures with or without liquid paraffin added on top of the culture had similar yields of
END and the concentration of END reached 86.76 ±
4.19 mg l-1 in both cases, demonstrating that biotransformation of flaxseed lignans into END in our system
did not require strict anaerobic conditions.
Enrichment of END

We treated the cultures (in medium B; see above) with 3
fold volumes of 95% ethanol to terminate the culture
and to precipitate the macromolecule substances in the
culture. We then evaporated the supernatant at 50°C
under reduced pressure and retrieved a ca. 30 g pellet
from a 2 liter culture. We dissolved the pellet in 300 ml
of 5% ethanol, chromatographed the solution on 300 g
of XAD-2 macroporous resin column, and successively
eluted the column with 2.5 liter of 5%-50% ethanol solutions, with 5% ethanol concentration gradient increases.
Each elute was analyzed by HPLC. As shown in Fig. 3,
END was mainly eluted by 40% ethanol; the END production could reach up to 3.9 mg g -1 . The produced
END was identified as (+)-END with reference to the
published data ([a]25D +13° (c = 0.10, MeOH); [18]).
Selection of END-producing bacteria by successive
subcultures

In the first few passages, there was a great diversity of
microbes in the culture as examined by Gram staining
and PFGE analysis (data not shown). Starting with passage 40 (END-40), the microbial diversity became gradually reduced. END-49 was the last passage that could
still produce END, although the product took a longer
time to appear (Fig. 4) and the yield was also significantly decreased (18.0 ± 0.51 mg ml-1 as compared to

pathway, along with the authors who reported them, are indicated.

Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of END-49

A 0.1 ml aliquot of the END-49 culture was spread on
an LB plate and well isolated single colonies were picked
up the following day. We then took 32 colonies with
seemingly different morphologies and isolated genomic
DNA from them for PFGE analysis. Based on their similarities of PFGE patterns with SpeI cleavage, we categorized the 32 bacterial strains into five distinct groups
(Group I - V), with Group I containing as many as 18
of the 32 strains (Fig. 5). The remaining 14 strains were
categorized into four groups (group II - V; Fig. 5).

23.42 ± 0.99 mg ml-1 in END-1; p < 0.01). When END49 was diluted for further passages, END was hardly
detected. Therefore, we speculated that END-49 contained the minimal number of bacterial members that
would be necessary to cooperate in producing END.

The dominance of Group I strains in the minimal bacterial consortium that was still capable of producing
END from defatted flaxseeds suggests that this bacterial
lineage might be the main player in the biotransformation to produce END. To assess their roles in this biochemical process, we randomly picked seven Group I
colonies (designated S1 to S7), grew them on defatted
flaxseeds and analyzed the culture for the presence of
END. No END was detected from any of the seven
Group I strains. Instead, we detected SECO, a key

intermediate in the transformation of flaxseed lignans
(e.g., SDG) to END (see figure 1), from all seven tested
Group I strains. After one day of incubation, SECO concentration was 34.97 ± 0.98 mg l -1. When the incubation continued, the maximum concentration reached
122.05 ± 7.67 mg l-1 . No END or SECO was detected
from the Group II-V strains. We initiated genomic analysis of these bacteria, beginning with S1 through S7,
using the endonuclease I-CeuI, which reflects

phylogenetic relationships among bacteria [24-26]. All
seven strains had indistinguishable I-CeuI cleavage patterns after PFGE (Fig. 6), and this pattern is very similar
to bacteria in the genus Klebsiella [27]; no difference in
cleavage pattern by SpeI, XbaI or AvrII was seen either
among the seven strains (data not shown). Comparisons
of 16S rRNA sequence of S1 with those of sequenced
bacterial genomes in Genbank revealed close phylogenetic relatedness of S1 to Klebsiella strains; the 16S
rRNA sequence has been deposited to Genbank with
the accession number of GQ464976. Genomic analysis
is under way to determine the identity and relative
abundance of all members in END-49.

Discussion
The likely health values of enterolignans and, on the
other hand, difficulties in its large scale industrial production at low cost and without environmental pollution
call for biotransformation technologies to convert plant
lignans to them. Numerous bacterial isolates that can
conduct the biotransformation have been reported
[8,10,12,14-20,23]. However, most of the reported bacteria require strict anaerobic conditions to grow and
metabolize plant lignans to produce enterolignans,
which significantly restricts large scale production. Here
in this study, we report highly efficient production of
END from defatted flaxseeds through biotransformation
by human intestinal bacteria without having to culture

the bacteria under anaerobic conditions. The method
described here has four advantages. First, instead of
pure lignans (SDG, SECO, MAT, etc.), defatted flaxseed
flour was used as the substrate for END production. As
flaxseeds are widely available around the world and the
defatted by-products of flaxseeds are usually used as animal feeds or even treated as waste, our study provides a
very economic and eco-friendly method of END production using these low cost materials. Second, the high
efficiency of END production by our bacterial culture
system without the need of strictly anaerobic conditions
makes large scale production much easier. Third, no
extra carbon source would be needed in the culture,
which is especially advantageous, because the most
energy-efficient carbon sources, e.g., glucose, normally
repress the utilization of other energy sources by microorganisms. Therefore, in the absence of common carbon
sources, the biotransformation of flaxseeds into END
would be remarkably enhanced. Fourth, this method is

entirely harmless to the environment, as the solvents
used in this procedure were only water and ethanol,
both of which could be recycled.
In this study, a bacterial consortium, END-49, was
obtained from human intestinal microbiota through successive subcultures. END-49 was highly efficient in converting flaxseed lignans into END, producing up to 3.9
mg g-1, much higher than previously reported 0.6 mg g-1
(such as in [8]). END-49 consists of at least five genomically different bacterial lineages as estimated on the basis
of PFGE analysis. As none of the single-colony isolated
bacterial strains could produce END, we postulate that
the biotransformation was conducted jointly by several
different bacteria, including some or all the PFGEresolved Group I-V strains and possibly some bacteria
that escaped detection in this study. The Next-Generation sequencing technologies (e.g., 454 and SOLiD) may
eventually help identify the END-producers by determining the whole genome sequences of all bacteria in the

was converted to (+)-END by human intestinal microbiota via (+)-SECO as a metabolic intermediate.
The method described in this study had been optimized and could be used to obtain bacterial consortia
that can convert plant lignans into END or related products. Using this method, we screened fecal specimens
from 28 young adults and detected END or its dehydrogenized product in all cases (data not shown), consistent
with previous reports that bacteria that can convert
plant lignans into END or related products are common
members of the human intestinal microbiota [28,29] and
they are readily obtainable for use in the bio-production
of END.

Conclusion
Biotransformation is a very economic, efficient and
environmentally friendly way of mass-producing enterodiol from defatted flaxseeds.

consortium and facilitate the elucidation of the pathways
of END production by these bacteria.
END and ENL have two enantiomeric mirror image
forms, which can be inter-converted by intestinal bacteria. In our study, END produced by “END-49” was
(+)-form, consistent with the published work [18] in
which SDG from flaxseed was transformed to (+)-ENL
via (+)-SECO. Additionally, researchers have confirmed
that the absolute configurations at C-2 and C-3 of END
and ENL were not changed during the microbial metabolism [22]. Therefore, obviously, in our study, SDG

Flaxseed samples were collected from Bei-An County of
Heilongjiang Province, China, and were identified as the
dried seeds of Linum usitatissimum L. by author. Voucher specimens (sample no. 071024) were deposited was
deposited in the herbarium of pharmacognosy research
group, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center. They were ground into
powder (pass 40 mesh sieve) and then defatted by petroleum ether prior to use.
Culture media and bacterial culture

Cooked meat medium base and Luria-Bertani (LB)
nutrient agar were purchased from Beijing Land Bridge
technology Co. Ltd (Beijing, China). Medium A contained tryptone 30 g, yeast extract 5 g, beef powder 5 g,
glucose 3 g, NaH 2 PO 4 5 g and amidulin 2 g, and the

Wang et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:115

volume was made up to 1 liter with distilled water.
Medium B was designed to lack any carbon source in
the medium except defatted flaxseeds (see below), containing the following reagents (in one liter): NaCl 3 g,
KH2PO4 2.6 g, K2HPO4 1.85 g, 1% (v/v) reducing solution (30 g/l L-aminothiopropionic acid and 30 g/l
sodium hyposulfite, dissolved in PBS), and 1 g NH4Cl.
Medium C was the same as medium B except the
absence of any nitrogen source.
Culture was conducted as follows: 0.3 g of defatted
flaxseeds was added into each of tubes containing either
medium A, B or C (3 ml), which were then sealed with
liquid paraffin and autoclaved at 121°C for 15 min. Into
the medium, 0.3 g of fresh human feces was added and
incubated at 37°C for 72 h. Supernatant of the cultures
was then inspected for the appearance of END.
Collection and processing of fecal samples

Initially, fresh fecal specimens (ca. 4.0 g each),
obtained from 28 healthy young subjects (fourteen
females and fourteen males, 22-33 years old), were suspended in 20 ml sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS,
2.6 g l-1 KH2PO4, 1.85 g l-1 K2HPO4, PH 7.4) and 2 ml
such fecal suspension was transferred to 20 ml medium, followed by incubation at 37°C for 36 h. During
the fecal collection and culture preparation, no strictly
anaerobic techniques or instruments were used. The
fecal specimen that we used for END production was
from a 33 years old female.
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)

The HPLC system consisted of Agilent 1200 series
HPLC apparatus (Agilent Technologies, USA), including
high-pressure binary-gradient solvent-delivery pump,
DAD detector, autosampler, thermostat column compartment and chemstation (9.01 edition). Zorbax SBC18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm) was used to
analyze all of the samples. Mobile phase consisted of
water (A) and acetonitrile (B) in a linear gradient change
from 100% A to 50% A and 50% B in 30 min. Detection
wavelength was 280 nm, and the temperature of the column oven was 25°C with a flow rate of 1.0 ml min-1.
Calibration of the END and SECO curves

The stock solutions of END standard (1.98 mg ml-1) and
SECO standard (175.5 μg ml-1) were prepared by accurately weighing and transferring each of them into a
volumetric flask (1 ml) and dissolving it in methanol.
Solutions for END calibration (0.0198 ~ 1.98 mg ml-1)
and SECO calibration (175.5 ~ 2.74 μg ml-1) were prepared by dilution of the stock solutions with methanol,
with six dilution series being analyzed (1.98, 0.99, 0.396,
0.198, 0.099, 0.0198 mg ml-1) for END calibration and
seven dilution series being analyzed (175.5, 87.75, 43.86,

Page 7 of 9

21.94, 10.97, 5.48, 2.74 μg ml-1) for SECO calibration.
For each calibration curve, independent dilutions were
analyzed. The calibration equation of END was obtained
by plotting HPLC peak areas (Y) versus the concentration of calibrators (X, mg ml-1), which was as follows:
Y = 4433.46 X + 63.86 (R2 = 0.9999), with a good linearity over the range from 0.0198 mg ml -1 to 1.98 mg
ml-1, and the calibration equation of SECO was obtained
by plotting HPLC peak areas (Y) versus the concentration of calibrators (X, μg ml-1), which was as follows: Y
= 12.59 X - 1.40 (R 2 = 0.9998), with a good linearity
over the range from 2.74 μg ml-1 to 175.5 μg ml-1.
Limits of detection and quantification

Stock solutions of END and SECO standards were
separately diluted to make a series of solutions with
methanol and analyzed by HPLC. On the basis of signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), the limits of detection (LOD)
and quantification (LOQ) of END standard were determined to be 0.699 μg ml-1 (S/N = 3) and 1.398 μg ml-1
(S/N = 10), respectively. The LOD and LOQ of SECO
standard were determined to be 0.690 μg ml-1 (S/N =
3) and 1.370 μg ml-1 (S/N = 10), respectively.
Sampling of the cultures

A volume of 200 μl of culture was sampled every 24 h
and extracted with 400 μl n-butanol saturated with
water. A portion of n-butanol extracts (320 μl) was
transferred to a centrifuge tube and evaporated to dryness by N2. The residue was dissolved in 200 μl methanol and centrifuged for 3 min (12500 r min-1), and then
20 μl of the supernatant was filtered and analyzed by
HPLC.
Successive passages of cultures for sustained production
of END

A culture was started with a fecal specimen at 37°C and
sampled every 24 hours for analysis by HPLC. As END
could be detected in the culture as early as within the
first 24 hours at concentrations of 31.45 ± 1.51 mg l-1
and the yields remained relatively stable for 6 days
(starting to decline on day 9; data not shown), we used
an interval of 6 days for successive passages of the culture by 1:10 dilutions in medium B without paraffin, as
strict anaerobic culture conditions were not necessary
(see above). A portion of the first fecal culture was
stocked on day 6 from the initiation of the culture in
25% (v/v) glycerol at -80°C as “passage 1” (designated as
END-1); a portion of each of all successive subcultures
was stocked on the 6th day of the culture in the same
way and was designated as END-2, END-3, and so on.
To identify the bacteria that were involved in the biotransformation of flaxseed lignans into END, we first
needed to select them out of the initial bacterial mixture

Wang et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:115
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/115

in the fecal specimen. Our general strategy was to dilute
the cultures in which END was produced and use the
highest dilution of the bacterial culture that still produced END for successive passages in medium B, which
would support only the bacteria that use defatted flaxseeds as a carbon source.
