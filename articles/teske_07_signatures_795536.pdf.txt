Abstract
Background: The importance of vicariance events on the establishment of phylogeographic patterns in the marine
environment is well documented, and generally accepted as an important cause of cladogenesis. Founder dispersal (i.e.
long-distance dispersal followed by founder effect speciation) is also frequently invoked as a cause of genetic divergence
among lineages, but its role has long been challenged by vicariance biogeographers. Founder dispersal is likely to be
common in species that colonize remote habitats by means of rafting (e.g. seahorses), as long-distance dispersal events
are likely to be rare and subsequent additional recruitment from the source habitat is unlikely. In the present study, the
relative importance of vicariance and founder dispersal as causes of cladogenesis in a circumglobally distributed seahorse
lineage was investigated using molecular dating. A phylogeny was reconstructed using sequence data from mitochondrial
and nuclear markers, and the well-documented closure of the Central American seaway was used as a primary calibration
point to test whether other bifurcations in the phylogeny could also have been the result of vicariance events. The
feasibility of three other vicariance events was explored: a) the closure of the Indonesian Seaway, resulting in sister
lineages associated with the Indian Ocean and West Pacific, respectively; b) the closure of the Tethyan Seaway, resulting
in sister lineages associated with the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic Ocean, respectively, and c) continental break-up during the
Mesozoic followed by spreading of the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in pairs of lineages with amphi-Atlantic distribution
patterns.
Results: Comparisons of pairwise genetic distances among the seahorse species hypothesized to have diverged as a
result of the closure of the Central American Seaway with those of published teleost sequences having the same
distribution patterns show that the seahorses were among the last to diverge. This suggests that their cladogenesis was
associated with the final closure of this seaway. Although two other divergence events in the phylogeny could potentially
have arisen as a result of the closures of the Indonesian and Tethyan seaways, respectively, the timing of the majority of
bifurcations in the phylogeny differed significantly from the dates of vicariance events suggested in the literature.
Moreover, several divergence events that resulted in the same distribution patterns of lineages at different positions in
the phylogeny did not occur contemporaneously. For that reason, they cannot be the result of the same vicariance
events, a result that is independent of molecular dating.
Conclusion: Interpretations of the cladogenetic events in the seahorse phylogeny based purely on vicariance
biogeographic hypotheses are problematic. We conclude that the evolution of the circumglobally distributed seahorse
lineage was strongly influenced by founder dispersal, and suggest that this mode of speciation may be particularly
important in marine organisms that lack a pelagic dispersal phase and instead disperse by means of rafting.

Background
Bifurcations in a phylogeny can be explained by two
modes of allopatric speciation: vicariance [1] (the establishment of a dispersal barrier separating regional units of
a previously continuously distributed species) and
founder dispersal [2-4] (long-distance dispersal of a small
number of individuals from a source population followed
by founder effect speciation in the absence of additional
gene flow). Although most biogeographers consider both
vicariance and founder dispersal to be important causes of
cladogenesis, speciation as a result of dispersal is sometimes rejected or considered irrelevant noise on the basis
of its sporadic nature. It is argued that in the majority of
cases in which dispersal has been invoked, it is considered
to have affected only individual species rather than the
entire fauna of a particular region [5].
Cladogenesis as a result of founder dispersal may be more
important in seahorses (genus Hippocampus) than in many
other marine organisms studied to date, because of their
life-histories and means of dispersal [6]. Seahorses use a
prehensile tail to hold on to objects that may serve as rafts,
such as floating seaweed [7,8]. As macrobenthic prey
tends to be abundant on these rafts [9], displaced seahorses are likely to survive for a considerable amount of
time. In most species, pregnant male seahorses can have
brood sizes of up to 100–300 individuals [10], suggesting
that a sufficiently large number of closely related individuals may arrive simultaneously at a new habitat to establish themselves. As additional recruitment from the source
population is unlikely (because long-distance dispersal
along the same route is likely to be rare), lack of gene flow
coupled with genetic drift may eventually result in speciation. The combination of seahorses rarely dispersing
through the open ocean, but surviving well in it and having a high potential of successfully founding new populations, makes them interesting models for studying the
relative importance of vicariance and founder dispersal in
marine organisms that disperse by means of rafting.
Molecular dating of marine organisms' phylogenies
Recent advances in the field of model-based analyses have
considerably improved the level of confidence in time
estimates obtained from molecular data [11]. Variations
in evolutionary rates can be accounted for, and uncertainties with regard to calibration points can be incorporated
by specifying upper and/or lower limits for a particular
divergence event. Nonetheless, in recent reviews of molecular biogeography and molecular dating, Heads [12,13]
criticized studies whose results supported cladogenesis as
a result of founder dispersal on the basis of questionable
molecular dating. Molecular dating can be performed
using three methods of calibration: a) dating of the root
of the phylogeny of a particular taxon by using the age of
the taxon's oldest known fossil; b) dating of the age of a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/138

taxon present on a volcanic island by using the age of the
island and c) dating of the cladogenic event that gave rise
to two lineages present on either side of a geological barrier by using the time when the barrier formed. Heads [13]
rejected the first two methods for the following reasons.
Firstly, new fossils are often found that are considerably
older than the previously known oldest fossil of a particular taxon, and it is thus impossible to be certain whether
the oldest fossil of a particular taxon has indeed been
found. The method can be considered particularly problematic in the case of shallow water marine organisms,
whose fossil record is often fragmented [14,15]. Seahorses
present a case in point, because their fossils are known
from only two sites in the northern Mediterranean
[16,17]. Secondly, dating by means of the age of volcanic
islands can be problematic because such islands are
located on subduction zones where new islands are created and old ones disappear continuously, suggesting that
an extant species occurring on a volcanic island may be
older than its habitat.
Molecular dating using vicariance events
Two major types of vicariance events are potentially useful
to calibrate molecular clocks of marine organisms: seaway
closures and continental break-up. The best documented
vicariance event that impacted on the biogeography of
marine species is the closure of the Central American Seaway. The rising of the Isthmus of Panama during the
Pliocene isolated the tropical western Atlantic and eastern
Pacific oceans [18-20] and resulted in the divergence of
formerly continuously distributed species, many of which
have remained morphologically similar and are thus readily recognizable as sister taxa. For that reason, the majority
of studies on marine species have used the closure of the
Central American Seaway as a calibration point [21-23].
However, the utility of such geminate species for calibrating molecular clocks can be nonetheless be problematic.
Firstly, some of the species that have been identified as sister taxa may have diverged prior to the final closure of the
Central American Seaway (3.1 – 3.5 mya [19]), which
results in overestimates of mutation rates [22-24]. Such
earlier divergence may have been the result of the oceanographic changes associated with the rising of the isthmus
before final seaway closure, or originations resulting from
changes in carbonate levels as a result of seaway constriction [25,26]. Secondly, incomplete taxon sampling may
result in the wrong species being identified as sister taxa
[27].

Few studies on marine organisms have sampled lineages
with circumglobal distributions [28,29]. For these, additional seaway closures could be used as calibration points,
which may result in greater precision of molecular dating.

the Atlantic Ocean with the Indo-Pacific via the Mediter-

ranean, has been used comparatively rarely to date phylogenies [30,31]. The reason for this may be that the
occurrence of both tectonism and climate change (resulting in cyclic fluctuations in the sea level) makes dating of
the vicariance event that severed the link between the
Mediterranean and the Indo-Pacific problematic, and the
exact date of this seaway's final closure is disputed.
Drooger [32] considered it to have taken place during the
Late Oligocene (23.8 – 28.5 mya), Adams et al. [33,34]
suggested a Late Early Miocene closure (18.4 – 20.5 mya),
and Rögl and Steininger [35,36] argued for a temporary
re-opening during the Middle Miocene (14.8 – 18.4 mya)
followed by complete closure 11.2 – 14.8 mya. Adams et
al. [37] rejected the evidence for both the Late Oligocene
and Middle Miocene closures on the basis of questionable
dating. The Middle Miocene date for a temporary re-opening of the seaway [35,36] is nevertheless widely accepted,
although some marine organisms from the Indian Ocean
do not seem to have dispersed through the Tethyan seaway
during
this
time
[38].

these has been attributed to temporary closure events of
the Indonesian Throughflow, which presently connects
the Indian and Pacific oceans. Complete and long-lasting
closure events were estimated to have taken place during
the Middle Miocene (15 – 17 mya [44]) and during the
Late Miocene (7.5 – 9.9 mya [45] or 7.0 – 9.5 mya [46]).
A further closure of the Indonesian Seaway took place during the Pliocene (3 – 4 mya [47]). Lastly, tectonic uplifts
and lowered sea level during Pleistocene glaciations
resulted in restricted exchange between Indian Ocean and
West Pacific Ocean faunas [48,49].

Recent genetic work identified the existence of marine sibling species associated with the Indian and Pacific Oceans,
respectively, whose distributions sometimes overlap in
Indonesia [6,39-43]. The divergence between some of

In addition to distribution patterns that may have arisen
as a result of the three seaway closure events, the presence
of sister species on either side of the Atlantic Ocean could
be interpreted as being the result of continental break-up.
Rosen [50] attributed such patterns to sea-floor spreading
and widening of the Atlantic Ocean, following the separation of Africa and South America no later than approximately 84 mya [51].

patric speciation that may have impacted on the
phylogeny of a circumglobally distributed seahorse lineage (Fig. 1), while accounting for the abovementioned
uncertainties regarding molecular dating of the phylogenies of marine organisms. This particular lineage was chosen because its wide distribution may either indicate
ancient vicariance or large-scale dispersal, and because it
may have been affected by more than one vicariance
event. Exact phylogenetic relationships are not fully
understood, but all species associated with this lineage
have been identified using molecular methods [52,53],
ensuring complete taxon sampling. Other seahorse lineages are less useful for this purpose, because they have
more restricted distributions, phylogenetic relationships
are comparatively poorly resolved, and a recent increase
in species descriptions makes it likely that not all species
have yet been identified [52-54].
Without knowledge of divergence times, the distribution
patterns of several pairs of lineages within the circumglobal clade could be interpreted as being the result of vicariance. These include Eastern Pacific vs. Atlantic species
(whose divergence could be the result of the closure of the
Central American Seaway), Indian Ocean vs. West Pacific
species (Indonesian Seaway closure), Atlantic vs. IndoPacific species (Tethyan Seaway closure) and amphiAtlantic species pairs (spreading of the Atlantic Ocean).
Vicariance biogeographers have objected to founder dispersal hypotheses because the sporadic nature of such
events does not make them falsifiable [55]. Although the
establishment of ocean currents has in some cases resulted
in repeated directional long-distance dispersal [56,57],

whether or not a species becomes established in a new
habitat depends considerably on its dispersal abilities and
life history characteristics. Even if a large number of species share a pattern resulting from founder dispersal, it is
unlikely that they all would have colonized a particular
habitat contemporaneously, and molecular dating using
founder dispersal is thus less precise than molecular dating using vicariance events. However, if vicariance
hypotheses can be rejected, then founder dispersal should
be supported by default [5]. In this study, we estimated
the ages of divergence events of seahorse lineages with
geminate distribution patterns by using the well-documented closure of the Central American Seaway as a primary calibration point. Vicariance biogeographic
interpretations of these are challenged if a) divergence
time estimates are significantly different from the dates of
vicariance events suggested in the literature and b) divergence events in different positions in the phylogeny that
have resulted in the same distribution patterns of sister
lineages have occurred at different times.

Results
Phylogenetic reconstructions
A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree reconstructed
from sequence data of three mitochondrial and two
nuclear markers recovered six major clades that were each
associated with a distinct biogeographic region (Fig. 2). A
congruent tree was recovered with Bayesian Inference, and
most nodes were supported by significant posterior probabilities. The most parsimonious tree, on the other hand,
did not recover some of the lineages, but none of the
nodes that differed from the other two phylogenies had
high support (all jackknife values <56). When a parsi-

mony tree was constructed using the two most rapidly
mutating markers only (control region and cytochrome
b), then node A was also recovered.
The distribution patterns of several lineages in the phylogeny indicate that they could be the result of seaway closures or spreading of the Atlantic Ocean (indicated by
letters A – G). In several cases, the same distribution patterns were recovered in different positions in the tree.
Firstly, a split into an Atlantic and an Indo-West Pacific
lineage was recovered twice. The first event (node D)
resulted in a split into an Atlantic Ocean group comprising Hippocampus hippocampus, H. erectus, H. zosterae and H.
guttulatus, and a group whose basal split resulted in an

Indo-West Pacific lineage comprising H. spinosissimus and
H. kelloggi and a lineage comprising all remaining species
(present in the Indo-West Pacific, Atlantic Ocean and
East/Central Pacific). The fact that Indo-West Pacific species are present in both of the latter lineages suggests that
this group may have originated in this region. The second
event that resulted in an Atlantic Ocean and an Indo-West
Pacific lineage is the split defined by node C, resulting in
the divergence of H. capensis (western Indian Ocean) and
the Atlantic/eastern Pacific group comprising H. ingens, H.
fisheri, H. reidi and H. algiricus. Amphi-Atlantic distribution patterns were recovered three times, the most basal
being a split between the eastern Atlantic H. guttulatus and
a group including the western Atlantic species H. erectus

Divergence times were estimated using the program MULTIDIVTIME [102] under the assumption that the closure of the Central American Seaway
(Node A in Fig. 2) resulted in the divergence of two sister lineages associated with the eastern/central Pacific (Hippocampus ingens and H. fisheri) and
Atlantic Oceans (H. reidi and H. algiricus), respectively. Phylogeographic distribution patterns may have been the result of the following vicariance
events. Node B (Indian Ocean vs. West Pacific): Closure of the Indonesian Seaway. Nodes C and D (Indo-Pacific vs. Atlantic Ocean): Closure of the
Tethyan Seaway. Node E, F and G (amphi-Atlantic distribution patterns): continental break-up and spreading of the Atlantic Ocean. Three possible
calibration ranges for the closure of the Central American Seaway were specified. Comparisons of the species affected by this vicariance event with
other teleosts having similar distribution patterns (Fig. 3) indicate that the seahorses were among the last to diverge. This suggests that their
cladogenesis was associated with the final closure of the seaway, i.e. no earlier than approximately 4.6 mya (a hypothesis that is further supported
by the finding that marine organisms in nearshore habitats were among the last species to have diverged as a result of Central American seaway
closure [20,60,61]). Divergence time estimates are indicated as mean ± S.D. (95% confidence interval). Suggested dates of vicariance events: Central
American Seaway closure: 3.1 – 3.5 mya (assuming that the divergence of the transisthmian seahorse lineages took place when a land bridge formed
in Central America [18]); 3.1 – 4.6 (taking into consideration that seahorse divergence may have been affected by the reorganisation of ocean
currents associated with the closure of the seaway [24]); 3.1 – 8.5 mya (the upper bound being the time when the earliest recorded evolution
associated with the closure of the seaway took place in marine corals and foraminiferans [25]); Indonesian Seaway closure: 0.01 – 1.8 [47,48]; 3 – 4
mya [46]; 7 – 10 mya [44,45]; 15 – 17 mya [43]; Tethyan Seaway closure: 11.2 – 14.8 mya [34,35]; 18.4 – 20.5 [36]; 23.8 – 28.5 [31]; complete
separation of the land masses on either side of the Atlantic Ocean: 84 mya [50].

and H. zosterae (node G; this group also includes the eastern Atlantic species H. hippocampus in a derived position),
followed by a later amphi-Atlantic split between H. erectus
and H. hippocampus (node F). The divergence between H.
reidi and H. algiricus resulted in a further amphi-Atlantic
distribution pattern (node E).
Molecular dating
To explore the feasibility that the seahorse lineages
present on either side of the Isthmus of Panama diverged
as a result of Central American Seaway closure, we compared pairwise genetic distances between them with
genetic distances between other geminate teleost lineages
present on both sides of the Isthmus of Panama (Table 1,
Fig. 3). We hypothesized that if the divergence of the seahorse lineages was linked to the final closure of the seaway, then the pairwise distance between them should be
among the lowest of all the teleost lineages investigated.
Pairwise distances were also calculated for pairs of teleost
lineages that could have arisen as a result of the other
three vicariance events relevant to the circumglobally distributed seahorse lineage by virtue of their distribution
patterns. Using relative rate tests, it was found that only
one of the teleost genera whose species have distribution
patterns identical to those of the geminate seahorse lineages was characterized by a significantly different rate
(Lethrinus vs. Hippocampus cytochrome b: difference in the
rate of non-synonymous sites = -0.031 ± 0.015 [S.D.], p =

0.039). The rate of 16S rRNA of a number of genera could
not be compared with the seahorses, because a different
portion of this marker had been sequenced. Pairwise distances between these and the seahorses, as well as those of
Lethrinus and Albula (used as outgroup) and the seahorses,
are nonetheless shown in Fig. 3 and are indicated with
asterisks.
Comparisons of mean K2P distances between pairs of seahorse lineages that may have diverged as a result of vicariance events with those of other teleosts having congruent
distribution patterns indicate that the seahorse lineages
defined by node A in Fig. 2 (Central American Seaway closure) diverged comparatively recently. We considered this
to be evidence for a Pliocene divergence of this lineage as
a result of the final closure of the Central American Seaway, an event that is considered to have occurred no earlier than 4.6 mya. The mean genetic distance among
cytochrome b sequences of the lineage defined by node B
(Indonesian Seaway closure) was slightly lower than that
of the lineage defined by node A, whereas the genetic distance among 16S rRNA sequences was distinctly lower.
K2P distances among control region sequences (not
shown) were also slightly lower for Indonesian Seaway
divergence than for Central American Seaway divergence
(0.036 and 0.043, respectively), indicating that this event
may have taken place during the Late Pliocene or Early
Pleistocene. Present-day distribution patterns of several

Genetic distances among geminate teleost species. Pairwise Kimura 2-Parameter distances [104] between lineages of
seahorses (white squares) and other teleost species (black squares) whose present-day distribution patterns indicate that they
may have diverged as a result of the closures of the Central American, Indonesian, or Tethyan seaways, or as result of continental break-up and spreading of the Atlantic Ocean. A: Cytochrome b sequences; B: 16S rRNA sequences. Letters represent
teleost lineages listed in Table 1. The black arrow indicates the pairwise distance between the two seahorses lineages hypothesized to have diverged as a result of closure of the Central American Seaway. These lineages were used to estimate divergence
times in Table 2. White arrows indicate distances between lineages whose divergence time estimates matched published dates
for the closures of the Indonesian and Tethyan seaways (Table 2). Asterisks indicate teleost lineages whose evolutionary rate
differed from that of the seahorses (A: N), whose rates were not tested because a different portion of 16S rRNA was
sequenced (B: A, C, M, O) or which were used as outgroup in relative rate tests (A: P, R; B: J).

pairs of lineages in the seahorse phylogeny could be interpreted as having resulted from the remaining two vicariance events (two in the case of Tethyan seaway closure
and three in the case of continental break-up during the
Mesozoic). Mean pairwise K2P distances between these
differed considerably, as did distances between other teleost lineages having the same distribution patterns.
Divergence time estimates among seahorse lineages were
obtained using a relaxed molecular clock method [58].
When the final date for the closure of the Central Ameri-

can seaway (3.1 – 3.5 mya) is accepted as the date when
the transisthmian seahorse lineages diverged, based on
the considerations in the previous paragraph, then only
two divergence estimates of nodes defining species pairs
whose distribution patterns indicate that they could have
resulted from vicariance events, matched the dates suggested in the literature (Table 2). Firstly, the Indian Ocean
and West Pacific lineages of H. kuda (node B) were estimated to have diverged 3.73 ± 0.29 mya, which indicates
that this cladogenic event may have resulted from the closure of the Indonesian Seaway 3 – 4 mya [46]. Secondly,

Chronogram of the circumglobal seahorse clade. An ultrametric tree of the circumglobally distributed seahorse lineage
scaled to geological time constructed using the program MULTIDIVTIME [57]. White circles indicate nodes that were used to
calibrate the molecular clock; letters within these correspond to the ones used in Fig. 2. Time intervals used for calibration
were: A: 3.1 – 4.6 mya; B: 3.0 – 4.0 mya; D: 11.2 – 20.5 mya. Grey bars indicate 95% confidence intervals of internal nodes.

the species defined by node D were estimated to have
diverged 15.12 ± 3.46 mya, which matches the temporary
re-opening of the Tethyan seaway during the Middle
Miocene (14.8–18.4 mya) followed by complete closure
11.2 – 14.8 mya [34,35]. However, confidence intervals
for this estimate are comparatively large (9.85 – 23.26
mya), and the earlier date of 18.4 – 20.5 mya [36] must
also be considered feasible.
The establishment of the amphi-Atlantic distribution patterns all post-dated 84 mya, irrespective of the calibration
range used for the closure of the Central American seaway.
This suggests that these were not the result of continental
break-up during the Mesozoic. Because of this, and
because 95% confidence intervals of the divergence dates
of nodes that have resulted in the same distribution pat-

terns did not overlap when a calibration range of 3.1 – 3.5
mya was specified for the closure of the Central American
Seaway (although some overlap was found when wider
calibration ranges were specified, Table 2), interpretations
of the seahorses' present-day distribution patterns based
exclusively on vicariance biogeographic hypotheses are
not well supported.
As divergence time estimates are more precise when multiple calibration points are specified [59], we chose a combination of vicariance events that are likely to have
impacted on cladogenesis in the seahorse phylogeny to
date all other nodes in the phylogeny. The selection of
these was based on the assumption that the divergence
event that resulted from the closure of the Central American Seaway occurred no earlier than 4.6 mya, and that the

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:138

closure of the Indonesian Seaway 3 – 4 mya resulted in the
divergence of the lineages defined by node B. We also
included node D as a calibration point, assuming that the
Atlantic Ocean vs. basally Indo-Pacific distribution of its
species resulted from the closure of the Tethyan Seaway.
Although the timing of this divergence event is comparatively vague, mean divergence times ± S.D. estimated
when only node A (3.1 – 3.5 mya) and only node B (3.0
– 4.0 mya) were used as calibration points fell within the
ranges of the two most reliable dates for this event suggested in the literature (Node A: 15.12 mya ± 3.46 mya;
Node B: 14.11 mya ± 3.27 mya; Rögl and Steininger
[34,35]: 11.2 – 14.8 mya; Adams et al. [32,33]: 18.4 – 20.5
mya). A phylogenetic tree scaled to geological time was
constructed by specifying divergence times for the three
seaway closure events (Pliocene for the Central American
and Indonesian seaways and Late Early to Middle
Miocene for the Tethyan Seaway) is characterized by the
largest number of divergence events having taken place
during the Pliocene (Fig. 4). The 95% confidence intervals
of older divergence events are large compared to most of
the more recent events, as we allowed for a wide calibration range for the root node.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/138

to have occurred some time during the Late Early to Middle Miocene, which is supported by geological estimates
of the timing of the closure of the Tethyan Seaway [3336].
Comparisons with other pairs of geminate teleost species
present on either side of the Isthmus of Panama indicate
that K2P distances ~0.05 for cytochrome b, ~0.045 for
control region (domain II), and ~0.02 for 16S rRNA may
indicate that the lineages under investigation are likely to
have diverged as a result of the final closure of the Central
American Seaway. Assuming a conservative estimate of
3.1 – 4.6 mya for the divergence of these lineages, these
values correspond to approximately 1 – 1.5% (Cytochrome b), 0.9 – 1.4% (control region domain II) and 0.3
– 0.5% (16S rRNA) sequence divergence per million
years, and are thus lower than the commonly used value
of 2% per million years for animal mtDNA [65]. Our
results indicate that the closure of the Indonesian Seaway
may also be useful for calibrating molecular clocks. In this
case, a K2P distance of ~0.03 for cytochrome b, ~0.036 for
control region, and a distance below 0.02 for 16S rRNA
may indicate that the lineages under investigation
diverged as a result of Pliocene closure of the seaway.

Discussion
Seaway closure events as calibration points
In studies of marine organisms that employ molecular
dating, it is common practice to apply the most recent
dates suggested in the geological literature to date divergence events considered to have resulted from the closure
of a seaway [30,60,61]. As the evolutionary histories of
geminate species pairs may be more complicated than is
generally acknowledged, we avoided overconfidence in
calibration points by firstly determining which vicariance
events were most likely to have resulted in present-day
biogeographic patterns of seahorse species associated with
the circumglobal clade, and secondly, by specifying upper
and lower bounds for each calibration point to account
for uncertainties concerning the exact dates of vicariance
events. Comparisons with other teleosts showed that the
amphi-Panamaic distribution pattern arose comparatively recently, and is thus likely to have been linked to the
final closure of the Central American Seaway. As the four
seahorse species affected by the closure of the seaway all
occur in shallow water [62], this conclusion is supported
by the hypothesis that divergence events among species
occurring in the nearshore habitat or in freshwater are
linked to the final closure of the Central American Seaway, whereas species with significant marine phases are
likely to have diverged earlier [20,63,64]. Estimates of the
vicariance event that resulted in the basally Indo-Pacific
vs. Atlantic Ocean distribution pattern defined by node D
(Figs. 2 and 4) were less certain than those of the other
two vicariance events. However, our estimates indicate
that this basal cladogenic event in the phylogeny is likely

Causes of other dichotomies in the phylogeny
Apart from the three seaway closures, there are no obvious
vicariance events that could have resulted in any of the
other dichotomies. None of the divergence events resulting in sister lineages with amphi-Atlantic distributions
could be linked to continental break-up (84 mya) and
spreading of the Atlantic Ocean on the basis of molecular
dating, even when the unlikely upper bound of 8.5 mya
was specified for the closure of the Central American Seaway. This date represents the time when the constriction
of the seaway and the associated increase in carbonatecontent in southern Caribbean deep-sea sediments
resulted in originations in reef corals and carbonate-associated benthic foraminifera, which is unlikely to have
affected shallow-water seahorses. A vicariance biogeographic interpretation of these distribution patterns is further weakened by fossil data: the oldest known fossil of
the family Syngnathidae (of which seahorses are considered to be one of the most derived genera by virtue of their
advanced brood pouch morphology [66]) is less than 50
my old [67].

We suggest that the presence of recently diverged sisterspecies on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean (H. erectus
[east coast of the Americas] and H. hippocampus [Europe];
H. reidi [east coast of the Americas] and H. algiricus [West
Africa]), is the result of founder dispersal. Divergence time
estimates for these two lineages fall into the Late Miocene/
Early Pliocene and Late Pliocene/Pleistocene, respectively.
Teske et al. [53] hypothesized that the ancestor of H. hip-

Page 10 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:138

pocampus colonized Europe from the Americas, as both its
sister species (H. erectus) and the next basal species (H.
zosterae) occur in the Caribbean. A Late Miocene/Early
Pliocene divergence estimate confirms that this colonization may have been facilitated by an intensification of the
Gulf Stream that culminated 3.8 mya [68,69]. As this
change in ocean circulation was the result of the gradual
closing of the Central American Seaway, the founder event
that gave rise to H. hippocampus is thus likely to be the
indirect result of tectonic changes.
The other East Atlantic species, H. algiricus, is also likely to
be the product of long-distance dispersal in an eastward
direction, as its sister species, H. reidi, occurs on the east
coast of the Americas, and the next basal lineage comprises eastern Pacific seahorses. The divergence event that
gave rise to this amphi-Atlantic geminate species pair took
place more recently (Late Pliocene to Pleistocene). There
are numerous examples of such recently established
amphi-Atlantic distributions in the literature, and in
many cases, the lineages in question are morphologically
and genetically so similar that they are considered to be
single species [70-73]. Even the oldest amphi-Atlantic
divergence event in the phylogeny, that between the European species H. guttulatus and the lineage comprising
basal American species (H. zosterae and H. erectus), is
unlikely to be the result of vicariance following the expansion of the Atlantic Ocean, as divergence of this lineages
was estimated to have occurred during the Miocene.
Lastly, vicariance models invoked for the presence of species on Hawai'i suggest that because of the geological history of the Pacific plate, endemic Hawai'ian taxa should
have sister taxon relationships with taxa in the Indo-West
Pacific [74,75]. However, many teleost species present in
the Central Pacific have sister taxon relationships with
East Pacific species, and there is evidence for sporadic dispersal events in either direction [76]. Our finding that the
Hawai'ian seahorse H. fisheri is closely associated with
American/West African seahorses provides a further example of westward dispersal from the Americas, an event that
was estimated to taken place after the closure of the Central American Seaway.

Conclusion
Since the validation of plate-tectonics theory and the
development of cladistic methods, vicariance events have
been primarily invoked to explain disjunct species distributions throughout the world. However, improvements
in molecular dating techniques have resulted in increased
support for recent dispersal hypotheses over more ancient
vicariance events, as in many cases, molecular divergences
were considered too small to be explained by vicariance
[5]. Despite these developments, Heads [12,13] rejected
dispersal hypotheses in favor of vicariance hypotheses,
and considered studies on the phylogeographic history of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/138

cichlid fishes [77,78] (a teleost family of Gondwanan origin that occurs exclusively in freshwater) to be exemplary
in terms of their convincing conclusions (and lack of
molecular dating). Given that long-distance dispersal
between continents is impossible for obligate freshwater
fishes, vicariance hypotheses are appropriate to explain
observed distribution patterns of freshwater organisms.
However, this is completely different in marine organisms, many of which can readily disperse in the oceans
over great distances [27,70,71,76,79], and to whom the
barrier is thus not absolute. Heads [12] acknowledged
that many marine organisms can readily reach far outside
their established ranges, but argued that they do not establish themselves because of competition from congeneric
vicariants already established in such habitats. Likewise,
Briggs [80] suggested that competition may prevent the
colonization of high diversity habitats. The "competitive
exclusion principle" [81] is now considered to be controversial [82]. Although a number of recent experiments do
support the notion that high diversity may increase a community's invasion resistance [83-86], its effect may be difficult to discern from other factors such as predation,
inappropriate climate and disease [87]. Nonetheless, the
successful establishment of a founder population may be
inhibited to some degree by the presence of interspecific
competition [88-90], or facilitated by a lack of resource
competition (i.e. the existence of an "empty niche" [91]),
as the available resources allow the founders to rapidly
increase their numbers. This may explain why a) the lineage defined by node A (Fig. 2) is absent from the speciesrich West Pacific, despite the high dispersal potential of its
species and b) the colonization of West Africa and Hawai'i
(two regions with low seahorse diversity) was possible for
H. algiricus and H. fisheri, respectively. The European species H. guttulatus and the more recent arrival H. hippocampus are sympatric, but they do not compete directly
because of different microhabitat preferences [92]. The
establishment of human-introduced marine species in
new habitats is well documented [93-95], and it seems
unreasonable to reject the notion that such colonization
events may occur naturally, albeit at a lower rate. Both
vicariance and founder dispersal thus have to be considered plausible in marine organisms, and our study indicates that molecular dating is a useful tool to determine
when a divergence event is likely to have occurred and
what may have caused it.
Even if one does not consider genetic differentiation of
molecular markers to be at least roughly correlated with
time, one must nonetheless concede that the establishment of the same phylogeographic patterns in clades
nested within each other in the same phylogeny cannot
have occurred simultaneously. Hence, if the divergence of
H. guttulatus vs. H. zosterae, H. erectus and H. hippocampus
was the result of continental break-up and spreading of

Page 11 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:138

the Atlantic Ocean (vicariance), then the split between H.
erectus and H. hippocampus must have been caused by subsequent long-distance dispersal. This is further supported
by the fact that even if the unlikely upper limit of 8.5 mya
is specified for the closure of the Central American Seaway, the upper 95% confidence limit for the divergence of
H. erectus and H. hippocampus postdates even the most
recent estimate for the spreading of the Atlantic Ocean.
Likewise, if the Atlantic biome clade comprising the above
species and the basally Indo-Pacific clade comprising all
other species diverged as a result of Tethyan Seaway closure, then node A cannot define a western Tethyan lineage
that arose at the same time (again, the upper 95% confidence limit using the upper bound of 8.5 mya considerably postdates the most recent geological estimate for this
event). Furthermore, the fact that the basal split in the seahorse phylogeny into an Atlantic Ocean lineage and a
basally Indo-Pacific lineage predated all of the divergence
events resulting in amphi-Atlantic distribution patterns
(which could be interpreted as Tethyan Seaway closure
11.2 – 28.5 mya, and continental break-up 84 mya,
respectively) suggests that none of the amphi-Atlantic distribution patterns are the result of vicariance. As none of
the pairwise genetic distances between amphi-Atlantic sister lineages of other teleosts investigated were substantially greater than the distance between the two most
divergent pair of seahorse lineages, we conclude that these
did not diverge as a result of vicariance either. Our results
thus support other recent studies on Atlantic Ocean
marine organisms that identified long-distance dispersal
as the cause for the establishment of amphi-Atlantic sister
lineages [70,96-98].
The impression that vicariance hypotheses are increasingly being invoked to explain biogeographic patterns in
the sea [12] may to some extent have been created by the
increased use of molecular dating in genetic studies of
marine organisms, which relies on well-documented
vicariance events to use as calibration points. Founder dispersal events are less useful for this purpose, but we conclude that in the circumglobally distributed seahorse
lineage, divergence events that resulted from founder dispersal are likely to outnumber divergence events that
resulted from vicariance. We hypothesise that founder dispersal is thus of particular importance in species that disperse by means of rafting.

Methods
Taxon sampling and sequencing
The total sample used to reconstruct the phylogeny of the
monophyletic circumglobally distributed seahorse lineage (clade 4 in Teske et al. [53]) consisted of 26 individuals from 13 species (Table 3). We also included a single
individual each of species from the circumglobal clade's
three sister lineages (clades 1, 2 and 3 in Teske et al. [53])

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/138

as outgroup taxa. We attempted to obtain tissue material
from more than one specimen of each ingroup species to
account for intra-specific variation. This was considered
particularly important in the case of species with wide distribution ranges. The Hawai'ian seahorse that was previously referred to as Hippocampus hilonis [6] or H. fisheri
[53] is correctly referred to as H. fisheri in this study. Morphologically, this species resembles H. trimaculatus (a species closely related to the outgroup species H. comes),
suggesting that it is not part of the circumglobal clade and
that specimens that group genetically with H. ingens are
likely to be H. hilonis (a possible synonym of H. kuda, SA
Lourie, pers. comm.). We have now confirmed that our
Hawai'ian specimens are morphologically very different
from H. kuda and that they fit the descripton of H. fisheri
[62] well. All five genetic markers used in this study confirm that our specimens are the sister taxon of H. ingens,
that they are not part of the H. kuda complex, and that
they are genetically very different from H. trimaculatus
(Fig. 2). This suggests that the morphology of H. fisheri
was misleading.
For phylogenetic reconstruction and molecular dating, we
used sequence data of three mitochondrial markers (control region, cytochrome b gene and 16S rRNA) and one
nuclear marker (the first intron of the S7 ribosomal protein, herafter referred to as S7 intron). Sequences of a second nuclear marker, Aldolase, were used for phylogenetic
reconstructions only. Mitochondrial markers often fail to
resolve deeper relationships at the taxonomic levels of
family and order in various teleosts [99,100], but generally provide good resolution at and below the genus level
[101,102]. For that reason, they can be considered ideal to
study the phylogeny of the circumglobal seahorse clade
(one of five major genetic lineages comprising the genus
Hippocampus [53]). DNA extraction and amplification of
molecular markers followed previously described protocols [43,53,103].
A total of 61 new sequences were generated for this study
(GenBank accession numbers starting with DQ, Table 3).
These were complemented with 82 previously published
seahorse sequences (accession numbers starting with AF
and AY [6,43,52,53]). For phylogenetic reconstructions,
complete cytochrome b sequences generated by Casey et
al. [52] were used whenever available, which are 424 bp
longer than the partial cytochrome b sequences generated
in this study and in Lourie et al. [43]. Aldolase sequences
were obtained for a single individual of each species only.
As this marker was characterized by comparatively little
variation, it was not used for molecular dating.
Alignments and phylogenetic reconstructions
Sequence alignments were generated using BALI-PHY
[104]. This program estimates alignment and phylogeny

Sequences in boldface were used to reconstruct phylogenies. All sequences except those of Aldolase were used for molecular dating.
Cytochrome b sequences whose accession numbers start with AF are 423 bp longer than those starting with DQ and were used to reconstruct
phylogenies. Control region, cytochrome b and 16S rRNA are mitochondrial markers, S7 intron and Aldolase are nuclear markers. In some cases,
samples from two different localities were used to represent a particular species.

simultaneously in a Bayesian framework, and in this way
avoids the problems associated with poor guide trees in
the more widely used alignment program CLUSTALX
[105]. Confidence of the results is assessed using posterior
probabilites, and the indel model implemented allows
indels several characters in length and also allows these to
nest or overlap if they lie on separate branches. Three partitions were characterized by length differences (control
region, 16S rRNA and S7 intron). These were aligned individually because of computational constraints when
aligning combined data-sets. Prior to generating BAli-PHY
alignments, we explored which models of sequence evolution were most appropriate for each partition by generating CLUSTALX [105] alignments of ingroup sequences
using default settings, and then using the Akaike information criterion [106] as implemented in MODELTEST version 3.7 [107]. As all models selected were fairly complex,
we specified the most complex model presently implemented in BALI-PHY (the Tamura-Nei model [108]) for
simultaneous estimation of alignment and phylogeny. A
gamma distribution parameter and an assumed proportion of invariable sites were also specified if these were
selected as model components by MODELTEST. For each
partition aligned in BALI-PHY, 500 iterations were performed, and the final alignment was based on all alignments recovered excluding the burn-in. The procedure
was repeated five times to ensure consistency of results.
BALI-PHY's algorithm has very short burn-in times, and in
the case of our comparatively small data-sets, convergence
was complete by the tenth generation for all three partitions characterized by length differences. Maximum a posteriori alignments used for further analyses were thus
based on the remaining 490 iterations.
A single representative of each species was used for alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction, because exploratory alignments using the program CLUSTALX [105]
followed by phylogenetic reconstructions using the neighbour-joining method [109] revealed that the geographically distant representatives of each species were
monophyletic. An exception was made in the case of the
Indo-Pacific species Hippocampus kuda, which was represented by one individual from India (Indian Ocean lineage) and one individual from north Sulawesi, Indonesia
(West Pacific lineage). Control region sequences indicated
that these two lineages may not be monophyletic and
might be considered to be different species [6], a result
that was, however, not strongly supported. In addition to
14 specimens representing the ingroup, we also included
the three outgroup species H. breviceps, H. comes and H.
coronatus (representatives of clades 1, 2 and 3 in Teske et
al. [53]). As the alignment method was strongly influenced by the presence of missing data, a section of missing
data 50 bp in length in the S7 intron sequence of H. erectus
was temporarily replaced with corresponding characters

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/138

from its sister species H. hippocampus (the surrogate characters were removed for subsequent analyses). The sistertaxon relationship of the two species was strongly supported by previous studies [52,53].
The data matrix used for phylogenetic reconstructions
included the three partitions aligned using BALI-PHY, as
well as three additional partitions. Firstly, complete cytochrome b sequences were used, whenever available
(resulting in 424 bp of missing data in H. fisheri and H.
fuscus). Secondly, indels in the three partitions that were
characterized by length differences were coded as presence/absence characters in some analyses if they were
present in more than one species, had a length of more
than one nucleotide, and had clearly defined alignment
boundaries. Thirdly, Aldolase sequences [53] were
included (Table 3). These contained only two indels, each
of them one nucleotide in length, and were aligned by
eye. The aligned sequence lengths of control region, 16S
rRNA and S7 intron were 389, 532 and 596 nucleotides in
length, respectively. Eight indels were coded as presence/
absence data, and cytochrome b and Aldolase sequences
were 1140 and 188 nucleotides in length, respectively,
resulting in a total sequence length of 2853 characters.
This data matrix (excluding the partition comprising
indels) was used to recover a maximum likelihood tree by
generating 200 iterations of the 'likelihood ratchet' [110],
which is a model-based procedure analogous to the parsimony ratchet [111]. Tree searches that employ ratcheting
are less likely to become stuck on suboptimal tree islands
than any other method of phylogenetic reconstruction
presently available. Runs were repeated five times to
ensure that the tree space was adequately explored, as
indicated by the tree topology with the highest likelihood
score being consistently recovered. Nodal support for this
tree was obtained by means of bootstrap resampling
(1000 replicates) using maximum likelihood in PAUP*
version 4.0b10 [112], with a single most appropriate
model being specified for the whole data-set as determined using the Akaike Information Criterion in MODELTEST. The heuristic search was limited to a maximum of
10 000 saved trees. Secondly, we used the heuristic parsimony analysis in PAUP* to recover the most parsimonious tree using the same data-set and including indels as
presence/absence characters. Default parameters were
specified, with 100 random addition replicates and 1000
trees retained at each step. Nodal support for this topology was obtained by means of jackknifing (100 000 replicates, 50% deletion) using default parameters in PAUP*.
Thirdly, MRBAYES version 3.1 [113] was used to determine posterior probabilities for each node. The Markov
chain Monte Carlo process was set for four chains to run
simultaneously for 2 000 000 generations, with trees
being sampled every 100 generations. In addition to

Page 14 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:138

examining posterior probabilities of the resulting trees to
determine when burn-in was complete, we also compared
standard errors of posterior probabilities between simultaneous runs. As these tended to decrease for some time
after the burn-in phase, only trees were used once the difference in standard errors had also stabilized (i.e. the first
4 000 out of a total of 20 000 trees were exluded). Bayesian analyses were repeated three times to ensure that
chains had converged. We specified unique model priors
for each partition as determined using MRMODELTEST
version 2.2 [114]. An exception were the 16S rRNA
sequences, which were aligned to the secondary structure
model of the teleost Pygocentrus nattereri [115] to identify
stem and loop regions, and the doublet model was
invoked for complementary stem regions. Model priors
from MRMODELTEST were, however, specified for stem
regions for which no complementary regions were available for our partial 16S rRNA sequences, as well as for loop
regions.
Molecular dating
We compared genetic divergence between seahorse lineages whose distribution patterns may have arisen as a
result of the closures of the Central American, Tethyan or
Indonesian seaways, or spreading of the Atlantic Ocean,
with those of various other teleost lineages having the
same distribution patterns. Following previous studies
that estimated genetic distances of transisthmian sister
species [22,23], we calculated genetic distances under the
Kimura 2-Parameter (K2P) model [116]. As cytochrome b
and 16S rRNA sequences are most frequently used for
phylogenetic reconstructions in teleosts, we limited our
comparisons to these two markers.

To ensure that evolutionary rates between seahorses and
other teleosts were not significantly different, we applied
the relative rate test implemented in RRTREE [117]. This
test takes into account phylogenetic relationships and corrects for sampling imbalances. All relative rate tests were
carried out in a pairwise fashion by comparing rates in the
seahorse phylogeny with rates in one of the other teleost
lineages. As outgroup for each pairwise comparison, we
used the bonefish Albula, as this was the only non-percomorph teleost genus investigated. In the case of cytochrome b, tests were performed separately for
synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions by computing the parameters B4 (number of synonymous transversions per fourfold degenerate site) and Ka (number of
non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous
site), whereas the K2P substitution model was applied to
the 16S rRNA data (using BALI-PHY alignments of seahorses and other teleosts that were generated as described
previously). For comparison, we also plotted pairwise distances of lineages of seahorses and other teleosts that may
have arisen as a result of the closures of the Indonesian

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/138

and Tethyan seaways, as well as continental break-up followed by spreading of the Atlantic Ocean, by virtue of
their present-day distribution patterns. Lineages characterized by different evolutionary rates than the seahorses,
as well as lineages that were not tested either because different positions of a particular molecular marker were
used or because they were used as outgroup for the relative rate test were also plotted for comparison, but were
not considered in the analyses.
To date nodes in the seahorse phylogeny, we explored
whether rate differences were present among species using
RRTREE. The same three species that comprised the outgroup in phylogenetic reconstructions were also used as
reference taxa in these analyses. Significant rate differences were identified in the case of three of the partitions
(16S rRNA, control region and S7 intron), which
prompted us to estimate the ages of divergence events
among different seahorse lineages by means of the Bayesian relaxed clock method for multiple genes implemented in the programmes ESTBRANCHES and
MULTIDIVTIME [58]. The maximum likelihood tree
topology was specified, and to incorporate within-species
differences, we included all specimens available for each
species and specified phylogenetic relationships among
these as unresolved polytomies. Again, the three species
Hippocampus breviceps, H. coronatus and H. comes were used
as outgroup taxa. MULTIDIVTIME was used to estimate
the ages of divergence events and their 95% confidence
intervals. The Markov chain was sampled 50 000 times,
with 100 cycles between each sample and a burn-in of 50
000 cycles. The process was then repeated by sampling
100 000 times and specifying a burn-in of 100 000 cycles.
Differences in the results of these two runs would indicate
that the program has not been run for sufficiently long for
Markov chains to converge. This was found not to be the
case (divergence time estimates differed by no more than
0.0005).
Settings of the parameters rttm, rtrate, brownian and big
time followed suggestions in the MULTIDIVTIME manual.
The prior expected number of time units between tip and
root (rttm) was set to 22 mya (Early Miocene), as this date
was between the most recent (Middle Miocene) and oldest (Late Oligocene) divergence times specified for the
root node. As the value for rttm should be between 0.1 and
10, we set it to 2.2. All subsequent values expressing time
in million years were also multiplied by 0.1.
The mean of the prior distribution for the rate at the root
node (rtrate) was estimated by dividing the median of all
branch lengths from root to ingroup tips by rrtm. A value
of 0.7 was specified for brownian, as brownian multiplied
by rttm should be between 1 and 2 (2.2 × 0.7 = 1.5). The
highest possible number of time units between tip and

Page 15 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:138

root (big time) was set to 50 (i.e. 500 million years). The
magnitude of standard errors was set equal to that of each
of the parameters rttm, rtrate and brownian. We examined
the effect of the choice of parameter priors on divergence
time estimates by doubling all of them. The fact that time
estimates obtained in this way differed by no more than
0.1 (1 million years; mean difference: 0.03 or 300 000
years) suggests that the choice of priors had little effect on
time estimates.

Molecular dating was done in two ways. Firstly, to date
divergence events that may have resulted from vicariance
events, we specified only the well-documented closure of
the Central American Seaway as a calibration point and
specified three alternative calibration ranges for the timing of this event: a) 3.1 – 3.5 mya [19], i.e. assuming that
the divergence of the transisthmian seahorse lineages took
place during the final closure of the seaway; b) 3.1 – 4.6
mya, with the upper limit representing the onset of a
marked reorganization of ocean circulation in Central
America that was associated with the rising of the Isthmus
of Panama [35], and c) 3.1 – 8.5 mya, to account for the
possibility that seahorses were affected by the earliest possible evolution associated with the closure of the seaway
[26]. Secondly, we dated all nodes in the phylogeny by
using a well-supported divergence range of the transisthmian seahorse lineages in combination with other divergence events whose divergence time estimates matched
the timing of vicariance events suggested in the literature
in the first analysis.
