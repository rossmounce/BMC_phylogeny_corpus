Abstract
Background: The New World monkey (Platyrrhini) subfamily Pitheciinae is represented by the genera Pithecia,
Chiropotes and Cacajao. In this work we studied the karyotypes of Pithecia irrorata (2n = 48) and Cacajao calvus
rubicundus (2n = 45 in males and 2n = 46 in females) by G- and C-banding, NOR staining and chromosome painting
using human and Saguinus oedipus whole chromosome probes. The karyotypes of both species were compared with
each other and with Chiropotes utahicki (2n = 54) from the literature.
Results: Our results show that members of the Pitheciinae have conserved several chromosome forms found in the
inferred ancestral Platyrrhini karyotype (associations of human homologous segments 3a/21, 5/7a, 2b/16b, 8a/18, 14/
15a and 10a/16a). Further, the monophyly of this subfamily is supported by three chromosomal synapomorphies (2a/
10b, an acrocentric 15/14 and an acrocentric human 19 homolog). In addition, each species presents several
autapomorphies. From this data set we established a chromosomal phylogeny of Pitheciinae, resulting in a single most
parsimonious tree.
Conclusions: In our chromosomal phylogeny, the genus Pithecia occurred in a more basal position close to the
inferred ancestor of Platyrrhini, while C. c. rubicundus and C. utahicki are closely related and are linked by exclusive
synapomorphies.
Background
The subfamily Pitheciinae includes the genera Pithecia
Desmarest, 1804, Chiropotes and Cacajao Lesson, 1840.
Pithecia comprises five species: Pithecia pithecia, Pithecia monachus, Pithecia irrorata (each two subspecies),
Pithecia albicans and Pithecia aequatorialis (both monotypic) [1]. Chiropotes is represented by the two species
Chiropotes albinasus (monotypic) and Chiropotes satanas
(three subspecies) [2], and Cacajao by Cacajao calvus
(four subspecies) and Cacajao melanocephalus (two subspecies) [3]. The geographic distribution of this subfamily
is restricted to the Amazon region. Recent morphological, karyotypic and molecular data pointed to a new species for Chiropotes, C. israelita, and indicated that the
subspecies Chiropotes satanas utahicki should be

accepted as a full species [4]. The majority of the Pitheciinae species are listed as endangered (http://www.cites
.org).
It is accepted that the Pitheciinae represent a monophyletic clade [4-7]. Several studies using morphological
[5-7], molecular [8,9] and cytogenetic [10] traits suggest
that Chiropotes and Cacajao are sister taxa and place
Pithecia most basal within this clade. It was further suggested that the Pitheciinae are a sister group of Aotus and
Callicebus [5], while more recent molecular phylogenetic
analyses supported an association of Pitheciinae and Callicebus, but associate Aotus with Callitrichidae [8,11-14].
To date, cytogenetic studies of members from this subfamily are still rare. The karyotypes of C. albinasus, P.
monachus, P. aequatorialis and P. albicans have not yet
been described so far, while for others, for example for C.
melanocephalus, only the diploid chromosome number
was published [15]. Moura-Pensin et al. [10] were the first

including Pithecia irrorata, Chiropotes satanas chiropotes, Chiropotes satanas utahicki and Cacajao calvus rubicundus. Cacajao shows the lowest diploid chromosome
number among Pitheciinae with 2n = 46 in females and
45 in males [10,15-17]. Pithecia has 2n = 48 chromosomes [18], and Chiropotes has the highest diploid number with 2n = 54 [10,19]. Only Chiropotes utahicki and C.

using human whole chromosome probes [19]. Stanyon et
al. [19] showed that Chiropotes retained all human
homologous syntenic associations proposed for the
ancestral Platyrrhini karyotype, but also include several
derived chromosome forms that are exclusive to this
genus.

With the aim to establish detailed chromosomal phylogenies of the three genera of Pitheciinae, we studied the
karyotypes of the species Pithecia irrorata and Cacajao
calvus rubicundus using both classic cytogenetics and
chromosome painting with human and Saguinus oedipus
whole chromosome probes.

Methods
Chromosome preparations were obtained from whole
blood cultures of one female and two male Pithecia irrorata (PIR) individuals kept at the Parque Zoobotânico
Gavião Real, Capitão Poço, Para, Brazil, of two females
from the Centro Nacional de Primatas, Ananindeua,
Para, Brazil, and of a male and a female Cacajao calvus
rubicundus (CCR) individual kept at the Centro de Primatologia do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
G-banding, using Wright stain [20], C-banding [21] and
NOR-staining [22], followed standard procedures. FISH
experiments using human whole chromosome paint
probes 1-22, X and Y, and S. oedipus paint probes (22
autosomes, X and Y) were performed as previously
described [23-25]. While both human probes were
hybridized for CCR and PIR, only PIR is queried with
SOE paints. Paint probes were labeled by DOP-PCR [26]
using Biotin-dUTP, Digoxigenin-dUTP (Roche) and
TAMRA-dUTP (Biosystems/PE Applied). After classical
staining, metaphases were photographed using a Zeiss III
microscope with Kodak Imagelink HQ film. FISH/DAPI

patterns in the Pitheciinae species included in our study
and from the literature [19]. Brachyteles arachnoides [24]
and Cebus apella [25] were used as outgroups. We attributed "0" (zero) value to the absence of a character (an
association or a syntenic group that is conserved or
changed by chromosome rearrangements) and "1" (one)
value to the presence of the character. These data were
subjected to maximum parsimony analysis (PAUP 4.0
software; Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony), using
the exhaustive search option. The relative stability of
nodes was assessed by bootstrap estimates.

some is a medium sized acrocentric, corresponding to the
original homologue of the autosome translocated to the Y
chromosome. Constitutive heterochromatin (Figure 2B)
was observed in centromeric regions of all autosomes. In
addition, secondary C-bands were observed on pairs 1, 2
and 3, in the distal regions of chromosome pairs 4p, 5p,
6p and 4q and proximally on chromosome pair 15q.
NOR-staining was found in the proximal region of the
long arm of six acrocentric chromosomes both on P. irrorata (Figure 3A) and C. c. rubicundus (Figure 3B).

Results

The homology map between human (HSA) and P. irrorata was established using chromosome paint probes
(Figure 1A). Human probes showed 32 hybridization signals per haploid chromosome set (Figure 4A; Table 1).
Fourteen autosomes and the X showed conserved synteny. From these, eight autosomes hybridized an entire P.
irrorata chromosome (HSA 4, 6, 9, 11, 12, 17, 19, 20) and
six were found associated with other chromosomes (HSA
5, 13, 14, 18, 21, 22). The remaining eight human autosome probes produced multiple signals in different chromosomes of P. irrorata. HSA 2, 7, 8, 10, 15, and 16 each
hybridized two chromosomes, while HSA 1 and 3 each
produced signals on three chromosomes per haploid set.
Six chromosomes of P. irrorata correspond to the human
syntenic associations 5/7, 2/16, 10/16, 8/18, 15/14 and 3/

Classical cytogenetics

P. irrorata has 2n = 48 chromosomes, with nine metacentric or submetacentric and 14 acrocentric autosome
pairs. The X chromosome is a medium sized submetacentric. The G-banded karyotype is shown in the Figure
1A. C-banding highlighted constitutive heterochromatin
in the centromeres of all chromosomes and an interstitial
band in the long arm of pair 18 (Figure 1B).
C. c. rubicundus has 2n = 45 chromosomes in males
and 2n = 46 in females as a result of a Y-autosomal translocation, causing a multiple sex chromosome system
X1X2Y (Figure 2A). The autosomal set is composed by
nine meta- or submetacentric and 13 acrocentric pairs.
The X1 chromosome is a medium sized submetacentric,
homologous to the X of other primates. The X2 chromo-

Cacajao calvus rubicundus

Hybridizations of human paint probes resulted in 33
FISH-signals per haploid set of C. c. rubicundus (Figure
4B; Table 1). Thirteen human autosomes and the X
showed conserved synteny. From these, HSA 4, 6, 9, 11,
13, 17, 19 and 22 probes hybridized onto a whole chromosome and HSA 12, 14, 18, 20, 21 were found in syntenic association. The remaining nine probes produced
multiple signals in different chromosomes of C. c. rubicundus. HSA 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 15, and 16 paints each hybridized two chromosomes, whereas HSA 1 and 3 probes
each hybridized three chromosomes. Nine chromosomes
of C. c. rubicundus presented the syntenic associations 1/
12, 2/10, 2/16, 3/20/15/14, 3/5, 3/21, 5/7, 8/18 and 10/16.
Human chromosome 11 was identified as the autosome
involved in the Y-autosome translocation. Figure 2A summarizes the mapping of human chromosomes to the Gbanded karyotype of C. c. rubicundus.

Hybridizations of S. oedipus (SOE) probes showed 28
signals per haploid chromosome set of C. c. rubicundus
(Figure 4C; Table 1). SOE autosome 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14,
15, 16, 18 and 20 probes each hybridized an entire chromosome and SOE 11, 12, 17, 19, 21 and 22 were found
conserved but in association with other chromosomes.
The remaining four probes each produced multiple signals in different chromosomes of C. c. rubicundus. SOE 6
and 9 hybridized onto two chromosomes and SOE 1 and
2 three chromosomes each per haploid set, respectively.
Five chromosomes of C. c. rubicundus correspond to the
syntenic associations 19/2/11, 17/6, 21/12, 22/9 and 2/1.
The Y-autosome translocation involved the SOE 14
homologue. Figure 2A gives an overview of the mapping
of the SOE chromosome probes to the G-banded karyotype of C. c. rubicundus.

banding and FISH with human whole chromosome
probes is summarized in Figure 5. The results showed
that the chromosomal differences found among the three
taxa are consequence of centric fusions and fissions, pericentric and paracentric inversions, tandem fusions and a
Y-autosome translocation (Table 2).
These data were translated into a binary matrix (Additional file 1) and were then subjected to parsimony analysis. A single most parsimonious three was obtained
(Figure 6) comprising 45 steps with a consistency index of
0.978, a retention index 0.909 and a homoplasy index of
0.022.

Discussion
The G-, C-banding and NOR-staining results on P. irrorata and C. c. rubicundus obtained in this study are in
agreement with previously published data [10], including
the difference in the diploid number for males and
females in C. c. rubicundus [10,15-17].
Our results by chromosome painting in P. irrorata and
C. c. rubicundus, as well as those from C. utahicki [19],
demonstrated that these species conserved all human
homologous syntenic associations found in the inferred
ancestral New World primate karyotype (3a/21, 5/7a, 2b/
16b, 8a/18, 14/15a and 10a/16a) [27]. The morphology
and banding pattern of the 3a/21 homologues in C. c.
rubicundus and C. utahicki is similar to the ancestral
Platyrrhini type, while in P. irrorata it was modified by a

paracentric inversion. The biarmed chromosome form 5/
7a found in P. irrorata is also similar to the ancestral
Platyrrhini type, whereas in C. c. rubicundus and C. utahicki this association is found on a presumably derived
acrocentric chromosome. Cacajao further shows human
chromosome 5 homologues fissioned into 5a1 and 5a2. A
similar fission was previously found in Atelinae [24],
however, involving different break points. Therefore,
these fissions represent no synapomorphy, but rather
occurred independently in the two clades. Chromosome
forms 2b/16b and 8a/18 each showed similar morphology
compared to homologues from other Platyrrhini and are
therefore considered ancestral traits. The association 14/
15a was observed in an acrocentric chromosome in P.
irrorata, while in C. utahicki it has fused with chromosome 20 forming the association 20/15/14 on chromosome 1. In C. c. rubicundus it was found fused with the
human 3/20 homolog, leading to the association 3/20/15/
14. Finally, a pericentric inversion was observed for chromosome form 10a/16a in all species analyzed here, resulting in chromosome form 16a/10a/16a/10a. This derived
inversion has also been found previously in Callicebus
[28], indicating that Pithecia, Chiropotes and Cacajao are
sister groups of Callicebus. This observation is in agreement with recent classifications based on molecular data,
supporting the classification of subfamilies Pitheciinae
and Atelinae as sister groups included in the family Atelidae [8,12].

A comparative chromosome analysis of the three Pitheciinae species shows further synapomorphies shared
between C. c. rubicundus and C. utahicki (fission of 5/7,
resulting in separate 5a1 and 5a2 segments, and fusion
20/15/14), shared between P. irrorata and C. c. rubicundus (acrocentric 7b, acrocentric 12) and for Pitheciinae in
general (fusion 2a/10b, acrocentric 15/14 and acrocentric
19). In contrast, no derived chromosome forms shared
between P. irrorata and C. utahicki were found.
Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that P. irrorata, C. c.
rubicundus and C. utahicki are a monophyletic group.
Further, and as expected, the chromosomal data supported by exclusive synapomorphies demonstrates that
C. c. rubicundus and C. utahicki are sister taxa. Moreover,
P. irrorata was placed in a more basal position, having
retained a karyotype closer to that of the inferred ancestral Platyrrhini. This phylogenetic arrangement supports
previously published phylogenies [5-8,12], and also the
phenetic inferences [10].

Conclusions
In conclusion, this comparative chromosomal analysis
clarifies some intrageneric relationships within Pitheciinae, while the position of this group in relation to Callicebus and Aotus remained undefined. Additional
comparative high-resolution molecular cytogenetic studies will be necessary to precisely define the rearrangements between Aotus and Callicebus to clarify their
phylogenetic relationships with Pitheciinae.
