Abstract
Background: The mycobacterial genome is inclined to polymerase slippage and a high mutation rate in
microsatellite regions due to high GC content and absence of a mismatch repair system. However, the exact
molecular mechanisms underlying microsatellite variation have not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated
mutation events in the hyper-variable trinucleotide microsatellite locus MML0050 located in the Rv0050 gene of WBeijing and non-W-Beijing Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in order to gain insight into the genomic structure
and activity of repeated regions.
Results: Size analysis indicated the presence of five alleles that differed in length by three base pairs. Moreover,
nucleotide gains occurred more frequently than loses in this trinucleotide microsatellite. Mutation frequency was
not completely related with the total length, though the relative frequency in the longest allele was remarkably
higher than that in the shortest. Sequence analysis was able to detect seven alleles and revealed that point
mutations enhanced the level of locus variation. Introduction of an interruptive motif correlated with the total
allele length and genetic lineage, rather than the length of the longest stretch of perfect repeats. Finally, the level
of locus variation was drastically different between the two genetic lineages.
Conclusion: The Rv0050 locus encodes the bifunctional penicillin-binding protein ponA1 and is essential to
mycobacterial survival. Our investigations of this particularly dynamic genomic region provide insights into the
overall mode of microsatellite evolution. Specifically, replication slippage was implicated in the mutational process
of this microsatellite and a sequence-based genetic analysis was necessary to determine that point mutation
events acted to maintain microsatellite size integrity while providing genomic diversity.

Background
Simple sequence repeats (SSRs, also known as microsatellites) are repetitive sequence motifs of one to six base
pairs (bps) scattered throughout all known genomes [1].
The extensive length differences that may be achieved
by microsatellites and their high rate of polymorphism
have facilitated their use as molecular markers in epidemiological investigations. However, knowledge is lacking
about the mutational mechanism(s) that lead to variations in microsatellite loci.

Gaining a detailed understanding of the features
underlying microsatellite genomic structure will aid subsequent interpretations of data from these clinically useful genomic regions. Strand slippage during DNA
replication can cause insertion and deletion of repeat
units in newly-synthesized nucleotide chains. These
events are the most common cause of expansion or contraction of microsatellites [2,3]. Recent studies have
reported differences in rates and patterns of mutation
among distinct loci and species; thus, allele size, motif
size, genetic lineage, G/C content, functional potential
of the transcribed product, and effectiveness of mismatch repair enzymes might all act as mediators of the
mutation patterns of such loci [4-7].

Although several models have been proposed to
explain the mutation processes that effect microsatellite
evolution, they have yet to be confirmed [6]. Studies
into genomic evolution exploit the hyper-variable nature
of microsatellite sequences to observe mutation events
directly [8]. Specifically, pedigree analysis has provided
substantial amounts of mutation data for broad ranges
of chromosomal loci and organisms [8-10]. However,
most of these studies on microsatellites have focused on
size variation among alleles, and have not addressed
potential sequence variations within otherwise similarly
sized alleles.
Sequence analysis is an alternative empirical approach
for studying microsatellite evolution. Elucidating the
sequence structure of alleles allows for direct comparison with other alleles within a single species or with
orthologous loci from different species, effectively allowing for the study of accumulated mutational effects over
evolutionary timescales. Intraspecific comparisons that
reveal the sequence structure of individual alleles may
provide significant insights into the otherwise complex
process of maintaining genomic integrity under selective
pressure.
Mycobacterial genomes harbor a number of polymorphic microsatellites [11]. Microsatellites in these
genomes impart a certain degree of genome plasticity
and probably account for many biological functions in
the context of pathogen adaptability, virulence and survival [12]. Usually, errors resulting from strand slippage
are promptly repaired by a three-enzyme system composed of mutL, mutS, and mutH; however, mycobacterial genomes lack these enzymes [13]. Thus, such
genomes serve as interesting systems to investigate the
rates of mutations in microsatellites and the existence of
regulatory mechanisms that govern microsatellite
mutations.
The repetitive CCG sequence located in the Rv0050
gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a trinucleotide microsatellite locus (MML0050) that exhibits
high a polymorphism rate. The Rv0050 locus encodes a
bifunctional penicillin-binding protein (ponA1) [14,15].
The hyper-variable locus has gained popularity as a
Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) biomarker in
epidemiological investigations of MTB strains [16].
However, the mutational mechanisms that are responsible for generating the high levels of variation in the
MML0050 locus remain unclear.
In this study, we sought to explain the mutation
tempo and mode of the MML0050 locus and its polymorphic nature using clinical isolates from two MTB
genotypes: W-Beijing and non-W-Beijing. W-Beijing
strains are genetically closely related, present with a
characteristic spoligotype pattern, and have enjoyed
wide global dispersion [17-19]. They account for 80-90%

of the MTB strains isolated from the Beijing area since
the 1950s and remain prevalent in other parts of China,
including the Ningxia, Shanghai, and Guangdong provinces [20]. Such strains have attracted much research
interest due to their reported association with multiple
drug resistance, relapses, treatment failure, hypervirulent
phenotype in mice, and faster growth rates in human
monocytes [21-25]. We sequenced a set of MML0050
locus alleles of different size classes from different MTB
families to analyze the stabilizing effect of interrupting
motifs in microsatellite regions, the effect of allele
length, genetic lineage for the introduction of interruptive motif, and the relation between number of repeat
units and mutation frequency.

Methods
Sampling and DNA extraction

The MTB reference strain H37Rv was studied along
with 461 clinical strains that had been isolated between
July 2009 and April 2010 from regions of Eastern China,
including Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Fujian,
Anhui, and Jiangxi (collected by Laboratory of Tuberculosis, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Medical School,
Tongji University, Shanghai, China).
Strains were grown in Sauton culture medium (0.5 g/L
KH2PO4, 0.5 g/L MgSO4.7H2O, 2 g/L citric acid, 0.05 g/
L ferric ammonium citrate, 4.0 g/L L-asparagine, 6% glycerol and 0.02% Tween 80). Cells were sterilized at 80°C
for 30 min, and were harvested by centrifugation
(12,000 × g for 5 min). The bacterial pellet was washed
three times with sterilized saline and re-collected by
centrifugation (12,000 × g for 10 min each time). DNA
Lysis Buffer (10 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mg/mL SDS, 15% Chelex-100, 1% Tween 20) was added and cells were incubated at 50°C for 1 h, followed by 100°C for 10 min.
The mixture was centrifuged (5,000 × g for 10 min) to
obtain the aqueous phase containing genomic DNA that
was used for PCR amplification.
Identification of W-Beijing strains

W-Beijing strains were identified by deletion-targeted
multiplex PCR (DTM-PCR) to detect the genomic deletion RD105, which defines the W-Beijing family as a
separate lineage within MTB [26-28]. The DTM-PCR
primers P1 (5’-GGAGTCGTTGAGGGTGTTCATCAGCTCAGTC-3’) and P2 (5’-CGCCAAGGCCGCATAGTCACGGTCG-3’) were designed to amplify a 1466
bp product from the non-W-Beijing strains, while P1
and P3 (5’- GGTTGCCCACTGGTCGATATGGTGGACTT-3’) were designed to amplify a 761 bp fragment
from the W-Beijing genotype. PCR was performed in a
20 μL reaction mixture containing 2× Long Taq mixture
(Tiangen, Co., Beijing, China), 0.2 μM of each primer
and 10 ng of template DNA, under the following

conditions: denaturation at 94°C for 5 min; 30 amplification cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 68°C for 30 s and 72°C for 2
min; and a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. PCR products were separated on 0.8% agarose gels.
Microsatellite typing

To detect polymorphisms within the MML0050 locus,
PCR primer pairs were designed for the flanking
sequences: HponAF (5’-TTGAAGGGCACGTCGAACGAG-3’) and HponAR (5’-GGGACCGATCGGGATGGTAA-3’).
PCR was performed in a 20 μL reaction mixture containing 2× Taq mixture (Tiangen), 0.2 μM of each primer and 10 ng of template DNA, under the following
conditions: denaturation at 94°C for 5 min; 35 amplification cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 65°C for 30 s and 72°C for 2
min; and a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. PCR products were analyzed by the PCR-Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) technique to detect point
mutations; briefly, DNA was separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel, visualized by silver staining, excised and
sequenced on an ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer (procedure
carried out by Sangon, Shanghai, China).
GraphPad Prism 5.0 statistical software package
(http://www.graphpad.com/prism/prism.htm) was used
to analyze differences in allele distributions detected
among the W-Beijing and non-W-Beijing genotypes.
The character of bias was analyzed by Student’s t-test
with statistical confidence limit of 95%. Allele sequences
were compared to sequences previously deposited in the
GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
BLAST/). Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the
neighbor-joining method using MEGA 4.0 software to
ascertain the evolutionary distance of the locus mutation
rates [29].

Results and Discussion
MML0050 microsatellite features revealed by fragment
length analysis

The results from fragment length analysis indicated that
the MML0050 locus in 462 strains comprised five alleles
(Figure 1); this finding is consistent with molecular marker results reported by others [16]. The detected mutations involved gains or losses of either three, six, or nine
bps. These trinucleotide units are equivalent to one,
two, or three repeats, respectively, suggesting that replication slippage is associated with the mutation events.
The distribution of alleles among the 461 clinical strains
was evaluated next. Only three strains (0.65%) had contracting mutations, while 428 (92.8%) strains had
expanding mutations; the remaining 30 strains presented
with allele size identical to the H37Rv reference strain
(Figure 1). Further analysis indicated that the relative
frequency of alleles with -1, 0, +1, +2 and +3 change

repeats were 0.65% (3/461), 6.5% (30/461), 4.55% (21/
461), 0.65% (3/461), and 87.6% (404/461), respectively.
The relative frequency of alleles with +2 change repeats
(0.65%) was remarkably lower than alleles with the highest repeat numbers (87.6%), and even lower than alleles
with 0 (6.5%) or +1 change repeats (4.55%). It appears
that the mutation frequency of alleles did not correlate
perfectly with an increasing number of repeat units (P =
0.0057, 95% CI: 0.2987 to 1.1300, t = 4.205). Thus, this
finding suggests that repeat length is not the sole or primary mediator of mutational events in this MTB
microsatellite.
Of the 461 clinical strains examined, 56 were defined
as non-W-Beijing, similar to the H37Rv reference strain.
The remaining 405 clinical isolates were defined as WBeijing; finding that the majority (87.7%) of our samples
were of this genotype was not surprising since W-Beijing is highly prevalent in Eastern China [21]. When
allele size was examined (W-Beijing vs. non-W-Beijing)
the comparison revealed that the levels of the locus variation were significantly different between the two
groups (P < 0.0001, 95% CI: 2.2515 to 2.6818, t =
22.939; Figure 2). We found that 55 of the non-W-Beijing strains contained five alleles with -1, 0, +1, or +2
change repeats, while all of the W-Beijing strains contained 2 alleles with +2 or +3 change repeats. Moreover,
in the W-Beijing group, nearly all samples (> 99%) harbored the allele with the highest repeat numbers. As
such, this locus was determined to not represent a good
molecular marker for epidemiological investigations of
the W-Beijing genotype; it may still be a useful VNTR
marker for other MTB strains, however, due to its high
rate of polymorphism [16].

MML0050 microsatellite features revealed by sequence
analyses

We selected 132 strains for sequence analysis using the
HponAF and HponAR primers. This group included 58
strains with -1, 0, +1, or +2 change repeats, and 71
strains randomly selected from among the 404 strains
with +3 change repeats. Seven alleles at the MML0050
locus were identified by sequence analysis: Rv0050*01,
Rv0050*02, Rv0050*03, Rv0050*04, Rv0050*05,
Rv0050*06, and Rv0050*07 (Table 1). Comparison of the
allele sequences to those in the GenBank database
revealed that all, except Rv0050*05, matched to the M.
tuberculosis complex (MTC) strains. The MTC group is
comprised of Mycobacterium species targeting a broad
range of hosts but having highly conserved sequences,
including M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. bovis Bacillus
Calmette-Guérin (BCG), M. africanum, and M. microti.

Variations in the genome may occur by other modes
besides insertion/deletion. Nucleotide substitutions, such
as transitions (A®G) or transversions (G®T), may alter
the genome and its function without affecting the structure itself. Sequence analysis revealed that the
Rv0050*01 allele was composed of seven perfect CCG
repeats from the MTB reference strains H37Rv. All
alleles from the clinical strains had C®T substitutions
in the last repeat motif. Rv0050*07 was composed of 10
repeat units and had the largest fragment size; moreover, this allele had G®T substitutions in the fifth
repeat motif, which interrupted the CCG consecutive
repeat.
Microsatellite alleles can generally be divided into two
types: alleles that are identical in both length and
sequence and those identical in length but not in
sequence, the latter being known as homoplastic microsatellite alleles. Rv0050*05 and Rv0050*06 had been
determined by fragment length analyses to be identical
in length (both having nine repeat units) but sequence
analysis revealed significant differences in the underlying
genomic sequences. Rv0050*05 had a perfect repeat with
eight CCG units, while Rv0050*06 had a G®T substitution in the fourth repeat motif and the same mutation
pattern of Rv0050*07. Overall, only 7.4% of the
MML0050 mutations detected in our samples resulted
in homoplastic character.
A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the seven
MML0050 alleles to determine evolutionary distance of
the sequences (Figure 3). MML0050 alleles clustered
into two major groups according to genotype: non-WBeijing (Rv0050*01, Rv0050*02, Rv0050*03, Rv0050*04,
and Rv0050*05) and W-Beijing (Rv0050*06 and
Rv0050*07). The non-W-Beijing genotype group was
further divided among three subtypes: Rv0050*01 and
Rv0050*02, Rv0050*03, and Rv0050*04 and Rv0050*05.
Although the Rv0050*05 and Rv0050*06 were identical
in length, they were assigned to different clusters
according to the point mutation sequence differences
(Figure 2). Our finding of such homoplastic alleles was

directly facilitated by the use of a nucleotide sequencebased genetic technique; genetic approaches lacking
sequence data may hide polymorphisms, such as those
from point mutation, and negatively impact the usefulness of this genetic marker in population genetics studies. Polymorphism of molecular markers should be
calculated not only based on size variations but also the
sequence difference.
We also analyzed the relation between number of
interruptive motifs and (1) the total length of allele or
(2) genetic lineage. The Rv0050*06 allele from W-Beijing
genotype with nine repeat motifs was determined to be
the point of introduction of a second interruptive motif.
In contrast, the Rv0050*05 allele belonging to the nonW-Beijing genotype had a perfect nine repeat. Alleles
from the non-W-Beijing genotype had a greater amount
of perfect repeat motifs than did those from the W-Beijing genotype. Introduction of an interruptive motif had
the strongest statistical correlations with the total length
of allele and genetic lineage (P < 0.0001, 95% CI: 6.482
to 8.946, t = 13.64). Surprisingly, the length of the longest stretch of perfectly repeated units was not associated
with any interruptive motif, suggesting the existence of
a threshold level for the maximum length of perfectly
repeated trinucleotide motifs in stable MML0050 alleles.
In addition, this finding suggests that genetic lineage
and point mutation may be moderators of mutational
events in those alleles with nine repeat motifs.

gaining or losing a motif until the repeat number
reached as high as nine, at which point a G®T point
mutation occurred to break long repeat arrays into
smaller units (Figure 4). Directionality in the mutation
process in favor of gains over losses has been observed
in many eukaryotic genomes [7,30], while mutations
from prokaryotic genomes show the opposite bias
towards losses [30]. Our data on the MML0050 locus
demonstrated that sequence gains (expansion) were
much more prevalent than loses (contractions). The
MML0050 allele sizes in individual isolates were very
similar and often only differed by three base pairs, indicating that replication slippage is a likely mechanism
underlying size-related polymorphisms in the MML0050
locus.
Undoubtedly, the high GC content (65.6% in MTB)
[31] and absence of mismatch repair system (MMR)
make the mycobacterial genome prone to polymerase
slippage [13] and lead to a high mutation rate in simple
sequence repeats [32]. However, the hyper-variable trinucleotide microsatellite locus MML0050 locus does not
contain conspicuously long simple sequence repeats.
Our analysis of W-Beijing and non-W-Beijing strains
suggested that 10 repeats represented the upper limit
for allele size in the MTB genome. Wanner et al. proposed context-dependent codon choice as an alternative
mechanism used by the bacteria to reduce the number
of mutations [32]; however, this mechanism does not fit
with trinucleotide-related events. It has also been suggested by several others that infinite microsatellite
growth may be disabled by introductions of point mutations [6,8,33]. Specifically, if the balance between slippage and point mutation favors point mutations within

Evolution of the MML0050 locus

To investigate the evolution of the MML0050 locus we
first considered the observed C®T substitution mutation that occurred in the last repeat motif and which
differentiated all the clinical strains from the reference
strain. This 100% mutation frequency may indicate that
this nucleotide transition is a fixed mutation in MTB
and one that has essentially benefited the strain’s survival and/or host infectivity. Moreover, detailed investigation of the mutations in the alleles indicated that they
occurred via a stepwise mutation process (SSM) of

the repeated region, the mutations may interrupt the
feature of the microsatellite without eliciting large
changes in length. Indeed, all of the clinical strains
examined in our study contained point mutations. This
finding has led us to speculate that the first point mutation in the last repeat motif of all sequences may represent one of the bacteria’s mechanisms to confine the
expansion or contraction of microsatellite sequences. In
addition, the second point mutation in the middle of the
sequence may act as an alternative way to maintain the
stabilization of long alleles by breaking repeat arrays
into smaller units.
Trinucleotide repeating sequences from the MML0050
locus are transcribed into a repeating series of prolines
in the Rv005 protein sequence. It has been reported that
repeating sequences of amino acids can affect the physical and chemical properties of proteins, and harbor the
potential for producing gradual and predictable changes
in protein action [34,35]. Penicillin-binding protein
encoded by Rv0050 is not only a key cell wall synthesizing enzyme [14,15] but also plays an important role in
regulating cell wall hydrolysis [36]. Depletion of the
penicillin-binding protein results in misshapen bacterial
cells and impaired growth [15,36]. However, it has been
unclear whether repeating sequences of amino acids
caused by the MML0050 locus can affect the protein
function or bacterial phenotype and growth. Nevertheless, the results from our study indicated that nearly all
samples in the W-Beijing group with unique phenotypes
harbored the allele with the highest repeat numbers. It
is possible that polymorphism of the MML0050 locus,
to some extent, can affect functional properties of the
proteins and may, subsequently, impact bacterial
phenotype.

Conclusion
Size analysis indicated the presence of five MML0050
alleles that differed in length by three base pairs, implicating replication slippage in the mutational process of
this microsatellite. Although the relative frequency in
the longest allele was remarkably higher than that in the
shortest for all of the tested strains, mutation frequency
was not completely related with the total length in this
trinucleotide microsatellite. Moreover, nucleotide gains
were found to have occurred more frequently than
loses. Sequence analysis supported the notion that point
mutation events acted to maintain microsatellite size
integrity while providing genomic diversity. Introduction
of an interruptive motif correlated with the total allele
length and genetic lineage, rather than the length of the
longest stretch of perfect repeats. Finally, the comparison of W-Beijing vs. non-W-Beijing strains revealed that
the levels of the locus variation were significantly different between the two groups.
