Abstract
Background: Most arthropods pass through several molting stages (instars) before reaching
sexual maturity. In spiders, very little is known about the male genital system, its development and
seminal secretions. For example, it is unknown whether spermatozoa exist prior to-, or only after
the final molt. Likewise, it is unclear whether sperm are produced throughout male adulthood or
only once in a lifetime, as is whether seminal secretions contain factors capable of manipulating
female behavior. In order to shed light on these aspects of the reproductive biology of spiders, we
investigated the male genital system of the common cellar spider Pholcus phalangioides, with special
emphasis on its development and seminal secretions.
Results: Testes already display all stages of spermatogenesis in subadult males (about four weeks
before the final molt). Their vasa deferentia possess proximally a very voluminous lumen containing
dense seminal fluid and few spermatozoa, whereas the distal part is seemingly devoid of contents.
Spermatoza of P. phalangioides are typical cleistospermia with individual secretion sheaths. In male
stages approximately two weeks prior to the final molt, the lumina of the testes are wider and filled
with a dense secretion. The wide, proximal portion of the vasa deferentia is filled with secretion
and a large number of spermatozoa, and the narrow distal part also contains secretion. In adult
males, the wide lumina of the testes are packed with spermatozoa and secretions. The latter are
produced by the somatic cells that bear microvilli and contain many vesicles. The lumina of the vasa
deferentia are narrow and filled with spermatozoa and secretions. We could identify a dense matrix
of secretion consisting of mucosubstances and at least three types of secretion droplets, likely
consisting of proteinaceous substances.
Conclusion: This study reveals that spermatogenesis begins weeks before maturity and takes
place continuously in the long-lived males of P. phalangioides. Possible functions of the various types
of secretion in the seminal fluid and previously investigated female secretions are discussed in the
light of sexual selection.

Background
When and for how long males produce sperm very likely
depends on the mating system of the species in question.
Long-lived species in which males can expect several matings probably continue to produce sperm throughout
their lifetime. On the other hand, in species with a short
reproductive time window or in species that show a considerable drop in female receptivity after a single mating,
a male is expected to allocate all resources into sperm production for a single mating. For spiders, both evolutionary
scenarios are conceivable: in sexually cannibalistic spiders, males load each of their copulatory organs, the pedipalps, only once and cease to produce sperm after the
final molt, which seems to be a consequence of the high
incidence of monogamy that is forced upon the male by
female cannibalistic attacks [[1]; PM personal observation], whereas in most spider species, males can expect
more than one mating. In our focal species, Pholcus
phalangioides, adult males are especially long-lived, with
life-spans of up to a year [GU personal observation]. In
this group of spiders sperm should be produced throughout a male's lifetime.
During mating, males not only transfer sperm, but also
seminal fluid [2-6]. The seminal fluid of Drosophila melanogaster contains over 80 proteins and peptides. The few
substances that have been identified have marked effects
on the reproductive success of males and females: seminal
fluid proteins and peptides can decrease female receptivity, increase egg production, facilitate sperm storage, and
are necessary for sperm transfer and success in sperm competition. Moreover, antimicrobial agents in the secretions
ensure that the female reproductive tract is a hospitable
environment during sperm transfer and storage. In some
species, even noxious chemicals are transferred and incorporated into developing eggs to protect them from predators and pathogens [reviews: [4-7]]. Similar functions
have been reported from other insects such as butterflies
[8] and crickets [9]. In most insects, males produce secretions in separate accessory glands that can be dissected to
characterize their products. However, male spiders have
not been reported to possess separate accessory glands
that are directly connected to the genital tract. The production of seminal secretion is thus very likely to occur within
the testes. However, it is conceivable that the effects of the
seminal secretions on the reproductive success of males
and females may be similar in spiders and insects despite
their different origin.
The shape of the male genital system in spiders differs
enormously across spider taxa, but usually consists of two
thick strands of testes, continuing in the thin convoluted
vasa deferentia, which fuse distally to form the unpaired
ductus ejaculatorius that opens into the genital opening
located in the epigastric furrow [for entelegyne araneo-

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/12

morph spiders: [10-13]; but see [14] for Theraphosidae].
Generally, the male genital system in spiders is embedded
in the midgut gland and the testes often extend deeply
into the opisthosoma. Additional multicellular glands
present in male spiders are the so-called epiandrous (=epigastric) glands, which seem to provide part of the sperm
web and release their acinous substances near the genital
opening through special spigots (=fusules) [15-17]. For
some spider families unicellular glands that open into the
epigastric furrow via individual ducts are described, but it
is unknown whether the glandular secretion is added to
the sperm mass [17,18]. Unpublished work supports the
notion that there is a great diversity of secretions in the
male genital tract of spiders, the origin and functions of
which are unknown [[10]; PM, GU personal observation].
In the present study, we briefly describe the genital system
of the haplogyne spider P. phalangioides. We investigate
the organisation and development of the male genital system, the ultrastructure of the different parts, and give a
first characterization of the secretions produced in the
genital system. Finally, we present some additional findings on spermatogenesis and spermatozoa that complement previous investigations [19-21].

Results
The male genital system of P. phalangioides consists of one
pair of massive testes and convoluted vasa deferentia
which become thicker near the genital opening and fuse
distally to form the ductus ejaculatorius (Fig. 1). The genital tract is located ventrally in the opisthosoma and the
testes extend as far as to the spinning apparatus (Figs. 2c,
3c, 4a). Parts of the testes and the vasa deferentia are bordered ventrally by the ampullate silk glands (Figs. 2c, 3c,
4a). The genital system is surrounded by extensions of the
midgut gland (Figs. 2c, 3c, 4a).
Developmental Stages of the Male Genital System
Stage 1 (about four weeks before the final molt)
These young males are characterized by palpal organs that
are bent in the joint of the tibia and patella (Figs. 2a,b).
Dark sclerotized areas are present on the femur and tibia.
The tarsus has a broad shape without any signs of internal
structures or appendages as present in adult males (Figs.
2a,b).

The longitudinal section through the opisthosoma (Fig.
2c) shows that the dimensions of the testis are similar to
the final dimensions in adult males (compare Fig. 4a),
and all stages of spermatogenesis are observable (Fig. 2f).
Spermatogenesis occurs in cysts containing spermatids of
the same developmental stage (Fig. 2f, see also Figs. 3e,
4c). The secretory activity within the testis is very low as
indicated by the absence of the dark green secretion visible in subadult stage 2 and adults (see below).

The most distal part of the testis becomes thinner and
opens into the vas deferens, forming a valve-like structure
(Fig. 2e). The proximal part of the vas deferens possesses
a thick epithelium and has an extensive lumen that is
filled with spermatozoa embedded in a bright green secretion (Figs. 2c,e). In the more distal parts the lumen, the
vas deferens is very narrow. It contains neither spermatozoa nor any other recognizable substance (Fig. 2d).
Stage 2 (about two weeks before the final molt)
In this stage the palpal organs are only slightly bent. The
tarsus is extended and the internal structures known from
the palps of adult males are visible through the cuticle
(Figs. 3a,b). Dark sclerotized areas are present on the distal and lateral side of the tarsus (Figs. 3a,b).

The section in Figure 3c displays a similar organization as
that in subadult males of stage 1. The testis contains all
stages of spermatogenesis (Fig. 3e). Lumina with dark
green secretion and several spots with red, roundish secretion are present between the cysts of spermatid (Fig. 3e,
arrows). This secretion is produced by the somatic cells of
the testis (see below).

spermatogenesis are visible (Figs. 4a,b). The spermatozoa
are coiled, which is typical of spiders (Fig. 5e). In comparison to the subadult stages, the lumen of the adult testis
seems wider and is filled with a bright green secretion
matrix and red, roundish secretion droplets of different
sizes (Fig. 4c).
In contrast to subadult males, the vasa deferentia possess
a narrow lumen filled with spermatozoa and different
secretions over their entire length (Figs. 4b,d). Here, the
secretion matrix has a bright green color similar to that of
the testis (Figs. 4b,d). Furthermore, there are also different
red, roundish secretions of varying sizes (Fig. 4d, compare
also Fig. 6a).
Close to the genital opening the thin vasa deferentia fuse
and form the ductus ejaculatorius, which is characterized
by an extensive lumen with large amounts of spermatozoa
and secretions (Fig. 4d). The epithelium near the genital
opening and towards the ductus ejaculatorius is prismatic
and apically bordered by cuticle (Fig. 4e).

The extensive proximal part of the vas deferens is almost
completely filled with spermatozoa and secretions (Figs.
3c,d). Distally, the vas deferens becomes thinner and is
shaped as a convoluted tube (Figs. 3c,d). Within the
lumen a similar material as in the proximal part is present
(Fig. 3d, arrows).

Near the ductus ejaculatorius, epiandrous glands are
present which open into small spigots anterior to the genital opening (Fig. 4e). These glands are characterized by
large lumina and a prismatic epithelium (Fig. 4e). The
secretion of the glands has a granular green appearance as
seen in the duct of the epiandrous spigots (Fig. 4e). The
lumen of the gland appears empty, though this may be an
artifact.

Adult Stage
The fully developed male genital system is also characterized by tube-like testes and thin convoluted vasa deferentia (Figs. 1, 4a). Within the testes all stages of

Ultrastructure of spermatozoa and testis of Pholcus phalangioides
Figure 5
Ultrastructure of spermatozoa and testis of Pholcus phalangioides. (a): Early spermatid. The nucleus is surrounded by
a manchette of microtubules with a peculiar regular pattern. The nuclear envelope possesses a wave-like outline. The cytoplasm in front of the acrosomal vacuole at the anterior pole of the nucleus is indented. Note the annulate lamellae near the
nucleus. (b): Late spermatids. The chromatin of the nucleus is almost completely condensed. The nucleus possesses a very
elongated shape with a conspicuous helical band whirling around it (arrows). (c): Detail of the nucleus. The helical band of the
nucleus is very thin and bordered by microtubules (arrows). Between the band, the dense manchette of microtubules is conspicuous (arrowheads). (d): Scanning electron micrograph of a late spermatid. Note the extensive cytoplasm drop at the posterior end of the spermatid. The helical character of the nucleus is clearly visible. (e): Lumen of the testis with coiled spermatids.

and an axonemal basis, which migrates into an indentation at the posterior pole of the nucleus. In this early stage,
the manchette of microtubules and the nuclear surface
possesses a unique arrangement. As seen in cross-sections,
the microtubules are not densely packed and the nuclear
envelope shows a slightly wave-like outline (Fig. 5a). The
quadrangular acrosomal vacuole is tightly connected to
the cell membrane, which is indented in this region (Fig.
5a). Within the cytoplasm annulate lamellae are present
(Fig. 5a).
During spermiogenesis the chromatin condenses and the
nucleus strongly elongates (Fig. 5b). A thin helical band of
nuclear material covered by microtubules surrounds the
nucleus over its entire length (Figs. 5b,c). The acrosomal
vacuole elongates during spermiogenesis, and finally possesses a cylindrical shape (Fig. 5d). A considerable
amount of cytoplasm accumulates at the posterior end of
the spermatids, forming a big droplet (Figs. 5b,d).
Within the lumen of the testis, only coiled spermatozoa
are found embedded in a secretion matrix, which is likely
produced by the extensive somatic cells (Figs. 5e,f). The
extensions of the somatic cells surround the cysts of spermatids. Apically, the somatic cells bear long microvilli
and contain many vesicles, indicative of strong secretory
activity (Fig. 5f). Several secretion droplets are visible
between the spermatozoa (Figs. 5e,f). The large secretion
droplets seem to be produced through fusion of smaller
droplets, as indicated by the irregular ring of loose material around the electron-dense center of the droplet (Fig.
5f, arrows).
Within the vas deferens the spermatozoa are densely
packed and embedded in a homogenous secretion matrix
(Fig. 6a). Each single spermatozoon is surrounded by a
secretion sheath forming a so-called cleistosperm (Figs.
6a,b). The secretion sheath is produced within the vas def-

erens since it is absent in the testis (Fig. 5e). Within the
secretion matrix three different kinds of secretions are
present (Fig. 6). The first type of secretion consists of small
droplets which are densely distributed and characterized
by a bright center and a dark border. The second kind is a
large electron-dense secretion droplet with a very irregular
shape. These droplets often partially surround the spermatozoa (Fig. 6a). The third and rarest type of secretion is a
droplet which appears less electron-dense. It is characterized by a heterogeneous content and an irregular surface
to which particles may adhere or are partly embedded
(Fig. 6c). The epithelium of the vas deferens is flat and
bears microvilli in its apical region. A muscle layer surrounds the vas deferens (Fig. 6b).

Discussion
General Organization of the Male Genital System
The male genital system of P. phalangioides is characterized
by thick tube-like testes and thin convoluted vasa deferentia which fuse distally to form the ductus ejaculatorius.
This organization is reported from many species of different families, e.g., Cybaeidae, Theridiidae and Agelenidae,
and seems to be the general condition in araneomorph
spiders (see background). However, theraphosid spiders
show no distinct separation between testis and vas deferens [[14]; PM personal observation] and in theraphosid as
well as mesothelid spiders the testes themselves are convoluted [[14,22]; PM personal observation]. In some species, e.g., the cybaeid Argyroneta aquatica, the testes are
curved but distinct from the vasa deferentia [11].
Petrunkevitch [23] suggested that the general organization of the male genital system is not useful for phylogenetic consideration, but the few data available indicate a
potential for systematic interpretation. For example, in all
theridiid spiders studied thus far, the vasa deferentia lead
into a roundish vesicula seminalis (=ductus ejaculatorius?), the storage site of the mature spermatozoa, which
is connected via an unpaired duct with the genital

opening [[13]; PM personal observation]. Considering the
information available to date, it is at least misleading to
take the theraphosid type of male genital system as representative for spiders [24,25].
Development of the Male Genital System
In P. phalangioides, spermiogenesis starts several weeks
before the last molt and continues in the adults. In the

subadult males approximately four weeks before the final
molt, the lumina of the testes are very thin and only a
small amount of the dense secretion matrix is observable.
The secretory activity increases within the last two weeks
of the subadult stage. In adults, the lumina are wide and
full of secretion and mature spermatozoa. The two different functions of the testis – the production of sperm cells
and different kinds of secretion (see below), are evident.

Several authors suggested that these secretions are products of degenerated spermatids and the cytoplasmic droplet discarded at the end of spermiogenesis [20,26,27].
However, rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodies
and vesicles in the somatic cells demonstrate that the epithelium itself produces the secretions as was suggested by
Alberti et al. [28].

der [30] and the related pholcid spider Holocnemus pluchei
[34]. The obvious difference in seminal secretory products
in closely related species suggests that there is rapid divergence of seminal fluid substances that may originate from
the process of sexual selection. It has been assumed that
the rapid evolution of reproductive proteins is a motor in
the speciation process [35].

In the subadult stages, the vasa deferentia possess a very
extensive lumen in which the mature spermatozoa and
secretion from the testes accumulate continuously. The
thick epithelium of the vasa deferentia also shows secretory activity. It may be responsible for the formation of
the secretion sheath surrounding each spermatozoon, as
suggested for other spider species [20,28-32]. In adults,
several kinds of secretion are present in the vasa
deferentia, whereas in young subadult stages only a dense
secretion matrix is present. Thus, it is evident that secretory activity increases in subadults when approaching the
final molt. Furthermore, in adult male spiders the epithelium of the vasa deferentia is very thin and secretory activity is low as was stated for the cybaeid Argyroneta aquatica
[11].

In spiders, sperm and the seminal secretions are not
directly transferred into the female genital tract, but taken
up into the palpal organ before mating. Within the
pedipalps, glandular epithelia adjacent to the sperm
storage site seem to be widespread and also occur in P.
phalangioides and other spider species [[37,38]; Rose W,
unpublished data]. It has been assumed that their products serve to release the sperm into the female genital tract
during copulation or to serve as a protective matrix for
sperm storage within the male palp [e.g., [37,39,40]].
During mating, sperm are transferred to the storage site
within the female together with the secretions originating
from both genital tract and pedipalp. Finally, inside the
female cellar spider, sperm and male secretions encounter
secretion that is produced by the female. The only nonmorphological investigation existing to date identified
proteinaceous substances and glyco- and lipoprotein
components in the sperm storage site of virgin female P.
phalangioides using gel-electrophoretic methods [41].

In adult males of P. phalangioides cleistospermia and secretions are transferred into the palpal copulatory organ
soon after the final molt. Sperm uptake by the male can
occur repeatedly after each mating and may require a continuous production of sperm cells. In fact, P. phalangioides
males mate several times [33] and refill their pedipalp
sperm stores after each mating [GU unpublished observation]. To do so successfully, cellar spider males begin
sperm production in the subadult phase and continue
production throughout adulthood, as demonstrated by
our study. In contrast, studies on short lived spider males
with only a single mating opportunity showed that males
do not refill their sperm stores and probably cease to produce sperm after the final molt [1], instead using their
resources for rigorous mate selection [Pauly A, Uhl G, Schneider JM unpublished data].
Secretory Products
Three different kinds of secretion droplets could be identified in the dense secretion matrices of the testes and vasa
deferentia of P. phalangioides. According to Romeis [36],
the Goldner staining method results in a green coloration
of acidic mucosubstances and in red coloration of proteinaceous substances. It cannot be ruled out that the
seemingly different kinds of secretion represent different
steps of a single secretory pathway. However, since we also
found different secretion droplets within the palpal organ,
we conclude that different secretory pathways result in a
variety of secretions with potentially different functions.
Morphologically, the secretions are clearly different from
those found in two other spider species, a mesothelid spi-

For spiders, a nutritive and protective function (desiccation and pathogens) has mainly been attributed to either
male or female secretions since the sperm cells are often
stored for extended periods of time [e.g., [41-45]], but
secretions may also serve as lubricants and promote physical uptake or release of sperm inside the male palp (see
above). Female secretory products have been suggested to
control sperm activation [18,46-48]. However, male
secretions may also play an important role in this process.
Spermatozoa and Spermatogenesis
It has been known since the study of Alberti and Weinmann [20] that P. phalangioides possesses very aberrant
spermatozoa with several unique characters (e.g., an elongated proximal centriole and a central nuclear canal containing the acrosomal filament), but the most
conspicuous character is the band of nuclear material spirally surrounding the nucleus. As shown in the present
study, the first signs of this peculiar transformation of the
helical band are present in very early spermatid stages:
microtubules are loosely arranged around the nucleus
resulting in a wave-like outline of the nuclear envelope.
The functional implications of the band are still
unknown. It may influence the mobility of the spermatozoa or play a role during fertilization. The phylogenetic
value of the peculiar spermatozoa of P. phalangioides
remains uncertain as well, as the sperm ultrastructure of

only one further pholcid spider, H. pluchei, is known
[34,49]. The spermatozoa of these two species however do
markedly differ in accord with the present ideas on systematic relationships within the Pholcidae [50]. On the
other hand, a helical band of nuclear material is also
present in Spermophora senoculata [PM personal observation], a species closely related to P. phalangioides [50]. It
therefore seems that sperm characteristics may be successfully applied successfully in phylogenetic considerations.

Conclusion
Our study demonstrates that sperm production in males
of a long-lived spider species begins weeks before the final
molt and continues throughout adulthood. Within the
male genital tract, there are at least three different types of
proteinaceous secretion droplets apart from a basic matrix
secretion containing acidic mucosubstances. The different
secretions may serve functions similar to those found in
insects, such as oviposition stimulants or manipulators of
female receptivity, and clearly warrant future investigation. Moreover, since secretory glands of the female are
known to discharge their products into the sperm storage
site, their effect on sperm storage, activation and sperm
competition should also be investigated. Further, both
male and female secretions may interact in as yet unexpected ways. If males have evolved manipulative substances that are against female interests, or if they offer a
platform for cryptic female choice, we expect a similar
divergence in female secretions and in their interactions
with male derived substances.

isolated genital system was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde
in the same buffer followed by postfixation in buffered
2% osmium tetroxide. After washing, the tissue pieces
were dehydrated in graded ethanols and embedded in
Spurr's resin [53]. Ultrathin sections (50 nm) were made
with a Leica ultramicrotome and stained with uranyl
acetate and lead citrate [54]. Examination was performed
with a Zeiss EM 10A electron microscope.
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
The isolated genital system of elder males (N = 3) was split
open in a droplet of phosphate buffer (see above) with
thin needles on glass coverslips covered with 1% poly-Llysin. After 10 min sedimentation the adhering material
was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde buffer for 1 h at 4°C.
Samples were then rinsed in buffer and post-fixed in buffered 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in ethanol, dried
in a Balzers CPD 030 critical point dryer, coated with gold
in a Balzers MED 010 sputtering device and examined in
a Philips XL20 scanning electron microscope.

Authors' contributions

Methods
Light Microscopy (LM)
Males of P. phalangioides were collected in houses and cellars within the city of Freiburg i.Br., Germany at an early
juvenile stage and reared in the laboratory in individual
containers on a diet of fruitflies. During the last intermolt
interval, males were classified into two developmental
stages according to the external morphology of their
developing palpal organs. Young subadult males (stage 1,
N = 5) were fixed approximately four weeks before the
final molt and older subadult males (stage 2, N = 5) were
fixed about two week before the final molt. Adult males
(N = 5) were examined one to two days after their final
molt.

Male specimens were fixed in Bouin solution according to
Gregory [51], dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol or
isopropanol and embedded in Paraplast. Sections (7 µm)
were made with a Reichert 1150 Autocut microtome,
stained according to Goldner [52], and mounted with
Eukitt medium. Examination was performed with an
Olympus BX 60 and pictures were taken with an Olympus
DP 10.

We are indebted to Gerd Alberti and Michael Schmitt for useful comments
on the manuscript. For the help with the SEM, the authors are grateful to
David Mercati, Fabiola Giusti and Eugenio Paccagnini from the lab of
Romano Dallai (University of Siena, Italy). PM acknowledges a grant from
the German National Merit Foundation and from the VIGONI-program
(German Academic Exchange Service, DAAD). Furthermore, the financial
support of the German Research Council (DFG, Al 138/11-1) is greatly
appreciated. The histological investigations were performed by GU during
her doctoral studies at the University of Freiburg, supported by the German National Merit Foundation. GU thanks Peter Weygoldt, Claudia Gack
and Gerhard von der Emde for support.
