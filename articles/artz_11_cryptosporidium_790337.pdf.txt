Abstract
Background: Hundreds of millions of people are infected with cryptosporidiosis annually, with
immunocompromised individuals suffering debilitating symptoms and children in socioeconomically challenged
regions at risk of repeated infections. There is currently no effective drug available. In order to facilitate the pursuit
of anti-cryptosporidiosis targets and compounds, our study spans the classification of the Cryptosporidium parvum
kinome and the structural and biochemical characterization of representatives from the CDPK family and a MAP
kinase.
Results: The C. parvum kinome comprises over 70 members, some of which may be promising drug targets. These
C. parvum protein kinases include members in the AGC, Atypical, CaMK, CK1, CMGC, and TKL groups; however,
almost 35% could only be classified as OPK (other protein kinases). In addition, about 25% of the kinases identified
did not have any known orthologues outside of Cryptosporidium spp. Comparison of specific kinases with their
Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii orthologues revealed some distinct characteristics within the C.
parvum kinome, including potential targets and opportunities for drug design. Structural and biochemical analysis
of 4 representatives of the CaMK group and a MAP kinase confirms features that may be exploited in inhibitor
design. Indeed, screening CpCDPK1 against a library of kinase inhibitors yielded a set of the pyrazolopyrimidine
derivatives (PP1-derivatives) with IC50 values of < 10 nM. The binding of a PP1-derivative is further described by an
inhibitor-bound crystal structure of CpCDPK1. In addition, structural analysis of CpCDPK4 identified an
unprecedented Zn-finger within the CDPK kinase domain that may have implications for its regulation.
Conclusions: Identification and comparison of the C. parvum protein kinases against other parasitic kinases shows
how orthologue- and family-based research can be used to facilitate characterization of promising drug targets
and the search for new drugs.

Background
More than 58 million children are afflicted annually
with diarrheal disease associated with the most prevalent
infections of the small intestine, including Escherichia
coli, Rotavirus, Giardia lamblia, and Cryptosporidium
parvum, which ultimately results in the death of 2.5 million children [1]. C. parvum is an obligate parasite in
the same phylum of Apicomplexa as Plasmodium and
the same order of Eucoccidiorida as Toxoplasma and
Eimeria. It is one of the pathogenic agents responsible

for cryptosporidiosis, a zoonotic and enteric disease.
Children in resource-poor settings are particularly at
risk, not only with an increased incidence of Cryptosporidium spp. infection, but also with increased acute and
long-lasting morbidity. Psychomotor developmental
stunting may occur following infection, especially in
children under one year of age, with its effects still measurable many years after infection [2,3]. Malnutrition is
both a contributing factor and a result of Cryptosporidium spp. infection [4,5]. In this environment, malnutrition, immune immaturity, and HIV-infection often
synergistically affect the severity of Cryptosporidium spp.
infection. This situation, added to socioeconomic isolation of most afflicted regions, has led to marginalization

of cryptosporidiosis as a neglected disease, one that
lacks an effective drug [6]. Paromomycin and nitazoxanide are considered only partially effective in otherwise
healthy patients, while nitazoxanide is ineffective in
AIDS patients [7].
The research efforts to find therapeutics for cryptosporidiosis are scant, relative to resources dedicated to
other protozoan diseases, such as malaria. To date, only
61 structures from Cryptosporidium spp. (compared to
almost 400 from Plasmodium spp.) have been deposited
to the RSCB Protein Databank http://www.rscb.org. In
fact, prior to our first work on C. parvum beginning in
late 2004, only 2 Cryptosporidium structures had been
deposited and released (both dihydrofolate reductasethymidylate synthase). Cryptosporidium structure determination, is arguably a contributing step to the development of effective inhibitors and ultimately drugs.
Structural genomics efforts have greatly enhanced the
diversity and overall number of presently available structures by contributing over 70% of all currently available
Cryptosporidium structures covering 34 different proteins/domains, while the remaining 30% of structures
(17) only covers 5 different targets. This focus of
research on a few targets, leaving many targets underexplored, plagues drug development today [8,9]. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, there have been only
4 studies to date in which a Cryptosporidium target and
effective inhibitors have been identified and characterized. These include inosine 5’-monophosphate dehydrogenase [10], S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase [11],
nonspecific polyprenyl pyrophosphate synthase (related
to farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase) [12] and calciumdependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) [13], where the latter two targets were contributed by structural genomics
groups. In order to stimulate interest in new Cryptosporidium targets, we have selected for study the C. parvum
kinome. As one of the largest protein families in eukaryotic genomes [14] and with many inhibitor libraries
commercially available, protein kinases are considered
attractive drug targets for human and infectious diseases
alike [15]. Already, Plasmodium kinases are the subject
of a growing body of research [16-18], as are the Toxoplasma gondii kinases [19]. In contrast, Cryptosporidium
parvum PKs (CpPK) are only incidentally mentioned in
publications focusing on Plasmodium or other parasites.
In an endeavour to address the void, our study spans
the classification of the C. parvum kinome and the
structural and biochemical characterization of representatives from the CDPK family and a MAP kinase. Comparison of the CpPKs (protein kinases) with other
known parasitic kinases illustrates some of their unique
features and demonstrates that there are potential drug
targets, as well as opportunities for drug design.

Results and Discussion
Breakdown of the Cryptosporidium parvum kinome

Assignment of the protein kinases to their subfamilies
was accomplished via clustering of the kinase domain by
sequence similarity. Additional information from
domains outside of the catalytic domain and from evolutionary conservation was also used to aid in the analysis,
culminating in a classification that rests on a hybrid of
results. As such, we found 73 protein kinases with intact
catalytic triads [20], including those falling into the following categories: AGC, CaMK, CK1, CMGC, TKL, Atypical, and OPK (other protein kinases). Like P.
falciparum, there are no STE or tyrosine kinases [17],
whereas only 1 STE kinase was noted in the T. gondii
kinome analysis [19]. Of all the protein kinases found,
almost a quarter (17) have no predicted orthologues
outside of Cryptosporidium spp. The breakdown of the
C. parvum kinome is shown in Figure 1 (and also Additional File 1, Table S1 for a summary table and Additional File 2, Table S2 for the alignments).
AGC group

From the AGC group, 5 protein kinases were clearly
identified, including the 3 cAMP-dependent protein
kinases (PKA) or PKA-like kinases. The CpPKA kinase
cgd3_3040 is an orthologue to the P. falciparum and T.
gondii PKA kinases, PFI1685w and TGME49_026030,
respectively. The CpPKA-like kinases include cgd1_1220
(based on its TgPKA orthologue TGME49_072200) and
cgd2_1830 (without predicted orthologues, but anticipated to be PKA-like from its homology with
cgd1_1220). Except for CpPKA and its orthologues,
which share ~60% full length sequence identity, these
protozoan PKA-like orthologues are quite divergent
sharing less than 30% identity between them. Notably,
CpPKA-like kinase (cgd2_1830) is significantly shorter
at the N-terminus and no GxGxxG motif can be identified (from subdomain I, this glycine triad structurally
forms a hairpin around the bound ATP). Two of these
apicomplexan PKA-like kinases (cgd1_1220 and
TGME49_072200) have large C-terminal extensions (>
200 residues) of unknown function. Similar to C. parvum, T. gondii has a proportionally large number of
PKA(-like) kinases which includes 6 of the 10 members
of the AGC group [19], while 1 PKA kinase of the 5
members of the P. falciparum AGC group was identified
[17]. Cgd7_120 is the only cAMP-dependent protein
kinase regulatory subunit annotated in the Cryptosporidium database, CryptoDB [21], while there are 3 in T.
gondii (TGME49_042070, TGME49_111300, and
TGME49_019070) and 1 in P. falciparum (PFL1110c).
C. parvum contains a single cGMP-dependent protein
kinase (CpPKG), namely cgd8_750 (an orthologue to

PfPKG and TgPKG, PF14_0346 and TGME49_111360,
respectively). PfPKG is essential in the blood stage and
in gametogenesis of P. falciparum infection [22,23].
CpPKG is predicted to have 3 cyclic nucleotide-binding
domains (cNMP-BD) upstream of the kinase domain,
while PfPKG and TgPKG each have 4 predicted cNMPBDs.
The orthologue to the T. gondii and P. falciparum
phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDPK)
(TGME49_068210 and PF11_0227, respectively) is
cgd1_2630. These are ~30% identical in sequence, but
CpPDPK is smaller (by ~100 residues) and without the

kinase domain insert found in both the Pf PDPK and
TgPDPK. Notably, C. parvum does not have PKB
(whereas P. falciparum does) or PKC (also not present
in T. gondii or P. falciparum). C. parvum is like P. falciparum bearing 5 AGC protein kinases which is half of
that found in T. gondii.
CaMK group

Despite the absence of PKC, the prominence of CaMK
family members indicates that regulation by calcium is
clearly important in C. parvum parasites, as well as
other apicomplexans [24]. Calmodulin (CpCaM,

cgd2_810) with 85% sequence identity to human CaM
and 4 CaM-like proteins (containing < 220 residues and
two to four EF-hands) including cgd2_3790, cgd2_1700,
cgd3_3760, and cgd5_3920 were identified. From kinase
domain homology, a prototypical CaMK enzyme may
include cgd6_520 which was initially identified as a
CpCRK (CDPK-related kinase) [25]. Although it is 41%
identical to and clusters with PfPK2 (a proven CaMK
[26]) in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2), the auto-

Page 4 of 20

inhibitory helix and CaM-binding site of this C. parvum
kinase could not be readily identified. Cgd6_3400 clusters on a sister branch to the human CaMK enzymes
and is ~40% identical in sequence to them, but the
auto-inhibitory helix and CaM-binding motif are not
apparent in a sequence analysis. Cgd7_3890 (annotated
as CpCDPK7, but not containing EF-hands) contains
motifs indicative of both the auto-inhibitory sequence
and CaM-binding motif. Also, according to the

Figure 2 Maximum likelihood tree from a rapid bootstrap analysis for C. parvum CaMK family, also including select representatives of
the CaMK families from human, P. falciparum, and T. gondii. The subfamilies are as follows: CDPK (green), CaMK (blue), SNF1/AMPK (orange),
and potential apicomplexan CaM-binding kinases (pink). Note that although PFB0815w is annotated as CDPK1, it is the orthologue to TgCDPK3
(TGME40_105860) and PF07_0072 is annotated as PfCDPK4, but is actually the orthologue to TgCDPK1 (TGME49_101440).

phylogenetic tree analysis, it is related to the human
CaMK enzymes.
Like in plants and ciliates, the CDPK family dominates
the apicomplexan CaMK group (Figure 2). Recently the
mechanism of activation of CDPKs has been elucidated
by our group through structural biology using full
length structures of a few apicomplexan CDPK enzymes
[27,28]. Many of the C. parvum CDPK enzymes have
already been identified including: CpCDPK1 (cgd3_920),
CpCDPK2 (cgd7_1840), CpCDPK2A (cgd2_1060),

CpCDPK3 (cgd5_820), CpCDPK4 (cgd7_40), CpCDPK5
(cgd2_1300), and CpCDPK6 (cgd4_3330) [24]. A previously unidentified member of this family (cgd3_260)
has a kinase domain followed by 3 predicted EF hands
(see Table 1 for the domain architecture of this and all
of the CaMK enzymes discussed) and clusters amongst
the other CDPK enzymes of C. parvum. Notably, the
kinase domain of cgd3_260 is > 400 residues containing
a single large insert after the HRDxxxxN motif of subdomain VIB. According to OrthoMCL [29] this kinase

has no known orthologues outside of Cryptosporidium
spp. Also among the CDPK enzymes is cgd5_2270
(annotated as MELK (maternal embryonic leucine zipper
kinase)), clustering with CpCDPK4, but without EFhands and with small N- and C- terminal extensions of
~25 residues each. Clustered with the CDPK7 enzymes
is cgd2_1610, which also does not have any EF-hands.
Cgd6_650 is the CpSNF1 (homologous to the AMPmodulated protein kinases (AMPK)) according to its
clustering on the CaMK phylogenetic tree presented
herein (Figure 2) and its TgSNF1 orthologue
(TGME49_033900). Upon comparison to P. falciparum
with 13 CaMKs [17], there are 15 for C. parvum including the 8 CDPK enzymes with intact EF-hands, while T.
gondii has 20 CaMKs listed with complete catalytic
triads and 16 categorized as CDPKs [19].
CK1 group

Parasitic CK1 enzymes, including those from P. falciparum and T. gondii have attracted attention because of
their unexpected binding to an immobilized cyclindependent protein kinase (CDK) inhibitor (purvalanol B)
[30]. Two CpCK1 enzymes have been identified herein,
in comparison to 1 and 3 from P. falciparum and T.
gondii, respectively [17,19]. Specifically, from T. gondii
the cytosolic TgCK1a and the membrane bound
TgCK1b were isolated, while the third TgCK1
(TGME49_047710) is uncharacterized. TgCK1a could
be selectively inhibited by purvalanol B and aminopurvalanol A over the host CK1 enzymes; and importantly,
inhibition by aminopurvalanol (the more cell-permeable
of the two) inhibits parasite cell growth [31]. All of
these parasitic CK1 kinases share high sequence identity
in the kinase domain (64% to 89%) and should be tested
for similar inhibition profiles, including CDK inhibitors.
Similar to TgCK1b which has a C-terminal tail implicated in membrane localization [31], both C. parvum
enzymes have C-terminal tails indicating potential membrane localization.
CMGC group

There are 20 CMGC kinases in C. parvum which
include the cyclin-dependent- (CDK), mitogen-activated(MAPK), glycogen-synthase- (GSK), and CDK-like
(CDKL) kinases, as well as CK2 (casein kinase 2), CLK
(CDC-like kinase), DYRK (dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)phosphorylation regulated kinase), and SRPK (serine/
arginine-rich protein-specific kinase) [32]. In comparison, there are 20 CMGC kinases from T. gondii and 18
from P. falciparum [17,19]. Like those studied from P.
falciparum and in other eukaryotic systems, a majority
of CMGC kinases are involved in the control of cell proliferation and development, so their relative abundance
in these organisms may reflect the variety of successive

Page 6 of 20

proliferative and non-proliferative stages which constitute their life cycles. CDK enzymes with the typical
PSTAIRE cyclin-binding motif (where the terminal glutamate is the conserved residue in subdomain III forming a salt bridge with the catalyic lysine of subdomain
II) include cgd3_1510 (which has no known orthologues
outside Cryptosporidium spp.) and cgd5_2510 (orthologue of PfPK5 (MAL13P1.279) and TgPK2
(TGME49_018220)). Two other CDK enzymes were
identified through their orthologues including
cgd6_1420 with a SKTAIRE motif (orthologue to
PFD0740w, CDC2-related protein kinase 3) and
cgd7_430 with a HFTVLRE motif (orthologue to
PF10_0141, MO15-related protein kinase (PfMRK) and
TGME49_070330, CaMK). Note that “composite”
kinases (i.e. those having characteristics from two different groups) have been previously characterized in apicomplexan parasites [33]. As well, there are cgd7_280
and cgd1_60 which have no known orthologues outside
of Cryptosporidium spp., but are annotated as CDKs in
CryptoDB, presumably due to the presence of PATSIRE
and STTTLRE motifs. With respect to the first of 3 of
the these CpCDK enzymes with apicomplexan orthologues, the putative CpMRK (cgd7_430) enzyme and its
orthologue, PfMRK (which has sequence homology to
human CDK) are the same size (320 and 324 residues,
respectively) and share 50% sequence identity indicating
that classes of compounds effective against PfMRK (of
which there are several) should also be tried against
CpMRK. These include the purines, quinolinones, oxindoles, and chalcones which have sub-micromolar IC50
values against the Plasmodium enzyme, but not the
human CDK enzymes tested [34]. Also, PfMRK is inhibited by bromohydrosulfonylacetamides which possess
moderate antimalarial activity against drug resistant
parasites, but not broad spectrum CDK inhibitors [35].
PfMRK and its effector PfMAT1 (where the C-terminal
domain of PfMAT1 is the PfMRK activator domain)
have been demonstrated to be co-localized to the parasite nucleus and that PfMRK phosphorylates two plasmodial DNA replication proteins suggesting that PfMRK
in the nucleus is involved with the regulation of the
DNA replication machinery [36]. CDK enzyme,
cgd6_1420 is half the size of its orthologue, PfCRK-3
(PFD0740w) with 1339 residues, which has been implicated as crucial in intraerythrocytic development of P.
falciparum via regulation of gene expression [37].
Although PfCRK-3 bears an N-terminal domain of
between 350-400 residues (depending on how the > 10
inserts are counted), these enzymes still share 36%
sequence identity. CpCDK (cgd5_2510) and its orthologues are approximately the same size (at 295, 288, and
300 residues for C. parvum, P. falciparum, and T. gondii, respectively) and share from 65% to 72% sequence

Artz et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:478

identity. Crystal structures of C. parvum CDK
(cgd5_2510) have been solved with indirubin 3’-monoxime [PDB: 2QKR] and ADP [PDB: 3NIZ] bound by our
group, as well as its orthologue structure (PfPK5) structure in the presence [PDB: 1V0P and 1V0O] and
absence of inhibitors [PDB: 1OB3] by others [38].
C. parvum has 3 MAP kinases including cgd2_1960
(which is the orthologue of PF14_0294 (PfMAP-1)),
cgd2_4340 (orthologue of PF11_0147 (PfMAP-2) and
TGME49_007820), and cgd3_3030 (orthologue to
TGME49_112570, TgMAPK-1). Each of the MAP-2
orthologues is similar in size from 508 to 563 residues,
sharing from 49% to 55% sequence identity. Interestingly, like PfMAP-2, the C. parvum and T. gondii MAP2 orthologues share the peculiarity of not possessing the
conserved TXY activation motif (just upstream of the
conserved APE motif of subdomain VII) usually found
in enzymes of this family [39]. Instead, each has a TSH
at the same location; and furthermore no vertebrate
MAPK enzymes deviate in this activation motif suggesting that the fine regulation mechanisms of these apicomplexan MAP-2 orthologues may present a collective
opportunity for drug targeting. The remaining two C.
parvum MAP kinases have the expected TxY motif,
both in the form of TDY, like their respective P. falciparum and T. gondii orthologues. As well, using a
reverse genetics approach, PfMAP-2 gene was shown to
be essential for completion of the asexual cycle of P. falciparum, an unexpected result in view of the non-essentiality of the orthologous gene for P. berghei erythrocytic
schizogony [40]. The PfMAP-1 and putative CpMAP-1
orthologues only share 38% identity, but both have substantial C-terminal extensions of 602 and 338 residues,
respectively. The crystal structure of the kinase domain
of putative CpMAP-1 [PDB: 3OZ6] has been solved by
our group and is discussed below. Although cdg3_3030
and TgMAP-2 share 42% sequence identity, they are
notably distinct in size (overall, 566 versus 1212 residues, respectively) where the difference in size can be
mostly attributed to the uncharacterized large C-terminal extensions of 247 and 794 residues, respectively.
Both the PfGSK-3 and CpGSK-3 (cgd4_240) bear an
unusual N-terminal extension of about 70 residues
(although there is no sequence conservation between
the extensions and the catalytic domains are well-conserved). Notably, CpGSK-3 has an insert between the
catalytic lysine and just upstream of the gatekeeper
motif. Its structure has been solved [PDB: 3EBO] by our
group. Although the physiological functions of PfGSK-3
remain to be elucidated, a series of GSK-3b inhibitors
tested on both PfGSK-3 and mammalian GSK-3b show
a partially divergent sensitivity [41]. These results give
promise to both PfGSK-3 and CpGSK-3 with respect to
drug discovery.

Ten other members of the CMGC group were identified, including cgd8_3070 from its orthologue
(TGME49_085160, a putative cyclin-dependent kinaselike 5). The putative CpCKL and TgCKL-5 share 41%
sequence identity; however, the C. parvum enzyme is
significantly larger (551 residues versus 351 residues for
TgCKL-5) with > 10 inserts relative to its T. gondii
orthologue. In addition, a LAMMER kinase, 2 DYRK
kinases, and a Sky1p kinase were identified. Characterization of the PfLAMMER describes the enzyme as comprised of 2 domains, where the N-terminal domain is
unique and containing multiple consensus phosphorylation sites, a number of RS/SR dipeptides, a large portion
of charged residues, two putative nuclear localization
signals, and 14 copies of a DKYD repeat and the Cterminal domain is typical of the LAMMER family [42].
By comparison, CpLAMMER (cgd5_250) has a smaller
N-terminal domain comprised of ~300 residues (versus
550 for the PfLAMMER and ~1330 for TgLAMMER),
has a HTD motif (subdomain X), and is unusually rich
in asparagine residues. The PfLAMMER is expressed
specifically in the sexual stage; and thus the authors
concluded that it might be important in the regulation
of sexual differentiation [42]. C. parvum CMGC kinases
belonging to DYRK subfamily include: cgd7_3050 bearing an HCD motif (orthologue of TgDYRK,
TGME49_004280) and cgd8_5180 bearing a HAD motif
(orthologue of PfDYRK, PF11_0156 and of another
TgDYRK, TGME49_113180). These apicomplexan
DYRK enzymes have low sequence identity between
them and variable N-terminal domains ranging in size
from almost 150 residues to over 700 residues.
Cgd1_2960 is annotated as Sky1p-like and is implicated
in RNA metabolism. The arginine of the HRD motif
(subdomain X) is not conserved and is replaced by
threonine. Although it has a small N- and C-terminal
tails of 81 and 65 residues, respectively, it is the 4
inserts within the kinase domain that make this enzyme
stand out, including one of almost 250 residues just
upstream of the DFG motif of kinase subdomain VII.
CK2 enzymes are the only family within the CMGC
group that replaces the CMGC-arginine (found just
upstream of the APE motif of subdomain VIII) with a
lysine, as is observed herein for the C. parvum enzymes
and their orthologues, cgd6_620 (orthologue of
PF11_0096 CK2a and TGME49_063070, CK2) and
cgd7_1320, which has no known orthologues outside of
Cryptosporidium spp. This CK2 specific motif may allow
for the phosphorylation of substrates with proline or
nonproline residues at the P + 1 position of the substrate due to its increased side-chain flexibility, giving
H-bonding to the main-chain oxygen at the strained
position that the CMGC-arginine does, but also accommodating alterative H-bonding [43]. The conserved CK2

Artz et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:478
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/478

glycine following it may further contribute to the flexibility allowing a greater range of main-chain conformations, although cgd7_1320 does not conserve this
glycine. The PfCK2a has been characterized with protein kinase activity; and gene disruption experiments
have shown that it is crucial to the asexual blood stage
in Plasmodium, thereby providing evidence that it may
be a drug target [44]. Furthermore, it has differential
susceptibility to a small molecular inhibitor making it an
attractive target for antimalarial intervention, and potentially its orthologues in other parasitic diseases. Finally,
3 uncharacterized CMGC members with no known
orthologues outside of Cryptosporidium spp. were also
identified: cgd1_810 (which has a > 600 residue N-terminal extension and > 600 residue kinase domain),
cgd7_4850 (which is relatively small at 286 residues, has
an asparagine instead of an arginine in the HRD motif),
and cgd2_3890.
Atypical group

Atypical protein kinases (aPKs) lack sequence similarity
to the eukaryotic protein kinase domain hidden Markov
model profile and as such are unrelated (or only distantly related) by sequence to ePKs; however, they have
been shown experimentally to have protein kinase activity or are clear homologues of aPKs with demonstrated
protein kinase activity. There are four C. parvum
kinases that are identified as atypical based on their P.
falciparum and T. gondii orthologues, including 2 RIOs
(cgd7_440 and cgd5_2000) and 2 ABC1s (cgd8_3250
and cgd5_2400) (Additional File 1, Table S1). There
may be as many as 24 from T. gondii [19] and 4 from P.
falciparum [17] (including the RIOs and ABC1s).
TKL group

In C. parvum, there are 3 TKL enzymes including
cgd8_2430, cgd3_2900, and cgd3_4310 with each having
P. falciparum and/or T. gondii TKL orthologues, while
T. gondii and P. falciparum each contains 5 TKL
enzymes (Additional File 1, Table S1). Recently, work
on PfTKL-3 (PF13_0258, the orthologue of cgd3_4310
(the putative CpTKL-3) has demonstrated that it is
essential for asexual parasite proliferation in human erythrocytes [45]. Furthermore, the authors showed that it
undergoes in vitro autophosphorylation and phosphorylates exogenous substrates both of which are dependent
on the presence of a sterile a-motif (SAM) domain at
the N-terminus. Although these C. parvum and P. falciparum TKL-3 orthologues only share 30% overall
sequence identity, they both have a SAM domain, as
well as putative MORN (membrane occupation and
recognition nexus) motifs that are N-terminal to the
kinase domain and not shared by the TgTKL-3 orthologue. In the case of the P. falciparum orthologue, there is

Page 8 of 20

an additional N-terminal domain of > 1300 residues
(bearing PEXEL and 14_3_3 mode II binding motifs)
upstream of the SAM domain, correspondingly this
domain is only ~300 residues in the C. parvum enzyme.
Although CpTKL-1 and PfTKL-1 (cgd8_2430 and
PFB0520w, respectively) also bear these SAM and
MORN motifs, the third CpTKL does not (cgd3_4310).
OPK group

There are 2 clades of protein kinases entirely unique to
Apicomplexa, namely rhoptry kinases (T. gondii and
Neospora caninum only) and FIKK kinases (found only
in Plasmodium). We conducted BLAST analysis of the
sequences of all known Toxoplasma ROP kinases
against the C. parvum genome and did not find a single
orthologue. However, amongst a clad of others, a FIKKcontaining kinase was identified (cgd5_4390) which has
been previously annotated as a R45-like orthologue (and
named CpR45) by Schneider et al. from a tBLASTn
search using the protein kinase domain of PFD1175w
[46]. This protein is phylogenetically close to the Plasmodium FIKK cluster and also 40% identical in
sequence to PfFIKK8 (MAL8P1.203), with both lacking
the PEXEL motif found in most other P. falciparum
FIKK kinases. It is also the orthologue of a catalytically
incomplete TgFIKK kinase (TGME49_089050). Although
there are clades of OPK enzymes amongst the annotated
protein kinases of C. parvum, unique conserved motifs
potentially identifying a unique Cryptosporidium class of
protein kinases are not readily apparent. Since CpOPK
enzymes comprise almost 35% of the kinome, we have
divided them into their respective clades to simplify the
discussion and are not implying a further organization
of the C. parvum kinome at this point. OPK clade 1 is
comprised of 4 protein kinases including: cgd2_3190
(with a > 300 residue N-terminal extension) which is
the orthologue of a putatively identified AGC-related
PFC0385 c from P. falciparum and the T. gondii aurora
kinase TGME49_003010; cgd6_5060 which contains Nand C-terminal extensions of ~200 residues and has a P.
falciparum orthologue that is also AGC-related;
cgd6_5240 which has no known orthologues outside of
Cryptosporidium spp.; and cgd3_3180. OPK clade 2
includes 6 enzymes: cgd7_2000 which has no known
orthologues outside of Cryptosporidium spp. and N- and
C-terminal extensions of 436 and 72 residues; CpR45
(already discussed); cgd7_1190 which is an orthologue
of PFC0485w (CaMK) and TGME49_018550 (PIK3R4
kinase-related protein); cgd1_3230 which has no known
orthologues and a C-terminal extension that is > 500
residues; cgd6_4960; and cgd8_1660. OPK clade 3 contains 6 kinases that very little is known about including:
cgd4_990 and cgd4_1610, both with no known orthologues outside of Cryptosporidium spp; cgd8_5120 which

Artz et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:478
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/478

may be related to the CMGC kinases based on the
annotations of its orthologues; cgd7_1330 which may
contain an N-terminal transmembrane domain and has
green plant/algae orthologues; cgd7_3430 which has a
TKL orthologue from T. gondii, and cgd2_2310 with
uncharacterized apicomplexan orthologues. OPK clade 4
contains cgd1_1490 (with a > 250 residue C-terminal
domain) which is an orthologue to PFL1370w (NIMA
related protein kinase 1) that also has a C-terminal
extension (> 750 residues). PfNEK-1 is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate select protein substrates,
including PfMAP-2 [47]. There is also cgd1_890 which
has a kinase domain with a large insert making it more
than twice the size (at 659 residues) of a typical kinase
domain. It is the orthologue to PFF1370w (PfPK4) and
TGME49_029630 (kinase with an incomplete catalytic
triad). Cgd3_3230 has substantial N- and C-terminal
extensions (284 and 920 residues, respectively) and is
the orthologue to PF14_0423 (eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 1). Cgd7_3760 is an orthologue to
NEK kinases from P. falciparum and T. gondii.
Cgd7_5050 is annotated as NIMA related kinase 5 and
contains an N-terminal domain > 1000 residues. Interestingly, cgd4_3710 has an unusually large (> 400 residues) kinase domain (typically ~255 residues) that is a
function of 4 inserts including one after the catalytic
lysine (from subdomain II), another after the
HRDxxxxN motif of subdomain VIB, one after the APE
motif of subdomain VIII, and the last after the conserved aspartic acid of subdomain IX. The remaining 3
kinases include cgd7_3080 which has a T. gondii Wee
kinase orthologue, cgd8_1230, and cgd8_2180.
Activity of CpCDPK1, CpCDPK2, CpCDPK3, and CpCDPK4

The effect of calcium on the activity of constructs containing the kinase domain (KD) and CAD (CDPK activation domain) of CpCDPK1, CpCDPK2, CpCDPK3, and
CpCDPK4 was tested using the pyruvate kinase-lactate
dehydrogenase (PK-LDH) assay and the peptide substrate
Syntide-2 (a common CaMK substrate with the sequence
PLARTLSVAGLPGKK). They exhibited a range of phosphorylation activities (Table 2), but all showed an
increase in activity corresponding to an increase in calcium concentrations with turnover numbers of 11 ± 1, 9
± 2, 64 ± 6, and 3 ± 1 mM -1 min-1 , respectively, and in
the range of values previously determined for other
CDPKs with the exception of CpCDPK3 [28]. The difference in the catalytic efficiencies of these four CDPKs is
on the order of 300-fold for the same common kinase
peptide substrate, Syntide-2. Indeed, the CDPK enzymes
are expected to have different substrate specificities. For
example PfCDPK1 is capable of phosphorylating myelin
basic protein (MBP), histone 1, and casein, while
PfCDPK2 only recognizes MBP as a substrate [48].

Effect of the N-terminal latch on CDPK activity

The CpCDPK1 construct tested herein has a complete
N-terminal domain comprising 55 additional residues
over the other three CDPK enzymes tested, where these
constructs expressed do not have this N-terminal
domain. The CDPK N-terminal domain has been postulated to function as a structural latch that will enable
full kinase activity to be maintained once calcium has
been depleted. Our data on CpCDPK1 in the presence
of calcium shows that there is little difference between
the activity of a construct with an intact latch versus a
construct without a latch, a difference of ~50 residues
upstream of the subdomain 1 GxGxxG motif (data not
shown). However there is some sequence conservation
of hydrophobic residues just upstream of the GxGxxG
motif for P. falciparum, T. gondii, and C. parvum; and
this may indicate a conserved latch regulatory mechanism for apicomplexan CDPKs [28]. Specifically, hydrophobic patterns including a PGMF motif in at least 6
apicomplexan CDPKs and a FxRxxFILxxxG (or the variation of FxRxxooxxxxL), where x is any residue and o
is a hydrophobic residue, in 17 CDPKs which may signify that the application of such a regulatory mechanism
reliant on the interaction of hydrophobic residues is
used by apicomplexan CDPKs (Additional File 2, Table
S4).
Inhibition of CpCDPK1 by pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives

Inhibition of CpCDPK1 was thoroughly investigated by
screening with a series of compounds designed to
exploit the small gatekeeper that is naturally occurring
in CpCDPK1, but not in the other CpCDPKs (Additional File 3, Table S5). For example, similar to previous
results [13], pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives are ineffective against kinases with bulky gatekeepers (found just
downstream of the catalytic lysine in a Yoo*xooxGGELFxxI motif, where o is hydrophobic, x is any, and *
is the gatekeeper), but CpCDPK1 is expected to be sensitive to such inhibitors owing to the presence of a glycine instead of the typical methionine present in the
remaining CpCDPKs. Accordingly, over a dozen PP1
derivatives were found that inhibit CpCDPK1 with
IC50’s less than 10 nM (Table 3).

Structural characterization of select CpCDPKs

The CDPKs have a range of different type of domain
organizations, as shown in Table 1. To date, C. parvum
and T. gondii CDPK structures solved include KD, CAD
(including 4-EF hands), and intact KD-CAD (with and
without calcium bound). Herein, we present the solved
KD structures from CpCDPK1, CpCDPK2, and
CpCDPK4 (Figure 3 and Table 4).
CpCDPK1 and CpCDPK3 structures

The structures of CpCDPK1 [PDB: 3IGO] and CpCDPK3
[PDB: 3LIJ] with both the KD and CAD domains intact
have been solved by our group. These and other CDPK
structures including calcium-free and calcium-bound
forms have been used to describe a model for the activation of the CDPK family of enzymes and to characterize
the CAD domain, a novel member of the EF-hand containing family, whose structure has also been solved for
CpCDPK3 [PDB: 3L19] [27,28]. The exploitation of the
CpCDPK1 ATP-binding site featuring a glycine-gatekeeper has also been described in detail including its corresponding full length kinase structure with inhibitors
bound [PDB: 3NCG and 3MWU] [13]. Herein, we have
solved the KD structure of CpCDPK1 [PDB: 3DFA] in
apo form as well as with a PP1-derivative (1-tert-butyl-3(3-methylbenzyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-amine,
3MB-PP1) bound [PDB: 2WEI]. The overall fold of the
KD structures with and without the PP1 derivative
bound are similar (Figure 4A). In both structures, the glycine-rich loop is clamped down reflective of the activated
form, the tip of which (containing Phe87, all numbering
from full length and same as for PDB: 2WEI) is tucked
into a pocket created by the crossing of b-sheet 3 and the
residues just prior to the activation loop. The activation
loop, which moves closer to the active site in the 3MB-

PP1 structure sits lower and retains an additional turn at
the top of the a-helix G in the apo structure. The pyrazolo-pyrimidine in the PP1 molecule occupies the same
space where the adenine in ATP is typically found, forming H-bonds with the backbone of Glu153 and Tyr155
(Figure 4B). N8 of the 3MB-PP1 is linked by a water to
the activating Lys105. The large, hydrophobic methylbenzyl group of 3MB-PP1 sits deep within the pocket lined
by Leu222, Leu138, Ile150, and Met136. In most other
kinases, this pocket is ablated by the side-chain of a large
gatekeeper residue.
CpCDPK2 structure

CpCDPK2 comprises an N-terminal domain that is predicted to bind a carbohydrate, KD, and the CAD. We
have solved the crystal structures of CpCDPK2 KD with
indirubin E804 (3-({[(3S)-3,4-dihydroxybutyl]oxy}
amino)-1H,2’H-2,3’-biindol-2’-one) bound [PDB: 3F3Z],
as well as the apo form [PDB: 2QG5]. Both structures
have completely ordered activation loops, with a-helix C
of the indirubin-bound structure not completely in the
activated form (Figure 5). There is a dramatic difference
in glycine-rich loops between the apo and the indirubinbound structures. In the apo form, the loop is moved
up and away from the activation site, adopting a conformation less amenable to binding ATP. With the indirubin-bound structure, the backbone atoms from the loop
move up to 8 Å closer to the active site. Once again, the
indole moiety is interacting with the backbone hinge
residues Glu103 and Cys105 (numbering is identical in
both structures, but 194 less than full length numbering). The hydroxyl groups from the “tail” of the indirubin form a series of H-bonds with residues from the Clobe of the catalytic domain. Glu109 is pulled up by this
interaction, such that the a-helix D is more ordered and

structure, the Zn-finger and b-mesh position are shown. In the CpMAP-1 structure, the unusually long a-L16 helix is shown.

contains an additional turn compared to the a-helix D
from the apo structure.
CpCDPK4 structure

The KD structure of CpCDPK4 has been solved in the
presence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue (phosphoaminophosphonic acid-adenylate ester) [PDB:
3HKO]. Sequence alignment shows that CpCDPK4 has
a unique insert within the kinase domain that is particularly cysteine-rich in the centre: 101 LNVFIDDSTGKCAMDVVKTQICPCPECNEEAINGSIHGFRES140 (with
all numbering from PDB: 3HKO which is 125 less than
full length numbering). This insert is situated between
the hinge region and a-helix F. It consists of an antiparallel b-mesh that interacts with the helical C-lobe of
the KD and a helix that interacts with the N-terminal blobe (Figure 6A). Embedded in the helix is a zinc ion
coordinated by His93, Cys122, Cys124 and Cys127 (Figure 6B). This zinc finger is not present in any other

known protein KD, based on searches by sequence and
structure (also from personal communications with Gerald Manning and Stefan Knapp), making the insert particularly interesting and unique.
When CpCDPK4 is overlaid with the structure of
PKC-ι [PDB: 3A8W] that includes the C-terminal residues, we see that the zinc finger lies within the same
vicinity as the C-terminal tail of PKC-ι (Figure 6D). This
tail is believed to bring a hydrophobic residue, Phe543
into van der Waals contact with the adenosine head of
ATP and the tail forms H-bonds with the glycine-rich
loop, thereby ensuring an activated state for PKC-ι [49].
The zinc finger of CpCDPK4 is in the vicinity of the Nlobe and the exact volume occupied by the PKC-ι Cterminal tail. Instead of a phenylalanine, however, an
isoleucine (Ile121) is in position to maintain the more
hydrophobic area for the adenosine head group. In addition, for human CLK1 and CLK3 (PDB: 1X57 and
2EU9, respectively), the C-terminal lobe bears an

insertion between the two sheets b7 and b8, termed the
CLK-specific bhp-bhp’ hairpin, and renders the substrate docking groove inaccessible (as compared to the
substrates of MAPK which are able to access a similar
groove) [50]. Although the CLK-specific hairpin partially
overlaps with the b-mesh portion of the CpCDPK4
insert, it is distinct in orientation and lacks sequence
identity to the CpCDPK4 insert (Figure 6E). Thirdly,
although using a deletion mutant to obtain the crystal
structure of human SRPK1 that truncates the N-terminus by 41 residues and eliminates a spacer of 217 residues (residues 256-473), there is some overlap between
the location of the remaining spacer and the CpCDPK4

insert (Figure 6F). There are two small motifs that share
sequence identity between the CpCDPK4 insert and
SPRK, specifically 119TxIxxxP125 and 128NExxI132 (numbering from PDB: 3HKO), but only the latter shares spatial and structural similarity, forming the first a-helix in
each insert structure but in a nearly orthogonal orientation. For SPRK, the two spacer inserts identified in the
structure are necessary for maintaining an active conformation [51]. Although these other inserts have been
identified, only further research will determine what
particular role both the zinc finger and b-mesh play in
the regulation of CpCDPK4. However, the location and
other aspects of the b-mesh suggest that it may affect

the activation loop is disordered with residues from 175
to 189 absent.

the activation state of this kinase in a specific way. To
illustrate, the b-mesh formed downstream of the zinc
finger is indeed novel in that its C-terminal side forms
part of the a-helix D. This helix consists of less than
two turns, and at the head features a histidine (His96)
that is in H-bonding distance with the alcohol groups of
the ribose ring. This position is typically taken up by a
glutamate in catalytically active kinases. Additionally,
when overlaid with the inactive form of a more prototypical CDPK with the CAD domain (TgCDPK1
[PDB:3KU2]), we can see that the bottom of this bmesh would interfere sterically with the inhibitory CH1
helix of the CDPK (Figure 6C). All in all, this suggests
that the zinc-bound form of this particular CDPK could
be constitutively active, as a reversion to the inactive
state would be blocked. Attempts to find structures,
either active or inactive of the CpCDPK4 with CAD
domain intact are underway.
CpMAP-1 structure

The CpMAP-1 structure [PDB: 3OZ6] was solved in the
absence of any ATP mimic or inhibitor, and as such the
glycine-rich loop, which interacts with b- and g-phosphates of the ATP, is disordered at the tip in our structure (Figure 7). In comparison with a prototypical
MAPK, such as ERK2, the MAPK-specific helix L16 is
longer in our structure, and forms more hydrophobic
interactions with the a-helix C. The activation loop is
moved out of position and no phosphorylation states
have been found in the electron density. As is typical
with structures lacking ATP/mimic, a good portion of

Conclusions
Overall, protozoan kinases are appealing drug targets, as
many are already known to be involved in essential cell
cycle regulation; and there is an enormous availability of
inhibitors from the extensive work done on human
kinase targets. There are several examples of specific
kinases to be considered for further investigation with
respect to their potential in C. parvum drug design, as
their orthologues in Plasmodium and Toxoplasma perform critical functions (see Additional File 1, Table S1
for C. parvum orthologues). For example, PfPKG is
essential in the blood stage and in gametogenesis of P.
falciparum infection [22,23], as well, TgPKG is the likely
target of an anti-toxoplasmosis compound [52]. PfMRK
and PfPK5, respectively, are inhibited by compounds
that also modestly inhibit P. falciparum growth [34].
TgCK1a is inhibited by aminopurvalanol A which also
inhibits parasite cell growth [31]. PfCRK is crucial to
intraerythrocytic development [37]. PfMAP-2 is essential
to the asexual cycle of P. falciparum [40]. PfCK2a has
been shown to be crucial to the asexual blood state in
Plasmodium [44]. Finally, PfTKL-3 is essential for asexual parasite proliferation in human erythrocytes [45].
Other potential C. parvum kinase targets to consider
include those where there is precedence for preferential
inhibition of the parasite kinase (including P. falciparum
and T. gondii) over the human orthologue. For example
TgCK1a is selectively inhibited by purvalanol B and
aminopurvalanol A over host CK enzymes [31]. As well,
a range of compound classes that are CDK inhibitors in
P. falciparum are not effective against the human CDK
enzymes tested [34]. Upon analysis of the kinase
sequences of P. falciparum, T. gondii, and C. parvum
herein, we find other non-kinase features that should
prompt new drug targets to be selected for study. Several C. parvum kinases include large (and often multiple) inserts and/or N- and C-terminal extensions that
can be hundreds residues long, but are not conserved
and are generally of unknown function. This includes
the 40-residue insert in the KD of CpCDPK4 which was
structurally identified, herein, as a zinc finger and is suspected to be involved in maintaining its calcium-dependent activity. In addition, there is generally low
sequence identity and deviations from the most conserved motifs in the C. parvum protein kinases as compared to its orthologues. All of these factors provide
additional parameters that can be explored and potentially exploited for drug design not only for cryptosporidiosis, but also for the other protozoan infections.
The high degree of conservation amongst protein
kinases, particularly in the ATP-binding site, challenges

the general goal of finding selective inhibitors. Nevertheless, the adaptation of particular kinases, for example
the CDPK enzymes to specific calcium-binding conditions and other regulatory factors, their localization, and
their substrate specificity, adds another dimension to
the development of inhibitors, thus mitigating the overall kinase drug discovery process. Our structural and
biochemical studies of CDPK enzymes further illuminate
some of these possibilities with respect to drug design.
The exploitation of the gatekeeper in the ATP-binding
site shows that opportunities exist for inhibitor design,
as is the case for CpCDPK1 which has a glycine-gatekeeper and is inhibited in the nanomolar range by PP1derivatives. Indeed, our crystal structure highlights how
one of these inhibitors functions. CpCDPK2 structural
analysis shows how a flexible CDK inhibitor can bind
and gives a starting point for future development of

novel CDPK2 inhibitors. CpCDPK4 has a unique zinc
finger and special b-mesh configuration that may indicate that it can become persistently active, providing an
additional mechanism of regulation to the CaMK family
that adds another element to the CDPK drug discovery
pathway.
For some time it has been known that the CDPK
enzymes control crucial functions including transcription, metabolism, ion pumps and channels, and the
cytoskeleton [53]. With respect to the protozoan CDPK
enzymes, many have been now associated with particular functions. For example, with respect to Plasmodium,
PfCDPK1, first identified in the asexual blood stage [54],
is involved in the regulation of the motor complex and
possibly essential for P. falciparum viability [55,56].
PfCDPK3 is implicated in sexual stage specific events
[57] and more specifically (for PbCDPK3) in a signalling

expedited by considering the kinase classification as presented herein, whereby potential targets are considered
not only in the context of their family, but also with
respect to their orthologues, a strategy that has streamlined many successful structural genomics projects.

pathway that regulates ookinete penetration of the layer
covering the midgut epithelium and a possibly an ookinete-limited essential function [58,59]. PbCDPK4 is
essential for male gametogenesis [60]. PfCDPK5 plays an
essential role during the blood stage of malaria replication via egress from erythrocytes [61]. PbCDPK6 is critical for the conversion to an invasive P. berghei
phenotype [62]. In T. gondii, knocking out TgCDPK1 by
genetic or chemical means indicates that it is an essential regulator of calcium-dependent exocytosis, specifically leading to the inhibition micronemes secretion that
results in a block of essential phenotypes including parasite motility, host-cell invasion, and egress. As well,
TgCDPK3 has been suggested to participate in the motility of T. gondii through the phosphorylation of glideosome complex member [63]. These results demonstrate
the numerous examples of how crucial CDPK enzymes
are in both P. falciparum and T. gondii, and as such
suggest that C. parvum CDPK enzymes may also be
associated with essential functions and should be among
the targets of cryptosporidiosis drug discovery programs.
Finally, there are huge untapped kinase sources for
drug design, as almost a quarter of the C. parvum
kinome has no known orthologue outside of Cryptosporidium spp. In addition, the OPK group comprises 40%
of the C. parum kinome, undoubtedly there are unique
features within this group to exploit. With numerous
kinase inhibitor libraries available, characterization (biochemical and structural) and screening of these kinases
may result in the identification of novel targets, potentially without human orthologues, thus greatly facilitating the course of drug discovery. This research can be

To identify protein kinases in the C. parvum genome, a
search for various protein kinase domains was conducted using the CryptoDB Version 4.3 http://www.
cryptodb.org domain search utility [21]. Furthermore, a
search for the keyword “kinase” was used. This generated a list of 99 candidates. The presence of a protein
kinase domain was confirmed by examining their CryptoDB records, leading to elimination of non-protein
kinases, regulatory proteins or other non-kinases. The
remaining sequences were analysed manually to confirm
the presence of a complete catalytic triad resulting in a
final list of 73 kinases. Other protein domains and
domain architectures were determined by ProSite http://
prosite.expasy.org/[64]. Orthologue group assignments
were made by OrthoMCL (Version: 3.0) [65]. The kinase
domain sequences of all the CpPKs and the following
structures (PDB: 2WEI, 2QG5, 3HKO, 2QKR, 3EB0, and
3OZ6) were submitted for multiple sequence alignment
to the PROMALS3D multiple sequence and structure
alignment server http://prodata.swmed.edu/promals3d/
promals3d.php[66]. The alignment results were slightly
adjusted manually in the cases of cgd6_4960, cgd2_2310,
cgd7_2000, and cgd2_3890, so that the presumed catalytic lysines were aligned (Additional File 2, Table S2).
The adjusted alignment was used in the calculation of
the phylogenetic inferences by RAxML BlackBox http://
phylobench.vital-it.ch/raxml-bb/index.php[67]. The
resulting best scoring ML (maximum-likelihood) tree
with branch lengths and support values was submitted
to the Interactive Tree of Life Version 2.0.1 website
http://itol.embl.de for the rendering of the phylogenetic
tree [68]. The same procedure was completed for the
analysis of the CDPK family (Additional File 2, Table
