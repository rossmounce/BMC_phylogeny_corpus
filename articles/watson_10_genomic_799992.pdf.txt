Genomic organization of duplicated short wavesensitive and long wave-sensitive opsin genes in
the green swordtail, Xiphophorus helleri

Abstract
Background: Long wave-sensitive (LWS) opsin genes have undergone multiple lineage-specific duplication events
throughout the evolution of teleost fishes. LWS repertoire expansions in live-bearing fishes (family Poeciliidae) have
equipped multiple species in this family with up to four LWS genes. Given that color vision, especially attraction to
orange male coloration, is important to mate choice within poeciliids, LWS opsins have been proposed as
candidate genes driving sexual selection in this family. To date the genomic organization of these genes has not
been described in the family Poeciliidae, and little is known about the mechanisms regulating the expression of
LWS opsins in any teleost.
Results: Two BAC clones containing the complete genomic repertoire of LWS opsin genes in the green swordtail
fish, Xiphophorus helleri, were identified and sequenced. Three of the four LWS loci identified here were linked in a
tandem array downstream of two tightly linked short wave-sensitive 2 (SWS2) opsin genes. The fourth LWS opsin
gene, containing only a single intron, was not linked to the other three and is the product of a retrotransposition
event. Genomic and phylogenetic results demonstrate that the LWS genes described here share a common
evolutionary origin with those previously characterized in other poeciliids. Using qualitative RT-PCR and MSP we
showed that each of the LWS and SWS2 opsins, as well as three other cone opsin genes and a single rod opsin
gene, were expressed in the eyes of adult female and male X. helleri, contributing to six separate classes of adult
retinal cone and rod cells with average lmax values of 365 nm, 405 nm, 459 nm, 499 nm, 534 nm and 568 nm.
Comparative genomic analysis identified two candidate teleost opsin regulatory regions containing putative CRX
binding sites and hormone response elements in upstream sequences of LWS gene regions of seven teleost
species, including X. helleri.
Conclusions: We report the first complete genomic description of LWS and SWS2 genes in poeciliids. These data
will serve as a reference for future work seeking to understand the relationship between LWS opsin genomic
organization, gene expression, gene family evolution, sexual selection and speciation in this fish family.

Background
In order to link the fields of evolutionary genetics and
behavioral ecology it is critical to understand the influences of genes on behavior [1]. This is especially important for understanding the processes of sexual selection
and speciation [2,3]. Opsins are unique among genes
known to influence behavior in that it is possible to
make explicit mechanistic links between polymorphisms
at the amino acid level, wavelength sensitivity at the

receptor level, and phenotypic variation at the behavioral level [4]. Opsin genes have recently received a
great deal of attention for their roles in mate choice,
population divergence and speciation in African cichlids
[reviewed in [5]], and have also been posited as candidate genes influencing behavior and sexual selection in
the guppy and related species [6-8]. This is not surprising given that variation in opsin genes has facilitated the
evolution of color vision across vertebrates [9,10].
Vertebrate opsins make up an intermediate-sized gene
family that code for a diverse group of G proteincoupled receptors that initiate light absorbance and

phototransduction through their interaction with one of
two vitamin-A derived chromophore pigments [9]. The
type of chromophore used as well as changes at key
amino acid sites in the opsin protein are known to contribute to differences in the wavelength of light that is
maximally absorbed (lmax) [9]. Cone opsins, which are
expressed in cone photoreceptor cells of the retina and
responsible for mediating photopic vision, are comprised
of four classes able to absorb light at different wavelengths across the spectrum. These are short wave-sensitive opsins (SWS1: ultraviolet to blue, and SWS2: violet
to blue), medium to long wave-sensitive opsins (MWS
or LWS: green to red), and rhodopsin-like opsins (RH2:
blue to green), all of which were present in the most
recent common vertebrate ancestor. The number of
functional opsin classes observed in extant vertebrates
varies from species to species, contributing to interspecific variation in visual potential [9,10].
In fishes, the evolution of color vision has been directed by opsin gene duplication and diversification, pseudogenization and differential gene expression [11]. This
has allowed many species to evolve opsin repertoires
and accompanying visual systems that best exploit the
photic environments in which they live [12-14]. Furthermore, it is well established in many species that color
vision plays a direct role in mate choice and sexual
selection [15-18].
Fish in the family Poeciliidae, which includes the
guppy and close relatives (Poecilia spp.), as well as
swordtails and platyfishes (Xiphophorus spp.), are long
standing models for the study of sexual selection, as
both male secondary sexual characteristics and female
mate choice are highly variable traits within the group
[19-23]. In Poecilia, and less so in Xiphophorus, male
coloration is known to affect female mate choice,
although this is perhaps best understood in guppies
where females show consistent preferences for males
with orange and red color spots [15,24-26]. Furthermore, guppy female preference is known to differ
between individuals within and across populations
[27-29]. Using microspectrophotometry (MSP), Archer
et al. [30] and Archer and Lythgoe [31] provided early
mechanistic evidence for variation in guppy visual systems, indentifying expansions in the long wave-sensitive
visual capacity of guppies, as well as variation between
individuals in the number of long wave visual pigments
observed in the retina. Interestingly, molecular data suggest that Xiphophorus and Poecilia species have
expanded their LWS opsin repertoires through gene
duplication [6-8] corroborating this expansion in long
wavelength sensitivity suggested by MSP. Within these
poeciliid species, opsin duplication and diversification
appears to be highest in Poecilia species, which have at
least four different LWS gene subtypes, compared to

Page 2 of 17

that of Xiphophorus pygmaeus, the only Xiphophorus
species so far investigated with regard to LWS repertoire, which appears to possess only three [8].
Despite recent molecular work in poeciliids, no complete LWS genomic repertoire has been described in any
of these species. Obtaining a full description of LWS
opsins at the genomic level, including genomic organization, total gene copy number and intergenic sequences,
will be an important step in elucidating the role that
these genes have played in the evolution of this family,
whether through gene duplication and divergence, or
through differences in gene expression. To date, the
genomic organization of cone opsins has been fully
characterized in two other teleosts: the zerbrafish, Danio
rerio [32], and medaka, Oryzias latipes [33]. Two LWS
copies have been identified in each species [32,33].
Genomic data for LWS loci are also available in the
Ensembl release 56 [34] for Gasterosteus aculeatus
(stickleback), Tetraodon nigroviridis (Tetraodon) and
Takifugu rubripes (fugu), each of which possesses only a
single LWS gene. Additionally, the LWS genes are linked
to at least a single SWS2 opsin gene in all five of the teleost species mentioned above [32-34]. The genomic
organization of LWS opsins has also been described in
mammals and has contributed a great deal to the understanding of their evolution and function [35-38]. In
humans, the characterization of MWS/LWS opsin gene
organization has enabled the identification of regulatory
regions essential for the proper expression of these
genes and has been vital to the discovery of associations
between opsin mutations and human color vision
abnormalities [39-42].
In this study we screened bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries to characterize the genomic organization of LWS and SWS2 opsins in the green
swordtail, Xiphophorus helleri, which represents the first
complete description of these genes in a member of the
family Poeciliidae. We also characterized the spectral
sensitivity of adult male and female retinae from this
species with MSP and assessed the expression of opsin
subtypes by PCR screening of whole eye total RNA.
Additionally, using opsin intergenic sequences and
cross-species comparisons to other teleosts, we identified potential distal gene regulatory elements including a
tentative teleost LWS opsin Locus Control Region
(LCR), analogous to LCRs previously described for
mammalian and other teleost opsin loci.

Methods
BAC Library screening

For this study we used the X. helleri Bacterial Artificial
Chromosome (BAC) library, VMRC27, previously constructed from 12 X. helleri males of the Rio Sarabia strain,
representing a12-fold genome coverage [43]. Filters and

Watson et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:87
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/87

BAC clones from this library were obtained from the Childrenâs Hospital of Oakland Research Institute (CHORI;
Oakland, CA, USA). Using LWS gene sequences from Poecilia reticulata [8], a 60-mer LWS opsin specific probe
(lwsprobe: ACAGCAAAGTTCAAGAAACTTCGTCATCCTCTCAACTGGATCTTGGTCAACCTTGCCATT) was designed from a portion of exon 2 exhibiting
high sequence similarity between LWS subtypes (100%
sequence identity-S180, A180 and P180 subtypes; 91%
sequence identity-S180r subtype). Both the LWS opsin
probe and overgo probe (designed to hybridize to filter
âanchor spotsâ for filter orientation) were end-labelled
using 32P-ATP and T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (InvitrogenÂ®). BAC filter screening was conducted as described by
Johnstone et al. [44]. Briefly, filter hybridization was carried out overnight at 65Â°C in 5 Ã SSC, 5 Ã Denhardtâs
solution, and 0.5% SDS. Filters were subsequently washed
three times for 60 minutes at 50Â°C in 1Ã SSC and 0.1%
SDS solution. Hybridized filters were visualized using a
Storm 860 phosphoimager (Molecular DynamicsÂ®).
BAC clone characterization and sequencing

The presence of a LWS opsin in the BAC clones was
confirmed by PCR using LWS specific primers (see
Additional file 1). BAC shotgun libraries were constructed as described by Johnstone et al. [44]. DNA was
isolated from BAC clones shown by PCR to possess
LWS and SWS2 loci (VMRC27-80H16, VMRC27186P13) using a QIAGEN Large-Construct kit. Following isolation the BAC DNA was sonicated, end-repaired,
and size selected to 2-5 kb by gel electrophoresis and
extracted using a QIAQuick gel purification kit (QIAGENÂ®). Size selected BAC DNA was ligated into Sma I
digested, alkaline phosphatase treated pUC19 and used
to transform XL1-Blue Supercompetent E. coli cells
(StratageneÂ®). 1,152 hybrid recombinant clones from the
VMRC27-186P13 BAC shotgun library and 1,536 clones
from the VMRC27-80H16 BAC shotgun library were
sequenced bidirectionally (approximately 1000 bp per
clone), providing approximately 7 Ã and 10 Ã BAC
clone coverage, based on the previously reported average
BAC clone insert size of 160 kb [43]. BAC fingerprint
contig data [45], and BAC shotgun library sequences
were generated at the Michael Smith Genome Sciences
Centre (Vancouver, BC, Canada).
BAC sequence assembly and annotation

Sequences from shotgun libraries were assembled and
viewed using the Phred/Phrap and Consed packages
[46-48]. The GRASP Annotation Pipeline [49-58] was
used for gene annotation (see Additional File 1 for more
details). LWS nomenclature used for this study was
adopted from Ward et al. [8]. LWS subtypes were differentiated by their âfive-siteâ haplotypes [59], and each

Page 3 of 17

named for the amino acid found at the codon position
representing the human â180â site. Codon position
â180â is one of five key amino acid sites previously
shown to contribute to shifts in spectral sensitivity of
MWS/LWS opsin proteins in vertebrates [59]. In the
case of the LWS subtypes reported here, âSâ denotes a
Serine, and âPâ denotes a Proline at site â180â. Names
assigned to all other genes, including SWS2 opsins, were
based on the top BLASTn results and sequence similarity to genes previously reported in other teleost species.
SeqManPro (Lasergene 8.0, DNASTAR) was also used
for sequence alignments containing BAC assembly consensus sequences and predicted gene sequences.
RNA extraction and qualitative RT-PCR

One male and one female X. helleri from the Rio Sarabia strain obtained from the Xiphophorus Genetic Stock
Center (San Marcos, TX, USA) were euthanized in
NaHCO3 buffered Tricaine Methanesulfonate (MS-222).
The eyes were removed and total RNA was isolated
from male and female specimens separately using the
PureLinkâ¢ Micro-to-Midi Total RNA Purification kit
(InvitrogenÂ®). Purified RNA was treated with DNase I as
per manufacturerâs specifications (FermentasÂ®), and firststrand cDNA synthesis was carried out using 0.2 ug of
DNase I-treated total RNA, Oligo dT and SuperScriptâ¢
II Reverse Transcriptase (InvitrogenÂ®). Using locus specific primers, female and male whole eye cDNA was
screened by PCR for the presence or absence of transcripts representing opsin subtypes, as well as the
gephyrin gene (GPHN; explained below). Gene PCR
fragments were either sequenced directly after PCR purification or cloned and sequenced (see Additional File 1
for PCR primers). A two round, nested PCR approach
was utilized to amplify products for SWS2A, RH2-2 and
SWS1 opsins. In the case of SWS2A no visible product
was produced in the first round, and amplification
required a second round of PCR with internal primers.
Visible products for both RH2-2 and SWS1 opsins were
produced in first round PCRs, but internal primers were
used in a second round to increase locus specificity for
direct sequencing of PCR products. In all 2 nd round
PCR reactions 1:10 dilutions of the 1st round PCR products were used. Cloning of PCR products was carried
out using a TOPO TA CloningÂ® kit with pCRÂ®2.1TOPOÂ® vector and One ShotÂ® chemically competent
TOP10 E. coli cells (InvitrogenÂ®), and purified using a
QIAprepÂ®Miniprep kit (QIAGENÂ®). PCR products and
clones were sequenced at Molecular Cloning Laboratories (MCLAB; San Francisco, CA, USA).
Microspectrophotometry

MSP was conducted following standard methodology, as
described in Loew [60]. Two male and two female

X. helleri individuals (Rio Sarabia strain) were darkadapted overnight before being euthanized in NaHCO3buffered MS-222. All procedures were carried out in a
darkroom with minimal infrared illumination to prevent
bleaching of the photoreceptor cells. Retinas were dissected from the eyes of each fish and placed on a glass
slide in a drop of phosphate buffer (pH 7.2 plus 6.0%
sucrose) where they were macerated using two razor
blades to free the photoreceptor cells and make them
accessible for spectrographic measurement. Using
a computer-controlled single beam instrument with a
100 W tungsten-halogen lamp, a 40 Ã mirror objective
lens as the condenser, and a 100 Ã LOMO lens as the
objective, individual photoreceptor cell outer segments
were scanned from 750 to 350 nm and back at 1.0 nm
intervals with odd nm scanned on the downward pass
and even nm on the return pass. The selection criteria
used for data inclusion into the lmax analysis pool were
the same as those used by Loew [60]. Each acceptable
spectrum was smoothed prior to normalization using a
digital filter routine (âsmooftâ)[61]. For curves meeting
the selection criteria, the lmax (the wavelength at maximum absorbance for a template-derived visual pigment
best fitting the experimental data) of the smoothed, normalized (using Xmax) visual pigment absorbance spectrum was obtained using the method of Mansfield as
presented by MacNichol [62]. The templates used were
those of Lipetz and Cronin [63]. A template curve generated using the calculated l max was overlaid on the
raw, unsmoothed data and visually examined for fit.
Phylogenetic analyses

LWS and SWS2 opsin coding sequences were obtained
from GenBank. LWS and SWS2 sequences were aligned
separately using ClustalW [64] within software package
eBioX1.5.1 [65]. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted
using PAUP* 4.0 [66]. Trees were reconstructed using
Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Neighbor Joining (NJ)
methods. Reconstruction of the LWS opsin NJ tree
employed the General time reversible (GTR) model (with
Rate Heterogeneity, alpha = 0.916; Proportion of Invariant Sites = 0.332). Likewise the GTR model (with Rate
Heterogeneity, alpha = 0.505) was used to construct the
SWS2 opsin NJ phylogeny. Best-fit models were chosen
using PhyML within the program TOPALi v2 [67]. Missing data were considered using the Pair-wise-Deletion
option in the analyses, and node support was calculated
using 1000 bootstrap replications for both the MP
and NJ trees. MP analyses employed the heuristic nearneighbor-interchange search method. For the LWS phylogenies, sequences under the following accession
numbers were used: Poecilia reticulata EU329431,
EU329445, EU329453 and EU329457; Poecilia bifurca
EU329460, EU329461, EU329465 and EU329466; Poecilia

well as the Xiphophorus helleri SWS2 sequences characterized here.
Teleost gene synteny and LCR candidate search

We used web based Genomicus synteny browser [68]
and Ensembl genome browsers [34] to assess the synteny between regions sequenced for X. helleri in this
study and five other teleost genomes for which data
were available (Ensembl assembly versions: medakaHdrR; stickleback-BROAD S1; Tetraodon-TETRAODON 8.0; fugu-FUGU 4.0; zebrafish-Zv8). Only genes
annotated in these assembly versions were considered
for our synteny comparison. Likewise, for the LWS regulatory region candidate search, we used available
sequence from each of the species listed above, as well
as from Pundamilia pundamilia [4], a species of African
cichlid. Intergenic sequences between SWS2 and the closest LWS gene from all seven species were analyzed
using multipipmaker [69] to locate regions of high
sequence conservation (See Additional file 1 for
sequences used in the analysis). Identification of potential transcription factor binding sites was done by eye
from aligned sequences, using previously identified consensus binding sites for transcription factors with
known involvement in opsin gene regulation [70-72].

Results and Discussion
Xiphophorus helleri opsin genomic organization and
gene structure

Using a single 60 bp LWS specific probe designed from
previously reported LWS sequences [6-8] we detected

Watson et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:87
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/87

16 BAC clones positive for LWS opsin genes from the
X. helleri BAC library, VMRC-27 [43]. HindIII fingerprint analysis clustered the 16 BAC clones into two
separate fingerprint contigs containing 11 (Contig I) and
five clones (Contig II), respectively. The segregation of
BAC clones into two separate contigs was expected due
to the fact that one of the three previously reported
LWS genes in Xiphophorus pygmaeus is thought to be a
retrotransposed gene (S180r) [8]. Because retrogenes are
usually inserted into regions that are not linked to their
ancestral copies [73] we predicted that one of the two
fingerprint contigs represented the retrogene locus. To
test this hypothesis we used LWS locus specific primers
(Additional file 1) to screen each of the 16 BAC clones
by PCR for the presence of the LWS retrogene, S180r,
and the two other previously reported LWS opsins in
Xiphophorus, S180 and P180 [8]. All of the Contig II
BAC clones tested positive only for the LWS retrogene,
S180r, whereas each of the Contig I BAC clones were
positive for either one or both of the other two LWS
genes but not for S180r. Subsequently, because LWS
genes are linked to SWS2 opsins in other teleosts, we
tested Contig I BACs for the presence of SWS2A and
SWS2B opsins using consensus primers designed from
guppy (DQ234860), Lucania goodei (AY296736,
AY296737), medaka (AB223056, AB223057), and cichlid
(AF247120, AF247116) SWS2A and SWS2B opsin
sequences. A single BAC clone from Contig I
(VMRC27-186P13) that was positive for all SWS2 and
LWS opsin PCR primer sets and a single BAC clone
from Contig II (VMRC27-80H16) were chosen for shotgun library construction and sequencing, from which we
identified complete sequences of four LWS (S180-1;
S180-2; P180;S180r)and two SWS2 (SWS2A, SWS2B)
opsin genes (Fig. 1).
BAC clone VMRC27-186P13 (GenBank accession:
GQ999832) assembled into two ordered sequence contigs 109 kb and 55 kb in length, and contained a linked
gene cluster of three LWS (S180-1; S180-2; P180) and
two SWS2 opsins (SWS2A; SWS2B; Fig. 1A). The two
highly similar S180 genes with 99% shared coding
sequence identity flank the P180 gene on either side.
S180-2 and P180 are positioned on the chromosome in
a tail-to-tail orientation, 3,718 bp apart, an organization
previously described in Poecilia [8]. S180-1 is located
5,400 bp upstream of P180. The two SWS2 copies are
tightly linked 1,893 bp apart, and reside 8,563 bp
upstream of S180-1. S180 and P180 subtypes have been
described in the genus Poecilia, in X. pygmaeus [8] and
in the anablepid, Jenysia onca [74]. It should also be
mentioned that sequence in the 3â portion of the S180g
subtype in another anablepid, Anableps anableps, shares
high sequence similarity with P180 genes observed in
Poecilia species [75]. The A. anableps S180g is the likely

Page 5 of 17

result of gene conversion [75]. Given that the P180 subtype has been identified in J. onca, and at least partially
in A. anableps, the duplication event that produced this
locus most likely precedes the split of Poeciliidae and
Anablepidae [74,75]. Moreover, the tail-to-tail organization of X. helleri S180-2 and P180 is identical to that of
S180 and P180 genes described in P. reticulata,
P. parae, P. picta, and P. bifurca [8]. This provides
strong evidence that these genes are orthologs. However,
the organization has not been characterized for the S180
and P180 subtypes described in anablepids [74,75] nor
those described in X. pygamaeus [8]. It is therefore
unclear whether the S180 genes described in these species are orthologous to the X. helleri S180-2 locus or
S180-1 locus. The genomic organization of the SWS2A
and SWS2B genes has not been described in any other
poeciliid to date; however, SWS2 genes are also linked
to LWS genes in many other species (see below).
The second sequenced BAC clone, VMRC27-80H16
(GenBank accession: GQ999833), assembled into a single 162 kb sequence contig (Fig. 1B) and revealed the
presence of a fourth LWS opsin, an ortholog of the
S180r gene previously described in Poecilia, Xiphophorus
and Lucania [7,8] and two species from the family
Anablepidae [74,75]. It is presumed to be the result of a
retrotransposition event as no introns have been observed
in PCR products generated from genomic DNA of any
of the genera mentioned above [8,74,75]. Until our
study only exons II through VI of the S180r retroposed
gene had been described, and based on the lack of
introns it was postulated that this was a completely
intronless gene. Here we provide a more complete
description of this gene, including a first exon that is
homologous to exon I of the other LWS genes described
here and a single intron. Analyses of human retroduplicates have shown that some retrogenes acquire introns
de novo following their insertion back into the genome
[76-78]. However, in this case the S180r exon I and
intron I structure and organization are homologous to
that observed in X. helleri S180-1 and S180-2. This
homology indicates the S180r intron was likely not
acquired post duplication, but instead suggests that
reverse transcription and genome reinsertion occurred
before the first exon of the ancestral LWS mRNA transcript had been spliced out. However, the former hypothesis of post duplication intron gain cannot be completely
discounted.
This study provides the first examination of the genomic location of the S180r gene in relation to other LWS
gene family members. During the process of retrotransposition, retrogenes can be inserted into regions of the
genome unlinked to their ancestral copy and in many
cases are inserted into exons or introns of other genes
[73]. In line with this trend, we have shown that S180r

identified here as gephyrin (GPHN). Additionally,
because GPHN and surrounding genes are not linked to
the LWS/SWS2 gene cluster in other teleosts (see
below), it is likely that S180r is not linked to the other
X. helleri LWS genes identified in this study, further
supporting the hypothesis that S180r is the product of
retrotransposition.
LWS opsins S180-1, S180-2, and P180 contain six
exons and five introns (Fig. 2A). This feature is shared
across vertebrate MWS/LWS opsins [9]. Fig. 2A shows
that exon length is highly conserved across these three
LWS subtypes. However, introns I and III of P180 have
undergone increases in size, making them larger than
introns I and III of the S180-1 and S180-2 copies. The
S180r gene contains only a single intron. The first exon
and intron are similar in size to those of the other LWS
S180 genes, and exon II of S180r corresponds to exons
II through VI of the other three LWS genes (Fig. 2A).
Of the four LWS opsins, S180-1 and S180-2 are most
similar, differing by only one amino acid caused by a
single non-synonymous nucleotide change. However, the
genes encoding S180-1 and S180-2 are different within
the 5â and 3â untranslated regions (UTRs). Also shown
in Fig. 2A are the âfive-siteâ haplotypes for each LWS
subtype. The âfive-sitesâ rule has been well established
in the vertebrate opsin literature, and refers to five key
amino acid sites in the opsin protein that contribute to
significant changes in spectral sensitivity [59]. The three
S180 opsins share the same âfive-siteâ haplotype
(SHYTA), and are predicted to absorb light maximally

at the same wavelength, whereas the five site haplotype
of P180 (PHFAA) is different from that observed in the
S180 subtypes and is expected to have a different lmax.
It should be noted that S180r differs from the other two
S180 proteins outside the five key sites, sharing only
89% amino acid sequence identity. Weadick and Chang
[7] reported amino acid changes specific to the P. reticulata S180r protein compared to the other guppy LWS
subtypes (H247R, A248D, V249I, S256C, K261N, E263Q
and R264K), and suggested that this opsin may have
increased transducin binding ability, as changes at these
sites in bovine rhodopsin-although not the exact
changes mentioned above in all instances-are known to
be involved in transducin binding [79]. The same
changes reported for the guppy S180r protein are also
observed in the X. helleri S180r protein. Additionally,
S180-1 and S180-2 also contain a lysine at amino acid
site 264, in place of an arginine, which is found in all
non S180r LWS opsins reported in the guppy, as well as
the P180 opsin reported here for X. helleri.
X. helleri SWS2A and SWS2B genes have five exons
and four introns (Fig. 2B). A similar structure is found
in SWS2, SWS1 and RH2 genes described in other vertebrates [9]. Exon length in the two SWS2 genes reported
here is identical for exons I through IV, and differs by
only 3 bp in exon V. However, as is the case with the
LWS opsins described in this study, there are many differences in the length of introns between the two genes,
particularly in introns I and IV. All introns of the LWS
and SWS2 opsins reported here contain standard
(5â GT-AG 3â) splice sites.

Phylogenetic analysis of LWS and SWS2 sequences

Fig. 3 shows a Neighbor Joining (NJ) tree representing
LWS opsin evolution in Xiphophorus and Poecilia. As
only partial gene transcripts have been submitted for
multiple species and subtypes, sequence lengths used for
the analysis range from 621 bp to 1,083 bp. Included in
the phylogeny are all Poecilia and Xiphophorus LWS
sequences reported to date, as well as sequences for zebrafish, medaka, stickleback, Tetraodon and fugu, because
these species were used in synteny analyses (see below).
Multiple independent lineage-specific gene duplications
are shown in the tree for medaka, zebrafish and within
poeciliids. However, it should be noted that the duplication event leading to S180r predates the split of Fundulidae, Anablepidae and Poeciliidae [8,74,75]. Additionally,
at least two of the other LWS genes described in poeciliids and anablepids likely share a common origin
[74,75]. LWS duplications have also been identified in
other teleosts, including the blind cavefish, Astyanax
fasciatus [80] and Girella punctata [81]. Consistent with
Ward et al. [8], the poeciliid LWS opsins form three
clades. Each of the X. helleri LWS opsins characterized
in this study cluster with sequences from X. pygmaeus
and Poecilia speciesbased on opsin subtype, and one

interpretation of the analysis (Fig. 3) is that the X. helleri
S180-1 and S180-2 represent a gene duplication specific
to Xiphophorus.
It has also been suggested that the A180 haplotype,
which has so far only been observed in Poecilia species,
is the product of a genus-specific duplication followed
by partial gene conversion with the P180 locus [8].
However, as previously discussed by Ward et al. [8], the
Poecilia A180 sequences share high sequence similarity
with the S180 genes and do not form a single monophyletic group, but rather are interspersed within the clade
of S180 sequences. Our discovery of a second S180
locus in Xiphophorus suggests an alternative hypothesis
to that of two genus-specific duplications (one in Poecilia, producing A180 locus, and one in Xiphophrous, producing the second S180); it is possible that X. helleri
S180-1 and Poecilia A180 are orthologous loci that predate the Xiphophorus and Poecilia divergence. Under
this hypothesis Poecilia A180 is the result of gene diversification, as well as possible gene conversion with the
P180 locus following the divergence of A180 and S180.
Additionally, homogenization of X. helleri S180-1 and
S180-2 genes may have occurred after the divergence of
Poecilia and Xiphophorus. In support of this there is

ample evidence for gene conversion from both poeciliids
[8] and the closely related anablepids [74,75]. However,
data are needed from a wider range of species before
the effects of duplication, divergence and gene conversion can be rigorously evaluated.
For the SWS2 NJ tree (Fig. 4) we used SWS2 coding
sequences 412 bp to 1,089 bp in length from 20 species
representing a broad range of the teleostei lineage.
Unlike the LWS gene phylogeny, which is dominated by
multiple recent duplication events, the SWS2 phylogeny
depicts a much older origin for the X. helleri SWS2

opsin duplicates at the base of Acanthopterygii. This
finding is consistent with previously reported phylogenetic results [33,82,83]. It has also been previously noted
that multiple species within Acanthopterygii are represented in the phylogeny by a single SWS2 gene (Fig. 4),
representing either gene loss or incomplete descriptions
of the opsin gene repertoires in those species [33]. Interestingly, species outside of Acanthopterygii with only
single genes have evolved SWS2 genes to match the
spectral sensitivity ranges of either the SWS2A or
SWS2B genes observed in other species [11]. In the case

sequences depicted in the LWS and SWS2 NJ trees and
show only minor differences in topology (see Additional

X. helleri and teleost synteny

The results of gene synteny analyses between annotated
X. helleri BAC sequences and the corresponding regions
of five other teleost species are shown in Fig. 5A and 5B.
We identified eight complete gene sequences in the BAC
VMRC27-80H16, including the S180r retrotransposed
LWS opsin gene (Fig. 5A). S180r was not found at this
locus in any of the other five teleost genomes used for
comparison in this study. The order and orientation of
the remaining genes MPP5, ATP6vId, EIF2S1, RBM25,
HSP90 and SLC35B2 are conserved in medaka and zebrafish, except that the zebrafish also has two genes
(ENSDARG00000068789 and ENSDARG00000079963)
not observed in the other species. In stickleback the conserved block of genes mentioned above is disrupted by
the translocation of genes RBM25, HSP90 and SLC35B2.
A smaller synteny block, including MPP5, ATP6vId,
EIF2S1, RBM25 and HSP90, is also conserved in fugu,
and in Tetraodon. In both of these species SLC35B2 is
located at a separate, unlinked locus.
The second region analyzed (Fig. 5B) includes 14
genes annotated from BAC VMRC27-186P13. Most of
the variation between species in this region is associated
with LWS and SWS2 opsin gene copy number. Shown
in Fig. 5B, X. helleri has two SWS2 genes and three
LWS genes. Medaka also has two SWS2 copies that are
orthologous to the SWS2A and SWS2B described here
in X. helleri. Each of the other four species has only a
single SWS2 copy. Additionally, whereas stickleback,
Tetraodon and fugu only have a single LWS gene,
medaka and zebrafish have two. It should be pointed
out that these second copies are predicted products of
lineage-specific duplication events (Fig. 3). Despite these
differences, the synteny block boxed in blue (Fig. 5B) is
highly conserved across all of the teleosts analyzed here.
This gene organization has also been described in
monotremes and most likely represents the ancestral
SWS2/LWS gene organization found in the most recent
common ancestor of mammals, fish, birds and reptiles
[38,84].
Retinal cone pigment characterization and opsin gene
expression

Assessing the spectral absorbance properties of opsin
proteins can be achieved by making comparisons
between MSP and molecular opsin sequence data [85]
or by visual pigment reconstitution [86]. Moreover,

Page 10 of 17

given the extensive amount of effort spent characterizing
the effect of amino acid substitutions at key sites in vertebrate MWS/LWS opsins, broad scale spectral sensitivities can be roughly inferred and assigned to a given
opsin protein based on its five site haplotype. This has
been attempted for the LWS opsins so far identified in
the guppy and related species [6-8]. However, in Poeciliidae, no study has yet made direct associations between
MSP data and opsin sequences from individuals of the
same population and strain.
We found that X. helleri adult retinas exhibit six separate cone and rod classes defined by differences in maximal spectral sensitivities (Fig. 6). All of the visual
pigments fit the typical A1 chromophore pigment-curve
and the average lmax values observed are as follows; UV
cone class (lmax = 365 nm; Fig. 6A), violet cone class
(lmax = 405 nm; Fig. 6B), blue cone class (lmax = 459
nm; Fig. 6C), green cone class (lmax = 534 nm; Fig. 6D),
yellow cone class (lmax = 568; Fig. 6E) and a rod class
(l max = 499 nm; Fig. 6F). Maximum absorbance
averages for the green and yellow cone classes are similar to those described in other poeciliids. The molly,
Poecilia mexicana, has two LWS cone classes with average l max values of 536 nm and 563 nm [87], whereas
the guppy retina exhibits one to three with lmax values
of 533 nm, 548 nm and 572 nm [31]. Although, it
should be noted that the 548 nm cone class is proposed
to be the result of a mixture of the 533 nm and 577 nm
cone classes [31]. Using cDNA synthesized from whole
eye total RNA of adult male and female X. helleri (Rio
Sarabia Strain), products representing each of the LWS
(S180-1, S180-2, P180, S180r) and SWS2 (SWS2B) opsin
subtypes were successfully amplified by PCR, and partial
sequences for RH2-1, RH2-2, SWS1 and RH1 opsins
were also amplified and sequenced (see Additional File 1
for PCR primers). Partial sequences for RH2-1, RH2-2,
SWS1 and RH1 opsins have been deposited under the
following GenBank accession numbers (GU454732,
GU454733, GU454734, GU454735).
The four X. helleri LWS genes described here are
grouped into two five-site haplotype classes (Fig. 2A).
The S180 subtype genes (S180-1, S180-2, S180r) share a
common five-site haplotype (SHYTA) and are predicted
to exhibit similar spectral sensitivities. This haplotype
has also been identified in each of the LWS duplicates
of both killifish and medaka [33,85]. However, the killifish LWS duplicates have a lmax at approximately 573
nm, whereas the two LWS copies found in medaka exhibit a lower lmax, near 560 nm [33,85]. The human LWS
opsin, which has the SHYTA five site haplotype, also
has a lmax of 560 nm [59,88,89]. Our MSP data show
two peaks in the range predicted to be associated with
LWS spectral sensitivity, one at 534 nm and another at
568 nm. The lower of these two values, 534 nm, is near

the assigned l max of the human MWS protein (the
human MWS arose via duplication of the primate LWS
locus; ref 34), and one of the cavefish LWS proteins
[88-90]. Human MWS and cavefish LWS opsins both
share the haplotype AFHAA while the X. helleri P180
protein (PFHAA) differs at only a single site. Taken
together, these data allow us to conclude that the X. helleri peak observed here at 568 nm most likely corresponds to the S180 subtypes. However, the fact that we
were also able to amplify RH2 subtypes from eye cDNA
limits our ability to definitively assign the 534 nm cone
to the LWS P180 gene, as RH2 opsins have also been
shown to represent cone classes in this spectral range
[12,85].

We were unable to amplify SWS2A from cDNA using
two different sets of primers designed in 5â and 3âUTR
sequence, and in exons III and IV (Additional File 1),
although a nested PCR approach did result in SWS2A
amplification. MSP data from this study indicated the
presence of a cone pigment class with an average lmax
of 459 nm (Fig. 6C), which is within the expected range
of teleost SWS2A pigments [10,12,85,91]. However, RH2
opsin absorption spectra as low as 459 nm have also
been observed in other teleosts. For example, the RH2-A
gene in medaka has a lmax of 452 nm [33], and the zebrafish RH2-1 gene has a lmax of 467 nm [32]. Therefore,
similar to the 534 nm cone discussed above, it is difficult to conclude which opsin protein is responsible for

the 467 nm pigment class. In both of these instances a
quantitative PCR approach seeking to ascertain differences in opsin gene expression levels could help clarify
these discrepancies.
Compared to SWS2A opsins, SWS2B genes typically
exhibit lower lmax values between 405 nm and 425 nm
[11]. We detected a violet cone class with a lmax of 405
nm, which is the cone pigment class most likely to correspond to the X. helleri SWS2B gene. SWS2B opsins in
both medaka and the killifish have absorption maxima
of 405 nm [33,85,91]. Lastly, the fifth cone class
described in this study by MSP has a lmax of 365 nm,
and most likely represents the SWS1 gene. Within teleosts, SWS1 opsin absorption maxima fall primarily
within the ultra violet region of the light spectrum,
unlike many other vertebrates, which have evolved
SWS1 opsins sensitive to longer wavelengths [10,11].
One exception, however, is the scabbardfish SWS1 gene,
which has evolved a lmax of 423 nm [14].
We were also able to amplify PCR products for
GPHN, suggesting that expression of this gene is not
disrupted by the insertion of S180r. The insertion of
S180r into GPHN raises interesting questions about the
fate of retroduplicates. As mentioned above, retrogenes
are typically reinserted at loci unlinked to their ancestral

copies. Many examples have recently come to light that
suggest retrogenes are able to travel with basic regulatory sequences acquired from their ancestral locus or
âhijackâ those of their neighboring genes once reinserted
back into the genome [73]. It is unknown if the expression of this LWS retrogene is facilitated by one of the
two mechanisms above or an alternative one. Given that
we were able to show expression of the GPHN gene,
known to be expressed in the zebrafish retina [92], this
provides an indication that the chromosomal region
where S180r now resides is active in the eye of adult
X. helleri, and may provide a starting point for asking
questions about the mechanisms maintaining S180r
expression. It should be noted that we were unable to
amplify S180r from cDNA using primers designed
within the predicted 5â UTR, suggesting that S180r
could be a product of gene fusion. Fusion transcripts
are sometimes observed in cases in which retrotransposed duplicates have been inserted into other genes
[73]. Even though S180r and GPHN do not have the
same transcriptional orientation, we tested for fusion
transcripts of the two genes by attempting PCR with
two different combinations of GPHN and S180r primers
(Additional File 1), but no products were produced from
either of the two combinations used.

Candidate regulatory elements conserved in SWS2/LWS
intergenic sequence: implications for opsin expression

Similar to the X. helleri LWS genes described in this
study, human LWS/MWS opsin genes are linked and
organized in a tandem array [35]. Retinal specific
expression of the human LWS/MWS genes is regulated
by a shared LCR [35-42]. This region has been identified
across mammalian taxa [38,39,93], and regions analogous to the mammalian LWS LCR have been identified
for other opsin gene classes as well [94-96].
Using multipipmaker [69] we identified two highly
conserved candidate opsin regulatory regions within the
intergenic sequence between SWS2 and LWS opsins in
seven teleost species (Fig. 7A, 7B). The two regions,
Region I and Region II, are separated by approximately
300-450 bp of sequence (depending on the species) with
low phylogenetic conservation. The locations of these
regions are indicated in Fig. 7.
Region I, which is located farther upstream of LWS
opsins than Region II in all species surveyed, is a highly
conserved 90 bp stretch containing two conserved
blocks of sequence (24 bp long and 29 bp long; Fig. 7A)
with 100% shared nucleotide similarity across all seven

Page 13 of 17

teleost species. Included within this region are several
sequences (Fig. 7A) showing similarity to previously
described hormone response element (HRE) half sites
[70]. HREs bind nuclear hormone receptors that act as
ligand-induced transcription factors following the binding of an appropriate steroid, hormone or vitamin, activating or suppressing gene transcription [97]. Many
hormone receptors are known to be involved in the
proper development of cone photoreceptor cells
[98-101]. In mice, liganded thyroid hormone receptor
b2 (TRb2) is known to activate expression of MWS
opsins, while both TRb2 and retinoid X receptor g
(RXRg) are known to suppress SWS opsin expression
[98-101]. It has also been shown in juvenile salmonids
that thyroid hormone exposure can induce opsin expressional changes in the retina from SWS1 subtypes to
SWS2 subtypes [102]. The preferred HRE half site
sequence of TRs and many other non-steroid receptors
is based on the sequence PuG [G/T]TCA [70]. However,
it should be noted that the sequence of the HRE half
site used is dependent on the receptor it is binding, and
these sites could be expected to show considerable variation from reported consensus sequences [97]. HRE

Watson et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:87
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/87

half-sites typically occur in duplicate and can be
arranged as palindromic, direct, inverted or everted
repeats [97]. In Region I we identified two candidate
HRE palindromic repeat arrangements (Fig. 7A). Halfsites of one of the palindromic repeats are spaced by 8
nucleotides. The other palindromic arrangement contains half-sites with overlapping sequences. In addition
to teleosts, we were able to identify Region I upstream
of LWS opsin genes in the frog, Xenopus tropicalis, and
lizard, Anolis carolinensis (Additional File 3), each of
which has physically linked SWS2 and LWS opsin genes.
The second region identified, Region II, is 106-107 bp
in length and compared to region I is only moderately
conserved across teleosts. The zebrafish Region II is
most divergent from the other species (Fig. 7B), but this
is expected considering that the zebrafish is distantly
related to the other species analyzed here [103].
Although this region shows weaker conservation across
species, it contains a single HRE half-site, similar to
those in Region I, and four potential cone-rod-homeobox (CRX) transcription factor binding sites based on
previously identified consensus sequences [71,72]. The
presence of CRX binding sites is a feature shared with
other opsin regulatory regions: the mammalian LWS
opsin LCR [40-42], the mammalian rod expression
region [94], zebrafish RH2 opsin LCR [95] and zebrafish
SWS2 cis-acting regulatory elements [96]. CRX is part
of the OTX family of transcription factors and is known
to be involved in expression of photoreceptor specific
genes [71,72,99]. For example, photoreceptor specific
genes, which are partially regulated by CRX, show low
retinal expression in mice mutants homozygous for a
CRX mutation [104]. Also, deletions involving the
human MWS/LWS LCR, which contains multiple putative CRX binding sites, have been linked to a visual
defect known as blue cone monochromacy in which no
MWS or LWS opsins are expressed in the retina [40,41].
The conservation of these non-coding regions across
many species alludes to a possible functional role.
Wakefield et al. [38] postulate that the opsin LCR found
in monotremes, which is homologous to that described
in other mammals, controls the expression of both the
LWS and SWS2 opsin genes. This could also be true for
the putative elements we have uncovered for teleosts.
However, further work is needed to assess the role that
these regions may play in controlling opsin expression
and photoreceptor development, whether separately, or
in concert.
Elucidating the function of regulatory elements at this
locus in conjunction with what we now know about
poeciliid LWS opsin organization from this study could
prove to be fundamental to our understanding of how
LWS opsins have influenced sexual selection and speciation in these fish. In the human retina, the expression of

Page 14 of 17

LWS cones exceeds that of MWS cones, and it has been
suggested that opsin gene regulatory sequence variation,
opsin gene proximity to the LCR, and the three-dimensional chromatin structure of the LWS/MWS locus may
explain these differences [42,105-107]. As in the human
LWS/MWS array, zebrafish RH2 opsin gene expression
is also dependent on an LCR. It is unknown to what
extent the LCR influences spatial and temporal differences in zebrafish RH2 expression [95,108], however,
proximity to the LCR has been shown experimentally to
influence expression levels using artificial expression
constructs [95]. Spatial and temporal expression differences have also been observed for zebrafish LWS opsins
[32,108]. Ward et al. [8], using RT-qPCR, showed that
the guppy A180 LWS gene is expressed at much higher
levels compared to the other three LWS subtypes. Given
that the guppy A180 locus is potentially orthologous to
the S180-1 locus described here for X. helleri, it is possible that this gene could also be the closest gene to the
LCR in the Poecilia LWS array. If this were in fact true,
then the proximity of the A180 locus in relation to the
LCR could be the mechanism driving higher expression
levels of the A180 gene observed in the guppy. Whether
high relative A180 expression is a trend across Poecilia
species remains to be investigated. Indeed, MSP data
have shown considerable variation in retinal long wavelength sensitivity within a single guppy population
[30,31], suggesting that relative opsin expression levels
are not necessarily fixed between individuals of the
same population or species. Differences in long wavelength sensitivity have also been found using MSP
between species and populations of mollies, which are
also in the genus Poecilia [87]. However, it is unknown
if the differences in visual potential observed in guppies
and mollies correspond to variation in female preferences for male coloration patterns [30,31,87]. It will
undoubtedly be important to examine to what extent
genomic organization, gene copy number variation and
opsin promoter sequence polymorphisms affect opsin
expressional differences, and in turn how this may contribute to population and species divergence in mate
choice in poeciliids, a classic model for the study of evolution by sexual selection.

Conclusions
We have characterized the genomic organization of four
LWS and two SWS2 opsin genes in the green swordtail
fish, Xiphophorus helleri. Three of the LWS genes
(S180-1, S180-2, P180) reside in tandem and are linked
to two SWS2 opsin genes (SWS2A, SWS2B), whereas the
retrotransposed S180r LWS gene is located at a separate
unlinked locus. S180-2, P180 and S180r have each been
described previously in other species. However, it is
unclear whether the S180-1 opsin is orthologous to the

Poecilia A180 gene, one of the three S180 genes
described in anablepids, or is the result of a Xiphophorus- or X. helleri-specific duplication event. Further
descriptions of the genomic organization of LWS opsin
genes in a broader range of species will provide a more
definitive understanding of the evolutionary relationships between these genes. Eleven opsins, including the
four LWS and two SWS2 opsin genes described at the
genomic level, are expressed in female and male adult
retinas, contributing to six retinal cone and rod classes
assessed by MSP. To date it is unclear exactly what regulatory mechanisms control the expression of LWS and
SWS2 opsins in X. helleri or any teleost, although temporal, spatial and relative expressional differences have
been observed in several other species. We have identified two candidate LWS opsin regulatory regions.
Experiments assessing the function of these regions are
currently underway.
