Abstract
Background: Single-pass, partial sequencing of complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries generates
thousands of chromatograms that are processed into high quality expressed sequence tags (ESTs), and
then assembled into contigs representative of putative genes. Usually, to be of value, ESTs and contigs must
be associated with meaningful annotations, and made available to end-users.
Results: A web application, Expressed Sequence Tag Information Management and Annotation (ESTIMA),
has been created to meet the EST annotation and data management requirements of multiple highthroughput EST sequencing projects. It is anchored on individual ESTs and organized around different
properties of ESTs including chromatograms, base-calling quality scores, structure of assembled
transcripts, and multiple sources of comparison to infer functional annotation, Gene Ontology
associations, and cDNA library information. ESTIMA consists of a relational database schema and a set of
interactive query interfaces. These are integrated with a suite of web-based tools that allow a user to query
and retrieve information. Further, query results are interconnected among the various EST properties.
ESTIMA has several unique features. Users may run their own EST processing pipeline, search against
preferred reference genomes, and use any clustering and assembly algorithm. The ESTIMA database
schema is very flexible and accepts output from any EST processing and assembly pipeline.
ESTIMA has been used for the management of EST projects of many species, including honeybee (Apis
mellifera), cattle (Bos taurus), songbird (Taeniopygia guttata), corn rootworm (Diabrotica vergifera), catfish
(Ictalurus punctatus, Ictalurus furcatus), and apple (Malus x domestica). The entire resource may be
downloaded and used as is, or readily adapted to fit the unique needs of other cDNA sequencing projects.
Conclusions: The scripts used to create the ESTIMA interface are freely available to academic users in
an archived format from http://titan.biotec.uiuc.edu/ESTIMA/. The entity-relationship (E-R) diagrams and
the programs used to generate the Oracle database tables are also available. We have also provided
detailed installation instructions and a tutorial at the same website. Presently the chromatograms, EST
databases and their annotations have been made available for cattle and honeybee brain EST projects. Nonacademic users need to contact the W.M. Keck Center for Functional and Comparative Genomics,
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, for licensing information.

Background
Expressed sequence tag (EST) collections represent partial
descriptions of the transcribed portions of genomes. They
are generated from single-pass cDNA library sequencing
that is often carried out by small or mid-size sequencing
centers and research groups. The research may be aimed at
transcriptome expression analysis using microarray, RTPCR, or hybridization techniques. An increasing number
of research centers are involved in sequencing multiple
cDNA libraries. This is manifest by the exponential
growth in the number of ESTs deposited to dbEST at NCBI
(National Center for Biotechnology Information), and as
of the May 21, 2004 update, that number is at over 21.2
million ESTs from 686 species. Small sequencing centers
are faced with searching for cost-effective and convenient
tools for EST management and querying, visualization,
public and private user access, and functional
classification.
EST processing pipelines that transform raw chromatograms into high-quality filtered sequences, and software
to cluster and assemble them into contigs are convenient
to implement, and various tools are now available to
researchers (StackPACK [1], ESTWeb [2], ESTAP [3],
PipeOnline2.0 [4]). The TIGR gene indices [5], for example, are generated by performing an all-against-all pairwise similarity search of the ESTs, and then clustered via
single-node transitive closure. The clusters are fed into
CAP3 [6] for assembly. We have used the following
assembly protocol for in-house sequencing projects such
as cattle [7] and honeybee [8]. High quality sequences are
pooled and run through BlastClust [9] to form clusters of
similar sequences. Then the BlastClust output is run
through CAP3. Commercial software (such as Paracel
[10]) that is targeted for bioinformatics centers equipped
with high-performance computing machines is also
available.
We describe ESTIMA (EST Information Management and
Annotation) software that provides a database schema for
management of raw and annotated ESTs, and is coupled
with a suite of custom web-based tools that facilitate
searching various aspects of ESTs and contigs, visualization, pairwise searching by BLAST [9], and functional classification based on the controlled vocabulary defined by
the Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium [11]. ESTIMA
accepts assembled sequences from any EST processing and
clustering software, and has been equipped with password
protection so that project researchers can use the ESTIMA
tool confidentially with academic or industry
collaborators.
To form an association between a GO term and an EST, an
organism that has already been annotated with the GO
terms is selected. The ESTs are searched against this refer-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/176

ence organism's annotated sequences, and the resulting
alignments are used to ascribe putative function. The
ESTIMA database schema provides users the flexibility to
use any reference database that has GO term association,
and any number of external databases, such as NCBI's
non-redundant (nr) database or EMBL's Swissprot collections, to annotate ESTs and their contigs. This flexibility in
the schema is critical given the increasing number of
sequenced genomes, and specialized reference databases
that researchers can download and integrate with existing
annotations. Other database schemas that house EST
project and analysis data have been reported [3,12]. But
the inherent flexibility of multiple EST project management that ESTIMA affords, by allowing users to create
multiple instances of the PROJECT schema within the
GENOME schema (see section on databases), and allowing any number of reference genomes to be added, is
unique to ESTIMA.
The inputs to ESTIMA are the chromatograms, raw and
processed ESTs, clusters and assembled EST contigs from
any source, reference database annotations of ESTs, and
contigs. All of these get loaded into the tables generated
from the ESTIMA database schema and loading scripts.
The raw and processed data, with their annotations, are
made available to users through the ESTIMA query interfaces, for exporting, visualization, and further research.

Implementation
ESTIMA is composed of three major components: an
ODBC-compliant database, loading scripts and a web
application. Figure 1 shows the relationship of these
components.
Databases
The heart of the system is a pair of database schemas. Figure 2 shows an ER diagram describing both schemas. The
first schema, GENOME is common to all projects in the
installation. It houses tables containing the GO structure,
gene association information, annotation, and project
security. GO terms are stored in two tables. Each GO term
has a record in the Term table. The Term2Term table contains one record for each edge in the directional graph
linking the terms. The graph can then be searched by starting with a term identifier (ID), finding all child IDs, then
finding all records where each of the child terms appear as
a parent. In this way, the entire graph can be searched with
one call per tier below the original term.

Term_Seq_Count contains the pre-calculated counts of
ESTs associated with each term, and all the terms' child
terms. Pre-calculation saves time at execution, and is handled by a Perl script that is rerun each time the GO tables
are updated.

ESTIMA1 organized around three major components
ESTIMA is organized around three major components. A single installation of the ESTIMA web application can provide a frontend for any number of projects; in this case, three different projects are shown. The web application connects to a different
project database for each project. All projects share the GENOME database, and a common repository for the blastable databases, although project users can only "see" those databases associated with their project.

The Gene_Association and Annotation table contains
information that links the ESTs to the reference genomes.
The Gene_Association table has one record for each reference gene that is associated with an EST or contig. The reference gene is then related to a GO term in the Term table.
GENOME also contains the Blast_All table that holds
information regarding the association between the ESTs

and any project-specific DNA sequences. The ESTs are
searched against sequences of interest, such as NCBI's nr,
and the results are parsed and loaded into the Blast_All
table.
In addition to the common data, each project has its own
schema that contains information such as DNA
sequences, contig assemblies and paths to the

the Project table that contains a simple link between the
other PROJECT tables and the GENOME schema. This
organization has proven useful when the contents of the
PROJECT schema are to be transferred directly from a

sequencing facility to a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS).
Each project may have several different contig assemblies

The seven elements of the web application (the start screen and six query applications shown as rectangles) interact with each
other in a complex manner. A single headed arrow means that the element at the tail of the arrow creates hyperlinks in its output that automatically calls the element at the arrowhead. For example, whenever the contig viewer refers to an EST sequence,
it links the ID to information about the EST from the Sequence ID element. The GO Browser and the Sequence ID elements
allow users to download the appropriate FASTA files. Additionally, the GO Browser and Gene Association elements provide
links to external information about reference sequences.

assemblies are all housed in the Assembly_Project, Contig, Consensus_Link and Singlet tables. Each assembly has
a single ID that is used by the web application to determine which is "live". After a new assembly is completed
and loaded, it can be taken live by simply changing a single number in the web applications configuration file.
Finally, the sequence data itself is stored in the
DNA_Sequence table, while related GenBank accession
numbers are stored in their own table. Although accession
numbers are not required by the web application, if they
are available, then the web application will accept them
where a sequence ID would be used.
Loading
The second major component of the ESTIMA system is a
series of Perl and JAVA applications used to parse and load
data into the database. Because each project will have its
own needs, the loading system was not automated.
Instead, several dozen separate scripts and applications

have been developed to allow researchers to manipulate
and analyze large data sets using standard analysis
applications.
Web application
The third component of ESTIMA is the web-application
that queries and reports the EST information to the endusers.

The ESTIMA web application is organized around seven
points of entry into the system – the start screen and six
query applications. Each query application interfaces with
the databases, and allow users to query raw and annotated
ESTs and contigs. ESTIMA supports password-protection,
multiple-projects, and multiple libraries within a project.
This is achieved with an XML configuration file with
project-specific information that is called by the various
applications when project-related information is needed.

of the web application. Their implementation is discussed
in detail below.
The start screen
The start screen provides a convenient point of reference
to the system. The page contains information about each
library (genomic, cDNA, etc) in the project. All of the elements of the start page are contained within the configuration file.
GO Browser
The GO Browser (Figure 4) allows a researcher to start
with a GO term, and find all ESTs associated with the
term, and all of the descendent terms. The browser has a
term search option that locates terms based on userdefined strings; for example, 'DNA%' will locate all GO
terms starting with DNA. Once a term has been identified,
the browser will provide a map of the GO tree both above

and below any term, as well as a count of the ESTs associated with each of the terms displayed. For each term the
browser also provides the option of either downloading
the sequences of all ESTs and contigs associated with the
term in a single FASTA file, or download a spreadsheet of
the EST identifiers, associated GO terms and information
about the linkage between the two. Alternately, the
spreadsheet can be viewed as a web page. In this form the
sequence identifiers will link to the appropriate ESTIMA
page, ESTs to the Sequence ID page and contigs to the contig viewer. Further, the reference sequence used to form
the association will link to the appropriate external web
site. The GO Browser output can be filtered so that only
ESTs from a single library are displayed.
Sequence ID
ESTs can be accessed directly from the sequence ID interface. More commonly, results from queries on annota-

BMC Bioinformatics 2004, 5:176

tions or contigs are dynamically linked to the EST
sequence information. From these screens users can access
chromatograms, and both raw and filtered sequences.
Gene association
Information about the association between the ESTs and
the reference genome sequences can be accessed through
these pages.
BlastUI
ESTIMA provides a Blast User Interface that allows FASTAformatted sequences to be searched against the EST libraries. The libraries that are available for BLAST [9] can be
defined for each project. We usually allow at a minimum,
the raw sequences, the clean sequences, and the unique
assembled sequences (contigs plus singletons). This
allows researchers to rapidly identify those ESTs associated with any particular sequence of interest. The data sets
available for BLAST searches can be easily extended for
specific projects. For example, we make the Baylor University Honeybee Genome assemblies [13] available to the
honeybee site [8].
Annotations
The Annotation page is an optional page, the presence or
absence of which is controlled from a configuration file.
This page allows additional BLAST-derived annotations,
beyond GO annotations, to be displayed and queried in a
number of different ways. The web application creates an
interface that allows users to query the Blast_All table
directly. For example, songbird ESTs [14] were searched
against the nr from NCBI, Swiss-Prot, and chicken database from TIGR. A researcher can use this to find all the
ESTs and contigs in the songbird collection that are associated with any term in the sequence description. The
term RNA binding, for instance, returns 38 hits, of which
19 are to nr proteins, 11 to Swiss-Prot, and 8 to TIGR
chicken.
Contig Viewer
The Contig Viewer provides an image of the assembled
contigs showing the relationship of the contig with the
ESTs it contains as members. It provides the contig's consensus sequence, and links to each of the member ESTs.

The web application maintains a common look and feel
to all the pages within a project. This is implemented by
having a single block of HTML stored within a configuration file. As each page is rendered, the same HTML is
called to generate the header block of the page. Each
project has its own HTML, so the look of each project's
web site can be customized.
The inter-connectivity of the different ESTIMA modules
allows researchers to engage in a "free form" exploration

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/176

of the data. Users can query the GO Browser, for example,
to find a contig associated with a term of interest, drill
down to see the structure of the contig, and then, if
desired, drill down to get specific information on each EST
in the contig. Just as easily, the users could take a sequence
of interest from their research, and similarity-search it
against the assembled ESTs. Then they could drill down
on an EST that aligned with their sequence, and see the
additional information about the sequence, including any
annotations.
Chromatograms
ESTIMA allows users to view the actual chromatograms of
the ESTs. Chromatogram files are stored in a file system
visible to the web server, while file paths are stored in the
database. When a user requests a chromatogram, Phred
[15,16] is called to convert the chromatogram to SCF format and this is sent to Traceviewer [17] that displays the
trace in the user's web browser.

Results
ESTIMA is independent of an EST processing pipeline
ESTIMA is unlinked from the backend EST processing
pipeline, clustering, and assembly of ESTs. It serves as a
stand-alone web application that allows users to store,
access, research, and visualize the raw and annotated ESTs
and contigs, including GO annotation. The output from a
sequencing center's EST processing pipeline (base-called
high-quality ESTs, assembled contigs, BLAST results
against a reference genome) gets loaded into databases,
and serves as input to ESTIMA. (The W.M. Keck Center
will gladly share the source code to its pipeline with any
interested academic institution).

Additionally, researchers may choose to use any reference
genome to annotate their sequences. ESTIMA comes packaged with a flexible database schema that supports the
linking of sequences to GO terms, and other user-supplied
sequences. The flexibility of the ESTIMA database schema
becomes more relevant with the increasing number of
sequenced genomes. ESTIMA provides a flexible, password-protected, multi-project environment to researchers. It facilitates analysis of an unlimited number of ESTs
and contigs linked to GO and non-GO annotations, and
the download of annotated sequences related to any GO
term. ESTIMA comes with an implementation of a GO
browser that allows users to view the entire child term tree
for any term, conveniently from a single query interface.
There can be multiple installations of ESTIMA
ESTIMA is designed to be a stand-alone application. Each
installation of the web application has all system dependent information in its own configuration files, including
the information needed to connect to the databases. We
maintain two instances of the interface, a development

Page 7 of 10

BMC Bioinformatics 2004, 5:176

and a production copy. As new projects are introduced,
they can be tested, and any interface modifications that
are needed can be perfected on the development machine,
concurrent with the creation of the production version of
the databases. The production database can be examined
using the development web application and any errors
corrected before taking the system "live" to the production version.
ESTIMA maintains multiple projects and supports multiple
libraries in a project
ESTIMA is designed to accept new projects. As new EST
sequencing projects are finished, they can be easily added
to an existing ESTIMA installation. A new schema is created for the new project and the loading scripts are used to
populate the database. All that is required to activate the
web application is the addition of a block of XML code to
the configuration file, and a connection string and some
HTML to the system configuration file. XML tags within a
configuration file control project- specific issues such as
whether the data is password protected, or which BLAST
databases can be accessed from the Blast User Interface.

There are three public ESTIMA projects currently administered through the W.M. Keck Center for Comparative and
Functional Genomics at the University of Illinois. The
bee-ESTdb [18] is a resource created from a normalized
unidirectional cDNA library from which 21,408 cDNA
clones were partially sequenced. These sequences were
assembled into 8,966 putatively unique sequences. The
contigs were then tested for similarity to sequences in the
Drosophila genome, and based on these similarities the
sequences were tentatively assigned one or more molecular functions and biological processes. Likewise, BOVEST,
the cattle EST database [19], contains 17,452 cDNAs from
a bovine placenta library and 6,144 from a spleen library,
all of which were annotated against the human UniGene
[20]. The songbird project contains 14,461 sequences
from a songbird brain library [14] that were assembled
into 8,526 unique sequences. ESTIMA allows multiple
libraries within each project. Information about each
library is stored in the configuration file, and the interface
elements dynamically generate the start page and the
library filters within the GO Browser.
Practical examples that demonstrate research utility of
ESTIMA
The presence of multiple projects in ESTIMA allows for
efficient cross-tissue or cross-species homology searches.
For example, a mouse brain EST may be used to interrogate the honeybee brain or songbird brain library to test
the hypothesis that the gene is expressed as a brain-specific transcript. Thus, a mouse brain transcript, NCBI
accession number BM875176, similar to human tubulin
alpha-1 chain protein may be used to do a TBLASTX

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/176

against the honeybee brain assembled ESTs from the BlastUI interface in ESTIMA. The BLAST results retrieve a significant hit, Contig2466, to the honeybee brain database
(Figure 5). The contig identifier is hyperlinked to the
Sequence ID interface in ESTIMA from where the consensus sequence may be downloaded. The chromatograms
for the ESTs that make up the contig, may also be checked
for quality from the same interface in ESTIMA as shown in
Figure 5. Both mouse and honeybee brain sequences, may
then be used to do a deeper phylogenetic search with a
BLASTX against non-redundant protein database to test
the tissue-specificity hypothesis.
ESTIMA projects, as compared to other public web-applications such as TIGR gene indices [5], allow access to singlets from the EST assemblies, and chromatogram
retrieval. These singlets would include rare, novel transcripts and divergent homologs that are increasingly the
sole motivation for a research project. Since ESTIMA
includes only high quality sequences in the databases,
users may search for and download these novel transcripts, and also efficiently implement a homology search
strategy using the web-application. Another strength of
ESTIMA is in facilitating chromatogram and contig viewing from a common interface (Sequence ID). Any contig
may be displayed and chromatograms of the member
ESTs checked for errors in base-calling that may result in a
premature stop-codon, or frameshift indels. Thus,
ESTIMA is a valuable genome research tool.

Conclusions
ESTIMA is a full-featured web-application and database,
designed to simplify exploring and sharing EST libraries
and databases. It can be easily adapted to a wide variety of
system configurations, and back-end database engines.
Our installation of ESTIMA easily supports three public
projects, with five different EST libraries, and additionally
a growing number of private projects.

Availability and requirements
ESTIMA is available free to academic users at http://
titan.biotec.uiuc.edu/ESTIMA/. Under 'Downloadable
Software' section of the web page, detailed installation
instructions and a user manual have been included as
well. ESTIMA is still in active development. New features
are constantly being developed to meet the changing
needs of the research projects that use it. Further, new
projects are being added to our ESTIMA installation. The
system has been written to facilitate its own change, and
as such, researchers should find it approachable with a
good working knowledge of Perl, SQL, and HTML.
System requirements
ESTIMA requires Perl and a database. All communication
with the database is handled through Perl DBI, which is

to human tubulin alpha-1 protein against honeybee brain assembled ESTs. The resulting hit Id, Contig2466, is linked to the
Sequence ID interface in ESTIMA from where the consensus sequence of the honeybee contig may be retrieved. The chromatogram for a member EST in the contig is displayed.

extensible to any ODBC compliant database. The use of
Perl DBI and ODBC allow the databases to reside on separate servers from the web interface. Although many databases may be used, in practice, there are several complex
joins in the code that could result in slow performance on
large EST sets unless a well-optimized database was
selected.
ESTIMA requires certain additional Perl modules, specifically BIO, CGI, DBI, and GD. Bioperl, the BIO module
[21] is used extensively. All BLAST and FASTA file parsing,
as well as all references to sequence objects in the user
interface are handled with BIO methods. GD [22] is used
to generate the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) files
displayed in the contig viewer.
We have been using ESTIMA throughout its development.
Our schemas are housed in an Oracle 8I database on a Silicon Graphics Origin 2000 16 × 250 MHz machine running IRIX 6.5.20. The web application, including the user
requested BLAST jobs are run on a Sun Microsystems SunFire 280 R with dual 700 SPARK V9 CPUs.
