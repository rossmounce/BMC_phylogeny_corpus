Abstract
Background: External ripening in Citrus fruits is morphologically characterized by a colour shift from green to
orange due to the degradation of chlorophylls and the accumulation of carotenoid pigments. Although numerous
genes coding for enzymes involved in such biochemical pathways have been identified, the molecular control of
this process has been scarcely studied. In this work we used the Citrus clementina mutants 39B3 and 39E7, showing
delayed colour break, to isolate genes potentially related to the regulation of peel ripening and its physiological or
biochemical effects.
Results: Pigment analyses revealed different profiles of carotenoid and chlorophyll modification in 39B3 and 39E7
mutants. Flavedo from 39B3 fruits showed an overall delay in carotenoid accumulation and chlorophyll
degradation, while the flavedo of 39E7 was devoid of the apocarotenoid b-citraurin among other carotenoid
alterations. A Citrus microarray containing about 20,000 cDNA fragments was used to identify genes that were
differentially expressed during colour change in the flavedo of 39B3 and 39E7 mutants respect to the parental
variety. The results highlighted 73 and 90 genes that were respectively up- and down-regulated in both mutants.
CcGCC1 gene, coding for a GCC type transcriptional factor, was found to be down-regulated. CcGCC1 expression
was strongly induced at the onset of colour change in the flavedo of parental clementine fruit. Moreover,
treatment of fruits with gibberellins, a retardant of external ripening, delayed both colour break and CcGCC1
overexpression.
Conclusions: In this work, the citrus fruit ripening mutants 39B3 and 39E7 have been characterized at the
phenotypic, biochemical and transcriptomic level. A defective synthesis of the apocarotenoid b-citraurin has been
proposed to cause the yellowish colour of fully ripe 39E7 flavedo. The analyses of the mutant transcriptomes
revealed that colour change during peel ripening was strongly associated with a major mobilization of mineral
elements and with other previously known metabolic and photosynthetic changes. The expression of CcGCC1 was
associated with peel ripening since CcGCC1 down-regulation correlated with a delay in colour break induced by
genetic, developmental and hormonal causes.

layer (albedo or mesocarp) and an external coloured
peel containing pigments and essential oils (flavedo or
epicarp). Fruit development in oranges has been divided
into three consecutive phases, characterized by a high

enlargement and water accumulation (phase II), and
finally a phase of very reduced rate of fruit growth and
ripening (phase III) [1].
Citrus fruit maturation shows specific features in flesh
and flavedo tissues. Whereas internal maturation in the
flesh is accompanied by an increase in the content of
solutes and a decrease in acidity, external maturation is
typically characterized by a change in colour from green
to orange caused by the concomitant catabolism of
chlorophylls and the synthesis of carotenoids [2-4].
Under specific environmental conditions, the changes in
colour occurring in flavedo may be reversible and are
affected by endogenous factors, such as nutrients
(sucrose and nitrogen) and phytohormones (gibberellins
and ethylene) [5-7]. The biochemical pathways underlying these transformations of pigments have been partially elucidated. Ethylene-induced chlorophyllase
activity and gene expression has been negatively related
to chlorophyll content suggesting the involvement of the
enzyme in colour breakdown of flavedo [8-10].
The characteristic orange colouration of oranges and
mandarins is due to the accumulating carotenoids
in chromoplasts, particularly oxygenated derivatives
(b,b-xanthophylls) and several specific carotenoid cleavage products (apocarotenoids) [11]. Citrus genes coding
for enzymes involved in the synthesis and modification
of carotenoids have been previously isolated and their
evolution during natural and ethylene-induced ripening
described [12-16].
Despite such extensive analysis of the physiological
and biochemical aspects of fruit external maturation,
studies describing induced or natural mutants showing
an altered pattern or timing of colour acquisition are
scarce yet. Among them, the orange (Citrus sinensis L.
Osbeck) mutant Pinalate produced yellow-coloured
fruits due to an unusually high accumulation of linear
carotenes instead of cyclic and oxygenated carotenoids.
The mutant also exhibited reduced synthesis of ABA.
However, the specific alteration of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway in Pinalate is currently unknown
[17]. The nan spontaneous mutation of ‘Washington
Navel’ orange, as formerly characterized in our group,
showed an abnormal brown colour in the ripe flavedo
caused by a defective catabolism of chlorophylls.
Transcript profiling indicated that a SGR-like (STAYGREEN) gene was expressed at lower levels in nan flavedo, suggesting that nan mutation could be associated
to a SGR-like upstream regulatory factor [18]. Recently,
the delay in fruit colouration displayed by the
slow-ripening clementine mutant ‘Tardivo’ (Citrus
clementina Hort. Ex Tan.) has been associated with
altered expression of carotenoid biosynthetic genes and
different sensitivity to the exogenous application of
ethylene [19].

As part of a mutagenic approach to citrus functional
genomics, our group established a collection of near
10,000 independent Citrus clementina mutants obtained
by fast neutrons bombardment, which were expected to
contain genomic deletions in hemizygous dosage. Two
of these mutants, called 39B3 and 39E7, were molecularly characterized by array-Comparative Genomic
Hybridization for the identification of deleted genes.
The structure of 39B3 deletion, determined at the BAC
resolution, contained more than 21 identified genes
spanning a large genomic region [20]. Phenotypic evaluation for several consecutive years demonstrated that
39B3 and 39E7 mutants have a significant delay in
external fruit colour break. In this work we complete
the phenotypic characterization and provide the transcriptomic profiling of flavedo from these mutants.

Results and discussion
Delay of colour change in 39B3 and 39E7 mutants

Mutants 39B3 and 39E7 showing delayed fruit colour
break for several consecutive years were obtained from a
population of near 10,000 Citrus clementina plants
mutagenized by fast neutrons irradiation. Fruits from
39B3 and 39E7 retained an appreciable greenish colour
at the end of November, while fruits from the nonmutagenized parental (for simplification designated as
clementine in this work) had already initiated the shift
to orange at this time (Figure 1A). A previous structural
analysis of the hemizygous genomic deletions found in
these mutants reported large DNA lesions containing a
high number of genes, but no evidences of overlapping
regions in the 39B3 and 39E7 deletions were observed
[20]. In order to characterize the nature of colour break
alterations affecting these mutants, changes in flavedo
colour index (CI) were measured throughout fruit development in both mutants. As shown in Figure 1B, flavedo CI in clementine followed a sigmoid curve shifting
from negative (green colour) to positive values (orange
colour), approximately at mid November. The pattern of
colour change in 39B3 fruits showed a similar behaviour
but with a delay of three-four weeks. In 39E7 mutants,
however, CI increased at a slower rate (Figure 1B) and
reached lower final values than the clementine and 39B3
plants (Figure 1C). These observations suggested that
39B3 and 39E7 mutations affect fruit external ripening
in distinct ways; the 39B3 mutation causes a simple
delay in flavedo colour change, while the 39E7 mutant
is characterized by a reduced rate of colour acquisition
leading to an unusual yellowish external appearance
after full ripening.

chlorophylls and total and individual carotenoids were
determined in flavedo from both mutants and parental
fruits at two different developmental stages: in November
when colour differences with clementine were more evident (Figure 1A) and in January when all three genotypes
had reached the final colouration.
Total chlorophyll pigments were four to five-fold more
abundant in 39B3 and 39E7 than in the parental (Table
1), which suggests a slower chlorophyll catabolism or a
general delay of maturation. These data were in close
agreement with the greenish appearance of mutant fruits
in November, while clementine fruits were already changing to orange (Figure 1A). No chlorophylls were however detected two months later, when the three
genotypes showed an intense orange (clementine and
39B3) or yellowish (39E7) colouration. Total carotenoids
were in 39B3 lower than in clementine in November as

expected from the delayed colour break in this mutant,
and also in January. On the contrary, 39E7 mutant
showed a higher amount of carotenoids in November,
but no significant statistical differences were observed
with respect to the parental in January.
The profile of individual carotenoids obtained in the
flavedo of clementine essentially coincided with previous
reports in this variety, characterized by a reduction in
b,ε-carotenoids and neoxanthin and an increase of specific b,b-xanthophylls during ripening [15]. In January, the
39B3 mutant exhibited a carotenoid profile very similar
to that of the clementine. However, the pattern of pigment distribution in 39B3 in November differed significantly from the parental, showing lower percentages of
phytoene, phytofluene and b-citraurin, and higher
amounts of b-carotene, neoxanthin, a-cryptoxanthin and
lutein (Table 1), characteristics of chloroplastic tissues, in

good agreement with the delayed external colouration in
39B3 fruit. Other b,b-xanthophylls more typical of chromoplastic citrus peel, as b-cryptoxanthin, anteraxanthin
and 9-Z-violaxanthin, were found in a percentage higher
than expected, however the lower amount of total carotenoids in 39B3 indicated a roughly similar absolute accumulation of them in both 39B3 and clementine.
The carotenoid profile of 39E7 mutant showed common features in November and January. In both samples,
the absence of the apocarotenoid b-citraurin (C30) was
associated with a higher accumulation of the xanthophylls b-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin. This observation
is of special significance because despite the relevant contribution of b-citraurin, a red-orange pigment, to the
typical peel colour of oranges and mandarines [11,21],
the specific cleavage reaction producing this C30-apocarotenoid has not been yet elucidated. The total absence of
b-citraurin in fully ripened flavedo of 39E7 mutant suggests that such cleavage reaction could be impaired in
this genotype, leading to its distinctive pale yellowish
peel. The concomitant increase of b-cryptoxanthin and
zeaxanthin in 39E7 might indicate a substrate-product
relationship between them and b-citraurin, reinforcing

previous suggestions [11,12,21]. Such alteration in the
carotenoid biosynthesis pathway corroborates at the biochemical level colour-based observations on the different
developmental defects affecting 39B3 and 39E7 mutants.
However we cannot rule out the presence of multiple
mutations in 39E7 leading to separate effects on colour
break delay and carotenoid accumulation. Under this
assumption, the observed delay in external colouration
could be caused by the same locus in both mutants.
Differential expression profiling in flavedo

The availability of 39B3 and 39E7 mutants has been
exploited to identify major factors involved in regulation
of fruit maturation through the transcriptomic analysis of
flavedo tissue from these mutants. We took advantage of a
citrus cDNA microarray previously described [22] to perform large scale hybridization experiments comparing
mRNA isolated from green flavedo of both mutants and
clementine flavedo undergoing colour break collected the
same day. After microarray hybridization and analysis,
cDNAs showing a signal intensity more than double or
less than half of control, under a P-value threshold of 10-5,
were considered as differentially expressed genes. Signal

ratios and false discovery rates of selected genes have been
included as supplementary material in Additional file 1. As
shown in Figure 2 from the 503 and 165 cDNAs overexpressed in 39B3 and 39E7 mutants, respectively, 73 were
common. Similarly, a relatively high percentage of downregulated cDNAs were shared by 39B3 and 39E7 flavedos
(90 from 236 and 273, respectively). The occurrence of
common transcripts confirms the alteration of particular
transcriptional programs in both mutants, which could be
revealed by data mining of these coincident clones. None
of the 90 cDNAs that were found to be simultaneously
down-regulated in both mutants were coincident with the
known deleted genes of 39B3 and 39E7. Therefore, they
are not expected to reduce their expression as a consequence of their occurrence in a genomic deletion. However, additional deletions to those reported in the
published structural characterization of the 39B3 and
39E7 hemizygous deletions [20] might occur in the genome of these mutants and consequently we cannot elucidate whether or not a certain down-regulated gene is
included in a deleted fragment.

Functional classification of cDNAs differentially
expressed in both 39B3 and 39E7 mutants highlighted
major biochemical features underlying peel colour progression (Table 2 and 3). Thus, “photosynthesis” was
one of the pivotal enriched categories in the mutants
due to the presence in flavedo of photosynthetically
active green chloroplasts. Several cDNAs coding for proteins involved in light harvesting, photosynthetic electron transfer chain, Calvin cycle and chlorophyll
biosynthesis were overexpressed in mutant samples
(Table 2), while no “photosynthesis” category could be
created in the list of underexpressed cDNAs (Table 3).
Similarly, known biochemical and physiological features of citrus fruit flavedo at an advanced maturation
stage, such as substitution and accumulation of secondary metabolites and cell wall degradation properly correlated with the enrichment and large size of the
functional category “metabolism” and to a lesser extend
with the category of “cell wall modification” (Table 2
and 3). For example, a valencene synthase responsible
for the accumulation of valencene, an important sesquiterpene in the aroma of ripened citrus fruits [23], is catalogued as a down-regulated gene (Table 3). Conversely,
a g-terpinene synthase, involved in the biosynthesis of
the monoterpene g-terpinene in immature green fruits
[24], is in the list of up-regulated genes (Table 2).
Interestingly, the transcriptomic study revealed that
colour change appears to be also highly dependent upon
a major transport activity. The most striking and novel
observation in this regard was the high number of putative transporters of mineral elements and metals
included in the functional category of “transport” that
were down-regulated in the green flavedo of both
mutants (Table 3). Thus, several sulfate and nitrate
transporters, including a membrane transporter NRT1.2
implicated in chloride homeostasis [25], generic metal
membrane transporters and specific zinc transporters
were common in this category, suggesting that the
mobilization of mineral elements such as sulfur, nitrogen, chloride, zinc and other metals may play a relevant
role in flavedo ripening. The presence of a gene coding
for a ferritin-like protein in the listing of down-regulated
cDNAs ([GenBank:CX307912]; Table 3) may exemplify
the relevance of these transporters in the colour-break
flavedo. Plant ferritins have been described as chloroplastic and mitochondrial proteins involved in Fe(II) oxidation and Fe(III) storage, protecting the cells from the
oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species produced by free iron [26,27]. For instance, limited iron
availability in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been postulated to induce ferritin coding genes in order to buffer
iron released by the degradation of photosystem I (PSI),
an important sink for this metal [28]. Similarly, a related
ferritin-like gene, up-regulated during leaf senescence in

Brassica napus, has been proposed to be involved in
mobilization of iron from senescing cells to developing
organs, where the metal is highly required [29]. Thus,
ferritin accumulation in clementine flavedo tissue undergoing colour break may apparently contribute to the
sequestering and recycling of iron molecules released
during the degradation of photosystems and light-harvesting complexes, at the transition from chloroplast to
chromoplast. The membrane transporters listed in
Table 3 could initiate subsequent mobilization of the
sequestered iron and maybe other metals and mineral
elements to the cells requiring them.
The category of “transport” was also enriched with
cDNAs coding for other several kinds of transporters
including ABC transporters, sugar and protein transporters, aquaporin, H + -ATPases and other unidentified
membrane transporters associated with the green stage
of the flavedo (Table 3).
A MYB-related transcription factor down-regulated in
39B3 and 39E7

Whereas nine different cDNAs coding for transcriptional regulators, including three ethylene response factors, were up-regulated in 39B3 and 39E7 (Table 2),
only one was down-regulated in both mutants ([GenBank:CX287481]; Table 3). This transcription factor
belongs to a subgroup of the GARP (GOLDEN2, ARR-B
and Psr1) subfamily of MYB-related proteins containing
a coiled-coil domain, which has been recently designated
GCC (GARP and coiled-coil) [30,31]. Consequently, we
named the protein deduced from this cDNA CcGCC1
(for Citrus clementina GCC). This gene was not found
in a previous genomic approach to identify deleted
genes in 39B3 and 39E7 mutants [20], and hence no
gene dosage effects are expected to contribute to lower
its expression in the mutants.
The partial sequence of CcGCC1 cDNA annotated in
clone [GenBank:CX287481] was completed by sequencing its 3’ end. The resulting nucleotide and amino acid
sequences are shown in Figure 3. Database similarity
search by BLASTP analysis [32] of the 233 residues long
protein deduced from the cDNA confirmed a high similarity to other members of the GCC subgroup. We used
the SMART [33] and COILS [34] applications to localize
the GARP DNA-binding and the coiled-coil domains
respectively, which are highlighted in Figure 3.
In order to compare CcGCC1 and other related citrus
ESTs with known members of this GCC subgroup, we
selected a 90 amino acids long fragment fusing GARP
and coiled-coil domains of CcGCC1 and several homologous proteins and translated ESTs [35-41]. The phylogenetic tree of these proteins showed two major groups
with CcGCC1 clustered with PHR1 from Arabidopsis
thaliana, a protein involved in phosphate starvation

signalling (Figure 4). The closest homolog to CcGCC1
among those polypeptides was [GenBank:AAT06477],
coded by At5g06800 gene from Arabidopsis. Interestingly, a search into the AtGenExpress database containing microarray expression data of Arabidopsis genes
revealed that At5g06800 is mostly expressed in tissues
lacking chloroplasts such as roots and to a lesser extent
pollen and flower organs [42].
CcGCC1 expression correlates with colour change
processes

In order to investigate the time-dependent expression of
CcGCC1 during fruit external maturation in clementine,
flavedo tissues collected before (September), during
(November) and after fruit colour break (January), were
subject to RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR
with CcGCC1 specific primers. Figure 5A shows that the
expression level of CcGCC1 in clementine increased
about 15-fold during flavedo ripening, while 39B3
mutant maintained low expression levels in November
and only experienced a slight increase in January. A
similar change on CcGCC1 expression was observed in
39E7 mutant when samples harvested in November
were assayed (Figure 5B). These results confirmed that
CcGCC1 gene expression was induced during colour
break of clementine fruits whereas mutants 39B3 and
39E7 affected in the rate of colour break were unable to
properly express the gene.
To determine if the expression of CcGCC1 gene was
also responsive to other factors modulating colour
change, a further experiment using external applications
of gibberellins was performed (Figure 6). Gibberellins
(GA) operate as colour change retardants during fruit
external maturation since GA application on green flavedo causes a significant delay in colour break [14,15].
Forty-two days after the first application, fruits treated
periodically with gibberellin A 3 showed a delay of
about 10 colour units with respect to untreated fruits
(Figure 6A). Interestingly, the GA-dependent retard in
peel colour was accompanied by a parallel delay in
CcGCC1 induction (Figure 6B). These results indicate
that CcGCC1 also responds to the GA-dependent pathway regulating flavedo ripening and taken together with
the previous observations suggest the participation of
CcGCC1 in a regulatory pathway acting in parallel or
subsequently to colour break processes.

Conclusions
In this work, the citrus mutants 39B3 and 39E7 showing
a delay in fruit colour change have been phenotypically
characterized and used to identify through the analyses
of their transcriptomes about 160 genes that were
directly related to peel ripening. The results indicated
that the 39B3 genotype exhibits a simple delay in the

rate of flavedo colouration, while 39E7 shows an additional altered pattern of carotenoid accumulation. We
postulate that the yellowish colour of fully ripe 39E7 flavedo was due to a defective synthesis or accumulation
of b-citraurin. Analyses of differentially expressed genes
revealed that colour change during peel ripening was
strongly associated with a major mobilization of mineral
elements and other previously known metabolic and
photosynthetic changes. Transcriptomic data also
showed that expression of CcGCC1 gene coding for a

1

transcription factor containing GARP and coiled-coil
domains, was strongly down-regulated in flavedo tissue
of both mutants. Application of gibberellin to green
fruits postponed colour break and abolish the induction
of CcGCC1 expression. Taken together the results indicated that CcGCC1 down-regulation correlated with a
delay in colour break induced by genetic, developmental
and hormonal cues.

Methods
Plant material

About 7 years-old clementine trees (Citrus clementina
Hort. Ex Tan. cv. clemenules) were grown at the

Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA)
under standard agricultural practices. The 39B3 and
39E7 mutants were obtained by fast neutrons irradiation
of clemenules buds [43].
GA3 treatment

Individually labelled fruits were periodically treated ontree with 60 mg/L gibberellin A3 (GA3) (Sigma). In each
treatment, fruits on four adult trees were sprayed every
3 days from October 7 (189 days after anthesis) to
November 18 (231 days after anthesis). After colour
index determination (see below), flavedo tissue from
treated and untreated trees was collected at three different dates: September 12 (previous to GA3 treatment),
October 25 and November 18 [15].
Colour index determination

The L, a, and b Hunter lab parameters of the colour
system were measured on the flavedo surface with a
Minolta CR-200 chromameter. The values presented are
the results of the 1000 a/Lb transformation that results
in negative and positive values for the green and orange
colours, respectively, in citrus fruit [44]. In this

transformation, the zero value coincides with the midpoint of the colour break period. Eight and twenty fruits
were measured per sample for the colour change curve
and the GA experiment respectively.
Extraction and quantification of chlorophylls and
carotenoids

Flavedo pigments were extracted as previously described
[17]. Briefly, frozen ground material (500 mg) of flavedo
was extracted with a mixture of methanol and 50 mM
Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 M NaCl and partitioned against chloroform until plant material was uncoloured. The chlorophyll (a+b) content was determined by
measuring the absorbance of the extracts at 644 nm and
662 nm and calculated according to the Smith and
Benitez equations [45]. After chlorophylls measurement,
the pigment ethereal solution was dried and saponified
using a KOH methanolic solution. The carotenoids were
subsequently re-extracted with diethyl ether. Extracts
were dried under N2 and kept at -20 ºC until HPLC analysis. Prior to HPLC analysis, carotenoid extracts were
dissolved in acetone and incubated overnight at -20ºC to
precipitate sterols that could interfere in the carotenoid
analysis and subsequently dried under N2.
Carotenoid composition of each sample was analyzed
by HPLC with a Waters liquid chromatography system

equipped with a 600E pump and a model 996 photodiode array detector, and Empower software (Waters). A
C30 carotenoid column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) coupled
to a C30 guard column (20 × 4.0 mm, 5 μm) (YMC
Europe GMBH) was used. Samples were prepared for
HPLC by dissolving the dried carotenoid extracts in
CHCl3: MeOH: acetone (3:2:1, v:v:v). A ternary gradient
elution with MeOH, water and methyl tert-butyl ether
(MTBE) was used for carotenoid separation reported in
previous works [17,46]. Briefly, the initial solvent composition consisted of 90% MeOH, 5% water and 5%
MTBE. The solvent composition changed in a linear
fashion to 95% MeOH and 5% MTBE at 12 min. During
the next 8 min the solvent composition was changed to
86% MeOH and 14% MTBE. After reaching this concentration the solvent was gradually changed to 75% MeOH
and 25% MTBE at 30 min. Final composition was
reached at 50 min and consisted of 50% MeOH and
50% MTBE. Initial conditions were re-established in
2 min and re-equilibrated for 15 min before next injection. The flow rate was 1 mL/min, column temperature
was set to 25°C and the injection volume was 20 μL.
The photodiode array detector was set to scan from 250
to 540 nm, and for each elution a Maxplot chromatogram was obtained, which plots each carotenoid peak at
its corresponding maximum absorbance wavelength. Carotenoids were identified by comparison of the spectra and
retention time with those of authentic standards, when
available, or by matching the observed versus literature
spectral data and retention time under identical chromatographic conditions [12,46,47]. The carotenoid peaks were
integrated at their individual maxima wavelength and their
content were calculated using calibration curves of
b-apo-8’-carotenal (a gift from Hoffman-LaRoche) for
apo-8’-carotenal and b-citraurin, b-cryptoxanthin (Extrasynthese) for a- and b-cryptoxanthin, lutein (Sigma) for
lutein, neoxanthin, violaxanthin isomers and mutatoxanthin, zeaxanthin (Extrasynthese) for zeaxanthin and
antheraxanthin, and b-carotene (Sigma). Standards of phytoene, phytofluene and ζ-carotene for quantification were
obtained from flavedo extracts of Pinalate fruits, which
accumulate large amounts of these compounds [17], and
afterward purified by TLC.
Samples were extracted at least twice and each analytical determination was replicated at least once. All
operations were carried out on ice under dim light to
prevent photodegradation, isomerisations and structural
changes of carotenoids.
Expression profiling

Total RNA was isolated from flavedo of clementine and
mutant fruits collected in November, using RNeasy
Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). The transcripts present in
1.5 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed, amplified

and labelled with the Amino Allyl MessageAmp™II
aRNA Amplification kit (Ambion), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescent dyes
coupled to the aRNA were obtained from the CyDye™Post-Labeling Reactive Dye Pack (Amersham). Purified
Cy5 and Cy3 labelled probes (200 pmol each) were
combined, diluted with water to a final volume of 9 μL,
and fragmented using the RNA Fragmentation Reagents
(Ambion). Fragmented samples were heat-denatured for
2 min at 80 ºC, mixed with 50 μL of pre-heated hybridization buffer (5 × SSC, 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 0.1
mg/mL salmon sperm DNA) and applied to the microarray slide prehybridized in 5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1% BSA,
for at least 1 h at 42 ºC. We employed the 20 K Citrus
cDNA microarrays containing 21240 EST generated by
the Spanish Citrus Functional Genomics Project
[22,48,49]. Three biological replicates of each mutant
were compared to three replicates of control in a dyeswap experiment requiring six slides per mutant.
Hybridization was performed overnight at 42 ºC. After
hybridization, slides were washed 5 min twice at 42 ºC
in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS followed by two washes at room
temperature for 5 min in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, then by
5 washes at room temperature for 1 min in 0.1 × SSC
and rinsed briefly in 0.01 × SSC before drying by centrifugation at 300 rpm 5 min.
Arrays were scanned at 5 μm. Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence intensity was recorded by using a ScanArray
Gx (Perkin Elmer). The resulting images were overlaid
and spots identified by the ScanArray Express program
(Perkin Elmer). Spot quality was first measured by the
signal-to-background method with parameters lower
limit (200) and multiplier (2), and subsequently confirmed by visual test. Data analysis was performed using
the Limma package from the R statistical computing
software [50]. A mutant/wild type signal higher than 2
or lower than 0.5, with a P-value not higher than 10-5
were the cut-off values for positive EST identification.
The 39B3 and 39E7 microarray experiments have been
loaded into the ArrayExpress database under accessions
E-MEXP-2638 and E-MEXP-2641, respectively.
Quantitative RT-PCR

Total RNA was isolated from excised flavedo using
RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA concentration
was determined by a fluorometric assay with the RiboGreen dye (Molecular Probes) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Five μg of total RNA was reverse
transcribed with the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) in a total volume
of 20 μL. Two μL of a 20 times diluted first-strand
cDNA was used for each amplification reaction. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on a LightCycler
2.0 instrument (Roche), using the LightCycler FastStart

DNA MasterPLUS SYBR Green I kit (Roche). Reaction
composition and conditions followed manufacturer’s
instructions. The primers employed were 5’-CCGAGAAGTTGTCTGAGCTAGA-3’ and 5’-CCCACAAGACTGCTTTTCTTCT-3’, which amplified a fragment
of 164 base pairs on a cDNA template. Cycling protocol
consisted of 10 min at 95°C for pre-incubation, then 40
cycles of 10 sec at 95°C for denaturation, 10 sec at 60°C
for annealing and 10 sec at 72°C for extension. Fluorescent intensity data were acquired during the extension
time. Specificity of the PCR reaction was assessed by the
presence of a single peak in the dissociation curve after
the amplification and through size estimation of the
amplified product by gel electrophoresis. For expression
measurements, we used the absolute quantification analysis from the LightCycler Software 4.0 package (Roche),
and calculated expression levels relative to values of a
reference sample. Reference sample was flavedo from
the parental clementine in Figure 5 and flavedo tissue
before GA application in Figure 6. Results were the
average of 3 independent biological replicates repeated
twice.
Phylogenetic analysis

The fused sequences of the GARP and coiled-coil
domains of CcGCC1 and other 18 proteins obtained
or deduced from databases were aligned with the
ClustalW2 program [51]. Phylogenetic analysis was
performed using programs from the PHYLIP.
group, PHYLogeny Inference Package, Version 3.6
[52,53]. A distance matrix was computed according to
the Dayhoff PAM model by the program Protdist and
then it was used as input for the program Neighbor,
where the Neighbor-joining method of clustering was
selected. A bootstrap analysis based on 1000 replicates
was performed. CrPSR1 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was defined as the outgroup species.
