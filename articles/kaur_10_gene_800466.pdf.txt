Abstract
Background: Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is a ubiquitous enzyme catalyzing the reversible hydration of CO2 to
bicarbonate, a reaction underlying diverse biochemical and physiological processes. Gamma class carbonic anhydrases
(γ-CAs) are widespread in prokaryotes but their physiological roles remain elusive. At present, only γ-CA of
Methanosarcina thermophila (Cam) has been shown to have CA activity. Genome analysis of a rhizobacterium
Azospirillum brasilense, revealed occurrence of ORFs encoding one β-CA and two γ-CAs.
Results: One of the putative γ-CA encoding genes of A. brasilense was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli. Electrometric
assays for CA activity of the whole cell extracts overexpressing recombinant GCA1 did not show CO2 hydration activity.
Reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated that gca1 in A. brasilense is co-transcribed with its upstream gene
annotated as argC, which encodes a putative N-acetyl-γ-glutamate-phosphate reductase. 5'-RACE also demonstrated
that there was no transcription start site between argC and gca1, and the transcription start site located upstream of
argC transcribed both the genes (argC-gca1). Using transcriptional fusions of argC-gca1 upstream region with
promoterless lacZ, we further demonstrated that gca1 upstream region did not have any promoter and its transcription
occurred from a promoter located in the argC upstream region. The transcription of argC-gca1 operon was upregulated
in stationary phase and at elevated CO2 atmosphere.
Conclusions: This study shows lack of CO2 hydration activity in a recombinant protein expressed from a gene
predicted to encode a γ-carbonic anhydrase in A. brasilense although it cross reacts with anti-Cam antibody raised
against a well characterized γ-CA. The organization and regulation of this gene along with the putative argC gene
suggests its involvement in arginine biosynthetic pathway instead of the predicted CO2 hydration.

Background
Carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) are zinc metalloenzymes which catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate (CO2 + H2O ↔ HCO3- + H+).
This simple interconversion of a membrane-permeable
gas substrate into a membrane-impermeable ionic product is vital to many important biological functions; such
enzymes are thus widely distributed in nature. On the
basis of differences in amino acid sequence and structure,

carbonic anhydrases are divided into five distinct, evolutionarily unrelated gene families: α, β, γ and the recently
discovered δ and ζ [1-4]. The α-CAs are distributed in
animals, plants, algae and bacteria. In mammals various
α-CA isoforms with different subcellular localization and
tissue distribution are implicated in many physiological
processes such as carboxylation/decarboxylation reactions, transport of CO2 and/or HCO3-, pH regulation, ion
exchange, calcification, metabolism of urea, glucose and
lipids, tumorigenicity, bone resorption and many other
physiological and pathological processes [5]. Members of
β-CAs are predominant in plants, algae, archaea and bac-

teria. In photosynthetic organisms β-CAs play an important role in transport and autotrophic fixation of CO2
while in prokaryotes β-CAs are involved in wide range of
cellular functions including provision of HCO3- for carboxylating enzymes which catalyze key steps in biosynthetic pathways for essential metabolites, such as amino
acids, nucleotides, fatty acids [6,7].
The γ-CAs are predominant in bacteria and archaea
domains. In eukaryotes, they have so far been described
only in photosynthetic organisms. While the physiological role of α-CAs in mammals and β-CAs in plants and
prokaryotes, have been extensively studied, the role of γCAs remain elusive. To date, the only γ-CA that has been
extensively characterized is "Cam" from the methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina thermophila [8,9]. In the
cyanobacterium Synechocystis, the bifunctional CcmM
protein localized in carboxysome (structure involved in
CO2 concentration) shows an N-terminal γ-CA like
domain which has been proposed to bind HCO3-/CO2
[10]. However, no carbonic anhydrase activity could be
detected for the recombinant CcmM expressed in E. coli.
Recently, a similar role for binding and transporting
bicarbonate has been proposed for γ-CA subunits of
plant mitochondrial complex, suggesting that the socalled γ-CAs in photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms do
not act as carbonic anhydrases but may have related
activity contributing to CO2 recycling in photorespiration, or play a role in the carbon transport between mitochondria and chloroplasts to increase the efficiency of
photosynthetic CO2 fixation [11].
Unraveling of microbial genome sequences has shown
that γ-CAs are widespread in prokaryotes, and it is likely
that these enzymes play diverse roles in microorganisms.
Investigations into the ways in which archaea and bacteria domains use γ-carbonic anhydrase may reveal novel
aspects of prokaryotic physiology. We are analyzing the
role of carbonic anhydrases in a nonphotosynthetic,
Gram-negative, plant growth promoting α-proteobacterium, Azospirillum brasilense that lives in close association with the roots of several important crop plants and
grasses and stimulates the growth of its host plant by producing phytohormones and siderophores [12]. Earlier, we
have cloned the gene encoding β-CA from A. brasilense,
overexpresed, purified and characterized β-CA. We also
showed that the transcription of bca gene was down regulated by stationary phase, elevated CO2 and acidic pH
[13]. The objective of this study was to study the role of a
putative gene encoding γ-carbonic anhydrase in A. brasilense Sp7.

Results
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of gca1 of A. brasilense

A search for the presence of ORFs annotated as carbonic
anhydrase in the genome of A. brasilense Sp245 http://

genome.ornl.gov/microbial/abra/ revealed three ORFs
out of which two were annotated to encode carbonic
anhydrase/acetyltransferase. BLAST results of the amino
acid sequences of these two ORFs showed homology with
putative γ-CAs. Using the sequence information from A.
brasilense Sp245 genome, one of the putative γ-CA ORF
(gca1) of A. brasilense Sp7 was PCR amplified, and
sequenced. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid
sequence of the A. brasilense Sp7 gca1 and the putative γCA of A. brasilense Sp245 were 97% and 99% identical,
respectively. The gca1 ORF consisted of 519 bp, which
can translate a polypeptide of 173 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 19 kDa. BLASTP analysis of the
deduced amino acid sequence of A. brasilense Gca1
revealed 27% identity with Cam, a γ-CA from M. thermophila. In addition to its homology with putative γ-CAs,
Gca1 also showed significant homology to proteins annotated as acetyltransferase/isoleucine patch superfamily
with no predicted function (unknown proteins).
As inferred from X-ray crystallographic studies of Cam,
the active-site zinc is coordinated by three histidine residues [9]. The alignment of Gca1 with the Cam sequence
showed that the essential histidines (His-81, His-117 and
His-122) required for ligating the active site Zn are absolutely conserved in Gca1. Further analysis revealed that
three other residues (Arg-59, Asp-61 and Gln-75) present
in all γ-class CA sequences and reported to be involved in
biochemical activity of Cam of M. thermophila, are also
conserved in Gca1 (Additional file 1 Figure S1). Two glutamate residues, Glu-62 and Glu-84 of Cam, whose role
has been shown in CO2 hydration and proton transfer,
respectively, are conserved in cyanobacterial CcmM
sequence but neither in Gca1 nor in other γ-CA homologues such as Pseudomonas putida (PhaM) and E. coli
(CaiE) which share 36%, and 32% identity, respectively,
with Gca1, suggesting that alternative residues might
serve these roles.
To examine the phylogenetic relationship of A. brasilense Gca1 with other known orthologs, the amino acid
sequences of different γ-CAs from eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms, cyanobacteria, bacteria and archaea
were used to generate multiple sequence alignment and a
phylogenetic tree (Figure 1). The deduced γ-CA amino
acid sequences clustered in two clades; the larger Clade A
consisted of sequences from all three domains of life. The
catalytically important residues of Cam, Glu-62 and Glu84 were missing in these sequences and information
regarding CA activity of protein encoded by any of these
sequences is lacking. Clade B consisted of well documented Cam protein from M. thermophila and cyanobacterial CcmM proteins. Although Cam has been shown to
biochemically function as CA and its physiological role
during acetotrophic growth has been suggested, no CA
activity for CcmM, the closest relative of this CA in the
phylogeny has been reported.

Figure 1 Phylogenetic tree based on neighbor-joining analysis of amino acid sequences of γ-CA from A. brasilense and other organisms.
Putative γ -class carbonic anhydrase sequences were aligned using Clustal W and analyzed with the MEGA version 4.0 [28]. The 2 phylogenetic clades
are indicated by bars on the right. The GenBank accession numbers for the sequences used are indicated in parentheses.

Phylogenetic analysis suggests that γ-class is largely
populated with homologs of a subclass that lack proton
shuttle residues essential for Cam, and the deduced Gca1
sequence of A. brasilense falls in this subclass along with
orthologs from closely related members of α- proteobacteria, viz. Magnetospirillum magneticum, Rhodospirillum
rubrum,
Rhodospirillum
centenum
and
Granulibacter bethesdensis.
Analysis of gca1 gene transcript in minimal and rich
medium

Before extending the study on functional analysis of gca1
in A. brasilense, the expression of gca1 gene in A. brasilense cells was examined. Cell extracts of A. brasilense
showed very low level of carbonic anhydrase activity of
0.3 ± 0.1 U/mg. Since A. brasilense genome also encodes
a functional β-CA [13], it was not clear if the observed
CA activity was due to β-CA or also due to γ-CA. To
determine whether gca1 is expressed in A. brasilense

under ambient conditions, RT-PCR with RNA samples
isolated from the mid-log phase cultures grown in minimal (MMAB) or rich (LB) medium was performed. The
~500 bp gca1 transcripts was produced from both the
RNA samples (Figure 2) which was confirmed by
sequencing the cDNA amplicons. These results indicated
that A. brasilense gca1 is constitutively expressed in cells
grown in minimal or rich medium under ambient atmospheric conditions.
Characterization of protein encoded by gca1

To examine whether gca1 gene encoded a functionally
active protein, the gca1 ORF was amplified from the A.
brasilense Sp7 genomic DNA and directionally cloned
into the pET15b to construct an over-expression plasmid,
pSK7 which, after confirmation by sequencing, was used
for expression in E. coli and purification of the recombinant protein. SDS-PAGE analysis of extracts from uninduced versus induced cultures showed the presence of a

protein of the expected size in the induced cells (Figure
3A). The size of the recombinant Gca1 (ca. 21 kDa) was
larger than the predicted polypeptide size (19 kDa) due to
the additional vector-encoded His-tag at the N-terminus
of the protein. The recombinant protein was purified to
homogeneity under denaturing conditions (Figure 3B). A
clear band of purified protein in the position corresponding to the overexpressed protein in the crude lysate was
visualized on the gel (Figure 3B). This band cross-reacted
with anti-Cam antiserum (Figure 3C). The recognition of
recombinant Gca1 with heterologous antibody indicates
significant similarity between Gca1 and Cam.

the same CA activity assay conditions, α-bovine CAII
showed specific CA activity of about 1024 WAU/mg,
respectively. These results indicate that the supernatant
fractions containing soluble recombinant Gca1 lacked
detectable CO2 hydration activity.
Construction of gca1 knockout (Δgca1) mutant

In order to gain an insight into the possible physiological
role of Gca1 in A. brasilense, attempt was made to construct a Δgca1 of A. brasilense Sp7 by inserting kanamycin resistance gene cassette into the coding region of gca1
but in spite of repeated attempts no gca1 mutant could be
isolated. Since deletion of CA gene generally results in
high CO2 requiring (HCR) phenotype [14], attempts were
also made to isolate the desired mutants at 3% CO2 concentration (the highest CO2 concentration at which A.
brasilense Sp7 is able to grow). The inability to obtain γCA knock-out mutant under aerobic atmosphere as well
as under the atmosphere containing 3% CO2 probably
reflects that this putative γ-CA might be essential for the
survival and growth of A. brasilense in the atmosphere
containing ambient to 3% levels of CO2. Since bicarbonate is a substrate for carboxylating enzymes central to
many metabolic processes [6], attempts were also made
to restore Δgca1 by supplementing the minimal medium
with some metabolic intermediates (as mentioned in
Methods). Unfortunately, none of these supplements rescued Δgca1 of A. brasilense suggesting that the putative
Gca1 protein might have physiological implications other
than hydration of CO2.
Bioinformatic analysis of gca1 organization: Prediction of
argC-gca1 operon in A. brasilense

While analyzing the organization of gca1 chromosomal
region of A. brasilense using genome database and NCBI
database BLAST resources, a putative gene (annotated as
argC) was identified that was located upstream of gca1
ORF in the same transcriptional orientation with an
intergenic distance of 35 nucleotides (Figure 4). The argC
gene product (351 amino acids) of A. brasilense shared
high similarity with the ArgC protein of R. centenum, M.
magneticum and R. rubrum. The N-acetyl-gamma-glutamate-phosphate reductase (EC 1.2.1.38) encoded by argC
is involved in the arginine biosynthesis in prokaryotes
[15]. The arginine biosynthetic pathway proceeds via Nacetylation of L-glutamate by N-acetylglutamate synthase
(ArgA) yielding N-acetylglutamate which is converted
into N-acetylglutamyl-phosphate by N-acetylglutamate
5-phosphotransferase encoded by argB. N-acetylglutamyl-phosphate is subsequently reduced to N-acetylglutamic semialdehyde by N-acetylglutamyl-phosphate
reductase, encoded by the argC gene. Thus the ArgC protein catalyses the third step in the pathway of biosynthesis
of arginine from glutamate [15].

Several studies have shown that short intergenic distance between ORFs and phylogenetically conserved
gene order are important generalized predictor of operon
structure [16]. Thus, conservation of this adjacent, codirectional gene-pair might link apparently unrelated
argC and gca1 genes in a co-transcriptional relationship.
In order to test this possibility, the chromosomal neighbourhoods of gca1 orthologs in sequenced bacterial
genomes of the members of phylogenetic tree (Figure 1)
including both distant and close relatives of A. brasilense
were analyzed. Interestingly, this gene order was found to
be fairly well conserved in some of the sequenced members of Rhodobacteriaceae such as M. magneticum, R.
rubrum and R. centenum (Figure 4). A similar syntenic
organization was also observed in a member of Acetobacteriaceae (Granulibacter bethesdensis), but not in other
bacterial genomes in which gca1 homologs are found.
Examination of the intergenic distance between argC and
γ-CA encoding genes revealed a distance of only 8 nt in
M. magneticum and G. bethesdensis, 35 nt in A. brasilense
and 58 nt in R. rubrum whereas in R. centenum a gene
encoding a protein of unknown function present between

these two genes. Thus, a conserved gene order of argCgca1 and relatively short intergenic distance in A. brasilense and phylogenetically close members suggested that
these two adjacent codirectional genes might comprise a
bicistronic operon and also the possibility of functional
and/or regulatory relationship between the two genes.
The synteny with regard to the two other ORFs encoding
30 S and 50 S ribosomal subunit proteins, respectively,
located upstream of the argC gene was observed in A.
brasilense as well as in G. bethesdensis and R. centenum
but not in other closely related bacteria.
Confirmation of the transcriptional linkage of the argCgca1 ORFs

To determine if argC and gca1 genes are part of a single
operon and transcribed as a single mRNA, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) experiments were performed
using total RNA isolated from A. brasilense cultures using
three different primer sets, (Table 1 and Figure 5C)
gcaF1/gcaR1 to amplify gca1 ORF (519 bp), argF/argR1
for 687 bp portion of argC ORF and argF1/gcaR3 to
amplify the transcript (625 bp) encompassing both argC

Kaur et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:184
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/184

and gca1 ORFs. Analysis of RT-PCR amplified product
revealed that argF1/gcaR3 primer set produced a fragment of expected size (ca. 600) indicating that there was a
single mRNA for these two genes. Amplicons of expected
size, ca 700 bp and ca 500 bp, were also obtained with
argC and gca1-specific primer sets, respectively (Figure
5A). RT-PCR analysis confirmed that these genes are, in
fact, co-transcribed which suggests a new functional linkage between the two genes that may have interesting
implications for A. brasilense physiology.
Determination of transcription start site of argC-gca1
transcript

Co-transcription of argC-gca1, confirmed by RT-PCR,
prompted us to determine the transcription start site
(TSS) and promoter elements involved in the regulation
of this operon. We were also interested to examine if gca1
has its own TSS which could be used to regulate transcription of only gca1 from a promoter located upstream
of gca1 somewhere in argC ORF. For this purpose, we
performed 5'RACE experiment using RNA sample isolated from A. brasilense Sp7. In the first step of 5'RACE
experiment, we used gcaR1 for cDNA synthesis as this
primer could drive the synthesis of cDNAs from both
types of transcripts (from argC-gca1 and gca1), if present.

In the later reactions, the respective nested primers were
used (as described in materials and methods) to amplify
regions upstream of argC and gca1. Amplicons obtained
in both cases, with gca1 and argC specific nested primers,
showed a single transcription start from a C residue
located at position -94 relative to the predicted translational start site of argC (Figure 5B and 5C) indicating the
presence of only one TSS for this predicted operon
located upstream of argC ORF. Analysis of the region
upstream the identified TSS for corresponding promoter
elements (sequences at -35 and -10 regions) indicated the
presence of CTACCG at -35 and GTACAA at -10 of TSS
with a spacing of 17 nt. Eight base pairs upstream from
the ATG initiation codon, a consensus AAGGAA ShineDalgarno sequence for ribosome binding was found (Figure 5C).
Inducibility of argC-gca1 operon in response to stationary
phase and high CO2

After the confirmation of co-transcription by RT-PCR
and determination of transcription start site by 5'RACE
experiment which suggested the transcription of argC
and gca1 genes from a promoter located upstream of
argC ORF, we examined the regulation of argC-gca1
operon in response to different conditions. For this purpose, - 455 to + 79 of TSS of argC-gca1 was inserted
upstream of the promoterless lacZ reporter in pRKK200
to make transcriptional fusion (pSK8), and β-galactosidase assay was performed with cells of A. brasilense harboring pSK8 and grown in MMAB in different
conditions.
Comparison of β-galactosidase activity in the cells
taken from exponential and stationary phase cultures
(Figure 6) showed that PargC activity was significantly upregulated (more than 2 fold) during stationary phase than
in the exponential phase of growth. Similarly, β-galactosidase activity measured in exponentially growing cells of
A. brasilense harboring pSK8 under 3% CO2 enriched
atmosphere was ~3 fold higher than the cells grown in
ambient atmosphere (Figure 6). These data suggested that
the PargC is constitutively but weakly expressed in exponentially growing cells under optimal growth conditions
but significantly induced in response to high CO2 or stationary phase.
In order to further confirm whether gca1 has its own
promoter, an additional construct (pSK9) was made by
inserting -501 to - 11 of predicted translational start of
gca1 in the same vector (pRKK200). No β-galactosidase
activity could be detected with cells of A. brasilense
strains harboring pSK9 under any of the above conditions
(data not shown) indicating that there is no promoter
upstream of gca1. This result further confirmed the previously noted single TSS by 5'RACE experiment for argC-

gca1 operon and no independent transcription start site
for gca1. Thus the results obtained from 5'RACE experiment and promoter analysis is in agreement with the
notion that transcription of argC-gca1 operon is regulated by a single promoter located upstream of argC.
As argC is involved in arginine biosynthesis in prokaryotes, and arginine biosynthetic genes are normally
induced in response to arginine limitation as might be the
case in stationary phase when arginine becomes limiting
[17]. To ascertain if the induction of PargC in stationary
phase is a consequence of arginine limitation, promoter
activity assay was performed with the cells harbouring
pSK8 taken from exponential phase and stationary phase
cultures grown in minimal media supplemented with Larginine (0.1, 0.5, 1mM). No difference was found in the
β-galactosidase activity in cultures lacking/supplemented
with exogenous arginine (data not shown). As supplementation with exogenous arginine did not affect the

activity of PargC in either exponential or stationary phase,
it is likely that regulation of expression of argC-gca1
operon is arginine independent.

Discussion
Availability of bacterial genome sequences has opened a
new range of possibilities to elucidate the functions of
these sequences, thus providing biochemical, physiological, evolutionary, and ecological meaning to the nucleotide sequence data. Release of partial genome sequence
of A. brasilense has allowed the characterization of different genes that might be involved in the physiology of this
plant growth promoting bacterium. A. brasilense genome
revealed the presence of one β-CA and two putative γ-CA
encoding genes. Recently, we have shown that β-CA gene
in A. brasilense encoded a functionally active protein, and
its expression was regulated by growth phase, CO2 concentration and pH [13]. In this work, one of the putative

Figure 6 27 Effect of growth phase and CO2 concentration on
argC-gca1 promoter activity β-galactosidase assay was performed with A. brasilense Sp7 cells harbouring either pRKK200
(empty vector) or pSK8 and grown up to either exponential or
stationary phase at ambient air, and exponential growing cells at
high CO2 concentration. The assay was performed on two different
occasions. The error bars indicate standard deviation from the three
replicates.

ORFs whose amino acid sequence shared significant
identity with other members of the γ-CA family was characterized.
The cell-free extracts having overexpressed recombinant Gca1 protein did not show CA activity under the
conditions tested. Similar lack of detectable CA activity
as found in case of recombinant Gca1 protein was also
observed in recombinant γ-CA of Arabidopsis [18], two
cyanobacterial CcmM orthologs [10], E. coli proteins
YrdA, CaiE, and PaaY [19], γ-CA-like proteins from C.
glutamicum [6] and C. reinhardii [20]. It is interesting to
note that since the discovery of CA activity in Cam in
1994, all reported tests for CA activity in Cam homologs
have proven negative although structural modelling and
sequence analyses showed homology with the overall fold
of Cam and conservation of the residues essential for
metal binding and catalysis, except Glu-62 and Glu-84.
Also, antibodies directed against Cam specifically recognized Gca1 (Figure 3C) and mitochondrial γ-CAs [18].
As no Δgca1 mutant could be isolated under the tested
conditions, the functional role of Gca1 was analyzed by
examining its neighboring genes. Conservation of the
gene order in prokaryotes has been considered as one of
the important predictors of gene function that helps in
speculating the function of a gene based on its neighborhood or gene organization [16]. The inspection of the
genome sequences of other bacteria revealed that the
Gca1 homologues found in bacteria phylogenetically
close to A. brasilense had a striking synteny for gca locus.
On the basis of short intergenic distance and phylogenetically conserved organization of argC-gca1, an operonlike organization of the two genes, argC and gca1 in A.

brasilense was predicted. RT-PCR analysis revealed a
transcript encompassing argC and gca1 genes confirming
that argC-gca1 genes were co-transcribed in A. brasilense. In addition, 5'RACE experiment confirmed a single
transcription start site located upstream of argC, and a
lack of independent TSS for gca1. One of the major
advantages of operon prediction in relatively less investigated organisms is that in many cases we may be able to
link hypothetical genes to more-well-characterized loci
and thus gain some insight into the possible function and
regulation of the uncharacterized gene(s).
As γ-CAs of plant mitochondrial complex have recently
been proposed to be involved in binding/transporting
CO2/bicarbonate [11], it is intriguing to note that the
putative γ-CAs of α- and γ-proteobacteria (considered as
mitochondrial ancestors) may also be inactive with
respect to CA activity and only bind CO2 and/or bicarbonate in the context of different physiological processes.
In the present case, on the basis of the induction of argCgca1 promoter activity in response to high CO2, and lack
of detectable CA activity of Gca1, it can be speculated
that Gca1, like mitochondrial γ-CA, might also be
involved in binding of CO2/HCO3- to provide the substrates to different metabolic enzymes, and may not act as
carbonic anhydrase.
The amino acid sequence of γ-CAs also showed significant similarity with proteins belonging to hexapeptide
repeat family composed mainly of acetyl transferases [2123] and since the biosynthesis of arginine from glutamate
proceeds through several N-acetylated intermediates
[15], it is possible that Gca1 might be involved in the
acetylation of some intermediate/s in the arginine biosynthetic pathway.
Promoter activity data also indicate that the regulation
of argC-gca1 promoter is not affected by exogenous arginine. The lack of repression of the A. brasilense argCgca1 genes by arginine is consistent with the data
reported on the activities of arginine biosynthetic
enzymes in various bacteria and cyanobacteria that
exhibit a cyclic pathway of ornithine synthesis, where the
regulatory mechanism appears to rely mostly on feedback
inhibition by arginine of the second enzyme, N-acetylglutamate phosphotransferase [15]. Under nutrient-limiting
conditions during stationary phase, arginine is an important metabolite as it can act both as a carbon and nitrogen source. Arginine is also a precursor for the synthesis
of polyamines, putrescine and spermidine, which may
reduce oxidative damage to proteins and DNA. Since in
E. coli, arginine constitutes 11% of the cell's nitrogen in
stationary phase, biosynthesis of this amino acid is
thought to be important under sub-optimal conditions
[17]. This is the first report showing the role of CO2 in the
regulation of argC expression in any bacteria. Although

Kaur et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:184
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/184

the precise role of argC in arginine biosynthesis in A.
brasilense is not yet established, it is likely that the high
metabolic CO2 generated during stationary phase up-regulates arginine biosynthetic genes, including argC-gca1
operon alleviating arginine limitation in the nutrient
starved stationary phase cells. The induction of argCgca1 operon during stationary phase and at high CO2
observed in this study suggests a possible regulatory link
between arginine metabolism and another not yet characterized carbon dioxide-dependent process in which
Gca1 like protein might have a role to play.

Conclusion
This study shows lack of CO2 hydration activity in the
recombinant γ-CA-like protein from A. brasilense. The
unique operonic organization of gca1 and argC, observed
in A. brasilense is syntenous with some of its closely
related α-proteobacteria, viz. Magnetospirillum, Rhodospirillum, Granulibacter etc. This suggests that the γCA-like gene cotranscribed with argC gene in A. brasilense, instead of being involved in CO2 hydration, may
have a role in arginine biosynthesis.
Methods
Bacterial strains, culture conditions, plasmids and
chemicals

Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table
2. A. brasilense Sp7 was grown in minimal medium
(MMAB) containing malate (37 mM) and NH4Cl (10
mM) as sole source of carbon and nitrogen, respectively
[24] or on Luria-Agar at 30°C. E. coli strains like DH5α
(Gibco-BRL), S.17.1 were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB)
medium and BL21λ (DE3) pLysS (Novagen) in Terrific
broth (TB) medium at 37°C in the presence of appropriate antibiotics where required. E. coli DH5α was used as
plasmid host and BL21λ (DE3) pLysS was used as expression system. Plasmid pET15b (Novagen) and pRKK200
[25] were used for expression and for construction of promoter: lacZ fusions, respectively. All chemicals used for
growing bacteria were from Hi-media (India), chemicals
used in enzymatic assays were purchased from Sigma
(USA) and enzymes used for DNA modification and
cloning were from New England Biolabs (UK). Plasmid
isolation kits and gel elution or purification kits were purchased from Qiagen (USA) and Promega (USA), respectively.
Construction of γ -CA expression plasmid

Over-expression construct for heterologous expression of
A. brasilense gca1 was constructed by cloning (in-frame)
the PCR-amplified gca1 gene of A. brasilense into the
expression vector pET15b (Novagen), digested with
NdeI/BamHI. The complete coding region of A. brasi-

Page 9 of 12

lense gca1 gene was amplified by PCR using primers
gca1F/gca1R (Table 1). The amplicon was digested with
NdeI/BamHI, PCR-purified and ligated with the similarly
digested expression vector pET15b (Novagen) to generate
the plasmid pSK7. E. coli DH5α was then transformed
with the ligation mix and the transformants were selected
on Luria agar with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). After verification of the clones by restriction digestion and sequencing,
E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS competent cells were transformed with the plasmid pSK7, and transformants were
selected on Luria agar with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) or
ampicillin(100 μg/ml)/chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml)
respectively.
Expression, purification and western blot analysis of
recombinant Gca1

For expression of recombinant protein, the E. coli BL21
(DE3) pLysS cells harboring pSK7 were cultured overnight in Terrific-Broth medium containing appropriate
antibiotics at 37°C, diluted with 1:100 fresh medium containing antibiotics and incubated at 37°C with shaking at
150 rpm. When OD600 reached a value of about 0.6, the
expression of His.tag-Gca1 was induced by adding 1 mM
IPTG in the presence of 500 μM ZnSO4 for an additional
6 h at 28°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation
and resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-SO4, pH 8.0,
300 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM β-ME, 100 μm
ZnSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100), lysed with lysozyme (1 mg/
ml) followed by sonication at 4°C with six 10 s bursts and
10 s cooling period between each burst. Following centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C), supernatant
fractions were run on 15% SDS-PAGE, and stained with
Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (CBB) to determine the
profile of recombinant Gca1 expression. The recombinant protein was purified under denaturing conditions
using Ni-NTA resin according to manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, USA). Immunoblots with purified recombinant Gca1 were performed on PVDF membrane
(Immobilon, Millipore) (Bio-Rad, USA) using anti-Cam
[8] and goat anti-rabbit IgG- alkaline phosphatase conjugate antibodies. The antibody-antigen complex was
detected with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate and
4-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride.
Assay for carbonic anhydrase

CA activity in cell extracts was assayed using a modified
electrometric method [26]. The assays were performed at
0 to 4°C by adding varying amounts of cell extract (10-100
μl) to 3.0 ml Tris-SO4 buffer, pH 8.3, and the reaction was
initiated by adding 2.0 ml ice-cold CO2-saturated water.
The enzyme activity was determined by monitoring the
time required for the pH of the assay solution to change
from pH 8.3 to 6.3. The pH change resulting from CO2

hydration was measured using a Beetrode microelectrode
and Dri-Ref system (World Precision Instruments) connected to the pH meter. An α-type bovine CAII (Sigma)
was used as a positive control. One Wilbur-Anderson
unit (WAU) of activity is defined as (T0 - T)/T, where T0
(uncatalyzed reaction) and T (catalyzed reaction) are
recorded as the time required for the pH to drop from 8.3
to 6.3 in a buffer control and cell extract, respectively.
Protein concentration was determined using the Folin'sLowry assay using BSA as standard. Specific activity was
expressed as WAU/mg of protein.
Construction of gca1 knockout mutant in A. brasilense Sp7

Attempt was made to produce gca1 knockout mutant (or
Δgca1 mutant) of A. brasilense Sp7 by replacing the chromosomal wild copy with the mutated copy that was inactivated by inserting kanamycin resistance cassette and
located on a suicide plasmid. Primers were designed to
amplify gca1 gene along with its flanking region in two
parts, amplicons A and B. The amplicon A (amplified
with primers gcAF/gcAR, Table 1) was of 1050 bp, which
included half of the 5' region of gca1 with its upstream
flanking region. The amplicon B (amplified with primers
gcBF/gcBR, Table 1) was of 1453 bp, which has half of the
3'gene with its downstream flanking region. The primers
were designed so as to generate restriction sites for PstI at
5' and BglII at 3' end of the amplicon A, and restriction
sites for BglII at 5' and EcoRI at 3' end of the amplicon B.
The purified PCR products were digested with the
respective enzymes and ligated with the PstI-EcoRI
digested pSUP202 generating pSJ3. Plasmid pUC4K was
digested with BamHI and the Kmr gene cassette of 1300
bp was eluted and cloned at the BglII site of pSJ3 to generate final construct designated as 'gca1 disruption plasmid' or pSJ4 in which the Kmr gene cassette had

disrupted the gca1 ORF. E. coli S.17-1 was then transformed with the disruption plasmid, pSJ4 (Table 2) and
used as donor in a biparental mating experiment wherein
A. brasilense Sp7 was used as recipient. The exconjugants
were selected on MMAB plates supplemented with Km
(40 μg/ml). Several metabolites were used to complement
the lack of gca1 gene to support the growth of the gca1
knockout mutant in 0.033% CO2 (air) or in 3% CO2 atmosphere. The MMAB was enriched with following combination of nutritional supplements: adenine (20 mg/l),
uracil (20 mg/l), L-arginine (20 mg/l), bicarbonate (2 g/l)
and a fatty acid mixture containing myristic, stearic and
palmitic acids (30 mg/l each) and Tween 80 (10 g/l) as
surfactant. Adenine, uracil, L-arginine and bicarbonate
were added from filter-sterilized concentrated stock solutions [14]. The fatty acid mixture was added from a 100fold-concentrated stock solution prepared under sterile
conditions. Plates were incubated at 30°C for 7-15 days
either under a normal air atmosphere or in a CO2 incubator (Thermo-Scientific) with an atmosphere consisting of
3% CO2.
RNA extraction and RT-PCR

Total RNA was extracted from A. brasilense cells taken
from cultures grown up to late-log phase (2.5 to 2.8
OD600nm) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). Isolated sample was treated with 0.05 U RNase free DNAse I
(NEB, UK) per μg of RNA for 30 min at 37°C and purified
by phenol extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.
RT-PCR was carried out with 1-1.5 μg of RNA using onestep RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The cycling condition used
were 50°C for 30 min; 95°C for 15 min; and 30 cycles of
95° for 30 sec, 52-58°C (according to the primer used in

Kaur et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:184
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/184

reaction) for 30 sec and 72°C for 1 min, followed by incubation at 72°C for 10 min. Negative controls were made
with PCR to check for DNA contamination.
5' RACE Experiment

The transcription start site (TSS) for argC and gca1 genes
were determined by 5'RACE experiment using the 3'/
5'RACE kit, 2nd Generation (Roche, Germany) according
to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, total RNA was
isolated from the cells taken from stationary phase cultures of Sp7, and treated with DNase I as described in
RNA extraction and RT-PCR section. The transcripts of
both genes were reverse transcribed into cDNA using
gca1 gene-specific primer, gcaR1 (Table 1, and Figure
4C), as argC and gca1 were predicted to be co-transcribed. The cDNA was purified using High Pure PCR
product purification kit (Roche) and poly (dA) tailed at
their 3' ends. The resulting poly(dA)-tailed cDNA was
used as template in two different PCR reactions designed
to amplify 5' end of gca1 and argC using oligodT-anchor/
gcaR2 and oligodT-anchor/argR1 primer sets, respectively. The oligo dT-anchor primer was provided by the
kit to anneal at the poly(dA) tail and gcaR2 (Table 1, and
Figure 4C) was complementary to a region upstream of
the gcaR1 binding site. The products of the first PCRs
were separately used as template in second PCRs using
anchor/gcaR3 and anchor/argR2 primer sets. Anchor
primer was provided by the kit to anneal at a region generated by oligo dT-anchor primer at 3' end of cDNA, and
gcaR3 and argR2 (Table 1, and Figure 5C) were further
complementary to the region upstream of the gcaR2 and
argR1 binding sites, respectively. The amplified product
obtained was ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and the nucleotide sequence of several distinct
clones was determined in an ABI-PRISM™, 310 Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) using T7 forward and Sp6
reverse universal primers.
Construction of promoter: lacZ fusions

Chromosomal region of A. brasilense (- 455 to + 79 of
TSS) encompassing TSS and promoter elements for argC
was PCR amplified using argPrF/argPrR primers (Table
1), and inserted between KpnI and StuI site of pRKK200
to construct a promoter:lacZ fusion (transcriptional
fusion). In order to examine if gca1 has its own separate
promoter, the upstream region from -501 to -11 of the
predicted translational start site of gca1 was amplified
using gca1PrF/gca1PrR primers and cloned in pRKK200
in a similar way. In both cases amplified products were
digested with KpnI/StuI, and ligated with similarly
digested pRKK200 vector. E. coli DH5α was then transformed with the ligation mix and the transformants were
selected on Luria agar supplemented with kanamycin
(100 μg/ml). After confirmation of recombinant plasmids

Page 11 of 12

by sequencing, the constructs were designated as pSK8
(PargC:lacZ fusion) and pSK9 (Pgca1:lacZ fusion) (Table 2).
These constructs were finally conjugatively mobilized
into A. brasilense Sp7 via E. coli S.17.1 and exconjugants
were selected on MMAB plates supplemented with kanamycin.
β- Galactosidase assay

β-galactosidase assay [27] was performed with the cells of
A. brasilense Sp7 harbouring either pRKK200, pSK8 or
pSK9, and grown in MMAB under different conditions.
To determine the effect of growth phase aliquots of cells
were collected from exponential (0.7 to 0.9 OD600) and
stationary phase (2.3 to 2.5 OD600). To examine the effect
of CO2 concentration, above cells were grown in ambient
air (0.035%) and high CO2 (3%) atmosphere. In order to
study the effect of exogenous arginine, the cells were
grown in MMAB supplemented with 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mM
arginine. At the time of assay, the number of cells in each
culture was equalized by diluting with either fresh
medium or fresh medium supplemented with respective
agents. The assay was performed with 1 ml of equalized
culture in triplicate for each sample on two different
occasions.
