Background
The availability of next generation sequencing (NGS)
technologies has opened the door to new strategies of
SNP discovery and genotyping. Rapid genome-wide SNP
detection via deep resequencing of reduced representation libraries of restriction digested pools of genomic
DNA combined with a reference genome has been successfully used for SNP discovery in microorganisms [1],
plants [2]and domestic animals [3]. Taking a step
further from using NGS for SNP discovery, Baird et al
[1]showed that NGS of short tags derived from barcoded multiplexed genomic representations generated
with restriction enzymes could be used for direct genotyping of individuals, calling this method RAD (Restriction-site associated DNA) sequencing. RAD sequencing
involves cutting a genome with at least one restriction
enzyme and NGS the ends of the resulting fragments.
We have recently developed a first set of SNPs for highthroughput genotyping of species of Eucalyptus.
Although SNP assay success was high, the proportion of
polymorphic SNPs declined as phylogenetic distance
between species increased, down to <20% when contrasting E. grandis and E. globulus, the two main worldwide commercially planted species were considered [4].
In this work we used RAD sequencing to discover polymorphic SNPs across these two species. Additionally we
were interested in assessing the potential of RAD for
direct genotyping-by-sequencing in Eucalyptus.

Methods
DNA was extracted separately from 18 unrelated individual trees of E. grandis and 18 of E. globulus. For each
species three bulks of six individuals were prepared with
equimolar amounts of picogreen quantified DNA. DNA
samples were delivered to Floragenex who carried out
the RAD reduced representation library preparation
using PstI and Illumina 75 bp single-end sequencing on
a GAIIx. Raw sequence data was filtered for quality and
mapped onto the 11 chromosomes of the E. grandis
reference genome available in Phytozome. SNPs in the
short sequence tags were called for nucleotides with
quality Q> 30 at the position and a minimum of 6X
coverage.
Results and conclusions
The average sequencing depth exceeded 28X for all
bulked samples, providing a minimum estimated ~5X
coverage for each individual present in each bulk providing a 93.75% probability of detecting a heterozygous
SNP position. With 18 individuals per species (36 chromosomes), the probability of detecting a SNP allele with
a Minimum Allele Frequency (MAF) > 0.1 is > 95% [5]
therefore providing good power to select informative
SNPs in each species separately and even more so in
both species simultaneously. RAD sequence tags may be
present or absent in specific individuals depending on
the presence of the PstI restriction site providing large
numbers of dominant markers; SNPs detected within
the aligned tags provide additional co-dominant markers
(Figure 1).
Out of a total of 200,712 SNPs declared with high
confidence, 42,300 were simultaneously polymorphic in

the two species while the remaining were fixed in one or
the other. These 42,300 SNPs provide an average density
of one SNP every 14 kbp in the Eucalyptus genome.
These SNPs could be immediately used to select an
evenly spaced set of SNPs for the development of a high
density SNP genotyping platform.
Taken together, the RAD tags plus the SNPs into
them provide excellent marker density for applications
such as Genomic Selection [6]. Besides the RAD
method, Elshire et al. [7] recently described a straightforward method of genotyping-by-sequencing. Additionally the DArT complexity reduction protocol has also
been streamlined based on NGS for a number of plant
genomes including Eucalyptus (see Sansaloni et al. this
meeting). All these NGS based genotyping methods will
cause a paradigm shift in our ability to carry out high
density, high throughput and low-cost genotyping of
large numbers of samples, unlocking incredible opportunities in forest tree genetics and breeding in the years to
come.
