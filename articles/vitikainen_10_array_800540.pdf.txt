Abstract
Background: Trichoderma reesei is the main industrial producer of cellulases and hemicellulases that are used to
depolymerize biomass in a variety of biotechnical applications. Many of the production strains currently in use have
been generated by classical mutagenesis. In this study we characterized genomic alterations in high-producing
mutants of T. reesei by high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Our aim was to obtain
genome-wide information which could be utilized for better understanding of the mechanisms underlying efficient
cellulase production, and would enable targeted genetic engineering for improved production of proteins in general.
Results: We carried out an aCGH analysis of four high-producing strains (QM9123, QM9414, NG14 and Rut-C30) using
the natural isolate QM6a as a reference. In QM9123 and QM9414 we detected a total of 44 previously undocumented
mutation sites including deletions, chromosomal translocation breakpoints and single nucleotide mutations. In NG14
and Rut-C30 we detected 126 mutations of which 17 were new mutations not documented previously. Among these
new mutations are the first chromosomal translocation breakpoints identified in NG14 and Rut-C30. We studied the
effects of two deletions identified in Rut-C30 (a deletion of 85 kb in the scaffold 15 and a deletion in a gene encoding a
transcription factor) on cellulase production by constructing knock-out strains in the QM6a background. Neither the 85
kb deletion nor the deletion of the transcription factor affected cellulase production.
Conclusions: aCGH analysis identified dozens of mutations in each strain analyzed. The resolution was at the level of
single nucleotide mutation. High-density aCGH is a powerful tool for genome-wide analysis of organisms with small
genomes e.g. fungi, especially in studies where a large set of interesting strains is analyzed.
Background
The filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei is an important protein production host in biotechnology. It secretes
naturally high amounts of cellulase and hemicellulase
enzymes capable of degrading plant cell wall carbohydrate polymers. The main industrial applications of
Trichoderma enzymes are in the pulp and paper, textile
and feed industries and in the biofuels sector as well as in
food processing. Many high-producing strains in use
today were generated by classical mutagenesis. However,
little data is available on the genomic alterations that have
occurred in these strains resulting in improved cellulase
production.

A special and important feature of T. reesei is that all
strains used in industrial production and research are
derived from a single natural isolate, QM6a, which was
originally isolated in the Salomon Islands during World
War II [1]. To enhance cellulase production, T. reesei
strains have been subjected to extensive random mutagenesis and selection regimes in many research institutes
and companies (for a review see [2]). The first cellulaseenhanced mutant QM9123 was isolated at Natick Laboratories, MA, USA by irradiating conidia of QM6a in a
linear particle accelerator; this mutant strain produced
twice as much cellulase as its parent on cellulose-containing media [3]. The irradiation mutagenesis was continued
with QM9123 and the strain QM9414 producing two to
four times more cellulase than QM6a was isolated. Further mutagenesis of QM9414 has then produced several

high-producing mutant series in a number of laboratories.
Strains developed at Rutgers University, NJ, USA form
a separate line of high-producing mutants. Rut-C30, the
best characterized and one of the most widely-used T.
reesei strains, is a member of this series. Rut-C30 was
generated by three mutagenesis steps in conditions aiming at the isolation of catabolite-derepressed mutants [4].
The first step was a UV mutagenesis of QM6a and isolation of M7 strain which was further mutagenized with Nnitrosoguanidine (NTG) leading to the NG14 strain [5].
This strain produced several times more cellulases than
the parental strain but still showed considerable catabolite repression. NG14 was further UV-mutagenized and
Rut-C30, a catabolite repression deficient mutant, was
isolated [4]. Different mutagenesis programs have created
several mutant lines in which each mutant has improved
ability to produce proteins as compared to its parental
strain. The mutant series form a unique pedigree of
strains in which a large number of gene alterations affecting protein synthesis and secretion ability are expected to
be found. Analysis of mutations in the high-producing T.
reesei strains would open up understanding of the mechanisms underlying the efficient cellulase production, and
would enable targeted genetic engineering for improved
production of proteins in general.
Rut-C30 is the best characterized T. reesei strain. The
strain is known to have a deletion of ~ 2.5 kb in the cre1
gene mediating glucose repression [6,7] and a frameshift
mutation in the glucosidase II alpha subunit gene [8].
Furthermore, a deletion of 85 kb in NG14 and Rut-C30 in
the scaffold 15 has been identified [7]. Recently, genome
sequencing of Rut-C30 and its parental strain NG14 was
reported [9]. Using massive parallel sequencing 223 single nucleotide mutations, 15 small deletions or insertions
and 18 larger deletions were identified in these strains.
Additionally, electrophoretic karyotyping and gene mapping have revealed differences in size of chromosomes in
Rut-C30 as compared to QM6a and recombination
events between chromosomes [10,11]. No mutations
have been reported in other strains but electrophoretic
karyotyping of several T. reesei strains showed that chromosomal rearrangements have occurred in many strains,
e.g. the smallest chromosome of QM9414 differed in size
from that of QM6a. Furthermore, mapping by hybridization with random clones revealed additional rearrangements between the strains [10].
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was originally developed for detecting and mapping copy number
variations (gains and losses) in cancer research [12].
Nowadays, array-format CGH (aCGH) enables much
higher resolution in analysis of copy number differences
[13]. Various aCGH platforms are available, from bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) to cDNA clones and

oligonucleotide-based formats [14-16]. Oligonucleotide
aCGH has been successfully explored, and several commercial platforms are available ranging up to 2.1 million
oligonucleotide probes (currently the highest density
microarray platform) on a single slide. However, the large
size of mammalian genomes makes it impossible to perform whole genome aCGH at a high resolution in a single
experiment. In organisms with smaller genomes, the oligonucleotide tiling arrays allow even a single nucleotide
resolution on a single chip.
In this work we studied the genomic alterations in high
cellulase-producing mutants of T. reesei. We present the
aCGH results of four strains (QM9123, QM9414, NG14
and Rut-C30) with improved protein production in comparison to the QM6a reference strain. The genealogy of
these strains is presented in Figure 1. Genomic DNA of
the strains was isolated, labelled with different fluorochromes and co-hybridized to high-resolution tiling
aCGH of 2.1 million oligonucleotide probes. We detected
a large number of genomic alterations in each strain,

Results
Array design and analysis

High-resolution tiling array based on the T. reesei QM6a
genome sequence [17] was designed by RocheNimbleGen
[18]. The design with 2,163,898 probes had essentially
complete coverage of all areas where unique probes could
be selected. The isothermal overlapping oligonucleotide
probes of 45-85 nucleotides (nt) had a mean tiling distance of ~ 15 nt measured from start-to-start. The mean
length of probes was 50 nt.
ArrayCGH data was analyzed in R using Bioconductor
packages (see Methods). Limma [19] was used for detecting probes with significantly changed intensity and DNAcopy [20] for segmentation to detect genome regions with
abnormal copy number. Combined limma testing (pscore cut-off >0.001) and segmentation resulted in 184,
283, 6319 and 5974 probes with significantly deviating
signals from QM6a in QM9123, QM9414, NG14 and RutC30, respectively. These probes were located in 19, 54,
297 and 156 sites in the genomes of QM9123, QM9414,
NG14 and Rut-C30, respectively. A vast majority of the
detected changes were losses. The combined results of
limma testing and segmentation were visually inspected
and mutations appearing as false positives were excluded.
We present in this study the results of four T. reesei
strains (Figure 1), but altogether we analyzed 14 strains.
However, the majority of these strains are of industrial
importance and therefore the results are not published.
The industrially relevant strains were derivatives of the
four strains discussed here. However, all strains in the
data set were included in the interpretation of the CGH
data. Having several strains of the same series validated
better the strain in which a mutation had originally
occurred. This also increased the number of mutations in
individual strains, since for some of the probes the
detected difference in signal intensity was not statistically
significant in a particular strain but showed significant
difference in the parent and descendant strain. After
manual verification of the analysis results, 20 mutation
sites in QM9123, 39 in QM9414, 61 in NG14 and 125 in
Rut-C30 were considered as true mutations (Figure 2).
Resolution of aCGH is at the level of a single nucleotide
mutation

The majority of significant change in signal was detected
in individual probes or in sets of a few overlapping
probes. Therefore, a set of fifty putative mutation sites
seen in one or a few probes were randomly chosen for
sequencing. This was done to determine whether these
sites truly contained a mutation, what types of mutations
were detected in the aCGH and what was the false posi-

tive rate. The majority of the sites selected for sequencing
had losses, but five gains of signal were also included in
the data set. Specific oligos designed approximately 300
bp upstream and downstream from the mutation sites
were used to amplify a fragment containing a mutation
site in the middle of the fragment. Fragments were amplified both from the mutant and from QM6a in order to
compare the amplified PCR products. In 37 cases a PCR
fragment of correct size was amplified from both strains
(34 sites with loss of signal and 3 sites with gain of signal).
The fragments both from the mutant and from QM6a
were sequenced to rule out mistakes in the published
QM6a genome [17]. The majority of the sequenced sites
(76%) had single nucleotide substitutions (Tables 1 and 2
and Additional files 1 and 2). Five of the sequenced sites
were false positives; two of these sites were from gain signal and three were from loss signal. The false positive rate
for all sequenced sites was thus 13.5%. Although two
gains were false positives, one such site had a single
nucleotide substitution. The false positive rate of
sequenced sites with loss signal was 8.8%. In some cases
no specific fragments were obtained either from the
mutant strain or from QM6a. These sites were specifically located in regions with low CG% and less dense
probe design. Sequencing results confirmed that the
changes in the probe signals reflected true mutations and
that the resolution of the high-density tiling array was at
the level of single nucleotide mutation.
Identification of translocations

When sequencing the putative point mutation sites,
amplification of some of the regions resulted in a fragment of correct size in the strain QM6a, but no specific
product was obtained from the mutant strain. These
mutation sites were considered as putative translocation
breakpoints. In order to study this hypothesis we used

ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) for genome walking
[21]. LM-PCR is a single-sided PCR method that initially
requires specification of only one primer binding site, the
second being defined by the ligation-based addition of a
unique DNA linker.
We identified four translocation breakpoints in
QM9123 and QM9414 (Table 1). The translocation
t(14;4)(118472;1190139) disrupts the gene 76018 in the
scaffold 4 and the promoter of the gene 108962 in the
scaffold 14. The breakpoints were seen in the aCGH data
as a loss of signal in one or two probes. The second translocation in QM9123 and QM9414 is an unbalanced
translocation. The location of the probes with loss of signal at the position 787736-787744 in the scaffold 9 was
used as a starting point for LM-PCR. The amplified fragment revealed a translocation (9;27)(787779;140159). The
translocation site in the scaffold 27 is just downstream of
a deletion of 1.7 kb (see below) and the breakpoint is in
the region of the same probes (27:140136-141896) that
detect the large deletion. In addition to the two genes disrupted in the scaffold 27 (see next section in results), the
translocation disrupts the gene 107460 encoding a
GTPase-activating protein in the scaffold 9.
Five translocation breakpoints were identified in RutC30 and NG14 (Table 2). The translocation
t(4;2)(1204862;546703) disrupts a STE-like transcription

factor gene 36543 in the scaffold 4, and there are no additional ORFs (open reading frame) in the vicinity of the
translocation site. The other breakpoints, t(22;48)
(139476;1667) and t(4;22)(748277;139515) belong to the
same translocation event and identify both translocation
breakpoints in the scaffold 22. The breakpoint in the scaffold 22 has resulted in t(22;48) and t(4;22) and a deletion
of 38 bp in the scaffold 22 (22:139477-139514). These
breakpoints are in a region with no ORFs nearby.
Mutations in strains QM9123 and QM9414

Twenty mutations were detected in the strain QM9123
(Tables 1 and 3). Four of these were QM9123 specific
mutations not found in QM9414 and were thus considered to be independent of the mutagenesis and selection
steps. However, we concluded these mutations to be true
and included them in the list, since they were also
detected in other strains derived directly from QM9123
(data not shown). In the strain QM9414, 23 novel mutations were detected in addition to the 16 mutations originating from QM9123 (Tables 1 and 3). Two large
deletions were detected both in QM9123 and QM9414.
The 1.7 kb deletion which results from the unbalanced
translocation in the scaffold 27 (see above) truncates two
genes. The first gene (85645) encodes a putative gammaglutamyltranspeptidase also having homology to a linko-

mycin-consensing protein. The second truncated gene
(68956) is a FAD-dependent oxidoreductase/D-amino
acid oxidase. Another large deletion in QM9123 and
QM9414 was found in the scaffold 1, in a region with low
GC% and containing a few predicted ORFs with short
exons and long introns (Figure 3). The probe density was
lower in some parts of this region due to repeat DNA.
The deletion is smaller in QM9123 (probes 1:24705072470997, ~0.5 kb) than in QM9414 (probes 1:24691002470997, ~1.9 kb). Interestingly, a large deletion of ~9.4

kb in this same region was detected in NG14 (probes
1:2461556-2470997) (Figure 3). However, no deletion of
this particular region was found in Rut-C30. Although
the deletions are of different size and have different starting points in different strains, they appear to end at the
same point (probe 1:2470997). We attempted to amplify
fragments of this region to identify the exact sites of the
deletions but we were unable to obtain specific
fragments.

The rest of the mutations in QM9123 and QM9414

few adjacent probes. Excluding sites identified as translocation breakpoints (see above), there were 14 such mutation sites in QM9123 and 23 more in QM9414 (Tables 1
and 3). Locations of mutations were evaluated according
to the gene annotations using the filtered models in T.

start codon was considered as a promoter and a 250 bp
region downstream from a stop codon as a terminator. Of
the mutation sites shared by both strains, two were

five in the promoter and one in the terminator of a gene
(Table 3). Two QM9123-specific mutations were detected

and locates in the promoter of the gene 54781 coding a

(20:399356-399526) covers a ca. 170 bp region of the gene
35386 encoding an actin-interacting protein. The majority of the QM9414-specific mutations hit a gene element;
a promoter (8), a coding region (11) or a terminator (1)
(Table 3).
Mutations in strains NG14 and RutC30

We identified a total of 61 mutations in NG14 and 125 in
RutC30, of which 65 mutations were Rut-C30 specific
(Table 2 and Additional files 1 and 2). Four additional
mutations were discovered as NG14-specific (not shown
except for a deletion in the scaffold 1). Since NG14-specific mutations were discovered, it is possible that some
other mutations detected in NG14 and further on in RutC30 have not occurred in the mutagenesis to obtain
NG14 but originate from genetic drift. Of the identified
mutations in NG14 and Rut-C30, 109 were discovered
earlier [9]. Mutations identified both by our aCGH analysis and sequencing study are listed in Additional files 1
and 2 and the novel mutations detected in this study in
Table 2. The large 85 kb deletion in the scaffold 15
(15:1555-86603) in NG14 and Rut-C30 [7] was observed
in the aCGH data in probes 15:3431-86866. The number
of significant probes in Rut-C30 and NG14 is high compared to QM9123 and QM9414 due to this 85 kb deletion, since the vast majority of probes hit this deletion.
The deletion in the cre1 gene in Rut-C30 [6] was also
detected (probes 2:786836-789542). However, the deletion of a single nucleotide in the glucosidase II alpha subunit gene (121351) [8] was not detected. To verify that
our Rut-C30 strain did contain the mutation we
sequenced the gene and the reported mutation was
detected.
We identified 17 mutations not reported earlier (Table
2). NG14 had a large deletion of 9.4 kb in the scaffold 1
(see above). Five mutation sites in NG14 and Rut-C30
were identified as translocation breakpoints (see above).
Seven additional point mutations were identified both in

ied whether this deletion is beneficial for cellulase production. The deletion construct was designed according
to the aCGH data in which the deletion was detected as
having a size of 83 kb instead of 85 kb. The deletion construct to knock out the respective region was constructed
by yeast recombinational cloning [22] and transformed in
QM6a Δmus53 strain which is the wild-type strain with a
deletion of the gene 58509 encoding DNA ligase IV
involved in non-homologous end joining of doublestrand DNA breaks [23]. This gene has been deleted to
increase the frequency of homologous recombination
and replacement at the locus to be deleted by the knockout cassette. The QM6a Δmus53 with the 83 kb deletion
in the scaffold 15 (Del scaff15) and the parental strain
were cultivated in Trichoderma minimal medium
(TrMM) [24] supplemented with lactose and spent grain
extract (see materials and methods). In this growth
medium cellulase genes are induced and cellulases produced [25,26] Growth was monitored by determining
biomass dry weight and measuring pH. Growth of Del
scaff15 did not differ significantly from the growth of the
parental strain (Figure 4). Cellulase activities of two major
cellulases, cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) and endoglucanase
I (EGI), were measured as hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-lactoside (MUL) substrate [27] and activities
were calculated as nkat/g of dry weight (Figure 4). In the
QM6a background the cellulase activities and extracellular protein concentration in general are rather low causing variance between biological replicates. However, if
the deletion has any beneficial effect on cellulase production, it is seen as an increase of MUL-activity compared
to the QM6a strain. From day 1 to 3 the Del scaff15
appeared to produce slightly more cellulases than the
parental strain but from day 4 onwards the activity no
longer increased in the deletion strain and the parental
strain produced more cellulases on days 4 and 6 (Figure

NG14 and Rut-C30. Three of these mutations were in the
coding regions of three different genes (a putative clathrin complex protein and two genes of unknown function)
and three in the promoter regions of other genes. RutC30 had four additional mutations not reported earlier. A
deletion was found in the scaffold 19 (probes 19: 577146577570). The region was sequenced and a deletion of 413
bp (19:577175-577587) was verified. This deletion truncates the gene 72076 encoding a fungal specific transcription factor. The deletion occurs in the second exon and
shifts the remaining sequence after deletion out of frame.
In the scaffold 2 (probes 2:1614064-1614353) there is a
~280 bp region with loss of signal appearing to be a deletion in the promoter region of the gene 120231 encoding
a putative G protein with WD40 repeats. A third RutC30-specific mutation affecting a gene element is in the
gene 121453 encoding a metallopeptidase. In [9] this ORF
has a mutation in 7:1019614 but our data had a change of
signal in the probes 7:1019641-1019681, placing the
mutation at a different position.
We evaluated the fidelity (precision) and completeness
(recall) of aCGH results by comparing our Rut-C30 data
with sequenced data [9]. Mutations in adjacent nucleotides in [9] were combined into one because aCGH
reports mutations in adjacent positions as a single mutation. Precision as a measure of how well aCGH data
matched the sequencing data was defined as the number
of mutations that were present in both aCGH and
sequenced data divided by the total number of mutations
found by the sequencing approach. The precision was
0.866, meaning that the sequencing approach missed
about 13% of the mutations discovered by the aCGH
approach. Recall as a measure how many sequenced
mutations were missed in the aCGH analysis was defined
as the number of mutations that were found by both
approaches divided by the total number of mutations in
aCGH. The recall was 0.480. We also studied whether the
position of a mutation in the probes affects the detection
of a mutation in aCGH. Position-dependency was studied
by plotting positions of mutations in probes against probe
signals. Of the mutations detected by aCGH, the largest
change of signals was in probes with a mutation in the
middle of the probe (Additional file 3). However, rather
large number of reported mutations was still missed
although there were probes containing the mutation in
their middle region.

4). However, the differences were within the range of
standard deviation. Cultivations were also carried out in
TrMM 2% Solca floc cellulose 0.05% peptone pH 4.8 for 7
days at 28°C. Similar to the results in TrMM lactose spent
grain extract medium, there was no significant difference
in growth or in cellulase production between Del scaff15
and the parent strain (data not shown).
Deletion of the gene 72076 does not affect cellulase
production in QM6a

Rut-C30 has a deletion in the gene 72076 encoding a fungal transcription factor. Although the N-terminal Cys
motif is encoded by the first exon and remains intact in
the mutated gene, the deletion and the resulting frameshift most probably leads to a non-functional protein. To
study whether deletion of 72076 affected cellulase production, we deleted this gene from the QM6a Δmus53
strain. Construction of the deletion strain was carried out
using the same techniques as in constructing the strain
Del scaff15 (see above). The deletion strain (Del 72076)
and the parental strain were cultivated and dry weight,
pH and cellulase production were analyzed as above.
Growth of Del 72076 was similar to that of the parental
strain, and cellulase production was also similar (Figure
4).

Discussion
Overview of the aCGH results

Using a custom made high-resolution tiling aCGH we
detected dozens of mutations in all T. reesei high-cellulase-producing strains that we analyzed. The aCGH
results were validated by sequencing a set of mutation
sites and the resolution of our array format was shown to
be at the level of a single nucleotide mutation. Altogether,
mutations from large deletions to a single nucleotide
were detected in all strains analysed. We evaluated how
precise and complete the aCGH analysis was by comparing the Rut-C30 data to the sequenced data [9]. Array
CGH detected about half of the mutations reported in
[9]. On the other hand, we found a number of mutations
that were not detected by sequencing [9]. The above suggests that both aCGH and sequencing have their limitations. ArrayCGH may be technically inferior to deep
massive parallel sequencing but its lower cost currently
justifies its use in species such as T. reesei, where there is
interest to study many strains of a large phylogeny.
Various types of mutations were identified in QM9123 and
QM9414

We identified over forty mutations of various types in
QM9123 and/or QM9414. Considering the number of
mutations missed in Rut-C30, the count of mutations in
these strains is probably higher than was detected in this
study. Nevertheless these mutations are the first to be

Page 10 of 16

reported in QM9123 and QM9414. Considering that
QM9414 is widely used strain in many laboratories and
further mutagenesis of the strain has generated several
series of mutants, it is worthwhile to identify mutations
in this strain. Sequencing of mutation sites showed that
even though several single nucleotide changes were
found in QM9123 and QM9414, other types of mutations
(e.g. deletion of few nucleotides) were more frequent than
in NG14 and Rut-C30. This finding is consistent with the
different mutagenesis treatments used to generate the
strains [3,4]. Three genes (81136, 124295 and 108540)
encoding putative cell wall or plasma membrane proteins
contain a mutation in their coding region or in another
gene element. Altered cell wall/membrane structure may
have been beneficial for spore survival and germination
after radiation, or mutations may have been beneficial in
the screening procedure itself, being relevant to the
improved cellulase production. Two genes involved in
cytoskeleton function have a mutation in their coding
region; the gene 2439 encodes ARP2/3 complex protein,
which is the central regulator of actin cytoskeleton [28]
and the gene 35386 encodes actin interacting protein 3
(Aip3/Bud6) which is a regulator of cell and cytoskeleton
polarity [29]. These mutations may affect trafficking and
secretory pathways in cells. Altogether genes affecting
several different functions have been mutated in the QMstrains, and further studies are needed to investigate
whether these mutations have effects on protein
production.
Chromosomal translocations were identified in all strains

We identified translocation breakpoints in all strains analyzed. A drawback of aCGH is that, in principle, the
method detects only unbalanced chromosomal changes.
Balanced chromosomal translocations are seen as a
change of signal in a few probes that only identify the site
as a mutation site. Although aCGH does not directly
identify balanced chromosomal changes, we were able to
identify several translocation breakpoints by further analysis of sites with loss of signal using ligation-mediated
PCR for genome walking. The presence of breakpoints is
consistent with the electrophoretic karyotyping and mapping of genes [10,11], showing that T. reesei strains have
chromosomal rearrangements. Since QM9123 and
QM9414 have been generated by ionizing radiation
known to directly induce double strand breakages (DSB),
it is not surprising to find translocations in these strains.
It is probable that more rearrangements would be found
if all the mutation sites detected were analyzed in detail.
NG14 and Rut-C30 have undergone other mutagenesis
treatments not considered to cause DSB directly, and yet
these strains also have translocations. However, all mutagenesis treatments may trigger DNA repair processes and
enhance chromosomal recombination, which may lead to

Vitikainen et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:441
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/441

rearrangements [30]. Chromosomal rearrangements also
occur independently of the mutagenesis agent, and these
rearrangements play an important role in the genome
evolution. Possibly the lack of a sexual cycle and no need
for meiotic pairing of chromosomes may increase the tolerance of genome rearrangements. Palindromic AT-rich
regions (PATRRs) have been found to mediate genomic
instability, thereby contributing to translocations, deletions and amplifications [31]. One breakpoint identified
in this study, t(22;48)(139476;1667) in NG14 and RutC30, had occurred in the AT-rich region in one scaffold
(scaff 48) and a palindromic sequence was a few base
pairs upstream from the breakpoint in another scaffold
(scaff 22).
Scaffold 1 contains a region with deletions in several strains

A specific region in the scaffold 1 appears to be prone to
mutations. Deletions of various sizes have occurred in the
region in several strains. These deletions are not in accordance with the pedigree in all strains although other
mutations in these strains verify that the pedigree is correct. The deletions appear to be due to genetic drift independent from mutagenesis in a region prone to
chromosomal rearrangements. In all strains containing a
deletion the end point of the deletion is the same probe
1:2470997. This is the last specific probe before a 100 bp
region of repeat DNA (CCCTAA)n followed by a short
gap in the genome sequence. Since repeat sequences act
as sites for recombination [30], deletions may have
occurred in this repeat region although it is not detected
correctly in aCGH. The starting point of deletions varies
in the different strains. There is no repeat DNA within a
distance of 200 bp from the start point of the deletion in
NG14 or QM9123, but in QM9414 the starting point of
the deletion is in the region with repeat DNA (TAAAA)n.
New mutations were identified in NG14 and Rut-C30

Using aCGH we identified 126 mutation sites in Rut-C30
and NG14; 109 mutations were the same as reported in
[9] and 17 were new ones. The new mutations include 5
translocation breakpoints, three deletions and nine other
mutations. We consider these mutations to be true mutations missed in the sequencing since we identified translocations precisely and sequenced three other mutation
sites and they all contained a mutation. The new mutations hit some putatively interesting genes: the gene
53811 encoding clathrin adaptor complex protein and the
genes 72076, 36543 and 120231 encoding proteins with
domains implicated in transcription regulation and signal
transduction. As expected, many single nucleotide mutations were missed in aCGH. However, there are also differences in identifying large deletions. Interestingly, the
deletion of 9.4 kb in NG14 in the scaffold 1 was missing in
the Illumina sequencing data and instead a deletion of 1

Page 11 of 16

kb was identified about 7 kb downstream in the same
scaffold in NG14 [9]. Our Rut-C30 strain also contained a
deletion not found in the sequencing data in the scaffold
19 and another additional deletion in the scaffold 2. Ten
deletions found in the sequencing but missing in aCGH
data are located in the regions lacking probes in aCGH
due to repeat DNA, which explains why the deletions
were missed. However, deletions found in the sequencing
in small scaffolds of Rut-C30 are located in regions with
normal probe spacing in aCGH. Possibly probe design in
these scaffolds is not unique after all and therefore deletions are missed. Known deletions in cre1 and in the scaffold 15 in Rut-C30 [6,7] were identified in the aCGH data.
The deletion in the scaffold 15 was seen as a size of 83 kb
instead of 85 kb because of an AT-rich region in the start
of the deletion. Since our array design included only the
unique probes there were virtually no probes for the first
3400 bp in the scaffold 15. Therefore the deletion
reported to start at 15:1555 was seen in aCGH from
15:3431 onwards.
Factors affecting aCGH signal

The known point mutation in the glucosidase II alpha
subunit gene in Rut-C30 [8] was not detected in aCGH.
This observation made us conclude that although aCGH
detects single nucleotide mutations the method is unable
to identify all of them. This conclusion was then verified
by the sequencing data [9]. Microarray hybridization with
known sequence mismatches has been used to determine
guidelines for array design mostly on short oligonucleotides but also with longer 50-60 mer probes. Altogether,
mismatches are more difficult to detect with long probes
than with short ones. Strong position-dependent effects
have been found; mismatches near the middle of probes
reduce the signal more than those near the end of probes
[32,33]. Mismatches near the 5' end have a greater effect
on hybridization than mismatches the same distance
from the 3' end [33]. Mismatches in the 3' end are least
effective because probes are attached to the surface by
their 3' ends and the close vicinity of microarray surface
influences the stringency in hybridization [34]. In principle, in our custom design with a mean length of 50 mer
probes and with 15 bp tiling, each nucleotide is in at least
three overlapping probes. This tiling should often overcome the problems of position-dependency since a mismatch hits in different positions in different probes.
Position-dependency may explain why a mutation was
often detected only in one probe (significant change of
signal) although the same mutation was also in adjacent
probes (no change in signal or the change was below the
cut-off level). However, in practice the probe distribution
is uneven in many parts of the genome and therefore not
all nucleotides are present in several probes in different
positions. Our analysis of position-dependency yielded

Vitikainen et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:441
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/441

similar results than [32,33], albeit a number of mutations
were missed even though there were probes with a mutation in their middle region in aCGH. Non-specific binding to detect mismatches also depends on the
substitutions which they incorporate [33,35,36]. However, the results concerning which nucleotide changes
cause the greatest effects vary. Despite the difficulties in
identifying point mutations with aCGH, we were still able
to detect a rather large number of single nucleotide mutations.
The deletion of 85 kb in scaffold 15 and the deletion in
gene 72076 have negligible effects on protein production

Since the deletion in the scaffold 15 is the most prominent mutation identified in Rut-C30 we wanted to study
its effect more thoroughly, namely whether the deletion
has an effect on hydrolytic enzyme production. To do
that we constructed a knock-out strain corresponding to
the deletion in the QM6a background. The wild-type
strain was chosen to avoid interference with other mutations. The problem with QM6a is that its natural cellulase
production level is low compared to that of the high-producing mutants, causing assaying difficulties. According
to our results, this 85 kb deletion had no effect on cellulase production in the conditions studied here.
Genomes can be broadly divided into regions where
gene content and order is mostly conserved between
closely related species (syntenic blocks, SBs) and regions
where it is not conserved (non-syntenic blocks, NSBs). In
T. reesei and Aspergillus fumigatus NSBs show enrichment of particular protein families [37,38]. These protein
families are typically enriched in Pezizomycotina [39] and
are often found in subtelomeres in Magnaporthe oryzae
[40]. In A. fumigatus NSBs tend to be found in or close to
subtelomeres and their genes are particularly short [38].
In A. oryzae NSBs probably contain many horizontally
transferred genes (HGT) [41] of variable, but mostly fungal, origin [42]. Genes in NSBs are induced in starvationlike conditions [43,44] and at least in A. oryzae they have
significantly lower expression levels than SB genes even
when induced [41,43]. NSBs are thus the regions where
the majority of mutations, which result in non-lethal phenotypes, occur. The phenotypic effects of NSBs might be
restricted by low gene expression levels, which would
allow liberal evolutionary experimentation. Of the 29
genes (Additional file 4) found in the 85 kb deletion in the
scaffold 15 (Del scaff15), 14 are from protein families typical of T. reesei NSBs [37]. Of these, 11 belong to the most
enriched protein families in Pezizomycotina [39]. Eleven
of the Del scaff15 genes belong to families found in M.
oryzae subtelomeres, 18 have additional homologues in T.
reesei [39] and 20 are shorter than the T. reesei average of

Page 12 of 16

1,793 bp. In addition, the gene 109199 is probably a result
of horizontal gene transfer from Agaricomycotina [39] as
its closest homologues are found in these taxons. With
the nearby palindromic AT-rich region (PATRR) the Del
scaff15 is thus an example of typical fungal evolution that
could easily occur without mutagenesis treatment [7]. As
such, taking the above data into account as well as the fact
that we found no considerable phenotypic effects for it,
the Del scaff15 probably has negligible phenotypic effects
in protein production conditions.
Our Rut-C30 has a deletion in the gene 72076 encoding
a fungal transcription factor. A deletion in a transcription
factor gene in a high-cellulase-producing strain already
containing a known beneficial deletion in a transcription
factor (cre1) encouraged us to knock out the 72076 gene
and study its effect on cellulase production. However, the
Del72076 did not affect cellulase production at least in
the conditions studied here. The fact that the 72076 deletion was not identified by [9] indicates that the deletion
has occurred specifically in the Rut-C30 isolate used in
our laboratory and that the mutation was generated independently of the mutagenesis. Therefore it is not surprising that the Del72076 does not have a beneficial effect on
cellulase production. It is also possible that the deletion
was missed by [9] and that the deletion occurred in the
mutagenesis after all. Moreover, we cannot exclude the
possibility that a mutation could have an effect in synergy
with some other mutation(s) that were lacking in the
QM6a background. Therefore introducing Del scaff15
and Del 72076 to a mutant strain instead of the wild-type
strain might evoke a different effect than what is seen in
the QM6a background.

Conclusions
Using array comparative genomic hybridization we
detected dozens of mutations in four cellulase high-producing T. reesei strains. High-resolution tiling array format allowed detection even at the level of single
nucleotide mutation. In strains QM9123 and QM9414 we
report the first mutations identified. In NG14 and RutC30 we detected new mutations in addition to the mutations that have been reported earlier. The existing
sequencing data of Rut-C30 enabled us to evaluate the
aCGH method and to compare the results more thoroughly. We also made knock-out constructs to study
whether two deletions identified in Rut-C30 are connected to the improved cellulase production and discuss
why the deletions appear to be unrelated to the high-producing ability of cellulases. Overall, this study provides
insight into the process of developing not just fungal
strains, but microbial strains in general for improved
industrial production.

Methods
Strains, media, culture conditions and gene nomenclature

Trichoderma reesei QM6a (ATCC13631, VTT-D071262T), QM9123 (ATCC 24449, VTT-D-74068),
QM9414 (ATCC 26921, VTT-D-74075), NG14 (ATCC
56767, VTT-D-82189) and Rut-C30 (ATCC 56765, VTTD-86271,) were obtained from VTT Culture Collection.
The host strain for the knock-out constructs was QM6a
Δmus53. In this strain the gene 58509 has been deleted
(unpublished data). Gene id is according to the protein id
in T. reesei database v2.0 [17]. For DNA isolation the
strains were cultivated in shake flasks in Trichoderma
minimal medium (TrMM) [24] supplemented with 2%
glucose, 0.2% peptone pH 4.8 for 2 days at 28°C. Mycelia
were collected by filtering, washed with deionised water
and lyophilized. To study cellulase production, the deletion strains and the QM6a Δmus53 strain were cultivated
in shake flasks in TrMM supplemented with 4% lactose,
2% spent grain extract 0.05% peptone pH 4.8 for 7 days at
28°C. Culture samples were filtered, mycelia were used to
determine the dry weight and culture media was used for
enzyme assays and measuring pH. For cellulase production studies strains were also cultivated in TrMM 2%
Solca floc 0.05% peptone pH 4.8 for 7 days at 28°C. Culture samples were withdrawn, samples were filtered and
culture media was used for assays and measuring pH.
Isolation of chromosomal DNA

DNA for aCGH was isolated from three replicate cultivations of each strain. DNA was isolated according to [45]
with modifications. Lyophilized mycelia (100 mg) were
first ground in liquid nitrogen. The mycelium powder
was suspended in a buffer containing 200 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8.5, 250 mM NaCl, 25 mM EDTA pH 8.0 and 0.5%
SDS. RNAse was added to a final concentration of 2.6
mg/ml and samples were incubated at 37°C for at least 30
min. Samples were extracted with phenol-chloroformisoamyl alcohol (24:1) three times followed by extraction
with chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1) three times. Isopropanol was added to a volume of 0.54 to precipitate
DNA. DNA pellets were washed once with 70% ethanol,
air dried 5 min and suspended in deionised water. Quality
and purity of the DNA were analyzed according to the
Roche NimbleGen guidelines [18]. DNA concentration
was measured with NanoDrop ND-1000 (NanoDrop
Technologies Inc. Wilmington, DE, USA). DNA for
aCGH had to fulfil the criteria of 260/280 ratio ≥ 1.8 and
260/20 ratio ≥1.9. Integrity of DNA and the absence of
RNA contamination were analyzed in 1% agarose gel in
which chromosomal DNA migrated as a single band of
size >50 kb.
Array design and aCGH

Design and manufacturing of custom aCGH of 2,163,898
probes (HD2 format) was carried out by Roche Nimble-

Page 13 of 16

Gen (WI, USA) [18]. The aCGH design was based on the
T. reesei QM6a genome sequence [17,37]. The nomenclature of probes is as follows: scaffold number followed by
5' start position of the probe according to the plus strand
(first probe in the design 1:12 and the last probe 87:1968).
DNA labelling, hybridization and signal quantification
were carried out by Roche NimbleGen. Hybridization
was carried out as a two-colour reference design (test
sample labelled with Cy3 and reference with Cy5) with
three repeats for each strain and using a randomly chosen, non-replacement, QM6a sample as a reference.
QM6a was treated identically to other strains i.e. hybridised against QM6a three times. Spatial effects were
detected in the data and Roche NimbleGen carried out a
2D lowess spatial normalisation [46]. Further data analysis was carried out by the authors. Data from Roche NimbleGen was analysed with R [47] using Bioconductor [48].
Data was parsed to R with the package Ringo [49] and
snapCGH [50]. As the use of variance stabilizing normalisation (VSN) [51] alone was unable to completely remove
colour biases from the data (data not shown), the data
was first normalised within arrays with lowess using the
package Limma (Linear models for microarrays) [19].
VSN was then applied to stabilize low intensity probes.
Probes with significantly different signals between the
strains were detected with Limma [19]. In brief, an
anova-like model was fitted for each probe using the
QM6a self-hybridization as intercept and strain differences were detected by fitting contrasts between the
strains. A cut-off of p > 0.001 was used. In addition, data
averaged over the three repeats of each strain and the
QM6a self hybridization subtracted, was segmented with
DNAcopy [20] in order to identify groups of probes of
interest along the scaffolds. Data analysis of the strains
discussed in this article was carried out as a part of larger
data set (data not shown). The locations of mutations
were evaluated according to the gene annotations using
the filtered models in T. reesei database v2.0 [17]. A 1 kb
region upstream from a start codon was considered as a
promoter and a 250 bp region downstream from a stop
codon as a terminator. Microarray data presented in this
study are available in the GEO database [52] under accession number GSE19606.
Verification of the mutations

Specific primers (Tm 60°C ± 2°C) were designed using
Primer3 v4.0 software [53] to anneal approximately 300
bp upstream and downstream from the mutation site.
Fragments of approximately 600 bp were amplified in
PCR reactions. DNA templates were the same preparations as used in aCGH. Each fragment was amplified both
from the mutant strain and from strain QM6a. Fragments
were analyzed in 1% agarose gel, isolated with Qiaquick
Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen N.V. Venlo, The Netherlands)
and sequenced in both the forward and reverse direction

Vitikainen et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:441

using the same specific oligos as in the PCR amplification. Sequencing was performed using Big Dye®Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (AB Applied Biosystems,
Life Technologies Corporation, CA, USA) and analyzed
with 3100 Genetic Analyer (AB Applied Biosystems, Life
Technologies Corporation, CA, USA).
Ligation-mediated PCR amplification is based on [21].
Chromosomal DNA was digested with EcoRV, DraI or
PvuII and the digestion was purified with Qiaquick PCR
Purification Kit (Qiagen N.V. Venlo, The Netherlands).
Purified DNA was ligated for 3 hours at RT with PCR
linker mix in the reaction containing 10 μM of PCRlinkers I and II with T4 ligase (NEB) (PCRlinker I 5'
GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTGAATTC 3' and PCRlinker II 5' GAATTCAGATCT 3'). The ligation reaction
was purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen
N.V. Venlo, The Netherlands) and used as template in the
first PCR reaction performed with 50 pmol of a specific
oligo and 5 pmol of PCRlinker I. The PCR product was
then used as a template in the second PCR reaction performed with 25 pmol specific nested oligo and 2.5 pmol
PCRlinkerI. Product from the second PCR reaction was
analyzed in 1% agarose gel and clear bands were isolated
with Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen N.V. Venlo, The
Netherlands) and sequenced with the specific oligos used
in the first PCR reaction.

mediated transformation essentially as described by [24],
and transformants were selected for hygromycin resistance
on plates containing 125 μg ml-1 of hygromycin B (Calbiochem, EMB Biosciences Inc., La Jolla, CA). The transformants were streaked on the selective medium for two
successive rounds and tested by PCR. PCR positives were
further verified by Southern blotting in order to show that
the transformants contained only one copy the hygromycin
gene and that this copy had integrated to the correct site in
the genome.
Analysis of proteins in the culture media

Total protein and activity assays were performed from the
culture supernatants after removing the mycelia by centrifugation. Soluble protein from the cultivations was
assayed by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) using bovine serum albumin
(Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Steinheim, Germany) as
the standard. For analysis of cellulase production, the
combined action of the two main cellulase components,
cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) and endoglucanase I (EGI),
was assayed based on hydrolysis of the low-molecularweight substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-lactoside
(MUL) (Sigma-Aldrich) and by detection of the fluorescent hydrolysis product methylumbelliferone [27].

Construction of T. reesei deletion strains

The deletion cassette to delete 83 kb of the scaffold 15
was constructed in the pRS426 plasmid [54] and contained the hygromycin resistance cassette flanked by 1 kb
fragments from both sides of the intended deletion. The
flanking region fragments were amplified by PCR with
the oligos: (5' flanking region forward oligo 5' GTA
ACGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGACTAGTC
GGCCCAACGCATATTATAG 3' and reverse oligo 5'
ATCCACTTAACGTTACTGAAATCTCCAACCTTTT
TCCTTCCCCCTTCAG 3'), and (3' flanking region forward oligo 5' CTCCTTCAATATCATCTTCTGTCTCCGACACGGCGAATCTACCACAGTC 3' and reverse
oligo 5' GCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGAAACAGCACTAGTAACCAATTCCCACGCATACT 3-). The
deletion cassette was constructed by yeast recombinational cloning [22]. The deletion cassette to knock out the
gene encoding 72076 was constructed as above. The oligos
for flanking region fragments were: (5' flaking fragment
forward oligo 5' GTAACGCCAGGGTTTTC CCAGTCACGACGGACGTCCACAGTGTATCACACAACGAC 3' and
reverse oligo 5' ATCCACTTAACGTTACTGAAATCTCCAACGAGGAGAAGTGCTCTCAACC 3'), and (3' flanking fragment forward oligo 5' CTCC TTCAATATC
