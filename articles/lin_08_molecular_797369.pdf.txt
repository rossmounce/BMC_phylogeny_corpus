Abstract
Background: CBF/DREB duplicate genes are widely distributed in higher plants and encode
transcriptional factors, or CBFs, which bind a DNA regulatory element and impart responsiveness
to low temperatures and dehydration.
Results: We explored patterns of genetic variations of CBF1, -2, and -3 from 34 accessions of
Arabidopsis thaliana. Molecular population genetic analyses of these genes indicated that CBF2 has
much reduced nucleotide diversity in the transcriptional unit and promoter, suggesting that CBF2
has been subjected to a recent adaptive sweep, which agrees with reports of a regulatory protein
of CBF2. Investigating the ratios of Ka/Ks between all paired CBF paralogus genes, high conservation
of the AP2 domain was observed, and the major divergence of proteins was the result of relaxation
in two regions within the transcriptional activation domain which was under positive selection after
CBF duplication. With respect to the level of CBF gene expression, several mutated nucleotides in
the promoters of CBF3 and -1 of specific ecotypes might be responsible for its consistently low
expression.
Conclusion: We concluded from our data that important evolutionary changes in CBF1, -2, and 3 may have primarily occurred at the level of gene regulation as well as in protein function.

Background
Genome duplication has been proposed as an advantageous path to evolutionary innovation and functional
divergence [1,2]. Ohno's theory hypothesizes that duplicates are mostly silenced by degenerative mutations following duplication due to a redundancy in function.
Although probabilities of duplicates acquiring novel and

beneficial functions is lower than duplicates being
silenced [3], the classical model of the fates of duplicate
genes proposed by Ohno is coming under increasing scrutiny [4-6]. Preservation of duplicate genes is believed to be
a common fate, particularly for genes that contain multiple regulatory regions, and thereby multiple copies of
genes are maintained in the genome [7-10].

Duplicated proteins evolve for some time under relaxed
functional constraints, after which functional divergence
occurs when formerly neutral substitutions convey a selective advantage in a novel environment or genetic background [11]. Gene duplication is often followed by an
elevated mutation rate [11,12]. Rapid duplicate gene evolution is caused by positive Darwinian selection or relaxation of the functional constraints in the redundant gene.
Continuation of gene duplication leads to the formation
of gene groups with high similarities in nucleotide and
amino acid sequences. The majority of genes in higher
organisms are members of multigene families or subfamilies [13]. Three potential evolutionary fates of duplicated genes have been suggested [1,14]: (A) Duplicated
genes may be inactivated by the degenerative mutations
and become nonfunctional (i.e., defunctionalization).
(B) A duplicated gene may diverge to acquire a new function (i.e., neofunctionalization). (C) Degenerative mutations occur in each copy after duplication. Both genes may
be altered in such a way that the combined activity of the
two genes together fulfills the task of the ancestral gene in
a complementary fashion (i.e., subfunctionalization)
[2,15].
CBF gene family, belongs to AP2/ERF (ethylene-responsive element-binding protein) superfamily, is considered
as a result of gene duplication [16]. Functional redundancy and differentiation have been reported, however,
evolutional aspect of this small gene family has not been
investigated. The AP2/ERF superfamily is a large gene family of transcription factors and is defined by the AP2/ERF
domain, which consists of 60~70 amino acids involved in
DNA binding. CBF1/DREB1B, CBF3/DREB1A, and CBF2/
DREB1C are located in a tandem array within a region of
8.7 kb on chromosome 4 [[17], see Figure 1A] in Arabidopsis thaliana and were categorized into group IIIc in the ERF
family [18]. The functions of CBF1, -2, and -3, which are
induced by cold, have been shown to play crucial roles in
the process of cold acclimation in Arabidopsis including
low temperature-, and/or drought-stress-responsive gene
expression [17,19]. CBF binds a DNA regulatory element,
the C-repeat (CRT) dehydration-responsive element
(DRE), which has a conserved core sequence of CCGAC,
which imparts responsiveness to low temperatures and
dehydration [20]. Comparisons of the transcriptomes
indicated that 12% of the cold-responsive genes are confirmed members of the CBF regulon [21]. CBF4, which is
located in chromosome 5, is involved in the dehydration
response rather than to cold, and is less closely related to
CBF1, -2, and -3 in phylogeny [22]. The amino acid
sequences of the CBF1, -2, and -3 proteins are highly similar, with approximately 88% identities and 91% similarities [17]. But do they have redundant functions? By
comparing the effects of the overexpression of each CBF
gene in Arabidopsis, it was determined that, in fact, they

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/111

induce expression of similar gene sets [16]. However,
other molecular or physiological studies have indicated
functional divergence among CBF genes [23-26].
In this report, we attempted to characterize the molecular
population genetics and gene expression of these three
CBF genes from 34 ecotypes, and to assess the roles of
selective forces that have driven the divergence of these
three duplicate genes. Usually molecular evolutionary
approaches are used to study selection forces on gene
sequences; here we have the opportunity to check whether
the results from those methods are supported by many
studies of the expression and function of CBF genes. Our
results, coupled with those from other published studies,
indicate that functional divergence in CBF1, -2, and -3
resulted from promoter polymorphisms as well as coding
sequence variations.

Results
Sequence polymorphisms of CBF1, -2, and -3 in
Arabidopsis thaliana
We obtained CBF genomic sequences from 34 geographically distant ecotypes covering Europe, North America,
Russia, North Africa, Japan, and India (see additional file
1). Substantial differences of polymorphic patterns were
observed among the three CBFs. In the promoter region
analyzed, CBF1 possessed the highest nucleotide diversity, π [48], of 0.02749, which was 25-fold higher than
that of CBF2 and 3.5-fold higher than that of CBF3. A similar trend was observed when another nucleotide diversity
estimate, θW [49], was examined (Table 1). The CBF1 promoter region also had the most abundant indels (26
regions of indels, 0.096 per site) compared to CBF2 (eight
regions of indels, 0.077 per site) and CBF3's promoter
regions (12 regions of indels, 0.013 per site). The distributions of indels are demonstrated in the additional file (see
additional files 2, 3 and 4). Most polymorphic sites in
CBF1's promoter were phylogenetically informative (Figure 1B), and the promoter sequences after site 195 (see
additional file 2A) seemed to be dominated by dimorphic
polymorphism. Compared to CBF1, most of the polymorphic sites in CBF2's promoter were singletons, and the frequencies of informative sites and singletons were
compatible in CBF3 (Figure 1D).

For CBF transcriptional units (TUs) the nucleotide diversity (π) of CBF3 was highest (0.00685) but close to that of
CBF1 (0.00548), while the diversity of CBF2 was still the
lowest (0.00264). However, the nucleotide diversity, π, of
CBF2's TU was 2.4-fold higher than that of its promoter
(Table 1). In the CBF coding regions, 11, 11, and 16 nonsynonymous substitutions were respectively found in
CBF1, -2, and -3. Of the total 38 nonsynonymous substitutions, only three were located in AP2 domains (but outside the proposed alpha-helix motif) which are

responsible for DNA binding. Seven nonsynonymous
substitutions were in the N-terminal region where the
function is unknown. No amino acid replacement was
observed in the NLS. Twenty-eight nonsynonymous substitutions existed in transcriptional activation domains
which were responsible for activation of CBF regulon
genes. Ten of 11 amino acid displacements in CBF2 were
singletons except for one in the N-terminal region (Figure
1C).
Ecotypes Hi-0 and Bl-1 had lost ten amino acids in CBF1's
transcriptional activation domain, but their open-reading
frames were still present. A single adenine insertion was

found in the CBF2 coding region of Kas-2. This insertion,
located at the beginning of the transcriptional activation
domain, led to an early nonsense stop codon in this reading frame, and 92 of ~98 residues of this domain had been
lost. This C-terminal domain is necessary for activation of
the expressions of downstream genes [50]. We believe that
CBF2 in the Kas-2 ecotype has become a null allele. No
indels were found in CBF3's coding regions. We
sequenced CBF4 coding sequences in 34 ecotypes as well,
and no indels were found. Two nonsynonymous substitutions were observed: one was a singleton and the other
was informative.

Distinct patterns of sequence polymorphisms were
observed in different regions of CBF
Tajima's D test was marginally positive in the promoter of
CBF1 (D = 1.96, 0.1 <p < 0.05, Table 1), however, after
removing sites before site 195 (see additional file 2A), the
D value was significantly positive (D = 2.12, p < 0.05).
This suggests a signature of balancing selection dominating the majority of the CBF1 promoter. In the TU of CBF1,
the D value was not significant. In contrast to CBF1, both
the promoter and TU of CBF2 had an excess of singletons,
and Tajima's D tests were significantly negative (-2.32 and
-2.23 in the promoter and TU, respectively, p < 0.01). This
indicates that the entire region of CBF2 was favored by
positive selection, and a beneficial allele has been fixed in
the population. However, a significant negative D value
can also be the result of deriving low-frequency detrimental alleles or a bottleneck effect. The signature of positive
selection of CBF2 was confirmed by other tests and physiological data as described below. Unlike CBF1 and -2,
neither the promoter nor TU was significant in CBF3.

We scanned different regions of CBF promoters and TUs
using sliding windows of Tajima's D test to identify
regions which deviated from neutral expectations. In the
promoter of CBF1, D values after about site 550 (Figure
2A; the region after site 195 in additional file 2A) were
positive, and there were three major regions carrying significantly positive D values, especially in regions within
300 bp upstream of the TU. We identified no regions
which significantly departed from 0 in the promoter of
CBF2, and no positive D values were observed. In the
CBF3 promoter, the proportions of positive and negative
regions were compatible. A significant positive region
(near site 100, Figure 2A) was observed. Fluctuations in D
values in the TUs were smoother than those of the promoter (Figure 2B). The entire region of CBF2's TU had a
negative D value, and two regions located in the transcriptional activation domain were significantly negative (Fig-

ure 2B). Most of the singletons in these two regions were
nonsynonymous substitutions (Figure 1C). CBF1, -2, and
-3 differed in the N-terminal of the AP2 domain where the
D value was nearly significant in CBF1 (D = 1.92) and
negative in CBF2 and -3. Although several informative
polymorphisms in CBF1 in this region contributed to the
difference in D, they were synonymous substitutions.
We obtained four copies of CBF-like sequences from A.
lyrata ssp.petraea. One was closest to At CBF3, and three
were similar to At CBF2. We found no homologs of CBF1
in A. lyrata. A phylogenetic tree was constructed according
to haplotypes of CBFs coding regions (Figure 3). Haplotypes of different CBF were assorted well to the same lineage according to their CBF classification and the
orthologs CBFs (Al CBF2a/2b/2c and Al CBF3) from A. lyrata were just located as outgroups of their assigned lineages. The CBF1 was probably duplicated from the
common ancestor of CBF2/CBF3 before the speciation of
A. thaliana and A. lyrata. (see Figure 3 and Table 3), but
was lost in A. lyrata ; however we could not exclude the
possibility that the divergence of CBF1 has evolved to
such an extent that it could not be found, or the sample
size (26 clones) was simply not large enough.
Fay and Wu's H, and other statistics which use orthologous sequences as outgroups were computed. To obtain
evidence of a recent selective sweep, we used Fay and Wu's
H test, which measures an excess of derived high-frequency mutations to intermediate-frequency mutations.
A negative significant H indicates a recent selective sweep.
The H value for the CBF2 coding region was significant (p
= 0.0015, Table 2) but not significant in CBF3 (p =
0.0681). We used two statistics, Gmean and DKS, to detect
the heterogeneity of polymorphism-to-divergence ratios
in the coding regions of CBF2 and -3. Sliding windows of
the polymorphism-to-divergence ratios were also plotted
(additional file 5). Fixation of an advantageous mutation

Compared to the divergence among cold-induced CBF1, 2, and -3, the divergent region between dehydrationinduced CBF4 and CBF1, -2, and -3 was unique. The AP2
domains were apparently conserved because there were
some gaps in the N-terminal side of this domain. There is
a region within the transcriptional activation domain
which had Ka/Ks ratios which were all > 1 (1.6~3.0), a signature of positive selection in protein evolution, in all
three comparisons. The three highest Ka/Ks peaks covered
almost the same region (Figure 4B).

leads to a selective sweep which reduces the proportion of
polymorphisms. A "valley" in the sliding window plot
indicates a sweep, while balanced polymorphism leads to
a "peak". Gmean is most sensitive for detecting one or two
peaks, and DKS is good at detecting a single low to high
change in polymorphism [37]. The Gmean tests were significant for both CBF2 and -3, and DKS was significant for
CBF2 (Table 2). The results indicated the presence of heterogeneity of polymorphism-to-divergence ratios in the
coding region in CBF2 (and -3). In other words, localized
selective sweeps were detected. Thus, the selective sweep
event in CBF2 (especially in the coding region) gene was
supported by four neutrality tests.

Positive selection in the transcriptional activation domain
So far we have found that the most divergent regions are
in the transcriptional activation domains of CBFs; however, the sliding window plots detected no region with a ω
(Ka/Ks ratio) value of > 1. This is because for sliding window plots, each window (of 50 bp) overlapped with the
previous and following windows because the step size (10
bp) was smaller than the window size. These sizes of the
window and overlapping windows might not have
allowed us to detect smaller regions of positive selection
or to have precisely located the divergent region. Herein
we used a non-overlapping sliding window method to
locate the existence of positive selection for six residues
per window in the transcriptional activation domain.

Purifying selection acts on CBFs but different levels of
divergence were observed among different domains
We computed the ratios of Ka/Ks between all paired CBF
paralogous and orthologous genes (Table 3). The ratio of
Ka/Ks indicates protein evolution where the values of ω of
> 1, = 1, and < 1 respectively indicate positive, neutral, and
purifying selection. The ratios were comparable among
different pair-wise comparisons. The lowest was 0.117
(CBF1 vs. CBF3) and the highest was 0.159 (CBF3 vs.
CBF4). This indicates that strong purifying selection has
been acting on CBFs since their duplication and the speciation of A. thaliana and A. lyrata. Although CBF4 has been
proven to be involved in the dehydration pathway and is
not induced by cold [22], this gene's coding region did
not diverge much from those of CBF1, -2, or -3 based on
Ka/Ks ratios. To scan different divergences along the protein domains, we plotted sliding windows of Ka/Ks for
pairwise comparisons of CBF1, -2, and -3 (Figure 4A), and
between CBF1 (or -2 or -3) and CBF4 (Figure 4B). Substantial differences in divergences were observed. In the
comparisons among CBF1, -2, and -3, the AP2 domain
was the most conserved region especially in the region of
the alpha-helix; the N-terminal regions upstream of the
NLS had moderate ratios ranging from 0.3 to 0.7; and the
transcriptional activation domain had the greatest divergence which contained two major divergent regions with
ratios of 0.997 and 0.808 (Figure 4A). The higher conservation of the AP2 domain in CBF1/2/3 indicates that
members of regulons of each CBF should be similar.

Four regions within this domain were found to carry Ka/Ks
ratios of > 1, including 1.193 in CBF1 and -2 (amino acid
residues 167~172 in Figure 5), 1.704 in CBF2 and -3
(amino acid residues 164~169), 30.51 (amino acid residues 137~142) and 22.08 (amino acid residues 162~167)
in CBF1 and -3 comparisons (sliding window plot not
shown). Compared to the sliding windows of Figure 4,
this approach more-precisely located sites which may be
under positive selection (Figure 5, regions with gray
blocks). It is worth noting that except for the region
labeled (with a ω value of > 1) from amino residues 137
to 142 in the comparison of CBF1 and -3, three other
regions almost completely overlapped (residue sites
162~172), and therefore actually two regions were under
positive selection in this domain after CBF duplication.
We used codeml in the PAML3.15 package [45] to estimate ω values among sites with different models. CBF2
sequences could not be computed because too many
branches had collapsed after the bootstrap re-sampling.
The results of all LRTs for CBF1 and -3 were significant
(the highest p value was 0.002 among all LRTs). M2a, M3,
and M8 all identified a small proportion of protein (<
1%) with ω values of > 1, while most portions of CBF1
and -3 were under purifying selection. One positively
selected site, 178 T (181 T in Figure 5; site703 in additional file 2B) was identified in CBF1, and two sites, 2 S
(125 bp of CDS in additional file 4B) and 151E (152E in
Figure 5; site572 in additional file 4B), were identified in

In CBF1, a 211-bp region in the 3'-end of promoter was
substituted with a 261-bp insertion in Ita-0, and a 365-bp
insertion was found just 10 bp from the transcriptional
initiation site in Co-1 (see additional file 2). CBF1 expression in Ita-0 was low, and the signal was still visible within

Sites of predicted positive selection in the transcriptional activation domains of CBF1, -2, and -3. The figures
were modified according to Figure 3B of Wang et al. [50]. Ninety-eight amino acids of the CBF1 C-terminal were aligned with
the same domains of CBF2 and -3 (Col ecotype). The numbers above the upper panel are amino acid numbers of the protein
sequence alignment. Six hydrophobic clusters are labeled by a line above each cluster, and hydrophobic residues within clusters
are indicated by black blocks. Reporter constructs possessing an alanine-substituted CBF1 activation domain were used to estimate the contribution of motifs or residues to transactivation activity. The alanine-substituted residues are indicated by black
underlining below each site, and the percentages of changes in reporter enzyme (β-galactosidase) activity related to the wildtype CBF1 activation domain construct are indicated just below each underlined alanine substitution. Sequences boxed by rectangles indicate regions which had the highest Ka/Ks ratios in the transcriptional activation domains in Figure 4A. Gray blocks
covering amino acid sequences indicate regions in which the Ka/Ks ratios exceed 1 using a non-overlapping sliding window
method (i.e., the gray block covering residue sites 137 to 142 representing this region of six residues was detected in the comparison of CBF1 and -3). There are three pair-wise comparisons between CBF1, -2, and -3, and four regions were labeled by
gray blocks.

the same expression scale (Figure 6), while Co-1 had no
CBF1 expression. Although CBF2 in Cvi-0 had lost most
of the sequenced promoter (the region of 1~1030 bp was
lost), CBF2 was still expressed at a low level. In CBF3 promoters, an 864-bp region was substituted with a 1798-bp
insertion in Kas-2. The signal intensity of CBF3 expression
in Kas-2 was ~10-3 fold compared to those of the others.
We believe the 1798-bp substitution removed all cis-elements from the Kas-2 CBF3's promoter.
In addition to naturally occurring mutants, we found that
the expressions of CBF3 in Cvi-0 and Co-1, and CBF1 in
Cvi-0 and Can-0 after 4°C treatment for 1.5 h were consistently low in different batches. However, gene expressions in most other ecotypes were not consistently high or
low among batches (data not shown).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/111

[51,52]. The π values of CBF3's promoter, and CBF1 and 3's TUs are close to these two estimates. Altogether, CBF2
was the most highly conserved gene in the promoter
region and TU of this small family, and CBF1 carried the
highest nucleotide diversity in the promoter, the diversity
of TU was compatible with that of the TU of CBF3. The
nucleotide diversities of promoters of CBFs were greater
than those among TUs. This suggests that the promoters
and TUs of CBFs have been subjected to distinct selection
mechanisms and/or demographic histories. With respect
to protein evolution, AP2 domains were very conservative
compared to the transcriptional activation domains. This
suggests that among CBFs in Arabidopsis, the DNA targeting abilities have not changed throughout their evolutionary history. The divergence, if any, of CBF biochemical
functions should exist in transcriptional activation
domains.

Discussion
DNA sequence polymorphism
The overall level of genome-wide polymorphism in Arabidopsis was estimated in the values between 0.06 and 0.07

Different selection forces working on different CBF genes

form of purifying selection. As to protein evolution, these
three duplicate genes are functionally constrained as evidenced by the Ka/Ks ratios being much lower than the
neutral expectation of 1 for both paralogs and orthologs
(Table 3). The excess of low-frequency polymorphisms for
CBF2 indicates that it is strictly constrained. The nucleotide variation in the CBF1 promoter was characterized by
dimorphism indicating balancing selection, while the
entire region of CBF3 did not deviate from neutral expectations.
However, a strong population structure and genome-wide
deviation from the standard neutral model in A. thaliana
were reported [51,52]. Nordberg et al. [51] suggested that
the skewness of Tajima's D of the A. thaliana genome was
due to an excess of rare alleles and demographic processes. To reassess the influence of the population structure, we used the Mantel test (zt software [53]) to evaluate
the existence of isolation-by-distance in our dataset. The
promoters and transcriptional units of CBF1, -2, and -3
were examined. The results from both regions of CBF2
were not significant (promoter: r = -0.055, p = 0.345; TU:
r = -0.031, p = 0.556), but were significant in the promoters of CBF1 and -3 (r = 0.146, p = 0.037; and r = 0.134, p
= 0.046). It seems the results from Tajima's D test of CBF2
are independent of the population structure. Nevertheless, the population structure is expected to push Tajima's
D toward positive values [51], and this effect may have
partially contributed to the significantly positive D of
CBF1's promoter. However, the dimorphism we observed
was not related to the geographic distribution of ecotypes.
The origins of maintaining such allelic dimorphism are
still unclear. This pattern of allelic dimorphism is not
unprecedented in Arabidopsis, having been reported for
many loci including TFL1 [54]. It may be a result of the
demographic history of this species complex [55].
We do think that CBF2 played a unique role different
from those of CBF1 and -3 after gene duplication. It is possible that the regulatory function of CBF2 was favored by
positive selection which was detected in our dataset.
Positive selection sites in the transcriptional activation
domain
The transcriptional activation domain of CBF1 was studied by Wang et al. [50], and six hydrophobic cluster motifs
were identified by a computational analysis. They used a
series of GAL4DBD/CBF1AD (CBF1AD: transcriptional activation domain) fusion constructs containing either nonsense codon introductions or alanine substitutions in
CBF1AD to assay their abilities to transactivate the GAL4responsive lacZ reporter enzyme in yeast. Based on the
high sequence identity and the fact that almost the same
set of downstream genes can be activated by CBF1, -2, and
-3, the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of CBF

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/111

regulons should be very similar. Thus, the functional dissection of this domain from CBF1 might also be the case
in CBF2 and -3.
The non-overlapping sliding window of Ka/Ks suggests
that two possible regions were favored by positive selection after gene duplication (Figure 5). These two regions
are not located in the hydrophobic clusters 2, 3, and 4
which Wang et al. [50] considered to have been the most
critical motifs in transactivation. In these two regions,
four of six residues substituted by alanine led to substantial changes in reporter enzyme activities (139T → A, 162P
→ A, 165S → A, and 169F → A, Figure 5). It was interesting to note that the activity increase of 162P → A was the
highest among substitutions, and 169F → A was also the
greatest among those that led to activity decreases.
We want to see whether the positive selection site in the
sequence agrees with the two regions mentioned above.
With the site models of the codeml program, two positively selected amino acids were identified in the transcriptional activation domain as expected but not locate
in the two regions identified by the sliding window of Ka/
Ks method.
A decrease of 26% of reporter enzyme activity was
observed when alanine was substituted for 181 T of CBF1,
and in CBF3, 152E is in hydrophobic cluster 1. When the
same site in CBF1 was substituted by alanine (152E → A),
a 63% increase in reporter activity was observed (Figure
5).
Hydrophobic residues within the functionally critical
HC2, -3, and -4 of CBFs were found to be conserved
among different ecotypes. Most positively selected regions
of the activation domain identified in this paper are
located outside of critical motifs. This difference is
because the meaning of Ka/Ks is different from that of
hydrophobic cluster, the former emphasizes variation in
amino acid replacement and the latter in no or low variation. It implies that the hydrophobic cluster is critical in
the interaction with other activator and the two regions
found in this study might involve in tuning the transcriptional activation.
Ecotypes from lower latitude may accumulate mutations
that reduce CBFs expressions
Some variations we found for specific nucleotides of the
promoters of CBF1 and -3 were probably responsible for
the low level of gene expression. CBF1 of Cvi-0 has four
nucleotides which are unique among the ecotypes (nos. 1,
249, 469, and 541, see additional file 2), while Can-0 has
two unique nucleotides (nos. 57 and 469). CBF3 of Cvi-0
of has four nucleotides which are unique among the ecotypes (nos. 338, 1017, 1167, and 1284 in additional file

4). However, none of these nucleotides was located in the
known cis-element of CBF1 or -3 when screened by the
PLANTCARE website [56].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/111

subfunction in the promoter is also a process leading to
separate expression control of CBFs.

Conclusion
It is interesting to note that singletons of the CBF1 promoters of Cvi-0 and Can-0 comprised 35% (6/17) of the
34 accessions, and nucleotide mutations mainly occurred
in accessions collected from lower latitudes (see additional file 2). Singletons of the CBF3 promoters of Cvi-0
and Co-1 comprised 16% (5/31) of the 34 accessions, and
nucleotide mutations also mainly occurred in lower latitudes (see additional file 4). Thus lower latitudes (probably indicating warmer-temperature environments) might
allow accumulation of nucleotide mutations in the promoter regions.
Evidence of functional diversification in CBF1, -2, and -3
In a study to test for benefits and costs (number of fruits)
of cold tolerance, CBF2 and CBF3 overexpressers showed
costs of cold tolerance and no fitness benefits in control
and cold environments. CBF1-overexpressing plants
showed no fitness costs of cold tolerance in the control
environment and showed a marginal fitness benefit in the
cold environment [24]. A CBF2 knockout mutant, cbf2,
had a higher capacity to tolerate freezing than wild-type
ones which was correlated with stronger and more-sustained expressions of CBF1 and CBF3 in the mutant. They
concluded that CBF2 is a negative regulator of CBF1 and
CBF3 [25], and CBF2 but not CBF1 and CBF3 was found
as a gene contributed to a major freezing QTL locus [26].
Moreover, in contrast to CBF2, CBF1 and CBF3 positively
regulate cold acclimation by activating the same subset of
CBF-target genes [57]. These studies indicated functional
changes have occurred at the level of CBF proteins.

Ecotype Kas-2 carries a CBF3 knockout allele and a null
allele CBF2 gene due to a single insertion in the coding
region. At first, we predicted that CBF1, which is the only
functional CBF induced by cold, in this ecotype would be
highly expressed to compensate for the double-mutant
effect. However, this prediction was not correct. This is
also evidence that CBF1, -2, and -3 are not strictly functional equivalents.
Evolutionarily important changes have also occurred at
the level of gene regulation in CBF1, -2, and -3 in addition
to protein function. Chinnusamy et al. [23] identified a
mutant, ICE1 (inducer of CBF expression 1), that results
in the CBF3 gene no longer being induced in response to
low temperature, but which has little effect on cold induction of CBF1 and CBF2. CBFs are subjected to different
temporal regulation during cold acclimation. Recently,
Novillo et al. [57] further supported that CBF1 and CBF3
are regulated in a different way then CBF2. Although subfunctionalization of the coding region has been detected,

In summary according to sequence analyses, we demonstrate that different selection forces have been working on
the promoter and coding regions of CBF1, -2, and -3. After
CBF duplication, CBF2 experienced selective sweeps in the
promoter and coding regions, and this may have resulted
in its unique functional divergence which differs from
those of CBF1 and -3. The promoter of CBF1 has a signature of balancing selection, while CBF3 did not deviate
from neutrality. CBF promoters share less similarity than
do the coding regions, indicating they are differentially
regulated or have been shaped by different evolutionary
forces. There is evidence of positive selection in both the
CBF1 and -3' transcriptional activation domains within
each domain and between them. CBF1 and -3 were shown
to activate same regulons but need to work cooperatively
[57], and they are regulated by different upstream factors
[23]. The function of the progenitor CBF gene has not
been determined to date. Nevertheless, it seems that the
complements of CBF1 and -3 are under subfunctionalization, while CBF2, with a different regulatory role, might
be a case of neofunctionalization.

Methods
Growth conditions, genomic polymerase chain reaction
(PCR), and sequencing
All ecotype resources are listed in the supplementary
materials (see additional file 1). The seeds were chilled at
4°C in the dark for 5 days before being grown in soil
medium (Bio-mix TTing Substratum, Moerdijk, Nederland). Seeds of A. lyrata ssp.petraea (Plech, Bavaria, Germany) were chilled for more than 2 weeks. The seedlings
were grown at 22°C under a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod with a light intensity of ~100 μE/m2/s. For the gene
expression study, three-week old seedlings were treated at
4°C, for 1.5 h under fluorescent lights at 40 μE/m2s. To
avoid the effects of circadian clock behavior of CBFs, we
always started the chilling treatment at 13:00 (ZT4, [27]).
After cold treatment, leaves from five individuals were
combined as one sample for each ecotype and were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Three independent trials
were performed. The interval between trials was 3~4
weeks.

Genomic DNA was extracted following a modified protocol according to Doyle and Doyle [28] and stored at 20°C. Primers (see additional files 6 and 7 for primer
sequences and PCR conditions) were designed according
to the ecotype Col genomic sequence in The Arabidopsis
Information Resource (TAIR) [29] using the Primer3 program [30]. We used the PreMix2.0 (TOPBIO, Taipei, Taiwan) PCR reagent mix for all PCR reactions. The PCR

products were run on 1% agarose gels, and the desired
bands were excised for purification and direct sequencing
using a Taq Dye Dideoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA) and an ABI
3730 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Vector NTI Suite 9
Contig-Express (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) was
used for sequence assembly and chromatogram inspection.
The CBF3 genes in the various ecotypes were first
sequenced. To avoid PCR and sequencing errors, two
independent PCR samples for each ecotype were separately sequenced. In addition to the primers used in the
PCRs, additional primers were designed and used in
sequenced regions with ambiguous signals. No sequence
difference was observed among any two independent
CBF3 sequence replicates, and therefore we performed
one PCR for CBF1 and -2. Primers in the PCR reactions for
CBF1 and -2 were used for sequencing, and additional
primers were also used to sequence ambiguous regions
(the second PCRs were performed for sequencing ambiguous regions). To isolate CBF orthologs from A. lyrata,
primers were designed to amplify the coding regions. The
genomic-PCR products from A. lyrata were purified by gelelution. After the PCR fragments were ligated into the vector, pGEM®-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), the
constructs were transformed to competent DH5-α cells
(RBC Bioscience, Taipei, Taiwan). Twenty-six colonies
were selected for sequencing. Each copy of the CBF
orthologs was determined based on at least three clones.
In this research, because the sequences of CBF4 were used
as the outgroup for certain sequence and phylogenetic
analyses mentioned below, only the coding regions of
CBF4 were determined.
Sequence data from this article have been deposited with
the GenBank Data Libraries under accession nos:
EF523193~EF523195,
and
EF522962~EF523192,
EF523196. Genomic sequences of Col of AT4G25470
(CBF2), AT4G25480 (CBF3), AT4G25490 (CBF1), and
AT5G51990 (CBF4) were retrieved from TAIR.
Sequence analysis
Sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL X [31]. Certain
insertions were manually removed after sequence alignments to maximize alignable regions prior to calculating
the polymorphism parameters. In the analysis of promoter sequences, CBF1, -2, and -3 respectively of Ita-0,
Cvi-0, and Kas-2 were excluded. In the promoter
sequences from Ita-0's CBF1 and Kas-2's CBF3, there was
a region substituted by a sequence from another part of
the genome. Most parts of the CBF2 promoter region had
been lost in Cvi-0 in the region we surveyed. The promoter of Co-1 CBF1 was included in our analysis after
removing a 365-bp insertion near the site of transcriptional initiation. In the analysis of nucleotide polymor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/111

phism of the transcriptional unit, the CBF2 sequences
from Ita-0 and Kas-2 were included after removing their
insertions in the 3' untranslated region (UTR). In Ita-0, a
long insertion (> 1100 bp) and a GGGAAA sequence (5
bp before the insertion) were removed from the 3'UTR,
but we did not finish sequencing this insertion. The
remaining 3'UTR sequence of Ita-0 after this insertion was
treated as missing data. Coding sequences of CBF1 of Hi0 and Bl-1 and CBF2 of Kas-2 were not analyzed in the Ka/
Ks calculation to avoid loss of polymorphism information
in these regions due to gaps that led to amino acid deletions (Hi-0 and Bl-1) and frame-shifts (Kas-2).
Sequence divergences between orthologs and paralogs
were estimated using MEGA3.1 [32]. The evolutionary
distance, K, between CBF promoters (500 bp upstream
from the TU) were computed using the Kimura 2-paramater substitution model, and gaps were treated as missing
data. Distances between orthologous coding sequences,
and between paralogous sequences were computed from
synonymous (Ks) and nonsynonymous sites (Ka) by the
Nei-Gojobori method [33]. All standard errors of divergence distances were determined using 500 bootstrap replicates.
The nucleotide diversity, Tajima's D test [34], Fay and
Wu's H [35], and a sliding window analysis were carried
out using DNASP4.10 [36]. The window size for the promoter and TU analyses was 100 bp with a step size of 20
bp. The window size for the Ka/Ks sliding window plots
was 50 bp with a step size of 10 bp. In order to identify
fluctuations in Ka/Ks more precisely in the transcriptional
activation domains, we used a sliding window approach
in which the window and step sizes were both 18 bp. This
allowed non-overlapping window scanning for six residues per window. Fay and Wu's H was computed using A.
lyrata CBF orthologs as outgroups. The heterogeneity of
polymorphisms to fixed differences was computed using
DNA Slider1.11 [37]. Only sequences from silent sites
were considered. For Gmean and DKS statistics, R = 2, 4, 8,
16, and 32 were simulated with 1000 replicates. The highest p value of each statistic is reported.
A CBF phylogenetic tree was constructed by the Neighborjoining method [38] under the HKY85 [39] model based
on the coding sequences using PAUP*4.10 [40]. One
thousand bootstrap replicates were performed, and > 50%
frequencies are shown. The bootstraps values are given at
each node. One sequence (from one ecotype) of each haplotype of coding sequences was used. CBF homologs from
Lycopersicon esculentum, Le CBF1, -2, and -3 (GenBank
accession nos.: AY034473, AY497899, and AY497899,
respectively), were used as outgroups.
In addition to locating the sequence region being under
selection by the sliding window approach, we want to furPage 13 of 16

ther find the sites are positively selected. Because it is
impossible that positive selection operates on every lineage (at different times) and every codon has the same
strength, Yang developed statistical tests based on the
maximum-likelihood method [41-43] to estimate specific
lineages or codons which are under positive selection. The
value of ω is allowed to vary among sites (codons), and
sites under positive selection can be identified by site
models. In the one-ratio model (M0), all lineages and
sites have the same value of ω. In the site models (M1a,
M2a, M3, M7, and M8), classes of ω are allowed according
to different assumptions [41,43]. These models were
designed as hierarchal relationships, and log likelihood
values obtained by M0 (one-ratio), M1a (nearly neutral),
M2a (positive selection), M3 (discrete), M7 (beta), and
M8 (beta and selection) were compared using likelihood
ratio tests (LRTs). The significances of M0 vs. M3, M1a vs.
M2a, and M7 vs. M8 were estimated [44]. Codeml in the
PAML3.15 package [45] was used to detect specific sites
(or codons) which were positively selected. Phylogenetic
trees of CBF1, -2, and -3 were constructed by maximumlikelihood using the HKY85 [39] model, and > 50%
branching topology was retained after 1000 bootstrap
replicates. Trees were constructed according to full-length
(promoter and TU) sequences using PAUP*4.10 [40].
CBF1, -2, and -3 respectively in Ita-0, Cvi-0, and Kas-2
were abandoned when estimating positively selected
codons because of their long sequence indels.
The promoter sequences of CBF genes were analyzed
using TCS1.21 software [46]. Alignment gaps were treated
as missing data. The promoters of CBF1, -2, and -3 were
sorted according to haplotypes. There are 15, 15, and 18
haplotypes of the CBF1, -2, and -3 promoters, respectively. Promoter haplotypes of ecotypes with higher frequencies were selected, and totally 16 ecotypes were
chosen for the CBF expression analysis.
RNA extraction and complementary (c)DNA synthesis
RNA was isolated using the REzol™ C & T (Protech, Taipei,
Taiwan) reagent following the manufacturer's protocol.
RNA was dissolved in DEPC-treated sterile water. After
checking the RNA integrity on a 1% agarose gel, 4 μl (2
μg) of RNA was used to synthesize cDNA for each 20-μl
reaction volume by Superscript III-RT with oligo-dT12–18
primers according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Each sample was diluted1/20-fold.
Real-time PCR analysis
Different promoter haplotypes were used for real-time
PCR analysis. The promoter haplotypes were sorted by
TCS [46], and 16 ecotypes were chosen (covering most of
promoter haplotypes) for expression analysis.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/111

Three primer pairs were designed to measure the expressions of CBF1, -2, and -3 (see additional file 8 for primer
sequences). The primer pair for CBF1 expression measurements, CBF1LP212/CBF1RP369, was designed according
to the sequence of the N-terminal coding region; the
length of the CBF1 PCR fragment was 158 bp. For CBF2
measurements, the primer pair, CBF2LP744/CBF2RP913,
was designed according to sequences of the C-terminal
coding region and 3'UTR; the length of the CBF2 PCR
fragment was 170 bp. For CBF3, the primer pair,
CBF3LP38/CBF3RP196, was designed from the sequence
of the 5'UTR and N-terminal of the coding region; the
length of the CBF3 PCR fragment was 159 bp. All primers
were designed in regions specific to each CBF but which
were conserved among the ecotypes used. Therefore, to
consider the specificity and annealing temperatures of the
primer pairs, we could not design them all according to
the 3'-end of sequences since reverse transcription may
produce truncated cDNA. For each cDNA sample, the
expressions of CBF1, -2, and -3 were all analyzed. Primers
of the housekeeping genes ACTIN2 (AT3G18780) and
ACT2LP602/ACT2RP739, were designed to span a 78-bp
2nd intron. This allowed us to detect genomic DNA contamination in our cDNA samples. The presence of two or
more PCR products, with different lengths and GC contents, was detected by melting kinetics, which were measured in every plate for every sample. The annealing
temperature (Tm) of all primer pairs was close to 60°C.
After sequencing the PCR products amplified by different
primer pairs, we confirmed that our amplifications were
specific to each CBF and ACTIN2, but not other highly
similar members.
We used the iCycler iQ real-time detection system (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) to quantify gene
expression. Fifteen-microliter reaction mixtures (per well)
contained 7.5 μl of the two-fold enzyme mix (iQ™ SYBR
Green Supermix, Bio-Rad), 1.9 μl deionized/sterile water,
0.3 μl of each primer (300 nM final concentration), and 5
μl diluted cDNA (~0.1 μg). We used the same PCR protocol for all CBF1, -2, and -3 and ACTIN2 primer pairs. The
PCR protocol was 95°C 3 min for hot-start polymerase
(one cycle), 95°C 30 s, 60°C 30 s, and 72°C 15 s for 40
cycles. After each PCR we performed melting kinetics to
monitor the specificity of the CBF and ACTIN2 amplifications.
Standard curves of specific CBFs and ACTIN2 were established in every plate to quantify the relative expression
levels (the formula of the standard curve quantification
method was based on the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence
Detection System user bulletin #2). For each cold-treated
cDNA sample, four sample repeats were measured in
every plate for both the CBFs and ACTIN2. The data of
real-time PCR were analyzed using iCycler iQ optical sys-

tem software 3.1 (Bio-Rad). Baseline cycles were set to
two~ten cycles, and the threshold position of the fluorescence was set to 30. Expressed quantities of each CBF of
the ecotypes were normalized to ACTIN2 quantities of the
same ecotype. PCR efficiencies of different primer pairs
were calculated according to Rasmussen's method [47].
The average PCR efficiency was > 97%.

CBF1 sequence polymorphism. Description: (A) promoter region (accession nos.: EF522995~EF523027); (B) transcriptional unit (TU) region
(accession nos.: EF522962~EF522994); UTR, untranslated region;
CDS, coding sequence. Only polymorphic sites are listed. The number of
each polymorphic site is listed according to its position in the sequence
alignment, and the greater the number is, the closer to the transcriptional
starting site it is. Dots represent nucleotides and indels identical to the Col
reference; deletions and insertions related to the Col sequence are indicated by minus (-) and plus (+) symbols, respectively. The sequences of
indels of more than 1 bp (base pair) are not shown. The length of each
indel is listed at the bottom. The bold lines above the TU indicate the
regions of the 5'UTR, CDS, and 3'UTR. Regions with long sequence deletions are blank; the ABRC (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center) [73]
stock numbers are next to the abbreviation of ecotypes. The promoter
region from site 680 to the end (261 bp) was substituted by a 211-bp
insertion in Ita-0.

CBF2 sequence polymorphism. Description: (A) promoter region (accession nos.: EF523061~EF523093); (B) transcriptional unit (TU) region
(accession nos.: EF523028~EF523060). The symbols are the same as
those in Figure 1. From site 648 to 665 in the promoter, there were different numbers of TA and TAA simple sequence repeats among ecotypes,
but this region was absent from Kas-2 (from site 604). In our sequenced
promoter region, site 1~1030 was absent from Cvi-0. The sequence of Ita0 after site 837 in the TU was excluded due to an insertion (of unknown
length).
