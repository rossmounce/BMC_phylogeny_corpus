Abstract
Background: A new subgroup of HIV-1, designated Group P, was recently detected in two unrelated patients of
Cameroonian origin. HIV-1 Group P phylogenetically clusters with SIVgor suggesting that it is the result of a crossspecies transmission from gorillas. Until today, HIV-1 Group P has only been detected in two patients, and its
degree of adaptation to the human host is largely unknown. Previous data have shown that pandemic HIV-1
Group M, but not non-pandemic Group O or rare Group N viruses, efficiently antagonize the human orthologue of
the restriction factor tetherin (BST-2, HM1.24, CD317) suggesting that primate lentiviruses may have to gain antitetherin activity for efficient spread in the human population. Thus far, three SIV/HIV gene products (vpu, nef and
env) are known to have the potential to counteract primate tetherin proteins, often in a species-specific manner.
Here, we examined how long Group P may have been circulating in humans and determined its capability to
antagonize human tetherin as an indicator of adaptation to humans.
Results: Our data suggest that HIV-1 Group P entered the human population between 1845 and 1989. Vpu, Env and
Nef proteins from both Group P viruses failed to counteract human or gorilla tetherin to promote efficient release of
HIV-1 virions, although both Group P Nef proteins moderately downmodulated gorilla tetherin from the cell surface.
Notably, Vpu, Env and Nef alleles from the two HIV-1 P strains were all able to reduce CD4 cell surface expression.
Conclusions: Our analyses of the two reported HIV-1 Group P viruses suggest that zoonosis occurred in the last
170 years and further support that pandemic HIV-1 Group M strains are better adapted to humans than nonpandemic or rare Group O, N and P viruses. The inability to antagonize human tetherin may potentially explain the
limited spread of HIV-1 Group P in the human population.

Background
The determinants of successful cross-species transmissions
of primate lentiviruses are poorly understood, and may be
critical in developing successful preventive strategies
against primate lentiviral zoonoses in the future. Besides
environmental factors, the adaptation of the virus to the
immune system of its new host may determine its spread
after zoonotic transmission. Mammalian restriction factors
are interferon-inducible members of the innate immune
system, and include the proteins TRIM5a and APOBEC3G/F [1-3]. These proteins evolved under positive

selection pressure and provide barriers to cross-species
transmission. The high variability of primate lentiviruses,
however, may allow them to become resistant to TRIM5a
through capsid sequence variation [4], and to gain activity
against the restriction factors in the new host by the acquisition of mutations in their accessory genes. Tetherin, the
most recently described restriction factor expressed by all
major cellular targets of HIV infection (including CD4+
lymphocytes), is a transmembrane protein found at the
plasma membrane, with an extracellular domain bearing a
GPI anchor at its C-terminus [5]. This unusual topology
with two membrane anchors enables tetherin to tether
budding viruses to the infected cell, thus preventing their
release, with subsequent internalization and degradation
[6-9]. The delicate balance between antiviral restriction
factors and viral escape is highlighted by the fact that

single amino acid changes in viral or mammalian proteins
may lead to gain or loss of function [10-13].
Most simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs), including SIVcpz and SIVgor that are found in chimpanzees
and gorillas (reviewed in [14]), and represent the direct
precursors of HIV-1, use Nef to antagonize tetherin
[15-20], whilst SIV infecting certain monkeys (SIVgsn,
SIVmus, SIVmon) use Vpu [17,21]. Human tetherin,
however, is resistant to Nef due to a deletion in its cytoplasmic tail [15-20]. During its adaptation to humans,
HIV-1 Group M has perfectly mastered this hurdle by
switching from Nef to Vpu to antagonize human tetherin
[16,17]. In contrast, Vpu proteins from non-pandemic
Group O viruses do not antagonize tetherin and those of
the rare Group N viruses gained some modest antitetherin activity but do not degrade CD4 [17,21]. The
finding that pandemic HIV-1 M strains counteract
human tetherin substantially more effectively than nonpandemic or rare Group O and N viruses suggests that
effective tetherin antagonism may have been required for
the efficient global spread of HIV/AIDS. The recent identification of a fourth group of HIV-1, designated HIV-1
Group P, that is closely related to SIVgor and most likely
resulted from an independent gorilla-human transmission [22,23], provides another interesting opportunity to
evaluate a possible correlation between effective tetherin
antagonism and viral spread. Thus far, only two HIV-1
Group P strains have been described. The first one
(RBF168) was isolated from a woman who had lived near
Yaoundé, Cameroon [22]. The second (06CMU14788)
was identified in a stored serum sample from a male
patient admitted to Yaoundé hospital in 2006 [23]. In the

present study, we performed phylogenetic analyses to
assess how long Group P viruses may have been circulating in the human population and examined whether lack
of anti-tetherin activity and thus suboptimal adaptation
to humans may explain their limited spread in the
human population.

Results
HIV-1 Group P entered the human population between
1845 and 1989

To determine whether HIV-1 Group P may have a relatively recent origin, we estimated the likely date of its
zoonotic transmission by dating the HIV-1 Group P/SIVgor time of most recent common ancestor (tMRCA), as
well as the MRCA of RBF168 and 06CMU14788. This
analysis was performed using the Bayesian Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework [24] implemented in
the package BEASTv1.5.2. [25], using gag, pol and env
gene sequences. We found good agreement in the HIV-1
Group P/SIVgor tMRCA estimates (Figure 1), obtained
on the basis of the gag (1899 [95% Higher Probability
Density: 1855-1938]), pol (1864 [1813-1912]) and env
genes (1845 [1766-1912]). We also assessed the impact of
including partial gag and pol sequences, of 1056 and 891
nucleotides respectively, from a more divergent SIVgor
strain (BQ664) for which full-length sequence is not
available [26]. No significant changes in the HIV-1
Group P/SIVgor tMRCA estimates were observed (data
not shown). The tMRCA for RBF168 and 06CMU14788
was also estimated at each of the three loci (Figure 1),
and gave consistent results as follows: gag 1982 (19701992), pol 1989 (1980-1995) and env 1971 (1951-1988).

Based on these analyses, we estimate that zoonosis
occurred between 1845 and 1989. Sequences from additional HIV-1 Group P viruses and SIVgor strains would
be required for more precise estimates. HIV-1 Group M
is thought to have entered the human population around
1908 (1884-1924), Group O between 1905 and 1920
(1866-1940) [27,28], and Group N around 1963 (19481977) [28,29]. Thus, the four independent transmission
events that gave rise to HIV-1 Groups M, O, N and P
most likely all occurred relatively recently, i.e. within the
last 170 years.
HIV-1 P Group Vpu and Nef downregulate CD4 cell
surface expression

We next assessed the ability of the two HIV-1 Group P
viruses to antagonize gorilla and human tetherin as an
indicator of adaptation to humans. To this end, the vpu or
nef genes from HIV-1 P RBF168 and 06CMU14788 as
well as two SIVgor strains (cp2139 and BQ644) were
cloned into the bi-cistronic CMV-based pCGCG expression vector coexpressing the enhanced version of green
fluorescent protein (eGFP) [30] and fused to a C-terminal
AU1-tag. As further controls, we included nef and vpu
alleles from five divergent HIV-1 M strains representing
subtypes B (NL4-3, JR-CSF, founder virus CH106), C
(C.KA) and D (D.ZA). Western blot analyses showed that
all Vpu and Nef proteins were expressed at detectable
levels (Figure 2A, B). Of note, our blots are consistent with
previous observations that some Vpu proteins tend to
aggregate and that the migration pattern on Western blots
does not always reflect the calculated molecular weight
[17]. Next, we determined whether the HIV-1 P Vpu and
Nef proteins reduce cell surface expression of CD4. To
measure this, 293T cells were cotransfected with vectors
coexpressing vpu or nef and eGFP (or eGFP alone for control) together with a human CD4 expression construct, as
previously described [17,31,32]. In the absence of Vpu or
Nef, the cells expressed high levels of CD4 (Figure 2C).
However, coexpression of the HIV-1 P Vpu decreased
CD4 surface expression by more than 90% and HIV-1 P
Nef reduced CD4 levels by 55 to 75% (Figure 2D).
HIV-1 P Group Vpu and Nef are unable to counteract
tetherin

We next tested the activity of Group P Vpu and Nef proteins against human and gorilla tetherin. To this end, we
determined the levels of tetherin surface expression and
infectious virus yields from HEK 293T cells cotransfected
with a vpu/nef-deleted (ΔvpuΔnef) HIV-1 Group M NL43 proviral construct [33], a tetherin expression plasmid,
and a vector expressing Vpu or Nef [17]. As expected,
HIV-1 Group M Vpus downregulated human tetherin
about 5- to 6-fold (Figure 3A, B). In contrast, both HIV-1
Group P vpu alleles did not reduce tetherin cell surface

expression (Figure 3B). This is not surprising since
HIV-1 Group P Vpus lack the AxxxAxxxW transmembrane motif known to be critical for tetherin antagonism
by HIV-1 Group M Vpus and may thus not interact with
this restriction factor [34] (Additional file 1). Expression
of HIV-1 P RBF168 and 06CMU14788 Nef did not affect
surface expression of human tetherin either, but slightly
decreased gorilla tetherin surface expression by 1.5- to
2.5-fold (Figure 3B). Unlike the SIVgor Nef, however,
both HIV-1 Group P Nef proteins were unable to
increase virion release in the presence of gorilla tetherin
(Figure 3C-E and Additional file 2). This observation is
consistent with reports that Vpu-mediated downmodulation of tetherin and viral release may be separable activities [35,36], although a similar finding has not yet been
reported for Nef. Importantly, neither HIV-1 Group P
Vpu nor Nef proteins were able to increase infectious virion or p24 release in the presence of human tetherin
(Figure 3C-E and S2). This lack of anti-tetherin activity
of Nef and Vpu shows that Group P viruses are not yet
optimally adapted to the human host.
Group P Envs reduce CD4 cell surface expression but do
not counteract tetherin

Besides Nef and Vpu, Env is the third primate lentiviral
protein known to display anti-tetherin activity [11,37].
Thus, we also assessed the ability of HIV-1 Group P Env
to antagonize tetherin. For this, both HIV-1 Group P env
genes were chemically synthesized and cloned into the
pCAGGS expression vector. Functional expression was
assessed by measuring the levels of CD4 on 293T cells
cotransfected with CD4 and Env expression constructs.
We found that Group P Envs reduced CD4 surface expression levels about 2-fold, which is similar to the Group M
NL4-3 Env (Figure 4A). We further demonstrated expression of functional RBF168 and 06CMU14788 env gene
products by successful pseudotyping of an env-deficient
HIV-1 M NL4-3 proviral construct and subsequent infection of TZM-bl reporter cells (Figure 4B).
We then tested antagonism of human tetherin by
cotransfecting a vpu/nef/env-deleted (DvpuDnefDenv)
HIV-1 NL4-3 proviral construct along with RBF168 and
06CMU14788 Env in the presence of increasing
amounts of tetherin expression plasmid. Both HIV-1
Group P Envs were unable to downregulate human
tetherin from the cell surface (Figure 4C) and failed to
increase virion release in the presence of human tetherin
(Figure 4D). Since a previous study has shown that HIV2 Env only antagonizes endogenous tetherin in Hela
cells, but not transiently expressed tetherin in HEK
293T cells [37], we transfected Env expression plasmids
along with the DvpuDnefDenv HIV-1 NL4-3 proviral
construct in HeLa cells and still found no effect of
Group P Env on viral release (data not shown).

Discussion
Previous studies suggest that effective tetherin antagonism may have been a prerequisite for the effective global
spread of HIV/AIDS [16,17]. The human tetherin orthologue contains a deletion in the N-terminal cytoplasmic
tail that renders human tetherin resistant to the accessory viral Nef protein. Nef is used by most primate lentiviruses, including SIVcpz, SIVgor and SIVsmm, the

direct precursors of HIV-1 and HIV-2, to counteract
tetherin in their respective host species. Thus, tetherin
represents a significant barrier to effective zoonotic
transmission of primate lentiviruses [15-20]. Pandemic
HIV-1 Group M strains fully cleared this hurdle by
switching from Nef to Vpu to counteract tetherin in the
new human host [17]. In contrast, the non-pandemic
Group O viruses seem to be unable to antagonize

human tetherin and the rare Group N viruses gained
only modest anti-tetherin activity and lost the second
major function of Vpu, i.e. degradation of CD4, during
adaptation to humans [17,21]. The recent description of
a fourth group of HIV-1, designated “P”, that most likely
represents an independent cross-species transmission of
SIVgor infecting gorillas to humans [22,23], allowed us
to further investigate a possible role of effective tetherin
antagonism in the spread of the different groups of
HIV-1. In the present study, we thus determined
whether or not HIV-1 Group P has cleared the tetherin
barrier in humans.
To assess whether the transmission event that resulted
in HIV-1 Group P also occurred relatively recently, as

previously described for Group M, O and N viruses
[27-29], we first performed extensive phylogenetic analyses. Our results suggest that Group P entered the human
population between 1845 and 1989. This window is rather
wide due to the fact that only two HIV-1 Group P strains
have been described to date [22,23] and could be further
narrowed once additional Group P or SIVgor sequences
become available. It is also noteworthy that the possibility
that the Group P zoonosis did not result from a gorilla,
but from a yet-to-be-identified chimpanzee population can
currently not be entirely dismissed [22].
In spite of the aforementioned limitations, our analyses
suggest that the transmission of SIVgor that gave rise to
HIV-1 Group P occurred within the last 170 years and is

Sauter et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:103
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/103

thus similar to three zoonotic transmission events that
led to the emergence of HIV-1 Groups M, O and N
[27-29]. Our functional analyses demonstrate that the
vpu and nef genes of both HIV-1 Group P strains are
unable to antagonize human tetherin. These results are
in agreement with a recent study reporting lack of antitetherin activity of Group P Vpu and Nef proteins [38],
published while this manuscript was under revision. Our
analyses significantly expand these findings because only
the RBF168 strain was examined in the previous study,
whereas we also examined the Vpu and Nef proteins of
the second HIV-1 Group P 06CMU14788 strain. Perhaps
even more importantly, we also show that the Env proteins of both HIV-1 Group P strains do not antagonize
tetherin, although they are otherwise active and capable
of mediating HIV-1 entry. These results strongly suggest
that HIV-1 Group P has not yet evolved an effective
antagonist of human tetherin. A recent origin and suboptimal adaptation to the new human host is further supported by the fact that only one of the two HIV-1 Group
P strains (06CMU14788) has evolved a human-specific
change of M30K in the viral p17 matrix protein that is
present in all other groups of HIV-1 and seems to be
relevant for the replicative fitness of HIV-1 in the human
host [39].
We found that the HIV-1 Group P Nef was unable to
promote virion release although it reduced the levels of
cell surface expression of the gorilla tetherin orthologue
by up to 2-fold. This result is in agreement with recent
data on Vpu function showing that promotion of virus
release and downmodulation of tetherin from the cell surface do not always correlate [35,36]. A possible reason for
this is that effective tetherin antagonism by Vpu and/or
Nef may involve several distinct but cooperative mechanisms [16,40]. For Vpu, it has been reported that it interacts
directly with the transmembrane domain of tetherin,
sequesters the restriction factor away from the sites of
viral budding to the trans-Golgi network and the perinuclear compartment and induces its proteasomal and/or
lysosomal degradation [41-43]. The mechanism of Nefmediated tetherin antagonism is poorly investigated and
may involve AP-2 dependent removal of tetherin from the
sites of virion assembly [44]. It is tempting to speculate
that some Vpu and Nef proteins may be able to downmodulate tetherin from the cell surface and/or to increase
its degradation but lack the capability to sequester tetherin
away from the sites of virion budding and are thus unable
to efficiently promote the release of progeny virions.

Conclusions
In conclusion, our data further support that effective
tetherin antagonism may play a role in the effective
spread of HIV/AIDS. However, further studies using
replication-competent full-length molecular clones of

Page 7 of 9

HIV-1 Group O, N and P strains are required to exclude
the possibility that they may counteract the tetherin
restriction through an as yet unknown mechanism. It is
evident that HIV-1 Groups O and N can cause AIDS
[45,46], whereas the pathogenic potential of Group P
remains to be determined. Furthermore, it remains elusive whether the viral loads, rates of CD4 T cell decline
and clinical progression, or the efficiency of virion shedding into genital fluids, differ between individuals
infected with pandemic HIV-1 Group M and non-pandemic Group O or rare Group N and P strains. In-depth
studies of the virological, immunological and clinical
characteristics of Group O, N and P infections in humans
may provide important insights into virus transmission
and seem highly warranted.

Methods
Dating the most recent common ancestor of HIV-1 Group
P and SIVgor

Full-length genome sequences representative of HIV-1
and related SIV strains were retrieved from Genbank,
together with the corresponding sampling dates. The dataset included four SIVcpz sequences from Pan troglodytes
schweinfurthii (GenBank accession numbers: :AF447763;
EF394357; EF394358; U42720), ten SIVcpz sequences
from Pan troglodytes troglodytes (AF103818; AF115393;
AJ271369; AY169968; DQ373063; DQ373064; DQ373065;
DQ373066; EF535994; X52154), four SIVgor sequences
from Gorilla gorilla gorilla (FJ424863; FJ424864; FJ424865;
FJ424871); eight reference HIV-1 Group M sequences
from subtype A (AB253429), subtype B (K03455), subtype
C (U46016), subtype D (K03454), subtype F (AJ249238),
subtype H (AF190127), subtype J (AF082394) and subtype
K (AJ249235); four HIV-1 Group N sequences (AJ006022;
AJ271370; AY532635; DQ017383); four HIV-1 Group O
sequences (AJ302647; AY169812; L20571; L20587); two
HIV-1 Group P sequences available to date (GQ328744;
HQ179987). A multiple nucleotide sequence alignment
was created using the program MUSCLE version 3.6
http://www.drive5.com/muscle/download3.6.html, and
manually edited with the program Se-Al http://tree.bio.ed.
ac.uk/software/seal/. Regions of the alignment that could
not be unambiguously aligned where excluded from the
analysis. Dated phylogenies and time estimates were initially obtained for the gag, pol and env loci under various
evolutionary and demographic assumptions.
The full-length, gag, pol, and env sequence alignments
were used to reconstruct the phylogenies of the selected
viruses using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) framework. A posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees was obtained for each alignment using the software MrBayes version 3.1.2 http://mrbayes.csit.fsu.edu/
download.php, under the General Time Reversible model
of nucleotide substitution with proportion of invariable

Sauter et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:103
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/103

sites and gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity
(GTR+I+Γ). The MCMC search was set to 10,000,000
iterations, with trees sampled every 1000th generation.
Convergence of the estimates was checked using the program Tracer (i.e. effective sampling size > 200). A model
incorporating the SRD model for nucleotide substitution,
where the evolution of 3rd codon positions is modeled
independently to 1st and 2nd codon positions, a relaxed
molecular clock model [47] and a Bayesian Skyline coalescent prior [48] fitted the data significantly better than
alternative models (Bayes factor > 20).
Cloning and viral constructs

RBF168 and 06CMU14788 Vpu (accession nos:
GQ328744 and HQ179987) and Nef (accession nos:
GQ328744 and HQ179987) were synthesized by Genscript, C-terminally tagged with an AU1-tag and cloned
into the pCGCG vector coexpressing eGFP via an IRES
[17]. RBF168 and 06CMU14788 Envelopes were also
synthesized by Genscript and cloned into the pCAGGS
vector as previously described [11]. Human and gorilla
tetherin were cloned into the pCGCG vector coexpressing
DsRed2. All experiments were performed in transfected
293T that overexpress tetherin, GFP and Nef, Vpu or Env
after transfection with the CMV- or chicken b-actin promoter based pCGCG or pCAGGS expression constructs.
These plasmids have been previously described [17,32,49].
CD4 cell surface staining and flow cytometry

293T cells were cotransfected with human CD4 (0.5 μg)
and different vpu, nef or env alleles (2.5 μg) or GFP only.
48 h hours post transfection CD4 surface expression was
measured by flow cytometry as previously described
[17,32].
Viral release assay, p24 ELISA, and Western blotting

293T cells were cotransfected with pBR-NL43 ΔnefΔvpu
(2.0 μg), different amounts of tetherin (0-125 ng) and different vpu or nef alleles (0.5 μg). 48 hours post infection
virus release was determined by infection of TZM-bl reporter cells. Values were normalized (no tetherin = 100%) [17].
p24 ELISA and Western blot were carried out as previously
described [17,32]. For the verification of activity of P Group
Env a pBR-NL43 ΔnefΔvpuΔenv expression vector was
used. TZM-bl reporter cells were used to analyze infectivity
of HIV-1 Group P Env pseudotyped virions (NIH AIDS
Research and Reference Reagent Program).

Additional file 2: Tetherin Counteraction by HIV-1 Group P Vpu and
Nef. (A) Infectious virus and (B) p24 release from 293T cells following
cotransfection with a vpu- and nef-defective proviral HIV-1 NL4-3
construct, pCGCG plasmids expressing eGFP alone (eGFP only) or
together with the indicated vpu or nef alleles and a human or gorilla
tetherin expression plasmid. Infectious virus was determined by infection
of TZM-bl reporter cells and p24 release was quantified by ELISA. Values
are shown as percentage of values obtained in the absence of tetherin.
All infections were performed in triplicates. The mean of two
independent experiments is shown.
