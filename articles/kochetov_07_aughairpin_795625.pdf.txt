Abstract
Background: The translation start site plays an important role in the control of translation
efficiency of eukaryotic mRNAs. The recognition of the start AUG codon by eukaryotic ribosomes
is considered to depend on its nucleotide context. However, the fraction of eukaryotic mRNAs
with the start codon in a suboptimal context is relatively large. It may be expected that mRNA
should possess some features providing efficient translation, including the proper recognition of a
translation start site. It has been experimentally shown that a downstream hairpin located in certain
positions with respect to start codon can compensate in part for the suboptimal AUG context and
also increases translation from non-AUG initiation codons. Prediction of such a compensatory
hairpin may be useful in the evaluation of eukaryotic mRNA translation properties.
Results: We evaluated interdependency between the start codon context and mRNA secondary
structure at the CDS beginning: it was found that a suboptimal start codon context significantly
correlated with higher base pairing probabilities at positions 13 – 17 of CDS of human and mouse
mRNAs. It is likely that the downstream hairpins are used to enhance translation of some
mammalian mRNAs in vivo. Thus, we have developed a tool, AUG_hairpin, to predict local stem-loop
structures located within the defined region at the beginning of mRNA coding part. The
implemented algorithm is based on the available published experimental data on the CDS-located
stem-loop structures influencing the recognition of upstream start codons.
Conclusion: An occurrence of a potential secondary structure downstream of start AUG codon
in a suboptimal context (or downstream of a potential non-AUG start codon) may provide
researchers with a testable assumption on the presence of additional regulatory signal influencing
mRNA translation initiation rate and the start codon choice. AUG_hairpin, which has a convenient
Web-interface with adjustable parameters, will make such an evaluation easy and efficient.

Background
Translation of most eukaryotic mRNAs is likely to be ini-

tiated by a linear scanning mechanism [1], although some
alternative mechanisms are also possible [2,3]. According

Page 1 of 7

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:318

to the scanning model, 40S ribosomal subunits can either
initiate translation at the 5'-proximal AUG codon in a
suboptimal context or miss it and initiate translation at
downstream AUG(s). For mammalian mRNAs, the most
important elements of AUG context are the adenine at
position -3 and guanine at position +4 [1,4]. One might
expect that mRNA should possess some features providing
efficient translation, including the recognition of a genuine translation start site (TSS). However, the fraction of
eukaryotic mRNAs with the start AUG codon in a suboptimal context is relatively large [5,6]. It is likely that at least
some mRNAs with a suboptimal context of annotated
start codon contain other signals providing additional
information for efficient TSS recognition (e.g., [7]).
It has been reported earlier that stable hairpins located in
certain positions downstream of AUG codon in a suboptimal context can increase translation initiation efficiency
[8]. The hairpin was placed at the distances of 5, 11, 17,
and 35 nucleotides downstream of the CDS beginning,
and start codon recognition efficiencies were evaluated in
in vitro experiment (Fig. 1). It was reported that the hairpin located at the distance of either 5 or 35 nucleotides
did not increase the AUG recognition. However, the hairpin located at the distance of 17 or (to lesser extent) 11
nucleotides enhanced translation initiation considerably
in a sequence-independent manner. It was hypothesized
[8] that stable hairpins could temporarily stop the movement of 40S ribosomal subunits until the disruption of
the secondary structure. The hairpin located at certain critical distance(s) with respect to start codon (at 17th nucleotide in the experiment) could delay the 40S ribosomal
subunit just in the position providing an efficient interaction between the met-tRNAi-located anticodon and the
start AUG codon. It was also shown that such a downstream hairpin could increase translation from non-AUG
start codons located in the optimal context [8,9].
This hypothetical mechanism has not been fully verified
by in vivo experiments yet. However, it was often suggested
that such secondary structures can be used to modulate
translation efficiency of certain viral and cellular mRNAs
with a suboptimal context of start AUG codons [10-14] or
with a non-AUG start codons [15-17]. For example, the
efficiency of TSS in a suboptimal context in Dengue virus
mRNA is increased by a hairpin of moderate stability
located 17 nucleotides downstream. The hairpin effect on
the TSS recognition depended on its stability and position
with respect to AUG [14]. It was also recently found that
the stable hairpin located downstream of start AUG codon
in Sindbis virus subgenomic 26S RNA provides efficient
translation even though eIF2alpha is phosphorylated and
translation of most cellular mRNAs is blocked [18]. The
authors hypothesized that the hairpin can stall the ribosomes on the correct site to initiate translation, thus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/318

bypassing the requirement for a functional eIF2 and,
thereby, specifically supporting translation of certain viral
and (probably) cellular mRNAs. Notably, this function of
a downstream hairpin is related to a general cellular translation control rather than a compensation of the "weakness" of the upstream start codon context. Thus, the
information on the presence of potential compensatory
hairpins may be useful for further experimental investigation of both general and specific mRNA translational
properties.
Here, we describe the computational tool (AUG_hairpin)
targeted at the prediction of secondary structure elements
possibly compensating for suboptimal context of translational start codon. We also analyzed the structural features
of human and mouse mRNAs and found significant correlation between the base pairing probabilities in positions 13–17 of CDS and the TSS context. This relationship
supports the hypothesis on the functional significance of
precisely located downstream hairpins for the TSS recognition in some cellular mRNAs.

Implementation
According to the experimental data, the hairpins started
either upstream or downstream of certain "critical" region
of CDS did not compensate for the "weak" AUG context.
In particular, continuous secondary structure started at 5th
nucleotide of coding sequence did not increase translation initiation efficiency despite it included the critical
12th and 18th positions (Fig. 1; [8]). Based on this observation, AUG_hairpin predicts the stem-loop structures, in
which 5'-borders are located within the critical region
(from 12th to 18th nucleotides by default). An appropriate
stem-loop structure can also be a part of a more complex
secondary structure started upstream of the critical region.
We hypothesized that the 40S ribosomal subunit moving
from the 5'-end of mRNA can pause consequently on each
stable stem of a complex stem-loop structure waiting for
its melting. In this case we assumed that an eligible hairpin has to be separated from upstream secondary structure elements by some impaired segment (e.g., loop) (for
detailed description, see tutorial at the program wwwsites).
5'-UTR and CDS nucleotide sequences have to be entered
separately to the program through www-page (this provides the program with information on the start codon
position). AUG_hairpin analyzes the mRNA segment compiled from 10 nucleotides long 5'-UTR portion located
immediately upstream of the start AUG codon and 100 5'proximal nucleotides of CDS. Algorithm consists of the
following main steps: (1) Prediction of RNA optimal secondary structure for 5'UTR-CDS fragment. For this purpose the program foldRNA from Vienna RNA package
v.1.4 [19] was implemented as subroutine. (2) Checking

Unix environment.
It is likely that a downstream hairpin can increase translation even located outside the critical region defined by
Kozak ([8]; from 12th to 18th nucleotides of CDS)
although at a lower efficiency. It was experimentally
found that the hairpin could influence translation even
located at pos. 30 [10] or at pos. 27 of CDS [18]. Taking
into account that the hairpin located at CDS position 35
did not increase an upstream AUG recognition in in vitro
experiment [8], we limited the AUG_hairpin prediction
interval by 30th nucleotide of CDS. We analyzed two
mRNA nucleotide sequences with annotated non-AUG
translation start site taking them as examples. CDS of Agamous mRNA (Arabidopsis thaliana) starts from ACG codon
[15] and CDS of NsRpoT-C mRNA (Nicotiana sylvestris)
starts from CUG codon [20]. According to the
AUG_hairpin prediction, there are stable hairpins located
downstream of start codons in these mRNAs (Agamous: at
pos. 30, E = -19.9 kcal/mol, Fig. 2; NsRpoT-C: at pos. 22, E
= -12.7 kcal/mol, Fig. 3).

Results and discussion
It was assumed that stable hairpins precisely located
downstream of translation start sites (AUG or non-AUG)
enhance translation initiation rate of some viral and cellular mRNAs [10-17]. Computational analysis of yeast
mRNAs demonstrated the interrelationship between the
base pairing probabilities at pos. 14–17 of CDS and the
start codon context: mRNAs with a suboptimal TSS context were characterized by a more frequent presence of secondary structure at these positions [21]. In this work we
tested the interdependency between the base pairing
probabilities in the 5'-terminal CDS segment and start
codon context in mammalian mRNAs. For this purpose
human and mouse cDNA samples characterized by complete CDS and 5'-UTR size larger than 29 nucleotides were
extracted from GenBank. The subsamples of cDNAs characterized by either optimal (purine at pos. -3 upstream the
annotated TSS; 18750 human and 7700 mouse cDNAs) or
suboptimal (pyrimidine at pos. -3 upstream the annotated TSS; 3469 human and 1233 mouse cDNAs) start
codon context were used for further comparative analysis.
The mRNA base pairing probabilities (BPP; [22]) were calculated using the Vienna RNA secondary structure package [19]. mRNA segments containing 5'-UTR (limited by
100 nucleotides in size) and the beginning of CDS (100
nucleotide in size; thus, total size of segments varied from
130 to 200 nucleotides depending on the 5'-UTR length)
were used. Positional BPP values were calculated and
compared between the samples of mRNAs with optimal
and suboptimal start codon contexts. The difference in
average BPP values at the CDS positions between these
samples is shown in Table 1. One may see that mRNAs

with a suboptimal TSS context are characterized by significantly higher average BPP values in pos. 13–17. We also
calculated average BPP values at 5'-end CDS positions
(from 6th to 56th nucleotides; average BPP = 0.615112 ±
0.0006 (human mRNAs with a suboptimal TSS context);
0.615775 ± 0.0006 (human mRNAs with optimal TSS
context); 0.613197 ± 0.002 (mouse mRNAs with a suboptimal TSS context); 0.614936 ± 0.0009 (mouse mRNAs
with optimal TSS context)). Thus, mRNAs with a suboptimal start codon context were not characterized by a higher
average BPP value at the CDS beginning.
It may be speculated that this difference results from a
local deviation in G+C content (GC pairs make the major
impact on the secondary structure stability) or from some
codon-dependent periodic pattern [23,24]. However,
average positional differences in G+C frequencies do not
correlate with the difference in BPP values: it is unlikely

that the observed dependency between the TSS context
and base pairing probabilities reflects an unusual G+C
distribution at the CDS beginning rather than the more
frequent representation of the hairpin-containing mRNAs
in a sample with a suboptimal TSS context (Table 1).
These data demonstrate that precisely positioned hairpins
may increase translation efficiency of some mammalian
mRNAs in vivo and that the positions defined by Kozak
([8]; from 13th to 17th nucleotide of CDS) are most frequently (or efficiently) used for this purpose.
AUG_hairpin was used to analyze the stem-loop structures
whose 5'-borders were located between the 6th and 30th
nucleotides of CDS in human and mouse mRNA samples.
Three parameters were taken into account: total energy of
the stem-loop structure (Etot), energy of the stem (Est), and
the stem size (Lst, 5'-proximal perfect stems started within
defined region were taken). It was found that mRNAs with
a suboptimal start codon context were characterized by
significantly more stable secondary structure elements
started in positions 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 (Table 2). According
to these results, the 5'-border of the critical region is also
located at position 13 of CDS. We further selected subsamples of human and mouse mRNAs with stable stemloop structures whose 5'-borders were located between
the 13th and 19th nucleotides of CDS. It was found that
546 human mRNAs (16% of the sample with a suboptimal start codon context) were characterized by the pres-

ence of a stable stem-loop structure (Etot < -20 kcal/mol)
in the defined region. Average energies of eligible stemloop structures (Etot) were -34.9 kcal/mol and -33.2 kcal/
mol for human mRNAs with a suboptimal and the optimal start codon contexts, respectively (the distributions of
Etot values differ significantly according to KolmogorovSmirnov two-sample test, p < 0.01; the difference between
mean Etot values was also significant according to the
Mann-Whitney U-test, p < 0.00005). Similarly, 187
mouse mRNAs with a suboptimal start codon context
were characterized with a highly stable hairpin (Est < -20
kcal/mol) in this region (Etot = -32.9 kcal/mol).
It was reported that a correctly positioned hairpin even of
a moderate stability (-8.2 kcal/mol) enhanced the recognition of upstream AUG codon in a suboptimal context
[14]: thus, it may be assumed that at least some of these
mammalian mRNAs possess higher translation initiation
efficiency due to the presence of "compensatory" hairpins
than it may be expected from the context of annotated
start codon (lists of human and mouse mRNAs with some
additional information on secondary structure characteristics are available as Additional file 1 and Additional file
2, respectively). It should be, however, noted that suboptimal context of start codon is not necessarily compensated by "compensatory hairpin": in many cases, contexts
of translational start sites are likely to be evolutionary

attenuated to decrease translation level of mRNAs encoding regulatory proteins (e.g., [5]).

Conclusion
The presence of a potential secondary structure downstream of start AUG codon in a suboptimal context (or
downstream of a potential non-AUG start codon) can provide researchers with a testable assumption on the additional regulatory element influencing translation
initiation level. AUG_hairpin is based on an elegant
hypothesis supported by the in vitro [8] and in vivo experimental data [10,12-14] as well as the results of computational analysis ([21]; Tables 1 and 2 in this manuscript).

It should be noted that the applied algorithm depends on
the interpretation of available (rather limited) experimental data and the prediction accuracy may also be limited.
Only few hairpin positions were tested in experiments.
Secondary structure elements influencing translation start
site recognition in vivo may have distinct characteristics
(e.g., species-specific or tissue-specific). Currently it is also
not possible to predict the interdependence of hairpin stability and its influence on start codon recognition as well
as the influence of mRNA-protein and mRNA-ribosome
interactions during translation initiation process on the
mRNA secondary structure. Finally, the recognition of
start codons in a suboptimal context can be modulated
through other (currently poorly known) signals [7,25-28],
and the absence of a "compensatory" hairpin does not
necessarily mean that the TSS recognition is inefficient.
However, despite these limitations, AUG_hairpin may be
used to reveal potential "compensatory" hairpins in the
case of discrepancy between the gene expression pattern
and mRNA features (e.g., highly expressed gene is characterized by a suboptimal context of annotated translation
start site, proteomic or phylogenetic data suggest the
usage of non-AUG potential start codons [29], etc.).
