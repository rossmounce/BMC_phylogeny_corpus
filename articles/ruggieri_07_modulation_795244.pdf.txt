Abstract
Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with high percentage of chronicity which
implies the ability of the virus to evade or modulate host cell immune system. Modulation of chemokines,
such as RANTES may be part of the virus induced pathogenicity. We examined the effect of core and
structural proteins of HCV on RANTES expression in two liver derived cell lines, HepG2 and Chang Liver
(CHL).
Methods: HepG2 and Chang Liver (CHL) cell lines were established and selected for constitutive
expression of HCV core and structural genes. Flow cytometry and quantitative RT-PCR analysis were
performed to examine the effect of HCV core protein on RANTES expression. Luciferase analysis after
RANTES-Luc-promoter transfection of established cell lines was assayed by luminometer measurements
(RLU) of RANTES promoter activity. IRF-1 and IRF-7 expression was then examined by immunoblotting
analysis.
Results: Results of flow cytometry and RT-PCR analysis indicated that RANTES is differentially regulated
by HCV core protein in the two cell lines examined as its expression was inhibited in HepG2 cells, by a
reduction of RANTES promoter activity. Conversely, RANTES protein and mRNA were induced by the
core protein in CHL cells, through the induction of the promoter.
Since HCV genome modulates IRF-1 and IRF-7 in replicon system and IRF-1, IRF-3 and IRF-7 have been
reported to regulate RANTES promoter in various cell systems, analysis of the mechanism underlying
RANTES modulation by the core protein revealed that IRF-1 expression was induced in HepG2 cells by
the core protein, whereas in CHL cells it was expressed at a very low level that was not influenced by
transfection with the core protein construct. This suggested that IRF-1 level may mediate the expression
of RANTES in cell lines of liver origin. The effect of the core protein on RANTES promoter was countered
by co-transfection with NF90, a double-stranded-RNA binding protein that activates some interferon
response genes and acts as a component of cell defense against viral infection.
Conclusion: HCV core protein have opposite effects on the expression of RANTES in different cell types
in vitro, possibly reflecting a similar scenario in different microenvironments in vivo.

Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major cause of chronic liver
disease worldwide associated with the development of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), that is the fifth most
common cancer worldwide [1], with increasing incidence
in Europe [2] and the leading cause of death amongst cirrhotic patients [3,4].
One of the main features of HCV infection is the high percentage of chronicity which implies the ability of the virus
to evade or modulate host cell immune system. Initial
inflammatory response to early viral infection is associated to secretion of RANTES, a CC chemokine with chemotactic function which recruits circulating T cells to the
inflammation sites. RANTES has been shown to be
induced by several viral infections in a number of cell
types, including the endothelial cell infection by HCMV
[5]; in liver cells infected by dengue-2 virus [6], and in
influenza A virus infection in monocyte/macrophages [7].
In tumors, a dual role of RANTES has been reported [8]
since it may promote tumor progression, as in melanomas
[9], or the spreading of tumor cells throughout the body,
as in breast cancer [10]; but RANTES may also enhance
immune response against tumors and associate to
improved prognosis as in the case of lung cancer [11].
A possible role for RANTES/CCR5 pathways in the pathogenesis of chronic HCV infection has been suggested from
studies on HCV patients. Polymorphism of RANTES promoter was reported to correlate with outcome of HCV
associated disease [12,13], and individuals homozygous
for deletion mutation of RANTES receptor (CCR5)
showed increased susceptibility to chronic HCV infection
[14]. Lichterfeld and co-workers [15] reported that T cells
from HCV patients had reduced responsiveness to
RANTES. In addition, intra-hepatic expression of RANTES
and Mig is positively related to the severity of hepatic
inflammation [16], and intra-hepatic levels of RANTES
mRNA have been reported to increase in chronic HCV
patients [17]. Modulation of RANTES expression in
response to HCV has been somewhat controversial. In
vitro studies have shown that full length HCV construct
induces RANTES and MCP-1 expression in Huh7 and
HeLa cells. On the other hand, inhibition of RANTES promoter in Huh7 and HepG2 cell lines has also been
reported to be mediated by HCV core protein [18,19].
More recently interaction of HCV E2 protein and CD81
has been suggested to lead to increased RANTES secretion
by CD8 + lymphocytes [15,20].
HCV core protein has been described as a multifunctional
protein that in addition to function in viral nucleocapsid
formation, influences several cellular function, such as
cell growth and death [21-23], immune cells functions
[24,25] and its expression in transgenic mice has been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/7/21

associated to development of steatosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma [26,27]. Induction of chemokines by viral
infection determines the local inflammation response and
may be part of the virus induced pathogenicity. Modulation of chemokines expression by viruses or viral proteins
may contribute to evasion of the innate immune response
in early viral infection, affecting the outcome of infection
and viral persistence.
RANTES activation by viral infection has been reported to
be regulated by synergistic activity between interferon
response factors, IRF-3, IRF-7 and NF-kB in various cell
lines [28] and by IRF-1, which can bind to RANTES promoter in mouse macrophages [29]. Moreover, HCV
genome has been reported to modulate IRF-1 and IRF-7 in
replicon system [30,31].
NF90 belongs to a family of double-stranded-RNA binding proteins [32], which has been reported to regulate replication of the Pestivirus BVDV [33] (phylogenetically
related to the Flavivirus family to which HCV belongs)
and when introduced into osteosarcoma cell line it
induces resistance to HIV replication in cell culture [34]
acting as a component of cell defense against viral infection by activation of some IFN-response genes [34].
We examined the effect of HCV core and structural proteins on the expression of RANTES in human hepatoma
and in a liver derived cell lines (HepG2 and Chang Liver)
expressing different constructs of HCV genome. The
expression of IRF-1 and IRF-7 has been examined to reveal
their possible role in RANTES modulation by the core protein. In addition, we investigated the role of NF90 transfection on the expression of RANTES in order to reveal its
possible immunomodulatory function and its potential
to counteract HCV core protein effect on RANTES.

Methods
Stable transfectants and expression constructs
Stable transfectants in HepG2 cell lines expressing core
and HCV structural proteins have been described by
Harada et al., 1995 [35]. Stable transfectants of Chang
Liver (CHL) cell lines expressing HCV core (CH39) or
core-E1-E2-NS2-NS3 (CH352) were established by stable
transfection of Chang Liver cells with pCAG39neo,
pCAG352neo expression vectors respectively, that
expressed HCV structural and non-structural proteins
under the control of mammalian CAG promoter. Clonal
selection of liver cell transfectants was performed in the
presence of 1 mg/ml of G418 antibiotic. Expression levels
of HCV proteins were monitored by Western blotting.
Positive clones were cultured and maintained under G418
selection; however experiments were performed in G418free medium to avoid the possible influence of the antibiotic on functions under study as well as to maintain

homologous conditions with the parental and control cell
lines. Experimental control cell lines, Hepswx and CHwt
were transfected with the empty vectors, pcEF321swxneo,
described elsewhere by Harada et al. [35] and pcCAGswxneo. This latter plasmid obtained by inserting the CAG
promoter cassette in pEF321neo vector linearized by
Asp718 digestion; is a derivative of pCAGGS [36], containing the unique Swa I cloning site.
The pCI-NF90 construct (courtesy of Prof. Kumar A,
George Washington University) containing the NF90
sequence under the control of CMV promoter has been
described [34]. Transfection of the established HepG2
and CHL cell lines with pCI-NF90 was performed by using
Fugene 6 (Roche) according to manufacturer's instructions and with Fugene 6/plasmid DNA ratio of 3:1.
Immunofluorescence and FACS analysis
Detection and quantitation of RANTES protein expression
in parental and transfected cell lines was performed by
intracellular immunofluorescence and FACS analysis.
Briefly, sub-confluent cultures were detached with
trypsin-EDTA solution and washed in PBS. After fixation
for 20 minutes at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde and washing with permeabilization solution (Perm/
Wash Buffer, Becton Dickinson), 106 cells were suspended
in 0.5 μg of mouse anti-human RANTES phycoerythrinconjugated monoclonal antibody in Perm/Wash Buffer
and were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature.
After washing in Perm/Wash Buffer cells were analysed by
FACScalibur flow cytometer using CellQuest software. A
minimum of 10,000 events were analysed for each sample.
RNA isolation and semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis
To detect RANTES mRNA, total RNA was extracted from
cultured cell lines by RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to
manufacturer's instructions. 500 ng of total RNA was
reverse transcribed using random hexanucleotides and 10
U of transcriptor™ reverse transcriptase (Roche) according
to manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications
and with the addition of recombinant RNAsin ribonuclease inhibitor. The PCR amplification of the reverse transcribed RNA was carried out with 1.5 unit of Taq DNA
polimerase (ABI Prism) in 50 μl reaction mixture containing 200 μM of each dNTPs, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 μM of specific primers and 1× reaction buffer. Primers used for
RANTES mRNA amplification in HepG2 cell lines were 5'GCTGTCATCCTCATTGCTAC-3' (sense) and 5'-TCCATCCTAGCTCATCTCCA-3' (antisense), which yield a specific
260 (237) bp product; cycling conditions for HepG2
transfected cell lines were 94°C, 5 minutes, 56°C, 90 seconds and 72°C, 120 seconds, followed by 28 cycles at
94°C, 30 seconds, 56°C for 90 seconds and at 72°C for
120 seconds. Primers used to amplify RANTES from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/7/21

Chang Liver cell lines were: 5'-ACGCCTCGTGTCATCCTCATT-3' (sense) and 5'-ACTCTCCATCCTAGCTCATCTC3' (antisense), which amplify a (226) bp product. PCR
conditions were same as those described for HepG2
except MgCl2 concentration reduced to 1.5 mM and primers concentration to 0.1 μM. Cycling conditions were
modified as follows: 94°C 4 minutes, 94°C 1 minute,
55°C 1 minute, 72°C 1 minute, for 40 cycles followed by
72°C 8 minutes. β-actin amplification in parallel samples
was performed as controls by using following primers: 5'ATCTGGCACCACACTTCTACA-3' (sense) and 5'-GTTTCGTGGATGCCAACAGGACT-3' (antisense) (550 bp
product). Cycling conditions for β-actin were 94°C 4 minutes, 94°C 1 minute, 50°C 1 minute, 72°C 1 minute, followed by elongation at 72°C 8 minutes. In each
experiment, possible DNA contamination was determined by a control reaction in which reverse transcriptase
was omitted from the reaction mixture. For semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of RANTES, serial dilution of the
cDNA samples was used. Amplified PCR fragments were
analysed by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel.
Real-Time quantitative PCR analysis
Real-Time quantitative PCR assessment of RANTES gene
expression in Hep39 cell lines was performed using the
ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detector system (Applied Biosystem). 800 nanograms (ng) of total RNA were in vitro
reverse transcribed as described above for RT-PCR analysis. A portion of the resulting cDNA corresponding to 80
ng of in vitro transcribed RNA was subjected to Real-Time
quantitative PCR that was performed in triplicate using
TaqMan chemistry with primers and probe sets from the
Assay-on-Demand list (Applied Biosystem). The standard
curve of the target RANTES gene was compared to the
standard curve of β-microglobulin gene used as endogenous control reference; calculation of the slope of the log
(ng RNA) vs ΔCt was always <0.1. Fold reduction was then
calculated by the ΔΔCt method after normalization of the
mRNA level to the values of β-microglobulin.
Transient transfection and luciferase reporter assay
2.5 μg of human RANTES reporter construct, pRANTESLuc, (courtesy of Dr. Michael Gale), was transiently transfected by Fugene6 (Roche) in HepG2 and Chang Liver cell
lines constitutively expressing HCV core protein, as well as
in parental and the empty vector transfected control cells.
To examine the effect of NF90 on RANTES activity 2.5 μg
of the pCI-NF90 plasmid DNA was co-transfected with
pRANTES-Luc into the liver cell lines. As transfection control, pSV β-galactosidase vector (1.0 μg) was co-transfected into the cells to monitor transfection efficiency. 48
h post-transfection, cell lysate was prepared and luciferase
quantifications were performed using commercial reagents (Promega) and measuring in a Lumat LB 9501
Berthold Luminometer. Results are expressed as relative

light units (RLU), calculated as the ratio of luciferase to βgalactosidase activities within each sample.

Results
Effect of HCV core protein on RANTES protein
Considering the important role of chemokine signaling in
regulating physiological events associated with chronic
HCV infection, the effect of HCV core protein on RANTES
expression was evaluated by quantitative immunofluorescence and flow cytometry in the two liver derived cell
lines, HepG2 and Chang Liver, constitutively expressing
HCV core protein. Results shown in Figures 1A and 1B
indicated a twofold decrease in fractions of cells expressing RANTES protein for cells transfected with HCV core
protein, as indicated by comparing percentage of positive
HepG2 cell line controls (93.77% ± 0.8%) or the cells
transfected with the empty vector (65.63% ± 1.1% in Hepswx) with the HCV core protein expressing cells (45% ±
2.6% in Hep39). Reduction in RANTES expression was
detected also in Hepswx cells as compared to the parental
cell line, suggesting a possible contribution of constitutive
transfection on RANTES level. However the differences in
percentage of cells positive for RANTES expression in
Hep39 as compared to Hepswx cell lines was statistically
significant (p < 005). However in Hep352 cell line
(expressing core-E1-E2-NS3 proteins) percentage of
RANTES positive cells (78,5 ± 1.5%) was close to that in
control cell lines. In contrast, flow cytometry quantitation

SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis of IRF-1 and IRF-7
Total proteins (50 μg) were diluted in 2× sample buffer,
separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF
membranes. After incubation in blocking buffer containing 5% milk, membranes were incubated overnight at
4°C with specific polyclonal antibodies anti-IRF-1 or IRF7 (Santa Cruz). The membranes were subsequently incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgGs and immunodetection was realized by ECL (Pierce) followed by
autoradiography.
Statistical analysis
The Student's t test and Fisher's exact test were used for
comparison of the difference in RANTES expression
between Hep39 and CH39 and their relative controls
Hepswx and CHWT as well as to compare the luciferase
activity of RANTES promoter in the two cell lines expressing HCV core protein. Differences were considered significant when p values were <0.05. Statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS software (SPSS Inc).

of RANTES protein in CH39 cell lines showed (Figures 2A
and 2B) a statistically significant 2.5 fold increase in percentage of cells positive for RANTES expression, as compared with the CHWT control cells (16.6% ± 2.9% vs.
6.7% ± 1.2%, p < 0.05). In CH352 cell lines the fraction
of RANTES positive cells (7.5% ± 0.7%) was similar to the
controls. This latter result and that from Hep352 cells suggest a possible role of HCV structural E1 and E2 proteins
or non-structural proteins NS2-NS3 in counteracting the
effect of the core protein in RANTES induction. The results
described above suggest that the effect of HCV core protein on the expression of RANTES may be regulated differently in liver cells derived from transformed hepatocytes
and the non-transformed fibroblast cell lines.
Analysis of HCV on RANTES mRNA
We analysed RANTES mRNA expression in the liver cell
lines by RT-PCR using specific primers. Results showed
(Figures 3 and 4) expected size band of RANTES cDNA,
257 and 268 bp respectively in HepG2 and in Chang Liver
cell lines. Using similar quantity of cDNA (500 ng) for
each sample from PCR amplification we made serial dilutions of RANTES cDNA to demonstrate that RANTES transcripts levels were decreased in Hep39 cell lines compared
to the controls (Hepswx and HepG2) (Figure 3(A) upper
panel). In order to corroborate these results, Real-Time
quantitative PCR analysis was performed to determine rel-

ative RANTES mRNA levels in Hepswx and Hep39 cell
lines. Results shown in Fig 3(B) indicated that in Hep39
cell lines RANTES mRNA level was 50% less than in Hepswx cell lines. Conversely, RANTES transcripts levels were
increased by fourfold in CH39 cell lines, expressing HCV
core protein (Figure 4), as compared to the control
CHWT, and up to eightfold compared to parental CHL
cells (Figure 4, upper panel). These results are consistent
with the data presented above which examined the effect
of core on RANTES protein expression, and suggest that
HCV core protein affects RANTES chemokine expression
in liver cell lines differentially.
Effect of HCV core protein on RANTES promoter
We asked whether the modulation in RANTES expression
by HCV core protein could be regulated at the transcriptional level. We carried out transient co-transfections with
RANTES promoter-luciferase plasmid DNA in HepG2 and
Chang Liver cell lines constitutively expressing core and
core-E1-E2-NS2-NS3 proteins of HCV. Inhibition of
RANTES promoter activity (Figure 5A) was observed in
two different clones of Hep39 cells, with fourfold reduction (in RLU values) detected in Hep39 cells as compared

CHWT and CH39 cell lines; CTR+ is IRF-7 positive control
cell lysate.

CH352 the promoter of RANTES was not induced as in
CH39, suggesting that the E1-E2 structural proteins or
non-structural proteins NS2-NS3 may counteract the
effect of the core protein on RANTES promoter activity.
These results are consistent with the effect of HCV core
protein on RANTES mRNA levels and suggest that the core
protein regulates RANTES expression by influencing its
promoter activity.
IRF-1 and IRF-7 expression in HepG2 and Chang liver cell
lines
It has been reported that interferon response factors (IRF1, -3, -7) influence RANTES promoter activity and
RANTES expression in different cell lines [28,37]. We
examined IRF-1 and -7 expression in the two liver cell
lines (HepG2 and CHL) in order to correlate differential
expression of the IRFs with the differences in RANTES
induction between HepG2 and Chang Liver cells mediated by HCV core protein. The results of immunoblotting
analysis (Figure 6) indicate that IRF-7 was equally
expressed in either Hepswx and parental CHL cell lines
(Figure 6, lower panel, lanes 1 and 3, respectively) and
IRF-7 expression and phosphorylation were unaffected by
the HCV core protein in the two cell lines under study,
since no differences in the pattern of IRF-7 bands were
detected in Hep39 or in CH39 cell transfectants (Figure 6
lower panel, lanes 2 and 4, respectively). With regard to
IRF-1 expression, results of immunoblotting analysis indicated increased IRF-1 level in Hep39 cell lines (Figure 6,
upper panel, lane 3); in contrast, IRF-1 was barely detectable in Chang Liver cell transfectants (Figure 6, lanes 5–7).

Discussion
These results suggest that stable expression of HCV core
protein induces IRF-1 expression in human hepatoblastoma cell line. Differential basal expression of IRF-1
between HepG2 and Chang Liver cell could be, at least in
part, responsible for differential modulation of RANTES.
Since NF90 is known to induce the transcriptional program of IFN response genes which is partly responsible for
its interference with virus replication, we sought to examine whether the expression of NF90 affected the modulation of RANTES promoter in HCV core protein expressing
cell lines as part of the anti-viral effect of NF90. The results
in Chang Liver cells showed that NF90 countered the
RANTES promoter activation mediated by the core protein, either in CH39 (1.5 times reduction as compared to
NF90 controls, Figure 7), or in CH352 cells (the NF90mediated inhibition was about 7 folds, Figure 7, right
panel). In HepG2 cells or in Hepswx cell lines, the effect
of NF90 on RANTES promoter was irrelevant (Figure 8).
In Hep39 cells however, co-transfection with NF90
increased RANTES-promoter luciferase activity by twofold
(Figure 8, right panel). The differences observed were statistically significant according to the t Test's (p < 0.05).
The results suggest that NF90 expression could reverse the
effect of HCV core protein on RANTES promoter either in
HepG2 or in Chang Liver cell lines.

Results described in this study indicate that HCV core protein can either induce or inhibit RANTES chemokine
expression in cell lines, depending on the cell type, arguing that RANTES promoter activity may be differentially
regulated based on the availability of cell type specific
transcription factors. Recruitment of virus-specific T cells
to the liver is a critical step for HCV clearance. Chemokines such as RANTES, play a pivotal role in this process
since they mediate lymphocytes migration. In addition, it
has been reported [18], that RANTES/CCR5 expression is
important in regulating relevant pathological events in
the course of chronic hepatitis C infection; as well, intrahepatic expression of RANTES is positively related to the
severity of hepatic inflammation in chronic hepatitis C.
These results highlighted the significant role of this chemokine in HCV-induced liver disease. Consistent with
recently reported observation [18], we found that HCV
core protein variously modulated RANTES expression, by
inducing its promoter. As discussed in the present study,
opposite effects of HCV core protein on RANTES expression correlates with the different origin of the cell lines.
HepG2 which is a human hepatoblastoma cell line with
biochemical properties similar to hepatocytes, and Chang
Liver cells are non-transformed human fibroblasts of liver
origin. Immunohistochemical studies in vivo have indicated that RANTES and IP-10 chemokines are expressed in

hepatocytes and that RANTES secretion increased in
chronic hepatitis with a positive correlation to histological index of HCV related liver disease [16]. Similar to
other cancers (ovary and colorectal tumors) chemokines,
which contribute to lymphocyte recruitment at tumor
sites and to immune-mediated attack [38] have been
reported to be secreted by hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) as well. Interestingly, it has been reported that a
mammary murine carcinoma cell line expressing low levels of RANTES showed a decreased growth rate in vivo [8].
The reported evidences so far have pointed to a possible
dual role of tumor-derived RANTES in tumor growth suggesting that inhibition of chemokine secretion by tumors
could be a mechanism to evade immune attack. HepG2
cell line, a human hepatoblastoma cell line with hepatocytes characteristics, has been extensively investigated for
the mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis; with regard to
RANTES secretion HepG2 cell line behaves as tumor cells,
whereas Chang Liver cells, a fibroblast-like cell line that is
immortalized but without tumor phenotype, behave as
non tumor cells with regard to the RANTES expression.
The regulation of RANTES promoter by HCV proteins in
these two liver cell types most likely reflects the available
levels of the required transcription factors in these cell
lines. The difference in the effects of HCV proteins on
RANTES promoter is not due to their cellular localization,
since the core protein is expressed in the cytoplasm of
both HepG2 and the Chang Liver cells (data not shown).
Since both the Hep39 and CH39 cell lines we utilized in
the present study express full length (p21) HCV core protein, our data exclude the possibility that a truncated form
of HCV core protein, which could migrate to the nucleus
and affect NFk-B pathway (known to regulate expression
of RANTES), could have influenced the results.
The effects of HCV envelope proteins on RANTES secretion are multifaceted. Recently, Soo et al. demonstrated
that the intracellular co-expression of structural proteins
E1-E2 suppress the HCV core-mediated activation of
RANTES promoter reporter constructs in HeLa cells [18].
In contrast, extracellular binding of HCV E2 to CD81 has
been shown to increase RANTES secretion [20]. We found,
that co-expression of the core protein with E1-E2 and
non-structural NS2-NS3 proteins of HCV counteracts the
effect of HCV core expressed alone with respect to
RANTES expression in both cellular systems. Thus, in line
with Soo and colleagues, our results suggest that E1-E2
proteins counteract the effect of HCV core protein on
RANTES expression, possibly by direct interaction of E1E2 with the core protein in the cytoplasm. However, the
role of the non-strucutral proteins NS2 and NS3 remains
to be clarified in this context.
Expression of RANTES promoter has been reported to be
regulated by IRF-3 and -7 cooperatively with NF-kB in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/7/21

U937 and in human kidney 293 cell lines as well as, in
mouse macrophages, by IRF-1 which can bind to RANTES
promoter [28,37]. The HCV core protein expression in
Huh7 and HeLa cell lines is able to induce IRF-1 mRNA
but it does not influence IRF-3 expression and phosphorylation [[29], personal unpublished observations]. Consistent with the data from Miller and co-workers [29] we
found that HCV core protein induces expression of IRF-1
in human hepatoblastoma cell lines (HepG2), but not in
human fibroblast of liver origin (CHL, where IRF-1 is
slightly expressed in parental cells). We suggest that the
available level and different basal expression of IRF-1
between HepG2 and CHL cell lines could explain, at least
in part, the opposite effect of HCV core protein on
RANTES induction in the two cell lines examined.
NF90ctv is a nuclear transcription factor belonging to
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding proteins [33],
which is involved in the life cycle of bovine diarrhea virus
(BVDV) [33] and can activate interferon response genes
and inhibit HIV-1 replication [34]. Interestingly, results
obtained from present study indicated that NF90 protein
has the ability to counter the effect of HCV core protein
mediated RANTES expression in both cell types examined,
suggesting its ability to counter virus mediated effect on
host cell antiviral response. The mechanisms underlying
its role are under investigation.

Conclusion
HCV core protein have opposite effects on the expression
of RANTES in different cell types in vitro, possibly reflecting a similar scenario in different microenvironments in
vivo.
Based on the data presented here we speculate that cell
type specific factors play a fundamental role in RANTES
expression. It is conceivable that core protein, which is
expressed early in HCV infection in vivo and whose expression is maintained during chronic phase and in HCC cells,
may have the opposite effects, influencing T cell trafficking in the liver through either the inhibition/induction of
RANTES. Our data suggest a role, that needs to be confirmed in vivo for viral (HCV) proteins in contributing to
immune evasion by tumor cells.
