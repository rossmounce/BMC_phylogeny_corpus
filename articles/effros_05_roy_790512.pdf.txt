Abstract
Roy Walford died on April 27, 2004, at the age of 79. His contributions to gerontological research
in such diverse areas as caloric restriction, genetics of lifespan, immunosenescence, DNA repair
and replicative senescence were truly remarkable in their depth and innovation. Significantly, most
of the areas that he pioneered during his illustrious research career remain the "hot" areas of
current gerontological research. In this sense, he has achieved the most important type of
immortality. His death was a major personal and professional loss to numerous scientists within
the gerontological community. In launching this new journal on Immunity and Ageing, it is highly
fitting, therefore, to remember him on the anniversary of his death by briefly reviewing the
contributions of Roy Walford to this important facet of gerontology. Indeed, it was Roy who
actually first coined the commonly used term "immunosenescence".

Introduction
Dr. Roy Walford, M.D. Professor Emeritus of Pathology
and Laboratory Medicine at UCLA, died on April 27, 2004
after a long battle with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. He
joined UCLA's faculty in 1954 and became Professor of
Pathology in 1966. He is widely regarded as a pioneer in
the study of the biology of aging. He and his colleagues
have made major contributions to several areas of experimental gerontology including caloric restriction, immunological aging and the role of body temperature
reduction in aging retardation. Early in his career he was
also a leader in the study of histocompatibility systems.
Last year a special issue of Experimental Gerontology was
dedicated to Roy Walford. In that volume, the comments
of several colleagues with whom Roy interacted in fundamental areas of immunology provided evidence of the
admiration and respect with which he was viewed. For
example, the eminent Nobel Laureate, Professor Jean

Dausset, honored for his contributions to the field of
human leukocyte antigen biology, which is central to
immune function, described Roy as "brilliant..... original....lucid visionary of the future" [1]. Dr. Edwin Cooper
expressed his gratitude for the novel contributions to
immunosenescence derived from his interactions with
Roy in the study of lower animals and phylogenetic analyses [2]. The collaboration between Roy and Dr. G.B. Ferrara in identifying the so-called "Merrit alloantigen
system", now known as MHC Class II, were of fundamental importance in both transplant immunology and more
recently, in understanding antigen presentation. Dr. Ferrara described Roy as "an extraordinary man: genius, scientist, philosopher, artist, predictor of the events of our
time" [3]. This unusual foresight and intuition probably
played a role in the fact, as stated by immunologist Dr.
Richard Miller, that Roy was among the first "to note and
promote the powers of modern immunological

approaches as tools for the analysis of ageing" [4]. Thus,
Roy has played a pivotal role in numerous and varied
aspects of immunology and immunological ageing. His
contributions to gerontological research were truly
remarkable in their depth and innovation. Significantly,
most of the areas that he pioneered during his illustrious
research career remain the "hot" areas of current gerontological research. In this sense, he has achieved the most
important type of immortality. His death was a major personal and professional loss to numerous scientists within
the gerontological community.
On this first anniversary of Roy's death, it is highly fitting
to remember him by briefly reviewing the contributions
of Roy Walford to this important facet of gerontology, by
this new journal devoted to Immunity & Ageing. Indeed,
it was Roy who actually first coined the commonly used
term "immunosenescence". In 1969, Roy Walford published his landmark book, "The Immunologic Theory of
Aging" [5], which has now become a classic. This book,
together with his 1961 National Institutes of Health grant
on "The role of immune phenomena in the ageing process", which was continuously funded for nearly 40 years,
formed the basis for many of today's ideas about immunological ageing. Briefly, Roy hypothesized that the normal process of ageing in man and in all animals is
pathogenetically related to faulty immune processes. This
notion has proven to be prophetic. Indeed, in humans,
numerous clinical studies show significant correlations
between specific immune functional traits and early mortality, irrespective of the cause of death [6,7]. Moreover,
even in C. elegans, longevity is associated with increased
resistance to bacteria [8], underscoring the evolutionarilyconserved link between immunity and lifespan.

Replicative senescence within the immune
system
Roy was a visionary, and had the ability, so rare among
scientists, to see the forest, and not just the trees. Indeed,
it was this sort of thinking that led him to identify a novel
field of research as being of potential relevance to human
ageing, namely, the role of the cellular program of replicative senescence within the immune system. It is this merging of two distinct fields of scientific research that
exemplifies the highly creative aspects of Roy's thinking.
Specifically, during the early 1980's, Roy made the astute
observation that within the scientific community, there
existed two major groups of researchers, namely, immunologists and cell biologists, whose views on an important aspect of cell behavior were mutually incompatible.
Amazingly, for at least 7 years both disciplines developed
in parallel with very little manifest cognizance of a major
conflict of theoretical tenets [9].

A debate about replicative senescence arose with respect
to replicative senescence and its potential role in the
immune system. The well known studies of Hayflick [10]
and Hayflick & Moorhead [11] had suggested that normal
vertebrate diploid cells cultured in vitro invariably
undergo a finite number of cell divisions. Although there
are many theoretical explanations for this so-called "Hayflick Limit", and despite the fact that its potential role in
the ageing process is still unresolved, the dogma itself has
become a cornerstone of cell biologists' and gerontologists' thinking. In the same period when replicative senescence research was flourishing, it happened that a novel
cytokine which promoted T cell proliferation in cell culture was discovered, an event that soon led to a flurry of
immunology papers describing the seemingly unlimited
growth of normal human T cells [12,13]. This apparent
conflict between immunologists and cell biologists captured Roy's attention, and he was anxious to investigate
whether or not human lymphocytes cultured in vitro
were, in fact, restricted by the Hayflick Limit [9]. He reasoned that since immune responses to foreign pathogens
require extensive proliferation, a limited replicative
potential might have a significant impact on the efficient
function of lymphocytes, particularly in the elderly.
To systematically analyze the proliferative potential of
lymphocytes, human T cells derived from peripheral
blood of healthy young adult donors were propagated in
cell culture by repeated stimulation with antigen and continuous exposure to the T cell-specific growth factor, Interleukin-2 (IL-2). The mean number of cumulative
population doublings, derived from hundreds of cell cultures analyzed, falls consistently between 25 and 40. This
limited range has been reported by several different investigators who studied either bulk cultures or clonal populations, and it applies equally to the two subtypes of T
cells (CD4+/helper and CD8+/cytotoxic) [14-16]. The few
studies which analyzed cell populations in the rare
immortal cultures derived from normal T cells did, in fact,
find karyotypic abnormalities. Thus, it has now been
firmly established that T cells are similar to other normal
human somatic cells in that they invariably undergo replicative senescence in cell culture [17-19]. Moreover, these
studies identified several senescence-associated alterations that are restricted to T cells, in addition to those that
had already been documented in other cell types, such as
increased cell cycle inhibitor proteins, reduced response
to stress, telomere shortening and resistance to apoptosis
[16,20-22].

Roy Walford's legacy
Research over the past few decades has repeatedly confirmed the insightful predictions made by Roy Walford
regarding the role of the immune system in various
pathologies of aging. Indeed, in accord with Roy's original

hypothesis on the role of immunosenescence in human
ageing, there is accumulating evidence that many of the
so-called "diseases of aging" are caused by dysregulated
immune function and excessive inflammation [23]. For
example, Alzheimer's disease patients show a correlation
between mental function and T cell telomere length [24].
In addition, there is increasing evidence of T cell involvement in atherosclerosis [25]. Longitudinal studies on the
elderly have also provided clinical validation of many of
Roy's theoretical predictions. Analysis of the Swedish geriatric population over several decades, for example, has
documented a series of immune characteristics that is
associated with early all-cause mortality. This so-called
"immune risk profile" includes high proportions of CD8
T cells that lack CD28 expression as well as poor T cell proliferative capacity [6,7], both of which are hallmarks of T
cell replicative senescence.
The underlying mechanisms for many of the above clinical correlations remain to be determined, but the trajectory
and
agenda
for
a
large
body
of
immunogerontological research was established long ago,
thanks to the original far-reaching predictions and
hypotheses posed by Roy Walford.
