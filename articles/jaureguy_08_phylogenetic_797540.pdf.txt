Abstract
Background: Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) strains represent a huge public health burden.
Knowledge of their clonal diversity and of the association of clones with genomic content and clinical features is
a prerequisite to recognize strains with a high invasive potential. In order to provide an unbiased view of the
diversity of E. coli strains responsible for bacteremia, we studied 161 consecutive isolates from patients with
positive blood culture obtained during one year in two French university hospitals. We collected precise clinical
information, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) data and virulence gene content for all isolates. A subset
representative of the clonal diversity was subjected to comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) using 2,324
amplicons from the flexible gene pool of E. coli.
Results: Recombination-insensitive phylogenetic analysis of MLST data in combination with the ECOR collection
revealed that bacteremic E. coli isolates were highly diverse and distributed into five major lineages, corresponding
to the classical E. coli phylogroups (A+B1, B2, D and E) and group F, which comprises strains previously assigned
to D. Compared to other strains of phylogenetic group B2, strains belonging to MLST-derived clonal complexes
(CCs) CC1 and CC4 were associated (P < 0.05) with a urinary origin. In contrast, no CC appeared associated
with severe sepsis or unfavorable outcome of the bacteremia. CGH analysis revealed genomic characteristics of
the distinct CCs and identified genomic regions associated with CC1 and/or CC4.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that human bacteremia strains distribute over the entire span of E. coli
phylogenetic diversity and that CCs represent important phylogenetic units for pathogenesis and comparative
genomics.

Background
Escherichia coli is the most abundant facultative anaerobic
bacteria of the human intestinal flora. Whereas E. coli usually appears to be a harmless commensal, in other circumstances, E. coli strains can be pathogenic to humans and
were grouped into various pathotypes [1]. Among these,
extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) are
responsible for urinary tract, intra-abdominal and soft tissue infections, meningitis, pneumonia and osteomyelitis
often associated to bacteremia [2]. Bacteremia represents
the tenth major cause of death in developed countries and
among Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli represents
the first cause of bacteremia, with 30% of the total
number of bacteremias being due to this pathogen [3].
Among bacteremic isolates, those that are characterized by
specific virulence factors (VFs) such as adhesins, capsule,
cytotoxins and siderophores are considered as extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) [2], as these VFs are classically described as being necessary to overcome host
defenses, invade host tissues and trigger a local inflammatory response [4]. Phylogenetic analyses [5,6] suggested
that E. coli can be divided into four major groups (A, B1,
B2 and D). Generally, human ExPEC strains belong to
group B2, and to a lesser extent, group D, whereas commensal strains and less virulent strains belong to A or B1
groups [2,7-9].
Whether E. coli virulence factors influence the severity of
sepsis, in humans, is not clearly established. In fact, no
association between the severity of sepsis and the four
phylogenetic groups or other bacterial determinants was
evidenced [10]. The difficulty to establish a link between
phylogenetic groups on the one hand, and severity of
infection in humans on the other hand, can have several
causes. In particular, clonal structure within phylogenetic
groups and heterogeneity among clonal groups in terms
of severity could constitute an important confounding
factor. Therefore, it appears important to characterize the
clonal structure within phylogenetic groups and its association with clinical features.

Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST), in which internal
portions of multiple housekeeping genes are sequenced to
define clonal diversity, has emerged as a powerful tool to
describe the genetic structure of bacterial populations
[11]. In addition, MLST data allow determining the phylogenetic relationships among deep lineages, providing a
complementary view of the population structure [12].
Several sequence-based studies were used to characterize
clones or phylogenetic subgroups within E. coli [13-21].
Previous analyses of ExPEC were carried out on selected
strains [21-25]. However, the identity and distribution of
clonal groups in unselected bacteremia episodes have not
been investigated systematically, and thus, no unbiased
view of the overall diversity and distribution of human
bacteremic strains is currently available.
The aims of this work were (i) To define the clonal diversity of all E. coli strains isolated from consecutive bacteremia during one year in two major university hospitals in
Paris, (ii) To establish the possible association between
clonal groups and clinical determinants, and (iii) To characterize the genomic content of the disclosed clonal
groups.

Results
Nucleotide polymorphism and phylogenetic diversity
The internal portions of eight selected housekeeping
genes were sequenced in the 161 isolates, with only two
exceptions: three isolates (AVC062, NCK061 and
NCK062) were PCR-negative for trpA, and three isolates
(AVC025, AVC041, NCK011) were PCR-negative for uidA.
All sequences were aligned without insertion or deletion,
with the exception of two isolates (NCK018 and
NCK043), which showed a 5-nucleotide deletion in uidA,
resulting in a frameshift. The proportion of variable sites
ranged from 9.3% (uidA) to 15.5% (trpA) (Table 1). Considering the 4,095 nucleotides of the eight gene portions
together, there were 471 (11.5%) variable sites. The nucleotide diversity (π, average number of nucleotide differ-

ranged from 0.0174 (putP) to 0.0393 (trpA) (Table 1).
E. coli strains are generally considered to be grouped into
the four major phylogenetic groups A, B1, B2 and D [5,6],
although some strains may belong to additional groups
[19,26]. We characterized all isolates by the triplex PCR
method, designed to typify strains into four categories
equated to the four major groups [27]. Based on this PCR
scheme, the number of bacteremic isolates classified into
groups A, B1, B2 and D were 33 (20%), 11 (7%), 80
(50%) and 37 (23%), respectively. To determine precisely
the phylogenetic diversity of the 161 bacteremic isolates,
we sequenced the eight gene portions in strains of the
ECOR collection and performed a joint phylogenetic analysis, together with seven genome reference strains (Figure

1). The results highlighted the strong phylogenetic clustering of E. coli strains into five sharply separated branches.
Based on triplex PCR results and ECOR strains, these
branches could be equated to groups B2, A+B1, D, E and
a group, which we refer to as group F, comprising strains
assigned to group D based on triplex PCR. Of note, when
genetic distances among strains were considered, the B2
branch was more heterogeneous than the branch comprising strains of groups A and B1 together. Group A
appeared paraphyletic, as B1 strains were nested within
the diversity of A strains. A few confirmed inconsistencies
(for isolates NCK23, NCK45 and AVC003, Figure 2) were
found between triplex-PCR and sequence-based phylogenetic relationships, as also reported by others [20,26].
Remarkably, the bacteremic isolates were distributed into

Cluster analysis of Escherichia coli isolates based on allelic profiles (A) and macroarray data (B). (A) Minimum
spanning tree analysis of the 161 E. coli isolates based on allelic profiles at the eight genes dinB, icdA, pabB, polB, putP, trpA, trpB
and uidA. Each circle corresponds to a sequence type (the ST number is given inside the circle), and the size of the circle is
related to the number of isolates found with that profile (from 1 for small circles e.g. ST14 to 17 for ST4). Grey zones between
some groups of circles indicate that these profiles belong to the same clonal complex (CC). Circles were colored based on triplex-PCR phylogroup assignment. Bold, plain and discontinuous links between circles correspond to one, two or more allelic
mismatch(es), respectively; note that links with distance > 2 are not reliable (for example, the spread of group D across the
entire graph does not indicate discrepancy of MLST with triplex PCR). Grey roman numbers above some CCs correspond to
B2 subgroups as defined in a previous study [21]. The position of strain APEC O1 was added manually; it corresponds to a single locus variant of ST1. (B) Classification of 60 bacteremic isolates using macroarray analysis results. Reference strains are

the five major branches, clearly demonstrating that they
do not represent a restricted subset of E. coli strains.
Genotype diversity and identification of clonal complexes
The 161 clinical isolates were distributed into 87 sequence
types (ST), seven of which comprised five or more strains,
representing 38% of the strains in total (Additional file 1).
The most frequent ST encountered was ST1 (ST78 or ST79

in Mark Achtman's MLST scheme; please see Additional
file 2 for known correspondence of STs in our scheme and
Mark Achtman's one), with 15 isolates. Sixty-nine STs corresponded to a single isolate, and Simpson's diversity
index was 97.6%, underlying the diversity of bacteremic
E. coli isolates revealed by MLST. Of note, frequent STs
mostly belonged to groups A and B2, resulting in a lower
Simpson's index of diversity of groups A (87.7%) and B2

(92.9%), compared in particular to group B1, were all
sampled isolates were distinct (Simpson's index, 100%).
There was no clear difference in genotype diversity
between the two hospital centers, and frequent STs were
recovered from each of them.
Clonal families within bacterial populations in which
homologous recombination occurs, as is the case for E.
coli [19,28], are best identified based on allelic profile
comparisons, as the collapsing of nucleotide polymorphisms into allelic numbers is less sensitive to the disturbing impact of recombination [12]. As determined using
eBURST and a minimum spanning tree (MStree) analysis
(Figure 2), the 87 STs were grouped into 19 clonal complexes (CC), i.e. groups of closely related STs differing by
no more than one allele from another member of the
group. Eleven major CCs (CC1 to CC4, CC6, CC10,
CC32, CC36, CC40, CC43 and CC66) comprised five or
more isolates. Based on available complete genome
sequences and ECOR strains, correspondence of CCs with
a previous classification [21] was established (Figure 2).
Interestingly, no member of subgroup VIII (ST149) [21]
was found among the bacteremic clinical isolates. Strains
of this clone, represented by the ED1a genome strain (Figure 2), have been reported as human-specific and strictly
commensal [29]. Each individual CC probably has a single ancestor for most parts of its genome, and CCs can
therefore be equated to clones, as it is very likely that
strains sharing seven out of eight alleles have a common
descent. Although large allelic profile distances separated
most CCs, the links among clones disclosed by MStree
analysis (Figure 2A) were consistent with phylogenetic
group assignments. For example, CCs of group B2 generally shared more alleles in common than with STs of other
groups.
Association of clonal complexes with clinical determinants
In a previous work, differences were found among phylogenetic groups with respect to the primary source of bacteremia [30]. B2 was significantly associated with
urosepsis and immunocompetent hosts, whereas non-B2
isolates were associated with non-urinary tract origins and
immunocompromised hosts. Here, we tested the hypothesis of a possible association of particular clones (the
above described 11 major clones), even within a given
phylogenetic group, with clinical determinants (Additional file 1).

Based on a logistic regression model analysis, we did not
find statistical evidence for an association of CCs with a
severe sepsis or a defavorable outcome. However, the two
major clones of group B2 (CC1 and CC4) were significantly associated with urinary tract as a source of bacteremia (Table 2), in comparison to other B2 genotypes.
There were 12 (70%) urosepsis cases out of 17 isolates of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/560

CC1 (p = 0.017), and 11 (65%) urosepsis cases out of 17
isolates of CC4 (p = 0.041). In contrast, in the 46 remaining B2 isolates, there were only 14 (30%) urosepsis cases.
Conversely, B2 clone CC32 was significantly associated
with a non urinary tract origin as primary source of infection (p = 0.023). The other clones of group B2 showed
mixed origins with few urosepsis cases (Table 2). A
number of other characteristics of particular clones compared to other B2 isolates were statistically supported:
CC36 was associated with female gender (p = 0.005),
although it was not associated with urinary origin; CC32
was found only in males (p = 0.029), CC40 was associated
with community-acquired infection (p = 0.048) and CC6
tended to be associated with diabetes mellitus (p = 0.059).
These results may indicate heterogeneity of biological
characteristics among CCs of phylogenetic group B2. Similarly, among phylogenetic group D isolates, CC3 was significantly associated with a digestive tract origin of the
infection (p = 0.038). Among group A isolates, isolates of
CC66 were significantly associated with renal failure (p =
0.049), and CC2 isolates were weakly associated with
neoplasia (p = 0.069).
Virulence factor content of clonal complexes
Virulence factor (VF) distribution is known to differ
among the four phylogenetic groups [5-7]. In our previous study, isolates of group B2 were characterized by a
high number of VFs, whereas those belonging to groups A
and D exhibited lower numbers [30]. Here, we compared
at the clone level the presence of nine genes associated
with ExPEC virulence, and of the svg ORF, recently
described as specific for a highly virulent B2 subgroup
[23] (Additional file 1). As expected, we found a strong
association between CCs and VF content, particularly
among B2 isolates (Table 3). For example, clones CC1 and
CC4 differed significantly by the number of isolates containing hlyC, cnf and sfa (low in CC1 but high in CC4). In
addition, iucC was significantly associated with CC1 and
CC4 isolates, compared to the remaining B2 isolates. The
absence of the adhesin papGII was statistically associated
with B2-CC32, B2-CC10 and B2-CC40, compared to the
other B2 isolates. In addition, B2-CC43 and B2-CC6 were
almost devoid of the investigated VFs, with statistical support for papC, sfa, hlyC, cnf1 and iucC (p < 0.05). Finally,
all isolates of ST1 (the central genotype of CC1) except
one were positive upon svg PCR, consistent with previous
results [23]. Only one non-ST1 isolate (ST41, member of
CC40) was also positive for svg.
Flexible gene pool content of bacteremic isolates
In order to determine the genomic characteristics of
clones and to identify possible associations between
genetic factors and clinical features, we designed a macroarray composed of 2,324 probes and analyzed the
genome content of a subset of 60 bacteremic isolates

terized by a specific genomic content. In addition, DNA
array data were fully consistent with the above-described
virulence factor PCR results.
Because the strongest link of clonal diversity with clinical
features within major phylogenetic groups was the association of two B2 clones (CC1 and CC4) with urinary tract
origin, we concentrated our analysis on the genomic particularities of CC1 and CC4. We identified 145 (6%)
probes that were distributed differently in CC1 and/or
CC4 when compared to other B2 isolates (Figure 3, Additional file 3), as determined by the template matching
clustering approach [31].

Among probes that reacted positively with both CC1 and
CC4 but not with other B2 isolates, were two clusters of
six and eight sequences, respectively (c1445-c1453 and
c1569-c1577) (Fisher exact test, p < 0.05) (Figure 3).
These prophage sequences are included in previously
described genomics islands [32,33] in the CFT073 chromosome, respectively φ-CFT073-potB and PAI-CFT073icdA. Consistently, these sequences were also present in
the O45:K1 strain S88 (ST1, CC1), a meningitis-causing
strain that is closely related [34] to E. coli K1 RS218 strain
(ST1, CC1). The two groups of phage-associated
sequences were not restricted to CC1-CC4 B2 isolates

(present in strain 536 and B2-CC32, Figure 3) and also
detected in some isolates of groups A, B1 and D.
Genomic regions that were specific for CC4 were also
identified. Isolates of CC4 were characterized, compared
to other B2 isolates, by the presence of three operons composed respectively of three (c1884-c1886), six (c2893c2898) and seven genes (c5372-c5381) (p < 0.001, Fisher
exact test), encoding putative proteins of unknown function. Consistently, these genes were present in the genome
of CFT073 (ST4, CC4), but not in the genomes of strains
536 (ST261, CC32) and S88 (ST1, CC1). Moreover, these
operons were detected in none of the non-B2 isolates. In
addition, a large DNA region from CFT073 (c0358c0365) was detected more significantly in CC4 isolates
than in other B2 isolates (p = 0.01 Fisher exact test,
present also in B2-CC36), and all isolates of groups A, B
and D were negative for this DNA region (Figure 3 and
Additional file 3). This region comprised three genes
(c0361-c0363) encoding two putative membrane export
proteins and a putative RTX exotoxin A. Regarding CC1associated genes, only two bacteriophage proteins
described in RS218 (ST1, CC1) genome, one Q homolog
phage protein and a K-12 MG1655 hypothetical protein
(ydfC), were found. Conversely, two groups of sequences
were always absent from CC1 and CC4 but present in
most other B2 isolates (Figure 3; p < 0.05, Fisher exact
test).

Discussion
We analyzed the phylogenetic diversity of an unselected
set of 161 consecutive bacteremic E. coli isolates, and compared the genomic content of a representative subset of
genotypes in order to investigate the link between clonal
diversity, gene content and clinical correlates of bacteremia.
Bacteremic isolates were distributed across the entire span
of E. coli phylogenetic diversity. The amount of polymorphism found herein is consistent with values reported in
E. coli, based on other housekeeping genes [18,19,35,36].
Amounts of polymorphism among bacteremia isolates
were only slightly lower than a recent study of 185 isolates
from freshwater beaches [18]. For example, the authors
found 49 uidA alleles with 12% polymorphic sites,
whereas we found 27 uidA alleles and 9.3% polymorphic
sites (note that our collection of bacteremic isolates
included only 7% of isolates of group B1, whereas this
group represented 56% of isolates from the environment
[18]). Consequently, our results clearly indicate that
human E. coli bacteremia strains are genetically highly
diverse. Of note, avian pathogenic E. coli strains (APEC)
overlap only partly with the human ExPEC population,
with some potentially zoonotic clonal groups being
found both in humans and birds, while other APEC clonal

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/560

groups are rare or absent among human ExPEC [37-39].
Thus, total ExPEC diversity may exceed the large diversity
of human bacteremic isolates alone.
Although it was not the main purpose of this study, we
noted that our combined analysis of bacteremic isolates
and of ECOR reference strains using ClonalFrame
revealed the existence of sharp demarcations among deep
branches, suggesting a much stronger structure within the
E. coli species than previously disclosed based on recombination-sensitive phylogenetic analyses, such as the
neighbor-joining method. So far, methods that detect
homologous recombination events and account for these
in phylogenetic reconstruction have not been used widely
in E. coli, and it is likely that phylogenetic group demarcation may have been problematic until now given the
effects of homologous recombination, which tends to
homogenize E. coli diversity and blur the neat borders that
may delineate independently evolving phylogenetic lineages [19,26]. In addition, classification into only four
major groups appears to be an oversimplification of a
more complex reality. The five major branches disclosed
herein do not correspond totally to previous group definitions, as groups A and B1 were not well separated, and as
branch F could not be equated to any previously described
group. These results challenge the classical view of the
internal phylogenetic structure of E. coli, in agreement
with recent studies [18,19].
Our initial hypothesis was that clones, rather than entire
phylogenetic groups, may be more relevant natural entities to establish an association of genotype with phenotype, including clinical correlates of bacteremic isolates.
In order to define groups of closely related genotypes, we
used allelic profile-based comparisons, rather than nucleotide sequence-based analysis [16,21,23]. Because the
later approach is sensitive to homologous recombination,
analysis of allelic profiles is preferred for clone definition
in many bacterial species [12,40]. Among E. coli bacteremic isolates, a number of CCs, which can be equated to
clones, could thus be defined. Interestingly, the central
genotype of CCs, inferred to represent the founder of the
clone, generally had a higher frequency than its variants,
consistent with currently ongoing or recent expansion of
the clones [12]. For the purposes of classification, it is
noteworthy that most CCs were separated by large allelic
profile distances (four or five mismatches), highlighting
the neat demarcation among them. Phylogenetic group
B2 appeared to be the most strongly structured group, as
most isolates were grouped into nine CCs (Figure 2).
We explored the hypothesis that clinical correlates and
distribution of particular genes would be associated with
specific clonal backgrounds, rather than being distributed
widely across E. coli diversity. Because horizontal gene

transfer occurs among E. coli strains, virulence genes that
confer specific advantages e.g. for urinary tract infection
can be distributed in various genomic backgrounds. However, association of specific genes with particular genomic
backgrounds (clonal groups) can be retained, at least in
the short term, by predominantly vertical transmission
e.g. for genes that are not harbored on mobile elements.
In this case, knowledge of the clonal background would
have predictive value regarding gene content and corresponding phenotypes [41].
Consistent with our initial hypothesis that particular
clones may exhibit clinically relevant features, several correlations were established between some CCs and clinical
data. Most notably, CC1 and CC4 were clearly associated
with isolates responsible for urosepsis; these CCs correspond to previously-described subgroups II (strain
CFT073) and IX (strain RS218), corresponding to strains
responsible of urosepsis and of neonatal meningitis,
respectively [21]. Hence, the previously held association
of B2 as a whole with urosepsis may be an oversimplification due to the strong contribution of CC1 and CC4 to
isolates of this group, and may thus not be valid for all B2
strains. Interestingly, we detected by DNA array analysis,
two specific gene clusters associated with CC1 and CC4.
These sequences, which correspond to cryptic prophages,
were previously described as being located in two consecutive genomic islands [32]. Consistent with our results,
one of these clusters, PAI-CFT073-icdA, was described as
being more frequent among pyelonephritis isolates [32].
Likewise, a specific DNA region encoding to a putative
RTX protein was significantly associated to CC4 isolates. A
first RTX-toxin described in E. coli, hemolysin A, has been
clearly associated with pyelonephritis and implicated in
inflammation during urinary tract infection [42,43].
Some UPEC strains including CFT073 harbor two operons of this toxin, and the specific role of each copy
remains unclear [33,44]. Whether the new putative RTX
toxin constitutes an advantage to CC4 isolates and could
explain their specific urovirulence remains to be determined.
As assessed by PCR and DNA array hybridization, clonal
complexes were characterized by specific gene content.
For example, isolates belonging to CC4 exhibited significantly more VFs (sfa, cnf1, hlyC) than CC1 isolates, and
ORF svg was associated with CC1. In addition, the pattern
of gene content variation (Figure 3) was highly concordant with clonal complexes, clearly illustrating that
genomic background as assessed by MLST and gene content are strongly correlated. This pattern is consistent with
the well-established mechanisms of deletion or acquisition of entire PAIs [45-50]. In order to get clues into the
possible biological and clinical significance of gene content differences among clones, it will be necessary to com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/560

bine functional studies with the analysis of E. coli isolates
from other sources. For example, comparing the gene content of bacteremic and commensal isolates within a single
clone should provide insights into microevolutionary
events leading to increased or decreased pathogenic
potential.
Our results confirmed that most of the usually recognized
extra-intestinal VFs (e.g. pap, sfa, hly) were concentrated in
the virulent CCs, particularly those belonging to phylogenetic group B2. In contrast, others VFs, for example those
related to the plasmid-encoded iron uptake system (e.g.
iucC, iroN), were more broadly distributed [45,51]. Therefore, for highly mobile genetic elements (e.g. plasmids),
the association with clonal background may not be
retained.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we characterized the clonal diversity of all
consecutive isolates responsible for bacteremia during
one year in two hospitals, revealing for the first time their
distribution into phylogenetic groups and clonal groups
in an unbiased way. We demonstrated the existence of differences in gene content or clinical parameters among
some of the major clonal families identified. Although
they should be confirmed on larger populations to be
firmly established, these results confirm that particular
STs, CCs or phylogenetic subgroups, rather than the more
inclusive higher categories known as major phylogenetic
groups, will be relevant units of pathogenicity. However,
the heterogeneity of gene content within clones, although
limited, may be highly significant clinically, which in turn
suggests that finer phylogenetic subdivisions within CCs
may also differ in clinically important characteristics. The
failure to associate CCs with severity of clinical outcome
may also indicate that the characteristics of the host play
a dominant role.

Methods
Bacterial strains
We studied 161 well-characterized E. coli isolates from
bacteremia; this set of isolates (Additional file 1) has been
previously described [30]. Briefly, isolates were collected
between December 2002 and December 2003 and correspond to all consecutive episodes of E. coli bacteremia in
two major university hospitals in Paris. Epidemiological
(age, sex gender), clinical (community/nosocomial
acquired infection, immune status, underlying diseases,
primary source of infection, severity sepsis scoring and
outcome), and laboratory data for each episode were
recorded in an anonymous computer database in accordance with French law. We determined the primary source
of bacteremia by clinical and radiological presentation
and/or by evidence, based on antibiogram and/or serotyping, of an identical strain isolated from blood and

other body sites culture [30]. When the primary source of
infection was not found, the origin of infection was
assigned to the digestive tract. All the above 161 isolates
are listed in supplementary Table 1. The ECOR collection
of 72 reference strains [52] was included for phylogenetic
comparisons; five ECOR strains could not be sequenced at
all eight genes (see below) and were removed from the
analysis: ECOR5 (A), ECOR6 (A), ECOR9 (A), ECOR13
(A) and ECOR64 (B2). In addition, seven strains for
which the complete genome sequence is available (K-12
MG1655, O157:H7-EDL933, 536, CFT073, UTI89,
RS218) or underway (ED1a, ColiScope project, http://
www.genoscope.cns.fr/spip/Escherichia-fergusonii.html)
were used.
Triplex-PCR for tentative group assignment
A triplex-PCR method [27] was used to tentatively assign
the isolates to the four major E. coli phylogenetic groups
A, B1, B2 and D.
Multilocus Sequence Typing
Primer pairs were designed for PCR amplification and
sequencing of internal portions of eight housekeeping
genes (Table 4). Selected genes included dinB, icdA, pabB,
polB, putP, trpA and trpB, previously used for phylogenetic

analysis of E. coli/Shigella strains [53-55]. New PCR primers were designed in internal portions of the genes based
on previously obtained sequences, in order to amplify target regions of approximately 500 – 600 bp (Table 4).
These seven genes represent six distinct loci on the E. coli
chromosome, as trpA and trpB are located in the same
operon. To increase the number of loci to seven, we added
gene uidA, which is used for E. coli MLST by the group of
Tom Whittam [20]. Universal sequencing primer
sequences were added to the 5' end of the PCR primers. All
PCR products were thus sequenced using the same two
sequencing primers (Table 4). Further details on this
MLST scheme can be found at http://www.pasteur.fr/mlst.
Nucleotide sequences were obtained using Big Dye version 3.1 chemistry on ABI 3100 or 3730 apparatuses. In
order to eliminate the risk of sample mix-up, PCR and
sequencing were performed using a molecular biology
robot (RoboAmp 4200-PE; MWG Biotech, Courtaboeuf,
France). Sequence chromatograms were edited and stored
using BioNumerics version 4.5 (Applied-Maths, St.
Maartens-Latem, Belgium). All nucleotides within the
consensus sequence template were supported by at least
two sequence chromatograms. A different allele number
was given to each distinct sequence within a locus, and a

distinct sequence type (ST) number was attributed to each
distinct combination of alleles. Null alleles corresponding
to negative PCR amplification were considered as alignment gaps in phylogenetic analyses and as allele '999' in
profile-based analyses. Isolates were grouped into clonal
complexes (CCs) by eBURST, if they differed at no more
than 1 locus from at least one other member of the group
[56]. Founder genotypes of CCs were defined as the ST of
the CC with the highest number of neighboring STs (single locus variants). Nucleotide diversity was calculated
using DNAsp version 4 [57]. Minimum spanning tree
analysis was performed using BioNumerics version 5.10.
MEGA [58] was used to draw the consensus phylogenetic
tree obtained using ClonalFrame [59] after 100,000 iterations, including 50,000 burn-in.
Sequences
Allele sequences and STs are available on Institut Pasteur's
MLST web site at http://www.pasteur.fr/mlst.
DNA macroarrays
A DNA macroarray was adapted from a previously
described array [21]. This E. coli pathoarray was developed
with the aim to contain a large E. coli flexible gene pool.
DNA probes were selected using the genome sequence
(GenBank accession CP000247) of the O6:K15:H31
uropathogenic E. coli strain 536 [60], the sequence (GenBank accession AE014075) of the O6:K2:H1 uropathogenic E. coli strain CFT073 [33], and E. coli K-12
(MG1655, GenBank accession U00096) [61]. DNA
sequences showing an homology above 95% within the
three genomes were excluded. In addition, specific
sequences of the meningitis-associated strain RS218 [62],
i.e. sequences with less that 95% homology in the above
three strains, were included. The genome sequence of
strain RS218 was only partially available at http://
www.genome.wisc.edu at the time of membrane conception.

Amplicons were designed to correspond to annotated
ORFs. Additional file 4 describes the composition of the
membrane. When the size of an ORF was less than 800 bp
the entire sequence corresponding to the ORF was
selected. ORF above 1 kb were represented on the membrane by at least 2 amplicons. In addition sequences of
intergenic regions which were not present in all three
genomes were amplified and represented on the membrane if above 500 bp. 2,324 specific genomic DNA fragments corresponding to 2,196 ORFs and 91 intergenic
regions (IRs) were spotted on the membrane. Fourteen
additional sequences were added in the DNA array. These
sequences corresponded to specific virulence-associated
ExPEC genes characterized in recent studies but not represented after comparative genomic analysis of the above
strains.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/560

The amplicons were spotted in duplicate by a robot (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) on nylon membranes and fixed
by alkali treatment. Positive (186 spots containing 16S
rDNA and genomic DNA of CFT073 strain) and negative
(15 spots containing both human and mouse gene DNA
and 14 spots with absence of DNA) control spots were
used for normalization.
Genomic DNA extraction, labeling and macroarray
hybridization
Bacteria were grown overnight at 37°C in aerobic condition on agar plate. Genomic DNA was isolated using the
DNA Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega,
Madison, USA). Genomic DNA extract (100 ng to 500 ng)
were labelled with 50 mCi of [α33P] dCTP (Amersham
Biosciences, Orsay, France), using the Rediprime II random prime labelling system (GE Healthcare, Amersham,
UK) according to manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were soaked in 6× SSC and pre-hybridized in
Shake 'n' Stack hybridization over (Hybaid, Thermo Scientific, Canada) for 4 hours at 65°C with 6 ml Church &
Gilbert hybridization buffer (0.5 M NaPi, 1 mM EDTA,
7% SDS) containing 100 μg/ml heat-denatured salmon
sperm DNA (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, France).
Labeled genomic DNA was denatured at 100°C for 5 min
and hybridization was performed during 15–18 h at 65°C
in the Church & Gilbert buffer. After hybridization, each
nylon membrane was washed three times in the same
solution (40 mM NaPi, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) for 45 min
at 65°C. The membranes were then exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for 48 h. The PhosphorImager screens
were scanned on a Storm 860 PhosphorImager device (GE
Healthcare, Life Science, UK) at a pixel size of 50 μm.
Before being re-hybridized, filters were stripped in 125 ml
of a bowled buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA
pH 8.0, 1% SDS) for 25 min at 100°C. A unique hybridization experiment was performed for each isolate investigated in this study and at least two independently
experiments were performed for E. coli control strains.
Macroarray quality control
This macroarray was first tested using the three sequenced
strains, i.e. E. coli strain 536, strain CFT073 and E. coli K12. This experiment was performed twice for strain 536,
four times for strain CFT073 and three times with E. coli
K-12 MG1655. False negative results were obtained in less
than 0.01%. The average number of false positive was 8%,
9% and 12.5% using strain 536, CFT073 and K-12
MG1655 E. coli, respectively. Thirty-five amplicons, giving
repeatedly false positive or negative results, were removed
from the final analysis and are labeled as such in Additional file 1. The remaining sequences on the array were
annotated as coding for (i) cell structure membrane proteins (127), (ii) putative functional enzymes involved in
metabolic pathways (493), (iii) putative transcriptional

regulators (63), (iv) known virulence factors (204), (v)
hypothetical proteins (880), and (vi) mobile genetic elements such as transposases, IS or phages (219). To get
insight into the specific function of RS218-derived
sequences, we used the complete genome sequence (ColiScope project) of the phylogenetically related strain S88
[34].
Macroarray data submission
Macroarray data were submitted to the ArrayExpress database under accession number: A-MEXP-1451.
Macroarray data analysis
The macroarray data were analysed using the ArrayVision
software (Imaging Reseach, St Catharines, Canada) for
signal quantification. To avoid empirical determination
of cut-offs, we developed R scripts (based on the Package
Mclust for Normal Mixture modeling) adapted from a
program developed for comparative genomic hybridization analysis of Enterococcus faecalis [63]. This analysis was
based on bimodal distribution of hybridization signals,
thus highlighting the existence of two different gene populations corresponding to high or low intensities. Each
population of gene fits a Gaussian distribution model and
allows the use of an algorithm for gene classification
based on the probability that each value of probe
belonged to the population of high or low hybridization
signals (i.e. present, class 1 or absent genes, class -1).
Parameters of the model are estimated by maximum likelihood using an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm running from the median of negative controls to the
median of positive controls. Using this mathematic
model, genes were classified to be either present (probability of belonging to class 1 > 80%) or absent (probability of belonging to class 1 < 20%). Some genes were
considered ambiguous (probability of belonging to class
1 between 20% and 80%). R analysis was done for all the
hybridized arrays and a matrix of 1 (gene present in this
strain), 0 (ambiguous gene) and -1 (gene absent is this
strain) was obtained. TMeV software was used with this
matrix for data clustering and template matching analysis
[64].
Statistical analysis
Comparisons were based on Chi-square test for categorical variables and Fisher exact test when numbers were
below five. All tests were two-tailed and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Multiple logistic regressions were used
to assess the relationships between two clonal complexes,
the binary variables, and explanatory variables: host characteristics and bacterial determinants. Variables with a p
value less than 0.25 in univariate analyses were included
into the model and interaction between significant variable was estimated. Only significant variables in the model

were conserved to determine the statistically significant
relationships between CC and clinical determinants.
STATA version 8 was the statistical software used for Chisquare and multiple logistic regression models.

Abbreviations
