Abstract
Background: The public availability of over 180,000 bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
sequences has facilitated microbial identification and classification using hybridization and other
molecular approaches. In their usual format, such assays are based on the presence of unique
subsequences in the target RNA and require a prior knowledge of what organisms are likely to be
in a sample. They are thus limited in generality when analyzing an unknown sample.
Herein, we demonstrate the utility of catalogs of masses to characterize the bacterial 16S rRNA(s)
in any sample. Sample nucleic acids are digested with a nuclease of known specificity and the
products characterized using mass spectrometry. The resulting catalogs of masses can subsequently
be compared to the masses known to occur in previously-sequenced 16S rRNAs allowing organism
identification. Alternatively, if the organism is not in the existing database, it will still be possible to
determine its genetic affinity relative to the known organisms.
Results: Ribonuclease T1 and ribonuclease A digestion patterns were calculated for 1,921
complete 16S rRNAs. Oligoribonucleotides generated by RNase T1 of length 9 and longer produce
sufficient diversity of masses to be informative. In addition, individual fragments or combinations
thereof can be used to recognize the presence of specific organisms in a complex sample. In this
regard, 140 strains out of 1,921 organisms (7.3%) could be identified by the presence of a unique
RNase T1-generated oligoribonucleotide mass. Combinations of just two and three
oligoribonucleotide masses allowed 54% and 72% of the specific strains to be identified,
respectively. An initial algorithm for recovering likely organisms present in complex samples is also
described.
Conclusion: The use of catalogs of compositions (masses) of characteristic oligoribonucleotides
for microbial identification appears extremely promising. RNase T1 is more useful than ribonuclease
A in generating characteristic masses, though RNase A produces oligomers which are more readily
distinguished due to the large mass difference between A and G. Identification of multiple species
in mixtures is also feasible. Practical applicability of the method depends on high performance mass
spectrometric determination, and/or use of methods that increase the one dalton (Da) mass
difference between uracil and cytosine.

Background
In light of growing concern over increasing microbial
resistance to antibiotics, bioterrorism, and the continuous
emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases [1,2],
several government agencies have identified the development of new diagnostics as a key to maintaining the
health of the U.S. population and the world as a whole [36]. Infectious diseases account for 26 percent of total global mortality [7] and are the third leading cause of death
in the United States [8,9]. In addition to microbial identification for clinical response, diagnostics are also needed
for a wide range of applications including food and water
safety, bioreactor analysis and sterility assurance, and
environmental microbiology. In some instances, e.g. a
long-term space mission, bioterror incident, or emerging
disease, it may be impossible to anticipate what the problem organism(s) will be.
To this day, determinative bacteriology often relies on culture-based methods involving time-consuming isolation,
cultivation, and characterization of phenotypic traits of
the culture. While in a few cases a rapid identification can
be made using phenotypic methods, the phylogenetic resolution of such methods is usually quite low. Characterization of cells based on morphology, staining, and
metabolic traits is often not discriminatory and can take
days to weeks for unambiguous identification [10,11].
Some recent advances have been made using in vivo
phage-based detection mechanisms, however these systems require precise culturing conditions that can affect
their accuracy, and increased culture time opens the window for contamination or selection [12]. Perhaps most
importantly, many pathogens are extremely fastidious or
even uncultivable under laboratory conditions, so that
culture-based methods are not applicable. Finally, such
methods are labor-intensive, not amenable to automation, and require extensive "hands-on" time and interpretation by the trained microbiologist. In the "postgenome" era, molecular methods are rapidly supplanting
phenotypic characterization.
Although a variety of approaches are in use, most current
microbial diagnostic research is focused on molecular
methods such as comparative sequencing of PCR-amplified 16S ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA), hybridization
with labeled probes or molecular beacons, phylogenetic
microarrays, and reverse transcription of rRNA and amplification (RT-PCR) used in conjunction with hybridization
probes or sequencing [13-15]. Methods utilizing 16S
rRNA are especially common because this molecule is
now widely used in the assignment of bacteria to specific
taxonomic groups, and partial or full sequences are available from over 180,000 strains (as of RDP release 9.32,
72,540 sequences are of length 1200 nt or more). Methods that rely on hybridization are effective at leveraging

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/117

genomic information, but they typically face the significant drawback of requiring construction of one or more
probes based on a priori knowledge of the genus or species
that needs to be detected.
Complete or partial genomic sequencing requires no such
preliminary knowledge, but sequencing is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Several commercial kits are available for microbial identification using complete 16S
rDNA sequencing by standard PCR (with universally conserved primers) amplification of the 16S rDNA gene followed by chain-termination sequencing [16,17].
However, read lengths are currently limited to about 500
bases, so that full coverage of the approximately 1,542nucleotide 16S rDNA gene, requires separate sequencing
of the products of three PCR reactions.
In summary, a variety of molecular methods have been
developed for microbial identification. However, they are
typically limited in their generality by their requirement
for a priori knowledge of a putative characteristic
sequence. Methods of full sequence determination are
more general, but are labor-intensive and not readily amenable to mixtures or quantitative comparisons. Both
sequencing and hybridization require a means for radioisotope- or fluorescence-labeling.
Sequence cataloging versus sequence comparison
Before the development of modern DNA sequencing
methods, oligoribonucleotide cataloging was successfully
used to compare 16S rRNA sequences and determine relationships between bacteria [18]. The essence of the
method was to fragment the RNA with ribonucleases, isolate the resulting small digestion products, and individually sequence each of them [19-22]. RNase T1 and RNase
A cleave 16S rRNA specifically on the 3'-side of G residues
and pyrimidine residues (C and U), respectively. Experimental fragmentation of the RNA with RNase T1 proved to
be especially informative, reliable, and reproducible. The
extent of similarity between organisms could be deduced
by comparing the RNase T1 catalogs [23]. It was empirically found that when comparing two catalogs, identities
between oligoribonucleotides of length six and longer
were far more likely to be the result of sequence homology
than random chance [19,24]. Thus, sequences of all
smaller oligoribonucleotides were ignored in the comparisons. Like actual sequences, such catalogs are additive to
a database as they are generated. In addition, any newlydetermined sequence can be deconstructed to a mass catalog and included in a comparison. It is appropriate to
point out that conceptually similar approaches are well
accepted and have been used quite successfully in the field
of proteomics – that is, partial enzymatic digestion and
comparison to a database of predicted masses [25-28].

Mass spectrometry for sequence characterization
Due to the aforementioned challenges, a number of methods for sequence characterization using mass spectrometric analysis have been proposed as alternatives to
hybridization or full sequencing [29-33]. MALDI-TOF
(matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-offlight) mass spectrometry is a method of choice for measuring the masses of oligoribonucleotides, especially mixtures thereof. The MALDI ionization process results from
absorption of laser excitation light by an aromatic organic
acid and transfer of that energy to the co-crystallized analyte. Once ionized, the desorbed plume of matrix and analyte is accelerated in a vacuum through a long flight tube
to a "time-of-flight" detector. The time of flight is proportional (subject to correction factors) to the square root of
the mass-to-charge ratio. Because "soft-ionization" techniques such as MALDI provide a direct means of measuring one of the fundamental properties of biomolecules,
they have recently been widely used for novel analytical
assays. Mass spectrometric characterization of nucleic
acids has been used in a variety of applications including
analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and
dideoxy sequencing [34,35]. When MALDI of nucleic
acids first became practicable, it was quickly seen as a possible substitute for nucleic acid sequencers due to the
rapidity of the separation versus capillary or gel electrophoresis. This led to most groups treating the MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometer as a chain-termination (Sanger concept) sequencer. That is, nested di-deoxy chain terminated
fragments were separated in the mass spectrometer and
the sequence directly read from the spectrum. At present,
however, the maximum read length using such an
approach is ~56 nucleotides [31].
Compositional characterization
Because of this limitation on read-length, a compromise
between information loss and speed (provided by rapid
mass spectrometry) has been reached. For discrimination
of organisms based upon compositional information
alone, either extremely accurate mass measurement of a
large sequence region is necessary, or less precise measurement of multiple informative fragments is required. For
example, Ecker et al. have employed electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry in conjunction with Fourier
transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) to successfully
type strains of Group A streptococci and were able to distinguish them from commensal organisms [36,37]. PCR
products are obtainable for a broad range of organisms
using universally conserved primers and mismatch-tolerant reaction conditions. The PCR products (80–140 bp)
are then analyzed for their total base compositions, i.e.
AwCxGyTz. Unfortunately, the very high resolution
required for unambiguous compositional assignment (± 1
ppm) of such a large molecule requires elaborate instrumentation which is out of reach for many laboratories. In

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/117

contrast, the more common approach has been to generate base-specific fragments of single-stranded DNA or
RNA. That is, a single-stranded sequence is cleaved after
every occurrence of a particular base generating multiple
fragments of smaller mass.
Herein we examine the possibility of using mass spectrometry to generate catalogs of rRNA fragment compositions (masses) as a tool for rapid microbial identification.
MALDI generates singly-charged ions and is widely
regarded as the mass spectrometric technology most
applicable to analyzing the types of mixtures generated by
nucleic acid fragmentation. In fact, the experimental feasibility of using a fragmentation strategy in combination
with MALDI has already been established. Hahner et al.
have described endoribonuclease digestion for the generation of RNase T1 fragments and MALDI characterization
[38]. Hartmer et al. modified the approach and applied it
to discovery of SNPs and identification of bacteria using
16S rRNA regions [39]. Von Wintzingerode et al. showed
MALDI of base-specific fragmentation patterns of 16S
rDNA amplicons to be a viable method for microbial
identification and compared experimental to predicted
masses for Bordetella species [40]. More recently Lefmann
et al. have used base-specific cleavage to discriminate
mycobacteria [41].
To our knowledge, no systematic calculations have been
performed to assess the absolute identifying power or
phylogenetic classifying utility of MALDI-MS when
applied to RNase T1 or RNase A-generated fragments from
a large 16S rRNA sequence dataset.
Hypothesis and underlying issues
We hypothesized that there is sufficient discriminatory
power in base-specific rRNA fragment compositions alone
for identification of known and previously-unknown
organisms. Moreover, the simultaneous presence of just
one to three characteristic compositions may be used for
unambiguous identification of many organisms, even in a
complex mixture. In order to investigate the occurrence of
identifying compositions in a large dataset, we performed
computational, base-specific fragmentations of a large
number of 16S rRNA sequences and investigated the identifying power of the fragments as distributed among the
organisms. Using these results, we developed a program
for simulation of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric identification of organisms selected from the oligoribonucleotide fragment libraries.

Preliminary issues involving genetic alphabet, information degeneracy, isotopes, and instrument resolution were
considered. With regard to alphabet, obvious considerations are whether DNA or RNA will be used and whether
the fragments observed will be single or double-stranded.

In nature, mass-modified nucleotides are occasionally
present in both DNA and RNA. However, post-transcriptionally modified nucleotides in ribosomal RNA are few.
Large fragments containing them are rare, and they are
typically universal to large groupings of bacteria. We
therefore know what specific modification-produced
masses to discount [42]. Finally, they are absent from in
vitro runoff and amplification products. Thus, it is only
necessary to consider the usual four-letter alphabets (A, C,
G, and T, or A, C, G, and U).
Compared to the traditional catalogs of oligoribonucleotide sequences, a catalog of fragment masses suffers from
degeneracy due to the fact that multiple distinct permuted
sequences generated by RNase digestion, e.g. AUCCG and
UACCG, have the same composition and hence the same
mass. This many-to-one relationship results in a loss of
information potentially useful for microbial identification. For RNA targets, this problem is exacerbated by the
small (one dalton) mass difference between C and U, raising the question of whether it is possible to distinguish
RNase T1 oligomers differing only in the number of C's
and U's.
Unequivocal determination of oligoribonucleotide composition based on mass alone is obviously dependent on
the resolution and accuracy of the mass spectrometer.
Koomen et al. have published an extensive review of the
requirements for accurately determining oligonucleotide
compositions from measured mass [43]. They determined
that theoretically, all monoisotopic compositions of DNA
up to 13 mers could be accurately assigned at 5 ppm mass
accuracy or better. Operating in reflectron mode, employing proper sample preparation techniques, and including
internal calibration standards, they were able to obtain 6
ppm or better accuracy on samples ranging from 5 to 13
mers. An accuracy of 6 ppm, for example, would allow
assignment to within 0.0234 Da at 3900 Da, allowing discrimination of a U to C difference in composition in a
50%-purine oligoribonucleotide of length ca. 13. MALDITOF mass spectrometry operated in linear mode with no
added internal standards is a lower resolution, lower accuracy technique, typically yielding resolution of m/∆m of
500 – 1000 and accuracy of 0.05 – 0.1% (500 – 1000
ppm) [43]. To illustrate, at an accuracy of 1000 ppm on
5000 Da (roughly the mass of a single-stranded 16-mer) a
compositional assignment may be in error by 5 Da. This
suggests that, though any substitution involving a purine
is readily detectable, up to five substitutions of U for C or
vice-versa might be indistinguishable within this hypothetical 16-mer. To address this issue experimentally,
studies relying on 16S rRNA RNase T1 fragments will
either need to be done at the highest accuracy and resolution routinely attainable or an alternative protocol will be
needed wherein the mass distinction between C and U is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/117

enhanced. Alternatively, a statistical approach based on
the simultaneous observation of multiple mass-fragments
observed in combination may be able to unambiguously
identify a microorganism even if the C/U distinction is
not readily made. Oligoribonucleotides generated by
RNase A will internally contain only G and A, which are
readily distinguished and hence would not present a
problem.
A core question that faced the original RNase T1 fragment
cataloging approach was the oligoribonucleotide length
at which a match between two organisms reflected actual
sequence similarity as opposed to a chance occurrence.
The number of fragments that exist for any length, n,
increases as 4n. RNase T1 oligoribonucleotide digestion
products, however, always contain a single G at the 3' end
of the sequence and no internal Gs. Hence, the number of
possible products is 3(n-1), which for length six is 243
products (in contrast to 46 = 4096 possible 6-mers). This
is significantly larger than the number of 6-mers generated by digestion of any single 16S rRNA and hence an
identical match of 6-mers (or any longer fragments)
between two 16S rRNAs is likely to reflect actual sequence
identity rather than chance. This result was borne out by
subsequent examination of complete sequences. However, the number of different mass compositions is significantly less than the number of unique sequences. It is
determined by the number of 4 elements chosen n at a
time with replacement:
 4 + n − 1  (n + 3)! (n + 3)(n + 2)(n + 1)
4 choose n ( with replacement) = 

=

n!3!

(1)

where ! denotes factorial [44]. For instance, the number of
unique compositions for the complete set of possible 10
mers is 13!/(10! × 3!) or 286, which is much less than the
410 = 1,048,576 unique sequences. Because an RNase T1
oligoribonucleotide will always end in G, the number of
possible compositions of length n can be expressed as:

(n + 1)!
n(n + 1)

(n − 1)!2!

where n is still the full length of the oligoribonucleotide.
RNase A fragments will end in either U or C and contain
only preceding internal A's or G's. The number of possible
compositions (not sequences) in this case can be
expressed as:

2n!

Comparison of numbers of unique polyisotopic oligoribonucleotide masses actually occurring in digests of 16S
rRNA versus possible masses. The number of unique polyisotopic oligoribonucleotide masses in the actual RNase T1 and A
catalogs are presented. The unique polyisotopic oligoribonucleotide masses in the theoretical sets are calculated from all possible RNase T1 and RNase A oligos and with consideration for the natural isotopic distribution. Only carbon and oxygen isotopes and the resultant oligoribonucleotide masses above a 50% maximum relative intensity are considered. The counts of
RNase T1-generated oligoribonucleotide more than 26 nt long are not shown.

otides have more unique sequences and accordingly
potentially unique masses. As a result, a mass catalog generated with RNase T1 digestion is more informative and
thus more useful for bacterial identification than an
RNase A catalog. Isotopic distributions of fragment
masses were also calculated. In this calculation only isotopes of carbon and oxygen were considered and only
peaks of more than 50% maximum relative intensity were
cataloged (see Methods, pg 32). Table 1 also shows, as
expected, that inclusion of isotopic elements increases the
number of masses in the catalogs without changing the
number of distinct oligoribonucleotide alphabetic compositions.
In terms of distinct sequences, the oligoribonucleotide
population distributions of digestion products of different lengths (Figure 1) are similar for the two enzymes. The
total number of digestion products produced is at maximum for mononucleotides (many copies of each mononucleotide are produced) and a gradual decrease is
observed as length increases. Less than 1% of the oligoribonucleotides produced by RNase T1 contain more than
12 bases, and less than 1% of RNase A-generated oligoribonucleotides are longer than 8-mers. Although the oligoribonucleotide mass distributions of digestion products

of different lengths are also similar for the two enzymes,
they are markedly different from both the sequence population distributions (Figure 1) and the predicted number
of possible compositions. Referring to Figure 2, in the
mass catalogs resulting from RNase T1 or RNase A digestion of a typical 16S rRNA sequence, the number of distinct oligoribonucleotide masses initially increases as the
oligoribonucleotide length increases, peaks around 14mers, and then gradually decreases as the length increases
further. In contrast, the overall trend of the mass counts
based on theoretical composition is to increase with the
oligoribonucleotide length.
At small oligonucleotide lengths, the number of predicted
RNase (both A and T1) generated oligoribonucleotides
derived from the average organism greatly exceeds the
number of possible compositions for that oligoribonucleotide length, such that nearly all catalogs will be similar,
and nearly complete. As can be seen from Supplementary
Table 1, Sections III and IV [see Additional file 1], which
take into account all isotopes above a 50% maximum
intensity (see Methods), the 6-mers represent an important "cross-over" point for RNase T1 digestion. (Column F,
sections I and II tabulate possible monoisotopic masses,
while column F, sections III and IV tabulate the number

A 'Y' in column I indicates that a uniquely identifying RNase T1 oligoribonucleotide composition was found that was not present in any of the other
1,920 organisms sampled. A 'Y' in Column II or III indicates that two or three masses respectively were found that when taken together are
uniquely identifying. An "N" indicates that the calculation did not yield a one, two, or three peak signature. "-" indicates that further determinations
were not necessary.

of all possible distinct isotopic masses). On average, there
will be less 6-mer (or larger) oligoribonucleotides
observed in a 16S rRNA digest than there are possible
compositions. Specifically, in a RNase T1 digest of an average organism's 16S rRNA, one would observe 19 6-mers
while there are 42 possible isotopic masses, and the presence of particular oligoribonucleotide masses is therefore
informative. For RNase A digestion, the turning point also
occurs at 6-mers with 15 observed and 24 different possible isotopic masses. Longer fragments are even more distinguishing (Supplementary Table 1, column G) [see
Additional file 1]. For example, the 9-mers represent
another magnitude in discrimination with only one in ten
predicted to occur. That is, it is an order of magnitude
more likely that a matching-composition 9-mer shared
between two organisms represents true underlying
sequence identity than random chance. The 1-in-100
level, at which one would expect to observe less than 1%
of possible compositions from the average organism,
occurs for 12-mers in both the RNase A and the RNase T1
catalog. Detection of these and longer oligoribonucleotides is therefore highly informative.

The identifying power of the method is greatly enhanced
by considering conjunctions of multiple detections, e.g.
the odds of observing both a specific 11-mer and a specific
12-mer composition in a single digest. Referring to Supplemental Table 1, section III (which takes into account
isotopic distribution) [see Additional file 1], for RNase T1
generated 11- and 12-mers, this should be approximately
0.018 × 0.007 or 1 in 7,936, which is more than the total
number of organisms under consideration (1,921). This
illustrates the oligonucleotide lengths which give useful
discrimination even under the degeneracy that results
from measuring composition (mass) instead of sequence.
We have therefore identified a critical informative oligoribonucleotide length, the "1-in-10 level", reached at
length 9 for both RNase T1 and RNase A. Shorter oligoribonucleotides are so commonly produced as to be relatively uninformative, and so only masses exceeding
approximately 3,000 Da need to be considered. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 1, very few oligoribonucleotides
longer than 20-mers will result from a complete digestion.
Therefore, the mass-range of interest is from 3,000 to
6,000 Da. This mass-range is in stark contrast to other
approaches that require unambiguous determination of

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:117

the masses of much large nucleic acids (PCR products or
even restriction digest products)
In accordance with earlier results of oligoribonucleotide
sequence cataloging [20,22], catalogs of all the masses
above these thresholds that are produced by digestion of
a particular 16S rRNA will cumulatively define essentially
any organism. Since the masses of interest can be determined either experimentally for an unknown organism or
by analysis of a known 16S rRNA sequence, such mass catalogs can be used to determine the genetic affinity (that is,
phylogenetic position based on well established 16S
rRNA sequence similarity) of any unknown organism
within the context of all known 16S rRNA sequences.
Such mass catalogs would primarily be constructed using
pure or nearly pure cultures, but they would also be useful
in identifying organisms in mixtures.
Recognition of target organisms by characteristic peaks
In many practical applications, the problem will be to
determine whether a particular organism or group of
organisms is present in a complex sample. In this case,
rather than seeking all the masses in the spectrum that
together characterize the organism of concern, the better
approach may be to seek specific masses that are essentially unique to that organism or a particular phylogenetic
groups of organisms. Since different molecular masses of
the 16S rRNA fragments correspond to different peaks in
the spectrum, every bacterium potentially has a signature
peak or set of signature peaks by which it can be uniquely
identified. Even if the mass-range of interest is broadened
to include all 6-mers and above, as we provide motivation
here, the range of ~1,800 to 6,000 Da (6- to 20-mers) is
relatively narrow and well within the necessary capabilities of current instrumentation for discrimination of a
large number of organisms.

RNase T1 and RNase A digestions of prokaryotic 16S
rRNAs are not equally informative for characteristic-peak
identification. For example, 140 (7.3%) of the 1,921
prokaryotes under consideration can be uniquely identified by a single RNase T1-generated oligoribonucleotide
mass while only 27 (1.4%) can be identified by unique
masses generated by the RNase A. The superiority of
RNase T1 catalog stems from the higher specificity of
RNase T1. Similarly, significantly more bacteria can be
uniquely identified by using multiple molecular weights
of the RNase T1-generated oligoribonucleotides together:
1,027 (53.5%) by double peaks and 1392 (72%) by triple
peaks. Table 2 shows a representative sampling of the
organisms that may be identified by the observation of
just one to three characteristic masses generated by RNase
T1 digestion. For example, Camplyobacter helveticus NCTC
12470 and Francisella tularensis can be uniquely distinguished by at least one RNase T1 oligoribonucleotide from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/117

the other 1,920 organisms sampled, and thus in theory
more oligoribonucleotides are not needed to identify
them. Mycobacterium tuberculosis does not have an RNase
T1 oligoribonucleotide or a combination of two of them
that can be used to uniquely distinguish it from other
1,920 organisms sampled. However, a unique combination of three RNase T1 oligoribonucleotides can be used
for unambiguous identification.
Identification of dominant bacteria in mixtures – effects of
mass resolution
Although environmental samples contain numerous
organisms, in many cases there are likely to be only a
modest number of organisms that are dominant and metabolically-active enough to contribute a large fraction of
the rRNA present. A mass spectrum of a total 16S rRNA
sample isolated from such an environment will often
yield a modest number of dominant peaks standing out
from a large number of background peaks when digested
with a ribonuclease. While direct mass spectrometric analysis of the total RNA of such a sample might yield quantitative information (at least in relative terms) about
metabolic activity, the sensitivity of current MALDI instruments generally requires pre-amplification by PCR. Most
commonly this has been followed by transcriptional runoff (and thereby further amplification) by phage polymerases (e.g. T7, SP6, or T3) and a return to the manipulation
of RNA. Universally conserved primers would be
employed to amplify the total rDNA population. In theory, so long as little bias is introduced by the PCR, the
final RNA concentrations should reflect the original
genomic DNA population in the mixture. This, however,
may not be reflective of the metabolic activity (number of
ribosomes) of the population. One solution would be to
employ "linear" RNA amplification commonly used in
gene-expression microarray protocols [45]. The practical
considerations of DNA or RNA amplification may therefore represent an important difference in systems
designed for identification (detectors) versus metabolic
monitoring. Regardless of amplification steps, without
additional sample preparation (see Discussion) or organism-specific PCR (recall the limitations of organism-specific hybridization probing), most observed spectra will
be derived from more than one organism.

Computer simulations with different input sequences
were used to test the effectiveness of mass cataloging in
recovering the identity of the dominant species in such
mixed samples. The assumption here is that the 16S rRNA
sequences of these major organisms or their close relatives
will already be in the 16S rRNA sequence database, which
now exceeds 180,000 strains [46].
First, 16S rRNA sequences of four organisms – Acidiphilium sp. strain C-1 (Acdp. spC1), Mycoplasma sturni, strain

from the filtered set of 1,921 prokaryotes were randomly
selected to be mixed into a virtual sample. Two parameters, RES and WIN (see Methods), are used to simulate the
real resolution limitations of a mass spectrometer and to
control the number of masses selected from the entire catalog for any organism. Computer simulations were carried out with four different combinations of these
parameters (Table 3). The results show that the identification of sample bacteria is best when oligoribonucleotide
masses generated by RNase T1 digestion with RES = 1 and
WIN = 3 threshold settings are used (the third simulation). This is expected given the excellent resolution of
peaks in the spectrum. The unsatisfactory result in the first
simulation (with RES = 1 and WIN = 1), underlines the
importance of WIN, the parameter controlling how many
catalog masses are selected for each observed mass. In the
case of the first simulation, even though the (simulated)
resolution is very good, fewer informative catalog masses
occur because WIN is small, and the resulting identifications were far from ideal. The result of the second simulation shows that sample identification is at its worst when
the mass spectrometry experiment has low resolution
(RES = 5) and the identification program uses little information from the mass catalog (WIN = 1). The last simulation shows that when RES = 5 and WIN = 3 the
identification was surprisingly good given the low resolution. This finding is significant, as it demonstrates that a
well-chosen value of WIN can substantially improve any
problem of low resolution.
To find out if the proposed method can correctly determine the genetic affinity (nearest relatives) of a 16S rRNA

that was not used to make the mass catalog, we selected
the 16S rRNA from Nitrosospira sp. Strain L115 (Nss.
spL115). This organism was originally excluded from the
data set because its length (1399 nt) is less than the criterion used (1400 nt). The three closest relatives found in
the 1921 organism data set using RNase T1 oligoribonucleotide mass catalogs with RES = 5 and WIN = 3 were Nss.
multi5 (92.72%), Nss. spT7 (92.86%), and Nss. spD11
(94.70%). The substantive sequence variations found
between Nss. spL115 16S rRNA and the sequences from
Nss. multi5, Nss. spT7, and Nss. spD11 in the multiple
sequence alignment (data not shown) indicate that
Nitrosospira sp. Strain L115 is similar to but also distinctively different from these three species of Nitrosospira.
Together, these two results show that 16S rRNA oligoribonucleotide mass catalogs can in principle be used to determine the genetic affinity of "unknown" bacteria.
These initial results provide a method for determining the
genetic affinity of organisms recovered from mixed population samples. Any organism in the data base that closely
resembles an organism that is actually present in a sample
will in most cases be strongly indicated. It necessarily will
typically not be clear if more than one strain or possibly
species of that type is actually present. Moreover, the precise identity of what is actually present will likely also not
be unambiguously determined by this method alone. In
many cases background information, previous experience
or other tests will allow the resolution of such ambiguities
for a given system.

Discussion
For this study we implicitly assumed that the ribonuclease
reactions would be taken to completion, i.e. no internal G
residues would remain after RNase T1 digestion, and no

Page 9 of 16

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:117

internal pyrimidines remain after RNase A treatment. In
principle, ribosomal RNA structure might protect certain
regions from complete ribonuclease digestion without
denaturation, but in practice incomplete digestion was
never a problem with the original experimental 16S rRNA
cataloging procedure. If incomplete digestion were a
problem it might be readily dealt with by increased
enzyme concentration, reaction times, and addition of
mild denaturants and/or heat to improve the yield of the
complete products.
Although approximately 1% of bases in the naturally
occurring 16S rRNA are known to be post-transcriptionally modified [47] and therefore have unexpected masses,
the possible presence of such modified nucleotides was
not considered here, for two reasons. First, it is known
that very few modifications occur in the larger RNase fragments (length 9 or more). In addition, since the fragments
that contain the modifications and the modification itself
are typically highly conserved, it would be straightforward
to identify them and make the needed mass adjustment.
Also, because in vitro transcription is likely be used to generate sufficient 16S rRNA to meet the sensitivity limits of
contemporary MALDI instruments the actual samples will
not contain the biological modifications.
Although it has already been shown that sufficient ribosomal RNA can be isolated for direct enzymatic manipulation and detection in a MALDI instrument [48], the utility
of mass spectrometry in characterizing 16S rRNA would
be greatly improved if one could more readily distinguish
cytosine and uracil, which have very similar masses. This
has typically been accomplished by first converting the
mixture of 16S rRNAs in a sample to DNA templates by
amplification and then using T7 runoff transcription to
synthesize a larger quantity of a highly purified RNA with
a nonstandard mass-modifying base [39,49]. If the massmodification is at the 2' position, e.g. deoxyuracil instead
of uracil, it increases the stability of the fragments produced and makes cleavage with RNase A monospecific.
This would result in many additional and valuable unique
masses of length 9 or more in the RNase A catalog. Incorporation of 2'-modified bases is accomplished through a
commercially available mutant RNA polymerase (R&DNA
polymerase, Epicenter) that can incorporate various noncanonical 2'-ribonucleotides composed of rNMPs (ribonucleotide-monophosphates), dNMPs (deoxyribonucleotide-monophosphates), modified 2'-NMPs or of mixed
dNMP/rNMP or 2'-modified-NMP/rNMP compositions
[50,51].
While this approach is certainly beneficial, the ideal basespecific fragments would have no remaining internal
ribose moieties such that the final products would be stable against further non-specific cleavage or hydrolysis. In

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/117

our hands, substituting more than one dNTP or 2'-modified NTP substrate for the natural rNTPs in the transcription reaction has so far resulted in insufficient yield to
obtain a good MALDI-TOF signal to noise ratio or full
length transcripts are not obtained, complicating the spectra. Another solution might be to employ a mutant DNA
polymerase capable of incorporation of a single RNA base
[52-54]. Finally, run-off transcription using amino-allyl U
(aaU) is well known and has been used by us and others
for incorporation of a reactive site for fluorescent labeling.
Because the aminoallyl group is not a "bulky" modification (∆m = 55.08 Da), aaUTP can be completely substituted for standard UTP in a transcription reaction with
full-length product still being obtained. The standard fragments in a RNase T1-digest of natural E. coli 16S rRNA had
nearest mass neighbors of 0.985 Da (the U/C difference in
mass) while the amino-allyl modified fragments had
nearest neighbors of 8.013 Da apart. That is, the massmodification has the effect of expanding the mass spectrum. Before modification, the E. coli masses of interest
ranged from 1938.17 – 4502.72 Da, and after aaU substitution the corresponding oligoribonucleotides had
masses in the range 1993.25 – 5349.42 Da. Thus, while
absolute mass did not increase greatly (which would be a
detriment to resolution) nearest-neighboring peaks are
distanced from one another by over 8 Da. Our simulations using amino-allyl U mass modification effectively
result in resolution at three residues instead of two as is
currently the case with RNase T1 and naturally occurring
bases. Alternative strategies of making the C/U distinction
such as the use 2'-methyl C and RNase A, for example,
would result in the same level of alphabetic resolution.
If two cleavage reactions are used at the same time the
effect is to drastically reduce the information content as
each fragment produced in one reaction is further cleaved
by the second. Two cleavage reactions could conceivably
be performed in parallel and the results merged. We have
effectively simulated that by exploring separate results for
RNAse T1, RNAse A and the amino-allyl U incorporation
for enhanced C/U distinction. So instead of examining the
number of organisms that can be identified by using 1, 2,
3 masses etc. from a single digestion one could instead
choose masses from a larger catalog of masses. The main
advantage would be the availability of a larger number of
discriminating masses to choose from.
Since PCR and T7 transcription may fail to amplify 16S
rRNA completely, we investigated the minimum length of
truncated 16S rRNA that can still be identified by this
mass spectrometry approach. For this purpose, 16S rRNA
of Nitrosospira sp. Strain L115 was truncated from its 5' end
and 3' end separately, 10 nt a time up to 89 times – thus,
the shortest truncated 16S rRNA is 509 nt long with 890
nt lost from either end. Identification of each truncated

16S rRNA was subsequently simulated. The results (Figure
3 and 4) show that after 880 nt were truncated from the
5'-end (519 nt left), or up to 700 nt truncated from the 3'end (699 nt left), the proper close relatives could still be
identified, although with a fractional representation (50–
60%). In both cases, the representation decreased linearly
as the truncation increased. The linearity of the decrease
reflects the uniform distribution of characteristic oligoribonucleotides in 16S rRNAs.
Von Wintzingerode et al. [40] have previously argued that
base-specific fragments from full-length 16S rDNA (or
rRNA) would "crowd" real spectra making them too difficult to interpret. If this in fact proves to be the case, it is
fortunate that several highly-conserved regions in 16S
exist that will allow the 16S sequence to be divided into
several amplicons, each representing approximately one
third of the sequence [55]. Indeed, if PCR is used as discussed above, appropriate selection of several primers can
yield full-length coverage of the 16S rDNA sequence for
most organisms [36,56]. This divide-and-conquer
approach would also improve the analysis, as matching
masses when two catalogs are compared will be known to
be generated from equivalent variable subregions of 16S
rDNA (PCR amplicon lying between two universally conserved sequences). In addition, analysis of smaller subregions of 16S may reduce the critical informative length to
eight, thereby increasing the information obtained. Thus,
the calculations described here for whole 16S rRNA molecules can only be more favorable if variable subregions
instead of whole molecules are actually used to generate
mass catalogs. Given that some nucleic acid amplification
strategy would likely be employed and because MALDI
acquisition is so rapid, there would be little time penalty
associated with dividing the experiment into the analysis
of fragments derived from several different PCR amplicons. Clearly it should be possible and beneficial to identify the most "mass-distinctive" sequence regions of 16S
and we have developed preliminary tools for doing so. We
also believe it is equally important to identify sequence
regions which are "universally" amplifiable, so that broad
organism coverage can be attained in the same assay.
Exactly how to deal with the organism-multiplexed spectra that might result is an experimental issue outside the
scope of this paper, however, the problem of mixtures in
mass spectrometry has been approached [57,58] and protocols are also feasible for "sorting by dilution" as we discuss below.
The effort described above to understand the potential
utility of a mass cataloging approach in the analysis of a
mixed sample with multiple unknown dominant species
suggests that the approach is in fact very promising. At
first sight, one might be disappointed by the modest
number of strains that can be recognized by a single peak.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/117

However, it is imperative to understand that 16S rRNA has
its greatest resolving power at the genus and higher levels
of genetic relation. Comparison of 16S rRNA sequences is
definitely not the method of choice for distinguishing virulent and avirulent strains, etc. It is, however, the primary
method to determine the genetic affinity of an unknown
organism. It is always effective to the genus level and in
most cases can distinguish species. However, when multiple strains of essentially the same species are examined
there frequently is little or no variation in the underlying
RNA sequence itself [59,60]. Hence, mass catalogs of two
strains of the same species will frequently be identical and
no single mass or set of masses would distinguish them.
As more and more sequences are added to the databases
there will inevitably be multiple strains of essentially
every species. The solution to this problem will be to preprocess the data in order to identify all the strains in the
database whose 16S rRNA sequences are effectively identical (e.g. within fifteen sequence changes in a two-way
comparison) as a species cluster. The mass approach
would then be considered successful when assignment to
one of these species clusters is possible. Since no such preprocessing was used here and many species clusters were
likely present, the results given are essentially a worst-case
scenario.
The assumption here is also that most observed spectra
will be due to a complex organism mixture. Approaches
such as "dilution-to-extinction", however, have been
described in which replicate spectra are usually due to a
single organism in the mixture [36]. The essence of the
method is to dilute the total genomic DNA prior to input
in the initial PCR step such that, on average, each PCR has
a single molecular template. Replicate, "organism-pure"
spectra are then observed, and relative organism abundances may be reported. In consideration of the complete
fragment pattern of, say, 6-mers and above, a wide variety
of statistical techniques may be appropriate for analysis of
the acquired spectra including principle component analysis, pattern recognition algorithms, correlations, convolutions, or transforms, and we have promising initial
results on using novel spectral comparison metrics for this
purpose. Conceptually, the approach described here relies
on comparing observed mass-spectra to pre-calculated virtual spectra much resembling barcodes. Because time-offlight spectra are inherently digitized, pre-processing and
comparison to virtual mass spectra would be automated.
It may become convenient to give the calculated, barcodelike spectra some finite and practical peak-width. Calculated fragment patterns could then be correlated through
the observed spectra and a confidence index for the presence of each organism could be derived. In such an
approach, closely related organisms are likely to give similar correlation coefficients or confidence indices with calculated spectra, so an iterative return to the mass spectrum

or a closer inspection of a particular mass range may be
warranted.

Conclusion
A computational assessment of the feasibility of using
mass spectrometry of fragmented rRNAs to determine the
genetic affinity of unknown bacteria in monocultures and
mixtures was undertaken. Mass catalogs of RNase-generated fragments of 16S rRNA were shown to be extremely
promising for this purpose. When full-length sequences
digested with RNase T1 were considered, it was found that
essentially all fragments of length ten or more will be
informative. The approach would be able to take advantage of the natural amplification associated with rRNA
and will be ideal in situations such as long-duration space
flight where reliance on sequencing would be unrealistic.
Although not yet fully explored, it appears that the
approach will be effective with mixtures as well. It is also
clear that enhancements such as improvement in the distinction between cytosine and uracil and the possible use
of subregions of the RNA may further improve performance.

Methods
16S rRNA sequence dataset selection
16S rRNA sequences from 7,322 prokaryotic organisms
were obtained from RDP Release 7.1 [46]. These
sequences are of varying quality – some were fully determined in terms of both the length and every position of
the sequence while others are either partially determined
and/or contain undetermined positions. Any sequence
having less than 1,400 nucleotides (full length 16S is typically 1,542 nucleotides) or undetermined nucleotides
was filtered out resulting in a set of 1,921 high-quality 16S
rRNA sequences.
In silico endoribonuclease digestion
The sequences of the oligoribonucleotides that would be
produced by RNase T1 or RNase A digestion of the 1,921
rRNA sequences were generated by a computer program.
During the in silico digestion process, for each 16S rRNA
the set of oligoribonucleotides produced was tabulated
and analyzed. The length, frequency of occurrence, and
isotopic mass of each fragment was cataloged. To circumvent the problem caused by similar molecular masses of
uracil and cytosine, it was sometimes assumed that 5-(3aminoallyl)-uracil was used instead (∆m = 55.08 Da).
Post-transcriptionally modified nucleotides were not considered. Due to their rarity, oligoribonucleotides generated from the 5' and 3' ends of 16S rRNAs were excluded
from further consideration. Only the relative abundances
of carbon and oxygen isotopes were used to calculate the
isotopic mass distribution of each oligoribonucleotide.
This simplification gives a satisfactory approximation
with the advantage of significantly reducing computa-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/117

tional complexity and run times. Only the resulting isotopic masses of more than 50% of the maximum signal
intensity were retained. In general, this resulted in the
monoisotopic mass and at least one to two "daughter"
masses being retained in the catalog. Two auxiliary data
structures, which map each 16S rRNA to the set of oligoribonucleotide masses that it can generate and each oligoribonucleotide mass to the set of 16S rRNAs that it can be
generated from, respectively, were also derived from the
oligoribonucleotide catalog to facilitate downstream analysis.
Determination of unique singlet, doublet, and triplet mass
identifiers
To tabulate the minimum number of characteristic masses
necessary to distinguish an organism (see Table 2), masses
that were found exclusively in a single organism were
recorded. For signature doublets and triplets, exhaustive
intersections were taken of the sets of all of the possible
organisms that might have contributed each mass. As a
simplified example, consider that after digestion of 20
sequences (organisms) only 7 masses, m1 through m7
were present in the RNase T1-generated library. For each of
the 7 masses in the library, a set of organisms, set A
through set G contributing that RNase T1 fragment was
recorded. To identify a unique doublet exclusively
"owned" by an organism, all pairwise intersections of the
organism sets, AnB, AnC, ..., BnC, BnD, ... FnG, was taken.
These two-fragment organism lists were, naturally, shorter
than the lists of organisms containing single fragments,
reflecting the greater identifying specificity of mass-doublets. When a pairwise intersection contained only one
organism, the mass-doublet was recorded as a unique
identifier. Similarly, unique mass-triplets were identified
by taking all of the triple intersections AnBnC, AnBnD, ...,
EnFnG to produce reduced lists of all organisms containing all three of those fragments. Once an intersection
yielded a set containing only one organism, the corresponding masses and the organism were recorded. It is
noteworthy that there may exist other unique doublets or
triplets for a given organism, but only the first ones
encountered (working in increasing mass order) were
recorded in the present work, tending to favor the lowermass fragments. The trivial cases of a singlet unique to a
particular organism, paired with any other masses to form
a unique doublet or triplet, were ignored. The algorithm
can also identify quartets and higher order intersections,
albeit at a rapidly increasing computational cost.
Simulated Identification of sample bacteria
To simulate the identification of sample bacteria by 16S
rRNA fragment mass spectrometry, several 16S rRNA
sequences were selected to make a virtual sample. The
sample 16S rRNAs were then treated in silico with RNase
T1 to generate a pool of different oligoribonucleotides.

(RNase A was not used for sample bacteria identification.)
This pool of oligoribonucleotide sequences is in turn
mapped into a collection of isotopic oligoribonucleotide
masses. Conversely, each individual oligoribonucleotide
mass may be attributed to a number of bacteria.
To simulate the resolution limitation of mass spectrometry in reality, on the simulated spectrometry chart mass
peaks that are closer to each other than a preset resolution
threshold (RES, ~1–5 Da) are merged into one peak that
centers at the averaged masses of componential peaks.
After merging, to select nearby catalog masses for each
sample mass a second window threshold (WIN, ~1–3 Da)
is used. If the absolute difference between the sample
mass and a catalog mass is less than this threshold, then
that catalog mass is selected. The fraction representation
of bacterium i in the selected catalog mass distribution is

all data for RNase digestions of sequences under consideration including:
Average Number of Oligo of a given length per 16S, and Average Number
of Oligo per 16S per Number of Possible Masses. These data are presented
for both RNase A and RNase T1 digestion with and without isotopic distribution taken into consideration (see text).

The sample agent identification program gives a list of all
the bacteria and their corresponding fractional representations in the sample spectrum. In addition, the program
allowed user-defined adjustment of the instrumental
(MALDI-TOF) resolution to determine the discriminatory
power of the approach using spectra ranging from idealized, atomic peaks to spectra having finite, practical peak
widths.

Authors' contributions
ZZ wrote the programs for generating the results described
here, carried out initial and new analyses of the data, created the initial draft manuscript, and revised the manuscript prior to its submission. GWJ conceived of the
approach for quickly determining the unique mass-doublets and triplets, collected relevant literature, and
expanded and revised the manuscript. GEF oversaw the
design of the programs, introduced the idea of critical
length, and prepared the final manuscript. RCW conceived the study, and participated in its design and coordination and helped to draft the manuscript. All authors
read and approved the final manuscript.
