Abstract
Background: Long Terminal Repeats retrotransposons (LTR elements) are ubiquitous Eukaryotic
transposable elements (TEs). They are considered to be one of the major forces underlying plant
genome evolution. Because of relatively high evolutionary speed, active transposition of LTR
elements in the host genomes provides rich information on their short-term history. As more and
more genomes, especially those of closely related organisms, have been sequenced, it is possible to
perform global comparative study of their LTR retrotransposons to reveal events in the history.
Results: The present research is designed to investigate important evolutionary events in the
origin of Asian cultivated rice through the comparison of LTR elements. We have developed
LTR_INSERT, a new method for LTR elements discovery in two closely related genomes. Our
method has a distinctive feature that it is capable of judging whether an insertion occurs prior or
posterior to the divergence of genomes. LTR_INSERT identifies 993 full-length LTR elements,
annotates 15916 copies related with them, and discovers at least 16 novel LTR families in the
whole-genome comparative map of two cultivated rice subspecies. From the full-length LTR
elements, we estimate that a significant proportion of the rice genome has experienced intersubspecies nonreciprocal recombination (ISNR) in as recent as 53,000 years. Large-scale samplings
further support that more than 15% of the rice genome has been involved in such recombination.
In addition, LTR elements confirm that the genome of O. sativa ssp. indica and that of japonica
diverged about 600,000 years ago.
Conclusion: A new LTR retrotransposon identification method integrating both comparative
genomics and ab initio algorithm is introduced and applied to Asian cultivated rice genomes. At
whole-genome level, this work confirms that recent ISNR is an important factor that molds modern
cultivated rice genome.

Background
The origin (domestication) of Asian cultivated rice has
intrigued the science community for decades and is still
hotly debated. At DNA level, origin means the beginning
of the sequences of agricultural important loci. It is well

established that besides vertical transmission of genetic
material from parent to offspring, horizontal process that
genetic information move across mating barriers plays
important role in the genome evolution [1]. In rice species, it is widely accepted that horizontal process such as

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:565

gene flow and introgression have occurred among O.
sativa, O. nivara and O. rufipogon; and many studies of
population genetics, e.g. see reviews in [2,3], have
explored horizontal process between cultivated and wild
rice. However, few researches have focused on globally
investigating, from the angle of genome comparison, the
horizontal process between indica and japonica, the two
reproductively isolated subspecies of O. sativa. The difficulties come from at least two aspects: firstly, although
horizontal process makes target sites showing higher conservation than it should be, observed high conservation
does not necessarily the result of horizontal process
because low substitution rate will also lead to that, as in
the case of ultraconserved sequences in animals [4,5]. Secondly, two subspecies have relatively short history, thus
the statistical analysis of slowly evolving sites such as
genes may brings biased results because of too small
number of substitutions. Therefore it is important to find
proper material to perform the investigation.
TEs are mobile repetitive DNA that have been found in all
eukaryotic genomes investigated so far [6-9]. LTR retrotransposons are class I TE that transpose in a "copy and
paste" mode via intermediate RNA. The typical structural
characters of an LTR retrotransposon include: (1) two
highly similar LTR sequences; (2) 4–6 bp target site
repeats (TSR) at 5' and 3' ends; (3) primer binding site
(PBS) downstream of 5' LTR and polypurine tract (PPT)
upstream of 3' LTR; (4) protein domains important for
transposition [10]. They are predominant components of
large plant genomes and their amplification and deletion
have been taken as one of the major forces underlying the
remarkable variation of plant genome size [11-14].
Historical information in full-length LTR elements allows
one to trace the birth date and substitutions in elements.
If a LTR element inserts in a non-conserved region prior to
the divergence of two genomes but its descendants show
significant higher conservation than expected, the region
must be involved in recently recombination that made
alleles in two genome identical (see below). In addition,
because of relatively high evolutionary speed, the amplification of LTR retrotransposons in short period makes
them ideal markers to study short-term evolution. With
the two features, LTR elements can be used to test recent
horizontal process between closely related genomes.
This report is designed to explore important events in the
evolution of Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) from
the angle of whole-genome comparison of LTR retrotransposons, with emphasis on revealing the ISNR between
indica and japonica. We have developed LTR_INSERT to
discover LTR retrotransposons in two related genomes.
Unlike other methods, besides reporting the structure and
location, LTR_INSERT tells whether an element inserts
prior or posterior to the divergence of two genomes. By

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/565

applying LTR_INSERT to indica and japonica genome
[15,16], we identified 993 full-length LTR elements,
annotated 15916 copies related with them, and discovered at least 16 novel LTR families. We found that many
of these elements had significantly higher degree of
sequence conservation than expected and that such high
conservation was caused by ISNR. The subsequent largescale sampling of protein-coding genes and random
genomic sites showed that the phenomenon was not
restricted to LTR retrotransposons and at least 15% of the
genome was involved in ISNR in the recent past. In addition, LTR elements provided two independent evidences
to confirm that two genomes diverged about 600,000
years ago.

Results and discussion
Overview of LTR retrotransposons identified by
LTR_INSERT
A pair of allelic shared LTR retrotransposons is two highly
similar elements that are found at the same locus in two
closely related genomes. In contrast, if an element is
present in one genome but its counterpart absent in the
other, it is called an allelic specific element (Figure 1).
Usually, allelic shared LTR retrotransposons derive from
insertions prior to the divergence of two genomes (predivergence insertions), while specific ones though insertions posterior to that (post-divergence insertions). For
simplicity, we use specific and shared to replace allelic
specific and allelic shared sometimes in the following
description.

LTR_INSERT scanned the indica-japonica comparative map
([see Additional file 1] and Methods) and identified 993
full-length elements, including 246 (i.e. 123 pairs) shared
and 747 specific ones. Among them, 601 specific elements
were discovered in japonica and 146 in indicia.
LTR_INSERT also identified 715 allelic specific Solo-LTRs
(392 in japonica and 323 in indica) related with them.
With well-aligned flanking sequences and TSRs, most of
the solo-LTRs must derive from intra-element unequal
recombination of specific full-length elements. They also
represent post-divergence insertions because recombination between different elements usually results in soloLTR without TSR and well-aligned flanking sequences
[17]. The subsequent BLAST search (E-value: e-10)
retrieved more than 88,000 potential LTR copies related
with the full-length elements. Discarding short ones ([see
Additional file 2], section 1), we obtained a total of
15,916 LTR copies in the two genomes. In them, we
extracted 3,102 pairs of shared copies (including fulllength and truncated ones) that did not overlap with
annotated gene models. Representing LTR-related intergenic alleles in two subspecies, these copies were used to
test ISNR between two genomes (see section "Wholegenome samplings reveal that at least 15% of rice genome
has experienced ISNR" below).

Because the description of LTR elements themselves is not
the main purpose of this report, we put in appendix ([see
Additional file 2]) the detailed analysis of the rice LTR
families, including the criteria of family, the phylogenetic
analysis and the dynamics of elements. Here, we only give
a brief account of major results. We identified 195 rice
LTR families (Table S2–4) with 80 being reported for the
first time (Table S2–3). 16 of the 80 novel families (Table
S2) had no hit with any known elements in GenBank
[18], TIGR Plant Repeat Database [19], Repbase [20] and
RetrOryza [21]. Although most of the 16 families lacked
reliable long ORFs similar to know domains, some of
them were quite active. We detected the RT domains in
135 families and the phylogenetic analysis based on the
domains supported previous classification of rice LTR retrotransposons into Copia and Gypsy superfamilies (Figure S2). The investigation of the amplification pattern of
rice
LTR families in time and spacial dimensions reveals several features ([see Additional file 2], section 3): (1) LTR
retrotransposons have been active since the divergence of
two genomes. (2) Although there was five-fold more fulllength specific elements identified in japonica than in
indica, the analysis of all the LTR copies showed that their
abundance was relative balance between two lineages. (3)
80% of the post-divergence insertions were driven by 20%
of highly active families (Table S6). These predominant
families had been active in the common ancestor and the
divergence event did not significantly change their activity. (4) The distribution of LTR elements (Figure S3) was
non-random across the rice genome: the LTR density
tends to decrease from centromeric regions to 5' and 3'
ends of chromosomes. Besides centromeric neighborhoods, 5' ends of chromosomes were also LTR-dense
regions.
LTR retrotransposons reveal recent extensive inter(sub)species nonreciprocal recombination in cultivated
rice
History inside LTR retrotransposons and ISNR
Full length LTR elements store information of their transposition history in the LTRs [22,23]. When transposing,
two identical LTRs synthesize from the same template,
then they diverge with nucleotide mutations cumulating
as time elapses. Given the average rate of nucleotide substitution (denoted as r) and sequence distance (denoted
as d), insertion date (denoted as T) can be estimated by T
= d/2r. In this study, we use r = 1.3 × 10-8/site/yr, as suggested in [24]. Further more, the comparison of specific
and shared LTR elements in related species provides more
information.

Specific elements are mainly generated through postdivergence transposition events (Figure 1, Case A). Ideally, the distance between their two LTRs (denoted as din-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/565

tra)

should be less than the distance corresponding to the
divergence time (denoted as D). Besides post-divergence
insertion, the accurate deletion of a shared element in one
genome (intra-element reversible recombination) also
makes its counterpart a specific element. However, the
probability is rather low because this requires that recombination occurs at the 4–6 bp TSRs. In fact, just like insertions of LINEs and SINEs, transposition of LTR
retrotransposons is almost irreversible. Even though such
recombination occurs, it can be recognized by the age of
this element: its dintra value is greater than D now. In short,
most specific elements represent post-divergence transposition events.

Sources of shared elements can also be traced by analyzing
history information inside full-length elements. When
two elements are orthologs, the distance between them
(denoted as dinter) is just D and because the insertion
occurs prior to the divergence, dintra > D holds. Overall one
has dinter = D <dintra for orthologous shared elements (Figure 1, Case B). Indeed, when no ISNR occurs, this is
almost the unique source of shared elements because the
probability that two independent transposition events in
two species just insert into the same locus is low, the
rather that they are highly similar.
Shared elements may be converted by ISNR and are not
orthologs any more (Figure 1, Case C). In this process, an
allele in one genome is converted by its counterpart in the
other through nonreciprocal homologous recombination. We use the words "nonreciprocal homologous
recombination" according to the suggestion in Li (1997)
[25], to denote a type of recombination that "one
sequence is changed whereas the other is not". When
ISNR occurs, two alleles become identical and the history
before ISNR is removed. As a result one observes that their
pairwise distance is less than D. Specifically, if the two
alleles cover a pair of shared elements, one expect to see
dinter <D <dintra because ISNR, as a type of recombination,
does not destroy the structure of elements and dintra still
reflects the date of insertion, which occurs in the common
ancestor. LTR retrotransposons usually have relative high
evolutionary speed, so a pair of elements is highly probable converted by ISNR if its dinter value is significantly less
than D.
Theoretically, there are other possible ways to generate
shared elements, e.g. at a loci where one allele (say allele
x) contains a specific element but its counterpart (allele x')
dose not, recombination converts x' by x. In this case, the
shared pair shows dinter <dintra <D. We found that two pairs
of elements in rice (p1 and p2 in Figure 2(c) and 2(d), see
below) had such time pattern. Although small in sample
size, the two examples indicate that such type of recombination might occur in the past.

74% of the Group-B elements,. (c) dinter and dintra of the Group-B elements. Each pair of bars represent dinter (grey column) and

versus dintra of the shared pairs. The two solid lines give d = 0.006 in X- and Y- axis. The dashed line is dinter = dintra.
In short, most shared and specific elements reflect preand post- divergence transposition events, respectively.
The relationships among dinter, D and dintra give evolutionary events that generate and modify elements. We summarized the above discussion in Table 1. In practice, we infer
that one of the relations hold and corresponding event
took place in a group of elements based on high statistical
significance.
Many LTR retrotransposon-contained loci have been
converted by ISNR
We discarded elements of which LTRs were shorter than
200 bp and selected 825 (108 shared pairs and 717 specific ones) full-length elements for further analyses.

Each pair of elements has two dintra values, one from the
indica member, the other from its japonica counterpart. As

can be seen from Figure 2(a), the two values are overall
equal or close to each other in pairs. Statistical analysis
also supports this observation ([see Additional file 3] for
details). Therefore, in the following discussion, we use the
average of two values to represent dintra of each pair.
Figure 2(b) shows the distribution of the dinter values of the
108 shared pairs. This distribution is the superposition of
an unimodal distribution A and a pulse-like distribution
B. For a single splitting event and constant evolutionary
rate, dinter of orthologous alleles should be close to a normal distribution with the mean value corresponding to
the divergence date. When evolutionary rates are varied
among loci, a flatter peak may appear in the distribution.
On the other hand, when ISNR occurs with high frequency in a short period, a sharp increase should be
observed at that time. Therefore the bimodal pattern here

may be resulted from genetic material transfer on vertical
and horizontal directions, respectively. This assumption is
further supported by the following facts.
Since distribution A fitted the normal distribution N(μ =
0.0157, σ = 0.005) well (P-value = 0.98 in KolmogorovSmirnov test and 0.52 in Shapiro-wilk test), we identified
elements belong to it (called Group-A elements) by selecting pairs of which dinter values were greater than 0.0059
(the value μ – 1.96σ). A total of 66 pairs were classified as
Group-A elements and the left 42 pairs as Group-B elements (Figure 2(d)).
Unlike some previous researches to estimate divergence
date based on dintra [24,26], we directly estimate the divergence time from dinter of orthologous elements: firstly, D =
dinter holds in them because of normality of distribution A.
Secondly, we find that dinter <dintra in almost all pairs. q1
and q2 in Figure 2(d) are two execptions, but they can be
explained by random fluctuation (see below). These
observations support that Group-A pairs are orthologs
and two genomes diverged about 0.6 MYA (the date corresponding to μ = 0.0157).
Distribution B is a sharp spike at dinter = (0, 0.006) and the
following characters are found in corresponding elements: (1) All of them show dinter <dintra. (2) dinter values of
the 42 pairs are significantly (level of significance: 0.025)
less than D. (3) Most of them (88%) have dintra values
greater than D and 2/3 greater than 1 MY, the date corresponding to μ + 2σ (Figure 2(c)). In summary, the inequality dinter <D <dintra holds in most of them. Further
more, as can be seen from the insert figure in Figure 2(b),
the great majority (74%) of Group-B pairs have dinter values less than 0.0014 (53,000 years B.P.), coincident with
the time of the earliest evidence of modern human activities in South and East Asia, which are thought to be potential regions of rice domestication.

Most Group-B elements are not located in conserved
genomic regions because they have great dintra values,
which reflect that great number of mutations cumulated
in these regions. Therefore it is hard to explain their small
dinter values by conservation of loci. Because the above
analyses have shown that the majority of Group-B elements meet the features of ISNR, we propose that they
were involved in such process.
Providing more information than frequency histogram,
scatterplot allows us to see more things. Figure 2(d) shows
dinter versus dintra of the 108 pairs of shared elements.
According to the above discussions, the solid horizontal
line (dinter = 0.0059) separates pairs into Group-A (points
above the line) and Group-B (below the line). q1 and q2
are two pairs that lie above the dinter = dintra line (dashed
line). That is, their dinter > dintra. Since their dintra values are
small, dinter are close to μ and the phenomenon is only
observed in two pairs, it is reasonable to explain the 3%
outliers by random fluctuation. p1 and p2 are two pairs
located on the left of the vertical solid line, which means
they have D > dintra significantly.
They also have dintra > dinter since they are located below the
dashed line, but this relationship is not statistically significant because the sample size is rather low. Therefore, p1
and p2 might derive from inter-genome recombination of
post-divergence insertions (Table 1), but the current work
lacks enough samples to confirm this beyond doubt.
Whole-genome samplings reveal that at least 15% of rice
genome has experienced ISNR
Large-scale sampling further confirmed that the same
bimodal pattern of dinter existed in the entire genome,
including non-LTR-related regions. dinter is now defined as
the distance between any pair of alleles and no longer
restricted in shared LTR elements. Firstly, we investigated
the 3,102 intergenic LTR regions (see section "Overview of
LTR retrotransposons identified by LTR_INSERT"). Com-

paring to the shared full-length elements, the sample
capacity increased 30 folds. The distribution and percentage of group-B elements (Figure 3(a), Table 2) are clearly
consistent with Figure 2(b): a peak is located at 0.015–
0.018 and the two distributions separate at 0.005–0.006.
Next we calculated pairwise distance of intron regions of
5,502 pairs of cDNA verified genes and 19,775 pairs of
BGF annotated gene models respectively (see Methods)
and found the bimodal pattern as well (Figure 3(b) and
3(c)): the peak of distribution A is located at 0.003–0.004
and two distributions separate at 0.001–0.0015. The
investigation of coding regions gave similar results ([see
Additional file 4]).
Genes and LTR elements may not accurately tell the
boundaries of ISNR loci because they are only subregions
of the ISNR loci (Figure 1, Case C). We estimated the percentage of genomic sequences involved in ISNR by random sampling of sites in the comparative map: windows
of a certain length are randomly placed in the map and for
each window, the mean mismatches/Kb value (mismatch
density in window) is calculated. Not preferring certain
loci, the sampling provided less biased estimation of the
percentage. The calculation of mismatch density in window of 5–10 Kb in 400,000 random samplings confirmed
the bimodal distribution: distribution A and B separate at
1.5–1.8 mismatches/Kb and about 15.3%–18.7% of
genomic sequences belong to Group-B (Figure 3(d) and
Table 2).
By using a sliding window scanning the comparative map,
we obtained the distribution of presumable ISNR regions
(regions that average mismatch density ≤ 1.5/Kb) in the
rice genome. As can been seen from Figure 4, instead of
evenly distributed along the twelve pseudochromosomes,
ISNR regions are found to be more dense in chromosome
3–7, while sparse in chromosome 9–11. Our investigation
has shown that the rice LTR elements tend to be more
dence at the centromeric regions in all chromosomes (Figure S3). By contrast, ISNR regions do not occur in the centromeric regions of eleven chromosomes except
chromosome 5. These results are consistent with that cenTable 2: Proportion of Group-B sites

tromeric regions are rich in retroelements but contain
regions with suppressed recombination. Although ISNR
regions seem to appear in the centromeric region of chromosome 5, it should be caution that these highly conserved regions may actually not be in but near to that
region because the centromeric regions are hard to
sequence and we only obtained the approximate location
information of centromeres from TIGR Rice Genome
Annotation [19].
In summary, the same bimodal pattern of the distribution
of dinter appears in all cases investigated, including fulllength LTR elements, genes, intergenic and random
genomic regions with the sample capacity ranging from
one hundred to tens of thousands. The consistency indicates that a significant portion of rice genomes have experienced ISNR. The percentage is more than 15% of the rice
genome and ISNR took place with high frequency in
recent past. As the time is overlapping with the rising of
modern human, it is highly probable that ISNR is related
with the process of domestication.
It is important to emphasize that ISNR may take place
directly between two subspecies or via other related
genomes, e.g. those of wild rice. As a type of horizontal
process, ISNR provides a mechanism to spread alleles
among cultivated rice and their wild relatives. The present
research confirms that it is an important force in the evolution of rice. Because of more than 20% protein-coding
genes are belong to distribution B (Figure 3(b) and 3(c),
Table 2), ISNR might have greatly influenced the domestication of important traits. Besides evidences of this
study, a recent population genetics analysis has shown
that sh4, the grain shattering gene, is once origin and
spread in all cultivated rice via horizontal gene flow [27].
These results further indicate that ISNR, as well as other
horizontal forces, may have had impact on the domestication important traits.

Group-A elements gave that peak-A reflected the divergence of two genomes and it occurred about 0.6 MYA.
This argument can be further supported by dintra of elements. Because most of the specific elements insert posterior to the divergence of two subspecies and most shared
ones insert prior to that, so the distributions of dintra of
specific and shared elements give the upper and lower
limit of the divergence date, respectively. As shown in Figure 5(a) and 5(b), the insertion dates of specific and
shared elements naturally belonged to two periods. dintra
values are less than 0.014 in 90% of specific elements
while greater than 0.017 in the same percentage of shared
pairs. This result well supports that most specific and
shared elements represent post- and pre- divergence inser-

sequences. (b) dinter of the intron regions of 5,502 cDNA verified genes. Comparing to LTR-related loci, the average substitution rate in genic regions is 5–6 times slower. (c) dinter of the intron regions of 19,775 BGF predicted gene models. (d) Mismatch

tions, respectively. Since dintra = (0.014, 0.017) corresponds to 0.54–0.65 MYA, The fact that peak-A is located
in the period is consistent with that distribution A reflects
orthologous loci and two genomes diverged about 0.6
MYA, a greater value than some recent estimations
[24,26,28-30].
Evolutionary speed is 5–6 folds faster in LTR regions than
in genes
Analogously, the distribution A of other cases should also
represent distribution of orthologous loci. By comparing
Figure 3(b) and 3(c) to Figure 2(c) and 3(a), it is easy to
observe that the distance values corresponding to peak-A,
peak-B, and the separation of two distribution are systematically 5–6 times less in gene regions. We also find that
mean dinter value of introns and ds value of coding
sequences have no significant difference in Group-A

sequences ([see Additional file 4]). These results indicate
that mean speed of substitution in LTR-related loci is 5–6
times faster than in genic regions and the value is higher
than the estimation of [24].
Extensive ISNR in rice add puzzles to the origin of
cultivated rice
Traditionally, there are two models about the domestication of rice: the "single origin" hypothesis claims that the
cultivated rice was only domesticated once and the differentiation of two subspecies was latter than the domestication of important traits, which took place no earlier than
the beginning of agriculture [31-34]. On the other hand,
the multiple origin" hypothesis argues that domestication
occurred at least twice; two subspecies were cultivated
from diverged wild populations and their progenitors had
already diverged by the beginning of agriculture [35,36].

Figure 5 of dintra of full-length elements
Distribution
Distribution of dintra of full-length elements. (a) dintra of the 717 specific full-length elements. In more than 90% of them,
the ages are less than 0.014 (0.54 MY). (b) dintra of the 108 pairs of shared full-length elements. In 90% of them, the ages are
greater than 0.017 (0.65 MY). That two distributions separate at dintra = (0.014, 0.017) indicates that the two genomes diverged
between 0.54 and 0.65 MYA.

To date, the divergence time (or evolutionary distance) of
the two rice genomes has been widely used as the decisive
criterion for this question. Recently, researchers have tried
to estimate the distance from varied loci and the "multiple
origin" model seems to be supported by different molecular materials [26,29,37]. However, this criterion is valid
only when the influence of horizontal process is trivial. If
horizontal process was important in the early stage of
domestication, as has been shown in this report, indica
and japonica may have ancient diverged genomic "background" yet the domestication of important traits only
took place once. In other words, traits might be domesticated first in one type of rice and the other subspecies originated from some far-related wild rice which hybridized
with it and acquired these traits through ISNR. Besides
this picture, ISNR can provide multiple possibilities on
the rice domestication. For instance, groups of traits might
be independently domesticated with host genomes and
subsequently combined through ISNR to generate two
types of cultivated rice [27].
This work reveals that rice genomes are mosaic, which reconciles the once-multiple origination conflict but complicates the origin of rice: one must face distinctive histories
of traits now! To reconstruct the history of cultivated rice,
ISNR, as well as other horizontal process, must be considered. Only when both vertical and horizontal forces are
well understood, the domestication can be understood indepth.

Conclusion
We have introduced a new method, LTR_INSERT, to
detect LTR retrotransposons in two related genomes and

use them to explore the history of Asian cultivated rice. By
discriminating between pre- and post-divergence transposition events, LTR_INSERT provides rich information on
the evolution of both rice and LTR elements themselves.
Through LTR elements and whole-genome scale loci samplings, we find that at least 15% of the rice genome has
experienced ISNR in very recent past. In addition, the
analyses of LTR elements also confirm that the two rice
genomes diverged about 600,000 years B.P.. These results
clearly show that ISNR has actively participated in shaping
of the cultivated rice genome.

Methods
Genomic sequences and databases
Genomic sequences of indica, version 4 pseudochromosomes of japonica and Full-length cDNAs were downloaded from NCBI [18], TIGR [19] and KOME [38],
respectively.
Mining LTR retrotransposons in related genomes
We identified LTR retrotransposons through three main
steps: (1) Construction of a whole-genome comparative
map; (2) identification of specific and shared full-length
elements by LTR_INSERT; (3) identification of other
homologous copies including truncated ones through
similarity search.
Construction of comparative map for indica and japonica
The comparative map was constructed by marker building
and syntenic block alignment. indica genome was first
fragmented by sequencing gaps, then all longer than 5 Kb
segments were mapped to japonica with MUMmer [39]
and highly convserved (similarity > 90%) homologous

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:565

pairs were selected. These pairs, called long syntenic alleles (LSAs), established reliable correspondence between
two genomes. Subsequently, a denser marker set was constructed by adding allelic cDNA verified genes to spacer
regions of the LSAs: after eliminating redundant and short
(size < 1 Kb) entries, KOME cDNAs were mapped to
japonica pseudochromosomes, then their indica counterparts were identified by BLAT [40]. With these markers,
the two genomes were partitioned into syntenic blocks. At
last, each syntenic block was globally aligned and all the
alignments were concatenated to accomplish the map.
The detailed description of the indica-japonica comparative map is in Additional file 1.
LTR_INSERT and full-length LTR retrotransposon identification
LTR_INSERT is a new method to discover LTR retrotransposons in closely related genomes. To date, besides
homology-search methods, some ab initio LTR retrotransposon finders have been developed [41-43]. Recognizing
structural characters of elements, ab initio methods are
able to discover novel elements yet may bring high false
positive. Recently, Caspi and Pachter [44] have introduced comparative genomics to find TEs in fruit fly
genomes. Their method searches out possible insertion
events in related genomes and thus provides evolutionary
evidence to identify TEs. Based on the consideration that
combining structural and evolutionary information
would lead to highly reliable predictions of LTR elements,
LTR_INSERT was developed.

Scanning the comparative map, LTR_INSERT identified
shared and specific elements. Firstly, LTR_INSERT categorized the comparative map into two partitions: alignment
indels of proper size (≥ 100 bp) and well-aligned blocks.
Secondly, it discovered specific elements in indel neighborhoods. If an element inserted only in one genome and
the full-length structure was intact, the following signals
of transposition should be observed at the target locus
(Figure 1, Case A): (1) an alignment indel was composed
of neither more nor less than a full-length element with a
TSR at the terminal. (2) A second TSR occurred at the
other terminal of the element, and this TSR had a identical
counterpart in the other genome. (3) Flanking sequences
of this insertion aligned well. Checking all the indels of
the comparative map, LTR_INSERT selected elements that
meet above criteria as specific elements. Thus, every specific elements was supported by evidences from both
transposition event and structure. Thirdly, the algorithm
discovered shared elements in well-aligned regions by recognizing structural characters of elements. In the second
and third steps, the verification of structural characters
was performed by calling LTR_FINDER, an efficient ab initio tool for LTR element discovery we developed recently
[41]. In actual alignments, signals such as TSRs, TG-CA
box and flanking strings might be placed at incorrect posi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/565

tions by alignment algorithm. LTR_INSERT had the capability to recognize misarranged signals.
Indels that have transposition signal (2) and (3) but lack
full-length structures may be solo-LTRs originated
through intra-element recombination if they further have
proper sizes and TG-CA boxes. LTR_INSERT selected
sequences that were similar to LTRs of full-length elements and met the above standards to be specific soloLTRs.
We note that LTR_INSERT requires that flanking
sequences of elements are well-aligned, thus to insure
comparison are performed at the same locus in two
genomes. In the present research, detected elements were
kept only when 1 Kb flanking sequences of them shared >
90% identity between two subspecies.
With this strategy, the program predicted reliable fulllength LTR retrotransposons in two genomes. The method
of LTR_INSERT, i.e. "ab initio computation plus comparative genomics" can be directly applied to the comparison
of other related genomes.
Identification of other LTR copies
Other LTR copies related to full-length elements were
identified by searching against the two rice genomes using
BLASTN [45]. When one locus matched several full-length
elements, it belongs to the family of the top-hit one.
Phylogenetic and statistical analysis
dinter and dintra values of non-coding regions were calculated by PHYLIP [46] using Kimura 2 parameters model
and ds values of genes were calculated by PAML [47]. The
multi-alignment of RT domains was constructed by CLUSTALW [48] and the phylogenetic tree was drawn by
MEGA4 [49]. Statistical analyses were performed by R
[50].
Gene annotation
cDNA Verified Genes: by using the method described in
[51], we selected 5548 cDNA verified japonica genes that
have homologs in Arabidopsis thaliana. We searched out
their counterparts in indica and obtained 5502 pairs at
last.

BGF Predicted Gene Models: we annotated more than
30,000 gene models using BGF [51] in two rice genomes
and selected 19,775 pairs of alleles with complete structures in well-aligned regions of the comparative map.
