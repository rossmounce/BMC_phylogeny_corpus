Abstract
Background: Iron is an essential nutrient but can be toxic at high intracellular concentrations and
organisms have evolved tightly regulated mechanisms for iron uptake and homeostasis. Information
on iron management mechanisms is available for organisms living at circumneutral pH. However,
very little is known about how acidophilic bacteria, especially those used for industrial copper
bioleaching, cope with environmental iron loads that can be 1018 times the concentration found in
pH neutral environments. This study was motivated by the need to fill this lacuna in knowledge. An
understanding of how microorganisms thrive in acidic ecosystems with high iron loads requires a
comprehensive investigation of the strategies to acquire iron and to coordinate this acquisition with
utilization, storage and oxidation of iron through metal responsive regulation. In silico prediction of
iron management genes and Fur regulation was carried out for three Acidithiobacilli: Acidithiobacillus
ferrooxidans (iron and sulfur oxidizer) A. thiooxidans and A. caldus (sulfur oxidizers) that can live
between pH 1 and pH 5 and for three strict iron oxidizers of the Leptospirillum genus that live at
pH 1 or below.
Results: Acidithiobacilli have predicted FeoB-like Fe(II) and Nramp-like Fe(II)-Mn(II) transporters.
They also have 14 different TonB dependent ferri-siderophore transporters of diverse siderophore
affinity, although they do not produce classical siderophores. Instead they have predicted novel
mechanisms for dicitrate synthesis and possibly also for phosphate-chelation mediated iron uptake.
It is hypothesized that the unexpectedly large number and diversity of Fe(III)-uptake systems
confers versatility to this group of acidophiles, especially in higher pH environments (pH 4–5)
where soluble iron may not be abundant. In contrast, Leptospirilla have only a FtrI-Fet3P-like
permease and three TonB dependent ferri-dicitrate siderophore systems. This paucity of iron
uptake systems could reflect their obligatory occupation of extremely low pH environments where
high concentrations of soluble iron may always be available and were oxidized sulfur species might
not compromise iron speciation dynamics. Presence of bacterioferritin in the Acidithiobacilli,
polyphosphate accumulation functions and variants of FieF-like diffusion facilitators in both
Acidithiobacilli and Leptospirilla, indicate that they may remove or store iron under conditions of
variable availability. In addition, the Fe(II)-oxidizing capacity of both A. ferrooxidans and Leptospirilla

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/203

could itself be a way to evade iron stress imposed by readily available Fe(II) ions at low pH. Fur
regulatory sites have been predicted for a number of gene clusters including iron related and noniron related functions in both the Acidithiobacilli and Leptospirilla, laying the foundation for the
future discovery of iron regulated and iron-phosphate coordinated regulatory control circuits.
Conclusion: In silico analyses of the genomes of acidophilic bacteria are beginning to tease apart
the mechanisms that mediate iron uptake and homeostasis in low pH environments. Initial models
pinpoint significant differences in abundance and diversity of iron management mechanisms
between Leptospirilla and Acidithiobacilli, and begin to reveal how these two groups respond to
iron cycling and iron fluctuations in naturally acidic environments and in industrial operations.
Niche partitions and ecological successions between acidophilic microorganisms may be partially
explained by these observed differences. Models derived from these analyses pave the way for
improved hypothesis testing and well directed experimental investigation. In addition, aspects of
these models should challenge investigators to evaluate alternative iron management strategies in
non-acidophilic model organisms.

Background
Natural geomicrobiological processes and industrial operations, such as coal mining and bioleaching, can generate
extremely acidic environments (pH 1) in which insoluble
metal sulfides are converted into water-soluble metal sulfates that include extraordinarily high concentrations of
soluble iron. These concentrations can reach values as
high as 160 g/L, about 1018 higher than typically found in
circumneutral environments.
In oxygen saturated environments at neutral pH, Fe(II) is
readily oxidized to Fe(III) [1]. Thus, iron predominantly
occurs in the ferric form as poorly soluble iron hydroxides
(as low as 10–18 M at pH 7.0), rendering it basically unavailable for biological systems [2]. In contrast, under
acidic conditions Fe(II) persists for long periods of time
even in the presence of atmospheric oxygen [1] and aerobic acidophiles have to cope with the highest levels of soluble iron in nature and the threat it imposes via its
reaction with oxygen, generating free radicals that damage
macromolecules and cause cell death [3].
A number of biological processes have evolved to deal
with metal-induced threats to life including the ability to
transform [4], sequester intra- or extracellularly [5],
exclude [6] or remove [7] potentially toxic ions. In the
case of metals that are also essential micronutrients, such
as iron, concentration-dependent toxicity is coped with by
carefully balancing influx and efflux, preserving intracellular metal homeostasis [8]. In the case of iron, the
accepted view is that cells respond to iron-dependent oxidative stress by down-regulating iron uptake, promoting
its utilization and depositing surplus iron in storage proteins, as well as by mitigating the effects of emerging reactive oxygen species [9]. Most prokaryotes coordinate and
regulate these processes by means of the ferric uptake regulator Fur, which serves as a global regulator of gene
expression by responding to changes in iron availability.

In contrast to the wealth of information available for neutrophiles, many unanswered questions remain regarding
the nature and ecological distribution of the genetic determinants underlying iron management mechanisms in acidophiles. This understanding is essential for generating a
comprehensive description of the ecophysiology of these
microorganisms and for understanding their contributions to the cycling of iron in pristine environments. In
addition, microbial cycling of iron in acidic conditions is
important for understanding bioleaching of ores and the
development of remediation techniques for sites affected
by acid mine drainage or contaminated with metals from
industrial wastes including coal heaps [10]. For example,
ecological effects of the Fe(III) tolerance have been suggested to explain the dominance of Leptospirilla over
Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans [11] and of Sulfobacillus acidophilus over Acidimicrobium ferrooxidans [12] in mixed cultures oxidizing Fe(II), even if the underlying mechanisms
were not elucidated. An understanding of how microorganisms thrive in acidic ecosystems with high iron loads
requires a comprehensive investigation of the strategies to
acquire iron and to coordinate this acquisition with utilization, storage and oxidation of iron through metal
responsive regulation. It is also necessary to understand
how oxidative stress caused by iron overload is mitigated.
In this work, aspects of iron homeostasis responses are
reported for some of the major contributors to microbial
bioleaching through multiple in silico genomic comparisons of currently available completed [13] and draft
genome sequences [14-16], contrasting them with what is
already known in A. ferrooxidans [17,18]. Using bioinformatics and comparative genomic strategies, models have
been constructed for Acidithiobacilli and Leptospirilla
species for a) the genetic determinants of iron management, b) the Fur-dependent genetic regulatory network
and c) the gene complements and relevant aspects of the
iron homeostasis response.

Results
Ferrous Iron Transporter Profiles
The major route for Fe(II) acquisition in neutrophilic bacteria, including pathogens, is via the FeoB uptake system
[19]. A candidate gene with similarity to feoB with an associated upstream, experimentally validated, Fur regulatory
binding site (Fur box) has been described previously in A.
ferrooxidans [18,20]. In A. ferrooxidans, feoB is conserved in
the gene context feoABC that is typical of the Fe(II) uptake
system described in other bacteria; however, in this case,
it is preceded by a putative dedicated permease-encoding
gene, feoP. Genes with similarity to feoPABC were also predicted in Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and Acidithiobacillus
caldus. A. thiooxidans shares the same conserved context
including a predicted Fur box. In A. caldus the OprB family
porin-like protein FeoP is not contiguous with the feoABC
cluster but its upstream predicted Fur box suggests its
involvement in iron management (Figure 1A; Additional
files 1 and 2).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/203

Many organisms have secondary Fe(II) transporters
whose primary function is the uptake of other divalent
metals such as Mn(II), Mg(II) and Zn(II), but that can, in
certain circumstances, also import Fe(II). These include
the Nramp-like transporters, such as MntH [21], metalABC permeases, such as SitABCD [22] and the ZRT- and
IRT-like proteins represented in bacteria by ZupT [23].
However, only potential genes with similarity to mntH, a
proton-dependent high affinity manganese uptake permease, could be detected in the three Acidithiobacilli.
Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of
MntH demonstrates that it is conserved between A. ferrooxidans, A. thiooxidans and A. caldus and analysis of the
upstream DNA predicts the occurrence of a conserved σ70like promoter that overlaps a Fur box in A. thiooxidans and
A. caldus that align with an experimentally validated Fur
box in A. ferrooxidans (Figure 1B, Additional file 3) [20].
This suggests that mntH in the three Acidithiobacilli is regulated by Fur, as has been demonstrated in other bacteria

[24-26] and is thus likely to participate in iron transport.
This prediction awaits experimental validation.
Genes potentially encoding the FeoPABC and MntH systems were not detected in the Leptospirilla raising the
question as to how they assimilate Fe(II). One possibility
is that Fe(II) uptake is accomplished by a predicted Ftr1like permease that is absent in the Acidithiobacilli (Figure
1C). Ftr1 permeases have been shown to operate as iron
importers in conjunction with Fet3p-like multicopper oxidases (MCO) in other organisms [27]. Fet3P is a membrane glycoprotein that efficiently oxidizes Fe(II) to
Fe(III) for the subsequent transport of Fe(III) into the
cytoplasm via Ftr1p [27]. Thus, in the strict sense, these
transporters are Fe(III) permeases. In Leptospirillum sp.
group III, the Ftr1 permease ortholog, named EfeU, is
associated with a hypothetical cupredoxin that exhibits
amino acid similarity (56%) to subunit II from heme/copper-type cytochrome/quinol oxidase from Burkholderia
pseudomallei (ABN85317). In Leptospirillum sp. group II –
UBA this gene pair (EAY57254- EAY57255) is well conserved and linked to a gene encoding a hypothetical protein with a kelch domain (EAY57256). The function of
this hypothetical gene is unknown, but kelch motifs are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/203

present in other oxidases such as galactose oxidase
(pfam01344). These two other functions with oxidasetype motifs could thus be potentially involved in the oxidation of Fe(II) for dedicated EfeU Fe(III) uptake. Lack of
(known) Fe(II) transporters in this group of strict ironoxidizers could be a mechanism to evade iron stress
imposed by readily available Fe(II) ions at pH 1. Models
for the uptake of Fe(II) for the Acidithiobacilli and Leptospirilla are shown in Figure 1D.
Ferric Iron Transporter Profiles
Despite the abundant supply of soluble iron in their low
pH biotope, the Acidithiobacilli exhibit a plethora of predicted TonB-dependent Fe(III) transport systems (OMRs).
Fourteen different TonB-dependent outer membrane
Fe(III) siderophore transporter groups belonging to the
FecA-dicitrate, FhuA-hydroxymate, CirA-linear catecholate and FepA-cyclic catecholate type siderophore receptors were predicted, of which 11 are present in A.
ferrooxidans, 8 in A. thiooxidans and 7 in A. caldus (Figure
2, Additional file 1). In contrast, the Leptospirilla contain
only 3 predicted TonB-dependent outer membrane Fe(III)
siderophore receptors, all corresponding to the FecA type
of dicitrate transporters (Figure 2).

Four of the predicted transporters are found in all members of the Acidithiobacilli but are only rarely detected in
other organisms (Additional file 4). These correspond to
the FecA (FecA3) and CirA (CirA1, 2, 3) types, and are
conserved in amino acid sequence and gene context
within the Acidithiobacilli (Figure 3). For example, FecA3
exhibits 41–43% sequence similarity only to TonB
dependent receptors in the α-proteobacteria Zymomonas
mobilis ZM4 and Gluconobacter oxydans. Also, the three predicted CirA receptors exhibit similarity only to those
found in the α-proteobacterium Acidiphilium cryptum,
with which they share the same habitat. This suggests that
there is a core group of Fe(III) transporters that are found
in the Acidithiobacilli and environmentally related microorganisms that may reflect the specialized needs of these
microorganisms for Fe(III) uptake at low pH. The remaining receptors shared only by A. ferrooxidans and A. thiooxidans (FecA1 and FecA2) or by A. ferrooxidans and A. caldus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/203

(FepA1) and the additional 7 receptors that are found
uniquely in only one or other of the Acidithiobacilli
exhibit very low similarity (30–40%) with known TonB
dependent receptors indicating that they may also be specific for the Acidithiobacilli and could be used for specialized iron uptake requirements in each member of the
group (Additional file 4).
The diversity of OMRs is reflected not only in their amino
acid sequence diversity, but also in their predicted
siderophore affinities and isoelectric points (Figure 2,
Additional file 5). The OMRs of the three Acidithiobacilli
span a wide range of predicted pIs from 5.57 to 9.15, contrary to other environmentally restricted microbes including the Leptospirilla whose pIs vary in very narrow range
from 5.10 to 5.73. This observation raises intriguing questions regarding potential alternative life styles of the
Acidithiobacilli as discussed below.

In contrast to the extensive repertoire of Fe(III) receptors
exhibited by the Acidithiobacilli, Leptospirilla have only
predicted dicitrate-type siderophore receptors, two of
which, FecA8 and FecA9, are found in both Leptospirillum
sp. group II and Leptospirillum sp. group III (Figure 3).
Recent analysis of an environmental transcriptome suggests that L. ferrooxidans may also have a FecA type outer
membrane receptor [28]. This paucity of siderophore
receptors could be explained by the presence and conservation in all Leptospirilla of an EfeU-type iron transporter.
The latter may suffice for the acquisition of soluble Fe(III)
at low pH eliminating the need for high affinity iron
chelating compounds and/or cognate receptors.
Figure 3 illustrates the organization of the gene clusters in
the Acidithiobacilli and Leptospirilla encoding predicted
TonB-dependent Fe(III) siderophore OMRs and the presence of predicted Fur boxes. Whereas in most bacteria,
genes encoding ferric siderophore outer membrane receptors are clustered and expressed with ABC transporters
and TonB systems, the Acidithiobacilli and Leptospirilla
appear to have a different organization. Both families
exhibit a variety of other genes linked to the transporters
including predicted genes for enzymes, transportation
and regulatory functions and unknown function (Figure
4). Genetic linkage of these genes with the iron uptake
genes argues in favor of a conjunct function and their
identification now opens the door for experimental investigation.
Context-Based Functional Associations Inferences for Iron
Uptake
A comparative genomic analysis of gene clusters containing TonB-dependent Fe(III) transport systems was under-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/203

taken in order to identify additional genes within the
clusters that could potentially be associated with iron
uptake. This analysis suggests novel examples of predicted
co-regulation of iron uptake functions with genes implicated in (i) citrate biosynthesis and (ii) phosphate metabolism.
(i) Citrate biosynthesis
A gene cluster was identified in A. ferrooxidans and A.
thiooxidans that links a classic dicitrate TonB-dependent
Fe(III) uptake system (FecA1) with four genes that we
hypothesize encode a novel citrate synthesis and efflux
system (Figure 5) including: (i) an efflux pump of the
dicarboxylate family that we suggest could serve as a citrate efflux pump – members of this family are known to
export small organic molecules [29], (ii) a malate dehydrogenase (family of NAD-dependent 2-hydroxycarboxylate dehydrogenases) that reversibly converts malate to
oxaloacetate (an intermediate in the biosynthesis of citrate) [30], (iii) a protein of unknown function that exhibits an ACT domain (pfam01842) typically present in
allosteric enzymes with complex regulation involving the
binding of ligands [31] and (iv) a predicted acetyltransferase of the GNAT type superfamily members of which
use acyl-CoAs to acylate their cognate substrates [32]; this
could catalyze the formation of citrate via the acetylation
of oxaloacetate by acetyl coenzyme A (Figure 5). This exact
gene context has not been detected in other organisms
but, in Bordetella mobilis and B. parapertusis, a predicted
dicarboxylate efflux transporter gene is located in a cluster
with the FauA receptor for ferric coprogen and ferric-rhodotorulic acid and the alcaligin siderophore synthase [33]
resembling the predicted gene organization of the
Acidithiobacilli gene cluster.

Four TonB-dependent Fe(III) transport systems in
Acidithiobacilli (FhuE1, FecA3, CirA2 and CirA3) and one
in Leptospirilla (FecA9) are found in clusters associated
with genes predicted to be involved in phosphate metabolism (Figures 3 and 6). These genes include acid and
alkaline phosphatases AcpA and PhoD that hydrolyse

phosphoester bonds, the membrane associated carbonphosphorus lyase complex PhnG-M that participates in
the degradation of phosphonates and a phosphate/phosphonate transporter of the major facilitator superfamily,
the phosphorus regulon regulator PhoB and surface layer
proteins of unknown function. These genes are associated

with others predicted to be involved in iron uptake and to
be regulated by Fur (Figure 3, Additional file 3).
The predicted acid phosphoesterases in the acidophiles
belong to a superfamily of bacterial extracellular enzymes
that includes phospholipases C, acid phosphatases and
alkaline phosphatases of the PhoD family. Alkaline and
acid phosphatases are broad substrate specificity or
polyspecific enzymes that liberate inorganic phosphate
from a range of organic molecules and are well-conserved
members of the Pho regulon found in many bacteria [34].
Most C-type phospholipases are membrane active
enzymes that hydrolyze both phosphatidylcholine and
sphingomyelin and play important roles in disease in a
variety of microbial pathogens (e. g in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [35] and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [36]). Acid
phosphatases affect host signaling pathways by dephosphorylation of host proteins and thus interfere with
phagosome formation [37] and respiratory burst [38]. The
natural substrate(s) of PhoD is still not known [39,40]
and little information is available regarding the role of

these phosphatases in non-pathogenic bacteria. In addition to the roles described above, these enzymes liberate
inorganic phosphate from a range of organic molecules
and might enable bacteria to assimilate phosphate from
organo- and metallo-phosphates in the environment.
Given the gene association profiles detected in the current
work and since phosphate is a well known chelator of iron
species we hypothesize that phosphate produced by the
repertoire of tightly linked phosphatases might function
in these acidophiles as an inorganic ferric iron chelator.
Both phosphate and iron uptake related functions in
Acidithiobacilli and Leptospirilla are located downstream
of OmpR family transcriptional regulators similar to PhoB
(Figure 6). Co-localization of iron uptake functions with
phosphate metabolism genes and the phosphate responsive transcriptional regulator PhoB, suggests the existence
of an iron-phosphate coordinated regulatory control circuit. Coherent regulation of target genes by the iron
responsive transcriptional regulator Fur [41] and the
phosphate dependent transcriptional activator PhoB [34]

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:203

could coordinate environmental and intracellular signals
for homeostatic gene expression of uptake and storage
functions in response to phosphate and/or iron availability. Supporting this argument, one regulator of the PhoB
family has been confirmed experimentally to be under Fur
control in A. ferrooxidans [18]. In addition, transcription
profiling data obtained for a fur knockout strain of the dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis
MR-1, revealed that phoB was repressed in the fur mutant
[42] further extending the connections in this circuit.
Understanding how regulatory factors other than Fur control expression of iron uptake genes is still limited, yet the
picture is growing increasingly complex with the recent
findings of superimposed positive regulation by several
different transcriptional regulators [43]; PhoB could be
added to this list.
Comparative Genomics Based Identification of a Genomic
Island Associated with Iron Metabolism
Taxonomically restricted genes are of special interest
because they are expected to play a role in defining exclusive ecological adaptations to particular niches [44]. We
predict a genomic island containing a gene cluster associated with iron metabolism in A. ferrooxidans that may be
an exclusive system of physiological/ecological significance for the bioleaching consortia. The FepA2-FecA4
TonB-dependent Fe(III) transport system comprises a 13
gene cluster (Figure 7) that resides within a predicted

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/203

genomic island containing 69 genes that is absent from
the genomes of A. thiooxidans and A. caldus. The predicted
protein products encoded by the 13 gene cluster include
two OMRs with different predicted siderophore affinity, a
TonB system and two contiguous partially complete high
affinity metal ABC transporter systems (Figure 7, Additional file 1). These two ABC transporters include three
high affinity periplasmic solute-binding proteins that differ in size, sequence and ligand specificity (Figure 7). Two
of these have predicted affinity for Fe(III) siderophores
and one for molybdate. The most similar orthologs to the
Mo-binding protein of A. ferrooxidans are found in several
nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Interestingly, nitrogen fixation is
performed by an enzymatic complex made up of a Fe/Moprotein (the dinitrogenase) and a Fe-protein (the dinitrogenase reductase) [45]. The association of a gene predicted to encode ModA-like periplasmic binding protein
with affinity for molybdate with genes predicted to be
involved in siderophore uptake suggests that the gene
cluster might be a bifunctional ABC transporter system,
destined to cover the requirements of both Fe and Mo
essential metabolic cofactors.
Adjacent to the proposed 13 gene Fe-Mo transport cluster
is a region of 44 genes predicted to be involved in nitrogen
fixation including the full set of nif genes required for
nitrogenase assembly and maturation [13]. Associated
with the Fe-Mo transport cluster is a predicted fixABCX

gene cluster that, in other nitrogen fixing microorganisms,
has been shown to be required for electron transfer during
nitrogen fixation [46] (Figure 7). These observations suggest that the Fe-Mo transport cluster is the cognate metal
transporter for the Mo-Fe nitrogenase.
A gene (gloA), predicted to encode a truncated globin,
forms part of the 13 gene Fe-Mo transport cluster. Truncated globins have been described in prokaryotes, protozoa, eukaryotic algae and in plants [47]. Their function
remains unclear, although they have been shown in
plants to exhibit low oxygen affinity and, since their
expression is decreased by hypoxia, it has been suggested
that their role is to bind oxygen in conditions of high oxygen availability [47]. We hypothesize that the role of gloA
in A. ferrooxidans is to sense oxygen and regulate the transcription of the Fe-Mo transport operon promoting the
importation of the required metallic cofactors under conditions suitable for nitrogen fixation.
The absence of both the Fe-Mo transporter cluster and the
surrounding nitrogen fixing genes in A. thiooxidans and A.
caldus suggest that this whole region might be a genomic
island acquired by lateral gene transfer, as has been suggested for some iron transporting gene clusters [e.g. [48]]
and other traits influencing survival, fitness and adaptation in bacteria [49]. An analysis of this region using G+C
content analysis, pentanucleotide frequency assessment
and codon usage patterns demonstrate that it conforms to
the average characteristics of the host genome, however
the presence of phage remnants, a site specific tyrosine
recombinase and a Val-tRNA adjacent to the region support the contention that it is a genomic island.
Iron Efflux
Concentration-dependent toxicity of metals that are
essential micronutrients can be ameliorated by balancing
metal influx and efflux through the use of several different
types of efflux pumps (e.g. ATPases, RND, MSF, etc) and
metal responsive regulators [8]. Only proteins of the cation diffusion facilitator family (CDF) have been shown
thus far to remove iron when present in excess. Two proteins FieF and MamB, have been implicated in this role in
E. coli [50] and Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense [51]
respectively. Six different orthologs of FieF and/or MamB
were predicted in the Acidithiobacilli (termed CdfA-C)
and the Leptospirilla (termed CdfD-F) (Additional file 6).
Their role in iron efflux is suggested by the conservation of
functional motifs typical of the FieF protein subfamily
(PRK09509). This hypothesis is strengthened by gene
context analysis in other microorganisms, which reveals
frequent juxtaposition of CDFs with iron related functions, such as: the iron uptake regulator Fur, the iron
detoxification protein Dps, Fe/Pb or Fe/Zn permeases, the
ferri-siderophore receptor FecA, Fe-S cluster assembly pro-

teins and Fe-Mo cofactor proteins. For example, one of the
predicted cation diffusion facilitator family proteins is
encoded within a three gene cluster immediately adjacent
to the Fe-Mo uptake transporter from A. ferrooxidans
described above. This cluster consists of a predicted ABC
solute binding protein, an RND-type outer membrane factor similar to OprD and the cation diffusion facilitator
CdfB. The ABC solute binding protein exhibits 70% similarity to the sulfate/molybdate binding protein ModA
(COG0725) and weak similarity (less than 30%) to the
ABC-type Fe(III) binding protein AfuA (COG1840), while
CdfB carries a C-terminal signature (MTH1175) found in
several uncharacterized proteins belonging to the Fe-Mo
cluster binding proteins. This suggests a role for this gene
cluster in Mo or Fe efflux. Consistent with this hypothesis
is the fact that this cluster is contiguous with a predicted
bifunctional uptake system for these two ions and with
several gene clusters encoding the Fe-Mo nitrogenase.
Iron Storage
Problems associated with toxicity and low availability of
iron can be alleviated in bacteria by the use of iron-storage
proteins such as the heme-containing bacterioferritins
and the heme-free ferritins [52]. In addition, iron detoxification proteins of the Dps protein family are employed
in the protection of DNA from iron-induced free radical
damage [52]. Of these three protein types, bacterioferritins are the most ubiquitous in bacteria and they were
the only class detected in the Acidithiobacilli. Alignment
of their amino acid sequences demonstrates that they are
conserved between A. ferrooxidans, A. thiooxidans and A.
caldus including all residues implicated in the ferroxidase
center (Figure 8). This center endows the protein with the
ferrous-iron-oxidizing activity to store iron in its core [52].

Typically, bacterioferritins contain up to 12 protoporphyrin IX heme groups bound symmetrically at the interface
of two adjacent subunits by the residues Met52 and
Met52' [53]. In all three Acidithiobacilli the equivalent
position is replaced by a leucine residue. Interestingly, E.
coli bacterioferritin mutants modified at Met-52 appear to
be correctly assembled and are still capable of accumulating iron, but lack the heme groups involved in mediating
iron-core reduction and iron release [54]. This conserved
substitution suggests that orthologs of bacterioferritin
present in the Acidithiobacilli could: a) use a residue different from Met52 for the coordination of heme moieties,
or b) lack heme groups and thus also lack from the capacity to reutilize the iron stored inside its cavity or c) utilize
a different mechanism for iron-core reduction and metal
release.
Orthologs of the classical iron storage proteins could not
be detected in the Leptospirilla, raising the question as to
how they store iron or indeed if an iron storage mecha-

nism is required at all, given that they are restricted to living in environments with high soluble iron loads. One
possibility is that they can store iron in intracellular
polyphosphates inclusions as has been suggested for E.
coli [55]. Although there are no reports regarding the
capacity of the Leptospirilla to accumulate polyphosphate
granules, the presence of a predicted polyphosphate
kinase 2 and an exopolyphosphatase known in other
organisms to be involved in polyphosphate biosynthesis
and utilization, suggests that phosphate reserves might
contribute to the storage of divalent cations like iron. In
the case of A. ferrooxidans, it has been shown that the bacterium accumulates substantial numbers of polyphosphate granules (400 nmol of Pi/mg of protein) under Pi
sufficient growth conditions [56] raising the possibility
that these granules might also store iron. This hypothesis
can now be experimentally investigated.
Alternatively, obligatory Fe(II)-oxidizing acidophiles
could bypass the absence of storage proteins by making
use of their inherent capacity to transform the soluble and
life threatening Fe(II) to the less soluble Fe(III). This
transformation could serve as a protection mechanism by
promoting tightly controlled Fe(III) uptake.
Iron responsive regulator profiles
Genomic evidence indicates that the Acidithiobacilli and
Leptospirilla have a diverse set of transcriptional regulators of the Fur family, corresponding to well known regulators involved in the maintenance of divalent cation

homeostasis and the response to several environmental
stresses [57]. Within this set, occurrence and conservation
of the iron responsive Fur regulator points to conserved
regulation mechanisms of the expression of iron related
functions.
Fur from A. ferrooxidans has been demonstrated experimentally to be functional [18,20]. In the Acidithiobacilli
two other members of the Fur family are predicted: a
heme responsive (Irr-type) regulator responsible for the
control of heme biosynthesis in response to iron availability and a peroxide responsive (PerR-type) regulator
responsible for the control of a variety of basic physiological processes in response to peroxide stress (Figure 9A)
[57,58]. Amino acid sequence similarity and gene context
conservation between Fur, PerR and Irr from A. ferrooxidans and the other two Acidithiobacilli suggest similar regulatory roles in the three bacteria (Figure 9A). In A. caldus,
one TonB-dependent ferri-siderophore receptor (CirA5) is
encoded immediately upstream of the proposed Irr-like
Fur family regulator, suggesting a role in iron uptake
beyond that of heme biosynthesis as has been reported for
several α-proteobacteria [59].
The Leptospirilla are also predicted to encode three members of the Fur family (Figure 9B): an iron responsive Furtype regulator, a peroxide sensitive PerR-type regulator
and a zinc responsive Zur-type regulator [60]. Gene context analysis further supports a role for the PerR-like regulator in alkylperoxide stress response in Leptospirillum sp.

group II, where a cytochrome c peroxidase and a peroxiredoxin of the AhpC/Tsa family are divergently transcribed.
Partial conservation of this context occurs in the
Acidithiobacilli, where the gene divergent to PerR is also a
peroxiredoxin of the AhpC/Tsa family. Analysis of the
genetic context of Fur and Zur in Leptospirillum type II provides no additional insights into their functions.

Bioinformatic analysis of predicted Fur binding sites identified thirteen candidate sites in the Acidithiobacilli and
Leptospirilla. Three of the predictions in A. ferrooxidans
correspond to previously documented Fur binding sites.
Novel sites were mapped to their respective genomic contexts (Figure 3) and are presented in Additional file 3. The

strongest predictions with the information theory motif
model occurred in Leptospirilla type II.
Most Fur regulons exhibit overlapping iron uptake functions, and this also seems to be the case in acidophiles.
Many bacterial species have extensive and largely conserved Fur regulons, several of which include: a) the mntH
gene, b) the feoAB, and c) one or several TonB-dependent
outer membrane receptor genes [e.g. [61]]. Presence of Fur
boxes in the promoters of other transcriptional regulators
is also not unprecedented and suggests additional regulation of the linked iron uptake functions by positive regulators coordinated with iron availability.

Discussion
Detailed comparative analysis of the iron management
functions in acidophiles shows that:
• different absolute numbers of iron acquisition systems are
present in the acidophiles. Variations in gene content may
reflect adaptive advantages to their respective ecological
niches.
• absence of sensu stricto Fe(II) transporters and paucity of
Fe(III) transporters in the Leptospirilla. This could represent
a strategy to evade iron stress imposed by readily available
iron at constant low pH.
• significant diversity of iron uptake functions exists in the
Acidithiobacilli. The diversity of outer membrane receptors
exhibited by A. ferrooxidans, A. thiooxidans and A. caldus
might be considered an unexpected feature for extreme
acidophiles, inhabiting conditions typically rich in soluble iron. This diversity might instead reflect the range of
different pH environments (from pH 1 to pH 5) with varying iron bioavailability known to be inhabited by these
bacteria.
• iron functions are predicted to be organized in gene clusters
together with several genes encoding non-iron related functions.
These clusters are predicted to be operons and to function
in the same pathway or functional module. They might
have evolved by stepwise accumulation of coherent functional sub-clusters, for example: a) a citrate biosynthesis
and exportation module and a ferric dicitrate uptake module, b) an iron uptake module and a phosphate/phosphonate uptake module.
• iron storage and iron efflux function are predicted in the
Acidithiobacilli. Presence of a bacterioferritin, polyphosphate accumulation functions and variants of FieF-like
diffusion facilitators indicated that the Acidithiobacilli
may remove or store iron under conditions of variable
availability.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/203

• capacity to oxide iron could itself be a way to evade iron stress.
Fe(II)-oxidizing acidophiles transform the soluble and life
threatening Fe(II) to the less soluble Fe(III). This could
serve as a protection mechanism via the co-precipitation
of Fe(III) with sulfates and phosphates, not only for themselves but also for other microorganisms co-inhabiting
the same ecological niche.
Even when conserved core modules of genes involved in
iron-related functions are strongly predicted, such as the
OMR-TonB system, associated genes vary from bacterium
to bacterium. For example, while both the Leptospirilla
and the Acidithiobacilli share a connection between iron
uptake genes and phosphate metabolism genes, only A.
ferrooxidans and A. thiooxidans have ferric iron uptake systems linked to citrate production and exportation. These
observations highlight the existence of a diversified set of
predicted alternative iron acquisition modules. The evidence presented herein clearly indicates that, in this particular group of acidophiles, several redundant or
alternative iron transporter modules are present (Figure
10). Their identification helps to interpret the physiology/
ecology of these organisms.
The existence of redundant modules is a likely indication
that these acidophiles are versatile in iron acquisitionrelated functions. This versatility could represent an
advantage in changing environmental conditions such as
might be found in naturally acidic conditions and in
industrial copper bioleaching heaps in which differences
in iron availability could arise due to variations in the
environmental pH, directly affecting iron solubility. In
addition, iron biooxidation can at least partially deplete
the environment of soluble ferrous iron by oxidizing it to
the ferric form that can co-precipitate with other components such as phosphate or sulfate to form insoluble complexes (e.g. jarosite). A ready source of this sulfate comes
from associated sulfur oxidizing bacteria. Niche partitions
and ecological successions between iron- and sulfur oxidizing acidophilic microorganisms could be at least partially explained by such changes in iron bioavailability.
As had been observed earlier for A. ferrooxidans [17], the
TonB-dependent outer membrane siderophore receptors
of A. thiooxidans and A. caldus span a wide range of predicted pIs from 5.57 to 9.00 and 6.15 to 8.45, respectively.
This evidence, and the diversity of siderophore specificities predicted for these three microorganisms, suggests
that the OMRs from the Acidithiobacilli represent functional iron uptake genes working at different pHs and/or
taking up different iron (ferri-siderophore) sources at a
given pH. In accordance with this hypothesis, different pH
conditions of growth of A. ferrooxidans in iron (pH 1.6 –
2.0) or sulfur (pH 3.5 – 5.0), which impose different iron
availability restraints, have been demonstrated [17] and a

broad range of growth from pH 1.0 – pH 4.0 in tetrathionate media has been described for A. caldus [62]. At pH values above 2, Fe(III) generated by the biooxidation of
Fe(II) has low solubility and starts to precipitate. Furthermore, sulfate produced during sulfur oxidation strongly
interacts with Fe(III) and forms complex iron oxides precipitates lowering the concentration of soluble iron [63].
As a consequence, when growth occurs at pHs above 2, the
Acidithiobacilli might be compromised by the lack of bioavailable Fe(III) and thereby have a greater need for high
affinity Fe(III) transporters of diverse types. In contrast,
the Leptospirilla grow in a more acidic and restricted pH
range (pH 1 or lower) and do not oxidize sulfur [15].
Thus, their paucity of different outer membrane receptors
with a narrow range of isoelectric points (from 5.10 to
5.73) could result from their uncompromised access to a
constant source of soluble iron.

We speculate that the observed ecophysiology of the
Acidithiobacilli and the Leptospirilla could be partially
explained by these differences in genetic determinants for
iron uptake. For example, in industrial bioleaching heaps
pHs range from 1 to 5 and a significant variation in iron
speciation occurs (personal communication, C. Demergasso) perhaps prompting the need for a diverse range of
siderophores to mediate iron uptake. These siderophores
could be produced by other indigenous microbial species
present and subsequently scavenged by the Acidithiobacilli. On the other hand, the abundant soluble iron
present in very low pH environments, for example in Iron
Mountain [15] or in industrial biooxidation tanks [11],
allows Leptospirilla to survive with few TonB iron uptake
systems and to become the dominant microorganisms. In
addition, in biooxidation tanks there is a build-up of
Fe(III) to very high concentrations over time that could

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:203

also preclude the necessity for multiple TonB uptake systems.
The diversity of OMRs may also have a profound impact
on bacterial survival and genomic stability/plasticity for
other reasons. Outer membrane receptors are multifunctional proteins involved in the uptake of several structurally and functionally unrelated substances and may serve
as receptors for colicins and bacteriophages [64-66]. Sensitivity to these agents may also be TonB dependent [67].
Thus, the gene clusters encoding the Ton system and specific OMRs may deliver phages/colicins into the cell contributing to bacterial survival and competition in the
environment. For example, by competing for the same
receptor protein, the siderophore ferrichrome inhibits
killing of E. coli cells by colicin M [68] and by phage phi
80 [69]. Since infection is dependent on the functional
state of the receptor protein and the latter is dependent on
the energized state of the cell and TonB function, susceptibility to infection differs between actively growing and
partially starved cells [70]. Thus, actively growing cells
that are proficiently taking up iron can be resistant to
phages and colicins delivered by other bacteria, provided
that the cognate siderophores are also secreted by some
member of the consortia.
Mechanisms that help the microorganisms to deal with
changes in iron and siderophores concentrations or phage
titres are thus deemed to be critical for fitness and survival
of bioleaching microbes and their understanding might
contribute to improving the capacity to control the
bioleaching processes.

Conclusion
An analysis of the coding potential, conservation, organization and distribution of iron management functions of
acidophilic bacteria is beginning to identify the molecular
adaptations that underpin their ability to cope with
potentially high concentrations of soluble iron at low pH
and varying concentrations at other pHs. Microorganisms
of the Acidithiobacilli family, that can grow between pH
1–5 using iron or sulfur (A. ferrooxidans) or just sulfur (A.
thiooxidans and A. caldus) as energy sources, exhibit a surprisingly large number of different predicted iron transporters that potentially allow them to grow in conditions
with less abundant iron and to compete for iron with
other microorganisms present in their niche. On the other
hand, the obligatory iron oxidizing Leptospirilla that
thrive only at extremely low pH (pH1) have only a few
predicted iron uptake mechanisms. These differences can
help explain the distribution and activity of these two
groups in naturally acidic environments and in industrial
bioleaching operations. These initial findings lay the
framework for future work aimed at understanding how
iron uptake and homeostasis is regulated in acidophiles,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/203

including how iron-oxidizers discriminate between iron
as a micronutrient and as an energy source. It also suggests
how consortia of microorganisms can operate synergistically or antagonistically to recover minerals during
bioleaching and will pave the way for a better understanding of this important biotechnological process.

Methods
Sequence Data
The complete genome sequence of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 (AF) was obtained from the Institute for Genomic Research database (TIGR) [13,71]. Draft
genome sequences of Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans ATCC
19377 (AT) and Acidithiobacillus caldus ATCC 51756 (AC)
were obtained from the Center for Bioinformatics and
Genome Biology (CBGB) [14]. Draft genome sequences
of Leptospirillum sp. group II UBA (L IIa) and 5 Way GC (L
IIb), and Leptospirillum sp. group III 5 Way GC (L III) were
obtained from the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) [72] and
the Genome database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [73].
ORF Prediction
ORFs likely to encode proteins were predicted by GLIMMER [74]. This program, based on interpolated Markov
models, was trained with ORFs larger than 600 bp from
the proper genes available in GenBank and our private
databases. All predicted proteins larger than 100 amino
acids were searched against a nonredundant protein database as described [75]. Manual curation of the predicted
genes was performed to correct errors in start site prediction and identify missing candidate genes. The 5' and 3'
regions of each ORF were inspected to define initiation
codons using homologies, position of ribosomal binding
sites, and transcriptional terminators.
Gene Identification
The following bioinformatic programs were used to further characterize candidate genes and their predicted protein products: BlastP and PsiBlast [76], the suite of protein
characterization programs available in InterproScan [77],
Blocks [78] and ClustalW [79]. COGs [80] and two sets of
Hidden Markov Models were used to determine ORF
membership in families and superfamilies: PFAM V5.5
[81] and TIGRFAMS 1.0 H [82]. The annotated genomes
were displayed in the interactive format of Artemis [83].
Genes were deposited in GenBank under the accession
and
FJ410133–
numbers:
ACI62867–ACI62983
FJ410136.
Fur box Identification
A set of 66 experimentally confirmed Fur boxes from E.
coli, Salmonella typhimurium, P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was used to generate an alignment matrix and a
weight matrix by the information content method [84].

The weight matrix used to search the all complete and partial genomic sequences included in this study using a 19bp sliding window as described previously [18]. Genes
carrying candidate Fur boxes in their upstream regions
were retained as putative iron related functions directly
targeted by the Fur regulator and further used as search
queries.

Comparative Genomics
A comprehensive search in the NCBI public database was
performed to identify all proteins that are related to iron
homeostasis in bacteria using textmining strategies.
Amino acid sequences for the iron homeostasis related
genes identified were then searched in the genome
sequence of A. ferrooxidans and draft genome sequences of
A. caldus, A. thiooxidans and the Leptospirilla using wuBLAST [85] and candidate genes were then compared
against each other. Orthologous and paralogous families
were derived by performing all-versus-all searches on the
remaining protein sequences by using a modified version
of a previously described method. Pentanucleotide frequency assessment and codon usage patterns were performed following the criteria established by Merkl [86].
