Abstract
Background: Probiotics can alleviate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), possibly by stabilizing the
intestinal microbiota. Our aim was to determine whether IBS-associated bacterial alterations were reduced during
multispecies probiotic intervention consisting of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus Lc705, Propionibacterium
freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS and Bifidobacterium breve Bb99. The intervention has previously been shown to
successfully alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms of IBS.
Methods: The faecal microbiotas of 42 IBS subjects participating in a placebo-controlled double-blind multispecies
probiotic intervention were analysed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Eight bacterial
targets within the gastrointestinal microbiota with a putative IBS association were measured.
Results: A phylotype with 94% similarity to Ruminococcus torques remained abundant in the placebo group, but
was decreased in the probiotic group during the intervention (P = 0.02 at 6 months). In addition, the clostridial
phylotype, Clostridium thermosuccinogenes 85%, was stably elevated during the intervention (P = 0.00 and P = 0.02
at 3 and 6 months, respectively). The bacterial alterations detected were in accordance with previously discovered
alleviation of symptoms.
Conclusions: The probiotic supplement was thus shown to exert specific alterations in the IBS-associated
microbiota towards the bacterial 16S rDNA phylotype quantities described previously for subjects free of IBS. These
changes may have value as non-invasive biomarkers in probiotic intervention studies.

Background
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common functional
gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, is characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort, diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal bloating and flatulence, which are associated with
changes in the frequency and form of stool and may
markedly lower the quality of life [1]. The diagnosis of
IBS is still symptom-based, emphasizing the need for
non-invasive biomarkers in diagnosis and therapeutic
trial follow-up [2]. Multiple features affect IBS aetiology,
including stress, altered GI motility and visceral hypersensitivity [3,4]. In addition, abundant evidence suggests

microbial involvement in IBS. Low-grade mucosal
inflammation has been observed in the GI tract of IBS
patients, whereas onset of GI symptoms after gastroenteritis generates a subset of patients diagnosed with postinfectious IBS [5,6]. Several observations have suggested
the presence of an altered GI microbiota among IBS subjects [7-13] and that probiotics may alleviate IBS symptoms [14,15] with several mechanisms of action [16].
The bacterial species Lactobacillus spp., Veillonella
spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. and the groups Clostridium coccoides and Bifidobacterium catenulatum are
affected in IBS [8]. In addition, alterations in the abundance of several 16S rRNA gene phylotypes have been
observed [9,11]. These include phylotypes from the
families Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Coriobacteriaceae and a novel

Firmicutes phylotype with 85% similarity to Clostridium
thermosuccinogenes. However, in quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses [8,9,11], the
overall microbiota is not covered, as the quantified bacteria are predetermined according to primer sequences.
With a phylogenetic microarray covering over 1000
human faecal phylotypes, the GI microbiota of IBS
patients was shown to diverge from that of healthy controls, with comparably strong variation seen among IBS
patients [13]. Furtherrmore, in a 16S rDNA clone library
sequencing study, the GI microbiota of diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) subjects had relatively high numbers
of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes (especially family Lachnospiracheae) and low numbers of Actinobacteria and
Bacteroidetes [12].
A multispecies probiotic combination (Lactobacillus
rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus Lc705, Propionibacterium
freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS and Bifidobacterium
breve Bb99), which was assessed in this study, was earlier found to significantly alleviate IBS symptoms in a
6-month placebo-controlled intervention [17]. The total
symptom score of IBS patients ingesting the probiotic
combination was significantly lowered due to less borborygmi [17]. Alterations in the GI microbiota were
later monitored by quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction (qPCR) and analysis of short-chain fatty
acid content and bacterial enzyme levels [18], but
microbial factors were concluded not to be responsible
for the observed effect. However, we continued the analyses of the original intervention samples since novel
16S rRNA gene phylotype targeting assays were later
shown to differentiate between IBS patients and healthy
control subjects devoid of GI symptoms [11].
Here, we present the analysis of intervention samples
with eight 16S rRNA phylotype-targeting qPCR assays.
The multispecies probiotic supplement shifts the intestinal microbiota of IBS subjects towards that associated
with healthy control subjects.

Methods
Study design and subjects

The 6-month probiotic intervention study was originally
conducted as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention [17]. IBS patients received daily
either a probiotic capsule (Valio Ltd., Helsinki, Finland)
containing L. rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103, LGG), L.
rhamnosus Lc705 (DSM 7061, Lc705), P. freudenreichii
ssp. shermanii JS (DSM 7067, PJS) and B. breve Bb99
(DSM 13692, Bb99) or a placebo capsule consisting of
microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate and gelatine as an encapsulating material. The total daily
amount of bacteria in the probiotic capsule was 8-9 ×
109 colony forming units, with an equal amount of each
strain. Consumption of other probiotic products was

not allowed during the intervention. All subjects were
advised to follow their usual dietary habits and to not
make any changes to their medication, including
ongoing IBS medication (mainly commercial fibre analogues, laxatives or antidiarrhoeals).
Participants fulfilled the Rome II criteria [19], except
for three subjects who reported slightly less than
12 weeks of abdominal pain during the preceding year.
All patients had undergone a clinical investigation and
endoscopy or barium enema of the GI tract 0-1 year
prior to the study. Exclusion criteria for participation
were pregnancy, lactation, organic intestinal disease,
other severe systematic disease, antimicrobial medication
during the preceding two months, previous major or
complicated abdominal surgery, severe endometriosis
and dementia or otherwise inadequate cooperation capability. Patients with lactose intolerance were allowed to
participate if they reported following a low-lactose or
lactose-free diet. A total of 22 IBS patients receiving a
multispecies probiotic and 20 IBS patients receiving a
placebo capsule were analysed at the time-points of 0,
3 and 6 months (Table 1). The faecal samples of the
placebo group [7-9,11,12,17,20] and of both the placebo
and probiotic groups [18], had been studied previously
with different approaches.
Ethics

All patients gave their written informed consent and
were told that they could withdraw from the study at
any time. The Human Ethics Committee of the Joint
Authority for the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS) approved the study protocol.
Extraction and purification of DNA from faecal samples

Faecal samples were stored anaerobically immediately
after defecation, then mixed and aliquoted and finally
stored at -70°C within 4 h of delivery. Bacterial DNA
was isolated from 1 g of faecal material by removing the
undigested particles from the faecal mass using three
rounds of low-speed centrifugation, collection of bacterial cells with high-speed centrifugation, enzymatic and
mechanical cell lysis and DNA extraction and precipitation [21]. A NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer

(NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) was
used to determine the DNA concentrations.
qPCR assays for quantifying faecal bacterial phylotypes

The qPCR assays targeted intestinal bacterial phylotypes
associated with IBS (Table 2) [9,11]. The iCycler iQ
Real-Time Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA), a component of iCycler Optical System Interface
software (version 2.3; Bio-Rad), was used to analyse the
samples as described previously [9,11]. Standards ranged
from 102 to 107 16S rRNA gene copies per reaction.
Statistical analysis

Undetected abundances in the data were imputed with
mean values obtained from qPCR runs with the same
primer applied to water. If water runs were undetected
for a certain assay, the lowest value of all detected water
runs was used. All statistical analyses were conducted
with log 10 values of the number of 16S rRNA gene
copies detected with the qPCR assay from the 25-ng
sample of faecal DNA.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to get
an overview of the data, and it was computed for the
eight quantified bacterial phylotypes in this study and
the one-week GI symptom scores (abdominal pain, distension, flatulence and borborygmi) collected in parallel
with faecal samples and reported previously by Kajander
et al. [17]. The PCA was performed separately for data
collected at baseline (0 months) and during consumption of the probiotic or placebo capsule (3 and 6 months)
to visualize the similarity structures in the data before
the probiotic intervention and during that.
Assay-specific statistical analyses were also conducted
to compare the probiotic and placebo effects, both for

all IBS symptom subtypes together and for the IBS-D
symptom subtype patients alone. We used standard
mixed-effect linear models, with fixed effects for time
and treatment and their interaction and a random intercept effect for individual (taking into account the
repeated measures from the same subject). The validity
of the model assumptions (homogeneity and normality
of variances) was controlled by studying the residuals
from the fitted models. Additionally, the need for subject-wise baseline correction was checked (no need for
subject-wise baseline correction for this data). Inference
from the estimated models was based on standard Ftests and t-tests. All analyses were performed with the
statistical programming language R 2.6.2 [22] and utilizing the package lme for linear models and contrast for
computing contrasts.
We emphasize here that despite our approach to use
minimal number of tests by testing only those effects
with significant effect on variance as shown by F-tests,
multiple hypothesis tests are conducted and this
increases the possibility that the some of the outcomes
may be due chance. Partially due to this, the constipation-predominant (IBS-C) and mixed symptom subtype
(IBS-M) groups were not analysed separately, because
they additionally had unbalanced and small number of
subjects.

Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum-like, Butyrivibrio
crossotus-like, Cobrobacillus catenaformis 91% and
Slackia faecicanis 91% phylotypes [9,11] were analysed,
but no alterations were detected (data not shown).
Effects of the intervention on selected 16S rRNA
phylotypes

In the visualization of the intervention samples with
PCA, the placebo and probiotic groups appeared to
overlap at the beginning of the study, and no clear
associations were seen based on the measured phylotypes or the GI symptoms (Figure 1a). However, in the
PCA of samples taken during the consumption of the
probiotic combination, the placebo group shifted in
the direction of GI symptoms and the probiotic group
in the opposite direction (see PC1 in Figure 1a and
1b). The placebo group and the R. torques 94%

phylotype and the probiotic group and the C. thermosuccinogenes 85% and R. torques 93% phylotypes
pointed in the same directions (see PC2 in Figure 1b).
A significant decrease in the amount of R. torques 94%
was observed in the probiotic group as a whole (P =
0.02 at time-point 6 months; Table 3 and Figure 2a).
Among IBS-D patients, the R. torques 94% phylotype
was significantly more abundant in the placebo group
than in the probiotic group at the beginning of the
intervention, before consumption of the probiotic supplement (P = 0.04 at 0 month; Table 3). The level
remained similar for the placebo IBS-D subjects, but
decreased among the probiotic-consuming IBS-D subjects, reaching a significant difference relative to the placebo IBS-D patients after 6 months (P = 0.01 at 0
month; Table 3). Within the placebo IBS-D subjects,
none of the time-points differed from each other significantly, whereas the third time-point in the probiotic
group of IBS-D subjects was significantly different from

and 0 months vs. 6 months, respectively).
C. thermosuccinogenes 85% was elevated significantly
in the probiotic group as a whole (P = 0.00 and P =
0.02 at time-points 3 months and 6 months, respectively; Table 3, Figure 2 b) and among IBS-D subjects
(P = 0.01 at 3 months and P = 0.05 at 6 months; Table
3). The effect was stable throughout the intervention
among IBS-D subjects (P = 0.00 and P = 0.04 for comparisons between time-points 0 month vs. 3 months and
0 month vs. 6 months, respectively), and no significant
alterations were detected among the placebo IBS-D
subjects.
The abundance of R. torques 93% was higher in the
probiotic group during consumption of the probiotic
(P = 0.00 and P = 0.00 at time-points 3 months and
6 months, respectively), but among IBS-D patients the
difference disappeared by the end of the study (P = 0.00
at 3 months and P = 0.50 at 6 months; Table 3). For R.
torques 93%, the detected alterations were due to a
decrease in the placebo group.

Discussion
Our study assessed the effect of a multispecies probiotic
supplement on the GI microbiota of IBS patients at a
16S rRNA gene phylotype level in a 6-month placebocontrolled intervention trial [17]. Kajander et al. [17]
have previously documented that the current intervention significantly reduced the total GI symptom score,
mainly due to less borborygmi experienced in the probiotic group. Accordingly, the probiotic group appeared
less strongly associated with the monitored IBS-related
GI symptoms in the multivariate visualization in this
study. The intestinal microbiota during the intervention
has subsequently been investigated by applying qPCR
targeting bacterial groups and species, but although all
supplemented strains were detected, the members of the
intestinal microbiota measured were found to remain

stable during the intervention, with the exception of
Bifidobacterium spp., which decreased significantly in
the probiotic group [18].
In this study, we applied assays targeting Bacteroides
intestinalis-like, Clostridium cocleatum 88%, C. thermosuccinogenes 85%, Collinsella aerofaciens-like, Coprococcus eutactus 97%, R. torques 91%, R. torques 93% and
R. torques 94% phylotypes, which have been shown to
diverge between different IBS symptom subtypes and
healthy control subjects free of GI symptoms [9,11]. The
quantities of these phylotypes together with the IBSrelated symptom score were clearly able to differentiate
the probiotic-consuming subjects from the placebo
group in a PCA of samples taken during consumption
of the probiotic combination. Of the bacterial phylotypes, R. torques 94%, C. thermosuccinogenes 85% and
R. torques 93% were significantly affected during the
intervention.
The C. thermosuccinogenes 85% phylotype was previously found to be more strongly associated with IBSM subjects and healthy controls than with patients suffering from IBS-D [11]. The number of bacteria targeted
with the C. thermosuccinogenes 85% assay is increased
with multispecies probiotic supplementation. In fact, if
per gram of faeces values are calculated, the probiotic
intervention seems to lead to higher quantities of the
C. thermosuccinogenes 85% phylotype than previously
reported for healthy control subjects devoid of GI symptoms [11] (data not shown).
The bacterial species present by assays targeting phylotypes R. torques 91%, 93% and 94% may have different
metabolic and functional roles in the setting studied, as
they were found to behave differently. According to
their 16S rRNA gene sequence, these three ruminococcal phylotypes show less than genus level similarity
among each other and 91%, 93% and 94% similarity to
the species R. torques. Ruminococcus torques is a mucindegrading Clostridium coccoides group firmicute of the
human GI microbiota [23] which has been associated

with Crohn’s disease [24,25]. The phylotype presented
by R. torques 94% and the target sequence (EMBL:
AM275522) of the assay have been associated with
IBS-D [11] and Crohn’s disease [26], respectively. The
closest known bacterial isolate to R. torques 94% is a
fructan-utilizing strain D8 isolated from rat faeces (98%
identity with 16S rDNA sequence AY960564) with lowlevel inulin utilization capability [27]. The phylotype
R. torques 91% has been associated with IBS-D and IBSM [11] and the phylotype R. torques 93% has been associated more strongly with healthy control subjects than
with IBS-M sufferers [11]. The phylotypes R. torques
91% and 93% affiliate to strain SSC/2 16S rDNA
sequence identity 96% and 99% to AY305320, respectively [28]. Strain SSC/2 is potentially beneficial to
health due to its capability to convert lactic acid to
butyric acid [29]. However, the mechanisms that link
R. torques and related phylotypes with an inflamed or
irritated intestine remain unknown.
According to the PCA visualization, the placebo group
samples appeared to be more strongly associated with R.
torques 94% than the probiotic group samples after the
consumption of the probiotic combination had begun.
In the assay-specific analysis, a significant decrease was
detected by the end of the 6-month intervention in the
level of R. torques 94% among the probiotic group and
the IBS-D subjects within the probiotic group. R. torques
91% did not show alterations due to the consumption of
the probiotic supplement, but the abundance of the R.
torques 93% phylotype decreased in the placebo group.
Discrepancies observed between time-points may be
due to the effect of the probiotic being prolonged (no
effect at 3 months, but effect at 6 months) or being
overcome by residents of the GI microbiota (effect at
3 months, but no effect at 6 months). As stress [30] and
diet [31] alter the composition of mammalian GI microbiota, a psychological or habitual response to participating in a probiotic intervention could also be reflected in
the GI microbiota and be overcome with time. The
assay for R. torques 93%, for instance, also quantifies a
lactic acid consuming bacterial strain SSC/2 [29], which
could well react to participants being prohibited of
using any other probiotic products. A similar effect may
apply to R torques 94%, as it is close to an isolate capable of utilising compounds used in prebiotics [32,33],
consumption of which might also alter due to participation in an intervention trial (although prebiotics were
not prohibited). Moreover, the phylotypes quantified
may represent bacteria in the GI tract with abundances
varying over time, especially as IBS patients are known
to have an unstable GI microbiota relative to healthy
control subjects [7]. Defecation frequencies did not,
however, significantly change during the intervention
in any of the IBS symptom subtype groups [17].

Nevertheless, independent sample panels still need to be
investigated to confirm suspected IBS-related alterations
detected in the GI microbiota. Moreover, studies not
restricted to certain bacteria or phylotypes are warranted, as are studies going beyond phylogeny, i.e.
exploring the metabolism of IBS related GI microbiota.
Our findings support those of Kajander and colleagues
[34], who presented a stabilizing effect of multispecies
probiotic supplementation (L. rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus Lc705, P. freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. Bb12) on the overall GI
microbiota of IBS patients during a 5-month intervention. Indeed, the alterations detected here also show a
trend towards the quantities previously detected in nonIBS controls free of GI symptoms [11]. The effects of
probiotic strains or combinations are unique, and not all
probiotic supplementations have favourable clinical
effects on IBS symptoms [16]. Certain probiotic strains
and multispecies supplements may enhance the expression of mucin components and protect the epithelial
layer by adhering to it, thus preventing mucolytic bacteria from digesting the mucus and making the epithelial
barrier more vulnerable [35]. Such probiotic strains
enhance the barrier function and could alter the quantities of mucolytic bacteria. Studies such as this one are
required to improve our knowledge about the mechanisms of actions behind clinically efficient probiotics.
This will help us to target the therapy to those patients
in the heterogeneous group of IBS sufferers, most likely
to respond. Increased knowledge may also provide new
insights into the screening of potentially efficient strains.

Conclusions
Our results indicate that a multispecies probiotic supplement capable of alleviating IBS symptoms affects
IBS-associated faecal bacterial phylotypes. Dysbiosis-like
changes in the overall GI microbiota and even among
specific bacterial phylotypes might have a crucial role in
IBS aetiology and pathology, and one potential mechanism underlying the effectiveness of probiotics in IBS
may be by affecting these microbes. Although the role
of bacteria in IBS aetiology remains uncertain, our
methodological approach of using bacterial phylotypetargeting qPCR assays based on IBS-associated clone
libraries has revealed potential non-invasive biomarkers,
i.e. the C. thermosuccinogenes 85% and R. torques-like
phylotypes, for use in IBS associated studies.
