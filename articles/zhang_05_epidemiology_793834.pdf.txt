Shandong is a relatively developed coastal province in
China with 17 cities, a population of 91.23 million, and
increasing numbers of HIV/AIDS cases. We investigated
the epidemiology of circulating HIV-1 strains from 97
HIV-1 infected cases from 1992 to 2004 in Shandong.
Fragments of HIV-1 env C2-V3, gag P17/P24, 1st exon of
tat and adjacent region were PCR amplified and
sequenced, followed by phylogenetic, homology and
recombination analysis. We found 7 circulating HIV-1
subtypes/CRFs, which are B' (75.3%), CRF01_AE
(10.3%), CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC (i.e. B'/C, 4.1% respectively), B, C and CRF02_AG (2.1% respectively). Subtype
B' was found mostly in paid blood donors, while B'/C
recombinants were primarily in injecting drug users. The
remaining subtypes distributed mainly in sexually transmitted subjects. Genetic divergence and amino acid
sequence analysis showed that B' strains are closely related
to B.CN.RL42; B'/C strains to 97CN54A and 97CNGX6F;
CRF01_AE strains to 01_ae.th.90.cm2; CRF02_AG, C and
B strains were related to standard strains from Cameroon,
Ethiopia and America, respectively. Genetic divergence of
env of B' strain showed that it started circulating in Shandong 7–10 years ago. The large strain variation and occurrence of CRFs signify the rapidly increasing HIV-1
epidemic in Shandong, and have implications for vaccine
design.
