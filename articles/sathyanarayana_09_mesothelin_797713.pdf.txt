Abstract
Background: Mesothelin is a 40 kDa protein present on the surface of normal mesothelial cells
and overexpressed in many human tumours, including mesothelioma and ovarian and pancreatic
adenocarcinoma. It forms a strong and specific complex with MUC16, which is also highly
expressed on the surface of mesothelioma and ovarian cancer cells. This binding has been suggested
to be the basis of ovarian cancer metastasis. Knowledge of the structure of this protein will be
useful, for example, in building a structural model of the MUC16-mesothelin complex. Mesothelin
is produced as a precursor, which is cleaved by furin to produce the N-terminal half, which is called
the megakaryocyte potentiating factor (MPF), and the C-terminal half, which is mesothelin. Little is
known about the function of mesothelin and there is no information on its possible threedimensional structure. Mesothelin has been reported to be homologous to the deafness-related
inner ear proteins otoancorin and stereocilin, for neither of which the three-dimensional structure
is known.
Results: The BLAST and PSI-BLAST searches confirmed that mesothelin and mesothelin precursor
proteins are remotely homologous to stereocilin and otoancorin and more closely homologous to
the hypothetical protein MPFL (MPF-like). Secondary structure prediction servers predicted a
predominantly helical structure for both mesothelin and mesothelin precursor proteins and also
for stereocilin and otoancorin. Three-dimensional structure prediction servers INHUB and ITASSER produced structural models for mesothelin, which consisted of superhelical structures
with ARM-type repeats in conformity with the secondary structure predictions. Similar ARM-type
superhelical repeat structures were predicted by 3D-PSSM server for mesothelin precursor and
for stereocilin and otoancorin proteins.
Conclusion: The mesothelin superfamily of proteins, which includes mesothelin, mesothelin
precursor, megakaryocyte potentiating factor, MPFL, stereocilin and otoancorin, are predicted to
have superhelical structures with ARM-type repeats. We suggest that all of these function as
superhelical lectins to bind the carbohydrate moieties of extracellular glycoproteins.

Background
Mesothelin is a cell surface protein that is found in normal
mesothelium and highly expressed in several cancers
including mesotheliomas and ovarian and pancreatic cancers[1,2]. It is produced as a part of the 69 kDa precursor
protein[1,3-5]. The furin cleavage of the precursor protein
yields two proteins, the N-terminal megakaryocyte potentiating factor (MPF), which is a soluble extra-cellular protein, and the C-terminal 327-residue mesothelin, which is
membrane-bound by means of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor at the C-terminus of the protein [6].
The sequence of the human mesothelin (from NCBI
accession number: NP_005814) is given in Figure 1,
which also shows the furin cleavage site and the predicted
GPI anchor site. Mesothelin and MPF are useful tumor
markers [7,8]. Mesothelin is the target protein of an
immunotoxin-based therapy of mesotheliomas and ovarian and pancreatic cancers, of which the phase I clinical
trial has been completed [9].
Little is known about the function of mesothelin. It was
suggested early on [1] that mesothelin might be involved
in adhesion and particularly in adhesion and spread of
ovarian cancer cells throughout the mesothelial lining of
the peritoneal cavity. However, no phenotype could be
detected from mesothelin gene knockout mice [10]. It was
found later that mesothelin interacted strongly and specifically with the large glycoprotein MUC16, which is highly
expressed in ovarian cancer cells [11,12], and that this
interaction was mediated by the N-linked oligosaccharides of MUC16[11]. This interaction presumably plays a
major role in the metastasis of ovarian tumors within the
peritoneum [11,12]. It was reported recently [13] that
mesothelin promoted pancreatic cancer cell proliferation
and migration and pancreatic cancer progression, but no
molecular mechanism was proposed for these effects.
Mesothelin shares homology with the hypothetical protein MPFL (MPF-like) and with the inner ear proteins
otoancorin and stereocilin [14]. These latter two proteins
are also GPI-anchored to the membrane of the inner ear
sensory and non-sensory epithelial cells and are associated with deafness in people [15,16]. It has been suggested that these proteins interact with the acellular gel
that overlies the inner ear epithelium, enabling the inner
ear hair cells to detect vibrations in the acellular gel [1416]. The acellular gel is rich in glycoproteins [17].
We report here a possible three-dimensional (3D) structure of mesothelin based on the results from secondary
and tertiary structure prediction programs. We predict that
mesothelin has a superhelical structure made of ARM-type
helical repeats. Although our main interest is the structure
of mesothelin, we performed similar calculations and
reached similar conclusions for the structure of the full-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/1

length mesothelin precursor protein, as well as for otoancorin and stereocilin. We suggest that all three proteins –
mesothelin, otoancorin and stereocilin – function as
superhelical lectins that bind the extracellular glycoprotein matrix to the surface of the cell to which they are
anchored.

Results
Homology search and secondary structure prediction
A BLAST [18] search of non-redundant protein database
using human mesothelin precursor protein sequence
yielded the hypothetical protein MPFL. A PSI-BLAST [19]
run of the same sequence against the Swissprot database
converged after three cycles to produce four non-mesothelin hits, which were otoancorins and stereocilins from
human and mouse, as expected from a previous report
[14]. Three other hits were for mesothelin precursors from
mouse, human (a splice variant) and rat. There were no
hits from BLAST or PSI-BLAST against Protein Data Bank
(PDB) [20] for any of the three proteins mesothelin, stereocilin or otoancorin. A search in Pfam database [21] for
mesothelin hits the mesothelin family. No structural
information is posted on Pfam for any member of this
family.

Results of the secondary structure prediction for human
mesothelin sequence from nine different programs [2226] are shown in Figure 1. They consistently predict a predominantly helical structure, made of small helical segments separated by short non-helical regions. Similar
results were obtained for mesothelin precursor, stereocilin, and otoancorin (data not shown). There is one region,
residue numbers 291 to 295, which is predicted to be beta
strand by all the prediction servers, but this region is presumably either cut away when the protein is modified by
the addition of the GPI anchor (see the legend to Figure 1
and the Discussion section) or close to the membrane surface when the protein is anchored to the membrane
through the GPI moiety. There are other pockets of beta
strand predictions by some, but not by all, prediction servers. Probability scores as calculated by the sam-t02-stride
server are high (>0.5) for all the blue colored helical
regions in figure 1 and for a couple of beta-patches (the
residues 290–295 and 197–201), but those for other beta
predictions were all less than 0.5, with average probability
of 0.3.
3D Structure prediction
Mesothelin and mesothelin precursor sequences were
submitted to various 3D structure prediction servers. For
the mesothelin precursor, 3D-Jury metaserver [23] produced three hits with Jscore > 50 from three different programs namely INHUB [22], BasD [27] and 3D-PSSM [28].
The hits were 1BK5A, 1WA5B and 1IALA, respectively,
which are all superhelical structures with ARM repeats in

the 'Armadillo' family in the SCOP protein structure classification database [29]. The predicted region spans the
entire length of the precursor (622 amino acids), which
includes both MPF and mesothelin. However, the same
3D-Jury metaserver did not produce any hits when only
the mesothelin sequence was given. The mesothelin
sequence was then submitted directly to the INHUB and
3D-PSSM servers. The highest scoring eight structures
from INHUB server were all ARM repeat proteins, 1BK5A
being one of them, whereas 3D-PSSM server did not yield
any hits with E < 1.0.(The mesothelin sequence that was
actually used for all calculations reported here inadvertently carried two extra residues, ARG-ARG, at the N-terminus of the sequence. We believe that the presence of these
two residues would not significantly affect any of the
results reported here, especially in view of the fact that the
whole mesothelin precursor is expected to have a nonglobular, repetitive structure).
I-TASSER [30] server produced 5 different models for each
sequence submitted. All 10 models (5 for mesothelin precursor and 5 for mesothelin) were found to have superhelical structures with ARM-type repeats.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/1

The secondary structures predicted by INHUB server for
the INHUB model based on 1BK5A template and those
calculated using DSSP [31] software for the first model
from I-TASSER server are included in Figure 1. It shows
that the secondary structures in these two models largely
agree with those predicted by the secondary structure prediction servers. Figure 2 gives multiple structure-based
sequence alignments of the 10 ARM repeats of 1BK5A
structure [32] and the 8 repeats of mesothelin model#1
from I-TASSER server. (See Methods for the procedure
used to make this Figure). The atomic coordinates of
model #1 from I-TASSER server for mesothelin can be
obtained from the authors. A 3D structural representation
of this model is shown in Figure 3.
Other structure prediction servers gave more varied
results. Robetta server [24] predicted mesothelin precursor to be made of 4 domains and mesothelin of 2
domains. The program generated 10 models for each of
the domains, which were used to build another set of 10
for each of the full chains. All models were made of helices separated by small turns but their overall structures
were all different. Most were globular, but a few had the

regions of the 7th repeat of 1BK5A. The first two form the outer helices and the third the inner helix. The helix boundaries of
other repeats do not always agree with those of the 1BK5A 7th repeat. The residues in the 7th repeat of 1BK5A are shown in
the next line in uppercase letters. The residues in all other repeats that follow are in upper or lower case letters depending on
whether they align with residues of the 7th repeat of 1BK5A or not, respectively. The columns labelled 10, 13, 16 and 17 at the
bottom are the key positions in the outer helix that are hydrophobic in many ARM/HEAT repeats [40]. Similarly LxxxAxxxL at
the bottom indicates the conserved LEU and ALA positions in the inner helix, x being any residue. The hydrophobic residues
(A, V, I, L, M, F, Y, W) in these 7 columns are highlighted.

superhelical structure with the ARM/HEAT-type repeats,
including one model each for the first 3 domains of mesothelin precursor and another one for the first domain of
mesothelin. GenTHREADER [33] server produced no hits
for either mesothelin precursor or mesothelin sequence.
FFAS [34] predicted (score < -9.5) Leucine-Rich Repeat
(LRR) domain structures for mesothelin sequence, which
are made mainly of beta strands, turns and coils. These are
unlikely to be correct since they are not consistent with
the secondary structure prediction results.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/1

Coiled coil is another possible structural type for a predominantly helical protein. In order to see if mesothelin
might have a coiled coil structure, we ran two coiled coil
detection servers. The COILS server([35] predicted coiled
coil fold for mesothelin sequence at three regions, each
consisting of only 10–12 residues, one with 0.8 probability and the other two at 0.1 and 0.2 probabilities.
Paircoil2 server[36] did not predict any coiled coil fold.

[53].

Since the most likely predicted structure is the ARM-repeat
type structure, we also ran two servers that detect proteins
with repeating motifs in their sequence. The REP
server[37] did not identify any repeats for mesothelin. The
HHrep server[38] had five hits of potential repeat regions
with the highest score 26.7 and with E-values higher than
10-5. These are insignificant hits when compared with
those for the 1BK5A sequence, in which case one gets hits
with scores from 96 to 248 with E-values less than 10-13.
Therefore, the repeats in mosothelin structure are undetectable using sequence alone and using these tools.
Mesothelin and mesothelin precursor sequences contain
regions that are predicted to have disordered structures.
The PrDOS server[39] identifies three such regions in the
mesothelin precursor: 12 residues at the N-terminus, 3
residues at the C-terminus and an 11-residue segment,
REVEKTACPSG, at the furin-cleavage region, which is at
the very N-terminal end of the mesothelin sequence (Figure 1). In order to see if the presence of this last potentially
disordered region influenced the structure prediction for
the mesothelin precursor, both mesothelin and mesothelin precursor sequences were submitted to the 3D-PSSM
and INHUB servers with or without the first repeat
sequence, msln-1, shown in Figure 2, which includes the
REVEKTACPSG sequence. 3D-PSSM gave hits for the mesothelin precursor, which were the ARM-repeat type structures, either with or without the msln-1 sequence. It did
not yield any hits for mesothelin with or without the
msln-1 sequence. The top 5 hits obtained from the
INHUB server, for both mesothelin and mesothelin precursor, were all ARM-repeat proteins, either with or without the msln-1 sequence. Thus, the presence of the middle
disordered region apparently did not influence the structure prediction of either protein.
Stereocilin (NCBI accession number: NP_714544.1) with
1775 amino acid residues and otoancorin (DAA00022)
with 1153 amino acid residues are about 3 and 2 times the
size, respectively, of mesothelin precursor, which has 622
amino acid residues. Both sequences were submitted to
the 3D-PSSM server. Since the server can only accept less
than 800 residues, stereocilin sequence was submitted in
3 approximately equal parts. Of the total 18 hits (E < 1.0)
generated for the three parts, 15 were ARM repeat superhelical structures according to SCOP. The otoancorin was
submitted in two equal parts and generated 10 hits (E <
1.0), of which 8 were ARM repeat superhelical proteins.

Discussion
The mesothelin precursor is most likely to have the superhelical structure with the ARM-type repeats since four different structure prediction programs (INHUB, 3D-PSSM,
BasD, and I-TASSER), which employ widely different
algorithms, all predict the same type of structure for this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/1

protein. This structure is also consistent with the predicted
secondary structure. Although other structure prediction
programs produced different models, they seem less reliable because the server generated many different structures
(Robetta) or the model was inconsistent with the predicted secondary structure (FFAS). Since mesothelin is a
part of the mesothelin precursor, mesothelin is also likely
to have the same type of structure. Although furin cleavage
in general could change the structure of the protein, this
seems unlikely for a non-globular, superhelical repeat
structure. The secondary structure prediction (Figure 1),
the INHUB and I-TASSER server results with the mesothelin sequence alone, and the alignment of the hydrophobic
residues among the repeats within the mesothelin part
(Figure 2) all support this conclusion.
ARM/HEAT-type superhelical structures are made of tandem repeats of about 50 residue-long helix-turn-helix
motifs, of which one helix forms the inner (concave side)
and the other the outer (the convex side) helices of the
superhelical structure [40]. In the ARM-type repeats, the
outer helix is broken into two smaller helices, with a bend
in the middle. Typical HEAT-type structures will have ARG
and ASP residues interacting between the repeats [40,41].
The ARM repeat proteins lack this ARG and ASP interaction but will often have a GLY and/or PRO residue at or
near the bend between the two outer helices. However,
there are many ARM/HEAT repeats that do not have either
of these features, as can be seen from the aligned
sequences in the Pfam family of ARM and HEAT repeats.
For example, the recently reported crystal structure of
FANCE protein [42] has an ARM/HEAT repeat superhelical structure but without these canonical features. Only
the hydrophobic residues are conserved between the
repeats in FANCE.
Model#1 for mesothelin from I-TASSER server has a rootmean-square-deviation of 1.9 Å compared to 1BK5A
structure as calculated by SHEBA [43] using only the Cα
atoms. 1BK5A is an ARM repeat protein with PRO residues in the outer helices. However, neither the I-TASSER
models nor the INHUB model of mesothelin built based
on 1BK5A structure as template has the regular ARG and
ASP interaction between the repeats, nor the GLY or PRO
residue between the two outer helices except in one or two
repeat (Figure 2). On the other hand, many positions in
both the inner and outer helices that are occupied by the
hydrophobic residues (residues highlighted in green in
Figure 2) in 1BK5A structure are also occupied by similarly hydrophobic residues in the repeats of mesothelin
model#1 of I-TASSER server (Figure 2).
The model we present here (Figure 3) is meant to suggest
only the type of structure that mesothelin is likely to
assume. Although we believe that this is the best structural

BMC Structural Biology 2009, 9:1

model for mesothelin at present, the real structure of mesothelin will inevitably be different from that of the model
presented. In particular, some or all of the residues of
repeat #8 are presumably missing after GPI modification
(see below) and it is possible that the remaining residues
of the repeats #7 and #8 do not have the typical helixturn-helix structure of the ARM/HEAT repeats because of
their proximity to the cell membrane. This may explain
some of the unusual features of repeat #7 of the model
structure, which includes a long gap and lacks some conserved hydrophobic residues when compared to the structure of 1BK5A (Figure 2). The very N-terminal region of
the mesothelin sequence proper may also have a structure
that deviates from the ARM-type repeat since it includes a
region predicted to be disordered. Nevertheless, the
model was used to suggest a few exposed residues in the
N-terminal region of the protein, which might participate
in the MUC16 binding. Later experiments showed that the
MUC16 binding was indeed significantly affected upon
mutation of some of these residues. (Ho et al., accepted
for publication in the Journal of Biological Chemistry).
Mesothelin is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)anchored cell-surface protein. The GPI attachment process
involves removing all but one residue of the C-terminal
signalling sequence and replacing them with the GPI moiety [44]. The exact C-terminal sequence of the GPI modified mesothelin has never been reported, but the region
shown in low case italics in Figure 1 has been suggested to
be the signalling sequence [1]. We more recently ran a GPI
prediction program [45] on the mesothelin precursor
sequence. It predicted a smaller region, which is shown in
different font color in Figure 1. It turns out that the last
repeat (repeat #8) of the model structure is made entirely
of the signalling sequence suggested earlier. Therefore, it is
probable that GPI-modified mesothelin lacks all or at
least a large part of the residues of repeat #8 and that the
residues of repeat #7 are close to, and possibly interact
with, the GPI anchor and the cell membrane.
The four other models of I-TASSER server are also basically superhelical structures, each one made of eight
repeats, each repeat consisting of helices separated by
turns. The main differences among them are in the overall
twist of the superhelix and in the exact placement of the
repeat and helical boundaries, which affect the distribution of hydrophobic and charged residues in the structure.
All models lack the ARG-ASP salt bridges between the
repeats and the PRO residue in the middle of the two
outer helices. We judged that model #1, being most similar to a real superhelical structure, 1BK5, had the most natural superhelical twist of the five models.
This superhelical structure makes it unlikely that mesothelin is an enzyme; well-known superhelical structures of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/1

this type function to bind other proteins[37]. We have
reported that mesothelin interacts strongly and specifically with the glycoprotein MUC16 and that this interaction appears to be through the carbohydrate moiety of
MUC16 [11]. Since mesothelin is not an immunoglobulin and the predicted structure makes it unlikely to be an
enzyme, it probably functions as a lectin [46,47].
Although the structure of the carbohydrate-recognition
domain (CRD) of lectins is diverse, all CRDs we know are
predominantly beta-structures or cysteine-rich domains
with little regular structure [48]. Thus, mesothelin appears
to be the first example of a lectin made almost entirely of
alpha-helices. Another notable feature is that mesothelin
and MPF appear to be the first examples of extra-cellular
ARM-type repeat proteins. We identified 108 proteins in
PDB that have the ARM-type repeats, all of which are
intra-cellular.
Using BLAST, PSI-BLAST, and the University of California,
Santa Cruz Genome Browser database http://
genome.ucsc.edu, we could collect a number of sequences
that are homologous to mesothelin. Multiple alignment
of these sequences using the program MUSCLE [49] and
visualized by using the ClustalX program [50] is given as
Additional file 1. A phylogenetic tree constructed using
this alignment is shown in Figure 4. The MPFLs are relatively close homologues of mesothelin. Stereocilins and
otoancorins are more remote homologues, but probably
also have the HEAT/ARM type superhelical structures, as
predicted by 3D-PSSM. These latter proteins are found
attached to the surface of sensory and non-sensory inner
ear cells and their defects are associated with deafness
[15,16]. They have both been suggested to mediate the
attachment of the epithelial and sensory hair cells to the
tectorial membrane [14,16], which is the acellular gel that
lies over these cells. We suggest that these proteins also
function as superhelical lectins, which bind to the
polysaccharides of the glycoproteins known to be present
in the tectorial membrane [17,51].

Conclusion
On the basis of the secondary structure prediction from 8
different servers and tertiary structure prediction from 4
different servers, we suggest that mesothelin superfamily
of proteins, which includes mesothelin, megakaryocyte
potentiating factor, mesothelin precursor, MPFL, stereocilin, and otoancorin, have a superhelical structure made of
the ARM/HEAT-like repeats. Partly based on the predicted
structure, we propose that all these proteins function as
lectins to bind the carbohydrate moiety of glycoproteins.

> 50 was considered as a hit. For the 3D-PSSM results, we
considered all hits with E< 1.0, since E-values below 0.05
were suggested to be highly confident and E-values up to
1.0 as worthy of attention. According to the instructions
for FFAS, predictions with scores lower than -9.5 contain
<3% of false positives and we chose this as the cutoff
value. INHUB and I-TASSER did not have suggested
threshold values for their results.

Submission of stereocilin and otoancorin to 3D-PSSM
server
Stereocilin and otoancorin sequences were submitted to
the 3D-PSSM server in pieces because there is a limit of
600 residues that one can submit to the 3D-PSSM server.
The stereocilin sequence was broken into 3: the N-terminal part (residues 1–593), the middle part (594–1191)
and the C-terminal part (1192–1775); the otoancorin
sequence was broken into 2: the N-terminal part (1–560)
and the C-terminal part (561–1137).

List of abbreviations
CRD: carbohydrate-recognition domain; GPI: glycosylphosphatidylinositol; ALA: alanine; ARG: arginine; ASP:
aspartate; GLY: glycine; LEU: leucine; PRO: proline

Submitting mesothelin precursor sequence to servers that
predict disordered regions and coiled coil motifs and
internal repeats
Sequence of mesothelin precursor was submitted to
PrDOS server http://prdos.hgc.jp that predicts the disordered regions of a protein from its amino acid sequence
and
also
to
two
servers,
Paircoil2
http://
groups.csail.mit.edu/cb/paircoil2/ and COILS http://
www.isrec.isb-sib.ch/software/COILS_form.html both of
which predict coiled coil fold from sequence. Sequence of
mesothelin precursor was also submitted to REP server
http://www.embl-heidelberg.de/~andrade/papers/rep/
search.html, which searches for repeats similar to those in
its database containing ARM, HEAT, ANKYRIN and other
protein repeats. Similarly, sequence of the mesothelin precursor was submitted to HHrep server http://toolkit.tue
bingen.mpg.de/HHrep which identifies internal repeats
within a given protein sequence.
Multiple alignment of the repeats of mesothelin
The multiple alignments shown in Figure 2 include the 8
repeats of mesothelin of I-TASSER model#1, along with
the 10 ARM repeats of 1BK5A. The 10 structural repeats of
1BK5A were derived using the repeat boundaries reported
by the authors [32]. Similar repeats for mesothelin were
derived for the I-TASSER model#1 after this model was
structurally superposed to 1BK5A. Each of the 9 repeats of
1BK5A and 8 repeats of mesothelin were then aligned
pairwise to the 7th repeat of 1BK5A using SHEBA. The
sequence alignments from these pairwise structural alignments were read out using the program SE[52] and collected together in a consistent manner using the 7th repeat
of 1BK5A as the anchor sequence.

Authors' contributions
BKS ran most of the programs, YH found the homologs of
mesothelin and made multiple alignments of them and
the phylogenetic tree, MP, IP and BL generated the idea of
this research and contributed through editing the manuscript and taking part in the discussions, BL directed the
research, and BKS and BL were primarily responsible for
writing the manuscript. All authors read and approved the
manuscript.

Supplemental figure 1, Multiple alignments of the conserved regions
of the 19 homologues of mesothelin precursor using MUSCLE. These
alignments were used to construct the phylogenetic tree in Figure 4. The
protein sequences include human, mouse and rat mesothelin precursors
(accession numbers NP_005814, NP_061345, and NP_113846, respectively); mouse MPFL (MPF-like, also known as BC052484, accession
number NP_808490); human, mouse, dog, and cow stereocilins (accession numbers NP_714544, NP_536707, XP_535452, and XP_606859,
respectively); human, mouse, and Xenopus otoancorins (accession numbers NP_653273, NP_647471, and AAH79797, respectively); and predicted sequences of mesothelin precursor from rhesus macaque; MPFL
from human; stereocilin from rhesus macaque, rat, and opossum; and
otoancorin from rhesus macaque, dog, and chicken. The aligned regions
of the representative proteins are: human mesothelin precursor, 68–502;
mouse MPFL, 63–510; human stereocilin, 1194–1666; and human
otoancorin, 570–1020. Coloring and the quality curve are as described at
http://bips.u-strasbg.fr/fr/Documentation/ClustalX/. '*' indicates fully
conserved column, ':' strongly conserved and '.' weakly conserved. Human
mesothelin sequence starts at position 273. The histogram below the alignment is the alignment quality curve.
