Abstract
Background: The WD motif (also known as the Trp-Asp or WD40 motif) is found in a multitude
of eukaryotic proteins involved in a variety of cellular processes. Where studied, repeated WD
motifs act as a site for protein-protein interaction, and proteins containing WD repeats (WDRs)
are known to serve as platforms for the assembly of protein complexes or mediators of transient
interplay among other proteins. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, members of this superfamily
are increasingly being recognized as key regulators of plant-specific developmental events.
Results: We analyzed the predicted complement of WDR proteins from Arabidopsis, and
compared this to those from budding yeast, fruit fly and human to illustrate both conservation and
divergence in structure and function. This analysis identified 237 potential Arabidopsis proteins
containing four or more recognizable copies of the motif. These were classified into 143 distinct
families, 49 of which contained more than one Arabidopsis member. Approximately 113 of these
families or individual proteins showed clear homology with WDR proteins from the other
eukaryotes analyzed. Where conservation was found, it often extended across all of these
organisms, suggesting that many of these proteins are linked to basic cellular mechanisms. The
functional characterization of conserved WDR proteins in Arabidopsis reveals that these proteins
help adapt basic mechanisms for plant-specific processes.
Conclusions: Our results show that most Arabidopsis WDR proteins are strongly conserved
across eukaryotes, including those that have been found to play key roles in plant-specific
processes, with diversity in function conferred at least in part by divergence in upstream signaling
pathways, downstream regulatory targets and /or structure outside of the WDR regions.

Background
The so-called WD-repeat (WDR) proteins comprise an
astonishingly diverse superfamily of regulatory proteins,
representing the breadth of biochemical mechanisms and
cellular processes. These proteins have been found to play
key roles in such disparate mechanisms as signal transduction, cytoskeletal dynamics, protein trafficking, nuclear

export, and RNA processing, and are especially prevalent
in chromatin modification and transcriptional mechanisms. WDR proteins are intimately involved in a variety
of cellular and organismal processes, including cell division and cytokinesis, apoptosis, light signaling and vision,
cell motility, flowering, floral development, and meristem
organization, to name a few. Within the cell, WDR

proteins have been found to be components of the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm, linked to the cytoskeleton, or associated with membranes through binding to membrane
proteins or through membrane-interacting, ancillary
domains. Known WDR proteins range in size from small
proteins such as the pleiotropic plant developmental regulator VIP3, to massive (>400-kDa) proteins such as the
mammalian protein trafficking factor Lyst.
The common and defining feature of these proteins is the
WD (also called Trp-Asp or WD-40) motif, a ~40-amino
acid stretch typically ending in Trp-Asp, but exhibiting
only limited amino acid sequence conservation [1]. When
present in a protein, the WD motif is typically found as
several (4–10) tandemly repeated units. In the WDR proteins for which structure has been determined, including
a mammalian Gβ subunit of heterotrimeric GTPases,
repeated WD units form a series of four-stranded, antiparallel beta sheets [[2]; D.K. Wilson, pers. commun.], which
fold into a higher-order structure termed a β-propeller.
This structure can be visualized as a short, open cylinder
where the strands form the walls [2]. At least four repeats
are believed to be required to form a β-propeller [3]. In
Gβ, which contains seven WDRs, the first and last (i.e.,
amino- and carboxyl-terminal) WDRs participate in the
same propeller blade, potentially reinforcing the structure
(for an extensive discussion of WD motifs and WDR structure, the reader is referred to Smith et al., 1999 [2]).
It is now accepted that WDR domains within proteins act
as sites for interaction with other proteins. This characteristic of WDRs allows for three general functional roles.
First, WDRs within one protein can provide binding sites
for two or more other proteins and foster transient interactions among these other proteins. This type of role is
best illustrated by Gβ, which has been the most extensively studied of the WDR proteins. The heterotrimeric
GTPases in which Gβ s participate functionally associate
with a variety of heptahelical membrane receptors (G protein-coupled receptors or GPCRs) to propagate cellular
response to a multitude of extracellular signals. Upon
receptor activation by an extracellular ligand, Gβ, along
with the tightly bound Gγ peptide, dissociates from the
Gα subunit, and both Gβγ and Gα then can interact with
a variety of effectors. Gβ associates reversibly with at least
14 other proteins, including phospholipases, adenylate
cyclases, and ion channels [4]. Another example of this
type of role is the yeast histone acetylase subunit Hat2,
which is required for efficient interaction of the catalytic
subunit Hat1 with the target histone [5]. In both Gβ and
Hat2 (and in many other WDR proteins) nearly all of the
protein is composed of WDRs.
A second potential role of WDR proteins is as an integral
component of protein complexes. This functional mode is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/50

probably best illustrated by the snoRNP U3 particle,
involved in splicing of the small subunit ribosomal RNAs.
Of the 28 characterized subunits of U3, no less than 7 are
WDR proteins [6]. Another example is yeast Pfs2, a protein that is found associated with the poly(A) polymerase
Pap1 and several multisubunit factors in a large protein
complex required for pre-mRNA 3'-end processing and
polyadenylation [7]. Within this large complex, Pfs2 interacts directly with specific subunits of two of the processing
factors, suggesting that Pfs2 is important for integrity of
the larger complex [8]. Many other WDR proteins have
been found in relatively stable complexes, including the
nuclear pore complex [9], the general transcription factor
TFIID [10,11], and the yeast SET1 histone methyltransferase complex [12].
A third recognized role of the WDR is to act as a modular
interaction domain of larger proteins. The presumed role
of the WDR in these cases is to bring the protein and associated ancillary domain(s) into proximity of its target(s).
Two examples in plants are the light signaling proteins
COP1 and SPA1, which juxtapose carboxyl-terminal
WDRs with an amino-terminal ring-finger or kinase-like
domain, respectively (below). Other common examples
of ancillary domains seen in WDR proteins from yeast,
animals or plants include the F-box, SET domain, and bromodomain (not shown).
Many WDR-containing proteins of unknown function
have been designated as 'Gβ-like', even in the absence of
any sequence-based or functional relationship with Gβ.
These misleading annotations suggest that a phylogenetic
analysis of this superfamily is needed. Here, we evaluated
the extent of the predicted WDR protein superfamily in
Arabidopsis, and the sequence-based and functional relationships between these proteins and known or hypothetical proteins from budding yeast (Saccharomyces
cerevisiae), fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and humans
(Homo sapiens). Our results suggest that most Arabidopsis
WDR proteins are strongly conserved across eukaryotes,
including those that have been found to play key roles in
plant-specific processes.

Results and Discussion
The Arabidopsis WDR protein family
This analysis identified 269 Arabidopsis proteins containing at least one copy of the WD motif. The vast majority
of these (237) contained four or more recognizable copies
of the motif. We classified these 237 proteins into 143 distinct families, 49 of which contained more than one Arabidopsis member. Approximately 113 of these families or
individual proteins showed clear homology with WDR
proteins from yeast, fly, and/or human (Table 1 [see Additional file 1]). Where conservation was found, it often
extended across all of these organisms, suggesting that

many of these proteins are components of basic cellular
mechanisms.
The Arabidopsis proteome is apparently lacking counterparts of several WDR proteins that have been extensively
studied in other eukaryotes and might have been expected
to be conserved. For example, we found no protein related
to the cell death initiator Dark (fly)/Apaf-1 (human). This
protein is the central scaffolding of the apoptosome, a
protein complex that activates specific cellular proteases
in response to death signals [13]. Many parallels exist
between animal and plant apoptotic pathways, and many
other components of the animal pathways have been
strongly conserved in plants [14]. Arabidopsis also
appears to lack a protein closely related to the intermediate chain of the microtubule motor protein dynein,
involved in transporting cellular cargo along microtubules. In mammalian cytoplasmic dynein, the intermediate chain plays a crucial scaffolding role, mediating
interactions among the heavy chain and other dynein subunits [15]. Arabidopsis was previously hypothesized to
lack the dynein heavy chain, based on nearly-completed
genomic sequence [16]. It was suggested that if Arabidopsis did lack functional dynein, this could be compensated
for by the relative variety of carboxyl-terminal motor
domain kinesins in this species [17].
In contrast to these apparently lacking proteins, we found
several proteins that were not expected. One example is a
protein very closely related to Notchless (Nle), a fly protein that binds to the intracellular domain of the developmental signal receptor Notch and modulates its activity
[18] (Fig. 1). Arabidopsis lacks a recognizable Notch, and
other components of the associated signaling pathways
appear to be absent [19]. In addition, we found two proteins strongly related to the transcription-coupled, DNArepair (TCR) proteins Rad28 (yeast) and Csa (human),
even though plants are not known to undergo TCR (Fig.
1).
Also notable were several cases where Arabidopsis apparently did not participate in the expansion of gene families
seen in the other eukaryotes. One example is a conserved
component of the transcription factor TFIID, represented
by the human TAFII-100 protein. This protein interacts
directly with at least three other components of TFIID,
and thus probably serves as a scaffolding for construction
of the complex [10,11]. Multiple paralogs of this protein
exist in fly, worm, and human (Table 1 [see Additional file
1] and not shown); in flies a form designated Cannonball
(Can) appears to operate outside of basal transcription as
a key regulator of spermatogenesis [20]. One possibility is
that the paralogs within each species act as a interchangeable components of the general transcription machinery
to mediate expression of developmentally regulated target

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/50

genes [21]. The presence of only a single form of this protein in the Arabidopsis proteome suggests that this potential means of expanding the transcriptional repertoire has
not evolved in plants. Another example of an evolutionarily stagnant family is Gβ, which exists as only a single
form in Arabidopsis (Table 1 [see Additional file 1];
below). In mammals, each of the heterotrimeric G protein
subunits, as well as the GPCRs, are encoded by multigene
families, and combinatorial interaction among the proteins are believed to modulate much of the diversity of
response to extracellular signals. The restriction of this
gene family in Arabidopsis would suggest that, if a 'typical'
heterotrimeric G protein does exist, it would likely lack
the functional complexity seen in mammals. This scenario
would be similar to that in yeast, where only a single heterotrimeric G protein, incorporating the Gβ protein Ste4,
has a specialized role in transducing mating type signals
from heptahelical mating-factor receptors [22].
In contrast, some other Arabidopsis WDR proteins show
relatively expanded gene families compared with the
other eukaryotes studied. One of the largest Arabidopsis
WDR families, consisting of nine members, is orthologous to the conserved Cdc20/Fizzy class of cell cycle regulators including yeast Cdc20 and Cdh1 (Table 1 [see
Additional file 1]). These proteins activate the anaphase
promoting complex (APC) ubiquitin ligase, which targets
downstream cell cycle regulators for proteolysis [23],
potentially by mediating interaction of the APC complex
with target proteins. Mutation in Cdc20 or Cdh1 affect
distinct aspects of the cell cycle, and Cdc20 and Cdh1
coimmunoprecipitate with distinct APC target proteins
[24,25], indicating that these proteins have non-overlapping functions. One explanation for the expansion of this
family in Arabidopsis is that the several distinct proteins
each specify distinct targets for the APC. Another example
of an expanded gene family is the MSI1/RbAp48 group of
chromatin-related proteins, which includes five members
in Arabidopsis (below), but is represented by only a single
form in flies (Table 1 [see Additional file 1]).
Several examples were seen where Arabidopsis WDR proteins have used elements from the inceptive 'molecular
toolbox' in original ways. One example is the pleiotropic
developmental regulator LEUNIG (LUG) [26]. LUG contains seven, carboxyl-terminal WD motif repeats, internal
polyglutamine tracts, and an extended motif termed the
single-stranded DNA-binding-protein (SSDP) motif
([27], Fig. 1 and not shown). The SSDP motif was defined
in a small family of animal proteins including chicken
SSDP, which binds to a single-stranded, polypyrimidine
region of the α2(I) collagen promoter [28]. SSDP-like proteins function in transcriptional complexes with LIM
homeodomain proteins and LIM-domain-binding proteins (Ldbs) to regulate specific embryonic developmental

processes [29]. The arrangement of the SSDP motif with
carboxyl-terminal WD repeats appears to be unique to
LUG and its orthologs from other plants (not shown).
However, the juxtapositioning of polyglutamine tracts
with carboxyl-terminal WD repeats, while diverging from
the domain structure seen in the SSDPs, resembles that
seen in the yeast transcriptional corepressor Tup1 and a
related corepressor from fly, Groucho [27]. This, in conjunction with the observation that loss of LUG activity
leads to ectopic expression of a floral regulatory gene [30]
has led to the speculation that LUG acts as a Tup1/Groucho-like transcriptional corepressor [27]. Intriguingly, it
was recently shown that LUG functions in floral development together with SEUSS (SEU), a protein related to the
mammalian LIM-domain-binding protein, Ldb1 [26],
suggesting the existence of a LUG-SEU transcriptional
complex analogous to that involving LIM proteins. Collectively, this information suggests that LUG participates
in an evolutionarily distinct mechanism of gene regulation incorporating elements of both Tup1/Groucho and
Ldbs.
Linking conserved mechanisms with plant-specific
processes: Functional specificity through divergence in
regulatory targets
With the exception of LUG, the Arabidopsis WDR proteins that have been functionally characterized are
strongly conserved within the WDR regions among yeast,
fly and/or human (Table 1 [see Additional file 1]). Most
of these proteins have been identified as components of
basic cellular machinery in these other eukaryotes, yet
have been found to regulate plant-specific processes
(Table 1). An interesting question for further consideration is how these proteins have become adapted to their
plant roles.

In several cases, the homologous WDR proteins are highly
conserved throughout the length of the proteins, and

appear to operate in highly analogous mechanisms, with
specificity in function conferred by changes in upstream
signaling pathways and/or downstream effectors. One
case is AGB1, the only clear Arabidopsis ortholog of Gβ
[31] (Fig. 1). Loss of AGB1 function leads to developmental pleiotropy including shortened fruits [32] and changes
in patterns of cell division in the hypocotyl and root [33].
These phenotypes are associated with the derepression of
genes that are normally turned on by auxin, suggesting a
role for AGB1 as a negative regulator of auxin signaling
[33]. There appears to be one Gα-like protein (GPA1) and
two Gγ-like proteins (AGG1 and AGG2) in the Arabidopsis proteome [31], and molecular modeling and yeast
two-hybrid studies of potential interactions among AGB1,
GPA1 and AGG1 are not inconsistent with the possibility
that these could form a heterotrimeric protein [33,34]. In
addition, both AGG1 and AGG2 contain domains
expected to recruit AGB1 to membranes [34], and GPA1
has been demonstrated to bind GTP(γ)S [35]. These findings lead to the prediction that AGB1 participates in a prototypical heterotrimeric G protein. However, the
Arabidopsis proteome does not contain obvious heptahelical receptors with which a heterotrimeric G protein
might interact [31]. One possibility is that the AGB1-containing G protein might be unlinked from a receptor. In
animals, several receptor-independent activators of heterotrimeric G proteins are known, including the Ras-related
protein Ags1 [36], and AGB1 might function in concert
with any of the many Ras-related proteins in Arabidopsis.
Alternatively, the Arabidopsis G protein may have evolved
an interaction with a distinct type of receptor. Intriguingly, genetic experiments suggested that AGB1 may act in
a common mechanism of fruit development with
ERECTA (ER), a leucine-rich receptor kinase-like (LRRRLK) protein, and based on this it was suggested that the
two proteins could be functionally associated [32].
Another link between a potential plant heterotrimeric G
protein and LRR-RLKs was demonstrated by the observaPage 5 of 11

BMC Genomics 2003, 4

tion that gpa1 mutants share the same level of insensitivity
to GAs during seed germination as mutants for the LRRRLK protein BRI1 [33].
An example of downstream functional divergence is
shown by CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1
(COP1). In dark-grown plants, this WDR protein acts as a
key repressor of photomorphogenesis; in light, COP1
becomes inactivated, at least partly through gradual
nuclear exclusion [37]. The COP1 protein contains a carboxyl-terminal WDR domain, a RING Zn-finger domain
near the amino terminus, and a predicted coiled-coil
domain (Fig. 1). The WD domains mediate its interaction
with, and negative regulation of, HY5 and HYH, closely
related bZIP transcription factors [38,39]. This negative
regulation potentially results from the ability of COP1 to
target these proteins for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis,
because COP1 has been shown to function in this manner
to downregulate a distinct regulatory protein in vivo [40].
Humans and mice have a recognizable COP1 homolog,
although yeast or flies do not ([41]; Table 1 [see Additional file 1], Fig. 1). Similar to the relationship between
Arabidopsis COP1 and HY5 or HYH, human Cop1 binds
to and negatively regulates Jun (and other related bZIP
transcription factors) [42]. The mammalian proteins conserve the important structural features of Arabidopsis
COP1, including the RING finger, coiled-coil domain,
and WDRs. When expressed in plant cells, mammalian
Cop1 displays the light-specific nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning characteristic of Arabidopsis COP1, but fails to
rescue the cop1 mutant phenotype [41]. Thus it appears
that certain 'upstream' mechanisms regulating COP1
activity are conserved, but that downstream effectors of
COP1 are not. This is consistent with the observation that
components of the COP9 signalosome, which is required
for COP1 localization, are conserved in mammals [43].
FASCIATA2 (FAS2) and the Arabidopsis family of Msi1related proteins provide more examples of highly conserved WDR proteins involved in plant-specific processes
through specificity in downstream targets. The FAS2 protein is the single Arabidopsis homolog of one of the three
subunits (Cac1, Cac2 and another WDR protein, Msi1) of
chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) [44], which participates in chromatin assembly following DNA replication
or repair [45]. FAS2 physically interacts with the only Arabidopsis ortholog of Cac1 and with AtMSI1, one of five
paralogous Msi1-like proteins, and several lines of evidence suggest that Arabidopsis FAS1, FAS2, and at least
AtMSI1 comprise a plant CAF-1 [46]. Mutations in FAS2
lead to meristem disorganization at the shoot and root
apex, associated with the aberrant expression of two previously identified genes that organize the meristem,
WUSCHEL in the shoot and SCARECROW in the root
[44].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/50

The conserved WDR protein subfamily represented by
Msi1 and its Arabidopsis orthologs also includes human
RbAp48 and fly p55 (Table 1 [see Additional file 1], Fig.
1). These latter proteins are CAF-1 subunits [47], but may
serve supplemental functions. For example, both RbAp48
and p55 are found in several chromatin-remodeling complexes [48], and RbAp48 has been found tightly bound to
the catalytic core subunit of the human histone deacetylase HDAC1 [49]. One possibility is that these Msi1-like
proteins link chromatin assembly with the maintenance
of gene silencing by recruiting activities that instigate the
formation of localized heterochromatin [46]. It is not
unlikely that this is the case in Arabidopsis as well. Loss of
AtMSI1 function leads to various developmental defects,
at least some of these associated with the ectopic expression of the floral homeotic genes AGAMOUS and
APETALA2 [50]. Loss of the paralogous AtMSI4 (also
called FVE) leads to late flowering, associated with loss of
transcriptional repression of the MADS-box flowering
inhibitor gene FLC ([51]; J. Martinez-Zapater, pers.
comm.). The observation that loss of AtMSI1 or AtMSI4
confer phenotypes that are distinct from those seen in fas2
mutants suggests that these proteins also probably have
functions that are not limited to a role in CAF-1. Thus it
seems likely that the FAS2 and Msi1 families of proteins
are involved in equivalent regulatory mechanisms, with
diversity in function due to the identity of the regulated
gene(s).
A similar example is FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT
ENDOSPERM (FIE). FIE is required for repression of
endosperm development in the absence of fertilization
and is also essential for proper endosperm and embryo
development when fertilization occurs [52]. The FIE protein has strong similarity to fly Esc and mammalian Eed,
identified originally as polycomb-group repressors of
homeotic gene expression [53] (Table 1 [see Additional
file 1], Fig. 1). Esc and Eed interact directly with homologous SET-domain E(z) proteins in heterogeneous protein
complexes also including the zinc-finger protein Su(z)12
or the histone deacetylase Rpd3 [54,55]. Esc-E(z) polycomb complexes have been shown to repress gene activity, in part through their histone methyltransferase and
histone deacetylase activities [56,57]. In a highly analogous manner, FIE binds directly to the SET-domain protein MEA, and genetic experiments suggest that a FIE-MEA
pair interacts strongly with the Su(z)12-like protein FIS2
[58,59].
Mutations in FIE also cause misexpression of floral induction genes in the embryo and seedling, and consequent
ectopic production of flower-like structures [60], suggesting that FIE has an additional and unrelated role in repression of the flowering program during the vegetative stage.
Interestingly, this embryonic flowering resembles the phe-

notype of a mutant for a Su(z)12-like protein designated
EMF2 [61], and potentially FIE and EMF2 are components
of a distinct Esc-E(z)-like complex. Although FIE has no
apparent paralogs within the Arabidopsis proteome, there
are multiple Su(z)12-related and E(z)-related proteins
(not shown). Thus there is the potential for FIE to be
involved in numerous aspects of growth and development
through combinatorial interactions with several distinct
complexes. Similarly, Eed, which also appears to be
encoded by a single gene, interacts with multiple E(z)-like
proteins [62].
Recently it was shown that FIE is required for transcriptional repression of PHERES1, a member the homeoticfunction MADS-box gene class [63]. It is notable that FIE
and its homologs participate in an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to repress homeotic genes, even as the
structure of homeotic genes have greatly diverged between
plants (i.e., MADS-box) and animals (i.e., homeobox).
Functional specificity through structural divergence
outside of the WDR region
In almost all cases, proteins that we classified as homologous between species showed the highest degree of
sequence similarity within the WDR regions, in several
instances exhibiting little or no related sequence outside
of the WDR region. In at least some of these cases, function of the homologous proteins may nevertheless be conserved. For example, the transcriptional corepressor Tup1
is highly variant outside of the WDRs among different
strains of yeast, but is functionally interchangeable among
them [64]. In other cases, sequences outside of the WDR
may confer a new functional specificity to the protein
even as conserved protein interactions are maintained
through the WDRs, potentially adapting basic cellular
mechanisms to organism-specific processes. One potential example in Arabidopsis is PRL1, a nuclear protein
implicated in the response to several stimuli including
glucose, sucrose, cold, and multiple phytohormones [65].
PRL1 interacts through its non-conserved amino-terminal
domain with yeast Snf1, a conserved protein kinase that
plays an important transcriptional role in sugar sensing
and response, and with Arabidopsis Snf1-related protein
kinases (SnRKs) [66]. The carboxyl-terminal WDR
domains of PRL1 exhibit very strong conservation with
proteins from yeast (Prp46), fly, and human (Plrg1)
(Table 1 [see Additional file 1], Fig. 1 and not shown).
These non-plant proteins have not been related to Snf1associated gene regulation, possibly as a result of divergence with PRL1 in the amino-terminal regions of the proteins. Instead, the yeast and human PRL1 homologs were
identified as non-snRNP components of the spliceosome
[67,68], a large pre-mRNA splicing assembly consisting of
RNAs, small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and
numerous other proteins. The WDR region of Prp46 and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/50

Plrg1 mediate interaction with other spliceosomal subunits that are structurally and functionally conserved in
Arabidopsis ([68] and not shown), and therefore it would
not be surprising if PRL1 is also found to be associated
with the spliceosome. A growing body of evidence points
to the physical coordination of transcriptional regulation
and downstream events including pre-mRNA processing
[69], and thus PRL1 could link conserved spliceosomal
components with plant-specific transcriptional regulators.
The flowering regulator FY provides another potential
example of this type of recruitment of basic cellular processes for plant-specific functions by WDR proteins. In a
developmental role closely related to that of AtMSI1/FVE
(above), FY promotes flowering by repressing the flowering inhibitor FLC. FY physically interacts with the plantspecific, RNA-binding-motif protein FCA; this interaction
is required for a negative autoregulatory mechanism controlling FCA protein accumulation, where full-length FCA
protein promotes premature cleavage and polyadenylation of its own transcript [70]. This autoregulation is evidently disrupted in the shoot apex of plants undergoing
the transition to flowering, leading to increased accumulation of active FCA [71]. In accordance with a role in RNA
processing, the WDR region of FY exhibits strong homology with that of the aforementioned yeast RNA splicing
factor Pfs2 and homologs from higher eukaryotes (Table
1 [see Additional file 1]; Fig. 1). Outside of the WDR
region, these proteins diverge, with FY containing an
extensive, proline-rich carboxyl-terminal region through
which its interaction with FCA is mediated [71]. It was
suggested that this non-conserved portion of Pfs2/FY proteins in other eukaryotes might similarly link core RNAprocessing machinery with regulatory proteins [71].
In our classification of Arabidopsis WDRs into gene families, we also noted several instances where proteins designated as paralogs diverged significantly outside of the
WDR region. These proteins could link a common cellular
mechanism with alternative or additional upstream regulators or downstream effectors, potentially in a temporal
or spatially restricted manner. One notable case is SPA1, a
nuclear-localized, light-dependent repressor of photomorphogenesis proposed to link the phytochrome A-specific branch of light signaling to a COP1-associated
mechanism (Hoecker and Quail, 2001). Within its WDR
domain, SPA1 is very closely related to COP1, but outside
of this region SPA1 substitutes a SER/THR/TYR-proteinkinase-like domain for the RING-finger domain of COP1.
SPA1 and COP1 physically interact through coiled-coil
regions of both proteins [72]. How the functional relationship between SPA1 and COP1 is related to this molecular linkage is not known, but genetic and biochemical
studies suggest that SPA1 may somehow stimulate the

Conclusions
To date, the function of only about 10 members of the
Arabidopsis WDR protein superfamily have been
described, in spite of the fact that many of these proteins
are expected to participate in key cellular and organismal
processes. This study provides a useful framework for a
functional analysis of unknown Arabidopsis WDR proteins. Because they have the potential to interact with several proteins simultaneously, WDR proteins are attractive
subjects for analysis through protein linkage mapping as
these techniques become developed for use in plants. This
same feature allows WDR proteins to integrate molecular
mechanisms and pathways, and so reversed-genetic analyses targeting these proteins should also be highly informative. Studies of these plant proteins may also provide
unique insights into the mechanism of pathogenicity of
human diseases. Studies in plants have obvious advantages over mammalian disease models, foremost among
them being much more powerful and tractable
approaches for genetic analyses. To date, six human diseases have been linked to defects in WDR genes, and five
of the respective proteins are strongly conserved in Arabidopsis (Table 2). The only of these to be studied to date,
the peroxisomal import receptor-associated protein PEX7,
appears to be very closely related in function to its yeast
and human counterpart [73] (Fig. 1), and this is a preliminary indication that such plants studies will be highly
relevant.

Methods
Predicted Arabidopsis proteins containing at least one
WD motif were identified using motif-search software
maintained by The Arabidopsis Information Resource
[74] and current InterPro signatures (Prosite PS50294,
PS00678, or PS50082; Pfam PF00400, PRINTS PR00320,
or SMART SM0320 [75]). The database used for this analysis, ATH1. pep, was provided by The Institute for
Genomic Research (TIGR) and was released Apr 17, 2003.
Proteins containing at least four WD motifs were assigned

At5g67320 (1E-104)
At1g27840 (6E-55) At1g19750 (2E-33)
At3g56900 (1E-29)
PEX7/At1g29260 (2E-74) Peroxisomal receptor for
type-2 peroxisomal targeting signals [73]

into families using Blastclust (unpublished, available
from the National Center for Biotechnology Information
[76]), a single linkage clustering tool that uses the BLAST
algorithm to determine distance. Blastclust uses these
default values for the BLAST: matrix BLOSUM62, gap
opening cost 11, gap extension cost 1, no low-complexity
filtering, and an Expectation (E)-value cutoff of 1E-6. It is
configurable, and accepts several different parameters
which can be set to alter the distance calculations and the
clustering threshold. Because there was no a priori evidence as to which parameters would yield biologically relevant clusters, we ran the Blastclust software over several
iterations, varying two parameters. The L parameter
(range: 0.3–0.8) represents the amount of overlap coverage between query and subject, expressed as a ratio. The S
parameter (range: 0.7–1.5) is a measure of the information content density of the alignment. As L and S increase,
so does the stringency of the match. The analysis presented here used L = 0.3 and S = 0.7. Other protein motifs
in WDR-containing proteins were identified using the
InterProScan. pl program (Release 3.1) [77] and the Interpro 5.3 database as maintained by the European Bioinformatics Institute, in combination with Pfam Release 7.8
[78] and the PRODOM database (2002.1).
To identify WD motif-containing proteins in S. cerevisiae,
D. melanogaster, and H. sapiens, we analyzed previously
compiled proteome datasets available from the Saccharomyces Genome Database [79], FlyBase [80], and Ensembl
(v. 13.31.1, released Mar 31, 2003)[81] as described
above. The sequences utilized can be obtained through
HTML links in Table 1 (see Additional file 1]. These
sequences were used to query the ATH1. pep dataset using
Washington University BLAST (WUBLAST) version 2.0 as
maintained by TAIR. An Arabidopsis protein or paralogous group was designated as orthologous if it met the following three criteria: 1) it was the most closely related
protein(s) 2) The E value for the match was less than 10E11, and 3) the protein or all members of the paralogous
group were more closely related than the next most significant match by a factor equal to or greater than 10E15.
