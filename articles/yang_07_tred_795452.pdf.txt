Abstract
Background: Trichophyton rubrum is the most common dermatophyte species and the most
frequent cause of fungal skin infections in humans worldwide. It's a major concern because feet and
nail infections caused by this organism is extremely difficult to cure. A large set of expression data
including expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and transcriptional profiles of this important fungal
pathogen are now available. Careful analysis of these data can give valuable information about
potential virulence factors, antigens and novel metabolic pathways. We intend to create an
integrated database TrED to facilitate the study of dermatophytes, and enhance the development
of effective diagnostic and treatment strategies.
Description: All publicly available ESTs and expression profiles of T. rubrum during conidial
germination in time-course experiments and challenged with antifungal agents are deposited in the
database. In addition, comparative genomics hybridization results of 22 dermatophytic fungi strains
from three genera, Trichophyton, Microsporum and Epidermophyton, are also included. ESTs are
clustered and assembled to elongate the sequence length and abate redundancy. TrED provides
functional analysis based on GenBank, Pfam, and KOG databases, along with KEGG pathway and
GO vocabulary. It is integrated with a suite of custom web-based tools that facilitate querying and
retrieving various EST properties, visualization and comparison of transcriptional profiles, and
sequence-similarity searching by BLAST.
Conclusion: TrED is built upon a relational database, with a web interface offering analytic
functions, to provide integrated access to various expression data of T. rubrum and comparative
results of dermatophytes. It is devoted to be a comprehensive resource and platform to assist
functional genomic studies in dermatophytes. TrED is available from URL: http://www.mgc.ac.cn/
TrED/.

Background
Dermatophytes are fungi that can cause superficial infections of the skin, hair, and nails. They are the most com-

mon agents of fungal infections worldwide and impact
millions of individuals annually [1,2]. Because of the
severity and longevity of the disease and its refractivity to

therapy, dermatophyte infections cause tremendous pain
and account for significant costs to society. The dermatophytic fungi include numerous species of fungi which
belong to the following three genera; Epidermophyton,
Microsporum and Trichophyton. T. rubrum is the most commonly observed dermatophyte worldwide and especially
dominant in onychomycosis with a prevalence of approximately 80% [3].
However, very few biochemical identification procedures
are available for dermatophytes; thus, diagnosis of dermatophyte infections is based on the gross and microscopic morphology of the colony. Fungal culture, which
can be useful to confirm the diagnosis and treatment,
would take two to four weeks and pleomorphic growth
can lead to misidentification. Molecular epidemiology of
an outbreak of fungal infections is also not possible due
to the lack of molecular methods [4]. Though a number of
pathogenic fugal genomes were determined within the
last decade, to date, however, no dermatophyte genome is
publicly available yet. Moreover, dermatophytic
sequences are surprisingly poor-represented in public
databases; besides the recently released ESTs by our group
and others (see below) only 524 nucleotide sequences
(including a majority of ribosomal RNA sequences for
phylogenetic studies) were found in GenBank for all three
genera of dermatophytes by April 2007. Therefore the
dearth of publicly available genomic data is a major barrier to the current biomedical research of dermatophytes.
Fortunately, a set of five dermatophytes including T.
rubrum were recently proposed for genome sequencing by
the National Human Genome Research Institute [5]. It
would provide key insights into the pathogenic life style
of dermatophytes and boost the development of new
diagnostics, therapies, and vaccines. However, in the
absence of complete genomic sequences, single pass, partial sequencing of either 3' or 5' ends of complementary
DNA (cDNA) clones to generate a set of expressed
sequence tags (ESTs), offers a highly cost-effective strategy
of accessing and identifying gene inventories. The availability of EST datasets is also important to future genome
annotation and gene expression analysis.
Recently, our group reported a sequencing program of
over thirty thousands ESTs derived from ten different
stages of T. rubrum life cycle, which represented a first significant step towards the comprehensive description of
cellular functions involved in T. rubrum biology [6]. Since
microarrays are widely recognized as a significant technological advance providing transcriptome expression patterns, we further constructed T. rubrum cDNA microarrays
from the EST clones and applied them in the following
studies. One is tracing changes of genes expression during
T. rubrum conidial germination in time-course experi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/250

ments to reveal molecular mechanisms in developmental
stage at the cell level [7]. The other is transcriptional profiles studies of T. rubrum response to several antifungal
agents to make clear the mechanism of drug actions in this
pathogenic fungus [8,9]. And the third one is a comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis to assess gene
variation among different dermatophytes, which may
yield some insights into the host-specificity and pathogenesis in dermatophytic fungi (our unpublished data).
The enormous information from T. rubrum needs to be
well organized and presented for researchers focusing on
dermatophytes. TrED is therefore developed to the accurate interpretation and incisive exploitation of massive
datasets. The database integrates of genetic, transcriptomic and metabolomic data of T. rubrum as well as comparative genomics results of dermatophytes. As a result,
TrED provides a wealth of invaluable information about
the evolution, life cycles, cell biology, and virulence of
dermatophytes.

Construction and content
Data sources
TrED currently collects the following three types of data:
(i) EST sequences of T. rubrum, (ii) transcriptional profiles
of T. rubrum and (iii) CGH results of 22 dermatophytes.

The raw EST data in TrED include all publicly available T.
rubrum EST sequences as well as a set of our newly determined ESTs derived from T. rubrum mycelia grown under
conditions mimicking virulence. To suppress the potential sequencing errors that inherent in single-pass reads,
all ESTs sequenced by our group were reevaluated from
the original chromatograms by setting the Phred quality
score cutoff to 20, which means less than one expected
error per 100 base pairs (bp). Public data deposited by
other contributors were directly retrieved from dbEST
[10]. Redundant and obsolete records were removed.
Transcriptional profiles of T. rubrum response to different
antifungal agents and its expression data during conidial
germination reported previously were available from
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [11]. Data from a
newly performed CGH study of 22 dermatophyte strains
were also integrated into TrED.
Analytical methods
All ESTs were screened to remove contaminating
sequences, including restriction site, adaptor, cloning vector, poly(A/T) tail and bacterial sequences by the trimming script SeqClean [12] with NCBI's UniVec as filtering
database. ESTs with remain length <50 bp were excluded
from further analysis.

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:250

Since ESTs are typically partial, redundant and errorprone, the TGICL software [13] was used to form clusters
of similar ESTs with the following criteria: ≥95% identity
of overlaps with ≥40 bp in length and mismatched overhangs <20 bp. The ESTs comprising each cluster were
assembled using CAP3 [14] to produce longer and more
reliable consensus sequences (i.e. contigs). ESTs that can't
be clustered or assembled with others were kept as singletons. Only contigs or singletons with valid length ≥100 bp
were deposited into the database. There are 10,224 different assembled T. rubrum sequences (unisequences) composed of 4,566 contigs and 5,658 singletons in the current
release of TrED.
ESTScan2 was used to detect possible coding regions in all
unisequences [15]. Since available Trichophyton coding
sequences (CDS) were limited from public domains as
mentioned above, we used a combination of CDSs from
genomes of two relatives, Coccidioides immitis and Aspergillus fumigatus, as the training dataset for building hidden
Markov models. The 944 ESTs without a detectable coding
region are largely (81.4%) singletons and short in size,
which are probably mostly made of untranslated region.
The predicted peptides were then used for conserved protein families search in Pfam database [16] by HMMER
software [17], and sequence-similarity search by BLASTP
in databases of Gene Ontology (GO) [18], eukaryotic
orthologous groups (KOG) [19] and KEGG [20], respectively. The nucleotide sequences were also sent to similarity search by BLASTX against the non-redundant protein
database of GenBank (NR). All high-throughput analytic
approaches mentioned above were facilitated by using
local version of databases and programs.
The nomenclature from MEROPS database was adopted
for the classification of putative proteases found in T.
rubrum [21]. Possible transmembrane domains were identified by TMHMM2.0 [22].
Database implementation
TrED is built on a RedHat Linux 9.0 operation system and
the data are stored as a MySQL relational database that is
accessible directly through an Apache web server. The Perl
programming language and some common modules,
such as DBI, GD and CGI, are used to generate interactive
web pages for the query interfaces. A revision of the KEGG
pathway map-viewer [23] is employed for graphic representations of metabolic pathways based on user-defined
similarity settings (see below). A local WWW-BLAST program is integrated into TrED to allow users performing
sequence-similarity search against all currently available
sequences of dermatophytes (nucleic acid or amino acid)
using the BLAST algorithm.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/250

The weekly update of datasets for dermatophyte BLAST is
accomplished through automated downloading new data
from GenBank by BioPerl scripts. A bimonthly execution
of BLASTX comparison between all unisequences in TrED
and the current NR database is scheduled on a background Linux-cluster, and the results will be transferred
and imported into the database in a semi-automated fashion by a series of Perl scripts.

Utility and discussion
Database overview
The TrED database supports the following basic tasks: (i)
browsing by listing of cDNA libraries, assembled unisequences or related metabolic pathways, (ii) querying
based on accession numbers, clone names, functional
classifications or protein properties as well as sequencesimilarity searching by BLAST, (iii) visualizing and comparing transcription profiles and CGH data and (iv)
downloading the raw data and analysis results.

TrED integrated several different types of expression data
for T. rubrum including EST sequences and transcriptional
profiles. Though most of them are also available from
other public databases, such as dbEST and GEO, they keep
only the raw data with virtually no biological content.
However, researchers who interested in further data mining prefer resources with comprehensive biological information rather than raw data depositories. TrED described
here are essential for this goal. It provides additional
information for individual ESTs including assembly structure, predicted peptide, Gene Ontology associations, and
multiple sources of comparison to infer functional annotation. Moreover, different types of data are interconnected within the database, which is very convenient for
further interpretations.
T. rubrum is a model organism for dermatophytes research
and most data in TrED were directly derived from this
organism. But the CGH results of 22 dermatophyte strains
by the T. rubrum cDNA microarrays were also integrated
into the database. It actually extends the contents of TrED
to make it a valuable resource not only for T. rubrum study
but also for studies of other dermatophytes. We further
constructed a dermatophyte BLAST tool to facilitate the
future researches in pathogenic superficial fungi (see
below for details).
Comprehensive and configurable user interface
In the TrED database, individual EST sequences are clustered and assembled to produce a set of more complete
and reliable consensus sequences (i.e. unisequences) representative of putative genes. A typical page for display
each of the unisequence contains the following information:

Page 3 of 6
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:250

• Basic features including sequence length, G+C content
and number of related ESTs;
• Clickable schematic view of assembly structure with the
component ESTs color-coded by clone libraries (for contigs only);
• Biologist curated tentative annotation for the unisequence (if assigned);
• Functional classifications including Gene Ontology
associations, KEGG Ontology (KO) classes and KOG clusters assigned (if any);
• Sequence-similarity based prediction of enzyme nomenclature (EC numbers) and possible metabolic pathways
involved (if any);
• Peptidase family by the nomenclature from MEROPS
database (for detectable protease only);
• Graphical representation of potential Pfam domains
and putative transmembrane regions in the sequence (if
any);
• Comparison table of its transcriptional responses to
antifungal agents (if available);
• Plot view of its expression during conidial germination
in time-series (if available);
• CGH results of 22 dermatophyte strains (if available);
• Unisequence with clickable link for download in FASTA
format;
• Nucleic acid sequence of the potential coding region
identified by ESTScan2 (if detectable);
• Predicted peptides that conceptually translated by
ESTScan2 (if detectable);
Most of the above mentioned components of the webpage
provide clickable inter links to other function pages
within TrED, as well as direct links to related pages in
other valuable public resources, such as GenBank, Gene
Ontology, KEGG, KOG, Pfam and MEROPS. By combining various aspects of information with the ability to
access different web repositories, TrED brings researchers
a synergy of dynamic resources publicly available over the
internet.
However, the convenience of retrieving comprehensive
information from a single page is disadvantaged by
requiring more network resources, which could be a seri-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/250

ous obstacle to users who have limited local net speed. To
alleviate the problem, we setup a user-friendly configure
menu for users to fully customize the content to be displayed in the page. It's also amenable to researchers who
have specialized interests in particular aspects of the data.
Another configurable feature for TrED users is the ability
to customize similarity cutoffs for advanced data mining.
Sequence-similarity based function interpretation is still
the major annotation method widely used nowadays.
However, the stringency of the homologous match that
defines a biological function is not a constant applicable
to all cases. A stringent criterion tend to lead to less information, while a loose one may result in vast of spurious
matches. So predefined similarity cutoffs could be arbitrary to some researchers. The customized cutoff values
take effect to all kinds of sequence-similarity based analysis in TrED, such as GO terms assignment and metabolic
pathway reconstruction.
Visualization and comparison of transcriptional profiles
and CGH results
The microarray page available from TrED menu provides
a platform for specialized explorations among all types of
microarray-based data. The expression variations of genes
during the T. rubrum conidial germination can be graphically represented in batch by choosing a dataset from the
analysis menu. CGH results performed on 22 superficial
fungal strains can be easily browsed in a tabular style
upon request. Moreover, in order to facilitate further comparative analysis on the CGH data, an auto filter was set
up to offer users the potential to rapidly examine commonly shared or lost genes within each genus.

Currently, transcriptional profiles of T. rubrum response to
three antifungal agents are integrated into TrED, including
ketoconazole, amphotericin B and a novel synthetic fatty
acid synthase inhibitor PHS11A [8,9]. These data portray
how variations in the transcription levels of particular
genes related to mechanisms for drug sensitivity and
resistance. TrED provides an easy interface to view and
compare different gene expression and drug activity patterns. More data of all dermatophytes are expected to be
involved in future update when available. This is the first
attempt to integrate large gene expression database and
drug discovery screen for dermatophytes.
Search the database and dermatophyte BLAST service
TrED provides a suite of web-based tools that allow users
to query and extract information from the database: (i)
text based search, (ii) annotation based function category
enumeration and (iii) BLAST based sequence-similarity
search.

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:250

The text based database interrogation enables extracting
the current tentative annotations using any querying keywords. A single entry, that is instantly familiar to users of
other internet search engines, is offered for alternative
query words, separated by blanks, or complex phrases
enclosed by double quotation marks. The database is also
searchable by using EST accession number, clone name,
internal ID or a combination thereof.
The tentative annotation for each unisequence in TrED
was manually assigned by biologists based on the
sequence similarities among available resources, such as
GenBank and Pfam. But potential false annotations are
always unavoidable and they might mislead users in some
cases. The extended text search engine was designed to
amend this gap by providing users the ability to query the
original top 100 BLASTX hits in NR database directly. As
the BLASTX comparison results are automated update
bimonthly, the extended search engine is particularly pertinent to active researchers by offering the most current
information with potential clues for further deciphering
the biology of T. rubrum.
Enumeration genes possibly related to given function category provides a simple way to retrieve specialized information for researchers focused on particular areas of T.
rubrum biology. Functional classifications based on controlled vocabulary defined by GO, KOG cluster and KEGG
ontology were currently adopted in TrED. The querying
results, which depend on customized similarity settings
(see above), are displayed in an explicit table with each hit
represented by a row. Furthermore, each listed row in the
output table provides inner link to the individual unisequence page as well as outer links to related public
resources.
BLAST algorithm has been widely used for fast sequencesimilarity searches in numerous databases. By adopting a
web-based BLAST server TrED allows users to perform
sequence comparison against all sequences in the database. Moreover, to facilitate the genomic research on dermatophytes, we developed a dermatophyte BLAST tool in
TrED. While sequence comparisons with common databases, such as GenBank, have been invaluable for gaining
a broad understanding of genomes, single gene comparisons across the relative species are often useful to researchers focused on particular areas of biology [24]. The
dermatophyte BLAST service is designed as a complement
and specialized subclass of the Fungal BLAST tool [24],
and tailored for researchers who concentrate on pathogenic superficial fungi. The sequence datasets include all
available dermatophyte sequences, both nucleic acid and
amino acid, retrieved from GenBank along with ESTs,
unisequences and predicted peptides from TrED. To
reflect the most current sequence data available from con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/250

stantly changing public databases, an automated weekly
updating scheme was implemented for the dermatophyte
BLAST server.
Analyses by TrED
Perhaps one of the most characteristic features of the TrED
user interface is the assignment of unisequences to various
functional and structural categories, which allows users to
focus on specific subset of the tremendous data.

Fungal factors contributing to virulence include antigenic
variability, the presence of fungal adhesions, effective iron
acquisition systems, etc. Most of these molecules are associated with the cell surface. So it's valuable to estimate the
fraction of integral membrane proteins in the T. rubrum
genome. From the current data, 1,520 (14.9%) unisequences occupy detectable transmembrane regions,
including transporters, receptors, channels, sensory transducer and pumps as targets for drugs. But 67.2% of them
are hypothetical proteins or orphan sequences, their real
biological functions and medical significance require further investigations.
A biological characteristic of dermatophytes is their ability
to invade keratinized tissues, so it is evident that secreted
proteases are suspected pivotal virulence determinants.
Each putative protease found in T. rubrum is classified to
related peptidase family by nomenclatures from the
MEROPS database [21]. Most of the proteases identified
in T. rubrum belong to metallo and serine protease family
and 83.9% have homologs in A. fumigatus. Further investigations on protease substrate specificities will improve
our understanding of their functions and contributions to
virulence. Furthermore, the CGH results of these proteases
could help to explain the relative specificities of different
dermatophytes in causing different types of dermatophytosis.
We used Pfam database to search T. rubrum unisequences
for functional domains and other known sequence
motifs. 3,448 (33.7%) had one or more Pfam hits with an
hmmer E-value cutoff of 1. T. rubrum shares three of its
top ten Pfam domains (major facilitator superfamily, WD
domain, and protein kinase domain) with C. immitis [25]
and A. fumigatus [26].
Future prospects
Future TrED development will be dedicated to offer a platform for comparative genomics studies of dermatophytes.
It will integrate sequence, expression and other data associated with dermatophytes. As with the ongoing efforts for
genome sequencing of T. rubrum, certain aspects of the
results will change. We will update the results described
here on a regular basis and contribute to the community
effort.

Conclusion
The enormous influx of information from genome
sequencing projects is revolutionizing the science of fungal pathogenesis. This ranges from understanding the
most basic aspects of gene content and genome organization, to elucidating the mechanisms of host-pathogen
interaction and the development of new diagnostic techniques and vaccines. With the release of the large set of
expression data of T. rubrum, and the integrated database
TrED, significant progress shall be made in unraveling the
intriguing biology of this medically important fungal
pathogen of humans and its mechanisms of virulence.
Gaps in our knowledge will be filled by a combination of
comparative and functional genomics, including techniques such as transcriptomics, bioinformatics, and proteomics.
